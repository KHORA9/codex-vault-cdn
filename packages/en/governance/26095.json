Kenyon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\n\r\n...[They were tried] by a court empanelled from among the noble\r\nfamilies, and sworn upon the sacrifices. The part of accuser was taken\r\nby Myron. They were found guilty of the sacrilege, and their bodies\r\nwere cast out of their graves and their race banished for evermore. In\r\nview of this expiation, Epimenides the Cretan performed a purification\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\nAfter this event there was contention for a long time between the upper\r\nclasses and the populace. Not only was the constitution at this time\r\noligarchical in every respect, but the poorer classes, men, women, and\r\nchildren, were the serfs of the rich. They were known as Pelatae and\r\nalso as Hectemori, because they cultivated the lands of the rich at the\r\nrent thus indicated. The whole country was in the hands of a few\r\npersons, and if the tenants failed to pay their rent they were liable\r\nto be haled into slavery, and their children with them. All loans\r\nsecured upon the debtor's person, a custom which prevailed until the\r\ntime of Solon, who was the first to appear as the champion of the\r\npeople. But the hardest and bitterest part of the constitution in the\r\neyes of the masses was their state of serfdom.  Not but what they were\r\nalso discontented with every other feature of their lot; for, to speak\r\ngenerally, they had no part nor share in anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3\r\n\r\nNow the ancient constitution, as it existed before the time of Draco,\r\nwas organized as follows. The magistrates were elected according to\r\nqualifications of birth and wealth. At first they governed for life,\r\nbut subsequently for terms of ten years. The first magistrates, both in\r\ndate and in importance, were the King, the Polemarch, and the Archon.\r\nThe earliest of these offices was that of the King, which existed from\r\nancestral antiquity. To this was added, secondly, the office of\r\nPolemarch, on account of some of the kings proving feeble in war; for\r\nit was on this account that Ion was invited to accept the post on an\r\noccasion of pressing need. The last of the three offices was that of\r\nthe Archon, which most authorities state to have come into existence in\r\nthe time of Medon.  Others assign it to the time of Acastus, and adduce\r\nas proof the fact that the nine Archons swear to execute their oaths\r\n'as in the days of Acastus,' which seems to suggest that it was in his\r\ntime that the descendants of Codrus retired from the kingship in return\r\nfor the prerogatives conferred upon the Archon. Whichever way it may\r\nbe, the difference in date is small; but that it was the last of these\r\nmagistracies to be created is shown by the fact that the Archon has no\r\npart in the ancestral sacrifices, as the King and the Polemarch have,\r\nbut exclusively in those of later origin. So it is only at a\r\ncomparatively late date that the office of Archon has become of great\r\nimportance, through the dignity conferred by these later additions. The\r\nThesmothetae were many years afterwards, when these offices had already\r\nbecome annual, with the object that they might publicly record all\r\nlegal decisions, and act as guardians of them with a view to\r\ndetermining the issues between litigants. Accordingly their office,\r\nalone of those which have been mentioned, was never of more than annual\r\nduration.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is the relative chronological precedence of these offices.\r\nAt that time the nine Archons did not all live together.  The King\r\noccupied the building now known as the Boculium, near the Prytaneum, as\r\nmay be seen from the fact that even to the present day the marriage of\r\nthe King's wife to Dionysus takes place there. The Archon lived in the\r\nPrytaneum, the Polemarch in the Epilyceum. The latter building was\r\nformerly called the Polemarcheum, but after Epilycus, during his term\r\nof office as Polemarch, had rebuilt it and fitted it up, it was called\r\nthe Epilyceum. The Thesmothetae occupied the Thesmotheteum. In the time\r\nof Solon, however, they all came together into the Thesmotheteum. They\r\nhad power to decide cases finally on their own authority, not, as now,\r\nmerely to hold a preliminary hearing. Such then was the arrangement of\r\nthe magistracies. The Council of Areopagus had as its constitutionally\r\nassigned duty the protection of the laws; but in point of fact it\r\nadministered the greater and most important part of the government of\r\nthe state, and inflicted personal punishments and fines summarily upon\r\nall who misbehaved themselves. This was the natural consequence of the\r\nfacts that the Archons were elected under qualifications of birth and\r\nwealth, and that the Areopagus was composed of those who had served as\r\nArchons; for which latter reason the membership of the Areopagus is the\r\nonly office which has continued to be a life-magistracy to the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 4\r\n\r\nSuch was, in outline, the first constitution, but not very long after\r\nthe events above recorded, in the archonship of Aristaichmus, Draco\r\nenacted his ordinances. Now his constitution had the following form.\r\nThe franchise was given to all who could furnish themselves with a\r\nmilitary equipment. The nine Archons and the Treasurers were elected by\r\nthis body from persons possessing an unencumbered property of not less\r\nthan ten minas, the less important officials from those who could\r\nfurnish themselves with a military equipment, and the generals\r\n[Strategi] and commanders of the cavalry [Hipparchi] from those who\r\ncould show an unencumbered property of not less than a hundred minas,\r\nand had children born in lawful wedlock over ten years of age. These\r\nofficers were required to hold to bail the Prytanes, the Strategi, and\r\nthe Hipparchi of the preceding year until their accounts had been\r\naudited, taking four securities of the same class as that to which the\r\nStrategi and the Hipparchi belonged. There was also to be a Council,\r\nconsisting of four hundred and one members, elected by lot from among\r\nthose who possessed the franchise. Both for this and for the other\r\nmagistracies the lot was cast among those who were over thirty years of\r\nage; and no one might hold office twice until every one else had had\r\nhis turn, after which they were to cast the lot afresh. If any member\r\nof the Council failed to attend when there was a sitting of the Council\r\nor of the Assembly, he paid a fine, to the amount of three drachmas if\r\nhe was a Pentacosiomedimnus, two if he was a Knight, and One if he was\r\na Zeugites. The Council of Areopagus was guardian of the laws, and kept\r\nwatch over the magistrates to see that they executed their offices in\r\naccordance with the laws. Any person who felt himself wronged might lay\r\nan information before the Council of Areopagus, on declaring what law\r\nwas broken by the wrong done to him. But, as has been said before,\r\nloans were secured upon the persons of the debtors, and the land was in\r\nthe hands of a few.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 5\r\n\r\nSince such, then, was the organization of the constitution, and the\r\nmany were in slavery to the few, the people rose against the upper\r\nclass. The strife was keen, and for a long time the two parties were\r\nranged in hostile camps against one another, till at last, by common\r\nconsent, they appointed Solon to be mediator and Archon, and committed\r\nthe whole constitution to his hands. The immediate occasion of his\r\nappointment was his poem, which begins with the words:\r\n\r\n  I behold, and within my heart deep sadness has claimed its place,\r\n  As I mark the oldest home of the ancient Ionian race\r\n  Slain by the sword.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this poem he fights and disputes on behalf of each party in turn\r\nagainst the other, and finally he advises them to come to terms and put\r\nan end to the quarrel existing between them. By birth and reputation\r\nSolon was one of the foremost men of the day, but in wealth and\r\nposition he was of the middle class, as is generally agreed, and is,\r\nindeed, established by his own evidence in these poems, where he\r\nexhorts the wealthy not to be grasping.\r\n\r\n  But ye who have store of good, who are sated and overflow,\r\n  Restrain your swelling soul, and still it and keep it low:\r\n  Let the heart that is great within you be trained a lowlier way;\r\n  Ye shall not have all at your will, and we will not for ever obey.\r\n\r\nIndeed, he constantly fastens the blame of the conflict on the rich;\r\nand accordingly at the beginning of the poem he says that he fears 'the\r\nlove of wealth and an overweening mind', evidently meaning that it was\r\nthrough these that the quarrel arose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 6\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was at the head of affairs, Solon liberated the people\r\nonce and for all, by prohibiting all loans on the security of the\r\ndebtor's person: and in addition he made laws by which he cancelled all\r\ndebts, public and private. This measure is commonly called the\r\nSeisachtheia [= removal of burdens], since thereby the people had their\r\nloads removed from them. In connexion with it some persons try to\r\ntraduce the character of Solon. It so happened that, when he was about\r\nto enact the Seisachtheia, he communicated his intention to some\r\nmembers of the upper class, whereupon, as the partisans of the popular\r\nparty say, his friends stole a march on him; while those who wish to\r\nattack his character maintain that he too had a share in the fraud\r\nhimself. For these persons borrowed money and bought up a large amount\r\nof land, and so when, a short time afterwards, all debts were\r\ncancelled, they became wealthy; and this, they say, was the origin of\r\nthe families which were afterwards looked on as having been wealthy\r\nfrom primeval times. However, the story of the popular party is by far\r\nthe most probable. A man who was so moderate and public-spirited in all\r\nhis other actions, that when it was within his power to put his\r\nfellow-citizens beneath his feet and establish himself as tyrant, he\r\npreferred instead to incur the hostility of both parties by placing his\r\nhonour and the general welfare above his personal aggrandisement, is\r\nnot likely to have consented to defile his hands by such a petty and\r\npalpable fraud. That he had this absolute power is, in the first place,\r\nindicated by the desperate condition the country; moreover, he mentions\r\nit himself repeatedly in his poems, and it is universally admitted. We\r\nare therefore bound to consider this accusation to be false.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 7\r\n\r\nNext Solon drew up a constitution and enacted new laws; and the\r\nordinances of Draco ceased to be used, with the exception of those\r\nrelating to murder. The laws were inscribed on the wooden stands, and\r\nset up in the King's Porch, and all swore to obey them; and the nine\r\nArchons made oath upon the stone, declaring that they would dedicate a\r\ngolden statue if they should transgress any of them. This is the origin\r\nof the oath to that effect which they take to the present day. Solon\r\nratified his laws for a hundred years; and the following was the\r\nfashion in which he organized the constitution. He divided the\r\npopulation according to property into four classes, just as it had been\r\ndivided before, namely, Pentacosiomedimni, Knights, Zeugitae, and\r\nThetes. The various magistracies, namely, the nine Archons, the\r\nTreasurers, the Commissioners for Public Contracts (Poletae), the\r\nEleven, and Clerks (Colacretae), he assigned to the Pentacosiomedimni,\r\nthe Knights, and the Zeugitae, giving offices to each class in\r\nproportion to the value of their rateable property. To who ranked among\r\nthe Thetes he gave nothing but a place in the Assembly and in the\r\njuries. A man had to rank as a Pentacosiomedimnus if he made, from his\r\nown land, five hundred measures, whether liquid or solid. Those ranked\r\nas Knights who made three hundred measures, or, as some say, those who\r\nwere able to maintain a horse. In support of the latter definition they\r\nadduce the name of the class, which may be supposed to be derived from\r\nthis fact, and also some votive offerings of early times; for in the\r\nAcropolis there is a votive offering, a statue of Diphilus, bearing\r\nthis inscription:\r\n\r\n  The son of Diphilus, Athenion hight,\r\n  Raised from the Thetes and become a knight,\r\n  Did to the gods this sculptured charger bring,\r\n  For his promotion a thank-offering.\r\n\r\nAnd a horse stands in evidence beside the man, implying that this was\r\nwhat was meant by belonging to the rank of Knight. At the same time it\r\nseems reasonable to suppose that this class, like the\r\nPentacosiomedimni, was defined by the possession of an income of a\r\ncertain number of measures. Those ranked as Zeugitae who made two\r\nhundred measures, liquid or solid; and the rest ranked as Thetes, and\r\nwere not eligible for any office. Hence it is that even at the present\r\nday, when a candidate for any office is asked to what class he belongs,\r\nno one would think of saying that he belonged to the Thetes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 8\r\n\r\nThe elections to the various offices Solon enacted should be by lot,\r\nout of candidates selected by each of the tribes. Each tribe selected\r\nten candidates for the nine archonships, and among these the lot was\r\ncast. Hence it is still the custom for each tribe to choose ten\r\ncandidates by lot, and then the lot is again cast among these. A proof\r\nthat Solon regulated the elections to office according to the property\r\nclasses may be found in the law still in force with regard to the\r\nTreasurers, which enacts that they shall be chosen from the\r\nPentacosiomedimni. Such was Solon's legislation with respect to the\r\nnine Archons; whereas in early times the Council of Areopagus summoned\r\nsuitable persons according to its own judgement and appointed them for\r\nthe year to the several offices. There were four tribes, as before, and\r\nfour tribe-kings. Each tribe was divided into three Trittyes [=Thirds],\r\nwith twelve Naucraries in each; and the Naucraries had officers of\r\ntheir own, called Naucrari, whose duty it was to superintend the\r\ncurrent receipts and expenditure. Hence, among the laws of Solon now\r\nobsolete, it is repeatedly written that the Naucrari are to receive and\r\nto spend out of the Naucraric fund.  Solon also appointed a Council of\r\nfour hundred, a hundred from each tribe; but he assigned to the Council\r\nof the Areopagus the duty of superintending the laws, acting as before\r\nas the guardian of the constitution in general. It kept watch over the\r\naffairs of the state in most of the more important matters, and\r\ncorrected offenders, with full powers to inflict either fines or\r\npersonal punishment. The money received in fines it brought up into the\r\nAcropolis, without assigning the reason for the mulct. It also tried\r\nthose who conspired for the overthrow of the state, Solon having\r\nenacted a process of impeachment to deal with such offenders. Further,\r\nsince he saw the state often engaged in internal disputes, while many\r\nof the citizens from sheer indifference accepted whatever might turn\r\nup, he made a law with express reference to such persons, enacting that\r\nany one who, in a time [Transcriber's note: of?] civil factions, did\r\nnot take up arms with either party, should lose his rights as a citizen\r\nand cease to have any part in the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 9\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was his legislation concerning the magistracies. There are\r\nthree points in the constitution of Solon which appear to be its most\r\ndemocratic features: first and most important, the prohibition of loans\r\non the security of the debtor's person; secondly, the right of every\r\nperson who so willed to claim redress on behalf of any one to whom\r\nwrong was being done; thirdly, the institution of the appeal to the\r\njurycourts; and it is to this last, they say, that the masses have owed\r\ntheir strength most of all, since, when the democracy is master of the\r\nvoting-power, it is master of the constitution.  Moreover, since the\r\nlaws were not drawn up in simple and explicit terms (but like the one\r\nconcerning inheritances and wards of state), disputes inevitably\r\noccurred, and the courts had to decide in every matter, whether public\r\nor private. Some persons in fact believe that Solon deliberately made\r\nthe laws indefinite, in order that the final decision might be in the\r\nhands of the people. This, however, is not probable, and the reason no\r\ndoubt was that it is impossible to attain ideal perfection when framing\r\na law in general terms; for we must judge of his intentions, not from\r\nthe actual results in the present day, but from the general tenor of\r\nthe rest of his legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 10\r\n\r\nThese seem to be the democratic features of his laws; but in addition,\r\nbefore the period of his legislation, he carried through his abolition\r\nof debts, and after it his increase in the standards of weights and\r\nmeasures, and of the currency. During his administration the measures\r\nwere made larger than those of Pheidon, and the mina, which previously\r\nhad a standard of seventy drachmas, was raised to the full hundred. The\r\nstandard coin in earlier times was the two-drachma piece. He also made\r\nweights corresponding with the coinage, sixty-three minas going to the\r\ntalent; and the odd three minas were distributed among the staters and\r\nthe other values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 11\r\n\r\nWhen he had completed his organization of the constitution in the\r\nmanner that has been described, he found himself beset by people coming\r\nto him and harassing him concerning his laws, criticizing here and\r\nquestioning there, till, as he wished neither to alter what he had\r\ndecided on nor yet to be an object of ill will to every one by\r\nremaining in Athens, he set off on a journey to Egypt, with the\r\ncombined objects of trade and travel, giving out that he should not\r\nreturn for ten years. He considered that there was no call for him to\r\nexpound the laws personally, but that every one should obey them just\r\nas they were written. Moreover, his position at this time was\r\nunpleasant. Many members of the upper class had been estranged from him\r\non account of his abolition of debts, and both parties were alienated\r\nthrough their disappointment at the condition of things which he had\r\ncreated. The mass of the people had expected him to make a complete\r\nredistribution of all property, and the upper class hoped he would\r\nrestore everything to its former position, or, at any rate, make but a\r\nsmall change. Solon, however, had resisted both classes. He might have\r\nmade himself a despot by attaching himself to whichever party he chose,\r\nbut he preferred, though at the cost of incurring the enmity of both,\r\nto be the saviour of his country and the ideal lawgiver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 12\r\n\r\nThe truth of this view of Solon's policy is established alike by common\r\nconsent, and by the mention he has himself made of the matter in his\r\npoems. Thus:\r\n\r\n  I gave to the mass of the people such rank as befitted their need,\r\n  I took not away their honour, and I granted naught to their greed;\r\n  While those who were rich in power, who in wealth were glorious\r\n      and great,\r\n  I bethought me that naught should befall them unworthy their\r\n      splendour and state;\r\n  So I stood with my shield outstretched, and both were safe in\r\n      its sight,\r\n  And I would not that either should triumph, when the triumph was\r\n      not with right.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain he declares how the mass of the people ought to be treated:\r\n\r\n  But thus will the people best the voice of their leaders obey,\r\n  When neither too slack is the rein, nor violence holdeth the sway;\r\n  For indulgence breedeth a child, the presumption that spurns control,\r\n  When riches too great are poured upon men of unbalanced soul.\r\n\r\nAnd again elsewhere he speaks about the persons who wished to\r\nredistribute the land:\r\n\r\n  So they came in search of plunder, and their cravings knew no bound,\r\n  Every one among them deeming endless wealth would here be found.\r\n  And that I with glozing smoothness hid a cruel mind within.\r\n  Fondly then and vainly dreamt they; now they raise an angry din,\r\n  And they glare askance in anger, and the light within their eyes\r\n  Burns with hostile flames upon me. Yet therein no justice lies.\r\n  All I promised, fully wrought I with the gods at hand to cheer,\r\n  Naught beyond in folly ventured. Never to my soul was dear\r\n  With a tyrant's force to govern, nor to see the good and base\r\n  Side by side in equal portion share the rich home of our race.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce more he speaks of the abolition of debts and of those who before\r\nwere in servitude, but were released owing to the Seisachtheia:\r\n\r\n  Of all the aims for which I summoned forth\r\n  The people, was there one I compassed not?\r\n  Thou, when slow time brings justice in its train,\r\n  O mighty mother of the Olympian gods,\r\n  Dark Earth, thou best canst witness, from whose breast\r\n  I swept the pillars broadcast planted there,\r\n  And made thee free, who hadst been slave of yore.\r\n  And many a man whom fraud or law had sold\r\n  For from his god-built land, an outcast slave,\r\n  I brought again to Athens; yea, and some,\r\n  Exiles from home through debt's oppressive load,\r\n  Speaking no more the dear ATHENIAN tongue,\r\n  But wandering far and wide, I brought again;\r\n\r\n  And those that here in vilest slavery\r\n  Crouched 'neath a master's frown, I set them free.\r\n  Thus might and right were yoked in harmony,\r\n  Since by the force of law I won my ends\r\n  And kept my promise. Equal laws I gave\r\n  To evil and to good, with even hand\r\n  Drawing straight justice for the lot of each.\r\n  But had another held the goad as\r\n  One in whose heart was guile and greediness,\r\n  He had not kept the people back from strife.\r\n  For had I granted, now what pleased the one,\r\n  Then what their foes devised in counterpoise,\r\n  Of many a man this state had been bereft.\r\n  Therefore I showed my might on every side,\r\n  Turning at bay like wolf among the hounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again he reviles both parties for their grumblings in the times\r\nthat followed:\r\n\r\n  Nay, if one must lay blame where blame is due,\r\n  Wer't not for me, the people ne'er had set\r\n  Their eyes upon these blessings e'en in dreams:\r\n  While greater men, the men of wealthier life,\r\n  Should praise me and should court me as their friend.\r\n\r\nFor had any other man, he says, received this exalted post,\r\n\r\n  He had not kept the people back, nor ceased\r\n  Til he had robbed the richness of the milk.\r\n  But I stood forth a landmark in the midst,\r\n  And barred the foes from battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 13\r\n\r\nSuch then, were Solon's reasons for his departure from the country.\r\nAfter his retirement the city was still torn by divisions.  For four\r\nyears, indeed, they lived in peace; but in the fifth year after Solon's\r\ngovernment they were unable to elect an Archon on account of their\r\ndissensions, and again four years later they elected no Archon for the\r\nsame reason. Subsequently, after a similar period had elapsed, Damasias\r\nwas elected Archon; and he governed for two years and two months, until\r\nhe was forcibly expelled from his office. After this, it was agreed, as\r\na compromise, to elect ten Archons, five from the Eupatridae, three\r\nfrom the Agroeci, and two from the Demiurgi, and they ruled for the\r\nyear following Damasias.  It is clear from this that the Archon was at\r\nthe time the magistrate who possessed the greatest power, since it is\r\nalways in connexion with this office that conflicts are seen to arise.\r\nBut altogether they were in a continual state of internal disorder.\r\nSome found the cause and justification of their discontent in the\r\nabolition of debts, because thereby they had been reduced to poverty;\r\nothers were dissatisfied with the political constitution, because it\r\nhad undergone a revolutionary change; while with others the motive was\r\nfound in personal rivalries among themselves. The parties at this time\r\nwere three in number. First there was the party of the Shore, led by\r\nMegacles the son of Alcmeon, which was considered to aim at a moderate\r\nform of government; then there were the men of the Plain, who desired\r\nan oligarchy and were led by Lycurgus; and thirdly there were the men\r\nof the Highlands, at the head of whom was Pisistratus, who was looked\r\non as an extreme democrat. This latter party was reinforced by those\r\nwho had been deprived of the debts due to them, from motives of\r\npoverty, and by those who were not of pure descent, from motives of\r\npersonal apprehension. A proof of this is seen in the fact that after\r\nthe tyranny was overthrown a revision was made of the citizen-roll, on\r\nthe ground that many persons were partaking in the franchise without\r\nhaving a right to it. The names given to the respective parties were\r\nderived from the districts in which they held their lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 14\r\n\r\nPisistratus had the reputation of being an extreme democrat, and he\r\nalso had distinguished himself greatly in the war with Megara.  Taking\r\nadvantage of this, he wounded himself, and by representing that his\r\ninjuries had been inflicted on him by his political rivals, he\r\npersuaded the people, through a motion proposed by Aristion, to grant\r\nhim a bodyguard. After he had got these 'club-bearers', as they were\r\ncalled, he made an attack with them on the people and seized the\r\nAcropolis. This happened in the archonship of Comeas, thirty-one years\r\nafter the legislation of Solon. It is related that, when Pisistratus\r\nasked for his bodyguard, Solon opposed the request, and declared that\r\nin so doing he proved himself wiser than half the people and braver\r\nthan the rest,--wiser than those who did not see that Pisistratus\r\ndesigned to make himself tyrant, and braver than those who saw it and\r\nkept silence. But when all his words availed nothing he carried forth\r\nhis armour and set it up in front of his house, saying that he had\r\nhelped his country so far as lay in his power (he was already a very\r\nold man), and that he called on all others to do the same. Solon's\r\nexhortations, however, proved fruitless, and Pisistratus assumed the\r\nsovereignty. His administration was more like a constitutional\r\ngovernment than the rule of a tyrant; but before his power was firmly\r\nestablished, the adherents of Megacles and Lycurgus made a coalition\r\nand drove him out. This took place in the archonship of Hegesias, five\r\nyears after the first establishment of his rule. Eleven years later\r\nMegacles, being in difficulties in a party struggle, again opened\r\nnegotiations with Pisistratus, proposing that the latter should marry\r\nhis daughter; and on these terms he brought him back to Athens, by a\r\nvery primitive and simple-minded device. He first spread abroad a\r\nrumour that Athens was bringing back Pisistratus, and then, having\r\nfound a woman of great stature and beauty, named Phye (according to\r\nHerodotus, of the deme of Paeania, but as others say a Thracian\r\nflower-seller of the deme of Collytus), he dressed her in a garb\r\nresembling that of the goddess and brought her into the city with\r\nPisistratus. The latter drove in on a chariot with the woman beside\r\nhim, and the inhabitants of the city, struck with awe, received him\r\nwith adoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 15\r\n\r\nIn this manner did his first return take place. He did not, however,\r\nhold his power long, for about six years after his return he was again\r\nexpelled. He refused to treat the daughter of Megacles as his wife, and\r\nbeing afraid, in consequence, of a combination of the two opposing\r\nparties, he retired from the country. First he led a colony to a place\r\ncalled Rhaicelus, in the region of the Thermaic gulf; and thence he\r\npassed to the country in the neighbourhood of Mt. Pangaeus. Here he\r\nacquired wealth and hired mercenaries; and not till ten years had\r\nelapsed did he return to Eretria and make an attempt to recover the\r\ngovernment by force. In this he had the assistance of many allies,\r\nnotably the Thebans and Lygdamis of Naxos, and also the Knights who\r\nheld the supreme power in the constitution of Eretria. After his\r\nvictory in the battle at Pallene he captured Athens, and when he had\r\ndisarmed the people he at last had his tyranny securely established,\r\nand was able to take Naxos and set up Lygdamis as ruler there. He\r\neffected the disarmament of the people in the following manner. He\r\nordered a parade in full armour in the Theseum, and began to make a\r\nspeech to the people. He spoke for a short time, until the people\r\ncalled out that they could not hear him, whereupon he bade them come up\r\nto the entrance of the Acropolis, in order that his voice might be\r\nbetter heard. Then, while he continued to speak to them at great\r\nlength, men whom he had appointed for the purpose collected the arms\r\nand locked them up in the chambers of the Theseum hard by, and came and\r\nmade a signal to him that it was done. Pisistratus accordingly, when he\r\nhad finished the rest of what he had to say, told the people also what\r\nhad happened to their arms; adding that they were not to be surprised\r\nor alarmed, but go home and attend to their private affairs, while he\r\nwould himself for the future manage all the business of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 16\r\n\r\nSuch was the origin and such the vicissitudes of the tyranny of\r\nPisistratus. His administration was temperate, as has been said before,\r\nand more like constitutional government than a tyranny. Not only was he\r\nin every respect humane and mild and ready to forgive those who\r\noffended, but, in addition, he advanced money to the poorer people to\r\nhelp them in their labours, so that they might make their living by\r\nagriculture. In this he had two objects, first that they might not\r\nspend their time in the city but might be scattered over all the face\r\nof the country, and secondly that, being moderately well off and\r\noccupied with their own business, they might have neither the wish nor\r\nthe time to attend to public affairs. At the same time his revenues\r\nwere increased by the thorough cultivation of the country, since he\r\nimposed a tax of one tenth on all the produce.  For the same reasons he\r\ninstituted the local justices, and often made expeditions in person\r\ninto the country to inspect it and to settle disputes between\r\nindividuals, that they might not come into the city and neglect their\r\nfarms. It was in one of these progresses that, as the story goes,\r\nPisistratus had his adventure with the man of Hymettus, who was\r\ncultivating the spot afterwards known as 'Tax-free Farm'. He saw a man\r\ndigging and working at a very stony piece of ground, and being\r\nsurprised he sent his attendant to ask what he got out of this plot of\r\nland. 'Aches and pains', said the man; 'and that's what Pisistratus\r\nought to have his tenth of'. The man spoke without knowing who his\r\nquestioner was; but Pisistratus was so pleased with his frank speech and\r\nhis industry that he granted him exemption from all taxes. And so in\r\nmatters in general he burdened the people as little as possible with\r\nhis government, but always cultivated peace and kept them in all\r\nquietness. Hence the tyranny of Pisistratus was often spoken of\r\nproverbially as 'the age of gold'; for when his sons succeeded him the\r\ngovernment became much harsher. But most important of all in this\r\nrespect was his popular and kindly disposition. In all things he was\r\naccustomed to observe the laws, without giving himself any exceptional\r\nprivileges. Once he was summoned on a charge of homicide before the\r\nAreopagus, and he appeared in person to make his defence; but the\r\nprosecutor was afraid to present himself and abandoned the case. For\r\nthese reasons he held power long, and whenever he was expelled he\r\nregained his position easily. The majority alike of the upper class and\r\nof the people were in his favour; the former he won by his social\r\nintercourse with them, the latter by the assistance which he gave to\r\ntheir private purses, and his nature fitted him to win the hearts of\r\nboth. Moreover, the laws in reference to tyrants at that time in force\r\nat Athens were very mild, especially the one which applies more\r\nparticularly to the establishment of a tyranny. The law ran as follows:\r\n'These are the ancestral statutes of the ATHENIANs; if any persons\r\nshall make an attempt to establish a tyranny, or if any person shall\r\njoin in setting up a tyranny, he shall lose his civic rights, both\r\nhimself and his whole house.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 17\r\n\r\nThus did Pisistratus grow old in the possession of power, and he died a\r\nnatural death in the archonship of Philoneos, three and thirty years\r\nfrom the time at which he first established himself as tyrant, during\r\nnineteen of which he was in possession of power; the rest he spent in\r\nexile. It is evident from this that the story is mere gossip which\r\nstates that Pisistratus was the youthful favourite of Solon and\r\ncommanded in the war against Megara for the recovery of Salamis. It\r\nwill not harmonize with their respective ages, as any one may see who\r\nwill reckon up the years of the life of each of them, and the dates at\r\nwhich they died. After the death of Pisistratus his sons took up the\r\ngovernment, and conducted it on the same system. He had two sons by his\r\nfirst and legitimate wife, Hippias and Hipparchus, and two by his\r\nArgive consort, Iophon and Hegesistratus, who was surnamed Thessalus.\r\nFor Pisistratus took a wife from Argos, Timonassa, the daughter of a\r\nman of Argos, named Gorgilus; she had previously been the wife of\r\nArchinus of Ambracia, one of the descendants of Cypselus. This was the\r\norigin of his friendship with the Argives, on account of which a\r\nthousand of them were brought over by Hegesistratus and fought on his\r\nside in the battle at Pallene.  Some authorities say that this marriage\r\ntook place after his first expulsion from Athens, others while he was\r\nin possession of the government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 18\r\n\r\nHippias and Hipparchus assumed the control of affairs on grounds alike\r\nof standing and of age; but Hippias, as being also naturally of a\r\nstatesmanlike and shrewd disposition, was really the head of the\r\ngovernment. Hipparchus was youthful in disposition, amorous, and fond\r\nof literature (it was he who invited to Athens Anacreon, Simonides, and\r\nthe other poets), while Thessalus was much junior in age, and was\r\nviolent and headstrong in his behaviour. It was from his character that\r\nall the evils arose which befell the house. He became enamoured of\r\nHarmodius, and, since he failed to win his affection, he lost all\r\nrestraint upon his passion, and in addition to other exhibitions of\r\nrage he finally prevented the sister of Harmodius from taking the part\r\nof a basket-bearer in the Panathenaic procession, alleging as his\r\nreason that Harmodius was a person of loose life. Thereupon, in a\r\nfrenzy of wrath, Harmodius and Aristogeiton did their celebrated deed,\r\nin conjunction with a number of confederates. But while they were lying\r\nin wait for Hippias in the Acropolis at the time of the Panathenaea\r\n(Hippias, at this moment, was awaiting the arrival of the procession,\r\nwhile Hipparchus was organizing its dispatch) they saw one of the\r\npersons privy to the plot talking familiarly with him. Thinking that he\r\nwas betraying them, and desiring to do something before they were\r\narrested, they rushed down and made their attempt without waiting for\r\nthe rest of their confederates. They succeeded in killing Hipparchus\r\nnear the Leocoreum while he was engaged in arranging the procession,\r\nbut ruined the design as a whole; of the two leaders, Harmodius was\r\nkilled on the spot by the guards, while Aristogeiton was arrested, and\r\nperished later after suffering long tortures. While under the torture\r\nhe accused many persons who belonged by birth to the most distinguished\r\nfamilies and were also personal friends of the tyrants. At first the\r\ngovernment could find no clue to the conspiracy; for the current story,\r\nthat Hippias made all who were taking part in the procession leave\r\ntheir arms, and then detected those who were carrying secret daggers,\r\ncannot be true, since at that time they did not bear arms in the\r\nprocessions, this being a custom instituted at a later period by the\r\ndemocracy. According to the story of the popular party, Aristogeiton\r\naccused the friends of the tyrants with the deliberate intention that\r\nthe latter might commit an impious act, and at the same time weaken\r\nthemselves, by putting to death innocent men who were their own\r\nfriends; others say that he told no falsehood, but was betraying the\r\nactual accomplices. At last, when for all his efforts he could not\r\nobtain release by death, he promised to give further information\r\nagainst a number of other persons; and, having induced Hippias to give\r\nhim his hand to confirm his word, as soon as he had hold of it he\r\nreviled him for giving his hand to the murderer of his brother, till\r\nHippias, in a frenzy of rage, lost control of himself and snatched out\r\nhis dagger and dispatched him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 19\r\n\r\nAfter this event the tyranny became much harsher. In consequence of his\r\nvengeance for his brother, and of the execution and banishment of a\r\nlarge number of persons, Hippias became a distrusted and an embittered\r\nman. About three years after the death of Hipparchus, finding his\r\nposition in the city insecure, he set about fortifying Munichia, with\r\nthe intention of establishing himself there.  While he was still\r\nengaged on this work, however, he was expelled by Cleomenes, king of\r\nLacedaemon, in consequence of the Spartans being continually incited by\r\noracles to overthrow the tyranny.  These oracles were obtained in the\r\nfollowing way. The Athenian exiles, headed by the Alcmeonidae, could\r\nnot by their own power effect their return, but failed continually in\r\ntheir attempts. Among their other failures, they fortified a post in\r\nAttica, Lipsydrium, above Mt. Parnes, and were there joined by some\r\npartisans from the city; but they were besieged by the tyrants and\r\nreduced to surrender. After this disaster the following became a\r\npopular drinking song:\r\n\r\n  Ah! Lipsydrium, faithless friend!\r\n  Lo, what heroes to death didst send,\r\n  Nobly born and great in deed!\r\n  Well did they prove themselves at need\r\n  Of noble sires a noble seed.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving failed, then, in every other method, they took the contract for\r\nrebuilding the temple at Delphi, thereby obtaining ample funds, which\r\nthey employed to secure the help of the Lacedaemonians. All this time\r\nthe Pythia kept continually enjoining on the Lacedaemonians who came to\r\nconsult the oracle, that they must free Athens; till finally she\r\nsucceeded in impelling the Spartans to that step, although the house of\r\nPisistratus was connected with them by ties of hospitality.  The\r\nresolution of the Lacedaemonians was, however, at least equally due to\r\nthe friendship which had been formed between the house of Pisistratus\r\nand Argos. Accordingly they first sent Anchimolus by sea at the head of\r\nan army; but he was defeated and killed, through the arrival of Cineas\r\nof Thessaly to support the sons of Pisistratus with a force of a\r\nthousand horsemen. Then, being roused to anger by this disaster, they\r\nsent their king, Cleomenes, by land at the head of a larger force; and\r\nhe, after defeating the Thessalian cavalry when they attempted to\r\nintercept his march into Attica, shut up Hippias within what was known\r\nas the Pelargic wall and blockaded him there with the assistance of the\r\nAthenians. While he was sitting down before the place, it so happened\r\nthat the sons of the Pisistratidae were captured in an attempt to slip\r\nout; upon which the tyrants capitulated on condition of the safety of\r\ntheir children, and surrendered the Acropolis to the Athenians, five\r\ndays being first allowed them to remove their effects. This took place\r\nin the archonship of Harpactides, after they had held the tyranny for\r\nabout seventeen years since their father's death, or in all, including\r\nthe period of their father's rule, for nine-and-forty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 20\r\n\r\nAfter the overthrow of the tyranny, the rival leaders in the state were\r\nIsagoras son of Tisander, a partisan of the tyrants, and Cleisthenes,\r\nwho belonged to the family of the Alcmeonidae.  Cleisthenes, being\r\nbeaten in the political clubs, called in the people by giving the\r\nfranchise to the masses. Thereupon Isagoras, finding himself left\r\ninferior in power, invited Cleomenes, who was united to him by ties of\r\nhospitality, to return to Athens, and persuaded him to 'drive out the\r\npollution', a plea derived from the fact that the Alcmeonidae were\r\nsuppposed to be under the curse of pollution. On this Cleisthenes\r\nretired from the country, and Cleomenes, entering Attica with a small\r\nforce, expelled, as polluted, seven hundred Athenian families. Having\r\neffected this, he next attempted to dissolve the Council, and to set up\r\nIsagoras and three hundred of his partisans as the supreme power in the\r\nstate. The Council, however, resisted, the populace flocked together,\r\nand Cleomenes and Isagoras, with their adherents, took refuge in the\r\nAcropolis. Here the people sat down and besieged them for two days; and\r\non the third they agreed to let Cleomenes and all his followers depart,\r\nwhile they summoned Cleisthenes and the other exiles back to Athens.\r\nWhen the people had thus obtained the command of affairs, Cleisthenes\r\nwas their chief and popular leader. And this was natural; for the\r\nAlcmeonidae were perhaps the chief cause of the expulsion of the\r\ntyrants, and for the greater part of their rule were at perpetual war\r\nwith them. But even earlier than the attempts of the Alcmeonidae, one\r\nCedon made an attack on the tyrants; when there came another popular\r\ndrinking song, addressed to him:\r\n\r\n  Pour a health yet again, boy, to Cedon; forget not this duty to do,\r\n  If a health is an honour befitting the name of a good man and true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 21\r\n\r\nThe people, therefore, had good reason to place confidence in\r\nCleisthenes. Accordingly, now that he was the popular leader, three\r\nyears after the expulsion of the tyrants, in the archonship of\r\nIsagoras, his first step was to distribute the whole population into\r\nten tribes in place of the existing four, with the object of\r\nintermixing the members of the different tribes, and so securing that\r\nmore persons might have a share in the franchise. From this arose the\r\nsaying 'Do not look at the tribes', addressed to those who wished to\r\nscrutinize the lists of the old families. Next he made the Council to\r\nconsist of five hundred members instead of four hundred, each tribe now\r\ncontributing fifty, whereas formerly each had sent a hundred. The\r\nreason why he did not organize the people into twelve tribes was that\r\nhe might not have to use the existing division into trittyes; for the\r\nfour tribes had twelve trittyes, so that he would not have achieved his\r\nobject of redistributing the population in fresh combinations. Further,\r\nhe divided the country into thirty groups of demes, ten from the\r\ndistricts about the city, ten from the coast, and ten from the\r\ninterior. These he called trittyes; and he assigned three of them by\r\nlot to each tribe, in such a way that each should have one portion in\r\neach of these three localities. All who lived in any given deme he\r\ndeclared fellow-demesmen, to the end that the new citizens might not be\r\nexposed by the habitual use of family names, but that men might be\r\nofficially described by the names of their demes; and accordingly it is\r\nby the names of their demes that the Athenians speak of one another. He\r\nalso instituted Demarchs, who had the same duties as the previously\r\nexisting Naucrari,--the demes being made to take the place of the\r\nnaucraries. He gave names to the demes, some from the localities to\r\nwhich they belonged, some from the persons who founded them, since some\r\nof the areas no longer corresponded to localities possessing names. On\r\nthe other hand he allowed every one to retain his family and clan and\r\nreligious rites according to ancestral custom. The names given to the\r\ntribes were the ten which the Pythia appointed out of the hundred\r\nselected national heroes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 22\r\n\r\nBy these reforms the constitution became much more democratic than that\r\nof Solon. The laws of Solon had been obliterated by disuse during the\r\nperiod of the tyranny, while Cleisthenes substituted new ones with the\r\nobject of securing the goodwill of the masses. Among these was the law\r\nconcerning ostracism. Four years after the establishment of this system,\r\nin the archonship of Hermocreon, they first imposed upon the Council of\r\nFive Hundred the oath which they take to the present day.  Next they\r\nbegan to elect the generals by tribes, one from each tribe, while the\r\nPolemarch was the commander of the whole army.  Then, eleven years\r\nlater, in the archonship of Phaenippus they won the battle of Marathon;\r\nand two years after this victory, when the people had now gained\r\nself-confidence, they for the first time made use of the law of\r\nostracism. This had originally been passed as a precaution against men\r\nin high office, because Pisistratus took advantage of his position as a\r\npopular leader and general to make himself tyrant; and the first person\r\nostracized was one of his relatives, Hipparchus son of Charmus, of the\r\ndeme of Collytus, the very person on whose account especially\r\nCleisthenes had enacted the law, as he wished to get rid of him.\r\nHitherto, however, he had escaped; for the Athenians, with the usual\r\nleniency of the democracy, allowed all the partisans of the tyrants,\r\nwho had not joined in their evil deeds in the time of the troubles to\r\nremain in the city; and the chief and leader of these was Hipparchus.\r\nThen in the very next year, in the archonship of Telesinus, they for\r\nthe first time since the tyranny elected, tribe by tribe, the nine\r\nArchons by lot out of the five hundred candidates selected by the\r\ndemes, all the earlier ones having been elected by vote; and in the\r\nsame year Megacles son of Hippocrates, of the deme of Alopece, was\r\nostracized.  Thus for three years they continued to ostracize the\r\nfriends of the tyrants, on whose account the law had been passed; but\r\nin the following year they began to remove others as well, including\r\nany one who seemed to be more powerful than was expedient. The first\r\nperson unconnected with the tyrants who was ostracized was Xanthippus\r\nson of Ariphron. Two years later, in the archonship of Nicodemus, the\r\nmines of Maroneia were discovered, and the state made a profit of a\r\nhundred talents from the working of them. Some persons advised the\r\npeople to make a distribution of the money among themselves, but this\r\nwas prevented by Themistocles. He refused to say on what he proposed to\r\nspend the money, but he bade them lend it to the hundred richest men in\r\nAthens, one talent to each, and then, if the manner in which it was\r\nemployed pleased the people, the expenditure should be charged to the\r\nstate, but otherwise the state should receive the sum back from those\r\nto whom it was lent. On these terms he received the money and with it\r\nhe had a hundred triremes built, each of the hundred individuals\r\nbuilding one; and it was with these ships that they fought the battle\r\nof Salamis against the barbarians. About this time Aristides the son of\r\nLysimachus was ostracized. Three years later, however, in the\r\narchonship of Hypsichides, all the ostracized persons were recalled, on\r\naccount of the advance of the army of Xerxes; and it was laid down for\r\nthe future that persons under sentence of ostracism must live between\r\nGeraestus and Scyllaeum, on pain of losing their civic rights\r\nirrevocably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 23\r\n\r\nSo far, then, had the city progressed by this time, growing gradually\r\nwith the growth of the democracy; but after the Persian wars the\r\nCouncil of Areopagus once more developed strength and assumed the\r\ncontrol of the state. It did not acquire this supremacy by virtue of\r\nany formal decree, but because it had been the cause of the battle of\r\nSalamis being fought. When the generals were utterly at a loss how to\r\nmeet the crisis and made proclamation that every one should see to his\r\nown safety, the Areopagus provided a donation of money, distributing\r\neight drachmas to each member of the ships' crews, and so prevailed on\r\nthem to go on board. On these grounds people bowed to its prestige; and\r\nduring this period Athens was well administered. At this time they\r\ndevoted themselves to the prosecution of the war and were in high\r\nrepute among the Greeks, so that the command by sea was conferred upon\r\nthem, in spite of the opposition of the Lacedaemonians. The leaders of\r\nthe people during this period were Aristides, of Lysimachus, and\r\nThemistocles, son of Lysimachus, and Themistocles, son of Neocles, of\r\nwhom the latter appeared to devote himself to the conduct of war, while\r\nthe former had the reputation of being a clever statesman and the most\r\nupright man of his time. Accordingly the one was usually employed as\r\ngeneral, the other as political adviser. The rebuilding of the\r\nfortifications they conducted in combination, although they were\r\npolitical opponents; but it was Aristides who, seizing the opportunity\r\nafforded by the discredit brought upon the Lacedaemonians by Pausanias,\r\nguided the public policy in the matter of the defection of the Ionian\r\nstates from the alliance with Sparta. It follows that it was he who\r\nmade the first assessment of tribute from the various allied states,\r\ntwo years after the battle of Salamis, in the archonship of\r\nTimosthenes; and it was he who took the oath of offensive and defensive\r\nalliance with the Ionians, on which occasion they cast the masses of\r\niron into the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 24\r\n\r\nAfter this, seeing the state growing in confidence and much wealth\r\naccumulated, he advised the people to lay hold of the leadership of the\r\nleague, and to quit the country districts and settle in the city. He\r\npointed out to them that all would be able to gain a living there, some\r\nby service in the army, others in the garrisons, others by taking a\r\npart in public affairs; and in this way they would secure the\r\nleadership. This advice was taken; and when the people had assumed the\r\nsupreme control they proceeded to treat their allies in a more\r\nimperious fashion, with the exception of the Chians, Lesbians, and\r\nSamians. These they maintained to protect their empire, leaving their\r\nconstitutions untouched, and allowing them to retain whatever dominion\r\nthey then possessed. They also secured an ample maintenance for the\r\nmass of the population in the way which Aristides had pointed out to\r\nthem. Out of the proceeds of the tributes and the taxes and the\r\ncontributions of the allies more than twenty thousand persons were\r\nmaintained. There were 6,000 jurymen, 1,600 bowmen, 1,200 Knights, 500\r\nmembers of the Council, 500 guards of the dockyards, besides fifty\r\nguards in the Acropolis. There were some 700 magistrates at home, and\r\nsome 700 abroad. Further, when they subsequently went to war, there\r\nwere in addition 2,500 heavy-armed troops, twenty guard-ships, and\r\nother ships which collected the tributes, with crews amounting to 2,000\r\nmen, selected by lot; and besides these there were the persons\r\nmaintained at the Prytaneum, and orphans, and gaolers, since all these\r\nwere supported by the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 25\r\n\r\nSuch was the way in which the people earned their livelihood. The\r\nsupremacy of the Areopagus lasted for about seventeen years after the\r\nPersian wars, although gradually declining. But as the strength of the\r\nmasses increased, Ephialtes, son of Sophonides, a man with a reputation\r\nfor incorruptibility and public virtue, who had become the leader of\r\nthe people, made an attack upon that Council. First of all he ruined\r\nmany of its members by bringing actions against them with reference to\r\ntheir administration. Then, in the archonship of Conon, he stripped the\r\nCouncil of all the acquired prerogatives from which it derived its\r\nguardianship of the constitution, and assigned some of them to the\r\nCouncil of Five Hundred, and others to the Assembly and the law-courts.\r\nIn this revolution he was assisted by Themistocles, who was himself a\r\nmember of the Areopagus, but was expecting to be tried before it on a\r\ncharge of treasonable dealings with Persia. This made him anxious that\r\nit should be overthrown, and accordingly he warned Ephialtes that the\r\nCouncil intended to arrest him, while at the same time he informed the\r\nAreopagites that he would reveal to them certain persons who were\r\nconspiring to subvert the constitution. He then conducted the\r\nrepresentatives delegated by the Council to the residence of Ephialtes,\r\npromising to show them the conspirators who assembled there, and\r\nproceeded to converse with them in an earnest manner. Ephialtes, seeing\r\nthis, was seized with alarm and took refuge in suppliant guise at the\r\naltar. Every one was astounded at the occurrence, and presently, when\r\nthe Council of Five Hundred met, Ephialtes and Themistocles together\r\nproceeded to denounce the Areopagus to them. This they repeated in\r\nsimilar fashion in the Assembly, until they succeeded in depriving it\r\nof its power. Not long afterwards, however, Ephialtes was assassinated\r\nby Aristodicus of Tanagra. In this way was the Council of Areopagus\r\ndeprived of its guardianship of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 26\r\n\r\nAfter this revolution the administration of the state became more and\r\nmore lax, in consequence of the eager rivalry of candidates for popular\r\nfavour. During this period the moderate party, as it happened, had no\r\nreal chief, their leader being Cimon son of Miltiades, who was a\r\ncomparatively young man, and had been late in entering public life; and\r\nat the same time the general populace suffered great losses by war. The\r\nsoldiers for active service were selected at that time from the roll of\r\ncitizens, and as the generals were men of no military experience, who\r\nowed their position solely to their family standing, it continually\r\nhappened that some two or three thousand of the troops perished on an\r\nexpedition; and in this way the best men alike of the lower and the\r\nupper classes were exhausted.  Consequently in most matters of\r\nadministration less heed was paid to the laws than had formerly been\r\nthe case. No alteration, however, was made in the method of election of\r\nthe nine Archons, except that five years after the death of Ephialtes\r\nit was decided that the candidates to be submitted to the lot for that\r\noffice might be selected from the Zeugitae as well as from the higher\r\nclasses. The first Archon from that class was Mnesitheides. Up to this\r\ntime all the Archons had been taken from the Pentacosiomedimni and\r\nKnights, while the Zeugitae were confined to the ordinary magistracies,\r\nsave where an evasion of the law was overlooked. Four years later, in\r\nthe archonship of Lysicrates, thirty 'local justices', as they as they\r\nwere called, were re-established; and two years afterwards, in the\r\narchonship of Antidotus, consequence of the great increase in the\r\nnumber of citizens, it was resolved, on the motion of Pericles, that no\r\none should be admitted to the franchise who was not of citizen birth by\r\nboth parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 27\r\n\r\nAfter this Pericles came forward as popular leader, having first\r\ndistinguished himself while still a young man by prosecuting Cimon on\r\nthe audit of his official accounts as general. Under his auspices the\r\nconstitution became still more democratic. He took away some of the\r\nprivileges of the Areopagus, and, above all, he turned the policy of\r\nthe state in the direction of sea power, which caused the masses to\r\nacquire confidence in themselves and consequently to take the conduct\r\nof affairs more and more into their own hands. Moreover, forty-eight\r\nyears after the battle of Salamis, in the archonship of Pythodorus, the\r\nPeloponnesian war broke out, during which the populace was shut up in\r\nthe city and became accustomed to gain its livelihood by military\r\nservice, and so, partly voluntarily and partly involuntarily,\r\ndetermined to assume the administration of the state itself. Pericles\r\nwas also the first to institute pay for service in the law-courts, as a\r\nbid for popular favour to counterbalance the wealth of Cimon. The\r\nlatter, having private possessions on a regal scale, not only performed\r\nthe regular public services magnificently, but also maintained a large\r\nnumber of his fellow-demesmen. Any member of the deme of Laciadae could\r\ngo every day to Cimon's house and there receive a reasonable provision;\r\nwhile his estate was guarded by no fences, so that any one who liked\r\nmight help himself to the fruit from it. Pericles' private property was\r\nquite unequal to this magnificence and accordingly he took the advice\r\nof Damonides of Oia (who was commonly supposed to be the person who\r\nprompted Pericles in most of his measures, and was therefore\r\nsubsequently ostracized), which was that, as he was beaten in the\r\nmatter of private possessions, he should make gifts to the people from\r\ntheir own property; and accordingly he instituted pay for the members\r\nof the juries. Some critics accuse him of thereby causing a\r\ndeterioration in the character of the juries, since it was always the\r\ncommon people who put themselves forward for selection as jurors,\r\nrather than the men of better position. Moreover, bribery came into\r\nexistence after this, the first person to introduce it being Anytus,\r\nafter his command at Pylos.  He was prosecuted by certain individuals\r\non account of his loss of Pylos, but escaped by bribing the jury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 28\r\n\r\nSo long, however, as Pericles was leader of the people, things went\r\ntolerably well with the state; but when he was dead there was a great\r\nchange for the worse. Then for the first time did the people choose a\r\nleader who was of no reputation among men of good standing, whereas up\r\nto this time such men had always been found as leaders of the\r\ndemocracy. The first leader of the people, in the very beginning of\r\nthings, was Solon, and the second was Pisistratus, both of them men of\r\nbirth and position. After the overthrow of the tyrants there was\r\nCleisthenes, a member of the house of the Alcmeonidae; and he had no\r\nrival opposed to him after the expulsion of the party of Isagoras.\r\nAfter this Xanthippus was the leader of the people, and Miltiades of\r\nthe upper class. Then came Themistocles and Aristides, and after them\r\nEphialtes as leader of the people, and Cimon son of Miltiades of the\r\nwealthier class. Pericles followed as leader of the people, and\r\nThucydides, who was connected by marriage with Cimon, of the\r\nopposition. After the death of Pericles, Nicias, who subsequently fell\r\nin Sicily, appeared as leader of the aristocracy, and Cleon son of\r\nCleaenetus of the people. The latter seems, more than any one else, to\r\nhave been the cause of the corruption of the democracy by his wild\r\nundertakings; and he was the first to use unseemly shouting and coarse\r\nabuse on the Bema, and to harangue the people with his cloak girt up\r\nshort about him, whereas all his predecessors had spoken decently and\r\nin order. These were succeeded by Theramenes son of Hagnon as leader of\r\nthe one party, and the lyre-maker Cleophon of the people. It was\r\nCleophon who first granted the two-obol donation for the theatrical\r\nperformances, and for some time it continued to be given; but then\r\nCallicrates of Paeania ousted him by promising to add a third obol to\r\nthe sum. Both of these persons were subsequently condemned to death;\r\nfor the people, even if they are deceived for a time, in the end\r\ngenerally come to detest those who have beguiled them into any unworthy\r\naction. After Cleophon the popular leadership was occupied successively\r\nby the men who chose to talk the biggest and pander the most to the\r\ntastes of the majority, with their eyes fixed only on the interests of\r\nthe moment. The best statesmen at Athens, after those of early times,\r\nseem to have been Nicias, Thucydides, and Theramenes. As to Nicias and\r\nThucydides, nearly every one agrees that they were not merely men of\r\nbirth and character, but also statesmen, and that they ruled the state\r\nwith paternal care. On the merits of Theramenes opinion is divided,\r\nbecause it so happened that in his time public affairs were in a very\r\nstormy state. But those who give their opinion deliberately find him,\r\nnot, as his critics falsely assert, overthrowing every kind of\r\nconstitution, but supporting every kind so long as it did not\r\ntransgress laws; thus showing that he was able, as every good citizen\r\nshould be, to live under any form of constitution, while he refused to\r\ncountenance illegality and was its constant enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 29\r\n\r\nSo long as the fortune of the war continued even, the Athenians\r\npreserved the democracy; but after the disaster in Sicily, when the\r\nLacedaemonians had gained the upper hand through their alliance with\r\nthe king of Persia, they were compelled to abolish the democracy and\r\nestablish in its place the constitution of the Four Hundred. The speech\r\nrecommending this course before the vote was made by Melobius, and the\r\nmotion was proposed by Pythodorus of Anaphlystus; but the real argument\r\nwhich persuaded the majority was the belief that the king of Persia was\r\nmore likely to form an alliance with them if the constitution were on\r\nan oligarchical basis. The motion of Pythodorus was to the following\r\neffect. The popular Assembly was to elect twenty persons, over forty\r\nyears of age, who, in conjunction with the existing ten members of the\r\nCommittee of Public Safety, after taking an oath that they would frame\r\nsuch measures as they thought best for the state, should then prepare\r\nproposals for the public safety. In addition, any other person might\r\nmake proposals, so that of all the schemes before them the people might\r\nchoose the best.  Cleitophon concurred with the motion of Pythodorus,\r\nbut moved that the committee should also investigate the ancient laws\r\nenacted by Cleisthenes when he created the democracy, in order that\r\nthey might have these too before them and so be in a position to decide\r\nwisely; his suggestion being that the constitution of Cleisthenes was\r\nnot really democratic, but closely akin to that of Solon. When the\r\ncommittee was elected, their first proposal was that the Prytanes\r\nshould be compelled to put to the vote any motion that was offered on\r\nbehalf of the public safety. Next they abolished all indictments for\r\nillegal proposals, all impeachments and pubic prosecutions, in order\r\nthat every Athenian should be free to give his counsel on the\r\nsituation, if he chose; and they decreed that if any person imposed a\r\nfine on any other for his acts in this respect, or prosecuted him or\r\nsummoned him before the courts, he should, on an information being laid\r\nagainst him, be summarily arrested and brought before the generals, who\r\nshould deliver him to the Eleven to be put to death.  After these\r\npreliminary measures, they drew up the constitution in the following\r\nmanner. The revenues of the state were not to be spent on any purpose\r\nexcept the war. All magistrates should serve without remuneration for\r\nthe period of the war, except the nine Archons and the Prytanes for the\r\ntime being, who should each receive three obols a day. The whole of the\r\nrest of the administration was to be committed, for the period of the\r\nwar, to those Athenians who were most capable of serving the state\r\npersonally or pecuniarily, to the number of not less than five\r\nthousand. This body was to have full powers, to the extent even of\r\nmaking treaties with whomsoever they willed; and ten representatives,\r\nover forty years of age, were to be elected from each tribe to draw up\r\nthe list of the Five Thousand, after taking an oath on a full and\r\nperfect sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 30\r\n\r\nThese were the recommendations of the committee; and when they had been\r\nratified the Five Thousand elected from their own number a hundred\r\ncommissioners to draw up the constitution. They, on their appointment,\r\ndrew up and produced the following recommendations. There should be a\r\nCouncil, holding office for a year, consisting of men over thirty years\r\nof age, serving without pay. To this body should belong the Generals,\r\nthe nine Archons, the Amphictyonic Registrar (Hieromnemon), the\r\nTaxiarchs, the Hipparchs, the Phylarch, the commanders of garrisons,\r\nthe Treasurers of Athena and the other gods, ten in number, the\r\nHellenic Treasurers (Hellenotamiae), the Treasurers of the other\r\nnon-sacred moneys, to the number of twenty, the ten Commissioners of\r\nSacrifices (Hieropoei), and the ten Superintendents of the mysteries.\r\nAll these were to be appointed by the Council from a larger number of\r\nselected candidates, chosen from its members for the time being. The\r\nother offices were all to be filled by lot, and not from the members of\r\nthe Council. The Hellenic Treasurers who actually administered the\r\nfunds should not sit with the Council. As regards the future, four\r\nCouncils were to be created, of men of the age already mentioned, and\r\none of these was to be chosen by lot to take office at once, while the\r\nothers were to receive it in turn, in the order decided by the lot. For\r\nthis purpose the hundred commissioners were to distribute themselves\r\nand all the rest as equally as possible into four parts, and cast lots\r\nfor precedence, and the selected body should hold office for a year.\r\nThey were to administer that office as seemed to them best, both with\r\nreference to the safe custody and due expenditure of the finances, and\r\ngenerally with regard to all other matters to the best of their\r\nability. If they desired to take a larger number of persons into\r\ncounsel, each member might call in one assistant of his own choice,\r\nsubject to the same qualification of age. The Council was to sit once\r\nevery five days, unless there was any special need for more frequent\r\nsittings. The casting of the lot for the Council was to be held by the\r\nnine Archons; votes on divisions were to be counted by five tellers\r\nchosen by lot from the members of the Council, and of these one was to\r\nbe selected by lot every day to act as president. These five persons\r\nwere to cast lots for precedence between the parties wishing to appear\r\nbefore the Council, giving the first place to sacred matters, the\r\nsecond to heralds, the third to embassies, and the fourth to all other\r\nsubjects; but matters concerning the war might be dealt with, on the\r\nmotion of the generals, whenever there was need, without balloting.\r\nAny member of the Council who did not enter the Council-house at the\r\ntime named should be fined a drachma for each day, unless he was away\r\non leave of absence from the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 31\r\n\r\nSuch was the constitution which they drew up for the time to come, but\r\nfor the immediate present they devised the following scheme. There\r\nshould be a Council of Four Hundred, as in the ancient constitution,\r\nforty from each tribe, chosen out of candidates of more than thirty\r\nyears of age, selected by the members of the tribes. This Council\r\nshould appoint the magistrates and draw up the form of oath which they\r\nwere to take; and in all that concerned the laws, in the examination of\r\nofficial accounts, and in other matters generally, they might act\r\naccording to their discretion. They must, however, observe the laws\r\nthat might be enacted with reference to the constitution of the state,\r\nand had no power to alter them nor to pass others. The generals should\r\nbe provisionally elected from the whole body of the Five Thousand, but\r\nso soon as the Council came into existence it was to hold an\r\nexamination of military equipments, and thereon elect ten persons,\r\ntogether with a secretary, and the persons thus elected should hold\r\noffice during the coming year with full powers, and should have the\r\nright, whenever they desired it, of joining in the deliberations of the\r\nCouncil. The Five thousand was also to elect a single Hipparch and ten\r\nPhylarchs; but for the future the Council was to elect these officers\r\naccording to the regulations above laid down. No office, except those\r\nof member of the Council and of general, might be held more than once,\r\neither by the first occupants or by their successors. With reference to\r\nthe future distribution of the Four Hundred into the four successive\r\nsections, the hundred commissioners must divide them whenever the time\r\ncomes for the citizens to join in the Council along with the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 32\r\n\r\nThe hundred commissioners appointed by the Five Thousand drew up the\r\nconstitution as just stated; and after it had been ratified by the\r\npeople, under the presidency of Aristomachus, the existing Council,\r\nthat of the year of Callias, was dissolved before it had completed its\r\nterm of office. It was dissolved on the fourteenth day of the month\r\nThargelion, and the Four Hundred entered into office on the\r\ntwenty-first; whereas the regular Council, elected by lot, ought to\r\nhave entered into office on the fourteenth of Scirophorion. Thus was\r\nthe oligarchy established, in the archonship of Callias, just about a\r\nhundred years after the expulsion of the tyrants. The chief promoters\r\nof the revolution were Pisander, Antiphon, and Theramenes, all of them\r\nmen of good birth and with high reputations for ability and judgement.\r\nWhen, however, this constitution had been established, the Five\r\nThousand were only nominally selected, and the Four Hundred, together\r\nwith the ten officers on whom full powers had been conferred, occupied\r\nthe Council-house and really administered the government. They began by\r\nsending ambassadors to the Lacedaemonians proposing a cessation of the\r\nwar on the basis of the existing position; but as the Lacedaemonians\r\nrefused to listen to them unless they would also abandon the command of\r\nthe sea, they broke off the negotiations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 33\r\n\r\nFor about four months the constitution of the Four Hundred lasted, and\r\nMnasilochus held office as Archon of their nomination for two months of\r\nthe year of Theopompus, who was Archon for the remaining ten. On the\r\nloss of the naval battle of Eretria, however, and the revolt of the\r\nwhole of Euboea except Oreum, the indignation of the people was greater\r\nthan at any of the earlier disasters, since they drew far more supplies\r\nat this time from Euboea than from Attica itself. Accordingly they\r\ndeposed the Four Hundred and committed the management of affairs to the\r\nFive Thousand, consisting of persons possessing a military equipment.\r\nAt the same time they voted that pay should not be given for any public\r\noffice. The persons chiefly responsible for the revolution were\r\nAristocrates and Theramenes, who disapproved of the action of the Four\r\nHundred in retaining the direction of affairs entirely in their own\r\nhands, and referring nothing to the Five Thousand. During this period\r\nthe constitution of the state seems to have been admirable, since it\r\nwas a time of war and the franchise was in the hands of those who\r\npossessed a military equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 34\r\n\r\nThe people, however, in a very short time deprived the Five Thousand of\r\ntheir monopoly of the government. Then, six years after the overthrow\r\nof the Four Hundred, in the archonship of Callias of Angele, the battle\r\nof Arginusae took place, of which the results were, first, that the ten\r\ngenerals who had gained the victory were all condemned by a single\r\ndecision, owing to the people being led astray by persons who aroused\r\ntheir indignation; though, as a matter of fact, some of the generals\r\nhad actually taken no part in the battle, and others were themselves\r\npicked up by other vessels. Secondly, when the Lacedaemonians proposed\r\nto evacuate Decelea and make peace on the basis of the existing\r\nposition, although some of the Athenians supported this proposal, the\r\nmajority refused to listen to them. In this they were led astray by\r\nCleophon, who appeared in the Assembly drunk and wearing his\r\nbreastplate, and prevented peace being made, declaring that he would\r\nnever accept peace unless the Lacedaemonians abandoned their claims on\r\nall the cities allied with them. They mismanaged their opportunity\r\nthen, and in a very short time they learnt their mistake. The next\r\nyear, in the archonship of Alexias, they suffered the disaster of\r\nAegospotami, the consequence of which was that Lysander became master\r\nof the city, and set up the Thirty as its governors. He did so in the\r\nfollowing manner. One of the terms of peace stipulated that the state\r\nshould be governed according to 'the ancient constitution'. Accordingly\r\nthe popular party tried to preserve the democracy, while that part of\r\nthe upper class which belonged to the political clubs, together with\r\nthe exiles who had returned since the peace, aimed at an oligarchy, and\r\nthose who were not members of any club, though in other respects they\r\nconsidered themselves as good as any other citizens, were anxious to\r\nrestore the ancient constitution. The latter class included Archinus,\r\nAnytus, Cleitophon, Phormisius, and many others, but their most\r\nprominent leader was Theramenes. Lysander, however, threw his influence\r\non the side of the oligarchical party, and the popular Assembly was\r\ncompelled by sheer intimidation to pass a vote establishing the\r\noligarchy. The motion to this effect was proposed by Dracontides of\r\nAphidna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 35\r\n\r\nIn this way were the Thirty established in power, in the archonship of\r\nPythodorus. As soon, however, as they were masters of the city, they\r\nignored all the resolutions which had been passed relating to the\r\norganization of the constitution, but after appointing a Council of\r\nFive Hundred and the other magistrates out of a thousand selected\r\ncandidates, and associating with themselves ten Archons in Piraeus,\r\neleven superintendents of the prison, and three hundred 'lash-bearers'\r\nas attendants, with the help of these they kept the city under their\r\nown control. At first, indeed, they behaved with moderation towards the\r\ncitizens and pretended to administer the state according to the ancient\r\nconstitution. In pursuance of this policy they took down from the hill\r\nof Areopagus the laws of Ephialtes and Archestratus relating to the\r\nAreopagite Council; they also repealed such of the statutes of Solon as\r\nwere obscure, and abolished the supreme power of the law-courts. In\r\nthis they claimed to be restoring the constitution and freeing it from\r\nobscurities; as, for instance, by making the testator free once for all\r\nto leave his property as he pleased, and abolishing the existing\r\nlimitations in cases of insanity, old age, and undue female influence,\r\nin order that no opening might be left for professional accusers. In\r\nother matters also their conduct was similar. At first, then, they\r\nacted on these lines, and they destroyed the professional accusers and\r\nthose mischievous and evil-minded persons who, to the great detriment\r\nof the democracy, had attached themselves to it in order to curry\r\nfavour with it. With all of this the city was much pleased, and thought\r\nthat the Thirty were doing it with the best of motives. But so soon as\r\nthey had got a firmer hold on the city, they spared no class of\r\ncitizens, but put to death any persons who were eminent for wealth or\r\nbirth or character. Herein they aimed at removing all whom they had\r\nreason to fear, while they also wished to lay hands on their\r\npossessions; and in a short time they put to death not less than\r\nfifteen hundred persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 36\r\n\r\nTheramenes, however, seeing the city thus falling into ruin, was\r\ndispleased with their proceedings, and counselled them to cease such\r\nunprincipled conduct and let the better classes have a share in the\r\ngovernment. At first they resisted his advice, but when his proposals\r\ncame to be known abroad, and the masses began to associate themselves\r\nwith him, they were seized with alarm lest he should make himself the\r\nleader of the people and destroy their despotic power.  Accordingly\r\nthey drew up a list of three thousand citizens, to whom they announced\r\nthat they would give a share in the constitution.  Theramenes, however,\r\ncriticized this scheme also, first on the ground that, while proposing\r\nto give all respectable citizens a share in the constitution, they were\r\nactually giving it only to three thousand persons, as though all merit\r\nwere confined within that number; and secondly because they were doing\r\ntwo inconsistent things, since they made the government rest on the\r\nbasis of force, and yet made the governors inferior in strength to the\r\ngoverned.  However, they took no notice of his criticisms, and for a\r\nlong time put off the publication of the list of the Three Thousand and\r\nkept to themselves the names of those who had been placed upon it; and\r\nevery time they did decide to publish it they proceeded to strike out\r\nsome of those who had been included in it, and insert others who had\r\nbeen omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 37\r\n\r\nNow when winter had set in, Thrasybulus and the exiles occupied Phyle,\r\nand the force which the Thirty led out to attack them met with a\r\nreverse. Thereupon the Thirty decided to disarm the bulk of the\r\npopulation and to get rid of Theramenes; which they did in the\r\nfollowing way. They introduced two laws into the Council, which they\r\ncommanded it to pass; the first of them gave the Thirty absolute power\r\nto put to death any citizen who was not included in the list of the\r\nThree Thousand, while the second disqualified all persons from\r\nparticipation in the franchise who should have assisted in the\r\ndemolition of the fort of Eetioneia, or have acted in any way against\r\nthe Four Hundred who had organized the previous oligarchy.  Theramenes\r\nhad done both, and accordingly, when these laws were ratified, he\r\nbecame excluded from the franchise and the Thirty had full power to put\r\nhim to death. Theramenes having been thus removed, they disarmed all\r\nthe people except the Three Thousand, and in every respect showed a\r\ngreat advance in cruelty and crime. They also sent ambassadors to\r\nLacedaemonian to blacken the character of Theramenes and to ask for\r\nhelp; and the Lacedaemonians, in answer to their appeal, sent Callibius\r\nas military governor with about seven hundred troops, who came and\r\noccupied the Acropolis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 38\r\n\r\nThese events were followed by the occupation of Munichia by the exiles\r\nfrom Phyle, and their victory over the Thirty and their partisans.\r\nAfter the fight the party of the city retreated, and next day they held\r\na meeting in the marketplace and deposed the Thirty, and elected ten\r\ncitizens with full powers to bring the war to a termination. When,\r\nhowever, the Ten had taken over the government they did nothing towards\r\nthe object for which they were elected, but sent envoys to\r\nLacedaemonian to ask for help and to borrow money.  Further, finding\r\nthat the citizens who possessed the franchise were displeased at their\r\nproceedings, they were afraid lest they should be deposed, and\r\nconsequently, in order to strike terror into them (in which design they\r\nsucceeded), they arrested Demaretus, one of the most eminent citizens,\r\nand put him to death. This gave them a firm hold on the government, and\r\nthey also had the support of Callibius and his Peloponnesians, together\r\nwith several of the Knights; for some of the members of this class were\r\nthe most zealous among the citizens to prevent the return of the exiles\r\nfrom Phyle. When, however, the party in Piraeus and Munichia began to\r\ngain the upper hand in the war, through the defection of the whole\r\npopulace to them, the party in the city deposed the original Ten, and\r\nelected another Ten, consisting of men of the highest repute. Under\r\ntheir administration, and with their active and zealous cooperation,\r\nthe treaty of reconciliation was made and the populace returned to the\r\ncity. The most prominent members of this board were Rhinon of Paeania\r\nand Phayllus of Acherdus, who, even before the arrival of Pausanias,\r\nopened negotiations with the party in Piraeus, and after his arrival\r\nseconded his efforts to bring about the return of the exiles. For it\r\nwas Pausanias, the king of the Lacedaemonians, who brought the peace\r\nand reconciliation to a fulfillment, in conjunction with the ten\r\ncommissioners of arbitration who arrived later from Lacedaemonian, at\r\nhis own earnest request. Rhinon and his colleagues received a vote of\r\nthanks for the goodwill shown by them to the people, and though they\r\nreceived their charge under an oligarchy and handed in their accounts\r\nunder a democracy, no one, either of the party that had stayed in the\r\ncity or of the exiles that had returned from the Piraeus, brought any\r\ncomplaint against them. On the contrary, Rhinon was immediately elected\r\ngeneral on account of his conduct in this office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 39\r\n\r\nThis reconciliation was effected in the archonship of Eucleides, on the\r\nfollowing terms. All persons who, having remained in the city during\r\nthe troubles, were now anxious to leave it, were to be free to settle\r\nat Eleusis, retaining their civil rights and possessing full and\r\nindependent powers of self-government, and with the free enjoyment of\r\ntheir own personal property. The temple at Eleusis should be common\r\nground for both parties, and should be under the superintendence of the\r\nCeryces, and the Eumolpidae, according to primitive custom. The\r\nsettlers at Eleusis should not be allowed to enter Athens, nor the\r\npeople of Athens to enter Eleusis, except at the season of the\r\nmysteries, when both parties should be free from these restrictions.\r\nThe secessionists should pay their share to the fund for the common\r\ndefence out of their revenues, just like all the other Athenians. If\r\nany of the seceding party wished to take a house in Eleusis, the people\r\nwould help them to obtain the consent of the owner; but if they could\r\nnot come to terms, they should appoint three valuers on either side,\r\nand the owner should receive whatever price they should appoint.  Of\r\nthe inhabitants of Eleusis, those whom the secessionists wished to\r\nremain should be allowed to do so. The list of those who desired to\r\nsecede should be made up within ten days after the taking of the oaths\r\nin the case of persons already in the country, and their actual\r\ndeparture should take place within twenty days; persons at present out\r\nof the country should have the same terms allowed to them after their\r\nreturn. No one who settled at Eleusis should be capable of holding any\r\noffice in Athens until he should again register himself on the roll as\r\na resident in the city. Trials for homicide, including all cases in\r\nwhich one party had either killed or wounded another, should be\r\nconducted according to ancestral practice. There should be a general\r\namnesty concerning past events towards all persons except the Thirty,\r\nthe Ten, the Eleven, and the magistrates in Piraeus; and these too\r\nshould be included if they should submit their accounts in the usual\r\nway. Such accounts should be given by the magistrates in Piraeus before\r\na court of citizens rated in Piraeus, and by the magistrates in the\r\ncity before a court of those rated in the city.  On these terms those\r\nwho wished to do so might secede. Each party was to repay separately\r\nthe money which it had borrowed for the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 40\r\n\r\nWhen the reconciliation had taken place on these terms, those who had\r\nfought on the side of the Thirty felt considerable apprehensions, and a\r\nlarge number intended to secede. But as they put off entering their\r\nnames till the last moment, as people will do, Archinus, observing\r\ntheir numbers, and being anxious to retain them as citizens, cut off\r\nthe remaining days during which the list should have remained open; and\r\nin this way many persons were compelled to remain, though they did so\r\nvery unwillingly until they recovered confidence. This is one point in\r\nwhich Archinus appears to have acted in a most statesmanlike manner,\r\nand another was his subsequent prosecution of Thrasybulus on the charge\r\nof illegality, for a motion by which he proposed to confer the\r\nfranchise on all who had taken part in the return from Piraeus,\r\nalthough some of them were notoriously slaves. And yet a third such\r\naction was when one of the returned exiles began to violate the\r\namnesty, whereupon Archinus haled him to the Council and persuaded them\r\nto execute him without trial, telling them that now they would have to\r\nshow whether they wished to preserve the democracy and abide by the\r\noaths they had taken; for if they let this man escape they would\r\nencourage others to imitate him, while if they executed him they would\r\nmake an example for all to learn by. And this was exactly what\r\nhappened; for after this man had been put to death no one ever again\r\nbroke the amnesty. On the contrary, the Athenians seem, both in public\r\nand in private, to have behaved in the most unprecedentedly admirable\r\nand public-spirited way with reference to the preceding troubles. Not\r\nonly did they blot out all memory of former offences, but they even\r\nrepaid to the Lacedaemonians out of the public purse the money which\r\nthe Thirty had borrowed for the war, although the treaty required each\r\nparty, the party of the city and the party of Piraeus, to pay its own\r\ndebts separately. This they did because they thought it was a necessary\r\nfirst step in the direction of restoring harmony; but in other states,\r\nso far from the democratic parties making advances from their own\r\npossessions, they are rather in the habit of making a general\r\nredistribution of the land. A final reconciliation was made with the\r\nsecessionists at Eleusis two years after the secession, in the\r\narchonship of Xenaenetus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 41\r\n\r\nThis, however, took place at a later date; at the time of which we are\r\nspeaking the people, having secured the control of the state,\r\nestablished the constitution which exists at the present day.\r\nPythodorus was Archon at the time, but the democracy seems to have\r\nassumed the supreme power with perfect justice, since it had effected\r\nits own return by its own exertions. This was the eleventh change which\r\nhad taken place in the constitution of Athens. The first modification\r\nof the primaeval condition of things was when Ion and his companions\r\nbrought the people together into a community, for then the people was\r\nfirst divided into the four tribes, and the tribe-kings were created.\r\nNext, and first after this, having now some semblance of a\r\nconstitution, was that which took place in the reign of Theseus,\r\nconsisting in a slight deviation from absolute monarchy. After this\r\ncame the constitution formed under Draco, when the first code of laws\r\nwas drawn up. The third was that which followed the civil war, in the\r\ntime of Solon; from this the democracy took its rise. The fourth was\r\nthe tyranny of Pisistratus; the fifth the constitution of Cleisthenes,\r\nafter the overthrow of the tyrants, of a more democratic character than\r\nthat of Solon. The sixth was that which followed on the Persian wars,\r\nwhen the Council of Areopagus had the direction of the state. The\r\nseventh, succeeding this, was the constitution which Aristides sketched\r\nout, and which Ephialtes brought to completion by overthrowing the\r\nAreopagite Council; under this the nation, misled by the demagogues,\r\nmade the most serious mistakes in the interest of its maritime empire.\r\nThe eighth was the establishment of the Four Hundred, followed by the\r\nninth, the restored democracy. The tenth was the tyranny of the Thirty\r\nand the Ten. The eleventh was that which followed the return from Phyle\r\nand Piraeus; and this has continued from that day to this, with\r\ncontinual accretions of power to the masses. The democracy has made\r\nitself master of everything and administers everything by its votes in\r\nthe Assembly and by the law-courts, in which it holds the supreme\r\npower.  Even the jurisdiction of the Council has passed into the hands\r\nof the people at large; and this appears to be a judicious change,\r\nsince small bodies are more open to corruption, whether by actual money\r\nor influence, than large ones. At first they refused to allow payment\r\nfor attendance at the Assembly; but the result was that people did not\r\nattend. Consequently, after the Prytanes had tried many devices in vain\r\nin order to induce the populace to come and ratify the votes,\r\nAgyrrhius, in the first instance, made a provision of one obol a day,\r\nwhich Heracleides of Clazomenae, nicknamed 'the king', increased to two\r\nobols, and Agyrrhius again to three.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 42\r\n\r\nThe present state of the constitution is as follows. The franchise is\r\nopen to all who are of citizen birth by both parents. They are enrolled\r\namong the demesmen at the age of eighteen. On the occasion of their\r\nenrollment the demesmen give their votes on oath, first whether the\r\ncandidates appear to be of the age prescribed by the law (if not, they\r\nare dismissed back into the ranks of the boys), and secondly whether\r\nthe candidate is free born and of such parentage as the laws require.\r\nThen if they decide that he is not a free man, he appeals to the\r\nlaw-courts, and the demesmen appoint five of their own number to act as\r\naccusers; if the court decides that he has no right to be enrolled, he\r\nis sold by the state as a slave, but if he wins his case he has a right\r\nto be enrolled among the demesmen without further question. After this\r\nthe Council examines those who have been enrolled, and if it comes to\r\nthe conclusion that any of them is less than eighteen years of age, it\r\nfines the demesmen who enrolled him. When the youths (Ephebi) have\r\npassed this examination, their fathers meet by their tribes, and\r\nappoint on oath three of their fellow tribesmen, over forty years of\r\nage, who, in their opinion, are the best and most suitable persons to\r\nhave charge of the youths; and of these the Assembly elects one from\r\neach tribe as guardian, together with a director, chosen from the\r\ngeneral body of Athenians, to control the while. Under the charge of\r\nthese persons the youths first of all make the circuit of the temples;\r\nthen they proceed to Piraeus, and some of them garrison Munichia and\r\nsome the south shore. The Assembly also elects two trainers, with\r\nsubordinate instructors, who teach them to fight in heavy armour, to\r\nuse the bow and javelin, and to discharge a catapult. The guardians\r\nreceive from the state a drachma apiece for their keep, and the youths\r\nfour obols apiece. Each guardian receives the allowance for all the\r\nmembers of his tribe and buys the necessary provisions for the common\r\nstock (they mess together by tribes), and generally superintends\r\neverything. In this way they spend the first year. The next year, after\r\ngiving a public display of their military evolutions, on the occasion\r\nwhen the Assembly meets in the theatre, they receive a shield and spear\r\nfrom the state; after which they patrol the country and spend their\r\ntime in the forts. For these two years they are on garrison duty, and\r\nwear the military cloak, and during this time they are exempt from all\r\ntaxes. They also can neither bring an action at law, nor have one\r\nbrought against them, in order that they may have no excuse for\r\nrequiring leave of absence; though exception is made in cases of\r\nactions concerning inheritances and wards of state, or of any\r\nsacrificial ceremony connected with the family. When the two years have\r\nelapsed they thereupon take their position among the other citizens.\r\nSuch is the manner of the enrollment of the citizens and the training\r\nof the youths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 43\r\n\r\nAll the magistrates that are concerned with the ordinary routine of\r\nadministration are elected by lot, except the Military Treasurer, the\r\nCommissioners of the Theoric fund, and the Superintendent of Springs.\r\nThese are elected by vote, and hold office from one Panathenaic\r\nfestival to the next. All military officers are also elected by vote.\r\n\r\n The Council of Five Hundred is elected by lot, fifty from each\r\ntribe. Each tribe holds the office of Prytanes in turn, the order being\r\ndetermined by lot; the first four serve for thirty-six days each, the\r\nlast six for thirty-five, since the reckoning is by lunar years. The\r\nPrytanes for the time being, in the first place, mess together in the\r\nTholus, and receive a sum of money from the state for their\r\nmaintenance; and, secondly, they convene the meetings of the Council\r\nand the Assembly. The Council they convene every day, unless it is a\r\nholiday, the Assembly four times in each prytany. It is also their duty\r\nto draw up the programme of the business of the Council and to decide\r\nwhat subjects are to be dealt with on each particular day, and where the\r\nsitting is to be held. They also draw up the programme for the meetings\r\nof the Assembly. One of these in each prytany is called the 'sovereign'\r\nAssembly; in this the people have to ratify the continuance of the\r\nmagistrates in office, if they are performing their duties properly,\r\nand to consider the supply of corn and the defence of the country. On\r\nthis day, too, impeachments are introduced by those who wish to do so,\r\nthe lists of property confiscated by the state are read, and also\r\napplications for inheritances and wards of state, so that nothing may\r\npass unclaimed without the cognizance of any person concerned. In the\r\nsixth prytany, in addition to the business already stated, the question\r\nis put to the vote whether it is desirable to hold a vote of ostracism\r\nor not; and complaints against professional accusers, whether Athenian\r\nor aliens domiciled in Athens, are received, to the number of not more\r\nthan three of either class, together with cases in which an individual\r\nhas made some promise to the people and has not performed it. Another\r\nAssembly in each prytany is assigned to the hearing of petitions, and\r\nat this meeting any one is free, on depositing the petitioner's\r\nolive-branch, to speak to the people concerning any matter, public or\r\nprivate. The two remaining meetings are devoted to all other subjects,\r\nand the laws require them to deal with three questions connected with\r\nreligion, three connected with heralds and embassies, and three on\r\nsecular subjects. Sometimes questions are brought forward without a\r\npreliminary vote of the Assembly to take them into consideration.\r\n\r\nHeralds and envoys appear first before the Prytanes, and the bearers of\r\ndispatches also deliver them to the same officials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 44\r\n\r\nThere is a single President of the Prytanes, elected by lot, who\r\npresides for a night and a day; he may not hold the office for more\r\nthan that time, nor may the same individual hold it twice. He keeps the\r\nkeys of the sanctuaries in which the treasures and public records of\r\nthe state are preserved, and also the public seal; and he is bound to\r\nremain in the Tholus, together with one-third of the Prytanes, named by\r\nhimself. Whenever the Prytanes convene a meeting of the Council or\r\nAssembly, he appoints by lot nine Proedri, one from each tribe except\r\nthat which holds the office of Prytanes for the time being; and out of\r\nthese nine he similarly appoints one as President, and hands over the\r\nprogramme for the meeting to them. They take it and see to the\r\npreservation of order, put forward the various subjects which are to be\r\nconsidered, decide the results of the votings, and direct the\r\nproceedings generally. They also have power to dismiss the meeting. No\r\none may act as President more than once in the year, but he may be a\r\nProedrus once in each prytany.\r\n\r\nElections to the offices of General and Hipparch and all other military\r\ncommands are held in the Assembly, in such manner as the people decide;\r\nthey are held after the sixth prytany by the first board of Prytanes in\r\nwhose term of office the omens are favourable.  There has, however, to\r\nbe a preliminary consideration by the Council in this case also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 45\r\n\r\nIn former times the Council had full powers to inflict fines and\r\nimprisonment and death; but when it had consigned Lysimachus to the\r\nexecutioner, and he was sitting in the immediate expectation of death,\r\nEumelides of Alopece rescued him from its hands, maintaining that no\r\ncitizen ought to be put to death except on the decision of a court of\r\nlaw. Accordingly a trial was held in a law-court, and Lysimachus was\r\nacquitted, receiving henceforth the nickname of 'the man from the\r\ndrum-head'; and the people deprived the Council thenceforward of the\r\npower to inflict death or imprisonment or fine, passing a law that if\r\nthe Council condemn any person for an offence or inflict a fine, the\r\nThesmothetae shall bring the sentence or fine before the law-court, and\r\nthe decision of the jurors shall be the final judgement in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe Council passes judgement on nearly all magistrates, especially\r\nthose who have the control of money; its judgement, however, is not\r\nfinal, but is subject to an appeal to the lawcourts. Private\r\nindividuals, also, may lay an information against any magistrate they\r\nplease for not obeying the laws, but here too there is an appeal to the\r\nlaw-courts if the Council declare the charge proved. The Council also\r\nexamines those who are to be its members for the ensuing year, and\r\nlikewise the nine Archons. Formerly the Council had full power to\r\nreject candidates for office as unsuitable, but now they have an appeal\r\nto the law-courts. In all these matters, therefore, the Council has no\r\nfinal jurisdiction. It takes, however, preliminary cognizance of all\r\nmatters brought before the Assembly, and the Assembly cannot vote on\r\nany question unless it has first been considered by the Council and\r\nplaced on the programme by the Prytanes; since a person who carries a\r\nmotion in the Assembly is liable to an action for illegal proposal on\r\nthese grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 46\r\n\r\nThe Council also superintends the triremes that are already in\r\nexistence, with their tackle and sheds, and builds new triremes or\r\nquadriremes, whichever the Assembly votes, with tackle and sheds to\r\nmatch. The Assembly appoints master-builders for the ships by vote; and\r\nif they do not hand them over completed to the next Council, the old\r\nCouncil cannot receive the customary donation--that being normally\r\ngiven to it during its successor's term of office. For the building of\r\nthe triremes it appoints ten commissioners, chosen from its own\r\nmembers. The Council also inspects all public buildings, and if it is\r\nof opinion that the state is being defrauded, it reports the culprit to\r\nthe Assembly, and on condemnation hands him over to the law-courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 47\r\n\r\nThe Council also co-operates with other magistrates in most of their\r\nduties. First there are the treasurers of Athena, ten in number,\r\nelected by lot, one from each tribe. According to the law of\r\nSolon--which is still in force--they must be Pentacosiomedimni, but in\r\npoint of fact the person on whom the lot falls holds the office even\r\nthough he be quite a poor man. These officers take over charge of the\r\nstatue of Athena, the figures of Victory, and all the other ornaments\r\nof the temple, together with the money, in the presence of the Council.\r\nThen there are the Commissioners for Public Contracts (Poletae), ten in\r\nnumber, one chosen by lot from each tribe, who farm out the public\r\ncontracts. They lease the mines and taxes, in conjunction with the\r\nMilitary Treasurer and the Commissioners of the Theoric fund, in the\r\npresence of the Council, and grant, to the persons indicated by the\r\nvote of the Council, the mines which are let out by the state,\r\nincluding both the workable ones, which are let for three years, and\r\nthose which are let under special agreements years. They also sell, in\r\nthe presence of the Council, the property of those who have gone into\r\nexile from the court of the Areopagus, and of others whose goods have\r\nbeen confiscated, and the nine Archons ratify the contracts. They also\r\nhand over to the Council lists of the taxes which are farmed out for\r\nthe year, entering on whitened tablets the name of the lessee and the\r\namount paid. They make separate lists, first of those who have to pay\r\ntheir instalments in each prytany, on ten several tablets, next of\r\nthose who pay thrice in the year, with a separate tablet for each\r\ninstalment, and finally of those who pay in the ninth prytany. They\r\nalso draw up a list of farms and dwellings which have been confiscated\r\nand sold by order of the courts; for these too come within their\r\nprovince. In the case of dwellings the value must be paid up in five\r\nyears, and in that of farms, in ten. The instalments are paid in the\r\nninth prytany. Further, the King-archon brings before the Council the\r\nleases of the sacred enclosures, written on whitened tablets. These too\r\nare leased for ten years, and the instalments are paid in the prytany;\r\nconsequently it is in this prytany that the greatest amount of money is\r\ncollected. The tablets containing the lists of the instalments are\r\ncarried into the Council, and the public clerk takes charge of them.\r\nWhenever a payment of instalments is to be made he takes from the\r\npigeon-holes the precise list of the sums which are to be paid and\r\nstruck off on that day, and delivers it to the Receivers-General.  The\r\nrest are kept apart, in order that no sum may be struck off before it\r\nis paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 48\r\n\r\nThere are ten Receivers-General (Apodectae), elected by lot, one from\r\neach tribe. These officers receive the tablets, and strike off the\r\ninstalments as they are paid, in the presence of the Council in the\r\nCouncil-chamber, and give the tablets back to the public clerk. If any\r\none fails to pay his instalment, a note is made of it on the tablet;\r\nand he is bound to pay double the amount of the deficiency, or, in\r\ndefault, to be imprisoned. The Council has full power by the laws to\r\nexact these payments and to inflict this imprisonment. They receive all\r\nthe instalments, therefore, on one day, and portion the money out among\r\nthe magistrates; and on the next day they bring up the report of the\r\napportionment, written on a wooden notice-board, and read it out in the\r\nCouncil-chamber, after which they ask publicly in the Council whether\r\nany one knows of any malpractice in reference to the apportionment, on\r\nthe part of either a magistrate or a private individual, and if any one\r\nis charged with malpractice they take a vote on it.\r\n\r\nThe Council also elects ten Auditors (Logistae) by lot from its own\r\nmembers, to audit the accounts of the magistrates for each prytany.\r\nThey also elect one Examiner of Accounts (Euthunus) by lot from each\r\ntribe, with two assessors (Paredri) for each examiner, whose duty it is\r\nto sit at the ordinary market hours, each opposite the statue of the\r\neponymous hero of his tribe; and if any one wishes to prefer a charge,\r\non either public or private grounds, against any magistrate who has\r\npassed his audit before the law-courts, within three days of his having\r\nso passed, he enters on a whitened tablet his own name and that of the\r\nmagistrate prosecuted, together with the malpractice that is alleged\r\nagainst him. He also appends his claim for a penalty of such amount as\r\nseems to him fitting, and gives in the record to the Examiner. The\r\nlatter takes it, and if after reading it he considers it proved he\r\nhands it over, if a private case, to the local justices who introduce\r\ncases for the tribe concerned, while if it is a public case he enters\r\nit on the register of the Thesmothetae. Then, if the Thesmothetae\r\naccept it, they bring the accounts of this magistrate once more before\r\nthe law-court, and the decision of the jury stands as the final\r\njudgement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 49\r\n\r\nThe Council also inspects the horses belonging to the state. If a man\r\nwho has a good horse is found to keep it in bad condition, he is\r\nmulcted in his allowance of corn; while those which cannot keep up or\r\nwhich shy and will not stand steady, it brands with a wheel on the jaw,\r\nand the horse so marked is disqualified for service. It also inspects\r\nthose who appear to be fit for service as scouts, and any one whom it\r\nrejects is deprived of his horse. It also examines the infantry who\r\nserve among the cavalry, and any one whom it rejects ceases to receive\r\nhis pay. The roll of the cavalry is drawn up by the Commissioners of\r\nEnrolment (Catalogeis), ten in number, elected by the Assembly by open\r\nvote. They hand over to the Hipparchs and Phylarchs the list of those\r\nwhom they have enrolled, and these officers take it and bring it up\r\nbefore the Council, and there open the sealed tablet containing the\r\nnames of the cavalry. If any of those who have been on the roll\r\npreviously make affidavit that they are physically incapable of cavalry\r\nservice, they strike them out; then they call up the persons newly\r\nenrolled, and if any one makes affidavit that he is either physically\r\nor pecuniarily incapable of cavalry service they dismiss him, but if no\r\nsuch affidavit is made the Council vote whether the individual in\r\nquestion is suitable for the purpose or not. If they vote in the\r\naffirmative his name is entered on the tablet; if not, he is dismissed\r\nwith the others.\r\n\r\nFormerly the Council used to decide on the plans for public buildings\r\nand the contract for making the robe of Athena; but now this work is\r\ndone by a jury in the law-courts appointed by lot, since the Council\r\nwas considered to have shown favouritism in its decisions. The Council\r\nalso shares with the Military Treasurer the superintendence of the\r\nmanufacture of the images of Victory and the prizes at the Panathenaic\r\nfestival.\r\n\r\nThe Council also examines infirm paupers; for there is a law which\r\nprovides that persons possessing less than three minas, who are so\r\ncrippled as to be unable to do any work, are, after examination by the\r\nCouncil, to receive two obols a day from the state for their support. A\r\ntreasurer is appointed by lot to attend to them.\r\n\r\nThe Council also, speaking broadly, cooperates in most of the duties of\r\nall the other magistrates; and this ends the list of the functions of\r\nthat body.\r\n\r\nPart 50\r\n\r\nThere are ten Commissioners for Repairs of Temples, elected by lot, who\r\nreceive a sum of thirty minas from the Receivers-General, and therewith\r\ncarry out the most necessary repairs in the temples.\r\n\r\nThere are also ten City Commissioners (Astynomi), of whom five hold\r\noffice in Piraeus and five in the city. Their duty is to see that\r\nfemale flute- and harp- and lute-players are not hired at more than two\r\ndrachmas, and if more than one person is anxious to hire the same girl,\r\nthey cast lots and hire her out to the person to whom the lot falls.\r\nThey also provide that no collector of sewage shall shoot any of his\r\nsewage within ten stradia of the walls; they prevent people from\r\nblocking up the streets by building, or stretching barriers across\r\nthem, or making drain-pipes in mid-air with a discharge into the\r\nstreet, or having doors which open outwards; they also remove the\r\ncorpses of those who die in the streets, for which purpose they have a\r\nbody of state slaves assigned to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 51\r\n\r\nMarket Commissioners (Agoranomi) are elected by lot, five for Piraeus,\r\nfive for the city. Their statutory duty is to see that all articles\r\noffered for sale in the market are pure and unadulterated.\r\n\r\nCommissioners of Weights and Measures (Metronomi) are elected by lot,\r\nfive for the city, and five for Piraeus. They see that sellers use fair\r\nweights and measures.\r\n\r\nFormerly there were ten Corn Commissioners (Sitophylaces), elected by\r\nlot, five for Piraeus, and five for the city; but now there are twenty\r\nfor the city and fifteen for Piraeus. Their duties are, first, to see\r\nthat the unprepared corn in the market is offered for sale at\r\nreasonable prices, and secondly, to see that the millers sell barley\r\nmeal at a price proportionate to that of barley, and that the bakers\r\nsell their loaves at a price proportionate to that of wheat, and of\r\nsuch weight as the Commissioners may appoint; for the law requires them\r\nto fix the standard weight.\r\n\r\nThere are ten Superintendents of the Mart, elected by lot, whose duty\r\nis to superintend the Mart, and to compel merchants to bring up into\r\nthe city two-thirds of the corn which is brought by sea to the Corn\r\nMart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 52\r\n\r\nThe Eleven also are appointed by lot to take care of the prisoners in\r\nthe state gaol. Thieves, kidnappers, and pickpockets are brought to\r\nthem, and if they plead guilty they are executed, but if they deny the\r\ncharge the Eleven bring the case before the law-courts; if the\r\nprisoners are acquitted, they release them, but if not, they then\r\nexecute them. They also bring up before the law-courts the list of\r\nfarms and houses claimed as state-property; and if it is decided that\r\nthey are so, they deliver them to the Commissioners for Public\r\nContracts. The Eleven also bring up informations laid against\r\nmagistrates alleged to be disqualified; this function comes within\r\ntheir province, but some such cases are brought up by the Thesmothetae.\r\n\r\nThere are also five Introducers of Cases (Eisagogeis), elected by lot,\r\none for each pair of tribes, who bring up the 'monthly' cases to the\r\nlaw-courts. 'Monthly' cases are these: refusal to pay up a dowry where\r\na party is bound to do so, refusal to pay interest on money borrowed at\r\n12 per cent., or where a man desirous of setting up business in the\r\nmarket has borrowed from another man capital to start with; also cases\r\nof slander, cases arising out of friendly loans or partnerships, and\r\ncases concerned with slaves, cattle, and the office of trierarch, or\r\nwith banks. These are brought up as 'monthly' cases and are introduced\r\nby these officers; but the Receivers-General perform the same function\r\nin cases for or against the farmers of taxes. Those in which the sum\r\nconcerned is not more than ten drachmas they can decide summarily, but\r\nall above that amount they bring into the law-courts as 'monthly' cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 53\r\n\r\nThe Forty are also elected by lot, four from each tribe, before whom\r\nsuitors bring all other cases. Formerly they were thirty in number, and\r\nthey went on circuit through the demes to hear causes; but after the\r\noligarchy of the Thirty they were increased to forty. They have full\r\npowers to decide cases in which the amount at issue does not exceed ten\r\ndrachmas, but anything beyond that value they hand over to the\r\nArbitrators. The Arbitrators take up the case, and, if they cannot\r\nbring the parties to an agreement, they give a decision. If their\r\ndecision satisfies both parties, and they abide by it, the case is at\r\nan end; but if either of the parties appeals to the law-courts, the\r\nArbitrators enclose the evidence, the pleadings, and the laws quoted in\r\nthe case in two urns, those of the plaintiff in the one, and those of\r\nthe defendant in the other. These they seal up and, having attached to\r\nthem the decision of the arbitrator, written out on a tablet, place\r\nthem in the custody of the four justices whose function it is to\r\nintroduce cases on behalf of the tribe of the defendant. These officers\r\ntake them and bring up the case before the law-court, to a jury of two\r\nhundred and one members in cases up to the value of a thousand\r\ndrachmas, or to one of four hundred and one in cases above that value.\r\nNo laws or pleadings or evidence may be used except those which were\r\nadduced before the Arbitrator, and have been enclosed in the urns.\r\n\r\nThe Arbitrators are persons in the sixtieth year of their age; this\r\nappears from the schedule of the Archons and the Eponymi. There are two\r\nclasses of Eponymi, the ten who give their names to the tribes, and the\r\nforty-two of the years of service. The youths, on being enrolled among\r\nthe citizens, were formerly registered upon whitened tablets, and the\r\nnames were appended of the Archon in whose year they were enrolled, and\r\nof the Eponymus who had been in course in the preceding year; at the\r\npresent day they are written on a bronze pillar, which stands in front\r\nof the Council-chamber, near the Eponymi of the tribes. Then the Forty\r\ntake the last of the Eponymi of the years of service, and assign the\r\narbitrations to the persons belonging to that year, casting lots to\r\ndetermine which arbitrations each shall undertake; and every one is\r\ncompelled to carry through the arbitrations which the lot assigns to\r\nhim. The law enacts that any one who does not serve as Arbitrator when\r\nhe has arrived at the necessary age shall lose his civil rights, unless\r\nhe happens to be holding some other office during that year, or to be\r\nout of the country. These are the only persons who escape the duty. Any\r\none who suffers injustice at the hands of the Arbitrator may appeal to\r\nthe whole board of Arbitrators, and if they find the magistrate guilty,\r\nthe law enacts that he shall lose his civil rights. The persons thus\r\ncondemned have, however, in their turn an appeal. The Eponymi are also\r\nused in reference to military expeditions; when the men of military age\r\nare despatched on service, a notice is put up stating that the men from\r\nsuch-and-such an Archon and Eponymus to such-and-such another Archon\r\nand Eponymus are to go on the expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 54\r\n\r\nThe following magistrates also are elected by lot: Five Commissioners\r\nof Roads (Hodopoei), who, with an assigned body of public slaves, are\r\nrequired to keep the roads in order: and ten Auditors, with ten\r\nassistants, to whom all persons who have held any office must give in\r\ntheir accounts. These are the only officers who audit the accounts of\r\nthose who are subject to examination, and who bring them up for\r\nexamination before the law-courts. If they detect any magistrate in\r\nembezzlement, the jury condemn him for theft, and he is obliged to\r\nrepay tenfold the sum he is declared to have misappropriated. If they\r\ncharge a magistrate with accepting bribes and the jury convict him,\r\nthey fine him for corruption, and this sum too is repaid tenfold. Or if\r\nthey convict him of unfair dealing, he is fined on that charge, and the\r\nsum assessed is paid without increase, if payment is made before the\r\nninth prytany, but otherwise it is doubled. A tenfold fine is not\r\ndoubled.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk of the prytany, as he is called, is also elected by lot.  He\r\nhas the charge of all public documents, and keeps the resolutions which\r\nare passed by the Assembly, and checks the transcripts of all other\r\nofficial papers and attends at the sessions of the Council.  Formerly\r\nhe was elected by open vote, and the most distinguished and trustworthy\r\npersons were elected to the post, as is known from the fact that the\r\nname of this officer is appended on the pillars recording treaties of\r\nalliance and grants of consulship and citizenship. Now, however, he is\r\nelected by lot. There is, in addition, a Clerk of the Laws, elected by\r\nlot, who attends at the sessions of the Council; and he too checks the\r\ntranscript of all the laws. The Assembly also elects by open vote a\r\nclerk to read documents to it and to the Council; but he has no other\r\nduty except that of reading aloud.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly also elects by lot the Commissioners of Public Worship\r\n(Hieropoei) known as the Commissioners for Sacrifices, who offer the\r\nsacrifices appointed by oracle, and, in conjunction with the seers,\r\ntake the auspices whenever there is occasion. It also elects by lot ten\r\nothers, known as Annual Commissioners, who offer certain sacrifices and\r\nadminister all the quadrennial festivals except the Panathenaea. There\r\nare the following quadrennial festivals: first that of Delos (where\r\nthere is also a sexennial festival), secondly the Brauronia, thirdly\r\nthe Heracleia, fourthly the Eleusinia, and fifthly the Panathenaea; and\r\nno two of these are celebrated in the same place. To these the\r\nHephaestia has now been added, in the archonship of Cephisophon.\r\n\r\nAn Archon is also elected by lot for Salamis, and a Demarch for\r\nPiraeus. These officers celebrate the Dionysia in these two places, and\r\nappoint Choregi. In Salamis, moreover, the name of the Archon is\r\npublicly recorded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 55\r\n\r\nAll the foregoing magistrates are elected by lot, and their powers are\r\nthose which have been stated. To pass on to the nine Archons, as they\r\nare called, the manner of their appointment from the earliest times has\r\nbeen described already. At the present day six Thesmothetae are elected\r\nby lot, together with their clerk, and in addition to these an Archon,\r\na King, and a Polemarch. One is elected from each tribe. They are\r\nexamined first of all by the Council of Five Hundred, with the\r\nexception of the clerk. The latter is examined only in the lawcourt,\r\nlike other magistrates (for all magistrates, whether elected by lot or\r\nby open vote, are examined before entering on their offices); but the\r\nnine Archons are examined both in the Council and again in the\r\nlaw-court. Formerly no one could hold the office if the Council\r\nrejected him, but now there is an appeal to the law-court, which is the\r\nfinal authority in the matter of the examination. When they are\r\nexamined, they are asked, first, 'Who is your father, and of what deme?\r\nwho is your father's father? who is your mother? who is your mother's\r\nfather, and of what deme?' Then the candidate is asked whether he\r\npossesses an ancestral Apollo and a household Zeus, and where their\r\nsanctuaries are; next if he possesses a family tomb, and where; then if\r\nhe treats his parents well, and pays his taxes, and has served on the\r\nrequired military expeditions. When the examiner has put these\r\nquestions, he proceeds, 'Call the witnesses to these facts'; and when\r\nthe candidate has produced his witnesses, he next asks, 'Does any one\r\nwish to make any accusation against this man?' If an accuser appears,\r\nhe gives the parties an opportunity of making their accusation and\r\ndefence, and then puts it to the Council to pass the candidate or not,\r\nand to the law-court to give the final vote. If no one wishes to make\r\nan accusation, he proceeds at once to the vote. Formerly a single\r\nindividual gave the vote, but now all the members are obliged to vote\r\non the candidates, so that if any unprincipled candidate has managed to\r\nget rid of his accusers, it may still be possible for him to be\r\ndisqualified before the law-court. When the examination has been thus\r\ncompleted, they proceed to the stone on which are the pieces of the\r\nvictims, and on which the Arbitrators take oath before declaring their\r\ndecisions, and witnesses swear to their testimony. On this stone the\r\nArchons stand, and swear to execute their office uprightly and\r\naccording to the laws, and not to receive presents in respect of the\r\nperformance of their duties, or, if they do, to dedicate a golden\r\nstatue. When they have taken this oath they proceed to the Acropolis,\r\nand there they repeat it; after this they enter upon their office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 56\r\n\r\nThe Archon, the King, and the Polemarch have each two assessors,\r\nnominated by themselves. These officers are examined in the lawcourt\r\nbefore they begin to act, and give in accounts on each occasion of\r\ntheir acting.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Archon enters office, he begins by issuing a\r\nproclamation that whatever any one possessed before he entered into\r\noffice, that he shall possess and hold until the end of his term. Next\r\nhe assigns Choregi to the tragic poets, choosing three of the richest\r\npersons out of the whole body of Athenians. Formerly he used also to\r\nassign five Choregi to the comic poets, but now the tribes provide the\r\nChoregi for them. Then he receives the Choregi who have been appointed\r\nby the tribes for the men's and boys' choruses and the comic poets at\r\nthe Dionysia, and for the men's and boys' choruses at the Thargelia (at\r\nthe Dionysia there is a chorus for each tribe, but at the Thargelia one\r\nbetween two tribes, each tribe bearing its share in providing it); he\r\ntransacts the exchanges of properties for them, and reports any excuses\r\nthat are tendered, if any one says that he has already borne this\r\nburden, or that he is exempt because he has borne a similar burden and\r\nthe period of his exemption has not yet expired, or that he is not of\r\nthe required age; since the Choregus of a boys' chorus must be over\r\nforty years of age. He also appoints Choregi for the festival at Delos,\r\nand a chief of the mission for the thirty-oar boat which conveys the\r\nyouths thither. He also superintends sacred processions, both that in\r\nhonour of Asclepius, when the initiated keep house, and that of the\r\ngreat Dionysia--the latter in conjunction with the Superintendents of\r\nthat festival. These officers, ten in number, were formerly elected by\r\nopen vote in the Assembly, and used to provide for the expenses of the\r\nprocession out of their private means; but now one is elected by lot\r\nfrom each tribe, and the state contributes a hundred minas for the\r\nexpenses. The Archon also superintends the procession at the Thargelia,\r\nand that in honour of Zeus the Saviour. He also manages the contests at\r\nthe Dionysia and the Thargelia.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the festivals which he superintends. The suits and\r\nindictments which come before him, and which he, after a preliminary\r\ninquiry, brings up before the lawcourts, are as follows.  Injury to\r\nparents (for bringing these actions the prosecutor cannot suffer any\r\npenalty); injury to orphans (these actions lie against their\r\nguardians); injury to a ward of state (these lie against their\r\nguardians or their husbands), injury to an orphan's estate (these too\r\nlie against the guardians); mental derangement, where a party charges\r\nanother with destroying his own property through unsoundness of mind;\r\nfor appointment of liquidators, where a party refuses to divide\r\nproperty in which others have a share; for constituting a wardship; for\r\ndetermining between rival claims to a wardship; for granting inspection\r\nof property to which another party lays claim; for appointing oneself\r\nas guardian; and for determining disputes as to inheritances and wards\r\nof state. The Archon also has the care of orphans and wards of state,\r\nand of women who, on the death of their husbands, declare themselves to\r\nbe with child; and he has power to inflict a fine on those who offend\r\nagainst the persons under his charge, or to bring the case before the\r\nlaw-courts. He also leases the houses of orphans and wards of state\r\nuntil they reach the age of fourteen, and takes mortgages on them; and\r\nif the guardians fail to provide the necessary food for the children\r\nunder their charge, he exacts it from them. Such are the duties of the\r\nArchon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 57\r\n\r\nThe King in the first place superintends the mysteries, in conjunction\r\nwith the Superintendents of Mysteries. The latter are elected in the\r\nAssembly by open vote, two from the general body of Athenians, one from\r\nthe Eumolpidae, and one from the Ceryces. Next, he superintends the\r\nLenaean Dionysia, which consists of a procession and a contest. The\r\nprocession is ordered by the King and the Superintendents in\r\nconjunction; but the contest is managed by the King alone. He also\r\nmanages all the contests of the torch-race; and to speak broadly, he\r\nadministers all the ancestral sacrifices.  Indictments for impiety come\r\nbefore him, or any disputes between parties concerning priestly rites;\r\nand he also determines all controversies concerning sacred rites for\r\nthe ancient families and the priests. All actions for homicide come\r\nbefore him, and it is he that makes the proclamation requiring polluted\r\npersons to keep away from sacred ceremonies. Actions for homicide and\r\nwounding are heard, if the homicide or wounding be willful, in the\r\nAreopagus; so also in cases of killing by poison, and of arson. These\r\nare the only cases heard by that Council. Cases of unintentional\r\nhomicide, or of intent to kill, or of killing a slave or a resident\r\nalien or a foreigner, are heard by the court of Palladium. When the\r\nhomicide is acknowledged, but legal justification is pleaded, as when a\r\nman takes an adulterer in the act, or kills another by mistake in\r\nbattle, or in an athletic contest, the prisoner is tried in the court\r\nof Delphinium. If a man who is in banishment for a homicide which\r\nadmits of reconciliation incurs a further charge of killing or\r\nwounding, he is tried in Phreatto, and he makes his defence from a boat\r\nmoored near the shore. All these cases, except those which are heard in\r\nthe Areopagus, are tried by the Ephetae on whom the lot falls. The King\r\nintroduces them, and the hearing is held within sacred precincts and in\r\nthe open air.  Whenever the King hears a case he takes off his crown.\r\nThe person who is charged with homicide is at all other times excluded\r\nfrom the temples, nor is it even lawful for him to enter the\r\nmarket-place; but on the occasion of his trial he enters the temple and\r\nmakes his defence. If the actual offender is unknown, the writ runs\r\nagainst 'the doer of the deed'. The King and the tribe-kings also hear\r\nthe cases in which the guilt rests on inanimate objects and the lower\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 58\r\n\r\nThe Polemarch performs the sacrifices to Artemis the huntress and to\r\nEnyalius, and arranges the contest at the funeral of those who have\r\nfallen in war, and makes offerings to the memory of Harmodius and\r\nAristogeiton. Only private actions come before him, namely those in\r\nwhich resident aliens, both ordinary and privileged, and agents of\r\nforeign states are concerned. It is his duty to receive these cases and\r\ndivide them into ten groups, and assign to each tribe the group which\r\ncomes to it by lot; after which the magistrates who introduce cases for\r\nthe tribe hand them over to the Arbitrators. The Polemarch, however,\r\nbrings up in person cases in which an alien is charged with deserting\r\nhis patron or neglecting to provide himself with one, and also of\r\ninheritances and wards of state where aliens are concerned; and in\r\nfact, generally, whatever the Archon does for citizens, the Polemarch\r\ndoes for aliens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 59\r\n\r\nThe Thesmothetae in the first place have the power of prescribing on\r\nwhat days the lawcourts are to sit, and next of assigning them to the\r\nseveral magistrates; for the latter must follow the arrangement which\r\nthe Thesmothetae assign. Moreover they introduce impeachments before\r\nthe Assembly, and bring up all votes for removal from office,\r\nchallenges of a magistrate's conduct before the Assembly, indictments\r\nfor illegal proposals, or for proposing a law which is contrary to the\r\ninterests of the state, complaints against Proedri or their president\r\nfor their conduct in office, and the accounts presented by the\r\ngenerals. All indictments also come before them in which a deposit has\r\nto be made by the prosecutor, namely, indictments for concealment of\r\nforeign origin, for corrupt evasion of foreign origin (when a man\r\nescapes the disqualification by bribery), for blackmailing accusations,\r\nbribery, false entry of another as a state debtor, false testimony to\r\nthe service of a summons, conspiracy to enter a man as a state debtor,\r\ncorrupt removal from the list of debtors, and adultery. They also bring\r\nup the examinations of all magistrates, and the rejections by the demes\r\nand the condemnations by the Council. Moreover they bring up certain\r\nprivate suits in cases of merchandise and mines, or where a slave has\r\nslandered a free man. It is they also who cast lots to assign the\r\ncourts to the various magistrates, whether for private or public cases.\r\nThey ratify commercial treaties, and bring up the cases which arise out\r\nof such treaties; and they also bring up cases of perjury from the\r\nAreopagus. The casting of lots for the jurors is conducted by all the\r\nnine Archons, with the clerk to the Thesmothetae as the tenth, each\r\nperforming the duty for his own tribe. Such are the duties of the nine\r\nArchons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 60\r\n\r\nThere are also ten Commissioners of Games (Athlothetae), elected by\r\nlot, one from each tribe. These officers, after passing an examination,\r\nserve for four years; and they manage the Panathenaic procession, the\r\ncontest in music and that in gymnastic, and the horse-race; they also\r\nprovide the robe of Athena and, in conjunction with the Council, the\r\nvases, and they present the oil to the athletes.  This oil is collected\r\nfrom the sacred olives. The Archon requisitions it from the owners of\r\nthe farms on which the sacred olives grow, at the rate of\r\nthree-quarters of a pint from each plant. Formerly the state used to\r\nsell the fruit itself, and if any one dug up or broke down one of the\r\nsacred olives, he was tried by the Council of Areopagus, and if he was\r\ncondemned, the penalty was death. Since, however, the oil has been paid\r\nby the owner of the farm, the procedure has lapsed, though the law\r\nremains; and the oil is a state charge upon the property instead of\r\nbeing taken from the individual plants. When, then, the Archon has\r\ncollected the oil for his year of office, he hands it over to the\r\nTreasurers to preserve in the Acropolis, and he may not take his seat\r\nin the Areopagus until he has paid over to the Treasurers the full\r\namount. The Treasurers keep it in the Acropolis until the Panathenaea,\r\nwhen they measure it out to the Commissioners of Games, and they again\r\nto the victorious competitors. The prizes for the victors in the\r\nmusical contest consist of silver and gold, for the victors in manly\r\nvigour, of shields, and for the victors in the gymnastic contest and\r\nthe horse-race, of oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 61\r\n\r\nAll officers connected with military service are elected by open vote.\r\nIn the first place, ten Generals (Strategi), who were formerly elected\r\none from each tribe, but now are chosen from the whole mass of\r\ncitizens. Their duties are assigned to them by open vote; one is\r\nappointed to command the heavy infantry, and leads them if they go out\r\nto war; one to the defence of the country, who remains on the\r\ndefensive, and fights if there is war within the borders of the\r\ncountry; two to Piraeus, one of whom is assigned to Munichia, and one\r\nto the south shore, and these have charge of the defence of the\r\nPiraeus; and one to superintend the symmories, who nominates the\r\ntrierarchs arranges exchanges of properties for them, and brings up\r\nactions to decide on rival claims in connexion with them.  The rest are\r\ndispatched to whatever business may be on hand at the moment. The\r\nappointment of these officers is submitted for confirmation in each\r\nprytany, when the question is put whether they are considered to be\r\ndoing their duty. If any officer is rejected on this vote, he is tried\r\nin the lawcourt, and if he is found guilty the people decide what\r\npunishment or fine shall be inflicted on him; but if he is acquitted he\r\nresumes his office. The Generals have full power, when on active\r\nservice, to arrest any one for insubordination, or to cashier him\r\npublicly, or to inflict a fine; the latter is, however, unusual.\r\n\r\nThere are also ten Taxiarchs, one from each tribe, elected by open\r\nvote; and each commands his own tribesmen and appoints captains of\r\ncompanies (Lochagi). There are also two Hipparchs, elected by open vote\r\nfrom the whole mass of the citizens, who command the cavalry, each\r\ntaking five tribes. They have the same powers as the Generals have in\r\nrespect of the infantry, and their appointments are also subject to\r\nconfirmation. There are also ten Phylarchs, elected by open vote, one\r\nfrom each tribe, to command the cavalry, as the Taxiarchs do the\r\ninfantry. There is also a Hipparch for Lemnos, elected by open vote,\r\nwho has charge of the cavalry in Lemnos. There is also a treasurer of\r\nthe Paralus, and another of the Ammonias, similarly elected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 62\r\n\r\nOf the magistrates elected by lot, in former times some including the\r\nnine Archons, were elected out of the tribe as a whole, while others,\r\nnamely those who are now elected in the Theseum, were apportioned among\r\nthe demes; but since the demes used to sell the elections, these\r\nmagistrates too are now elected from the whole tribe, except the\r\nmembers of the Council and the guards of the dockyards, who are still\r\nleft to the demes.\r\n\r\nPay is received for the following services. First the members of the\r\nAssembly receive a drachma for the ordinary meetings, and nine obols\r\nfor the 'sovereign' meeting. Then the jurors at the law-courts receive\r\nthree obols; and the members of the Council five obols. The Prytanes\r\nreceive an allowance of an obol for their maintenance. The nine Archons\r\nreceive four obols apiece for maintenance, and also keep a herald and a\r\nflute-player; and the Archon for Salamis receives a drachma a day. The\r\nCommissioners for Games dine in the Prytaneum during the month of\r\nHecatombaeon in which the Panathenaic festival takes place, from the\r\nfourteenth day onwards. The Amphictyonic deputies to Delos receive a\r\ndrachma a day from the exchequer of Delos. Also all magistrates sent to\r\nSamos, Scyros, Lemnos, or Imbros receive an allowance for their\r\nmaintenance. The military offices may be held any number of times, but\r\nnone of the others more than once, except the membership of the\r\nCouncil, which may be held twice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 63\r\n\r\nThe juries for the law-courts are chosen by lot by the nine Archons,\r\neach for their own tribe, and by the clerk to the Thesmothetae for the\r\ntenth. There are ten entrances into the courts, one for each tribe;\r\ntwenty rooms in which the lots are drawn, two for each tribe; a hundred\r\nchests, ten for each tribe; other chests, in which are placed the\r\ntickets of the jurors on whom the lot falls; and two vases.  Further,\r\nstaves, equal in number to the jurors required, are placed by the side\r\nof each entrance; and counters are put into one vase, equal in number\r\nto the staves. These are inscribed with letters of the alphabet\r\nbeginning with the eleventh (lambda), equal in number to the courts\r\nwhich require to be filled. All persons above thirty years of age are\r\nqualified to serve as jurors, provided they are not debtors to the\r\nstate and have not lost their civil rights. If any unqualified person\r\nserves as juror, an information is laid against him, and he is brought\r\nbefore the court; and, if he is convicted, the jurors assess the\r\npunishment or fine which they consider him to deserve. If he is\r\ncondemned to a money fine, he must be imprisoned until he has paid up\r\nboth the original debt, on account of which the information was laid\r\nagainst him, and also the fine which the court as imposed upon him.\r\nEach juror has his ticket of boxwood, on which is inscribed his name,\r\nwith the name of his father and his deme, and one of the letters of the\r\nalphabet up to kappa; for the jurors in their several tribes are\r\ndivided into ten sections, with approximately an equal number in each\r\nletter. When the Thesmothetes has decided by lot which letters are\r\nrequired to attend at the courts, the servant puts up above each court\r\nthe letter which has been assigned to it by the lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 64\r\n\r\nThe ten chests above mentioned are placed in front of the entrance used\r\nby each tribe, and are inscribed with the letters of the alphabet from\r\nalpha to kappa. The jurors cast in their tickets, each into the chest\r\non which is inscribed the letter which is on his ticket; then the\r\nservant shakes them all up, and the Archon draws one ticket from each\r\nchest. The individual so selected is called the Ticket-hanger\r\n(Empectes), and his function is to hang up the tickets out of his chest\r\non the bar which bears the same letter as that on the chest.  He is\r\nchosen by lot, lest, if the Ticket-hanger were always the same person,\r\nhe might tamper with the results. There are five of these bars in each\r\nof the rooms assigned for the lot-drawing. Then the Archon casts in the\r\ndice and thereby chooses the jurors from each tribe, room by room. The\r\ndice are made of brass, coloured black or white; and according to the\r\nnumber of jurors required, so many white dice are put in, one for each\r\nfive tickets, while the remainder are black, in the same proportion. As\r\nthe Archon draws out the dice, the crier calls out the names of the\r\nindividuals chosen. The Ticket-hanger is included among those selected.\r\nEach juror, as he is chosen and answers to his name, draws a counter\r\nfrom the vase, and holding it out with the letter uppermost shows it\r\nfirst to the presiding Archon; and he, when he has seen it, throws the\r\nticket of the juror into the chest on which is inscribed the letter\r\nwhich is on the counter, so that the juror must go into the court\r\nassigned to him by lot, and not into one chosen by himself, and that it\r\nmay be impossible for any one to collect the jurors of his choice into\r\nany particular court. For this purpose chests are placed near the\r\nArchon, as many in number as there are courts to be filled that day,\r\nbearing the letters of the courts on which the lot has fallen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 65\r\n\r\nThe juror thereupon, after showing his counter again to the attendant,\r\npasses through the barrier into the court. The attendant gives him a\r\nstaff of the same colour as the court bearing the letter which is on\r\nhis counter, so as to ensure his going into the court assigned to him\r\nby lot; since, if he were to go into any other, he would be betrayed by\r\nthe colour of his staff. Each court has a certain colour painted on the\r\nlintel of the entrance. Accordingly the juror, bearing his staff,\r\nenters the court which has the same colour as his staff, and the same\r\nletter as his counter. As he enters, he receives a voucher from the\r\nofficial to whom this duty has been assigned by lot. So with their\r\ncounters and their staves the selected jurors take their seats in the\r\ncourt, having thus completed the process of admission. The unsuccessful\r\ncandidates receive back their tickets from the Ticket-hangers. The\r\npublic servants carry the chests from each tribe, one to each court,\r\ncontaining the names of the members of the tribe who are in that court,\r\nand hand them over to the officials assigned to the duty of giving back\r\ntheir tickets to the jurors in each court, so that these officials may\r\ncall them up by name and pay them their fee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 66\r\n\r\nWhen all the courts are full, two ballot boxes are placed in the first\r\ncourt, and a number of brazen dice, bearing the colours of the several\r\ncourts, and other dice inscribed with the names of the presiding\r\nmagistrates. Then two of the Thesmothetae, selected by lot, severally\r\nthrow the dice with the colours into one box, and those with the\r\nmagistrates' names into the other. The magistrate whose name is first\r\ndrawn is thereupon proclaimed by the crier as assigned for duty in the\r\ncourt which is first drawn, and the second in the second, and similarly\r\nwith the rest. The object of this procedure is that no one may know\r\nwhich court he will have, but that each may take the court assigned to\r\nhim by lot.\r\n\r\n When the jurors have come in, and have been assigned to their\r\nrespective courts, the presiding magistrate in each court draws one\r\nticket out of each chest (making ten in all, one out of each tribe),\r\nand throws them into another empty chest. He then draws out five of\r\nthem, and assigns one to the superintendence of the water-clock, and\r\nthe other four to the telling of the votes. This is to prevent any\r\ntampering beforehand with either the superintendent of the clock or the\r\ntellers of the votes, and to secure that there is no malpractice in\r\nthese respects. The five who have not been selected for these duties\r\nreceive from them a statement of the order in which the jurors shall\r\nreceive their fees, and of the places where the several tribes shall\r\nrespectively gather in the court for this purpose when their duties are\r\ncompleted; the object being that the jurors may be broken up into small\r\ngroups for the reception of their pay, and not all crowd together and\r\nimpede one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 67\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries being concluded, the cases are called on. If it is\r\na day for private cases, the private litigants are called.  Four cases\r\nare taken in each of the categories defined in the law, and the\r\nlitigants swear to confine their speeches to the point at issue.  If it\r\nis a day for public causes, the public litigants are called, and only\r\none case is tried. Water-clocks are provided, having small\r\nsupply-tubes, into which the water is poured by which the length of the\r\npleadings is regulated. Ten gallons are allowed for a case in which an\r\namount of more than five thousand drachmas is involved, and three for\r\nthe second speech on each side. When the amount is between one and five\r\nthousand drachmas, seven gallons are allowed for the first speech and\r\ntwo for the second; when it is less than one thousand, five and two.\r\nSix gallons are allowed for arbitrations between rival claimants, in\r\nwhich there is no second speech. The official chosen by lot to\r\nsuperintend the water-clock places his hand on the supply tube whenever\r\nthe clerk is about to read a resolution or law or affidavit or treaty.\r\nWhen, however, a case is conducted according to a set measurement of\r\nthe day, he does not stop the supply, but each party receives an equal\r\nallowance of water. The standard of measurement is the length of the\r\ndays in the month Poseideon. The measured day is employed in cases\r\nwhen imprisonment, death, exile, loss of civil rights, or confiscation\r\nof goods is assigned as the penalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 68\r\n\r\nMost of the courts consist of 500 members; and when it is necessary\r\nto bring public cases before a jury of 1,000 members, two courts\r\ncombine for the purpose, the most important cases of all are brought\r\n1,500 jurors, or three courts. The ballot balls are made of brass with\r\nstems running through the centre, half of them having the stem pierced\r\nand the other half solid. When the speeches are concluded, the\r\nofficials assigned to the taking of the votes give each juror two\r\nballot balls, one pierced and one solid. This is done in full view of\r\nthe rival litigants, to secure that no one shall receive two pierced or\r\ntwo solid balls. Then the official designated for the purpose takes\r\naway the jurors' staves, in return for which each one as he records his\r\nvote receives a brass voucher marked with the numeral 3 (because he\r\ngets three obols when he gives it up). This is to ensure that all shall\r\nvote; since no one can get a voucher unless he votes. Two urns, one of\r\nbrass and the other of wood, stand in the court, in distinct spots so\r\nthat no one may surreptitiously insert ballot balls; in these the\r\njurors record their votes. The brazen urn is for effective votes, the\r\nwooden for unused votes; and the brazen urn has a lid pierced so as to\r\ntake only one ballot ball, in order that no one may put in two at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhen the jurors are about to vote, the crier demands first whether the\r\nlitigants enter a protest against any of the evidence; for no protest\r\ncan be received after the voting has begun. Then he proclaims again,\r\n'The pierced ballot for the plaintiff, the solid for the defendant';\r\nand the juror, taking his two ballot balls from the stand, with his\r\nhand closed over the stem so as not to show either the pierced or the\r\nsolid ballot to the litigants, casts the one which is to count into the\r\nbrazen urn, and the other into the wooden urn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 69\r\n\r\nWhen all the jurors have voted, the attendants take the urn containing\r\nthe effective votes and discharge them on to a reckoning board having\r\nas many cavities as there are ballot balls, so that the effective\r\nvotes, whether pierced or solid, may be plainly displayed and easily\r\ncounted. Then the officials assigned to the taking of the votes tell\r\nthem off on the board, the solid in one place and the pierced in\r\nanother, and the crier announces the numbers of the votes, the pierced\r\nballots being for the prosecutor and the solid for the defendant.\r\nWhichever has the majority is victorious; but if the votes are equal\r\nthe verdict is for the defendant. Each juror receives two ballots, and\r\nuses one to record his vote, and throws the other away.\r\n\r\nThen, if damages have to be awarded, they vote again in the same way,\r\nfirst returning their pay-vouchers and receiving back their staves.\r\nHalf a gallon of water is allowed to each party for the discussion of\r\nthe damages. Finally, when all has been completed in accordance with\r\nthe law, the jurors receive their pay in the order assigned by the lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END",
