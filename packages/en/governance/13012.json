GRANT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrefatory Note\r\n\r\nThe election of General Grant to the Presidency by the people of the\r\nUnited States was another instance illustrating the gratitude of a\r\nrepublic to a successful soldier. But for the great civil war no one\r\nsupposes he would ever have been elevated to this exalted post. His\r\nservices in that heroic struggle were such as to win the highest\r\nencomiums from his countrymen, and naturally at the first opportunity\r\nafter the closing of the war when a Chief Executive was to be chosen\r\nthey turned their eyes to the most conspicuous figure in that war and\r\nmade him President of the United States. This volume, the seventh of the\r\nseries, comprises his eight years and the four years of his successor,\r\nMr. Hayes. During this period of twelve years--that is, from March 4,\r\n1869, to March 4, 1881--the legislation for the restoration of the\r\nSouthern States to their original positions in the Union was enacted,\r\nthe reunion of the States was perfected, and all sections of the land\r\nagain given full and free representation in Congress. Much of the\r\nbitterness engendered by the war, and which had been left alive at its\r\nclosing, and which was not diminished to any appreciable extent during\r\nPresident Johnson's term, was largely assuaged during President Grant's\r\nAdministration, and under that of President Hayes was further softened\r\nand almost entirely dissipated.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that President Grant in his papers dwelt especially\r\nupon the duty of paying the national debt in gold and returning to\r\nspecie payments; that he urged upon Congress a proposition to annex\r\nSanto Domingo; that during his Administration the \"Quaker Peace\r\nCommission\" was appointed to deal with the Indians, the fifteenth\r\namendment to the Constitution of the United States was proclaimed, the\r\ntreaty of Washington was negotiated, and, with a subsequent arbitration\r\nat Geneva, a settlement was provided of the difficulties relating to the\r\nAlabama claims and the fisheries; that in 1870 and frequently afterwards\r\nhe urged upon Congress the need of reform in the civil service. His\r\nappeals secured the passage of the law of March 3, 1871, under which\r\nhe appointed a civil service commission. This commission framed rules,\r\nwhich were approved by the President. They provided for open competitive\r\nexamination, and went into effect January 1, 1872; and out of these grew\r\nthe present civil-service rules. One of his most important papers was\r\nthe message vetoing the \"inflation bill.\"\r\n\r\nThe closing months of his public life covered the stormy and exciting\r\nperiod following the Presidential election of 1876, when the result as\r\nbetween Mr. Tilden and Mr. Hayes was so long in doubt. There is very\r\nlittle, however, in any Presidential paper of that period to indicate\r\nthe great peril to the country and the severe strain to which our\r\ninstitutions were subjected in that memorable contest.\r\n\r\nThe Administration of Mr. Hayes, though it began amid exciting scenes\r\nand an unprecedented situation which threatened disasters, was rather\r\nmarked by moderation and a sympathy with what he considered true reform.\r\nSome of his vetoes are highly interesting, and indicate independence of\r\ncharacter and that he was not always controlled by mere party politics.\r\nOne of the most famous and best remembered of his messages is that\r\nvetoing the Bland-Allison Act, which restored the legal-tender quality\r\nto the silver dollar and provided for its limited coinage.\r\n\r\nOther papers of interest are his message recommending the resumption of\r\nspecie payments; vetoes of a bill to restrict Chinese immigration, of\r\nan Army appropriation bill, of a legislative, executive, and judicial\r\nappropriation bill, and of the act known as the \"funding act of 1881.\"\r\nIt was during Mr. Hayes's Administration, when the Forty-fifth Congress\r\nmet in extraordinary session on March 18, 1879, that for the first time\r\nsince the Congress that was chosen with Mr. Buchanan in 1856 the\r\nDemocratic party was in control of both Houses.\r\n\r\nJAMES D. RICHARDSON,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 22, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUlysses S. Grant\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1869, to March 4, 1877\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUlysses S. Grant\r\n\r\nUlysses S. Grant was born at Point Pleasant, Clermont County, Ohio,\r\nApril 27, 1822. He was of Scotch ancestry, but his family had been\r\nAmerican in all its branches for several generations. Was a descendant\r\nof Mathew Grant, who arrived at Dorchester, Mass., in May, 1630. His\r\nfather was Jesse R. Grant and his mother Hannah Simpson; they were\r\nmarried in Clermont County, Ohio, in June, 1821. In the fall of 1823 his\r\nparents removed to Georgetown, the county seat of Brown County, Ohio.\r\nUlysses, the eldest of six children, spent his boyhood in assisting his\r\nfather on the farm, which was more congenial than working in the tannery\r\nof which his father was proprietor. From an early age until 17 years\r\nold attended the subscription schools of Georgetown, except during\r\nthe winters of 1836-37 and 1838-39, which were spent at schools in\r\nMaysville, Ky., and Ripley, Ohio. In the spring of 1839, at the age of\r\n17, was appointed to a cadetship in the Military Academy at West Point\r\nby Thomas L. Hamer, a Member of Congress, and entered the Academy July\r\n1, 1839. The name given him at birth was Hiram Ulysses, but he was\r\nalways called by his middle name. Mr. Hamer, thinking Ulysses his first\r\nname, and that his middle name was probably that of his mother's family,\r\ninserted in the official appointment the name of Ulysses S. Grant. The\r\nofficials of the Academy were notified by Cadet Grant of the error, but\r\nthey did not feel authorized to correct it, and it was acquiesced in and\r\nbecame the name by which he was always known. Graduated from the Academy\r\nin 1843, twenty-first in a class of thirty-nine members. Was attached to\r\nthe Fourth United States Infantry as brevet second lieutenant July 1,\r\n1843; was appointed second lieutenant, Seventh Infantry, September 30,\r\n1845, and transferred to the Fourth Infantry November 15, 1845. During\r\nthe Mexican War (1846-1848) took part with his regiment in active\r\nservice, and was in all the battles fought by Generals Scott and Taylor\r\nexcept that of Buena Vista. Was brevetted for gallant conduct at the\r\nbattles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma, but declined the honor. At\r\nthe battle of Monterey distinguished himself by volunteering to run the\r\ngantlet and bring ammunition for the troops into the city. September 8,\r\n1847, was appointed brevet first lieutenant for gallant conduct at\r\nMolino del Rey. Acted as regimental quartermaster April 1, 1847, to July\r\n23, 1848, and from November 17, 1848, to August 5, 1853. September 13,\r\n1847, was brevetted captain for gallant conduct at the battle of\r\nChapultepec, and on September 16 was appointed first lieutenant. At San\r\nCosme was mentioned in special orders by his commanders--regimental,\r\nbrigade, and division. After the Mexican War his regiment was sent to\r\nPascagoula, Miss., and afterwards to Sacketts Harbor, N.Y., and Detroit,\r\nMich. August 22, 1848, married Miss Julia Dent, of St. Louis, Mo. In\r\n1852 his regiment was sent to the Pacific Coast. August 5, 1853, was\r\nappointed captain. Resigned July 31, 1854, and went to live on a farm\r\nnear St. Louis, but in 1858 gave up farming on account of his health,\r\nand entered into the real-estate business in St. Louis. In May, 1860,\r\nremoved to Galena, Ill., and became a clerk in his father's store.\r\nIn April, 1861, after President Lincoln's call for troops, presided\r\nat a public meeting in Galena, which resulted in the organization of a\r\ncompany of volunteers, which he drilled and accompanied to Springfield,\r\nIll. Was employed by Governor Yates in the adjutant-general's office,\r\nand appointed mustering officer. Offered his services to the National\r\nGovernment in a letter written May 24, 1861, but no answer was ever\r\nmade to it. June 17, 1861, was appointed colonel of the Twenty-first\r\nIllinois Volunteers, and served until August 7, when he was appointed\r\nbrigadier-general of volunteers by the President, his commission to date\r\nfrom May 17, 1861. Was assigned September 1 to command the District\r\nof Southeastern Missouri. September 4 established his headquarters at\r\nCairo, and on the 6th captured Paducah, Ky. February 2, 1862, advanced\r\nfrom Cairo; on the 6th captured Fort Henry, and on the 16th Fort\r\nDonelson. Soon afterwards was made a major-general of volunteers, his\r\ncommission dating from February 16. March 4 was relieved from his\r\ncommand and ordered to remain at Fort Henry, but on the 13th was\r\nrestored. Commanded at the battle of Shiloh, April 6 and 7, 1862.\r\nGeneral Halleck on April 11 assumed command of the combined armies, and\r\nGeneral Grant became second in command during the advance upon and the\r\nsiege of Corinth. In July Halleck became general in chief of all the\r\narmies, and General Grant was placed in command of the District of West\r\nTennessee. In September fought the battle of Iuka, Miss., and in October\r\nthe battle of Corinth. January 29, 1863, moved down the Mississippi\r\nRiver and took command of the troops opposite Vicksburg. On March 29\r\nsent one corps of his army across the peninsula opposite Vicksburg, and\r\non April 16 ran the batteries with seven gunboats and three transports.\r\nApril 22 six other transports ran the batteries. His army was now below\r\nVicksburg, and on the 29th bombarded Grand Gulf. May 1 fought the battle\r\nat Port Gibson, and on May 3 captured Grand Gulf. May 12 defeated the\r\nConfederates at Raymond; and on the 14th captured Jackson, Miss. After\r\nseveral engagements the Confederates were driven by him into Vicksburg,\r\nwhen he began the siege of that city, which was surrendered July 4,\r\n1863. On the same day was commissioned a major-general in the United\r\nStates Army. In August went to New Orleans to confer with General Banks,\r\nand while reviewing the troops there was injured by his horse falling on\r\nhim. About the middle of October was assigned to the command of the\r\nMilitary Division of the Mississippi, which included Rosecran's army at\r\nChattanooga, Tenn. Arrived at Chattanooga October 23, and the next day\r\nissued orders which resulted in the battle of Wauhatchie on the 29th.\r\nAttacked the Confederates under General Bragg on November 23, and\r\nafter three days' fighting captured Missionary Ridge, whereupon the\r\nConfederates retreated to Dalton, Ga. For his successes Congress, in\r\nDecember, 1863, passed a resolution of thanks to him and the officers\r\nand soldiers of his command, and presented him with a gold medal. The\r\nbill restoring the grade of lieutenant-general became a law in February,\r\n1864, and on March 1 he was nominated for the position and was confirmed\r\nthe succeeding day. On March 12 assumed command of all the armies of the\r\nUnited States, and immediately began the plan of campaign that kept all\r\nof the armies in motion until the war ended. About May 4, 1864, this\r\ncampaign, the greatest of the war, began, and lasted until the surrender\r\nof the Confederates in April, 1865. During this period there were fought\r\nsome of the bloodiest battles of the world. On April 9, 1865, General\r\nLee surrendered his army at Appomattox, Va., to General Grant, who then\r\ndisplayed the greatest magnanimity to the Confederates, and won for\r\nhimself from his late enemies their warmest gratitude. His magnanimity\r\nwill always be remembered by the Confederate soldiers, and will stand\r\nin history as long as nobility of character shall be appreciated by\r\nmankind. On the closing of the war directed his attention to mustering\r\nout of service the great army under his command and the disposal of the\r\nenormous quantity of stores of the Government. In the discharge of his\r\nduties visited different sections of the country and was received\r\neverywhere with enthusiasm. The citizens of Philadelphia presented him\r\nwith a handsome residence in that city; his old neighbors in Galena gave\r\nhim a pretty home in their town; the people of New York presented to him\r\na check for $105,000. In November and December, 1865, traveled through\r\nthe Southern States, and made a report to the President upon the\r\nconditions there. In May, 1866, submitted a plan to the Government for\r\nthe reorganization of the Regular Army of the United States, which\r\nbecame the basis of its reorganization. July 25 Congress passed an act\r\ncreating the grade of general of the armies of the United States,\r\nand on the same day he was appointed to this rank. August 12, 1867, was\r\nappointed by President Johnson Secretary of War _ad interim_, which\r\nposition he held until January 14, 1868. At the national convention\r\nof the Republican party which met in Chicago on May 20, 1868, was\r\nunanimously nominated for President on the first call of States. His\r\nletter of acceptance of that nomination was brief, and contained the\r\nfamous sentence, \"Let us have peace.\" At the election in November was\r\nchosen to be President, receiving 214 electoral votes, while Horatio\r\nSeymour received 80. Was renominated by his party in national convention\r\nin Philadelphia June 6, 1872, and at the election in November received\r\n286 electoral votes, against 66 which would have been cast for Horace\r\nGreeley if he had lived. Retired from office March 4, 1877. After his\r\nretirement made a journey into foreign countries, and was received with\r\ngreat distinction and pomp by all the governments and peoples he\r\nvisited. An earnest effort was made to nominate him for a third term,\r\nbut it failed. By special act of Congress passed March 3, 1885, was\r\nplaced as general on the retired list of the Army. He died July 23,\r\n1885, at Mount McGregor, N.Y., and was buried at Riverside Park, New\r\nYork City, on the Hudson River.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n_Citizens of the United States_:\r\n\r\nYour suffrages having elected me to the office of President of the\r\nUnited States, I have, in conformity to the Constitution of our country,\r\ntaken the oath of office prescribed therein. I have taken this oath\r\nwithout mental reservation and with the determination to do to the best\r\nof my ability all that is required of me. The responsibilities of the\r\nposition I feel, but accept them without fear. The office has come to me\r\nunsought; I commence its duties untrammeled. I bring to it a conscious\r\ndesire and determination to fill it to the best of my ability to the\r\nsatisfaction of the people.\r\n\r\nOn all leading questions agitating the public mind I will always express\r\nmy views to Congress and urge them according to my judgment, and when\r\nI think it advisable will exercise the constitutional privilege of\r\ninterposing a veto to defeat measures which I oppose; but all laws will\r\nbe faithfully executed, whether they meet my approval or not.\r\n\r\nI shall on all subjects have a policy to recommend, but none to enforce\r\nagainst the will of the people. Laws are to govern all alike--those\r\nopposed as well as those who favor them. I know no method to secure the\r\nrepeal of bad or obnoxious laws so effective as their stringent\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nThe country having just emerged from a great rebellion, many\r\nquestions will come before it for settlement in the next four years\r\nwhich preceding Administrations have never had to deal with. In meeting\r\nthese it is desirable that they should be approached calmly, without\r\nprejudice, hate, or sectional pride, remembering that the greatest good\r\nto the greatest number is the object to be attained.\r\n\r\nThis requires security of person, property, and free religious and\r\npolitical opinion in every part of our common country, without regard\r\nto local prejudice. All laws to secure these ends will receive my best\r\nefforts for their enforcement.\r\n\r\nA great debt has been contracted in securing to us and our posterity\r\nthe Union. The payment of this, principal and interest, as well as the\r\nreturn to a specie basis as soon as it can be accomplished without\r\nmaterial detriment to the debtor class or to the country at large,\r\nmust be provided for. To protect the national honor, every dollar\r\nof Government indebtedness should be paid in gold, unless otherwise\r\nexpressly stipulated in the contract. Let it be understood that no\r\nrepudiator of one farthing of our public debt will be trusted in public\r\nplace, and it will go far toward strengthening a credit which ought to\r\nbe the best in the world, and will ultimately enable us to replace the\r\ndebt with bonds bearing less interest than we now pay. To this should be\r\nadded a faithful collection of the revenue, a strict accountability to\r\nthe Treasury for every dollar collected, and the greatest practicable\r\nretrenchment in expenditure in every department of Government.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the paying capacity of the country now, with the ten\r\nStates in poverty from the effects of war, but soon to emerge, I trust,\r\ninto greater prosperity than ever before, with its paying capacity\r\ntwenty-five years ago, and calculate what it probably will be\r\ntwenty-five years hence, who can doubt the feasibility of paying every\r\ndollar then with more ease than we now pay for useless luxuries? Why,\r\nit looks as though Providence had bestowed upon us a strong box in the\r\nprecious metals locked up in the sterile mountains of the far West, and\r\nwhich we are now forging the key to unlock, to meet the very contingency\r\nthat is now upon us.\r\n\r\nUltimately it may be necessary to insure the facilities to reach these\r\nriches, and it may be necessary also that the General Government should\r\ngive its aid to secure this access; but that should only be when a\r\ndollar of obligation to pay secures precisely the same sort of dollar\r\nto use now, and hot before. Whilst the question of specie payments is\r\nin abeyance the prudent business man is careful about contracting debts\r\npayable in the distant future. The nation should follow the same rule.\r\nA prostrate commerce is to be rebuilt and all industries encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe young men of the country--those who from their age must be its\r\nrulers twenty-five years hence--have a peculiar interest in maintaining\r\nthe national honor. A moment's reflection as to what will be our\r\ncommanding influence among the nations of the earth in their day, if\r\nthey are only true to themselves, should inspire them with national\r\npride. All divisions--geographical, political, and religious--can join\r\nin this common sentiment. How the public debt is to be paid or specie\r\npayments resumed is not so important as that a plan should be adopted\r\nand acquiesced in. A united determination to do is worth more than\r\ndivided counsels upon the method of doing. Legislation upon this subject\r\nmay not be necessary now, nor even advisable, but it will be when the\r\ncivil law is more fully restored in all parts of the country and trade\r\nresumes its wonted channels.\r\n\r\nIt will be my endeavor to execute all laws in good faith, to collect\r\nall revenues assessed, and to have them properly accounted for and\r\neconomically disbursed. I will to the best of my ability appoint to\r\noffice those only who will carry out this design.\r\n\r\nIn regard to foreign policy, I would deal with nations as equitable law\r\nrequires individuals to deal with each other, and I would protect the\r\nlaw-abiding citizen, whether of native or foreign birth, wherever his\r\nrights are jeopardized or the flag of our country floats. I would\r\nrespect the rights of all nations, demanding equal respect for our own.\r\nIf others depart from this rule in their dealings with us, we may be\r\ncompelled to follow their precedent.\r\n\r\nThe proper treatment of the original occupants of this land--the\r\nIndians--is one deserving of careful study. I will favor any course\r\ntoward them which tends to their civilization and ultimate citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe question of suffrage is one which is likely to agitate the public\r\nso long as a portion of the citizens of the nation are excluded from\r\nits privileges in any State. It seems to me very desirable that this\r\nquestion should be settled now, and I entertain the hope and express\r\nthe desire that it may be by the ratification of the fifteenth article\r\nof amendment to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I ask patient forbearance one toward another throughout\r\nthe land, and a determined effort on the part of every citizen to do his\r\nshare toward cementing a happy union; and I ask the prayers of the\r\nnation to Almighty God in behalf of this consummation.\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1869.\r\n\r\n[NOTE.--The Forty-first Congress, first session, met March 4, 1869,\r\nin accordance with the act of January 22, 1867.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _March 6, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nSince the nomination and confirmation of Alexander T.

it further enacted_, That no person appointed to any office\r\n  instituted by this act shall, directly or indirectly, be concerned or\r\n  interested in carrying on the business of trade or commerce;

disposal of any public securities of\r\n  any State or of the United States; or take or apply to his own use any\r\n  emolument or gain for negotiating or transacting any business in the\r\n  said Department other than what shall be allowed by law; and if any\r\n  person shall offend against any of the prohibitions of this act he shall\r\n  be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor and forfeit to the United States\r\n  the penalty of $3,000, and shall upon conviction be removed from office\r\n  and forever thereafter incapable of holding any office under the United\r\n  States: _Provided_, That if any other person than a public prosecutor\r\n  shall give information of any such offense, upon which a prosecution and\r\n  conviction shall be had, one-half the aforesaid penalty of $3,000, when\r\n  recovered, shall be for the use of the person giving such information.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of these provisions and the fact that Mr. Stewart has been\r\nunanimously confirmed by the Senate, I

of claims against Great Britain, I transmit a\r\nreport from the Secretary of State and the papers which accompanied it.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _April 7, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nWhile I am aware that the time in which Congress proposes now to remain\r\nin session is very brief, and that it is its desire, as far as is\r\nconsistent with the public interest, to avoid entering upon the general\r\nbusiness of legislation, there is one subject which concerns so deeply\r\nthe welfare of the country that I deem it my duty to bring it before\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that you will concur with me in the opinion that\r\nit is desirable to restore the States which were engaged in the\r\nrebellion to their proper relations to the Government and the country\r\nat as early a period as the people of those States shall be found\r\nwilling to become peaceful and orderly communities and to adopt and\r\nmaintain such constitutions and laws as will effectually secure the\r\ncivil and political rights of all persons within their borders.\r\nThe authority of the United States, which has been vindicated and\r\nestablished by its military power, must undoubtedly be asserted for the\r\nabsolute protection of all its citizens in the full enjoyment of the\r\nfreedom and security which is the object of a republican government; but\r\nwhenever the people of a rebellious State are ready to enter in good\r\nfaith upon the accomplishment of this object, in entire conformity with\r\nthe constitutional authority of Congress, it is certainly desirable that\r\nall causes of irritation should be removed as promptly as possible, that\r\na more perfect union may be established and the country be restored to\r\npeace and prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe convention of the people of Virginia which met in Richmond on\r\nTuesday, December 3, 1867, framed a constitution for that State, which\r\nwas adopted by the convention on the 17th of April, 1868, and I desire\r\nrespectfully to call the attention of Congress to the propriety of\r\nproviding by law for the holding of an election in that State at some\r\ntime during the months of May and June next, under the direction of\r\nthe military commander of that district, at which the question of the\r\nadoption of that constitution shall be submitted to the citizens of\r\nthe State; and if this should seem desirable, I would recommend that a\r\nseparate vote be taken upon such parts as may be thought expedient, and\r\nthat at the same time and under the same authority there shall be an\r\nelection for the officers provided under such constitution, and that\r\nthe constitution, or such parts thereof as shall have been adopted by\r\nthe people, be submitted to Congress on the first Monday of December\r\nnext for its consideration, so that if the same is then approved the\r\nnecessary steps will have been taken for the restoration of the State\r\nof Virginia to its proper relations to the Union. I am led to make this\r\nrecommendation from the confident hope and belief that the people of\r\nthat State are now ready to cooperate with the National Government in\r\nbringing it again into such relations to the Union as it ought as soon\r\nas possible to establish and maintain, and to give to all its people\r\nthose equal rights under the law which were asserted in the Declaration\r\nof Independence in the words of one of the most illustrious of its sons.\r\n\r\nI desire also to ask the consideration of Congress to the question\r\nwhether there is not just ground for believing that the constitution\r\nframed by a convention of the people of Mississippi for that State, and\r\nonce rejected, might not be again submitted to the people of that State\r\nin like manner, and with the probability of the same result.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas objects of interest to the United States require that the Senate\r\nshould be convened at 12 o'clock on the 12th day of April, 1869, to\r\nreceive and act upon such communications as may be made to it on the\r\npart of the Executive:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, U.S. Grant, President of the United States, have\r\nconsidered it to be my duty to issue this my proclamation, declaring\r\nthat an extraordinary occasion requires the Senate of the United States\r\nto convene for the transaction of business at the Capitol, in the city\r\nof Washington, on the 12th day of April, 1869, at 12 o'clock noon on\r\nthat day, of which all who shall at that time be entitled to act as\r\nmembers of that body are hereby required to take notice.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States, at Washington,\r\nthe 8th day of April, A.D. 1869, and of the Independence of the United\r\nStates of America the ninety-third.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  HAMILTON FISH,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 16, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for consideration with a view to ratification,\r\na convention between the United States and the Emperor of the French,\r\nsigned this day by the plenipotentiaries of the parties, for the mutual\r\nprotection of trade-marks of their respective citizens and subjects.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 21, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, in answer to their resolution adopted in\r\nexecutive session on the 16th of February last, requesting copy of the\r\nofficial correspondence of Mr. Buchanan during his residence at St.\r\nPetersburg as minister of the United States, a report from the Secretary\r\nof State, with the accompanying papers.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the provisions of the act of Congress approved April\r\n10, 1869, I hereby designate the 6th day of July, 1869, as the time\r\nfor submitting the constitution passed by the convention which met in\r\nRichmond, Va., on Tuesday, the 3d day of December, 1867, to the voters\r\nof said State registered at the date of such submission, viz, July 6,\r\n1869, for ratification or rejection.\r\n\r\nAnd I submit to a separate vote the fourth clause of section I of\r\narticle 3 of said constitution, which is in the following words:\r\n\r\n  Every person who has been a Senator or Representative in Congress, or\r\n  elector of President or Vice-President, or who held any office, civil\r\n  or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having\r\n  previously taken an oath as a member of Congress, or as an officer of\r\n  the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an\r\n  executive or judicial officer of any State, shall have engaged in\r\n  insurrection or rebellion against the same or given aid or comfort to\r\n  the enemies thereof.

Stuart, of Philadelphia; Robert Campbell,\r\nSt. Louis; W.E. Dodge, New York; E.S. Tobey, Boston; Felix R. Brunot,\r\nPittsburg; Nathan Bishop, New York, and Henry S. Lane, of Indiana, the\r\nfollowing regulations will till further directions control the action of\r\nsaid commission and of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in matters coming\r\nunder their joint supervision:\r\n\r\n1. The commission will make its own organization and employ its own\r\nclerical assistants, keeping its \"necessary expenses of transportation,\r\nsubsistence, and clerk hire when actually engaged in said service\"\r\nwithin the amount appropriated therefor by Congress.\r\n\r\n2. The commission shall be furnished with full opportunity to inspect\r\nthe records of the Indian Office and to obtain full information as to\r\nthe conduct of all parts of the affairs thereof.\r\n\r\n3. They shall have full power to inspect, in person or by subcommittee,\r\nthe various Indian superintendencies and agencies in the Indian country,\r\nto be present at payment of annuities, at consultations or councils with\r\nthe Indians, and when on the ground to advise superintendents and agents\r\nin the performance of their duties.\r\n\r\n4. They are authorized to be present, in person or by subcommittee, at\r\npurchases of goods for Indian purposes, and inspect said purchases,\r\nadvising the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in regard thereto.\r\n\r\n5. Whenever they shall deem it necessary or advisable that instructions\r\nof superintendents or agents be changed or modified, they will\r\ncommunicate such advice through the office of Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs to the Secretary of the Interior, and in like manner their\r\nadvice as to changes in modes of purchasing goods or conducting the\r\naffairs of the Indian Bureau proper. Complaints against superintendents\r\nor agents or other officers will in the same manner be forwarded to the\r\nIndian Bureau or Department of the Interior for action.\r\n\r\n6. The commission will at their board meetings determine upon the\r\nrecommendations to be made as to the plans of civilizing or dealing\r\nwith the Indians, and submit the same for action in the manner above\r\nindicated, and all plans involving the expenditure of public money will\r\nbe acted upon by the Executive or the Secretary of the Interior before\r\nexpenditure is made under the same.\r\n\r\n7. The usual modes of accounting with the Treasury can not be changed,\r\nand all expenditures, therefore, must be subject to the approvals now\r\nrequired by law and the regulations of the Treasury Department, and all\r\nvouchers must conform to the same laws and requirements and pass through\r\nthe ordinary channels.\r\n\r\n8. All the officers of the Government connected with the Indian service\r\nare enjoined to afford every facility and opportunity to said commission\r\nand their subcommittees in the performance of their duties, and to give\r\nthe most respectful heed to their advice within the limits of such\r\nofficers' positive instructions from their superiors; to allow such\r\ncommissioners full access to their records and accounts, and to\r\ncooperate with them in the most earnest manner to the extent of their\r\nproper powers in the general work of civilizing the Indians, protecting\r\nthem in their legal rights, and stimulating them to become industrious\r\ncitizens in permanent homes, instead of following a roving and savage\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n9. The commission will keep such records or minutes of their proceedings\r\nas may be necessary to afford evidence of their action, and will provide\r\nfor the manner in which their communications with and advice to the\r\nGovernment shall be made and authenticated.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the Daily Morning Chronicle, Washington, September 8, 1869.]\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, _Washington, September 7, 1869_.

We are blessed with peace at home, and are without\r\nentangling alliances abroad to forebode trouble; with a territory\r\nunsurpassed in fertility, of an area equal to the abundant support of\r\n500,000,000 people, and abounding in every variety of useful mineral in\r\nquantity sufficient to supply the world for generations; with exuberant\r\ncrops; with a variety of climate adapted to the production of every\r\nspecies of earth's riches and suited to the habits, tastes, and\r\nrequirements of every living thing; with a population of 40,000,000 free\r\npeople, all speaking one language; with facilities for every mortal to\r\nacquire an education; with institutions closing to none the avenues to\r\nfame or any blessing of fortune that may be coveted; with freedom of\r\nthe pulpit, the press, and the school; with a revenue flowing into the\r\nNational Treasury beyond the requirements of the Government. Happily,\r\nharmony is being rapidly restored within our own borders. Manufactures\r\nhitherto unknown in our country are springing up in all sections,\r\nproducing a degree of national independence unequaled by that of any\r\nother power.\r\n\r\nThese blessings and countless others are intrusted to your care and\r\nmine for safe-keeping for the brief period of our tenure of office.\r\nIn a short time we must, each of us, return to the ranks of the people,\r\nwho have conferred upon us our honors, and account to them for our\r\nstewardship. I earnestly desire that neither you nor I may be condemned\r\nby a free and enlightened constituency nor by our own consciences.\r\n\r\nEmerging from a rebellion of gigantic magnitude, aided, as it was,\r\nby the sympathies and assistance of nations with which we were at\r\npeace, eleven States of the Union were, four years ago, left without\r\nlegal State governments. A national debt had been contracted; American\r\ncommerce was almost driven from the seas; the industry of one-half of\r\nthe country had been taken from the control of the capitalist and placed\r\nwhere all labor rightfully belongs--in the keeping of the laborer. The\r\nwork of restoring State governments loyal to the Union, of protecting\r\nand fostering free labor, and providing means for paying the interest\r\non the public debt has received ample attention from Congress. Although\r\nyour efforts have not met with the success in all particulars that might\r\nhave been desired, yet on the whole they have been more successful than\r\ncould have been reasonably anticipated.\r\n\r\nSeven States which passed ordinances of secession have been fully\r\nrestored to their places in the Union. The eighth (Georgia) held an\r\nelection at which she ratified her constitution, republican in form,\r\nelected a governor, Members of Congress, a State legislature, and all\r\nother officers required. The governor was duly installed, and the\r\nlegislature met and performed all the acts then required of them by the\r\nreconstruction acts of Congress. Subsequently, however, in violation of\r\nthe constitution which they had just ratified (as since decided by the\r\nsupreme court of the State), they unseated the colored members of the\r\nlegislature and admitted to seats some members who are disqualified by\r\nthe third clause of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution--an\r\narticle which they themselves had contributed to ratify. Under these\r\ncircumstances I would submit to you whether it would not be wise,\r\nwithout delay, to enact a law authorizing the governor of Georgia to\r\nconvene the members originally elected to the legislature, requiring\r\neach member to take the oath prescribed by the reconstruction acts, and\r\nnone to be admitted who are ineligible under the third clause of the\r\nfourteenth amendment.\r\n\r\nThe freedmen, under the protection which they have received, are making\r\nrapid progress in learning, and no complaints are heard of lack of\r\nindustry on their part where they receive fair remuneration for their\r\nlabor. The means provided for paying the interest on the public debt,\r\nwith all other expenses of Government, are more than ample. The loss\r\nof our commerce is the only result of the late rebellion which has not\r\nreceived sufficient attention from you. To this subject I call your\r\nearnest attention. I will not now suggest plans by which this object may\r\nbe effected, but will, if necessary, make it the subject of a special\r\nmessage during the session of Congress.\r\n\r\nAt the March term Congress by joint resolution authorized the Executive\r\nto order elections in the States of Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas, to\r\nsubmit to them the constitutions which each had previously, in convention,\r\nframed, and submit the constitutions, either entire or in separate\r\nparts, to be voted upon, at the discretion of the Executive. Under this\r\nauthority elections were called. In Virginia the election took place on\r\nthe 6th of July, 1869. The governor and lieutenant-governor elected\r\nhave been installed. The legislature met and did all required by this\r\nresolution and by all the reconstruction acts of Congress, and abstained\r\nfrom all doubtful authority. I recommend that her Senators and\r\nRepresentatives be promptly admitted to their seats, and that the State\r\nbe fully restored to its place in the family of States. Elections were\r\ncalled in Mississippi and Texas, to commence on the 30th of November,\r\n1869, and to last two days in Mississippi and four days in Texas. The\r\nelections have taken place, but the result is not known. It is to be\r\nhoped that the acts of the legislatures of these States, when they meet,\r\nwill be such as to receive your approval, and thus close the work of\r\nreconstruction.\r\n\r\nAmong the evils growing out of the rebellion, and not yet referred to,\r\nis that of an irredeemable currency. It is an evil which I hope will\r\nreceive your most earnest attention. It is a duty, and one of the\r\nhighest duties, of Government to secure to the citizen a medium of\r\nexchange of fixed, unvarying value. This implies a return to a specie\r\nbasis, and no substitute for it can be devised. It should be commenced\r\nnow and reached at the earliest practicable moment consistent with a\r\nfair regard to the interests of the debtor class. Immediate resumption,\r\nif practicable, would not be desirable. It would compel the debtor class\r\nto pay, beyond their contracts, the premium on gold at the date of their\r\npurchase, and would bring bankruptcy and ruin to thousands. Fluctuation,\r\nhowever, in the paper value of the measure of all values (gold) is\r\ndetrimental to the interests of trade. It makes the man of business an\r\ninvoluntary gambler, for in all sales where future payment is to be made\r\nboth parties speculate as to what will be the value of the currency\r\nto be paid and received. I earnestly recommend to you, then, such\r\nlegislation as will insure a gradual return to specie payments and put\r\nan immediate stop to fluctuations in the value of currency.\r\n\r\nThe methods to secure the former of these results are as numerous as are\r\nthe speculators on political economy. To secure the latter I see but one\r\nway, and that is to authorize the Treasury to redeem its own paper, at\r\na fixed price, whenever presented, and to withhold from circulation all\r\ncurrency so redeemed until sold again for gold.\r\n\r\nThe vast resources of the nation, both developed and undeveloped, ought\r\nto make our credit the best on earth. With a less burden of taxation\r\nthan the citizen has endured for six years past, the entire public debt\r\ncould be paid in ten years. But it is not desirable that the people\r\nshould be taxed to pay it in that time. Year by year the ability to pay\r\nincreases in a rapid ratio. But the burden of interest ought to be\r\nreduced as rapidly as can be done without the violation of contract.\r\nThe public debt is represented in great part by bonds having from five\r\nto twenty and from ten to forty years to run, bearing interest at the\r\nrate of 6 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively. It is optional with the\r\nGovernment to pay these bonds at any period after the expiration of the\r\nleast time mentioned upon their face. The time has already expired when\r\na great part of them may be taken up, and is rapidly approaching when\r\nall may be. It is believed that all which are now due may be replaced by\r\nbonds bearing a rate of interest not exceeding 4-1/2 per cent, and as\r\nrapidly as the remainder become due that they may be replaced in the\r\nsame way. To accomplish this it may be necessary to authorize the\r\ninterest to be paid at either of three or four of the money centers\r\nof Europe, or by any assistant treasurer of the United States, at\r\nthe option of the holder of the bond. I suggest this subject for the\r\nconsideration of Congress, and also, simultaneously with this, the\r\npropriety of redeeming our currency, as before suggested, at its market\r\nvalue at the time the law goes into effect, increasing the rate at which\r\ncurrency shall be bought and sold from day to day or week to week, at\r\nthe same rate of interest as Government pays upon its bonds.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of tariff and internal taxation will necessarily receive\r\nyour attention. The revenues of the country are greater than the\r\nrequirements, and may with safety be reduced. But as the funding of\r\nthe debt in a 4 or a 4-1/2 per cent loan would reduce annual current\r\nexpenses largely, thus, after funding, justifying a greater reduction\r\nof taxation than would be now expedient, I suggest postponement of this\r\nquestion until the next meeting of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt may be advisable to modify taxation and tariff in instances where\r\nunjust or burdensome discriminations are made by the present laws, but\r\na general revision of the laws regulating this subject I recommend the\r\npostponement of for the present. I also suggest the renewal of the tax\r\non incomes, but at a reduced rate, say of 3 per cent, and this tax to\r\nexpire in three years.\r\n\r\nWith the funding of the national debt, as here suggested, I feel safe in\r\nsaying that taxes and the revenue from imports may be reduced safely\r\nfrom sixty to eighty millions per annum at once, and may be still\r\nfurther reduced from year to year, as the resources of the country are\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury shows the receipts of the\r\nGovernment for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1869, to be $370,943,747,\r\nand the expenditures, including interest, bounties, etc., to be\r\n$321,490,597. The estimates for the ensuing year are more favorable to\r\nthe Government, and will no doubt show a much larger decrease of the\r\npublic debt.\r\n\r\nThe receipts in the Treasury beyond expenditures have exceeded\r\nthe amount necessary to place to the credit of the sinking fund, as\r\nprovided by law. To lock up the surplus in the Treasury and withhold it\r\nfrom circulation would lead to such a contraction of the currency as to\r\ncripple trade and seriously affect the prosperity of the country. Under\r\nthese circumstances the Secretary of the Treasury and myself heartily\r\nconcurred in the propriety of using all the surplus currency in the\r\nTreasury in the purchase of Government bonds, thus reducing the\r\ninterest-bearing indebtedness of the country, and of submitting to\r\nCongress the question of the disposition to be made of the bonds\r\nso purchased. The bonds now held by the Treasury amount to about\r\nseventy-five millions, including those belonging to the sinking fund.\r\nI recommend that the whole be placed to the credit of the sinking fund.\r\n\r\nYour attention is respectfully invited to the recommendations of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury for the creation of the office of commissioner\r\nof customs revenue; for the increase of salaries to certain classes of\r\nofficials; the substitution of increased national-bank circulation to\r\nreplace the outstanding 3 per cent certificates; and most especially to\r\nhis recommendation for the repeal of laws allowing shares of fines,\r\npenalties, forfeitures, etc., to officers of the Government or to\r\ninformers.\r\n\r\nThe office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue is one of the most\r\narduous and responsible under the Government. It falls but little, if\r\nany, short of a Cabinet position in its importance and responsibilities.\r\nI would ask for it, therefore, such legislation as in your judgment\r\nwill place the office upon a footing of dignity commensurate with its\r\nimportance and with the character and qualifications of the class of\r\nmen required to fill it properly.\r\n\r\nAs the United States is the freest of all nations, so, too, its people\r\nsympathize with all people struggling for liberty and self-government;\r\nbut while so sympathizing it is due to our honor that we should abstain\r\nfrom enforcing our views upon unwilling nations and from taking an\r\ninterested part, _without invitation_, in the quarrels between different\r\nnations or between governments and their subjects. Our course should\r\nalways be in conformity with strict justice and law, international and\r\nlocal. Such has been the policy of the Administration in dealing with\r\nthese questions. For more than a year a valuable province of Spain, and\r\na near neighbor of ours, in whom all our people can not but feel a deep\r\ninterest, has been struggling for independence and freedom. The people\r\nand Government of the United States entertain the same warm feelings\r\nand sympathies for the people of Cuba in their pending struggle that\r\nthey manifested throughout the previous struggles between Spain and\r\nher former colonies in behalf of the latter. But the contest has at\r\nno time assumed the conditions which amount to a war in the sense of\r\ninternational law, or which would show the existence of a _de facto_\r\npolitical organization of the insurgents sufficient to justify a\r\nrecognition of belligerency.\r\n\r\nThe principle is maintained, however, that this nation is its own judge\r\nwhen to accord the rights of belligerency, either to a people struggling\r\nto free themselves from a government they believe to be oppressive or to\r\nindependent nations at war with each other.\r\n\r\nThe United States have no disposition to interfere with the existing\r\nrelations of Spain to her colonial possessions on this continent. They\r\nbelieve that in due time Spain and other European powers will find their\r\ninterest in terminating those relations and establishing their present\r\ndependencies as independent powers--members of the family of nations.\r\nThese dependencies are no longer regarded as subject to transfer from\r\none European power to another. When the present relation of colonies\r\nceases, they are to become independent powers, exercising the right of\r\nchoice and of self-control in the determination of their future\r\ncondition and relations with other powers.\r\n\r\nThe United States, in order to put a stop to bloodshed in Cuba, and in\r\nthe interest of a neighboring people, proposed their good offices to\r\nbring the existing contest to a termination. The offer, not being\r\naccepted by Spain on a basis which we believed could be received by\r\nCuba, was withdrawn. It is hoped that the good offices of the United\r\nStates may yet prove advantageous for the settlement of this unhappy\r\nstrife. Meanwhile a number of illegal expeditions against Cuba have been\r\nbroken up. It has been the endeavor of the Administration to execute the\r\nneutrality laws in good faith, no matter how unpleasant the task, made\r\nso by the sufferings we have endured from lack of like good faith toward\r\nus by other nations.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of March last the United States schooner _Lizzie Major_ was\r\narrested on the high seas by a Spanish frigate, and two passengers taken\r\nfrom it and carried as prisoners to Cuba. Representations of these facts\r\nwere made to the Spanish Government as soon as official information of\r\nthem reached Washington. The two passengers were set at liberty, and the\r\nSpanish Government assured the United States that the captain of the\r\nfrigate in making the capture had acted without law, that he had been\r\nreprimanded for the irregularity of his conduct, and that the Spanish\r\nauthorities in Cuba would not sanction any act that could violate the\r\nrights or treat with disrespect the sovereignty of this nation.\r\n\r\nThe question of the seizure of the brig _Mary Lowell_ at one of\r\nthe Bahama Islands by Spanish authorities is now the subject of\r\ncorrespondence between this Government and those of Spain and Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nThe Captain-General of Cuba about May last issued a proclamation\r\nauthorizing search to be made of vessels on the high seas. Immediate\r\nremonstrance was made against this, whereupon the Captain-General issued\r\na new proclamation limiting the right of search to vessels of the United\r\nStates so far as authorized under the treaty of 1795. This proclamation,\r\nhowever, was immediately withdrawn.\r\n\r\nI have always felt that the most intimate relations should be cultivated\r\nbetween the Republic of the United States and all independent nations on\r\nthis continent. It may be well worth considering whether new treaties\r\nbetween us and them may not be profitably entered into, to secure more\r\nintimate relations--friendly, commercial, and otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe subject of an interoceanic canal to connect the Atlantic and Pacific\r\noceans through the Isthmus of Darien is one in which commerce is greatly\r\ninterested. Instructions have been given to our minister to the Republic\r\nof the United States of Colombia to endeavor to obtain authority for a\r\nsurvey by this Government, in order to determine the practicability of\r\nsuch an undertaking, and a charter for the right of way to build, by\r\nprivate enterprise, such a work, if the survey proves it to be\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\nIn order to comply with the agreement of the United States as to a\r\nmixed commission at Lima for the adjustment of claims, it became\r\nnecessary to send a commissioner and secretary to Lima in August last.\r\nNo appropriation having been made by Congress for this purpose, it is\r\nnow asked that one be made covering the past and future expenses of the\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nThe good offices of the United States to bring about a peace between\r\nSpain and the South American Republics with which she is at war having\r\nbeen accepted by Spain, Peru, and Chile, a congress has been invited to\r\nbe held in Washington during the present winter.\r\n\r\nA grant has been given to Europeans of an exclusive right of transit\r\nover the territory of Nicaragua, to which Costa Rica has given its\r\nassent, which, it is alleged, conflicts with vested rights of citizens\r\nof the United States. The Department of State has now this subject under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe minister of Peru having made representations that there was a state\r\nof war between Peru and Spain, and that Spain was constructing, in and\r\nnear New York, thirty gunboats, which might be used by Spain in such a\r\nway as to relieve the naval force at Cuba, so as to operate against\r\nPeru, orders were given to prevent their departure. No further steps\r\nhaving been taken by the representative of the Peruvian Government to\r\nprevent the departure of these vessels, and I not feeling authorized to\r\ndetain the property of a nation with which we are at peace on a mere\r\nExecutive order, the matter has been referred to the courts to decide.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the war between the allies and the Republic of Paraguay\r\nhas made the intercourse with that country so difficult that it has been\r\ndeemed advisable to withdraw our representative from there.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the last Administration a convention was\r\nsigned at London for the settlement of all outstanding claims between\r\nGreat Britain and the United States, which failed to receive the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate to its ratification. The time and the\r\ncircumstances attending the negotiation of that treaty were unfavorable\r\nto its acceptance by the people of the United States, and its provisions\r\nwere wholly inadequate for the settlement of the grave wrongs that had\r\nbeen sustained by this Government, as well as by its citizens. The\r\ninjuries resulting to the United States by reason of the course adopted\r\nby Great Britain during our late civil war--in the increased rates\r\nof insurance; in the diminution of exports and imports, and other\r\nobstructions to domestic industry and production; in its effect upon the\r\nforeign commerce of the country; in the decrease and transfer to Great\r\nBritain of our commercial marine; in the prolongation of the war and the\r\nincreased cost (both in treasure and in lives) of its suppression--could\r\nnot be adjusted and satisfied as ordinary commercial claims, which\r\ncontinually arise between commercial nations; and yet the convention\r\ntreated them simply as such ordinary claims, from which they differ more\r\nwidely in the gravity of their character than in the magnitude of their\r\namount, great even as is that difference. Not a word was found in the\r\ntreaty, and not an inference could be drawn from it, to remove the sense\r\nof the unfriendliness of the course of Great Britain in our struggle for\r\nexistence, which had so deeply and universally impressed itself upon the\r\npeople of this country.\r\n\r\nBelieving that a convention thus misconceived in its scope and\r\ninadequate in its provisions would not have produced the hearty, cordial\r\nsettlement of pending questions, which alone is consistent with the\r\nrelations which I desire to have firmly established between the United\r\nStates and Great Britain, I regarded the action of the Senate in\r\nrejecting the treaty to have been wisely taken in the interest of peace\r\nand as a necessary step in the direction of a perfect and cordial\r\nfriendship between the two countries. A sensitive people, conscious of\r\ntheir power, are more at ease under a great wrong wholly unatoned than\r\nunder the restraint of a settlement which satisfies neither their ideas\r\nof justice nor their grave sense of the grievance they have sustained.\r\nThe rejection of the treaty was followed by a state of public feeling on\r\nboth sides which I thought not favorable to an immediate attempt at\r\nrenewed negotiations. I accordingly so instructed the minister of the\r\nUnited States to Great Britain, and found that my views in this regard\r\nwere shared by Her Majesty's ministers. I hope that the time may soon\r\narrive when the two Governments can approach the solution of this\r\nmomentous question with an appreciation of what is due to the rights,\r\ndignity, and honor of each, and with the determination not only to\r\nremove the causes of complaint in the past, but to lay the foundation of\r\na broad principle of public law which will prevent future differences\r\nand tend to firm and continued peace and friendship.\r\n\r\nThis is now the only grave question which the United States has with any\r\nforeign nation.\r\n\r\nThe question of renewing a treaty for reciprocal trade between the\r\nUnited States and the British Provinces on this continent has not been\r\nfavorably considered by the Administration. The advantages of such a\r\ntreaty would be wholly in favor of the British producer. Except,\r\npossibly, a few engaged in the trade between the two sections, no\r\ncitizen of the United States would be benefited by reciprocity. Our\r\ninternal taxation would prove a protection to the British producer\r\nalmost equal to the protection which our manufacturers now receive from\r\nthe tariff. Some arrangement, however, for the regulation of commercial\r\nintercourse between the United States and the Dominion of Canada may be\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nThe commission for adjusting the claims of the \"Hudsons Bay and Puget\r\nSound Agricultural Company\" upon the United States has terminated\r\nits labors. The award of $650,000 has been made and all rights and\r\ntitles of the company on the territory of the United States have been\r\nextinguished. Deeds for the property of the company have been delivered.\r\nAn appropriation by Congress to meet this sum is asked.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners for determining the northwestern land boundary between\r\nthe United States and the British possessions under the treaty of 1856\r\nhave completed their labors, and the commission has been dissolved.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the recommendation of Congress, a proposition was\r\nearly made to the British Government to abolish the mixed courts created\r\nunder the treaty of April 7, 1862, for the suppression of the slave\r\ntrade. The subject is still under negotiation.\r\n\r\nIt having come to my knowledge that a corporate company, organized under\r\nBritish laws, proposed to land upon the shores of the United States and\r\nto operate there a submarine cable, under a concession from His Majesty\r\nthe Emperor of the French of an exclusive right for twenty years of\r\ntelegraphic communication between the shores of France and the United\r\nStates, with the very objectionable feature of subjecting all messages\r\nconveyed thereby to the scrutiny and control of the French Government,\r\nI caused the French and British legations at Washington to be made\r\nacquainted with the probable policy of Congress on this subject, as\r\nforeshadowed by the bill which passed the Senate in March last. This\r\ndrew from the representatives of the company an agreement to accept as\r\nthe basis of their operations the provisions of that bill, or of such\r\nother enactment on the subject as might be passed during the approaching\r\nsession of Congress; also, to use their influence to secure from the\r\nFrench Government a modification of their concession, so as to permit\r\nthe landing upon French soil of any cable belonging to any company\r\nincorporated by the authority of the United States or of any State in\r\nthe Union, and, on their part, not to oppose the establishment of any\r\nsuch cable. In consideration of this agreement I directed the withdrawal\r\nof all opposition by the United States authorities to the landing of the\r\ncable and to the working of it until the meeting of Congress. I regret\r\nto say that there has been no modification made in the company's\r\nconcession, nor, so far as I can learn, have they attempted to secure\r\none. Their concession excludes the capital and the citizens of the\r\nUnited States from competition upon the shores of France. I recommend\r\nlegislation to protect the rights of citizens of the United States,\r\nas well as the dignity and sovereignty of the nation, against such\r\nan assumption. I shall also endeavor to secure, by negotiation, an\r\nabandonment of the principle of monopolies in ocean telegraphic cables.\r\nCopies of this correspondence are herewith furnished.\r\n\r\nThe unsettled political condition of other countries, less fortunate\r\nthan our own, sometimes induces their citizens to come to the United\r\nStates for the sole purpose of becoming naturalized. Having secured\r\nthis, they return to their native country and reside there, without\r\ndisclosing their change of allegiance. They accept official positions of\r\ntrust or honor, which can only be held by citizens of their native land;\r\nthey journey under passports describing them as such citizens; and it\r\nis only when civil discord, after perhaps years of quiet, threatens\r\ntheir persons or their property, or when their native state drafts them\r\ninto its military service, that the fact of their change of allegiance\r\nis made known. They reside permanently away from the United States,\r\nthey contribute nothing to its revenues, they avoid the duties of\r\nits citizenship, and they only make themselves known by a claim of\r\nprotection. I have directed the diplomatic and consular officers of the\r\nUnited States to scrutinize carefully all such claims for protection.\r\nThe citizen of the United States, whether native or adopted, who\r\ndischarges his duty to his country, is entitled to its complete\r\nprotection. While I have a voice in the direction of affairs I shall not\r\nconsent to imperil this sacred right by conferring it upon fictitious or\r\nfraudulent claimants.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of the present Administration it was found that the\r\nminister for North Germany had made propositions for the negotiation\r\nof a convention for the protection of emigrant passengers, to which no\r\nresponse had been given. It was concluded that to be effectual all the\r\nmaritime powers engaged in the trade should join in such a measure.\r\nInvitations have been extended to the cabinets of London, Paris,\r\nFlorence, Berlin, Brussels, The Hague, Copenhagen, and Stockholm to\r\nempower their representatives at Washington to simultaneously enter\r\ninto negotiations and to conclude with the United States conventions\r\nidentical in form, making uniform regulations as to the construction of\r\nthe parts of vessels to be devoted to the use of emigrant passengers, as\r\nto the quality and quantity of food, as to the medical treatment of the\r\nsick, and as to the rules to be observed during the voyage, in order\r\nto secure ventilation, to promote health, to prevent intrusion, and to\r\nprotect the females; and providing for the establishment of tribunals in\r\nthe several countries for enforcing such regulations by summary process.\r\n\r\nYour attention is respectfully called to the law regulating the tariff\r\non Russian hemp, and to the question whether to fix the charges on\r\nRussian hemp higher than they are fixed upon manila is not a violation\r\nof our treaty with Russia placing her products upon the same footing\r\nwith those of the most favored nations.\r\n\r\nOur manufactures are increasing with wonderful rapidity under the\r\nencouragement which they now receive. With the improvements in machinery\r\nalready effected, and still increasing, causing machinery to take the\r\nplace of skilled labor to a large extent, our imports of many articles\r\nmust fall off largely within a very few years. Fortunately, too,\r\nmanufactures are not confined to a few localities, as formerly, and it\r\nis to be hoped will become more and more diffused, making the interest\r\nin them equal in all sections. They give employment and support to\r\nhundreds of thousands of people at home, and retain with us the means\r\nwhich otherwise would be shipped abroad. The extension of railroads in\r\nEurope and the East is bringing into competition with our agricultural\r\nproducts like products of other countries. Self-interest, if not\r\nself-preservation, therefore dictates caution against disturbing any\r\nindustrial interest of the country. It teaches us also the necessity of\r\nlooking to other markets for the sale of our surplus. Our neighbors\r\nsouth of us, and China and Japan, should receive our special attention.\r\nIt will be the endeavor of the Administration to cultivate such\r\nrelations with all these nations as to entitle us to their confidence\r\nand make it their interest, as well as ours, to establish better\r\ncommercial relations.\r\n\r\nThrough the agency of a more enlightened policy than that heretofore\r\npursued toward China, largely due to the sagacity and efforts of one of\r\nour own distinguished citizens, the world is about to commence largely\r\nincreased relations with that populous and hitherto exclusive nation.\r\nAs the United States have been the initiators in this new policy, so\r\nthey should be the most earnest in showing their good faith in making it\r\na success. In this connection I advise such legislation as will forever\r\npreclude the enslavement of the Chinese upon our soil under the name\r\nof coolies, and also prevent American vessels from engaging in the\r\ntransportation of coolies to any country tolerating the system. I also\r\nrecommend that the mission to China be raised to one of the first class.\r\n\r\nOn my assuming the responsible duties of Chief Magistrate of the United\r\nStates it was with the conviction that three things were essential to\r\nits peace, prosperity, and fullest development. First among these is\r\nstrict integrity in fulfilling all our obligations; second, to secure\r\nprotection to the person and property of the citizen of the United\r\nStates in each and every portion of our common country, wherever he may\r\nchoose to move, without reference to original nationality, religion,\r\ncolor, or politics, demanding of him only obedience to the laws and\r\nproper respect for the rights of others; third, union of all the States,\r\nwith equal rights, indestructible by any constitutional means.\r\n\r\nTo secure the first of these, Congress has taken two essential steps:\r\nFirst, in declaring by joint resolution that the public debt shall be\r\npaid, principal and interest, in coin; and, second, by providing the\r\nmeans for paying. Providing the means, however, could not secure the\r\nobject desired without a proper administration of the laws for the\r\ncollection of the revenues and an economical disbursement of them.\r\nTo this subject the Administration has most earnestly addressed\r\nitself, with results, I hope, satisfactory to the country. There has\r\nbeen no hesitation in changing officials in order to secure an efficient\r\nexecution of the laws, sometimes, too, when, in a mere party view,\r\nundesirable political results were likely to follow; nor any hesitation\r\nin sustaining efficient officials against remonstrances wholly\r\npolitical.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to mention here the embarrassment possible to arise from\r\nleaving on the statute books the so-called \"tenure-of-office acts,\" and\r\nto earnestly recommend their total repeal. It could not have been the\r\nintention of the framers of the Constitution, when providing that\r\nappointments made by the President should receive the consent of the\r\nSenate, that the latter should have the power to retain in office\r\npersons placed there by Federal appointment against the will of the\r\nPresident. The law is inconsistent with a faithful and efficient\r\nadministration of the Government. What faith can an Executive put in\r\nofficials forced upon him, and those, too, whom he has suspended for\r\nreason? How will such officials be likely to serve an Administration\r\nwhich they know does not trust them?\r\n\r\nFor the second requisite to our growth and prosperity time and a firm\r\nbut humane administration of existing laws (amended from time to time as\r\nthey may prove ineffective or prove harsh and unnecessary) are probably\r\nall that are required.\r\n\r\nThe third can not be attained by special legislation, but must be\r\nregarded as fixed by the Constitution itself and gradually acquiesced in\r\nby force of public opinion.\r\n\r\nFrom the foundation of the Government to the present the management\r\nof the original inhabitants of this continent--the Indians--has been\r\na subject of embarrassment and expense, and has been attended with\r\ncontinuous robberies, murders, and wars. From my own experience upon\r\nthe frontiers and in Indian countries, I do not hold either legislation\r\nor the conduct of the whites who come most in contact with the Indian\r\nblameless for these hostilities. The past, however, can not be undone,\r\nand the question must be met as we now find it. I have attempted a new\r\npolicy toward these wards of the nation (they can not be regarded in any\r\nother light than as wards), with fair results so far as tried, and which\r\nI hope will be attended ultimately with great success. The Society of\r\nFriends is well known as having succeeded in living in peace with the\r\nIndians in the early settlement of Pennsylvania, while their white\r\nneighbors of other sects in other sections were constantly embroiled.\r\nThey are also known for their opposition to all strife, violence,\r\nand war, and are generally noted for their strict integrity and fair\r\ndealings. These considerations induced me to give the management of\r\na few reservations of Indians to them and to throw the burden of the\r\nselection of agents upon the society itself. The result has proven most\r\nsatisfactory. It will De found more fully set forth in the report of the\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs. For superintendents and Indian agents\r\nnot on the reservations, officers of the Army were selected. The reasons\r\nfor this are numerous. Where Indian agents are sent, there, or near\r\nthere, troops must be sent also. The agent and the commander of troops\r\nare independent of each other, and are subject to orders from different\r\nDepartments of the Government. The army officer holds a position for\r\nlife; the agent, one at the will of the President. The former is\r\npersonally interested in living in harmony with the Indian and in\r\nestablishing a permanent peace, to the end that some portion of his life\r\nmay be spent within the limits of civilized society; the latter has no\r\nsuch personal interest. Another reason is an economic one; and still\r\nanother, the hold which the Government has upon a life officer to secure\r\na faithful discharge of duties in carrying out a given policy.\r\n\r\nThe building of railroads, and the access thereby given to all the\r\nagricultural and mineral regions of the country, is rapidly bringing\r\ncivilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of Indians. No\r\nmatter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the\r\naborigines, the fact is they do not harmonize well, and one or the other\r\nhas to give way in the end. A system which looks to the extinction of a\r\nrace is too horrible for a nation to adopt without entailing upon itself\r\nthe wrath of all Christendom and engendering in the citizen a disregard\r\nfor human life and the rights of others, dangerous to society. I see no\r\nsubstitute for such a system, except in placing all the Indians on large\r\nreservations, as rapidly as it can be done, and giving them absolute\r\nprotection there. As soon as they are fitted for it they should be\r\ninduced to take their lands in severalty and to set up Territorial\r\ngovernments for their own protection. For full details on this subject\r\nI call your special attention to the reports of the Secretary of the\r\nInterior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War shows the expenditures of the War\r\nDepartment for the year ending June 30, 1869, to be $80,644,042, of\r\nwhich $23,882,310 was disbursed in the payment of debts contracted\r\nduring the war, and is not chargeable to current army expenses. His\r\nestimate of $34,531,031 for the expenses of the Army for the next fiscal\r\nyear is as low as it is believed can be relied on. The estimates of\r\nbureau officers have been carefully scrutinized, and reduced wherever it\r\nhas been deemed practicable. If, however, the condition of the country\r\nshould be such by the beginning of the next fiscal year as to admit of a\r\ngreater concentration of troops, the appropriation asked for will not be\r\nexpended.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations estimated for river and harbor improvements and for\r\nfortifications are submitted separately. Whatever amount Congress may\r\ndeem proper to appropriate for these purposes will be expended.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation of the General of the Army that appropriations be\r\nmade for the forts at Boston, Portland, New York, Philadelphia, New\r\nOrleans, and San Francisco, if for no other, is concurred in. I also ask\r\nyour special attention to the recommendation of the general commanding\r\nthe Military Division of the Pacific for the sale of the seal islands of\r\nSt. Paul and St. George, Alaska Territory, and suggest that it either be\r\ncomplied with or that legislation be had for the protection of the seal\r\nfisheries from which a revenue should be derived.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War contains a synopsis of the reports of\r\nthe heads of bureaus, of the commanders of military divisions, and of\r\nthe districts of Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas, and the report of the\r\nGeneral of the Army in full. The recommendations therein contained have\r\nbeen well considered, and are submitted for your action. I, however,\r\ncall special attention to the recommendation of the Chief of Ordnance\r\nfor the sale of arsenals and lands no longer of use to the Government;\r\nalso, to the recommendation of the Secretary of War that the act of 3d\r\nMarch, 1869, prohibiting promotions and appointments in the staff corps\r\nof the Army, be repealed. The extent of country to be garrisoned and the\r\nnumber of military posts to be occupied is the same with a reduced Army\r\nas with a large one. The number of staff officers required is more\r\ndependent upon the latter than the former condition.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy accompanying this shows the\r\ncondition of the Navy when this Administration came into office and the\r\nchanges made since. Strenuous efforts have been made to place as many\r\nvessels \"in commission,\" or render them fit for service if required, as\r\npossible, and to substitute the sail for steam while cruising, thus\r\nmaterially reducing the expenses of the Navy and adding greatly to its\r\nefficiency. Looking to our future, I recommend a liberal, though not\r\nextravagant, policy toward this branch of the public service.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General furnishes a clear and comprehensive\r\nexhibit of the operations of the postal service and of the financial\r\ncondition of the Post Office Department. The ordinary postal revenues\r\nfor the year ending the 30th of June, 1869, amounted to $18,344,510, and\r\nthe expenditures to $23,698,131, showing an excess of expenditures over\r\nreceipts of $5,353,620. The excess of expenditures over receipts for the\r\nprevious year amounted to $6,437,992. The increase of revenues for 1869\r\nover those of 1868 was $2,051,909, and the increase of expenditures was\r\n$967,538. The increased revenue in 1869 exceeded the increased revenue\r\nin 1868 by $996,336, and the increased expenditure in 1869 was\r\n$2,527,570 less than the increased expenditure in 1868, showing by\r\ncomparison this gratifying feature of improvement, that while the\r\nincrease of expenditures over the increase of receipts in 1868 was\r\n$2,439,535, the increase of receipts over the increase of expenditures\r\nin 1869 was $1,084,371.\r\n\r\nYour attention is respectfully called to the recommendations made by the\r\nPostmaster-General for authority to change the rate of compensation to\r\nthe main trunk railroad lines for their services in carrying the mails;\r\nfor having post-route maps executed; for reorganizing and increasing the\r\nefficiency of the special-agency service; for increase of the mail\r\nservice on the Pacific, and for establishing mail service, under the\r\nflag of the Union, on the Atlantic; and most especially do I call your\r\nattention to his recommendation for the total abolition of the franking\r\nprivilege. This is an abuse from which no one receives a commensurate\r\nadvantage; it reduces the receipts for postal service from 25 to 30 per\r\ncent and largely increases the service to be performed. The method by\r\nwhich postage should be paid upon public matter is set forth fully in\r\nthe report of the Postmaster-General.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior shows that the quantity of\r\npublic lands disposed of during the year ending the 30th of June, 1869,\r\nwas 7,666,152 acres, exceeding that of the preceding year by 1,010,409\r\nacres. Of this amount 2,899,544 acres were sold for cash and 2,737,365\r\nacres entered under the homestead laws. The remainder was granted to aid\r\nin the construction of works of internal improvement, approved to the\r\nStates as swamp land, and located with warrants and scrip. The cash\r\nreceipts from all sources were $4,472,886, exceeding those of the\r\npreceding year $2,840,140.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year 23,196 names were added to the pension rolls\r\nand 4,876 dropped therefrom, leaving at its close 187,963. The amount\r\npaid to pensioners, including the compensation of disbursing agents, was\r\n$28,422,884, an increase of $4,411,902 on that of the previous year.\r\nThe munificence of Congress has been conspicuously manifested in its\r\nlegislation for the soldiers and sailors who suffered in the recent\r\nstruggle to maintain \"that unity of government which makes us one\r\npeople.\" The additions to the pension rolls of each successive year\r\nsince the conclusion of hostilities result in a great degree from the\r\nrepeated amendments of the act of the 14th of July, 1862, which extended\r\nits provisions to cases not falling within its original scope. The large\r\noutlay which is thus occasioned is further increased by the more liberal\r\nallowance bestowed since that date upon those who in the line of duty\r\nwere wholly or permanently disabled. Public opinion has given an\r\nemphatic sanction to these measures of Congress, and it will be conceded\r\nthat no part of our public burden is more cheerfully borne than that\r\nwhich is imposed by this branch of the service. It necessitates for the\r\nnext fiscal year, in addition to the amount justly chargeable to the\r\nnaval pension fund, an appropriation of $30,000,000.\r\n\r\nDuring the year ending the 30th of September, 1869, the Patent Office\r\nissued 13,762 patents, and its receipts were $686,389, being $213,926\r\nmore than the expenditures.\r\n\r\nI would respectfully call your attention to the recommendation of the\r\nSecretary of the Interior for uniting the duties of supervising the\r\neducation of freedmen with the other duties devolving upon the\r\nCommissioner of Education.\r\n\r\nIf it is the desire of Congress to make the census which must be taken\r\nduring the year 1870 more complete and perfect than heretofore, I would\r\nsuggest early action upon any plan that may be agreed upon. As Congress\r\nat the last session appointed a committee to take into consideration\r\nsuch measures as might be deemed proper in reference to the census and\r\nreport a plan, I desist from saying more.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your favorable consideration the claims of the\r\nAgricultural Bureau for liberal appropriations. In a country so\r\ndiversified in climate and soil as ours, and with a population so\r\nlargely dependent upon agriculture, the benefits that can be conferred\r\nby properly fostering this Bureau are incalculable.\r\n\r\nI desire respectfully to call the attention of Congress to the\r\ninadequate salaries of a number of the most important offices of the\r\nGovernment. In this message I will not enumerate them, but will specify\r\nonly the justices of the Supreme Court. No change has been made in their\r\nsalaries for fifteen years. Within that time the labors of the court\r\nhave largely increased and the expenses of living have at least doubled.\r\nDuring the same time Congress has twice found it necessary to increase\r\nlargely the compensation of its own members, and the duty which it owes\r\nto another department of the Government deserves, and will undoubtedly\r\nreceive, its due consideration.\r\n\r\nThere are many subjects not alluded to in this message which might with\r\npropriety be introduced, but I abstain, believing that your patriotism\r\nand statesmanship will suggest the topics and the legislation most\r\nconducive to the interests of the whole people. On my part I promise\r\na rigid adherence to the laws and their strict enforcement.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 6, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, an additional article to the convention of the 24th of\r\nOctober, 1867, between the United States of America and His Majesty the\r\nKing of Denmark.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 6, 1869_\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a convention between the United States and His Hawaiian\r\nMajesty, signed in this city on the 8th day of May last, providing for\r\nthe extension of the term for the exchange of the ratifications of the\r\nconvention for commercial reciprocity between the same parties, signed\r\non the 21st day of May, 1867.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 6, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a protocol, signed in this city on the 23d of October\r\nlast, to the convention upon the subject of claims between the United\r\nStates and the Mexican Republic, signed the 4th of July, 1868.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 7, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the consideration of the Senate, the accompanying copy\r\nof a correspondence between the Secretary of State and the minister\r\nof the United States at Berlin, in relation to the exchange of the\r\nratifications of the naturalization convention dated July 27, 1868,\r\nbetween the United States and the Government of Wurtemberg, which was\r\nnot effected within the time named in the convention.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 7, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the consideration of the Senate, the accompanying copy\r\nof a correspondence between the Secretary of State and the legation\r\nof the United States at Brussels, in relation to the exchange of the\r\nratifications of the consular convention with Belgium signed on the 5th\r\nof December, 1868, which was not effected within the time named in the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 7, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a copy of a correspondence, a list of which is\r\nhereto annexed, between the Secretary of State and the minister resident\r\nof the United States at Constantinople, and invite its consideration of\r\nthe question as to the correct meaning of the fourth article of the\r\ntreaty of 1830 between the United States and Turkey.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _December 9, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 6th instant,\r\nrequesting reports of the military commander of the district of which\r\nGeorgia is a part in regard to the political and civil condition of that\r\nState, the accompanying papers are submitted.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 9, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State, in answer to a\r\nresolution of the House of Representatives of yesterday, asking to be\r\ninformed what legislatures have ratified the proposed fifteenth\r\namendment of the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 15, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit a further report from the Secretary of State in answer to the\r\nresolution of the House of Representatives of the 9th instant, making\r\nknown that official notice has been received at the Department of State\r\nof the ratification by the legislature of the State of Alabama of the\r\namendment to the Constitution recently proposed by Congress as Article\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 15, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 13th\r\ninstant, requesting a copy of official correspondence on the subject of\r\nCuba, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State, to whom the\r\nresolution was referred.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, D.C., December 15, 1869_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of December 9, 1869, requesting a copy\r\nof the charges, testimony, findings, and sentence in the trial by\r\ncourt-martial of Passed Assistant Surgeon Charles L.

States, the report of the Secretary of the Navy, to\r\nwhom the resolution was referred.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, D.C., March 8, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nHerewith I have the honor to transmit a communication from the Secretary\r\nof the Interior, relative to the obligation of Congress to make the\r\nnecessary appropriations to carry out the Indian treaties made by what\r\nis known as the Peace Commission of 1867.\r\n\r\nThe history of those treaties and the consequences of noncompliance with\r\nthem by the Government are so clearly set forth in this statement that\r\nI deem it better to communicate it in full than to ask the necessary\r\nappropriation in a shorter statement of the reasons for it. I earnestly\r\ndesire that if an Indian war becomes inevitable the Government of the\r\nUnited States at least should not be responsible for it. Pains will be\r\ntaken, and force used if necessary, to prevent the departure of the\r\nexpeditions referred to by the Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 10, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 4th instant, in\r\nrelation to the \"Transcontinental, Memphis, El Paso and Pacific Railroad\r\nCompany,\" I transmit reports from the Secretary of State and the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, with accompanying papers.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 10, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, in answer to their resolution of the 28th\r\nultimo, a report[90] from the Secretary of State, with accompanying\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Relating to legislation necessary to insure the\r\nadministration of justice and the protection of American interests in\r\nChina and Japan.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, D.C., March 14, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn reply to your resolution of the 14th of February, requesting to be\r\ninformed whether I desire that any of the Indian treaties now pending\r\nbefore you be considered confidentially, I have to inform you that there\r\nare none of them which I object to having discussed in open session.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, D.C., March 14, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI would respectfully call your attention to a treaty now before you for\r\nthe acquisition of the Republic of St. Domingo, entered into between the\r\nagents of the two Governments on the 29th of November, 1869, and by its\r\nterms to be finally acted upon by the people of St. Domingo and the\r\nSenate of the United States within four months from the date of signing\r\nthe treaty. The time for action expires on the 29th instant, a fact to\r\nwhich I desire expressly to call your attention. I would also direct\r\nyour notice to the fact that the Government of St. Domingo has no agent\r\nin the United States who is authorized to extend the time for further\r\ndeliberation upon its merits.\r\n\r\nThe people of St. Domingo have already, so far as their action can go,\r\nratified the treaty, and I express the earnest wish that you will not\r\npermit it to expire by limitation. I also entertain the sincere hope\r\nthat your action may be favorable to the ratification of the treaty.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 15, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State, in answer to a\r\nresolution of the Senate of the 3d instant, asking to be informed what\r\nStates have ratified the amendment known as the fifteenth amendment to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, so far as official notice thereof\r\nhas been transmitted to the Department of State, and that information\r\nfrom time to time may be communicated to that body, as soon as\r\npracticable, of such ratification hereafter by any State.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, D.C., March 23, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn the Executive message of December 6, 1869, to Congress the importance\r\nof taking steps to revive our drooping merchant marine was urged, and\r\na special message promised at a future day during the present session,\r\nrecommending more specifically plans to accomplish this result. Now that\r\nthe committee of the House of Representatives intrusted with the labor\r\nof ascertaining \"the cause of the decline of American commerce\" has\r\ncompleted its work and submitted its report to the legislative branch of\r\nthe Government, I deem this a fitting time to execute that promise.\r\n\r\nThe very able, calm, and exhaustive report of the committee points out\r\nthe grave wrongs which have produced the decline in our commerce. It is\r\na national humiliation that we are now compelled to pay from twenty to\r\nthirty million dollars annually (exclusive of passage money, which we\r\nshould share with vessels of other nations) to foreigners for doing the\r\nwork which should be done by American vessels, American built, American\r\nowned, and American manned. This is a direct drain upon the resources of\r\nthe country of just so much money, equal to casting it into the sea, so\r\nfar as this nation is concerned.\r\n\r\nA nation of the vast and ever-increasing interior resources of the\r\nUnited States, extending, as it does, from one to the other of the\r\ngreat oceans of the world, with an industrious, intelligent, energetic\r\npopulation, must one day possess its full share of the commerce of these\r\noceans, no matter what the cost. Delay will only increase this cost and\r\nenhance the difficulty of attaining the result.\r\n\r\nI therefore put in an earnest plea for early action in this matter, in\r\na way to secure the desired increase of American commerce. The advanced\r\nperiod of the year and the fact that no contracts for shipbuilding will\r\nprobably be entered into until this question is settled by Congress, and\r\nthe further fact that if there should be much delay all large vessels\r\ncontracted for this year will fail of completion before winter sets in,\r\nand will therefore be carried over for another year, induces me to\r\nrequest your early consideration of this subject.\r\n\r\nI regard it of such grave importance, affecting every interest of the\r\ncountry to so great an extent, that any method which will gain the end\r\nwill secure a rich national blessing. Building ships and navigating them\r\nutilizes vast capital at home; it employs thousands of workmen in their\r\nconstruction and manning; it creates a home market for the products of\r\nthe farm and the shop; it diminishes the balance of trade against us\r\nprecisely to the extent of freights and passage money paid to American\r\nvessels, and gives us a supremacy upon the seas of inestimable value in\r\ncase of foreign war.\r\n\r\nOur Navy at the commencement of the late war consisted of less than 100\r\nvessels, of about 150,000 tons and a force of about 8,000 men. We drew\r\nfrom the merchant marine, which had cost the Government nothing, but\r\nwhich had been a source of national wealth, 600 vessels, exceeding\r\n1,000,000 tons, and about 70,000 men, to aid in the suppression of the\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nThis statement demonstrates the value of the merchant marine as a means\r\nof national defense in time of need.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on the Causes of the Reduction of American Tonnage, after\r\ntracing the causes of its decline, submit two bills, which, if adopted,\r\nthey believe will restore to the nation its maritime power. Their report\r\nshows with great minuteness the actual and comparative American tonnage\r\nat the time of its greatest prosperity; the actual and comparative\r\ndecline since, together with the causes; and exhibits all other\r\nstatistics of material interest in reference to the subject. As the\r\nreport is before Congress, I will not recapitulate any of its\r\nstatistics, but refer only to the methods recommended by the committee\r\nto give back to us our lost commerce.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, when it can be adopted, I believe a direct money\r\nsubsidy is less liable to abuse than an indirect aid given to the same\r\nenterprise. In this case, however, my opinion is that subsidies, while\r\nthey may be given to specified lines of steamers or other vessels,\r\nshould not be exclusively adopted, but, in addition to subsidizing very\r\ndesirable lines of ocean traffic, a general assistance should be given\r\nin an effective way. I therefore commend to your favorable consideration\r\nthe two bills proposed by the committee and referred to in this message.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 25, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn reply to a Senate resolution of the 24th instant, requesting to\r\nbe furnished with a report, written by Captain Selfridge, upon the\r\nresources and condition of things in the Dominican Republic, I have\r\nto state that no such report has been received.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 25, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 15th ultimo, I transmit\r\na report, with accompanying paper,[17] from the Secretary of the Navy,\r\nto whom the resolution was referred.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Statement of the number and character of the ironclad\r\nvessels of the Navy, their cost, by whom designed, who recommended their\r\nconstruction, and their condition.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 29, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn reply to your resolution of December 20, 1869, asking \"whether any\r\ncitizens of the United States are imprisoned or detained in military\r\ncustody by officers of the Army of the United States, and, if any, to\r\nfurnish their names, date of arrest, the offenses charged, together\r\nwith a statement of what measures have been taken for the trial and\r\npunishment of the offenders,\" I transmit herewith the report of the\r\nSecretary of War, to whom the resolution was referred.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 30, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIt is unusual to notify the two Houses of Congress by message of\r\nthe promulgation, by proclamation of the Secretary of State, of the\r\nratification of a constitutional amendment. In view, however, of the\r\nvast importance of the fifteenth amendment to the Constitution, this day\r\ndeclared a part of that revered instrument, I deem a departure from the\r\nusual custom justifiable. A measure which makes at once 4,000,000 people\r\nvoters who were heretofore declared by the highest tribunal in the land\r\nnot citizens of the United States, nor eligible to become so (with the\r\nassertion that \"at the time of the Declaration of Independence the\r\nopinion was fixed and universal in the civilized portion of the white\r\nrace, regarded as an axiom in morals as well as in politics, that black\r\nmen had no rights which the white man was bound to respect\"), is indeed\r\na measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from\r\nthe foundation of our free Government to the present day.\r\n\r\nInstitutions like ours, in which all power is derived directly from the\r\npeople, must depend mainly upon their intelligence, patriotism, and\r\nindustry. I call the attention, therefore, of the newly enfranchised\r\nrace to the importance of their striving in every honorable manner to\r\nmake themselves worthy of their new privilege. To the race more favored\r\nheretofore by our laws I would say, Withhold no legal privilege of\r\nadvancement to the new citizen. The framers of our Constitution firmly\r\nbelieved that a republican government could not endure without\r\nintelligence and education generally diffused among the people. The\r\nFather of his Country, in his Farewell Address, uses this language:\r\n\r\nPromote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the\r\ngeneral diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a\r\ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public\r\nopinion should be enlightened.\r\n\r\nIn his first annual message to Congress the same views are forcibly\r\npresented, and are again urged in his eighth message.\r\n\r\nI repeat that the adoption of the fifteenth amendment to the\r\nConstitution completes the greatest civil change and constitutes the\r\nmost important event that has occurred since the nation came into life.\r\nThe change will be beneficial in proportion to the heed that is given to\r\nthe urgent recommendations of Washington. If these recommendations were\r\nimportant then, with a population of but a few millions, how much more\r\nimportant now, with a population of 40,000,000, and increasing in a\r\nrapid ratio. I would therefore call upon Congress to take all the means\r\nwithin their constitutional powers to promote and encourage popular\r\neducation throughout the country, and upon the people everywhere to see\r\nto it that all who possess and exercise political rights shall have the\r\nopportunity to acquire the knowledge which will make their share in the\r\nGovernment a blessing and not a danger. By such means only can the\r\nbenefits contemplated by this amendment to the Constitution be secured.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON FISH, SECRETARY OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n_To all to whom these presents may come, greeting:_\r\n\r\nKnow ye that the Congress of the United States, on or about the 27th\r\nday of February, in the year 1869, passed a resolution in the words\r\nand figures following, to wit:\r\n\r\nA RESOLUTION proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n_Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled_ (_two-thirds of both Houses\r\nconcurring_), That the following article be proposed to the legislatures\r\nof the several States as an amendment to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, which, when ratified by three-fourths of said legislatures,\r\nshall be valid as a part of the Constitution, viz;\r\n\r\nARTICLE XV.\r\n\r\nSection 1.

Blow, United States minister to\r\nBrazil, relative to the commercial interests of the United States with\r\nSouth America.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 31, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for consideration with a view to its\r\nratification, an additional article to the treaty of the 29th of\r\nNovember last, for the annexation of the Dominican Republic to the\r\nUnited States, stipulating for an extension of the time for exchanging\r\nthe ratifications thereof, signed in this city on the 14th instant by\r\nthe plenipotentiaries of the parties.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to have also negotiated with the plenipotentiary of\r\nSan Domingo amendments to the treaty of annexation to obviate objections\r\nwhich may be urged against the treaty as it is now worded; but on\r\nreflection I deem it better to submit to the Senate the propriety of\r\ntheir amending the treaty as follows: First, to specify that the\r\nobligations of this Government shall not exceed the $1,500,000\r\nstipulated in the treaty; secondly, to determine the manner of\r\nappointing the agents to receive and disburse the same; thirdly, to\r\ndetermine the class of creditors who shall take precedence in the\r\nsettlement of their claims; and, finally, to insert such amendments as\r\nmay suggest themselves to the minds of Senators to carry out in good\r\nfaith the conditions of the treaty submitted to the Senate of the United\r\nStates in January last, according to the spirit and intent of that\r\ntreaty. From the most reliable information I can obtain, the sum\r\nspecified in the treaty will pay every just claim against the Republic\r\nof San Domingo and leave a balance sufficient to carry on a Territorial\r\ngovernment until such time as new laws for providing a Territorial\r\nrevenue can be enacted and put in force.\r\n\r\nI feel an unusual anxiety for the ratification of this treaty, because\r\nI believe it will redound greatly to the glory of the two countries\r\ninterested, to civilization, and to the extirpation of the institution\r\nof slavery.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine promulgated by President Monroe has been adhered to by\r\nall political parties, and I now deem it proper to assert the equally\r\nimportant principle that hereafter no territory on this continent shall\r\nbe regarded as subject of transfer to a European power.\r\n\r\nThe Government of San Domingo has voluntarily sought this annexation.\r\nIt is a weak power, numbering probably less than 120,000 souls, and yet\r\npossessing one of the richest territories under the sun, capable of\r\nsupporting a population of 10,000,000 people in luxury. The people of\r\nSan Domingo are not capable of maintaining themselves in their present\r\ncondition, and must look for outside support.\r\n\r\nThey yearn for the protection of our free institutions and laws, our\r\nprogress and civilization. Shall we refuse them?\r\n\r\nI have information which I believe reliable that a European power stands\r\nready now to offer $2,000,000 for the possession of Samana Bay alone.\r\nIf refused by us, with what grace can we prevent a foreign power from\r\nattempting to secure the prize?\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of San Domingo is desirable because of its geographical\r\nposition. It commands the entrance to the Caribbean Sea and the Isthmus\r\ntransit of commerce. It possesses the richest soil, best and most\r\ncapacious harbors, most salubrious climate, and the most valuable\r\nproducts of the forests, mine, and soil of any of the West India\r\nIslands. Its possession by us will in a few years build up a coastwise\r\ncommerce of immense magnitude, which will go far toward restoring to us\r\nour lost merchant marine. It will give to us those articles which we\r\nconsume so largely and do not produce, thus equalizing our exports and\r\nimports.\r\n\r\nIn case of foreign war it will give us command of all the islands\r\nreferred to, and thus prevent an enemy from ever again possessing\r\nhimself of rendezvous upon our very coast.\r\n\r\nAt present our coast trade between the States bordering on the Atlantic\r\nand those bordering on the Gulf of Mexico is cut into by the Bahamas and\r\nthe Antilles. Twice we must, as it were, pass through foreign countries\r\nto get by sea from Georgia to the west coast of Florida.\r\n\r\nSan Domingo, with a stable government, under which her immense resources\r\ncan be developed, will give remunerative wages to tens of thousands of\r\nlaborers not now on the island.\r\n\r\nThis labor will take advantage of every available means of\r\ntransportation to abandon the adjacent islands and seek the blessings of\r\nfreedom and its sequence--each inhabitant receiving the reward of his\r\nown labor. Porto Rico and Cuba will have to abolish slavery, as a\r\nmeasure of self-preservation to retain their laborers.\r\n\r\nSan Domingo will become a large consumer of the products of Northern\r\nfarms and manufactories. The cheap rate at which her citizens can be\r\nfurnished with food, tools, and machinery will make it necessary that\r\nthe contiguous islands should have the same advantages in order to\r\ncompete in the production of sugar, coffee, tobacco, tropical fruits,\r\netc. This will open to us a still wider market for our products.\r\n\r\nThe production of our own supply of these articles will cut off more\r\nthan one hundred millions of our annual imports, besides largely\r\nincreasing our exports. With such a picture it is easy to see how our\r\nlarge debt abroad is ultimately to be extinguished. With a balance of\r\ntrade against us (including interest on bonds held by foreigners and\r\nmoney spent by our citizens traveling in foreign lands) equal to the\r\nentire yield of the precious metals in this country, it is not so easy\r\nto see how this result is to be otherwise accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of San Domingo is an adherence to the \"Monroe doctrine;\"\r\nit is a measure of national protection; it is asserting our just claim\r\nto a controlling influence over the great commercial traffic soon to\r\nflow from east to west by the way of the Isthmus of Darien; it is to\r\nbuild up our merchant marine; it is to furnish new markets for the\r\nproducts of our farms, shops, and manufactories; it is to make slavery\r\ninsupportable in Cuba and Porto Rico at once and ultimately so in\r\nBrazil; it is to settle the unhappy condition of Cuba, and end an\r\nexterminating conflict; it is to provide honest means of paying our\r\nhonest debts, without overtaxing the people; it is to furnish our\r\ncitizens with the necessaries of everyday life at cheaper rates than\r\never before; and it is, in fine, a rapid stride toward that greatness\r\nwhich the intelligence, industry, and enterprise of the citizens of the\r\nUnited States entitle this country to assume among nations.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, D.C. June 2, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn reply to your resolution of the 1st instant, requesting, \"in\r\nconfidence,\" any information in possession of the President \"touching\r\nany proposition, offer, or design of any foreign power to purchase or\r\nobtain any part of the territory of San Domingo or any right to the\r\nBay of Samana,\" I transmit herewith a copy of a letter, dated 27th of\r\nApril, 1870. addressed to \"Colonel J.W.

Climate, disease, and the occasional bullet\r\nhave worked destruction among the soldiers of Spain; and although the\r\nSpanish authorities have possession of every seaport and every town on\r\nthe island, they have not been able to subdue the hostile feeling which\r\nhas driven a considerable number of the native inhabitants of the island\r\nto armed resistance against Spain, and still leads them to endure the\r\ndangers and the privations of a roaming life of guerrilla warfare.\r\n\r\nOn either side the contest has been conducted, and is still carried on,\r\nwith a lamentable disregard of human life and of the rules and practices\r\nwhich modern civilization has prescribed in mitigation of the necessary\r\nhorrors of war. The torch of Spaniard and of Cuban is alike busy in\r\ncarrying devastation over fertile regions; murderous and revengeful\r\ndecrees are issued and executed by both parties. Count Valmaseda and\r\nColonel Boet, on the part of Spain, have each startled humanity and\r\naroused the indignation of the civilized world by the execution, each,\r\nof a score of prisoners at a time, while General Quesada, the Cuban\r\nchief, coolly and with apparent unconsciousness of aught else than a\r\nproper act, has admitted the slaughter, by his own deliberate order,\r\nin one day, of upward of 650 prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nA summary trial, with few, if any, escapes from conviction, followed by\r\nimmediate execution, is the fate of those arrested on either side on\r\nsuspicion of infidelity to the cause of the party making the arrest.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the sympathies of the people or of the Government of the\r\nUnited States for the cause or objects for which a part of the people of\r\nCuba are understood to have put themselves in armed resistance to the\r\nGovernment of Spain, there can be no just sympathy in a conflict carried\r\non by both parties alike in such barbarous violation of the rules of\r\ncivilized nations and with such continued outrage upon the plainest\r\nprinciples of humanity.\r\n\r\nWe can not discriminate in our censure of their mode of conducting their\r\ncontest between the Spaniards and the Cubans. Each commit the same\r\natrocities and outrage alike the established rules of war.\r\n\r\nThe properties of many of our citizens have been destroyed or embargoed,\r\nthe lives of several have been sacrificed, and the liberty of others has\r\nbeen restrained. In every case that has come to the knowledge of the\r\nGovernment an early and earnest demand for reparation and indemnity has\r\nbeen made, and most emphatic remonstrance has been presented against\r\nthe manner in which the strife is conducted and against the reckless\r\ndisregard of human life, the wanton destruction of material wealth,\r\nand the cruel disregard of the established rules of civilized warfare.\r\n\r\nI have, since the beginning of the present session of Congress,\r\ncommunicated to the House of Representatives, upon their request, an\r\naccount of the steps which I had taken in the hope of bringing this sad\r\nconflict to an end and of securing to the people of Cuba the blessings\r\nand the right of independent self-government. The efforts thus made\r\nfailed, but not without an assurance from Spain that the good offices of\r\nthis Government might still avail for the objects to which they had been\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole contest the remarkable exhibition has been made of\r\nlarge numbers of Cubans escaping from the island and avoiding the risks\r\nof war; congregating in this country, at a safe distance from the scene\r\nof danger, and endeavoring to make war from our shores, to urge our\r\npeople into the fight which they avoid, and to embroil this Government\r\nin complications and possible hostilities with Spain. It can scarce be\r\ndoubted that this last result is the real object of these parties,\r\nalthough carefully covered under the deceptive and apparently plausible\r\ndemand for a mere recognition of belligerency.\r\n\r\nIt is stated on what I have reason to regard as good authority that\r\nCuban bonds have been prepared to a large amount, whose payment is made\r\ndependent upon the recognition by the United States of either Cuban\r\nbelligerency or independence. The object of making their value thus\r\ncontingent upon the action of this Government is a subject for serious\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nIn determining the course to be adopted on the demand thus made for a\r\nrecognition of belligerency the liberal and peaceful principles adopted\r\nby the Father of his Country and the eminent statesmen of his day, and\r\nfollowed by succeeding Chief Magistrates and the men of their day, may\r\nfurnish a safe guide to those of us now charged with the direction and\r\ncontrol of the public safety.\r\n\r\nFrom 1789 to 1815 the dominant thought of our statesmen was to keep\r\nthe United States out of the wars which were devastating Europe. The\r\ndiscussion of measures of neutrality begins with the State papers of\r\nMr. Jefferson when Secretary of State. He shows that they are measures\r\nof national right as well as of national duty; that misguided individual\r\ncitizens can not be tolerated in making war according to their own\r\ncaprice, passions, interests, or foreign sympathies; that the agents of\r\nforeign governments, recognized or unrecognized, can not be permitted\r\nto abuse our hospitality by usurping the functions of enlisting or\r\nequipping military or naval forces within our territory. Washington\r\ninaugurated the policy of neutrality and of absolute abstinence from\r\nall foreign entangling alliances, which resulted, in 1794, in the first\r\nmunicipal enactment for the observance of neutrality.\r\n\r\nThe duty of opposition to filibustering has been admitted by every\r\nPresident. Washington encountered the efforts of Genèt and of the French\r\nrevolutionists; John Adams, the projects of Miranda; Jefferson, the\r\nschemes of Aaron Burr. Madison and subsequent Presidents had to deal\r\nwith the question of foreign enlistment or equipment in the United\r\nStates, and since the days of John Quincy Adams it has been one of the\r\nconstant cares of Government in the United States to prevent piratical\r\nexpeditions against the feeble Spanish American Republics from leaving\r\nour shores. In no country are men wanting for any enterprise that holds\r\nout promise of adventure or of gain.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of our national existence the whole continent of\r\nAmerica (outside of the limits of the United States) and all its islands\r\nwere in colonial dependence upon European powers.\r\n\r\nThe revolutions which from 1810 spread almost simultaneously through all\r\nthe Spanish American continental colonies resulted in the establishment\r\nof new States, like ourselves, of European origin, and interested in\r\nexcluding European politics and the questions of dynasty and of balances\r\nof power from further influence in the New World.\r\n\r\nThe American policy of neutrality, important before, became doubly so\r\nfrom the fact that it became applicable to the new Republics as well as\r\nto the mother country.\r\n\r\nIt then devolved upon us to determine the great international question\r\nat what time and under what circumstances to recognize a new power\r\nas entitled to a place among the family of nations, as well as the\r\npreliminary question of the attitude to be observed by this Government\r\ntoward the insurrectionary party pending the contest.\r\n\r\nMr. Monroe concisely expressed the rule which has controlled the action\r\nof this Government with reference to revolting colonies pending their\r\nstruggle by saying:\r\n\r\n  As soon as the movement assumed such a steady and consistent form as\r\n  to make the success of the Provinces probable, the rights to which\r\n  they were entitled by the laws of nations as equal parties to a civil\r\n  war were extended to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strict adherence to this rule of public policy has been one of\r\nthe highest honors of American statesmanship, and has secured to this\r\nGovernment the confidence of the feeble powers on this continent,\r\nwhich induces them to rely upon its friendship and absence of designs\r\nof conquest and to look to the United States for example and moral\r\nprotection. It has given to this Government a position of prominence and\r\nof influence which it should not abdicate, but which imposes upon it the\r\nmost delicate duties of right and of honor regarding American questions,\r\nwhether those questions affect emancipated colonies or colonies still\r\nsubject to European dominion.\r\n\r\nThe question of belligerency is one of fact, not to be decided by\r\nsympathies for or prejudices against either party. The relations\r\nbetween the parent state and the insurgents must amount in fact to\r\nwar in the sense of international law. Fighting, though fierce and\r\nprotracted, does not alone constitute war. There must be military forces\r\nacting in accordance with the rules and customs of war, flags of truce,\r\ncartels, exchange of prisoners, etc.; and to justify a recognition\r\nof belligerency there must be, above all, a _de facto_ political\r\norganization of the insurgents sufficient in character and resources\r\nto constitute it, if left to itself, a state among nations capable\r\nof discharging the duties of a state and of meeting the just\r\nresponsibilities it may incur as such toward other powers in the\r\ndischarge of its national duties.\r\n\r\nApplying the best information which I have been enabled to gather,\r\nwhether from official or unofficial sources, including the very\r\nexaggerated statements which each party gives to all that may prejudice\r\nthe opposite or give credit to its own side of the question, I am unable\r\nto see in the present condition of the contest in Cuba those elements\r\nwhich are requisite to constitute war in the sense of international law.\r\n\r\nThe insurgents hold no town or city; have no established seat of\r\ngovernment; they have no prize courts; no organization for the receiving\r\nand collecting of revenue; no seaport to which a prize may be carried or\r\nthrough which access can be had by a foreign power to the limited\r\ninterior territory and mountain fastnesses which they occupy. The\r\nexistence of a legislature representing any popular constituency is more\r\nthan doubtful.\r\n\r\nIn the uncertainty that hangs around the entire insurrection there is no\r\npalpable evidence of an election, of any delegated authority, or of any\r\ngovernment outside the limits of the camps occupied from day to day by\r\nthe roving companies of insurgent troops; there is no commerce, no\r\ntrade, either internal or foreign, no manufactures.\r\n\r\nThe late commander in chief of the insurgents, having recently come to\r\nthe United States, publicly declared that \"all commercial intercourse or\r\ntrade with the exterior world has been utterly cut off;\" and he further\r\nadded: \"To-day we have not 10,000 arms in Cuba.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a well-established principle of public law that a recognition by\r\na foreign state of belligerent rights to insurgents under circumstances\r\nsuch as now exist in Cuba, if not justified by necessity, is a\r\ngratuitous demonstration of moral support to the rebellion. Such\r\nnecessity may yet hereafter arrive, but it has not yet arrived, nor is\r\nits probability clearly to be seen.\r\n\r\nIf it be war between Spain and Cuba, and be so recognized, it is\r\nour duty to provide for the consequences which may ensue in the\r\nembarrassment to our commerce and the interference with our revenue.\r\n\r\nIf belligerency be recognized, the commercial marine of the United\r\nStates becomes liable to search and to seizure by the commissioned\r\ncruisers of both parties; they become subject to the adjudication of\r\nprize courts.\r\n\r\nOur large coastwise trade between the Atlantic and the Gulf States and\r\nbetween both and the Isthmus of Panama and the States of South America\r\n(engaging the larger part of our commercial marine) passes of necessity\r\nalmost in sight of the island of Cuba. Under the treaty with Spain of\r\n1795, as well as by the law of nations, our vessels will be liable\r\nto visit on the high seas. In case of belligerency the carrying of\r\ncontraband, which now is lawful, becomes liable to the risks of\r\nseizure and condemnation. The parent Government becomes relieved from\r\nresponsibility for acts done in the insurgent territory, and acquires\r\nthe right to exercise against neutral commerce all the powers of a party\r\nto a maritime war. To what consequences the exercise of those powers may\r\nlead is a question which I desire to commend to the serious\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn view of the gravity of this question, I have deemed it my duty to\r\ninvite the attention of the war-making power of the country to all the\r\nrelations and bearings of the question in connection with the\r\ndeclaration of neutrality and granting of belligerent rights.\r\n\r\nThere is not a _de facto_ government in the island of Cuba sufficient to\r\nexecute law and maintain just relations with other nations. Spain has\r\nnot been able to suppress the opposition to Spanish rule on the island,\r\nnor to award speedy justice to other nations, or citizens of other\r\nnations, when their rights have been invaded.\r\n\r\nThere are serious complications growing out of the seizure of American\r\nvessels upon the high seas, executing American citizens without proper\r\ntrial, and confiscating or embargoing the property of American citizens.\r\nSolemn protests have been made against every infraction of the rights\r\neither of individual citizens of the United States or the rights of our\r\nflag upon the high seas, and all proper steps have been taken and are\r\nbeing pressed for the proper reparation of every indignity complained\r\nof.\r\n\r\nThe question of belligerency, however, which is to be decided upon\r\ndefinite principles and according to ascertained facts, is entirely\r\ndifferent from and unconnected with the other questions of the manner in\r\nwhich the strife is carried on on both sides and the treatment of our\r\ncitizens entitled to our protection.\r\n\r\nThe questions concern our own dignity and responsibility, and they have\r\nbeen made, as I have said, the subjects of repeated communications with\r\nSpain and of protests and demands for redress on our part. It is hoped\r\nthat these will not be disregarded, but should they be these questions\r\nwill be made the subject of a further communication to Congress.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 17, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 8th instant, requesting\r\nthe President \"to communicate, in confidence, the instructions of the\r\nNavy Department to the navy officers in command on the coast of Dominica\r\nand Hayti, and the reports of such officers to the Navy Department,\r\nfrom the commencement of the negotiation of the treaty with Dominica,\"\r\nI herewith transmit the papers received from the Secretary of the Navy,\r\nto whom the resolution was referred.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 25, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the 22d instant, requesting to be\r\nfurnished with \"proposals received from any company or citizens of\r\nthe United States for constructing and placing iron steamships in\r\ntransatlantic service,\" I transmit herewith the only proposal of that\r\nnature received by me.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 9, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolutions of the Senate of the 26th of May and of\r\nthe 14th of June last, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State\r\nthereupon, and the papers[25] by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Lists of American vessels seized by Spanish authorities in\r\nCuba; of American citizens executed and imprisoned in Cuba; of American\r\ncitizens whose property was confiscated or embargoed in Cuba, and of\r\ndecrees under which the Spanish authorities acted, and correspondence\r\nshowing steps taken by the United States Government in reference\r\nthereto.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 12, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for consideration with a view to ratification,\r\na convention between the United States and Austria, concerning the\r\nrights, privileges, and immunities of consuls in the two countries,\r\nsigned at Washington on the 11th instant.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 13, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, in answer to their resolution of the 8th\r\ninstant, a report from the Secretary of State and the papers[26] which\r\naccompanied it.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Instructions to the minister to Spain stating the basis\r\non which the United States offered its good offices for the purpose of\r\nterminating the war in Cuba, correspondence relative thereto, etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 13, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to their resolution of the 8th instant, I transmit to the\r\nSenate a report from the Secretary of State and the papers[27] which\r\naccompanied it.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Correspondence between the United States and Great Britain\r\nconcerning questions pending between the two countries.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 14, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, in answer to their resolution of the 7th\r\ninstant, a report from the Secretary of State, with accompanying\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, _Washington, July 14, 1870_.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State, to whom was referred the resolution of the\r\nSenate requesting the President \"to institute an inquiry, by such means\r\nas in his judgment shall be deemed proper, into the present condition\r\nof the commercial relations between the United States and the Spanish\r\nAmerican States on this continent, and between those countries and other\r\nnations, and to communicate to the Senate full and complete statements\r\nregarding the same, together with such recommendations as he may think\r\nnecessary to promote the development and increase of our commerce with\r\nthose regions and to secure to the United States that proportionate\r\nshare of the trade of this continent to which their close relations of\r\ngeographical contiguity and political friendship with all the States\r\nof America justly entitle them,\" has the honor to report:\r\n\r\nThe resolution justly regards the commercial and the political relations\r\nof the United States with the American States of Spanish origin as\r\nnecessarily dependent upon each other. If the commerce of those\r\ncountries has been diverted from its natural connection with the United\r\nStates, the fact may probably be partly traced to political causes,\r\nwhich have been swept away by the great civil convulsion in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nFor the just comprehension of the position of this Government in the\r\nAmerican political system, and for the causes which have failed to give\r\nit hitherto the influence to which it is properly entitled by reason of\r\nits democratic system and of the moderation and sense of justice which\r\nhave distinguished its foreign policy through successive Administrations\r\nfrom the birth of the nation until now, it is necessary to make a brief\r\nnotice of such measures as affect our present relations to the other\r\nparts of this continent.\r\n\r\nThe United States were the first of the European colonies in America to\r\narrive at maturity as a people and assume the position of an independent\r\nrepublic. Since then important changes have taken place in various\r\nnations and in every part of the world. Our own growth in power has been\r\nnot the least remarkable of all the great events of modern history.\r\n\r\nWhen, at the conclusion of the Revolutionary War, having conquered by\r\narms our right to exist as a sovereign state, that right was at length\r\nrecognized by treaties, we occupied only a narrow belt of land along the\r\nAtlantic coast, hemmed in at the north, the west, and the south by the\r\npossessions of European Governments, or by uncultivated wastes beyond\r\nthe Alleghanies, inhabited only by the aborigines. But in the very\r\ninfancy of the United States far-sighted statesmen saw and predicted\r\nthat, weak in population and apparently restricted in available\r\nterritory as the new Republic then was, it had within it the germs of\r\ncolossal grandeur, and would at no remote day occupy the continent of\r\nAmerica with its institutions, its authority, and its peaceful\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThat expectation has been thus far signally verified. The United States\r\nentered at once into the occupation of their rightful possessions\r\nwestward to the banks of the Mississippi. Next, by the spontaneous\r\nproffer of France, they acquired Louisiana and its territorial\r\nextension, or right of extension, north to the line of the treaty\r\ndemarcation between France and Great Britain, and west to the Pacific\r\nOcean. Next, by amicable arrangement with Spain, they acquired the\r\nFloridas, and complete southern maritime frontiers upon the Gulf of\r\nMexico. Then came the union with the independent State of Texas,\r\nfollowed by the acquisitions of California and New Mexico, and then of\r\nArizona. Finally, Russia has ceded to us Alaska, and the continent of\r\nNorth America has become independent of Europe, except so much of it as\r\ncontinues to maintain political relations with Great Britain.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, partly by natural increase and partly by voluntary\r\nimmigration from Europe, our population has risen from 3,000,000 to\r\nnearly 40,000,000; the number of States and Territories united under\r\nthe Constitution has been augmented from thirteen to forty-seven; the\r\ndevelopment of internal wealth and power has kept pace with political\r\nexpansion; we have occupied in part and peopled the vast interior of\r\nthe continent; we have bound the Pacific to the Atlantic by a chain of\r\nintervening States and organized Territories; we have delivered the\r\nRepublic from the anomaly and the ignominy of domestic servitude; we\r\nhave constitutionally fixed the equality of all races and of all men\r\nbefore the law; and we have established, at the cost of a great civil\r\nwar--a cost, however, not beyond the value of such a result--the\r\nindissoluble national unity of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn all these marked stages of national progress, from the Declaration\r\nof Independence to the recent amendments of the Constitution, it is\r\nimpossible not to perceive a providential series and succession of\r\nevents, intimately attached one to the other, and possessed of definite\r\ncharacter as a whole, whatever incidental departures from such\r\nuniformity may have marked, or seemed to mark, our foreign policy under\r\nthe influence of temporary causes or of the conflicting opinions of\r\nstatesmen.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Washington, of the first Adams, of Jefferson, and of\r\nMadison the condition of Europe, engaged in the gigantic wars of the\r\nFrench Revolution and of the Empire, produced its series of public\r\nquestions and gave tone and color to our foreign policy. In the time of\r\nMonroe, of the second Adams, and of Jackson, and subsequently thereto,\r\nthe independence of the Spanish and Portuguese colonies of America\r\nproduced its series of questions and its apparent modification of our\r\npublic policy. Domestic questions of territorial organization, of social\r\nemancipation, and of national unity have also largely occupied the minds\r\nand the attention of the later Administrations.\r\n\r\nThe treaties of alliance and guaranty with France, which contributed so\r\nmuch to our independence, were one source of solicitude to the early\r\nAdministrations, which were endeavoring to protect our commerce from the\r\ndepredations and wrongs to which the maritime policy of England and the\r\nreaction of that policy on France subjected it. For twenty years we\r\nstruggled in vain to accomplish this, and at last drifted into war.\r\n\r\nThe avoidance of entangling alliances, the characteristic feature of the\r\nforeign policy of Washington, sprang from this condition of things. But\r\nthe entangling alliances which then existed were engagements made with\r\nFrance as a part of the general contract under which aid was furnished\r\nto us for the achievement of our independence. France was willing to\r\nwaive the letter of the obligation as to her West India possessions, but\r\ndemanded in its stead privileges in our ports which the Administration\r\nwas unwilling to concede. To make its refusal acceptable to a public\r\nwhich sympathized with France, the Cabinet of General Washington\r\nexaggerated the principle into a theory tending to national isolation.\r\n\r\nThe public measures designed to maintain unimpaired the domestic\r\nsovereignty and the international neutrality of the United States\r\nwere independent of this policy, though apparently incidental to it.\r\nThe municipal laws enacted by Congress then and since have been but\r\ndeclarations of the law of nations. They are essential to the\r\npreservation of our national dignity and honor; they have for their\r\nobject to repress and punish all enterprises of private war, one of the\r\nlast relics of mediaeval barbarism; and they have descended to us from\r\nthe fathers of the Republic, supported and enforced by every succeeding\r\nPresident of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe foreign policy of these early days was not a narrow one. During\r\nthis period we secured the evacuation by Great Britain of the country\r\nwrongfully occupied by her on the Lakes; we acquired Louisiana; we\r\nmeasured forces on the sea with France, and on the land and sea with\r\nEngland; we set the example of resisting and chastising the piracies of\r\nthe Barbary States; we initiated in negotiations with Prussia the long\r\nline of treaties for the liberalization of war and the promotion of\r\ninternational intercourse; and we steadily demanded, and at length\r\nobtained, indemnification from various governments for the losses we\r\nhad suffered by foreign spoliations in the wars of Europe.\r\n\r\nTo this point in our foreign policy we had arrived when the\r\nrevolutionary movements in Spanish and Portuguese America compelled a\r\nmodification of our relations with Europe, in consequence of the rise of\r\nnew and independent states in America.\r\n\r\nThe revolution which commenced in 1810, and extended through all the\r\nSpanish American continental colonies, after vain efforts of repression\r\non the part of Spain, protracted through twenty years, terminated in\r\nthe establishment of the independent States of Mexico, Guatemala, San\r\nSalvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador,\r\nPeru, Chile, Bolivia, the Argentine Republic, Uruguay, and Paraguay,\r\nto which the Empire of Brazil came in time to be added. These events\r\nnecessarily enlarged the sphere of action of the United States, and\r\nessentially modified our relations with Europe and our attitude to the\r\nrest of this continent.\r\n\r\nThe new States were, like ourselves, revolted colonies. They continued\r\nthe precedent we had set, of separating from Europe. Their assumption of\r\nindependence was stimulated by our example. They professedly imitated\r\nus, and copied our National Constitution, sometimes even to their\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish American colonies had not the same preparation for\r\nindependence that we had. Each of the British colonies possessed\r\ncomplete local autonomy. Its formal transition from dependence to\r\nindependence consisted chiefly in expelling the British governor of the\r\ncolony and electing a governor of the State, from which to the organized\r\nUnion was but a step. All these conditions of success were wanting in\r\nSpanish America, and hence many of the difficulties in their career\r\nas independent states; and, further, while the revolution in British\r\nAmerica was the exclusive result of the march of opinion in the British\r\ncolonies, the simultaneous action of the separate Spanish colonies,\r\nthough showing a desire for independence, was principally produced by\r\nthe accident of the invasion of Spain by France.\r\n\r\nThe formation of these new sovereignties in America was important to us,\r\nnot only because of the cessation of colonial monopolies to that extent,\r\nbut because of the geographical relations to us held by so many new\r\nnations, all, like ourselves, created from European stock and interested\r\nin excluding European politics, dynastic questions, and balances of\r\npower from further influence in the New World.\r\n\r\nThus the United States were forced into new lines of action, which,\r\nthough apparently in some respects conflicting, were really in harmony\r\nwith the line marked out by Washington. The avoidance of entangling\r\npolitical alliances and the maintenance of our own independent\r\nneutrality became doubly important from the fact that they became\r\napplicable to the new Republics as well as to the mother country.\r\nThe duty of noninterference had been admitted by every President.\r\nThe question came up in the time of the first Adams, on the occasion\r\nof the enlistment projects of Miranda. It appeared again under Jefferson\r\n(anterior to the revolt of the Spanish colonies) in the schemes of Aaron\r\nBurr. It was an ever-present question in the Administrations of Madison,\r\nMonroe, and the younger Adams, in reference to the questions of foreign\r\nenlistment or equipment in the United States, and when these new\r\nRepublics entered the family of nations, many of them very feeble, and\r\nall too much subject to internal revolution and civil war, a strict\r\nadherence to our previous policy and a strict enforcement of our laws\r\nbecame essential to the preservation of friendly relations with them;\r\nfor since that time it has been one of the principal cares of those\r\nintrusted with the administration of the Government to prevent piratical\r\nexpeditions against these sister Republics from leaving our ports.\r\nAnd thus the changed condition of the New World made no change in the\r\ntraditional and peaceful policy of the United States in this respect.\r\n\r\nIn one respect, however, the advent of these new States in America did\r\ncompel an apparent change of foreign policy on our part. It devolved\r\nupon us the determination of the great international question at what\r\ntime and under what circumstances to recognize a new power as entitled\r\nto a place among the family of nations. There was but little of\r\nprecedent to guide us, except our own case. Something, indeed, could be\r\ninferred from the historical origin of the Netherlands and Switzerland.\r\nBut our own case, carefully and conscientiously considered, was\r\nsufficient to guide us to right conclusions. We maintained our position\r\nof international friendship and of treaty obligations toward Spain, but\r\nwe did not consider that we were bound to wait for its recognition of\r\nthe new Republics before admitting them into treaty relations with us\r\nas sovereign states. We held that it was for us to judge whether or\r\nnot they had attained to the condition of actual independence, and the\r\nconsequent right of recognition by us. We considered this question of\r\nfact deliberately and coolly. We sent commissioners to Spanish America\r\nto ascertain and report for our information concerning their actual\r\ncircumstances, and in the fullness of time we acknowledged their\r\nindependence; we exchanged diplomatic ministers, and made treaties of\r\namity with them, the earliest of which, negotiated by Mr. John Quincy\r\nAdams, served as the model for the subsequent treaties with the Spanish\r\nAmerican Republics. We also, simultaneously therewith, exerted our good\r\noffices with Spain to induce her to submit to the inevitable result and\r\nherself to accept and acknowledge the independence of her late colonies.\r\nWe endeavored to induce Russia to join us in these representations.\r\nIn all this our action was positive, in the direction of promoting the\r\ncomplete political separation of America from Europe.\r\n\r\nA vast field was thus opened to the statesmen of the United States for\r\nthe peaceful introduction, the spread, and the permanent establishment\r\nof the American ideas of republican government, of modification of the\r\nlaws of war, of liberalization of commerce, of religious freedom and\r\ntoleration, and of the emancipation of the New World from the dynastic\r\nand balance of power controversies of Europe.\r\n\r\nMr. John Quincy Adams, beyond any other statesman of the time in this\r\ncountry, had the knowledge and experience, both European and American,\r\nthe comprehension of thought and purpose, and the moral convictions\r\nwhich peculiarly fitted him to introduce our country into this new field\r\nand to lay the foundation of an American policy. The declaration known\r\nas the Monroe doctrine, and the objects and purposes of the congress of\r\nPanama, both supposed to have been largely inspired by Mr. Adams, have\r\ninfluenced public events from that day to this as a principle of\r\ngovernment for this continent and its adjacent islands.\r\n\r\nIt was at the period of the congress of Aix-la-Chapelle and of\r\nLaybach, when the \"Holy Alliance\" was combined to arrest all political\r\nchanges in Europe in the sense of liberty, when they were intervening\r\nin southern Europe for the reestablishment of absolutism, and when they\r\nwere meditating interference to check the progress of free government\r\nin America, that Mr. Monroe, in his annual message of December, 1823,\r\ndeclared that the United States would consider any attempt to extend\r\nthe European system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to\r\nour peace and safety. \"With the existing colonies or dependencies of\r\nany European power,\" he said, \"we have not interfered and shall not\r\ninterfere; but with the governments who have declared their independence\r\nand maintained it, and whose independence we have, on great\r\nconsideration and on just principles, acknowledged, we could not view\r\nany interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in\r\nany other manner their destiny, by any European power in any other light\r\nthan as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nThis declaration resolved the solution of the immediate question of the\r\nindependence of the Spanish American colonies, and is supposed to have\r\nexercised some influence upon the course of the British cabinet in\r\nregard to the absolutist schemes in Europe as well as in America.\r\n\r\nIt has also exercised a permanent influence on this continent. It was at\r\nonce invoked in consequence of the supposed peril of Cuba on the side of\r\nEurope; it was applied to a similar danger threatening Yucatan; it was\r\nembodied in the treaty of the United States and Great Britain as to\r\nCentral America; it produced the successful opposition of the United\r\nStates to the attempt of Great Britain to exercise dominion in Nicaragua\r\nunder the cover of the Mosquito Indians; and it operated in like manner\r\nto prevent the establishment of a European dynasty in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe United States stand solemnly committed by repeated declarations and\r\nrepeated acts to this doctrine, and its application to the affairs of\r\nthis continent. In his message to the two Houses of Congress at the\r\ncommencement of the present session the President, following the\r\nteachings of all our history, said that the existing \"dependencies are\r\nno longer regarded as subject to transfer from one European power to\r\nanother. When the present relation of colonies ceases, they are to\r\nbecome independent powers, exercising the right of choice and of\r\nself-control in the determination of their future condition and\r\nrelations with other powers.\"\r\n\r\nThis policy is not a policy of aggression; but it opposes the creation\r\nof European dominion on American soil, or its transfer to other European\r\npowers, and it looks hopefully to the time when, by the voluntary\r\ndeparture of European Governments from this continent and the adjacent\r\nislands, America shall be wholly American.\r\n\r\nIt does not contemplate forcible intervention in any legitimate contest,\r\nbut it protests against permitting such a contest to result in the\r\nincrease of European power or influence; and it ever impels this\r\nGovernment, as in the late contest between the South American Republics\r\nand Spain, to interpose its good offices to secure an honorable peace.\r\n\r\nThe congress of Panama was planned by Bolivar to secure the union of\r\nSpanish America against Spain. It had originally military as well as\r\npolitical purposes. In the military objects the United States could take\r\nno part; and, indeed, the necessity for such objects ceased when the\r\nfull effects of Mr. Monroe's declarations were felt. But the pacific\r\nobjects of the congress--the establishment of close and cordial\r\nrelations of amity, the creation of commercial intercourse, of\r\ninterchange of political thought, and of habits of good understanding\r\nbetween the new Republics and the United States and their respective\r\ncitizens--might perhaps have been attained had the Administration of\r\nthat day received the united support of the country. Unhappily, they\r\nwere lost; the new States were removed from the sympathetic and\r\nprotecting influence of our example, and their commerce, which we might\r\nthen have secured, passed into other hands, unfriendly to the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIn looking back upon the Panama congress from this length of time it is\r\neasy to understand why the earnest and patriotic men who endeavored to\r\ncrystallize an American system for this continent failed.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay and Mr. Adams were far-sighted statesmen, but, unfortunately,\r\nthey struck against the rock of African slavery. One of the questions\r\nproposed for discussion in the conference was \"the consideration of\r\nthe means to be adopted for the entire abolition of the African slave\r\ntrade,\" to which proposition the committee of the United States Senate\r\nof that day replied: \"The United States have not certainly the right,\r\nand ought never to feel the inclination, to dictate to others who may\r\ndiffer with them upon this subject; nor do the committee see the\r\nexpediency of insulting other states with whom we are maintaining\r\nrelations of perfect amity by ascending the moral chair and proclaiming\r\nfrom thence mere abstract principles, of the rectitude of which each\r\nnation enjoys the perfect right of deciding for itself.\" The same\r\ncommittee also alluded to the possibility that the condition of the\r\nislands of Cuba and Porto Rico, still the possessions of Spain and\r\nstill slaveholding, might be made the subject of discussion and of\r\ncontemplated action by the Panama congress. \"If ever the United States,\"\r\nthey said, \"permit themselves to be associated with these nations in any\r\ngeneral congress assembled for the discussion of common plans in any way\r\naffecting European interests, they will by such act not only deprive\r\nthemselves of the ability they now possess of rendering useful\r\nassistance to the other American States, but also produce other effects\r\nprejudicial to their own interests.\"\r\n\r\nThus the necessity at that day of preserving the great interest of the\r\nSouthern States in African slavery, and of preventing a change in the\r\ncharacter of labor in the islands of Cuba and Porto Rico, lost to the\r\nUnited States the opportunity of giving a permanent direction to the\r\npolitical and commercial connections of the newly enfranchised Spanish\r\nAmerican States, and their trade passed into hands unfriendly to the\r\nUnited States, and has remained there ever since.\r\n\r\nEvents subsequent to that date have tended to place us in a position to\r\nretrieve our mistakes, among which events may be particularly named the\r\nsuppression of the rebellion, the manifestation of our undeveloped and\r\nunexpected military power, the retirement of the French from Mexico, and\r\nthe abolition of slavery in the United States.\r\n\r\nThere is good reason to believe that the latter fact has had an\r\nimportant influence in our favor in Spanish America. It has caused us\r\nto be regarded there with more sympathetic as well as more respectful\r\nconsideration. It has relieved those Republics from the fear of\r\nfilibusterism which had been formerly incited against Central America\r\nand Mexico in the interest of slave extension, and it has produced\r\nan impression of the stability of our institutions and of our public\r\nstrength sufficient to dissipate the fears of our friends or the hopes\r\nof those who wish us ill.\r\n\r\nThus there exists in the Spanish American Republics confidence toward\r\nthe United States. On our side they find a feeling of cordial amity and\r\nfriendship, and a desire to cultivate and develop our common interests\r\non this continent. With some of these States our relations are more\r\nintimate than with others, either by reason of closer similarity of\r\nconstitutional forms, of greater commercial intercourse, of proximity in\r\nfact, or of the construction or contemplated construction of lines of\r\ntransit for our trade and commerce between the Atlantic and the Pacific.\r\nWith several of them we have peculiar treaty relations. The treaty of\r\n1846 between the United States and New Granada contains stipulations\r\nof guaranty for the neutrality of that part of the Isthmus within the\r\npresent territory of Colombia, and for the protection of the rights\r\nof sovereignty and property therein belonging to Colombia. Similar\r\nstipulations appear in the treaty of 1867 with Nicaragua, and of July,\r\n1864, with Honduras. Those treaties (like the treaty of alliance made\r\nwith France in 1778 by Dr. Franklin, Silas Deane, and Arthur Lee)\r\nconstitute _pro tanto_ a true protective alliance between the United\r\nStates and each of those Republics. Provisions of like effect appear\r\nin the treaty of April 19, 1850, between Great Britain and the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBrazil, with her imperial semblance and constitutional reality, has\r\nalways held relations of amity with us, which have been fortified by\r\nthe opening of her great rivers to commerce. It needs only that, in\r\nemulation of Russia and the United States, she should emancipate her\r\nslaves to place her in more complete sympathy with the rest of America.\r\n\r\nIt will not be presumptuous, after the foregoing sketch, to say, with\r\nentire consideration for the sovereignty and national pride of the\r\nSpanish American Republics, that the United States, by the priority\r\nof their independence, by the stability of their institutions, by the\r\nregard of their people for the forms of law, by their resources as a\r\ngovernment, by their naval power, by their commercial enterprise, by the\r\nattractions which they offer to European immigration, by the prodigious\r\ninternal development of their resources and wealth, and by the\r\nintellectual life of their population, occupy of necessity a prominent\r\nposition on this continent, which they neither can nor should abdicate,\r\nwhich entitles them to a leading voice, and which imposes upon them\r\nduties of right and of honor regarding American questions, whether those\r\nquestions affect emancipated colonies or colonies still subject to\r\nEuropean dominion.\r\n\r\nThe public questions which existed as to all European colonies prior to\r\nand during the revolutions in the continental colonies of Spain and\r\nPortugal still exist with reference to the European colonies which\r\nremain; and they now return upon us in full force, as we watch events in\r\nCuba and Porto Rico.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the result of the pending contest in Cuba, it appears\r\nto be the belief of some of the leading statesmen of Spain that the\r\nrelations which now exist between the island and the mother country can\r\nnot be long continued. It is understood that the resources for carrying\r\non the struggle have been supplied mainly from Cuba, by the aid of that\r\nportion of the population which does not desire to see its political\r\ndestinies intrusted to the persons who direct the movements of the\r\ninsurgents; but it does not follow that its political relations with\r\nSpain are to remain unchanged, or that even the party which is now\r\ndominant in the island will wish to forever continue colonists.\r\n\r\nThese facts give reason to think that when the contest shall close,\r\nCuba, with her resources strained, but unexhausted (whatever may be\r\nher political relations), will resume and continue her old commercial\r\nrelations with the United States; and it is not impossible that at some\r\nday, not far distant when measured by the course of history, she will be\r\ncalled upon to elect her position in the family of nations.\r\n\r\nAlthough the resolution of the Senate does not in terms apply to the\r\nislands of the Antilles, it is impossible to answer it without speaking\r\nof them. They outlie the southern coast of the United States and guard\r\nthe approaches to the ports of Mexico, Venezuela, and the Isthmus, by\r\nwhich we reach from the east the western coasts of Mexico and of the\r\nSpanish States. The people of the Spanish islands speak the language\r\nand share the traditions, customs, ideas, and religion of the Spanish\r\nAmerican States of the continent, and will probably, like them, become\r\nat some time independent of the mother country. It would, therefore,\r\nbe unwise, while shaping a commercial policy for the continent, to\r\ndisregard the islands which lie so much nearer to our seaports.\r\n\r\nWith the Spanish islands of Cuba and Porto Rico we maintain, in spite of\r\ntheir adverse legislation, a large commerce by reason of our necessities\r\nand of their proximity. In the year ending June 30, 1869, we imported\r\nfrom them merchandise valued at $65,609,274. During the same time we\r\nsent them goods to the value only of $15,313,919.\r\n\r\nThe prohibitory duties forced upon them by the policy of Spain\r\nshut out much that we might supply. Their tropical productions, for\r\ninstance, are too valuable to allow their lands to be given up to the\r\ngrowth of breadstuffs; yet, instead of taking these articles from the\r\nsuperabundant fields of their nearest neighbors, they are forced to\r\ngo to the distant plains of Spain. It will be for the interest of the\r\nUnited States to shape its general policy so that this relation of\r\nimports and exports shall be altered in Cuba when peace is restored\r\nand its political condition is satisfactorily established.\r\n\r\nWith none of the other Spanish American States in North and South\r\nAmerica are our commercial relations what they should be. Our total\r\nimports in the year ending June 30, 1869, from these countries were less\r\nthan $25,000,000 (or not one-half the amount from Cuba alone), and our\r\nexports for the same time to them were only $17,850,313; and yet these\r\ncountries have an aggregate population nearly or quite as great as that\r\nof the United States; they have republican forms of government, and they\r\nprofess to be, and probably really are, in political sympathy with us.\r\n\r\nThis Department is not able to give with entire accuracy the imports\r\nand exports of Great Britain with the same countries during the\r\ncorresponding period. It is believed, however, the following figures\r\nwill be found to be not far from correct: Imports to Great Britain,\r\n$42,820,942; exports from Great Britain, $40,682,102.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that notwithstanding the greater distance which\r\nthe commerce has to travel in coming to and from Great Britain,\r\nnotwithstanding the political sympathy which ought naturally to exist\r\nbetween republics, notwithstanding the American idea which has been\r\nso prominently and so constantly put forward by the Government of the\r\nUnited States, notwithstanding the acknowledged skill of American\r\nmanufacturers, notwithstanding the ready markets which the great cities\r\nof the United States afford for the consumption of tropical productions,\r\nthe inhabitants of the Spanish American continent consume of the\r\nproducts of Great Britain more than twice the quantity they take of\r\nthe products of the United States, and that they sell to us only\r\nthree-fifths of the amount they sell to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State appends to this report the tables on which these\r\nstatements are founded. That their commerce with the United States is\r\nnot large may be partially explained by the fact that these States have\r\nbeen subject to many successive revolutions since the failure of the\r\ncongress of Panama. These revolutions not only exhaust their resources\r\nand burden them with debt, but they check emigration, prevent the flow\r\nof foreign capital into the country, and stop the enterprise which needs\r\na stable government for its development.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions are, however, applicable to the British commerce as\r\nwell as to our own, and they do not explain why we, with the natural\r\nadvantages in our favor, fall so far behind. The Isthmus of Panama is\r\nthe common point where the commerce of the western coasts of Mexico and\r\nSouth America meets. When it arrives there, why should it seek Liverpool\r\nand London rather than New York?\r\n\r\nThe political causes which have operated to divert this commerce from us\r\nthe Secretary of State has endeavored to explain. A favorable time has\r\nnow come for removing them--for laying the foundation of an American\r\npolicy which shall bind in closer union the American Republics. Let\r\nthem understand that the United States do not covet their territories;\r\nthat our only desire is to see them peaceful, with free and stable\r\ngovernments, increasing in wealth and population, and developing in the\r\nlines in which their own traditions, customs, habits, laws, and modes\r\nof thought will naturally take them. Let them feel that, as in 1826,\r\nso now, this Government is ready to aid them to the full extent of its\r\nconstitutional power in any steps which they may take for their better\r\nprotection against anarchy. Let them be convinced that the United States\r\nis prepared, in good faith and without ulterior purposes, to join them\r\nin the development of a peaceful American commercial policy that may in\r\ntime include this continent and the West Indian Islands. Let this be\r\ncomprehended, and there will be no political reason why we may not\r\n\"secure to the United States that proportionate share of the trade of\r\nthis continent to which their close relations of geographical contiguity\r\nand political friendship with all the States of America justly entitle\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nIt may not be enough to remove the political obstacles only. The\r\nfinancial policy which the war made necessary may have operated\r\ninjuriously upon our commerce with these States. The resolution of the\r\nSenate calls, on these points, for detailed information which is not\r\nwithin the control of the Secretary of State, and for recommendations\r\nfor the future which he is not prepared to give without that\r\ninformation.

In view of this a sound policy\r\nindicates the importance of some legislation tending to enlarge the\r\ncommercial marine of this country. The vessels of this country at the\r\npresent time are insufficient to meet the demand which the existence of\r\na war in Europe will impose upon the commerce of the United States, and\r\nI submit to the consideration of Congress that the interests of the\r\ncountry will be advanced by the opportunity afforded to our citizens to\r\npurchase vessels of foreign construction for the foreign trade of the\r\ncountry. An act to this effect may be limited in its duration to meet\r\nthe immediate exigency.\r\n\r\nThe foreign-mail service of the United States is in a large degree\r\ndependent upon the Bremen and Hamburg lines of steamers. The Post-Office\r\nDepartment has entered into contracts in writing with the two companies\r\nabove named, and with the Williams and Guion lines, respectively, for a\r\nregular and continuous service of two years. The only arrangement that\r\ncould be made with the Inman and Cunard lines is temporary, and may be\r\nbroken off at any time.\r\n\r\nThe North German lines are first class in point of speed and equipment,\r\ntheir steamers usually making the trip across the Atlantic in from\r\ntwenty-four to thirty-six hours in advance of the Williams and Guion\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nShould the North German steamers be blockaded or impeded by France, our\r\npostal intercourse with foreign nations will be greatly embarrassed\r\nunless Congress shall interpose for its relief.\r\n\r\nI suggest to Congress the propriety of further postponing the time for\r\nadjournment, with the view of considering the questions herein\r\ncommunicated.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 15, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to their resolution of the 9th instant, I transmit a report[28]\r\nfrom the Secretary of State and the papers which accompanied it.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Relating to the importation of Chinese coolies into the\r\nUnited States.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, D.C., January 11, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI return herewith without my approval Senate bill No. 273, entitled\r\n\"An act for the relief of Rollin White,\" for the reasons set forth in\r\nthe accompanying communication, dated December n, 1869, from the Chief\r\nof Ordnance.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDNANCE OFFICE, WAR DEPARTMENT, _Washington, December 11, 1869_.\r\n\r\nHon. W.W. BELKNAP,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\nSIR: In the year 1855 Rollin White obtained letters patent for\r\nimprovements in repeating pistols, in (among other things) extending the\r\nchambers of the rotating cylinder through to the rear, so as to enable\r\nthe chambers to be charged at the rear by hand or by a self-acting\r\ncharger.\r\n\r\nSome time afterwards, and prior to the breaking out of the rebellion,\r\nhe assigned this patent to Smith & Wesson, of Springfield, Mass., for\r\nthe sum of $500 in cash and their obligation to pay him 25 cents royalty\r\non each pistol manufactured under the patent, binding himself to apply\r\nfor and to use his influence to procure a renewal of the patent. He\r\nafterwards surrendered this original patent and obtained a reissue\r\nin three divisions. Two years before the expiration of the latter he\r\napplied to the Commissioner of Patents for an extension, upon the\r\nground of insufficiency of compensation. The Commissioner rejected the\r\napplication for an extension, without assigning any reason, and the\r\npatents expired by limitation on the 3d of April, 1869, and the\r\ninvention became public property.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of April, 1869, a bill authorizing the Commissioner of\r\nPatents to reconsider the application of Rollin White for extension of\r\nhis patents was introduced in the Senate and passed without debate. It\r\npassed the House without debate on the 10th of April, but failed to\r\nreceive the signature of the Vice-President before Congress adjourned.\r\nIt is understood that it has now been signed by that officer, and only\r\nawaits the approval of the President to become a law.\r\n\r\nUnless the ends of justice require the extension of this patent, it\r\nshould not be renewed. So far as I have been able to ascertain, justice\r\nto the Government and to the public forbids this patent from being\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\nThe validity of the patent has been questioned for many years, and it is\r\nunderstood that it was only affirmed by the Supreme Court by a tie vote,\r\nfour of the justices voting affirmatively and an equal number\r\nnegatively.\r\n\r\nIts renewal is urged by Rollin White upon the ground that he has not\r\nbeen sufficiently compensated for his invention. Rollin White has\r\nreceived nearly $71,000 as royalty. Smith & Wesson, for the years 1862,\r\n1863, 1864, 1865, 1866, 1867, and 1868, returned incomes amounting in\r\nthe aggregate to about $1,000,000. This was derived chiefly from the\r\nmanufacture of firearms under Rollin White's patent, that firm holding\r\nthe exclusive right to manufacture under it and being engaged almost\r\nexclusively in their manufacture.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the Government suffered inconvenience and\r\nembarrassment enough during the war in consequence of the inability of\r\nmanufacturers to use this patent, and that its further extension will\r\noperate prejudicially to its interest by compelling it to pay to parties\r\nalready well paid a large royalty for altering its revolvers to use\r\nmetallic cartridges.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I respectfully request that you will call the\r\nattention of the President of the United States to this subject before\r\nhe acts upon the bill which is now before him.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA.B. DYER,\r\n\r\n_Brevet Major-General, Chief of Ordnance_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 14, 1870_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI herewith return without my approval Senate bill No. 476, \"An act to\r\nfix the status of certain Federal soldiers enlisting in the Union Army\r\nfrom the States of Alabama and Florida,\" for the reasons embodied in the\r\nfollowing facts, which have been obtained from the office of the Second\r\nComptroller:\r\n\r\nThe First Regiment of Florida Cavalry, composed of six companies, was\r\norganized from December, 1862, to August, 1864, to serve three years.\r\nIt was mustered out of service November 17, 1865, by reason of general\r\norder from the War Department discharging all cavalry organizations east\r\nof the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe men of this regiment enlisting prior to July 18, 1864, received $25\r\nadvance bounty at muster-in, and the discharged soldiers and heirs of\r\nthose deceased have been paid the same bounty under act of July 22,\r\n1861, joint resolution of January 13, 1864, an act of July 28, 1866,\r\nas men enlisted at the same time in other volunteer organizations.\r\n\r\nThe Second Regiment of Florida Cavalry, composed of seven companies, was\r\norganized from December, 1863, to June, 1864, to serve three years. It\r\nwas mustered out November 29, 1865, by reason of the order discharging\r\ncavalry organizations east of the Mississippi. Most of the men received\r\nthe $25 advance bounty at muster-in, and the discharged men and heirs of\r\ndeceased men have received bounty under the several acts of Congress\r\ncited above, subject to the same conditions which apply to men who\r\nenlisted at the same time in other volunteer organizations.\r\n\r\nThe First Alabama Cavalry was originally organized as a one-year\r\nregiment from December, 1862, to September, 1863, and two companies\r\nof three-years men (Companies I and K) were added to complete its\r\norganization. These companies were formerly Companies D and E of the\r\nFirst Middle Tennessee Cavalry. Prior to the expiration of the term\r\nof the one-year men, the Adjutant-General of the Army, of date May 15,\r\n1863, authorized General Dodge to fill up this command, and in accordance\r\ntherewith the places of the companies discharged by reason of expiration\r\nof term were filled by companies of men enlisted for three years. The\r\noriginal companies, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and L, were organized from\r\nDecember, 1862, to September 25, 1863, and were discharged by companies\r\nfrom December 22, 1863, to September 28, 1864, in order as the term (one\r\nyear) of each company expired. Companies I and K, mustered in August,\r\n1862, to serve three years, were discharged in July, 1865, by reason\r\nof expiration of term of service. As reorganized under the order above\r\nmentioned, the regiment consisted of Companies A, B, C, D, E, and G,\r\norganized from February 5, 1864, to October, 1864, to serve three years;\r\nCompanies F, L, and M, organized from December 28, 1863, to October 31,\r\n1864, to serve one and three years; Company H, organized in March and\r\nApril, 1865, to serve three years, and Companies I and K, of the old\r\norganization described above. The men of the First Alabama Cavalry who\r\nenlisted for three years have been paid bounty under the several acts\r\nof Congress upon the same principles which apply to other three-years\r\nvolunteers. The one-year men enlisted prior to July 18, 1864, received\r\nno bounty, but $100 bounty has been paid the proper heirs of the\r\none-year men of this organization who died in the service, in accordance\r\nwith the act of July 22, 1861, under which the regiment was originally\r\norganized.\r\n\r\nSome of the men of these organizations were erroneously paid by the Pay\r\nDepartment at the time of their muster out of service, they having been\r\npaid but $100, when they should have been allowed $300 under the joint\r\nresolution of January 13, 1864. The balance of bounty due these men is\r\nbeing paid by the proper accounting officers. It will be seen by\r\ncomparing the above statement with the act under consideration that the\r\neffect of the act will be to give the one-year men of the First Alabama\r\nCavalry, nearly all of whom enlisted in 1862 and 1863, a bounty of $100\r\neach, or a proportionate part, according to the time served. It would\r\ngive each man of Companies I and K of the First Alabama Cavalry $100\r\nmore bounty. The bounty of the other three-years men of the First\r\nAlabama Cavalry, First Florida Cavalry, and Second Florida Cavalry, who\r\nenlisted prior to December 25, 1863, and from April 1, 1864, to July 17,\r\n1864, inclusive, and who were discharged by reason of orders from the\r\nWar Department, will not be affected.\r\n\r\nThe men enlisting in these organizations under joint resolution of\r\nJanuary 13, 1864, receive under existing laws $100 more bounty than they\r\nwould be entitled to receive if the act under consideration becomes a\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nIn case of deceased men the working of the act is still more perplexing,\r\nas the prescribed order of inheritance under the act of July 4, 1864, is\r\nentirely different from that under all other acts.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the claims in case of the deceased men have been\r\nsettled, and the bounties have been paid fathers, mothers, brothers,\r\nand sisters, the proper heirs under existing laws, which under this act\r\nwould go only to the widow, children, and widowed mother. Bounty has\r\nalso been paid to parents under act of July 28, 1866, which this act\r\nwould require to be paid to the widow, although she may have remarried.\r\n\r\nUnder the act of July 28, 1866, children of age are not entitled, but\r\nthis act makes them joint heirs with the minor children.\r\n\r\nIn case of the deceased one-year men, and the three-years men enlisted\r\nunder joint resolution of January 13, 1864, the effect of this act would\r\nonly be to change the prescribed order of inheritance.\r\n\r\nIn case of the three-years men enlisted under act of July 22, 1861, the\r\norder of inheritance is changed by this act, and the heirs entitled\r\n(widow, children, and widowed mother) will receive $100 more bounty than\r\nthey are now entitled to receive.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to state that November 14, 1864, the War Department gave\r\nauthority to enlist men who had deserted from the rebel army as recruits\r\nfor the First Alabama Cavalry, with the distinct understanding that they\r\nwere to receive no bounty.

If any ship\r\nof war or privateer of either belligerent shall, after the time this\r\nnotification takes effect, enter any port, harbor, roadstead, or waters\r\nof the United States, such vessel shall be required to depart and to\r\nput to sea within twenty-four hours after her entrance into such port,\r\nharbor, roadstead, or waters, except in case of stress of weather or of\r\nher requiring provisions or things necessary for the subsistence of her\r\ncrew or for repairs, in either of which cases the authorities of the\r\nport or of the nearest port (as the case may be) shall require her to\r\nput to sea as soon as possible after the expiration of such period of\r\ntwenty-four hours, without permitting her to take in supplies beyond\r\nwhat may be necessary for her immediate use; and no such vessel which\r\nmay have been permitted to remain within the waters of the United States\r\nfor the purpose of repair shall continue within such port, harbor,\r\nroadstead, or waters for a longer period than twenty-four hours after\r\nher necessary repairs shall have been completed, unless within such\r\ntwenty-four hours a vessel, whether ship of war, privateer, or merchant\r\nship, of the other belligerent shall have departed therefrom, in which\r\ncase the time limited for the departure of such ship of war or privateer\r\nshall be extended so far as may be necessary to secure an interval of\r\nnot less than twenty-four hours between such departure and that of any\r\nship of war, privateer, or merchant ship of the other belligerent which\r\nmay have previously quit the same port, harbor, roadstead, or waters.\r\nNo ship of war or privateer of either belligerent shall be detained in\r\nany port, harbor, roadstead, or waters of the United States more than\r\ntwenty-four hours by reason of the successive departures from such\r\nport, harbor, roadstead, or waters of more than one vessel of the other\r\nbelligerent. But if there be several vessels of each or either of the\r\ntwo belligerents in the same port, harbor, roadstead, or waters, the\r\norder of their departure therefrom shall be so arranged as to afford\r\nthe opportunity of leaving alternately to the vessels of the respective\r\nbelligerents and to cause the least detention consistent with the\r\nobjects of this proclamation. No ship of war or privateer of either\r\nbelligerent shall be permitted, while in any port, harbor, roadstead,\r\nor waters within the jurisdiction of the United States, to take in any\r\nsupplies except provisions and such other things as may be requisite\r\nfor the subsistence of her crew, and except so much coal only as may be\r\nsufficient to carry such vessel, if without sail power, to the nearest\r\nEuropean port of her own country, or, in case the vessel is rigged to go\r\nunder sail and may also be propelled by steam power, then with half the\r\nquantity of coal which she would be entitled to receive if dependent\r\nupon steam alone; and no coal shall be again supplied to any such ship\r\nof war or privateer in the same or any other port, harbor, roadstead, or\r\nwaters of the United States, without special permission, until after the\r\nexpiration of three months from the time when such coal may have been\r\nlast supplied to her within the waters of the United States, unless such\r\nship of war or privateer shall, since last thus supplied, have entered a\r\nEuropean port of the Government to which she belongs.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal\r\nof the United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 8th day of October, A.D. 1870, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States of America the ninety-fifth.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  HAMILTON FISH,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas divers evil-disposed persons have at sundry times within the\r\nterritory or jurisdiction of the United States begun or set on foot, or\r\nprovided or prepared the means for, military expeditions or enterprises\r\nto be carried on thence against the territories or dominions of powers\r\nwith whom the United States are at peace, by organizing bodies\r\npretending to have powers of government over portions of the territories\r\nor dominions of powers with whom the United States are at peace, or, by\r\nbeing or assuming to be members of such bodies, by levying or collecting\r\nmoney for the purpose or for the alleged purpose of using the same in\r\ncarrying on military enterprises against such territories or dominions\r\nby enlisting and organizing armed forces to be used against such powers,\r\nand by fitting out, equipping, and arming vessels to transport such\r\norganized armed forces to be employed in hostilities against such\r\npowers; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is alleged and there is reason to apprehend that such\r\nevil-disposed persons have also at sundry times within the territory and\r\njurisdiction of the United States violated the laws thereof by accepting\r\nand exercising commissions to serve by land or by sea against powers\r\nwith whom the United States are at peace by enlisting themselves or\r\nother persons to carry on war against such powers by fitting out and\r\narming vessels with intent that the same shall be employed to cruise or\r\ncommit hostilities against such powers, or by delivering commissions\r\nwithin the territory or jurisdiction of the United States for such\r\nvessels to the intent that they might be employed as aforesaid; and\r\n\r\nWhereas such acts are in violation of the laws of the United States in\r\nsuch case made and provided, and are done in disregard of the duties and\r\nobligations which all persons residing or being within the territory or\r\njurisdiction of the United States owe thereto, and are condemned by all\r\nright-minded and law-abiding citizens:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Ulysses S.

We have, through a kind Providence,\r\nbeen blessed with abundant crops, and have been spared from\r\ncomplications and war with foreign nations. In our midst comparative\r\nharmony has been restored. It is to be regretted, however, that a free\r\nexercise of the elective franchise has by violence and intimidation been\r\ndenied to citizens in exceptional cases in several of the States lately\r\nin rebellion, and the verdict of the people has thereby been reversed.\r\nThe States of Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas have been restored to\r\nrepresentation in our national councils. Georgia, the only State now\r\nwithout representation, may confidently be expected to take her place\r\nthere also at the beginning of the new year, and then, let us hope, will\r\nbe completed the work of reconstruction. With an acquiescence on the\r\npart of the whole people in the national obligation to pay the public\r\ndebt created as the price of our Union, the pensions to our disabled\r\nsoldiers and sailors and their widows and orphans, and in the changes to\r\nthe Constitution which have been made necessary by a great rebellion,\r\nthere is no reason why we should not advance in material prosperity and\r\nhappiness as no other nation ever did after so protracted and\r\ndevastating a war.\r\n\r\nSoon after the existing war broke out in Europe the protection of the\r\nUnited States minister in Paris was invoked in favor of North Germans\r\ndomiciled in French territory. Instructions were issued to grant\r\nthe protection. This has been followed by an extension of American\r\nprotection to citizens of Saxony, Hesse and Saxe-Coburg, Gotha,\r\nColombia, Portugal, Uruguay, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Chile,\r\nParaguay, and Venezuela in Paris. The charge was an onerous one,\r\nrequiring constant and severe labor, as well as the exercise of\r\npatience, prudence, and good judgment. It has been performed to the\r\nentire satisfaction of this Government, and, as I am officially\r\ninformed, equally so to the satisfaction of the Government of North\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I learned that a republic had been proclaimed at Paris and\r\nthat the people of France had acquiesced in the change, the minister\r\nof the United States was directed by telegraph to recognize it and to\r\ntender my congratulations and those of the people of the United States.\r\nThe reestablishment in France of a system of government disconnected\r\nwith the dynastic traditions of Europe appeared to be a proper subject\r\nfor the felicitations of Americans. Should the present struggle\r\nresult in attaching the hearts of the French to our simpler forms\r\nof representative government, it will be a subject of still further\r\nsatisfaction to our people. While we make no effort to impose our\r\ninstitutions upon the inhabitants of other countries, and while we\r\nadhere to our traditional neutrality in civil contests elsewhere, we can\r\nnot be indifferent to the spread of American political ideas in a great\r\nand highly civilized country like France.\r\n\r\nWe were asked by the new Government to use our good offices, jointly\r\nwith those of European powers, in the interests of peace. Answer was\r\nmade that the established policy and the true interests of the United\r\nStates forbade them to interfere in European questions jointly with\r\nEuropean powers. I ascertained, informally and unofficially, that the\r\nGovernment of North Germany was not then disposed to listen to such\r\nrepresentations from any power, and though earnestly wishing to see the\r\nblessings of peace restored to the belligerents, with all of whom the\r\nUnited States are on terms of friendship, I declined on the part of this\r\nGovernment to take a step which could only result in injury to our true\r\ninterests, without advancing the object for which our intervention was\r\ninvoked. Should the time come when the action of the United States\r\ncan hasten the return of peace by a single hour, that action will be\r\nheartily taken. I deemed it prudent, in view of the number of persons\r\nof German and French birth living in the United States, to issue, soon\r\nafter official notice of a state of war had been received from both\r\nbelligerents, a proclamation[29] defining the duties of the United\r\nStates as a neutral and the obligations of persons residing within\r\ntheir territory to observe their laws and the laws of nations. This\r\nproclamation was followed by others,[30] as circumstances seemed to call\r\nfor them. The people, thus acquainted in advance of their duties and\r\nobligations, have assisted in preventing violations of the neutrality\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is not understood that the condition of the insurrection in Cuba has\r\nmaterially changed since the close of the last session of Congress. In\r\nan early stage of the contest the authorities of Spain inaugurated a\r\nsystem of arbitrary arrests, of close confinement, and of military trial\r\nand execution of persons suspected of complicity with the insurgents,\r\nand of summary embargo of their properties, and sequestration of their\r\nrevenues by executive warrant. Such proceedings, so far as they affected\r\nthe persons or property of citizens of the United States, were in\r\nviolation of the provisions of the treaty of 1795 between the United\r\nStates and Spain.\r\n\r\nRepresentations of injuries resulting to several persons claiming to be\r\ncitizens of the United States by reason of such violations were made to\r\nthe Spanish Government. From April, 1869, to June last the Spanish\r\nminister at Washington had been clothed with a limited power to aid in\r\nredressing such wrongs. That power was found to be withdrawn, \"in view,\"\r\nas it was said, \"of the favorable situation in which the island of Cuba\"\r\nthen \"was,\" which, however, did not lead to a revocation or suspension\r\nof the extraordinary and arbitrary functions exercised by the executive\r\npower in Cuba, and we were obliged to make our complaints at Madrid. In\r\nthe negotiations thus opened, and still pending there, the United States\r\nonly claimed that for the future the rights secured to their citizens\r\nby treaty should be respected in Cuba, and that as to the past a\r\njoint tribunal should be established in the United States with full\r\njurisdiction over all such claims. Before such an impartial tribunal\r\neach claimant would be required to prove his case. On the other hand,\r\nSpain would be at liberty to traverse every material fact, and thus\r\ncomplete equity would be done. A case which at one time threatened\r\nseriously to affect the relations between the United States and Spain\r\nhas already been disposed of in this way. The claim of the owners of the\r\n_Colonel Lloyd Aspinwall_ for the illegal seizure and detention of that\r\nvessel was referred to arbitration by mutual consent, and has resulted\r\nin an award to the United States, for the owners, of the sum of\r\n$19,702.50 in gold. Another and long-pending claim of like nature, that\r\nof the whaleship _Canada_, has been disposed of by friendly arbitrament\r\nduring the present year. It was referred, by the joint consent of Brazil\r\nand the United States, to the decision of Sir Edward Thornton, Her\r\nBritannic Majesty's minister at Washington, who kindly undertook the\r\nlaborious task of examining the voluminous mass of correspondence and\r\ntestimony submitted by the two Governments, and awarded to the United\r\nStates the sum of $100,740.09 in gold, which has since been paid by the\r\nImperial Government. These recent examples show that the mode which the\r\nUnited States have proposed to Spain for adjusting the pending claims is\r\njust and feasible, and that it may be agreed to by either nation without\r\ndishonor. It is to be hoped that this moderate demand may be acceded\r\nto by Spain without further delay. Should the pending negotiations,\r\nunfortunately and unexpectedly, be without result, it will then become\r\nmy duty to communicate that fact to Congress and invite its action on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nThe long-deferred peace conference between Spain and the allied South\r\nAmerican Republics has been inaugurated in Washington under the auspices\r\nof the United States. Pursuant to the recommendation contained in the\r\nresolution of the House of Representatives of the 17th of December,\r\n1866, the executive department of the Government offered its friendly\r\noffices for the promotion of peace and harmony between Spain and the\r\nallied Republics. Hesitations and obstacles occurred to the acceptance\r\nof the offer. Ultimately, however, a conference was arranged, and was\r\nopened in this city on the 29th of October last, at which I authorized\r\nthe Secretary of State to preside. It was attended by the ministers of\r\nSpain, Peru, Chile, and Ecuador. In consequence of the absence of a\r\nrepresentative from Bolivia, the conference was adjourned until the\r\nattendance of a plenipotentiary from that Republic could be secured or\r\nother measures could be adopted toward compassing its objects.\r\n\r\nThe allied and other Republics of Spanish origin on this continent may\r\nsee in this fact a new proof of our sincere interest in their welfare,\r\nof our desire to see them blessed with good governments, capable of\r\nmaintaining order and of preserving their respective territorial\r\nintegrity, and of our sincere wish to extend our own commercial and\r\nsocial relations with them. The time is not probably far distant when,\r\nin the natural course of events, the European political connection with\r\nthis continent will cease. Our policy should be shaped, in view of this\r\nprobability, so as to ally the commercial interests of the Spanish\r\nAmerican States more closely to our own, and thus give the United States\r\nall the preeminence and all the advantage which Mr. Monroe, Mr. Adams,\r\nand Mr. Clay contemplated when they proposed to join in the congress of\r\nPanama.\r\n\r\nDuring the last session of Congress a treaty for the annexation of the\r\nRepublic of San Domingo to the United States failed to receive the\r\nrequisite two-thirds vote of the Senate. I was thoroughly convinced then\r\nthat the best interests of this country, commercially and materially,\r\ndemanded its ratification. Time has only confirmed me in this view.\r\nI now firmly believe that the moment it is known that the United States\r\nhave entirely abandoned the project of accepting as a part of its\r\nterritory the island of San Domingo a free port will be negotiated for\r\nby European nations in the Bay of Samana. A large commercial city will\r\nspring up, to which we will be tributary without receiving corresponding\r\nbenefits, and then will be seen the folly of our rejecting so great\r\na prize. The Government of San Domingo has voluntarily sought this\r\nannexation. It is a weak power, numbering probably less than 120,000\r\nsouls, and yet possessing one of the richest territories under the sun,\r\ncapable of supporting a population of 10,000,000 people in luxury. The\r\npeople of San Domingo are not capable of maintaining themselves in their\r\npresent condition, and must look for outside support. They yearn for\r\nthe protection of our free institutions and laws, our progress and\r\ncivilization. Shall we refuse them?\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of San Domingo is desirable because of its geographical\r\nposition. It commands the entrance to the Caribbean Sea and the Isthmus\r\ntransit of commerce. It possesses the richest soil, best and most\r\ncapacious harbors, most salubrious climate, and the most valuable\r\nproducts of the forests, mine, and soil of any of the West India\r\nIslands. Its possession by us will in a few years build up a coastwise\r\ncommerce of immense magnitude, which will go far toward restoring to us\r\nour lost merchant marine. It will give to us those articles which we\r\nconsume so largely and do not produce, thus equalizing our exports and\r\nimports. In case of foreign war it will give us command of all the\r\nislands referred to, and thus prevent an enemy from ever again\r\npossessing himself of rendezvous upon our very coast. At present our\r\ncoast trade between the States bordering on the Atlantic and those\r\nbordering on the Gulf of Mexico is cut into by the Bahamas and the\r\nAntilles, Twice we must, as it were, pass through foreign countries\r\nto get by sea from Georgia to the west coast of Florida.\r\n\r\nSan Domingo, with a stable government, under which her immense resources\r\ncan be developed, will give remunerative wages to tens of thousands of\r\nlaborers not now upon the island. This labor will take advantage of\r\nevery available means of transportation to abandon the adjacent islands\r\nand seek the blessings of freedom and its sequence--each inhabitant\r\nreceiving the reward of his own labor. Porto Rico and Cuba will have\r\nto abolish slavery, as a measure of self-preservation, to retain their\r\nlaborers.\r\n\r\nSan Domingo will become a large consumer of the products of Northern\r\nfarms and manufactories. The cheap rate at which her citizens can be\r\nfurnished with food, tools, and machinery will make it necessary that\r\ncontiguous islands should have the same advantages in order to compete\r\nin the production of sugar, coffee, tobacco, tropical fruits, etc. This\r\nwill open to us a still wider market for our products. The production\r\nof our own supply of these articles will cut off more than one hundred\r\nmillions of our annual imports, besides largely increasing our exports.\r\nWith such a picture it is easy to see how our large debt abroad is\r\nultimately to be extinguished. With a balance of trade against us\r\n(including interest on bonds held by foreigners and money spent by our\r\ncitizens traveling in foreign lands) equal to the entire yield of the\r\nprecious metals in this country, it is not so easy to see how this\r\nresult is to be otherwise accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of San Domingo is an adherence to the \"Monroe doctrine;\"\r\nit is a measure of national protection; it is asserting our just claim\r\nto a controlling influence over the great commercial traffic soon to\r\nflow from west to east by way of the Isthmus of Darien; it is to build\r\nup our merchant marine; it is to furnish new markets for the products of\r\nour farms, shops, and manufactories; it is to make slavery insupportable\r\nin Cuba and Porto Rico at once, and ultimately so in Brazil; it is to\r\nsettle the unhappy condition of Cuba and end an exterminating conflict;\r\nit is to provide honest means of paying our honest debts without\r\novertaxing the people; it is to furnish our citizens with the necessaries\r\nof everyday life at cheaper rates than ever before; and it is, in fine,\r\na rapid stride toward that greatness which the intelligence, industry,\r\nand enterprise of the citizens of the United States entitle this country\r\nto assume among nations.\r\n\r\nIn view of the importance of this question, I earnestly urge upon\r\nCongress early action expressive of its views as to the best means of\r\nacquiring San Domingo. My suggestion is that by joint resolution of\r\nthe two Houses of Congress the Executive be authorized to appoint a\r\ncommission to negotiate a treaty with the authorities of San Domingo\r\nfor the acquisition of that island, and that an appropriation be made\r\nto defray the expenses of such a commission. The question may then\r\nbe determined, either by the action of the Senate upon the treaty or\r\nthe joint action of the two Houses of Congress upon a resolution of\r\nannexation, as in the case of the acquisition of Texas. So convinced am\r\nI of the advantages to flow from the acquisition of San Domingo, and of\r\nthe great disadvantages--I might almost say calamities--to flow from\r\nnonacquisition, that I believe the subject has only to be investigated\r\nto be approved.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that our representations in regard to the\r\ninjurious effects, especially upon the revenue of the United States,\r\nof the policy of the Mexican Government in exempting from impost\r\nduties a large tract of its territory on our borders have not only been\r\nfruitless, but that it is even proposed in that country to extend the\r\nlimits within which the privilege adverted to has hitherto been enjoyed.\r\nThe expediency of taking into your serious consideration proper measures\r\nfor countervailing the policy referred to will, it is presumed, engage\r\nyour earnest attention.\r\n\r\nIt is the obvious interest, especially of neighboring nations, to\r\nprovide against impunity to those who may have committed high crimes\r\nwithin their borders and who may have sought refuge abroad. For this\r\npurpose extradition treaties have been concluded with several of the\r\nCentral American Republics, and others are in progress.\r\n\r\nThe sense of Congress is desired, as early as may be convenient, upon\r\nthe proceedings of the commission on claims against Venezuela, as\r\ncommunicated in my messages of March 16, 1869, March 1, 1870, and March\r\n31, 1870. It has not been deemed advisable to distribute any of the\r\nmoney which has been received from that Government until Congress shall\r\nhave acted on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe massacres of French and Russian residents at Tien-Tsin, under\r\ncircumstances of great barbarity, was supposed by some to have been\r\npremeditated, and to indicate a purpose among the populace to\r\nexterminate foreigners in the Chinese Empire. The evidence fails to\r\nestablish such a supposition, but shows a complicity between the local\r\nauthorities and the mob. The Government at Peking, however, seems to\r\nhave been disposed to fulfill its treaty obligations so far as it was\r\nable to do so. Unfortunately, the news of the war between the German\r\nStates and France reached China soon after the massacre. It would appear\r\nthat the popular mind became possessed with the idea that this contest,\r\nextending to Chinese waters, would neutralize the Christian influence\r\nand power, and that the time was coming when the superstitious masses\r\nmight expel all foreigners and restore mandarin influence. Anticipating\r\ntrouble from this cause, I invited France and North Germany to make\r\nan authorized suspension of hostilities in the East (where they were\r\ntemporarily suspended by act of the commanders), and to act together for\r\nthe future protection in China of the lives and properties of Americans\r\nand Europeans.\r\n\r\nSince the adjournment of Congress the ratifications of the treaty with\r\nGreat Britain for abolishing the mixed courts for the suppression of the\r\nslave trade have been exchanged. It is believed that the slave trade is\r\nnow confined to the eastern coast of Africa, whence the slaves are taken\r\nto Arabian markets.\r\n\r\nThe ratifications of the naturalization convention between Great Britain\r\nand the United States have also been exchanged during the recess, and\r\nthus a long-standing dispute between the two Governments has been\r\nsettled in accordance with the principles always contended for by the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIn April last, while engaged in locating a military reservation near\r\nPembina, a corps of engineers discovered that the commonly received\r\nboundary line between the United States and the British possessions\r\nat that place is about 4,700 feet south of the true position of the\r\nforty-ninth parallel, and that the line, when run on what is now\r\nsupposed to be the true position of that parallel, would leave the fort\r\nof the Hudsons Bay Company at Pembina within the territory of the United\r\nStates. This information being communicated to the British Government,\r\nI was requested to consent, and did consent, that the British occupation\r\nof the fort of the Hudsons Bay Company should continue for the present.\r\nI deem it important, however, that this part of the boundary line should\r\nbe definitely fixed by a joint commission of the two Governments, and\r\nI submit herewith estimates of the expense of such a commission on the\r\npart of the United States and recommend that an appropriation be made\r\nfor that purpose. The land boundary has already been fixed and marked\r\nfrom the summit of the Rocky Mountains to the Georgian Bay. It should\r\nnow be in like manner marked from the Lake of the Woods to the summit\r\nof the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nI regret to say that no conclusion has been reached for the adjustment\r\nof the claims against Great Britain growing out of the course adopted\r\nby that Government during the rebellion. The cabinet of London, so far\r\nas its views have been expressed, does not appear to be willing to\r\nconcede that Her Majesty's Government was guilty of any negligence,\r\nor did or permitted any act during the war by which the United States\r\nhas just cause of complaint. Our firm and unalterable convictions are\r\ndirectly the reverse. I therefore recommend to Congress to authorize\r\nthe appointment of a commission to take proof of the amount and the\r\nownership of these several claims, on notice to the representative\r\nof Her Majesty at Washington, and that authority be given for the\r\nsettlement of these claims by the United States, so that the Government\r\nshall have the ownership of the private claims, as well as the\r\nresponsible control of all the demands against Great Britain. It can\r\nnot be necessary to add that whenever Her Majesty's Government shall\r\nentertain a desire for a full and friendly adjustment of these claims\r\nthe United States will enter upon their consideration with an earnest\r\ndesire for a conclusion consistent with the honor and dignity of both\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThe course pursued by the Canadian authorities toward the fishermen\r\nof the United States during the past season has not been marked by a\r\nfriendly feeling. By the first article of the convention of 1818 between\r\nGreat Britain and the United States it was agreed that the inhabitants\r\nof the United States should have forever, in common with British\r\nsubjects, the right of taking fish in certain waters therein defined.\r\nIn the waters not included in the limits named in the convention (within\r\n3 miles of parts of the British coast) it has been the custom for many\r\nyears to give to intruding fishermen of the United States a reasonable\r\nwarning of their violation of the technical rights of Great Britain.\r\nThe Imperial Government is understood to have delegated the whole or a\r\nshare of its jurisdiction or control of these inshore fishing grounds\r\nto the colonial authority known as the Dominion of Canada, and this\r\nsemi-independent but irresponsible agent has exercised its delegated\r\npowers in an unfriendly way. Vessels have been seized without notice or\r\nwarning, in violation of the custom previously prevailing, and have been\r\ntaken into the colonial ports, their voyages broken up, and the vessels\r\ncondemned. There is reason to believe that this unfriendly and vexatious\r\ntreatment was designed to bear harshly upon the hardy fishermen of the\r\nUnited States, with a view to political effect upon this Government.\r\nThe statutes of the Dominion of Canada assume a still broader and more\r\nuntenable jurisdiction over the vessels of the United States. They\r\nauthorize officers or persons to bring vessels hovering within 3 marine\r\nmiles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks, or harbors of Canada into\r\nport, to search the cargo, to examine the master on oath touching the\r\ncargo and voyage, and to inflict upon him a heavy pecuniary penalty if\r\ntrue answers are not given; and if such a vessel is found \"preparing\r\nto fish\" within 3 marine miles of any of such coasts, bays, creeks, or\r\nharbors without a license, or after the expiration of the period named\r\nin the last license granted to it, they provide that the vessel,\r\nwith her tackle, etc., shall be forfeited. It is not known that any\r\ncondemnations have been made under this statute. Should the authorities\r\nof Canada attempt to enforce it, it will become my duty to take such\r\nsteps as may be necessary to protect the rights of the citizens of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed by Her Majesty's officers that the fishing vessels\r\nof the United States have no right to enter the open ports of the\r\nBritish possessions in North America, except for the purposes of shelter\r\nand repairing damages, of purchasing wood and obtaining water; that they\r\nhave no right to enter at the British custom-houses or to trade there\r\nexcept in the purchase of wood and water, and that they must depart\r\nwithin twenty-four hours after notice to leave. It is not known that any\r\nseizure of a fishing vessel carrying the flag of the United States has\r\nbeen made under this claim. So far as the claim is founded on an alleged\r\nconstruction of the convention of 1818, it can not be acquiesced in by\r\nthe United States. It is hoped that it will not be insisted on by Her\r\nMajesty's Government.\r\n\r\nDuring the conferences which preceded the negotiation of the convention\r\nof 1818 the British commissioners proposed to expressly exclude the\r\nfishermen of the United States from \"the privilege of carrying on trade\r\nwith any of His Britannic Majesty's subjects residing within the limits\r\nassigned for their use;\" and also that it should not be \"lawful for the\r\nvessels of the United States engaged in said fishery to have on board\r\nany goods, wares, or merchandise whatever, except such as may be\r\nnecessary for the prosecution of their voyages to and from the said\r\nfishing grounds; and any vessel of the United States which shall\r\ncontravene this regulation may be seized, condemned, and confiscated,\r\nwith her cargo.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposition, which is identical with the construction now put\r\nupon the language of the convention, was emphatically rejected by the\r\nAmerican commissioners, and thereupon was abandoned by the British\r\nplenipotentiaries, and Article I, as it stands in the convention, was\r\nsubstituted.\r\n\r\nIf, however, it be said that this claim is founded on provincial or\r\ncolonial statutes, and not upon the convention, this Government can not\r\nbut regard them as unfriendly, and in contravention of the spirit, if\r\nnot of the letter, of the treaty, for the faithful execution of which\r\nthe Imperial Government is alone responsible.\r\n\r\nAnticipating that an attempt may possibly be made by the Canadian\r\nauthorities in the coming season to repeat their unneighborly acts\r\ntoward our fishermen, I recommend you to confer upon the Executive the\r\npower to suspend by proclamation the operation of the laws authorizing\r\nthe transit of goods, wares, and merchandise in bond across the\r\nterritory of the United States to Canada, and, further, should such an\r\nextreme measure become necessary, to suspend the operation of any laws\r\nwhereby the vessels of the Dominion of Canada are permitted to enter the\r\nwaters of the United States.\r\n\r\nA like unfriendly disposition has been manifested on the part of Canada\r\nin the maintenance of a claim of right to exclude the citizens of the\r\nUnited States from the navigation of the St. Lawrence. This river\r\nconstitutes a natural outlet to the ocean for eight States, with an\r\naggregate population of about 17,600,000 inhabitants, and with an\r\naggregate tonnage of 661,367 tons upon the waters which discharge into\r\nit. The foreign commerce of our ports on these waters is open to British\r\ncompetition, and the major part of it is done in British bottoms.\r\n\r\nIf the American seamen be excluded from this natural avenue to the\r\nocean, the monopoly of the direct commerce of the lake ports with the\r\nAtlantic would be in foreign hands, their vessels on transatlantic\r\nvoyages having an access to our lake ports which would be denied to\r\nAmerican vessels on similar voyages. To state such a proposition is\r\nto refute its justice.\r\n\r\nDuring the Administration of Mr. John Quincy Adams Mr. Clay unanswerably\r\ndemonstrated the natural right of the citizens of the United States to\r\nthe navigation of this river, claiming that the act of the congress of\r\nVienna in opening the Rhine and other rivers to all nations showed the\r\njudgment of European jurists and statesmen that the inhabitants of a\r\ncountry through which a navigable river passes have a natural right to\r\nenjoy the navigation of that river to and into the sea, even though\r\npassing through the territories of another power. This right does not\r\nexclude the coequal right of the sovereign possessing the territory\r\nthrough which the river debouches into the sea to make such regulations\r\nrelative to the police of the navigation as may be reasonably necessary;\r\nbut those regulations should be framed in a liberal spirit of comity,\r\nand should not impose needless burdens upon the commerce which has the\r\nright of transit. It has been found in practice more advantageous to\r\narrange these regulations by mutual agreement. The United States are\r\nready to make any reasonable arrangement as to the police of the St.\r\nLawrence which may be suggested by Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIf the claim made by Mr. Clay was just when the population of States\r\nbordering on the shores of the Lakes was only 3,400,000, it now derives\r\ngreater force and equity from the increased population, wealth,\r\nproduction, and tonnage of the States on the Canadian frontier. Since\r\nMr. Clay advanced his argument in behalf of our right the principle\r\nfor which he contended has been frequently, and by various nations,\r\nrecognized by law or by treaty, and has been extended to several other\r\ngreat rivers. By the treaty concluded at Mayence in 1831 the Rhine was\r\ndeclared free from the point where it is first navigable into the sea.\r\nBy the convention between Spain and Portugal concluded in 1835 the\r\nnavigation of the Douro throughout its whole extent was made free for\r\nthe subjects of both Crowns. In 1853 the Argentine Confederation by\r\ntreaty threw open the free navigation of the Parana and the Uruguay to\r\nthe merchant vessels of all nations. In 1856 the Crimean War was closed\r\nby a treaty which provided for the free navigation of the Danube.\r\nIn 1858 Bolivia by treaty declared that it regarded the rivers Amazon\r\nand La Plata, in accordance with fixed principles of national law, as\r\nhighways or channels opened by nature for the commerce of all nations.\r\nIn 1859 the Paraguay was made free by treaty, and in December, 1866,\r\nthe Emperor of Brazil by imperial decree declared the Amazon to be open\r\nto the frontier of Brazil to the merchant ships of all nations. The\r\ngreatest living British authority on this subject, while asserting the\r\nabstract right of the British claim, says:\r\n\r\n  It seems difficult to deny that Great Britain may ground her refusal\r\n  upon strict _law_, but it is equally difficult to deny, first, that in\r\n  so doing she exercises harshly an extreme and hard law; secondly, that\r\n  her conduct with respect to the navigation of the St. Lawrence is in\r\n  glaring and discreditable inconsistency with her conduct with respect\r\n  to the navigation of the Mississippi. On the ground that she possessed\r\n  a small domain in which the Mississippi took its rise, she insisted on\r\n  the right to navigate the entire volume of its waters. On the ground\r\n  that she possesses both banks of the St. Lawrence, where it disembogues\r\n  itself into the sea, she denies to the United States the right of\r\n  navigation, though about one-half of the waters of Lakes Ontario, Erie,\r\n  Huron, and Superior, and the whole of Lake Michigan, through which the\r\n  river flows, are the property of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole nation is interested in securing cheap transportation from\r\nthe agricultural States of the West to the Atlantic Seaboard. To the\r\ncitizens of those States it secures a greater return for their labor; to\r\nthe inhabitants of the seaboard it affords cheaper food; to the nation,\r\nan increase in the annual surplus of wealth. It is hoped that the\r\nGovernment of Great Britain will see the justice of abandoning the\r\nnarrow and inconsistent claim to which her Canadian Provinces have urged\r\nher adherence.\r\n\r\nOur depressed commerce is a subject to which I called your special\r\nattention at the last session, and suggested that we will in the future\r\nhave to look more to the countries south of us, and to China and Japan,\r\nfor its revival. Our representatives to all these Governments have\r\nexerted their influence to encourage trade between the United States and\r\nthe countries to which they are accredited. But the fact exists that the\r\ncarrying is done almost entirely in foreign bottoms, and while this\r\nstate of affairs exists we can not control our due share of the commerce\r\nof the world; that between the Pacific States and China and Japan is\r\nabout all the carrying trade now conducted in American vessels. I would\r\nrecommend a liberal policy toward that line of American steamers--one\r\nthat will insure its success, and even increased usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe cost of building iron vessels, the only ones that can compete with\r\nforeign ships in the carrying trade, is so much greater in the United\r\nStates than in foreign countries that without some assistance from the\r\nGovernment they can not be successfully built here. There will be\r\nseveral propositions laid before Congress in the course of the present\r\nsession looking to a remedy for this evil. Even if it should be at some\r\ncost to the National Treasury, I hope such encouragement will be given\r\nas will secure American shipping on the high seas and American\r\nshipbuilding at home.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the archives at the Department of State calls for the\r\nearly action of Congress. The building now rented by that Department\r\nis a frail structure, at an inconvenient distance from the Executive\r\nMansion and from the other Departments, is ill adapted to the purpose\r\nfor which it is used, has not capacity to accommodate the archives, and\r\nis not fireproof. Its remote situation, its slender construction, and\r\nthe absence of a supply of water in the neighborhood leave but little\r\nhope of safety for either the building or its contents in case of the\r\naccident of a fire. Its destruction would involve the loss of the\r\nrolls containing the original acts and resolutions of Congress, of the\r\nhistoric records of the Revolution and of the Confederation, of the\r\nwhole series of diplomatic and consular archives since the adoption of\r\nthe Constitution, and of the many other valuable records and papers\r\nleft with that Department when it was the principal depository of the\r\ngovernmental archives. I recommend an appropriation for the construction\r\nof a building for the Department of State.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your consideration the propriety of transferring to the\r\nDepartment of the Interior, to which they seem more appropriately to\r\nbelong, all powers and duties in relation to the Territories with which\r\nthe Department of State is now charged by law or usage; and from the\r\nInterior Department to the War Department the Pension Bureau, so far\r\nas it regulates the payment of soldiers' pensions. I would further\r\nrecommend that the payment of naval pensions be transferred to one of\r\nthe bureaus of the Navy Department.\r\n\r\nThe estimates for the expenses of the Government for the next fiscal\r\nyear are $18,244,346.01 less than for the current one, but exceed the\r\nappropriations for the present year for the same items $8,972,127.56.\r\nIn this estimate, however, is included $22,338,278.37 for public works\r\nheretofore begun under Congressional provision, and of which only so\r\nmuch is asked as Congress may choose to give. The appropriation for\r\nthe same works for the present fiscal year was $11,984,518.08.\r\n\r\nThe average value of gold, as compared with national currency, for the\r\nwhole of the year 1869 was about 134, and for eleven months of 1870 the\r\nsame relative value has been about 115. The approach to a specie basis\r\nis very gratifying, but the fact can not be denied that the instability\r\nof the value of our currency is prejudicial to our prosperity, and tends\r\nto keep up prices, to the detriment of trade. The evils of a depreciated\r\nand fluctuating currency are so great that now, when the premium on gold\r\nhas fallen so much, it would seem that the time has arrived when by wise\r\nand prudent legislation Congress should look to a policy which would\r\nplace our currency at par with gold at no distant day.\r\n\r\nThe tax collected from the people has been reduced more than $80,000,000\r\nper annum. By steadiness in our present course there is no reason why in\r\na few short years the national taxgatherer may not disappear from the\r\ndoor of the citizen almost entirely. With the revenue stamp dispensed\r\nby postmasters in every community, a tax upon liquors of all sorts and\r\ntobacco in all its forms, and by a wise adjustment of the tariff, which\r\nwill put a duty only upon those articles which we could dispense with,\r\nknown as luxuries, and on those which we use more of than we produce,\r\nrevenue enough may be raised after a few years of peace and consequent\r\nreduction of indebtedness to fulfill all our obligations. A further\r\nreduction of expenses, in addition to a reduction of interest account,\r\nmay be relied on to make this practicable. Revenue reform, if it means\r\nthis, has my hearty support. If it implies a collection of all the\r\nrevenue for the support of the Government, for the payment of principal\r\nand interest of the public debt, pensions, etc., by directly taxing the\r\npeople, then I am against revenue reform, and confidently believe the\r\npeople are with me. If it means failure to provide the necessary means\r\nto defray all the expenses of Government, and thereby repudiation of\r\nthe public debt and pensions, then I am still more opposed to such kind\r\nof revenue reform. Revenue reform has not been defined by any of its\r\nadvocates to my knowledge, but seems to be accepted as something which\r\nis to supply every man's wants without any cost or effort on his part.\r\n\r\nA true revenue reform can not be made in a day, but must be the work\r\nof national legislation and of time. As soon as the revenue can be\r\ndispensed with, all duty should be removed from coffee, tea, and other\r\narticles of universal use not produced by ourselves. The necessities of\r\nthe country compel us to collect revenue from our imports. An army of\r\nassessors and collectors is not a pleasant sight to the citizen, but\r\nthat or a tariff for revenue is necessary. Such a tariff, so far as it\r\nacts as an encouragement to home production, affords employment to labor\r\nat living wages, in contrast to the pauper labor of the Old World, and\r\nalso in the development of home resources.\r\n\r\nUnder the act of Congress of the 15th day of July, 1870, the Army has\r\ngradually been reduced, so that on the 1st day of January, 1871, the\r\nnumber of commissioned officers and men will not exceed the number\r\ncontemplated by that law.\r\n\r\nThe War Department building is an old structure, not fireproof, and\r\nentirely inadequate in dimensions to our present wants. Many thousands\r\nof dollars are now paid annually for rent of private buildings to\r\naccommodate the various bureaus of the Department. I recommend an\r\nappropriation for a new War Department building, suited to the present\r\nand growing wants of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War shows a very satisfactory reduction\r\nin the expenses of the Army for the last fiscal year. For details you\r\nare referred to his accompanying report.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the Navy for the whole of the last year--i.e.,\r\nfrom December 1, 1869, the date of the last report--are less than\r\n$19,000,000, or about $1,000,000 less than they were the previous year.\r\nThe expenses since the commencement of this fiscal year--i.e., since\r\nJuly 1--show for the five months a decrease of over $2,400,000 from\r\nthose of the corresponding months last year. The estimates for the\r\ncurrent year were $28,205,671.37. Those for next year are $20,683,317,\r\nwith $955,100 additional for necessary permanent improvements. These\r\nestimates are made closely for the mere maintenance of the naval\r\nestablishment as it now is, without much in the nature of permanent\r\nimprovement. The appropriations made for the last and current years were\r\nevidently intended by Congress, and are sufficient only, to keep the\r\nNavy on its present footing by the repairing and refitting of our old\r\nships.\r\n\r\nThis policy must, of course, gradually but surely destroy the Navy, and\r\nit is in itself far from economical, as each year that it is pursued\r\nthe necessity for mere repairs in ships and navy-yards becomes more\r\nimperative and more costly, and our current expenses are annually\r\nincreased for the mere repair of ships, many of which must soon become\r\nunsafe and useless. I hope during the present session of Congress to be\r\nable to submit to it a plan by which naval vessels can be built and\r\nrepairs made with great saving upon the present cost.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be wise statesmanship in a Government which represents a\r\ncountry with over 5,000 miles of coast line on both oceans, exclusive\r\nof Alaska, and containing 40,000,000 progressive people, with relations\r\nof every nature with almost every foreign country, to rest with such\r\ninadequate means of enforcing any foreign policy, either of protection\r\nor redress. Separated by the ocean from the nations of the Eastern\r\nContinent, our Navy is our only means of direct protection to our\r\ncitizens abroad or for the enforcement of any foreign policy.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Postmaster-General shows a most\r\nsatisfactory working of that Department. With the adoption of the\r\nrecommendations contained therein, particularly those relating to a\r\nreform in the franking privilege and the adoption of the \"correspondence\r\ncards,\" a self-sustaining postal system may speedily be looked for, and\r\nat no distant day a further reduction of the rate of postage be\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nI recommend authorization by Congress to the Postmaster-General and\r\nAttorney-General to issue all commissions to officials appointed through\r\ntheir respective Departments. At present these commissions, where\r\nappointments are Presidential, are issued by the State Department.\r\nThe law in all the Departments of Government, except those of the\r\nPost-Office and of Justice, authorizes each to issue its own\r\ncommissions.\r\n\r\nAlways favoring practical reforms, I respectfully call your attention to\r\none abuse of long standing which I would like to see remedied by this\r\nCongress. It is a reform in the civil service of the country. I would\r\nhave it go beyond the mere fixing of the tenure of office of clerks\r\nand employees who do not require \"the advice and consent of the Senate\"\r\nto make their appointments complete. I would have it govern, not the\r\ntenure, but the manner of making all appointments. There is no duty\r\nwhich so much embarrasses the Executive and heads of Departments as\r\nthat of appointments, nor is there any such arduous and thankless labor\r\nimposed on Senators and Representatives as that of finding places for\r\nconstituents. The present system does not secure the best men, and often\r\nnot even fit men, for public place. The elevation and purification of\r\nthe civil service of the Government will be hailed with approval by the\r\nwhole people of the United States.\r\n\r\nReform in the management of Indian affairs has received the special\r\nattention of the Administration from its inauguration to the present\r\nday. The experiment of making it a missionary work was tried with a few\r\nagencies given to the denomination of Friends, and has been found to\r\nwork most advantageously. All agencies and superintendencies not so\r\ndisposed of were given to officers of the Army. The act of Congress\r\nreducing the Army renders army officers ineligible for civil positions.\r\nIndian agencies being civil offices, I determined to give all the\r\nagencies to such religious denominations as had heretofore established\r\nmissionaries among the Indians, and perhaps to some other denominations\r\nwho would undertake the work on the same terms--i.e. as a missionary\r\nwork. The societies selected are allowed to name their own agents,\r\nsubject to the approval of the Executive, and are expected to watch over\r\nthem and aid them as missionaries, to Christianize and civilize the\r\nIndian, and to train him in the arts of peace. The Government watches\r\nover the official acts of these agents, and requires of them as strict\r\nan accountability as if they were appointed in any other manner.\r\nI entertain the confident hope that the policy now pursued will in a\r\nfew years bring all the Indians upon reservations, where they will live\r\nin houses, and have schoolhouses and churches, and will be pursuing\r\npeaceful and self-sustaining avocations, and where they may be visited\r\nby the law-abiding white man with the same impunity that he now visits\r\nthe civilized white settlements. I call your special attention to the\r\nreport of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for full information on\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year 8,095,413 acres of public land were disposed\r\nof. Of this quantity 3,698,910.05 acres were taken under the homestead\r\nlaw and 2,159,515.81 acres sold for cash. The remainder was located with\r\nmilitary warrants, college or Indian scrip, or applied in satisfaction\r\nof grants to railroads or for other public uses. The entries under the\r\nhomestead law during the last year covered 961,545 acres more than those\r\nduring the preceding year. Surveys have been vigorously prosecuted to\r\nthe full extent of the means applicable to the purpose. The quantity of\r\nland in market will amply supply the present demand. The claim of the\r\nsettler under the homestead or the preemption laws is not, however,\r\nlimited to lands subject to sale at private entry. Any unappropriated\r\nsurveyed public land may, to a limited amount, be acquired under the\r\nformer laws if the party entitled to enter under them will comply\r\nwith the requirements they prescribe in regard to the residence and\r\ncultivation. The actual settler's preference right of purchase is even\r\nbroader, and extends to lands which were unsurveyed at the time of his\r\nsettlement. His right was formerly confined within much narrower limits,\r\nand at one period of our history was conferred only by special statutes.\r\nThey were enacted from time to time to legalize what was then regarded\r\nas an unauthorized intrusion upon the national domain. The opinion that\r\nthe public lands should be regarded chiefly as a source of revenue is no\r\nlonger maintained. The rapid settlement and successful cultivation of\r\nthem are now justly considered of more importance to our well-being than\r\nis the fund which the sale of them would produce. The remarkable growth\r\nand prosperity of our new States and Territories attest the wisdom\r\nof the legislation which invites the tiller of the soil to secure a\r\npermanent home on terms within the reach of all. The pioneer who incurs\r\nthe dangers and privations of a frontier life, and thus aids in laying\r\nthe foundation of new commonwealths, renders a signal service to his\r\ncountry, and is entitled to its special favor and protection. These laws\r\nsecure that object and largely promote the general welfare. They should\r\ntherefore be cherished as a permanent feature of our land system.\r\n\r\nGood faith requires us to give full effect to existing grants. The\r\ntime-honored and beneficent policy of setting apart certain sections\r\nof public land for educational purposes in the new States should be\r\ncontinued. When ample provision shall have been made for these objects,\r\nI submit as a question worthy of serious consideration whether the\r\nresidue of our national domain should not be wholly disposed of under\r\nthe provisions of the homestead and preemption laws.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the swamp and overflowed lands granted to the States in\r\nwhich they are situated, the lands taken under the agricultural-college\r\nacts and for internal-improvement purposes under the act of September,\r\n1841, and the acts supplemental thereto, there had been conveyed up to\r\nthe close of the last fiscal year, by patent or other equivalent title,\r\nto States and corporations 27,836,257.63 acres for railways, canals, and\r\nwagon roads. It is estimated that an additional quantity of 174,735,523\r\nacres is still due under grants for like uses. The policy of thus aiding\r\nthe States in building works of internal improvement was inaugurated\r\nmore than forty years since in the grants to Indiana and Illinois, to\r\naid those States in opening canals to connect the waters of the Wabash\r\nwith those of Lake Erie and the waters of the Illinois with those of\r\nLake Michigan. It was followed, with some modifications, in the grant to\r\nIllinois of alternate sections of public land within certain limits of\r\nthe Illinois Central Railway. Fourteen States and sundry corporations\r\nhave received similar subsidies in connection with railways completed\r\nor in process of construction. As the reserved sections are rated\r\nat the double minimum, the sale of them at the enhanced price has\r\nthus in many instances indemnified the Treasury for the granted lands.\r\nThe construction of some of these thoroughfares has undoubtedly given a\r\nvigorous impulse to the development of our resources and the settlement\r\nof the more distant portions of the country. It may, however, be well\r\ninsisted that much of our legislation in this regard has been\r\ncharacterized by indiscriminate and profuse liberality. The United\r\nStates should not loan their credit in aid of any enterprise undertaken\r\nby States or corporations, nor grant lands in any instance, unless the\r\nprojected work is of acknowledged national importance. I am strongly\r\ninclined to the opinion that it is inexpedient and unnecessary to bestow\r\nsubsidies of either description; but should Congress determine otherwise\r\nI earnestly recommend that the right of settlers and of the public be\r\nmore effectually secured and protected by appropriate legislation.\r\n\r\nDuring the year ending September 30, 1870, there were filed in the\r\nPatent Office 19,411 applications for patents, 3,374 caveats, and 160\r\napplications for the extension of patents. Thirteen thousand six hundred\r\nand twenty-two patents, including reissues and designs, were issued,\r\n1,010 extended, and 1,089 allowed, but not issued by reason of the\r\nnon-payment of the final fees. The receipts of the office during the\r\nfiscal year were $136,304.29 in excess of its expenditures.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Census Bureau has been energetically prosecuted. The\r\npreliminary report, containing much information of special value and\r\ninterest, will be ready for delivery during the present session. The\r\nremaining volumes will be completed with all the dispatch consistent\r\nwith perfect accuracy in arranging and classifying the returns. We shall\r\nthus at no distant day be furnished with an authentic record of our\r\ncondition and resources. It will, I doubt not, attest the growing\r\nprosperity of the country, although during the decade which has just\r\nclosed it was so severely tried by the great war waged to maintain its\r\nintegrity and to secure and perpetuate our free institutions.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year the sum paid to pensioners, including the\r\ncost of disbursement, was $27,780,811.11, and 1,758 bounty-land warrants\r\nwere issued. At its close 198,686 names were on the pension rolls.\r\n\r\nThe labors of the Pension Office have been directed to the severe\r\nscrutiny of the evidence submitted in favor of new claims and to the\r\ndiscovery of fictitious claims which have been heretofore allowed. The\r\nappropriation for the employment of special agents for the investigation\r\nof frauds has been judiciously used, and the results obtained have been\r\nof unquestionable benefit to the service.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of education and agriculture are of great interest to the\r\nsuccess of our republican institutions, happiness, and grandeur as a\r\nnation. In the interest of one a bureau has been established in the\r\nInterior Department--the Bureau of Education; and in the interest of\r\nthe other, a separate Department, that of Agriculture. I believe great\r\ngeneral good is to flow from the operations of both these Bureaus if\r\nproperly fostered. I can not commend to your careful consideration too\r\nhighly the reports of the Commissioners of Education and of Agriculture,\r\nnor urge too strongly such liberal legislation as to secure their\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I would sum up the policy of the Administration to be a\r\nthorough enforcement of every law; a faithful collection of every tax\r\nprovided for; economy in the disbursement of the same; a prompt payment\r\nof every debt of the nation; a reduction of taxes as rapidly as the\r\nrequirements of the country will admit; reductions of taxation and\r\ntariff, to be so arranged as to afford the greatest relief to the\r\ngreatest number; honest and fair dealings with all other peoples, to the\r\nend that war, with all its blighting consequences, may be avoided, but\r\nwithout surrendering any right or obligation due to us; a reform in the\r\ntreatment of Indians and in the whole civil service of the country;\r\nand finally, in securing a pure, untrammeled ballot, where every man\r\nentitled to cast a vote may do so, just once at each election, without\r\nfear of molestation or proscription on account of his political faith,\r\nnativity, or color.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: See pp. 86-89.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: See pp. 89-92.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 6, 1870.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the provisions of the second section of an act approved\r\nJune 20, 1864, entitled \"An act making appropriations for the consular\r\nand diplomatic expenses of the Government for the year ending June 30,\r\n1865, and for other purposes,\" I inform Congress that Louis W.

also\r\nherewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 11, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn view of a proclamation having been published in newspapers of the\r\nUnited States purporting to emanate from Cabral, a chieftain who opposed\r\nthe constitutional authorities of the Republic of San Domingo, I deem it\r\nbut just to communicate to the Senate of the United States the views of\r\nthat chieftain and his followers, as voluntarily communicated by him\r\nthrough the United States minister to the Republic of Hayti in June\r\nlast. It will be observed by the letter of Minister Bassett that Cabral\r\ndid not wish his views to be made public before the question of\r\nannexation was disposed of, in a way to work prejudice to his interest.\r\nBut as the object which Cabral had already in view was to declare to\r\nthe treaty-making power of the United States his views and those of his\r\nfollowers upon the subject of annexation of the Republic of San Domingo,\r\nand as the Senate is a branch of that power, I deem it no breach of\r\nconfidence to communicate this letter to the Senate. I ask, however,\r\nthat it may be read in executive session and that the request of Cabral\r\nbe observed, so that in no case they shall be made public or used\r\nagainst him until the question of annexation is disposed of.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 11, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in reply to the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 5th instant, copies of the reports of Captain\r\nGeorge B.

The original reports and papers are too voluminous to\r\nbe copied in season to be used by the present Congress, but are easily\r\naccessible for reference, and copies of such papers can be furnished as\r\nthe Senate may deem necessary.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 16, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, in answer to their resolution of 4th instant,\r\na report from the Secretary of State, with accompanying documents,\r\nrelating to the proposed annexation of the Dominican portion of the\r\nisland of San Domingo.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 17, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to their resolution of the 16th of December, 1870, I herewith\r\ntransmit copies of certain reports received at the War Department\r\nrelative to disloyal organizations in the State of North Carolina,\r\nintended to resist the laws or to deprive the citizens of the United\r\nStates of the protection of law or the enjoyment of their rights under\r\nthe Constitution of the United States. These reports are in addition to\r\nthe abstracts of those sent to the Senate on the 13th instant.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 24, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to your resolution of the 21st December, 1870, requesting the\r\nPresident \"to furnish the Senate with the amount of money expended by\r\nthe United States for freight and passage to the Pacific Coast by the\r\nway of the Isthmus and Cape Horn during the twelve months now last\r\npast,\" I herewith transmit reports from the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nof War, and of the Navy, to whom, respectively, the resolution was\r\nreferred.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 27, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration of Congress, a report of the\r\nSecretary of State and the papers which accompanied it, concerning\r\nregulations for the consular courts of the United States in Japan.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 27, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit, for consideration with a view to its ratification, a treaty\r\nof friendship, commerce, and navigation between the United States and\r\nthe Oriental Republic of Uruguay, which was signed at Montevideo, it is\r\npresumed, in the course of last month, though the precise date has\r\ninadvertently been omitted.\r\n\r\nA copy of the correspondence relating to the instrument is also herewith\r\ntransmitted. From this it will be seen that the treaty is substantially\r\nthe same as one between the same parties which has already been approved\r\nby the Senate and ratified by the President of the United States, but\r\nthe ratifications of which have never been exchanged. If the Senate\r\nshould approve the new treaty, it is suggested that their resolution to\r\nthat effect should include authority to insert the precise date when\r\nthat shall have been ascertained.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 30, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith an official copy of the proceedings of the council\r\nof Indian tribes held at Ocmulgee in December last, which resulted in\r\nthe adoption of a declaration of rights and a constitution for their\r\ngovernment, together with a copy of the report of the Commissioner of\r\nIndian Affairs and the views of the Secretary of the Interior thereon.\r\n\r\nIt would seem highly desirable that the civilized Indians of the country\r\nshould be encouraged in establishing for themselves forms of Territorial\r\ngovernment compatible with the Constitution of the United States and\r\nwith the previous customs toward communities lying outside of State\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nI concur in the views expressed by the Secretary of the Interior,\r\nthat it would not be advisable to receive the new Territory with the\r\nconstitution precisely as it is now framed. As long as a Territorial\r\nform of government is preserved, Congress should hold the power of\r\napproving or disapproving of all legislative action of the Territory,\r\nand the Executive should, with \"the advice and consent of the Senate,\"\r\nhave the power to appoint the governor and judicial officers (and\r\npossibly some others) of the Territory.\r\n\r\nThis is the first indication of the aborigines desiring to adopt\r\nour form of government, and it is highly desirable that they become\r\nself-sustaining, self-relying, Christianized, and civilized. If\r\nsuccessful in this their first attempt at Territorial government, we may\r\nhope for a gradual concentration of other Indians in the new Territory.\r\nI therefore recommend as close an adherence to their wishes as is\r\nconsistent with safety.\r\n\r\nIt might be well to limit the appointment of all Territorial officials\r\nappointed by the Executive to native citizens of the Territory. If any\r\nexception is made to this rule, I would recommend that it should be\r\nlimited to the judiciary.\r\n\r\nIt is confidently hoped that the policy now being pursued toward the\r\nIndian will fit him for self-government and make him desire to settle\r\namong people of his own race where he can enjoy the full privileges of\r\ncivil and enlightened government.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 7, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nThe union of the States of Germany into a form of government similar in\r\nmany respects to that of the American Union is an event that can not\r\nfail to touch deeply the sympathies of the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis union has been brought about by the long-continued, persistent\r\nefforts of the people, with the deliberate approval of the governments\r\nand people of twenty-four of the German States, through their regularly\r\nconstituted representatives.\r\n\r\nIn it the American people see an attempt to reproduce in Europe some\r\nof the best features of our own Constitution, with such modifications\r\nas the history and condition of Germany seem to require. The local\r\ngovernments of the several members of the union are preserved, while\r\nthe power conferred upon the chief imparts strength for the purposes\r\nof self-defense, without authority to enter upon wars of conquest and\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nThe cherished aspiration for national unity which for ages has\r\ninspired the many millions of people speaking the same language,\r\ninhabiting a contiguous and compact territory, but unnaturally separated\r\nand divided by dynastic jealousies and the ambition of short-sighted\r\nrulers, has been attained, and Germany now contains a population of\r\nabout 34,000,000, united, like our own, under one Government for its\r\nrelations with other powers, but retaining in its several members the\r\nright and power of control of their local interests, habits, and\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe bringing of great masses of thoughtful and free people under a\r\nsingle government must tend to make governments what alone they should\r\nbe--the representatives of the will and the organization of the power\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nThe adoption in Europe of the American system of union under the control\r\nand direction of a free people, educated to self-restraint, can not fail\r\nto extend popular institutions and to enlarge the peaceful influence of\r\nAmerican ideas.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the United States with Germany are intimate and\r\ncordial. The commercial intercourse between the two countries is\r\nextensive and is increasing from year to year; and the large number of\r\ncitizens and residents in the United States of German extraction and the\r\ncontinued flow of emigration thence to this country have produced an\r\nintimacy of personal and political intercourse approaching, if not equal\r\nto, that with the country from which the founders of our Government\r\nderived their origin.\r\n\r\nThe extent of these interests and the greatness of the German Union\r\nseem to require that in the classification of the representatives of\r\nthis Government to foreign powers there should no longer be an apparent\r\nundervaluation of the importance of the German mission, such as is\r\nmade in the difference between the compensation allowed by law to\r\nthe minister to Germany and those to Great Britain and France. There\r\nwould seem to be a great propriety in placing the representative\r\nof this Government at Berlin on the same footing with that of its\r\nrepresentatives at London and Paris. The union of the several States of\r\nGermany under one Government and the increasing commercial and personal\r\nintercourse between the two countries will also add to the labors and\r\nthe responsibilities of the legation.\r\n\r\nI therefore recommend that the salaries of the minister and of the\r\nsecretary of legation at Berlin be respectively increased to the same\r\namounts as are allowed to those at London and Paris.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 7, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to that part of your resolution of the 4th of January last\r\nrequesting copies of \"instructions to the commander of our naval\r\nsquadron in the waters of the island [of San Domingo] since the\r\ncommencement of the late negotiations, with the reports and\r\ncorrespondence of such commander,\" I herewith transmit a report, with\r\naccompanying papers, received from the Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 8, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith an extract of a paper addressed to the President,\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior, and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs by\r\nthe committee of Friends on Indian affairs having charge of the northern\r\nsuperintendency, in relation to a desire of certain Indian tribes to\r\nsell a portion of the lands owned by them, with a view of locating on\r\nother lands that they may be able to purchase, together with the report\r\nof the Commissioner of Indian Affairs thereon and a letter of the\r\nSecretary of the Interior Department approving the report of the\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\nI submit the draft of a bill which has been prepared, and which it is\r\nbelieved will effect the object desired by the committee, and request\r\nthe consideration thereof by Congress.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 9, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate:_\r\n\r\nThe British minister accredited to this Government recently, in\r\ncompliance with instructions from his Government, submitted a proposal\r\nfor the appointment of a \"joint high commission,\" to be composed of\r\nmembers to be named by each Government, to hold its session at\r\nWashington, and to treat and discuss the mode of settling the different\r\nquestions which have arisen out of the fisheries, as well as those which\r\naffect the relations of the United States toward the British possessions\r\nin North America.\r\n\r\nI did not deem it expedient to agree to the proposal unless the\r\nconsideration of the questions growing out of the acts committed by\r\nthe vessels which have given rise to the claims known as the \"Alabama\r\nclaims\" were to be within the subject of discussion and settlement by\r\nthe commission. The British Government having assented to this, the\r\ncommission is expected shortly to meet. I therefore nominate as such\r\ncommissioners, jointly and separately, on the part of the United States:\r\n\r\nHamilton Fish, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nRobert C. Schenck, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nSamuel Nelson, an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nEbenezer R. Hoar, of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nGeorge H. Williams, of Oregon.\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith the correspondence which has passed on this\r\nsubject between the Secretary of State and the British minister.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 10, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI submit herewith, for the information of Congress, the second annual\r\nreport of the Board of Indian Commissioners to the Secretary of the\r\nInterior.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 13, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in answer to the resolution of the House of the 6th\r\ninstant, copies of the correspondence between the governor of the State\r\nof California and the President of the United States in the month of\r\nOctober, 1868, relative to the use of the military forces of the\r\nNational Government in preserving the peace at the approaching State\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 15, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI have this day transmitted to the Senate the announcement that Senate\r\nbill No. 218, \"An act prescribing an oath of office to be taken by\r\npersons who participated in the late rebellion, but who are not\r\ndisqualified from holding office by the fourteenth amendment to the\r\nConstitution of the United States,\" has become a law in the manner\r\nprescribed by the Constitution, without the signature of the President.\r\n\r\nIf this were a bill for the repeal of the \"test oath\" required of\r\npersons \"elected or appointed to offices of honor or trust,\" it would\r\nmeet my approval. The effect of the law, however, is to relieve from\r\ntaking a prescribed oath all those persons whom it was intended to\r\nexclude from such offices and to require it from all others.

It prevents the contractor from receiving any allowance\r\nfor an advance in the price of labor and material when he could have\r\navoided that advance by the exercise of ordinary prudence and diligence.\r\nThe effect of the repeal will be to relieve contractors from the\r\nconsequences of their own imprudence and negligence. I see no good\r\nreason for thus relieving contractors who have not exercised ordinary\r\nprudence and diligence in their business transactions.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 28, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI herewith return without my approval House bill No. 2566, entitled\r\n\"An act for the relief of Henry Willman, late a private in the Third\r\nRegiment of Indiana Cavalry,\" for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nThe records of the War Department show that Henry Willman was mustered\r\ninto the military service April 4, 1862, and that he was mounted on a\r\nprivate horse. It appears from evidence presented by himself that his\r\nhorse died May 18, 1862; that he remounted himself on June 8, 1862, and\r\nso continued mounted till October 1, 1862, when his horse was killed by\r\nthe enemy, and that he was not afterwards mounted upon a private horse.\r\n\r\nUpon presenting a claim against the United States for the legal value\r\nof the two horses lost by him in the public service, the claim, after\r\ninvestigation, was allowed; but it being discovered that he had\r\nerroneously been paid for the use and risk of a private horse from May\r\n18 to June 8, 1862, and from October 1, 1862, to April 30, 1864, during\r\nwhich periods he had no horse in the public service, the amount so\r\noverpaid was offset against his claim, leaving the latter fully\r\nliquidated and the claimant indebted to the United States in an amount\r\nnot yet refunded.\r\n\r\nThe person named in the act is not, in law or equity, entitled to the\r\nrelief therein provided, and has no unsatisfied demands against the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas satisfactory evidence was given to me on the 17th day of this\r\nmonth by the Government of Portugal that the discriminating duties\r\nheretofore levied in the ports of Portugal on merchandise imported in\r\nvessels of the United States into said ports from other countries than\r\nthose of which said merchandise was the growth, production, or\r\nmanufacture have been abolished:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Ulysses S.

The proof that such a condition\r\nof affairs exists in some localities is now before the Senate. That\r\nthe power to correct these evils is beyond the control of the State\r\nauthorities I do not doubt; that the power of the Executive of the\r\nUnited States, acting within the limits of existing laws, is sufficient\r\nfor present emergencies is not clear.\r\n\r\nTherefore I urgently recommend such legislation as in the judgment of\r\nCongress shall effectually secure life, liberty, and property and the\r\nenforcement of law in all parts of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt may be expedient to provide that such law as shall be passed in\r\npursuance of this recommendation shall expire at the end of the next\r\nsession of Congress.\r\n\r\nThere is no other subject upon which I would recommend legislation\r\nduring the present session.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 28, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 16th instant, I\r\ntransmit a report from the Secretary of State and the papers[44] which\r\naccompanied it.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: Reports, communications, etc., relative to the\r\nInternational Statistical Congress held at The Hague in 1869.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 30, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit, for consideration with a view to its ratification, a treaty\r\nof commerce and navigation between the United States and the Kingdom of\r\nItaly, signed at Florence on the 26th of last month.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 31, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to your resolution of the 17th instant, requesting, \"if not\r\nincompatible with the public service, the report recently made by a\r\nboard of officers of the Engineer Department on the condition of the\r\nMississippi River near Vicksburg, Miss., with such remarks, suggestions,\r\nor recommendations as may be made by the Chief Engineer of the Army,\"\r\nI herewith transmit a report, dated 28th instant, with accompanying\r\npapers, received from the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 5, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI have the honor to submit herewith to the two Houses of Congress the\r\nreport of the commissioners appointed in pursuance of joint resolution\r\napproved January 12, 1871.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this report more than sustains all that I have\r\nheretofore said in regard to the productiveness and healthfulness of the\r\nRepublic of San Domingo, of the unanimity of the people for annexation\r\nto the United States, and of their peaceable character.\r\n\r\nIt is due to the public, as it certainly is to myself, that I should\r\nhere give all the circumstances which first led to the negotiation of a\r\ntreaty for the annexation of the Republic of San Domingo to the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nWhen I accepted the arduous and responsible position which I now hold,\r\nI did not dream of instituting any steps for the acquisition of insular\r\npossessions. I believed, however, that our institutions were broad\r\nenough to extend over the entire continent as rapidly as other peoples\r\nmight desire to bring themselves under our protection. I believed\r\nfurther that we should not permit any independent government within the\r\nlimits of North America to pass from a condition of independence to one\r\nof ownership or protection under a European power.\r\n\r\nSoon after my inauguration as President I was waited upon by an agent of\r\nPresident Baez with a proposition to annex the Republic of San Domingo\r\nto the United States. This gentleman represented the capacity of\r\nthe island, the desire of the people, and their character and habits\r\nabout as they have been described by the commissioners whose report\r\naccompanies this message. He stated further that, being weak in numbers\r\nand poor in purse, they were not capable of developing their great\r\nresources; that the people had no incentive to industry on account of\r\nlack of protection for their accumulations, and that if not accepted by\r\nthe United States--with institutions which they loved above those of any\r\nother nation--they would be compelled to seek protection elsewhere.\r\nTo these statements I made no reply and gave no indication of what I\r\nthought of the proposition. In the course of time I was waited upon by\r\na second gentleman from San Domingo, who made the same representations,\r\nand who was received in like manner.\r\n\r\nIn view of the facts which had been laid before me, and with an earnest\r\ndesire to maintain the \"Monroe doctrine,\" I believed that I would be\r\nderelict in my duty if I did not take measures to ascertain the exact\r\nwish of the Government and inhabitants of the Republic of San Domingo in\r\nregard to annexation and communicate the information to the people of\r\nthe United States. Under the attending circumstances I felt that if I\r\nturned a deaf ear to this appeal I might in the future be justly charged\r\nwith a flagrant neglect of the public interests and an utter disregard\r\nof the welfare of a downtrodden race praying for the blessings of a free\r\nand strong government and for protection in the enjoyment of the fruits\r\nof their own industry.\r\n\r\nThose opponents of annexation who have heretofore professed to be\r\npreeminently the friends of the rights of man I believed would be my\r\nmost violent assailants if I neglected so clear a duty. Accordingly,\r\nafter having appointed a commissioner to visit the island, who declined\r\non account of sickness, I selected a second gentleman, in whose\r\ncapacity, judgment, and integrity I had, and have yet, the most\r\nunbounded confidence.\r\n\r\nHe visited San Domingo, not to secure or hasten annexation, but,\r\nunprejudiced and unbiased, to learn all the facts about the Government,\r\nthe people, and the resources of that Republic. He went certainly as\r\nwell prepared to make an unfavorable report as a favorable one, if the\r\nfacts warranted it. His report fully corroborated the views of previous\r\ncommissioners, and upon its receipt I felt that a sense of duty and a\r\ndue regard for our great national interests required me to negotiate a\r\ntreaty for the acquisition of the Republic of San Domingo.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it became publicly known that such a treaty had been\r\nnegotiated, the attention of the country was occupied with allegations\r\ncalculated to prejudice the merits of the case and with aspersions upon\r\nthose whose duty had connected them with it. Amid the public excitement\r\nthus created the treaty failed to receive the requisite two-thirds vote\r\nof the Senate, and was rejected; but whether the action of that body was\r\nbased wholly upon the merits of the treaty, or might not have been in\r\nsome degree influenced by such unfounded allegations, could not be known\r\nby the people, because the debates of the Senate in secret session are\r\nnot published.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I deemed it due to the office which I hold\r\nand due to the character of the agents who had been charged with the\r\ninvestigation that such proceedings should be had as would enable the\r\npeople to know the truth. A commission was therefore constituted, under\r\nauthority of Congress, consisting of gentlemen selected with special\r\nreference to their high character and capacity for the laborious work\r\nintrusted to them, who were instructed to visit the spot and report\r\nupon the facts. Other eminent citizens were requested to accompany the\r\ncommission, in order that the people might have the benefit of their\r\nviews. Students of science and correspondents of the press, without\r\nregard to political opinions, were invited to join the expedition,\r\nand their numbers were limited only by the capacity of the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe mere rejection by the Senate of a treaty negotiated by the\r\nPresident only indicates a difference of opinion between two coordinate\r\ndepartments of the Government, without touching the character or\r\nwounding the pride of either. But when such rejection takes place\r\nsimultaneously with charges openly made of corruption on the part of the\r\nPresident or those employed by him the case is different. Indeed, in\r\nsuch case the honor of the nation demands investigation. This has been\r\naccomplished by the report of the commissioners herewith transmitted,\r\nand which fully vindicates the purity of the motives and action of those\r\nwho represented the United States in the negotiation.\r\n\r\nAnd now my task is finished, and with it ends all personal solicitude\r\nupon the subject. My duty being done, yours begins; and I gladly hand\r\nover the whole matter to the judgment of the American people and of\r\ntheir representatives in Congress assembled. The facts will now be\r\nspread before the country, and a decision rendered by that tribunal\r\nwhose convictions so seldom err, and against whose will I have no policy\r\nto enforce. My opinion remains unchanged; indeed, it is confirmed by the\r\nreport that the interests of our country and of San Domingo alike invite\r\nthe annexation of that Republic.\r\n\r\nIn view of the difference of opinion upon this subject, I suggest that\r\nno action be taken at the present session beyond the printing and\r\ngeneral dissemination of the report. Before the next session of Congress\r\nthe people will have considered the subject and formed an intelligent\r\nopinion concerning it, to which opinion, deliberately made up, it will\r\nbe the duty of every department of the Government to give heed; and no\r\none will more cheerfully conform to it than myself. It is not only the\r\ntheory of our Constitution that the will of the people, constitutionally\r\nexpressed, is the supreme law, but I have ever believed that \"all men\r\nare wiser than any one man;\" and if the people, upon a full presentation\r\nof the facts, shall decide that the annexation of the Republic is not\r\ndesirable, every department of the Government ought to acquiesce in that\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nIn again submitting to Congress a subject upon which public sentiment\r\nhas been divided, and which has been made the occasion of acrimonious\r\ndebates in Congress, as well as of unjust aspersions elsewhere, I may,\r\nI trust, be indulged in a single remark.\r\n\r\nNo man could hope to perform duties so delicate and responsible as\r\npertain to the Presidential office without sometimes incurring the\r\nhostility of those who deem their opinions and wishes treated with\r\ninsufficient consideration; and he who undertakes to conduct the affairs\r\nof a great government as a faithful public servant, if sustained by the\r\napproval of his own conscience, may rely with confidence upon the candor\r\nand intelligence of a free people whose best interests he has striven to\r\nsubserve, and can bear with patience the censure of disappointed men.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 5, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit confidentially, for the information and consideration of the\r\nSenate, a copy of a dispatch of the 25th of February last relative to\r\nthe annexation of the Hawaiian Islands, addressed to the Department of\r\nState by Henry A. Pierce, minister resident of the United States at\r\nHonolulu.

But inasmuch as the necessity therefor is well known to have\r\nbeen caused chiefly by persistent violations of the rights of citizens\r\nof the United States by combinations of lawless and disaffected persons\r\nin certain localities lately the theater of insurrection and military\r\nconflict, I do particularly exhort the people of those parts of the\r\ncountry to suppress all such combinations by their own voluntary efforts\r\nthrough the agency of local laws and to maintain the rights of all\r\ncitizens of the United States and to secure to all such citizens the\r\nequal protection of the laws.\r\n\r\nFully sensible of the responsibility imposed upon the Executive by the\r\nact of Congress to which public attention is now called, and reluctant\r\nto call into exercise any of the extraordinary powers thereby conferred\r\nupon me except in cases of imperative necessity, I do, nevertheless,\r\ndeem it my duty to make known that I will not hesitate to exhaust the\r\npowers thus vested in the Executive whenever and wherever it shall\r\nbecome necessary to do so for the purpose of securing to all citizens\r\nof the United States the peaceful enjoyment of the rights guaranteed\r\nto them by the Constitution and laws.\r\n\r\nIt is my earnest wish that peace and cheerful obedience to law may\r\nprevail throughout the land and that all traces of our late unhappy\r\ncivil strife may be speedily removed. These ends can be easily reached\r\nby acquiescence in the results of the conflict, now written in our\r\nConstitution, and by the due and proper enforcement of equal, just, and\r\nimpartial laws in every part of our country.\r\n\r\nThe failure of local communities to furnish such means for the\r\nattainment of results so earnestly desired imposes upon the National\r\nGovernment the duty of putting forth all its energies for the protection\r\nof its citizens of every race and color and for the restoration of peace\r\nand order throughout the entire country.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 3d day of May, A.D. 1871, and of\r\nthe Independence of the United States the ninety-fifth.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  HAMILTON FISH,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas unlawful combinations and conspiracies have long existed and do\r\nstill exist in the State of South Carolina for the purpose of depriving\r\ncertain portions and classes of the people of that State of the rights,\r\nprivileges, immunities, and protection named in the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States and secured by the act of Congress approved April 20,\r\n1871, entitled \"An act to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth\r\namendment to the Constitution of the United States;\" and\r\n\r\nWhereas in certain parts of said State, to wit, in the counties of\r\nSpartanburg, York, Marion, Chester, Laurens, Newberry, Fairfield,\r\nLancaster, and Chesterfield, such combinations and conspiracies do\r\nso obstruct and hinder the execution of the laws of said State and of\r\nthe United States as to deprive the people aforesaid of the rights,\r\nprivileges, immunities, and protection aforesaid and do oppose and\r\nobstruct the laws of the United States and their due execution and\r\nimpede and obstruct the due course of justice under the same; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the constituted authorities of said State are unable to protect\r\nthe people aforesaid in such rights within the said counties; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the combinations and conspiracies aforesaid, within the counties\r\naforesaid, are organized and armed and are so numerous and powerful as\r\nto be able to defy the constituted authorities of said State and of the\r\nUnited States within the said State, and by reason of said causes the\r\nconviction of such offenders and the preservation of the public peace\r\nand safety have become impracticable in said counties:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Ulysses S.

They have been appointed for service in the Territory and for\r\nthe benefit and convenience of the Territorial population. He expects\r\nthem by their personal presence to identify themselves with the people\r\nand acquire local information, without which their duties can not be\r\nwell performed. Frequent or long absence makes them in some degree\r\nstrangers, and therefore less acceptable to the people. Their absence,\r\nno matter with what substitution, must often put the people to\r\ninconvenience. Executive officers may be required for emergencies which\r\ncould not be foreseen. Judges should be at hand, not only when the\r\ncourts are in session, but for matters of bail, _habeas corpus_, orders\r\nin equity, examination of persons charged with crime, and other similar\r\nbusiness, which often arises in vacation.\r\n\r\nThese and similar considerations no doubt induced Congress to pass the\r\nlaw above quoted.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore directed that in future the heads of Departments shall\r\ngrant leaves of absence to Territorial officers only for reasons of the\r\nmost urgent character, and then only for the shortest possible time.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:\r\n\r\nHAMILTON FISH, _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 4, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn addressing my third annual message to the law-making branch of the\r\nGovernment it is gratifying to be able to state that during the past\r\nyear success has generally attended the effort to execute all laws found\r\nupon the statute books. The policy has been not to inquire into the\r\nwisdom of laws already enacted, but to learn their spirit and intent and\r\nto enforce them accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe past year has, under a wise Providence, been one of general\r\nprosperity to the nation. It has, however, been attended with more than\r\nusual chastisements in the loss of life and property by storm and fire.\r\nThese disasters have served to call forth the best elements of human\r\nnature in our country and to develop a friendship for us on the part\r\nof foreign nations which goes far toward alleviating the distresses\r\noccasioned by these calamities. The benevolent, who have so generously\r\nshared their means with the victims of these misfortunes, will reap\r\ntheir reward in the consciousness of having performed a noble act and\r\nin receiving the grateful thanks of men, women, and children whose\r\nsufferings they have relieved.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the United States with foreign powers continue to be\r\nfriendly. The year has been an eventful one in witnessing two great\r\nnations, speaking one language and having one lineage, settling by\r\npeaceful arbitration disputes of long standing and liable at any time to\r\nbring those nations into bloody and costly conflict. An example has thus\r\nbeen set which, if successful in its final issue, may be followed by\r\nother civilized nations, and finally be the means of returning to\r\nproductive industry millions of men now maintained to settle the\r\ndisputes of nations by the bayonet and the broadside.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a copy of the treaty alluded to, which has been\r\nconcluded since the adjournment of Congress with Her Britannic Majesty,\r\nand a copy of the protocols of the conferences of the commissioners by\r\nwhom it was negotiated. This treaty provides methods for adjusting the\r\nquestions pending between the two nations.\r\n\r\nVarious questions are to be adjusted by arbitration. I recommend\r\nCongress at an early day to make the necessary provision for the\r\ntribunal at Geneva and for the several commissioners on the part of the\r\nUnited States called for by the treaty.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty the King of Italy, the President of the Swiss Confederation,\r\nand His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil have each consented, on the joint\r\nrequest of the two powers, to name an arbiter for the tribunal at\r\nGeneva. I have caused my thanks to be suitably expressed for the\r\nreadiness with which the joint request has been complied with, by the\r\nappointment of gentlemen of eminence and learning to these important\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty the Emperor of Germany has been pleased to comply with the\r\njoint request of the two Governments, and has consented to act as the\r\narbitrator of the disputed water boundary between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nThe contracting parties in the treaty have undertaken to regard as\r\nbetween themselves certain principles of public law, for which the\r\nUnited States have contended from the commencement of their history.\r\nThey have also agreed to bring those principles to the knowledge of the\r\nother maritime powers and to invite them to accede to them. Negotiations\r\nare going on as to the form of the note by which the invitation is to be\r\nextended to the other powers.\r\n\r\nI recommend the legislation necessary on the part of the United States\r\nto bring into operation the articles of the treaty relating to the\r\nfisheries and to the other matters touching the relations of the United\r\nStates toward the British North American possessions, to become\r\noperative so soon as the proper legislation shall be had on the part of\r\nGreat Britain and its possessions. It is much to be desired that this\r\nlegislation may become operative before the fishermen of the United\r\nStates begin to make their arrangements for the coming season.\r\n\r\nI have addressed a communication, of which a copy is transmitted\r\nherewith, to the governors of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana,\r\nMichigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin, urging upon the governments of those\r\nStates, respectively, the necessary action on their part to carry into\r\neffect the object of the article of the treaty which contemplates the\r\nuse of the canals, on either side, connected with the navigation of the\r\nlakes and rivers forming the boundary, on terms of equality, by the\r\ninhabitants of both countries. It is hoped that the importance of the\r\nobject and the benefits to flow therefrom will secure the speedy\r\napproval and legislative sanction of the States concerned.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation for an appropriation for determining the true\r\nposition of the forty-ninth parallel of latitude where it forms the\r\nboundary between the United States and the British North American\r\npossessions, between the Lake of the Woods and the summit of the Rocky\r\nMountains. The early action of Congress on this recommendation would put\r\nit in the power of the War Department to place a force in the field\r\nduring the next summer.\r\n\r\nThe resumption of diplomatic relations between France and Germany has\r\nenabled me to give directions for the withdrawal of the protection\r\nextended to Germans in France by the diplomatic and consular\r\nrepresentatives of the United States in that country. It is just to add\r\nthat the delicate duty of this protection has been performed by the\r\nminister and the consul-general at Paris, and the various consuls in\r\nFrance under the supervision of the latter, with great kindness as well\r\nas with prudence and tact. Their course has received the commendation of\r\nthe German Government, and has wounded no susceptibility of the French.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the Emperor of Germany continues to manifest a\r\nfriendly feeling toward the United States, and a desire to harmonize\r\nwith the moderate and just policy which this Government maintains in\r\nits relations with Asiatic powers, as well as with the South American\r\nRepublics. I have given assurances that the friendly feelings of that\r\nGovernment are fully shared by the United States.\r\n\r\nThe ratifications of the consular and naturalization conventions with\r\nthe Austro-Hungarian Empire have been exchanged.\r\n\r\nI have been officially informed of the annexation of the States of the\r\nChurch to the Kingdom of Italy, and the removal of the capital of that\r\nKingdom to Rome. In conformity with the established policy of the\r\nUnited States, I have recognized this change. The ratifications of the\r\nnew treaty of commerce between the United States and Italy have been\r\nexchanged. The two powers have agreed in this treaty that private\r\nproperty at sea shall be exempt from capture in case of war between\r\nthe two powers. The United States have spared no opportunity of\r\nincorporating this rule into the obligation of nations.\r\n\r\nThe Forty-first Congress, at its third session, made an appropriation\r\nfor the organization of a mixed commission for adjudicating upon the\r\nclaims of citizens of the United States against Spain growing out of\r\nthe insurrection in Cuba. That commission has since been organized. I\r\ntransmit herewith the correspondence relating to its formation and its\r\njurisdiction. It is to be hoped that this commission will afford the\r\nclaimants a complete remedy for their injuries.\r\n\r\nIt has been made the agreeable duty of the United States to preside over\r\na conference at Washington between the plenipotentiaries of Spain and\r\nthe allied South American Republics, which has resulted in an armistice,\r\nwith the reasonable assurance of a permanent peace.\r\n\r\nThe intimate friendly relations which have so long existed between the\r\nUnited States and Russia continue undisturbed. The visit of the third\r\nson of the Emperor is a proof that there is no desire on the part of his\r\nGovernment to diminish the cordiality of those relations. The hospitable\r\nreception which has been given to the Grand Duke is a proof that on our\r\nside we share the wishes of that Government. The inexcusable course of\r\nthe Russian minister at Washington rendered it necessary to ask his\r\nrecall and to decline to longer receive that functionary as a diplomatic\r\nrepresentative. It was impossible, with self-respect or with a just\r\nregard to the dignity of the country, to permit Mr. Catacazy to continue\r\nto hold intercourse with this Government after his personal abuse of\r\nGovernment officials, and during his persistent interferences, through\r\nvarious means, with the relations between the United States and other\r\npowers. In accordance with my wishes, this Government has been relieved\r\nof further intercourse with Mr. Catacazy, and the management of the\r\naffairs of the imperial legation has passed into the hands of a\r\ngentleman entirely unobjectionable.\r\n\r\nWith Japan we continue to maintain intimate relations. The cabinet of\r\nthe Mikado has since the close of the last session of Congress selected\r\ncitizens of the United States to serve in offices of importance in\r\nseveral departments of Government. I have reason to think that this\r\nselection is due to an appreciation of the disinterestedness of the\r\npolicy which the United States have pursued toward Japan. It is our\r\ndesire to continue to maintain this disinterested and just policy with\r\nChina as well as Japan. The correspondence transmitted herewith shows\r\nthat there is no disposition on the part of this Government to swerve\r\nfrom its established course.\r\n\r\nPrompted by a desire to put an end to the barbarous treatment of our\r\nshipwrecked sailors on the Korean coast, I instructed our minister at\r\nPeking to endeavor to conclude a convention with Korea for securing the\r\nsafety and humane treatment of such mariners.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Rodgers was instructed to accompany him with a sufficient force\r\nto protect him in case of need.\r\n\r\nA small surveying party sent out, on reaching the coast was\r\ntreacherously attacked at a disadvantage. Ample opportunity was given\r\nfor explanation and apology for the insult. Neither came. A force was\r\nthen landed. After an arduous march over a rugged and difficult country,\r\nthe forts from which the outrages had been committed were reduced by a\r\ngallant assault and were destroyed. Having thus punished the criminals,\r\nand having vindicated the honor of the flag, the expedition returned,\r\nfinding it impracticable under the circumstances to conclude the desired\r\nconvention. I respectfully refer to the correspondence relating thereto,\r\nherewith submitted, and leave the subject for such action as Congress\r\nmay see fit to take.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of Mexico has not yet repealed the very objectionable laws\r\nestablishing what is known as the \"free zone\" on the frontier of the\r\nUnited States. It is hoped that this may yet be done, and also that more\r\nstringent measures may be taken by that Republic for restraining lawless\r\npersons on its frontiers. I hope that Mexico by its own action will soon\r\nrelieve this Government of the difficulties experienced from these\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the various Republics of Central and South America\r\ncontinue, with one exception, to be cordial and friendly.\r\n\r\nI recommend some action by Congress regarding the overdue installments\r\nunder the award of the Venezuelan Claims Commission of 1866. The\r\ninternal dissensions of this Government present no justification for the\r\nabsence of effort to meet their solemn treaty obligations.\r\n\r\nThe ratification of an extradition treaty with Nicaragua has been\r\nexchanged.\r\n\r\nIt is a subject for congratulation that the great Empire of Brazil has\r\ntaken the initiatory step toward the abolition of slavery. Our relations\r\nwith that Empire, always cordial, will naturally be made more so by this\r\nact. It is not too much to hope that the Government of Brazil may\r\nhereafter find it for its interest, as well as intrinsically right, to\r\nadvance toward entire emancipation more rapidly than the present act\r\ncontemplates.\r\n\r\nThe true prosperity and greatness of a nation is to be found in the\r\nelevation and education of its laborers.\r\n\r\nIt is a subject for regret that the reforms in this direction which were\r\nvoluntarily promised by the statesmen of Spain have not been carried out\r\nin its West India colonies. The laws and regulations for the apparent\r\nabolition of slavery in Cuba and Porto Rico leave most of the laborers\r\nin bondage, with no hope of release until their lives become a burden to\r\ntheir employers.\r\n\r\nI desire to direct your attention to the fact that citizens of the\r\nUnited States, or persons claiming to be citizens of the United States,\r\nare large holders in foreign lands of this species of property,\r\nforbidden by the fundamental law of their alleged country. I recommend\r\nto Congress to provide by stringent legislation a suitable remedy\r\nagainst the holding, owning, or dealing in slaves, or being interested\r\nin slave property, in foreign lands, either as owners, hirers, or\r\nmortgagors, by citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the disturbed condition of the island of Cuba\r\ncontinues to be a source of annoyance and of anxiety. The existence\r\nof a protracted struggle in such close proximity to our own territory,\r\nwithout apparent prospect of an early termination, can not be other than\r\nan object of concern to a people who, while abstaining from interference\r\nin the affairs of other powers, naturally desire to see every country in\r\nthe undisturbed enjoyment of peace, liberty, and the blessings of free\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nOur naval commanders in Cuban waters have been instructed, in case it\r\nshould become necessary, to spare no effort to protect the lives and\r\nproperty of _bona fide_ American citizens and to maintain the dignity\r\nof the flag.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that all pending questions with Spain growing out of the\r\naffairs in Cuba may be adjusted in the spirit of peace and conciliation\r\nwhich has hitherto guided the two powers in their treatment of such\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nTo give importance to and to add to the efficiency of our diplomatic\r\nrelations with Japan and China, and to further aid in retaining the good\r\nopinion of those peoples, and to secure to the United States its share\r\nof the commerce destined to flow between those nations and the balance\r\nof the commercial world, I earnestly recommend that an appropriation\r\nbe made to support at least four American youths in each of those\r\ncountries, to serve as a part of the official family of our ministers\r\nthere. Our representatives would not even then be placed upon an\r\nequality with the representatives of Great Britain and of some other\r\npowers. As now situated, our representatives in Japan and China have to\r\ndepend for interpreters and translators upon natives of those countries\r\nwho know our language imperfectly, or procure for the occasion the\r\nservices of employees in foreign business houses or the interpreters to\r\nother foreign ministers.\r\n\r\nI would also recommend liberal measures for the purpose of supporting\r\nthe American lines of steamers now plying between San Francisco and\r\nJapan and China, and the Australian line--almost our only remaining\r\nlines of ocean steamers--and of increasing their services.\r\n\r\nThe national debt has been reduced to the extent of $86,057,126.80\r\nduring the year, and by the negotiation of national bonds at a lower\r\nrate of interest the interest on the public debt has been so far\r\ndiminished that now the sum to be raised for the interest account is\r\nnearly $17,000,000 less than on the 1st of March, 1869. It was highly\r\ndesirable that this rapid diminution should take place, both to\r\nstrengthen the credit of the country and to convince its citizens\r\nof their entire ability to meet every dollar of liability without\r\nbankrupting them. But in view of the accomplishment of these desirable\r\nends; of the rapid development of the resources of the country; its\r\nincreasing ability to meet large demands, and the amount already\r\npaid, it is not desirable that the present resources of the country\r\nshould continue to be taxed in order to continue this rapid payment.\r\nI therefore recommend a modification of both the tariff and\r\ninternal-tax law. I recommend that all taxes from internal sources\r\nbe abolished, except those collected from spirituous, vinous, and\r\nmalt liquors, tobacco in its various forms, and from stamps.\r\n\r\nIn readjusting the tariff I suggest that a careful estimate be made of\r\nthe amount of surplus revenue collected under the present laws, after\r\nproviding for the current expenses of the Government, the interest\r\naccount, and a sinking fund, and that this surplus be reduced in such a\r\nmanner as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest number. There\r\nare many articles not produced at home, but which enter largely into\r\ngeneral consumption through articles which are manufactured at home,\r\nsuch as medicines compounded, etc., etc., from which very little revenue\r\nis derived, but which enter into general use. All such articles I\r\nrecommend to be placed on the \"free list.\" Should a further reduction\r\nprove advisable, I would then recommend that it be made upon those\r\narticles which can best bear it without disturbing home production or\r\nreducing the wages of American labor.\r\n\r\nI have not entered into figures, because to do so would be to repeat\r\nwhat will be laid before you in the report of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury. The present laws for collecting revenue pay collectors\r\nof customs small salaries, but provide for moieties (shares in all\r\nseizures), which, at principal ports of entry particularly, raise the\r\ncompensation of those officials to a large sum. It has always seemed\r\nto me as if this system must at times work perniciously. It holds out\r\nan inducement to dishonest men, should such get possession of those\r\noffices, to be lax in their scrutiny of goods entered, to enable them\r\nfinally to make large seizures. Your attention is respectfully invited\r\nto this subject.\r\n\r\nContinued fluctuations in the value of gold, as compared with the\r\nnational currency, has a most damaging effect upon the increase and\r\ndevelopment of the country, in keeping up prices of all articles\r\nnecessary in everyday life. It fosters a spirit of gambling, prejudicial\r\nalike to national morals and the national finances. If the question\r\ncan be met as to how to get a fixed value to our currency, that value\r\nconstantly and uniformly approaching par with specie, a very desirable\r\nobject will be gained.\r\n\r\nFor the operations of the Army in the past year, the expense of\r\nmaintaining it, the estimate for the ensuing year, and for continuing\r\nseacoast and other improvements conducted under the supervision of the\r\nWar Department, I refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary\r\nof War.\r\n\r\nI call your attention to the provisions of the act of Congress approved\r\nMarch 3, 1869, which discontinues promotions in the staff corps of the\r\nArmy until provided for by law. I recommend that the number of officers\r\nin each grade in the staff corps be fixed, and that whenever the number\r\nin any one grade falls below the number so fixed, that the vacancy may\r\nbe filled by promotion from the grade below. I also recommend that when\r\nthe office of chief of a corps becomes vacant the place may be filled by\r\nselection from the corps in which the vacancy exists.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy shows an improvement in the\r\nnumber and efficiency of the naval force, without material increase in\r\nthe expense of supporting it. This is due to the policy which has been\r\nadopted, and is being extended as fast as our material will admit, of\r\nusing smaller vessels as cruisers on the several stations. By this means\r\nwe have been enabled to occupy at once a larger extent of cruising\r\ngrounds, to visit more frequently the ports where the presence of our\r\nflag is desirable, and generally to discharge more efficiently the\r\nappropriate duties of the Navy in time of peace, without exceeding the\r\nnumber of men or the expenditure authorized by law.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the Navy has, in addition to its regular service,\r\nsupplied the men and officers for the vessels of the Coast Survey, and\r\nhas completed the surveys authorized by Congress of the isthmuses of\r\nDarien and Tehuantepec, and, under like authority, has sent out an\r\nexpedition, completely furnished and equipped, to explore the unknown\r\nocean of the north.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions of the report as to the necessity for increasing and\r\nimproving the _matériel_ of the Navy, and the plan recommended for\r\nreducing the _personnel_ of the service to a peace standard, by the\r\ngradual abolition of certain grades of officers, the reduction of\r\nothers, and the employment of some in the service of the commercial\r\nmarine, are well considered and deserve the thoughtful attention of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nI also recommend that all promotions in the Navy above the rank of\r\ncaptain be by selection instead of by seniority. This course will secure\r\nin the higher grades greater efficiency and hold out an incentive to\r\nyoung officers to improve themselves in the knowledge of their\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nThe present cost of maintaining the Navy, its cost compared with that of\r\nthe preceding year, and the estimates for the ensuing year are contained\r\nin the accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nThe enlarged receipts of the Post-Office Department, as shown by the\r\naccompanying report of the Postmaster-General, exhibit a gratifying\r\nincrease in that branch of the public service. It is the index of the\r\ngrowth of education and of the prosperity of the people, two elements\r\nhighly conducive to the vigor and stability of republics. With a vast\r\nterritory like ours, much of it sparsely populated, but all requiring\r\nthe services of the mail, it is not at present to be expected that this\r\nDepartment can be made self-sustaining. But a gradual approach to this\r\nend from year to year is confidently relied on, and the day is not far\r\ndistant when the Post-Office Department of the Government will prove a\r\nmuch greater blessing to the whole people than it is now.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions of the Postmaster-General for improvements in the\r\nDepartment presided over by him are earnestly recommended to your\r\nspecial attention. Especially do I recommend favorable consideration of\r\nthe plan for uniting the telegraphic system of the United States with\r\nthe postal system. It is believed that by such a course the cost of\r\ntelegraphing could be much reduced, and the service as well, if not\r\nbetter, rendered. It would secure the further advantage of extending the\r\ntelegraph through portions of the country where private enterprise will\r\nnot construct it. Commerce, trade, and, above all, the efforts to bring\r\na people widely separated into a community of interest are always\r\nbenefited by a rapid intercommunication. Education, the groundwork of\r\nrepublican institutions, is encouraged by increasing the facilities to\r\ngather speedy news from all parts of the country. The desire to reap the\r\nbenefit of such improvements will stimulate education. I refer you to\r\nthe report of the Postmaster-General for full details of the operations\r\nof last year and for comparative statements of results with former\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThere has been imposed upon the executive branch of the Government the\r\nexecution of the act of Congress approved April 20, 1871, and commonly\r\nknown as the Kuklux law, in a portion of the State of South Carolina.\r\nThe necessity of the course pursued will be demonstrated by the report\r\nof the Committee to Investigate Southern Outrages. Under the provisions\r\nof the above act I issued a proclamation[48] calling the attention of\r\nthe people of the United States to the same, and declaring my reluctance\r\nto exercise any of the extraordinary powers thereby conferred upon me,\r\nexcept in case of imperative necessity, but making known my purpose to\r\nexercise such powers whenever it should become necessary to do so for\r\nthe purpose of securing to all citizens of the United States the\r\npeaceful enjoyment of the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution\r\nand the laws.\r\n\r\nAfter the passage of this law information was received from time to time\r\nthat combinations of the character referred to in this law existed and\r\nwere powerful in many parts of the Southern States, particularly in\r\ncertain counties in the State of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nCareful investigation was made, and it was ascertained that in nine\r\ncounties of that State such combinations were active and powerful,\r\nembracing a sufficient portion of the citizens to control the local\r\nauthority, and having, among other things, the object of depriving\r\nthe emancipated class of the substantial benefits of freedom and of\r\npreventing the free political action of those citizens who did not\r\nsympathize with their own views. Among their operations were frequent\r\nscourgings and occasional assassinations, generally perpetrated at night\r\nby disguised persons, the victims in almost all cases being citizens of\r\ndifferent political sentiments from their own or freed persons who had\r\nshown a disposition to claim equal rights with other citizens. Thousands\r\nof inoffensive and well-disposed citizens were the sufferers by this\r\nlawless violence.\r\n\r\nThereupon, on the 12th of October, 1871, a proclamation[49] was issued,\r\nin terms of the law, calling upon the members of those combinations to\r\ndisperse within five days and to deliver to the marshal or military\r\nofficers of the United States all arms, ammunition, uniforms, disguises,\r\nand other means and implements used by them for carrying out their\r\nunlawful purposes.\r\n\r\nThis warning not having been heeded, on the 17th of October another\r\nproclamation[50] was issued, suspending the privileges of the writ of\r\n_habeas corpus_ in nine counties in that State.\r\n\r\nDirection was given that within the counties so designated persons\r\nsupposed, upon creditable information, to be members of such unlawful\r\ncombinations should be arrested by the military forces of the United\r\nStates and delivered to the marshal, to be dealt with according to law.\r\nIn two of said counties, York and Spartanburg, many arrests have been\r\nmade. At the last account the number of persons thus arrested was 168.\r\nSeveral hundred, whose criminality was ascertained to be of an inferior\r\ndegree, were released for the present. These have generally made\r\nconfessions of their guilt.\r\n\r\nGreat caution has been exercised in making these arrests, and,\r\nnotwithstanding the large number, it is believed that no innocent person\r\nis now in custody. The prisoners will be held for regular trial in the\r\njudicial tribunals of the United States.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it appeared that the authorities of the United States were\r\nabout to take vigorous measures to enforce the law, many persons\r\nabsconded, and there is good ground for supposing that all of such\r\npersons have violated the law. A full report of what has been done under\r\nthis law will be submitted to Congress by the Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nIn Utah there still remains a remnant of barbarism, repugnant to\r\ncivilization, to decency, and to the laws of the United States.\r\nTerritorial officers, however, have been found who are willing to\r\nperform their duty in a spirit of equity and with a due sense of the\r\nnecessity of sustaining the majesty of the law. Neither polygamy nor\r\nany other violation of existing statutes will be permitted within the\r\nterritory of the United States. It is not with the religion of the\r\nself-styled Saints that we are now dealing, but with their practices.\r\nThey will be protected in the worship of God according to the dictates\r\nof their consciences, but they will not be permitted to violate the laws\r\nunder the cloak of religion.\r\n\r\nIt may be advisable for Congress to consider what, in the execution of\r\nthe laws against polygamy, is to be the status of plural wives and their\r\noffspring. The propriety of Congress passing an enabling act authorizing\r\nthe Territorial legislature of Utah to legitimize all children born\r\nprior to a time fixed in the act might be justified by its humanity to\r\nthese innocent children. This is a suggestion only, and not a\r\nrecommendation.\r\n\r\nThe policy pursued toward the Indians has resulted favorably, so far\r\nas can be judged from the limited time during which it has been in\r\noperation. Through the exertions of the various societies of Christians\r\nto whom has been intrusted the execution of the policy, and the board of\r\ncommissioners authorized by the law of April 10, 1869, many tribes of\r\nIndians have been induced to settle upon reservations, to cultivate the\r\nsoil, to perform productive labor of various kinds, and to partially\r\naccept civilization. They are being cared for in such a way, it is\r\nhoped, as to induce those still pursuing their old habits of life to\r\nembrace the only opportunity which is left them to avoid extermination.\r\n\r\nI recommend liberal appropriations to carry out the Indian peace policy,\r\nnot only because it is humane, Christianlike, and economical, but\r\nbecause it is right.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your favorable consideration also the policy of granting\r\na Territorial government to the Indians in the Indian Territory west\r\nof Arkansas and Missouri and south of Kansas. In doing so every right\r\nguaranteed to the Indian by treaty should be secured. Such a course\r\nmight in time be the means of collecting most of the Indians now between\r\nthe Missouri and the Pacific and south of the British possessions into\r\none Territory or one State. The Secretary of the Interior has treated\r\nupon this subject at length, and I commend to you his suggestions.\r\n\r\nI renew my recommendation that the public lands be regarded as a\r\nheritage to our children, to be disposed of only as required for\r\noccupation and to actual settlers. Those already granted have been in\r\ngreat part disposed of in such a way as to secure access to the balance\r\nby the hardy settler who may wish to avail himself of them, but caution\r\nshould be exercised even in attaining so desirable an object.\r\n\r\nEducational interest may well be served by the grant of the proceeds of\r\nthe sale of public lands to settlers. I do not wish to be understood as\r\nrecommending in the least degree a curtailment of what is being done by\r\nthe General Government for the encouragement of education.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior submitted with this will\r\ngive you all the information collected and prepared for publication in\r\nregard to the census taken during the year 1870; the operations of the\r\nBureau of Education for the year; the Patent Office; the Pension Office;\r\nthe Land Office, and the Indian Bureau.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Agriculture gives the operations of\r\nhis Department for the year. As agriculture is the groundwork of our\r\nprosperity, too much importance can not be attached to the labors of\r\nthis Department. It is in the hands of an able head, with able\r\nassistants, all zealously devoted to introducing into the agricultural\r\nproductions of the nation all useful products adapted to any of the\r\nvarious climates and soils of our vast territory, and to giving all\r\nuseful information as to the method of cultivation, the plants, cereals,\r\nand other products adapted to particular localities. Quietly but surely\r\nthe Agricultural Bureau is working a great national good, and if\r\nliberally supported the more widely its influence will be extended and\r\nthe less dependent we shall be upon the products of foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe subject of compensation to the heads of bureaus and officials\r\nholding positions of responsibility, and requiring ability and character\r\nto fill properly, is one to which your attention is invited. But few of\r\nthe officials receive a compensation equal to the respectable support\r\nof a family, while their duties are such as to involve millions of\r\ninterest. In private life services demand compensation equal to the\r\nservices rendered; a wise economy would dictate the same rule in the\r\nGovernment service.\r\n\r\nI have not given the estimates for the support of Government for the\r\nensuing year, nor the comparative statement between the expenditures\r\nfor the year just passed and the one just preceding, because all these\r\nfigures are contained in the accompanying reports or in those presented\r\ndirectly to Congress. These estimates have my approval.\r\n\r\nMore than six years having elapsed since the last hostile gun was\r\nfired between the armies then arrayed against each other--one for the\r\nperpetuation, the other for the destruction, of the Union--it may well\r\nbe considered whether it is not now time that the disabilities imposed\r\nby the fourteenth amendment should be removed. That amendment does not\r\nexclude the ballot, but only imposes the disability to hold offices upon\r\ncertain classes. When the purity of the ballot is secure, majorities are\r\nsure to elect officers reflecting the views of the majority. I do not\r\nsee the advantage or propriety of excluding men from office merely\r\nbecause they were before the rebellion of standing and character\r\nsufficient to be elected to positions requiring them to take oaths\r\nto support the Constitution, and admitting to eligibility those\r\nentertaining precisely the same views, but of less standing in their\r\ncommunities. It may be said that the former violated an oath, while the\r\nlatter did not; the latter did not have it in their power to do so.\r\nIf they had taken this oath, it can not be doubted they would have\r\nbroken it as did the former class. If there are any great criminals,\r\ndistinguished above all others for the part they took in opposition to\r\nthe Government, they might, in the judgment of Congress, be excluded\r\nfrom such an amnesty.\r\n\r\nThis subject is submitted for your careful consideration.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Southern States is, unhappily, not such as all\r\ntrue patriotic citizens would like to see. Social ostracism for\r\nopinion's sake, personal violence or threats toward persons entertaining\r\npolitical views opposed to those entertained by the majority of the old\r\ncitizens, prevents immigration and the flow of much-needed capital into\r\nthe States lately in rebellion. It will be a happy condition of the\r\ncountry when the old citizens of these States will take an interest in\r\npublic affairs, promulgate ideas honestly entertained, vote for men\r\nrepresenting their views, and tolerate the same freedom of expression\r\nand ballot in those entertaining different political convictions.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the act of Congress approved February 21, 1871,\r\na Territorial government was organized in the District of Columbia. Its\r\nresults have thus far fully realized the expectations of its advocates.\r\nUnder the direction of the Territorial officers, a system of\r\nimprovements has been inaugurated by means of which Washington is\r\nrapidly becoming a city worthy of the nation's capital. The citizens of\r\nthe District having voluntarily taxed themselves to a large amount for\r\nthe purpose of contributing to the adornment of the seat of Government,\r\nI recommend liberal appropriations on the part of Congress, in order\r\nthat the Government may bear its just share of the expense of carrying\r\nout a judicious system of improvements.\r\n\r\nBy the great fire in Chicago the most important of the Government\r\nbuildings in that city were consumed. Those burned had already become\r\ninadequate to the wants of the Government in that growing city, and,\r\nlooking to the near future, were totally inadequate. I recommend,\r\ntherefore, that an appropriation be made immediately to purchase the\r\nremainder of the square on which the burned buildings stood, provided it\r\ncan be purchased at a fair valuation, or provided that the legislature\r\nof Illinois will pass a law authorizing its condemnation for Government\r\npurposes; and also an appropriation of as much money as can properly be\r\nexpended toward the erection of new buildings during this fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe number of immigrants ignorant of our laws, habits, etc., coming into\r\nour country annually has become so great and the impositions practiced\r\nupon them so numerous and flagrant that I suggest Congressional action\r\nfor their protection. It seems to me a fair subject of legislation by\r\nCongress. I can not now state as fully as I desire the nature of the\r\ncomplaints made by immigrants of the treatment they receive, but will\r\nendeavor to do so during the session of Congress, particularly if the\r\nsubject should receive your attention.\r\n\r\nIt has been the aim of the Administration to enforce honesty and\r\nefficiency in all public offices. Every public servant who has\r\nviolated the trust placed in him has been proceeded against with all the\r\nrigor of the law. If bad men have secured places, it has been the fault\r\nof the system established by law and custom for making appointments,\r\nor the fault of those who recommend for Government positions persons\r\nnot sufficiently well known to them personally, or who give letters\r\nindorsing the characters of office seekers without a proper sense\r\nof the grave responsibility which such a course devolves upon them.\r\nA civil-service reform which can correct this abuse is much desired.\r\nIn mercantile pursuits the business man who gives a letter of\r\nrecommendation to a friend to enable him to obtain credit from a\r\nstranger is regarded as morally responsible for the integrity of his\r\nfriend and his ability to meet his obligations. A reformatory law which\r\nwould enforce this principle against all indorsers of persons for public\r\nplace would insure great caution in making recommendations. A salutary\r\nlesson has been taught the careless and the dishonest public servant in\r\nthe great number of prosecutions and convictions of the last two years.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to notice the favorable change which is taking place\r\nthroughout the country in bringing to punishment those who have proven\r\nrecreant to the trusts confided to them and in elevating to public\r\noffice none but those who possess the confidence of the honest and the\r\nvirtuous, who, it will always be found, comprise the majority of the\r\ncommunity in which they live.\r\n\r\nIn my message to Congress one year ago I urgently recommended a\r\nreform in the civil service of the country. In conformity with that\r\nrecommendation Congress, in the ninth section of \"An act making\r\nappropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government, and for\r\nother purposes,\" approved March 3, 1871, gave the necessary authority\r\nto the Executive to inaugurate a civil-service reform, and placed upon\r\nhim the responsibility of doing so. Under the authority of said act I\r\nconvened a board of gentlemen eminently qualified for the work to devise\r\nrules and regulations to effect the needed reform. Their labors are not\r\nyet complete, but it is believed that they will succeed in devising a\r\nplan that can be adopted to the great relief of the Executive, the heads\r\nof Departments, and members of Congress, and which will redound to the\r\ntrue interest of the public service. At all events, the experiment shall\r\nhave a fair trial.\r\n\r\nI have thus hastily summed up the operations of the Government during\r\nthe last year, and made such suggestions as occur to me to be proper for\r\nyour consideration. I submit them with a confidence that your combined\r\naction will be wise, statesmanlike, and in the best interests of the\r\nwhole country.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: See pp. 134-135.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: See pp. 135-136.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: See pp. 136-138.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 4, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn compliance with section 2 of the act making appropriations for the\r\nconsular and diplomatic expenses of the Government for the year ending\r\nJune 30, 1871, approved July 11, 1870, I herewith transmit the names and\r\nreports of and the amounts paid to consular agents of the United States.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 4, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to Congress a report, dated November 8, 1871,\r\nreceived from the Secretary of State, in compliance with the requirement\r\nof the act of March 3, 1871, making appropriations, among other things,\r\nfor the increase of expenses and compensation of certain diplomatic\r\nand consular officers of the United States on account of the late war\r\nbetween France and Prussia.

Their labors\r\nare now completed, and I transmit herewith their report,[53] together\r\nwith the rules which they recommend for my action. These rules have been\r\nadopted and will go into effect on the 1st day of January, 1872.\r\n\r\nUnder the law referred to, as I interpret it, the authority is already\r\ninvested in the Executive to enforce these regulations, with full power\r\nto abridge, alter, or amend them, at his option, when changes may be\r\ndeemed advisable.\r\n\r\nThese views, together with the report of the commissioners, are\r\nsubmitted for your careful consideration as to whether further\r\nlegislation may be necessary in order to carry out an effective and\r\nbeneficial civil-service reform. If left to me, without further\r\nCongressional action, the rules prescribed by the commission, under the\r\nreservation already mentioned, will be faithfully executed; but they are\r\nnot binding, without further legislation, upon my successors.\r\n\r\nBeing desirous of bringing this subject to the attention of Congress\r\nbefore the approaching recess, I have not time to sufficiently examine\r\nthe accompanying report to enable me to suggest definite legislative\r\naction to insure the support which may be necessary in order to give\r\na thorough trial to a policy long needed.\r\n\r\nI ask for all the strength which Congress can give me to enable\r\nme to carry out the reforms in the civil service recommended by the\r\ncommission, and adopted to take effect, as before stated, on January 1,\r\n1872.\r\n\r\nThe law which provides for the convening of a commission to devise\r\nrules and regulations for reforming the civil service authorizes,\r\nI think, the permanent organization of a primary board under whose\r\ngeneral direction all examinations of applicants for public office shall\r\nbe conducted. There is no appropriation to continue such a board beyond\r\nthe termination of its present labors. I therefore recommend that a\r\nproper appropriation be made to continue the services of the present\r\nboard for another year, and in view of the fact that three members of\r\nthe board held positions in the public service, which precludes them\r\nfrom receiving extra compensation, under existing laws, that they be\r\nauthorized to receive a fair compensation for extra services rendered\r\nby them in the performance of this duty.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRULES FOR THE CIVIL SERVICE.\r\n\r\n1. No person shall be admitted to any position in the civil service\r\nwithin the appointment of the President or the heads of Departments who\r\nis not a citizen of the United States; who shall not have furnished\r\nsatisfactory evidence in regard to character, health, and age, and who\r\nshall not have passed a satisfactory examination in speaking, reading,\r\nand writing the English language.\r\n\r\n2. An advisory board of suitable persons, to be employed by the\r\nPresident under the ninth section of the act of March 3, 1871, entitled\r\n\"An act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the\r\nGovernment for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1872, and for other\r\npurposes,\" shall, so far as practicable, group the positions in each\r\nbranch of the civil service according to the character of the duties to\r\nbe performed, and shall grade each group from lowest to highest for the\r\npurpose of promotion within the group. Admission to the civil service\r\nshall always be to the lowest grade of any group; and to such positions\r\nas can not be grouped or graded admission shall be determined as\r\nprovided for the lowest grade.\r\n\r\n3. A vacancy occurring in the lowest grade of any group of offices shall\r\nbe filled, after due public notice, from all applicants who shall\r\npresent themselves, and who shall have furnished the evidence and\r\nsatisfied the preliminary examination already mentioned, and who shall\r\nhave passed a public competitive examination to test knowledge, ability,\r\nand special qualifications for the performance of the duties of the\r\noffice. The board conducting such competitive examination shall prepare,\r\nunder the supervision of the Advisory Board, a list of the names of the\r\napplicants in the order of their excellence as proved by such\r\nexamination, beginning with the highest, and shall then certify to the\r\nnominating or appointing power, as the case may be, the names standing\r\nat the head of such list, not exceeding three, and from the names thus\r\ncertified the appointment shall be made.\r\n\r\n4. A vacancy occurring in any grade of a group of offices above the\r\nlowest shall be filled by a competitive examination of applicants from\r\nthe other grades of that group, and the list of names from which the\r\nappointment is to be made shall be prepared and certified as provided\r\nin the preceding rule; but if no such applicants are found competent\r\nthe appointment shall be made upon an examination of all applicants,\r\nconducted in accordance with the provisions for admission to the lowest\r\ngrade.\r\n\r\n5. Applicants certified as otherwise qualified for appointment as\r\ncashiers of collectors of customs, cashiers of assistant treasurers,\r\ncashiers of postmasters, superintendents of money-order divisions in\r\npost-offices, and such other custodians of large sums of money as may\r\nhereafter be designated by the Advisory Board, and for whose pecuniary\r\nfidelity another officer is responsible, shall, nevertheless, not be\r\nappointed except with the approval of such other officer.\r\n\r\n6. Postmasters whose annual salary is less than $200 may be appointed\r\nupon the written request of applicants, with such evidence of character\r\nand fitness as shall be satisfactory to the head of the Department.\r\n\r\n7. The appointment of all persons entering the civil service in\r\naccordance with these regulations, excepting persons appointed by the\r\nPresident by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, postmasters,\r\nand persons appointed to any position in a foreign country, shall be\r\nmade for a probationary term of six months, during which the conduct and\r\ncapacity of such persons shall be tested; and if at the end of said\r\nprobationary term satisfactory proofs of their fitness shall have been\r\nfurnished by the board of examiners to the head of the Department in\r\nwhich they shall have been employed during said term, they shall be\r\nreappointed.\r\n\r\n8. The President will designate three persons in each Department of\r\nthe public service to serve as a board of examiners, which, under the\r\nsupervision of the Advisory Board and under regulations to be prescribed\r\nby it, and at such times and places as it may determine, shall conduct,\r\npersonally or by persons approved by the Advisory Board, all\r\ninvestigations and examinations for admission into said Departments or\r\nfor promotion therein.\r\n\r\n9. Any person who, after long and faithful service in a Department,\r\nshall be incapacitated by mental or bodily infirmity for the efficient\r\ndischarge of the duties of his position may be appointed by the head of\r\nthe Department, at his discretion, to a position of less responsibility\r\nin the same Department.\r\n\r\n10. Nothing in these rules shall prevent the appointment of aliens to\r\npositions in the consular service which by reason of small compensation\r\nor of other sufficient cause are, in the judgment of the appointing\r\npower, necessarily so filled, nor the appointment of such persons within\r\nthe United States as are indispensable to a proper discharge of the\r\nduties of certain positions, but who may not be familiar with the\r\nEnglish language or legally capable of naturalization.\r\n\r\n11. No head of a Department nor any subordinate officer of the\r\nGovernment shall, as such officer, authorize or permit or assist in\r\nlevying any assessment of money for political purposes, under the form\r\nof voluntary contributions or otherwise, upon any person employed under\r\nhis control, nor shall any such person pay any money so assessed.\r\n\r\n12. The Advisory Board shall at any time recommend to the President such\r\nchanges in these rules as it may consider necessary to secure the\r\ngreater efficiency of the civil service.\r\n\r\n13. From these rules are excepted the heads of Departments, Assistant\r\nSecretaries of Departments, Assistant Attorneys-General, and First\r\nAssistant Postmaster-General, Solicitor-General, Solicitor of the\r\nTreasury, Naval Solicitor, Solicitor of Internal Revenue, examiner of\r\nclaims in the State Department, Treasurer of the United States, Register\r\nof the Treasury, First and Second Comptrollers of the Treasury, judges\r\nof the United States courts, district attorneys, private secretary of\r\nthe President, ambassadors and other public ministers, Superintendent\r\nof the Coast Survey, Director of the Mint, governors of Territories,\r\nspecial commissioners, special counsel, visiting and examining boards,\r\npersons appointed to positions without compensation for services,\r\ndispatch agents, and bearers of dispatches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 20, 1871_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 6th\r\ninstant, requesting information in regard to certain measures with\r\nreference to the Spanish West Indies, I transmit reports from the\r\nSecretary of State and of the Navy, with the documents by which they\r\nwere accompanied.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 8, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 6th of\r\nDecember, requesting to be informed if any further action is necessary\r\nby Congress to secure the immediate temporary preservation of the\r\narchives or public records now in the State Department, I transmit a\r\nreport and accompanying papers from the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 9, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 19th of December\r\nlast, calling for certain correspondence relating to the subject of\r\ninternational coinage not heretofore furnished, I transmit herewith a\r\nreport from the Secretary of State, with the papers which accompanied\r\nit.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 15, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the consideration of the Senate with a view to\r\nratification, a convention between the United States and His Majesty the\r\nEmperor of Austria-Hungary, relative to the protection of trade-marks.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 15, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the consideration of the Senate with a view to\r\nratification, a convention between the United States and His Majesty the\r\nEmperor of Germany, relative to the rights, privileges, and duties of\r\nconsuls and to the protection of trade-marks, signed at Berlin on the\r\n11th ultimo.\r\n\r\nA copy of the dispatch of the 11th ultimo from Mr. Bancroft, which\r\naccompanied the convention, is also transmitted for the information of\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 16, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 16th of May last,\r\ncalling for papers, correspondence, and information relating to the case\r\nof the ship _Hudson_ and schooner _Washington_[54] I transmit reports\r\nfrom the Secretaries of State and of the Navy and the papers by which\r\nthey were accompanied.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: Seized by British authorities at the Falkland Islands in\r\n1854.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 30, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 15th\r\ninstant, calling for certain correspondence relating to the release of\r\nthe Fenian prisoner William G.

They are connected with similar combinations in other\r\ncounties and States, and no doubt are part of a grand system of criminal\r\nassociations pervading most of the Southern States. The members are\r\nbound to obedience and secrecy by oaths which they are taught to regard\r\nas of higher obligation than the lawful oaths taken before civil\r\nmagistrates.\r\n\r\n\"They are organized and armed. They effect their objects by personal\r\nviolence, often extending to murder. They terrify witnesses; they\r\ncontrol juries in the State courts, and sometimes in the courts of\r\nthe United States. Systematic perjury is one of the means by which\r\nprosecutions of the members are defeated. From information given by\r\nofficers of the State and of the United States and by credible private\r\ncitizens I am justified in affirming that the instances of criminal\r\nviolence perpetrated by these combinations within the last twelve\r\nmonths in the above-named counties could be reckoned by thousands.\"\r\n\r\nI received information of a similar import from various other sources,\r\namong which were the Joint Select Committee of Congress upon Southern\r\nOutrages, the officers of the State, the military officers of the United\r\nStates on duty in South Carolina, the United States attorney and\r\nmarshal, and other civil officers of the Government, repentant and\r\nabjuring members of those unlawful organizations, persons specially\r\nemployed by the Department of Justice to detect crimes against the\r\nUnited States, and from other credible persons.\r\n\r\nMost, if not all, of this information, except what I derived from the\r\nAttorney-General, came to me orally, and was to the effect that said\r\ncounties were under the sway of powerful combinations, properly known as\r\n\"Kuklux Klans,\" the objects of which were by force and terror to prevent\r\nall political action not in accord with the views of the members; to\r\ndeprive colored citizens of the right to bear arms and of the right to a\r\nfree ballot; to suppress schools in which colored children were taught,\r\nand to reduce the colored people to a condition closely akin to that of\r\nslavery; that these combinations were organized and armed, and had\r\nrendered the local laws ineffectual to protect the classes whom they\r\ndesired to oppress; that they had perpetrated many murders and hundreds\r\nof crimes of minor degree, all of which were unpunished; and that\r\nwitnesses could not safely testify against them unless the more active\r\nmembers were placed under restraint.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 20, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of

authorities of the western district of Arkansas,\r\nit seems to be necessary that Congress should adopt such measures as\r\nwill tend to allay that feeling and at the same time secure the\r\nenforcement of the laws in that Territory.\r\n\r\nI therefore concur with the Acting Secretary of the Interior in\r\nsuggesting the adoption of a pending bill for the erection of a judicial\r\ndistrict within the Indian Territory, as a measure which will afford the\r\nmost immediate remedy for the existing troubles.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[A similar message, dated May 10, was sent to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, in answer to a resolution of that body of April 29.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 13, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the correspondence which has recently taken place\r\nrespecting the differences of opinion which have arisen between this\r\nGovernment and that of Great Britain with regard to the powers of the\r\ntribunal of arbitration created under the treaty signed at Washington\r\nMay 8, 1871.\r\n\r\nI respectfully invite the attention of the Senate to the proposed\r\narticle submitted by the British Government with the object of removing\r\nthe differences which seem to threaten the prosecution of the\r\narbitration, and request an expression by the Senate of their\r\ndisposition in regard to advising and consenting to the formal adoption\r\nof an article such as is proposed by the British Government.\r\n\r\nThe Senate is aware that the consultation with that body in advance\r\nof entering into agreements with foreign states has many precedents.\r\nIn the early days of the Republic General Washington repeatedly asked\r\ntheir advice upon pending questions with such powers. The most important\r\nrecent precedent is that of the Oregon boundary treaty, in 1846.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the results hanging upon the present state of the\r\ntreaty with Great Britain leads me to follow these former precedents\r\nand to desire the counsel of the Senate in advance of agreeing to the\r\nproposal of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 14, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn my message to Congress at the beginning of its present session\r\nallusion was made to the hardships and privations inflicted upon poor\r\nimmigrants on shipboard and upon arrival on our shores, and a suggestion\r\nwas made favoring national legislation for the purpose of effecting a\r\nradical cure of the evil.\r\n\r\nPromise was made that a special message on this subject would be\r\npresented during the present session should information be received\r\nwhich would warrant it. I now transmit to the two Houses of Congress\r\nall that has been officially received since that time bearing upon the\r\nsubject, and recommend that such legislation be had as will secure,\r\nfirst, such room and accommodation on shipboard as is necessary for\r\nhealth and comfort, and such privacy and protection as not to compel\r\nimmigrants to be the unwilling witnesses to so much vice and misery;\r\nand, second, legislation to protect them upon their arrival at our\r\nseaports from the knaves who are ever ready to despoil them of the\r\nlittle all which they are able to bring with them. Such legislation\r\nwill be in the interests of humanity, and seems to be fully justifiable.\r\nThe immigrant is not a citizen of any State or Territory upon his\r\narrival, but comes here to become a citizen of a great Republic, free\r\nto change his residence at will, to enjoy the blessings of a protecting\r\nGovernment, where all are equal before the law, and to add to the\r\nnational wealth by his industry.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival he does not know States or corporations, but confides\r\nimplicitly in the protecting arm of the great, free country of which\r\nhe has heard so much before leaving his native land. It is a source of\r\nserious disappointment and discouragement to those who start with means\r\nsufficient to support them comfortably until they can choose a residence\r\nand begin employment for a comfortable support to find themselves\r\nsubject to ill treatment and every discomfort on their passage here, and\r\nat the end of their journey seized upon by professed friends, claiming\r\nlegal right to take charge of them for their protection, who do not\r\nleave them until all their resources are exhausted, when they are\r\nabandoned in a strange land, surrounded by strangers, without employment\r\nand ignorant of the means of securing it. Under the present system this\r\nis the fate of thousands annually, the exposures on shipboard and the\r\ntreatment on landing driving thousands to lives of vice and shame who,\r\nwith proper humane treatment, might become useful and respectable\r\nmembers of society.\r\n\r\nI do not advise national legislation in affairs that should be regulated\r\nby the States; but I see no subject more national in its character than\r\nprovision for the safety and welfare of the thousands who leave foreign\r\nlands to become citizens of this Republic.\r\n\r\nWhen their residence is chosen, they may then look to the laws of their\r\nlocality for protection and guidance.\r\n\r\nThe mass of immigrants arriving upon our shores, coming, as they do, on\r\nvessels under foreign flags, makes treaties with the nations furnishing\r\nthese immigrants necessary for their complete protection. For more than\r\ntwo years efforts have been made on our part to secure such treaties,\r\nand there is now reasonable ground to hope for success.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 14, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to a resolution of the Senate of the 28th of March last, I\r\ntransmit herewith copies of the correspondence between the Department of\r\nState and the consul of the United States at Bucharest relative to the\r\npersecution and oppression of the Israelites in the Principality of\r\nRoumania.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 15, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, the correspondence which has recently taken place\r\nrespecting the differences of opinion which have arisen between this\r\nGovernment and that of Great Britain with regard to the powers of the\r\ntribunal of arbitration created under the treaty signed at Washington\r\nMay 8, 1871, and which has led to certain negotiations, still pending,\r\nbetween the two Governments.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 17, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the Senate a communication of this date from\r\nthe Acting Secretary of the Interior, and the papers therein described,\r\ncontaining information[65] called for in the Senate resolution of the 23d\r\nultimo, which was answered in part on the 8th [7th] instant.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Relating to acts of United States marshals and deputy\r\nmarshals in that portion of the western district of Arkansas comprising\r\nthe Indian country.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 21, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 14th\r\ninstant, requesting information in regard to the commerce between the\r\nUnited States and certain British colonial possessions, I transmit a\r\nreport from the Secretary of State and the documents by which it was\r\naccompanied.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 22, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 20th\r\ninstant, requesting me to join the Italian Government in a protest\r\nagainst the intolerant and cruel treatment of the Jews in Roumania, I\r\ntransmit a report from the Secretary of State relative to the subject.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 22, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration, an agreement between\r\nthe Great Chief of the island of Tutuila, one of the Samoan group, in\r\nthe South Pacific, and Commander R.W. Meade, commanding the United\r\nStates steamer _Narragansett_, bearing date the 17th of February last.\r\nThis instrument proposes to confer upon this Government the exclusive\r\nprivilege of establishing a naval station in the dominions of that chief\r\nfor the equivalent of protecting those dominions.\r\n\r\nA copy of a letter of the 15th instant, and of its accompaniment,\r\naddressed by the Secretary of the Navy to the Secretary of State,\r\ndescriptive of Tutuila and of other islands of the group, and of a\r\nletter in the nature of a protest from a person claiming to be consul\r\nof the North German Confederation in that quarter, are also herewith\r\ntransmitted. No report has yet been received from Commander Meade on the\r\nsubject. Although he was without special instructions or authority to\r\nenter into such agreement, the advantages of the concession which it\r\nproposes to make are so great, in view of the advantageous position\r\nof Tutuila, especially as a coaling station for steamers between San\r\nFrancisco and Australia, that I should not hesitate to recommend its\r\napproval but for the protection on the part of the United States\r\nwhich it seems to imply. With some modification of the obligation\r\nof protection which the agreement imports, it is recommended to the\r\nfavorable consideration of the Senate.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 23, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith, in answer to the resolution\r\nof the Senate of March 12, requesting to be informed of \"the amount\r\nof money expended by the Government of the United States during the\r\nlast three years for telegraphing by ocean cables,\" reports from the\r\ndifferent Departments of the Government, to which the resolution was\r\nreferred.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 24, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn compliance with section 2 of the act approved July 11, 1870, entitled\r\n\"An act making appropriations for the consular and diplomatic expenses\r\nof the Government for the year ending June 30, 1871, and for other\r\npurposes,\" I have the honor to transmit herewith the report of D.B.R.\r\nKeim, agent to examine consular affairs.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 28, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn further answer to the resolution of the 14th instant of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, wherein information in regard to commerce between the\r\nUnited States and certain British colonial possessions is requested, I\r\ntransmit a report from the Postmaster-General and the document by which\r\nit was accompanied.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 28, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 7th\r\ninstant, requesting copies of correspondence in regard to an extradition\r\ntreaty with Belgium, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State and\r\nthe documents by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 31, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI have the honor to respectfully call the attention of Congress to an\r\nact approved July 14, 1870, directing the Secretary of War to place at\r\nthe disposal of the President certain bronze ordnance, to aid in the\r\nerection of an equestrian statue of the late General John A. Rawlins,\r\nand to the facts that no appropriation of money to pay for the statue\r\nis made by the resolution and no artist is named or party designated to\r\nwhom the ordnance is to be delivered. In view of the ambiguity of the\r\nstatute, I would recommend that Congress signify what action is desired\r\nas to the selection of the artist, and that the necessary sum required\r\nfor the erection of the monument be appropriated. A board of officers\r\nshould also be named to designate the location of the monument.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 28, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI herewith return, for the further consideration of Congress, without\r\nmy approval, House bill No. 1550, \"An act for the relief of the estate\r\nof Dr. John F. Hanks,\" for the reason that the records of the Treasury\r\nDepartment show that the current moneys taken by Colonel S.B. Holabird\r\nfrom the Louisiana State Bank of New Orleans in the month of August,\r\n1862, were accounted for by that officer to the Treasury Department,\r\nand the names of the depositors given, and that the name of Dr. John\r\nF. Hanks does not appear among them.\r\n\r\nIt also appears from the records of the Treasury Department that among\r\nthe effects taken from the Louisiana State Bank of New Orleans was the\r\nsum of $1,729 of Confederate money, and that the said sum stood upon\r\nthe books of said bank to the credit of J.F. Hanks. It is but justice,\r\nhowever, to the executors of the estate of Dr. Hanks to state that there\r\nis every reason to believe that the money deposited by Dr. Hanks in the\r\nLouisiana State Bank was in current funds, and that when application was\r\nmade to Congress for the recovery of the same they believed, and had\r\nevidence to satisfy them, that such funds had found their way into the\r\nTreasury of the United States. There has unquestionably been a mistake\r\nmade, either by the officers of the Louisiana State Bank or the persons\r\nengaged in removing the funds of that bank, by which the estate of Dr.\r\nHanks is loser to the amount of relief afforded by House bill No. 1550.\r\n\r\nAccompanying this I send the statement furnished by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury of the funds covered into his Department, and accounted for\r\nthrough it, arising from the seizure of funds of the Louisiana State\r\nBank of New Orleans in the month of August, 1862.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 1, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI return herewith, for the further consideration of Congress, House\r\nbill No. 1867, \"An act for the relief of James T. Johnston,\" without my\r\napproval, for the reason that the records of the Treasury Department\r\nshow that the lot sold in the name of J.T. Johnston, situate on Prince\r\nstreet, Alexandria, Va., for taxes due the United States, is numbered\r\n162, instead of 163, as represented in this bill. With the exception of\r\nthis discrepancy in the number of the lot there is no reason why the\r\nbill should not receive my approval.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 10, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI have received and taken into consideration the bill entitled \"An act\r\nfor the relief of the children of John M. Baker, deceased,\" and,\r\npursuant to the duty required of me by the Constitution, I return the\r\nsame with my objections to the House of Representatives, in which it\r\noriginated.\r\n\r\nThe bill proposes to pay a sum of money to the children of John M.\r\nBaker, deceased, late United States consul at Rio Janeiro, for services\r\nof that person as acting chargé d'affaires of the United States\r\nin the year 1834. So far as it can be ascertained it is apprehended\r\nthat the bill may have received the sanction of Congress through some\r\ninadvertence, for upon inquiry at the proper Department it appears that\r\nMr. Baker never did act as chargé d'affaires of the United States at Rio\r\nJaneiro, and that he was not authorized so to act, but, on the contrary,\r\nwas expressly forbidden to enter into diplomatic correspondence with the\r\nGovernment of Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe letter of the 8th of February, 1854, a copy of which is annexed,\r\naddressed by William L. Marcy, then Secretary of State, to James M.\r\nMason, chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate,\r\nspecifies objections to the claim, which it is believed have not since\r\ndiminished, and in which I fully concur.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 15, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI return without my approval an act entitled \"An act granting a pension\r\nto Abigail Ryan, widow of Thomas A. Ryan.\" The name of Mrs. Ryan is now\r\nborne upon the pension rolls, pursuant to an act of Congress entitled\r\n\"An act for the relief of Mrs. Abigail Ryan,\" approved June 15, 1866\r\n(14 U.S. Statutes at Large, p. 590).\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 22, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI return herewith House resolution No. 622, entitled \"An act granting\r\na pension to Richard B. Crawford,\" without my approval, for the reason\r\nthat said Crawford is now drawing a pension as a private soldier, the\r\nwound on account of which he was pensioned having been received before\r\nhis promotion to a lieutenancy.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 14, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI have the honor to return herewith the bill (S. 955) entitled\r\n\"An act granting a pension to Mary Ann Montgomery, widow of William\r\nW. Montgomery, late captain in Texas Volunteers,\" without my approval,\r\ninasmuch as the concluding phrase, \"and in respect to her minor children\r\nunder 16 years of age,\" has obviously no meaning whatsoever. If it were\r\nthe intention of the framer of the bill that the pension thereby granted\r\nshould revert to said minor children upon the remarriage or death of the\r\nwidow, the phrase referred to should read as follows: \"And in the event\r\nof her remarriage or death, to her minor children under 16 years of\r\nage.\" I therefore return the bill for proper action.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 1, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI have examined the bill entitled \"An act for the relief of J. Milton\r\nBest,\" and, being unable to give it my approval, return the same to the\r\nSenate, the House in which it originated, without my signature.\r\n\r\nThe bill appropriates the sum of $25,000 to compensate Dr. J. Milton\r\nBest for the destruction of his dwelling house and its contents by order\r\nof the commanding officer of the United States military forces at\r\nPaducah, Ky., on the 26th day of March, 1864. It appears that this house\r\nwas one of a considerable number destroyed for the purpose of giving\r\nopen range to the guns of a United States fort. On the day preceding\r\nthe destruction the houses had been used as a cover for rebel troops\r\nattacking the fort, and, apprehending a renewal of the attack, the\r\ncommanding officer caused the destruction of the houses. This, then, is\r\na claim for compensation on account of the ravages of war. It can not be\r\ndenied that the payment of this claim would invite the presentation of\r\ndemands for very large sums of money; and such is the supposed magnitude\r\nof the claims that may be made against the Government for necessary and\r\nunavoidable destruction of property by the Army that I deem it proper to\r\nreturn this bill for reconsideration.\r\n\r\nIt is a general principle of both international and municipal law that\r\nall property is held subject not only to be taken by the Government for\r\npublic uses, in which case, under the Constitution of the United States,\r\nthe owner is entitled to just compensation, but also subject to be\r\ntemporarily occupied, or even actually destroyed, in times of great\r\npublic danger, and when the public safety demands it; and in this latter\r\ncase governments do not admit a legal obligation on their part to\r\ncompensate the owner. The temporary occupation of, injuries to, and\r\ndestruction of property caused by actual and necessary military\r\noperations are generally considered to fall within the last-mentioned\r\nprinciple. If a government makes compensation under such circumstances,\r\nit is a matter of bounty rather than of strict legal right.\r\n\r\nIf it be deemed proper to make compensation for such losses, I suggest\r\nfor the consideration of Congress whether it would not be better, by\r\ngeneral legislation, to provide some means for the ascertainment of the\r\ndamage in all similar cases, and thus save to claimants the expense,\r\ninconvenience, and delay of attendance upon Congress, and at the same\r\ntime save the Government from the danger of having imposed upon it\r\nfictitious or exaggerated claims supported wholly by _ex parte_ proof.\r\nIf the claimant in this case ought to be paid, so ought all others\r\nsimilarly situated; and that there are many such can not be doubted.\r\nBesides, there are strong reasons for believing that the amount of\r\ndamage in this case has been greatly overestimated. If this be true,\r\nit furnishes an illustration of the danger of trusting entirely to\r\n_ex parte_ testimony in such matters.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 7, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI have the honor to return herewith Senate bill No. 569, an act entitled\r\n\"An act for the relief of Thomas B. Wallace, of Lexington, in the State\r\nof Missouri,\" without my approval.\r\n\r\nThis claim, for which $11,250 are appropriated by this bill, is of the\r\nsame nature and character as the claim of Dr. J. Milton Best, which was\r\nreturned to the Senate on the 1st instant without my signature.\r\n\r\nThe same reasons which prompted the return of that bill for\r\nreconsideration apply in this case, which also is a claim for\r\ncompensation on account of the ravages of war, and comes under the same\r\ngeneral principle of both international and municipal law, that all\r\nproperty is held subject not only to be taken by the Government for\r\npublic uses, in which case, under the Constitution of the United States,\r\nthe owner is entitled to just compensation, but also subject to be\r\ntemporarily occupied, or even actually destroyed, in times of great\r\npublic danger, and when the public safety demands it; and in the latter\r\ncase governments do not admit a legal obligation on their part to\r\ncompensate the owner.\r\n\r\nThe temporary occupation of, injuries to, and destruction of property\r\ncaused by actual and necessary military operations are generally\r\nconsidered to fall within the last-mentioned principle, and if a\r\ngovernment makes compensation under such circumstances it is a matter of\r\nbounty rather than of strict legal right. If it be deemed proper to make\r\ncompensation for such losses, I renew my recommendation that provision\r\nbe made by general legislation for all similar cases.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas satisfactory information has been received by me, through Don\r\nMauricio Lopez Roberts, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary\r\nof His Majesty the King of Spain, that the Government of that country\r\nhas abolished discriminating duties heretofore imposed on merchandise\r\nimported from all other countries, excepting the islands of Cuba and\r\nPorto Rico, into Spain and the adjacent islands in vessels of the United\r\nStates, said abolition to take effect from and after the 1st day of\r\nJanuary next:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Ulysses S.

Charged with the\r\nadministration of the Department of State at a most critical period in\r\nthe history of the nation, Mr. Seward brought to the duties of that\r\noffice exalted patriotism, unwearied industry, and consummate ability.\r\nA grateful nation will cherish his name, his fame, and his memory.\r\n\r\nThe several Executive Departments will cause appropriate honors to be\r\nrendered to the memory of the deceased statesman at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON FISH, _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 2, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn transmitting to you this my fourth annual message it is with\r\nthankfulness to the Giver of All Good that as a nation we have been\r\nblessed for the past year with peace at home, peace abroad, and a\r\ngeneral prosperity vouchsafed to but few peoples.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the recent devastating fire which swept from the\r\nearth with a breath, as it were, millions of accumulated wealth in the\r\ncity of Boston, there has been no overshadowing calamity within the year\r\nto record. It is gratifying to note how, like their fellow-citizens\r\nof the city of Chicago under similar circumstances a year earlier,\r\nthe citizens of Boston are rallying under their misfortunes, and the\r\nprospect that their energy and perseverance will overcome all obstacles\r\nand show the same prosperity soon that they would had no disaster\r\nbefallen them. Otherwise we have been free from pestilence, war, and\r\ncalamities, which often overtake nations; and, as far as human judgment\r\ncan penetrate the future, no cause seems to exist to threaten our\r\npresent peace.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress adjourned in June last, a question had been raised\r\nby Great Britain, and was then pending, which for a time seriously\r\nimperiled the settlement by friendly arbitration of the grave\r\ndifferences between this Government and that of Her Britannic Majesty,\r\nwhich by the treaty of Washington had been referred to the tribunal of\r\narbitration which had met at Geneva, in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe arbitrators, however, disposed of the question which had jeoparded\r\nthe whole of the treaty and threatened to involve the two nations\r\nin most unhappy relations toward each other in a manner entirely\r\nsatisfactory to this Government and in accordance with the views and\r\nthe policy which it had maintained.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal, which had convened at Geneva in December, concluded its\r\nlaborious session on the 14th day of September last, on which day,\r\nhaving availed itself of the discretionary power given to it by the\r\ntreaty to award a sum in gross, it made its decision, whereby it awarded\r\nthe sum of $15,500,000 in gold as the indemnity to be paid by Great\r\nBritain to the United States for the satisfaction of all the claims\r\nreferred to its consideration.\r\n\r\nThis decision happily disposes of a long-standing difference between\r\nthe two Governments, and, in connection with another award, made by the\r\nGerman Emperor under a reference to him by the same treaty, leaves these\r\ntwo Governments without a shadow upon the friendly relations which it is\r\nmy sincere hope may forever remain equally unclouded.\r\n\r\nThe report of the agent of the United States appointed to attend the\r\nGeneva tribunal, accompanied by the protocols of the proceedings of the\r\narbitrators, the arguments of the counsel of both Governments, the award\r\nof the tribunal, and the opinions given by the several arbitrators, is\r\ntransmitted herewith.\r\n\r\nI have caused to be communicated to the heads of the three friendly\r\npowers who complied with the joint request made to them under the treaty\r\nthe thanks of this Government for the appointment of arbitrators made by\r\nthem respectively, and also my thanks to the eminent personages named by\r\nthem, and my appreciation of the dignity, patience, impartiality, and\r\ngreat ability with which they discharged their arduous and high\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government has communicated to me the appreciation by\r\nHer Majesty of the ability and indefatigable industry displayed by Mr.\r\nAdams, the arbitrator named on the part of this Government during the\r\nprotracted inquiries and discussions of the tribunal. I cordially unite\r\nwith Her Majesty in this appreciation.\r\n\r\nIt is due to the agent of the United States before the tribunal to\r\nrecord my high appreciation of the marked ability, unwearied patience,\r\nand the prudence and discretion with which he has conducted the very\r\nresponsible and delicate duties committed to him, as it is also due to\r\nthe learned and eminent counsel who attended the tribunal on the part of\r\nthis Government to express my sense of the talents and wisdom which they\r\nbrought to bear in the attainment of the result so happily reached.\r\n\r\nIt will be the province of Congress to provide for the distribution\r\namong those who may be entitled to it of their respective shares of\r\nthe money to be paid. Although the sum awarded is not payable until\r\na year from the date of the award, it is deemed advisable that no time\r\nbe lost in making a proper examination of the several cases in which\r\nindemnification may be due. I consequently recommend the creation of\r\na board of commissioners for the purpose.\r\n\r\nBy the thirty-fourth article of the treaty of Washington the respective\r\nclaims of the United States and of Great Britain in their construction\r\nof the treaty of the 15th of June, 1846, defining the boundary line\r\nbetween their respective territories, were submitted to the arbitration\r\nand award of His Majesty the Emperor of Germany, to decide which of\r\nthose claims is most in accordance with the true interpretation of the\r\ntreaty of 1846.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty the Emperor of Germany, having been pleased to undertake the\r\narbitration, has the earnest thanks of this Government and of the people\r\nof the United States for the labor, pains, and care which he has devoted\r\nto the consideration of this long-pending difference. I have caused an\r\nexpression of my thanks to be communicated to His Majesty. Mr. Bancroft,\r\nthe representative of this Government at Berlin, conducted the case and\r\nprepared the statement on the part of the United States with the ability\r\nthat his past services justified the public in expecting at his hands.\r\nAs a member of the Cabinet at the date of the treaty which has given\r\nrise to the discussion between the two Governments, as the minister to\r\nGreat Britain when the construction now pronounced unfounded was first\r\nadvanced, and as the agent and representative of the Government to\r\npresent the case and to receive the award, he has been associated with\r\nthe question in all of its phases, and in every stage has manifested a\r\npatriotic zeal and earnestness in maintenance of the claim of the United\r\nStates. He is entitled to much credit for the success which has attended\r\nthe submission.\r\n\r\nAfter a patient investigation of the case and of the statements of each\r\nparty, His Majesty the Emperor, on the 21st day of October last, signed\r\nhis award in writing, decreeing that the claim of the Government of the\r\nUnited States, that the boundary line between the territories of Her\r\nBritannic Majesty and the United States should be drawn through the\r\nHaro Channel, is most in accordance with the true interpretation of the\r\ntreaty concluded on the 15th of June, 1846, between the Governments of\r\nHer Britannic Majesty and of the United States.\r\n\r\nCopies of the \"case\" presented on behalf of each Government, and of\r\nthe \"statement in reply\" of each, and a translation of the award, are\r\ntransmitted herewith.\r\n\r\nThis award confirms the United States in their claim to the important\r\narchipelago of islands lying between the continent and Vancouvers\r\nIsland, which for more than twenty-six years (ever since the\r\nratification of the treaty) Great Britain has contested, and leaves us,\r\nfor the first time in the history of the United States as a nation,\r\nwithout a question of disputed boundary between our territory and the\r\npossessions of Great Britain on this continent.\r\n\r\nIt is my grateful duty to acknowledge the prompt, spontaneous action of\r\nHer Majesty's Government in giving effect to the award. In anticipation\r\nof any request from this Government, and before the reception in the\r\nUnited States of the award signed by the Emperor, Her Majesty had given\r\ninstructions for the removal of her troops which had been stationed\r\nthere and for the cessation of all exercise or claim of jurisdiction, so\r\nas to leave the United States in the exclusive possession of the lately\r\ndisputed territory. I am gratified to be able to announce that the\r\norders for the removal of the troops have been executed, and that the\r\nmilitary joint occupation of San Juan has ceased. The islands are now in\r\nthe exclusive possession of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt now becomes necessary to complete the survey and determination of\r\nthat portion of the boundary line (through the Haro Channel) upon which\r\nthe commission which determined the remaining part of the line were\r\nunable to agree. I recommend the appointment of a commission to act\r\njointly with one which may be named by Her Majesty for that purpose.\r\n\r\nExperience of the difficulties attending the determination of our\r\nadmitted line of boundary, after the occupation of the territory and\r\nits settlement by those owing allegiance to the respective Governments,\r\npoints to the importance of establishing, by natural objects or other\r\nmonuments, the actual line between the territory acquired by purchase\r\nfrom Russia and the adjoining possessions of Her Britannic Majesty.\r\nThe region is now so sparsely occupied that no conflicting interests\r\nof individuals or of jurisdiction are likely to interfere to the delay\r\nor embarrassment of the actual location of the line. If deferred until\r\npopulation shall enter and occupy the territory, some trivial contest of\r\nneighbors may again array the two Governments in antagonism. I therefore\r\nrecommend the appointment of a commission, to act jointly with one that\r\nmay be appointed on the part of Great Britain, to determine the line\r\nbetween our Territory of Alaska and the conterminous possessions of\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I recommended the legislation necessary on the\r\npart of the United States to bring into operation the articles of the\r\ntreaty of Washington of May 8, 1871, relating to the fisheries and to\r\nother matters touching the relations of the United States toward the\r\nBritish North American possessions, to become operative so soon as the\r\nproper legislation should be had on the part of Great Britain and its\r\npossessions.\r\n\r\nThat legislation on the part of Great Britain and its possessions had\r\nnot then been had, and during the session of Congress a question was\r\nraised which for the time raised a doubt whether any action by Congress\r\nin the direction indicated would become important. This question has\r\nsince been disposed of, and I have received notice that the Imperial\r\nParliament and the legislatures of the provincial governments have\r\npassed laws to carry the provisions of the treaty on the matters\r\nreferred to into operation. I therefore recommend your early adoption\r\nof the legislation in the same direction necessary on the part of this\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe joint commission for determining the boundary line between the\r\nUnited States and the British possessions between the Lake of the Woods\r\nand the Rocky Mountains has organized and entered upon its work. It is\r\ndesirable that the force be increased, in order that the completion of\r\nthe survey and determination of the line may be the sooner attained.\r\nTo this end I recommend that a sufficient appropriation be made.\r\n\r\nWith France, our earliest ally; Russia, the constant and steady friend\r\nof the United States; Germany, with whose Government and people we have\r\nso many causes of friendship and so many common sympathies, and the\r\nother powers of Europe, our relations are maintained on the most\r\nfriendly terms.\r\n\r\nSince my last annual message the exchange has been made of the\r\nratifications of a treaty with the Austro-Hungarian Empire relating\r\nto naturalization; also of a treaty with the German Empire respecting\r\nconsuls and trade-marks; also of a treaty with Sweden and Norway\r\nrelating to naturalization; all of which treaties have been duly\r\nproclaimed.\r\n\r\nCongress at its last session having made an appropriation to defray\r\nthe expense of commissioners on the part of the United States to the\r\nInternational Statistical Congress at St. Petersburg, the persons\r\nappointed in that character proceeded to their destination and attended\r\nthe sessions of the congress. Their report shall in due season be laid\r\nbefore you. This congress meets at intervals of about three years, and\r\nhas held its sessions in several of the countries of Europe. I submit\r\nto your consideration the propriety of extending an invitation to the\r\ncongress to hold its next meeting in the United States. The Centennial\r\nCelebration to be held in 1876 would afford an appropriate occasion for\r\nsuch meeting.\r\n\r\nPreparations are making for the international exposition to be held\r\nduring the next year in Vienna, on a scale of very great magnitude.\r\nThe tendency of these expositions is in the direction of advanced\r\ncivilization, and of the elevation of industry and of labor, and of the\r\nincrease of human happiness, as well as of greater intercourse and good\r\nwill between nations. As this exposition is to be the first which will\r\nhave been held in eastern Europe, it is believed that American inventors\r\nand manufacturers will be ready to avail themselves of the opportunity\r\nfor the presentation of their productions if encouraged by proper aid\r\nand protection.\r\n\r\nAt the last session of Congress authority was given for the appointment\r\nof one or more agents to represent this Government at the exposition.\r\nThe authority thus given has been exercised, but, in the absence of any\r\nappropriation, there is danger that the important benefits which the\r\noccasion offers will in a large degree be lost to citizens of the United\r\nStates. I commend the subject strongly to your consideration, and\r\nrecommend that an adequate appropriation be made for the purpose.\r\n\r\nTo further aid American exhibitors at the Vienna Exposition, I would\r\nrecommend, in addition to an appropriation of money, that the Secretary\r\nof the Navy be authorized to fit up two naval vessels to transport\r\nbetween our Atlantic cities and Trieste, or the most convenient port to\r\nVienna, and back, their articles for exhibition.\r\n\r\nSince your last session the President of the Mexican Republic,\r\ndistinguished by his high character and by his services to his country,\r\nhas died. His temporary successor has now been elected with great\r\nunanimity by the people--a proof of confidence on their part in his\r\npatriotism and wisdom which it is believed will be confirmed by the\r\nresults of his administration. It is particularly desirable that nothing\r\nshould be left undone by the Government of either Republic to strengthen\r\ntheir relations as neighbors and friends.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted that many lawless acts continue to disturb\r\nthe quiet of the settlements on the border between our territory and\r\nthat of Mexico, and that complaints of wrongs to American citizens in\r\nvarious parts of the country are made. The revolutionary condition in\r\nwhich the neighboring Republic has so long been involved has in some\r\ndegree contributed to this disturbance. It is to be hoped that with a\r\nmore settled rule of order through the Republic, which may be expected\r\nfrom the present Government, the acts of which just complaint is made\r\nwill cease.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the commission under the convention with Mexico of\r\nthe 4th of July, 1868, on the subject of claims, have, unfortunately,\r\nbeen checked by an obstacle, for the removal of which measures have been\r\ntaken by the two Governments which it is believed will prove successful.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed, pursuant to the joint resolution of\r\nCongress of the 7th of May last, to inquire into depredations on the\r\nTexan frontier have diligently made investigations in that quarter.\r\nTheir report upon the subject will be communicated to you. Their\r\nresearches were necessarily incomplete, partly on account of the limited\r\nappropriation made by Congress. Mexico, on the part of that Government,\r\nhas appointed a similar commission to investigate these outrages. It\r\nis not announced officially, but the press of that country states that\r\nthe fullest investigation is desired, and that the cooperation of all\r\nparties concerned is invited to secure that end. I therefore recommend\r\nthat a special appropriation be made at the earliest day practicable, to\r\nenable the commissioners on the part of the United States to return to\r\ntheir labors without delay.\r\n\r\nIt is with regret that I have again to announce a continuance of\r\nthe disturbed condition of the island of Cuba. No advance toward the\r\npacification of the discontented part of the population has been made.\r\nWhile the insurrection has gained no advantages and exhibits no more of\r\nthe elements of power or of the prospects of ultimate success than were\r\nexhibited a year ago, Spain, on the other hand, has not succeeded in\r\nits repression, and the parties stand apparently in the same relative\r\nattitude which they have occupied for a long time past.\r\n\r\nThis contest has lasted now for more than four years. Were its scene at\r\na distance from our neighborhood, we might be indifferent to its result,\r\nalthough humanity could not be unmoved by many of its incidents wherever\r\nthey might occur. It is, however, at our door.\r\n\r\nI can not doubt that the continued maintenance of slavery in Cuba\r\nis among the strongest inducements to the continuance of this strife.\r\nA terrible wrong is the natural cause of a terrible evil. The abolition\r\nof slavery and the introduction of other reforms in the administration\r\nof government in Cuba could not fail to advance the restoration of peace\r\nand order. It is greatly to be hoped that the present liberal Government\r\nof Spain will voluntarily adopt this view.\r\n\r\nThe law of emancipation, which was passed more than two years since, has\r\nremained unexecuted in the absence of regulations for its enforcement.\r\nIt was but a feeble step toward emancipation, but it was the recognition\r\nof right, and was hailed as such, and exhibited Spain in harmony with\r\nsentiments of humanity and of justice and in sympathy with the other\r\npowers of the Christian and civilized world.\r\n\r\nWithin the past few weeks the regulations for carrying out the law of\r\nemancipation have been announced, giving evidence of the sincerity of\r\nintention of the present Government to carry into effect the law of\r\n1870. I have not failed to urge the consideration of the wisdom, the\r\npolicy, and the justice of a more effective system for the abolition\r\nof the great evil which oppresses a race and continues a bloody and\r\ndestructive contest close to our border, as well as the expediency\r\nand the justice of conceding reforms of which the propriety is not\r\nquestioned.\r\n\r\nDeeply impressed with the conviction that the continuance of slavery\r\nis one of the most active causes of the continuance of the unhappy\r\ncondition in Cuba, I regret to believe that citizens of the United\r\nStates, or those claiming to be such, are large holders in Cuba of what\r\nis there claimed as property, but which is forbidden and denounced by\r\nthe laws of the United States. They are thus, in defiance of the spirit\r\nof our own laws, contributing to the continuance of this distressing and\r\nsickening contest. In my last annual message I referred to this subject,\r\nand I again recommend such legislation as may be proper to denounce,\r\nand, if not prevent, at least to discourage American citizens from\r\nholding or dealing in slaves.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to announce that the ratifications of the convention\r\nconcluded under the auspices of this Government between Spain on the one\r\npart and the allied Republics of the Pacific on the other, providing for\r\nan armistice, have been exchanged. A copy of the instrument is herewith\r\nsubmitted. It is hoped that this may be followed by a permanent peace\r\nbetween the same parties.\r\n\r\nThe differences which at one time threatened the maintenance of peace\r\nbetween Brazil and the Argentine Republic it is hoped are in the way of\r\nsatisfactory adjustment.\r\n\r\nWith these States, as with the Republics of Central and of South\r\nAmerica, we continue to maintain the most friendly relations.\r\n\r\nIt is with regret, however, I announce that the Government of\r\nVenezuela has made no further payments on account of the awards under\r\nthe convention of the 25th of April, 1866. That Republic is understood\r\nto be now almost, if not quite, tranquilized. It is hoped, therefore,\r\nthat it will lose no time in providing for the unpaid balance of its\r\ndebt to the United States, which, having originated in injuries to\r\nour citizens by Venezuelan authorities, and having been acknowledged,\r\npursuant to a treaty, in the most solemn form known among nations,\r\nwould seem to deserve a preference over debts of a different origin and\r\ncontracted in a different manner. This subject is again recommended to\r\nthe attention of Congress for such action as may be deemed proper.\r\n\r\nOur treaty relations with Japan remain unchanged. An imposing embassy\r\nfrom that interesting and progressive nation visited this country during\r\nthe year that is passing, but, being unprovided with powers for the\r\nsigning of a convention in this country, no conclusion in that direction\r\nwas reached. It is hoped, however, that the interchange of opinions\r\nwhich took place during their stay in this country has led to a mutual\r\nappreciation of the interests which may be promoted when the revision of\r\nthe existing treaty shall be undertaken.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I renew my recommendation of one year ago, that--\r\n\r\n  To give importance to and to add to the efficiency of our diplomatic\r\n  relations with Japan and China, and to further aid in retaining the\r\n  good opinion of those peoples, and to secure to the United States its\r\n  share of the commerce destined to flow between those nations and the\r\n  balance of the commercial world, an appropriation be made to support at\r\n  least four American youths in each of those countries, to serve as a\r\n  part of the official family of our ministers there. Our representatives\r\n  would not even then be placed upon an equality with the representatives\r\n  of Great Britain and of some other powers. As now situated, our\r\n  representatives in Japan and China have to depend for interpreters and\r\n  translators upon natives of those countries, who know our language\r\n  imperfectly, or procure for the occasion the services of employees in\r\n  foreign business houses or the interpreters to other foreign ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation made on a previous occasion, of the transfer\r\nto the Department of the Interior, to which they seem more appropriately\r\nto belong, of all the powers and duties in relation to the Territories\r\nwith which the Department of State is now charged by law or by custom.\r\n\r\nCongress from the beginning of the Government has wisely made provision\r\nfor the relief of distressed seamen in foreign countries. No similar\r\nprovision, however, has hitherto been made for the relief of citizens\r\nin distress abroad other than seamen. It is understood to be customary\r\nwith other governments to authorize consuls to extend such relief\r\nto their citizens or subjects in certain cases. A similar authority\r\nand an appropriation to carry it into effect are recommended in the\r\ncase of citizens of the United States destitute or sick under such\r\ncircumstances. It is well known that such citizens resort to foreign\r\ncountries in great numbers. Though most of them are able to bear the\r\nexpenses incident to locomotion, there are some who, through accident or\r\notherwise, become penniless, and have no friends at home able to succor\r\nthem. Persons in this situation must either perish, cast themselves upon\r\nthe charity of foreigners, or be relieved at the private charge of our\r\nown officers, who usually, even with the most benevolent dispositions,\r\nhave nothing to spare for such purposes.\r\n\r\nShould the authority and appropriation asked for be granted, care will\r\nbe taken so to carry the beneficence of Congress into effect that it\r\nshall not be unnecessarily or unworthily bestowed.\r\n\r\nTREASURY.\r\n\r\nThe moneys received and covered into the Treasury during the fiscal year\r\nended June 30, 1872, were:\r\n\r\n

it appears that the net reduction of the\r\nprincipal of the debt during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1872, was\r\n$99,960,253.54.\r\n\r\nThe source of this reduction is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n

debt from the 1st of March, 1869, to the present time as follows:\r\n\r\n  From March 1, 1869, to March 1, 1870             $87,134,782.84\r\n  From March 1, 1870, to March 1, 1871             117,619,630.25\r\n  From March 1, 1871, to March 1, 1872              94,895,348.94\r\n  From March 1, 1872, to November 1, 1872\r\n    (eight months)

the Government in collecting the revenue\r\nwill be much reduced for the next fiscal year. It is very doubtful,\r\nhowever, whether any further reduction of so vexatious a burden upon any\r\npeople will be practicable for the present. At all events, as a measure\r\nof justice to the holders of the nation's certificates of indebtedness,\r\nI would recommend that no more legislation be had on this subject,\r\nunless it be to correct errors of omission or commission in the present\r\nlaws, until sufficient time has elapsed to prove that it can be done and\r\nstill leave sufficient revenue to meet current expenses of Government,\r\npay interest on the public debt, and provide for the sinking fund\r\nestablished by law. The preservation of our national credit is of the\r\nhighest importance; next in importance to this comes a solemn duty to\r\nprovide a national currency of fixed, unvarying value as compared with\r\ngold, and as soon as practicable, having due regard for the interests of\r\nthe debtor class and the vicissitudes of trade and commerce, convertible\r\ninto gold at par.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War shows the expenditures of\r\nthe War Department for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1871, to be\r\n$35,799,991.82, and for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1872, to be\r\n$35,372,157.20, showing a reduction in favor of the last fiscal year\r\nof $427,834.62.\r\n\r\nThe estimates for military appropriations for the next fiscal year,\r\nending June 30, 1874, are $33,801,378.78.\r\n\r\nThe estimates of the Chief of Engineers are submitted separately for\r\nfortifications, river and harbor improvements, and for public buildings\r\nand grounds and the Washington Aqueduct.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the Freedmen's Bureau have all been transferred to the\r\nWar Department, and regulations have been put into execution for the\r\nspeedy payment of bounty, pay, etc., due colored soldiers, properly\r\ncoming under that Bureau. All war accounts, for money and property,\r\nprior to 1871 have been examined and transmitted to the Treasury for\r\nfinal settlement.\r\n\r\nDuring the fiscal year there has been paid for transportation on\r\nrailroads $1,300,000, of which $800,857 was over the Pacific railroads;\r\nfor transportation by water $626,373.52, and by stage $48,975.84; for\r\nthe purchase of transportation animals, wagons, hire of teamsters, etc.,\r\n$924,650.64.\r\n\r\nAbout $370,000 have been collected from Southern railroads during the\r\nyear, leaving about $4,000,000 still due.\r\n\r\nThe Quartermaster has examined and transmitted to the accounting\r\nofficers for settlement $367,172.72 of claims by loyal citizens for\r\nquartermaster stores taken during the war.\r\n\r\nSubsistence supplies to the amount of $89,048.12 have been issued to\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nThe annual average mean strength of the Army was 24,101 white and 2,494\r\ncolored soldiers. The total deaths for the year reported were 367 white\r\nand 54 colored.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the Medical and Surgical History of the War is yet\r\nto be ordered by Congress.\r\n\r\nThere exists an absolute necessity for a medical corps of the full\r\nnumber established by act of Congress of July 28, 1866, there being now\r\nfifty-nine vacancies, and the number of successful candidates rarely\r\nexceeds eight or ten in any one year.\r\n\r\nThe river and harbor improvements have been carried on with energy\r\nand economy. Though many are only partially completed, the results\r\nhave saved to commerce many times the amount expended. The increase\r\nof commerce, with greater depths of channels, greater security in\r\nnavigation, and the saving of time, adds millions to the wealth of\r\nthe country and increases the resources of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe bridge across the Mississippi River at Rock Island has been\r\ncompleted, and the proper site has been determined upon for the bridge\r\nat La Crosse.\r\n\r\nThe able and exhaustive report made by the commission appointed to\r\ninvestigate the Sutro Tunnel has been transmitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nThe observations and reports of the Signal Office have been continued.\r\nStations have been maintained at each of the principal lake, seaport,\r\nand river cities. Ten additional stations have been established in the\r\nUnited States, and arrangements have been made for an exchange of\r\nreports with Canada, and a similar exchange of observations is\r\ncontemplated with the West India Islands.\r\n\r\nThe favorable attention of Congress is invited to the following\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nA discontinuance of the appointment of extra lieutenants to serve as\r\nadjutants and quartermasters; the adoption of a code providing specific\r\npenalties for well-defined offenses, so that the inequality of sentences\r\nadjudged by courts-martial may be adjusted; the consolidation of\r\naccounts under which expenditures are made, as a measure of economy;\r\na reappropriation of the money for the construction of a depot at\r\nSan Antonio, the title to the site being now perfected; a special act\r\nplacing the cemetery at the City of Mexico on the same basis as other\r\nnational cemeteries; authority to purchase sites for military posts in\r\nTexas; the appointment of commissary sergeants from noncommissioned\r\nofficers, as a measure for securing the better care and protection\r\nof supplies; an appropriation for the publication of the catalogue\r\nand tables of the anatomical section of the Army Medical Museum; a\r\nreappropriation of the amount for the manufacture of breech-loading\r\narms, should the selection be so delayed by the board of officers as to\r\nleave the former appropriation unexpended at the close of the fiscal\r\nyear; the sale of such arsenals east of the Mississippi as can be\r\nspared, and the proceeds applied to the establishment of one large\r\narsenal of construction and repair upon the Atlantic Coast and the\r\npurchase of a suitable site for a proving and experimental ground for\r\nheavy ordnance; the abrogation of laws which deprive inventors in the\r\nUnited States service from deriving any benefit from their inventions;\r\nthe repeal of the law prohibiting promotions in the staff corps; a\r\ncontinuance of the work upon coast defenses; the repeal of the seventh\r\nsection of the act of July 13, 1866, taking from engineer soldiers the\r\nper diem granted to other troops; a limitation of time for presentation\r\nof old War claims for subsistence supplies under act of July 4, 1864;\r\nand a modification in the mode of the selection of cadets for the\r\nMilitary Academy, in order to enhance the usefulness of the Academy,\r\nwhich is impaired by reason of the large amount of time necessarily\r\nexpended in giving new cadets a thorough knowledge of the more\r\nelementary branches of learning, which they should acquire before\r\nentering the Academy. Also an appropriation for philosophical apparatus\r\nand an increase in the numbers and pay of the Military Academy band.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress will be called during its present session to\r\nvarious enterprises for the more certain and cheaper transportation of\r\nthe constantly increasing surplus of Western and Southern products to\r\nthe Atlantic Seaboard. The subject is one that will force itself upon\r\nthe legislative branch of the Government sooner or later, and I suggest,\r\ntherefore, that immediate steps be taken to gain all available\r\ninformation to insure equable and just legislation.\r\n\r\nOne route to connect the Mississippi Valley with the Atlantic, at\r\nCharleston, S.C., and Savannah, Ga., by water, by the way of the Ohio\r\nand Tennessee rivers, and canals and slack-water navigation to the\r\nSavannah and Ocmulgee rivers, has been surveyed, and report made by an\r\naccomplished engineer officer of the Army. Second and third new routes\r\nwill be proposed for the consideration of Congress, namely, by an\r\nextension of the Kanawha and James River Canal to the Ohio, and by\r\nextension of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal.\r\n\r\nI am not prepared to recommend Government aid to these or other\r\nenterprises until it is clearly shown that they are not only of national\r\ninterest, but that when completed they will be of a value commensurate\r\nwith their cost.\r\n\r\nThat production increases more rapidly than the means of transportation\r\nin our country has been demonstrated by past experience. That the\r\nunprecedented growth in population and products of the whole country\r\nwill require additional facilities--and cheaper ones for the more bulky\r\narticles of commerce to reach tide water and a market will be demanded\r\nin the near future--is equally demonstrable. I would therefore suggest\r\neither a committee or a commission to be authorized to consider this\r\nwhole question, and to report to Congress at some future day for its\r\nbetter guidance in legislating on this important subject.\r\n\r\nThe railroads of the country have been rapidly extended during the last\r\nfew years to meet the growing demands of producers, and reflect much\r\ncredit upon the capitalists and managers engaged in their construction.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, a project to facilitate commerce by the building\r\nof a ship canal around Niagara Falls, on the United States side, which\r\nhas been agitated for many years, will no doubt be called to your\r\nattention at this session.\r\n\r\nLooking to the great future growth of the country and the increasing\r\ndemands of commerce, it might be well while on this subject not only\r\nto have examined and reported upon the various practicable routes for\r\nconnecting the Mississippi with tide water on the Atlantic, but the\r\nfeasibility of an almost continuous landlocked navigation from Maine to\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico. Such a route along our coast would be of great value\r\nat all times, and of inestimable value in case of a foreign war. Nature\r\nhas provided the greater part of this route, and the obstacles to\r\novercome are easily within the skill of the engineer.\r\n\r\nI have not alluded to this subject with the view of having any further\r\nexpenditure of public money at this time than may be necessary to\r\nprocure and place all the necessary information before Congress in an\r\nauthentic form, to enable it hereafter, if deemed practicable and\r\nworthy, to legislate on the subject without delay.\r\n\r\nNAVY DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy herewith accompanying explains\r\nfully the condition of that branch of the public service, its wants and\r\ndeficiencies, expenses incurred during the past year, and appropriations\r\nfor the same. It also gives a complete history of the services of the\r\nNavy for the past year in addition to its regular service.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that unless early steps are taken to preserve our Navy in\r\na very few years the United States will be the weakest nation upon the\r\nocean, of all great powers. With an energetic, progressive, business\r\npeople like ours, penetrating and forming business relations with every\r\npart of the known world, a navy strong enough to command the respect of\r\nour flag abroad is necessary for the full protection of their rights.\r\n\r\nI recommend careful consideration by Congress of the recommendations\r\nmade by the Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nPOST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Postmaster-General furnishes a full and\r\nsatisfactory exhibit of the operations of the Post-Office Department\r\nduring the year. The ordinary revenues of the Department for the\r\nfiscal year ending June 30, 1872, amounted to $21,915,426.37, and the\r\nexpenditures to $26,658,192.31. Compared with the previous fiscal year\r\nthe increase of revenue was $1,878,330.95, or 9.37 per cent, and the\r\nincrease of expenditures $2,268,088.23, or 9.29 per cent. Adding to the\r\nordinary revenues the annual appropriation of $700,000 for free matter\r\nand the amounts paid to the subsidized mail steamship lines from special\r\nappropriations, the deficiency paid out of the General Treasury was\r\n$3,317,765.94, an excess of $389,707.28 over the deficiency for the\r\nyear 1871.\r\n\r\nOther interesting statistical information relating to our rapidly\r\nextending postal service is furnished in this report. The total length\r\nof railroad mail routes on the 30th of June, 1872, was 57,911 miles,\r\n8,077 additional miles of such service having been put into operation\r\nduring the year. Eight new lines of railway post-offices have been\r\nestablished, with an aggregate length of 2,909 miles. The number of\r\nletters exchanged in the mails with foreign countries was 24,362,500, an\r\nincrease of 4,066,502, or 20 per cent, Over the number in 1871; and the\r\npostage thereon amounted to $1,871,257.25. The total weight of the mails\r\nexchanged with European countries exceeded 820 tons. The cost of the\r\nUnited States transatlantic mail steamship service was $220,301.70.\r\nThe total cost of the United States ocean steamship service, including\r\nthe amounts paid to the subsidized lines of mail steamers, was\r\n$1,027,020.97.\r\n\r\nThe following are the only steamship lines now receiving subsidies for\r\nmail service under special acts of Congress: The Pacific Mail Steamship\r\nCompany receive $500,000 per annum for conveying a monthly mail between\r\nSan Francisco, Japan, and China, which will be increased to $1,000,000\r\nper annum for a semimonthly mail on and after October 1, 1873; the\r\nUnited States and Brazil Mail Steamship Company receive $150,000 per\r\nannum for conveying a monthly mail between New York and Rio de Janeiro,\r\nBrazil; and the California, Oregon and Mexican Steamship Company receive\r\n$75,000 per annum for conveying a monthly mail between San Francisco and\r\nHonolulu (Hawaiian Islands), making the total amount of mail steamship\r\nsubsidies at present $725,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nOur postal communications with all parts of the civilized world have\r\nbeen placed upon a most advantageous footing by the improved postal\r\nconventions and arrangements recently concluded with the leading\r\ncommercial countries of Europe and America, and the gratifying statement\r\nis made that with the conclusion of a satisfactory convention with\r\nFrance, the details of which have been definitely agreed to by the head\r\nof the French postal department, subject to the approval of the minister\r\nof finance, little remains to be accomplished by treaty for some time to\r\ncome with respect either to reduction of rates or improved facilities of\r\npostal intercourse.\r\n\r\nYour favorable consideration is respectfully invited to the\r\nrecommendations made by the Postmaster-General for an increase of\r\nservice from monthly to semimonthly trips on the mail steamship route\r\nto Brazil; for a subsidy in aid of the establishment of an American line\r\nof mail steamers between San Francisco, New Zealand, and Australia; for\r\nthe establishment of post-office savings banks, and for the increase of\r\nthe salaries of the heads of bureaus. I have heretofore recommended the\r\nabolition of the franking privilege, and see no reason now for changing\r\nmy views on that subject. It not having been favorably regarded by\r\nCongress, however, I now suggest a modification of that privilege to\r\ncorrect its glaring and costly abuses. I would recommend also the\r\nappointment of a committee or commission to take into consideration the\r\nbest method (equitable to private corporations who have invested their\r\ntime and capital in the establishment of telegraph lines) of acquiring\r\nthe title to all telegraph lines now in operation, and of connecting\r\nthis service with the postal service of the nation. It is not probable\r\nthat this subject could receive the proper consideration during the\r\nlimits of a short session of Congress, but it may be initiated, so that\r\nfuture action may be fair to the Government and to private parties\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nThere are but three lines of ocean steamers--namely, the Pacific\r\nMail Steamship Company, between San Francisco, China, and Japan, with\r\nprovision made for semimonthly service after October 1, 1873; the United\r\nStates and Brazil line, monthly; and the California, New Zealand, and\r\nAustralian line, monthly--plying between the United States and foreign\r\nports, and owned and operated under our flag. I earnestly recommend that\r\nsuch liberal contracts for carrying the mails be authorized with these\r\nlines as will insure their continuance.\r\n\r\nIf the expediency of extending the aid of Government to lines of\r\nsteamers which hitherto have not received it should be deemed worthy of\r\nthe consideration of Congress, political and commercial objects make it\r\nadvisable to bestow such aid on a line under our flag between Panama and\r\nthe western South American ports. By this means much trade now diverted\r\nto other countries might be brought to us, to the mutual advantage of\r\nthis country and those lying in that quarter of the continent of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury will show an alarming\r\nfalling off in our carrying trade for the last ten or twelve years, and\r\neven for the past year. I do not believe that public treasure can be\r\nbetter expended in the interest of the whole people than in trying to\r\nrecover this trade. An expenditure of $5,000,000 per annum for the next\r\nfive years, if it would restore to us our proportion of the carrying\r\ntrade of the world, would be profitably expended.\r\n\r\nThe price of labor in Europe has so much enhanced within the last few\r\nyears that the cost of building and operating ocean steamers in the\r\nUnited States is not so much greater than in Europe; and I believe the\r\ntime has arrived for Congress to take this subject into serious\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nDetailed statements of the disbursements through the Department of\r\nJustice will be furnished by the report of the Attorney-General, and\r\nthough these have been somewhat increased by the recent acts of Congress\r\n\"to enforce the rights of citizens of the United States to vote in the\r\nseveral States of the Union,\" and \"to enforce the provisions of the\r\nfourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States,\" and the\r\namendments thereto, I can not question the necessity and salutary effect\r\nof those enactments. Reckless and lawless men, I regret to say, have\r\nassociated themselves together in some localities to deprive other\r\ncitizens of those rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, and to that end have committed deeds of blood and\r\nviolence; but the prosecution and punishment of many of these persons\r\nhave tended greatly to the repression of such disorders. I do not doubt\r\nthat a great majority of the people in all parts of the country favor\r\nthe full enjoyment by all classes of persons of those rights to which\r\nthey are entitled under the Constitution and laws, and I invoke the\r\naid and influence of all good citizens to prevent organizations whose\r\nobjects are by unlawful means to interfere with those rights. I look\r\nwith confidence to the time, not far distant, when the obvious\r\nadvantages of good order and peace will induce an abandonment of all\r\ncombinations prohibited by the acts referred to, and when it will be\r\nunnecessary to carry on prosecutions or inflict punishment to protect\r\ncitizens from the lawless doings of such combinations.\r\n\r\nApplications have been made to me to pardon persons convicted of a\r\nviolation of said acts, upon the ground that clemency in such cases\r\nwould tend to tranquilize the public mind, and to test the virtue of\r\nthat policy I am disposed, as far as my sense of justice will permit,\r\nto give to these applications a favorable consideration; but any\r\naction thereon is not to be construed as indicating any change in\r\nmy determination to enforce with vigor such acts so long as the\r\nconspiracies and combinations therein named disturb the peace of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted, and is regretted by no one more than myself,\r\nthat a necessity has ever existed to execute the \"enforcement act.\" No\r\none can desire more than I that the necessity of applying it may never\r\nagain be demanded.\r\n\r\nINTERIOR DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior reports satisfactory improvement and\r\nprogress in each of the several bureaus under the control of the\r\nInterior Department. They are all in excellent condition. The work which\r\nin some of them for some years has been in arrears has been brought down\r\nto a recent date, and in all the current business is being promptly\r\ndispatched.\r\n\r\nINDIANS.\r\n\r\nThe policy which was adopted at the beginning of this Administration\r\nwith regard to the management of the Indians has been as successful\r\nas its most ardent friends anticipated within so short a time. It has\r\nreduced the expense of their management; decreased their forays upon\r\nthe white settlements; tended to give the largest opportunity for\r\nthe extension of the great railways through the public domain and the\r\npushing of settlements into more remote districts of the country, and at\r\nthe same time improved the condition of the Indians. The policy will be\r\nmaintained without any change excepting such as further experience may\r\nshow to be necessary to render it more efficient.\r\n\r\nThe subject of converting the so-called Indian Territory south of Kansas\r\ninto a home for the Indian, and erecting therein a Territorial form of\r\ngovernment, is one of great importance as a complement of the existing\r\nIndian policy. The question of removal to that Territory has within the\r\npast year been presented to many of the tribes resident upon other and\r\nless desirable portions of the public domain, and has generally been\r\nreceived by them with favor. As a preliminary step to the organization\r\nof such a Territory, it will be necessary to confine the Indians now\r\nresident therein to farms of proper size, which should be secured to\r\nthem in fee; the residue to be used for the settlement of other friendly\r\nIndians. Efforts will be made in the immediate future to induce the\r\nremoval of as many peaceably disposed Indians to the Indian Territory as\r\ncan be settled properly without disturbing the harmony of those already\r\nthere. There is no other location now available where a people who are\r\nendeavoring to acquire a knowledge of pastoral and agricultural pursuits\r\ncan be as well accommodated as upon the unoccupied lands in the Indian\r\nTerritory. A Territorial government should, however, protect the Indians\r\nfrom the inroads of whites for a term of years, until they become\r\nsufficiently advanced in the arts and civilization to guard their own\r\nrights, and from the disposal of the lands held by them for the same\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nLANDS.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year there were disposed of out of the public\r\nlands 11,864,975 acres, a quantity greater by 1,099,270 acres than was\r\ndisposed of the previous year. Of this amount 1,370,320 acres were\r\nsold for cash, 389,460 acres located with military warrants, 4,671,332\r\nacres taken for homesteads, 693,613 acres located with college scrip,\r\n3,554,887 acres granted to railroads, 465,347 acres granted to wagon\r\nroads, 714,255 acres given to States as swamp land, 5,760 acres located\r\nby Indian scrip. The cash receipts from all sources in the Land Office\r\namounted to $3,218,100. During the same period 22,016,608 acres of\r\nthe public lands were surveyed, which, added to the quantity before\r\nsurveyed, amounts to 583,364,780 acres, leaving 1,257,633,628 acres\r\nof the public lands still unsurveyed.\r\n\r\nThe reports from the subordinates of the Land Office contain interesting\r\ninformation in regard to their respective districts. They uniformly\r\nmention the fruitfulness of the soil during the past season and the\r\nincreased yields of all kinds of produce. Even in those States and\r\nTerritories where mining is the principal business agricultural products\r\nhave exceeded the local demand, and liberal shipments have been made to\r\ndistant points.\r\n\r\nPATENTS.\r\n\r\nDuring the year ending September 30, 1872, there were issued from the\r\nPatent Office 13,626 patents, 233 extensions, and 556 certificates and\r\nregistries of trade-marks. During the same time 19,587 applications for\r\npatents, including reissues and designs, have been received and 3,100\r\ncaveats filed. The fees received during the same period amounted to\r\n$700,954.86, and the total expenditures to $623,553.90, making the net\r\nreceipts over the expenditures $77,400.96.\r\n\r\nSince 1836 200,000 applications for patents have been filed and\r\nabout 133,000 patents issued. The office is being conducted under the\r\nsame laws and general organization as were adopted at its original\r\ninauguration, when only from 100 to 500 applications were made per\r\nannum. The Commissioner shows that the office has outgrown the original\r\nplan, and that a new organization has become necessary. This subject was\r\npresented to Congress in a special communication in February last, with\r\nmy approval and the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, and the\r\nsuggestions contained in said communication were embraced in the bill\r\nthat was reported to the House by the Committee on Patents at the last\r\nsession. The subject of the reorganization of the Patent Office, as\r\ncontemplated by the bill referred to, is one of such importance to the\r\nindustrial interests of the country that I commend it to the attention\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner also treats the subject of the separation of the\r\nPatent Office from the Department of the Interior. This subject is also\r\nembraced in the bill heretofore referred to. The Commissioner complains\r\nof the want of room for the model gallery and for the working force and\r\nnecessary files of the office. It is impossible to transact the business\r\nof the office properly without more room in which to arrange files and\r\ndrawings, that must be consulted hourly in the transaction of business.\r\nThe whole of the Patent Office building will soon be needed, if it is\r\nnot already, for the accommodation of the business of the Patent Office.\r\n\r\nPENSIONS.\r\n\r\nThe amount paid for pensions in the last fiscal year was $30,169,340, an\r\namount larger by $3,708,434 than was paid during the preceding year. Of\r\nthis amount $2,313,409 were paid under the act of Congress of February\r\n17, 1871, to survivors of the War of 1812. The annual increase of\r\npensions by the legislation of Congress has more than kept pace with the\r\nnatural yearly losses from the rolls. The act of Congress of June 8,\r\n1872, has added an estimated amount of $750,000 per annum to the rolls,\r\nwithout increasing the number of pensioners. We can not, therefore, look\r\nfor any substantial decrease in the expenditures of this Department for\r\nsome time to come, or so long as Congress continues to so change the\r\nrates of pension.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of soldiers enlisted in the War of the Rebellion was\r\n2,688,523. The total number of claims for invalid pensions is 176,000,\r\nbeing but 6 per cent of the whole number of enlisted men. The total\r\nnumber of claims on hand at the beginning of the year was 91,689; the\r\nnumber received during the year was 26,574; the number disposed of was\r\n39,178, making a net gain of 12,604. The number of claims now on file\r\nis 79,085.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of June, 1872, there were on the rolls the names of 95,405\r\ninvalid military pensioners, 113,518 widows, orphans, and dependent\r\nrelatives, making an aggregate of 208,923 army pensioners. At the same\r\ntime there were on the rolls the names of 1,449 navy pensioners and\r\n1,730 widows, orphans, and dependent relatives, making the whole number\r\nof naval pensioners 3,179. There have been received since the passage of\r\nthe act to provide pensions for the survivors of the War of 1812 36,551\r\napplications, prior to June 30, 1872. Of these there were allowed during\r\nthe last fiscal year 20,126 claims; 4,845 were rejected during the year,\r\nleaving 11,580 claims pending at that date. The number of pensions of\r\nall classes granted during the last fiscal year was 33,838. During that\r\nperiod there were dropped from the rolls, for various causes, 9,104\r\nnames, leaving a grand total of 232,229 pensioners on the rolls on the\r\n30th of June, 1872.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that the claims for pensions on account of the War of 1812\r\nwill all be disposed of by the 1st of May, 1873. It is estimated that\r\n$30,480,000 will be required for the pension service during the next\r\nfiscal year.\r\n\r\nTHE CENSUS.\r\n\r\nThe Ninth Census is about completed. Its early completion is a subject\r\nof congratulation, inasmuch as the use to be made of the statistics\r\ntherein contained depends very greatly on the promptitude of\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior recommends that a census be taken in 1875,\r\nwhich recommendation should receive the early attention of Congress. The\r\ninterval at present established between the Federal census is so long\r\nthat the information obtained at the decennial period as to the material\r\ncondition, wants, and resources of the nation is of little practical\r\nvalue after the expiration of the first half of that period. It would\r\nprobably obviate the constitutional provision regarding the decennial\r\ncensus if a census taken in 1875 should be divested of all political\r\ncharacter and no reapportionment of Congressional representation be made\r\nunder it. Such a census, coming, as it would, in the last year of the\r\nfirst century of our national existence, would furnish a noble monument\r\nof the progress of the United States during that century.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\nThe rapidly increasing interest in education is a most encouraging\r\nfeature in the current history of the country, and it is no doubt true\r\nthat this is due in a great measure to the efforts of the Bureau of\r\nEducation. That office is continually receiving evidences, which\r\nabundantly prove its efficiency, from the various institutions of\r\nlearning and educators of all kinds throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner contains a vast amount of educational\r\ndetails of great interest. The bill now pending before Congress,\r\nproviding for the appropriation of the net proceeds of the sales of\r\npublic lands for educational purposes, to aid the States in the general\r\neducation of their rising generation, is a measure of such great\r\nimportance to our real progress and is so unanimously approved by the\r\nleading friends of education that I commend it to the favorable\r\nattention of Congress.\r\n\r\nTERRITORIES.\r\n\r\nAffairs in the Territories are generally satisfactory. The energy\r\nand business capacity of the pioneers who are settling up the vast\r\ndomains not yet incorporated into States are keeping pace in internal\r\nimprovements and civil government with the older communities. In but one\r\nof them (Utah) is the condition of affairs unsatisfactory, except so far\r\nas the quiet of the citizen may be disturbed by real or imaginary danger\r\nof Indian hostilities. It has seemed to be the policy of the legislature\r\nof Utah to evade all responsibility to the Government of the United\r\nStates, and even to hold a position in hostility to it.\r\n\r\nI recommend a careful revision of the present laws of the Territory by\r\nCongress, and the enactment of such a law (the one proposed in Congress\r\nat its last session, for instance, or something similar to it) as will\r\nsecure peace, the equality of all citizens before the law, and the\r\nultimate extinguishment of polygamy.\r\n\r\nSince the establishment of a Territorial government for the District of\r\nColumbia the improvement of the condition of the city of Washington and\r\nsurroundings and the increased prosperity of the citizens are observable\r\nto the most casual visitor. The nation, being a large owner of property\r\nin the city, should bear, with the citizens of the District, its just\r\nshare of the expense of these improvements.\r\n\r\nI recommend, therefore, an appropriation to reimburse the citizens for\r\nthe work done by them along and in front of public grounds during the\r\npast year, and liberal appropriations in order that the improvements and\r\nembellishments of the public buildings and grounds may keep pace with\r\nthe improvements made by the Territorial authorities.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Agriculture gives a very full and\r\ninteresting account of the several divisions of that Department--the\r\nhorticultural, agricultural, statistical, entomological, and\r\nchemical--and the benefits conferred by each upon the agricultural\r\ninterests of the country. The whole report is a complete history, in\r\ndetail, of the workings of that Department in all its branches, showing\r\nthe manner in which the farmer, merchant, and miner is informed, and\r\nthe extent to which he is aided in his pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner makes one recommendation--that measures be taken by\r\nCongress to protect and induce the planting of forests--and suggests\r\nthat no part of the public lands should be disposed of without the\r\ncondition that one-tenth of it should be reserved in timber where it\r\nexists, and where it does not exist inducements should be offered for\r\nplanting it.\r\n\r\nCENTENNIAL CELEBRATION.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the terms of the act of Congress approved March 3,\r\n1871, providing for the celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of\r\nAmerican independence, a commission has been organized, consisting of\r\ntwo members from each of the States and Territories. This commission\r\nhas held two sessions, and has made satisfactory progress in the\r\norganization and in the initiatory steps necessary for carrying out\r\nthe provisions of the act, and for executing also the provisions of\r\nthe act of June 1, 1872, creating a centennial board of finance.\r\nA preliminary report of progress has been received from the president\r\nof the commission, and is herewith transmitted. It will be the duty\r\nof the commission at your coming session to transmit a full report of\r\nthe progress made, and to lay before you the details relating to the\r\nexhibition of American and foreign arts, products, and manufactures,\r\nwhich by the terms of the act is to be held under the auspices of the\r\nGovernment of the United States in the city of Philadelphia in the\r\nyear 1876.\r\n\r\nThis celebration will be looked forward to by American citizens with\r\ngreat interest, as marking a century of greater progress and prosperity\r\nthan is recorded in the history of any other nation, and as serving a\r\nfurther good purpose in bringing together on our soil peoples of all\r\nthe commercial nations of the earth in a manner calculated to insure\r\ninternational good feeling.\r\n\r\nCIVIL SERVICE.\r\n\r\nAn earnest desire has been felt to correct abuses which have grown\r\nup in the civil service of the country through the defective method\r\nof making appointments to office. Heretofore Federal offices have been\r\nregarded too much as the reward of political services. Under authority\r\nof Congress rules have been established to regulate the tenure of office\r\nand the mode of appointments. It can not be expected that any system\r\nof rules can be entirely effective and prove a perfect remedy for the\r\nexisting evils until they have been thoroughly tested by actual practice\r\nand amended according to the requirements of the service. During my\r\nterm of office it shall be my earnest endeavor to so apply the rules\r\nas to secure the greatest possible reform in the civil service of the\r\nGovernment, but it will require the direct action of Congress to render\r\nthe enforcement of the system binding upon my successors; and I hope\r\nthat the experience of the past year, together with appropriate\r\nlegislation by Congress, may reach a satisfactory solution of this\r\nquestion and secure to the public service for all time a practical\r\nmethod of obtaining faithful and efficient officers and employees.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 2, 1872_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report, dated the 2d instant, received from the\r\nSecretary of State, supplementary to the report submitted by him under\r\ndate of the 8th of November, 1871, with reference to the expenditures\r\nauthorized by the fourth and fifth paragraphs of the act of March 3,\r\n1871, and by the act of May 18, 1872, making appropriations for the\r\nincreased expenses and compensation for extraordinary services of\r\ncertain diplomatic and consular officers of the United States by reason\r\nof the late war between France and Prussia.

Sometimes the power given to the\r\nTerritorial legislatures has been somewhat larger and sometimes somewhat\r\nsmaller than the powers generally conferred. Never, however, have powers\r\nbeen given to a Territorial legislature inconsistent with the idea that\r\nthe general judicature of the Territory was to be under the direct\r\nsupervision of the National Government.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the organic law creating the Territory of Utah, passed\r\nSeptember 9, 1850, provided for the appointment of a supreme court, the\r\njudges of which are judges of the district courts, a clerk, marshal, and\r\nan attorney, and to these Federal officers is confided jurisdiction in\r\nall important matters; but, as decided recently by the Supreme Court,\r\nthe act requires jurors to serve in these courts to be selected in such\r\nmanner as the Territorial legislature sees fit to prescribe. It has\r\nundoubtedly been the desire of Congress, so far as the same might be\r\ncompatible with the supervisory control of the Territorial government,\r\nto leave the minor details connected with the administration of law to\r\nregulation by local authority; but such a desire ought not to govern\r\nwhen the effect will be, owing to the peculiar circumstances of the\r\ncase, to produce a conflict between the Federal and the Territorial\r\nauthorities, or to impede the enforcement of law, or in any way to\r\nendanger the peace and good order of the Territory.\r\n\r\nEvidently it was never intended to intrust the Territorial legislature\r\nwith power which would enable it, by creating judicatures of its\r\nown or increasing the jurisdiction of courts appointed by Territorial\r\nauthority, although recognized by Congress, to take the administration\r\nof the law out of the hands of the judges appointed by the President\r\nor to interfere with their action.\r\n\r\nSeveral years of unhappy experience make it apparent that in both of\r\nthese respects the Territory of Utah requires special legislation by\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion in that Territory, produced by circumstances too\r\nnotorious to require further notice, makes it necessary, in my opinion,\r\nin order to prevent the miscarriage of justice and to maintain\r\nthe supremacy of the laws of the United States and of the Federal\r\nGovernment, to provide that the selection of grand and petit jurors for\r\nthe district courts, if not put under the control of Federal officers,\r\nshall be placed in the hands of persons entirely independent of those\r\nwho are determined not to enforce any act of Congress obnoxious to them,\r\nand also to pass some act which shall deprive the probate courts, or any\r\ncourt created by the Territorial legislature, of any power to interfere\r\nwith or impede the action of the courts held by the United States\r\njudges.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that so long as Congress leaves the selection of jurors\r\nto the local authorities it will be futile to make any effort to enforce\r\nlaws not acceptable to a majority of the people of the Territory, or\r\nwhich interfere with local prejudices or provide for the punishment of\r\npolygamy or any of its affiliated vices or crimes.\r\n\r\nI presume that Congress, in passing upon the subject, will provide all\r\nreasonable and proper safeguards to secure honest and impartial jurors,\r\nwhose verdicts will command confidence and be a guaranty of equal\r\nprotection to all good and law-abiding citizens, and at the same time\r\nmake it understood that crime can not be committed with impunity.\r\n\r\nI have before said that while the laws creating the several Territories\r\nhave generally contained uniform provisions in respect to the judiciary,\r\nyet Congress has occasionally varied these provisions in minor details,\r\nas the circumstances of the Territory affected seemed to demand;\r\nand in creating the Territory of Utah Congress evidently thought that\r\ncircumstances there might require judicial remedies not necessary in\r\nother Territories, for by section 9 of the act creating that Territory\r\nit is provided that a writ of error may be brought from the decision\r\nof any judge of the supreme or district court of the Territory to the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States upon any writ of _habeas corpus_\r\ninvolving the question of personal freedom--a provision never inserted\r\nin any other Territorial act except that creating the Territory of\r\nNew Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary provision shows that Congress intended to mold\r\nthe organic law to the peculiar necessities of the Territory, and the\r\nlegislation which I now recommend is in full harmony with the precedent\r\nthus established.\r\n\r\nI am advised that United States courts in Utah have been greatly\r\nembarrassed by the action of the Territorial legislature in\r\nconferring criminal jurisdiction and the power to issue writs of _habeas\r\ncorpus_ on the probate courts in the Territory, and by their consequent\r\ninterference with the administration of justice. Manifestly the\r\nlegislature of the Territory can not give to any court whatever the\r\npower to discharge by _habeas corpus_ persons held by or under process\r\nfrom the courts created by Congress, but complaint is made that persons\r\nso held have been discharged in that way by the probate courts. I can\r\nnot doubt that Congress will agree with me that such a state of things\r\nought not longer to be tolerated, and that no class of persons anywhere\r\nshould be allowed to treat the laws of the United States with open\r\ndefiance and contempt.\r\n\r\nApprehensions are entertained that if Congress adjourns without any\r\naction upon this subject turbulence and disorder will follow, rendering\r\nmilitary interference necessary--a result I should greatly deprecate;\r\nand in view of this and other obvious considerations, I earnestly\r\nrecommend that Congress, at the present session, pass some act which\r\nwill enable the district courts of Utah to proceed with independence\r\nand efficiency in the administration of law and justice.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 17, 1873_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn answer to a resolution of the Senate of the 14th instant, adopted\r\nin executive session, requiring of the Secretary of State information\r\ntouching the business before the late mixed commission on claims under\r\nthe convention with Mexico, I transmit a report from the Secretary of\r\nState and the papers by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 24, 1873_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nIn my annual message to Congress at the opening of the second session of\r\nthe present Congress, in December, 1871, I recommended the legislation\r\nnecessary on the part of the United States to bring into operation the\r\narticles of the treaty of Washington of May 8, 1871, relative to the\r\nfisheries and to other matters touching the relations of the United\r\nStates toward the British North American possessions, to become\r\noperative so soon as the proper legislation should be had on the part of\r\nGreat Britain and its possessions. That legislation on the part of Great\r\nBritain and its possessions had not then been had.\r\n\r\nHaving, prior to the meeting of Congress in December last, received\r\nofficial information of the consideration by Great Britain and its\r\npossessions of the legislation necessary on their part to bring those\r\narticles into operation, I communicated that fact to Congress in my\r\nannual message at the opening of the present session, and renewed the\r\nrecommendation for your early adoption of the legislation in the same\r\ndirection necessary on the part of this Government.\r\n\r\nThe near approach of the end of the session induces me again to urgently\r\ncall your attention to the importance of this legislation on the part of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the treaty of Washington resulted from an\r\noverture on the part of Great Britain to treat with reference to the\r\nfisheries on the coast of Her Majesty's possessions in North America\r\nand other questions between them affecting the relations of the United\r\nStates toward these possessions. To this overture a reply was made on\r\nthe part of this Government that while appreciating the importance of\r\na friendly and complete understanding between the two Governments with\r\nreference to the subject specially suggested by the British Government,\r\nit was thought that the removal of the differences growing out of\r\nwhat were generically known as the Alabama claims was essential to\r\nthe restoration of cordial and amicable relations between the two\r\nGovernments, and the assent of this Government to treat on the subject\r\nof the fisheries was made dependent on the assent of Great Britain\r\nto allow the joint commission which it had prepared on the questions\r\nsuggested by that Government to treat also and settle the differences\r\ngrowing out of the Alabama claims.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain assented to this, and the treaty of Washington proposed\r\na settlement of both classes of questions.\r\n\r\nThose relating to the Alabama claims and to the northwestern water\r\nboundary, commonly known as the San Juan question, have been disposed\r\nof in pursuance of the terms of the treaty.\r\n\r\nThose relating to the fisheries were made by the terms of the treaty to\r\ndepend upon the legislation which the constitutions of the respective\r\nGovernments made necessary to carry those provisions into effect.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain and her possessions have on their part enacted the\r\nnecessary legislation.\r\n\r\nThis Government is now enjoying the advantages of those provisions of\r\nthe treaty which were the result of the condition of its assent to treat\r\nupon the questions which Great Britain had submitted.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal at Geneva has made an award in favor of the United States\r\non the Alabama claims, and His Majesty the Emperor of Germany has\r\ndecided in favor of the contention of the United States on the\r\nnorthwestern boundary line.\r\n\r\nI can not urge too strongly the importance of your early consideration\r\nof the legislation that may be necessary on the part of this Government.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the claim that Great Britain may have upon the good faith\r\nof this Government to consider the legislation necessary in connection\r\nwith the questions which that Government presented as the subject of a\r\nnegotiation which has resulted so favorably to this Government upon the\r\nother questions in which the United States felt so much interest, it is\r\nof importance that the rights of the American fishermen, as provided\r\nfor under the treaty, should be determined before the now approaching\r\nfishing season opens, and that the serious difficulties to the fishing\r\ninterests and the grave questions between the two Governments that may\r\narise therefrom be averted.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 25, 1873_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nYour attention is respectfully invited to the condition of affairs in\r\nthe State of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nGrave complications have grown out of the election there on the 6th of\r\nNovember last, chiefly attributable, it is believed, to an organized\r\nattempt on the part of those controlling the election officers and\r\nreturns to defeat in that election the will of a majority of the\r\nelectors of the State. Different persons are claiming the executive\r\noffices, two bodies are claiming to be the legislative assembly of the\r\nState, and the confusion and uncertainty produced in this way fall with\r\nparalyzing effect upon all its interests.\r\n\r\nControversy arose as soon as the election occurred over its proceedings\r\nand results, but I declined to interfere until suit involving this\r\ncontroversy to some extent was brought in the circuit court of the\r\nUnited States under and by virtue of the act of May 31, 1870, entitled\r\n\"An act to enforce the right of citizens of the United States to vote\r\nin the several States of the Union, and for other purposes.\"\r\n\r\nFinding that resistance was made to judicial process in that suit,\r\nwithout any opportunity, and, in my judgment, without any right, to\r\nreview the judgment of the court upon the jurisdictional or other\r\nquestions arising in the case, I directed the United States marshal to\r\nenforce such process and to use, if necessary, troops for that purpose,\r\nin accordance with the thirteenth section of said act, which provides\r\nthat \"it shall be lawful for the President of the United States to\r\nemploy such part of the land or naval forces of the United States or of\r\nthe militia as shall be necessary to aid in the execution of judicial\r\nprocess under this act.\"\r\n\r\nTwo bodies of persons claimed to be the returning board for the State,\r\nand the circuit court in that case decided that the one to which Lynch\r\nbelonged, usually designated by his name, was the lawful returning\r\nboard; and this decision has been repeatedly affirmed by the district\r\nand supreme courts of the State. Having no opportunity or power to\r\ncanvass the votes, and the exigencies of the case demanding an immediate\r\ndecision, I conceived it to be my duty to recognize those persons as\r\nelected who received and held their credentials to office from what then\r\nappeared to me to be, and has since been decided by the supreme court\r\nof the State to be, the legal returning board.\r\n\r\nConformably to the decisions of this board, a full set of State officers\r\nhas been installed and a legislative assembly organized, constituting,\r\nif not a _de jure_, at least a _de facto_ government, which, since\r\nsome time in December last, has had possession of the offices and been\r\nexercising the usual powers of government; but opposed to this has been\r\nanother government claiming to control the affairs of the State, and\r\nwhich has to some extent been _pro forma_ organized.\r\n\r\nRecent investigation into said election has developed so many frauds\r\nand forgeries as to make it doubtful what candidates received a majority\r\nof the votes actually cast, and in view of these facts a variety of\r\naction has been proposed. I have no specific recommendation to make\r\nupon the subject, but if there is any practicable way of removing these\r\ndifficulties by legislation, then I earnestly request that such action\r\nmay be taken at the present session of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt seems advisable that I should state now what course I shall feel\r\nbound to pursue in reference to the matter in the event of no action by\r\nCongress at this time. Subject to any satisfactory arrangement that may\r\nbe made by the parties to the controversy, which of all things is the\r\nmost desirable, it will be my duty, so far as it may be necessary for\r\nme to act, to adhere to that government heretofore recognized by me.\r\nTo judge of the election and qualifications of its members is the\r\nexclusive province of the Senate, as it is also the exclusive province\r\nof the House to judge of the election and qualifications of its members;\r\nbut as to State offices, filled and held under State laws, the decisions\r\nof the State judicial tribunals, it seems to me, ought to be respected.\r\n\r\nI am extremely anxious to avoid any appearance of undue interference\r\nin State affairs, and if Congress differs from me as to what ought\r\nto be done I respectfully urge its immediate decision to that effect;\r\notherwise I shall feel obliged, as far as I can by the exercise of\r\nlegitimate authority, to put an end to the unhappy controversy which\r\ndisturbs the peace and prostrates the business of Louisiana, by the\r\nrecognition and support of that government which is recognized and\r\nupheld by the courts of the State.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 6, 1873_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI return herewith, for the further consideration of Congress, House bill\r\nNo. 2291, entitled \"An act for the relief of Edmund Jussen,\" to which\r\nI have not appended my approval, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nThe bill directs the accounting officers to transfer from Mr. Jussen's\r\naccount to that of his successor all indebtedness arising from the\r\nloss or destruction or nontaking of warehouse bonds on certain spirits\r\ndestroyed by fire. This provision would be wholly ineffective in so far\r\nas it proposes to increase the liability of Mr. Jussen's successor, he\r\nhaving been appointed subsequently to the destruction of the spirits.\r\nIt might operate to relieve Mr. Jussen, but it seems probable that\r\nhe is already relieved by the act of May 27, 1872, passed since the\r\nintroduction of this bill. That act provides for the rebatement of taxes\r\non distilled spirits destroyed by fire, except in cases where the owners\r\nof such spirits may be indemnified against tax by a valid claim of\r\ninsurance. The relief of the taxpayers of course includes the relief\r\nof collectors from liability caused by failure to take bonds. It does\r\nnot appear whether there was any insurance in this case. If not, the\r\napplicant is already relieved; but if there was an insurance the effect\r\nof this bill, if it became a law, might be to except Mr. Jussen from the\r\noperation of the general rule established by the proviso of the act of\r\nMay 27, 1872. If such exception be proper, it should not be confined to\r\nan individual case, but extended to all. If there was an insurance, this\r\nbill would relieve Mr, Jussen from the liability with which it is very\r\ndoubtful if his successor could be legally charged, or with which he\r\nought to be charged.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 22, 1873_.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\nSIR: I herewith return to the House of Representatives, in which it\r\noriginated, H.R. No. 630, entitled \"An act in relation to new trials\r\nin the Court of Claims,\" without my approval.\r\n\r\nThe object of the bill is to reduce from two years to six months the\r\ntime in which a new trial, upon motion of the United States, may be\r\ngranted in the Court of Claims.\r\n\r\nGreat difficulties are now experienced in contesting fraudulent and\r\nunjust claims against the Government prosecuted in said court, and the\r\neffect of this bill, if it becomes a law, will be to increase those\r\ndifficulties. Persons sue in this court generally with the advantage\r\nof a personal knowledge of the circumstances of the case, and are\r\nprompted by personal interest to activity in its preparation for trial,\r\nwhich consists sometimes in the production of false testimony and the\r\nsuppression of the truth, while the United States are dependent for\r\ndefense upon such inquiries as the officers of the Government, generally\r\nstrangers to the transaction, are enabled to make, not infrequently in\r\nremote parts of the country and among those not averse to depredations\r\nupon the National Treasury. Instances have occurred where the existing\r\nopportunities for a new trial have enabled the Government to discover\r\nand defeat claims that ought not to have been allowed, after judgments\r\nthereon had been rendered by the Court of Claims.\r\n\r\nBy referring to the act which it is proposed to modify it will be seen\r\nthat the payment of judgments recovered is not necessarily suspended\r\nfor two years; but where the proofs are doubtful or suspicious the\r\nGovernment may appeal to the Supreme Court, and in the meantime may\r\navail itself of any discovery or revelation of new evidence touching\r\nthe facts of the case.\r\n\r\nI fail to see the necessity or advantages of the proposed change in\r\nthe law, and whatever may be the purposes of the bill, its effect,\r\nif passed, I am apprehensive will be to facilitate the prosecution of\r\nfraudulent claims against the United States. Believing that justice can\r\nand will be done to honest claimants in the Court of Claims as the law\r\nnow stands, and believing also that the proposed change in the law will\r\nremove a valuable safeguard to the Treasury, I must for these reasons\r\nrespectfully withhold my assent to the bill.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 29, 1873_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI have the honor to return herewith Senate bill No. 490, entitled\r\n\"An act for the relief of the East Tennessee University,\" without\r\nmy approval.\r\n\r\nThis claim, for which $18,500 are appropriated out of the moneys of the\r\nUnited States, arises in part for the destruction of property by troops\r\nin time of war, and therefore the same objections attach to it as were\r\nexpressed in my message of June 1, 1872, returning the Senate bill\r\nawarding $25,000 to J. Milton Best.\r\n\r\nIf the precedent is once established that the Government is liable for\r\nthe ravages of war, the end of demands upon the public Treasury can not\r\nbe forecast.\r\n\r\nThe loyalty of the people of the section in which the university\r\nis located, under circumstances of personal danger and trials, thus\r\nentitling them to the most favorable construction of the obligation of\r\nthe Government toward them, is admitted, and nothing but regard for my\r\nduty to the whole people, in opposing a principle which, if allowed,\r\nwill entail greater burdens upon the whole than the relief which will be\r\nafforded to a part by allowing this bill to become a law, could induce\r\nme to return it with objections.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the claims of these citizens to sympathy and the most\r\nfavorable consideration of their claims by the Government, I would\r\nheartily favor a donation of the amount appropriated by this bill for\r\ntheir relief.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 8, 1873_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI have the honor to return herewith House bill (H.R. 2852) entitled\r\n\"An act for the relief of James A. McCullah, late collector of the fifth\r\ndistrict of Missouri,\" without my approval, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nIt is provided in section 34 of the act of June 30, 1864, as amended by\r\nthe act of July 13, 1866, that it shall be proved to the satisfaction\r\nof the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that due diligence was used by\r\nthe collector, who shall certify the facts to the First Comptroller.\r\nThis bill, should it become a law, clearly excuses Mr. McCullah, late\r\ncollector, from showing that he used due diligence for the collection\r\nof the tax in question while the lists remained in his hands.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 11, 1873_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI return herewith without my approval Senate bill No. 161, entitled\r\n\"An act for the relief of those suffering from the destruction of salt\r\nworks near Manchester, Ky., pursuant to the order of Major-General\r\nCarlos Buell.\"\r\n\r\nAll the objections made by me to the bill for the relief of J. Milton\r\nBest, and also of the East Tennessee University, apply with equal force\r\nto this bill.\r\n\r\nAccording to the official report of Brigadier-General Craft, by whose\r\nimmediate command the property in question was destroyed, there was a\r\nlarge rebel force in the neighborhood, who were using the salt works and\r\nhad carried away a considerable quantity of salt, and were preparing to\r\ntake more as soon as the necessary transportation could be procured; and\r\nhe further states \"that the leaders of the rebellion calculated upon\r\ntheir supply of salt to come from these works,\" and that in his opinion\r\ntheir destruction was a military necessity. I understand him to say, in\r\neffect, that the salt works were captured from the rebels; that it was\r\nimpracticable to hold them, and that they were demolished so as to be of\r\nno further use to the enemy.\r\n\r\nI can not agree that the owners of property destroyed under such\r\ncircumstances are entitled to compensation therefor from the United\r\nStates. Whatever other view may be taken of the subject, it is\r\nincontrovertible that these salt works were destroyed by the Union Army\r\nwhile engaged in regular military operations, and that the sole object\r\nof their destruction was to weaken, cripple, or defeat the armies of the\r\nso-called Southern Confederacy.\r\n\r\nI am greatly apprehensive that the allowance of this claim could and\r\nwould be construed into the recognition of a principle binding the\r\nUnited States to pay for all property which their military forces\r\ndestroyed in the late war for the Union. No liability by the Government\r\nto pay for property destroyed by the Union forces in conducting a battle\r\nor siege has yet been claimed, but the precedent proposed by this bill\r\nleads directly and strongly in that direction, for it is difficult upon\r\nany ground of reason or justice to distinguish between a case of that\r\nkind and the one under consideration. Had General Craft and his command\r\ndestroyed the salt works by shelling out the enemy found in their actual\r\noccupancy, the case would not have been different in principle from the\r\none presented in this bill. What possible difference can it make in\r\nthe rights of owners or the obligations of the Government whether the\r\ndestruction was in driving the enemy out or in keeping them out of the\r\npossession of the salt works?\r\n\r\nThis bill does not present a case where private property is taken for\r\npublic use in any sense of the Constitution. It was not taken from the\r\nowners, but from the enemy; and it was not then used by the Government,\r\nbut destroyed. Its destruction was one of the casualties of war, and,\r\nthough not happening in actual conflict, was perhaps as disastrous to\r\nthe rebels as would have been a victory in battle.\r\n\r\nOwners of property destroyed to prevent the spread of a conflagration,\r\nas a general rule, are not entitled to compensation therefor; and for\r\nreasons equally strong the necessary destruction of property found in\r\nthe hands of the public enemy, and constituting a part of their military\r\nsupplies, does not entitle the owner to indemnity from the Government\r\nfor damages to him in that way.\r\n\r\nI fully appreciate the hardship of the case, and would be glad if my\r\nconvictions of duty allowed me to join in the proposed relief; but I can\r\nnot consent to the doctrine which is found in this bill, as it seems to\r\nme, by which the National Treasury is exposed to all claims for property\r\ninjured or destroyed by the armies of the United States in the late\r\nprotracted and destructive war in this country.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas objects of interest to the United States require that the Senate\r\nshould be convened at 12 o'clock on the 4th of March next, to receive\r\nand act upon such communications as may be made to it on the part of the\r\nExecutive:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Ulysses S.

By some it has been suggested\r\nthat there may be distinction made in case the office be with or without\r\nsalary or compensation. The city or town offices of the description\r\nreferred to, by whatever names they may be locally known, whether held\r\nby election or by appointment, and whether with or without salary or\r\ncompensation, are of the class which the Executive order intends not\r\nto be held by persons holding Federal offices.\r\n\r\nIt has been asked whether the order prohibits Federal officers from\r\nholding positions on boards of education, school committees, public\r\nlibraries, religious or eleemosynary institutions incorporated or\r\nestablished or sustained by State or municipal authority. Positions and\r\nservice on such boards or committees and professorships in colleges are\r\nnot regarded as \"offices\" within the contemplation of the Executive\r\norder, but as employments or service in which all good citizens may be\r\nengaged without incompatibility, and in many cases without necessary\r\ninterference with any position which they may hold under the Federal\r\nGovernment. Officers of the Federal Government may therefore engage in\r\nsuch service, provided the attention required by such employment does\r\nnot interfere with the regular and efficient discharge of the duties of\r\ntheir office under the Federal Government. The head of the Department\r\nunder whom the Federal office is held will in all cases be the sole\r\njudge whether or not the employment does thus interfere.\r\n\r\nThe question has also been asked with regard to officers of the\r\nState militia. Congress having exercised the power conferred by the\r\nConstitution to provide for organizing the militia, which is liable to\r\nbe called forth to be employed in the service of the United States, and\r\nis thus in some sense under the control of the General Government, and\r\nis, moreover, of the greatest value to the public, the Executive order\r\nof the 17th January is not considered as prohibiting Federal officers\r\nfrom being officers of the militia in the States and Territories.\r\n\r\nIt has been asked whether the order prohibits persons holding office\r\nunder the Federal Government being members of local or municipal fire\r\ndepartments; also whether it applies to mechanics employed by the day\r\nin the armories, arsenals, and navy-yards, etc., of the United States.\r\nUnpaid service in local or municipal fire departments is not regarded as\r\nan office within the intent of the Executive order, and may be performed\r\nby Federal officers, provided it does not interfere with the regular and\r\nefficient discharge of the duties of the Federal office, of which the\r\nhead of the Department under which the office is held will in each case\r\nbe the judge. Employment by the day as mechanics and laborers in the\r\narmories, arsenals, navy-yards, etc., does not constitute an office of\r\nany kind, and those thus employed are not within the contemplation of\r\nthe Executive order. Master workmen and others who hold appointments\r\nfrom the Government or from any Department, whether for a fixed time\r\nor at the pleasure of the appointing power, are embraced within the\r\noperation of the order.\r\n\r\nBy order of the President:\r\n\r\nHAMILTON FISH,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS: Under Providence I have been called a second time to\r\nact as Executive over this great nation. It has been my endeavor in the\r\npast to maintain all the laws, and, so far as lay in my power, to act\r\nfor the best interests of the whole people. My best efforts will be\r\ngiven in the same direction in the future, aided, I trust, by my four\r\nyears' experience in the office.\r\n\r\nWhen my first term of the office of Chief Executive began, the country\r\nhad not recovered from the effects of a great internal revolution, and\r\nthree of the former States of the Union had not been restored to their\r\nFederal relations.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me wise that no new questions should be raised so long as\r\nthat condition of affairs existed. Therefore the past four years, so far\r\nas I could control events, have been consumed in the effort to restore\r\nharmony, public credit, commerce, and all the arts of peace and\r\nprogress. It is my firm conviction that the civilized world is tending\r\ntoward republicanism, or government by the people through their chosen\r\nrepresentatives, and that our own great Republic is destined to be the\r\nguiding star to all others.\r\n\r\nUnder our Republic we support an army less than that of any European\r\npower of any standing and a navy less than that of either of at least\r\nfive of them. There could be no extension of territory on the continent\r\nwhich would call for an increase of this force, but rather might such\r\nextension enable us to diminish it.\r\n\r\nThe theory of government changes with general progress. Now that the\r\ntelegraph is made available for communicating thought, together with\r\nrapid transit by steam, all parts of a continent are made contiguous for\r\nall purposes of government, and communication between the extreme limits\r\nof the country made easier than it was throughout the old thirteen\r\nStates at the beginning of our national existence.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the late civil strife have been to free the slave and\r\nmake him a citizen. Yet he is not possessed of the civil rights which\r\ncitizenship should carry with it. This is wrong, and should be\r\ncorrected. To this correction I stand committed, so far as Executive\r\ninfluence can avail.\r\n\r\nSocial equality is not a subject to be legislated upon, nor shall I ask\r\nthat anything be done to advance the social status of the colored man,\r\nexcept to give him a fair chance to develop what there is good in him,\r\ngive him access to the schools, and when he travels let him feel assured\r\nthat his conduct will regulate the treatment and fare he will receive.\r\n\r\nThe States lately at war with the General Government are now happily\r\nrehabilitated, and no Executive control is exercised in any one of them\r\nthat would not be exercised in any other State under like circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn the first year of the past Administration the proposition came up for\r\nthe admission of Santo Domingo as a Territory of the Union. It was not\r\na question of my seeking, but was a proposition from the people of Santo\r\nDomingo, and which I entertained. I believe now, as I did then, that\r\nit was for the best interest of this country, for the people of Santo\r\nDomingo, and all concerned that the proposition should be received\r\nfavorably. It was, however, rejected constitutionally, and therefore\r\nthe subject was never brought up again by me.\r\n\r\nIn future, while I hold my present office, the subject of acquisition of\r\nterritory must have the support of the people before I will recommend\r\nany proposition looking to such acquisition. I say here, however, that\r\nI do not share in the apprehension held by many as to the danger of\r\ngovernments becoming weakened and destroyed by reason of their extension\r\nof territory. Commerce, education, and rapid transit of thought and\r\nmatter by telegraph and steam have changed all this. Rather do I believe\r\nthat our Great Maker is preparing the world, in His own good time, to\r\nbecome one nation, speaking one language, and when armies and navies\r\nwill be no longer required.\r\n\r\nMy efforts in the future will be directed to the restoration of good\r\nfeeling between the different sections of our common country; to the\r\nrestoration of our currency to a fixed value as compared with the\r\nworld's standard of values--gold--and, if possible, to a par with it;\r\nto the construction of cheap routes of transit throughout the land, to\r\nthe end that the products of all may find a market and leave a living\r\nremuneration to the producer; to the maintenance of friendly relations\r\nwith all our neighbors and with distant nations; to the reestablishment\r\nof our commerce and share in the carrying trade upon the ocean; to the\r\nencouragement of such manufacturing industries as can be economically\r\npursued in this country, to the end that the exports of home products\r\nand industries may pay for our imports--the only sure method of\r\nreturning to and permanently maintaining a specie basis; to the\r\nelevation of labor; and, by a humane course, to bring the aborigines of\r\nthe country under the benign influences of education and civilization.\r\nIt is either this or war of extermination. Wars of extermination,\r\nengaged in by people pursuing commerce and all industrial pursuits,\r\nare expensive even against the weakest people, and are demoralizing\r\nand wicked. Our superiority of strength and advantages of civilization\r\nshould make us lenient toward the Indian. The wrong inflicted upon him\r\nshould be taken into account and the balance placed to his credit. The\r\nmoral view of the question should be considered and the question asked,\r\nCan not the Indian be made a useful and productive member of society by\r\nproper teaching and treatment? If the effort is made in good faith, we\r\nwill stand better before the civilized nations of the earth and in our\r\nown consciences for having made it.\r\n\r\nAll these things are not to be accomplished by one individual, but they\r\nwill receive my support and such recommendations to Congress as will in\r\nmy judgment best serve to carry them into effect. I beg your support and\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\nIt has been, and is, my earnest desire to correct abuses that have grown\r\nup in the civil service of the country. To secure this reformation rules\r\nregulating methods of appointment and promotions were established and\r\nhave been tried. My efforts for such reformation shall be continued to\r\nthe best of my judgment. The spirit of the rules adopted will be\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nI acknowledge before this assemblage, representing, as it does, every\r\nsection of our country, the obligation I am under to my countrymen for\r\nthe great honor they have conferred on me by returning me to the highest\r\noffice within their gift, and the further obligation resting on me to\r\nrender to them the best services within my power. This I promise,\r\nlooking forward with the greatest anxiety to the day when I shall be\r\nreleased from responsibilities that at times are almost overwhelming,\r\nand from which I have scarcely had a respite since the eventful firing\r\nupon Fort Sumter, in April, 1861, to the present day. My services were\r\nthen tendered and accepted under the first call for troops growing out\r\nof that event.\r\n\r\nI did not ask for place or position, and was entirely without influence\r\nor the acquaintance of persons of influence, but was resolved to perform\r\nmy part in a struggle threatening the very existence of the nation.\r\nI performed a conscientious duty, without asking promotion or command,\r\nand without a revengeful feeling toward any section or individual.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, throughout the war, and from my candidacy for my\r\npresent office in 1868 to the close of the last Presidential campaign,\r\nI have been the subject of abuse and slander scarcely ever equaled in\r\npolitical history, which to-day I feel that I can afford to disregard\r\nin view of your verdict, which I gratefully accept as my vindication.\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas, under the pretense that William P. Kellogg, the present\r\nexecutive of Louisiana, and the officers associated with him in the\r\nState administration were not duly elected, certain turbulent and\r\ndisorderly persons have combined together with force and arms to resist\r\nthe laws and constituted authorities of said State; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it has been duly certified by the proper local authorities and\r\njudicially determined by the inferior and supreme courts of said State\r\nthat said officers are entitled to hold their offices, respectively, and\r\nexecute and discharge the functions thereof; and\r\n\r\nWhereas Congress, at its late session, upon a due consideration of the\r\nsubject, tacitly recognized the said executive and his associates, then\r\nas now in office, by refusing to take any action with respect thereto;\r\nand\r\n\r\nWhereas it is provided in the Constitution of the United States that the\r\nUnited States shall protect every State in this Union, on application of\r\nthe legislature, or of the executive when the legislature can not be\r\nconvened, against domestic violence; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is provided in the laws of the United States that in all\r\ncases of insurrection in any State or of obstruction to the laws\r\nthereof it shall be lawful for the President of the United States, on\r\napplication of the legislature of such State, or of the executive when\r\nthe legislature can not be convened, to call forth the militia of any\r\nother State or States, or to employ such part of the land and naval\r\nforces as shall be judged necessary, for the purpose of suppressing\r\nsuch insurrection or causing the laws to be duly executed; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the legislature of said State is not now in session, and can not\r\nbe convened in time to meet the present emergency, and the executive of\r\nsaid State, under section 4 of Article IV of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States and the laws passed in pursuance thereof, has therefore\r\nmade application to me for such part of the military force of the United\r\nStates as may be necessary and adequate to protect said State and the\r\ncitizens thereof against domestic violence and to enforce the due\r\nexecution of the laws; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is required that whenever it may be necessary, in the\r\njudgment of the President, to use the military force for the purpose\r\naforesaid, he shall forthwith, by proclamation, command such insurgents\r\nto disperse and retire peaceably to their respective homes within a\r\nlimited time:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Ulysses S.

But this rule shall not apply to recommendations made by\r\nofficers as to their own subordinates.\r\n\r\n_Rule 2_.--While it is not the purpose of the rules and regulations\r\nprescribed for the government of the civil service either to restrict\r\nthe power of removal or to extend the tenure of service, such power\r\nwill not be exercised arbitrarily, and therefore applications must\r\nnot be entertained by any authority having the duty of nomination or\r\nappointment for the removal of any person in the civil service, nor will\r\nany person be removed for the mere purpose of making a place for any\r\nother person.\r\n\r\n_Rule 3_.--To prevent any misapprehension in the public mind in regard\r\nto the functions of the members of the Civil Service Commission and of\r\nthe members of any board of examiners, it is declared not to be any part\r\nof the duty or authority of any such member to act upon, take part in,\r\nor in any way entertain any recommendation, application, or question\r\nconcerning appointments or removals in respect of the civil service,\r\notherwise than in the strict discharge of their respective duties as\r\nprescribed by the rules and regulations; and for the same purpose it is\r\nfurther declared that the functions of the members of said Commission as\r\nto the matters aforesaid extend only to the question of the proper rules\r\nand regulations to be made and to supervising their application, and\r\nthat the functions of the examiners as to said matters extend only to\r\npreparing for, conducting, rating, and making reports concerning\r\nexaminations required to be made under such rules and regulations.\r\n\r\n_Rule 4_.--The grouping heretofore made for the Executive Departments at\r\nWashington is hereby modified by striking out the words \"female clerks,\r\ncopyists, and counters, at $900 a year,\" these places being below the\r\ngrade of clerkships of class 1; and all applicants for such positions\r\nshall be examined in (1) penmanship, (2) copying, (3) elements of\r\nEnglish grammar, chiefly orthography, and (4) fundamental rules of\r\narithmetic, except that mere counters may be examined only in the\r\nfundamental rules of arithmetic and as to their facility in counting\r\nmoney; and those found competent by such examination shall be reported\r\nin the order of their excellence as eligible for appointment, and\r\nselections may be made by the appointing power, at discretion, from the\r\nlist of those so reported, being at liberty to give preference to such\r\nas may be justly regarded as having the highest claims to public\r\nconsideration by reason of loss of support or of property occasioned by\r\nthe death or disability of any person in the defense of the Union in war\r\nor in other public service of the Government. And in the notices of the\r\nexamination of females to fill vacancies among those last mentioned it\r\nshall be stated as follows: \"That from among all those who shall pass a\r\nsatisfactory examination the head of the Department will be at liberty\r\nto select such persons for the vacancies as may be justly regarded as\r\nhaving the highest claims to public consideration.\"\r\n\r\n_Rule 5_.--The notices to appear at any examinations other than those\r\nreferred to in the fourth rule of this series, so far as practicable and\r\nnecessary to prevent misapprehension, shall advise female applicants to\r\nwhom they may be sent of any limitation which the law or the necessities\r\nof the public service impose upon such applicants entering the vacancies\r\nfor which the examinations are to take place.\r\n\r\n_Rule 6_.--That it shall be the duty of the respective boards of\r\nexaminers, on the written request of heads of Departments, to hold\r\nexaminations in anticipation of vacancies, as well as to fill vacancies,\r\nand to prepare lists showing the results of competition, so that when\r\nany such vacancy may happen there shall be those thus shown to be\r\neligible to nomination or appointment, from whom the proper selection\r\nshall be made according to the provisions of the rules and regulations\r\nrelating to competitive examination; and examinations upon like request\r\nshall be held in reference to vacancies to be filled under the fourth\r\nrule of this series.\r\n\r\n_Rule 7._--Applicants for appointment as cashiers of collectors of\r\ncustoms, cashiers of assistant treasurers, cashiers of postmasters,\r\nsuperintendents of money-order divisions in post-offices, and other\r\ncustodians of large sums of public money for whose fidelity another\r\nofficer has given official bonds may be appointed at discretion; but\r\nthis rule shall not apply to any appointment to a position grouped below\r\nthe grade of assistant teller.\r\n\r\n_Rule 8_.--In cases of defalcation or embezzlement of public money, or\r\nother emergency calling for immediate action, where the public service\r\nwould be materially injured unless the vacancy is promptly filled\r\nwithout resorting to the methods of selection and appointment prescribed\r\nby the rules and regulations, or when a vacancy happens at a place\r\nremote and difficult of access and the methods prescribed for filling\r\nit can not be applied without causing delay injurious to the public\r\nservice, the appointment may be made at discretion; but this rule shall\r\nnot apply to any place which is provided to be filled under the rules of\r\ncompetitive examination.\r\n\r\n_Rule 9_.--For the purpose of bringing the examinations for the civil\r\nservice as near to the residences of those desiring to be examined as\r\nthe appropriation at the command of the President will warrant, and for\r\nthe further purpose of facilitating as far as practicable the making of\r\nselections for such service equably from the several portions of the\r\nUnion, while at the same time preserving the principle of promoting\r\nmerit as tested by fair competition, it is provided as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) That the several States and Territories are grouped into five\r\ndivisions, to be designated as civil-service districts, the said\r\ndistricts to be numbered consecutively from one to five, as follows:\r\n\r\nI.

The fifth district embraces the States of South Carolina, Georgia,\r\nFlorida, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and\r\nTennessee, together with the Territory of New Mexico; and the\r\nexaminations therein shall be held alternately at the city of Savannah\r\nand the city of Memphis, but first at the city of Savannah.\r\n\r\n(2) That in each of said districts examinations for admission to the\r\ncivil service at Washington shall be conducted as hereinafter provided;\r\nand those whose residence is within any such district at the time of\r\nfiling the application for examination shall be regarded as belonging to\r\nsuch district in reference both to competition and to appointments; and\r\neach district shall be treated as a sphere of competition, and those so\r\nresiding therein, wherever examined, shall be regarded as competing only\r\nwith each other; but a person residing in any district may be allowed or\r\nnotified to be examined in any other district.\r\n\r\n(3) All applications for examination for service at Washington must be\r\naddressed to the head of the Department at that city which the applicant\r\ndesires to enter, and be in conformity to the previous rules and\r\nregulations so far as the same are not modified by this series; and\r\nevery such application must be dated, must give the town or municipality\r\nas well as the State or Territory where the applicant has his legal\r\nresidence, and also his post-office address.\r\n\r\n(4) Each of the heads of Departments will cause to be kept in permanent\r\nform a register of all such applicants for his Department, to be called\r\na \"Register of applicants,\" and will cause such applications to be\r\npreserved on file for convenient reference.\r\n\r\n(5) The provisions of the former rules and regulations in reference to\r\nthe examining boards in the Departments and in the other local offices\r\nin the various cities, so far as consistent herewith, are continued\r\nuntil otherwise ordered.\r\n\r\n(6) The President will employ or designate a suitable person to be chief\r\nexaminer, whose duty it will be, subject to the supervision of the Civil\r\nService Commission, to promote uniformity in preparing for, conducting,\r\nreporting, and grading the examinations by said boards at Washington,\r\nand to prepare for, attend, supervise, and report the examinations\r\nherein provided to be held elsewhere than at Washington.\r\n\r\n(7) The several heads of Departments must also cause to be made in\r\npermanent form and to be preserved a \"Record of persons eligible for\r\nappointment,\" arranging under separate headings those resident in each\r\nseparate district, wherein shall be entered the names of the persons who\r\nhave been examined within twelve months now last past, and who are still\r\neligible to nomination or appointment; and to such record must from time\r\nto time be added the names of those persons who shall hereafter pass an\r\nexamination which shall show them to be so eligible for nomination or\r\nappointment. And such \"Record of persons eligible for appointment\" shall\r\nbe so kept and the names therein be so classified that all those whose\r\nresidences appearing as aforesaid to be in the same districts shall be\r\ntabulated together, so as to show their relative excellence in each said\r\ndistrict, except that the names of all those examined under the fourth\r\nrule of this series shall be separately entered upon the \"Record of\r\npersons eligible for appointment\" for each Department, so as to show\r\nwhere they reside.\r\n\r\n(8) That the officer having the power of making nomination or\r\nappointment may resort for that purpose to those so entered in the\r\n\"Record of persons eligible for appointment\" as residing in either of\r\nsaid civil-service districts; but (except in respect of those examined\r\nunder said rule 4) the method of competition heretofore provided must be\r\nregarded as applying among those so registered as residing in any such\r\ndistrict, and as requiring the nomination and appointment to be made\r\nfrom some one of the three persons graded as the highest on some one of\r\nsaid five several arrangements of persons so eligible.\r\n\r\n(9) At a reasonable time before any examination is to take place each\r\nhead of Department will furnish the chief examiner with a list of those\r\nto be examined, and ten days before any examination is to take place in\r\nany said district, elsewhere than at Washington, notice shall be sent by\r\nmail by such chief examiner to all such applicants residing or allowed\r\nto be examined in such district, stating the time and place of such\r\nexamination and the other matters of which the rules and regulations\r\nrequire notice to be given.\r\n\r\n(10) For the purpose of the examinations last mentioned the said chief\r\nexaminer shall receive from the several heads of Departments at\r\nWashington and from the head of any local office which may request to\r\nhave any examinations made of persons for said offices the names of\r\nthose who are to be examined at any place outside of Washington, and\r\nshall make a list of the same, showing the date of the filing of each\r\napplication, which he shall produce at the place of examination; and the\r\nexamination shall be held of all those on such list who shall duly\r\nappear and submit thereto, provided the number be not so great, in the\r\nopinion of the examining board, as to render the examination of the\r\nwhole impracticable, in which event only a reasonable number, to be\r\nselected in the order of the date of the filing of their applications,\r\nneed be examined.\r\n\r\n(11) For each place outside of Washington where such examination is to\r\nbe held the President will designate persons, to be, when practicable,\r\nsuitable officers of the United States, who, together with such chief\r\nexaminer, or some substituted departmental examiner from Washington to\r\nbe sent in his place when such chief examiner can not attend, shall\r\nconstitute the board for such examination; and by said persons, or a\r\nmajority thereof, of whom such chief examiner or said substitute shall\r\nbe one, such examinations shall be held and certified in a uniform\r\nmanner; and the time occupied by each person examined shall be noted on\r\nthe examination papers. The questions to be put to those examined as\r\napplicants through the request of either head of Department or head of\r\nlocal office shall be such as may be provided and as might be put if all\r\nsuch examinations were, or were to be, conducted under the rules and\r\nregulations by the examining boards of any such Department in Washington\r\nor by any such local board.\r\n\r\n(12) The chief examiner or his substitute shall make reports to each\r\nDepartment and local office separately in respect of all such persons\r\nas either said head of Department or of a local office requested to be\r\nexamined, and said reports, respectively, shall be accompanied by the\r\nexamination papers of those so separately reported; and the board of\r\nexaminers in each Department or local office shall make up and state the\r\nexcellence of each person so reported as examined, and such excellence,\r\nbeing not below the minimum grade of 70 per cent, shall be duly entered\r\nin the \"Record of persons eligible for appointment\" in the proper\r\ndistrict or local office.\r\n\r\n(13) The district examinations herein provided for shall be held\r\nnot more than twice in any one year in the same district, except\r\nin Washington, where an examination may be held in respect of each\r\nDepartment as frequently as the head of such Department, subject to the\r\napproval of the President, may direct; and all persons so examined in\r\nWashington, wherever they may reside, shall be entered on the \"Record\r\nof persons eligible for appointment\" equally as if examined elsewhere.\r\n\r\n(14) Whenever the entry of the name of any person has been on the\r\n\"Record of persons eligible for appointment\" during eighteen consecutive\r\nmonths, such entry shall be marked \"Time expired,\" and such name shall\r\nnot again be placed thereon except as the result of another examination.\r\n\r\n(15) Persons who may be required to be examined for any custom-house,\r\npost-office, or other local office or place of service other than\r\nWashington may be notified by the head of such office to appear and be\r\nexamined at any examination provided for under this rule; and the result\r\nof such examination shall be reported by the chief examiner or his\r\nsubstitute to the proper examining board for such office or place, or to\r\nthe head of the local office; and such board shall enter the name, with\r\nthe proper indication of the grade of excellence, among those who are to\r\ncompete at any such place or office, and from whom selection, on the\r\nbasis of competition, shall be made.\r\n\r\n(16) But where the result of any examination aforesaid shall show the\r\nexcellence of any such applicant to be below the minimum grade of 70 per\r\ncent (on the basis of l00 as perfect), the only entry thereof to be made\r\nin registers of the Department or of local office shall be of the words\r\n\"Not eligible,\" which shall be written against the name of such person\r\nin the register of applicants; and such applicant shall not be again\r\nexamined for any Department or office within six months of the date of\r\nthe former examination.\r\n\r\n(17) The provisions of this rule do not apply to examinations\r\nfor promotion, nor do they apply to the State Department, in which\r\nexaminations will be conducted under the provisions of the Executive\r\norder of March 14, 1873.\r\n\r\n(18) Subject to the other provisions of this rule, the times of holding\r\nthe examinations herein provided for in the first, third, fourth, and\r\nfifth districts, respectively, shall be fixed by the chief examiner\r\nafter consultation with the heads of Departments at Washington. One\r\nexamination, however, shall be held in each of the last-mentioned\r\ndistricts prior to the 1st day of November next, and the chief examiner\r\nshall on or before that date make a report in writing to the Civil\r\nService Commission, setting forth generally the facts in regard to the\r\nexaminations referred to in this rule and appropriate suggestions for\r\nincreasing their usefulness.\r\n\r\n_Rule 10_.--So many of the persons employed by the President under the\r\nninth section of the act of March 3, 1871, as are referred to in the\r\nopinion of the Attorney-General of the date of August 31, 1871, under\r\nthe name of the Civil Service Commission, and are still in such\r\nemployment, together with the successors of those who have resigned,\r\nand their successors, shall hereafter be regarded as composing and shall\r\nbe designated as \"The Civil Service Commission;\" and the use of the\r\ndesignation \"Advisory Board,\" as referring to such persons, will be\r\nhereafter discontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDERS, No. 102.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, October 10, 1873_.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States commands it to be made known that all\r\nsoldiers who have deserted their colors, and who shall, on or before the\r\n1st day of January, 1874, surrender themselves at any military station,\r\nshall receive a full pardon, only forfeiting the pay and allowances due\r\nthem at the time of desertion, and shall be restored to duty without\r\ntrial or punishment on condition that they faithfully serve through the\r\nterm of their enlistment.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War:\r\n\r\nE.D. TOWNSEND,\r\n\r\n_Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 1, 1873_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe year that has passed since the submission of my last message to\r\nCongress has, especially during the latter part of it, been an eventful\r\none to the country. In the midst of great national prosperity a\r\nfinancial crisis has occurred that has brought low fortunes of gigantic\r\nproportions; political partisanship has almost ceased to exist,\r\nespecially in the agricultural regions; and, finally, the capture upon\r\nthe high seas of a vessel bearing our flag has for a time threatened the\r\nmost serious consequences, and has agitated the public mind from one end\r\nof the country to the other. But this, happily, now is in the course of\r\nsatisfactory adjustment, honorable to both nations concerned.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the United States, however, with most of the other\r\npowers continue to be friendly and cordial. With France, Germany,\r\nRussia, Italy, and the minor European powers; with Brazil and most of\r\nthe South American Republics, and with Japan, nothing has occurred\r\nduring the year to demand special notice. The correspondence between the\r\nDepartment of State and various diplomatic representatives in or from\r\nthose countries is transmitted herewith.\r\n\r\nIn executing the will of Congress, as expressed in its joint resolution\r\nof the 14th of February last, and in accordance with the provisions of\r\nthe resolution, a number of \"practical artisans,\" of \"scientific men,\"\r\nand of \"honorary commissioners\" were authorized to attend the exposition\r\nat Vienna as commissioners on the part of the United States. It is\r\nbelieved that we have obtained the object which Congress had in view\r\nwhen it passed the joint resolution--\"in order to enable the people of\r\nthe United States to participate in the advantages of the International\r\nExhibition of the Products of Agriculture, Manufactures, and the Fine\r\nArts to be held at Vienna.\" I take pleasure in adding that the American\r\nexhibitors have received a gratifying number of diplomas and of medals.\r\n\r\nDuring the exposition a conference was held at Vienna for the purpose of\r\nconsultation on the systems prevailing in different countries for the\r\nprotection of inventions. I authorized a representative from the Patent\r\nOffice to be present at Vienna at the time when this conference was to\r\ntake place, in order to aid as far as he might in securing any possible\r\nadditional protection to American inventors in Europe. The report of\r\nthis agent will be laid before Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is my pleasant duty to announce to Congress that the Emperor\r\nof China, on attaining his majority, received the diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives of the Western powers in person. An account of these\r\nceremonies and of the interesting discussions which preceded them will\r\nbe found in the documents transmitted herewith. The accompanying papers\r\nshow that some advance, although slight, has been made during the past\r\nyear toward the suppression of the infamous Chinese cooly trade. I\r\nrecommend Congress to inquire whether additional legislation be not\r\nneeded on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe money awarded to the United States by the tribunal of arbitration at\r\nGeneva was paid by Her Majesty's Government a few days in advance of the\r\ntime when it would have become payable according to the terms of the\r\ntreaty. In compliance with the provisions of the act of March 3, 1873,\r\nit was at once paid into the Treasury, and used to redeem, so far as it\r\nmight, the public debt of the United States; and the amount so redeemed\r\nwas invested in a 5 per cent registered bond of the United States for\r\n$15,500,000, which is now held by the Secretary of State, subject to the\r\nfuture disposition of Congress.\r\n\r\nI renew my recommendation, made at the opening of the last session of\r\nCongress, that a commission be created for the purpose of auditing and\r\ndetermining the amounts of the several \"direct losses growing out of\r\nthe destruction of vessels and their cargoes\" by the _Alabama_, the\r\n_Florida_, or the _Shenandoah_ after leaving Melbourne, for which\r\nthe sufferers have received no equivalent or compensation, and of\r\nascertaining the names of the persons entitled to receive compensation\r\nfor the same, making the computations upon the basis indicated by the\r\ntribunal of arbitration at Geneva; and that payment of such losses be\r\nauthorized to an extent not to exceed the awards of the tribunal at\r\nGeneva.\r\n\r\nBy an act approved on the 14th day of February last Congress made\r\nprovision for completing, jointly with an officer or commissioner\r\nto be named by Her Britannic Majesty, the determination of so much\r\nof the boundary line between the territory of the United States\r\nand the possessions of Great Britain as was left uncompleted by the\r\ncommissioners appointed under the act of Congress of August 11, 1856.\r\nUnder the provisions of this act the northwest water boundary of the\r\nUnited States has been determined and marked in accordance with the\r\naward of the Emperor of Germany. A protocol and a copy of the map upon\r\nwhich the line was thus marked are contained in the papers submitted\r\nherewith.\r\n\r\nI also transmit a copy of the report of the commissioner for marking the\r\nnorthern boundary between the United States and the British possessions\r\nwest of the Lake of the Woods, of the operations of the commission\r\nduring the past season. Surveys have been made to a point 497 miles west\r\nof the Lake of the Woods, leaving about 350 miles to be surveyed, the\r\nfield work of which can be completed during the next season.\r\n\r\nThe mixed commission organized under the provisions of the treaty of\r\nWashington for settling and determining the claims of citizens of either\r\npower against the other arising out of acts committed against their\r\npersons or property during the period between April 13, 1861, and April\r\n9, 1865, made its final award on the 25th day of September last. It was\r\nawarded that the Government of the United States should pay to the\r\nGovernment of Her Britannic Majesty, within twelve months from the date\r\nof the award, the sum of $1,929,819 in gold. The commission disallowed\r\nor dismissed all other claims of British subjects against the United\r\nStates. The amount of the claims presented by the British Government,\r\nbut disallowed or dismissed, is understood to be about $93,000,000. It\r\nalso disallowed all the claims of citizens of the United States against\r\nGreat Britain which were referred to it.\r\n\r\nI recommend the early passage of an act appropriating the amount\r\nnecessary to pay this award against the United States.\r\n\r\nI have caused to be communicated to the Government of the King of Italy\r\nthe thanks of this Government for the eminent services rendered by\r\nCount Corti as the third commissioner on this commission. With dignity,\r\nlearning, and impartiality he discharged duties requiring great labor\r\nand constant patience, to the satisfaction, I believe, of both\r\nGovernments. I recommend legislation to create a special court, to\r\nconsist of three judges, who shall be empowered to hear and determine\r\nall claims of aliens upon the United States arising out of acts\r\ncommitted against their persons or property during the insurrection.\r\nThe recent reference under the treaty of Washington was confined to\r\nclaims of British subjects arising during the period named in the\r\ntreaty; but it is understood that there are other British claims of a\r\nsimilar nature, arising after the 9th of April, 1865, and it is known\r\nthat other claims of a like nature are advanced by citizens or subjects\r\nof other powers. It is desirable to have these claims also examined and\r\ndisposed of.\r\n\r\nOfficial information being received from the Dutch Government of a state\r\nof war between the King of the Netherlands and the Sultan of Acheen, the\r\nofficers of the United States who were near the seat of the war were\r\ninstructed to observe an impartial neutrality. It is believed that they\r\nhave done so.\r\n\r\nThe joint commission under the convention with Mexico of 1868, having\r\nagain been legally prolonged, has resumed its business, which, it\r\nis hoped, may be brought to an early conclusion. The distinguished\r\nrepresentative of Her Britannic Majesty at Washington has kindly\r\nconsented, with the approval of his Government, to assume the arduous\r\nand responsible duties of umpire in this commission, and to lend the\r\nweight of his character and name to such decisions as may not receive\r\nthe acquiescence of both the arbitrators appointed by the respective\r\nGovernments.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed pursuant to the authority of Congress to\r\nexamine into the nature and extent of the forays by trespassers from\r\nthat country upon the herds of Texas have made a report, which will be\r\nsubmitted for your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Venezuelan Government has been apprised of the sense of Congress in\r\nregard to the awards of the joint commission under the convention of\r\n25th April, 1866, as expressed in the act of the 25th of February last.\r\n\r\nIt is apprehended that that Government does not realize the character of\r\nits obligations under that convention. As there is reason to believe,\r\nhowever, that its hesitancy in recognizing them springs, in part at\r\nleast, from real difficulty in discharging them in connection with its\r\nobligations to other governments, the expediency of further forbearance\r\non our part is believed to be worthy of your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Government and that of Egypt have latterly shown a\r\ndisposition to relieve foreign consuls of the judicial powers which\r\nheretofore they have exercised in the Turkish dominions, by organizing\r\nother tribunals. As Congress, however, has by law provided for the\r\ndischarge of judicial functions by consuls of the United States in that\r\nquarter under the treaty of 1830, I have not felt at liberty formally\r\nto accept the proposed change without the assent of Congress, whose\r\ndecision upon the subject at as early a period as may be convenient is\r\nearnestly requested.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration and determination of\r\nCongress, an application of the Republic of Santo Domingo to this\r\nGovernment to exercise a protectorate over that Republic.\r\n\r\nSince the adjournment of Congress the following treaties with foreign\r\npowers have been proclaimed: A naturalization convention with Denmark; a\r\nconvention with Mexico for renewing the Claims Commission; a convention\r\nof friendship, commerce, and extradition with the Orange Free State, and\r\na naturalization convention with Ecuador.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation made in my message of December, 1870, that\r\nCongress authorize the Postmaster-General to issue all commissions to\r\nofficials appointed through his Department.\r\n\r\nI invite the earnest attention of Congress to the existing laws of the\r\nUnited States respecting expatriation and the election of nationality\r\nby individuals. Many citizens of the United States reside permanently\r\nabroad with their families. Under the provisions of the act approved\r\nFebruary 10, 1855, the children of such persons are to be deemed and\r\ntaken to be citizens of the United States, but the rights of citizenship\r\nare not to descend to persons whose fathers never resided in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIt thus happens that persons who have never resided within the United\r\nStates have been enabled to put forward a pretension to the protection\r\nof the United States against the claim to military service of the\r\ngovernment under whose protection they were born and have been reared.\r\nIn some cases even naturalized citizens of the United States have\r\nreturned to the land of their birth, with intent to remain there, and\r\ntheir children, the issue of a marriage contracted there after their\r\nreturn, and who have never been in the United States, have laid claim to\r\nour protection when the lapse of many years had imposed upon them the\r\nduty of military service to the only government which had ever known\r\nthem personally.\r\n\r\nUntil the year 1868 it was left, embarrassed by conflicting opinions of\r\ncourts and of jurists, to determine how far the doctrine of perpetual\r\nallegiance derived from our former colonial relations with Great Britain\r\nwas applicable to American citizens. Congress then wisely swept these\r\ndoubts away by enacting that--\r\n\r\nAny declaration, instruction, opinion, order, or decision of any officer\r\nof this Government which denies, restricts, impairs, or questions the\r\nright of expatriation is inconsistent with the fundamental principles of\r\nthis Government.\r\n\r\nBut Congress did not indicate in that statute, nor has it since done so,\r\nwhat acts are to be deemed to work expatriation. For my own guidance\r\nin determining such questions I required (under the provisions of the\r\nConstitution) the opinion in writing of the principal officer in each\r\nof the Executive Departments upon certain questions relating to this\r\nsubject. The result satisfies me that further legislation has become\r\nnecessary. I therefore commend the subject to the careful consideration\r\nof Congress, and I transmit herewith copies of the several opinions of\r\nthe principal officers of the Executive Departments, together with other\r\ncorrespondence and pertinent information on the same subject.\r\n\r\nThe United States, who led the way in the overthrow of the feudal\r\ndoctrine of perpetual allegiance, are among the last to indicate how\r\ntheir own citizens may elect another nationality. The papers submitted\r\nherewith indicate what is necessary to place us on a par with other\r\nleading nations in liberality of legislation on this international\r\nquestion. We have already in our treaties assented to the principles\r\nwhich would need to be embodied in laws intended to accomplish such\r\nresults. We have agreed that citizens of the United States may cease to\r\nbe citizens and may voluntarily render allegiance to other powers. We\r\nhave agreed that residence in a foreign land without intent to return,\r\nshall of itself work expatriation. We have agreed in some instances upon\r\nthe length of time necessary for such continued residence to work a\r\npresumption of such intent. I invite Congress now to mark out and define\r\nwhen and how expatriation can be accomplished; to regulate by law the\r\ncondition of American women marrying foreigners; to fix the status of\r\nchildren born in a foreign country of American parents residing more or\r\nless permanently abroad, and to make rules for determining such other\r\nkindred points as may seem best to Congress.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the request of Congress, I transmitted to the\r\nAmerican minister at Madrid, with instructions to present it to the\r\nSpanish Government, the joint resolution approved on the 3d of March\r\nlast, tendering to the people of Spain, in the name and on the behalf of\r\nthe American people, the congratulations of Congress upon the efforts to\r\nconsolidate in Spain the principles of universal liberty in a republican\r\nform of government.\r\n\r\nThe existence of this new Republic was inaugurated by striking the\r\nfetters from the slaves in Porto Rico. This beneficent measure was\r\nfollowed by the release of several thousand persons illegally held as\r\nslaves in Cuba. Next, the Captain-General of that colony was deprived of\r\nthe power to set aside the orders of his superiors at Madrid, which had\r\npertained to the office since 1825. The sequestered estates of American\r\ncitizens, which had been the cause of long and fruitless correspondence,\r\nwere ordered to be restored to their owners. All these liberal steps\r\nwere taken in the face of a violent opposition directed by the\r\nreactionary slaveholders of Havana, who are vainly striving to stay the\r\nmarch of ideas which has terminated slavery in Christendom, Cuba only\r\nexcepted. Unhappily, however, this baneful influence has thus far\r\nsucceeded in defeating the efforts of all liberal-minded men in Spain to\r\nabolish slavery in Cuba, and in preventing the promised reform in that\r\nisland. The struggle for political supremacy continues there.\r\n\r\nThe proslavery and aristocratic party in Cuba is gradually arraigning\r\nitself in more and more open hostility and defiance of the home\r\ngovernment, while it still maintains a political connection with the\r\nRepublic in the peninsula; and although usurping and defying the\r\nauthority of the home government whenever such usurpation or defiance\r\ntends in the direction of oppression or of the maintenance of abuses,\r\nit is still a power in Madrid, and is recognized by the Government.\r\nThus an element more dangerous to continued colonial relations between\r\nCuba and Spain than that which inspired the insurrection at Yara--an\r\nelement opposed to granting any relief from misrule and abuse, with\r\nno aspirations after freedom, commanding no sympathies in generous\r\nbreasts, aiming to rivet still stronger the shackles of slavery and\r\noppression--has seized many of the emblems of power in Cuba, and,\r\nunder professions of loyalty to the mother country, is exhausting the\r\nresources of the island, and is doing acts which are at variance with\r\nthose principles of justice, of liberality, and of right which give\r\nnobility of character to a republic. In the interests of humanity,\r\nof civilization, and of progress, it is to be hoped that this evil\r\ninfluence may be soon averted.\r\n\r\nThe steamer _Virginius_ was on the 26th day of September, 1870, duly\r\nregistered at the port of New York as a part of the commercial marine\r\nof the United States. On the 4th of October, 1870, having received the\r\ncertificate of her register in the usual legal form, she sailed from\r\nthe port of New York and has not since been within the territorial\r\njurisdiction of the United States. On the 31st day of October last,\r\nwhile sailing under the flag of the United States on the high seas, she\r\nwas forcibly seized by the Spanish gunboat _Tornado_, and was carried\r\ninto the port of Santiago de Cuba, where fifty-three of her passengers\r\nand crew were inhumanly, and, so far at least as relates to those who\r\nwere citizens of the United States, without due process of law, put to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-established principle, asserted by the United States from\r\nthe beginning of their national independence, recognized by Great\r\nBritain and other maritime powers, and stated by the Senate in a\r\nresolution passed unanimously on the 16th of June, 1858, that--\r\n\r\n  American vessels on the high seas in time of peace, bearing the\r\n  American flag, remain under the jurisdiction of the country to which\r\n  they belong, and therefore any visitation, molestation, or detention\r\n  of such vessel by force, or by the exhibition of force, on the part\r\n  of a foreign power is in derogation of the sovereignty of the United\r\n  States.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this principle, the restoration of the _Virginius_\r\nand the surrender of the survivors of her passengers and crew, and a due\r\nreparation to the flag, and the punishment of the authorities who had\r\nbeen guilty of the illegal acts of violence, were demanded. The Spanish\r\nGovernment has recognized the justice of the demand, and has arranged\r\nfor the immediate delivery of the vessel, and for the surrender of the\r\nsurvivors of the passengers and crew, and for a salute to the flag, and\r\nfor proceedings looking to the punishment of those who may be proved to\r\nhave been guilty of illegal acts of violence toward citizens of the\r\nUnited States, and also toward indemnifying those who may be shown to be\r\nentitled to indemnity. A copy of a protocol of a conference between the\r\nSecretary of State and the Spanish minister, in which the terms of this\r\narrangement were agreed to, is transmitted herewith.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence on this subject with the legation of the United\r\nStates in Madrid was conducted in cipher and by cable, and needs the\r\nverification of the actual text of the correspondence. It has seemed\r\nto me to be due to the importance of the case not to submit this\r\ncorrespondence until the accurate text can be received by mail. It is\r\nexpected shortly, and will be submitted when received.\r\n\r\nIn taking leave of this subject for the present I wish to renew the\r\nexpression of my conviction that the existence of African slavery in\r\nCuba is a principal cause of the lamentable condition of the island.\r\nI do not doubt that Congress shares with me the hope that it will\r\nsoon be made to disappear, and that peace and prosperity may follow\r\nits abolition.\r\n\r\nThe embargoing of American estates in Cuba, cruelty to American citizens\r\ndetected in no act of hostility to the Spanish Government, the murdering\r\nof prisoners taken with arms in their hands, and, finally, the capture\r\nupon the high seas of a vessel sailing under the United States flag\r\nand bearing a United States registry have culminated in an outburst\r\nof indignation that has seemed for a time to threaten war. Pending\r\nnegotiations between the United States and the Government of Spain on\r\nthe subject of this capture, I have authorized the Secretary of the\r\nNavy to put our Navy on a war footing, to the extent, at least, of the\r\nentire annual appropriation for that branch of the service, trusting\r\nto Congress and the public opinion of the American people to justify\r\nmy action.\r\n\r\nAssuming from the action of the last Congress in appointing a Committee\r\non Privileges and Elections to prepare and report to this Congress a\r\nconstitutional amendment to provide a better method of electing the\r\nPresident and Vice-President of the United States, and also from the\r\nnecessity of such an amendment, that there will be submitted to the\r\nState legislatures for ratification such an improvement in our\r\nConstitution, I suggest two others for your consideration:\r\n\r\nFirst. To authorize the Executive to approve of so much of any measure\r\npassing the two Houses of Congress as his judgment may dictate, without\r\napproving the whole, the disapproved portion or portions to be subjected\r\nto the same rules as now, to wit, to be referred back to the House in\r\nwhich the measure or measures originated, and, if passed by a two-thirds\r\nvote of the two Houses, then to become a law without the approval of the\r\nPresident. I would add to this a provision that there should be no\r\nlegislation by Congress during the last twenty-four hours of its\r\nsitting, except upon vetoes, in order to give the Executive an\r\nopportunity to examine and approve or disapprove bills understandingly.\r\n\r\nSecond. To provide by amendment that when an extra session of Congress\r\nis convened by Executive proclamation legislation during the continuance\r\nof such extra session shall be confined to such subjects as the\r\nExecutive may bring before it from time to time in writing.\r\n\r\nThe advantages to be gained by these two amendments are too obvious for\r\nme to comment upon them. One session in each year is provided for by the\r\nConstitution, in which there are no restrictions as to the subjects of\r\nlegislation by Congress. If more are required, it is always in the power\r\nof Congress, during their term of office, to provide for sessions at any\r\ntime. The first of these amendments would protect the public against the\r\nmany abuses and waste of public moneys which creep into appropriation\r\nbills and other important measures passing during the expiring hours of\r\nCongress, to which otherwise due consideration can not be given.\r\n\r\nTREASURY DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the Government from all sources for the last fiscal\r\nyear were $333,738,204, and expenditures on all accounts $290,345,245,\r\nthus showing an excess of receipts over expenditures of $43,392,959.\r\nBut it is not probable that this favorable exhibit will be shown for the\r\npresent fiscal year. Indeed, it is very doubtful whether, except with\r\ngreat economy on the part of Congress in making appropriations and the\r\nsame economy in administering the various Departments of Government,\r\nthe revenues will not fall short of meeting actual expenses, including\r\ninterest on the public debt.\r\n\r\nI commend to Congress such economy, and point out two sources where it\r\nseems to me it might commence, to wit, in the appropriations for public\r\nbuildings in the many cities where work has not yet been commenced; in\r\nthe appropriations for river and harbor improvement in those localities\r\nwhere the improvements are of but little benefit to general commerce,\r\nand for fortifications.\r\n\r\nThere is a still more fruitful source of expenditure, which I will point\r\nout later in this message. I refer to the easy method of manufacturing\r\nclaims for losses incurred in suppressing the late rebellion.\r\n\r\nI would not be understood here as opposing the erection of good,\r\nsubstantial, and even ornamental buildings by the Government wherever\r\nsuch buildings are needed. In fact, I approve of the Government owning\r\nits own buildings in all sections of the country, and hope the day is\r\nnot far distant when it will not only possess them, but will erect\r\nin the capital suitable residences for all persons who now receive\r\ncommutation for quarters or rent at Government expense, and for the\r\nCabinet, thus setting an example to the States which may induce them to\r\nerect buildings for their Senators. But I would have this work conducted\r\nat a time when the revenues of the country would abundantly justify it.\r\n\r\nThe revenues have materially fallen off for the first five months of\r\nthe present fiscal year from what they were expected to produce, owing\r\nto the general panic now prevailing, which commenced about the middle\r\nof September last. The full effect of this disaster, if it should not\r\nprove a \"blessing in disguise,\" is yet to be demonstrated. In either\r\nevent it is your duty to heed the lesson and to provide by wise and\r\nwell-considered legislation, as far as it lies in your power, against\r\nits recurrence, and to take advantage of all benefits that may have\r\naccrued.\r\n\r\nMy own judgment is that, however much individuals may have suffered, one\r\nlong step has been taken toward specie payments; that we can never have\r\npermanent prosperity until a specie basis is reached; and that a specie\r\nbasis can not be reached and maintained until our exports, exclusive\r\nof gold, pay for our imports, interest due abroad, and other specie\r\nobligations, or so nearly so as to leave an appreciable accumulation\r\nof the precious metals in the country from the products of our mines.\r\n\r\nThe development of the mines of precious metals during the past year and\r\nthe prospective development of them for years to come are gratifying in\r\ntheir results. Could but one-half of the gold extracted from the mines\r\nbe retained at home, our advance toward specie payments would be rapid.\r\n\r\nTo increase our exports sufficient currency is required to keep all the\r\nindustries of the country employed. Without this national as well as\r\nindividual bankruptcy must ensue. Undue inflation, on the other hand,\r\nwhile it might give temporary relief, would only lead to inflation\r\nof prices, the impossibility of competing in our own markets for the\r\nproducts of home skill and labor, and repeated renewals of present\r\nexperiences. Elasticity to our circulating medium, therefore, and just\r\nenough of it to transact the legitimate business of the country and to\r\nkeep all industries employed, is what is most to be desired. The exact\r\nmedium is specie, the recognized medium of exchange the world over. That\r\nobtained, we shall have a currency of an exact degree of elasticity.\r\nIf there be too much of it for the legitimate purposes of trade and\r\ncommerce, it will flow out of the country. If too little, the reverse\r\nwill result. To hold what we have and to appreciate our currency to that\r\nstandard is the problem deserving of the most serious consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the present panic has proven that the currency of the\r\ncountry, based, as it is, upon the credit of the country, is the best\r\nthat has ever been devised. Usually in times of such trials currency\r\nhas become worthless, or so much depreciated in value as to inflate the\r\nvalues of all the necessaries of life as compared with the currency.\r\nEveryone holding it has been anxious to dispose of it on any terms.\r\nNow we witness the reverse. Holders of currency hoard it as they did\r\ngold in former experiences of a like nature.\r\n\r\nIt is patent to the most casual observer that much more currency, or\r\nmoney, is required to transact the legitimate trade of the country\r\nduring the fall and winter months, when the vast crops are being\r\nremoved, than during the balance of the year. With our present system\r\nthe amount in the country remains the same throughout the entire year,\r\nresulting in an accumulation of all the surplus capital of the country\r\nin a few centers when not employed in the moving of crops, tempted\r\nthere by the offer of interest on call loans. Interest being paid,\r\nthis surplus capital must earn this interest paid with a profit. Being\r\nsubject to \"call,\" it can not be loaned, only in part at best, to the\r\nmerchant or manufacturer for a fixed term. Hence, no matter how much\r\ncurrency there might be in the country, it would be absorbed, prices\r\nkeeping pace with the volume, and panics, stringency, and disasters\r\nwould ever be recurring with the autumn. Elasticity in our monetary\r\nsystem, therefore, is the object to be attained first, and next to that,\r\nas far as possible, a prevention of the use of other people's money in\r\nstock and other species of speculation. To prevent the latter it seems\r\nto me that one great step would be taken by prohibiting the national\r\nbanks from paying interest on deposits, by requiring them to hold their\r\nreserves in their own vaults, and by forcing them into resumption,\r\nthough it would only be in legal-tender notes. For this purpose I would\r\nsuggest the establishment of clearing houses for your consideration.\r\n\r\nTo secure the former many plans have been suggested, most, if not all,\r\nof which look to me more like inflation on the one hand, or compelling\r\nthe Government, on the other, to pay interest, without corresponding\r\nbenefits, upon the surplus funds of the country during the seasons when\r\notherwise unemployed.\r\n\r\nI submit for your consideration whether this difficulty might not be\r\novercome by authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to issue at any\r\ntime to national banks of issue any amount of their own notes below\r\na fixed percentage of their issue (say 40 per cent), upon the banks'\r\ndepositing with the Treasurer of the United States an amount of\r\nGovernment bonds equal to the amount of notes demanded, the banks to\r\nforfeit to the Government, say, 4 per cent of the interest accruing on\r\nthe bonds so pledged during the time they remain with the Treasurer\r\nas security for the increased circulation, the bonds so pledged to be\r\nredeemable by the banks at their pleasure, either in whole or in part,\r\nby returning their own bills for cancellation to an amount equal\r\nto the face of the bonds withdrawn. I would further suggest for your\r\nconsideration the propriety of authorizing national banks to diminish\r\ntheir standing issue at pleasure, by returning for cancellation their\r\nown bills and withdrawing so many United States bonds as are pledged\r\nfor the bills returned.\r\n\r\nIn view of the great actual contraction that has taken place in the\r\ncurrency and the comparative contraction continuously going on, due\r\nto the increase of population, increase of manufactories and all the\r\nindustries, I do not believe there is too much of it now for the dullest\r\nperiod of the year. Indeed, if clearing houses should be established,\r\nthus forcing redemption, it is a question for your consideration whether\r\nbanking should not be made free, retaining all the safeguards now\r\nrequired to secure bill holders. In any modification of the present\r\nlaws regulating national banks, as a further step toward preparing\r\nfor resumption of specie payments, I invite your attention to a\r\nconsideration of the propriety of exacting from them the retention as a\r\npart of their reserve either the whole or a part of the gold interest\r\naccruing upon the bonds pledged as security for their issue. I have not\r\nreflected enough on the bearing this might have in producing a scarcity\r\nof coin with which to pay duties on imports to give it my positive\r\nrecommendation. But your attention is invited to the subject.\r\n\r\nDuring the last four years the currency has been contracted, directly,\r\nby the withdrawal of 3 per cent certificates, compound-interest notes,\r\nand \"seven-thirty\" bonds outstanding on the 4th of March, 1869, all of\r\nwhich took the place of legal-tenders in the bank reserves to the extent\r\nof $63,000,000.\r\n\r\nDuring the same period there has been a much larger comparative\r\ncontraction of the currency. The population of the country has largely\r\nincreased. More than 25,000 miles of railroad have been built, requiring\r\nthe active use of capital to operate them. Millions of acres of land\r\nhave been opened to cultivation, requiring capital to move the products.\r\nManufactories have multiplied beyond all precedent in the same period\r\nof time, requiring capital weekly for the payment of wages and for\r\nthe purchase of material; and probably the largest of all comparative\r\ncontraction arises from the organizing of free labor in the South. Now\r\nevery laborer there receives his wages, and, for want of savings banks,\r\nthe greater part of such wages is carried in the pocket or hoarded until\r\nrequired for use.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions are thrown out for your consideration, without any\r\nrecommendation that they shall be adopted literally, but hoping that\r\nthe best method may be arrived at to secure such an elasticity of the\r\ncurrency as will keep employed all the industries of the country and\r\nprevent such an inflation as will put off indefinitely the resumption\r\nof specie payments, an object so devoutly to be wished for by all,\r\nand by none more earnestly than the class of people most directly\r\ninterested--those who \"earn their bread by the sweat of their brow.\"\r\nThe decisions of Congress on this subject will have the hearty support\r\nof the Executive.\r\n\r\nIn previous messages I have called attention to the decline in American\r\nshipbuilding and recommended such legislation as would secure to us our\r\nproportion of the carrying trade. Stimulated by high rates and abundance\r\nof freight, the progress for the last year in shipbuilding has been very\r\nsatisfactory. There has been an increase of about 3 per cent in the\r\namount transported in American vessels over the amount of last year.\r\nWith the reduced cost of material which has taken place, it may\r\nreasonably be hoped that this progress will be maintained, and even\r\nincreased. However, as we pay about $80,000,000 per annum to foreign\r\nvessels for the transportation to a market of our surplus products, thus\r\nincreasing the balance of trade against us to this amount, the subject\r\nis one worthy of your serious consideration.\r\n\r\n\"Cheap transportation\" is a subject that has attracted the attention of\r\nboth producers and consumers for the past few years, and has contributed\r\nto, if it has not been the direct cause of, the recent panic and\r\nstringency.\r\n\r\nAs Congress, at its last session, appointed a special committee to\r\ninvestigate this whole subject during the vacation and report at this\r\nsession, I have nothing to recommend until their report is read.\r\n\r\nThere is one work, however, of a national character, in which the\r\ngreater portion of the East and the West, the North and the South, are\r\nequally interested, to which I will invite your attention.\r\n\r\nThe State of New York has a canal connecting Lake Erie with tide water\r\non the Hudson River. The State of Illinois has a similar work connecting\r\nLake Michigan with navigable water on the Illinois River, thus making\r\nwater communication inland between the East and the West and South.\r\nThese great artificial water courses are the property of the States\r\nthrough which they pass, and pay toll to those States. Would it not be\r\nwise statesmanship to pledge these States that if they will open these\r\ncanals for the passage of large vessels the General Government will look\r\nafter and keep in navigable condition the great public highways with\r\nwhich they connect, to wit, the Overslaugh on the Hudson, the St. Clair\r\nFlats, and the Illinois and Mississippi rivers? This would be a national\r\nwork; one of great value to the producers of the West and South in\r\ngiving them cheap transportation for their produce to the seaboard and\r\na market, and to the consumers in the East in giving them cheaper food,\r\nparticularly of those articles of food which do not find a foreign\r\nmarket, and the prices of which, therefore, are not regulated by foreign\r\ndemands. The advantages of such a work are too obvious for argument.\r\nI submit the subject to you, therefore, without further comment.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to regain our lost commerce and carrying trade I have\r\nheretofore called attention to the States south of us offering a field\r\nwhere much might be accomplished. To further this object I suggest\r\nthat a small appropriation be made, accompanied with authority for the\r\nSecretary of the Navy to fit out a naval vessel to ascend the Amazon\r\nRiver to the mouth of the Madeira; thence to explore that river and its\r\ntributaries into Bolivia, and to report to Congress at its next session,\r\nor as soon as practicable, the accessibility of the country by water,\r\nits resources, and the population so reached. Such an exploration would\r\ncost but little; it can do no harm, and may result in establishing a\r\ntrade of value to both nations.\r\n\r\nIn further connection with the Treasury Department I would recommend\r\na revision and codification of the tariff laws and the opening of more\r\nmints for coming money, with authority to coin for such nations as may\r\napply.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is invited to the recommendations contained\r\nin the report of the Secretary of War herewith accompanying.\r\n\r\nThe apparent great cost of supporting the Army is fully explained by\r\nthis report, and I hope will receive your attention.\r\n\r\nWhile inviting your general attention to all the recommendations made by\r\nthe Secretary of War, there are two which I would especially invite you\r\nto consider: First, the importance of preparing for war in time of peace\r\nby providing proper armament for our seacoast defenses. Proper armament\r\nis of vastly more importance than fortifications. The latter can be\r\nsupplied very speedily for temporary purposes when needed; the former\r\ncan not. The second is the necessity of reopening promotion in the staff\r\ncorps of the Army. Particularly is this necessity felt in the Medical,\r\nPay, and Ordnance departments.\r\n\r\nAt this time it is necessary to employ \"contract surgeons\" to supply the\r\nnecessary medical attendance required by the Army.\r\n\r\nWith the present force of the Pay Department it is now difficult to make\r\nthe payments to troops provided for by law. Long delays in payments are\r\nproductive of desertions and other demoralization, and the law prohibits\r\nthe payment of troops by other than regular army paymasters.\r\n\r\nThere are now sixteen vacancies in the Ordnance Department, thus leaving\r\nthat branch of the service without sufficient officers to conduct the\r\nbusiness of the different arsenals on a large scale if ever required.\r\n\r\nNAVY DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year our Navy has been depleted by the sale of some\r\nvessels no longer fit for naval service and by the condemnation of\r\nothers not yet disposed of. This, however, has been more than\r\ncompensated for by the repair of six of the old wooden ships and by the\r\nbuilding of eight new sloops of war, authorized by the last Congress.\r\nThe building of these latter has occurred at a doubly fortunate time.\r\nThey are about being completed at a time when they may possibly be much\r\nneeded, and the work upon them has not only given direct employment\r\nto thousands of men, but has no doubt been the means of keeping open\r\nestablishments for other work at a time of great financial distress.\r\n\r\nSince the commencement of the last month, however, the distressing\r\noccurrences which have taken place in the waters of the Caribbean Sea,\r\nalmost on our very seaboard, while they illustrate most forcibly the\r\nnecessity always existing that a nation situated like ours should\r\nmaintain in a state of possible efficiency a navy adequate to its\r\nresponsibilities, has at the same time demanded that all the effective\r\nforce we really have shall be put in immediate readiness for warlike\r\nservice. This has been and is being done promptly and effectively, and\r\nI am assured that all the available ships and every authorized man of\r\nthe American Navy will be ready for whatever action is required for\r\nthe safety of our citizens or the maintenance of our honor. This, of\r\ncourse, will require the expenditure in a short time of some of the\r\nappropriations which were calculated to extend through the fiscal year,\r\nbut Congress will, I doubt not, understand and appreciate the emergency,\r\nand will provide adequately not only for the present preparation, but\r\nfor the future maintenance of our naval force. The Secretary of the Navy\r\nhas during the past year been quietly putting some of our most effective\r\nmonitors in condition for service, and thus the exigency finds us in a\r\nmuch better condition for work than we could possibly have been without\r\nhis action.\r\n\r\nPOST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nA complete exhibit is presented in the accompanying report of the\r\nPostmaster-General of the operations of the Post-Office Department\r\nduring the year. The ordinary postal revenues for the fiscal year ended\r\nJune 30, 1873, amounted to $22,996,741.57, and the expenditures of\r\nall kinds to $29,084,945.67. The increase of revenues over 1872 was\r\n$1,081,315.20, and the increase of expenditures $2,426,753.36.\r\n\r\nIndependent of the payments made from special appropriations for mail\r\nsteamship lines, the amount drawn from the General Treasury to meet\r\ndeficiencies was $5,265,475. The constant and rapid extension of our\r\npostal service, particularly upon railways, and the improved facilities\r\nfor the collection, transmission, distribution, and delivery of the\r\nmails which are constantly being provided account for the increased\r\nexpenditures of this popular branch of the public service.\r\n\r\nThe total number of post-offices in operation on June 30, 1873, was\r\n33,244, a net increase of 1,381 over the number reported the preceding\r\nyear. The number of Presidential offices was 1,363, an increase of 163\r\nduring the year. The total length of railroad mail routes at the close\r\nof the year was 63,457 miles, an increase of 5,546 miles over the year\r\n1872. Fifty-nine railway post-office lines were in operation June 30,\r\n1873, extending over 14,866 miles of railroad routes and performing an\r\naggregate service of 34,925 miles daily.\r\n\r\nThe number of letters exchanged with foreign countries was 27,459,185,\r\nan increase of 3,096,685 over the previous year, and the postage thereon\r\namounted to $2,021,310.86. The total weight of correspondence exchanged\r\nin the mails with European countries exceeded 912 tens, an increase of\r\n92 tons over the previous year. The total cost of the United States\r\nocean steamship service, including $725,000 paid from special\r\nappropriations to subsidized lines of mail steamers, was $1,047,271.35.\r\n\r\nNew or additional postal conventions have been concluded with Sweden,\r\nNorway, Belgium, Germany, Canada, Newfoundland, and Japan, reducing\r\npostage rates on correspondence exchanged with those countries; and\r\nfurther efforts have been made to conclude a satisfactory postal\r\nconvention with France, but without success.\r\n\r\nI invite the favorable consideration of Congress to the suggestions\r\nand recommendations of the Postmaster-General for an extension of the\r\nfree-delivery system in all cities having a population of not less than\r\n10,000; for the prepayment of postage on newspapers and other printed\r\nmatter of the second class; for a uniform postage and limit of weight on\r\nmiscellaneous matter; for adjusting the compensation of all postmasters\r\nnot appointed by the President, by the old method of commissions on the\r\nactual receipts of the office, instead of the present mode of fixing\r\nthe salary in advance upon special returns; and especially do I urge\r\nfavorable action by Congress on the important recommendations of the\r\nPostmaster-General for the establishment of United States postal savings\r\ndepositories.\r\n\r\nYour attention is also again called to a consideration of the question\r\nof postal telegraphs and the arguments adduced in support thereof, in\r\nthe hope that you may take such action in connection therewith as in\r\nyour judgment will most contribute to the best interests of the country.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nAffairs in Utah require your early and special attention. The Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, in the case of Clinton _vs_. Englebrecht,\r\ndecided that the United States marshal of that Territory could not\r\nlawfully summon jurors for the district courts; and those courts hold\r\nthat the Territorial marshal can not lawfully perform that duty, because\r\nhe is elected by the legislative assembly, and not appointed as provided\r\nfor in the act organizing the Territory. All proceedings at law are\r\npractically abolished by these decisions, and there have been but few or\r\nno jury trials in the district courts of that Territory since the last\r\nsession of Congress. Property is left without protection by the courts,\r\nand crimes go unpunished. To prevent anarchy there it is absolutely\r\nnecessary that Congress provide the courts with some mode of obtaining\r\njurors, and I recommend legislation to that end, and also that the\r\nprobate courts of the Territory, now assuming to issue writs of\r\ninjunction and _habeas corpus_ and to try criminal cases and questions\r\nas to land titles, be denied all jurisdiction not possessed ordinarily\r\nby courts of that description.\r\n\r\nI have become impressed with the belief that the act approved March 2,\r\n1867, entitled \"An act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy\r\nthroughout the United States,\" is productive of more evil than good at\r\nthis time. Many considerations might be urged for its total repeal, but,\r\nif this is not considered advisable, I think it will not be seriously\r\nquestioned that those portions of said act providing for what is called\r\ninvoluntary bankruptcy operate to increase the financial embarrassments\r\nof the country. Careful and prudent men very often become involved in\r\ndebt in the transaction of their business, and though they may possess\r\nample property, if it could be made available for that purpose, to meet\r\nall their liabilities, yet, on account of the extraordinary scarcity\r\nof money, they may be unable to meet all their pecuniary obligations\r\nas they become due, in consequence of which they are liable to be\r\nprostrated in their business by proceedings in bankruptcy at the\r\ninstance of unrelenting creditors. People are now so easily alarmed as\r\nto monetary matters that the mere filing of a petition in bankruptcy\r\nby an unfriendly creditor will necessarily embarrass, and oftentimes\r\naccomplish the financial ruin, of a responsible business man. Those who\r\notherwise might make lawful and just arrangements to relieve themselves\r\nfrom difficulties produced by the present stringency in money are\r\nprevented by their constant exposure to attack and disappointment by\r\nproceedings against them in bankruptcy, and, besides, the law is made\r\nuse of in many cases by obdurate creditors to frighten or force debtors\r\ninto a compliance with their wishes and into acts of injustice to other\r\ncreditors and to themselves. I recommend that so much of said act as\r\nprovides for involuntary bankruptcy on account of the suspension of\r\npayment be repealed.\r\n\r\nYour careful attention is invited to the subject of claims against the\r\nGovernment and to the facilities afforded by existing laws for their\r\nprosecution. Each of the Departments of State, Treasury, and War has\r\ndemands for many millions of dollars upon its files, and they are\r\nrapidly accumulating. To these may be added those now pending before\r\nCongress, the Court of Claims, and the Southern Claims Commission,\r\nmaking in the aggregate an immense sum. Most of these grow out of the\r\nrebellion, and are intended to indemnify persons on both sides for\r\ntheir losses during the war; and not a few of them are fabricated and\r\nsupported by false testimony. Projects are on foot, it is believed, to\r\ninduce Congress to provide for new classes of claims, and to revive old\r\nones through the repeal or modification of the statute of limitations,\r\nby which they are now barred. I presume these schemes, if proposed, will\r\nbe received with little favor by Congress, and I recommend that persons\r\nhaving claims against the United States cognizable by any tribunal or\r\nDepartment thereof be required to present them at an early day, and that\r\nlegislation be directed as far as practicable to the defeat of unfounded\r\nand unjust demands upon the Government; and I would suggest, as a means\r\nof preventing fraud, that witnesses be called upon to appear in person\r\nto testify before those tribunals having said claims before them for\r\nadjudication. Probably the largest saving to the National Treasury can\r\nbe secured by timely legislation on these subjects of any of the\r\neconomic measures that will be proposed.\r\n\r\nYou will be advised of the operations of the Department of Justice by\r\nthe report of the Attorney-General, and I invite your attention to the\r\namendments of existing laws suggested by him, with the view of reducing\r\nthe expenses of that Department.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nThe policy inaugurated toward the Indians at the beginning of the\r\nlast Administration has been steadily pursued, and, I believe, with\r\nbeneficial results. It will be continued with only such modifications\r\nas time and experience may demonstrate as necessary.\r\n\r\nWith the encroachment of civilization upon the Indian reservations and\r\nhunting grounds, disturbances have taken place between the Indians and\r\nwhites during the past year, and probably will continue to do so until\r\neach race appreciates that the other has rights which must be respected.\r\n\r\nThe policy has been to collect the Indians as rapidly as possible on\r\nreservations, and as far as practicable within what is known as the\r\nIndian Territory, and to teach them the arts of civilization and\r\nself-support. Where found off their reservations, and endangering the\r\npeace and safety of the whites, they have been punished, and will\r\ncontinue to be for like offenses.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Territory south of Kansas and west of Arkansas is sufficient\r\nin area and agricultural resources to support all the Indians east of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. In time, no doubt, all of them, except a few who\r\nmay elect to make their homes among white people, will be collected\r\nthere. As a preparatory step for this consummation, I am now satisfied\r\nthat a Territorial form of government should be given them, which will\r\nsecure the treaty rights of the original settlers and protect their\r\nhomesteads from alienation for a period of twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Patent Office are growing to such a magnitude and\r\nthe accumulation of material is becoming so great that the necessity of\r\nmore room is becoming more obvious day by day. I respectfully invite\r\nyour attention to the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and\r\nCommissioner of Patents on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe business of the General Land Office exhibits a material increase\r\nin all its branches during the last fiscal year. During that time\r\nthere were disposed of out of the public lands 13,030,606 acres, being\r\nan amount greater by 1,165,631 acres than was disposed of during the\r\npreceding year. Of the amount disposed of, 1,626,266 acres were sold for\r\ncash, 214,940 acres were located with military land warrants, 3,793,612\r\nacres were taken for homesteads, 653,446 acres were located with\r\nagricultural-college scrip, 6,083,536 acres were certified by railroads,\r\n76,576 acres were granted to wagon roads, 238,548 acres were approved\r\nto States as swamp lands, 138,681 acres were certified for agricultural\r\ncolleges, common schools, universities, and seminaries, 190,775 acres\r\nwere approved to States for internal improvements, and 14,222 acres\r\nwere located with Indian scrip. The cash receipts during the same time\r\nwere $3,408,515.50, being $190,415.50 in excess of the receipts of the\r\nprevious year. During the year 30,488,132 acres of public land were\r\nsurveyed, an increase over the amount surveyed the previous year of\r\n1,037,193 acres, and, added to the area previously surveyed, aggregates\r\n616,554,895 acres which have been surveyed, leaving 1,218,443,505 acres\r\nof the public land still unsurveyed.\r\n\r\nThe increased and steadily increasing facilities for reaching our\r\nunoccupied public domain and for the transportation of surplus products\r\nenlarge the available field for desirable homestead locations, thus\r\nstimulating settlement and extending year by year in a gradually\r\nincreasing ratio the area of occupation and cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe expressed desire of the representatives of a large colony of\r\ncitizens of Russia to emigrate to this country, as is understood, with\r\nthe consent of their Government, if certain concessions can be made to\r\nenable them to settle in a compact colony, is of great interest, as\r\ngoing to show the light in which our institutions are regarded by an\r\nindustrious, intelligent, and wealthy people, desirous of enjoying civil\r\nand religious liberty; and the acquisition of so large an immigration of\r\ncitizens of a superior class would without doubt be of substantial\r\nbenefit to the country. I invite attention to the suggestion of the\r\nSecretary of the Interior in this behalf.\r\n\r\nThere was paid during the last fiscal year for pensions, including the\r\nexpense of disbursement, $29,185,289.62, being an amount less by\r\n$984,050.98 than was expended for the same purpose the preceding year.\r\nAlthough this statement of expenditures would indicate a material\r\nreduction in amount compared with the preceding year, it is believed\r\nthat the changes in the pension laws at the last session of Congress\r\nwill absorb that amount the current year. At the close of the last\r\nfiscal year there were on the pension rolls 99,804 invalid military\r\npensioners and 112,088 widows, orphans, and dependent relatives of\r\ndeceased soldiers, making a total of that class of 211,892; 18,266\r\nsurvivors of the War of 1812 and 5,053 widows of soldiers of that war\r\npensioned under the act of Congress of February 14, 1871, making a total\r\nof that class of 23,319; 1,430 invalid navy pensioners and 1,770 widows,\r\norphans, and dependent relatives of deceased officers, sailors, and\r\nmarines of the Navy, making a total of navy pensioners of 3,200, and\r\na grand total of pensioners of all classes of 238,411, showing a net\r\nincrease during the last fiscal year of 6,182. During the last year the\r\nnames of 16,405 pensioners were added to the rolls, and 10,223 names\r\nwere dropped therefrom for various causes.\r\n\r\nThe system adopted for the detection of frauds against the Government in\r\nthe matter of pensions has been productive of satisfactory results, but\r\nlegislation is needed to provide, if possible, against the perpetration\r\nof such frauds in future.\r\n\r\nThe evidently increasing interest in the cause of education is a most\r\nencouraging feature in the general progress and prosperity of the\r\ncountry, and the Bureau of Education is earnest in its efforts to give\r\nproper direction to the new appliances and increased facilities which\r\nare being offered to aid the educators of the country in their great\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe Ninth Census has been completed, the report thereof published\r\nand distributed, and the working force of the Bureau disbanded. The\r\nSecretary of the Interior renews his recommendation for a census to be\r\ntaken in 1875, to which subject the attention of Congress is invited.\r\nThe original suggestion in that behalf has met with the general approval\r\nof the country; and even if it be not deemed advisable at present to\r\nprovide for a regular quinquennial census, a census taken in 1875,\r\nthe report of which could be completed and published before the one\r\nhundredth anniversary of our national independence, would be especially\r\ninteresting and valuable, as showing the progress of the country during\r\nthe first century of our national existence. It is believed, however,\r\nthat a regular census every five years would be of substantial benefit\r\nto the country, inasmuch as our growth hitherto has been so rapid that\r\nthe results of the decennial census are necessarily unreliable as a\r\nbasis of estimates for the latter years of a decennial period.\r\n\r\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\r\n\r\nUnder the very efficient management of the governor and the board of\r\npublic works of this District the city of Washington is rapidly assuming\r\nthe appearance of a capital of which the nation may well be proud.\r\nFrom being a most unsightly place three years ago, disagreeable to\r\npass through in summer in consequence of the dust arising from unpaved\r\nstreets, and almost impassable in the winter from the mud, it is now one\r\nof the most sightly cities in the country, and can boast of being the\r\nbest paved.\r\n\r\nThe work has been done systematically, the plans, grades, location of\r\nsewers, water and gas mains being determined upon before the work was\r\ncommenced, thus securing permanency when completed. I question whether\r\nso much has ever been accomplished before in any American city for the\r\nsame expenditures. The Government having large reservations in the\r\ncity, and the nation at large having an interest in their capital,\r\nI recommend a liberal policy toward the District of Columbia, and that\r\nthe Government should bear its just share of the expense of these\r\nimprovements. Every citizen visiting the capital feels a pride in its\r\ngrowing beauty, and that he too is part owner in the investments made\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to Congress the propriety of promoting the establishment\r\nin this District of an institution of learning, or university of the\r\nhighest class, by the donation of lands. There is no place better suited\r\nfor such an institution than the national capital. There is no other\r\nplace in which every citizen is so directly interested.\r\n\r\nCIVIL-SERVICE REFORM.\r\n\r\nIn three successive messages to Congress I have called attention to the\r\nsubject of \"civil-service reform.\"\r\n\r\nAction has been taken so far as to authorize the appointment of a board\r\nto devise rules governing methods of making appointments and promotions,\r\nbut there never has been any action making these rules, or any rules,\r\nbinding, or even entitled to observance, where persons desire the\r\nappointment of a friend or the removal of an official who may be\r\ndisagreeable to them.\r\n\r\nTo have any rules effective they must have the acquiescence of Congress\r\nas well as of the Executive. I commend, therefore, the subject to your\r\nattention, and suggest that a special committee of Congress might confer\r\nwith the Civil-Service Board during the present session for the purpose\r\nof devising such rules as can be maintained, and which will secure the\r\nservices of honest and capable officials, and which will also protect\r\nthem in a degree of independence while in office.\r\n\r\nProper rules will protect Congress, as well as the Executive, from much\r\nneedless persecution, and will prove of great value to the public at\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nI would recommend for your favorable consideration the passage of an\r\nenabling act for the admission of Colorado as a State in the Union.\r\nIt possesses all the elements of a prosperous State, agricultural and\r\nmineral, and, I believe, has a population now to justify such admission.\r\nIn connection with this I would also recommend the encouragement of a\r\ncanal for purposes of irrigation from the eastern slope of the Rocky\r\nMountains to the Missouri River. As a rule I am opposed to further\r\ndonations of public lands for internal improvements owned and controlled\r\nby private corporations, but in this instance I would make an exception.\r\nBetween the Missouri River and the Rocky Mountains there is an arid belt\r\nof public land from 300 to 500 miles in width, perfectly valueless for\r\nthe occupation of man, for the want of sufficient rain to secure the\r\ngrowth of any product. An irrigating canal would make productive a belt\r\nas wide as the supply of water could be made to spread over across this\r\nentire country, and would secure a cordon of settlements connecting the\r\npresent population of the mountain and mining regions with that of the\r\nolder States. All the land reclaimed would be clear gain. If alternate\r\nsections are retained by the Government, I would suggest that the\r\nretained sections be thrown open to entry under the homestead laws,\r\nor sold to actual settlers for a very low price.\r\n\r\nI renew my previous recommendation to Congress for general amnesty. The\r\nnumber engaged in the late rebellion yet laboring under disabilities is\r\nvery small, but enough to keep up a constant irritation. No possible\r\ndanger can accrue to the Government by restoring them to eligibility to\r\nhold office.\r\n\r\nI suggest for your consideration the enactment of a law to better secure\r\nthe civil rights which freedom should secure, but has not effectually\r\nsecured, to the enfranchised slave.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 2, 1873_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to Congress a report, dated the 2d instant, with\r\naccompanying papers,[76] received from the Secretary of State, in\r\ncompliance with the requirements of the sixteenth and eighteenth\r\nsections of the act entitled \"An act to regulate the diplomatic and\r\nconsular systems of the United States,\" approved August 18, 1856.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: Report of fees collected, etc., by consular officers of the\r\nUnited States for 1872, list of consular officers and their official\r\nresidences, and tariff of consular fees.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 5, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the consideration of the Senate with a view to\r\nratification, a convention for the surrender of criminals between the\r\nUnited States of America and the Republic of Honduras, which was signed\r\nat Comayagua on the 4th day of June, 1873.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 5, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn my annual message of December last I gave reason to expect that when\r\nthe full and accurate text of the correspondence relating to the steamer\r\n_Virginius_, which had been telegraphed in cipher, should be received\r\nthe papers concerning the capture of the vessel, the execution of a part\r\nof its passengers and crew, and the restoration of the ship and the\r\nsurvivors would be transmitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the expectations then held out, I now transmit the\r\npapers and correspondence on that subject.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th day of September, 1870, the _Virginius_ was registered in\r\nthe custom-house at New York as the property of a citizen of the United\r\nStates, he having first made oath, as required by law, that he was \"the\r\ntrue and only owner of the said vessel, and that there was no subject or\r\ncitizen of any foreign prince or state, directly or indirectly, by way\r\nof trust, confidence, or otherwise, interested therein.\"\r\n\r\nHaving complied with the requisites of the statute in that behalf, she\r\ncleared in the usual way for the port of Curaçoa, and on or about the\r\n4th day of October, 1870, sailed for that port. It is not disputed that\r\nshe made the voyage according to her clearance, nor that from that day\r\nto this she has not returned within the territorial jurisdiction of the\r\nUnited States. It is also understood that she preserved her American\r\npapers, and that when within foreign ports she made the practice of\r\nputting forth a claim to American nationality, which was recognized by\r\nthe authorities at such ports.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, she left the port of Kingston, in October last, under\r\nthe flag of the United States, she would appear to have had, as against\r\nall powers except the United States, the right to fly that flag and to\r\nclaim its protection, as enjoyed by all regularly documented vessels\r\nregistered as part of our commercial marine.\r\n\r\nNo state of war existed conferring upon a maritime power the right to\r\nmolest and detain upon the high seas a documented vessel, and it can not\r\nbe pretended that the _Virginius_ had placed herself without the pale of\r\nall law by acts of piracy against the human race.\r\n\r\nIf her papers were irregular or fraudulent, the offense was one against\r\nthe laws of the United States, justiciable only in their tribunals.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, it became known that the _Virginius_ had been captured\r\non the high seas by a Spanish man-of-war; that the American flag had\r\nbeen hauled down by the captors; that the vessel had been carried to a\r\nSpanish port, and that Spanish tribunals were taking jurisdiction over\r\nthe persons of those found on her, and exercising that jurisdiction upon\r\nAmerican citizens, not only in violation of the rules of international\r\nlaw, but in contravention of the provisions of the treaty of 1795,\r\nI directed a demand to be made upon Spain for the restoration of the\r\nvessel and for the return of the survivors to the protection of the\r\nUnited States, for a salute to the flag, and for the punishment of the\r\noffending parties.\r\n\r\nThe principles upon which these demands rested could not be seriously\r\nquestioned, but it was suggested by the Spanish Government that there\r\nwere grave doubts whether the _Virginius_ was entitled to the character\r\ngiven her by her papers, and that therefore it might be proper for the\r\nUnited States, after the surrender of the vessel and the survivors, to\r\ndispense with the salute to the flag, should such fact be established to\r\ntheir satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to be reasonable and just. I therefore assented to it, on\r\nthe assurance that Spain would then declare that no insult to the flag\r\nof the United States had been intended.\r\n\r\nI also authorized an agreement to be made that should it be shown to the\r\nsatisfaction of this Government that the _Virginius_ was improperly\r\nbearing the flag proceedings should be instituted in our courts for the\r\npunishment of the offense committed against the United States. On her\r\npart Spain undertook to proceed against those who had offended the\r\nsovereignty of the United States, or who had violated their treaty\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nThe surrender of the vessel and the survivors to the jurisdiction of the\r\ntribunals of the United States was an admission of the principles upon\r\nwhich our demands had been founded. I therefore had no hesitation in\r\nagreeing to the arrangement finally made between the two Governments--an\r\narrangement which was moderate and just, and calculated to cement the\r\ngood relations which have so long existed between Spain and the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nUnder this agreement the _Virginius_, with the American flag flying, was\r\ndelivered to the Navy of the United States at Bahia Honda, in the island\r\nof Cuba, on the 16th ultimo. She was then in an unseaworthy condition.\r\nIn the passage to New York she encountered one of the most tempestuous\r\nof our winter storms. At the risk of their lives the officers and crew\r\nplaced in charge of her attempted to keep her afloat. Their efforts were\r\nunavailing, and she sank off Cape Fear. The prisoners who survived the\r\nmassacres were surrendered at Santiago de Cuba on the 18th ultimo, and\r\nreached the port of New York in safety.\r\n\r\nThe evidence submitted on the part of Spain to establish the fact that\r\nthe _Virginius_ at the time of her capture was improperly bearing the\r\nflag of the United States is transmitted herewith, together with the\r\nopinion of the Attorney-General thereon and a copy of the note of the\r\nSpanish minister, expressing on behalf of his Government a disclaimer\r\nof an intent of indignity to the flag of the United States.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 5, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the consideration of the Senate with a view to\r\nratification, a convention between the United States of America and the\r\nRepublic of Salvador, which was signed at San Salvador on the 12th of\r\nMay last, stipulating for an extension of the period for exchanging the\r\nratifications of the treaty of amity, commerce, and consular privileges\r\nconcluded between the two countries on the 6th December, 1870.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 5, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the consideration of the Senate with a view to\r\nratification, a convention between the United States of America and\r\nthe Republic of Salvador, which was signed at San Salvador on the\r\n12th of May last, for an extension of the period for exchanging the\r\nratifications of the treaty for the extradition of criminals concluded\r\nbetween the two countries on the 23d of May, 1870.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 6, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate an \"agreement,\" signed at Lima on the 5th of\r\nJune last by Mr. Francis Thomas, envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary of the United States, and Mr. José de la Riva Aguero,\r\nminister for foreign affairs of Peru, providing for an extension of the\r\ntime for the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty of friendship,\r\ncommerce, and navigation and the treaty of extradition between the\r\nUnited States and Peru of the 6th and 12th of September, 1870,\r\nrespectively. The limit of the proposed extension is to be nine months\r\nfrom the time when the Senate of the United States may approve thereof.\r\nThe expediency of this approval is consequently submitted to the\r\nconsideration of the Senate. The instruments themselves were approved by\r\nthat body on the 31st of March, 1871, and they were ratified by me in\r\norder that our ratifications might be ready for exchange for those of\r\nPeru. The omission of the latter seasonably to perform that act is\r\nunderstood to have been occasioned solely by the delay in the meeting\r\nof the Congress of that Republic, whose sanction, pursuant to its\r\nconstitution, was necessary.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, January 7, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn reply to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 15th\r\nof last December, requesting a revision of the estimates for the\r\nexpenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1875, I\r\nhave the honor to transmit herewith amended estimates and replies from\r\nthe several Departments.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 8, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the act of Congress approved March 3, 1873, entitled\r\n\"An act to authorize inquiries into the causes of steam-boiler\r\nexplosions,\" I directed the Secretaries of the Treasury and Navy\r\nDepartments to create a commission to conduct the experiments and\r\ncollect the information contemplated by the act. Such a commission was\r\ncreated, and I have the honor to submit herewith a report of the result\r\nof their labors to the present time.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 13, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nSince nominating the Hon.

Thacher, United States delegate to the\r\nInternational Patent Congress held at Vienna in August, 1873, and\r\nexhibits.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 19, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith a memorial upon the \"cultivation\r\nof timber and the preservation of forests,\" and a draft of a joint\r\nresolution prepared by the American Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience, together with a communication from the Commissioner of the\r\nGeneral Land Office upon the same subject.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, February 25, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor herewith to submit the report of the Centennial\r\nCommissioners, and to add a word in the way of recommendation.\r\n\r\nThere have now been international expositions held by three of the great\r\npowers of Europe. It seems fitting that the one hundredth anniversary of\r\nour independence should be marked by an event that will display to the\r\nworld the growth and progress of a nation devoted to freedom and to the\r\npursuit of fame, fortune, and honors by the lowest citizen as well as\r\nthe highest. A failure in this enterprise would be deplorable. Success\r\ncan be assured by arousing public opinion to the importance of the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nTo secure this end, in my judgment, Congressional legislation is\r\nnecessary to make the exposition both national and international.\r\n\r\nThe benefits to be derived from a successful international exposition\r\nare manifold. It will necessarily be accompanied by expenses beyond the\r\nreceipts from the exposition itself, but they will be compensated for\r\nmany fold by the commingling of people from all sections of our own\r\ncountry; by bringing together the people of different nationalities; by\r\nbringing into juxtaposition, for ready examination, our own and foreign\r\nskill and progress in manufactures, agriculture, art, science, and\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe selection of the site for the exposition seems to me appropriate,\r\nfrom the fact that one hundred years before the date fixed for the\r\nexposition the Declaration of Independence, which launched us into the\r\ngalaxy of nations as an independent people, emanated from the same spot.\r\n\r\nWe have much in our varied climate, soil, mineral products, and skill of\r\nwhich advantage can be taken by other nationalities to their profit.\r\nIn return they will bring to our shores works of their skill and\r\nfamiliarize our people with them, to the mutual advantage of all\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nLet us have a complete success in our Centennial Exposition or suppress\r\nit in its infancy, acknowledging our inability to give it the\r\ninternational character to which our self-esteem aspires.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, D.C., March 4, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith replies from the several\r\nDepartments, in answer to a resolution of the House of Representatives\r\nof the 16th of January last, requesting a list of all expenses incurred\r\nby the various Departments for transportation of any matter which before\r\nthe abolition of the franking privilege was carried in the mails.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 20, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration of the Senate and with a view\r\nto its ratification, a convention concluded between the United States\r\nand Belgium on the 19th March, 1874, concerning extradition.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 23, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith the report of the board of\r\ncommissioners on the irrigation of the San Joaquin, Tulare, and\r\nSacramento valleys, of the State of California, and also the original\r\nmaps accompanying said report.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, April 18, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nHerewith I transmit the report of the Civil Service Commission\r\nauthorized by the act of Congress of March 3, 1871, and invite your\r\nspecial attention thereto.\r\n\r\nIf sustained by Congress, I have no doubt the rules can, after the\r\nexperience gained, be so improved and enforced as to still more\r\nmaterially benefit the public service and relieve the Executive, members\r\nof Congress, and the heads of Departments from influences prejudicial to\r\ngood administration.\r\n\r\nThe rules, as they have heretofore been enforced, have resulted\r\nbeneficially, as is shown by the opinions of the members of the Cabinet\r\nand their subordinates in the Departments, and in that opinion I concur;\r\nbut rules applicable to officers who are to be appointed by and with the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate are in great measure impracticable,\r\nexcept in so far as they may be sustained by the action of that body.\r\nThis must necessarily remain so unless the direct sanction of the Senate\r\nis given to the rules.\r\n\r\nI advise for the present only such appropriation as may be adequate to\r\ncontinue the work in its present form, and would leave to the future\r\nto determine whether the direct sanction of Congress should be given\r\nto rules that may, perhaps, be devised for regulating the method of\r\nselection of appointees, or a portion of them, who need to be confirmed\r\nby the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe same amount appropriated last year would be adequate for the coming\r\nyear, but I think the public interest would be promoted by authority\r\nin the Executive for allowing a small compensation for special service\r\nperformed beyond usual office hours, under the act of 1871, to persons\r\nalready in the service of the Government.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 21, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate and House of Representatives a\r\ncommunication from the Secretary of State and the report by which it is\r\naccompanied, upon Samoan or Navigators Islands.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, April 23, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the papers called for by the resolution of the House\r\nof Representatives of the 20th instant, requesting all correspondence by\r\ntelegraph or otherwise between the persons claiming to be governor of\r\nArkansas and myself relating to the troubles in that State, together\r\nwith copies of any order or directions given by me or under my direction\r\nto the military officer in charge of the garrison or in command of the\r\nUnited States troops at Little Rock.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, April 28, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith additional correspondence received\r\nsince my communication of the 23d instant, in reply to the resolution of\r\nthe House of Representatives of the 20th instant, requesting copies of\r\ncorrespondence between persons claiming to be governor of Arkansas and\r\nmyself relating to troubles in that State.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, April 30, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 15th instant, requesting to be informed \"what geographical and\r\ngeological surveys under different Departments and branches of the\r\nGovernment are operating in the same and contiguous areas of territory\r\nwest of the Mississippi River, and whether it be not practicable to\r\nconsolidate them under one Department or to define the geographical\r\nlimits to be embraced by each,\" I have the honor to transmit herewith\r\nthe views of the officers of the War and Interior Departments on the\r\nsubjects named in the said resolution, and invite attention thereto.\r\n\r\nWhere surveys are made with the view of sectionizing the public lands,\r\npreparatory to opening them for settlement or entry, there is no\r\nquestion but such surveys and all work connected therewith should be\r\nunder the direct control of the Interior Department or the Commissioner\r\nof the General Land Office, subject to the supervision of the Secretary\r\nof the Interior. But where the object is to complete the map of the\r\ncountry; to determine the geographical, astronomical, geodetic,\r\ntopographic, hydrographic, meteorological, geological, and mineralogical\r\nfeatures of the country--in other words, to collect full information of\r\nthe unexplored or but partially known portions of the country--it seems\r\nto me a matter of no importance as to which Department of the Government\r\nshould have control of the work. The conditions which should control\r\nthis subject are, in my judgment, first, which Department is prepared\r\nto do the work best; second, which can do it the most expeditiously\r\nand economically.\r\n\r\nAs the country to be explored is occupied in great part by uncivilized\r\nIndians, all parties engaged in the work at hand must be supplied with\r\nescorts from the Army, thus placing a large portion of the expense upon\r\nthe War Department; and as the Engineer Corps of the Army is composed of\r\nscientific gentlemen, educated and practiced for just the kind of work\r\nto be done, and as they are under pay whether employed in this work or\r\nnot, it would seem that the second condition named would be more fully\r\ncomplied with by employing them to do the work. There is but little\r\ndoubt that they will accomplish it as promptly and as well, and much\r\nmore economically.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 19, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in answer to the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 9th instant, a report[79] from the Secretary of\r\nState, with accompanying papers.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: Relating to the involuntary deportation to the United\r\nStates of foreign convicts, paupers, idiots, insane persons, etc., and\r\ntransmitting correspondence relative thereto.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 25, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the Senate of the 15th instant, I have\r\nthe honor to transmit herewith \"all papers and correspondence relating\r\nto the troubles in the State of Arkansas not heretofore communicated to\r\neither House of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 25, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit, in response to the resolution of the\r\nSenate of the 18th instant, requesting \"the answers in full received\r\nby the Civil Service Commission in reply to their circular addressed\r\nto the various heads of Departments and bureaus requesting a report as\r\nto the operation and effect of the civil-service rules in the several\r\nDepartments and offices,\" a copy of a letter received from the chairman\r\nof the Civil Service Commission, to whom the resolution was referred.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 26, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, and\r\naccompanying it copies of all papers on file or on record in the\r\nDepartment of State respecting the claim on Brazil concerning the\r\n_Caroline_.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 26, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate and House of Representatives a\r\ncommunication from the Secretary of State and a copy of the report of\r\nthe commissioners to inquire into depredations on the frontiers of Texas,\r\nby which it is accompanied.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 15, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the consideration of the Senate with a view to\r\nratification, a declaration respecting trade-marks between the United\r\nStates and the Emperor of Russia, concluded and signed at St. Petersburg\r\non the 16/28 day of March last.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 18, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe plenipotentiaries of Her Britannic Majesty at Washington have\r\nsubmitted to the Secretary of State, for my consideration, a draft of a\r\ntreaty for the reciprocal regulation of the commerce and trade between\r\nthe United States and Canada, with provisions for the enlargement of the\r\nCanadian canals and for their use by United States vessels on terms of\r\nequality with British vessels. I transmit herewith a report from the\r\nSecretary of State, with a copy of the draft thus proposed.\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion that a proper treaty for such purposes would result\r\nbeneficially for the United States. It would not only open or enlarge\r\nmarkets for our products, but it would increase the facilities of\r\ntransportation from the grain-growing States of the West to the\r\nseaboard.\r\n\r\nThe proposed draft has many features to commend it to our favorable\r\nconsideration; but whether it makes all the concessions which could\r\njustly be required of Great Britain, or whether it calls for more\r\nconcessions from the United States than we should yield, I am not\r\nprepared to say.\r\n\r\nAmong its provisions are articles proposing to dispense with the\r\narbitration respecting the fisheries, which was provided for by the\r\ntreaty of Washington, in the event of the conclusion and ratification of\r\na treaty and the passage of all the necessary legislation to enforce it.\r\n\r\nThese provisions, as well as other considerations, make it desirable\r\nthat this subject should receive attention before the close of the\r\npresent session. I therefore express an earnest wish that the Senate may\r\nbe able to consider and determine before the adjournment of Congress\r\nwhether it will give its constitutional concurrence to the conclusion of\r\na treaty with Great Britain for the purposes already named, either in\r\nsuch form as is proposed by the British plenipotentiaries or in such\r\nother more acceptable form as the Senate may prefer.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 18, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State and its\r\naccompanying papers.[80]\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: Report of the United States delegates to the eighth session\r\nof the International Statistical Congress, held at St. Petersburg,\r\nRussia, in August, 1872, and appendix.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, June 20, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI respectfully invite the attention of Congress to one feature of the\r\nbill entitled \"An act for the government of the District of Columbia,\r\nand for other purposes.\" Provision is therein made for the payment of\r\nthe debts of the District in bonds to be issued by the sinking-fund\r\ncommissioners, running fifty years and bearing interest at the rate of\r\n3.65 per cent per annum, with the payment of the principal and interest\r\nguaranteed by the United States.\r\n\r\nThe government by which these debts were created is abolished, and no\r\nother provision seems to be made for their payment. Judging from the\r\ntransactions in other bonds, there are good grounds, in my opinion, for\r\nthe apprehension that bonds bearing this rate of interest when issued\r\nwill be worth much less than their equivalent in the current money of\r\nthe United States. This appears to me to be unjust to those to whom\r\nthese bonds are to be paid, and, to the extent of the difference between\r\ntheir face and real value, looks like repudiating the debts of the\r\nDistrict. My opinion is that to require creditors of the District of\r\nColumbia to receive these bonds at par when it is apparent that to be\r\nconverted into money they must be sold at a large discount will not only\r\nprove greatly injurious to the credit of the District, but will reflect\r\nunfavorably upon the credit and good faith of the United States.\r\n\r\nI would recommend, therefore, that provision be made at the present\r\nsession of Congress to increase the interest upon these bonds, so that\r\nwhen sold they will bring an equivalent in money, and that the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury be authorized to negotiate the sale of these bonds at\r\nnot less than par and pay the proceeds thereof to those who may be\r\nascertained to have valid claims against the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, April 10, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to herewith return to you without my approval House\r\nbill No. 1224, entitled \"An act for the relief of William H. Denniston,\r\nlate an acting second lieutenant, Seventieth New York Volunteers,\"\r\nfor the reasons set forth in the accompanying letter of the Secretary\r\nof War.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, _Washington, D.C., April 8, 1874_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to return House bill No. 1224, \"for the relief of\r\nWilliam H. Denniston, late an acting second lieutenant, Seventieth New\r\nYork Volunteers,\" with the remark that the name of William H. Denniston,\r\nas an officer or private, is not borne on any rolls of the Seventieth\r\nNew York Volunteers on file in the Department. Of this fact the\r\nCommittee on Military Affairs of the House of Representatives was\r\ninformed by letter from the Adjutant-General's Office dated December\r\n19, 1873.\r\n\r\nNo vacancy existed in Company D (the company claimed) of this regiment\r\nfor a second lieutenant during the period claimed, Second Lieutenant\r\nJ.B. Zeigler having filled that position to May 6, 1862, and Second\r\nLieutenant James Stevenson from that date to June 25, 1862. On\r\nregimental return for July, 1862, Edward Shields is reported promoted\r\nsecond lieutenant June 15, 1862.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence in the Department that he actually served as a\r\nsecond lieutenant for the time covered by the bill herewith, and it is\r\ntherefore respectfully recommended that the bill be returned to the\r\nHouse of Representatives without approval.\r\n\r\nWhen the records of the War Department, prepared under laws and\r\nregulations having in view the establishment and preservation of data\r\nnecessary to the protection of the public interests as well as that of\r\nthe claimants, fail to show service, it is a subject of importance to\r\nlegalize a claim wherein the military department of the Government\r\nhas not seen the order under which the alleged service may have been\r\nclaimed. A precedent of the kind is beyond doubt an injury to the public\r\ninterest, and will tend to other special acts of relief under which\r\nthousands of muster rolls certified at the date, under the Articles of\r\nWar, as exhibiting the true state of the command will be invalidated,\r\nand large appropriations of money will be required to settle claims the\r\njustness of which can not always be determined at a date so remote from\r\ntheir origin.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nWM. W. BELKNAP,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 22, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHerewith I return Senate bill No. 617, entitled \"An act to fix the\r\namount of United States notes and the circulation of national banks,\r\nand for other purposes,\" without my approval.\r\n\r\nIn doing so I must express my regret at not being able to give my assent\r\nto a measure which has received the sanction of a majority of the\r\nlegislators chosen by the people to make laws for their guidance, and\r\nI have studiously sought to find sufficient arguments to justify such\r\nassent, but unsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nPractically it is a question whether the measure under discussion would\r\ngive an additional dollar to the irredeemable paper currency of the\r\ncountry or not, and whether by requiring three-fourths of the reserve to\r\nbe retained by the banks and prohibiting interest to be received on the\r\nbalance it might not prove a contraction.\r\n\r\nBut the fact can not be concealed that theoretically the bill increases\r\nthe paper circulation $100,000,000, less only the amount of reserves\r\nrestrained from circulation by the provision of the second section. The\r\nmeasure has been supported on the theory that it would give increased\r\ncirculation. It is a fair inference, therefore, that if in practice the\r\nmeasure should fail to create the abundance of circulation expected of\r\nit the friends of the measure, particularly those out of Congress, would\r\nclamor for such inflation as would give the expected relief.\r\n\r\nThe theory, in my belief, is a departure from true principles of\r\nfinance, national interest, national obligations to creditors,\r\nCongressional promises, party pledges (on the part of both political\r\nparties), and of personal views and promises made by me in every annual\r\nmessage sent to Congress and in each inaugural address.\r\n\r\nIn my annual message to Congress in December, 1869, the following\r\npassages appear:\r\n\r\n  Among the evils growing out of the rebellion, and not yet referred to,\r\n  is that of an irredeemable currency. It is an evil which I hope will\r\n  receive your most earnest attention. It is a duty, and one of the\r\n  highest duties, of Government to secure to the citizen a medium of\r\n  exchange of fixed, unvarying value. This implies a return to a specie\r\n  basis, and no substitute for it can be devised. It should be commenced\r\n  now and reached at the earliest practicable moment consistent with a\r\n  fair regard to the interests of the debtor class. Immediate resumption,\r\n  if practicable, would not be desirable. It would compel the debtor\r\n  class to pay, beyond their contracts, the premium on gold at the date\r\n  of their purchase, and would bring bankruptcy and ruin to thousands.\r\n  Fluctuation, however, in the paper value of the measure of all values\r\n  (gold) is detrimental to the interests of trade. It makes the man of\r\n  business an involuntary gambler, for in all sales where future payment\r\n  is to be made both parties speculate as to what will be the value of\r\n  the currency to be paid and received. I earnestly recommend to you,\r\n  then, such legislation as will insure a gradual return to specie\r\n  payments and put an immediate stop to fluctuations in the value of\r\n  currency.\r\n\r\n\r\nI still adhere to the views then expressed.\r\n\r\nAs early as December 4, 1865, the House of Representatives passed a\r\nresolution, by a vote of 144 yeas to 6 nays, concurring \"in the views\r\nof the Secretary of the Treasury in relation to the necessity of a\r\ncontraction of the currency, with a view to as early a resumption of\r\nspecie payments as the business interests of the country will permit,\"\r\nand pledging \"cooperative action to this end as speedily as possible.\"\r\n\r\nThe first act passed by the Forty-first Congress, [approved] on the 18th\r\nday of March, 1869, was as follows:\r\n\r\n  AN ACT to strengthen the public credit.\r\n\r\n  _Be it enacted, etc._, That in order to remove any doubt as to the\r\n  purpose of the Government to discharge all just obligations to the\r\n  public creditors, and to settle conflicting questions and\r\n  interpretations of the law by virtue of which such obligations have\r\n  been contracted, it is hereby provided and declared that the faith of\r\n  the United States is solemnly pledged to the payment in coin or its\r\n  equivalent of all the obligations of the United States not bearing\r\n  interest, known as United States notes, and all the interest-bearing\r\n  obligations of the United States, except in cases where the law\r\n  authorizing the issue of any such obligation has expressly provided that\r\n  the same may be paid in lawful money or in other currency than gold and\r\n  silver; but none of the said interest-bearing obligations not already\r\n  due shall be redeemed or paid before maturity unless at such time United\r\n  States notes shall be convertible into coin at the option of the holder,\r\n  or unless at such time bonds of the United States bearing a lower rate\r\n  of interest than the bonds to be redeemed can be sold at par in coin.\r\n  And the United States also solemnly pledges its faith to make provision\r\n  at the earliest practicable period for the redemption of the United\r\n  States notes in coin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis act still remains as a continuing pledge of the faith of the United\r\nStates \"to make provision at the earliest practicable period for the\r\nredemption of the United States notes in coin.\"\r\n\r\nA declaration contained in the act of June 30, 1864, created an\r\nobligation that the total amount of United States notes issued or\r\nto be issued should never exceed $400,000,000. The amount in actual\r\ncirculation was actually reduced to $356,000,000, at which point\r\nCongress passed the act of February 4, 1868, suspending the further\r\nreduction of the currency. The forty-four millions have ever been\r\nregarded as a reserve, to be used only in case of emergency, such as\r\nhas occurred on several occasions, and must occur when from any cause\r\nrevenues suddenly fall below expenditures; and such a reserve is\r\nnecessary, because the fractional currency, amounting to fifty millions,\r\nis redeemable in legal tender on call.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that such a return of fractional currency for redemption\r\nis impossible; but let steps be taken for a return to a specie basis and\r\nit will be found that silver will take the place of fractional currency\r\nas rapidly as it can be supplied, when the premium on gold reaches a\r\nsufficiently low point. With the amount of United States notes to be\r\nissued permanently fixed within proper limits and the Treasury so\r\nstrengthened as to be able to redeem them in coin on demand it will then\r\nbe safe to inaugurate a system of free banking with such provisions as\r\nto make compulsory redemption of the circulating notes of the banks in\r\ncoin, or in United States notes, themselves redeemable and made\r\nequivalent to coin.\r\n\r\nAs a measure preparatory to free banking, and for placing the Government\r\nin a condition to redeem its notes in coin \"at the earliest practicable\r\nperiod,\" the revenues of the country should be increased so as to pay\r\ncurrent expenses, provide for the sinking fund required by law, and also\r\na surplus to be retained in the Treasury in gold.\r\n\r\nI am not a believer in any artificial method of making paper money equal\r\nto coin when the coin is not owned or held ready to redeem the promises\r\nto pay, for paper money is nothing more than promises to pay, and is\r\nvaluable exactly in proportion to the amount of coin that it can be\r\nconverted into. While coin is not used as a circulating medium, or the\r\ncurrency of the country is not convertible into it at par, it becomes an\r\narticle of commerce as much as any other product. The surplus will seek\r\na foreign market as will any other surplus. The balance of trade has\r\nnothing to do with the question. Duties on imports being required in\r\ncoin creates a limited demand for gold. About enough to satisfy that\r\ndemand remains in the country. To increase this supply I see no way open\r\nbut by the Government hoarding through the means above given, and\r\npossibly by requiring the national banks to aid.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by the advocates of the measure herewith returned that\r\nthere is an unequal distribution of the banking capital of the country.\r\nI was disposed to give great weight to this view of the question at\r\nfirst, but on reflection it will be remembered that there still remains\r\n$4,000,000 of authorized bank-note circulation assigned to States having\r\nless than their quota not yet taken. In addition to this the States\r\nhaving less than their quota of bank circulation have the option of\r\ntwenty-five millions more to be taken from those States having more than\r\ntheir proportion. When this is all taken up, or when specie payments are\r\nfully restored or are in rapid process of restoration, will be the time\r\nto consider the question of \"more currency.\"\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, May 12, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without my signature House bill No. 1331, entitled\r\n\"An act for the relief of Joab Spencer and James R.

At the latter date the bill appears to\r\nhave been pending in the Senate, of which fact this Department at that\r\ntime was not informed.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th instant the engrossed bill (H.R. No. 1331) was received by\r\nreference from the Executive Office, and forwarded to the Commissioner\r\nof Indian Affairs for a further report on the subject, and on the 6th\r\ninstant that officer returned said bill to this Department with a letter\r\npresenting his views in relation to the matter and suggesting that the\r\nrights of the Indians and of Messrs. Spencer & Mead would be fully\r\nprotected by a modification of the bill authorizing the Secretary of the\r\nInterior to pay such amount of their claim as might be found to be due.\r\nThe suggestion meets the approval of this Department.\r\n\r\nCopies of the papers connected with this claim are herewith\r\nsubmitted.[81] I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nB.R.

Such is the object of the arrangements\r\nwhich follow:\r\n\r\nThe domicile of any person residing upon the Ottoman soil being\r\ninviolable, and as no one can enter it without the consent of the\r\nowner, except by virtue of orders emanating from competent authority\r\nand with the assistance of the magistrate or functionary invested with\r\nthe necessary powers, the residence of foreigners is inviolable on the\r\nsame principle, in conformity with the treaties, and the agents of the\r\npublic force can not enter it without the assistance of the consul or\r\nof the delegate of the consul of the power on which the foreigner\r\ndepends.\r\n\r\nBy residence we understand the house of inhabitation and its\r\ndependencies; that is to say, the outhouses, courts, gardens, and\r\nneighboring inclosures, to the exclusion of all other parts of the\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nIn the localities distant by less than nine hours' journey from the\r\nconsular residence, the agents of the public force can not enter the\r\nresidence of a foreigner without the assistance of a consul, as was\r\nbefore said.\r\n\r\nOn his part the consul is bound to give his immediate assistance to the\r\nlocal authority so as not to let six hours elapse between the moment\r\nwhich he may be informed and the moment of his departure or the\r\ndeparture of his delegate, so that the action of the authorities may\r\nnever be suspended more than twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nIn the localities distant by nine hours or more than nine hours of\r\ntravel from the residence of the consular agent, the agents of the\r\npublic force may, on the request of the local authority, and with the\r\nassistance of three members of the council of the elders of the commune,\r\nenter into the residence of a foreigner without being assisted by the\r\nconsular agent, but only in case of urgency and for the search and the\r\nproof of the crime of murder, of attempt at murder, of incendiarism, of\r\narmed robbery either with infraction or by night in an inhabited house,\r\nof armed rebellion, and of the fabrication of counterfeit money; and\r\nthis entry may be made whether the crime was committed by a foreigner or\r\nby an Ottoman subject, and whether it took place in the residence of a\r\nforeigner or not in his residence, or in any other place.\r\n\r\nThese regulations are not applicable but to the parts of the real estate\r\nwhich constitute the residence, as it has been heretofore defined.\r\n\r\nBeyond the residence the action of the police shall be exercised freely\r\nand without reserve; but in case a person charged with crime or offense\r\nshould be arrested, and the accused shall be a foreigner, the immunities\r\nattached to his person shall be observed in respect to him.\r\n\r\nThe functionary or the officer charged with the accomplishment of a\r\ndomiciliary visit in the exceptional circumstances determined before,\r\nand the members of the council of elders who shall assist him, will be\r\nobliged to make out a _procès verbal_ of the domiciliary visit and to\r\ncommunicate it immediately to the superior authority under whose\r\njurisdiction they are, and the latter shall transmit it to the nearest\r\nconsular agent without delay.\r\n\r\nA special regulation will be promulgated by the Sublime Porte to\r\ndetermine the mode of action of the local police in the several cases\r\nprovided heretofore.\r\n\r\nIn localities more distant than nine hours' travel from the residence\r\nof the consular agent, in which the law of the judicial organization\r\nof the _velayet_ may be in force, foreigners shall be tried without the\r\nassistance of the consular delegate by the council of elders fulfilling\r\nthe function of justices of the peace, and by the tribunal of the\r\ncanton, as well for actions not exceeding 1,000 piasters as for offenses\r\nentailing a fine of 500 piasters only at the maximum.\r\n\r\nForeigners shall have in any case the right of appeal to the tribunal of\r\nthe arrondissement against the judgments issued as above stated, and the\r\nappeal shall be followed and judged with the assistance of the consul in\r\nconformity with the treaties.\r\n\r\nThe appeal shall always suspend the execution of a sentence.\r\n\r\nIn all cases the forcible execution of the judgments, issued on the\r\nconditions determined heretofore, shall not take place without the\r\ncooperation of the consul or of his delegate.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Government will enact a law which shall determine the rules\r\nof procedure to be observed by the parties in the application of the\r\npreceding regulations.\r\n\r\nForeigners, in whatever locality they may be, may freely submit\r\nthemselves to the jurisdiction of the council of elders or of the\r\ntribunal of the canton without the assistance of the consul in cases\r\nwhich do not exceed the competency of these councils or tribunals,\r\nreserving always the right of appeal before the tribunal of the\r\narrondissement, where the case may be brought and tried with the\r\nassistance of the consul or his delegate.\r\n\r\nThe consent of a foreigner to be tried as above stated, without the\r\nassistance of his consul, shall always be given in writing and in\r\nadvance of all procedure.\r\n\r\nIt is well understood that all these restrictions do not concern cases\r\nwhich have for their object questions of real estate, which shall be\r\ntried and determined under the conditions established by the law.\r\n\r\nThe right of defense and the publicity of the hearings shall be assured\r\nin all cases to foreigners who may appear before the Ottoman tribunals,\r\nas well as to Ottoman subjects.\r\n\r\nThe preceding dispositions shall remain in force until the revision of\r\nthe ancient treaties, a revision which the Sublime Porte reserves to\r\nitself the right to bring about hereafter by an understanding between it\r\nand the friendly powers.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof the respective plenipotentiaries have signed the\r\nprotocol and have affixed thereto their seals.\r\n\r\nDone at Constantinople the 11th of August, 1874.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.] (Signed) A.

Foreigners are admitted by the same privilege as Ottoman\r\nsubjects, and without any other restriction, to enjoy the right of\r\nholding real estate, whether in the city or the country, throughout the\r\nEmpire, with the exception of the Province of the Hédjaz, by submitting\r\nthemselves to the laws and the regulations which govern Ottoman subjects\r\nas is hereafter stated.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement does not concern subjects of Ottoman birth who have\r\nchanged their nationality, who shall be governed in this matter by a\r\nspecial law.\r\n\r\nART. II. Foreigners, proprietors of real estate in town or in country,\r\nare in consequence placed upon terms of equality with Ottoman subjects\r\nin all things that concern their landed property.\r\n\r\nThe legal effect of this equality is--\r\n\r\nFirst. To oblige them to conform to all the laws and regulations of the\r\npolice or of the municipality which govern at present or may govern\r\nhereafter the enjoyment, the transmission, the alienation, and the\r\nhypothecation of landed property.\r\n\r\nSecond. To pay all charges and taxes, under whatever form or\r\ndenomination they may be, that are levied, or may be levied hereafter,\r\nupon city or country property.\r\n\r\nThird. To render them directly amenable to the Ottoman civil tribunals\r\nin all questions relating to landed property and in all real actions,\r\nwhether as plaintiffs or as defendants, even when either party is a\r\nforeigner. In short, they are in all things to hold real estate by the\r\nsame title, on the same condition, and under the same forms as Ottoman\r\nowners, and without being able to avail themselves of their personal\r\nnationality, except under the reserve of the immunities attached to\r\ntheir persons and their movable goods, according to the treaties.\r\n\r\nART. III. In case of the bankruptcy of a foreigner possessing real\r\nestate, the assignees of the bankrupt may apply to the authorities and\r\nto the Ottoman civil tribunals requiring the sale of the real estate\r\npossessed by the bankrupt, and which by its nature and according to law\r\nis responsible for the debts of the owner.\r\n\r\nThe same course shall be followed when a foreigner shall have obtained\r\nagainst another foreigner owning real estate a judgment of condemnation\r\nbefore a foreign tribunal.\r\n\r\nFor the execution of this judgment against the real estate of his debtor\r\nhe shall apply to the competent Ottoman authorities in order to obtain\r\nthe sale of that real estate which is responsible for the debts of the\r\nowner; and this judgment shall be executed by the Ottoman authorities\r\nand tribunals only after they have decided that the real estate of which\r\nthe sale is required really belongs to the category of that property\r\nwhich may be sold for the payment of debt.\r\n\r\nART. IV.

The following order has been received from the President of the\r\nUnited States:\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, March 9, 1874_.\r\n\r\nIt is with deep regret that the President announces to the people of\r\nthe United States the death of Millard Fillmore, one of his honored\r\npredecessors, who died at Buffalo, N.Y., last evening.\r\n\r\nThe long-continued and useful public service and eminent purity of\r\ncharacter of the deceased ex-President will be remembered beyond the\r\ndays of mourning in which a nation will be thrown by the event which\r\nis thus announced.\r\n\r\nAs a mark of respect to his memory, it is ordered that the Executive\r\nMansion and the several Departments at Washington be draped in mourning\r\nuntil the close of the day on which the funeral shall take place, and\r\nthat all business be suspended on the day of the funeral.\r\n\r\nIt is further ordered that the War and Navy Departments cause suitable\r\nmilitary and naval honors to be paid on the occasion to the memory of\r\nthe eminent citizen whose life is now closed.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  HAMILTON FISH,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. In compliance with the President's instructions, the troops will be\r\nparaded at 10 o'clock a.m. on the day after the receipt of this order at\r\neach military post, when the order will be read to them, and the labors\r\nof that day will thereafter cease.\r\n\r\nThe national flag will be displayed at half-staff.\r\n\r\nAt dawn of day thirteen guns will be fired, and afterwards at intervals\r\nof thirty minutes between the rising and setting sun a single gun, and\r\nat the close of the day a national salute of thirty-seven guns.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Army will wear crape on the left arm and on their\r\nswords and the colors of the several regiments will be put in mourning\r\nfor the period of thirty days.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of War:\r\n  E.D. TOWNSEND,\r\n    _Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL ORDER.\r\n\r\nNAVY DEPARTMENT, _Washington, March 9, 1874_.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States announces the death of ex-President\r\nMillard Fillmore in the following order:\r\n\r\n[For order see preceding page.]\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the foregoing order, it is hereby directed that the\r\nensign at each naval station and of each vessel of the United States\r\nNavy in commission be hoisted at half-mast from sunrise to sunset, and\r\nthat a gun be fired at intervals of every half hour from sunrise to\r\nsunset at each naval station and on board of flagships and of vessels\r\nacting singly, on Thursday, the 12th instant, the day of the funeral,\r\nwhere this order may be received in time, otherwise on the day after\r\nits receipt.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Navy and Marine Corps will wear the usual badge of\r\nmourning attached to the sword hilt and on the left arm for the period\r\nof thirty days.\r\n\r\nGEO. M. ROBESON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of the Navy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, D.C., May 27, 1874_.\r\n\r\nSIR:[82] The President directs me to say that the several Departments of\r\nthe Government will be closed on the 30th instant, in order to enable\r\nthe employees to participate in the decoration of the graves of the\r\nsoldiers who fell during the rebellion.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nO.E.

Speculation as to the causes for this\r\nprostration might be indulged in without profit, because as many\r\ntheories would be advanced as there would be independent writers--those\r\nwho expressed their own views without borrowing--upon the subject.\r\nWithout indulging in theories as to the cause of this prostration,\r\ntherefore, I will call your attention only to the fact, and to some\r\nplain questions as to which it would seem there should be no\r\ndisagreement.\r\n\r\nDuring this prostration two essential elements of prosperity have been\r\nmost abundant--labor and capital. Both have been largely unemployed.\r\nWhere security has been undoubted, capital has been attainable at\r\nvery moderate rates. Where labor has been wanted, it has been found\r\nin abundance, at cheap rates compared with what--of necessaries and\r\ncomforts of life--could be purchased with the wages demanded. Two great\r\nelements of prosperity, therefore, have not been denied us. A third\r\nmight be added: Our soil and climate are unequaled, within the limits\r\nof any contiguous territory under one nationality, for its variety of\r\nproducts to feed and clothe a people and in the amount of surplus to\r\nspare to feed less favored peoples. Therefore, with these facts in view,\r\nit seems to me that wise statesmanship, at this session of Congress,\r\nwould dictate legislation ignoring the past; directing in proper\r\nchannels these great elements of prosperity to any people. Debt, debt\r\nabroad, is the only element that can, with always a sound currency,\r\nenter into our affairs to cause any continued depression in the\r\nindustries and prosperity of our people.\r\n\r\nA great conflict for national existence made necessary, for\r\ntemporary purposes, the raising of large sums of money from whatever\r\nsource attainable. It made it necessary, in the wisdom of Congress--and\r\nI do not doubt their wisdom in the premises, regarding the necessity\r\nof the times--to devise a system of national currency which it proved\r\nto be impossible to keep on a par with the recognized currency of\r\nthe civilized world. This begot a spirit of speculation involving an\r\nextravagance and luxury not required for the happiness or prosperity\r\nof a people, and involving, both directly and indirectly, foreign\r\nindebtedness. The currency, being of fluctuating value, and therefore\r\nunsafe to hold for legitimate transactions requiring money, became a\r\nsubject of speculation within itself. These two causes, however, have\r\ninvolved us in a foreign indebtedness, contracted in good faith by\r\nborrower and lender, which should be paid in coin, and according to the\r\nbond agreed upon when the debt was contracted--gold or its equivalent.\r\nThe good faith of the Government can not be violated toward creditors\r\nwithout national disgrace. But our commerce should be encouraged;\r\nAmerican shipbuilding and carrying capacity increased; foreign markets\r\nsought for products of the soil and manufactories, to the end that\r\nwe may be able to pay these debts. Where a new market can be created\r\nfor the sale of our products, either of the soil, the mine, or the\r\nmanufactory, a new means is discovered of utilizing our idle capital and\r\nlabor to the advantage of the whole people. But, in my judgment, the\r\nfirst step toward accomplishing this object is to secure a currency of\r\nfixed, stable value; a currency good wherever civilization reigns; one\r\nwhich, if it becomes superabundant with one people, will find a market\r\nwith some other; a currency which has as its basis the labor necessary\r\nto produce it, which will give to it its value. Gold and silver are\r\nnow the recognized medium of exchange the civilized world over, and to\r\nthis we should return with the least practicable delay. In view of the\r\npledges of the American Congress when our present legal-tender system\r\nwas adopted, and debt contracted, there should be no delay--certainly\r\nno unnecessary delay--in fixing by legislation a method by which we\r\nwill return to specie. To the accomplishment of this end I invite your\r\nspecial attention. I believe firmly that there can be no prosperous\r\nand permanent revival of business and industries until a policy is\r\nadopted--with legislation to carry it out--looking to a return to a\r\nspecie basis. It is easy to conceive that the debtor and speculative\r\nclasses may think it of value to them to make so-called money abundant\r\nuntil they can throw a portion of their burdens upon others. But even\r\nthese, I believe, would be disappointed in the result if a course should\r\nbe pursued which will keep in doubt the value of the legal-tender medium\r\nof exchange. A revival of productive industry is needed by all classes;\r\nby none more than the holders of property, of whatever sort, with debts\r\nto liquidate from realization upon its sale. But admitting that these\r\ntwo classes of citizens are to be benefited by expansion, would it be\r\nhonest to give it? Would not the general loss be too great to justify\r\nsuch relief? Would it not be just as honest and prudent to authorize\r\neach debtor to issue his own legal-tenders to the extent of his\r\nliabilities? Than to do this, would it not be safer, for fear of\r\noverissues by unscrupulous creditors, to say that all debt obligations\r\nare obliterated in the United States, and now we commence anew, each\r\npossessing all he has at the time free from incumbrance? These\r\npropositions are too absurd to be entertained for a moment by thinking\r\nor honest people. Yet every delay in preparation for final resumption\r\npartakes of this dishonesty, and is only less in degree as the hope is\r\nheld out that a convenient season will at last arrive for the good work\r\nof redeeming our pledges to commence. It will never come, in my opinion,\r\nexcept by positive action by Congress, or by national disasters which\r\nwill destroy, for a time at least, the credit of the individual and the\r\nState at large. A sound currency might be reached by total bankruptcy\r\nand discredit of the integrity of the nation and of individuals.\r\nI believe it is in the power of Congress at this session to devise such\r\nlegislation as will renew confidence, revive all the industries, start\r\nus on a career of prosperity to last for many years and to save the\r\ncredit of the nation and of the people. Steps toward the return to a\r\nspecie basis are the great requisites to this devoutly to be sought\r\nfor end. There are others which I may touch upon hereafter.\r\n\r\nA nation dealing in a currency below that of specie in value labors\r\nunder two great disadvantages: First, having no use for the world's\r\nacknowledged medium of exchange, gold and silver, these are driven out\r\nof the country because there is no need for their use; second, the\r\nmedium of exchange in use being of a fluctuating value--for, after all,\r\nit is only worth just what it will purchase of gold and silver, metals\r\nhaving an intrinsic value just in proportion to the honest labor it\r\ntakes to produce them--a larger margin must be allowed for profit by the\r\nmanufacturer and producer. It is months from the date of production to\r\nthe date of realization. Interest upon capital must be charged, and\r\nrisk of fluctuation in the value of that which is to be received in\r\npayment added. Hence high prices, acting as a protection to the foreign\r\nproducer, who receives nothing in exchange for the products of his skill\r\nand labor except a currency good, at a stable value, the world over.\r\nIt seems to me that nothing is clearer than that the greater part of\r\nthe burden of existing prostration, for the want of a sound financial\r\nsystem, falls upon the working man, who must after all produce the\r\nwealth, and the salaried man, who superintends and conducts business.\r\nThe burden falls upon them in two ways--by the deprivation of employment\r\nand by the decreased purchasing power of their salaries. It is the duty\r\nof Congress to devise the method of correcting the evils which are\r\nacknowledged to exist, and not mine. But I will venture to suggest two\r\nor three things which seem to me as absolutely necessary to a return to\r\nspecie payments, the first great requisite in a return to prosperity.\r\nThe legal-tender clause to the law authorizing the issue of currency\r\nby the National Government should be repealed, to take effect as to\r\nall contracts entered into after a day fixed in the repealing act--not\r\nto apply, however, to payments of salaries by Government, or for other\r\nexpenditures now provided by law to be paid in currency, in the interval\r\npending between repeal and final resumption. Provision should be made\r\nby which the Secretary of the Treasury can obtain gold as it may become\r\nnecessary from time to time from the date when specie redemption\r\ncommences. To this might and should be added a revenue sufficiently in\r\nexcess of expenses to insure an accumulation of gold in the Treasury\r\nto sustain permanent redemption.\r\n\r\nI commend this subject to your careful consideration, believing that a\r\nfavorable solution is attainable, and if reached by this Congress that\r\nthe present and future generations will ever gratefully remember it as\r\ntheir deliverer from a thraldom of evil and disgrace.\r\n\r\nWith resumption, free banking may be authorized with safety, giving the\r\nsame full protection to bill holders which they have under existing\r\nlaws. Indeed, I would regard free banking as essential. It would give\r\nproper elasticity to the currency. As more currency should be required\r\nfor the transaction of legitimate business, new banks would be started,\r\nand in turn banks would wind up their business when it was found that\r\nthere was a superabundance of currency. The experience and judgment of\r\nthe people can best decide just how much currency is required for the\r\ntransaction of the business of the country. It is unsafe to leave the\r\nsettlement of this question to Congress, the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nor the Executive. Congress should make the regulation under which banks\r\nmay exist, but should not make banking a monopoly by limiting the amount\r\nof redeemable paper currency that shall be authorized. Such importance\r\ndo I attach to this subject, and so earnestly do I commend it to your\r\nattention, that I give it prominence by introducing it at the beginning\r\nof this message.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year nothing has occurred to disturb the general\r\nfriendly and cordial relations of the United States with other powers.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence submitted herewith between this Government and its\r\ndiplomatic representatives, as also with the representatives of other\r\ncountries, shows a satisfactory condition of all questions between the\r\nUnited States and the most of those countries, and with few exceptions,\r\nto which reference is hereafter made, the absence of any points of\r\ndifference to be adjusted.\r\n\r\nThe notice directed by the resolution of Congress of June 17, 1874,\r\nto be given to terminate the convention of July 17, 1858, between\r\nthe United States and Belgium has been given, and the treaty will\r\naccordingly terminate on the 1st day of July, 1875. This convention\r\nsecured to certain Belgian vessels entering the ports of the United\r\nStates exceptional privileges which are not accorded to our own vessels.\r\nOther features of the convention have proved satisfactory, and have\r\ntended to the cultivation of mutually beneficial commercial intercourse\r\nand friendly relations between the two countries. I hope that\r\nnegotiations which have been invited will result in the celebration\r\nof another treaty which may tend to the interests of both countries.\r\n\r\nOur relations with China continue to be friendly. During the past year\r\nthe fear of hostilities between China and Japan, growing out of the\r\nlanding of an armed force upon the island of Formosa by the latter,\r\nhas occasioned uneasiness. It is earnestly hoped, however, that the\r\ndifficulties arising from this cause will be adjusted, and that the\r\nadvance of civilization in these Empires may not be retarded by a state\r\nof war. In consequence of the part taken by certain citizens of the\r\nUnited States in this expedition, our representatives in those countries\r\nhave been instructed to impress upon the Governments of China and Japan\r\nthe firm intention of this country to maintain strict neutrality in the\r\nevent of hostilities, and to carefully prevent any infraction of law on\r\nthe part of our citizens.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject I call the attention of Congress to\r\na generally conceded fact--that the great proportion of the Chinese\r\nimmigrants who come to our shores do not come voluntarily, to make their\r\nhomes with us and their labor productive of general prosperity, but come\r\nunder contracts with headmen, who own them almost absolutely. In a worse\r\nform does this apply to Chinese women. Hardly a perceptible percentage\r\nof them perform any honorable labor, but they are brought for shameful\r\npurposes, to the disgrace of the communities where settled and to the\r\ngreat demoralization of the youth of those localities. If this evil\r\npractice can be legislated against, it will be my pleasure as well\r\nas duty to enforce any regulation to secure so desirable an end.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that negotiations between the Government of Japan and the\r\ntreaty powers, looking to the further opening of the Empire and to the\r\nremoval of various restrictions upon trade and travel, may soon produce\r\nthe results desired, which can not fail to inure to the benefit of all\r\nthe parties. Having on previous occasions submitted to the consideration\r\nof Congress the propriety of the release of the Japanese Government from\r\nthe further payment of the indemnity under the convention of October 22,\r\n1864, and as no action had been taken thereon, it became my duty to\r\nregard the obligations of the convention as in force; and as the other\r\npowers interested had received their portion of the indemnity in full,\r\nthe minister of the United States in Japan has, in behalf of this\r\nGovernment, received the remainder of the amount due to the United\r\nStates under the convention of Simonosaki. I submit the propriety of\r\napplying the income of a part, if not of the whole, of this fund to the\r\neducation in the Japanese language of a number of young men to be under\r\nobligations to serve the Government for a specified time as interpreters\r\nat the legation and the consulates in Japan. A limited number of\r\nJapanese youths might at the same time be educated in our own\r\nvernacular, and mutual benefits would result to both Governments.\r\nThe importance of having our own citizens, competent and familiar with\r\nthe language of Japan, to act as interpreters and in other capacities\r\nconnected with the legation and the consulates in that country can not\r\nreadily be overestimated.\r\n\r\nThe amount awarded to the Government of Great Britain by the mixed\r\ncommission organized under the provisions of the treaty of Washington in\r\nsettlement of the claims of British subjects arising from acts committed\r\nbetween April 13, 1861, and April 9, 1865, became payable, under the\r\nterms of the treaty, within the past year, and was paid upon the 21st\r\nday of September, 1874. In this connection I renew my recommendation,\r\nmade at the opening of the last session of Congress, that a special\r\ncourt be created to hear and determine all claims of aliens against\r\nthe United States arising from acts committed against their persons or\r\nproperty during the insurrection. It appears equitable that opportunity\r\nshould be offered to citizens of other states to present their claims,\r\nas well as to those British subjects whose claims were not admissible\r\nunder the late commission, to the early decision of some competent\r\ntribunal. To this end I recommend the necessary legislation to organize\r\na court to dispose of all claims of aliens of the nature referred to in\r\nan equitable and satisfactory manner, and to relieve Congress and the\r\nDepartments from the consideration of these questions.\r\n\r\nThe legislation necessary to extend to the colony of Newfoundland\r\ncertain articles of the treaty of Washington of the 8th day of May,\r\n1871, having been had, a protocol to that effect was signed in behalf of\r\nthe United States and of Great Britain on the 28th day of May last, and\r\nwas duly proclaimed on the following day. A copy of the proclamation[84]\r\nis submitted herewith.\r\n\r\nA copy of the report of the commissioner appointed under the act of\r\nMarch 19, 1872, for surveying and marking the boundary between the\r\nUnited States and the British possessions from the Lake of the Woods to\r\nthe summit of the Rocky Mountains is herewith transmitted. I am happy\r\nto announce that the field work of the commission has been completed,\r\nand the entire line from the northwest corner of the Lake of the Woods\r\nto the summit of the Rocky Mountains has been run and marked upon\r\nthe surface of the earth. It is believed that the amount remaining\r\nunexpended of the appropriation made at the last session of Congress\r\nwill be sufficient to complete the office work. I recommend that the\r\nauthority of Congress be given to the use of the unexpended balance of\r\nthe appropriation in the completion of the work of the commission in\r\nmaking its report and preparing the necessary maps.\r\n\r\nThe court known as the Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims, created\r\nby an act of Congress of the last session, has organized and commenced\r\nits work, and it is to be hoped that the claims admissible under the\r\nprovisions of the act may be speedily ascertained and paid.\r\n\r\nIt has been deemed advisable to exercise the discretion conferred upon\r\nthe Executive at the last session by accepting the conditions required\r\nby the Government of Turkey for the privilege of allowing citizens of\r\nthe United States to hold real estate in the former country, and by\r\nassenting to a certain change in the jurisdiction of courts in the\r\nlatter. A copy of the proclamation[85] upon these subjects is herewith\r\ncommunicated.\r\n\r\nThere has been no material change in our relations with the independent\r\nStates of this hemisphere which were formerly under the dominion of\r\nSpain. Marauding on the frontiers between Mexico and Texas still\r\nfrequently takes place, despite the vigilance of the civil and military\r\nauthorities in that quarter. The difficulty of checking such trespasses\r\nalong the course of a river of such length as the Rio Grande, and so\r\noften fordable, is obvious. It is hoped that the efforts of this\r\nGovernment will be seconded by those of Mexico to the effectual\r\nsuppression of these acts of wrong.\r\n\r\nFrom a report upon the condition of the business before the American and\r\nMexican Joint Claims Commission, made by the agent on the part of the\r\nUnited States, and dated October 28, 1874, it appears that of the 1,017\r\nclaims filed on the part of citizens of the United States, 483 had been\r\nfinally decided and 75 were in the hands of the umpire, leaving 462 to\r\nbe disposed of; and of the 998 claims filed against the United States,\r\n726 had been finally decided, 1 was before the umpire, and 271 remained\r\nto be disposed of. Since the date of such report other claims have been\r\ndisposed of, reducing somewhat the number still pending; and others have\r\nbeen passed upon by the arbitrators. It has become apparent, in view of\r\nthese figures and of the fact that the work devolving on the umpire is\r\nparticularly laborious, that the commission will be unable to dispose of\r\nthe entire number of claims pending prior to the 1st day of February,\r\n1875--the date fixed for its expiration. Negotiations are pending\r\nlooking to the securing of the results of the decisions which have been\r\nreached and to a further extension of the commission for a limited time,\r\nwhich it is confidently hoped will suffice to bring all the business now\r\nbefore it to a final close.\r\n\r\nThe strife in the Argentine Republic is to be deplored, both on account\r\nof the parties thereto and from the probable effects on the interests of\r\nthose engaged in the trade to that quarter, of whom the United States\r\nare among the principal. As yet, so far as I am aware, there has been no\r\nviolation of our neutrality rights, which, as well as our duties in that\r\nrespect, it shall be my endeavor to maintain and observe.\r\n\r\nIt is with regret I announce that no further payment has been received\r\nfrom the Government of Venezuela on account of awards in favor of\r\ncitizens of the United States. Hopes have been entertained that if that\r\nRepublic could escape both foreign and civil war for a few years its\r\ngreat natural resources would enable it to honor its obligations. Though\r\nit is now understood to be at peace with other countries, a serious\r\ninsurrection is reported to be in progress in an important region of\r\nthat Republic. This may be taken advantage of as another reason to delay\r\nthe payment of the dues of our citizens.\r\n\r\nThe deplorable strife in Cuba continues without any marked change\r\nin the relative advantages of the contending forces. The insurrection\r\ncontinues, but Spain has gained no superiority. Six years of strife give\r\nto the insurrection a significance which can not be denied. Its duration\r\nand the tenacity of its adherence, together with the absence of\r\nmanifested power of suppression on the part of Spain, can not be\r\ncontroverted, and may make some positive steps on the part of other\r\npowers a matter of self-necessity. I had confidently hoped at this\r\ntime to be able to announce the arrangement of some of the important\r\nquestions between this Government and that of Spain, but the\r\nnegotiations have been protracted. The unhappy intestine dissensions of\r\nSpain command our profound sympathy, and must be accepted as perhaps\r\na cause of some delay. An early settlement, in part at least, of the\r\nquestions between the Governments is hoped. In the meantime, awaiting\r\nthe results of immediately pending negotiations, I defer a further and\r\nfuller communication on the subject of the relations of this country\r\nand Spain.\r\n\r\nI have again to call the attention of Congress to the unsatisfactory\r\ncondition of the existing laws with reference to expatriation and the\r\nelection of nationality. Formerly, amid conflicting opinions and\r\ndecisions, it was difficult to exactly determine how far the doctrine of\r\nperpetual allegiance was applicable to citizens of the United States.\r\nCongress by the act of the 27th of July, 1868, asserted the abstract\r\nright of expatriation as a fundamental principle of this Government.\r\nNotwithstanding such assertion and the necessity of frequent application\r\nof the principle, no legislation has been had defining what acts or\r\nformalities shall work expatriation or when a citizen shall be deemed\r\nto have renounced or to have lost his citizenship. The importance of\r\nsuch definition is obvious. The representatives of the United States in\r\nforeign countries are continually called upon to lend their aid and the\r\nprotection of the United States to persons concerning the good faith or\r\nthe reality of whose citizenship there is at least great question.\r\nIn some cases the provisions of the treaties furnish some guide; in\r\nothers it seems left to the person claiming the benefits of citizenship,\r\nwhile living in a foreign country, contributing in no manner to the\r\nperformance of the duties of a citizen of the United States, and without\r\nintention at any time to return and undertake those duties, to use the\r\nclaims to citizenship of the United States simply as a shield from the\r\nperformance of the obligations of a citizen elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe status of children born of American parents residing in a foreign\r\ncountry, of American women who have married aliens, of American citizens\r\nresiding abroad where such question is not regulated by treaty, are all\r\nsources of frequent difficulty and discussion. Legislation on these\r\nand similar questions, and particularly defining when and under what\r\ncircumstances expatriation can be accomplished or is to be presumed, is\r\nespecially needed. In this connection I earnestly call the attention of\r\nCongress to the difficulties arising from fraudulent naturalization.\r\nThe United States wisely, freely, and liberally offers its citizenship\r\nto all who may come in good faith to reside within its limits on their\r\ncomplying with certain prescribed reasonable and simple formalities and\r\nconditions. Among the highest duties of the Government is that to afford\r\nfirm, sufficient, and equal protection to all its citizens, whether\r\nnative born or naturalized. Care should be taken that a right carrying\r\nwith it such support from the Government should not be fraudulently\r\nobtained, and should be bestowed only upon full proof of a compliance\r\nwith the law; and yet frequent instances are brought to the attention\r\nof the Government of illegal and fraudulent naturalization and of the\r\nunauthorized use of certificates thus improperly obtained. In some cases\r\nthe fraudulent character of the naturalization has appeared upon the\r\nface of the certificate itself; in others examination discloses that the\r\nholder had not complied with the law, and in others certificates have\r\nbeen obtained where the persons holding them not only were not entitled\r\nto be naturalized, but had not even been within the United States at the\r\ntime of the pretended naturalization. Instances of each of these classes\r\nof fraud are discovered at our legations, where the certificates of\r\nnaturalization are presented either for the purpose of obtaining\r\npassports or in demanding the protection of the legation. When the fraud\r\nis apparent on the face of such certificates, they are taken up by the\r\nrepresentatives of the Government and forwarded to the Department of\r\nState. But even then the record of the court in which the fraudulent\r\nnaturalization occurred remains, and duplicate certificates are readily\r\nobtainable. Upon the presentation of these for the issue of passports or\r\nin demanding protection of the Government, the fraud sometimes escapes\r\nnotice, and such certificates are not infrequently used in transactions\r\nof business to the deception and injury of innocent parties. Without\r\nplacing any additional obstacles in the way of the obtainment of\r\ncitizenship by the worthy and well-intentioned foreigner who comes in\r\ngood faith to cast his lot with ours, I earnestly recommend further\r\nlegislation to punish fraudulent naturalization and to secure the ready\r\ncancellation of the record of every naturalization made in fraud.\r\n\r\nSince my last annual message the exchange has been made of the\r\nratification of treaties of extradition with Belgium, Ecuador, Peru, and\r\nSalvador; also of a treaty of commerce and navigation with Peru, and one\r\nof commerce and consular privileges with Salvador; all of which have\r\nbeen duly proclaimed, as has also a declaration with Russia with\r\nreference to trade-marks.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury, which by law is made\r\ndirectly to Congress, and forms no part of this message, will show the\r\nreceipts and expenditures of the Government for the last fiscal year,\r\nthe amount received from each source of revenue, and the amount paid\r\nout for each of the Departments of Government, It will be observed from\r\nthis report that the amount of receipts over expenditures has been but\r\n$2,344,882.30 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1874, and that for the\r\ncurrent fiscal year the estimated receipts over expenditures will not\r\nmuch exceed $9,000,000. In view of the large national debt existing and\r\nthe obligation to add 1 per cent per annum to the sinking fund, a sum\r\namounting now to over $34,000,000 per annum, I submit whether revenues\r\nshould not be increased or expenditures diminished to reach this amount\r\nof surplus. Not to provide for the sinking fund is a partial failure\r\nto comply with the contracts and obligations of the Government. At the\r\nlast session of Congress a very considerable reduction was made in rates\r\nof taxation and in the number of articles submitted to taxation; the\r\nquestion may well be asked, whether or not, in some instances, unwisely.\r\nIn connection with this subject, too, I venture the opinion that the\r\nmeans of collecting the revenue, especially from imports, have been so\r\nembarrassed by legislation as to make it questionable whether or not\r\nlarge amounts are not lost by failure to collect, to the direct loss of\r\nthe Treasury and to the prejudice of the interests of honest importers\r\nand taxpayers.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury in his report favors legislation looking\r\nto an early return to specie payments, thus supporting views previously\r\nexpressed in this message. He also recommends economy in appropriations;\r\ncalls attention to the loss of revenue from repealing the tax on tea and\r\ncoffee, without benefit to the consumer; recommends an increase of 10\r\ncents a gallon on whisky, and, further, that no modification be made in\r\nthe banking and currency bill passed at the last session of Congress,\r\nunless modification should become necessary by reason of the adoption\r\nof measures for returning to specie payments. In these recommendations\r\nI cordially join.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to Congress the propriety of readjusting the tariff so\r\nas to increase the revenue, and at the same time decrease the number of\r\narticles upon which duties are levied. Those articles which enter into\r\nour manufactures and are not produced at home, it seems to me, should\r\nbe entered free. Those articles of manufacture which we produce a\r\nconstituent part of, but do not produce the whole, that part which we\r\ndo not produce should enter free also. I will instance fine wool, dyes,\r\netc. These articles must be imported to form a part of the manufacture\r\nof the higher grades of woolen goods. Chemicals used as dyes, compounded\r\nin medicines, and used in various ways in manufactures come under this\r\nclass. The introduction free of duty of such wools as we do not produce\r\nwould stimulate the manufacture of goods requiring the use of those we\r\ndo produce, and therefore would be a benefit to home production. There\r\nare many articles entering into \"home manufactures\" which we do not\r\nproduce ourselves the tariff upon which increases the cost of producing\r\nthe manufactured article. All corrections in this regard are in the\r\ndirection of bringing labor and capital in harmony with each other\r\nand of supplying one of the elements of prosperity so much needed.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War herewith attached, and forming a part\r\nof this message, gives all the information concerning the operations,\r\nwants, and necessities of the Army, and contains many suggestions and\r\nrecommendations which I commend to your special attention.\r\n\r\nThere is no class of Government employees who are harder worked than the\r\nArmy--officers and men; none who perform their tasks more cheerfully and\r\nefficiently and under circumstances of greater privations and hardships.\r\n\r\nLegislation is desirable to render more efficient this branch of the\r\npublic service. All the recommendations of the Secretary of War I regard\r\nas judicious, and I especially commend to your attention the following:\r\nThe consolidation of Government arsenals; the restoration of mileage to\r\nofficers traveling under orders; the exemption of money received from\r\nthe sale of subsistence stores from being covered into the Treasury; the\r\nuse of appropriations for the purchase of subsistence stores without\r\nwaiting for the beginning of the fiscal year for which the appropriation\r\nis made; for additional appropriations for the collection of torpedo\r\nmaterial; for increased appropriations for the manufacture of arms; for\r\nrelieving the various States from indebtedness for arms charged to them\r\nduring the rebellion; for dropping officers from the rolls of the Army\r\nwithout trial for the offense of drawing pay more than once for the same\r\nperiod; for the discouragement of the plan to pay soldiers by check,\r\nand for the establishment of a professorship of rhetoric and English\r\nliterature at West Point. The reasons for these recommendations are\r\nobvious, and are set forth sufficiently in the reports attached. I also\r\nrecommend that the status of the staff corps of the Army be fixed,\r\nwhere this has not already been done, so that promotions may be made\r\nand vacancies filled as they occur in each grade when reduced below\r\nthe number to be fixed by law. The necessity for such legislation is\r\nspecially felt now in the Pay Department. The number of officers in that\r\ndepartment is below the number adequate to the performance of the duties\r\nrequired of them by law.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of the Navy has been largely increased during the last\r\nyear. Under the impulse of the foreign complications which threatened\r\nus at the commencement of the last session of Congress, most of our\r\nefficient wooden ships were put in condition for immediate service, and\r\nthe repairs of our ironclad fleet were pushed with the utmost vigor.\r\nThe result is that most of these are now in an effective state and need\r\nonly to be manned and put in commission to go at once into service.\r\n\r\nSome of the new sloops authorized by Congress are already in commission,\r\nand most of the remainder are launched and wait only the completion of\r\ntheir machinery to enable them to take their places as part of our\r\neffective force.\r\n\r\nTwo iron torpedo ships have been completed during the last year, and\r\nfour of our large double-turreted ironclads are now undergoing repairs.\r\nWhen these are finished, everything that is useful of our Navy, as now\r\nauthorized, will be in condition for service, and with the advance in\r\nthe science of torpedo warfare the American Navy, comparatively small as\r\nit is, will be found at any time powerful for the purposes of a peaceful\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nMuch has been accomplished during the year in aid of science and to\r\nincrease the sum of general knowledge and further the interests of\r\ncommerce and civilization. Extensive and much-needed soundings have been\r\nmade for hydrographic purposes and to fix the proper routes of ocean\r\ntelegraphs. Further surveys of the great Isthmus have been undertaken\r\nand completed, and two vessels of the Navy are now employed, in\r\nconjunction with those of England, France, Germany, and Russia, in\r\nobservations connected with the transit of Venus, so useful and\r\ninteresting to the scientific world.\r\n\r\nThe estimates for this branch of the public service do not differ\r\nmaterially from those of last year, those for the general support of\r\nthe service being somewhat less and those for permanent improvements\r\nat the various stations rather larger than the corresponding estimate\r\nmade a year ago. The regular maintenance and a steady increase in the\r\nefficiency of this most important arm in proportion to the growth of\r\nour maritime intercourse and interests is recommended to the attention\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nThe use of the Navy in time of peace might be further utilized by a\r\ndirect authorization of the employment of naval vessels in explorations\r\nand surveys of the supposed navigable waters of other nationalities\r\non this continent, especially the tributaries of the two great rivers\r\nof South America, the Orinoco and the Amazon. Nothing prevents,\r\nunder existing laws, such exploration, except that expenditures\r\nmust be made in such expeditions beyond those usually provided for\r\nin the appropriations. The field designated is unquestionably one\r\nof interest and one capable of large development of commercial\r\ninterests--advantageous to the peoples reached and to those who\r\nmay establish relations with them.\r\n\r\nEducation of the people entitled to exercise the right of franchise\r\nI regard essential to general prosperity everywhere, and especially so\r\nin republics, where birth, education, or previous condition does not\r\nenter into account in giving suffrage. Next to the public school, the\r\npost-office is the great agent of education over our vast territory. The\r\nrapidity with which new sections are being settled, thus increasing the\r\ncarrying of mails in a more rapid ratio than the increase of receipts,\r\nis not alarming. The report of the Postmaster-General herewith attached\r\nshows that there was an increase of revenue in his Department in 1873\r\nover the previous year of $1,674,411, and an increase of cost of\r\ncarrying the mails and paying employees of $3,041,468.91. The report of\r\nthe Postmaster-General gives interesting statistics of his Department,\r\nand compares them with the corresponding statistics of a year ago,\r\nshowing a growth in every branch of the Department.\r\n\r\nA postal convention has been concluded with New South Wales, an exchange\r\nof postal cards established with Switzerland, and the negotiations\r\npending for several years past with France have been terminated in a\r\nconvention with that country, which went into effect last August.\r\n\r\nAn international postal congress was convened in Berne, Switzerland, in\r\nSeptember last, at which the United States was represented by an officer\r\nof the Post-Office Department of much experience and of qualification\r\nfor the position. A convention for the establishment of an international\r\npostal union was agreed upon and signed by the delegates of the\r\ncountries represented, subject to the approval of the proper authorities\r\nof those countries.\r\n\r\nI respectfully direct your attention to the report of the\r\nPostmaster-General and to his suggestions in regard to an equitable\r\nadjustment of the question of compensation to railroads for carrying the\r\nmails.\r\n\r\nYour attention will be drawn to the unsettled condition of affairs in\r\nsome of the Southern States.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of September last the governor of Louisiana called upon me,\r\nas provided by the Constitution and laws of the United States, to aid in\r\nsuppressing domestic violence in that State. This call was made in view\r\nof a proclamation issued on that day by D.B. Penn, claiming that he\r\nwas elected lieutenant-governor in 1872, and calling upon the militia\r\nof the State to arm, assemble, and drive from power the usurpers, as\r\nhe designated the officers of the State government. On the next day I\r\nissued my proclamation[1] commanding the insurgents to disperse within\r\nfive days from the date thereof, and subsequently learned that on that\r\nday they had taken forcible possession of the statehouse. Steps were\r\ntaken by me to support the existing and recognized State government, but\r\nbefore the expiration of the five days the insurrectionary movement was\r\npractically abandoned, and the officers of the State government, with\r\nsome minor exceptions, resumed their powers and duties. Considering\r\nthat the present State administration of Louisiana has been the only\r\ngovernment in that State for nearly two years; that it has been tacitly\r\nacknowledged and acquiesced in as such by Congress, and more than once\r\nexpressly recognized by me, I regarded it as my clear duty, when legally\r\ncalled upon for that purpose, to prevent its overthrow by an armed mob\r\nunder pretense of fraud and irregularity in the election of 1872. I have\r\nheretofore called the attention of Congress to this subject, stating\r\nthat on account of the frauds and forgeries committed at said election,\r\nand because it appears that the returns thereof were never legally\r\ncanvassed, it was impossible to tell thereby who were chosen; but from\r\nthe best sources of information at my command I have always believed\r\nthat the present State officers received a majority of the legal votes\r\nactually cast at that election. I repeat what I said in my special\r\nmessage of February 23, 1873, that in the event of no action by Congress\r\nI must continue to recognize the government heretofore recognized by me.\r\n\r\nI regret to say that with preparations for the late election decided\r\nindications appeared in some localities in the Southern States of a\r\ndetermination, by acts of violence and intimidation, to deprive citizens\r\nof the freedom of the ballot because of their political opinions. Bands\r\nof men, masked and armed, made their appearance; White Leagues and other\r\nsocieties were formed; large quantities of arms and ammunition were\r\nimported and distributed to these organizations; military drills, with\r\nmenacing demonstrations, were held, and with all these murders enough\r\nwere committed to spread terror among those whose political action\r\nwas to be suppressed, if possible, by these intolerant and criminal\r\nproceedings. In some places colored laborers were compelled to vote\r\naccording to the wishes of their employers, under threats of discharge\r\nif they acted otherwise; and there are too many instances in which, when\r\nthese threats were disregarded, they were remorselessly executed by\r\nthose who made them. I understand that the fifteenth amendment to the\r\nConstitution was made to prevent this and a like state of things, and\r\nthe act of May 31, 1870, with amendments, was passed to enforce its\r\nprovisions, the object of both being to guarantee to all citizens the\r\nright to vote and to protect them in the free enjoyment of that right.\r\nEnjoined by the Constitution \"to take care that the laws be faithfully\r\nexecuted,\" and convinced by undoubted evidence that violations of said\r\nact had been committed and that a widespread and flagrant disregard of\r\nit was contemplated, the proper officers were instructed to prosecute\r\nthe offenders, and troops were stationed at convenient points to aid\r\nthese officers, if necessary, in the performance of their official\r\nduties. Complaints are made of this interference by Federal authority;\r\nbut if said amendment and act do not provide for such interference under\r\nthe circumstances as above stated, then they are without meaning, force,\r\nor effect, and the whole scheme of colored enfranchisement is worse than\r\nmockery and little better than a crime. Possibly Congress may find it\r\ndue to truth and justice to ascertain, by means of a committee, whether\r\nthe alleged wrongs to colored citizens for political purposes are real\r\nor the reports thereof were manufactured for the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of troops in the States of Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia,\r\nFlorida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas,\r\nMississippi, Maryland, and Virginia at the time of the election was\r\n4,082. This embraces the garrisons of all the forts from the Delaware\r\nto the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nAnother trouble has arisen in Arkansas. Article 13 of the constitution\r\nof that State (which was adopted in 1868, and upon the approval of\r\nwhich by Congress the State was restored to representation as one of\r\nthe States of the Union) provides in effect that before any amendments\r\nproposed to this constitution shall become a part thereof they shall be\r\npassed by two successive assemblies and then submitted to and ratified\r\nby a majority of the electors of the State voting thereon. On the 11th\r\nof May, 1874, the governor convened an extra session of the general\r\nassembly of the State, which on the 18th of the same month passed an act\r\nproviding for a convention to frame a new constitution. Pursuant to this\r\nact, and at an election held on the 30th of June, 1874, the convention\r\nwas approved, and delegates were chosen thereto, who assembled on the\r\n14th of last July and framed a new constitution, the schedule of which\r\nprovided for the election of an entire new set of State officers in a\r\nmanner contrary to the then existing election laws of the State. On\r\nthe 13th of October, 1874, this constitution, as therein provided, was\r\nsubmitted to the people for their approval or rejection, and according\r\nto the election returns was approved by a large majority of those\r\nqualified to vote thereon; and at the same election persons were chosen\r\nto fill all the State, county, and township offices. The governor\r\nelected in 1872 for the term of four years turned over his office\r\nto the governor chosen under the new constitution, whereupon the\r\nlieutenant-governor, also elected in 1872 for a term of four years,\r\nclaiming to act as governor, and alleging that said proceedings by which\r\nthe new constitution was made and a new set of officers elected were\r\nunconstitutional, illegal, and void, called upon me, as provided in\r\nsection 4, Article IV, of the Constitution, to protect the State against\r\ndomestic violence. As Congress is now investigating the political\r\naffairs of Arkansas, I have declined to interfere.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject of Executive interference with the affairs of\r\na State is repugnant to public opinion, to the feelings of those who,\r\nfrom their official capacity, must be used in such interposition, and to\r\nhim or those who must direct. Unless most clearly on the side of law,\r\nsuch interference becomes a crime; with the law to support it, it is\r\ncondemned without a hearing. I desire, therefore, that all necessity\r\nfor Executive direction in local affairs may become unnecessary and\r\nobsolete. I invite the attention, not of Congress, but of the people of\r\nthe United States, to the causes and effects of these unhappy questions.\r\nIs there not a disposition on one side to magnify wrongs and outrages,\r\nand on the other side to belittle them or justify them? If public\r\nopinion could be directed to a correct survey of what is and to rebuking\r\nwrong and aiding the proper authorities in punishing it, a better state\r\nof feeling would be inculcated, and the sooner we would have that peace\r\nwhich would leave the States free indeed to regulate their own domestic\r\naffairs. I believe on the part of our citizens of the Southern\r\nStates--the better part of them--there is a disposition to be law\r\nabiding, and to do no violence either to individuals or to the laws\r\nexisting. But do they do right in ignoring the existence of violence\r\nand bloodshed in resistance to constituted authority? I sympathize\r\nwith their prostrate condition, and would do all in my power to\r\nrelieve them, acknowledging that in some instances they have had most\r\ntrying governments to live under, and very oppressive ones in the\r\nway of taxation for nominal improvements, not giving benefits equal\r\nto the hardships imposed. But can they proclaim themselves entirely\r\nirresponsible for this condition? They can not. Violence has been\r\nrampant in some localities, and has either been justified or denied by\r\nthose who could have prevented it. The theory is even raised that there\r\nis to be no further interference on the part of the General Government\r\nto protect citizens within a State where the State authorities fail to\r\ngive protection. This is a great mistake. While I remain Executive all\r\nthe laws of Congress and the provisions of the Constitution, including\r\nthe recent amendments added thereto, will be enforced with rigor, but\r\nwith regret that they should have added one jot or tittle to Executive\r\nduties or powers. Let there be fairness in the discussion of Southern\r\nquestions, the advocates of both or all political parties giving honest,\r\ntruthful reports of occurrences, condemning the wrong and upholding the\r\nright, and soon all will be well. Under existing conditions the negro\r\nvotes the Republican ticket because he knows his friends are of that\r\nparty. Many a good citizen votes the opposite, not because he agrees\r\nwith the great principles of state which separate parties, but because,\r\ngenerally, he is opposed to negro rule. This is a most delusive cry.\r\nTreat the negro as a citizen and a voter, as he is and must remain, and\r\nsoon parties will be divided, not on the color line, but on principle.\r\nThen we shall have no complaint of sectional interference.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Attorney-General contains valuable recommendations\r\nrelating to the administration of justice in the courts of the United\r\nStates, to which I invite your attention.\r\n\r\nI respectfully suggest to Congress the propriety of increasing the\r\nnumber of judicial districts in the United States to eleven (the present\r\nnumber being nine) and the creation of two additional judgeships. The\r\nterritory to be traversed by the circuit judges is so great and the\r\nbusiness of the courts so steadily increasing that it is growing more\r\nand more impossible for them to keep up with the business requiring\r\ntheir attention. Whether this would involve the necessity of adding two\r\nmore justices of the Supreme Court to the present number I submit to the\r\njudgment of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is invited to the report of the Secretary\r\nof the Interior and to the legislation asked for by him. The domestic\r\ninterests of the people are more intimately connected with this\r\nDepartment than with either of the other Departments of Government.\r\nIts duties have been added to from time to time until they have become\r\nso onerous that without the most perfect system and order it will be\r\nimpossible for any Secretary of the Interior to keep trace of all\r\nofficial transactions having his sanction and done in his name, and\r\nfor which he is held personally responsible.\r\n\r\nThe policy adopted for the management of Indian affairs, known as the\r\npeace policy, has been adhered to with most beneficial results. It is\r\nconfidently hoped that a few years more will relieve our frontiers from\r\ndanger of Indian depredations.\r\n\r\nI commend the recommendation of the Secretary for the extension\r\nof the homestead laws to the Indians and for some sort of Territorial\r\ngovernment for the Indian Territory. A great majority of the Indians\r\noccupying this Territory are believed yet to be incapable of maintaining\r\ntheir rights against the more civilized and enlightened white man. Any\r\nTerritorial form of government given them, therefore, should protect\r\nthem in their homes and property for a period of at least twenty years,\r\nand before its final adoption should be ratified by a majority of those\r\naffected.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior herewith attached gives much\r\ninteresting statistical information, which I abstain from giving an\r\nabstract of, but refer you to the report itself.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress providing the oath which pensioners must\r\nsubscribe to before drawing their pensions cuts off from this bounty\r\na few survivors of the War of 1812 residing in the Southern States.\r\nI recommend the restoration of this bounty to all such. The number of\r\npersons whose names would thus be restored to the list of pensioners is\r\nnot large. They are all old persons, who could have taken no part in the\r\nrebellion, and the services for which they were awarded pensions were in\r\ndefense of the whole country.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Agriculture herewith contains\r\nsuggestions of much interest to the general public, and refers to the\r\napproaching Centennial and the part his Department is ready to take\r\nin it. I feel that the nation at large is interested in having this\r\nexposition a success, and commend to Congress such action as will secure\r\na greater general interest in it. Already many foreign nations have\r\nsignified their intention to be represented at it, and it may be\r\nexpected that every civilized nation will be represented.\r\n\r\nThe rules adopted to improve the civil service of the Government have\r\nbeen adhered to as closely as has been practicable with the opposition\r\nwith which they meet. The effect, I believe, has been beneficial on\r\nthe whole, and has tended to the elevation of the service. But it is\r\nimpracticable to maintain them without direct and positive support of\r\nCongress. Generally the support which this reform receives is from\r\nthose who give it their support only to find fault when the rules are\r\napparently departed from. Removals from office without preferring\r\ncharges against parties removed are frequently cited as departures from\r\nthe rules adopted, and the retention of those against whom charges are\r\nmade by irresponsible persons and without good grounds is also often\r\ncondemned as a violation of them. Under these circumstances, therefore,\r\nI announce that if Congress adjourns without positive legislation on\r\nthe subject of \"civil-service reform\" I will regard such action as a\r\ndisapproval of the system, and will abandon it, except so far as to\r\nrequire examinations for certain appointees, to determine their\r\nfitness. Competitive examinations will be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen who have given their services, without compensation, as\r\nmembers of the board to devise rules and regulations for the government\r\nof the civil service of the country have shown much zeal and earnestness\r\nin their work, and to them, as well as to myself, it will be a source\r\nof mortification if it is to be thrown away. But I repeat that it is\r\nimpossible to carry this system to a successful issue without general\r\napproval and assistance and positive law to support it.\r\n\r\nI have stated that three elements of prosperity to the nation--capital,\r\nlabor, skilled and unskilled, and products of the soil--still remain\r\nwith us. To direct the employment of these is a problem deserving the\r\nmost serious attention of Congress. If employment can be given to all\r\nthe labor offering itself, prosperity necessarily follows. I have\r\nexpressed the opinion, and repeat it, that the first requisite to the\r\naccomplishment of this end is the substitution of a sound currency\r\nin place of one of a fluctuating value. This secured, there are many\r\ninterests that might be fostered to the great profit of both labor and\r\ncapital. How to induce capital to employ labor is the question. The\r\nsubject of cheap transportation has occupied the attention of Congress.\r\nMuch new light on this question will without doubt be given by the\r\ncommittee appointed by the last Congress to investigate and report upon\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nA revival of shipbuilding, and particularly of iron steamship building,\r\nis of vast importance to our national prosperity. The United States\r\nis now paying over $100,000,000 per annum for freights and passage on\r\nforeign ships--to be carried abroad and expended in the employment\r\nand support of other peoples--beyond a fair percentage of what should\r\ngo to foreign vessels, estimating on the tonnage and travel of each\r\nrespectively. It is to be regretted that this disparity in the carrying\r\ntrade exists, and to correct it I would be willing to see a great\r\ndeparture from the usual course of Government in supporting what might\r\nusually be termed private enterprise. I would not suggest as a remedy\r\ndirect subsidy to American steamship lines, but I would suggest the\r\ndirect offer of ample compensation for carrying the mails between\r\nAtlantic Seaboard cities and the Continent on American-owned and\r\nAmerican-built steamers, and would extend this liberality to vessels\r\ncarrying the mails to South American States and to Central America and\r\nMexico, and would pursue the same policy from our Pacific seaports to\r\nforeign seaports on the Pacific. It might be demanded that vessels built\r\nfor this service should come up to a standard fixed by legislation in\r\ntonnage, speed, and all other qualities, looking to the possibility of\r\nGovernment requiring them at some time for war purposes. The right also\r\nof taking possession of them in such emergency should be guarded.\r\n\r\nI offer these suggestions, believing them worthy of consideration, in\r\nall seriousness, affecting all sections and all interests alike. If\r\nanything better can be done to direct the country into a course of\r\ngeneral prosperity, no one will be more ready than I to second the plan.\r\n\r\nForwarded herewith will be found the report of the commissioners\r\nappointed under an act of Congress approved June 20, 1874, to wind up\r\nthe affairs of the District government. It will be seen from the report\r\nthat the net debt of the District of Columbia, less securities on hand\r\nand available, is:\r\n\r\n  Bonded debt issued prior to July 1, 1874                 $8,883,940.43\r\n  3.65 bonds, act of Congress June 20, 1874                 2,088,168.73\r\n  Certificates of the board of audit                        4,770,558.45\r\n                                                           _____________\r\n                                                           15,742,667.61\r\n\r\n  Less special-improvement assessments\r\n    (chargeable to private property) in\r\n    excess of any demand against such\r\n    assessments                             $1,614,054.37\r\n  Less Chesapeake and Ohio Canal bonds          75,000.00\r\n  And Washington and Alexandria Railroad\r\n    bonds                                       59,000.00\r\n                                            _____________\r\n  In the hands of the commissioners\r\n    of the sinking fund                      1,748,054.37\r\n                                                           _____________\r\n  Leaving actual debt, less said assets                    13,994,613.24\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to this there are claims preferred against the government of\r\nthe District amounting, in the estimated aggregate reported by the board\r\nof audit, to $3,147,787.48, of which the greater part will probably be\r\nrejected. This sum can with no more propriety be included in the debt\r\naccount of the District government than can the thousands of claims\r\nagainst the General Government be included as a portion of the national\r\ndebt. But the aggregate sum thus stated includes something more than the\r\nfunded debt chargeable exclusively to the District of Columbia. The act\r\nof Congress of June 20, 1874, contemplates an apportionment between the\r\nUnited States Government and the District of Columbia in respect of the\r\npayment of the principal and interest of the 3.65 bonds. Therefore in\r\ncomputing with precision the bonded debt of the District the aggregate\r\nsums above stated as respects 3.65 bonds now issued, the outstanding\r\ncertificates of the board of audit, and the unadjusted claims pending\r\nbefore that board should be reduced to the extent of the amount to be\r\napportioned to the United States Government in the manner indicated in\r\nthe act of Congress of June 20, 1874.\r\n\r\nI especially invite your attention to the recommendations of the\r\ncommissioners of the sinking fund relative to the ambiguity of the act\r\nof June 20, 1874, the interest on the District bonds, and the\r\nconsolidation of the indebtedness of the District.\r\n\r\nI feel much indebted to the gentlemen who consented to leave their\r\nprivate affairs and come from a distance to attend to the business of\r\nthis District, and for the able and satisfactory manner in which it has\r\nbeen conducted. I am sure their services will be equally appreciated by\r\nthe entire country.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the accompanying full report of the board of health\r\nthat the sanitary condition of the District is very satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the District of Columbia should be regarded as the grounds\r\nof the national capital, in which the entire people are interested. I do\r\nnot allude to this to urge generous appropriations to the District, but\r\nto draw the attention of Congress, in framing a law for the government\r\nof the District, to the magnificent scale on which the city was planned\r\nby the founders of the Government; the manner in which, for ornamental\r\npurposes, the reservations, streets, and avenues were laid out, and the\r\nproportion of the property actually possessed by the General Government.\r\nI think the proportion of the expenses of the government and\r\nimprovements to be borne by the General Government, the cities of\r\nWashington and Georgetown, and the county should be carefully and\r\nequitably defined.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with section 3, act approved June 23, 1874, I appointed a\r\nboard to make a survey of the mouth of the Mississippi River with a view\r\nto determine the best method of obtaining and maintaining a depth of\r\nwater sufficient for the purposes of commerce, etc.; and in accordance\r\nwith an act entitled \"An act to provide for the appointment of a\r\ncommission of engineers to investigate and report a permanent plan for\r\nthe reclamation of the alluvial basin of the Mississippi River subject\r\nto inundation,\" I appointed a commission of engineers. Neither board has\r\nyet completed its labors. When their reports are received, they will be\r\nforwarded to Congress without delay.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: See pp. 273-276.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: See pp. 277-281.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: See pp. 276-277.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 8, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 3d of February, 1873,\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, together with\r\nthe papers[87] which accompanied it.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: Dispatches in regard to the records and public documents\r\nof the Mexican Government relative to the lands embraced within the\r\nTerritories of Arizona and New Mexico.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 8, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for consideration with a view to ratification,\r\na convention between the United States of America and the Ottoman\r\nEmpire, relative to the extradition of criminals fugitives from justice,\r\nsigned by their respective plenipotentiaries at Constantinople on the\r\n11th of August last.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 8, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for consideration with a view to ratification,\r\na convention concluded between the United States of America and the\r\nMexican Republic on the 20th of November last, for further extending the\r\ntime for the duration of the joint commission respecting claims,\r\noriginally fixed by the convention between the United States and Mexico\r\nsigned on the 4th of July, 1868, and extended by those of the 19th of\r\nApril, 1871, and 27th of November, 1872, between the same parties.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 8, 1874_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for consideration with a view to ratification,\r\na convention between the United States of America and the Ottoman\r\nEmpire, relative to the naturalization of citizens and subjects of the\r\ntwo countries, signed by their respective plenipotentiaries at\r\nConstantinople on the 11th of August last.

Kellogg, the Republican candidate for\r\ngovernor, brought suit upon the equity side of the United States circuit\r\ncourt for Louisiana, and against Warmoth and others, who had obtained\r\npossession of the returns of the election, representing that several\r\nthousand voters of the State had been deprived of the elective franchise\r\non account of their color, and praying that steps might be taken to\r\nhave said votes counted and for general relief. To enable the court to\r\ninquire as to the truth of these allegations, a temporary restraining\r\norder was issued against the defendants, which was at once wholly\r\ndisregarded and treated with contempt by those to whom it was directed.\r\nThese proceedings have been widely denounced as an unwarrantable\r\ninterference by the Federal judiciary with the election of State\r\nofficers; but it is to be remembered that by the fifteenth amendment to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States the political equality of colored\r\ncitizens is secured, and under the second section of that amendment,\r\nproviding that Congress shall have power to enforce its provisions by\r\nappropriate legislation, an act was passed on the 31st of May, 1870,\r\nand amended in 1871, the object of which was to prevent the denial\r\nor abridgment of suffrage to citizens on account of race, color, or\r\nprevious condition of servitude; and it has been held by all the Federal\r\njudges before whom the question has arisen, including Justice Strong, of\r\nthe Supreme Court, that the protection afforded by this amendment and\r\nthese acts extends to State as well as other elections. That it is the\r\nduty of the Federal courts to enforce the provisions of the Constitution\r\nof the United States and the laws passed in pursuance thereof is too\r\nclear for controversy.\r\n\r\nSection 15 of said act, after numerous provisions therein to prevent an\r\nevasion of the fifteenth amendment, provides that the jurisdiction of\r\nthe circuit court of the United States shall extend to all cases in\r\nlaw or equity arising under the provisions of said act and of the act\r\namendatory thereof. Congress seems to have contemplated equitable as\r\nwell as legal proceedings to prevent the denial of suffrage to colored\r\ncitizens; and it may be safely asserted that if Kellogg's bill in the\r\nabove-named case did not present a case for the equitable interposition\r\nof the court, that no such case can arise under the act. That the courts\r\nof the United States have the right to interfere in various ways with\r\nState elections so as to maintain political equality and rights therein,\r\nirrespective of race or color, is comparatively a new, and to some seems\r\nto be a startling, idea, but it results as clearly from the fifteenth\r\namendment to the Constitution and the acts that have been passed to\r\nenforce that amendment as the abrogation of State laws upholding slavery\r\nresults from the thirteenth amendment to the Constitution. While the\r\njurisdiction of the court in the case of Kellogg _vs_. Warmoth and\r\nothers is clear to my mind, it seems that some of the orders made by the\r\njudge in that and the kindred case of Antoine were illegal. But while\r\nthey are so held and considered, it is not to be forgotten that the\r\nmandate of his court had been contemptuously defied, and they were made\r\nwhile wild scenes of anarchy were sweeping away all restraint of law\r\nand order. Doubtless the judge of this court made grave mistakes; but\r\nthe law allows the chancellor great latitude, not only in punishing\r\nthose who contemn his orders and injunctions, but in preventing the\r\nconsummation of the wrong which he has judicially forbidden. Whatever\r\nmay be said or thought of those matters, it was only made known to me\r\nthat process of the United States court was resisted, and as said act\r\nespecially provides for the use of the Army and Navy when necessary to\r\nenforce judicial process arising thereunder, I considered it my duty\r\nto see that such process was executed according to the judgment of\r\nthe court.\r\n\r\nResulting from these proceedings, through various controversies and\r\ncomplications, a State administration was organized with William P.\r\nKellogg as governor, which, in the discharge of my duty under section 4,\r\nArticle IV, of the Constitution, I have recognized as the government of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nIt has been bitterly and persistently alleged that Kellogg was not\r\nelected. Whether he was or not is not altogether certain, nor is it any\r\nmore certain that his competitor, McEnery, was chosen. The election\r\nwas a gigantic fraud, and there are no reliable returns of its result.\r\nKellogg obtained possession of the office, and in my opinion has more\r\nright to it than his competitor.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of February, 1873, the Committee on Privileges and Elections\r\nof the Senate made a report in which they say they were satisfied by\r\ntestimony that the manipulation of the election machinery by Warmoth and\r\nothers was equivalent to 20,000 votes; and they add that to recognize\r\nthe McEnery government \"would be recognizing a government based upon\r\nfraud, in defiance of the wishes and intention of the voters of the\r\nState.\" Assuming the correctness of the statements in this report (and\r\nthey seem to have been generally accepted by the country), the great\r\ncrime in Louisiana, about which so much has been said, is that one is\r\nholding the office of governor who was cheated out of 20,000 votes,\r\nagainst another whose title to the office is undoubtedly based on fraud\r\nand in defiance of the wishes and intentions of the voters of the State.\r\n\r\nMisinformed and misjudging as to the nature and extent of this report,\r\nthe supporters of McEnery proceeded to displace by force in some\r\ncounties of the State the appointees of Governor Kellogg, and on the\r\n13th of April, in an effort of that kind, a butchery of citizens was\r\ncommitted at Colfax, which in bloodthirstiness and barbarity is hardly\r\nsurpassed by any acts of savage warfare.\r\n\r\nTo put this matter beyond controversy I quote from the charge of Judge\r\nWoods, of the United States circuit court, to the jury in the case of\r\nThe United States _vs_. Cruikshank and others, in New Orleans in March,\r\n1874. He said:\r\n\r\nIn the case on trial there are many facts not in controversy. I proceed\r\nto state some of them in the presence and hearing of counsel on both\r\nsides; and if I state as a conceded fact any matter that is disputed,\r\nthey can correct me.\r\n\r\nAfter stating the origin of the difficulty, which grew out of an attempt\r\nof white persons to drive the parish judge and sheriff, appointees of\r\nKellogg, from office, and their attempted protection by colored persons,\r\nwhich led to some fighting, in which quite a number of negroes were\r\nkilled, the judge states:\r\n\r\nMost of those who were not killed were taken prisoners. Fifteen or\r\nsixteen of the blacks had lifted the boards and taken refuge under the\r\nfloor of the court-house. They were all captured. About thirty-seven men\r\nwere taken prisoners. The number is not definitely fixed. They were kept\r\nunder guard until dark. They were led out, two by two, and shot. Most of\r\nthe men were shot to death. A few were wounded, not mortally, and by\r\npretending to be dead were afterwards, during the night, able to make\r\ntheir escape. Among them was the Levi Nelson named in the indictment.\r\n\r\nThe dead bodies of the negroes killed in this affair were left unburied\r\nuntil Tuesday, April 15, when they were buried by a deputy marshal and\r\nan officer of the militia from New Orleans. These persons found\r\nfifty-nine dead bodies. They showed pistol-shot wounds, the great\r\nmajority in the head, and most of them in the back of the head. In\r\naddition to the fifty-nine dead bodies found, some charred remains of\r\ndead bodies were discovered near the court-house. Six dead bodies were\r\nfound under a warehouse, all shot in the head but one or two, which were\r\nshot in the breast.\r\n\r\nThe only white men injured from the beginning of these troubles to their\r\nclose were Hadnot and Harris. The court-house and its contents were\r\nentirely consumed.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that anyone in the crowd of whites bore any lawful\r\nwarrant for the arrest of any of the blacks. There is no evidence that\r\neither Nash or Cazabat, after the affair, ever demanded their offices,\r\nto which they had set up claim, but Register continued to act as parish\r\njudge and Shaw as sheriff.\r\n\r\nThese are facts in this case as I understand them to be admitted.\r\n\r\nTo hold the people of Louisiana generally responsible for these\r\natrocities would not be just, but it is a lamentable fact that\r\ninsuperable obstructions were thrown in the way of punishing these\r\nmurderers; and the so-called conservative papers of the State not only\r\njustified the massacre, but denounced as Federal tyranny and despotism\r\nthe attempt of the United States officers to bring them to justice.\r\nFierce denunciations ring through the country about office holding and\r\nelection matters in Louisiana, while every one of the Colfax miscreants\r\ngoes unwhipped of justice, and no way can be found in this boasted land\r\nof civilization and Christianity to punish the perpetrators of this\r\nbloody and monstrous crime.\r\n\r\nNot unlike this was the massacre in August last. Several Northern young\r\nmen of capital and enterprise had started the little and flourishing\r\ntown of Coushatta. Some of them were Republicans and officeholders under\r\nKellogg. They were therefore doomed to death. Six of them were seized\r\nand carried away from their homes and murdered in cold blood. No one has\r\nbeen punished, and the conservative press of the State denounced all\r\nefforts to that end and boldly justified the crime.\r\n\r\nMany murders of a like character have been committed in individual\r\ncases, which can not here be detailed. For example, T.S. Crawford,\r\njudge, and P.H. Harris, district attorney, of the twelfth judicial\r\ndistrict of the State, on their way to court were shot from their horses\r\nby men in ambush on the 8th of October, 1873; and the widow of the\r\nformer, in a communication to the Department of Justice, tells a piteous\r\ntale of the persecutions of her husband because he was a Union man, and\r\nof the efforts made to screen those who had committed a crime which, to\r\nuse her own language, \"left two widows and nine orphans desolate.\"\r\n\r\nTo say that the murder of a negro or a white Republican is not\r\nconsidered a crime in Louisiana would probably be unjust to a great part\r\nof the people, but it is true that a great number of such murders have\r\nbeen committed and no one has been punished therefor; and manifestly,\r\nas to them, the spirit of hatred and violence is stronger than law.\r\n\r\nRepresentations were made to me that the presence of troops in Louisiana\r\nwas unnecessary and irritating to the people, and that there was no\r\ndanger of public disturbance if they were taken away. Consequently early\r\nin last summer the troops were all withdrawn from the State, with the\r\nexception of a small garrison at New Orleans Barracks. It was claimed\r\nthat a comparative state of quiet had supervened. Political excitement\r\nas to Louisiana affairs seemed to be dying out. But the November\r\nelection was approaching, and it was necessary for party purposes that\r\nthe flame should be rekindled.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the 14th of September D.P. Penn, claiming that he was\r\nelected lieutenant-governor in 1872, issued an inflammatory proclamation\r\ncalling upon the militia of the State to arm, assemble, and drive from\r\npower the usurpers, as he designated the officers of the State. The\r\nWhite Leagues, armed and ready for the conflict, promptly responded.\r\n\r\nOn the same day the governor made a formal requisition upon me, pursuant\r\nto the act of 1795 and section 4, Article IV, of the Constitution,\r\nto aid in suppressing domestic violence. On the next day I issued my\r\nproclamation[1] commanding the insurgents to disperse within five days\r\nfrom the date thereof; but before the proclamation was published in New\r\nOrleans the organized and armed forces recognizing a usurping governor\r\nhad taken forcible possession of the statehouse and temporarily\r\nsubverted the government. Twenty or more people were killed, including a\r\nnumber of the police of the city. The streets of the city were stained\r\nwith blood. All that was desired in the way of excitement had been\r\naccomplished, and, in view of the steps taken to repress it, the\r\nrevolution is apparently, though it is believed not really, abandoned,\r\nand the cry of Federal usurpation and tyranny in Louisiana was renewed\r\nwith redoubled energy. Troops had been sent to the State under this\r\nrequisition of the governor, and as other disturbances seemed imminent\r\nthey were allowed to remain there to render the executive such aid as\r\nmight become necessary to enforce the laws of the State and repress the\r\ncontinued violence which seemed inevitable the moment Federal support\r\nshould be withdrawn.\r\n\r\nPrior to, and with a view to, the late election in Louisiana white men\r\nassociated themselves together in armed bodies called \"White Leagues,\"\r\nand at the same time threats were made in the Democratic journals of the\r\nState that the election should be carried against the Republicans at all\r\nhazards, which very naturally greatly alarmed the colored voters. By\r\nsection 8 of the act of February 28, 1871, it is made the duty of United\r\nStates marshals and their deputies at polls where votes are cast for\r\nRepresentatives in Congress to keep the peace and prevent any violations\r\nof the so-called enforcement acts and other offenses against the laws of\r\nthe United States; and upon a requisition of the marshal of Louisiana,\r\nand in view of said armed organizations and other portentous\r\ncircumstances, I caused detachments of troops to be stationed in various\r\nlocalities in the State, to aid him in the performance of his official\r\nduties. That there was intimidation of Republican voters at the\r\nelection, notwithstanding these precautions, admits of no doubt.\r\nThe following are specimens of the means used:\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of October eighty persons signed and published the following\r\nat Shreveport:\r\n\r\n  We, the undersigned, merchants of the city of Shreveport, in obedience\r\n  to a request of the Shreveport Campaign Club, agree to use every\r\n  endeavor to get our employees to vote the People's ticket at the\r\n  ensuing election, and in the event of their refusal so to do, or in\r\n  case they vote the Radical ticket, to refuse to employ them at the\r\n  expiration of their present contracts.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same day another large body of persons published in the same\r\nplace a paper in which they used the following language:\r\n\r\n  We, the undersigned, merchants of the city of Shreveport, alive to the\r\n  great importance of securing good and honest government to the State,\r\n  do agree and pledge ourselves not to advance any supplies or money to\r\n  any planter the coming year who will give employment or rent lands to\r\n  laborers who vote the Radical ticket in the coming election.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have no information of the proceedings of the returning board for said\r\nelection which may not be found in its report, which has been published;\r\nbut it is a matter of public information that a great part of the time\r\ntaken to canvass the votes was consumed by the arguments of lawyers,\r\nseveral of whom represented each party before the board. I have no\r\nevidence that the proceedings of this board were not in accordance with\r\nthe law under which they acted. Whether in excluding from their count\r\ncertain returns they were right or wrong is a question that depends upon\r\nthe evidence they had before them; but it is very clear that the law\r\ngives them the power, if they choose to exercise it, of deciding that\r\nway, and, _prima facie_, the persons whom they return as elected are\r\nentitled to the offices for which they were candidates.\r\n\r\nRespecting the alleged interference by the military with the\r\norganization of the legislature of Louisiana on the 4th instant,\r\nI have no knowledge or information which has not been received by\r\nme since that time and published. My first information was from the\r\npapers of the morning of the 5th of January. I did not know that any\r\nsuch thing was anticipated, and no orders nor suggestions were ever\r\ngiven to any military officer in that State upon that subject prior\r\nto the occurrence. I am well aware that any military interference by\r\nthe officers or troops of the United States with the organization of\r\nthe State legislature or any of its proceedings, or with any civil\r\ndepartment of the Government, is repugnant to our ideas of government.\r\nI can conceive of no case, not involving rebellion or insurrection,\r\nwhere such interference by authority of the General Government ought to\r\nbe permitted or can be justified. But there are circumstances connected\r\nwith the late legislative imbroglio in Louisiana which seem to exempt\r\nthe military from any intentional wrong in that matter. Knowing that\r\nthey had been placed in Louisiana to prevent domestic violence and aid\r\nin the enforcement of the State laws, the officers and troops of the\r\nUnited States may well have supposed that it was their duty to act\r\nwhen called upon by the governor for that purpose.\r\n\r\nEach branch of a legislative assembly is the judge of the election\r\nand qualifications of its own members; but if a mob or a body of\r\nunauthorized persons seize and hold the legislative hall in a tumultuous\r\nand riotous manner, and so prevent any organization by those legally\r\nreturned as elected, it might become the duty of the State executive to\r\ninterpose, if requested by a majority of the members elect, to suppress\r\nthe disturbance and enable the persons elected to organize the house.\r\n\r\nAny exercise of this power would only be justifiable under most\r\nextraordinary circumstances, and it would then be the duty of the\r\ngovernor to call upon the constabulary or, if necessary, the military\r\nforce of the State. But with reference to Louisiana, it is to be borne\r\nin mind that any attempt by the governor to use the police force of that\r\nState at this time would have undoubtedly precipitated a bloody conflict\r\nwith the White League, as it did on the 14th of September.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but that the presence of the United States troops upon\r\nthat occasion prevented bloodshed and the loss of life. Both parties\r\nappear to have relied upon them as conservators of the public peace.\r\n\r\nThe first call was made by the Democrats, to remove persons obnoxious\r\nto them from the legislative halls; and the second was from the\r\nRepublicans, to remove persons who had usurped seats in the legislature\r\nwithout legal certificates authorizing them to seats, and in sufficient\r\nnumber to change the majority.\r\n\r\nNobody was disturbed by the military who had a legal right at that time\r\nto occupy a seat in the legislature. That the Democratic minority of the\r\nhouse undertook to seize its organization by fraud and violence; that in\r\nthis attempt they trampled under foot law; that they undertook to make\r\npersons not returned as elected members, so as to create a majority;\r\nthat they acted under a preconcerted plan, and under false pretenses\r\nintroduced into the hall a body of men to support their pretensions by\r\nforce if necessary, and that conflict, disorder, and riotous proceedings\r\nfollowed are facts that seem to be well established; and I am credibly\r\ninformed that these violent proceedings were a part of a premeditated\r\nplan to have the house organized in this way, recognize what has been\r\ncalled the McEnery senate, then to depose Governor Kellogg, and so\r\nrevolutionize the State government.\r\n\r\nWhether it was wrong for the governor, at the request of the majority of\r\nthe members returned as elected to the house, to use such means as were\r\nin his power to defeat these lawless and revolutionary proceedings is\r\nperhaps a debatable question; but it is quite certain that there would\r\nhave been no trouble if those who now complain of illegal interference\r\nhad allowed the house to be organized in a lawful and regular manner.\r\nWhen those who inaugurate disorder and anarchy disavow such proceedings,\r\nit will be time enough to condemn those who by such means as they have\r\nprevent the success of their lawless and desperate schemes.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General Sheridan was requested by me to go to Louisiana\r\nto observe and report the situation there, and, if in his opinion\r\nnecessary, to assume the command, which he did on the 4th instant, after\r\nthe legislative disturbances had occurred, at 9 o'clock p.m., a number\r\nof hours after the disturbances. No party motives nor prejudices can\r\nreasonably be imputed to him; but honestly convinced by what he has seen\r\nand heard there, he has characterized the leaders of the White Leagues\r\nin severe terms and suggested summary modes of procedure against them,\r\nwhich, though they can not be adopted, would, if legal, soon put an\r\nend to the troubles and disorders in that State. General Sheridan was\r\nlooking at facts, and possibly, not thinking of proceedings which would\r\nbe the only proper ones to pursue in time of peace, thought more of the\r\nutterly lawless condition of society surrounding him at the time of his\r\ndispatch and of what would prove a sure remedy. He never proposed to do\r\nan illegal act nor expressed determination to proceed beyond what the\r\nlaw in the future might authorize for the punishment of the atrocities\r\nwhich have been committed, and the commission of which can not be\r\nsuccessfully denied. It is a deplorable fact that political crimes and\r\nmurders have been committed in Louisiana which have gone unpunished,\r\nand which have been justified or apologized for, which must rest as a\r\nreproach upon the State and country long after the present generation\r\nhas passed away.\r\n\r\nI have no desire to have United States troops interfere in the domestic\r\nconcerns of Louisiana or any other State.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of December last Governor Kellogg telegraphed to me his\r\napprehensions that the White League intended to make another attack upon\r\nthe statehouse, to which, on the same day, I made the following answer,\r\nsince which no communication has been sent to him:\r\n\r\n  Your dispatch of this date just received. It is exceedingly unpalatable\r\n  to use troops in anticipation of danger. Let the State authorities be\r\n  right, and then proceed with their duties without apprehension of\r\n  danger. If they are then molested, the question will be determined\r\n  whether the United States is able to maintain law and order within its\r\n  limits or not.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have deplored the necessity which seemed to make it my duty under the\r\nConstitution and laws to direct such interference. I have always refused\r\nexcept where it seemed to be my imperative duty to act in such a manner\r\nunder the Constitution and laws of the United States. I have repeatedly\r\nand earnestly entreated the people of the South to live together in\r\npeace and obey the laws; and nothing would give me greater pleasure than\r\nto see reconciliation and tranquillity everywhere prevail, and thereby\r\nremove all necessity for the presence of troops among them. I regret,\r\nhowever, to say that this state of things does not exist, nor does its\r\nexistence seem to be desired, in some localities; and as to those it may\r\nbe proper for me to say that to the extent that Congress has conferred\r\npower upon me to prevent it neither Kuklux Klans, White Leagues, nor\r\nany other association using arms and violence to execute their unlawful\r\npurposes can be permitted in that way to govern any part of this\r\ncountry; nor can I see with indifference Union men or Republicans\r\nostracized, persecuted, and murdered on account of their opinions,\r\nas they now are in some localities.\r\n\r\nI have heretofore urged the case of Louisiana upon the attention of\r\nCongress, and I can not but think that its inaction has produced great\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nTo summarize: In September last an armed, organized body of men, in the\r\nsupport of candidates who had been put in nomination for the offices of\r\ngovernor and lieutenant-governor at the November election in 1872, and\r\nwho had been declared not elected by the board of canvassers, recognized\r\nby all the courts to which the question had been submitted, undertook to\r\nsubvert and overthrow the State government that had been recognized by\r\nme in accordance with previous precedents. The recognized governor was\r\ndriven from the statehouse, and but for his finding shelter in the\r\nUnited States custom-house, in the capital of the State of which he was\r\ngovernor, it is scarcely to be doubted that he would have been killed.\r\n\r\nFrom the statehouse, before he had been driven to the custom-house, a\r\ncall was made, in accordance with the fourth section, fourth article,\r\nof the Constitution of the United States, for the aid of the General\r\nGovernment to suppress domestic violence. Under those circumstances, and\r\nin accordance with my sworn duties, my proclamation[91] of the 15th of\r\nSeptember, 1874, was issued. This served to reinstate Governor Kellogg\r\nto his position nominally, but it can not be claimed that the insurgents\r\nhave to this day surrendered to the State authorities the arms belonging\r\nto the State, or that they have in any sense disarmed. On the contrary,\r\nit is known that the same armed organizations that existed on the 14th\r\nof September, 1874, in opposition to the recognized State government,\r\nstill retain their organization, equipments, and commanders, and can\r\nbe called out at any hour to resist the State government. Under these\r\ncircumstances the same military force has been continued in Louisiana\r\nas was sent there under the first call, and under the same general\r\ninstructions. I repeat that the task assumed by the troops is not a\r\npleasant one to them; that the Army is not composed of lawyers, capable\r\nof judging at a moment's notice of just how far they can go in the\r\nmaintenance of law and order, and that it was impossible to give\r\nspecific instructions providing for all possible contingencies that\r\nmight arise. The troops were bound to act upon the judgment of the\r\ncommanding officer upon each sudden contingency that arose, or wait\r\ninstructions which could only reach them after the threatened wrongs\r\nhad been committed which they were called on to prevent. It should be\r\nrecollected, too, that upon my recognition of the Kellogg government\r\nI reported the fact, with the grounds of recognition, to Congress, and\r\nasked that body to take action in the matter; otherwise I should regard\r\ntheir silence as an acquiescence in my course. No action has been taken\r\nby that body, and I have maintained the position then marked out.\r\n\r\nIf error has been committed by the Army in these matters, it has always\r\nbeen on the side of the preservation of good order, the maintenance of\r\nlaw, and the protection of life. Their bearing reflects credit upon the\r\nsoldiers, and if wrong has resulted the blame is with the turbulent\r\nelement surrounding them.\r\n\r\nI now earnestly ask that such action be taken by Congress as to leave my\r\nduties perfectly clear in dealing with the affairs of Louisiana, giving\r\nassurance at the same time that whatever may be done by that body in the\r\npremises will be executed according to the spirit and letter of the law,\r\nwithout fear or favor.\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit copies of documents containing more specific\r\ninformation as to the subject-matter of the resolution.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: See pp. 276-277.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: See pp. 275-277.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 14, 1875_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nSenate bill No. 1044, \"to provide for the resumption of specie\r\npayments,\" is before me, and this day receives my signature of approval.\r\n\r\nI venture upon this unusual method of conveying the notice of approval\r\nto the \"House in which the measure originated\" because of its great\r\nimportance to the country at large and in order to suggest further\r\nlegislation which seems to me essential to make this law effective.\r\n\r\nIt is a subject of congratulation that a measure has become law which\r\nfixes a date when specie resumption shall commence and implies an\r\nobligation on the part of Congress, if in its power, to give such\r\nlegislation as may prove necessary to redeem this promise.\r\n\r\nTo this end I respectfully call your attention to a few suggestions:\r\n\r\nFirst. The necessity of an increased revenue to carry out the obligation\r\nof adding to the sinking fund annually 1 per cent of the public debt,\r\namounting now to about $34,000,000 per annum, and to carry out the\r\npromises of this measure to redeem, under certain contingencies, eighty\r\nmillions of the present legal-tenders, and, without contingency, the\r\nfractional currency now in circulation.\r\n\r\nHow to increase the surplus revenue is for Congress to devise, but\r\nI will venture to suggest that the duty on tea and coffee might be\r\nrestored without permanently enhancing the cost to the consumers, and\r\nthat the 10 per cent horizontal reduction of the tariff on articles\r\nspecified in the law of June 6, 1872, be repealed. The supply of tea and\r\ncoffee already on hand in the United States would in all probability be\r\nadvanced in price by adopting this measure. But it is known that the\r\nadoption of free entry to those articles of necessity did not cheapen\r\nthem, but merely added to the profits of the countries producing them,\r\nor of the middlemen in those countries, who have the exclusive trade\r\nin them.\r\n\r\nSecond. The first section of the bill now under consideration provides\r\nthat the fractional currency shall be redeemed in silver coin as rapidly\r\nas practicable. There is no provision preventing the fluctuation in the\r\nvalue of the paper currency. With gold at a premium of anything over 10\r\nper cent above the currency in use, it is probable, almost certain, that\r\nsilver would be bought up for exportation as fast as it was put out, or\r\nuntil change would become so scarce as to make the premium on it equal\r\nto the premium on gold, or sufficiently high to make it no longer\r\nprofitable to buy for export, thereby causing a direct loss to the\r\ncommunity at large and great embarrassment to trade.\r\n\r\nAs the present law commands final resumption on the 1st day of January,\r\n1879, and as the gold receipts by the Treasury are larger than the\r\ngold payments and the currency receipts are smaller than the currency\r\npayments, thereby making monthly sales of gold necessary to meet current\r\ncurrency expenses, it occurs to me that these difficulties might be\r\nremedied by authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to redeem\r\nlegal-tender notes, whenever presented in sums of not less than $100 and\r\nmultiples thereof, at a premium for gold of 10 per cent, less interest\r\nat the rate of 2-1/2 per cent per annum from the 1st day of January,\r\n1875, to the date of putting this law into operation, and diminishing\r\nthis premium at the same rate until final resumption, changing the\r\nrate of premium demanded from time to time as the interest amounts to\r\none-quarter of 1 per cent. I suggest this rate of interest because it\r\nwould bring currency at par with gold at the date fixed by law for final\r\nresumption. I suggest 10 per cent as the demand premium at the beginning\r\nbecause I believe this rate would insure the retention of silver in the\r\ncountry for change.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the third section of the act will prevent combinations\r\nbeing made to exhaust the Treasury of coin.\r\n\r\nWith such a law it is presumable that no gold would be called for not\r\nrequired for legitimate business purposes. When large amounts of coin\r\nshould be drawn from the Treasury, correspondingly large amounts of\r\ncurrency would be withdrawn from circulation, thus causing a sufficient\r\nstringency in currency to stop the outward flow of coin.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of a currency of a fixed known value would also be\r\nreached. In my opinion, by the enactment of such a law business and\r\nindustries would revive and the beginning of prosperity on a firm basis\r\nwould be reached.\r\n\r\nOther means of increasing revenue than those suggested should probably\r\nbe devised, and also other legislation.\r\n\r\nIn fact, to carry out the first section of the act another mint becomes\r\na necessity. With the present facilities for coinage, it would take a\r\nperiod probably beyond that fixed by law for final specie resumption to\r\ncoin the silver necessary to transact the business of the country.\r\n\r\nThere are now smelting furnaces, for extracting the silver and gold from\r\nthe ores brought from the mountain territories, in Chicago, St. Louis,\r\nand Omaha--three in the former city--and as much of the change required\r\nwill be wanted in the Mississippi Valley States, and as the metals to be\r\ncoined come from west of those States, and, as I understand, the charges\r\nfor transportation of bullion from either of the cities named to the\r\nmint in Philadelphia or to New York City amount to $4 for each $1,000\r\nworth, with an equal expense for transportation back, it would seem a\r\nfair argument in favor of adopting one or more of those cities as the\r\nplace or places for the establishment of new coining facilities.\r\n\r\nI have ventured upon this subject with great diffidence, because it is\r\nso unusual to approve a measure--as I most heartily do this, even if\r\nno further legislation is attainable at this time--and to announce the\r\nfact by message. But I do so because I feel that it is a subject of\r\nsuch vital importance to the whole country that it should receive the\r\nattention of and be discussed by Congress and the people through the\r\npress, and in every way, to the end that the best and most satisfactory\r\ncourse may be reached of executing what I deem most beneficial\r\nlegislation on a most vital question to the interests and prosperity\r\nof the nation.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 20, 1875_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith a report from a board composed of\r\none person named by the head of each Executive Department and of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture and Smithsonian Institution, for the purpose\r\nof securing a complete and harmonious arrangement of the articles and\r\nmaterials designed to be exhibited from the Executive Departments of the\r\nGovernment at the international exhibition to be held in the city of\r\nPhiladelphia in the year 1876 for the purpose of celebrating the one\r\nhundredth anniversary of the independence of the United States. The\r\nreport gives a statement of what is proposed to be exhibited by each\r\nDepartment, together with an estimate of the expense which will have\r\nto be incurred. Submitting to Congress the estimate made by the board,\r\nI recommend that Congress make a suitable appropriation to enable the\r\ndifferent Departments to make a complete and creditable showing of the\r\narticles and materials designed to be exhibited by the Government, and\r\nwhich will undoubtedly form one of the most interesting features of\r\nthe exhibition.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 20, 1875_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn my annual message of December 1, 1873, while inviting general\r\nattention to all the recommendations made by the Secretary of War,\r\nyour special consideration was invited to \"the importance of preparing\r\nfor war in time of peace by providing proper armament for our\r\nseacoast defenses. Proper armament is of vastly more importance than\r\nfortifications. The latter can be supplied very speedily for temporary\r\npurposes when needed; the former can not.\"\r\n\r\nThese views gain increased strength and pertinence as the years roll\r\nby, and I have now again the honor to call special attention to the\r\ncondition of the \"armament of our fortifications\" and the absolute\r\nnecessity for immediate provision by Congress for the procurement of\r\nheavy cannon. The large expenditures required to supply the number of\r\nguns for our forts is the strongest argument that can be adduced for a\r\nliberal annual appropriation for their gradual accumulation. In time of\r\nwar such preparations can not be made; cannon can not be purchased in\r\nopen market nor manufactured at short notice; they must be the product\r\nof years of experience and labor.\r\n\r\nI herewith enclose copies of a report of the Chief of Ordnance and of\r\na board of ordnance officers on the trial of an 8-inch rifle converted\r\nfrom a 10-inch smooth-bore, which shows very conclusively an economical\r\nmeans of utilizing these useless smooth-bores and making them into\r\n8-inch rifles, capable of piercing 7 inches of iron. The 1,294 10-inch\r\nRodman guns should, in my opinion, be so utilized, and the appropriation\r\nrequested by the Chief of Ordnance of $250,000 to commence these\r\nconversions is urgently recommended.\r\n\r\nWhile convinced of the economy and necessity of these conversions, the\r\ndetermination of the best and most economical method of providing guns\r\nof still larger caliber should no longer be delayed. The experience\r\nof other nations, based on the new conditions of defense brought\r\nprominently forward by the introduction of ironclads into every navy\r\nafloat, demands heavier metal and rifle guns of not less than 12 inches\r\nin caliber. These enormous masses, hurling a shot of 700 pounds, can\r\nalone meet many of the requirements of the national defenses. They must\r\nbe provided, and experiments on a large scale can alone give the data\r\nnecessary for the determination of the question. A suitable proving\r\nground, with all the facilities and conveniences referred to by the\r\nChief of Ordnance, with a liberal annual appropriation, is an undoubted\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nThe guns now ready for trial can not be experimented with without funds,\r\nand the estimate of $250,000 for the purpose is deemed reasonable and is\r\nstrongly recommended.\r\n\r\nThe constant appeals for legislation on the \"armament of fortifications\"\r\nought no longer to be disregarded if Congress desires in peace to\r\nprepare the important material without which future wars must inevitably\r\nlead to disaster.\r\n\r\nThis subject is submitted with the hope that the consideration it\r\ndeserves may be given it at the present session.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 25, 1875_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith the report of the commission of\r\nengineers appointed in compliance with the act of Congress approved June\r\n22, 1874, to investigate and report a permanent plan for the reclamation\r\nof the alluvial basin of the Mississippi River subject to inundation.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 26, 1875_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith, for the information of Congress,\r\na report of the progress made to this date by the United States\r\nCentennial Commission appointed in accordance with the requirements of\r\nthe act approved June 1, 1872.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 1, 1875_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for consideration with a view to ratification,\r\na treaty concluded on the 30th ultimo between this Government and His\r\nHawaiian Majesty, on the subject of commercial reciprocity. I also\r\ntransmit, for the information of the Senate, the papers mentioned in the\r\nsubjoined list, relating to the commerce between the United States and\r\nthe Hawaiian Islands.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 1, 1875_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to lay before Congress a communication of the Secretary\r\nof War relative to the action taken in issuing certain supplies to the\r\nsuffering people in Kansas and Nebraska, in consequence of the drought\r\nand grasshopper plague, and to respectfully request that such action be\r\napproved.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 8, 1875_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHerewith I have the honor to send, in accordance with the resolution of\r\nthe Senate of the 3d instant, all the information in my possession not\r\nheretofore furnished relating to affairs in the State of Arkansas.\r\n\r\nI will venture to express the opinion that all the testimony shows that\r\nin the election of 1872 Joseph Brooks was lawfully elected governor of\r\nthat State; that he has been unlawfully deprived of the possession of\r\nhis office since that time; that in 1874 the constitution of the State\r\nwas by violence, intimidation, and revolutionary proceedings overthrown\r\nand a new constitution adopted and a new State government established.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings, if permitted to stand, practically ignore all\r\nrights of minorities in all the States. Also, what is there to prevent\r\neach of the States recently readmitted to Federal relations on certain\r\nconditions changing their constitutions and violating their pledges if\r\nthis action in Arkansas is acquiesced in?\r\n\r\nI respectfully submit whether a precedent so dangerous to the stability\r\nof State government, if not of the National Government also, should be\r\nrecognized by Congress.

His true name, as\r\nverified by his own signature to papers on file in the Pension Office,\r\nis Louis Heinlig, and as there were several soldiers in the company and\r\nregiment named in the act whose names are similar to that specified\r\ntherein, a correction appears to be necessary in order that the\r\nbeneficiary of the act may be properly identified should the bill\r\nbecome a law.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nC. DELANO, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 3, 1875_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:[92]\r\n\r\nHouse bill No. 3341[93] is herewith returned without my approval, for\r\nthe reasons, first, that it appropriates from the Treasury a large sum\r\nof money at a time when the revenue is insufficient for current wants\r\nand this proposed further drain on the Treasury. The issue of bonds,\r\nauthorized by the bill to a very large and indefinite amount, would\r\nseriously embarrass the refunding operations now progressing, whereby\r\nthe interest of the bonded debt of the United States is being largely\r\nreduced. Second, I do not believe that any considerable portion of the\r\nex-soldiers who, it is supposed, will be beneficiaries of this\r\nappropriation are applicants for it, but, rather, it would result more\r\nin a measure for the relief of claim agents and middlemen who would\r\nintervene to collect or discount the bounties granted by it. The passage\r\nof this bill at this time is inconsistent with the measures of economy\r\nnow demanded by the necessities of the country.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: Pocket veto.

Pope, United States Army,\r\napplied for discharge to date December 31, 1870, under section 3, act of\r\nJuly 15, 1870.\r\n\r\nBy letter from the Adjutant-General's Office, War Department, November\r\n2, 1870, he was informed he could not be discharged as requested, as the\r\nPresident had decided staff officers did not come under the provisions\r\nof the act.\r\n\r\nSubsequently the President decided that staff officers who applied and\r\ncould be spared could go out under the act. Accordingly, Assistant\r\nSurgeon Pope was discharged, on his original application, to date\r\nDecember 31, 1870, by special order of that date, this because time did\r\nnot permit to communicate with him, and the belief that his desire to\r\nleave the service was unchanged.\r\n\r\nHe drew a year's pay and mileage under the order, came to Washington,\r\nand on May 19, 1871, applied for revocation of the order of discharge on\r\nthe ground that, having been officially notified of disapproval, he had\r\nmade arrangements to remain in service. Forwarded by the Surgeon-General\r\nrecommended. Disapproved by the Secretary of War May 23, 1871.\r\n\r\nJune 17, 1871, the order of discharge was revoked. Assistant-Surgeon\r\nPope then refunded the year's pay and mileage and drew pay for\r\ncontinuous service.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 9, 1875_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the authority conferred upon me by the joint resolution\r\nof Congress approved on the 17th of June last, due notice was, on the\r\n1st day of July last, given to the Government of Belgium, through\r\nthe minister of the United States at Brussels, of the desire of this\r\nGovernment to terminate the treaty between the United States and His\r\nMajesty the King of the Belgians of the 17th of July, 1858.

We were then a\r\npeople numbering only 3,000,000. Now we number more than 40,000,000.\r\nThen industries were confined almost exclusively to the tillage of the\r\nsoil. Now manufactories absorb much of the labor of the country.\r\n\r\nOur liberties remain unimpaired; the bondmen have been freed from\r\nslavery; we have become possessed of the respect, if not the friendship,\r\nof all civilized nations. Our progress has been great in all the\r\narts--in science, agriculture, commerce, navigation, mining, mechanics,\r\nlaw, medicine, etc,: and in general education the progress is likewise\r\nencouraging. Our thirteen States have become thirty-eight, including\r\nColorado (which has taken the initiatory steps to become a State), and\r\neight Territories, including the Indian Territory and Alaska, and\r\nexcluding Colorado, making a territory extending from the Atlantic to\r\nthe Pacific. On the south we have extended to the Gulf of Mexico, and\r\nin the west from the Mississippi to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nOne hundred years ago the cotton gin, the steamship, the railroad, the\r\ntelegraph, the reaping, sewing, and modern printing machines, and\r\nnumerous other inventions of scarcely less value to our business and\r\nhappiness were entirely unknown.\r\n\r\nIn 1776 manufactories scarcely existed even in name in all this vast\r\nterritory. In 1870 more than 2,000,000 persons were employed in\r\nmanufactories, producing more than $2,100,000,000 of products in amount\r\nannually, nearly equal to our national debt. From nearly the whole of\r\nthe population of 1776 being engaged in the one occupation of\r\nagriculture, in 1870 so numerous and diversified had become the\r\noccupation of our people that less than 6,000,000 out of more than\r\n40,000,000 were so engaged. The extraordinary effect produced in our\r\ncountry by a resort to diversified occupations has built a market for\r\nthe products of fertile lands distant from the seaboard and the markets\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nThe American system of locating various and extensive manufactories\r\nnext to the plow and the pasture, and adding connecting railroads\r\nand steamboats, has produced in our distant interior country a result\r\nnoticeable by the intelligent portions of all commercial nations. The\r\ningenuity and skill of American mechanics have been demonstrated at\r\nhome and abroad in a manner most flattering to their pride. But for the\r\nextraordinary genius and ability of our mechanics, the achievements of\r\nour agriculturists, manufacturers, and transporters throughout the\r\ncountry would have been impossible of attainment.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the miner has also been great. Of coal our production\r\nwas small; now many millions of tons are mined annually. So with iron,\r\nwhich formed scarcely an appreciable part of our products half a century\r\nago, we now produce more than the world consumed at the beginning of\r\nour national existence. Lead, zinc, and copper, from being articles\r\nof import, we may expect to be large exporters of in the near future.\r\nThe development of gold and silver mines in the United States and\r\nTerritories has not only been remarkable, but has had a large influence\r\nupon the business of all commercial nations. Our merchants in the last\r\nhundred years have had a success and have established a reputation for\r\nenterprise, sagacity, progress, and integrity unsurpassed by peoples of\r\nolder nationalities. This \"good name\" is not confined to their homes,\r\nbut goes out upon every sea and into every port where commerce enters.\r\nWith equal pride we can point to our progress in all of the learned\r\nprofessions.\r\n\r\nAs we are now about to enter upon our second centennial--commencing our\r\nmanhood as a nation--it is well to look back upon the past and study\r\nwhat will be best to preserve and advance our future greatness. From the\r\nfall of Adam for his transgression to the present day no nation has ever\r\nbeen free from threatened danger to its prosperity and happiness. We\r\nshould look to the dangers threatening us, and remedy them so far as\r\nlies in our power. We are a republic whereof one man is as good as\r\nanother before the law. Under such a form of government it is of the\r\ngreatest importance that all should be possessed of education and\r\nintelligence enough to cast a vote with a right understanding of\r\nits meaning. A large association of ignorant men can not for any\r\nconsiderable period oppose a successful resistance to tyranny and\r\noppression from the educated few, but will inevitably sink into\r\nacquiescence to the will of intelligence, whether directed by the\r\ndemagogue or by priestcraft. Hence the education of the masses becomes\r\nof the first necessity for the preservation of our institutions. They\r\nare worth preserving, because they have secured the greatest good to\r\nthe greatest proportion of the population of any form of government yet\r\ndevised. All other forms of government approach it just in proportion\r\nto the general diffusion of education and independence of thought and\r\naction. As the primary step, therefore, to our advancement in all that\r\nhas marked our progress in the past century, I suggest for your earnest\r\nconsideration, and most earnestly recommend it, that a constitutional\r\namendment be submitted to the legislatures of the several States for\r\nratification, making it the duty of each of the several States to\r\nestablish and forever maintain free public schools adequate to the\r\neducation of all the children in the rudimentary branches within their\r\nrespective limits, irrespective of sex, color, birthplace, or religions;\r\nforbidding the teaching in said schools of religious, atheistic, or\r\npagan tenets; and prohibiting the granting of any school funds or school\r\ntaxes, or any part thereof, either by legislative, municipal, or other\r\nauthority, for the benefit or in aid, directly or indirectly, of any\r\nreligious sect or denomination, or in aid or for the benefit of any\r\nother object of any nature or kind whatever.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this important question I would also call your\r\nattention to the importance of correcting an evil that, if permitted to\r\ncontinue, will probably lead to great trouble in our land before the\r\nclose of the nineteenth century. It is the accumulation of vast amounts\r\nof untaxed church property.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, I believe, the church property of the United States which paid\r\nno tax, municipal or State, amounted to about $83,000,000. In 1860 the\r\namount had doubled; in 1875 it is about $1,000,000,000. By 1900, without\r\ncheck, it is safe to say this property will reach a sum exceeding\r\n$3,000,000,000. So vast a sum, receiving all the protection and benefits\r\nof Government without bearing its proportion of the burdens and expenses\r\nof the same, will not be looked upon acquiescently by those who have\r\nto pay the taxes. In a growing country, where real estate enhances so\r\nrapidly with time, as in the United States, there is scarcely a limit to\r\nthe wealth that may be acquired by corporations, religious or otherwise,\r\nif allowed to retain real estate without taxation. The contemplation of\r\nso vast a property as here alluded to, without taxation, may lead to\r\nsequestration without constitutional authority and through blood.\r\n\r\nI would suggest the taxation of all property equally, whether church\r\nor corporation, exempting only the last resting place of the dead and\r\npossibly, with proper restrictions, church edifices.\r\n\r\nOur relations with most of the foreign powers continue on a satisfactory\r\nand friendly footing.\r\n\r\nIncreased intercourse, the extension of commerce, and the cultivation\r\nof mutual interests have steadily improved our relations with the large\r\nmajority of the powers of the world, rendering practicable the peaceful\r\nsolution of questions which from time to time necessarily arise, leaving\r\nfew which demand extended or particular notice.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence of the Department of State with our diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives abroad is transmitted herewith.\r\n\r\nI am happy to announce the passage of an act by the General Cortes\r\nof Portugal, proclaimed since the adjournment of Congress, for the\r\nabolition of servitude in the Portuguese colonies. It is to be hoped\r\nthat such legislation may be another step toward the great consummation\r\nto be reached, when no man shall be permitted, directly or indirectly,\r\nunder any guise, excuse, or form of law, to hold his fellow-man in\r\nbondage. I am of opinion also that it is the duty of the United States,\r\nas contributing toward that end, and required by the spirit of the age\r\nin which we live, to provide by suitable legislation that no citizen of\r\nthe United States shall hold slaves as property in any other country or\r\nbe interested therein.\r\n\r\nChile has made reparation in the case of the whale ship _Good Return_,\r\nseized without sufficient cause upward of forty years ago. Though she\r\nhad hitherto denied her accountability, the denial was never acquiesced\r\nin by this Government, and the justice of the claim has been so\r\nearnestly contended for that it has been gratifying that she should have\r\nat last acknowledged it.\r\n\r\nThe arbitrator in the case of the United States steamer _Montijo_, for\r\nthe seizure and detention of which the Government of the United States\r\nof Colombia was held accountable, has decided in favor of the claim.\r\nThis decision has settled a question which had been pending for several\r\nyears, and which, while it continued open, might more or less disturb\r\nthe good understanding which it is desirable should be maintained\r\nbetween the two Republics.\r\n\r\nA reciprocity treaty with the King of the Hawaiian Islands was concluded\r\nsome months since. As it contains a stipulation that it shall not take\r\neffect until Congress shall enact the proper legislation for that\r\npurpose, copies of the instrument are herewith submitted, in order that,\r\nif such should be the pleasure of Congress, the necessary legislation\r\nupon the subject may be adopted.\r\n\r\nIn March last an arrangement was made, through Mr. Cushing, our minister\r\nin Madrid, with the Spanish Government for the payment by the latter to\r\nthe United States of the sum of $80,000 in coin, for the purpose of the\r\nrelief of the families or persons of the ship's company and certain\r\npassengers of the _Virginius_. This sum was to have been paid in three\r\ninstallments at two months each. It is due to the Spanish Government\r\nthat I should state that the payments were fully and spontaneously\r\nanticipated by that Government, and that the whole amount was paid\r\nwithin but a few days more than two months from the date of the\r\nagreement, a copy of which is herewith transmitted. In pursuance of the\r\nterms of the adjustment, I have directed the distribution of the amount\r\namong the parties entitled thereto, including the ship's company and\r\nsuch of the passengers as were American citizens. Payments are made\r\naccordingly, on the application by the parties entitled thereto.\r\n\r\nThe past year has furnished no evidence of an approaching termination\r\nof the ruinous conflict which has been raging for seven years in the\r\nneighboring island of Cuba. The same disregard of the laws of civilized\r\nwarfare and of the just demands of humanity which has heretofore called\r\nforth expressions of condemnation from the nations of Christendom has\r\ncontinued to blacken the sad scene. Desolation, ruin, and pillage are\r\npervading the rich fields of one of the most fertile and productive\r\nregions of the earth, and the incendiary's torch, firing plantations and\r\nvaluable factories and buildings, is the agent marking the alternate\r\nadvance or retreat of contending parties.\r\n\r\nThe protracted continuance of this strife seriously affects the\r\ninterests of all commercial nations, but those of the United States\r\nmore than others, by reason of close proximity, its larger trade and\r\nintercourse with Cuba, and the frequent and intimate personal and social\r\nrelations which have grown up between its citizens and those of the\r\nisland. Moreover, the property of our citizens in Cuba is large, and is\r\nrendered insecure and depreciated in value and in capacity of production\r\nby the continuance of the strife and the unnatural mode of its conduct.\r\nThe same is true, differing only in degree, with respect to the\r\ninterests and people of other nations; and the absence of any reasonable\r\nassurance of a near termination of the conflict must of necessity soon\r\ncompel the States thus suffering to consider what the interests of their\r\nown people and their duty toward themselves may demand.\r\n\r\nI have hoped that Spain would be enabled to establish peace in her\r\ncolony, to afford security to the property and the interests of our\r\ncitizens, and allow legitimate scope to trade and commerce and the\r\nnatural productions of the island. Because of this hope, and from an\r\nextreme reluctance to interfere in the most remote manner in the affairs\r\nof another and a friendly nation, especially of one whose sympathy and\r\nfriendship in the struggling infancy of our own existence must ever be\r\nremembered with gratitude, I have patiently and anxiously waited the\r\nprogress of events. Our own civil conflict is too recent for us not to\r\nconsider the difficulties which surround a government distracted by a\r\ndynastic rebellion at home at the same time that it has to cope with a\r\nseparate insurrection in a distant colony. But whatever causes may have\r\nproduced the situation which so grievously affects our interests, it\r\nexists, with all its attendant evils operating directly upon this\r\ncountry and its people. Thus far all the efforts of Spain have proved\r\nabortive, and time has marked no improvement in the situation. The armed\r\nbands of either side now occupy nearly the same ground as in the past,\r\nwith the difference, from time to time, of more lives sacrificed, more\r\nproperty destroyed, and wider extents of fertile and productive fields\r\nand more and more of valuable property constantly wantonly sacrificed\r\nto the incendiary's torch.\r\n\r\nIn contests of this nature, where a considerable body of people who have\r\nattempted to free themselves of the control of the superior government\r\nhave reached such point in occupation of territory, in power, and in\r\ngeneral organization as to constitute in fact a body politic; having a\r\ngovernment in substance as well as in name; possessed of the elements\r\nof stability and equipped with the machinery for the administration of\r\ninternal policy and the execution of its laws; prepared and able to\r\nadminister justice at home, as well as in its dealings with other\r\npowers, it is within the province of those other powers to recognize its\r\nexistence as a new and independent nation. In such cases other nations\r\nsimply deal with an actually existing condition of things, and recognize\r\nas one of the powers of the earth that body politic which, possessing\r\nthe necessary elements, has in fact become a new power. In a word, the\r\ncreation of a new state is a fact.\r\n\r\nTo establish the condition of things essential to the recognition of\r\nthis fact there must be a people occupying a known territory, united\r\nunder some known and defined form of government, acknowledged by those\r\nsubject thereto, in which the functions of government are administered\r\nby usual methods, competent to mete out justice to citizens and\r\nstrangers, to afford remedies for public and for private wrongs, and\r\nable to assume the correlative international obligations and capable of\r\nperforming the corresponding international duties resulting from its\r\nacquisition of the rights of sovereignty. A power should exist complete\r\nin its organization, ready to take and able to maintain its place among\r\nthe nations of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhile conscious that the insurrection in Cuba has shown a strength and\r\nendurance which make it at least doubtful whether it be in the power\r\nof Spain to subdue it, it seems unquestionable that no such civil\r\norganization exists which may be recognized as an independent government\r\ncapable of performing its international obligations and entitled to be\r\ntreated as one of the powers of the earth. A recognition under such\r\ncircumstances would be inconsistent with the facts, and would compel the\r\npower granting it soon to support by force the government to which it\r\nhad really given its only claim of existence. In my judgment the United\r\nStates should adhere to the policy and the principles which have\r\nheretofore been its sure and safe guides in like contests between\r\nrevolted colonies and their mother country, and, acting only upon the\r\nclearest evidence, should avoid any possibility of suspicion or of\r\nimputation.\r\n\r\nA recognition of the independence of Cuba being, in my opinion,\r\nimpracticable and indefensible, the question which next presents itself\r\nis that of the recognition of belligerent rights in the parties to the\r\ncontest. In a former message to Congress I had occasion to consider this\r\nquestion, and reached the conclusion that the conflict in Cuba, dreadful\r\nand devastating as were its incidents, did not rise to the fearful\r\ndignity of war. Regarding it now, after this lapse of time, I am unable\r\nto see that any notable success or any marked or real advance on the\r\npart of the insurgents has essentially changed the character of the\r\ncontest. It has acquired greater age, but not greater or more formidable\r\nproportions. It is possible that the acts of foreign powers, and even\r\nacts of Spain herself, of this very nature, might be pointed to in\r\ndefense of such recognition. But now, as in its past-history, the United\r\nStates should carefully avoid the false lights which might lead it into\r\nthe mazes of doubtful law and of questionable propriety, and adhere\r\nrigidly and sternly to the rule, which has been its guide, of doing only\r\nthat which is right and honest and of good report. The question of\r\naccording or of withholding rights of belligerency must be judged in\r\nevery case in view of the particular attending facts. Unless justified\r\nby necessity, it is always, and justly, regarded as an unfriendly act\r\nand a gratuitous demonstration of moral support to the rebellion. It is\r\nnecessary, and it is required, when the interests and rights of another\r\ngovernment or of its people are so far affected by a pending civil\r\nconflict as to require a definition of its relations to the parties\r\nthereto. But this conflict must be one which will be recognized in the\r\nsense of international law as war. Belligerence, too, is a fact. The\r\nmere existence of contending armed bodies and their occasional conflicts\r\ndo not constitute war in the sense referred to. Applying to the existing\r\ncondition of affairs in Cuba the tests recognized by publicists and\r\nwriters on international law, and which have been observed by nations\r\nof dignity, honesty, and power when free from sensitive or selfish and\r\nunworthy motives, I fail to find in the insurrection the existence of\r\nsuch a substantial political organization, real, palpable, and manifest\r\nto the world, having the forms and capable of the ordinary functions of\r\ngovernment coward its own people and to other states, with courts for\r\nthe administration of justice, with a local habitation, possessing such\r\norganization of force, such material, such occupation of territory,\r\nas to take the contest out of the category of a mere rebellious\r\ninsurrection or occasional skirmishes and place it on the terrible\r\nfooting of war, to which a recognition of belligerency would aim to\r\nelevate it. The contest, moreover, is solely on land; the insurrection\r\nhas not possessed itself of a single seaport whence it may send forth\r\nits flag, nor has it any means of communication with foreign powers\r\nexcept through the military lines of its adversaries. No apprehension\r\nof any of those sudden and difficult complications which a war upon\r\nthe ocean is apt to precipitate upon the vessels, both commercial and\r\nnational, and upon the consular officers of other powers calls for the\r\ndefinition of their relations to the parties to the contest. Considered\r\nas a question of expediency, I regard the accordance of belligerent\r\nrights still to be as unwise and premature as I regard it to be, at\r\npresent, indefensible as a measure of right. Such recognition entails\r\nupon the country according the rights which flow from it difficult\r\nand complicated duties, and requires the exaction from the contending\r\nparties of the strict observance of their rights and obligations;\r\nit confers the right of search upon the high seas by vessels of both\r\nparties; it would subject the carrying of arms and munitions of war,\r\nwhich now may be transported freely and without interruption in the\r\nvessels of the United States, to detention and to possible seizure;\r\nit would give rise to countless vexatious questions, would release the\r\nparent Government from responsibility for acts done by the insurgents,\r\nand would invest Spain with the right to exercise the supervision\r\nrecognized by our treaty of 1795 over our commerce on the high seas,\r\na very large part of which, in its traffic between the Atlantic and\r\nthe Gulf States and between all of them and the States on the Pacific,\r\npasses through the waters which wash the shores of Cuba. The exercise of\r\nthis supervision could scarce fail to lead, if not to abuses, certainly\r\nto collisions perilous to the peaceful relations of the two States.\r\nThere can be little doubt to what result such supervision would before\r\nlong draw this nation. It would be unworthy of the United States to\r\ninaugurate the possibilities of such result by measures of questionable\r\nright or expediency or by any indirection. Apart from any question\r\nof theoretical right, I am satisfied that while the accordance of\r\nbelligerent rights to the insurgents in Cuba might give them a hope and\r\nan inducement to protract the struggle, it would be but a delusive hope,\r\nand would not remove the evils which this Government and its people are\r\nexperiencing, but would draw the United States into complications which\r\nit has waited long and already suffered much to avoid. The recognition\r\nof independence or of belligerency being thus, in my judgment, equally\r\ninadmissible, it remains to consider what course shall be adopted should\r\nthe conflict not soon be brought to an end by acts of the parties\r\nthemselves, and should the evils which result therefrom, affecting all\r\nnations, and particularly the United States, continue. In such event\r\nI am of opinion that other nations will be compelled to assume the\r\nresponsibility which devolves upon them, and to seriously consider the\r\nonly remaining measures possible--mediation and intervention. Owing,\r\nperhaps, to the large expanse of water separating the island from the\r\npeninsula, the want of harmony and of personal sympathy between the\r\ninhabitants of the colony and those sent thither to rule them, and want\r\nof adaptation of the ancient colonial system of Europe to the present\r\ntimes and to the ideas which the events of the past century have\r\ndeveloped, the contending parties appear to have within themselves\r\nno depository of common confidence to suggest wisdom when passion and\r\nexcitement have their sway and to assume the part of peacemaker. In this\r\nview in the earlier days of the contest the good offices of the United\r\nStates as a mediator were tendered in good faith, without any selfish\r\npurpose, in the interest of humanity and in sincere friendship for both\r\nparties, but were at the time declined by Spain, with the declaration,\r\nnevertheless, that at a future time they would be indispensable. No\r\nintimation has been received that in the opinion of Spain that time has\r\nbeen reached. And yet the strife continues, with all its dread horrors\r\nand all its injuries to the interests of the United States and of other\r\nnations. Each party seems quite capable of working great injury and\r\ndamage to the other, as well as to all the relations and interests\r\ndependent on the existence of peace in the island; but they seem\r\nincapable of reaching any adjustment, and both have thus far failed of\r\nachieving any success whereby one party shall possess and control the\r\nisland to the exclusion of the other. Under these circumstances the\r\nagency of others, either by mediation or by intervention, seems to be\r\nthe only alternative which must, sooner or later, be invoked for the\r\ntermination of the strife. At the same time, while thus impressed I do\r\nnot at this time recommend the adoption of any measure of intervention.\r\nI shall be ready at all times, and as the equal friend of both parties,\r\nto respond to a suggestion that the good offices of the United States\r\nwill be acceptable to aid in bringing about a peace honorable to both.\r\nIt is due to Spain, so far as this Government is concerned, that the\r\nagency of a third power, to which I have adverted, shall be adopted only\r\nas a last expedient. Had it been the desire of the United States to\r\ninterfere in the affairs of Cuba, repeated opportunities for so doing\r\nhave been presented within the last few years; but we have remained\r\npassive, and have performed our whole duty and all international\r\nobligations to Spain with friendship, fairness, and fidelity, and with\r\na spirit of patience and forbearance which negatives every possible\r\nsuggestion of desire to interfere or to add to the difficulties with\r\nwhich she has been surrounded.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Spain has recently submitted to our minister at\r\nMadrid certain proposals which it is hoped may be found to be the basis,\r\nif not the actual submission, of terms to meet the requirements of the\r\nparticular griefs of which this Government has felt itself entitled to\r\ncomplain. These proposals have not yet reached me in their full text.\r\nOn their arrival they will be taken into careful examination, and may,\r\nI hope, lead to a satisfactory adjustment of the questions to which\r\nthey refer and remove the possibility of future occurrences such as\r\nhave given rise to our just complaints.\r\n\r\nIt is understood also that renewed efforts are being made to introduce\r\nreforms in the internal administration of the island. Persuaded,\r\nhowever, that a proper regard for the interests of the United States and\r\nof its citizens entitles it to relief from the strain to which it has\r\nbeen subjected by the difficulties of the questions and the wrongs and\r\nlosses which arise from the contest in Cuba, and that the interests of\r\nhumanity itself demand the cessation of the strife before the whole\r\nisland shall be laid waste and larger sacrifices of life be made, I\r\nshall feel it my duty, should my hopes of a satisfactory adjustment and\r\nof the early restoration of peace and the removal of future causes of\r\ncomplaint be, unhappily, disappointed, to make a further communication\r\nto Congress at some period not far remote, and during the present\r\nsession, recommending what may then seem to me to be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe free zone, so called, several years since established by the Mexican\r\nGovernment in certain of the States of that Republic adjacent to our\r\nfrontier, remains in full operation. It has always been materially\r\ninjurious to honest traffic, for it operates as an incentive to traders\r\nin Mexico to supply without customs charges the wants of inhabitants on\r\nthis side of the line, and prevents the same wants from being supplied\r\nby merchants of the United States, thereby to a considerable extent\r\ndefrauding our revenue and checking honest commercial enterprise.\r\n\r\nDepredations by armed bands from Mexico on the people of Texas near\r\nthe frontier continue. Though the main object of these incursions is\r\nrobbery, they frequently result in the murder of unarmed and peaceably\r\ndisposed persons, and in some instances even the United States\r\npost-offices and mail communications have been attacked. Renewed\r\nremonstrances upon this subject have been addressed to the Mexican\r\nGovernment, but without much apparent effect. The military force of this\r\nGovernment disposable for service in that quarter is quite inadequate to\r\neffectually guard the line, even at those points where the incursions\r\nare usually made. An experiment of an armed vessel on the Rio Grande for\r\nthat purpose is on trial, and it is hoped that, if not thwarted by the\r\nshallowness of the river and other natural obstacles, it may materially\r\ncontribute to the protection of the herdsmen of Texas.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the joint commission under the convention between\r\nthe United States and Mexico of the 4th of July, 1868, on the subject of\r\nclaims, will soon be brought to a close. The result of those proceedings\r\nwill then be communicated to Congress.\r\n\r\nI am happy to announce that the Government of Venezuela has, upon\r\nfurther consideration, practically abandoned its objection to pay\r\nto the United States that share of its revenue which some years\r\nsince it allotted toward the extinguishment of the claims of foreigners\r\ngenerally. In thus reconsidering its determination that Government has\r\nshown a just sense of self-respect which can not fail to reflect credit\r\nupon it in the eyes of all disinterested persons elsewhere. It is to be\r\nregretted, however, that its payments on account of claims of citizens\r\nof the United States are still so meager in amount, and that the\r\nstipulations of the treaty in regard to the sums to be paid and the\r\nperiods when those payments were to take place should have been so\r\nsignally disregarded.\r\n\r\nSince my last annual message the exchange has been made of the\r\nratification of a treaty of commerce and navigation with Belgium, and\r\nof conventions with the Mexican Republic for the further extension of\r\nthe joint commission respecting claims; with the Hawaiian Islands for\r\ncommercial reciprocity, and with the Ottoman Empire for extradition; all\r\nof which have been duly proclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims has prosecuted its\r\nimportant duties very assiduously and very satisfactorily. It convened\r\nand was organized on the 22d day of July, 1874, and by the terms of the\r\nact under which it was created was to exist for one year from that date.\r\nThe act provided, however, that should it be found impracticable to\r\ncomplete the work of the court before the expiration of the year the\r\nPresident might by proclamation extend the time of its duration to a\r\nperiod not more than six months beyond the expiration of the one year.\r\n\r\nHaving received satisfactory evidence that it would be impracticable\r\nto complete the work within the time originally fixed, I issued a\r\nproclamation[97] (a copy of which is presented herewith) extending the\r\ntime of duration of the court for a period of six months from and after\r\nthe 22d day of July last.\r\n\r\nA report made through the clerk of the court (communicated herewith)\r\nshows the condition of the calendar on the 1st of November last and the\r\nlarge amount of work which has been accomplished. One thousand three\r\nhundred and eighty-two claims have been presented, of which 682 had been\r\ndisposed of at the date of the report. I am informed that 170 cases were\r\ndecided during the month of November. Arguments are being made and\r\ndecisions given in the remaining cases with all the dispatch consistent\r\nwith the proper consideration of the questions submitted. Many of these\r\nclaims are in behalf of mariners, or depend on the evidence of mariners,\r\nwhose absence has delayed the taking or the return of the necessary\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nIt is represented to me that it will be impracticable for the court to\r\nfinally dispose of all the cases before it within the present limit of\r\nits duration. Justice to the parties claimant, who have been at large\r\nexpense in preparing their claims and obtaining the evidence in their\r\nsupport, suggests a short extension, to enable the court to dispose of\r\nall of the claims which have been presented.\r\n\r\nI recommend the legislation which may be deemed proper to enable the\r\ncourt to complete the work before it.\r\n\r\nI recommend that some suitable provision be made, by the creation of\r\na special court or by conferring the necessary jurisdiction upon some\r\nappropriate tribunal, for the consideration and determination of the\r\nclaims of aliens against the Government of the United States which have\r\narisen within some reasonable limitation of time, or which may hereafter\r\narise, excluding all claims barred by treaty provisions or otherwise. It\r\nhas been found impossible to give proper consideration to these claims\r\nby the Executive Departments of the Government. Such a tribunal would\r\nafford an opportunity to aliens other than British subjects to present\r\ntheir claims on account of acts committed against their persons or\r\nproperty during the rebellion, as also to those subjects of Great\r\nBritain whose claims, having arisen subsequent to the 9th day of April,\r\n1865, could not be presented to the late commission organized pursuant\r\nto the provisions of the treaty of Washington.\r\n\r\nThe electric telegraph has become an essential and indispensable agent\r\nin the transmission of business and social messages. Its operation on\r\nland, and within the limit of particular states, is necessarily under\r\nthe control of the jurisdiction within which it operates. The lines on\r\nthe high seas, however, are not subject to the particular control of any\r\none government.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 a concession was granted by the French Government to a company\r\nwhich proposed to lay a cable from the shores of France to the United\r\nStates. At that time there was a telegraphic connection between the\r\nUnited States and the continent of Europe (through the possessions\r\nof Great Britain at either end of the line), under the control of an\r\nassociation which had, at large outlay of capital and at great risk,\r\ndemonstrated the practicability of maintaining such means of\r\ncommunication. The cost of correspondence by this agency was great,\r\npossibly not too large at the time for a proper remuneration for so\r\nhazardous and so costly an enterprise. It was, however, a heavy charge\r\nupon a means of communication which the progress in the social and\r\ncommercial intercourse of the world found to be a necessity, and the\r\nobtaining of this French concession showed that other capital than that\r\nalready invested was ready to enter into competition, with assurance of\r\nadequate return for their outlay. Impressed with the conviction that the\r\ninterests, not only of the people of the United States, but of the world\r\nat large, demanded, or would demand, the multiplication of such means\r\nof communication between separated continents, I was desirous that the\r\nproposed connection should be made; but certain provisions of this\r\nconcession were deemed by me to be objectionable, particularly one\r\nwhich gave for a long term of years the exclusive right of telegraphic\r\ncommunication by submarine cable between the shores of France and the\r\nUnited States. I could not concede that any power should claim the right\r\nto land a cable on the shores of the United States and at the same time\r\ndeny to the United States, or to its citizens or grantees, an equal\r\nright to land a cable on its shores. The right to control the conditions\r\nfor the laying of a cable within the jurisdictional waters of the United\r\nStates, to connect our shores with those of any foreign state, pertains\r\nexclusively to the Government of the United States, under such\r\nlimitations and conditions as Congress may impose. In the absence of\r\nlegislation by Congress I was unwilling, on the one hand, to yield to\r\na foreign state the right to say that its grantees might land on our\r\nshores while it denied a similar right to our people to land on its\r\nshores, and, on the other hand, I was reluctant to deny to the great\r\ninterests of the world and of civilization the facilities of such\r\ncommunication as were proposed. I therefore withheld any resistance\r\nto the landing of the cable on condition that the offensive monopoly\r\nfeature of the concession be abandoned, and that the right of any cable\r\nwhich may be established by authority of this Government to land upon\r\nFrench territory and to connect with French land lines and enjoy all the\r\nnecessary facilities or privileges incident to the use thereof upon as\r\nfavorable terms as any other company be conceded. As the result thereof\r\nthe company in question renounced the exclusive privilege, and the\r\nrepresentative of France was informed that, understanding this\r\nrelinquishment to be construed as granting the entire reciprocity and\r\nequal facilities which had been demanded, the opposition to the landing\r\nof the cable was withdrawn. The cable, under this French concession,\r\nwas landed in the month of July, 1869, and has been an efficient and\r\nvaluable agent of communication between this country and the other\r\ncontinent. It soon passed under the control, however, of those who\r\nhad the management of the cable connecting Great Britain with this\r\ncontinent, and thus whatever benefit to the public might have ensued\r\nfrom competition between the two lines was lost, leaving only the\r\ngreater facilities of an additional line and the additional security in\r\ncase of accident to one of them. But these increased facilities and this\r\nadditional security, together with the control of the combined capital\r\nof the two companies, gave also greater power to prevent the future\r\nconstruction of other lines and to limit the control of telegraphic\r\ncommunication between the two continents to those possessing the lines\r\nalready laid. Within a few months past a cable has been laid, known as\r\nthe United States Direct Cable Company, connecting the United States\r\ndirectly with Great Britain. As soon as this cable was reported to be\r\nlaid and in working order the rates of the then existing consolidated\r\ncompanies were greatly reduced. Soon, however, a break was announced in\r\nthis new cable, and immediately the rates of the other line, which had\r\nbeen reduced, were again raised. This cable being now repaired, the\r\nrates appear not to be reduced by either line from those formerly\r\ncharged by the consolidated companies.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that large amounts of capital, both at home\r\nand abroad, are ready to seek profitable investment in the advancement\r\nof this useful and most civilizing means of intercourse and\r\ncorrespondence. They await, however, the assurance of the means and\r\nconditions on which they may safely be made tributary to the general\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nAs these cable telegraph lines connect separate states, there are\r\nquestions as to their organization and control which probably can be\r\nbest, if not solely, settled by conventions between the respective\r\nstates. In the absence, however, of international conventions on the\r\nsubject, municipal legislation may secure many points which appear to me\r\nimportant, if not indispensable for the protection of the public against\r\nthe extortions which may result from a monopoly of the right of\r\noperating cable telegrams or from a combination between several lines:\r\n\r\nI. No line should be allowed to land on the shores of the United States\r\nunder the concession from another power which does not admit the right\r\nof any other line or lines, formed in the United States, to land and\r\nfreely connect with and operate through its land lines.\r\n\r\nII. No line should be allowed to land on the shores of the United States\r\nwhich is not, by treaty stipulation with the government from whose\r\nshores it proceeds, or by prohibition in its charter, or otherwise to\r\nthe satisfaction of this Government, prohibited from consolidating or\r\namalgamating with any other cable telegraph line, or combining therewith\r\nfor the purpose of regulating and maintaining the cost of telegraphing.\r\n\r\nIII. All lines should be bound to give precedence in the transmission of\r\nthe official messages of the governments of the two countries between\r\nwhich it may be laid.\r\n\r\nIV. A power should be reserved to the two governments, either conjointly\r\nor to each, as regards the messages dispatched from its shores, to fix a\r\nlimit to the charges to be demanded for the transmission of messages.\r\n\r\nI present this subject to the earnest consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, and unless Congress otherwise direct, I shall not\r\noppose the landing of any telegraphic cable which complies with and\r\nassents to the points above enumerated, but will feel it my duty to\r\nprevent the landing of any which does not conform to the first and\r\nsecond points as stated, and which will not stipulate to concede to this\r\nGovernment the precedence in the transmission of its official messages\r\nand will not enter into a satisfactory arrangement with regard to its\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\nAmong the pressing and important subjects to which, in my opinion,\r\nthe attention of Congress should be directed are those relating to\r\nfraudulent naturalization and expatriation.\r\n\r\nThe United States, with great liberality, offers its citizenship\r\nto all who in good faith comply with the requirements of law. These\r\nrequirements are as simple and upon as favorable terms to the emigrant\r\nas the high privilege to which he is admitted can or should permit.\r\nI do not propose any additional requirements to those which the law now\r\ndemands; but the very simplicity and the want of unnecessary formality\r\nin our law have made fraudulent naturalization not infrequent, to\r\nthe discredit and injury of all honest citizens, whether native or\r\nnaturalized. Cases of this character are continually being brought to\r\nthe notice of the Government by our representatives abroad, and also\r\nthose of persons resident in other countries, most frequently those who,\r\nif they have remained in this country long enough to entitle them to\r\nbecome naturalized, have generally not much overpassed that period,\r\nand have returned to the country of their origin, where they reside,\r\navoiding all duties to the United States by their absence, and claiming\r\nto be exempt from all duties to the country of their nativity and of\r\ntheir residence by reason of their alleged naturalization. It is due to\r\nthis Government itself and to the great mass of the naturalized citizens\r\nwho entirely, both in name and in fact, become citizens of the United\r\nStates that the high privilege of citizenship of the United States\r\nshould not be held by fraud or in derogation of the laws and of the good\r\nname of every honest citizen. On many occasions it has been brought to\r\nthe knowledge of the Government that certificates of naturalization are\r\nheld and protection or interference claimed by parties who admit that\r\nnot only they were not within the United States at the time of the\r\npretended naturalization, but that they have never resided in the United\r\nStates; in others the certificate and record of the court show on their\r\nface that the person claiming to be naturalized had not resided the\r\nrequired time in the United States; in others it is admitted upon\r\nexamination that the requirements of law have not been complied with;\r\nin some cases, even, such certificates have been matter of purchase.\r\nThese are not isolated cases, arising at rare intervals, but of common\r\noccurrence, and which are reported from all quarters of the globe. Such\r\noccurrences can not, and do not, fail to reflect upon the Government\r\nand injure all honest citizens. Such a fraud being discovered, however,\r\nthere is no practicable means within the control of the Government\r\nby which the record of naturalization can be vacated; and should the\r\ncertificate be taken up, as it usually is, by the diplomatic and\r\nconsular representatives of the Government to whom it may have been\r\npresented, there is nothing to prevent the person claiming to have been\r\nnaturalized from obtaining a new certificate from the court in place of\r\nthat which has been taken from him.\r\n\r\nThe evil has become so great and of such frequent occurrence that I can\r\nnot too earnestly recommend that some effective measures be adopted to\r\nprovide a proper remedy and means for the vacating of any record thus\r\nfraudulently made, and of punishing the guilty parties to the\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I refer also to the question of expatriation and the\r\nelection of nationality.\r\n\r\nThe United States was foremost in upholding the right of expatriation,\r\nand was principally instrumental in overthrowing the doctrine of\r\nperpetual allegiance. Congress has declared the right of expatriation\r\nto be a natural and inherent right of all people; but while many other\r\nnations have enacted laws providing what formalities shall be necessary\r\nto work a change of allegiance, the United States has enacted no\r\nprovisions of law and has in no respect marked out how and when\r\nexpatriation may be accomplished by its citizens. Instances are brought\r\nto the attention of the Government where citizens of the United States,\r\neither naturalized or native born, have formally become citizens or\r\nsubjects of foreign powers, but who, nevertheless, in the absence\r\nof any provisions of legislation on this question, when involved in\r\ndifficulties or when it seems to be their interest, claim to be citizens\r\nof the United States and demand the intervention of a Government which\r\nthey have long since abandoned and to which for years they have rendered\r\nno service nor held themselves in any way amenable.\r\n\r\nIn other cases naturalized citizens, immediately after\r\nnaturalization, have returned to their native country; have become\r\nengaged in business; have accepted offices or pursuits inconsistent with\r\nAmerican citizenship, and evidence no intent to return to the United\r\nStates until called upon to discharge some duty to the country where\r\nthey are residing, when at once they assert their citizenship and call\r\nupon the representatives of the Government to aid them in their unjust\r\npretensions. It is but justice to all _bona fide_ citizens that no doubt\r\nshould exist on such questions, and that Congress should determine by\r\nenactment of law how expatriation may be accomplished and change of\r\ncitizenship be established.\r\n\r\nI also invite your attention to the necessity of regulating by law the\r\nstatus of American women who may marry foreigners, and of defining more\r\nfully that of children born in a foreign country of American parents\r\nwho may reside abroad; and also of some further provision regulating\r\nor giving legal effect to marriages of American citizens contracted in\r\nforeign countries. The correspondence submitted herewith shows a few\r\nof the constantly occurring questions on these points presented to the\r\nconsideration of the Government. There are few subjects to engage the\r\nattention of Congress on which more delicate relations or more important\r\ninterests are dependent.\r\n\r\nIn the month of July last the building erected for the Department\r\nof State was taken possession of and occupied by that Department.\r\nI am happy to announce that the archives and valuable papers of the\r\nGovernment in the custody of that Department are now safely deposited\r\nand properly cared for.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury shows the receipts\r\nfrom customs for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1874, to have\r\nbeen $163,103,833.69, and for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1875,\r\nto have been $157,167,722.35, a decrease for the last fiscal year of\r\n$5,936,111.34. Receipts from internal revenue for the year ending the\r\n30th of June, 1874, were $102,409,784.90, and for the year ending June\r\n30, 1875, $110,007,493.58; increase, $7,597,708.68.\r\n\r\nThe report also shows a complete history of the workings of the\r\nDepartment for the last year, and contains recommendations for reforms\r\nand for legislation which I concur in, but can not comment on so fully\r\nas I should like to do if space would permit, but will confine myself\r\nto a few suggestions which I look upon as vital to the best interests\r\nof the whole people--coining within the purview of \"Treasury;\" I mean\r\nspecie resumption. Too much stress can not be laid upon this question,\r\nand I hope Congress may be induced, at the earliest day practicable,\r\nto insure the consummation of the act of the last Congress, at its\r\nlast session, to bring about specie resumption \"on and after the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1879,\" at furthest. It would be a great blessing if this could\r\nbe consummated even at an earlier day.\r\n\r\nNothing seems to me more certain than that a full, healthy, and\r\npermanent reaction can not take place in favor of the industries and\r\nfinancial welfare of the country until we return to a measure of values\r\nrecognized throughout the civilized world. While we use a currency not\r\nequivalent to this standard the world's recognized standard, specie,\r\nbecomes a commodity like the products of the soil, the surplus seeking\r\na market wherever there is a demand for it.\r\n\r\nUnder our present system we should want none, nor would we have any,\r\nwere it not that customs dues must be paid in coin and because of the\r\npledge to pay interest on the public debt in coin. The yield of precious\r\nmetals would flow out for the purchase of foreign productions and leave\r\nthe United States \"hewers of wood and drawers of water,\" because of\r\nwiser legislation on the subject of finance by the nations with whom\r\nwe have dealings. I am not prepared to say that I can suggest the best\r\nlegislation to secure the end most heartily recommended. It will be a\r\nsource of great gratification to me to be able to approve any measure\r\nof Congress looking effectively toward securing \"resumption.\"\r\n\r\nUnlimited inflation would probably bring about specie payments more\r\nspeedily than any legislation looking to redemption of the legal-tenders\r\nin coin; but it would be at the expense of honor. The legal-tenders\r\nwould have no value beyond settling present liabilities, or, properly\r\nspeaking, repudiating them. They would buy nothing after debts were all\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\nThere are a few measures which seem to me important in this connection\r\nand which I commend to your earnest consideration:\r\n\r\nA repeal of so much of the legal-tender act as makes these notes\r\nreceivable for debts contracted after a date to be fixed in the act\r\nitself, say not later than the 1st of January, 1877. We should then have\r\nquotations at real values, not fictitious ones. Gold would no longer be\r\nat a premium, but currency at a discount. A healthy reaction would set\r\nin at once, and with it a desire to make the currency equal to what it\r\npurports to be. The merchants, manufacturers, and tradesmen of every\r\ncalling could do business on a fair margin of profit, the money to be\r\nreceived having an unvarying value. Laborers and all classes who work\r\nfor stipulated pay or salary would receive more for their income,\r\nbecause extra profits would no longer be charged by the capitalists to\r\ncompensate for the risk of a downward fluctuation in the value of the\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nSecond. That the Secretary of the Treasury be authorized to redeem, say,\r\nnot to exceed $2,000,000 monthly of legal-tender notes, by issuing in\r\ntheir stead a long bond, bearing interest at the rate of 3.65 per cent\r\nper annum, of denominations ranging from $50 up to $1,000 each. This\r\nwould in time reduce the legal-tender notes to a volume that could be\r\nkept afloat without demanding redemption in large sums suddenly.\r\n\r\nThird. That additional power be given to the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nto accumulate gold for final redemption, either by increasing revenue,\r\ncurtailing expenses, or both (it is preferable to do both); and I\r\nrecommend that reduction of expenditures be made wherever it can be done\r\nwithout impairing Government obligations or crippling the due execution\r\nthereof. One measure for increasing the revenue--and the only one I\r\nthink of--is the restoration of the duty on tea and coffee. These duties\r\nwould add probably $18,000,000 to the present amount received from\r\nimports, and would in no way increase the prices paid for those articles\r\nby the consumers.\r\n\r\nThese articles are the products of countries collecting revenue from\r\nexports, and as we, the largest consumers, reduce the duties they\r\nproportionately increase them. With this addition to the revenue, many\r\nduties now collected, and which give but an insignificant return for the\r\ncost of collection, might be remitted, and to the direct advantage of\r\nconsumers at home.\r\n\r\nI would mention those articles which enter into manufactures of all\r\nsorts. All duty paid upon such articles goes directly to the cost of the\r\narticle when manufactured here, and must be paid for by the consumers.\r\nThese duties not only come from the consumers at home, but act as a\r\nprotection to foreign manufacturers of the same completed articles in\r\nour own and distant markets.\r\n\r\nI will suggest or mention another subject bearing upon the problem of\r\n\"how to enable the Secretary of the Treasury to accumulate balances.\"\r\nIt is to devise some better method of verifying claims against the\r\nGovernment than at present exists through the Court of Claims,\r\nespecially those claims growing out of the late war. Nothing is more\r\ncertain than that a very large percentage of the amounts passed and\r\npaid are either wholly fraudulent or are far in excess of the real\r\nlosses sustained. The large amount of losses proven--on good testimony\r\naccording to existing laws, by affidavits of fictitious or unscrupulous\r\npersons--to have been sustained on small farms and plantations are not\r\nonly far beyond the possible yield of those places for any one year,\r\nbut, as everyone knows who has had experience in tilling the soil and\r\nwho has visited the scenes of these spoliations, are in many instances\r\nmore than the individual claimants were ever worth, including their\r\npersonal and real estate.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Attorney-General, which will be submitted to Congress\r\nat an early day, will contain a detailed history of awards made and of\r\nclaims pending of the class here referred to.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War, accompanying this message, gives a\r\ndetailed account of Army operations for the year just passed, expenses\r\nfor maintenance, etc., with recommendations for legislation to which I\r\nrespectfully invite your attention. To some of these I invite special\r\nattention:\r\n\r\nFirst. The necessity of making $300,000 of the appropriation for the\r\nSubsistence Department available before the beginning of the next fiscal\r\nyear. Without this provision troops at points distant from supply\r\nproduction must either go without food or existing laws must be\r\nviolated. It is not attended with cost to the Treasury.\r\n\r\nSecond. His recommendation for the enactment of a system of annuities\r\nfor the families of deceased officers by voluntary deductions from the\r\nmonthly pay of officers. This again is not attended with burden upon the\r\nTreasury, and would for the future relieve much distress which every old\r\narmy officer has witnessed in the past--of officers dying suddenly or\r\nbeing killed, leaving families without even the means of reaching their\r\nfriends, if fortunate enough to have friends to aid them.\r\n\r\nThird. The repeal of the law abolishing mileage, and a return to the old\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nFourth. The trial with torpedoes under the Corps of Engineers, and\r\nappropriation for the same. Should war ever occur between the United\r\nStates and any maritime power, torpedoes will be among if not the most\r\neffective and cheapest auxiliary for the defense of harbors, and also in\r\naggressive operations, that we can have. Hence it is advisable to learn\r\nby experiment their best construction and application, as well as\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nFifth. A permanent organization for the Signal-Service Corps. This\r\nservice has now become a necessity of peace as well as war, under the\r\nadvancement made by the present able management.\r\n\r\nSixth. A renewal of the appropriation for compiling the official records\r\nof the war, etc.\r\n\r\nThe condition of our Navy at this time is a subject of satisfaction.\r\nIt does not contain, it is true, any of the powerful cruising ironclads\r\nwhich make so much of the maritime strength of some other nations, but\r\nneither our continental situation nor our foreign policy requires that\r\nwe should have a large number of ships of this character, while this\r\nsituation and the nature of our ports combine to make those of other\r\nnations little dangerous to us under any circumstances.\r\n\r\nOur Navy does contain, however, a considerable number of ironclads of\r\nthe monitor class, which, though not properly cruisers, are powerful and\r\neffective for harbor defense and for operations near our own shores.\r\nOf these all the single-turreted ones, fifteen in number, have been\r\nsubstantially rebuilt, their rotten wooden beams replaced with iron,\r\ntheir hulls strengthened, and their engines and machinery thoroughly\r\nrepaired, so that they are now in the most efficient condition and ready\r\nfor sea as soon as they can be manned and put in commission.\r\n\r\nThe five double-turreted ironclads belonging to our Navy, by far the\r\nmost powerful of our ships for fighting purposes, are also in hand\r\nundergoing complete repairs, and could be ready for sea in periods\r\nvarying from four to six months. With these completed according to the\r\npresent design and our two iron torpedo boats now ready, our ironclad\r\nfleet will be, for the purposes of defense at home, equal to any force\r\nthat can readily be brought against it.\r\n\r\nOf our wooden navy also cruisers of various sizes, to the number of\r\nabout forty, including those now in commission, are in the Atlantic, and\r\ncould be ready for duty as fast as men could be enlisted for those not\r\nalready in commission. Of these, one-third are in effect new ships, and\r\nthough some of the remainder need considerable repairs to their boilers\r\nand machinery, they all are, or can readily be made, effective.\r\n\r\nThis constitutes a fleet of more than fifty war ships, of which fifteen\r\nare ironclad, now in hand on the Atlantic coast. The Navy has been\r\nbrought to this condition by a judicious and practical application of\r\nwhat could be spared from the current appropriations of the last few\r\nyears and from that made to meet the possible emergency of two years\r\nago. It has been done quietly, without proclamation or display, and\r\nthough it has necessarily straitened the Department in its ordinary\r\nexpenditure, and, as far as the ironclads are concerned, has added\r\nnothing to the cruising force of the Navy, yet the result is not the\r\nless satisfactory because it is to be found in a great increase of real\r\nrather than apparent force. The expenses incurred in the maintenance of\r\nan effective naval force in all its branches are necessarily large, but\r\nsuch force is essential to our position, relations, and character, and\r\naffects seriously the weight of our principles and policy throughout the\r\nwhole sphere of national responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe estimates for the regular support of this branch of the service for\r\nthe next year amount to a little less in the aggregate than those made\r\nfor the current year; but some additional appropriations are asked for\r\nobjects not included in the ordinary maintenance of the Navy, but\r\nbelieved to be of pressing importance at this time. It would, in my\r\nopinion, be wise at once to afford sufficient means for the immediate\r\ncompletion of the five double-turreted monitors now undergoing repairs,\r\nwhich must otherwise advance slowly, and only as money can be spared\r\nfrom current expenses. Supplemented by these, our Navy, armed with the\r\ndestructive weapons of modern warfare, manned by our seamen, and in\r\ncharge of our instructed officers, will present a force powerful for\r\nthe home purposes of a responsible though peaceful nation.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General herewith transmitted gives a full\r\nhistory of the workings of the Department for the year just past. It\r\nwill be observed that the deficiency to be supplied from the General\r\nTreasury is increased over the amount required for the preceding year.\r\nIn a country so vast in area as the United States, with large portions\r\nsparsely settled, it must be expected that this important service will\r\nbe more or less a burden upon the Treasury for many years to come. But\r\nthere is no branch of the public service which interests the whole\r\npeople more than that of cheap and rapid transmission of the mails to\r\nevery inhabited part of our territory. Next to the free school, the\r\npost-office is the great educator of the people, and it may well receive\r\nthe support of the General Government.\r\n\r\nThe subsidy of $150,000 per annum given to vessels of the United States\r\nfor carrying the mails between New York and Rio de Janeiro having ceased\r\non the 30th day of September last, we are without direct mail facilities\r\nwith the South American States. This is greatly to be regretted, and\r\nI do not hesitate to recommend the authorization of a renewal of that\r\ncontract, and also that the service may be increased from monthly to\r\nsemi-monthly trips. The commercial advantages to be gained by a direct\r\nline of American steamers to the South American States will far outweigh\r\nthe expense of the service.\r\n\r\nBy act of Congress approved March 3, 1875, almost all matter, whether\r\nproperly mail matter or not, may be sent any distance through the mails,\r\nin packages not exceeding 4 pounds in weight, for the sum of 16 cents\r\nper pound. So far as the transmission of real mail matter goes, this\r\nwould seem entirely proper; but I suggest that the law be so amended as\r\nto exclude from the mails merchandise of all descriptions, and limit\r\nthis transportation to articles enumerated, and which may be classed as\r\nmail matter proper.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of gold in the Black Hills, a portion of the Sioux\r\nReservation, has had the effect to induce a large emigration of miners\r\nto that point. Thus far the effort to protect the treaty rights of the\r\nIndians to that section has been successful, but the next year will\r\ncertainly witness a large increase of such emigration. The negotiations\r\nfor the relinquishment of the gold fields having failed, it will be\r\nnecessary for Congress to adopt some measures to relieve the\r\nembarrassment growing out of the causes named. The Secretary of the\r\nInterior suggests that the supplies now appropriated for the sustenance\r\nof that people, being no longer obligatory under the treaty of 1868, but\r\nsimply a gratuity, may be issued or withheld at his discretion.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Indian Territory, to which I have referred in\r\nseveral of my former annual messages, remains practically unchanged.\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior has taken measures to obtain a full report\r\nof the condition of that Territory, and will make it the subject of a\r\nspecial report at an early day. It may then be necessary to make some\r\nfurther recommendation in regard to legislation for the government of\r\nthat Territory.\r\n\r\nThe steady growth and increase of the business of the Patent Office\r\nindicates in some measure the progress of the industrial activity of the\r\ncountry. The receipts of the office are in excess of its expenditures,\r\nand the office generally is in a prosperous and satisfactory condition.\r\n\r\nThe report of the General Land Office shows that there were 2,459,601\r\nacres less disposed of during this than during the last year. More than\r\none-half of this decrease was in lands disposed of under the homestead\r\nand timber-culture laws. The cause of this decrease is supposed to be\r\nfound in the grasshopper scourge and the droughts which prevailed so\r\nextensively in some of the frontier States and Territories during that\r\ntime as to discourage and deter entries by actual settlers. The cash\r\nreceipts were less by $690,322.23 than during the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThe entire surveyed area of the public domain is 680,253,094 acres, of\r\nwhich 26,077,531 acres were surveyed during the past year, leaving\r\n1,154,471,762 acres still unsurveyed.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner presents many interesting suggestions in\r\nregard to the management and disposition of the public domain and the\r\nmodification of existing laws, the apparent importance of which should\r\ninsure for them the careful consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe number of pensioners still continues to decrease, the highest number\r\nhaving been reached during the year ending June 30, 1873. During the\r\nlast year 11,557 names were added to the rolls, and 12,977 were dropped\r\ntherefrom, showing a net decrease of 1,420. But while the number of\r\npensioners has decreased, the annual amount due on the pension rolls has\r\nincreased $44,733.13. This is caused by the greatly increased average\r\nrate of pensions, which, by the liberal legislation of Congress, has\r\nincreased from $90.26 in 1872 to $103.91 in 1875 to each invalid\r\npensioner, an increase in the average rate of 15 per cent in the three\r\nyears. During the year ending June 30, 1875, there was paid on account\r\nof pensions, including the expenses of disbursement, $29,683,116, being\r\n$910,632 less than was paid the preceding year. This reduction in amount\r\nof expenditures was produced by the decrease in the amount of arrearages\r\ndue on allowed claims and on pensions the rate of which was increased by\r\nthe legislation of the preceding session of Congress. At the close of\r\nthe last fiscal year there were on the pension rolls 234,821 persons, of\r\nwhom 210,363 were army pensioners, 105,478 being invalids and 104,885\r\nwidows and dependent relatives; 3,420 were navy pensioners, of whom\r\n1,636 were invalids and 1,784 widows and dependent relatives; 21,038\r\nwere pensioners of the War of 1812, 15,875 of whom were survivors and\r\n5,163 were widows.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that $29,535,000 will be required for the payment of\r\npensions for the next fiscal year, an amount $965,000 less than the\r\nestimate for the present year.\r\n\r\nThe geological explorations have been prosecuted with energy during the\r\nyear, covering an area of about 40,000 square miles in the Territories\r\nof Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico, developing the agricultural and\r\nmineral resources and furnishing interesting scientific and\r\ntopographical details of that region.\r\n\r\nThe method for the treatment of the Indians adopted at the beginning\r\nof my first term has been steadily pursued, and with satisfactory and\r\nencouraging results. It has been productive of evident improvement in\r\nthe condition of that race, and will be continued, with only such\r\nmodifications as further experience may indicate to be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe board heretofore appointed to take charge of the articles and\r\nmaterials pertaining to the War, the Navy, the Treasury, the Interior,\r\nand the Post-Office Departments, and the Department of Agriculture,\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution, and the Commission of Food Fishes, to be\r\ncontributed, under the legislation of last session, to the international\r\nexhibition to be held at Philadelphia during the centennial year 1876,\r\nhas been diligent in the discharge of the duties which have devolved\r\nupon it; and the preparations so far made with the means at command\r\ngive assurance that the governmental contribution will be made one of\r\nthe marked characteristics of the exhibition. The board has observed\r\ncommendable economy in the matter of the erection of a building for\r\nthe governmental exhibit, the expense of which it is estimated will not\r\nexceed, say, $80,000. This amount has been withdrawn, under the law,\r\nfrom the appropriations of five of the principal Departments, which\r\nleaves some of those Departments without sufficient means to render\r\ntheir respective practical exhibits complete and satisfactory. The\r\nexhibition being an international one, and the Government being a\r\nvoluntary contributor, it is my opinion that its contribution should be\r\nof a character, in quality and extent, to sustain the dignity and credit\r\nof so distinguished a contributor. The advantages to the country of a\r\ncreditable display are, in an international point of view, of the first\r\nimportance, while an indifferent or uncreditable participation by the\r\nGovernment would be humiliating to the patriotic feelings of our people\r\nthemselves. I commend the estimates of the board for the necessary\r\nadditional appropriations to the favorable consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe powers of Europe almost without exception, many of the South\r\nAmerican States, and even the more distant Eastern powers have\r\nmanifested their friendly sentiments toward the United States and the\r\ninterest of the world in our progress by taking steps to join with us\r\nin celebrating the centennial of the nation, and I strongly recommend\r\nthat a more national importance be given to this exhibition by such\r\nlegislation and by such appropriation as will insure its success. Its\r\nvalue in bringing to our shores innumerable useful works of art and\r\nskill, the commingling of the citizens of foreign countries and our\r\nown, and the interchange of ideas and manufactures will far exceed any\r\npecuniary outlay we may make.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the report of the Commissioner of Agriculture,\r\ntogether with the reports of the Commissioners, the board of audit,\r\nand the board of health of the District of Columbia, to all of which\r\nI invite your attention.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Agriculture has accomplished much in disseminating useful\r\nknowledge to the agriculturist, and also in introducing new and useful\r\nproductions adapted to our soil and climate, and is worthy of the\r\ncontinued encouragement of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Education, which accompanies the\r\nreport of the Secretary of the Interior, shows a gratifying progress in\r\neducational matters.\r\n\r\nIn nearly every annual message that I have had the honor of transmitting\r\nto Congress I have called attention to the anomalous, not to say\r\nscandalous, condition of affairs existing in the Territory of Utah, and\r\nhave asked for definite legislation to correct it. That polygamy should\r\nexist in a free, enlightened, and Christian country, without the power\r\nto punish so flagrant a crime against decency and morality, seems\r\npreposterous. True, there is no law to sustain this unnatural vice; but\r\nwhat is needed is a law to punish it as a crime, and at the same time to\r\nfix the status of the innocent children, the offspring of this system,\r\nand of the possibly innocent plural wives. But as an institution\r\npolygamy should be banished from the land.\r\n\r\nWhile this is being done I invite the attention of Congress to another,\r\nthough perhaps no less an evil--the importation of Chinese women, but\r\nfew of whom are brought to our shores to pursue honorable or useful\r\noccupations.\r\n\r\nObservations while visiting the Territories of Wyoming, Utah, and\r\nColorado during the past autumn convinced me that existing laws\r\nregulating the disposition of public lands, timber, etc., and probably\r\nthe mining laws themselves, are very defective and should be carefully\r\namended, and at an early day. Territory where cultivation of the soil\r\ncan only be followed by irrigation, and where irrigation is not\r\npracticable the lands can only be used as pasturage, and this only where\r\nstock can reach water (to quench its thirst), can not be governed by the\r\nsame laws as to entries as lands every acre of which is an independent\r\nestate by itself.\r\n\r\nLand must be held in larger quantities to justify the expense of\r\nconducting water upon it to make it fruitful, or to justify utilizing\r\nit as pasturage. The timber in most of the Territories is principally\r\nconfined to the mountain regions, which are held for entry in small\r\nquantities only, and as mineral lands. The timber is the property of the\r\nUnited States, for the disposal of which there is now no adequate law.\r\nThe settler must become a consumer of this timber, whether he lives upon\r\nthe plain or engages in working the mines. Hence every man becomes\r\neither a trespasser himself or knowingly a patron of trespassers.\r\n\r\nMy opportunities for observation were not sufficient to justify me in\r\nrecommending specific legislation on these subjects, but I do recommend\r\nthat a joint committee of the two Houses of Congress, sufficiently large\r\nto be divided into subcommittees, be organized to visit all the mining\r\nStates and Territories during the coming summer, and that the committee\r\nshall report to Congress at the next session such laws or amendments\r\nto laws as it may deem necessary to secure the best interests of the\r\nGovernment and the people of these Territories, who are doing so much\r\nfor their development.\r\n\r\nI am sure the citizens occupying the territory described do not wish to\r\nbe trespassers, nor will they be if legal ways are provided for them to\r\nbecome owners of these actual necessities of their position.\r\n\r\nAs this will be the last annual message which I shall have the honor of\r\ntransmitting to Congress before my successor is chosen, I will repeat or\r\nrecapitulate the questions which I deem of vital importance which may be\r\nlegislated upon and settled at this session:\r\n\r\nFirst. That the States shall be required to afford the opportunity of a\r\ngood common-school education to every child within their limits.\r\n\r\nSecond. No sectarian tenets shall ever be taught in any school supported\r\nin whole or in part by the State, nation, or by the proceeds of any tax\r\nlevied upon any community. Make education compulsory so far as to\r\ndeprive all persons who can not read and write from becoming voters\r\nafter the year 1890, disfranchising none, however, on grounds of\r\nilliteracy who may be voters at the time this amendment takes effect.\r\n\r\nThird. Declare church and state forever separate and distinct, but each\r\nfree within their proper spheres; and that all church property shall\r\nbear its own proportion of taxation.\r\n\r\nFourth. Drive out licensed immorality, such as polygamy and the\r\nimportation of women for illegitimate purposes. To recur again to the\r\ncentennial year, it would seem as though now, as we are about to begin\r\nthe second century of our national existence, would be a most fitting\r\ntime for these reforms.\r\n\r\nFifth. Enact such laws as will insure a speedy return to a sound\r\ncurrency, such as will command the respect of the world.\r\n\r\nBelieving that these views will commend themselves to the great\r\nmajority of the right-thinking and patriotic citizens of the United\r\nStates, I submit the rest to Congress.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: See pp. 324-325.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 6, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn reply to the resolution of the Senate of the 27th of February last,\r\nrequesting the President to institute inquiries as to the proper place\r\nfor the establishment of a branch mint at some point in the Western\r\nStates or in the Mississippi Valley, I transmit herewith the report, and\r\naccompanying papers, of the Director of the Mint, who was charged with\r\nthe duty of making the inquiries called for by said resolution.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 21, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives, in answer to their\r\nresolution of the 17th instant, a report from the Secretary of State,\r\nwith accompanying documents.[98]\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: Correspondence with Spain relative to Cuba.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 25, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 22d\r\nof January instant, I herewith transmit a report[99] from the Secretary\r\nof State.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: Stating that no correspondence had taken place during the\r\nyear 1875 with any European Government other than Spain relative to\r\nCuba.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 3, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 19th of January\r\ninstant, requesting the examination, with a view to ascertaining their\r\nsuitableness for the purposes of a mint, of the building and grounds\r\nsituated in Columbus, Ohio, known as the \"Capital University,\" and\r\nproposed to be donated to the United States by F.

A prolonged delay in furnishing provisions to these\r\nIndians will cause great distress and be likely to provoke raids on\r\nwhite settlements, and possibly lead to general outbreak and\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\nI therefore deem it proper to invite your attention to the importance of\r\nearly and favorable action upon the estimates heretofore and herewith\r\nsubmitted.\r\n\r\nThese estimates and the views of the Secretary in regard to this\r\nemergency meet with my full concurrence, and I recommend that the\r\nappropriations asked for be made at the earliest day practicable.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 3, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n21st ultimo, I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State,\r\nand accompanying papers,[101] together with a report from the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: Correspondence relative to the mode of transferring to the\r\nUnited States the Alabama indemnity of $15,500,000, and correspondence\r\nand papers showing the payment of the indemnity, the form of receipt\r\ngiven therefor, and the disposition of the indemnity.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 6, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 7th of January last,\r\nrequesting a \"statement of the number of military arrests made in the\r\nTerritory of Alaska during the past five years, together with the date\r\nof each, the charge on which made in each case, the names of the persons\r\narrested, and the period and character of the imprisonment of each in\r\nthat Territory before trial or surrender to the civil authorities for\r\ntrial,\" I have the honor to submit herewith the report of the Acting\r\nSecretary of War.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 10, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for consideration with a view to ratification,\r\na metric convention between the United States and certain foreign\r\ngovernments, signed at Paris on the 20th of May, 1875, by Mr. E.B.\r\nWashburne, the minister of the United States at that capital, acting on\r\nbehalf of this Government, and by the representatives acting on behalf\r\nof the foreign powers therein mentioned.\r\n\r\nA copy of certain papers on the subject, mentioned in the subjoined\r\nlist, is also transmitted for the information of the Senate.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 22, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to a resolution[102] of the House of Representatives of the 23d\r\nof February ultimo, I transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of State\r\nand the papers which accompany it.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: Calling for information or facts relative to the charges\r\nagainst George F.

Its\r\nmembers have evinced a disposition to become self-supporting, and it\r\nis believed that only temporary aid will be required by them. The sums\r\nadvanced by the United States for this purpose it is expected will be\r\nrefunded from the proceeds of the sale of the Pawnee Reservation in\r\nNebraska.\r\n\r\nThe present destitute condition of these Indians would seem to call\r\nfor immediate relief, and I recommend the subject to your early and\r\nfavorable consideration.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 6, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn further answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 7th of January\r\nlast (partial answers having been transmitted on the 6th and 24th\r\nultimo), calling for a statement of \"the number of military arrests in\r\nthe Territory of Alaska during the past five years,\" etc., I have the\r\nhonor to submit herewith a report, with accompanying papers, received\r\nfrom the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 19, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith to Congress the final report\r\nof the board of audit constituted by section 6 of the \"act for the\r\ngovernment of the District of Columbia, and for other purposes,\"\r\napproved June 20, 1874, and abolished by the joint resolution approved\r\nMarch 14, 1876, and to call your attention to the statements therein\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 1, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of Congress, a report of\r\nthe president of the Centennial Commission upon the ceremonies to be\r\nobserved at the opening of the exhibition on the 10th instant. It will\r\nbe observed that an invitation is therein extended to Senators and\r\nRepresentatives to be present on that occasion.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[The same message was sent to the House of Representatives.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 1, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration of the Senate with a view to\r\nits ratification by that body, a treaty between the United States and\r\nMexico, concluded on the 29th ultimo.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 1, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in answer to the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of 15th March last, a report[103] from the\r\nSecretary of State and accompanying papers.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: Explanatory of the object, intent, and character of the\r\npower conferred upon A. B. Steinberger, special agent to the Samoan or\r\nNavigators Islands, and transmitting correspondence relative to the\r\nobject, operation, and result of his agency.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 4, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have given very attentive consideration to a resolution of the House\r\nof Representatives passed on the 3d of April, requesting the President\r\nof the United States to inform the House whether any executive offices\r\nacts, or duties, and, if any, what, have within a specified period been\r\nperformed at a distance from the seat of Government established by law,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nI have never hesitated and shall not hesitate to communicate to\r\nCongress, and to either branch thereof, all the information which the\r\nConstitution makes it the duty of the President to give, or which my\r\njudgment may suggest to me or a request from either House may indicate\r\nto me will be useful in the discharge of the appropriate duties confided\r\nto them. I fail, however, to find in the Constitution of the United\r\nStates the authority given to the House of Representatives (one branch\r\nof the Congress, in which is vested the legislative power of the\r\nGovernment) to require of the Executive, an independent branch of the\r\nGovernment, coordinate with the Senate and House of Representatives,\r\nan account of his discharge of his appropriate and purely executive\r\noffices, acts, and duties, either as to when, where, or how performed.\r\n\r\nWhat the House of Representatives may require as a right in its demand\r\nupon the Executive for information is limited to what is necessary for\r\nthe proper discharge of its powers of legislation or of impeachment.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry in the resolution of the House as to where executive acts\r\nhave within the last seven years been performed and at what distance\r\nfrom any particular spot or for how long a period at any one time, etc.,\r\ndoes not necessarily belong to the province of legislation. It does not\r\nprofess to be asked for that object.\r\n\r\nIf this information be sought through an inquiry of the President as to\r\nhis executive acts in view or in aid of the power of impeachment vested\r\nin the House, it is asked in derogation of an inherent natural right,\r\nrecognized in this country by a constitutional guaranty which protects\r\nevery citizen, the President as well as the humblest in the land, from\r\nbeing made a witness against himself.\r\n\r\nDuring the time that I have had the honor to occupy the position of\r\nPresident of this Government it has been, and while I continue to occupy\r\nthat position it will continue to be, my earnest endeavor to recognize\r\nand to respect the several trusts and duties and powers of the\r\ncoordinate branches of the Government, not encroaching upon them nor\r\nallowing encroachments upon the proper powers of the office which the\r\npeople of the United States have confided to me, but aiming to preserve\r\nin their proper relations the several powers and functions of each of\r\nthe coordinate branches of the Government, agreeably to the Constitution\r\nand in accordance with the solemn oath which I have taken to \"preserve,\r\nprotect, and defend\" that instrument.\r\n\r\nIn maintenance of the rights secured by the Constitution to the\r\nexecutive branch of the Government I am compelled to decline any\r\nspecific or detailed answer to the request of the House for information\r\nas to \"any executive offices, acts, or duties, and, if any, what, have\r\nbeen performed at a distance from the seat of Government established by\r\nlaw, and for how long a period at any one time and in what part of the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nIf, however, the House of Representatives desires to know whether during\r\nthe period of upward of seven years during which I have held the office\r\nof President of the United States I have been absent from the seat of\r\nGovernment, and whether during that period I have performed or have\r\nneglected to perform the duties of my office, I freely inform the House\r\nthat from the time of my entrance upon my office I have been in the\r\nhabit, as were all of my predecessors (with the exception of one, who\r\nlived only one month after assuming the duties of his office, and one\r\nwhose continued presence in Washington was necessary from the existence\r\nat the time of a powerful rebellion), of absenting myself at times from\r\nthe seat of Government, and that during such absences I did not neglect\r\nor forego the obligations or the duties of my office, but continued to\r\ndischarge all of the executive offices, acts, and duties which were\r\nrequired of me as the President of the United States. I am not aware\r\nthat a failure occurred in any one instance of my exercising the\r\nfunctions and powers of my office in every case requiring their\r\ndischarge, or of my exercising all necessary executive acts, in whatever\r\npart of the United States I may at the time have been. Fortunately, the\r\nrapidity of travel and of mail communication and the facility of almost\r\ninstantaneous correspondence with the offices at the seat of Government,\r\nwhich the telegraph affords to the President in whatever section of the\r\nUnion he may be, enable him in these days to maintain as constant and\r\nalmost as quick intercourse with the Departments at Washington as may be\r\nmaintained while he remains at the capital.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of the performance of executive acts by the President of\r\nthe United States exists and is devolved upon him, wherever he may be\r\nwithin the United States, during his term of office by the Constitution\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nHis civil powers are no more limited or capable of limitation as to the\r\nplace where they shall be exercised than are those which he might be\r\nrequired to discharge in his capacity of Commander in Chief of the Army\r\nand Navy, which latter powers it is evident he might be called upon to\r\nexercise, possibly, even without the limits of the United States. Had\r\nthe efforts of those recently in rebellion against the Government been\r\nsuccessful in driving a late President of the United States from\r\nWashington, it is manifest that he must have discharged his functions,\r\nboth civil and military, elsewhere than in the place named by law as the\r\nseat of Government.\r\n\r\nNo act of Congress can limit, suspend, or confine this constitutional\r\nduty. I am not aware of the existence of any act of Congress which\r\nassumes thus to limit or restrict the exercise of the functions of the\r\nExecutive. Were there such acts, I should nevertheless recognize the\r\nsuperior authority of the Constitution, and should exercise the powers\r\nrequired thereby of the President.\r\n\r\nThe act to which reference is made in the resolution of the House\r\nrelates to the establishing of the seat of Government and the providing\r\nof suitable buildings and removal thereto of the offices attached to the\r\nGovernment, etc. It was not understood at its date and by General\r\nWashington to confine the President in the discharge of his duties and\r\npowers to actual presence at the seat of Government. On the 30th of\r\nMarch, 1791, shortly after the passage of the act referred to, General\r\nWashington issued an Executive proclamation having reference to the\r\nsubject of this very act from Georgetown, a place remote from\r\nPhiladelphia, which then was the seat of Government, where the act\r\nreferred to directed that \"all offices attached to the seat of\r\nGovernment\" should for the time remain.\r\n\r\nThat none of his successors have entertained the idea that their\r\nexecutive offices could be performed only at the seat of Government is\r\nevidenced by the hundreds upon hundreds of such acts performed by my\r\npredecessors in unbroken line from Washington to Lincoln, a memorandum\r\nof the general nature and character of some of which acts is submitted\r\nherewith; and no question has ever been raised as to the validity of\r\nthose acts or as to the right and propriety of the Executive to exercise\r\nthe powers of his office in any part of the United States.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum of absences of the Presidents of the United States from the\r\nnational capital during each of the several Administrations, and of\r\npublic and executive acts performed during the time of such absences_.\r\n\r\nPresident Washington was frequently absent from the capital; he appears\r\nto have been thus absent at least one hundred and eighty-one days during\r\nhis term.\r\n\r\nDuring his several absences he discharged official and executive duties;\r\namong them--\r\n\r\nIn March, 1791, he issued a proclamation, dated at Georgetown, in\r\nreference to running the boundary for the territory of the permanent\r\nseat of the Government.\r\n\r\nFrom Mount Vernon he signed an official letter to the Emperor of\r\nMorocco, and from the same place the commission of Oliver Wolcott as\r\nComptroller of the Treasury and the proclamation respecting the whisky\r\ninsurrection in Pennsylvania; also various sea letters, the proclamation\r\nof the treaty of 1795 between the United States and Spain, the Executive\r\norder of August 4, 1792, relative to the duties on distilled spirits,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nWhen at Germantown he signed the commission of John Breckenridge as\r\nattorney of the United States for Kentucky, and that of engineer of the\r\nUnited States Mint.\r\n\r\nHe proposed to have Mr. Yrujo officially presented, as envoy\r\nextraordinary and minister plenipotentiary from Spain, to him at Mount\r\nVernon; but although Mr. Yrujo went there for the purpose, the ceremony\r\nof presentation was prevented by Mr. Yrujo's having accidentally left\r\nhis credentials.\r\n\r\nPresident John Adams was absent from the capital during his term of\r\nfour years, on various occasions, three hundred and eighty-five days.\r\nHe discharged official duties and performed the most solemn public acts\r\nat Quincy in the same manner as when at the seat of Government. In 1797\r\n(August 25) he forwarded to the Secretary of State a number of passports\r\nwhich he had signed at Quincy. He issued at Quincy commissions to\r\nnumerous officers of various grades, civil and military. On the 28th of\r\nSeptember, 1797, he forwarded to the Secretary of State a commission for\r\na justice of the Supreme Court, signed in blank at Quincy, instructing\r\nthe Secretary to fill it with the name of John Marshall if he would\r\naccept, and, if not, Bushrod Washington. He issued a proclamation\r\nopening trade with certain ports of St. Domingo, and signed warrants\r\nfor the execution of two soldiers and for a pardon.\r\n\r\nPresident Jefferson was absent from the seat of Government during\r\nhis two terms of office seven hundred and ninety-six days, more than\r\none-fourth of the whole official period. During his absence he signed\r\nand issued from Monticello seventy-five commissions, one letter to the\r\nEmperor of Russia, and nine letters of credence to diplomatic agents of\r\nthe United States accredited to other governments.\r\n\r\nPresident Madison was absent from the seat of Government during his two\r\nPresidential terms six hundred and thirty-seven days. He signed and\r\nissued from Montpelier during his absence from the capital seventy-one\r\ncommissions, one proclamation, and nine letters of credence to\r\nministers, accrediting them to foreign governments, and, as it appears,\r\ntransacted generally all the necessary routine business incident to the\r\nExecutive office.\r\n\r\nPresident Monroe was absent from the capital during his Presidential\r\nservice of eight years seven hundred and eight days, independent of\r\nthe year 1824 and the two months of 1825, for which period no data\r\nare found. He transacted public business wherever he happened to be,\r\nsometimes at his farm in Virginia, again at his summer resort on the\r\nChesapeake, and sometimes while traveling. He signed and issued from\r\nthese several places, away from the capital, numerous commissions to\r\ncivil officers of the Government, exequaturs to foreign consuls, letters\r\nof credence, two letters to sovereigns, and thirty-seven pardons.\r\n\r\nPresident John Q. Adams was absent from the capital during his\r\nPresidential term of four years two hundred and twenty-two days. During\r\nsuch absence he performed official and public acts, signing and issuing\r\ncommissions, exequaturs, pardons, proclamations, etc. Referring to his\r\nabsence in August and September, 1827, Mr. Adams, in his memoirs, volume\r\n8, page 75, says: \"I left with him [the chief clerk] some blank\r\nsignatures, to be used when necessary for proclamations, remission of\r\npenalties, and commissions of consuls, taking of him a receipt for the\r\nnumber and kind of blanks left with him, with directions to return to me\r\nwhen I came back all the signed blanks remaining unused and to keep and\r\ngive me an account of all those that shall have been disposed of. This\r\nhas been my constant practice with respect to signed blanks of this\r\ndescription. I do the same with regard to patents and land grants.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Jackson was absent from the capital during his Presidential\r\nservice of eight years five hundred and two days. He also performed\r\nexecutive duties and public acts while absent. He appears to have signed\r\nand issued while absent from the capital very many public papers,\r\nembracing commissions, letters of credence, exequaturs, pardons, and\r\namong them four Executive proclamations. On the 26th of June, 1833, he\r\naddressed a letter from Boston to Mr. Duane, Secretary of the Treasury,\r\ngiving his views at large on the removal of the \"deposits\" from the\r\nUnited States Bank and placing them in the State banks, directing that\r\nthe change, with all its arrangements, should be, if possible, completed\r\nby the 15th September following, and recommending that Amos Kendall\r\nshould be appointed an agent of the Treasury Department to make the\r\nnecessary arrangements with the State banks. Soon after, September 23,\r\na paper signed by the President and purporting to have been read to the\r\nCabinet was published in the newspapers of the day. Early in the next\r\nsession of Congress a resolution passed the Senate inquiring of the\r\nPresident whether the paper was genuine or not and if it was published\r\nby his authority, and requesting that a copy be laid before that body.\r\nThe President replied, avowing the genuineness of the paper and that it\r\nwas published by his authority, but declined to furnish a copy to the\r\nSenate on the ground that it was purely executive business, and that the\r\nrequest of the Senate was an undue interference with the independence of\r\nthe Executive, a coordinate branch of the Government. In January, 1837\r\n(26th), he refused the privilege to a committee under a resolution of\r\nthe House of Representatives to make a general investigation of the\r\nExecutive Departments without specific charges, on the ground, among\r\nothers, that the use of the books, papers, etc., of the Departments for\r\nsuch purpose would interfere with the discharge of the public duties\r\ndevolving upon the heads of the different Departments, and necessarily\r\ndisarrange and retard the public business.\r\n\r\nPresident Van Buren was absent from the capital during his Presidential\r\nterm one hundred and thirty-one days. He discharged executive duties\r\nand performed official and public acts during these absences. Among the\r\npapers signed by President Van Buren during his absence from the seat of\r\nGovernment are commissions (one of these being for a United States judge\r\nof a district court), pardons, etc.\r\n\r\nPresident Tyler was absent from the capital during his Presidential term\r\none hundred and sixty-three days, and performed public acts and duties\r\nduring such absences, signing public papers and documents to the number\r\nof twenty-eight, in which were included commissions, exequaturs, letters\r\nof credence, pardons, and one proclamation making public the treaty of\r\n1842 between the United States and Ecuador.\r\n\r\nPresident Polk was absent from the capital during his Presidential term\r\nthirty-seven days, and appears to have signed but two official public\r\npapers during such absence.\r\n\r\nPresident Taylor was absent from the capital during the time he served\r\nas President thirty-one days, and while absent signed two commissions,\r\nthree \"full powers,\" two exequaturs, and the proclamation of August 11,\r\n1849, relative to a threatened invasion of Cuba or some of the Provinces\r\nof Mexico.\r\n\r\nPresident Fillmore was absent from the capital during the time he served\r\nas President sixty days. During such absence he signed pardons,\r\ncommissions, exequaturs, etc.\r\n\r\nPresident Pierce was absent from the capital in all during his\r\nPresidential term fifty-seven days. The several periods of absence which\r\nmake up this aggregate were each brief, and it does not appear that\r\nduring these absences the President signed any public official\r\ndocuments, except one pardon.\r\n\r\nPresident Buchanan was absent from the capital during his Presidential\r\nterm fifty-seven days, and the official papers which he is shown to have\r\nsigned during such absence are three exequaturs and one letter of\r\ncredence.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the public documents and papers executed by the several\r\nPresidents during their absences from the seat of Government, constant\r\nofficial correspondence was maintained by each with the heads of the\r\ndifferent Executive Departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 15, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 10th\r\nultimo, I transmit herewith a report and accompanying papers upon the\r\nsubject[104] from the

1875.\r\n\r\nThis board is to determine by actual tests the strength and value of all\r\nmetals, and to prepare tables which will exhibit their strength and\r\nvalue for all constructions.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying memorials and resolutions of scientific associations,\r\ncolleges, and schools strongly advocate the continuation of this board,\r\nwhich is national in its character and general in its investigations.\r\n\r\nThe board asks for an appropriation of $50,000 for the ensuing year, and\r\nthat any unexpended balances remaining on hand on the 30th of June,\r\n1876, may be reappropriated.\r\n\r\nThis recommendation is submitted for favorable action, in the belief\r\nthat the labors of the board will, in the benefits accruing to important\r\nindustrial interests, more than repay to the country at large any money\r\nthat may be so expended.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 10, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in answer to the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 30th day of March last, a report from the\r\nSecretary of State, with accompanying papers, which presents the\r\ncorrespondence and condition of the question[107] up to the day of\r\nits date.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: The refusal of Great Britain to surrender certain fugitive\r\ncriminals

Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe near approach of a new fiscal year and the failure of Congress\r\nup to this time to provide the necessary means to continue all the\r\nfunctions of Government make it my duty to call your attention to the\r\nembarrassments that must ensue if the fiscal year is allowed to close\r\nwithout remedial action on your part.\r\n\r\nArticle I, section 9, of the Constitution declares:\r\n\r\n  No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of\r\n  appropriations made by law.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo insure economy of expenditure and security of the public treasure\r\nCongress has from time to time enacted laws to restrain the use of\r\npublic moneys, except for the specific purpose for which appropriated\r\nand within the time for which appropriated; and to prevent contracting\r\ndebts in anticipation of appropriate appropriations, Revised Statutes,\r\nsection 3679, provides:\r\n\r\n  No Department of the Government shall expend in any one fiscal year any\r\n  sum in excess of appropriations made by Congress for that fiscal year,\r\n  or involve the Government in any contract for the future payment of\r\n  money in excess of such appropriations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3732 provides:\r\n\r\n  No contract or purchase on behalf of the United States shall be made\r\n  unless the same is authorized by law or is under an appropriation\r\n  adequate to its fulfillment, except in the War and Navy Departments,\r\n  for clothing, subsistence, forage, fuel, quarters, or transportation,\r\n  which, however, shall not exceed the necessities of the current year.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3678, as follows:\r\n\r\n  All sums appropriated for the various branches of expenditure in the\r\n  public service shall be applied solely to the objects for which they\r\n  are respectively made, and for no others.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3690, that--\r\n\r\n  All balances of appropriations contained in the annual appropriation\r\n  bills, and made specifically for the service of any fiscal year, and\r\n  remaining unexpended at the expiration of such fiscal year, shall only\r\n  be applied to the payment of expenses properly incurred during that year\r\n  or to the fulfillment of contracts properly made within that year; and\r\n  balances not needed for such purposes shall be carried to the surplus\r\n  fund. This section, however, shall not apply to appropriations known as\r\n  permanent or indefinite appropriations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of the laws quoted, taken in connection with the\r\nconstitutional provision referred to, is, as above stated, to prohibit\r\nany outlay of public money toward defraying even the current and\r\nnecessary expenses of Government after the expiration of the year for\r\nwhich appropriated, excepting when those expenses are provided for by\r\nsome permanent appropriation, and excepting in the War and Navy\r\nDepartments, under section 3732.\r\n\r\nThe number of permanent appropriations are very limited, and cover but\r\nfew of the necessary expenditures of the Government. They are nearly\r\nall, if not quite all, embraced in sections 3687, 3688, and 3689 of\r\nthe Revised Statutes. That contained in section 3687 is applicable to\r\n_expenses of collecting the revenue from customs_, that in section 3688\r\nto the payment of interest on the _public debt_, and that in section\r\n3689 to various objects too numerous to detail here.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that while section 3679, quoted above, provides\r\nthat _no_ Department shall in any one fiscal year involve the Government\r\nin any contract for the future payment of money in excess of the\r\nappropriation for that year, section 3732, also quoted above, confers,\r\nby clear implication, upon the heads of the War and Navy Departments\r\nfull authority, even in the absence of any appropriation, to purchase\r\nor contract for clothing, subsistence, forage, fuel, quarters, or\r\ntransportation not exceeding the necessities of the current year. The\r\nlatter provision is special and exceptional in its character, and is to\r\nbe regarded as excluded from the operation of the former more general\r\none. But if any of the appropriation bills above enumerated should fail\r\nto be matured before the expiration of the current fiscal year, the\r\nGovernment would be greatly embarrassed for want of the necessary\r\nfunds to carry on the service. Precluded from expending money not\r\nappropriated, the Departments would have to suspend the service so\r\nfar as the appropriations for it should have failed to be made.\r\n\r\nA careful examination of this subject will demonstrate the embarrassed\r\ncondition all branches of the Government will be in, and especially the\r\nexecutive, if there should be a failure to pass the necessary\r\nappropriation bills before the 1st of July, or otherwise provide.\r\n\r\nI commend this subject most earnestly to your consideration, and urge\r\nthat some measure be speedily adopted to avert the evils which would\r\nresult from nonaction by Congress. I will venture the suggestion, by\r\nway of remedy, that a joint resolution, properly guarded, might be\r\npassed through the two Houses of Congress, extending the provisions\r\nof all appropriations for the present fiscal year to the next in\r\nall cases where there is a failure on the 1st of July to supply such\r\nappropriation; each appropriation so extended to hold good until\r\nCongress shall have passed a corresponding appropriation applicable to\r\nthe new fiscal year, when all moneys expended under laws enacted for\r\nthis fiscal year shall be deducted from the corresponding appropriation\r\nfor the next.\r\n\r\nTo make my ideas on this subject more clear, I have caused to be drawn\r\nup a joint resolution embodying them more fully.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  JOINT RESOLUTION to provide for defraying temporarily the ordinary and\r\n  necessary expenses of the public service.\r\n\r\n  Whereas the ordinary and necessary expenses of the public service in its\r\n  various branches, comprising among others the expenses which especially\r\n  pertain to the legislative, executive, and judicial departments of the\r\n  Government, to the consular and diplomatic service, to the postal\r\n  service, to the support of the Army, and to the maintenance of the Navy,\r\n  are generally met by annual appropriations which expire at the end of\r\n  the current fiscal year; and\r\n\r\n  Whereas no public funds will be available to defray these expenses as\r\n  the same shall accrue after that period unless appropriations shall have\r\n  been previously made therefor by law; and\r\n\r\n  Whereas, to avoid the great embarrassment to the public service that\r\n  might otherwise ensue, it is expedient to make provision for defraying\r\n  temporarily such of these expenses as would be unprovided for in case\r\n  some one of the usual annual appropriation bills designed to provide\r\n  therefor should fail to be matured by the end of the fiscal year now\r\n  current: Therefore,\r\n\r\n  _Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\n  States of America in Congress assembled_, That in case any of the\r\n  following appropriation bills for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1877,\r\n  shall not have passed by the commencement of such year, so that the\r\n  funds to be appropriated thereby may then be available for\r\n  expenditure--that is to say, the bill providing for the legislative,\r\n  executive, and judicial expenses; the bill providing for the consular\r\n  and diplomatic expenses; the bill providing for the service of the\r\n  Post-Office Department; the bill providing for the support of the Army,\r\n  and the bill providing for the naval service--the appropriation act for\r\n  the current fiscal year corresponding in its general description and\r\n  object to such appropriation bill shall extend to the fiscal year next\r\n  ensuing until such appropriation bill is enacted and takes effect, to\r\n  the end that the provisions of such appropriation act which apply to the\r\n  ordinary and necessary expenses of the public service for the current\r\n  fiscal year shall in like manner be applicable to similar expenses which\r\n  may accrue during the period intervening between the end of the current\r\n  fiscal year and the time when such appropriation bill for the next\r\n  ensuing fiscal year shall be enacted and take effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 20, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nBy the tenth article of the treaty between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain signed in Washington on the 9th day of August, 1842, it\r\nwas agreed that the two Governments should, upon mutual requisitions\r\nrespectively made, deliver up to justice all persons who, being\r\ncharged with certain crimes therein enumerated, committed within the\r\njurisdiction of either, should seek an asylum or be found within the\r\nterritories of the other.\r\n\r\nThe only condition or limitation contained in the treaty to the\r\nreciprocal obligation thus to deliver up the fugitive was that it should\r\nbe done only upon such evidence of criminality as, according to the laws\r\nof the place where the fugitive or person so charged should be found,\r\nwould justify his apprehension and commitment for trial if the crime or\r\noffense had there been committed.\r\n\r\nIn the month of February last a requisition was duly made, in\r\npursuance of the provisions of the treaty, by this Government upon that\r\nof Great Britain for the surrender of one Ezra D. Winslow, charged with\r\nextensive forgeries and the utterance of forged paper, committed within\r\nthe jurisdiction of the United States, who had sought an asylum\r\nand was found within the territories of Her Britannic Majesty and was\r\napprehended in London. The evidence of the criminality of the fugitive\r\nwas duly furnished and heard, and, being found sufficient to justify his\r\napprehension and commitment for trial if the crimes had been committed\r\nin Great Britain, he was held and committed for extradition.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government, however, did not deliver up the fugitive\r\nin accordance with the terms of the treaty, notwithstanding every\r\nrequirement thereof had been met on the part of the United States, but,\r\ninstead of surrendering the fugitive, demanded certain assurances or\r\nstipulations not mentioned in the treaty, but foreign to its provisions,\r\nas a condition of the performance by Great Britain of her obligations\r\nunder the treaty.\r\n\r\nIn a recent communication to the House of Representatives, and in answer\r\nto a call from that body for information on this case, I submitted the\r\ncorrespondence which has passed between the two Governments with\r\nreference thereto. It will be found in Executive Document No. 173 of the\r\nHouse of Representatives of the present session, and I respectfully\r\nrefer thereto for more detailed information bearing on the question.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the correspondence that the British Government bases its\r\nrefusal to surrender the fugitive and its demand for stipulations or\r\nassurances from this Government on the requirements of a purely domestic\r\nenactment of the British Parliament, passed in the year 1870.\r\n\r\nThis act was brought to the notice of this Government shortly after\r\nits enactment, and Her Majesty's Government was advised that the\r\nUnited States understood it as giving continued effect to the existing\r\nengagements under the treaty of 1842 for the extradition of criminals;\r\nand with this knowledge on its part, and without dissent from the\r\ndeclared views of the United States as to the unchanged nature of the\r\nreciprocal rights and obligations of the two powers under the treaty,\r\nGreat Britain has continued to make requisitions and to grant surrenders\r\nin numerous instances, without suggestion that it was contemplated to\r\ndepart from the practice under the treaty which has obtained for more\r\nthan thirty years, until now, for the first time, in this case of\r\nWinslow, it is assumed that under this act of Parliament Her Majesty may\r\nrequire a stipulation or agreement not provided for in the treaty as a\r\ncondition to the observance by her Government of its treaty obligations\r\ntoward this country.\r\n\r\nThis I have felt it my duty emphatically to repel.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the case of Winslow, requisition was also made by this\r\nGovernment on that of Great Britain for the surrender of Charles J.\r\nBrent, also charged with forgery, committed in the United States, and\r\nfound in Great Britain. The evidence of criminality was duly heard and\r\nthe fugitive committed for extradition.\r\n\r\nA similar stipulation to that demanded in Winslow's case was also asked\r\nin Brent's, and was likewise refused.\r\n\r\nIt is with extreme regret that I am now called upon to announce to\r\nyou that Her Majesty's Government has finally released both of these\r\nfugitives, Winslow and Brent, and set them at liberty, thus omitting to\r\ncomply with the provisions and requirements of the treaty under which\r\nthe extradition of fugitive criminals is made between the two\r\nGovernments.\r\n\r\nThe position thus taken by the British Government, if adhered to, can\r\nnot but be regarded as the abrogation and annulment of the article of\r\nthe treaty on extradition.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it will not, in my judgment, comport with the\r\ndignity or self-respect of this Government to make demands upon that\r\nGovernment for the surrender of fugitive criminals, nor to entertain any\r\nrequisition of that character from that Government under the treaty.\r\n\r\nIt will be a cause of deep regret if a treaty which has been thus far\r\nbeneficial in its practical operation, which has worked so well and\r\nso efficiently, and which, notwithstanding the exciting and at times\r\nviolent political disturbances of which both countries have been the\r\nscene during its existence, has given rise to no complaints on the part\r\nof either Government against either its spirit or its provisions, should\r\nbe abruptly terminated.\r\n\r\nIt has tended to the protection of society and to the general interests\r\nof both countries. Its violation or annulment would be a retrograde step\r\nin international intercourse.\r\n\r\nI have been anxious and have made the effort to enlarge its scope and\r\nto make a new treaty which would be a still more efficient agent for\r\nthe punishment and prevention of crime. At the same time, I have felt\r\nit my duty to decline to entertain a proposition made by Great Britain,\r\npending its refusal to execute the existing treaty, to amend it by\r\npractically conceding by treaty the identical conditions which that\r\nGovernment demands under its act of Parliament. In addition to the\r\nimpossibility of the United States entering upon negotiations under\r\nthe menace of an intended violation or a refusal to execute the terms\r\nof an existing treaty I deemed it inadvisable to treat of only the one\r\namendment proposed by Great Britain while the United States desires an\r\nenlargement of the list of crimes for which extradition may be asked,\r\nand other improvements which experience has shown might be embodied in\r\na new treaty.\r\n\r\nIt is for the wisdom of Congress to determine whether the article\r\nof the treaty relating to extradition is to be any longer regarded as\r\nobligatory on the Government of the United States or as forming part\r\nof the supreme law of the land. Should the attitude of the British\r\nGovernment remain unchanged, I shall not, without an expression of the\r\nwish of Congress that I should do so, take any action either in making\r\nor granting requisitions for the surrender of fugitive criminals under\r\nthe treaty of 1842.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 8, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith a report[109] from General W.T.\r\nSherman [J.D. Cameron, Secretary of War], together with the most\r\nrecent reports received from Brigadier-General A.H. Terry, as a response\r\nto the resolution of the Senate of the 7th instant, a copy of which is\r\nattached to this message.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: Relating to hostile demonstrations of the Sioux Indians\r\nand the disaster to the forces under General Custer.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 13, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in answer to a resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 1st ultimo, a report[110] from the Secretary of\r\nState upon the subject.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: Stating that no correspondence has taken place with Great\r\nBritain relative to the sequestration of the lands and property in New\r\nZealand claimed by William Webster, an American citizen.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 19, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State, in answer to the\r\nresolution of the House of Representatives of the 1st of April last, on\r\nthe subject of commercial intercourse with Mexico and Central America.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 31, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the\r\nGovernment for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1877, is so defective\r\nin what it omits to provide for that I can not announce its approval\r\nwithout at the same time pointing out what seems to me to be its\r\ndefects. It makes but inadequate provision for the service at best,\r\nand in some instances fails to make any provision whatever.\r\n\r\nNotably among the first class is the reduction in the ordinary annual\r\nappropriations for the Revenue-Cutter Service, to the prejudice of the\r\ncustoms revenue.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of the Signal Service, as also the failure to\r\nprovide for the increased expense devolved upon the mints and assay\r\noffices by recent legislation, and thus tending to defeat the objects of\r\nthat legislation.\r\n\r\nOf this class also are public buildings, for the protection,\r\npreservation, and completion of which there is no adequate\r\nappropriation, while the sum of $100,000 only is appropriated for the\r\nrepairs of the different navy yards and stations and the preservation of\r\nthe same, the ordinary and customary appropriations for which are not\r\nless than $1,000,000.\r\n\r\nA similar reduction is made in the expenses for armories and arsenals.\r\n\r\nThe provision for the ordinary judicial expenses is much less than the\r\nestimated amount for that important service, the actual expenditures of\r\nthe last fiscal year, and the certain demands of the current year.\r\n\r\nThe provision for the expenses of the surveys of public lands is less\r\nthan one-half of the usual appropriation for that service and what are\r\nunderstood to be its actual demands.\r\n\r\nReduction in the expenditures for light-houses, beacons, and fog\r\nstations is also made in similar proportion.\r\n\r\nOf the class for which no appropriation is made, among the most\r\nnoticeable, perhaps, is that portion of the general expenses of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia on behalf of the United States, as appropriated in\r\nformer years, and the judgments of the Court of Claims. The failure to\r\nmake a reasonable contribution to the expenses of the nation's capital\r\nis an apparent dereliction on the part of the United States and rank\r\ninjustice to the people here who bear the burdens, while to refuse or\r\nneglect to provide for the payment of solemn judgments of its own courts\r\nis apparently to repudiate. Of a different character, but as prejudicial\r\nto the Treasury, is the omission to make provision to enable the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury to have the rebel archives and records of\r\ncaptured and abandoned property examined and information furnished\r\ntherefrom for the use of the Government.\r\n\r\nFinally, without further specification of detail, it may be said that\r\nthe act which in its title purports to make provision for a diverse and\r\ngreatly extended civil service unhappily appropriates an amount not more\r\nthan 65 per cent of its ordinary demands.\r\n\r\nThe legislative department establishes and defines the service, and\r\ndevolves upon the Executive Departments the obligation of submitting\r\nannually the needful estimates of expenses of such service. Congress\r\nproperly exacts implicit obedience to the requirements of the law\r\nin the administration of the public service and rigid accountability\r\nin the expenditures therefor. It is submitted that a corresponding\r\nresponsibility and obligation rest upon it to make the adequate\r\nappropriations to render possible such administration and tolerable such\r\nexaction. Anything short of an ample provision for a specified service\r\nis necessarily fraught with disaster to the public interests and is a\r\npositive injustice to those charged with its execution.\r\n\r\nTo appropriate and to execute are corresponding obligations and duties,\r\nand the adequacy of the former is the necessary measure of the\r\nefficiency of the execution.\r\n\r\nIn this eighth month of the present session of Congress--nearly one\r\nmonth of the fiscal year to which this appropriation applies having\r\npassed--I do not feel warranted in vetoing an absolutely necessary\r\nappropriation bill; but in signing it I deem it a duty to show where\r\nthe responsibility belongs for whatever embarrassments may arise in\r\nthe execution of the trust confided to me.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _July 31, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn response to the resolution of the Senate of July 20, 1876, calling\r\nupon the President to communicate to the Senate, if in his opinion not\r\nincompatible with the public interest, any information in regard to the\r\nslaughter of American citizens at Hamburg, S.C., I have the honor to\r\nsubmit the following inclosures, to wit:\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Letter of the 22d of July, 1876, from Governor D.H. Chamberlain,\r\nof South Carolina, to me.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. My reply thereto.\r\n\r\nNo. 3. Report of Hon. William Stone, attorney-general of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nNo. 4. Report of General H.W. Purvis, adjutant and inspector general of\r\nSouth Carolina.\r\n\r\nNo. 5. Copy of evidence taken before a coroner's jury investigating\r\nfacts relating to the Hamburg massacre.\r\n\r\nNo. 6. Printed copy of statement by M.C. Butler, of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nNo. 7. Printed letter from the same to the editors of the Journal of\r\nCommerce.\r\n\r\nNo. 8. Copy of letter from Governor Chamberlain to the Hon. T.J.\r\nRobertson.\r\n\r\nNo. 9. An address to the American people by the colored citizens of\r\nCharleston, S.C.\r\n\r\nNo. 10. An address by a committee appointed at a convention of leading\r\nrepresentatives of Columbia, S.C.\r\n\r\nNo. 11. Copy of letter of July 15, 1876, from the district attorney of\r\nMississippi to the Attorney-General of the United States.\r\n\r\nNo. 12. Letter from same to same.\r\n\r\nNo. 13. Copy of report of a grand jury lately in session in Oxford,\r\nMiss.\r\n\r\nThese inclosures embrace all the information in my possession touching\r\nthe late disgraceful and brutal slaughter of unoffending men at the town\r\nof Hamburg, S.C. My letter to Governor Chamberlain contains all the\r\ncomments I wish to make on the subject. As allusion is made in that\r\nletter to the condition of other States, and particularly to Louisiana\r\nand Mississippi, I have added to the inclosures letters and testimony in\r\nregard to the lawless condition of a portion of the people of the latter\r\nState.\r\n\r\nIn regard to Louisiana affairs, murders and massacres of innocent men\r\nfor opinion's sake or on account of color have been of too recent date\r\nand of too frequent occurrence to require recapitulation or testimony\r\nhere. All are familiar with their horrible details, the only wonder\r\nbeing that so many justify them or apologize for them.\r\n\r\nBut recently a committee of the Senate of the United States visited the\r\nState of Mississippi to take testimony on the subject of frauds and\r\nviolence in elections. Their report has not yet been made public, but I\r\nawait its forthcoming with a feeling of confidence that it will fully\r\nsustain all that I have stated relating to fraud and violence in the\r\nState of Mississippi.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 11, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a telegram of the 5th of August instant from\r\nLieutenant-General Sheridan to General Sherman, a letter of the 11th of\r\nthe present month from General Sherman to the Secretary of War, and a\r\nletter from the latter of the same date to me, all setting forth the\r\npossible needs of the Army in consequence of existing hostilities.\r\n\r\nI would strongly urge upon Congress the necessity for making some\r\nprovision for a contingency which may arise during the vacation--for\r\nmore troops in the Indian country than it is now possible to send.\r\n\r\nIt would seem to me to be much more economical and better to authorize\r\nan increase of the present cavalry force by 2,500 privates, but if this\r\nis not deemed advisable, then that the President be authorized to call\r\nout not exceeding five regiments, 1,000 strong each, of volunteers, to\r\nserve for a period not exceeding six months.\r\n\r\nShould this latter authority be given, I would not order out any\r\nvolunteers unless in my opinion, based upon reports from the scene of\r\nwar, I deemed it absolutely necessary, and then only the smallest number\r\nconsidered sufficient to meet the emergency.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 14, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn affixing my signature to the river and harbor bill, No. 3822,\r\nI deem it my duty to announce to the House of Representatives my\r\nobjections to some features of the bill, and the reason I sign it.\r\nIf it was obligatory upon the Executive to expend all the money\r\nappropriated by Congress, I should return the river and harbor bill\r\nwith my objections, notwithstanding the great inconvenience to the\r\npublic interests resulting therefrom and the loss of expenditures from\r\nprevious Congresses upon incompleted works. Without enumerating, many\r\nappropriations are made for works of purely private or local interest,\r\nin no sense national. I can not give my sanction to these, and will take\r\ncare that during my term of office no public money shall be expended\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nThere is very great necessity for economy of expenditures at this\r\ntime, growing out of the loss of revenue likely to arise from a\r\ndeficiency of appropriations to insure a thorough collection of the\r\nsame. The reduction of revenue districts, diminution of special agents,\r\nand total abolition of supervisors may result in great falling off of\r\nthe revenue. It may be a question to consider whether any expenditure\r\ncan be authorized under the river and harbor appropriation further than\r\nto protect works already done and paid for. Under no circumstances will\r\nI allow expenditures upon works not clearly national.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 14, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn announcing, as I do, that I have attached my signature of official\r\napproval to the \"Act making appropriations for the consular and\r\ndiplomatic service of the Government for the year ending June 30, 1877,\r\nand for other purposes,\" it is my duty to call attention to a provision\r\nin the act directing that notice be sent to certain of the diplomatic\r\nand consular officers of the Government \"to close their offices.\"\r\n\r\nIn the literal sense of this direction it would be an invasion of the\r\nconstitutional prerogatives and duty of the Executive.\r\n\r\nBy the Constitution the President \"shall have power, by and with the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds\r\nof the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and, by and with\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint, ambassadors, other\r\npublic ministers, and consuls,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIt is within the power of Congress to grant or withhold appropriation\r\nof money for the payment of salaries and expenses of the foreign\r\nrepresentatives of the Government.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Government a sum in gross was appropriated,\r\nleaving it to the Executive to determine the grade of the officers and\r\nthe countries to which they should be sent.\r\n\r\nLatterly, for very many years, specific sums have been appropriated\r\nfor designated missions or employments, and as a rule the omission by\r\nCongress to make an appropriation for any specific port has heretofore\r\nbeen accepted as an indication of a wish on the part of Congress which\r\nthe executive branch of the Government respected and complied with.\r\n\r\nIn calling attention to the passage which I have indicated I assume that\r\nthe intention of the provision is only to exercise the constitutional\r\nprerogative of Congress over the expenditures of the Government and to\r\nfix a time at which the compensation of certain diplomatic and consular\r\nofficers shall cease, and not to invade the constitutional rights of the\r\nExecutive, which I should be compelled to resist; and my present object\r\nis not to discuss or dispute the wisdom of failing to appropriate for\r\nseveral offices, but to guard against the construction that might\r\npossibly be placed on the language used, as implying a right in the\r\nlegislative branch to direct the closing or discontinuing of any of the\r\ndiplomatic or consular offices of the Government.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[For message of August 15, 1876, withdrawing objections to Senate bill\r\nNo. 779, see p. 388.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 15, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, in answer to its resolution of the 24th\r\nultimo, a report from the Secretary of State, with its accompanying\r\nstatement.[111]\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: Aggregate number of civil officers in or connected with\r\nthe Department of State from 1859 to 1875, inclusive.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 3, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to return herewith without my approval House bill No.\r\n1561, entitled \"An act transferring the custody of certain Indian trust\r\nfunds from the Secretary of the Interior to the Treasurer of the United\r\nStates,\" for the reasons set forth in the accompanying communication\r\nfrom the Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, _Washington, February 7, 1876_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nSIR: I acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 29th ultimo,\r\ntransmitting House bill No. 1561 and requesting this Department to\r\nreport whether any objections to its becoming a law are known to exist.\r\n\r\nIn reply I have the honor to state that I am fearful that the act is not\r\nsufficiently definite in terms to accomplish the end desired, namely,\r\nthe mere transfer of the custody of said trust funds, enabling this\r\nDepartment to receive the interest from the custodian and apply it as\r\nheretofore without the intervention of Congress. The nature of the\r\nguardianship and control over the Indians exercised by me as Secretary\r\nand trustee is such as to require this Department to keep an account of\r\nthe funds to their credit or held in trust for them, and to receive the\r\ninterest on their trust funds promptly when due. I am fearful that this\r\nbill may not allow me to do so, and to guard against any danger of\r\nembarrassment in the transaction of this business I inclose a draft of\r\na bill[112] which, if substituted for the one already passed, will, it is\r\nbelieved, obviate the difficulties which may arise if the present bill\r\nshould become a law.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nZ.

Hile, private\r\nCompany F, Twenty-first Missouri Volunteers, enlisted July 15, 1861;\r\ndeserted June 14, 1862; returned August 2, 1862; was restored to duty\r\nby special order No. 38, headquarters District of Columbus, Department\r\nof Tennessee, dated Columbus, Ky., February 26, 1863. He reenlisted\r\nFebruary 28, 1864, as a veteran volunteer; was tried by general\r\ncourt-martial for absence without leave from November 25, 1864, to\r\nDecember 13, 1864, and sentenced to forfeit all pay and allowances for\r\ntime absent by general order No. 48, headquarters Second Division,\r\nSixteenth Army Corps, dated May 22, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"On the muster-out roll of company dated April 19, 1866, he is reported,\r\n'Deserted March 1, 1866, at Bladen Springs, Ala.'\r\n\r\n\"This man, in his application to this office for discharge, stated under\r\noath (affidavit dated July 27, 1870) that he left his command without\r\nleave and returned to his home February 28, 1866, having previously\r\napplied for a furlough, which was refused.\r\n\r\n\"This man, according to his own statement under oath, did desert as\r\nreported, and if this bill becomes a law it will be an injustice to\r\nevery soldier who served honorably with his command until his services\r\nwere no longer required by the Government, in addition to falsifying\r\nthe record, as the bill directs the record shall be made to show he\r\nis _no deserter_.\r\n\r\n\"This is only one of many similar cases.\"\r\n\r\nThe remarks of the Adjutant-General adverse to the passage of the bill\r\nare concurred in.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nALPHONSO TAFT, _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 31, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nFor the reasons set forth in the accompanying communication from the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, I have the honor to return herewith without\r\nmy approval Senate bill No. 489, entitled \"An act for the relief of\r\nG.B.

Tyler and B.H.\r\nLuckett, assignees of William T. Cheatham,\" and requesting my opinion as\r\nto the propriety of its approval by you, I have to say that there are no\r\ndata on file in the Department, so far as I can learn, which indicate\r\nthat the amount it is proposed by this bill to refund to the assignees\r\nof Mr. Cheatham was wrongfully collected or that the amount should be\r\nrefunded.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of Internal Revenue, in his report to me in reference\r\nto the matter, says:\r\n\r\n\"The reimbursement to the United States by said Cheatham of the salary\r\npaid to this storekeeper by the collector of internal revenue for the\r\nmonths of December, 1869, and January, 1870, was in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of joint resolution of March 29, 1869 (16 U.S. Statutes at\r\nLarge, p. 52), and there appears to be no reason for the refunding by\r\nthe United States to the assignees of said Cheatham the salary of this\r\nstorekeeper that would not apply with equal force to similar payments by\r\nall other distillers who were operating their distilleries or had\r\nspirits in their warehouses at that time.\"\r\n\r\nThe facts above stated are considered by this office valid and serious\r\nobjections to the approval of this bill, and they would have been\r\ncommunicated to the Congressional committee before the passage of the\r\nbill had they called the attention of this office to the subject.\r\n\r\nThe bill is herewith returned.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nB.H. BRISTOW, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 18, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHerewith I return Senate bill No. 172, entitled \"An act fixing the\r\nsalary of the President of the United States,\" without my approval.\r\n\r\nI am constrained to this course from a sense of duty to my successors in\r\noffice, to myself, and to what is due to the dignity of the position of\r\nChief Magistrate of a nation of more than 40,000,000 people.\r\n\r\nWhen the salary of the President of the United States, pursuant to the\r\nConstitution, was fixed at $25,000 per annum, we were a nation of but\r\n3,000,000 people, poor from a long and exhaustive war, without commerce\r\nor manufactures, with but few wants and those cheaply supplied. The\r\nsalary must then have been deemed small for the responsibilities and\r\ndignity of the position, but justifiably so from the impoverished\r\ncondition of the Treasury and the simplicity it was desired to cultivate\r\nin the Republic.\r\n\r\nThe salary of Congressmen under the Constitution was first fixed at\r\n$6 per day for the time actually in session--an average of about one\r\nhundred and twenty days to each session--or $720 per year, or less than\r\none-thirtieth of the salary of the President.\r\n\r\nCongress have legislated upon their own salaries from time to time\r\nsince, until finally it reached $5,000 per annum, or one-fifth that of\r\nthe President, before the salary of the latter was increased.\r\n\r\nNo one having a knowledge of the cost of living at the national capital\r\nwill contend that the present salary of Congressmen is too high, unless\r\nit is the intention to make the office one entirely of honor, when the\r\nsalary should be abolished--a proposition repugnant to our republican\r\nideas and institutions.\r\n\r\nI do not believe the citizens of this Republic desire their public\r\nservants to serve them without a fair compensation for their services.\r\nTwenty-five thousand dollars does not defray the expenses of the\r\nExecutive for one year, or has not in my experience. It is not now\r\none-fifth in value of what it was at the time of the adoption of the\r\nConstitution in supplying demands and wants.\r\n\r\nHaving no personal interest in this matter, I have felt myself free to\r\nreturn this bill to the House in which it originated with my objections,\r\nbelieving that in doing so I meet the wishes and judgment of the great\r\nmajority of those who indirectly pay all the salaries and other expenses\r\nof Government.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 26, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without my approval House bill No. 1922, entitled\r\n\"An act providing for the recording of deeds, mortgages, and other\r\nconveyances affecting real estate in the District of Columbia.\"\r\n\r\nThe objection to affixing my signature to this bill may be found in\r\nthe communication addressed to me by the Attorney-General, and which\r\naccompanies this message.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, _Washington, May 23, 1876_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nSIR: In reply to your note of the 19th instant, in which you request\r\nme to report whether there are objections to your approval of \"An act\r\nproviding for the recording of deeds, mortgages, and other conveyances\r\naffecting real estate in the District of Columbia,\" being House bill No.\r\n1922, I have the honor to state that the bill seems to me objectionable\r\nbecause of indefiniteness and uncertainty as to the time which it\r\npurports to fix when deeds of trust, mortgages, etc., shall take effect\r\nand be valid as to creditors and subsequent purchasers for valuable\r\nconsideration without notice. Although there is no constitutional\r\nobjection to the act, yet for the reason above stated I hesitate to\r\nadvise its approval.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nEDWARDS PIERREPONT, _Attorney-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _June 9, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith without my approval Senate bill No. 165, entitled\r\n\"An act for the relief of Michael W.

These commissioners are not appointed at the instance of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIn this way the awards for damages have already been made to the amount\r\nof $70,000, and ultimately a much larger sum will be claimed to be due\r\nfrom the United States.\r\n\r\nThe officer of engineers in charge of the improvement of the Fox and\r\nWisconsin rivers reports that the dams which have occasioned the flowage\r\nwere not constructed by the canal companies, and are not at all\r\nnecessary for the purposes of navigation, and so far as that is\r\nconcerned could not only be lowered, but entirely dispensed with.\r\n\r\nThey were built by private parties solely for their own use and profit\r\nand for water-power purposes, and have raised the water level and\r\ncaused the flowage, for which they should be held liable.\r\n\r\nIn view of the preceding facts, and for the additional reason that the\r\nsubject of the liability of the United States is now being investigated\r\nby the Department of Justice, it is respectfully suggested that the\r\ninclosed act to amend chapter 166 of the laws of the second session of\r\nthe Forty-third Congress (S. 692) should not become a law.\r\n\r\nA.A.

These sections were\r\nsubsequently embodied in the revision of the statutes.\r\n\r\nIf the accompanying bill should become a law in its present form, it\r\nwould, in my judgment, fail to give effect to its provisions. The bill\r\nis a very important one for the service of the Post-Office Department.\r\nEfforts have been made for four or five years past to induce Congress to\r\npass just such a law. To break up the vicious system of straw bidding,\r\nthis bill would be very valuable, and I regret exceedingly that a\r\nmistake should have been made in the title and enacting clause which\r\nwill render its provisions inoperative.\r\n\r\nI therefore suggest that the attention of the House in which it\r\noriginated shall be called to the defects in the bill explained above;\r\nand to enable that body to understand very fully what, in my judgment,\r\nwould be required to perfect it, I would suggest that the title should\r\nread \"A bill to amend subsections 246 and 251 of section 12 of an\r\nact entitled 'An act making appropriations for the service of the\r\nPost-Office Department for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1875, and for\r\nother purposes,' approved June 23, 1874, and also to amend section 3954\r\nof the Revised Statutes,\" and that the enacting clause of the bill\r\nshould be changed in conformity therewith.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJAS.

He again enlisted as\r\nprivate, Nineteenth Ohio Volunteers, September 10, 1861; was promoted\r\nfirst lieutenant November 1, 1861, and resigned September 27, 1862. He\r\nwas commissioned captain, One hundred and seventh Ohio Volunteers,\r\nNovember 11, 1862; was wounded at Chancellorsville, Va., May 2, 1863,\r\nand discharged for physical disability January 1, 1865. He was again\r\nmustered into service February 8, 1865, as major, Fifth United States\r\nVeteran Volunteers (Hancock's Corps), and mustered out March 20, 1866.\r\nWas brevetted lieutenant-colonel, colonel, and brigadier-general of\r\nvolunteers March 13, 1865.\r\n\r\nHe was appointed captain, Thirty-fifth United States Infantry, July 28,\r\n1866; became unassigned August 12, 1869; assigned to Nineteenth Infantry\r\nAugust 5, 1870, and transferred to Ninth Cavalry January 1, 1871.\r\nRetired August 24, 1872.\r\n\r\nJuly 8, 1869, Captain Meyer applied for retirement on account of wounds\r\nreceived at Chancellorsville May 2, 1863, by which he was incapacitated\r\nfor active service. No action was then had on the request, pending\r\naction by Congress reducing the Army.\r\n\r\nOctober 6, 1869, he asked to be placed on waiting orders, being unfit\r\nfor duty, and no possibility of improvement without going North. He was\r\naccordingly relieved from duty and ordered home to await orders.\r\n\r\nDecember 18, 1869, he called on the Secretary of War and asked to be\r\nassigned to duty.\r\n\r\nJanuary 4, 1870, he again applied to be assigned to duty with some\r\nregiment on the frontier, stating that his wound had healed, etc.,\r\nand asking to withdraw his previous request for retirement. This was\r\naccompanied by a similar request from his father, Mr. S. Meyer, of Ohio.\r\n\r\nJuly 29, 1870, he applied the third time to withdraw application for\r\nretirement and to be assigned to duty. On January 1, 1871, in accordance\r\nwith his repeated requests to be assigned to duty, he was assigned to\r\nthe Ninth Cavalry, serving in Texas. He joined the regiment, and on\r\nMarch 4, 1872, he renewed his former request to be ordered before a\r\nretiring board, stating that he found his injuries would not allow him\r\nto remain on duty on the frontier; that his disability was constantly\r\nincreasing, etc. The medical director of the department approved the\r\nrequest, and added that Captain Meyer's wounds certainly unfitted him\r\nfor service on the frontier.\r\n\r\nApril 13, 1872, Senator Sherman joined in requesting retirement of\r\nCaptain Meyer. He was ordered before the retiring board and on August\r\n20, 1872, was examined.\r\n\r\nThe board found Captain Meyer \"incapacitated for active service, and\r\nthat said incapacity results from a gunshot wound received in his lower\r\njaw at the battle of Chancellorsville, Va., May 2, 1863,\" when captain\r\nin One hundred and seventh Ohio Volunteers. He was retired in accordance\r\nwith the finding.\r\n\r\nMarch 21 and December 6, 1873, Captain Meyer asked restoration to active\r\nservice and reappointment as a captain of cavalry, which application was\r\ndisapproved by the General of the Army.\r\n\r\nPending the action on the bill before Congress no reports were called\r\nfor as to the official facts of record in the War Department, and no\r\nevidence has been filed in this office showing that he has sufficiently\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nThe absence of such evidence and the fact that after one assignment to\r\nactive duty he has failed to be sufficiently recovered are submitted as\r\nobjections why the bill should not be approved.\r\n\r\nE.D. TOWNSEND, _Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 15, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith return House bill No. 4085 without my approval. The repeal of\r\nthe clause in the original bill for paving Pennsylvania avenue fixing\r\nthe time for the completion of the work by December 1, 1876, is\r\nobjectionable in this, that it fixes no date when the work is to be\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nExperience shows that where contractors have unlimited time to complete\r\nany given work they consult their own convenience, and not the public\r\ngood. Should Congress deem it proper to amend the present bill in such\r\nmanner as to fix the date for the completion of the work to be done by\r\nany date between December 1 and the close of my official term, it will\r\nreceive my approval.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 15, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nFor the reasons stated in the accompanying communication, submitted to\r\nme by the Acting Secretary of the Interior, I have the honor to return\r\nherewith without my approval Senate bill No. 779, entitled \"An act to\r\nprovide for the sale of a portion of the reservation of the confederated\r\nOtoe and Missouria and the Sacs and Foxes of the Missouri tribes of\r\nIndians, in the States of Kansas and Nebraska.\"\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, _Washington, D.C., August 14, 1876_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to return herewith the bill (S. No. 779) entitled\r\n\"An act to provide for the sale of a portion of the reservation of the\r\nconfederated Otoe and Missouria and the Sacs and Foxes of the Missouri\r\ntribes of Indians, in the States of Kansas and Nebraska,\" and to invite\r\nyour attention to the inclosed copy of a letter this day addressed to me\r\nby the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, stating that the bill, in his\r\nopinion, should not become a law.\r\n\r\nI fully concur in the opinion expressed by the Commissioner, and for the\r\nreasons stated in his letter do not feel at liberty to recommend your\r\napproval of the bill. I have the honor to be, with great respect, your\r\nobedient servant,\r\n\r\nCHAS. T. GORHAM, _Acting Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,\r\n\r\nOFFICE OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\r\n\r\n_Washington, D.C., August 14, 1876_.\r\n\r\nThe HONORABLE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to return herewith, in accordance with your verbal\r\nrequest, a bill entitled \"An act to provide for the sale of a portion of\r\nthe reservation of the confederated Otoe and Missouria and the Sacs and\r\nFoxes of the Missouri tribes of Indians, in the States of Kansas and\r\nNebraska,\" with my views thereon, the same having passed both Houses of\r\nCongress and now awaits the approval of the President.\r\n\r\nYour attention is respectfully invited to the act of June 10, 1872 (17\r\nU.S. Statutes at Large, p. 391), which provides for the sale of these\r\nreservations, or a portion of them. The whole of both these reservations\r\nhas been surveyed, a portion in accordance with this act of Congress and\r\nthe remainder with a view to the allotment of lands to the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe second section of the bill provides for the appraisement of the\r\nwhole reservation, while the third section authorizes the sale of a\r\nportion not exceeding 120,000 acres, a portion of which is in Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe bill authorizes the sale of that portion lying in Kansas through the\r\nland office located at Beatrice, Nebr. No provision is made for the\r\nrelief of such Indians, if any there be, who may have settled upon the\r\nportion authorized to be sold, and who may have made improvements\r\nthereon. Moreover, in fulfillment of treaty obligations, the assent of\r\nthe Indians to the operations of the whole bill, and not simply to the\r\nfirst section, should be required, as in the case of the Menominees (16\r\nU.S. Statutes at Large, p. 410). In my opinion, this bill should not\r\nreceive the approval of the President.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ.Q. SMITH, _Commissioner_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[The Senate proceeded, as the Constitution prescribes, to reconsider\r\nthe said bill returned by the President of the United States with his\r\nobjections, and pending the question, Shall the bill pass, the\r\nobjections of the President of the United States to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding? the following message was received:]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 15, 1876_,\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nUpon further investigation I am convinced that my message of this date,\r\nwithholding my signature from Senate bill No. 779, entitled \"An act to\r\nprovide for the sale of a portion of the reservation of the confederated\r\nOtoe and Missouria and the Sacs and Foxes of the Missouri tribes of\r\nIndians, in the States of Kansas and Nebraska,\" was premature, and I\r\nrequest, therefore, that the bill may be returned, in order that I may\r\naffix my signature to it.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[A motion to refer the last message to the Committee on Privileges\r\nand Elections was, after debate, determined in the negative; and the\r\nquestion recurring, Shall the bill pass, the objections of the President of\r\nthe United States to the contrary notwithstanding? it was determined in\r\nthe affirmative--yeas 36, nays 0.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _August 15, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nFor the reasons presented in the accompanying communications, submitted\r\nby the Secretary of War, I have the honor to return herewith without my\r\napproval Senate bill No. 561, entitled \"An act for the relief of Major\r\nJunius T. Turner.\"\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, _Washington City, August 14, 1876_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to return Senate bill 561, \"for the relief of\r\nMajor Junius T. Turner,\" with copy of the report of the Adjutant-General\r\nof this date, stating objections to the approval of the bill.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ.D. CAMERON, _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_August 14, 1876_.\r\n\r\nRespectfully returned to the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nThe following objections exist to this bill becoming a law:\r\n\r\nThe bill as passed both Houses awards \"such sum as shall equal the\r\ntravel pay of a captain of volunteers from Washington, D.C., to San\r\nFrancisco, Cal.,\" whereas at the date of the discharge of Junius T.\r\nTurner he was a private of Company B, California Battalion, Second\r\nMassachusetts Cavalry, and not a commissioned officer.\r\n\r\nAside from this, under the established regulations and rulings of the\r\nTreasury and War Departments, \"a soldier, on receiving and accepting\r\na commission as a company officer, is not entitled to traveling\r\nallowances.\" A departure from this rule, heretofore adhered to, would\r\nopen up a very wide field for similar claims.\r\n\r\nPrivate Junius T. Turner, Second Massachusetts Cavalry, was discharged\r\nby way of favor March 28, 1864, to accept promotion as second\r\nlieutenant, Third Maryland Cavalry, and was mustered as of that grade in\r\nsaid regiment March 29, 1864.\r\n\r\nHe was honorably discharged September 7, 1865, as captain, Third\r\nMaryland Cavalry, as set forth in the inclosed official copy of a\r\nletter[113] from this office, dated June 7, 1876, to Hon. C.D. MacDougall,\r\nM.C., of Committee on Military Affairs, House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nE.D.

At the next (second) session of the\r\nForty-fourth Congress the following message was received:]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 12, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the adjournment of the last session of Congress I returned\r\nto the Senate bill No. 561, entitled \"An act for the relief of Major\r\nJunius T.

I now\r\ndesire to withdraw those objections, as I am satisfied they were made\r\nunder a misapprehension of the facts.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[This message was also referred to the Committee on Military Affairs,\r\nwhich committee, on February 13, 1877, reported to the Senate a\r\nrecommendation that the bill do pass, the objections of the President of\r\nthe United States to the contrary notwithstanding.

HUNTER,\r\n    _Acting Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas it has been satisfactorily shown to me that insurrection and\r\ndomestic violence exist in several counties of the State of South\r\nCarolina, and that certain combinations of men against law exist in\r\nmany counties of said State known as \"rifle clubs,\" who ride up and\r\ndown by day and night in arms, murdering some peaceable citizens and\r\nintimidating others, which combinations, though forbidden by the laws of\r\nthe State, can not be controlled or suppressed by the ordinary course of\r\njustice; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is provided in the Constitution of the United States that the\r\nUnited States shall protect every State in this Union, on application of\r\nthe legislature, or of the executive (when the legislature can not be\r\nconvened), against domestic violence; and\r\n\r\nWhereas by laws in pursuance of the above it is provided (in the laws of\r\nthe United States) that in all cases of insurrection in any State or of\r\nobstruction to the laws thereof it shall be lawful for the President of\r\nthe United States, on application of the legislature of such State, or\r\nof the executive (when the legislature can not be convened), to call\r\nforth the militia of any other State or States, or to employ such part\r\nof the land and naval forces as shall be judged necessary, for the\r\npurpose of suppressing such insurrection or causing the laws to be duly\r\nexecuted; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the legislature of said State is not now in session and can not\r\nbe convened in time to meet the present emergency and the executive of\r\nsaid State, under section 4 of Article IV of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States and the laws passed in pursuance thereof, has therefore\r\nmade due application to me in the premises for such part of the military\r\nforce of the United States as may be necessary and adequate to protect\r\nsaid State and the citizens thereof against domestic violence and to\r\nenforce the due execution of the laws; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is required that whenever it may be necessary, in the\r\njudgment of the President, to use the military force for the purpose\r\naforesaid, he shall forthwith, by proclamation, command such insurgents\r\nto disperse and retire peaceably to their respective homes within a\r\nlimited time:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Ulysses S. Grant, President of the United States,\r\ndo hereby make proclamation and command all persons engaged in said\r\nunlawful and insurrectionary proceedings to disperse and retire\r\npeaceably to their respective abodes within three days from this date,\r\nand hereafter abandon said combinations and submit themselves to the\r\nlaws and constituted authorities of said State.\r\n\r\nAnd I invoke the aid and cooperation of all good citizens thereof to\r\nuphold the laws and preserve the public peace.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 17th day of October, A.D. 1876, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States one hundred and one.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JOHN L. CADWALADER,\r\n    _Acting Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom year to year we have been accustomed to pause in our daily pursuits\r\nand set apart a time to offer our thanks to Almighty God for the special\r\nblessings He has vouchsafed to us, with our prayers for a continuance\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nWe have at this time equal reason to be thankful for His continued\r\nprotection and for the many material blessings which His bounty has\r\nbestowed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these favors accorded to us as individuals, we have\r\nespecial occasion to express our hearty thanks to Almighty God that by\r\nHis providence and guidance our Government, established a century ago,\r\nhas been enabled to fulfill the purpose of its founders in offering an\r\nasylum to the people of every race, securing civil and religious liberty\r\nto all within its borders, and meting out to every individual alike\r\njustice and equality before the law.\r\n\r\nIt is, moreover, especially our duty to offer our humble prayers to the\r\nFather of All Mercies for a continuance of His divine favor to us as a\r\nnation and as individuals.\r\n\r\nBy reason of all these considerations, I, Ulysses S. Grant, President of\r\nthe United States, do recommend to the people of the United States to\r\ndevote the 30th day of November next to the expression of their thanks\r\nand prayers to Almighty God, and, laying aside their daily avocations\r\nand all secular occupations, to assemble in their respective places of\r\nworship and observe such day as a day of thanksgiving and rest.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 26th day of October, A.D. 1876, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  HAMILTON FISH,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _Washington, May 20, 1876_.\r\n\r\nSIR:[114] The President directs me to say that the several Departments of\r\nthe Government will be closed on Tuesday, the 30th instant, to enable the\r\nemployees to participate in the decoration of the graves of the soldiers\r\nwho fell during the rebellion.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nC.C.

Michael C. Kerr, of Indiana.\r\n\r\nA man of great intellectual endowments, large culture, great probity and\r\nearnestness in his devotion to the public interests, has passed from the\r\nposition, power, and usefulness to which he had been recently called.\r\n\r\nThe body over which he had been selected to preside not being in\r\nsession to render its tribute of affection and respect to the memory of\r\nthe deceased, the President invites the people of the United States to a\r\nsolemn recognition of the public and private worth and the services of a\r\npure and eminent character.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JOHN L. CADWALADER,\r\n    _Acting Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _November 23, 1876_.\r\n\r\nA joint resolution adopted by Congress August 5, 1876, declares that--\r\n\r\n  Whereas it is ascertained that the hostile Indians of the Northwest are\r\n  largely equipped with arms which require special metallic cartridges,\r\n  and that such special ammunition is in large part supplied to such\r\n  hostile Indians, directly or indirectly, through traders and others in\r\n  the Indian country: Therefore,\r\n\r\n  _Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\n  States of America in Congress assembled_, That the President of the\r\n  United States is hereby authorized and requested to take such measures\r\n  as in his judgment may be necessary to prevent such special metallic\r\n  ammunition being conveyed to such hostile Indians, and is further\r\n  authorized to declare the same contraband of war in such district of\r\n  country as he may designate during the continuance of hostilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo carry into effect the above-cited resolution, the sale of fixed\r\nammunition or metallic cartridges by any trader or other person in\r\nany district of the Indian country occupied by hostile Indians, or\r\nover which they roam, is hereby prohibited; and all such ammunition or\r\ncartridges introduced into said country by traders or other persons,\r\nand that are liable in any way or manner, directly or indirectly, to\r\nbe received by such hostile Indians, shall be deemed contraband of war,\r\nseized by any military officer and confiscated; and the district of\r\ncountry to which this prohibition shall apply during the continuance\r\nof hostilities is hereby designated as that which embraces all Indian\r\ncountry, or country occupied by Indians or subject to their visits,\r\nlying within the Territories of Montana, Dakota, and Wyoming and the\r\nStates of Nebraska and Colorado.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 5, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn submitting my eighth and last annual message to Congress it seems\r\nproper that I should refer to and in some degree recapitulate the events\r\nand official acts of the past eight years.\r\n\r\nIt was my fortune, or misfortune, to be called to the office of Chief\r\nExecutive without any previous political training. From the age of 17\r\nI had never even witnessed the excitement attending a Presidential\r\ncampaign but twice antecedent to my own candidacy, and at but one of\r\nthem was I eligible as a voter.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances it is but reasonable to suppose that\r\nerrors of judgment must have occurred. Even had they not, differences\r\nof opinion between the Executive, bound by an oath to the strict\r\nperformance of his duties, and writers and debaters must have arisen.\r\nIt is not necessarily evidence of blunder on the part of the Executive\r\nbecause there are these differences of views. Mistakes have been made,\r\nas all can see and I admit, but it seems to me oftener in the selections\r\nmade of the assistants appointed to aid in carrying out the various\r\nduties of administering the Government--in nearly every case selected\r\nwithout a personal acquaintance with the appointee, but upon\r\nrecommendations of the representatives chosen directly by the people.\r\nIt is impossible, where so many trusts are to be allotted, that the\r\nright parties should be chosen in every instance. History shows that no\r\nAdministration from the time of Washington to the present has been free\r\nfrom these mistakes. But I leave comparisons to history, claiming only\r\nthat I have acted in every instance from a conscientious desire to do\r\nwhat was right, constitutional, within the law, and for the very best\r\ninterests of the whole people. Failures have been errors of judgment,\r\nnot of intent.\r\n\r\nMy civil career commenced, too, at a most critical and difficult time.\r\nLess than four years before, the country had emerged from a conflict\r\nsuch as no other nation had ever survived. Nearly one-half of the States\r\nhad revolted against the Government, and of those remaining faithful\r\nto the Union a large percentage of the population sympathized with the\r\nrebellion and made an \"enemy in the rear\" almost as dangerous as the\r\nmore honorable enemy in the front. The latter committed errors of\r\njudgment, but they maintained them openly and courageously; the former\r\nreceived the protection of the Government they would see destroyed, and\r\nreaped all the pecuniary advantage to be gained out of the then existing\r\nstate of affairs, many of them by obtaining contracts and by swindling\r\nthe Government in the delivery of their goods.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the cessation of hostilities the then noble President,\r\nwho had carried the country so far through its perils, fell a martyr\r\nto his patriotism at the hands of an assassin.\r\n\r\nThe intervening time to my first inauguration was filled up with\r\nwranglings between Congress and the new Executive as to the best mode\r\nof \"reconstruction,\" or, to speak plainly, as to whether the control\r\nof the Government should be thrown immediately into the hands of those\r\nwho had so recently and persistently tried to destroy it, or whether\r\nthe victors should continue to have an equal voice with them in this\r\ncontrol. Reconstruction, as finally agreed upon, means this and only\r\nthis, except that the late slave was enfranchised, giving an increase,\r\nas was supposed, to the Union-loving and Union-supporting votes. If\r\n_free_ in the full sense of the word, they would not disappoint this\r\nexpectation. Hence at the beginning of my first Administration the\r\nwork of reconstruction, much embarrassed by the long delay, virtually\r\ncommenced. It was the work of the legislative branch of the Government.\r\nMy province was wholly in approving their acts, which I did most\r\nheartily, urging the legislatures of States that had not yet done so\r\nto ratify the fifteenth amendment to the Constitution. The country\r\nwas laboring under an enormous debt, contracted in the suppression of\r\nrebellion, and taxation was so oppressive as to discourage production.\r\nAnother danger also threatened us--a foreign war. The last difficulty\r\nhad to be adjusted, and was adjusted without a war and in a manner\r\nhighly honorable to all parties concerned. Taxes have been reduced\r\nwithin the last seven years nearly $300,000,000, and the national debt\r\nhas been reduced in the same time over $435,000,000. By refunding\r\nthe 6 per cent bonded debt for bonds bearing 5 and 4-1/2 per cent\r\ninterest, respectively, the annual interest has been reduced from over\r\n$130,000,000 in 1869 to but little over $100,000,000 in 1876. The\r\nbalance of trade has been changed from over $130,000,000 against the\r\nUnited States in 1869 to more than $120,000,000 in our favor in 1876.\r\n\r\nIt is confidently believed that the balance of trade in favor of the\r\nUnited States will increase, not diminish, and that the pledge of\r\nCongress to resume specie payments in 1879 will be easily accomplished,\r\neven in the absence of much-desired further legislation on the subject.\r\n\r\nA policy has been adopted toward the Indian tribes inhabiting a large\r\nportion of the territory of the United States which has been humane and\r\nhas substantially ended Indian hostilities in the whole land except in a\r\nportion of Nebraska, and Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana Territories--the\r\nBlack Hills region and approaches thereto. Hostilities there have grown\r\nout of the avarice of the white man, who has violated our treaty\r\nstipulations in his search for gold. The question might be asked why\r\nthe Government has not enforced obedience to the terms of the treaty\r\nprohibiting the occupation of the Black Hills region by whites. The\r\nanswer is simple: The first immigrants to the Black Hills were removed\r\nby troops, but rumors of rich discoveries of gold took into that region\r\nincreased numbers. Gold has actually been found in paying quantity,\r\nand an effort to remove the miners would only result in the desertion\r\nof the bulk of the troops that might be sent there to remove them. All\r\ndifficulty in this matter has, however, been removed--subject to the\r\napproval of Congress--by a treaty ceding the Black Hills and approaches\r\nto settlement by citizens.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Indian policy and treatment is so fully set forth by the\r\nSecretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and my\r\nviews so fully expressed therein, that I refer to their reports and\r\nrecommendations as my own.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the United States with foreign powers continue on a\r\nfriendly footing.\r\n\r\nQuestions have arisen from time to time in the foreign relations of the\r\nGovernment, but the United States have been happily free during the past\r\nyear from the complications and embarrassments which have surrounded\r\nsome of the foreign powers.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic correspondence submitted herewith contains information as\r\nto certain of the matters which have occupied the Government.\r\n\r\nThe cordiality which attends our relations with the powers of the earth\r\nhas been plainly shown by the general participation of foreign nations\r\nin the exhibition which has just closed and by the exertions made by\r\ndistant powers to show their interest in and friendly feelings toward\r\nthe United States in the commemoration of the centennial of the nation.\r\nThe Government and people of the United States have not only fully\r\nappreciated this exhibition of kindly feeling, but it may be justly and\r\nfairly expected that no small benefits will result both to ourselves and\r\nother nations from a better acquaintance, and a better appreciation of\r\nour mutual advantages and mutual wants.\r\n\r\nCongress at its last session saw fit to reduce the amount usually\r\nappropriated for foreign intercourse by withholding appropriations for\r\nrepresentatives of the United States in certain foreign countries and\r\nfor certain consular officers, and by reducing the amounts usually\r\nappropriated for certain other diplomatic posts, and thus necessitating\r\na change in the grade of the representatives. For these reasons,\r\nimmediately upon the passage of the bill making appropriations for\r\nthe diplomatic and consular service for the present fiscal year,\r\ninstructions were issued to the representatives of the United States at\r\nBolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia, and to the consular officers for whom no\r\nappropriation had been made, to close their respective legations and\r\nconsulates and cease from the performance of their duties; and in like\r\nmanner steps were immediately taken to substitute chargés d'affaires\r\nfor ministers resident in Portugal, Denmark, Greece, Switzerland, and\r\nParaguay.\r\n\r\nWhile thoroughly impressed with the wisdom of sound economy in the\r\nforeign service, as in other branches of the Government, I can not\r\nescape the conclusion that in some instances the withholding of\r\nappropriations will prove an expensive economy, and that the small\r\nretrenchment secured by a change of grade in certain diplomatic posts is\r\nnot an adequate consideration for the loss of influence and importance\r\nwhich will attend our foreign representatives under this reduction. I am\r\nof the opinion that a reexamination of the subject will cause a change\r\nin some instances in the conclusions reached on these subjects at the\r\nlast session of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims, whose functions were\r\ncontinued by an act of the last session of Congress until the 1st day\r\nof January, 1877, has carried on its labors with diligence and general\r\nsatisfaction. By a report from the clerk of the court, transmitted\r\nherewith, bearing date November 14, 1876, it appears that within the\r\ntime now allowed by law the court will have disposed of all the claims\r\npresented for adjudication. This report also contains a statement of the\r\ngeneral results of the labors of the court to the date thereof. It is a\r\ncause of satisfaction that the method adopted for the satisfaction of\r\nthe classes of claims submitted to the court, which are of long standing\r\nand justly entitled to early consideration, should have proved\r\nsuccessful and acceptable.\r\n\r\nIt is with satisfaction that I am enabled to state that the work of the\r\njoint commission for determining the boundary line between the United\r\nStates and British possessions from the northwest angle of the Lake of\r\nthe Woods to the Rocky Mountains, commenced in 1872, has been completed.\r\nThe final agreements of the commissioners, with the maps, have been duly\r\nsigned, and the work of the commission is complete.\r\n\r\nThe fixing of the boundary upon the Pacific coast by the protocol of\r\nMarch 10, 1873, pursuant to the award of the Emperor of Germany by\r\nArticle XXXIV of the treaty of Washington, with the termination of the\r\nwork of this commission, adjusts and fixes the entire boundary between\r\nthe United States and the British possessions, except as to the portion\r\nof territory ceded by Russia to the United States under the treaty of\r\n1867. The work intrusted to the commissioner and the officers of the\r\nArmy attached to the commission has been well and satisfactorily\r\nperformed. The original of the final agreement of the commissioners,\r\nsigned upon the 29th of May, 1876, with the original official \"lists\r\nof astronomical stations observed,\" the original official \"list of\r\nmonuments marking the international boundary line,\" and the maps,\r\nrecords, and general reports relating to the commission, have been\r\ndeposited in the Department of State. The official report of the\r\ncommissioner on the part of the United States, with the report of the\r\nchief astronomer of the United States, will be submitted to Congress\r\nwithin a short time.\r\n\r\nI reserve for a separate communication to Congress a statement of the\r\ncondition of the questions which lately arose with Great Britain\r\nrespecting the surrender of fugitive criminals under the treaty of 1842.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Government gave notice, under date of January 15, 1874,\r\nof its desire to terminate the treaty of 1862, concerning commerce and\r\nnavigation, pursuant to the provisions of the twenty-second article\r\nthereof. Under this notice the treaty terminated upon the 5th day of\r\nJune, 1876. That Government has invited negotiations toward the\r\nconclusion of a new treaty.\r\n\r\nBy the act of Congress of March 23, 1874, the President was authorized,\r\nwhen he should receive satisfactory information that the Ottoman\r\nGovernment or that of Egypt had organized new tribunals likely to secure\r\nto citizens of the United States the same impartial justice enjoyed\r\nunder the exercise of judicial functions by diplomatic and consular\r\nofficers of the United States, to suspend the operation of the act of\r\nJune 22, 1860, and to accept for citizens of the United States the\r\njurisdiction of the new tribunals. Satisfactory information having been\r\nreceived of the organization of such new tribunals in Egypt, I caused a\r\nproclamation[115] to be issued upon the 27th of March last, suspending\r\nthe operation of the act of June 22, 1860, in Egypt, according to the\r\nprovisions of the act. A copy of the proclamation accompanies this\r\nmessage. The United States has united with the other powers in the\r\norganization of these courts. It is hoped that the jurisdictional\r\nquestions which have arisen may be readily adjusted, and that this\r\nadvance in judicial reform may be hindered by no obstacles.\r\n\r\nThe necessary legislation to carry into effect the convention respecting\r\ncommercial reciprocity concluded with the Hawaiian Islands in 1875\r\nhaving been had, the proclamation to carry into effect the convention,\r\nas provided by the act approved August 15, 1876, was duly issued upon\r\nthe 9th day of September last. A copy thereof accompanies this\r\nmessage.[116]\r\n\r\nThe commotions which have been prevalent in Mexico for some time past,\r\nand which, unhappily, seem to be net yet wholly quieted, have led to\r\ncomplaints of citizens of the United States of injuries by persons in\r\nauthority. It is hoped, however, that these will ultimately be adjusted\r\nto the satisfaction of both Governments. The frontier of the United\r\nStates in that quarter has not been exempt from acts of violence by\r\ncitizens of one Republic on those of the other. The frequency of these\r\nis supposed to be increased and their adjustment made more difficult\r\nby the considerable changes in the course of the lower part of the\r\nRio Grande River, which river is a part of the boundary between the\r\ntwo countries. These changes have placed on either side of that\r\nriver portions of land which by existing conventions belong to the\r\njurisdiction of the Government on the opposite side of the river.\r\nThe subject of adjustment of this cause of difficulty is under\r\nconsideration between the two Republics.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States of Colombia has paid the award\r\nin the case of the steamer _Montijo_, seized by authorities of that\r\nGovernment some years since, and the amount has been transferred to the\r\nclaimants.\r\n\r\nIt is with satisfaction that I am able to announce that the joint\r\ncommission for the adjustment of claims between the United States and\r\nMexico under the convention of 1868, the duration of which has been\r\nseveral times extended, has brought its labors to a close. From the\r\nreport of the agent of the United States, which accompanies the papers\r\ntransmitted herewith, it will be seen that within the time limited by\r\nthe commission 1,017 claims on the part of citizens of the United States\r\nagainst Mexico were referred to the commission. Of these claims 831 were\r\ndismissed or disallowed, and in 186 cases awards were made in favor of\r\nthe claimants against the Mexican Republic, amounting in the aggregate\r\nto $4,125,622.20. Within the same period 998 claims on the part of\r\ncitizens of the Mexican Republic against the United States were referred\r\nto the commission. Of these claims 831 were dismissed or disallowed, and\r\nin 167 cases awards were made in favor of the claimants against the\r\nUnited States, amounting in the aggregate to $150,498.41.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of the convention the amount of these awards is to be\r\ndeducted from the amount awarded in favor of our citizens against\r\nMexico, and the balance only to be paid by Mexico to the United States,\r\nleaving the United States to make provision for this proportion of the\r\nawards in favor of its own citizens.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the legislation which will be necessary to\r\nprovide for the payment.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I am pleased to be able to express the\r\nacknowledgments due to Sir Edward Thornton, the umpire of the\r\ncommission, who has given to the consideration of the large number of\r\nclaims submitted to him much time, unwearied patience, and that firmness\r\nand intelligence which are well known to belong to the accomplished\r\nrepresentative of Great Britain, and which are likewise recognized by\r\nthe representative in this country of the Republic of Mexico.\r\n\r\nMonthly payments of a very small part of the amount due by the\r\nGovernment of Venezuela to citizens of the United States on account of\r\nclaims of the latter against that Government continue to be made with\r\nreasonable punctuality. That Government has proposed to change the\r\nsystem which it has hitherto pursued in this respect by issuing bonds\r\nfor part of the amount of the several claims. The proposition, however,\r\ncould not, it is supposed, properly be accepted, at least without the\r\nconsent of the holders of certificates of the indebtedness of Venezuela.\r\nThese are so much dispersed that it would be difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, to ascertain their disposition on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn former messages I have called the attention of Congress to the\r\nnecessity of legislation with regard to fraudulent naturalization and to\r\nthe subject of expatriation and the election of nationality.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of persons of foreign birth seeking a home in the United\r\nStates, the ease and facility with which the honest emigrant may, after\r\nthe lapse of a reasonable time, become possessed of all the privileges\r\nof citizenship of the United States, and the frequent occasions which\r\ninduce such adopted citizens to return to the country of their birth\r\nrender the subject of naturalization and the safeguards which experience\r\nhas proved necessary for the protection of the honest naturalized\r\ncitizen of paramount importance. The very simplicity in the requirements\r\nof law on this question affords opportunity for fraud, and the want of\r\nuniformity in the proceedings and records of the various courts and in\r\nthe forms of the certificates of naturalization issued affords a\r\nconstant source of difficulty.\r\n\r\nI suggest no additional requirements to the acquisition of citizenship\r\nbeyond those now existing, but I invite the earnest attention of\r\nCongress to the necessity and wisdom of some provisions regarding\r\nuniformity in the records and certificates, and providing against the\r\nfrauds which frequently take place and for the vacating of a record of\r\nnaturalization obtained in fraud.\r\n\r\nThese provisions are needed in aid and for the protection of the honest\r\ncitizen of foreign birth, and for the want of which he is made to suffer\r\nnot infrequently. The United States has insisted upon the right of\r\nexpatriation, and has obtained, after a long struggle, an admission\r\nof the principle contended for by acquiescence therein on the part of\r\nmany foreign powers and by the conclusion of treaties on that subject.\r\nIt is, however, but justice to the government to which such naturalized\r\ncitizens have formerly owed allegiance, as well as to the United States,\r\nthat certain fixed and definite rules should be adopted governing such\r\ncases and providing how expatriation may be accomplished.\r\n\r\nWhile emigrants in large numbers become citizens of the United States,\r\nit is also true that persons, both native born and naturalized, once\r\ncitizens of the United States, either by formal acts or as the effect of\r\na series of facts and circumstances, abandon their citizenship and cease\r\nto be entitled to the protection of the United States, but continue on\r\nconvenient occasions to assert a claim to protection in the absence of\r\nprovisions on these questions.\r\n\r\nAnd in this connection I again invite your attention to the necessity\r\nof legislation concerning the marriages of American citizens contracted\r\nabroad, and concerning the status of American women who may marry\r\nforeigners and of children born of American parents in a foreign\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe delicate and complicated questions continually occurring with\r\nreference to naturalization, expatriation, and the status of such\r\npersons as I have above referred to induce me to earnestly direct your\r\nattention again to these subjects.\r\n\r\nIn like manner I repeat my recommendation that some means be provided\r\nfor the hearing and determination of the just and subsisting claims of\r\naliens upon the Government of the United States within a reasonable\r\nlimitation, and of such as may hereafter arise. While by existing\r\nprovisions of law the Court of Claims may in certain cases be resorted\r\nto by an alien claimant, the absence of any general provisions governing\r\nall such cases and the want of a tribunal skilled in the disposition of\r\nsuch cases upon recognized fixed and settled principles, either provides\r\nno remedy in many deserving cases or compels a consideration of such\r\nclaims by Congress or the executive department of the Government.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that other governments are in advance of the United\r\nStates upon this question, and that the practice now adopted is entirely\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nCongress, by an act approved the 3d day of March, 1875, authorized the\r\ninhabitants of the Territory of Colorado to form a State government,\r\nwith the name of the State of Colorado, and therein provided for the\r\nadmission of said State, when formed, into the Union upon an equal\r\nfooting with the original States.\r\n\r\nA constitution having been adopted and ratified by the people of that\r\nState, and the acting governor having certified to me the facts as\r\nprovided by said act, together with a copy of such constitution and\r\nordinances as provided for in the said act, and the provisions of\r\nthe said act of Congress having been duly complied with, I issued\r\na proclamation[117] upon the 1st of August, 1876, a copy of which is\r\nhereto annexed.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War shows that the Army has been actively\r\nemployed during the year in subduing, at the request of the Indian\r\nBureau, certain wild bands of the Sioux Indian Nation and in preserving\r\nthe peace at the South during the election. The commission constituted\r\nunder the act of July 24, 1876, to consider and report on the \"whole\r\nsubject of the reform and reorganization of the Army\" met in August\r\nlast, and has collected a large mass of statistics and opinions bearing\r\non the subject before it. These are now under consideration, and their\r\nreport is progressing. I am advised, though, by the president of the\r\ncommission that it will be impracticable to comply with the clause of\r\nthe act requiring the report to be presented, through me, to Congress\r\non the first day of this session, as there has not yet been time for\r\nthat mature deliberation which the importance of the subject demands.\r\nTherefore I ask that the time of making the report be extended to the\r\n29th day of January, 1877.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the resolution of August 15, 1876, the Army\r\nregulations prepared under the act of March 1, 1875, have not been\r\npromulgated, but are held until after the report of the above-mentioned\r\ncommission shall have been received and acted on.\r\n\r\nBy the act of August 15, 1876, the cavalry force of the Army was\r\nincreased by 2,500 men, with the proviso that they should be discharged\r\non the expiration of hostilities. Under this authority the cavalry\r\nregiments have been strengthened, and a portion of them are now in the\r\nfield pursuing the remnants of the Indians with whom they have been\r\nengaged during the summer.\r\n\r\nThe estimates of the War Department are made up on the basis of the\r\nnumber of men authorized by law, and their requirements as shown by\r\nyears of experience, and also with the purpose on the part of the bureau\r\nofficers to provide for all contingencies that may arise during the\r\ntime for which the estimates are made. Exclusive of engineer estimates\r\n(presented in accordance with acts of Congress calling for surveys and\r\nestimates for improvements at various localities), the estimates now\r\npresented are about six millions in excess of the appropriations for the\r\nyears 1874-75 and 1875-76. This increase is asked in order to provide\r\nfor the increased cavalry force (should their services be necessary),\r\nto prosecute economically work upon important public buildings, to\r\nprovide for armament of fortifications and manufacture of small arms,\r\nand to replenish the working stock in the supply departments. The\r\nappropriations for these last named have for the past few years been\r\nso limited that the accumulations in store will be entirely exhausted\r\nduring the present year, and it will be necessary to at once begin to\r\nreplenish them.\r\n\r\nI invite your special attention to the following recommendations of the\r\nSecretary of War:\r\n\r\nFirst. That the claims under the act of July 4, 1864, for supplies\r\ntaken by the Army during the war be removed from the offices of the\r\nQuartermaster and Commissary Generals and transferred to the Southern\r\nClaims Commission. These claims are of precisely similar nature to those\r\nnow before the Southern Claims Commission, and the War Department\r\nbureaus have not the clerical force for their examination nor proper\r\nmachinery for investigating the loyalty of the claimants.\r\n\r\nSecond. That Congress sanction the scheme of an annuity fund for the\r\nbenefit of the families of deceased officers, and that it also provide\r\nfor the permanent organization of the Signal Service, both of which were\r\nrecommended in my last annual message.\r\n\r\nThird. That the manufacturing operations of the Ordnance Department be\r\nconcentrated at three arsenals and an armory, and that the remaining\r\narsenals be sold and the proceeds applied to this object by the Ordnance\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations for river and harbor improvements for the current\r\nyear were $5,015,000. With my approval, the Secretary of War directed\r\nthat of this amount $2,000,000 should be expended, and no new works\r\nshould be begun and none prosecuted which were not of national\r\nimportance. Subsequently this amount was increased to $2,237,600, and\r\nthe works are now progressing on this basis.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of the South Pass of the Mississippi River, under James\r\nB. Eads and his associates, is progressing favorably. At the present\r\ntime there is a channel of 20.3 feet in depth between the jetties at\r\nthe mouth of the pass and 18.5 feet at the head of the pass. Neither\r\nchannel, however, has the width required before payments can be made by\r\nthe United States. A commission of engineer officers is now examining\r\nthese works, and their reports will be presented as soon as received.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy shows that branch of the service\r\nto be in condition as effective as it is possible to keep it with the\r\nmeans and authority given the Department. It is, of course, not possible\r\nto rival the costly and progressive establishments of great European\r\npowers with the old material of our Navy, to which no increase has been\r\nauthorized since the war, except the eight small cruisers built to\r\nsupply the place of others which had gone to decay. Yet the most\r\nhas been done that was possible with the means at command; and by\r\nsubstantially rebuilding some of our old ships with durable material and\r\ncompletely repairing and refitting our monitor fleet the Navy has been\r\ngradually so brought up that, though it does not maintain its relative\r\nposition among the progressive navies of the world, it is now in a\r\ncondition more powerful and effective than it ever has been in time of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThe complete repairs of our five heavy ironclads are only delayed on\r\naccount of the inadequacy of the appropriations made last year for the\r\nworking bureaus of the Department, which were actually less in amount\r\nthan those made before the war, notwithstanding the greatly enhanced\r\nprice of labor and materials and the increase in the cost of the naval\r\nservice growing out of the universal use and great expense of steam\r\nmachinery. The money necessary for these repairs should be provided at\r\nonce, that they may be completed without further unnecessary delay and\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nWhen this is done, all the strength that there is in our Navy will be\r\ndeveloped and useful to its full capacity, and it will be powerful for\r\npurposes of defense, and also for offensive action, should the necessity\r\nfor that arise within a reasonable distance from our shores.\r\n\r\nThe fact that our Navy is not more modern and powerful than it is has\r\nbeen made a cause of complaint against the Secretary of the Navy by\r\npersons who at the same time criticise and complain of his endeavors to\r\nbring the Navy that we have to its best and most efficient condition;\r\nbut the good sense of the country will understand that it is really due\r\nto his practical action that we have at this time any effective naval\r\nforce at command.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General shows the excess of expenditures\r\n(excluding expenditures on account of previous years) over receipts for\r\nthe fiscal year ended June 30, 1876, to be $4,151,988.66.\r\n\r\nEstimated expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1878, are\r\n$36,723,432.43.\r\n\r\nEstimated revenue for same period is $30,645,165, leaving estimated\r\nexcess of expenditure, to be appropriated as a deficiency, of\r\n$6,078,267.43.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General, like his predecessor, is convinced that a\r\nchange in the basis of adjusting the salaries of postmasters of the\r\nfourth class is necessary for the good of the service as well as\r\nfor the interests of the Government, and urgently recommends that the\r\ncompensation of the class of postmasters above mentioned be based upon\r\nthe business of their respective offices, as ascertained from the sworn\r\nreturns to the Auditor of stamps canceled.\r\n\r\nA few postmasters in the Southern States have expressed great\r\napprehension of their personal safety on account of their connection\r\nwith the postal service, and have specially requested that their reports\r\nof apprehended danger should not be made public lest it should result in\r\nthe loss of their lives. But no positive testimony of interference has\r\nbeen submitted, except in the case of a mail messenger at Spartanburg,\r\nin South Carolina, who reported that he had been violently driven away\r\nwhile in charge of the mails on account of his political affiliations.\r\nAn assistant superintendent of the Railway Mail Service investigated\r\nthis case and reported that the messenger had disappeared from his post,\r\nleaving his work to be performed by a substitute. The Postmaster-General\r\nthinks this case is sufficiently suggestive to justify him in\r\nrecommending that a more severe punishment should be provided for the\r\noffense of assaulting any person in charge of the mails or of retarding\r\nor otherwise obstructing them by threats of personal injury.\r\n\r\n\"A very gratifying result is presented in the fact that the\r\ndeficiency of this Department during the last fiscal year was reduced\r\nto $4,081,790.18, as against $6,169,938.88 of the preceding year. The\r\ndifference can be traced to the large increase in its ordinary receipts\r\n(which greatly exceed the estimates therefor) and a slight decrease in\r\nits expenditures.\"\r\n\r\nThe ordinary _receipts_ of the Post-Office Department for the past seven\r\nfiscal years have increased at an average of over 8 per cent per annum,\r\nwhile the increase of _expenditures_ for the same period has been but\r\nabout 5.50 per cent per annum, and the _decrease_ of _deficiency_ in the\r\nrevenues has been at the rate of nearly 2 per cent per annum.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of Agriculture accompanying this message\r\nwill be found one of great interest, marking, as it does, the great\r\nprogress of the last century in the variety of products of the soil;\r\nincreased knowledge and skill in the labor of producing, saving, and\r\nmanipulating the same to prepare them for the use of man; in the\r\nimprovements in machinery to aid the agriculturist in his labors,\r\nand in a knowledge of those scientific subjects necessary to a thorough\r\nsystem of economy in agricultural production, namely, chemistry,\r\nbotany, entomology, etc. A study of this report by those interested in\r\nagriculture and deriving their support from it will find it of value in\r\npointing out those articles which are raised in greater quantity than\r\nthe needs of the world require, and must sell, therefore, for less than\r\nthe cost of production, and those which command a profit over cost of\r\nproduction because there is not an overproduction.\r\n\r\nI call special attention to the need of the Department for a new\r\ngallery for the reception of the exhibits returned from the Centennial\r\nExhibition, including the exhibits donated by very many foreign nations,\r\nand to the recommendations of the Commissioner of Agriculture generally.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the District Commissioners and the board of health are\r\njust received--too late to read them and to make recommendations\r\nthereon--and are herewith submitted.\r\n\r\nThe international exhibition held in Philadelphia this year, in\r\ncommemoration of the one hundredth anniversary of American independence,\r\nhas proven a great success, and will, no doubt, be of enduring advantage\r\nto the country. It has shown the great progress in the arts, sciences,\r\nand mechanical skill made in a single century, and demonstrated that we\r\nare but little behind older nations in any one branch, while in some we\r\nscarcely have a rival. It has served, too, not only to bring peoples and\r\nproducts of skill and labor from all parts of the world together, but in\r\nbringing together people from all sections of our own country, which\r\nmust prove a great benefit in the information imparted and pride of\r\ncountry engendered.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested by scientists interested in and connected with\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution, in a communication herewith, that the\r\nGovernment exhibit be removed to the capital and a suitable building\r\nbe erected or purchased for its accommodation as a permanent exhibit.\r\nI earnestly recommend this; and believing that Congress would second\r\nthis view, I directed that all Government exhibits at the Centennial\r\nExhibition should remain where they are, except such as might be injured\r\nby remaining in a building not intended as a protection in inclement\r\nweather, or such as may be wanted by the Department furnishing them,\r\nuntil the question of permanent exhibition is acted on.\r\n\r\nAlthough the moneys appropriated by Congress to enable the participation\r\nof the several Executive Departments in the International Exhibition\r\nof 1876 were not sufficient to carry out the undertaking to the full\r\nextent at first contemplated, it gives me pleasure to refer to the\r\nvery efficient and creditable manner in which the board appointed from\r\nthese several Departments to provide an exhibition on the part of the\r\nGovernment have discharged their duties with the funds placed at their\r\ncommand. Without a precedent to guide them in the preparation of such a\r\ndisplay, the success of their labors was amply attested by the sustained\r\nattention which the contents of the Government building attracted during\r\nthe period of the exhibition from both foreign and native visitors.\r\n\r\nI am strongly impressed with the value of the collection made by the\r\nGovernment for the purposes of the exhibition, illustrating, as it does,\r\nthe mineral resources of the country, the statistical and practical\r\nevidences of our growth as a nation, and the uses of the mechanical arts\r\nand the applications of applied science in the administration of the\r\naffairs of Government.\r\n\r\nMany nations have voluntarily contributed their exhibits to the United\r\nStates to increase the interest in any permanent exhibition Congress may\r\nprovide for. For this act of generosity they should receive the thanks\r\nof the people, and I respectfully suggest that a resolution of Congress\r\nto that effect be adopted.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress can not be too earnestly called to the\r\nnecessity of throwing some greater safeguard over the method of\r\nchoosing and declaring the election of a President. Under the present\r\nsystem there seems to be no provided remedy for contesting the\r\nelection in any one State. The remedy is partially, no doubt, in the\r\nenlightenment of electors. The compulsory support of the free school\r\nand the disfranchisement of all who can not read and write the English\r\nlanguage, after a fixed probation, would meet my hearty approval. I\r\nwould not make this apply, however, to those already voters, but I would\r\nto all becoming so after the expiration of the probation fixed upon.\r\nForeigners coming to this country to become citizens, who are educated\r\nin their own language, should acquire the requisite knowledge of ours\r\nduring the necessary residence to obtain naturalization. If they did not\r\ntake interest enough in our language to acquire sufficient knowledge of\r\nit to enable them to study the institutions and laws of the country\r\nintelligently, I would not confer upon them the right to make such\r\nlaws nor to select those who do.\r\n\r\nI append to this message, for convenient reference, a synopsis of\r\nadministrative events and of all recommendations to Congress made by me\r\nduring the last seven years. Time may show some of these recommendations\r\nnot to have been wisely conceived, but I believe the larger part will\r\ndo no discredit to the Administration. One of these recommendations\r\nmet with the united opposition of one political party in the Senate\r\nand with a strong opposition from the other, namely, the treaty for\r\nthe annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States, to which I will\r\nspecially refer, maintaining, as I do, that if my views had been\r\nconcurred in the country would be in a more prosperous condition to-day,\r\nboth politically and financially.\r\n\r\nSanto Domingo is fertile, and upon its soil may be grown just those\r\ntropical products of which the United States use so much, and which are\r\nproduced or prepared for market now by slave labor almost exclusively,\r\nnamely, sugar, coffee, dyewoods, mahogany, tropical fruits, tobacco,\r\netc. About 75 per cent of the exports of Cuba are consumed in the United\r\nStates. A large percentage of the exports of Brazil also find the same\r\nmarket. These are paid for almost exclusively in coin, legislation,\r\nparticularly in Cuba, being unfavorable to a mutual exchange of the\r\nproducts of each country. Flour shipped from the Mississippi River\r\nto Havana can pass by the very entrance to the city on its way to a\r\nport in Spain, there pay a duty fixed upon articles to be reexported,\r\ntransferred to a Spanish vessel and brought back almost to the point of\r\nstarting, paying a second duty, and still leave a profit over what would\r\nbe received by direct shipment. All that is produced in Cuba could be\r\nproduced in Santo Domingo. Being a part of the United States, commerce\r\nbetween the island and mainland would be free. There would be no export\r\nduties on her shipments nor import duties on those coming here. There\r\nwould be no import duties upon the supplies, machinery, etc., going\r\nfrom the States. The effect that would have been produced upon Cuban\r\ncommerce, with these advantages to a rival, is observable at a glance.\r\nThe Cuban question would have been settled long ago in favor of \"free\r\nCuba.\" Hundreds of American vessels would now be advantageously used in\r\ntransporting the valuable woods and other products of the soil of the\r\nisland to a market and in carrying supplies and emigrants to it. The\r\nisland is but sparsely settled, while it has an area sufficient for the\r\nprofitable employment of several millions of people. The soil would have\r\nsoon fallen into the hands of United States capitalists. The products\r\nare so valuable in commerce that emigration there would have been\r\nencouraged; the emancipated race of the South would have found there a\r\ncongenial home, where their civil rights would not be disputed and where\r\ntheir labor would be so much sought after that the poorest among them\r\ncould have found the means to go. Thus in cases of great oppression and\r\ncruelty, such as has been practiced upon them in many places within the\r\nlast eleven years, whole communities would have sought refuge in Santo\r\nDomingo. I do not suppose the whole race would have gone, nor is it\r\ndesirable that they should go. Their labor is desirable--indispensable\r\nalmost--where they now are. But the possession of this territory would\r\nhave left the negro \"master of the situation,\" by enabling him to demand\r\nhis rights at home on pain of finding them elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI do not present these views now as a recommendation for a renewal of\r\nthe subject of annexation, but I do refer to it to vindicate my previous\r\naction in regard to it.\r\n\r\nWith the present term of Congress my official life terminates.

John Sherman and other distinguished\r\ncitizens, in regard to the canvass of the vote for electors in the State\r\nof Louisiana.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 14, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to a resolution of the 7th instant of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, asking to be informed whether any, and what,\r\nnegotiations have or are being made with the Sioux Indians for their\r\nremoval to the Indian Territory, and under what authority the same has\r\nbeen and is being done, I submit herewith a report received from the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, which contains, it is believed, all the\r\ninformation in possession of his Department touching the matter of the\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 14, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 6th instant, requesting\r\ninformation \"as to whether troops of the United States were stationed\r\nat the city of Petersburg, in the State of Virginia, on the 7th of\r\nNovember, 1876, and, if so, under what authority and for what purpose,\"\r\nI submit the inclosed letters from the Secretary of War, to whom the\r\nresolution was referred, together with the report of the General of the\r\nArmy and accompanying papers.\r\n\r\nThese inclosures will give all the information called for by the\r\nresolution, and I confidently believe will justify the action taken.\r\nIt is well understood that the presence of United States troops at\r\npolling places never prevented the free exercise of the franchise by\r\nany citizen, of whatever political faith. If, then, they have had any\r\neffect whatever upon the ballot cast, it has been to insure protection\r\nto the citizen casting it, in giving it to the candidate of his unbiased\r\nchoice, without fear, and thus securing the very essence of liberty.\r\nIt may be the presence of twenty-four United States soldiers, under the\r\ncommand of a captain and lieutenant, quartered in the custom-house at\r\nPetersburg, Va., on the 7th of November, at a considerable distance from\r\nany polling place, without any interference on their part whatever, and\r\nwithout going near the polls during the election, _may have secured a\r\ndifferent result from what would have been obtained if they had not\r\nbeen there_ (to maintain the peace in case of riot) _on the face of\r\nthe returns_; but if such is the case it is only proof that in this\r\none Congressional district in the State of Virginia the legal and\r\nconstitutional voters have been able to return as elected the candidate\r\nof their choice.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 22, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith a letter, submitted by the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,\r\naccompanied by the report and journal of proceedings of the commission\r\nappointed on the 24th day of August last to obtain certain concessions\r\nfrom the Sioux Indians, in accordance with the provisions contained in\r\nthe Indian appropriation act for the current fiscal year.\r\n\r\nI ask your special consideration of these articles of agreement, as\r\namong other advantages to be gained by them is the clear right of\r\ncitizens to go into a country of which they have taken possession and\r\nfrom which they can not be excluded.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 22, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith a report (and papers which\r\naccompanied it) of the progress of the work committed to their charge,\r\naddressed to me by the commissioners appointed under the act of Congress\r\napproved July 19, 1876, authorizing the repavement of Pennsylvania\r\navenue.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 23, 1876_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nWhen Congress adjourned in August last the execution of the extradition\r\narticle of the treaty of 1842 between the United States and Great\r\nBritain had been interrupted.\r\n\r\nThe United States had demanded of Her Majesty's Government the surrender\r\nof certain fugitives from justice charged with crimes committed within\r\nthe jurisdiction of the United States, who had sought asylum and were\r\nfound within the territories of Her British Majesty, and had, in due\r\ncompliance with the requirements of the treaty, furnished the evidence\r\nof the criminality of the fugitives, which had been found sufficient to\r\njustify their apprehension and commitment for trial, as required by the\r\ntreaty, and the fugitives were held and committed for extradition.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government, however, demanded from the United States\r\ncertain assurances or stipulations as a condition for the surrender of\r\nthese fugitives.\r\n\r\nAs the treaty contemplated no such conditions to the performance of the\r\nobligations which each Government had assumed, the demand for\r\nstipulations on the part of this Government was repelled.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government thereupon, in June last, released two of the\r\nfugitives (Ezra D. Winslow and Charles J. Brent), and subsequently\r\nreleased a third (one William E. Gray), and, refusing to surrender, set\r\nthem at liberty.\r\n\r\nIn a message to the two Houses of Congress on the 20th day of June last,\r\nin view of the condition of facts as above referred to, I said:\r\n\r\nThe position thus taken by the British Government, if adhered to, can\r\nnot but be regarded as the abrogation and annulment of the article of\r\nthe treaty on extradition.\r\n\r\n  Under these circumstances it will not, in my judgment, comport with\r\n  the dignity or self-respect of this Government to make demands upon\r\n  that Government for the surrender of fugitive criminals, nor to\r\n  entertain any requisition of that character from that Government\r\n  under the treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle XI of the treaty of 1842 provided that \"the tenth article [that\r\nrelating to extradition] should continue in force until one or the other\r\nof the parties should signify its wish to terminate it, and no longer.\"\r\n\r\nIn view, however, of the great importance of an extradition treaty,\r\nespecially between two states as intimately connected in commercial and\r\nsocial relations as are the United States and Great Britain, and in the\r\nhope that Her Majesty's Government might yet reach a different decision\r\nfrom that then attained, I abstained from recommending any action by\r\nCongress terminating the extradition article of the treaty. I have,\r\nhowever, declined to take any steps under the treaty toward extradition.\r\n\r\nIt is with great satisfaction that I am able now to announce to Congress\r\nand to the country that by the voluntary act of Her Majesty's Government\r\nthe obstacles which had been interposed to the execution of the\r\nextradition article of the treaty have been removed.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of October last Her Majesty's representative at this\r\ncapital, under instructions from Lord Derby, informed this Government\r\nthat Her Majesty's Government would be prepared, as a temporary measure,\r\nuntil a new extradition treaty can be concluded, to put in force all\r\npowers vested in it for the surrender of accused persons to the\r\nGovernment of the United States under the treaty of 1842, without asking\r\nfor any engagement as to such persons not being tried in the United\r\nStates for other than the offenses for which extradition had been\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nI was happy to greet this announcement as the removal of the obstacles\r\nwhich had arrested the execution of the extradition treaty between the\r\ntwo countries.\r\n\r\nIn reply to the note of Her Majesty's representative, after referring to\r\nthe applications heretofore made by the United States for the surrender\r\nof the fugitives referred to in the correspondence which was laid before\r\nCongress at its last session, it was stated that on an indication of\r\nreadiness to surrender these persons an agent would be authorized to\r\nreceive them, and I would be ready to respond to requisitions which may\r\nbe made on the part of Her Majesty's Government under the tenth article\r\nof the treaty of 1842, which I would then regard as in full force until\r\nsuch time as either Government shall avail itself of the right to\r\nterminate it provided by the eleventh article, or until a more\r\ncomprehensive arrangement can be reached between the two Governments in\r\nregard to the extradition of criminals--an object to which the attention\r\nof this Government would gladly be given, with an earnest desire for a\r\nmutually satisfactory result.\r\n\r\nA copy of the correspondence between Her Majesty's representative at\r\nthis capital and the Secretary of State on the subject is transmitted\r\nherewith.\r\n\r\nIt is with great satisfaction that I have now to announce that Her\r\nMajesty's Government, while expressing its desire not to be understood\r\nto recede from the interpretation which in its previous correspondence\r\nit has put upon the treaty, but having regard to the prospect of\r\na new treaty and the power possessed by either party of spontaneously\r\ndenouncing the old one, caused the rearrest on the 4th instant of Brent,\r\none of the fugitives who had been previously discharged, and, after\r\nawaiting the requisite time within which the fugitive is entitled to\r\nappeal or to apply for his discharge, on the 21st instant surrendered\r\nhim to the agent appointed on behalf of this Government to receive and\r\nto convey him to the United States.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government has expressed an earnest desire to rearrest\r\nand to deliver up Winslow and Gray, the other fugitives who had been\r\narrested and committed on the requisition of the United States, but\r\nwere released because of the refusal of the United States to give\r\nthe assurances and stipulations then required by Great Britain.\r\nThese persons, however, are believed to have escaped from British\r\njurisdiction; a diligent search has failed to discover them.\r\n\r\nAs the surrender of Brent without condition or stipulation of any kind\r\nbeing asked removes the obstacle which interrupted the execution of the\r\ntreaty, I shall no longer abstain from making demands upon Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment for the surrender of fugitive criminals, nor from\r\nentertaining requisitions of that character from that Government under\r\nthe treaty of 1842, but will again regard the treaty as operative,\r\nhoping to be able before long to conclude with Her Majesty's Government\r\na new treaty of a broader and more comprehensive nature.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 8, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 19th\r\nultimo, I transmit herewith the report of the Secretary of State, together\r\nwith the papers[118] which accompanied it.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: Correspondence relative to the Venezuelan mixed

the\r\nHouse of Representatives, respecting the expenditure of certain moneys\r\nappropriated by the act of August 14, 1876, for river and harbor\r\nimprovements, I have the honor to transmit herewith, for your\r\ninformation, a report and accompanying papers received from the\r\nSecretary of War, to whom the resolution was referred.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 15, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe joint resolution authorizing the Secretary of War to supply blankets\r\nto the Reform School in the District of Columbia is before me.\r\n\r\nI am in entire sympathy with the purpose of the resolution, but\r\nbefore taking any action upon it I deem it my duty to submit for your\r\nconsideration the accompanying letter, received from the Secretary of\r\nWar, embodying a report, made in anticipation of the passage of the\r\nresolution, by the Quartermaster-General of the Army, in which, among\r\nother facts, it is stated that--\r\n\r\n  The appropriation for clothing for the Army for this fiscal year is much\r\n  smaller than usual, and the supply of blankets which it will allow us to\r\n  purchase is so small that none can properly be spared for other purposes\r\n  than the supply of the Army.\r\n\r\n  If it be thought by Congress worth while to cause the supply of blankets\r\n  for the institution referred to to be procured through the War\r\n  Department, it is respectfully suggested that provision to meet the\r\n  expense be made by special appropriation.\r\n\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 19, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAt the request of the Attorney-General, I have the honor to transmit\r\nherewith a report in answer to the resolution of the House adopted\r\non the 1st of August, 1876, relative to certain matters occurring in\r\nthe administration of the provisional government of the District of\r\nColumbia, and chiefly affecting the Commissioners and the late board\r\nof audit.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 20, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United

GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 22, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 8th\r\nof December last, inquiring whether any increase in the cavalry force of\r\nthe army on the Mexican frontier of Texas has been made, as authorized\r\nby the act of July 24, 1876, and whether any troops have been removed\r\nfrom the frontier of Texas and from the post of Fort Sill, on the Kiowa\r\nand Comanche Reservation, and whether, if so, their places have been\r\nsupplied by other forces, I have the honor to transmit a report received\r\nfrom the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 22, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nOn the 9th day of December, 1876, the following resolution of the House\r\nof Representatives was received, namely:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the President be requested, if not incompatible with\r\n  the public interest, to transmit to this House copies of any and all\r\n  orders or directions emanating from him or from either of the Executive\r\n  Departments of the Government to any military commander or civil officer\r\n  with reference to the service of the Army, or any portion thereof, in\r\n  the States of Virginia, South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida since the\r\n  1st of August last, together with reports by telegraph or otherwise from\r\n  either or any of said military commanders or civil officers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was immediately or soon thereafter referred to the Secretary of War\r\nand the Attorney-General, the custodians of all retained copies of\r\n\"orders or directions\" given by the Executive Departments of the\r\nGovernment covered by the above inquiry, together with all information\r\nupon which such \"orders or directions\" were given.\r\n\r\nThe information, it will be observed, is voluminous, and, with the\r\nlimited clerical force in the Department of Justice, has consumed the\r\ntime up to the present. Many of the communications accompanying this\r\nhave been already made public in connection with messages heretofore\r\nsent to Congress. This class of information includes the important\r\ndocuments received from the governor of South Carolina and sent to\r\nCongress with my message on the subject of the Hamburg massacre; also\r\nthe documents accompanying my response to the resolution of the House\r\nof Representatives in regard to the soldiers stationed at Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThere have also come to me and to the Department of Justice, from time\r\nto time, other earnest written communications from persons holding\r\npublic trusts and from others residing in the South, some of which I\r\nappend hereto as bearing upon the precarious condition of the public\r\npeace in those States. These communications I have reason to regard as\r\nmade by respectable and responsible men. Many of them deprecate the\r\npublication of their names as involving danger to them personally.\r\n\r\nThe reports heretofore made by committees of Congress of the results of\r\ntheir inquiries in Mississippi and Louisiana, and the newspapers of\r\nseveral States recommending \"the Mississippi plan,\" have also furnished\r\nimportant data for estimating the danger to the public peace and order\r\nin those States.\r\n\r\nIt is enough to say that these different kinds and sources of evidence\r\nhave left no doubt whatever in my mind that intimidation has been used,\r\nand actual violence, to an extent requiring the aid of the United States\r\nGovernment, where it was practicable to furnish such aid, in South\r\nCarolina, in Florida, and in Louisiana, as well as in Mississippi, in\r\nAlabama, and in Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe troops of the United States have been but sparingly used, and in no\r\ncase so as to interfere with the free exercise of the right of suffrage.\r\nVery few troops were available for the purpose of preventing or\r\nsuppressing the violence and intimidation existing in the States above\r\nnamed. In no case, except that of South Carolina, was the number of\r\nsoldiers in any State increased in anticipation of the election, saving\r\nthat twenty-four men and an officer were sent from Fort Foote to\r\nPetersburg, Va., where disturbances were threatened prior to the\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nNo troops were stationed at the voting places. In Florida and in\r\nLouisiana, respectively, the small number of soldiers already in the\r\nsaid States were stationed at such points in each State as were most\r\nthreatened with violence, where they might be available as a posse\r\nfor the officer whose duty it was to preserve the peace and prevent\r\nintimidation of voters. Such a disposition of the troops seemed to me\r\nreasonable and justified bylaw and precedent, while its omission would\r\nhave been inconsistent with the constitutional duty of the President of\r\nthe United States \"to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\"\r\nThe statute expressly forbids the bringing of troops to the polls\r\n\"except where it is necessary to keep the peace,\" implying that to keep\r\nthe peace it may be done. But this even, so far as I am advised, has not\r\nin any case been done. The stationing of a company or part of a company\r\nin the vicinity, where they would be available to prevent riot, has been\r\nthe only use made of troops prior to and at the time of the elections.\r\nWhere so stationed, they could be called in an emergency requiring it by\r\na marshal or deputy marshal as a posse to aid in suppressing unlawful\r\nviolence. The evidence which has come to me has left me no ground to\r\ndoubt that if there had been more military force available it would have\r\nbeen my duty to have disposed of it in several States with a view to the\r\nprevention of the violence and intimidation which have undoubtedly\r\ncontributed to the defeat of the election law in Mississippi, Alabama,\r\nand Georgia, as well as in South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida.\r\n\r\nBy Article IV, section 4, of the Constitution--\r\n\r\n  The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a\r\n  republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against\r\n  invasion, and on application of the legislature, or of the executive\r\n  (when the legislature can not be convened), against domestic violence.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy act of Congress (U.S. Revised Statutes, secs. 1034, 1035) the\r\nPresident, in case of \"insurrection in any State\" or of \"unlawful\r\nobstruction to the enforcement of the laws of the United States by the\r\nordinary course of judicial proceedings,\" or whenever \"domestic violence\r\nin any State so obstructs the execution of the laws thereof and of the\r\nUnited States as to deprive any portion of the people of such State\" of\r\ntheir civil or political rights, is authorized to employ such parts\r\nof the land and naval forces as he may deem necessary to enforce the\r\nexecution of the laws and preserve the peace and sustain the authority\r\nof the State and of the United States. Acting under this title (69) of\r\nthe Revised Statutes United States, I accompanied the sending of troops\r\nto South Carolina with a proclamation[119] such as is therein prescribed.\r\n\r\nThe President is also authorized by act of Congress \"to employ such\r\npart of the land or naval forces of the United States * * * as shall\r\nbe necessary to prevent the violation and to enforce the due execution\r\nof the provisions\" of title 24 of the Revised Statutes of the United\r\nStates, for the protection of the civil rights of citizens, among\r\nwhich is the provision against conspiracies \"to prevent, by force,\r\nintimidation, or threat, any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote\r\nfrom giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner toward or in\r\nfavor of the election of any lawfully qualified person as an elector\r\nfor President or Vice-President or as a member of Congress of the\r\nUnited States.\" (U.S. Revised Statutes, sec. 1989.)\r\n\r\nIn cases falling under this title I have not considered it necessary to\r\nissue a proclamation to precede or accompany the employment of such part\r\nof the Army as seemed to be necessary.\r\n\r\nIn case of insurrection against a State government or against the\r\nGovernment of the United States a proclamation is appropriate; but in\r\nkeeping the peace of the United States at an election at which Members\r\nof Congress are elected no such call from the State or proclamation by\r\nthe President is prescribed by statute or required by precedent.\r\n\r\nIn the case of South Carolina insurrection and domestic violence against\r\nthe State government were clearly shown, and the application of the\r\ngovernor founded thereon was duly presented, and I could not deny his\r\nconstitutional request without abandoning my duty as the Executive of\r\nthe National Government.\r\n\r\nThe companies stationed in the other States have been employed to secure\r\nthe better execution of the laws of the United States and to preserve\r\nthe peace of the United States.\r\n\r\nAfter the election had been had, and where violence was apprehended by\r\nwhich the returns from the counties and precincts might be destroyed,\r\ntroops were ordered to the State of Florida, and those already in\r\nLouisiana were ordered to the points in greatest danger of violence.\r\n\r\nI have not employed troops on slight occasions, nor in any case where\r\nit has not been necessary to the enforcement of the laws of the United\r\nStates. In this I have been guided by the Constitution and the laws\r\nwhich have been enacted and the precedents which have been formed under\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt has been necessary to employ troops occasionally to overcome\r\nresistance to the internal-revenue laws from the time of the resistance\r\nto the collection of the whisky tax in Pennsylvania, under Washington,\r\nto the present time.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, when it was apprehended that resistance would be made in Boston\r\nto the seizure and return to his master of a fugitive slave, the troops\r\nthere stationed were employed to enforce the master's right under the\r\nConstitution, and troops stationed at New York were ordered to be in\r\nreadiness to go to Boston if it should prove to be necessary.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, when John Brown, with a small number of men, made his attack\r\nupon Harpers Ferry, the President ordered United States troops to assist\r\nin the apprehension and suppression of him and his party without a\r\nformal call of the legislature or governor of Virginia and without\r\nproclamation of the President.\r\n\r\nWithout citing further instances in which the Executive has exercised\r\nhis power, as Commander of the Army and Navy, to prevent or suppress\r\nresistance to the laws of the United States, or where he has exercised\r\nlike authority in obedience to a call from a State to suppress\r\ninsurrection, I desire to assure both Congress and the country that it\r\nhas been my purpose to administer the executive powers of the Government\r\nfairly, and in no instance to disregard or transcend the limits of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: See pp. 396-397.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 23, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, in answer to a resolution of the Senate of the 16th instant,\r\na report of the Secretary of State, with its accompanying papers.[120]\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: Correspondence with diplomatic officers of the United\r\nStates in Turkey relative to atrocities and massacres by Turks in\r\nBulgaria.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 25, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for consideration with a view to ratification,\r\na treaty between the United States and His Majesty the King of Spain, in\r\nrelation to the extradition of criminals, signed on the 5th of January,\r\n1877.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 29, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith the proceedings of the commission\r\nappointed to examine \"the whole subject of reform and reorganization of\r\nthe Army of the United States,\" under the provisions of the act of\r\nCongress approved July 24, 1876.\r\n\r\nThe commission report that so fully has their time been occupied by\r\nother important duties that they are not at this time prepared to submit\r\na plan or make proper recommendations.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 29, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith reports and accompanying papers\r\nreceived from the Secretaries of State and War, in answer to the\r\nresolution of the House of Representatives of the 9th instant, relative\r\n\"to the imprisonment and detention by the Mexican authorities at\r\nMatamoras of John Jay Smith, an American citizen, and also to the\r\nwounding and robbing by Mexican soldiers at New Laredo of Dr. Samuel\r\nHuggins, an American citizen.\"\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 29, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI follow the example heretofore occasionally permitted of communicating\r\nin this mode my approval of the \"act to provide for and regulate the\r\ncounting of votes for President and Vice-President, and the decision of\r\nquestions arising thereon, for the term commencing March 4, A.D. 1877,\"\r\nbecause of my appreciation of the imminent peril to the institutions of\r\nthe country from which, in my judgment, the act affords a wise and\r\nconstitutional means of escape.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in the history of our country, under the Constitution\r\nas it now is, a dispute exists with regard to the result of the election\r\nof the Chief Magistrate of the nation.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that upon the disposition of disputes touching the\r\nelectoral votes cast at the late election by one or more of the States\r\ndepends the question whether one or the other of the candidates for\r\nthe Presidency is to be the lawful Chief Magistrate. The importance of\r\nhaving clearly ascertained, by a procedure regulated by law, which of\r\nthe two citizens has been elected, and of having the right to this high\r\noffice recognized and cheerfully agreed in by all the people of the\r\nRepublic, can not be overestimated, and leads me to express to Congress\r\nand to the nation my great satisfaction at the adoption of a measure\r\nthat affords an orderly means of decision of a gravely exciting\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nWhile the history of our country in its earlier periods shows that\r\nthe President of the Senate has counted the votes and declared their\r\nstanding, our whole history shows that in no instance of doubt or\r\ndispute has he exercised the power of deciding, and that the two Houses\r\nof Congress have disposed of all such doubts and disputes, although in\r\nno instance hitherto have they been such that their decision could\r\nessentially have affected the result.\r\n\r\nFor the first time the Government of the United States is now brought to\r\nmeet the question as one vital to the result, and this under conditions\r\nnot the best calculated to produce an agreement or to induce calm\r\nfeeling in the several branches of the Government or among the people\r\nof the country. In a case where, as now, the result is involved,\r\nit is the highest duty of the lawmaking power to provide in advance a\r\nconstitutional, orderly, and just method of executing the Constitution\r\nin this most interesting and critical of its provisions. The doing so,\r\nfar from being a compromise of right, is an enforcement of right and\r\nan execution of powers conferred by the Constitution on Congress.\r\n\r\nI think that this orderly method has been secured by the bill, which,\r\nappealing to the Constitution and the law as the guide in ascertaining\r\nrights, provides a means of deciding questions of single returns through\r\nthe direct action of Congress, and in respect to double returns by\r\na tribunal of inquiry, whose decisions stand unless both Houses of\r\nCongress shall concur in determining otherwise, thus securing a definite\r\ndisposition of all questions of dispute, in whatever aspect they may\r\narise. With or without this law, as all of the States have voted, and\r\nas a tie vote is impossible, it must be that one of the two candidates\r\nhas been elected; and it would be deplorable to witness an irregular\r\ncontroversy as to which of the two should receive or which should\r\ncontinue to hold the office. In all periods of history controversies\r\nhave arisen as to the succession or choice of the chiefs of states, and\r\nno party or citizens loving their country and its free institutions can\r\nsacrifice too much of mere feeling in preserving through the upright\r\ncourse of law their country from the smallest danger to its peace on\r\nsuch an occasion; and it can not be impressed too firmly in the hearts\r\nof all the people that true liberty and real progress can exist only\r\nthrough a cheerful adherence to constitutional law.\r\n\r\nThe bill purports to provide only for the settlement of questions\r\narising from the recent elections. The fact that such questions can\r\narise demonstrates the necessity, which I can not doubt will before long\r\nbe supplied, of permanent general legislation to meet cases which have\r\nnot been contemplated in the Constitution or laws of the country.\r\n\r\nThe bill may not be perfect, and its provisions may not be such as would\r\nbe best applicable to all future occasions, but it is calculated to meet\r\nthe present condition of the question and of the country.\r\n\r\nThe country is agitated. It needs and it desires peace and quiet\r\nand harmony between all parties and all sections. Its industries are\r\narrested, labor unemployed, capital idle, and enterprise paralyzed by\r\nreason of the doubt and anxiety attending the uncertainty of a double\r\nclaim to the Chief Magistracy of the nation. It wants to be assured that\r\nthe result of the election will be accepted without resistance from the\r\nsupporters of the disappointed candidate, and that its highest officer\r\nshall not hold his place with a questioned title of right. Believing\r\nthat the bill will secure these ends, I give it my signature.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 30, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI desire to call the attention of Congress to the importance of\r\nproviding for the continuance of the board for testing iron, steel,\r\nand other metals, which by the sundry civil appropriation act of last\r\nyear was ordered to be discontinued at the end of the present fiscal\r\nyear. This board, consisting of engineers and other scientific experts\r\nfrom the Army, the Navy, and from civil life (all of whom, except\r\nthe secretary, give their time and labors to this object without\r\ncompensation), was organized by authority of Congress in the\r\nspring of 1875, and immediately drafted a comprehensive plan for\r\nits investigations and contracted for a testing machine of 400 tons\r\ncapacity, which would enable it to properly conduct the experiments.\r\nMeanwhile the subcommittees of the board have devoted their time to such\r\nexperiments as could be made with the smaller testing machines already\r\navailable. This large machine is just now completed and ready for\r\nerection at the Watertown Arsenal, and the real labors of the board are\r\ntherefore just about to be commenced. If the board is to be discontinued\r\nat the end of the present fiscal year, the money already appropriated\r\nand the services of the gentlemen who have given so much time to the\r\nsubject will be unproductive of any results. The importance of these\r\nexperiments can hardly be overestimated when we consider the almost\r\nendless variety of purposes for which iron and steel are employed in\r\nthis country and the many thousands of lives which daily depend on the\r\nsoundness of iron structures. I need hardly refer to the recent disaster\r\nat the Ashtabula bridge, in Ohio, and the conflicting theories of\r\nexperts as to the cause of it, as an instance of what might have been\r\naverted by a more thorough knowledge of the properties of iron and the\r\nbest modes of construction. These experiments can not properly be\r\nconducted by private firms, not only on account of the expense, but\r\nbecause the results must rest upon the authority of disinterested\r\npersons. They must therefore be undertaken under the sanction of the\r\nGovernment. Compared with their great value to the industrial interests\r\nof the country, the expense is very slight.\r\n\r\nThe board recommend an appropriation of $40,000 for the next\r\nfiscal year, and I earnestly commend their request to the favorable\r\nconsideration of Congress. I also recommend that the board be required\r\nto conduct their investigations under the direction of the Secretary of\r\nWar, and to make full report of their progress to that officer in time\r\nto be incorporated in his annual report.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 2, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, in answer to a resolution of the Senate of the 10th ultimo,\r\na report of the Secretary of State, with its accompanying papers.[121]\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: Preliminary and final reports of J. Hubley Ashton, agent\r\nof the United States before the United States and Mexican Claims\r\nCommission.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 3, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nBy the act of Congress approved January 14, 1875, \"to provide for the\r\nresumption of specie payments,\" the 1st of January, 1879, is fixed as\r\nthe date when such resumption is to begin. It may not be desirable to\r\nfix an earlier date when it shall actually become obligatory upon the\r\nGovernment to redeem its outstanding legal-tender notes in coin on\r\npresentation, but it is certainly most desirable, and will prove most\r\nbeneficial to every pecuniary interest of the country, to hasten the day\r\nwhen the paper circulation of the country and the gold coin shall have\r\nequal values.\r\n\r\nAt a later day, if currency and coin should retain equal values, it\r\nmight become advisable to authorize or direct resumption. I believe the\r\ntime has come when by a simple act of the legislative branch of the\r\nGovernment this most desirable result can be attained. I am strengthened\r\nin this view by the course trade has taken in the last two years and by\r\nthe strength of the credit of the United States at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1876, the exports of the United\r\nStates exceeded the imports by $120,213,102; but our exports include\r\n$40,569,621 of specie and bullion in excess of imports of the same\r\ncommodities. For the six months of the present fiscal year from July 1,\r\n1876, to January 1, 1877, the excess of exports over imports amounted\r\nto $107,544,869, and the import of specie and bullion exceeded the\r\nexport of the precious metals by $6,192,147 in the same time. The actual\r\nexcess of exports over imports for the six months, exclusive of specie\r\nand bullion, amounted to $113,737,040, showing for the time being the\r\naccumulation of specie and bullion in the country amounting to more than\r\n$6,000,000, in addition to the national product of these metals for the\r\nsame period--a total increase of gold and silver for the six months not\r\nfar short of $60,000,000. It is very evident that unless this great\r\nincrease of the precious metals can be utilized at home in such a way\r\nas to make it in some manner remunerative to the holders it must seek a\r\nforeign market as surely as would any other product of the soil or the\r\nmanufactory. Any legislation which will keep coin and bullion at home\r\nwill, in my judgment, soon bring about practical resumption, and will\r\nadd the coin of the country to the circulating medium, thus securing\r\na healthy \"inflation\" of a sound currency, to the great advantage of\r\nevery legitimate business interest.\r\n\r\nThe act to provide for the resumption of specie payments authorizes\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury to issue bonds of either of the\r\ndescriptions named in the act of Congress approved July 14, 1870,\r\nentitled \"An act to authorize the refunding of the national debt,\" for\r\nnot less than par in gold. With the present value of the 4-1/2 per cent\r\nbonds in the markets of the world, they could be exchanged at par for\r\ngold, thus strengthening the Treasury to meet final resumption and to\r\nkeep the excess of coin over demand, pending its permanent use as a\r\ncirculating medium, at home. All that would be further required would be\r\nto reduce the volume of legal-tender notes in circulation. To accomplish\r\nthis I would suggest an act authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to\r\nissue 4 per cent bonds, with forty years to run before maturity, to be\r\nexchanged for legal-tender notes whenever presented in sums of $50 or\r\nany multiple thereof, the whole amount of such bonds, however, not to\r\nexceed $150,000,000. To increase the home demand for such bonds I would\r\nrecommend that they be available for deposit in the United States\r\nTreasury for banking purposes under the various provisions of law\r\nrelating to national banks.\r\n\r\nI would suggest further that national banks be required to retain a\r\ncertain percentage of the coin interest received by them from the bonds\r\ndeposited with the Treasury to secure their circulation.\r\n\r\nI would also recommend the repeal of the third section of the joint\r\nresolution \"for the issue of silver coin,\" approved July 22, 1876,\r\nlimiting the subsidiary coin and fractional currency to $50,000,000.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that if Congress will enact some such law as will\r\naccomplish the end suggested they will give a relief to the country\r\ninstant in its effects, and for which they will receive the gratitude of\r\nthe whole people.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 9, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe accompanying memorial is transmitted to Congress at the request of a\r\ncommittee, composed of many distinguished citizens of New York, recently\r\nappointed to cooperate with a generous body of French citizens who\r\ndesign to erect in the harbor of New York a colossal statue of \"Liberty\r\nEnlightening the World.\" Very little is asked of us to do, and I hope\r\nthat the wishes of the memorialists may receive your very favorable\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 9, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the catalogues and report of the board on behalf of\r\nthe Executive Departments at the International Exhibition of 1876, with\r\ntheir accompanying illustrations.\r\n\r\nThe labors performed by the members of the board, as evinced by the\r\nvoluminous mass of information found in the various papers from the\r\nofficers charged with their preparation, have been in the highest\r\ndegree commendable, and believing that the publication of these papers\r\nwill form an interesting memorial of the greatest of international\r\nexhibitions and of the centennial anniversary of the independence of\r\nour country, I recommend that they be printed in a suitable form for\r\ndistribution and preservation.\r\n\r\nThe letter of the chairman of the board will give to Congress the\r\nhistory of its organization, the law and Executive orders under which it\r\nhas acted, and the steps which have been taken to preserve the large and\r\ninstructive collections made, with a view to their forming a part of a\r\nnational museum, should Congress make the necessary appropriations for\r\nsuch a desirable object.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 15, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in answer to the resolution of the Senate of the\r\n13th instant, a report from the Secretary of State, with accompanying\r\npapers.[122]\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: Statements of appropriations and expenditures of the\r\nDepartment of State from March 4, 1789, to June 30, 1876, inclusive.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 23, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, bearing date\r\nthe 20th instant, with its accompaniments, being the report of the\r\ncommissioner of the United States and of the officers of engineers\r\nattached to the commission appointed to determine the boundary line\r\nbetween the United States and the possessions of Great Britain from the\r\nnorthwest angle of the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Rocky\r\nMountains.

CHANDLER, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,\r\n\r\nGENERAL LAND OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, D.C., January 11, 1877_.\r\n\r\nThe HONORABLE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nSIR: I am in receipt, by your reference of yesterday's date, of \"An act\r\nto amend section 2291 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, in\r\nrelation to proof required in homestead entries,\" which has passed both\r\nHouses of Congress and now awaits the signature of the President.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the act is to enable parties seeking title under the\r\nhomestead law to make final proof before a judge or clerk of court in\r\nthe county or district where the lands are situated.\r\n\r\nIts provisions are in conformity with the views and recommendations of\r\nthis office, and I see no objection to them in so far as relates to the\r\ntaking of the testimony.\r\n\r\nI observe, however, that the second section provides that the proofs,\r\naffidavits, and oaths shall be filed in the office of the register, and\r\nno provision is made for the transmission of either the original papers\r\nor duplicates to this office, in order that patents may properly issue\r\nthereon, the provisions relating to certification for the purposes\r\nof evidence seeming to require that they shall remain on file in the\r\ndistrict office. There is, therefore, no opportunity for the supervisory\r\ncontrol of the Commissioner over entries so made to be exercised under\r\nthe statutes, and thus the express requirements of existing law, as well\r\nas the essential harmony of the land system, are interfered with by its\r\nprovisions. To remedy this defect in the proposed law I recommend that\r\nthe act be returned to the legislative body with the request for an\r\nenactment in lieu of the second section which shall provide for the\r\nregular transmission of the papers to this office, as in other cases, or\r\nthe simple striking out of the section altogether, as the provisions of\r\nexisting law would then cover the case, and require the same disposal\r\nof this class of entries as obtains under present regulations so far as\r\nrelates to the transmission of papers and proof to this office and the\r\ncertification of the same by the Commissioner, under seal, for purposes\r\nof evidence.\r\n\r\nI observe in section 3, line 4, the omission of the word \"he\" after the\r\nword \"corrupt,\" which destroys the grammatical construction of the\r\nlanguage and was probably a clerical error.\r\n\r\nI return herewith the act referred to.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. WILLIAMSON, _Commissioner_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 23, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith House bill (No. 4350) to abolish the board of\r\ncommissioners of the Metropolitan police of the District of Columbia and\r\nto transfer its duties to the Commissioners of the District of Columbia,\r\nwithout my approval.\r\n\r\nIt is my judgment that the police commissioners, while appointed by the\r\nExecutive, should report to and receive instructions from the District\r\nCommissioners. Under other circumstances than those existing at present\r\nI would have no objection to the entire abolition of the board and\r\nseeing the duties devolved directly upon the District Commissioners.\r\nThe latter should, in my opinion, have supervision and control over the\r\nacts of the police commissioners under any circumstances; but as recent\r\nevents have shown that gross violations of law have existed in this\r\nDistrict for years directly under the eyes of the police, it is highly\r\ndesirable that the board of police commissioners should be continued in\r\nsome form until the evil complained of is eradicated and until the\r\npolice force is put on a footing to prevent, if possible, a recurrence\r\nof the evil. The board of police commissioners have recently been\r\ncharged with the direct object of accomplishing this end.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 26, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return to the House of Representatives, in which they originated,\r\ntwo joint resolutions, the one entitled \"Joint resolution relating to\r\ncongratulations from the Argentine Republic,\" the other entitled \"Joint\r\nresolution in reference to congratulations from the Republic of\r\nPretoria, South Africa.\"\r\n\r\nThe former of these resolutions purports to direct the Secretary of\r\nState to acknowledge a dispatch of congratulation from the Argentine\r\nRepublic and the high appreciation of Congress of the compliment thus\r\nconveyed. The other directs the Secretary of State to communicate\r\nto the Republic of Pretoria the high appreciation of Congress of the\r\ncomplimentary terms in which said Republic has referred to the first\r\ncentennial of our national independence.\r\n\r\nSympathizing, as I do, in the spirit of courtesy and friendly\r\nrecognition which has prompted the passage of these resolutions, I can\r\nnot escape the conviction that their adoption has inadvertently involved\r\nthe exercise of a power which infringes upon the constitutional rights\r\nof the Executive.\r\n\r\nThe usage of governments generally confines their correspondence\r\nand interchange of opinion and of sentiments of congratulation, as\r\nwell as of discussion, to one certain established agency. To allow\r\ncorrespondence or interchange between states to be conducted by or with\r\nmore than one such agency would necessarily lead to confusion, and\r\npossibly to contradictory presentation of views and to international\r\ncomplications.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States, following the established usage\r\nof nations, has indicated the President as the agent to represent the\r\nnational sovereignty in its intercourse with foreign powers and to\r\nreceive all official communications from them. It gives him the power,\r\nby and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties and\r\nto appoint embassadors and other public ministers; it intrusts to him\r\nsolely \"to receive embassadors and other public ministers,\" thus vesting\r\nin him the origination of negotiations and the reception and conduct of\r\nall correspondence with foreign states, making him, in the language of\r\none of the most eminent writers on constitutional law, \"the\r\nconstitutional organ of communication with foreign states.\"\r\n\r\nNo copy of the addresses which it is proposed to acknowledge is\r\nfurnished. I have no knowledge of their tone, language, or purport. From\r\nthe tenor of the two joint resolutions it is to be inferred that these\r\ncommunications are probably purely congratulatory. Friendly and kindly\r\nintentioned as they may be, the presentation by a foreign state of any\r\ncommunication to a branch of the Government not contemplated by the\r\nConstitution for the reception of communications from foreign states\r\nmight, if allowed to pass without notice, become a precedent for the\r\naddress by foreigners or by foreign states of communications of a\r\ndifferent nature and with wicked designs.\r\n\r\nIf Congress can direct the correspondence of the Secretary of State\r\nwith foreign governments, a case very different from that now under\r\nconsideration might arise, when that officer might be directed to\r\npresent to the same foreign government entirely different and\r\nantagonistic views or statements.\r\n\r\nBy the act of Congress establishing what is now the Department of State,\r\nthen known as the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Secretary is to\r\n\"perform and execute such duties as shall from time to time be enjoined\r\non or intrusted to him by the President of the United States, agreeably\r\nto the Constitution, relative to correspondence, commissions, or\r\ninstructions to or with public ministers or consuls from the United\r\nStates, or to negotiations with public ministers from foreign states\r\nor princes, or to memorials or other applications from foreign public\r\nministers or other foreigners, or to such other matters respecting\r\nforeign affairs as the President of the United States shall assign to\r\nthe said Department; and furthermore, the said principal officer [the\r\nSecretary of State] shall conduct the business of the said Department\r\nin such manner as the President of the United States shall from time\r\nto time order or instruct.\"\r\n\r\nThis law, which remains substantially unchanged, confirms the view that\r\nthe whole correspondence of the Government with and from foreign states\r\nis intrusted to the President; that the Secretary of State conducts such\r\ncorrespondence exclusively under the orders and instructions of the\r\nPresident, and that no communication or correspondence from foreigners\r\nor from a foreign state can properly be addressed to any branch or\r\nDepartment of the Government except that to which such correspondence\r\nhas been committed by the Constitution and the laws.\r\n\r\nI therefore feel it my duty to return the joint resolutions without my\r\napproval to the House of Representatives, in which they originated.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the reasons already stated for withholding my\r\nconstitutional approval from these resolutions is the fact that\r\nno information is furnished as to the terms or purport of the\r\ncommunications to which acknowledgments are desired; no copy of the\r\ncommunications accompanies the resolutions, nor is the name even of the\r\nofficer or of the body to whom an acknowledgment could be addressed\r\ngiven; it is not known whether these congratulatory addresses proceed\r\nfrom the head of the state or from legislative bodies; and as regards\r\nthe resolution relating to the Republic of Pretoria, I can not learn\r\nthat any state or government of that name exists.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _January 26, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to return herewith without my approval Senate bill No.\r\n685, entitled \"An act to place the name of Daniel H. Kelly upon the\r\nmuster roll of Company F, Second Tennessee Infantry.\"\r\n\r\nThe reasons for withholding my signature to this bill may be found in\r\nthe accompanying report received from the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, _January 24, 1877_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to return herewith Senate bill 685, \"to place the\r\nname of Daniel H. Kelly upon the muster roll of Company F, Second\r\nTennessee Infantry,\" with the report of the Adjutant-General, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"The inclosed act directs the Secretary of War to place the name of\r\nDaniel H. Kelly upon the muster roll of Company F, Second Tennessee\r\nInfantry, to date December 1, 1861. There is no record of the\r\nenlistment, service, or death of this man on file in this office, and if\r\nthis act becomes a law as it now reads it will be of no benefit to the\r\nheirs.\"\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ.D. CAMERON, _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 14, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to return herewith without my approval House bill No.\r\n3367, entitled \"An act to remove the charge of desertion from the\r\nmilitary record of Alfred Rouland.\"\r\n\r\nThe reasons for withholding my signature may be found in the\r\naccompanying report received from the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, _Washington City, February 8, 1877_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to return House bill 3367, \"to remove the charge\r\nof desertion from the military record of Alfred Rouland,\" and inclose\r\ncopy of the report of the Adjutant-General, dated the 8th instant, who\r\nrecommends that the bill be not approved.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I would invite attention to reports of the Military\r\nCommittees of the House and Senate (House Report No. 461, Forty-fourth\r\nCongress, first session; Senate Report No. 578, Forty-fourth Congress,\r\nsecond session) in the case, of which copies are herewith.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ.D. CAMERON, _Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_February 8, 1877_.\r\n\r\nRespectfully returned to the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nThis man is reported on the muster-out roll of his company as having\r\n\"deserted at Wilmington, N.C., April 16, 1866.\"\r\n\r\nIn his petition of December 28, 1874, on file in this office, occurs the\r\nfollowing language:\r\n\r\n\"I was transferred to the Twenty-eighth Michigan Volunteers, and\r\nperformed duty with that regiment from the 28th June, 1865, until the\r\n16th day of April, 1866, when, being in a reduced and weak condition\r\nfrom continued chills and fever, and being in great fear of smallpox,\r\nwhich had become very prevalent at Wilmington, N.C., where my company\r\nwas then stationed, I left my command without leave and returned to\r\nMichigan.\" * * *\r\n\r\nThis man is consequently a deserter in fact, and should this bill,\r\nrestoring to an honorable status an admitted deserter, become a law,\r\nit will defeat every end of military discipline and justice, besides\r\nworking a great injustice to every soldier who served faithfully and\r\nhonorably.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore strongly recommended that it be not approved.\r\n\r\nE.D. TOWNSEND, _Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 14, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return the House bill No. 3155, entitled \"An act to perfect the\r\nrevision of the statutes of the United States,\" without my approval.\r\nMy objection is to the single provision which amends section 3823 of\r\nthe Revised Statutes.\r\n\r\nThat section is as follows:\r\n\r\n  SEC. 3823. The Clerk of the House of Representatives shall select in\r\n  Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama,\r\n  Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas one or more newspapers, not\r\n  exceeding the number allowed by law, in which such treaties and laws of\r\n  the United States as may be ordered for publication in newspapers\r\n  according to law shall be published, and in some one or more of which\r\n  so selected all such advertisements as may be ordered for publication\r\n  in said districts by any United States court or judge thereof, or by\r\n  any officer of such courts, or by any executive officer of the United\r\n  States, shall be published, the compensation for which and other terms\r\n  of publication shall be fixed by said Clerk at a rate not exceeding\r\n  $2 per page for the publication of treaties and laws, and not exceeding\r\n  $1 per square of eight lines of space for the publication of\r\n  advertisements, the accounts for which shall be adjusted by the proper\r\n  accounting officers and paid in the manner now authorized by law in the\r\n  like cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bill proposes to amend this section as follows:\r\n\r\nBy striking out all after the word \"in\" in the first line to the word\r\n\"one\" in the third line, and inserting therefor the words \"each State\r\nand Territory of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nPrior to 1867 the advertising of the Executive Departments had been\r\nsubject to the direction of the heads of those Departments, and had been\r\npublished in newspapers selected by them and on terms fixed by them.\r\nIn the year 1867 (14 U.S. Statutes at Large, pp. 466, 467), while the\r\nten States above named were yet unrestricted, and when there existed\r\na radical difference of opinion between the executive and legislative\r\ndepartments as to the administration of the Government in those States,\r\nthis provision was enacted. Subsequently, during the same year (15 U.S.\r\nStatutes at Large, p. 8), so much of this provision \"as relates to the\r\npublication of the laws and treaties of the United States\" was extended\r\nto all the States and Territories, leaving the advertisements ordered\r\nby Congress and by the Executive Departments unaffected thereby. The\r\ncontinuance of this provision after the reconstruction acts had taken\r\neffect and the bringing it forward into the Revised Statutes were\r\nprobably through inadvertence.\r\n\r\nThe existence of this section (3823) of the Revised Statutes seems to\r\nhave been ignored by Congress itself in the adoption of section 3941,\r\nauthorizing the Postmaster-General to advertise in such newspapers as\r\nhe may choose. But the present act, if it should go into effect, would\r\ncompel him and the other heads of the Executive Departments, as well\r\nas all the courts, to publish all their advertisements in newspapers\r\nselected by the Clerk of the House of Representatives. It would make\r\ngeneral in its operation a provision which, was exceptional and\r\ntemporary in its origin and character. This, in my judgment, would\r\nbe unwise, if not also an actual encroachment upon the constitutional\r\nrights of the executive branch of the Government. The person who should\r\nbe appointed by law to select all the newspapers throughout the country\r\nto which the patronage of all branches of the Government of the United\r\nStates should be given, if not an officer of the United States under\r\nArticle II, section 2, clause 2, of the Constitution, would certainly\r\nhave powers and duties which have hitherto been regarded as official.\r\n\r\nBut without reference to the question of its constitutionality, I am\r\nsatisfied that this provision would not operate usefully or fairly. I am\r\nconstrained, therefore, to withhold from it my approval. I regret that\r\nmy objection to this one clause of the act can not be made available\r\nwithout withholding my approval from the entire act, which is otherwise\r\nunobjectionable.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 28, 1877_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to return herewith without my approval Senate bill\r\nNo. 691, entitled \"An act for the relief of Edward A. Leland.\" The\r\nreasons for withholding my approval may be found in the accompanying\r\ncommunication received from the Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, _Washington, February 27, 1877_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to return herewith the bill (S. 691) entitled\r\n\"An act for the relief of Edward A. Leland,\" accompanied by a copy of\r\na letter from the Commissioner of Patents suggesting an objection to\r\nthe bill in its present form, and to recommend that it be returned\r\nto Congress for amendment in accordance with the suggestions of the\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully,\r\n\r\nZ. CHANDLER, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,\r\nUNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE,\r\n_Washington, D.C., February 27, 1877_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. Z. CHANDLER,\r\n_Secretary of the Interior_.\r\n\r\nSIR: In the matter of the enrolled bill (S. 691) extending letters\r\npatent of Edward A. Leland, I have the honor to report that said letters\r\npatent were granted for an improved paint can August 14, 1860, for the\r\nterm of fourteen years; that they consequently expired on the 14th day\r\nof August, 1874, whereupon the invention became the property of the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThe present act proposes to extend the term of the patent seven years\r\nfrom said 14th day of August, 1874, and give to it the same effect in\r\nlaw as if it had been originally granted for the term of twenty-one\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, therefore, that those who have innocently used and\r\npurchased the invention since the expiration of the letters patent on\r\nthe 14th of August, 1874, under the impression that the invention was\r\nthe property of the public, will, by the retroactive terms of the bill,\r\nbe liable for damages for such use upon suits for infringement.\r\n\r\nThis hardship is generally, if not always, provided against by a proviso\r\nto such bills, setting forth in terms \"that no person shall be held\r\nliable for the infringement of said patent, if extended, for making use\r\nof said invention since the expiration of the original term of said\r\npatent and prior to the date of its extension.\"\r\n\r\nUnless such a proviso is incorporated into the present bill, the\r\ninjustice alluded to may be done.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nELLIS SPEAR, _Commissioner of Patents_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas objects of interest to the United States require that the Senate\r\nshould be convened at 12 o'clock on the 5th day of March next to receive\r\nand act upon such communications as may be made to it on the part of the\r\nExecutive:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Ulysses S. Grant, President of the United States,\r\nhave considered it to be my duty to issue this my proclamation,\r\ndeclaring that an extraordinary occasion requires the Senate of the\r\nUnited States to convene for the transaction of business at the Capitol,\r\nin the city of Washington, on the 5th day of March next, at 12 o'clock\r\nat noon on that day, of which all who shall at that time be entitled to\r\nact as members of that body are hereby required to take notice.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States, at Washington,\r\nthe 2d day of March, A.D. 1877, and of the Independence of the United\r\nStates of America the one hundred and first.\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  HAMILTON FISH,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.",
