Gentlemen, the Commission will come to order.\r\n\r\nAre you ready to continue the testimony, Mr. Martin?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Will you carry forward, Mr. Redlich?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Martin, I would like to hand you a group of newspaper\r\nclippings which have not as yet been introduced in evidence and I would\r\nask you to look through them and to pick out any which you feel create\r\nan image of Mrs. Marina Oswald which you feel does not conform to the\r\nreality of her personality, as you know it, and ask you in regard to\r\neach one to tell us in what respect the facts as reported in each of\r\nthese clippings do not conform to the real person as you know her.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I assume we can avoid repetition, can't we?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Incidents here have been touched on in other papers and we\r\ndon't need to touch them again.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Yes, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nDuring the intermission we have gone through all of the newspaper\r\nclippings and eliminated the duplicate stories and hope to eliminate\r\nduplicate facts as we go along.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, this one is inaccurate that it doesn't have anything\r\nto do with her image, so to speak. It says she spent Christmas----\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. For the sake of the record if we are going to have comment\r\non them I would like to have them introduced as evidence because the\r\nrecord wouldn't state what they are about.\r\n\r\nAre you going to make comment?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Do you want me to?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. If you are going to make comment about it, if you feel\r\nthere is some inaccuracy here then I would like to introduce that in\r\nevidence, since apparently you are.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It is inaccurate as far as the date in the article is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. The witness has handed to us a newspaper story which we\r\nhave marked as Commission Exhibit No. 328.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could we have the inaccuracy mentioned here?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Yes, the headline of which is \"Mrs. Oswald Will Bare Life\r\nof Mate\" and I request it be admitted in evidence.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Any objection?\r\n\r\nMr. LEECH. No.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It will be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission's Exhibit No. 328 for\r\nidentification and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. I show you Commission Exhibit No. 328 and ask you if there\r\nare any inaccuracies in that statement.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. \"Mrs. Oswald and Her Children Now Make Their Home at an\r\nUndisclosed Hotel\" which is inaccurate--\"and it was in that motel room,\r\nsomewhere in the Dallas-Fort Worth area that the youngest Oswald child\r\nspent her first Christmas. There was a tree, toys and even a visit from\r\nMrs. Oswald's brother who lives 30 miles to the north in Denton, Tex.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the inaccuracy that she spent Christmas not in a motel but in\r\nour home.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is about from 3 o'clock in the afternoon as I recall\r\nuntil 7:30 in the evening.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, sir; that was Thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That was Thanksgiving. Spent the whole day of Christmas in\r\nyour home?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, she lived there. She was at our home 24 hours a day.\r\n\r\nThis one--\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. The witness has produced before the Commission a newspaper\r\nstory which we have labeled as Commission Exhibit No. 329, the headline\r\nof which reads, \"Money Gifts to Tippit's Near $200,000 Mark.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, I request that Commission Exhibit No. 329 be admitted in\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Any objection?\r\n\r\nMr. LEECH. No.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It shall be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 329 for\r\nidentification and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Martin, I hand you Exhibit No. 329 and ask you if it\r\nis inaccurate in any respect.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. The article states that Mrs. Shirley Williamson, a Fort\r\nWorth housewife, who felt compassion for the widow, Mrs. Oswald, and\r\nthe two babies said the fund for the Russian-born widow had reached\r\n$76,000.\"\r\n\r\nThe fund that Mrs. Williamson collected amounted to some $2,600. That\r\nwas her total. That is the inaccuracy there.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is she referring to the funds she collected or the whole\r\ncollections?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Her funds. This has come up numerous times. We even called\r\nher about it one time. She had given out press releases that she had\r\ncollected personally, I think, in excess of $8,000, whereas what she\r\nwas doing was adding what she had collected to what had already been\r\nsent to Marina, and saying that she was holding that money.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But even that total is exaggerated, is it not?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. At that time, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The total collections?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. At that time, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Martin, this article also makes reference to the fund\r\non behalf of the wife of Officer Tippit with which, of course, you have\r\nno connection.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask you, however, whether at the time you extended the\r\noffer to Marina Oswald to live in your home you were aware of the fact\r\nthat there were funds being raised for Officer Tippit's wife.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I was undoubtedly aware of it but I don't recall any\r\nconscious knowledge of it or thinking of it.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you recall whether you were aware at the time that\r\nthere were any funds coming in on behalf of Mrs. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. You were not aware?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Not aware, no.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. The witness has offered to, has presented to, the\r\nCommission a newspaper story appearing in the Buffalo Evening News,\r\nDecember 7, 1963, headline of which reads, \"Oswald's Widow Reported\r\nHoping to be U.S. Citizen.\"\r\n\r\nThis story has been identified as Commission Exhibit No. 330 and I ask\r\nthat it be introduced in evidence.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Any objection?\r\n\r\nMr. LEECH. None.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Accepted.\r\n\r\n(The newspaper article referred to was marked Commission's Exhibit No.\r\n330 for identification and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Martin, I show you Commission's Exhibit No. 330\r\nand ask you if it is inaccurate in any respect to the best of your\r\nknowledge?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. In the second paragraph it says, \"Mrs. Oswald, 23,\" which\r\nis inaccurate--\"Russian-born Mother of Three--\"\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Will you state the inaccuracy?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. The age is inaccurate. She is 22, \"Russian-born Mother of\r\nThree\" that is inaccurate. She is the mother of two, \"burst into tears\r\nwhen she learned at least $7,700 had been sent to her by sympathetic\r\nAmericans.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no burst of tears.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Will you tell the Commission what the reaction was?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I would say of happiness rather than--she was glad that\r\nthat was there, which is normal.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you recall anything she told you?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. This was December 7. No, I have no recollection of\r\nanything that she said?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Didn't you testify before, maybe it is with regard to\r\nanother or similar clipping, that she had some reference to the silly\r\nAmericans who were giving this money?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, it was a comment she had made at sometime or another.\r\nI don't know whether it was during this particular thing or not. I\r\nthink it was further on.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. On a similar occasion?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. A little later date, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Martin, you have commented on the respects in which\r\nthe newspaper clippings were at variance with the facts about Marina\r\nOswald as you knew them.\r\n\r\nAre there any other facts which perhaps were not reflected in these\r\nclippings but which you might be aware of in respect to which the\r\npublic image of Marina Oswald differed from the true person that you\r\nknew on the basis of your contact with her?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. Of course, she is not the least bit frugal. She spends\r\nmoney quite freely, which it is her money to spend, but it won't last\r\nvery long at the rate it is going.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. In connection with that did Marina Oswald ever discuss\r\nwith you the financial difficulties she may have encountered while she\r\nwas married to Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. She remarked one time that she had always wished for\r\n$500 just to do with as she wanted. She also mentioned that the small\r\namount of money that it took them to live upon. She said it ran between\r\n$130 and $135 a month.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did she complain about this limited amount?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. I asked her how she could live on that little and she\r\nsaid well, all they had was rent and food, and occasionally she would\r\nget a dress or get a pair of shoes. She said that she didn't object to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But when more money became available she found\r\nways and means of spending it?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. Well, she mentioned one time to me that--I told her\r\nshe was spending too much money, and she said, \"Well, when it is all\r\ngone I will go to work.\" That is----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is a little Russian, may I say for the record.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Martin, this Commission has recovered information to\r\nthe effect that the public announcements which you made concerning the\r\namount of funds which had been collected on Marina Oswald's behalf\r\nactually reflected figures that were less than the amount which had\r\nactually been collected on her behalf.\r\n\r\nWithout getting into specific figures at this time, are these reports\r\ncorrect in your opinion?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Which report?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. The report----\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Oh, yes, we were obtaining a smaller figure, that is true.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. That is true. Did you consult with Marina Oswald on this\r\npolicy on reporting to the press a lesser figure than had actually been\r\ncollected?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. What was your reason for doing it?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. To--well, the money she had collected was considerable, and\r\nmost people in their life don't accumulate that much money in their\r\nentire lifetime.\r\n\r\nWhat we were trying to do for her was to build enough of a--enough\r\ncapital to furnish her from the interest a steady income. And by\r\nkeeping the figure down figured it would increase.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. I don't want to put words in your mouth. Could you be a\r\nlittle more specific about your reason?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, so people would keep contributing to her cause.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And she was in accord with this policy of keeping the\r\npublic amount at a low figure so that people would contribute to her\r\ncause?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. I would like to revert to a point that you made this\r\nmorning to clear up the record. You said that you left your job at the\r\nSix Flags Inn Motel because of your obligations to Marina Oswald. Did\r\nyou leave the job voluntarily or were you fired?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I left voluntarily. I actually left on the 15th of\r\nDecember, and I had a week's vacation coming, they gave me that which\r\npaid me to the 1st of January.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. When you met Mrs. Oswald in late November and in your\r\nconversations with her at that time, did she discuss with you the fact\r\nof her husband's trip to Mexico?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Are you now----\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. She did at a later date, sometime in January before she\r\nwent to the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. When did you first learn of Lee Oswald's trip to Mexico?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I guess it was from newspaper accounts.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. When you read it in the newspapers did you ask Marina\r\nabout it?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. What prompted you to discuss with Marina in January the\r\nquestion of her knowledge about it?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Let's see--she told me when the FBI was questioning her\r\none day, she told me that they had information that he had attempted\r\nsuicide, and that particular day she didn't want to see the FBI at all,\r\nand she was a little bit unhappy with them and I just asked her what\r\nelse did she learn.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Who else was present at this conversation?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I don't think anybody.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Just you and Mrs. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Who was this who had attempted suicide, I didn't catch that?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. At what time?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. That was in Russia sometime before, I think before he met\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And she said she had heard this from the FBI or the FBI had\r\nasked her about it?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. The FBI had read, I think, in his manuscript that he had\r\nattempted suicide.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And they asked her about it?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. She didn't know that. Yes. And at that time I asked her if\r\nshe learned anything else, and she said no, but that they still didn't\r\nknow that she knew that he had gone to Mexico, and at that time we\r\nwere talking about the Commission, that general area of time, and I\r\nmentioned to be sure to tell the truth to the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you ask her why she had not revealed knowledge of her\r\ntrip--of her knowledge of Lee Oswald's trip to Mexico?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I can't recall exactly whether I did or not.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you ask her?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I have a recollection but I have no idea what was said.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you and she discuss the purpose of Lee Oswald's trip\r\nto Mexico?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you say you advised her to tell this Commission about\r\nthat trip to Mexico?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. When you were here and she testified did you inquire of\r\nher as to whether in fact she did tell this Commission about the trip\r\nto Mexico?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I inquired of John Thorne and he said that she had.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. But in connection with the Nixon incident, you indicated\r\nearlier in your testimony that you had not inquired of her as to\r\nwhether she had told this Commission about the Nixon incident.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you think that the Nixon incident was of less\r\nimportance than the Mexican trip?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, I didn't quite believe the Nixon incident.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you believe it now?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I don't know. I don't know if there is any corroboration\r\nother than her say so.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. It was because you had doubts about the actual existence\r\nof the incident that you didn't pursue with her the question as to\r\nwhether she should tell this Commission about it?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. I didn't tell her not to say anything about it. I\r\ndidn't mention it specifically at all. The only thing I told her to do\r\nwas to tell the Commission the truth in all cases.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. At the conclusion of each day's testimony while she was\r\nhere before this Commission did you discuss the nature of her testimony\r\nwith her?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. I asked her how the day went. And she would tell me,\r\n\"fine,\" and that was the end of it.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. But you did inquire specifically about the Mexico trip?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. Because I knew she lied about that to the FBI.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Are there any other incidents you knew she had lied about\r\nto the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. That is the only one?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you and Marina Oswald ever discuss the question of her\r\nhusband's rifle practice?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. The only time I recall that ever being asked of her was\r\nat the press conference here in Washington, and I never specifically\r\nasked her at all, whether he practiced.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you ever discuss with her the question of Lee Oswald's\r\nownership of a rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. When you discussed the General Walker incident with her,\r\ndid you discuss his ownership of a rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. The only thing, I think about the only thing I asked\r\nher about that was how he got there and how he got back.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. What did she say?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. She said he walked and took the bus.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And you didn't ask her what weapon he had shot at General\r\nWalker with?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. That was in the newspaper, it was a rifle. And there\r\nwere many things I didn't ask about because I was previously informed\r\nthrough the news or I thought I was anyway.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. You specifically, with regard to the rifle, you are\r\ntelling this Commission that you had no conversations with Marina\r\nOswald concerning her husband's practice with the rifle either in\r\nDallas or in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Let's see--I think I did discuss with her one time at the\r\nrifle range out in Grand Prairie was it, wherever it was, that the\r\nowner had seen Lee Harvey Oswald out there with a rifle, and he drove\r\nup in a car.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Who is \"they\"?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. The owner of the rifle range.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. You say they drove up in a car?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. He drove up in a car.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. The owner of the rifle range?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No; Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Drove to the rifle range in a car?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. And----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did he drive himself?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, this is a report from the rifle range owner who said\r\nhe had seen Lee Harvey Oswald there on numerous occasions practicing,\r\nand that he drove up in a car by himself. He always came by himself,\r\nand I did ask her if he could drive and she said no, definitely.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Where did you read this report or where did you hear about\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It was right after the start there, in the Dallas papers.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. This was something you read. This was not a personal\r\nconversation you had with the owner of the rifle range?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, it was a newspaper account.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Were there any other conversations you had with Mrs.\r\nOswald concerning rifle practice?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you have any conversations with her concerning Lee\r\nOswald's ability as a rifleman?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did Mrs. Oswald ever discuss with you the fears that she\r\nclaims to have had that Lee Oswald would attempt to kill a public\r\nfigure as a result specifically of the Walker incident?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, other than when she told me that she told him that\r\nif he tried anything similar to the Walker incident she would have\r\nhim arrested. And she never mentioned to me a particular figure that\r\nhe would do anything like that. She evidently had it though or she\r\nwouldn't have made the threat to him.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Other than the Nixon incident, and the Walker incident,\r\nMrs. Oswald never related to you any other specific incident with\r\nregard to the attempt to take the life of anyone?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Mrs. Oswald, Marina, ever indicate to you\r\nher feeling toward guns; did she ever indicate any apprehension about\r\nhaving one in the house?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Related to rifles, pistols?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I have a 22 rifle in the house, for instance. Of course,\r\nshe may never have seen it. But I don't believe the question ever came\r\nup at all.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. She never indicated to you that she had told Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald that she was apprehensive about his use of a gun or his\r\nhaving a gun in the household?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Martin, I would like to ask you whether Mrs. Oswald\r\never discussed with you any aspects of the life of Marina Oswald and\r\nLee Harvey Oswald while they were in Russia.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Let's see now--she mentioned one time to both my wife and\r\nI that Lee had gone to Moscow, I believe, and an old boy friend called\r\nher up and she went out with him while Lee was gone.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did she indicate to you at that time the purpose of Lee's\r\ntrip to Moscow?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did she indicate to you whether she had told Lee about her\r\ngoing out with this old boy friend?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. She said she did tell him.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. By the way, would you recall when Lee made this trip to\r\nMoscow?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, I don't think she mentioned the date at all. She may\r\nhave but I don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did she indicate in connection with this trip of Lee\r\nOswald to Moscow that she herself subsequently went to Moscow while he\r\nwas there?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. I think she said he was gone one day or one night and\r\ncame back the next day.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. So that on the basis of your recollection, if there was a\r\ntrip in which Lee Oswald went to Moscow and she joined him there this\r\nwas a different trip from the one you are talking about?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Just to make sure of this you say to the best of your\r\nrecollection she said he went there for one day and returned?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Can you think of any other aspects of their life in the\r\nSoviet Union that Marina discussed with you.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. He used to like her aunt. Now, which aunt I don't know.\r\nYes, I do. It is the aunt that is working as a secretary and her\r\nhusband is on a pension. She has an aunt and an uncle by blood.\r\n\r\nNow, the aunt's husband is on a pension, and the uncle's--The uncle is\r\na lieutenant colonel in the Soviet Army.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Now, the aunt and uncle that you say she liked very much,\r\nis this the aunt and uncle with whom she was living at the time she met\r\nLee Oswald or is this a different aunt and uncle?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. That was all very--always confusing to me because she\r\nwouldn't call the spouse of the aunt, for instance, her uncle, and I\r\ncouldn't tell all the time which party she was talking about.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. These were both relatives to Marina, therefore, they were\r\nnot married.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, no; they were not married to each other.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is what I mean, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. There were two couples, and the aunt in one couple and the\r\nuncle in the other couple. But she didn't refer to the opposite spouse\r\nas an aunt and uncle.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Does the name Berlov refresh your recollection any?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Berlov?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Marina ever indicate to you anything about her\r\neducation, what school she attended?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, just the school of pharmacy, and she compared her grade\r\nschool or our grade school, which is, I guess similar to our grade\r\nschool in high school or junior high, anyway.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. She only referred to the pharmacy training?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. As any special training she received?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But she did discuss that with you?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Not at length. Just stated the fact that she had finished\r\npharmacy school.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But she didn't discuss any other training or\r\nschooling of a special nature.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did she ever discuss any special training that Lee\r\nmight have had while he was in Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did she ever discuss Lee's employment while he was\r\nin Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Only that he was unhappy where he was working.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did she tell you where he worked, the kind of work\r\nhe was doing?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I don't know, I have an idea it was in a factory of some\r\nkind, whether she told me that or whether it was an assumption, I don't\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did she ever discuss their apartment, their living\r\nquarters in Minsk?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, she said she had a one-room apartment, and had a\r\nbalcony on it, and that as soon as the baby was born they were going to\r\nmove to a larger one. I questioned her about that because I understand\r\nit is quite difficult to get more than a one-room apartment in Russia\r\nand she said, well, Lee was an American and he could get things the\r\nRussians couldn't get.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did Mrs. Oswald give you the impression that in general\r\nshe and Lee Oswald had better treatment than other Russians?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, and actually her past life even before she met Lee\r\nseemed a little bit strange to me, going to the opera, taking vacations\r\nand holidays as she says. I understand it is quite expensive to go to\r\nthe opera, and she was making, what did she say, 45 rubles a month, and\r\nshe would take a girl friend with her when she went to the opera.\r\n\r\nNow, how much that cost, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you ever question her about her financial situation in\r\nRussia?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I asked her how she could afford it and she said she got\r\nby. She was living at home or with her aunt and uncle. So I imagine\r\ntheir expenses there weren't high.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did she mention any extra income which Lee Harvey Oswald\r\nmay have had apart from his job?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No; I asked her about that specifically because I had heard\r\nan account that he was supposed to be getting Western Union money\r\norders, and asked her about that. She didn't know what a Western Union\r\nmoney order was, for one thing, so I reworded the question and asked if\r\nhe was getting money from anyone else other than where he was working,\r\nand she said no.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. This was true of this life in the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, apparently.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did Marina ever discuss with you the uncle with whom she\r\nlived who was apparently a lieutenant colonel in the Soviet army?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No; except she didn't like him.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did she say why?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. She preferred her aunt, who has the husband on the\r\npension.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Can you search your memory at this point and tell this\r\nCommission anything that you have not yet told us about Marina's\r\nconversations with you concerning her life in the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Her aunt used to bring food and liquor home after parties\r\nhad at the government building where she was working. Other than\r\ntalking about--she pulled one tooth out before she came to the United\r\nStates. A tooth was either crooked or broken and she pulled the tooth\r\nout. That caused the other one to twist. I don't know what that was.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Marina ever indicate to you while she was in\r\nthe Soviet Union that she drank beer, wine, liquor?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Vodka.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When she came to the United States, you could\r\nobserve it, did she drink beer, wine, liquor of any kind?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. She drank, I guess she drank a bottle of beer every day,\r\nand occasionally she would drink some vodka.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But not a heavy drinker?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Martin, have you ever been curious about how Mrs.\r\nOswald was ever able to leave the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, I wasn't, until Don Levine brought up the subject. Of\r\ncourse, I have no idea what it entails to get into Russia or out of it\r\nas far as that is concerned.\r\n\r\nBut according to Mr. Levine, it is extremely difficult for people to\r\nget out of Russia, especially when they have had the training that\r\nMarina has had.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. By training you mean what?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Pharmacy. He said they spent quite a bit of money on her\r\ntraining, and he doesn't understand how she got out of Russia on such\r\nshort notice.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you ever ask this question of Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. She said that Lee arranged it, and that is all she would\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. She never discussed any other aspect of her departure from\r\nthe Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. Let's see, they were in Moscow, she waited a couple\r\nof days while he was, how did she put it, collecting money or getting\r\nmoney together to come over to the States. I have forgotten the name\r\nof the hotel they stayed in. She even remarked they had pancakes every\r\nmorning and she didn't like pancakes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. In terms of her official negotiations to leave the Soviet\r\nUnion, you asked her nothing other than the question that I have\r\nalready discussed with you?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, she said that Lee arranged everything.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. I would like to ask you a few questions now about some of\r\nthe individuals that Marina and Lee Harvey Oswald knew in Fort Worth\r\nand Dallas, and ask you in each case whether Marina Oswald discussed\r\nany of these individuals with you.\r\n\r\nThe first is George Bouhe.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I know the name but I don't think Marina has ever mentioned\r\nhim; Katya Ford has though.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Are you personally acquainted with George Bouhe?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Could you tell us what Katya Ford has told you about Mr.\r\nBouhe?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It was relating to Marina--I think Katya Ford and Bouhe are\r\nfriends, and they had been discussing Marina all the time she was in\r\nseclusion, and wondering what had happened to her, where she was. Now\r\nthis was after the news was out where she was.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Are you acquainted with----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Excuse me, by \"in seclusion\", you mean at the time she was\r\nwith you in your house?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, and the press didn't know where she was.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Are you acquainted with George De Mohrenschildt or his\r\nwife Jean De Mohrenschildt?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Have you ever discussed either George or Jean De\r\nMohrenschildt with Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Have you ever discussed George and Jean De Mohrenschildt\r\nwith anyone else?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you ever hear the name mentioned before?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. I think I would remember that name.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Are you personally acquainted with Peter Gregory?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I met him once, maybe twice, at the Inn. He was\r\ninterpreting for Marina, for the Secret Service, I believe, before Lee\r\nGopadze got there.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you know who he is?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I understand he is a geologist, and he also teaches Russian.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did Marina ever discuss either Peter Gregory or Paul\r\nGregory with you?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. She mentioned--I don't know which one.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. One is the father and one is a son.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I think it is the older gentleman that I met. She mentioned\r\nthat she liked him.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. The older gentleman?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. And I think she corresponded with him. I know she\r\ncorresponded with him.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you have any knowledge of Mr. Gregory's son?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Have you ever met him?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Not to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. You have had no conversations with anyone else about him?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. We were--I think John Thorne and I were talking about\r\nat sometime we may need an interpreter, and I mentioned his name in\r\nthat instance.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. That would be the elder Mr. Gregory?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. But nothing on Paul Gregory.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Nothing on Paul Gregory?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Are you aware of the fact that Paul Gregory is a student\r\nat the University of Oklahoma?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did Marina ever discuss with you the fact that she had\r\nhelped tutor the son of Peter Gregory?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Are you familiar with--strike that. Do you have any\r\npersonal acquaintanceship with Gary Taylor?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Have you ever heard the name of Gary Taylor?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Marina Oswald has never discussed that name with you?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you know Mrs. Elena Hall?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Elena Hall? No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Has Marina ever discussed her with you?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. The name John R. Hall, who is the husband of Mrs. Elena\r\nHall?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, it sounded a little familiar but I can't place anything\r\non it.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you know Mrs. Katherine Ford?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Could you tell us how you came to know her?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Let's see, she had contacted Marina a couple of times by\r\nletter, and----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. While she was staying at your home?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes--well, she sent the letter to Grand Prairie, the\r\nletters, Christmas cards, and I think two letters after that. So I\r\ncalled her and Marina wanted to, expressed a desire to, talk to her. So\r\nI called her and Marina talked to her on the phone. I think every time\r\nshe talked to her she talked nearly an hour.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In Russian or in English?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. In Russian.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was it on the telephone?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did Marina ever tell you the gist of these conversations?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did Marina ever relate to you whether she had ever lived\r\nin Mrs. Ford's home?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I believe she had for a very short time.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. You mean Marina related this to you?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I think Mrs. Ford told me that.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. How did you get this knowledge, from Marina or from Mrs.\r\nFord? Did you ever discuss this with Marina?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. I know Marina likes her home, I mean likes the house\r\nthat they live in.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you ever ask Marina how it came about that she was\r\nseparated from her husband and living at the home of Mrs. Ford?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did any of Marina's other Russian-speaking friends in the\r\nDallas-Fort Worth area write letters to her while she was at your home?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Mrs. Paine wrote at least once a week and----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Once a week?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. Marina did not answer, didn't answer any of the\r\nletters and didn't call her.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did Mrs. Paine attempt to reach Marina by phone?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, until I had my telephone number changed and then she\r\ncouldn't find the phone number so she came over to the house.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. What happened when she came to the house?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Nothing, I let her in the house and Marina and the children\r\nwere back in the den and the Secret Service men went back into the den,\r\nand I don't believe she knew that she was there.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was the change in number, did it have anything to do with\r\nMarina as objecting to receiving the calls?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. That was strictly because the press pressure.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The presence of the press?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. I would like to go back to this incident when Mrs. Paine\r\ncame to see Marina. You say Marina did not know that Mrs. Paine was\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, she knew it.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. She knew that Mrs. Paine was there?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Mrs. Paine didn't know that Marina was there.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. But Marina knew that Mrs. Paine was there?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did Marina see Mrs. Paine at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you talk to Marina at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, before and after.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. At the time Mrs. Paine was there did you personally tell\r\nMarina that Mrs. Paine wanted to see her?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I told her before Mrs. Paine came in the door that Mrs.\r\nPaine was here, and she said she didn't want to see her. She stayed in\r\nthe den, and Mrs. Paine was in the living room.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Then did you convey this message to Mrs. Paine yourself?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Who did?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, she came with the intention or for the purpose of\r\nbringing a package to Marina that she had received in the mail, and I\r\ndon't believe she knew that Marina was living there. I told her at that\r\ntime that because of security that Marina wasn't seeing anyone but I\r\ndon't believe she knew that Marina was at that address until later.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. When Mrs. Paine called your home prior to the change of\r\nphone, did you speak to Mrs. Paine?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, my wife did.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you recall the nature of the conversations between your\r\nwife and Mrs. Paine as reported to you?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, let's see, she called and asked for Marina or asked\r\nto get in touch with Marina. My wife gave me the number and I guess I\r\ncalled her back.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. You called Mrs. Paine back?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. A day or two later, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. What did you say to her?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I told her that under the present circumstances she just\r\ndidn't want to see anybody, and also the security on her didn't permit\r\nher to go out too far. That we could possibly arrange a meeting at some\r\nmiddle point later on.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Was Marina free to see anyone she wanted to see?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And the reason she didn't see Mrs. Paine was because she\r\ndidn't want to see Mrs. Paine?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. I asked her several times to call her, at least call\r\nMrs. Paine and tell her she didn't want to see her, and she just\r\nshrugged her shoulders and said she didn't want to talk to her.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did Marina ever tell you why she didn't want to talk to\r\nher?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. She said something about Mrs. Paine talking too much, and\r\nshe didn't like Mrs. Paine's children.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Were you aware at the time that Marina had lived with Mrs.\r\nPaine?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Were you aware at the time that Mrs. Paine had taken the\r\nOswald family to New Orleans and had----\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Gone to New Orleans and brought them back to Irving, Tex.?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, that is why I felt she owed Mrs. Paine something.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. What was Marina's attitude toward your comments?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. She just didn't want to talk to her.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you yourself ever meet Mrs. Paine?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Would you describe that meeting?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, the first time I met her was we went over to the\r\nPaine's house to pick up some of Marina's belongings.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Who is \"we\"?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. John Thorne and I.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you recall about when this was?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I guess it was about a week after she had moved in, maybe\r\nshorter, maybe sooner than that. There was not much said at all at that\r\nmeeting. Then when she came out to the house she talked at length, but\r\nit was----\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. There is another occasion when you say she came?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. When she came to my house.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. That was the same occasion that you referred to earlier\r\nwhen she came to pick up a package?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. To deliver a package.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. To deliver a package, I am sorry. Could you relate what\r\nhappened at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I was quite distracted by the children. It was rather a\r\nstiff meeting or conversation.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This was the meeting at Mrs. Paine's house?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, my house.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Your house?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Mrs. Paine brought, I think, a package and some food,\r\ncookies, things like that, for Marina, and----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Those are from Mrs. Paine to Marina, but the package was a\r\nthird----\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. The package came through the mail.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That you understand, but the cookies came from Mrs. Paine.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nI believe she brought some toys for the children. What the toys were,\r\nI don't recall. Her children were running back and forth through the\r\nliving room making quite a bit of noise.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Mrs. Paine's children?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. And I wasn't really paying too much attention to what\r\nshe was saying. I was wanting her to leave. I didn't ask her to leave\r\nbut I wasn't saying much to foster the conversation. Then she left in,\r\nI guess, 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. What did Mrs. Paine say to you?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Oh, boy----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was she disturbed, I mean was she annoyed, visibly annoyed,\r\nthat Marina wouldn't see her. She didn't know Marina was in the house,\r\nI realize that.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. She didn't know Marina was in the house. I am certain she\r\ndidn't.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. You mean her children were running around the house\r\nthough, weren't they?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Her children were running in the living room and dining\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But not into the den?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. But not into the den and kitchen.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you have a door on the den so you can close the\r\nden off?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. She talked mostly about generalities and she would\r\nlike to see Marina to make sure she is well taken care of, and so on.\r\nShe was concerned about her. And she came back after that time, she\r\ncame back once more. I wasn't there. My wife answered the door and\r\ndidn't invite her in.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. How long a trip is it from your house to Mrs. Paine's,\r\nroughly, a few miles?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, a good 20 miles.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. A good 20 miles?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Because it is 30 miles out to the Inn, and she lives about\r\n8 or 10 miles toward me from the Inn, so it is about 20 miles.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Your wife did not invite Mrs. Paine into the house at that\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Was this at Marina's urging?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. Mrs. Paine was quite upset at that--that is what Wanda\r\nsaid, she looked upset at that time.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. On this occasion, did Mrs. Paine know Marina was\r\nin the house?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, I don't believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did she ask where she was, specifically?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. She didn't ask?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. What was the purpose of her visit?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I don't believe--let's see, she may have brought something\r\nthat day, too. I don't recall whether she did or not. I know right\r\nafter that, the Civil Liberties Union got into it. Well, Mark Lane, was\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. You say right after that Mark Lane got into it?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Would you elaborate on that?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Mark Lane came to Dallas, and contacted John Thorne and I.\r\nWe met him at the Statler and talked to him at lunch, and he expressed\r\na desire to talk to Marina Oswald so that he could represent her\r\nhusband, defend her husband in a hearing, and we told him that we would\r\nrelay that information to her.\r\n\r\nSo we did, and she said that she didn't want to have any\r\nrepresentation. She didn't want any more----\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. You mean she didn't want any representation for Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, she didn't want any more to do about it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Can you recall the date of this visit by Mr. Lane?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was it in December or January?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It was in January, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And you transmitted Mr. Lane's message to Marina?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, and she said that she didn't want any representation\r\nfor Lee.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you tell her this in English?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, and explained it to her, and at that time she could\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. To your knowledge, did Marina ever meet Mr. Lane?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Not to my knowledge, no.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And you also related the Ruth Paine, second Ruth Paine,\r\nvisit to your home to something which you referred to as the American\r\nCivil Liberties Union business.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It was right after--these incidents happened rather\r\nclosely. The letter from the Civil Liberties Union--well, first we\r\nreceived a telephone call from the Civil Liberties Union wanting to see\r\nMarina Oswald.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Telephone call from Dallas or New York, or what?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. From Richardson, the same person who wrote the letter which\r\nyou have there. Do you have that?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. We do have. We are inventorying many of these documents of\r\nwhich the American Civil Liberties letter is one and we will introduce\r\nit at an appropriate time.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Richardson is a suburb of Dallas. This gentleman called,\r\nwhat was his name?\r\n\r\nMr. LEECH. I can't remember it.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Would it refresh your recollection if I mentioned the name\r\nOlds?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, Greg Olds. He called on the phone and wanted to see\r\nMarina Oswald, wanted to make sure she was being properly represented,\r\nthat she knew her rights, and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\nJohn Thorne talked to him, and told him that he represented Marina\r\nOswald, and that he was definitely sure that all her rights were being\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nThen I think there was another phone call from them still wanting to\r\nsee Marina Oswald, and I talked to Marina and she said well, she would\r\ntalk to him. So they arranged a meeting with a third party, I can't\r\nremember his name, who was a minister of some kind, and then Marina\r\nchanged her mind and said no, she didn't want to go at all, she didn't\r\nwant to talk to any of them. So then they wrote the letter. They wrote\r\na letter to her in Russian and sent one to me in English, one to John\r\nThorne in English, and I believe one to the Secret Service and one to\r\nthe FBI.\r\n\r\nMr. LEECH. Do you want to mention about their press releases at this\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. There were a number of press releases at that time also\r\nthat she was being held incognito and not able to----\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. You mean incognito or incommunicado?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Incommunicado.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Press releases by whom?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. The Civil Liberties Union, and so they sent this letter to\r\nher and she answered it with a two-page letter in Russian.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In Russian?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you have a copy of that two-page letter?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. She wrote it, put it in an envelope, put a stamp on it\r\nand I mailed it. I didn't open it or look in it in any way. And that\r\nseemed to be the end of it, but they still persisted they wanted to see\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And the reason Marina did not see them was entirely her\r\nown volition?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Her own.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. She never talked to you about what was in the letter?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, she said she just told them she didn't want to see them.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In two pages?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir; This was quoted, a portion of the letter was\r\nquoted, in the Worker.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I suggest, Mr. Chairman, that we get, if possible,\r\na copy of the original of that letter.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. You probably can get it from Greg Olds.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would you make a note of that. I think we should do that.\r\n\r\nThat was dated sometime in the middle of January?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I believe so. The letter you have--she wadded the letter\r\nup that was written to her in Russian and threw it away, and I got it\r\nback out, and asked her to go ahead and write them a letter so it would\r\nquiet them. So she said she would and she wrote a letter, I think,\r\nthat night, so it would be within a couple of days of the date of that\r\nletter, the English copy of which you have.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Chairman, if you would like, we could take a 3- or\r\n4-minute recess and I could get the American Civil Liberties Union\r\nletter to Marina Oswald and introduce it at this time for the sake of\r\nclarity in the record.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Good. It is a good time for a breather.\r\n\r\n(Short recess.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right, gentlemen, the Commission will be in order.\r\n\r\nYou are familiar with, Mr. Dulles, you are familiar with, the hearing\r\nup to date. You go right ahead and preside, if you will.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Mr. Redlich will you go right ahead with your questions?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. I believe Congressman Ford, you said you wanted to ask\r\nyour questions prior to your leaving.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you wish to have that letter entered as an\r\nexhibit at this point before I ask several questions?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. The witness has produced before this Commission a letter\r\nwhich I now mark Commission Exhibit No. 331 on the Dallas Civil\r\nLiberties Union stationery, addressed to Mr. John Thorne, James Martin,\r\nMr. Sorrels, Secret Service, Mrs. Lee H. Oswald, and the Federal Bureau\r\nof Investigation.\r\n\r\nI ask that it be introduced in evidence.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Any objection?\r\n\r\nMr. LEECH. No.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It will be introduced.\r\n\r\n(The letter referred to was marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 331 and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Have you seen it?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Chief Justice, we have introduced that because\r\njust prior to the recess we were discussing it and Congressman Ford\r\nindicated he had to leave I believe and I wanted to ask some questions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Go ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask one question on this letter for clarification?\r\nIt is my understanding it is your belief that Mrs. Oswald received a\r\ncopy of this letter in Russian?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, she received a letter on this letterhead written in\r\nRussian. Now whether it was an exact copy, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. About the length of this letter as far as you could tell?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. At about the same time?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, it was the same day.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That was the letter she crumpled up and put in the\r\nwastepaper basket?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But you retrieved it from the wastepaper basket, did you\r\nnot say?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir, and asked her to answer it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Where is that copy that you retrieved from the wastepaper\r\nbasket?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Maybe reassigned to the wastepaper basket?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It may have been, yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I believe that was the letter that Mr. Redlich\r\nindicated he would get a copy from the Dallas Chapter of the American\r\nCivil Liberties Union.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Her answer is what he wanted to get.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. I think Congressman Ford is right. We might be able to get\r\nboth a copy of the letter and their answer.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Their statement in this letter is the English of the\r\nRussian translation which they sent to her. I think it would be\r\nadequate, wouldn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It seems to me it would be adequate for our purposes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. We will contact the Dallas Division on that.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Marina testified here, and she has said elsewhere,\r\nthat based on the facts as she now knows them, she believes that Lee\r\nwas guilty of the assassination of President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was that her attitude when you first met her?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, when I first met her, we didn't converse very well at\r\nall. There was lack of communication because of the language barrier,\r\nand I didn't discuss it with her probably until the latter part of\r\nDecember, although she was speaking fairly good English by the 15th of\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you first discussed it with her, what was her\r\nattitude?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, she said she thought he was crazy.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But did she indicate when you first discussed the\r\nquestion of guilt or not being guilty, what was her attitude?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. She thought he was guilty.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The first time you discussed the matter?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did she indicate why?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. I asked her why, and she said it was just a feeling.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. At that point had she----\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. A woman's feeling.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. At that point had she been given or shown the\r\nevidence that had been accumulated by various agencies of the Federal\r\nGovernment?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I don't know. I assume she had through the FBI. The FBI\r\nwere showing her pictures and numerous things. I was not in on any of\r\nthe questioning at all.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Had she read the papers or had them read to her as far as\r\nyou know at that period?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Some of them, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Newspapers, I mean.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. From that first conversation you had with her\r\nabout this matter, the guilt of Lee Harvey Oswald, she has never\r\nchanged her mind?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, and I have never heard her say anything other than he\r\nwas guilty.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you ever discuss with Marina the conversation\r\nshe had with Lee Harvey Oswald at the Dallas police station the day he\r\nwas apprehended or the day following. Or at any time prior to his death?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. The only time she said anything about it was that he told\r\nher not to worry and to make sure and get the--get June a pair of shoes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. She told you that is what he said to her?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. That is what he said, yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There was nothing extraordinary that she told you\r\nabout the conversation?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Other than what you have indicated?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. He said not to worry. Everything would be all right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you ever ask her about this conversation\r\nthat she had with Lee Harvey Oswald while he was at the Dallas police\r\nstation?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. As her manager, as the manager of Marina, did you\r\nhave anything to do with the change of her appearance? Many people\r\nhave said to me the first picture they saw of her and the subsequent\r\npictures they saw of her she was wearing different kind of clothes. She\r\nhad a different hair-do, and so forth. Did you have anything to do with\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What was the purpose of that?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Just to change her general appearance so she wouldn't be\r\nrecognized when she went out.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did she agree to this, was she willing to do it?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. She didn't like her haircut particularly.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. She liked the previous way it was?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How about the change in clothes, the type that she\r\nwore?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, of course, that was for the better.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did she like it?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. She liked the clothes, yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is all.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. She tried makeup but that didn't work, because she couldn't\r\nstand makeup.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. We previously asked you, Mr. Martin, about various people\r\nthat Marina Oswald knew in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and you have\r\nindicated the extent to which you knew them personally and the extent\r\nto which they had contacted Marina Oswald during the time she was in\r\nyour home.\r\n\r\nAre there any other friends of Marina Oswald's rather than those I have\r\nasked you about that you--who attempted to contact her while she was\r\nliving at your home?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Ilya, I believe it is Mamatav or Mamantov--he is of the\r\nDallas Police Department and he has asked of her how she is.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Has he ever seen her, to the best of your knowledge other\r\nthan in an official capacity?\r\n\r\n(At this point, Congressman Ford left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, one time when we went to Sears, Sears Roebuck in\r\nDallas, and walked into the store he was walking and practically ran\r\ninto her, and they said hello and passed the time of day and he left.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. There were no other friends of hers that you know about\r\nwho attempted to see her or call her while she was living at your home?\r\n\r\nOther than those we have already discussed on the record? If I\r\nmentioned the name of Mr. or Mrs. Teofil Meller--the first name is\r\nTeofil, the last name is Meller.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, there was someone that called the office one day and\r\nhad a rather odd name, was that Meller, and said that Marina wanted to\r\ntalk to her, and we took it just for a crank call. She wouldn't leave\r\nthe number or anything like that. I am not sure whether that was Meller.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. There was no telephone number involved.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. You have discussed at length the attempt of Ruth Paine to\r\nsee Mrs. Oswald. Did Mike Paine ever attempt to see Mrs. Oswald while\r\nshe was living at your home?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Have you ever talked to Michael Paine?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. When we went over to get the clothes, for instance, he\r\nstood back--I don't believe he said anything at all. It was a very odd\r\nsituation. He was helping us move things but he didn't say anything.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did Marina ever discuss Michael Paine with you?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Only Ruth Paine but not Michael Paine?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. She said they were separated.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Martin, did Marina ever discuss with you her husband's\r\ndesire to go to Cuba?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. She said that he had wanted to go to Cuba because he\r\nwanted--because he wasn't happy in Russia and he wasn't happy in the\r\nUnited States and then she said he wouldn't be happy in Cuba either.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did she ever discuss with you a plan to hi-jack a plane?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did she ever indicate what steps he was taking to get to\r\nCuba?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. Not at all.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you have any knowledge at all of any plans he was\r\nmaking to get to and live in Cuba?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Ford has asked you about the conversations which\r\nMarina had with Lee Oswald at the Dallas Police Station on November 23\r\nand you have replied. I would like to ask you about any--your knowledge\r\nabout any conversation which Robert Oswald had with Lee Oswald while he\r\nwas in the custody of the Dallas Police prior to his death?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I have no knowledge at all of that.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. You have never had any conversations with Robert Oswald\r\nconcerning his conversations with Lee Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Have you ever talked to Mrs. Marguerite Oswald concerning\r\nany conversations which she had with her son while he was in the\r\ncustody of the Dallas police?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Have you had any conversations at all with Mrs. Marguerite\r\nOswald concerning the facts surrounding the assassination of President\r\nKennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, I don't think any direct conversation, I mean between\r\nshe and I. I was present at times out there at the Inn when she was\r\ntalking to this person or that person. But I don't believe I have had\r\nany direct conversation with her at all.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did Mrs. Marguerite Oswald ever discuss with you an\r\nincident concerning a photograph which was supposed to have been shown\r\nto her by agents of the FBI on November 23, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, I have heard that through news media but that is the\r\nonly place I heard it.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. You have no direct knowledge of that incident yourself.\r\nDid Marina Oswald ever discuss that incident with you?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did Marina Oswald ever discuss with you her\r\nmother-in-law's allegations that Lee Oswald was acting as an agent of\r\nthe United States Government?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. She mentioned only one incident where the FBI came\r\nto their house when they were in Oak Cliff, and they took him down\r\nto the car, I believe he was about ready to sit down to dinner when\r\nthey arrived, and they took him down to the car and talked to him, and\r\nMarina was upset because dinner was spoiling, and I think that is the\r\nonly reference she has made to anything like that.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. She has never discussed with you the specific claims of\r\nMarguerite Oswald in that respect?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. In the course of your conversations with Marina Oswald or\r\nin the course of the preparation of any stories or releases on Mrs.\r\nOswald's behalf have you ever discussed with Mrs. Oswald the events of\r\nNovember 21 and the morning of November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Could you relate those conversations to us?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. He came home Thursday night, which was unusual.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Just so the record is clear, I hope you are relating to us\r\nnow what Marina Oswald has related to you and not what you have read in\r\nany publication.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. And, let's see, this was sometime in December that she was\r\ntelling me this--no, I remember when it was, when she was moving from\r\nthe Inn to my home.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. By the Inn you mean----\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. The Inn of the Six Flags. She was in the back seat and Leon\r\nGopadze was in the front seat talking with her, and she told him that\r\nhe had come home Thursday night and that----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In Russian?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. This was a conversation in Russian?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. Lee translated it for me, Gopadze translated it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Afterwards or as it took place.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. As it took place, well, it was immediately afterwards, and\r\nshe made a comment that he had left his wedding band on the dresser, I\r\nthink, and she got up the next morning she found his wedding band on\r\nthe dresser, which was strange.\r\n\r\nNow, that is the only thing that relates to that period that I have\r\nheard her say. Now, I didn't actually hear her say that.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. You have had no other conversations with her with regard\r\nto the period of November 21 and the morning of November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you have any knowledge of the story which Marina Oswald\r\nprepared in Russian and which she has sent to this Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Could you state the extent of your knowledge?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I knew it was written, and written by her, and that is\r\nabout the extent of it.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Was it ever translated for you?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, we have part of it translated, a portion of it.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Are there any parts of that story which you now believe to\r\nbe inaccurate?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, I don't have the whole thing translated, but I think\r\neverything that is translated, I have no reason to doubt.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you assist Marina Oswald in the preparation for her\r\ntelevision appearance in January on CBS television?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Are there any portions of that interview which you now\r\nbelieve to be inaccurate in any respect?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. We set a format for CBS to use, specific questions,\r\nand Marina was not prompted as to the answers to give. Those were\r\nimpromptu. But we went over the ones with her off the camera, and asked\r\nher the questions so that she would understand them, and then she\r\nanswered them, and the second time she did it on camera.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. To the best of your knowledge and recollection those\r\nanswers were accurate?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. I can't remember them. But none of them struck me as\r\nbeing----\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Apart from the newspaper clippings which we went through\r\nthis morning and afternoon, are you familiar with any other narrative\r\nprepared by or for Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Prepared by or for?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. You mean other than newspaper articles?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Other than the newspaper articles which we discussed this\r\nmorning and this afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Life magazine.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you have anything to do with the recent story in Life\r\nmagazine?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, we had nothing on that other than the picture. Time\r\nmagazine, she was interviewed for Time magazine.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. When was that?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Saturday--Friday--she was here in Washington.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. If I may refresh your recollection, she completed her\r\ntestimony before this Commission at approximately 5:30 on Thursday,\r\nFebruary 6.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, I believe it was Friday. We held a press conference\r\non Friday afternoon, and I think it was Friday night then.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. It would be sometime after the completion of her testimony\r\nis that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Were you with her during the course of that interview?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It must have been Thursday night. It was Thursday night\r\nbecause Secret Service was still with her.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. You believe this interview took place on Thursday night?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. That would be February 6?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Were you with her during the course of this interview?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Part of the time. I left John Thorne and Marina and the\r\nTime reporter at the table. June was restless, and I was walking her\r\naround the restaurant.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Have you read the interview?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Are there any portions of it which you now believe to be\r\ninaccurate, to the best of your recollection?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I don't think so. I would have to re-read it to make it\r\ndefinite, make a definite statement on it.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. On the basis of conversations which you had during the\r\ncourse of the testimony of Marina Oswald before this Commission and on\r\nthe basis of conversations which you have had subsequent to that time,\r\ndo you have any opinion concerning the truthfulness of the testimony\r\nwhich she presented before this Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. I think primarily she is truthful, and I think that\r\nunder oath she would tell the truth.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Are you still Mrs. Oswald's business representative?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. According to the contract, yes. According to my contract\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Have you received any communication from her which raises\r\nquestions as to whether you are still her business representative?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Are we really concerned with that?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Chairman, I intend to ask the witness why he was\r\ndischarged in terms of whether it had anything to do with any business\r\nnegotiations or anything to do with the testimony of Mrs. Oswald before\r\nthis Commission.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You can ask him if it has anything to do with her\r\ntestimony. We are not interested in her business affairs.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. I merely wanted to establish the fact of----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. This thing can go on interminably with all this minutia\r\nand things that don't bear on what we are here to find out, whatever\r\nhis business relations are with Mrs. Oswald, it seems to me is his\r\nbusiness and not ours.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did Mrs. Oswald's attempt to terminate the relationship\r\nwith you relate in any way to her testimony before this Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. There was no reason given.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did it relate in any way, in your opinion, to any\r\ninformation which you may have given to anyone else with regard to\r\nyour knowledge of the facts concerning the assassination of President\r\nKennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you know Jack Ruby?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Would you tell us about your association with him?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, it is a very minor association. I had been working in\r\nthe Statler Hotel in Dallas as assistant manager for maybe six months\r\nbefore I met him, and met him through some of the other people in the\r\nhotel.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What year was this?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. About 1955.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I just want to get the general area.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. 1955 or 1956. And as a club manager, I was club manager\r\nin Dallas also, and didn't associate with him at all, even on a\r\nbilateral communication through the clubs. But it was just a nodding\r\nacquaintance, you might say. I knew him by his first name. He knew me\r\nby my first name and we spoke when we saw each other and I think I have\r\nbeen in his place twice.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you recall the approximate dates of those visits?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Let's see, once in 1962. I had some gentlemen from New\r\nOrleans with me. They were visiting Dallas on business at the Inn of\r\nthe Six Flags, and they wanted to see the Carousel.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is what you mean by his place?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. So I called Jack Ruby and asked if it would be all\r\nright if I brought them down. We stayed approximately an hour and a\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\nThe other time was during the daytime, let's see, as it was then, I\r\nhad--I was walking in that area and just stopped in to say hello. The\r\nclub was closed at that time, not closed for business but it was before\r\nopening hours.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Those are the only times you have been in Jack Ruby's\r\nbusiness establishment?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you consider yourself a friend of his?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. An acquaintance.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Have you gone out socially?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. He came out to the Inn one time with some little\r\ngimmick. It is called a Detwist Board. It is quite a piece of plywood\r\nabout like this with a round plate on the bottom of it, seated in ball\r\nbearings and you are supposed to stand on this thing to twist, and came\r\nout to ask me to see who to ask at the park to merchandise it, the Six\r\nFlags over Texas Amusement Park, and I told him. Now, whether he went\r\nover there or not, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. I understand that you have had a conversation with an aid\r\nof General Walker concerning the General Walker incident.\r\n\r\nWould you tell the Commission about that?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. They contacted us----\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Who is \"they\"?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. General Walker's aide, Mr. Moore or Morse, a tall thin\r\ngentleman, about 55 or 60, and wanted actually an interview with Marina\r\nwhich we didn't think was necessary.\r\n\r\nThey came out to John Thorne's office and we sat and talked. They were\r\nof the opinion--what they were trying to do was find out who else was\r\ninvolved--this was right after the announcement was made in the paper\r\nabout Lee Oswald shooting at Walker. They were trying to find out who\r\nelse was involved because General Walker is still in fear of his life.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. This was some time before the 22d.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, it was after.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. After November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir. This was after the announcement was made in the\r\npaper that----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. That Lee Oswald had attacked him.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The actual attack was in April. This was after the\r\nnewspaper announcement.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. After the newspaper announcements that Lee had tried to\r\nkill him which was after the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. And they just wanted verification actually that or to try\r\nto get verification as to how many people were involved, and we told\r\nthem that there was just one person involved.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. At the time did you ask Marina about this?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And this is what she told you?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The persons involved in the Walker incident?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. She said that Lee did it alone without any help. There\r\nwas no one with him.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Martin, I have at this time no further questions other\r\nthan those which may be suggested by a perusal of the records which you\r\nhave forwarded to this Commission.\r\n\r\nAs we indicated in the brief recess earlier, Mr. Dulles is able to be\r\nhere at 9 o'clock this evening, and I would envisage then a very brief\r\nsession at which time your testimony would be completed.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Are there any questions that anyone would like to ask of\r\nMr. Martin at this time?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Would you like to ask your client any questions?\r\n\r\nMr. LEECH. No. I am not going to make that mistake.\r\n\r\n(Laughter.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I have no questions. I will reserve them for tonight. I\r\ndon't think I have any further questions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Rhyne, do you have any questions you would like to\r\nask. Mr. Rankin, are you through for the day?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Until 9 o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well then, gentlemen, we will adjourn until 9 o'clock.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 5:15 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvening Session\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF JAMES HERBERT MARTIN RESUMED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission reconvened at 9:20 p.m.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The Committee will come to order.\r\n\r\nWill you continue with the testimony?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Thank you, Mr. Dulles.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin, at our last session I asked you whether you knew Jack Ruby,\r\nand you replied that you did. You indicated the brief contact that you\r\nhave had with him and the two times, I believe, that you have been to\r\nhis business establishment?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Apart from your own personal contact with Jack Ruby, do\r\nyou have any other information about him and his activities which you\r\nwould like to present before this Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, nothing that I definitely know about him. It is just he\r\nis a city character. He is very friendly to everyone.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Please understand I am not asking you for rumors or that\r\ntype of thing.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, I know. Well, just what I know of him, he seems very\r\nfriendly to everyone, and he is always around. You are liable to see\r\nhim anywhere.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Has he ever been to the motel that you have?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, I mentioned that.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. He brought that twist board out there one time.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Never been there as a guest?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. I hand you a copy of an invoice for a Revere recorder and\r\na 1,200-foot reel of recording tape, and ask you if you have ever seen\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. That is a tape recorder that I rented and recorded\r\nthe----\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. I will ask you about it shortly. I would just like to know\r\nif you are familiar with it.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Chairman, I am marking this as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n332, and ask that it be admitted in evidence.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Any objection?\r\n\r\nMr. LEECH. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The tape recorder and tape invoice referred to were marked\r\nCommission's Exhibit No. 332 for identification and received in\r\nevidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Martin, I hand you Commission Exhibit No. 332, and\r\nask you to tell the Commission the conditions under which this invoice\r\narose?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. We had Marina's manuscript interpreted by Ilya Mamantov,\r\nand this was part of it. He was only able to interpret about half of it.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. He interpreted it and put it on tape?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. And we recorded that on tape as he interpreted it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. How do you mean interpreted?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. He read it in English?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Oh, I see, translated it.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. From Russian into English?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. When I asked you this afternoon about your knowledge as to\r\nthe accuracy of that story, I take it your reply was based upon this\r\ntranslation?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And this only encompasses about half of the entire story,\r\nis that right?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It is more than half, it is about 15 pages, I guess.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did she consult with you at all in the preparation of that\r\nstory?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And there is nothing on this tape other than the English\r\ntranslation of that Russian story?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. That is true.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do we have that translation as well as the copy of the\r\noriginal?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Yes, Mr. Chairman, we have the original in Russian and\r\nthen it was translated by Mr. Gopadze, of the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Actually our translation is very poor. He was not able to\r\ntranslate properly into English a lot of the phrases.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Who is \"he,\" Illa? Isn't that Ilya, by the way?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I am not sure.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is generally the Russian, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It might be.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. But he is professor at SMU. He has a list of titles that\r\nlong. He is very well thought of. I think he works for Sun Oil Company,\r\nand is a well-respected individual. His wife and his mother, I believe,\r\nteach Russian also. I think his mother taught Mrs. Paine a good deal of\r\nher Russian.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Martin, I would like to show you Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 325 which was introduced earlier today. Mr. Leech, I believe you\r\nhave a photostat of this. If you could hand it to me during the course\r\nof this questioning. I would appreciate it.\r\n\r\nMr. LEECH. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Thank you.\r\n\r\nCould you tell the Commission what this document purports to state, and\r\nthen I will ask you about individual items.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. These are contracts that we have made both in writing and\r\nverbally for Marina Oswald's right, her story rights.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And the first item appearing on Commission Exhibit No. 325\r\nis a contract with Texitalia Films.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Would you describe the terms and conditions of that\r\ncontract?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Texitalia Films is planning a 60-minute technicolor\r\ndocumentary to start. They will pay $75,000 for World-Wide movie and\r\nthe TV rights.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Excuse me, is this a documentary of Marina's life?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. Any movie or television appearances Marina would be\r\npaid $7,500 plus expenses for each appearance. Then for each personal\r\nappearance, for instance, the film opens in St. Louis on such and such\r\na date and they would like for her to be there to make a personal\r\nappearance for the showing, the opening of the film, she would receive\r\n$1,500 plus expenses for each public appearance of that nature.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And this contract according to this exhibit was signed on\r\nFebruary 11, 1964?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LEECH. By her?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, by me acting for her.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. By you acting on behalf of Mrs. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, in accordance with my contract with her.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. The second item appearing here is a contract with Life\r\nmagazine. Would you tell the Commission about that?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Life magazine purchased the rights, North American rights\r\non a photograph of Lee Harvey Oswald with a rifle and pistol, primarily\r\nfor their use on a cover issue.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is what appeared on the recent cover issue, I guess,\r\nit was 2 weeks ago.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nNow, that $5,000 has been paid. We have the $5,000 in an escrow account.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you actually have in your possession the photograph, a\r\ncopy of which appeared on the cover of Life magazine?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Could you tell us how this contract was consummated, in\r\nview of the fact that Life magazine apparently printed on its cover a\r\nphotograph which you never possessed?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. They knew the photographs belonged to Marina. They have a\r\ncommon law copyright, and the only way they could legally use the film\r\nis to purchase the rights from Marina.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did Life magazine indicate to you where they obtained the\r\nphotograph?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Have you had conversations with other publications\r\nconcerning that photograph?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. I made the contact with the London Daily Mirror\r\nfor the purchase of the British Commonwealth rights on that same\r\nphotograph, and they guaranteed $2,200 plus 50-50 split on what they\r\nsold in the Commonwealth. It was restricted to the Commonwealth only.\r\n\r\nHowever, the London Daily Mail came out with the photograph prior to\r\nthe Mirror, and I was informed by Mr. Weggand of the London Daily\r\nExpress that the Detroit Free Press had sold this photograph to the\r\nLondon Daily Mail for $500.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you have any idea how the Detroit Free Press obtained\r\nthis photograph?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. I talked to Ken Murray, who I was informed was the\r\nattorney for the Detroit Free Press.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Where did you talk to him?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. At his home in Detroit.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. By phone?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. By telephone. And he stated that the photograph was public\r\nproperty, and not covered under common law copyright. I asked him where\r\nhe got the photo, and he said he got it at the same place as Life did,\r\nthrough a leak in the Commission. I talked to Life magazine attorney--I\r\ncan't remember his name. It is a very odd name. It begins with an \"S\".\r\nNow, Murray said that Life had informed him that they had gotten it\r\nfrom a leak through the Commission, and I contacted Life and he denied\r\nsaying anything of the sort to Murray.\r\n\r\nHowever, Murray insisted that that is where he got that and he figured\r\nit was public domain.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. At the start of today's testimony when you mentioned\r\nthe possibility of a leak with regard to this photograph, something\r\nthat you said prior to the actual start of hearings, Mr. Rankin and I\r\ncommented on that assertion.\r\n\r\nWould you tell the Commission what we said?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. That there was definitely not a leak in the Commission, and\r\nthat you would certainly find out what Murray was talking about.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you talk to an editor of the Detroit Free Press with\r\nregard to this photograph?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I called at night. It was at night, and I asked for the\r\nnews editor. He was not in, so I talked to a reporter, and he couldn't\r\nsay anything about it. He referred me to Ken Murray and gave me his\r\nhome telephone number.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. The next item on Commission Exhibit No. 325 has reference\r\nto Stern Magazine.\r\n\r\nWould you tell the Commission about that, please?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Stern Magazine we have been working with since the middle\r\nof December. They have been quite patient actually. For $12,500 they\r\nwanted Marina's memoirs and photographs, available photographs for use\r\nin Germany and Italy only. They wanted exclusive use in those two\r\ncountries. Then they would endeavor to sell these same memoirs and\r\npictures to other European countries, limiting it only to European\r\ncountries, and take a 30 percent commission on any sales that they\r\nmade, the remaining 70 percent going to Marina.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Has this contract been signed?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you know when it was signed? Can you approximate the\r\ndate?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I confirmed it by wire to them. It is in the exhibits.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. We have not introduced----\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. You haven't come to that yet.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. We do not intend to introduce the specific documents into\r\nthe record, just this summary.\r\n\r\nMr. LEECH. Give him an approximate date.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. You say it was confirmed by telegram.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, it was confirmed by telegram to Spiegelberg.\r\n\r\nMr. LEECH. When?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. In New York. December 16 at 2:45 p.m.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. The next item on Commission Exhibit No. 325 also refers to\r\nStern Magazine, an item of $2,650.\r\n\r\nCould you comment on that?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. This was a recent development wherein since they could not\r\nsend an author in to talk to Marina, they purchased seven photographs\r\nfor a total of $2,650, to take the memoirs later.\r\n\r\nHowever, they will not hold off the memoirs forever.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. These seven photographs are photographs of what?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Of Marina and Lee Harvey Oswald together and separate.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. These were photographs which were not turned over to the\r\nDallas police?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. They were photographs that we were given prints of by\r\nthe FBI. The FBI sent prints of these photographs to us.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Am I correct in assuming that all of the photographs which\r\nwere in the possession of Marina Oswald and Lee Harvey Oswald, either\r\nin his apartment or in the Paine's apartment, were turned over to the\r\nDallas police?\r\n\r\nIs that right?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. As far as I know.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. To the best of your knowledge?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And that any photographs which you have and which have\r\nbeen the basis of any contract are copies which were made available to\r\nyou by some law enforcement authority?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. Now, there was a check, there was a $250 cash down\r\npayment made on this $2,650. Then a check for $2,400; the check was\r\nstopped, payment on the check was stopped because of a letter written\r\nby William McKenzie saying that I had no authority to sign any\r\ncontracts whatsoever for Marina, and that if they did use anything that\r\nI had sold them, litigation would follow immediately. So consequently\r\nthey stopped payment on the check. I still have the check. It is still\r\nattached to the letter that was sent with it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask who is that check made out to?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Made out to me.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. To you as agent?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Or to you just in your name?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I think it is just made out to me.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I don't know if it is important.\r\n\r\nMr. LEECH. You go ahead and I'll find it.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Under the contract all checks were supposed to be made\r\npayable to me. Then I would deduct my fee and forward the balance to\r\nMarina.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. The next item on Commission Exhibit No. 325 refers to\r\nMeredith Press.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. The Meredith Press is a book publisher with their main\r\noffice in Des Moines, Iowa. I had talked with Mr. Ted Purdy at great\r\nlength and on numerous occasions by phone. We had negotiated world\r\nbook rights for Marina Oswald's story. For this Meredith Press would\r\npay a $25,000 advance to her. Then on the first printing would be a 10\r\npercent commission of the retail price of the book.\r\n\r\nOn the second printing would be 12-1/2 percent commission, and on the\r\nthird and succeeding printings it would be 15 percent commission.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, the commissions were to be deducted from the advance.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And this was to be her life story?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Had you discussed with Marina at all the contents of this\r\nbook? Had you started making any preparations for writing?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. I am not a writer, and wouldn't know the first thing\r\nto do about a book. But we had negotiated with one writer, Isaac Don\r\nLevine, who Meredith Press felt would be the best writer available for\r\nthis type of book because of the Russian attachment.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. When you told us this morning of your initial concern over\r\nthe Nixon shooting incident, did it relate to these various agreements\r\nthat you have been working on concerning the sale of Marina Oswald's\r\nstory?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Did it relate to them?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. How do you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Were you concerned about the publicity, the effect of the\r\npublicity of the Nixon incident on these various agreements which you\r\nwere negotiating at the time?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. As a matter of fact, it would enhance the price of it.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the Post magazine, the Saturday Evening Post, said that\r\nthey would like to buy American serial rights if there was something in\r\nMarina's story that the Commission did not know.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. When did they tell you this?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Around the first of the year I guess.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Around the first of the year. Did Marina know about this?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. This is the Saturday Evening Post you are talking about?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. I talked to a Mr. Black.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And the Saturday Evening Post said to you that they would\r\nbuy the serial rights provided there was some information which would\r\nnot be known to the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. I told them there was no realm that would apply, and\r\nwe closed negotiations.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And you say you didn't relate this fact at all to Marina\r\nOswald?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. These negotiations with the Post.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Was there in fact to the best of your knowledge material\r\nwhich she did not in fact relate to this Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Not to my knowledge other than the Nixon affair.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And were you aware at the time she completed her testimony\r\nhere that she had not related this information to the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Was there any connection between her failure to tell the\r\nCommission of the Nixon incident and the negotiations, the temporary\r\nnegotiations that you had had with the Saturday Evening Post?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, none whatsoever. That was closed off at least 30 days\r\nbefore she testified.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Was there any attempt on your part or anyone acting on\r\nMarina Oswald's part that you know of to negotiate the sale of the\r\ninformation concerning the Nixon shooting incident?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, not to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. When Marina--did Marina ever give you an explanation for\r\nwhy she did not tell the Commission about the Nixon incident?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. I have never talked to her about that other than the\r\nfirst time that she told me about it. I asked John Thorne if she had\r\nmentioned it. I didn't discuss it with her.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And since Marina Oswald's return from Washington after\r\nhaving testified here, you say you have never discussed the Nixon\r\nincident with Marina Oswald in any way?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. I probably would have had there been sufficient time.\r\nOf course, she left my home the following day after she got back from\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. When you say you probably would have, in what way?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, since she didn't mention it to the Commission, I feel\r\nthe Commission should know about it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you know at this time she had not mentioned it to the\r\nCommission?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I asked John Thorne.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Oh, you asked John Thorne?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. What did John Thorne say?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Said she had not mentioned it.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you ask John Thorne why she had not mentioned it?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did John Thorne offer any information as to why she had\r\nnot mentioned it?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you know whether John Thorne had urged her to mention\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. John Thorne was aware of the Nixon incident prior to\r\nMarina Oswald's appearance before this Commission, was he not?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Because you had apparently told him about that shortly\r\nafter you learned about it in January.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you discuss the Nixon incident with Robert Oswald\r\nafter Marina Oswald's appearance before this Commission in February?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. You had not?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I don't know if I discussed it with him prior to the\r\nCommission's testimony or not. I may or I may not have. I don't know. I\r\ndon't know whether I mentioned it to him or not.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Coming back to Commission Exhibit No. 325, the next item\r\nunder London Daily Mirror, am I correct in assuming that this is, that\r\nthis item refers to the rifle photo which you discussed earlier in your\r\ntestimony tonight?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you have anything to add with regard to that rifle\r\nphoto that you have not already told us?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you discuss with Marina Oswald at any time this rifle\r\nphoto and the circumstances under which it was taken.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I asked her at one time why he wanted a photograph taken of\r\nthat type, and she said she didn't know. He just wanted pictures taken\r\nthat way.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did she tell you when this photograph was taken in\r\nrelationship to any other incidents such as the General Walker incident\r\nor the Richard Nixon incident?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did you know where the photograph was taken?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I don't know, I don't even know if it was in Oak Cliff or\r\nnot. I have an idea that it was in Oak Cliff but I don't know whether I\r\nknow that or whether I have read it.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. When you say Oak Cliff, some of us don't live in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It is a suburb of Dallas, a section of Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Are you referring to the area where the Neely Street house\r\nwas located?\r\n\r\nTo refresh your recollection, Mr. Martin, the Oswalds lived in two\r\nplaces in Dallas. One was on Elsbeth Street and the other on Neely. Are\r\nthey both in Oak Cliff?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, Elsbeth Street is right around the corner from Neely\r\nStreet, I believe they lived in an apartment on Elsbeth.\r\n\r\nIt was a group of apartments in one building, and on Neely Street, I\r\nthink, that was similar to a duplex.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And you are not certain as to where this photograph which\r\nwas the subject of these negotiations was taken?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, except that the Elsbeth address, I believe, was a brick\r\nresidence, I mean a brick apartment, it is a dark building, and the\r\nNeely Street address is a white building.\r\n\r\nI believe the photo shows a white building.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. On the basis of that you would conclude the photograph was\r\ntaken at which address?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. At the Neely Street address.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. At the Neely Street address. When you were negotiating\r\nwith various publications for this photograph, didn't anyone ask you\r\nwhen and where it was taken?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, I told them that it was while they were living in Oak\r\nCliff. I didn't say where or when.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. No one asked you.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. And they apparently weren't concerned with the where or\r\nwhen.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did they ask you anything about the publication which Lee\r\nOswald had in his hand?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, and I told them that it was either the Militant or the\r\nWorker. I was not sure which one. I am not even sure whether either one.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Your copy of the photograph did not indicate clearly which\r\none it was?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Correct.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you now know which one it was?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Are you sure it is one of the two?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, I am not. I assume that it would be one of the two.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. For the record it is the Militant.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It is?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Is there anything about the circumstances of this\r\nphotograph, including the rifle, the pistol, the time, the place,\r\nanything concerning this photograph that you have not told this\r\nCommission about which you have knowledge?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. The last item on Commission Exhibit No. 325 is This Week\r\nmagazine, $1,000. Could you tell us about that. At the conclusion of\r\nthis list I will ask if there is anything else. We are now at This Week\r\nmagazine.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. When Marina was here in Washington, she had the press\r\nconference, and at the end of the press conference she mentioned, she\r\nmade a statement \"Now I go to church.\" On the way to the CBS studios we\r\npassed a Russian Orthodox Church, and she remarked about it, that she\r\nwould like to come back and go inside, see what it looked like. Someone\r\nin This Week magazine caught that statement, and wanted to write a\r\nshort article on Marina going to church, and that is what that is.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. What happened? Could you tell us how this article got\r\nwritten?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It hasn't been written.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did the reporter accompany Mrs. Oswald to church?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Oh, no. Actually when the television interview was over,\r\nwe came back and went to the church, but the church was locked and\r\nwe didn't get in at all. Now this contact was made after we left\r\nWashington. This Week magazine contacted us after, not while we were\r\nstill here.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And what was the subject matter of this article\r\nspecifically supposed to be?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. The title of it was supposed to be \"I go to church,\" and it\r\nwould be an article written on Marina going to church.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Martin, the total figure on the bottom of Commission\r\nExhibit No. 325 is $132,350. This presumably does not include any\r\nfuture royalties, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Have you made an estimate as to the total earnings which\r\nwould accrue as a result of these contractual arrangements?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It should be approximately $300,000 at a maximum, depending\r\non what American serial rights and British Commonwealth serial rights,\r\nAsiatic serial rights would bring.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. You say the maximum of $300,000?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I think so.\r\n\r\nMr. LEECH. Of those contracts?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. That is what I am asking about are these.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Of these contracts, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Could you tell us about any other contractual arrangements\r\nthat you have made or are negotiating on behalf of Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. There are no others. I will have to refer to things.\r\nWe had an offer from Australia and also from New Zealand as far as\r\nthis photograph is concerned. However, it was thrown to the wind by\r\nthe Detroit Free Press, so they got it from Detroit Free Press, we\r\nhave been offered--we have not received an offer. The Australian\r\nnewspaper----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you need these details do you think?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. I want to get the total figure, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Associated Newspapers Limited of Australia would like to\r\nhave Australian rights to a book that Marina would write, and also\r\nthe London Evening Standard would like to have the British rights, of\r\ncourse, to the picture of Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Martin, Mr. Thorne has indicated to this Commission\r\nthat he estimated that Marina's earnings would approach approximately\r\n$500,000. Would you comment on that estimate?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I think it might be a little high. Of course, if you take\r\ninto consideration she has $68,000, close to $70,000 in contributions\r\nalone, then the advances on this Exhibit No. 325, that is $200,000\r\nright there. I think $500,000 might be just a little bit high.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. The final document I would like to show you is a photostat\r\nof a letter which you presented to the Commission today, purporting to\r\nbe a letter written in Russian together with an English translation. It\r\nstarts, the English translation starts with the words \"As the widow of\r\nLee Oswald.\" I show you Commission Exhibit No. 333 and ask you if this\r\nis a photostat of the letter which you submitted to the Commission this\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, apparently so.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Who is that letter to?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. We don't know yet.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You don't know yet?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. I will develop that in the questioning. I mark this\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 333, being a Russian letter and what purports to\r\nbe its English translation and ask that it be admitted in evidence.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Can you identify that any further than just a Russian\r\nletter?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. On the top appears a date, and the day of the month is the\r\n20th. I am unable to tell what month it is.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. But the year is 1964, and the words \"Dallas, Texas\" then\r\nappear under the date.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That helps identify it.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. I ask that it be admitted in evidence.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Any objection?\r\n\r\nMr. LEECH. No objection.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It is admitted.\r\n\r\n(The photostats of a Russian letter with an English translation were\r\nmarked Commission Exhibit No. 333 for identification and received in\r\nevidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Martin, with your permission I would just summarize\r\nthe contents of this letter, and if I have summarized it inaccurately,\r\njust say so. This letter requests that the death penalty not be applied\r\nto Jack Ruby, the person who has been charged with the murder of Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald. Is that inaccurate?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No; that is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. That is a correct summary of the contents of the letter?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you recall to whom that letter was written?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. She originally wrote the letter to Melvin Belli.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. By \"she\" you mean Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Marina. I advised her against----\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Melvin Belli?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Is the attorney for Jack Ruby. I advised her against\r\nsuch an action, because of the possibility of the letter itself in\r\ntranslating from Russian to English being misinterpreted and used in a\r\nmanner that might be derogatory to Marina Oswald. I suggested that she\r\nsend this letter to Henry Wade who would be the prosecutor in the case.\r\nNow whether she changed the salutation on the letter I don't know.\r\nI can't read Russian. And the salutation was not translated in the\r\ntranslation. The translation was made by Katya Ford.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. To the best of your knowledge has this letter ever been\r\nsent to anyone?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No sir, it hasn't.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You say it has not been?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It has not been.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is your belief or you have knowledge that it has not\r\nbeen?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I have the original. Now if a letter has been sent, it\r\nwould be a different letter.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. On the basis of your knowledge of Marina Oswald's\r\nhandwriting, would you tell the Commission whether you believe that\r\nthis letter is in her handwriting?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, it is. I also observed her writing the letter.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Are you aware of the fact that Marina Oswald discussed\r\nthis letter when she appeared before this Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I believe you mentioned it sometime today.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Were you aware of it prior to your coming here?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Do you know why it has not been sent?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. She decided that it was best not to be sent unless she\r\nactually thought that Ruby was going to get the death penalty. Actually\r\na letter like that should go to the Governor of the State.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Martin, do you have any additional information\r\nconcerning the assassination of President Kennedy, Marina Oswald, or\r\nthe assassination of her husband Lee Harvey Oswald which you would like\r\nto present before this Commission at this time?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, I don't think so. Nothing.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. If it would be helpful for the work of this Commission for\r\nyou to return to Washington and appear again before this Commission,\r\nwould you be willing to do so?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Chairman, I have no further questions of this witness,\r\nunless Mr. Rankin does or you do.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I would just like to ask a question about this letter I am\r\njust glancing over. Where did this letter paper come from? Is that some\r\npersonal paper with a tree on it?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. I bought that.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You bought it for her?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. At a drug store, yes, sir, at a drug store in Arlington.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is this another draft or is this just a copy?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. This is the original of the copy.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. We have photographed what is now Commission Exhibit No.\r\n333 and we are keeping the photostat. Mr. Martin, you will recall that\r\nat the start of today's proceedings Chief Justice Warren read into the\r\nrecord a copy of the letter which you received requesting certain\r\nnotes, records, documents in connection with today's hearing. Have\r\nyou made available to the Commission all of the material which was\r\nrequested in that letter?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir; I went through everything I had at home, and\r\ncould find nothing else.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. If you should find anything else which you inadvertently\r\nfailed to bring before this Commission, will you mail it to us for\r\nexamination and we will return it to you.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir; there is a Worker that I have.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. You mean by Worker the Daily Worker?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. I think they dropped the \"Daily.\"\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. They are no longer daily.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It is called the Worker now. It has quite a lengthy article\r\nabout Marina in it, and I will send that to you.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And you will send anything that you may come across which\r\nyou may have inadvertently failed to produce before this Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. There were some questions that Senator Cooper had\r\nsuggested. I don't know, have you looked those over? Have they been\r\ncovered?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Those have been covered.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. All been covered?\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did Marina ever express to you her opinion as to the guilt\r\nor innocence of her husband in connection with the assassination of the\r\nPresident?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What did she say?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. She believes he was guilty. She believes he did it, and\r\nthe first time she said it I questioned her as to why she thought he\r\ndid it, and she said she just felt it. It was a woman's intuition. She\r\ndidn't know the word intuition at that time. I had to look it up in the\r\nRussian-English Dictionary.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did she indicate any view as to whether he did it alone or\r\nhad an accomplice or accomplices?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. She remarked about the Walker incident, that that was\r\ndefinitely done alone, and that he always was alone. He never did\r\nanything with anyone else. I don't recall that she mentioned that\r\nspecifically in the case of the assassination of the President. But she\r\nhad made that remark before or during the interim about Walker.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did she ever at any time express to you any interest in\r\nreturning to the Soviet Union or her desire to stay in the United\r\nStates?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Well, she has always said that she wanted to stay in the\r\nUnited States. One time she said that she thought she would go back to\r\nRussia, and I asked her why and she said, well, she was just joking.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did she ever refer to you any letters she wrote to the\r\nSoviet Embassy with regard to a desire to return?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. There was only one incident that she told me about was\r\na letter to a friend in Russia.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You mentioned that I think.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The one that she didn't put enough stamps on, enough\r\npostage on.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, it came back \"insufficient postage.\"\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did she ever mention to you any names of any friends or\r\nassociates of her husband that had not been discussed here at one time\r\nor another in this testimony, including the list of names that was read\r\nout to you?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you know any other friends that Marina has other than\r\nthose that have been discussed in this testimony?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. I was trying to think a while ago about that, and I\r\ncan't think of anyone else.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is all I have.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Mr. Leech, would you like to ask Mr. Martin any questions\r\nat this time?\r\n\r\nMr. LEECH. Not a word.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Mr. Rhyne? Mr. Rankin, have you any further questions?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Chairman, I merely wish to thank him for appearing\r\nvoluntarily.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I do thank you for coming and responding so fully to our\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Anything I can do.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And if anything occurs to you or to your counsel as\r\nsometimes happens later, we will be very glad if you or your counsel\r\nwill bring it to our attention.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir; I certainly will.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. May I before we adjourn ask another question?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Certainly.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Have you ever discussed with Mrs. Marguerite Oswald the\r\nquestion of the guilt or innocence of Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No. The only time I was in contact with Marguerite Oswald\r\nwas at the Inn of the Six Flags in Arlington, Tex., and I don't believe\r\nI really discussed anything with her. I was more on the sidelines and\r\ndidn't enter into any discussions with her at all.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And have you discussed with Robert Oswald the question of\r\nthe guilt or innocence of Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes. Let's see, on one occasion the article by Mark\r\nLane, I think it was in the National Observer, was printed in the\r\nNational Observer, and I called Robert's attention to that. I believe\r\nhe cited 15 points where he believed that Lee Oswald was innocent,\r\nand I remarked to Robert that in nearly 100 percent of those points\r\nthey were just completely out of line. The brief I believe was taken\r\nfrom newspaper accounts, from various newspaper accounts of the\r\nassassination, and a number of them contradicted each other.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Did Robert Oswald comment on this?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. For the record I believe the publication you are referring\r\nto is the National Guardian.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. The National Guardian, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. Is that your recollection now?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, National Guardian.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. And Robert Oswald had no comment on this?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. REDLICH. We have no further questions.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The Commission will stand adjourned, subject to call.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 10:20 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, March 4, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MARK LANE\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 2:30 p.m., on March 4, 1964, at 200\r\nMaryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Sherman\r\nCooper and Representative Gerald R. Ford, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; Norman Redlich,\r\nassistant counsel; Charles Murray and Charles Rhyne, assistants to\r\nWalter E. Craig.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will be in order.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has been informed that Mr. Lane has collected numerous\r\nmaterials relevant to the Commission's work.\r\n\r\nThe Commission proposes to question Mr. Lane on all matters of which\r\nhe has knowledge concerning the assassination of President Kennedy and\r\nthe subsequent killing of Lee Harvey Oswald, and to request of Mr. Lane\r\nthat he make available to the Commission any documentary material in\r\nhis possession which can assist the Commission in its work.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the rules of this Commission, Mr. Lane has been\r\nfurnished with a copy of this statement.\r\n\r\nMr. Lane, would please rise and be sworn? Do you solemnly swear to tell\r\nthe truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Will you be seated, please.\r\n\r\nMr. Rankin, would you proceed with the examination, please?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Lane, will you state your name?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. My name is Mark Lane.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Where do you live?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. 164 West 79th Street, New York City, New York State.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Are you a practicing lawyer?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; I am.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you state your age, please?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I am 37 years old.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. How long have you been practicing law?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Thirteen years.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You have qualified in the State of New York?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Are you qualified in any other Jurisdiction?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Just in the Federal court.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have some information concerning the matters being\r\ninvestigated by the Commission that you would like to present to the\r\nCommission?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you proceed to do so?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes.\r\n\r\nI wonder if I might ask at the outset if I will be able to secure a\r\ncopy of the transcript of my testimony tomorrow, or is that going to be\r\nrushing things?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You will be able to obtain it. I don't know whether we\r\ncan promise it to you tomorrow morning or not. But we will do it just\r\nas quickly as it can be transcribed by the reporter.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, I would like to request that this portion of the\r\nhearing, in any event, be opened to the public. I think that there are\r\nmatters here of grave concern to all the people of our country, and\r\nthat it would, therefore, be fruitful and constructive for the sessions\r\nto be conducted in a public fashion, open to the public and to the\r\npress.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I request that this session at least involving my\r\ntestimony be so opened to the public.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You would have a right, as any witness would have, to\r\nrequest that, Mr. Lane. We will conduct this in an open hearing. We\r\nwill adjourn at this time to the auditorium downstairs, and we will\r\nconduct the hearing there. It will be open to the public. I saw a good\r\nmany members of the press around, so it will really be a public affair.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 2:45 p.m., the Commission recessed and then reconvened\r\nin the auditorium in open session.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MARK LANE RESUMED IN OPEN SESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will be in order.\r\n\r\nThe Commission convened in our committee room on the fourth floor.\r\n\r\nA reporter has been appointed.\r\n\r\nMr. Lane has been sworn.\r\n\r\nMr. Lane has stated that he would like to give his testimony at a\r\npublic hearing. I explained to him that that was thoroughly agreeable\r\nto the Commission. The Commission does not operate in a secret way. Any\r\nwitness who desires to have his--give his testimony in public may do so.\r\n\r\nWe have done it in the quiet of our rooms for the convenience of\r\nwitnesses, and in order to accelerate the program. But any witness who\r\ndesires to have his testimony recorded at a public hearing may do so.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Commission is, of course, eventually to make known\r\nto the President, and to the American public everything that has\r\ntranspired before this Commission. All of it will be made available at\r\nthe appropriate time. The records of the work of the Commission will be\r\npreserved for the public. So, Mr. Lane, we will be happy to accommodate\r\nyou, and to proceed with our hearing.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Rankin will conduct the examination.\r\n\r\n(Having been previously duly sworn.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Lane, will you proceed to tell the Commission whatever\r\nyou have that would bear upon this investigation? Start item by item,\r\nand give us whatever you have in support.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, I would like to call to the Commission's attention a\r\nmatter which is somewhat peripheral, perhaps, and should the Commission\r\ndetermine it does not wish to hear my testimony in that regard, I\r\nwill understand that. But I would like to call it to your attention,\r\nbecause although it is peripheral I think it is related to both the\r\nassassination and the investigation into the assassination of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nThat is in relationship to a picture which has been widely publicized,\r\nprobably in every single community of our country, allegedly showing\r\nLee Harvey Oswald holding in his hand a rifle which has been described\r\nin at least one publication, Life magazine, as the weapon with which he\r\nassassinated President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nI would like to indicate to the Commission at this time that the\r\npictures which have been distributed throughout the country included\r\ndoctored and forged photographs. I would like to present evidence to\r\nthe Commission at this time in that regard.\r\n\r\nI ask the Commission if it does conclude that the photographs have been\r\ndoctored, whether it will consider determining whether or not a crime\r\nhas been committed, or an effort has been made to submit evidence to\r\nthe Commission members, though not directly through the press, from\r\nmagazines, which evidence----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I didn't get that last sentence--something about the\r\nCommission?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I am asking the Commission if it does conclude that the\r\npictures have been doctored, to consider investigating the method by\r\nwhich the doctoring took place, who was responsible, and whether or not\r\nan effort has been made to influence the members of the Commission,\r\nwhile not directly, through the publication of this picture, which\r\ncertainly has been circulated very widely throughout our country.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You may be sure, Mr. Lane, that anything you present in\r\nthat regard will be thoroughly considered by the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\nI would like to offer the February 21, 1964 issue of Life magazine.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you mark that, Mr. Reporter, please, the next number.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. A picture appears on the entire cover of Life magazine, and\r\nan identical picture appears in the interior pages, at page 80. The\r\ncaption on the cover reads, \"Lee Oswald with the weapons he used to\r\nkill President Kennedy and Officer Tippit.\"\r\n\r\nI think it is quite plain from looking at both of the pictures that\r\nthere appears on the rifle, what appears to be a rifle in the left hand\r\nof Lee Harvey Oswald, a telescopic sight.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr. Lane, we will mark that Exhibit No. 334.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 334, for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Next I would like to offer a picture which is a glossy\r\n8-1/2-by-11 picture, of a photograph published in the New York Times,\r\nsecured by the New York Times from the Associated Press.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is there any verification of the fact that that is\r\nas you have identified it?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. That is what--a picture secured----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. From the New York Times, which in turn had\r\nacquired it from the Associated Press?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Well, that is a statement which I have made under oath, and\r\nit can be verified with the New York Times.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is Exhibit 335 that you are just referring to, Mr.\r\nLane.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 335, for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I suggest that is the identical picture with the one\r\npublished on the cover of Life magazine, Exhibit 334, in every respect,\r\nincluding the creases in the trousers, the background, with the\r\nexception of the rifle in the hands of Oswald, which appears to have no\r\ntelescopic scope in Exhibit 335.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there clearly has been some other doctoring of the\r\nphotograph around the head of Lee Harvey Oswald, and the trees and\r\nother background material over his left shoulder have been removed from\r\nthe Associated Press picture, but are present in the Life magazine\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nShadows and fenceposts which can be observed between the legs of Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald in Exhibit 335 have been removed in the Life magazine\r\npicture. I would like to offer this picture as the next exhibit.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That will be marked Exhibit 336.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 336 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you tell us what that is, Mr. Lane?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; 336 is an 8-1/2-by-11 glossy photograph of a picture\r\nappearing in Newsweek magazine, March 2, 1964, credited by Newsweek\r\nmagazine to the Detroit Free Press. I would suggest that that is an\r\nidentical picture with the other two pictures in every respect, except\r\nthat it has no telescopic sight on the rifle, and there is a great deal\r\nof metallic materials present on that rifle clearly not present in the\r\nother two pictures.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Did you say metallics?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Metallics.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you tell us what you mean by that, Mr. Lane?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes. Just below the hand, the left hand of Lee Harvey Oswald,\r\nthere is clearly visible a series of pieces of metal, allegedly part of\r\nthe rifle, which are in no way clear--which are in no way present in\r\nthe other pictures.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. To make that clearer, I would like to offer Exhibit 337,\r\nwhich is an enlargement of the picture 335, the New York Times picture.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 337, for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. This enlarges the area on the rifle just below what is\r\nallegedly Oswald's left hand. It clearly shows an absolute absence of\r\nall of the metallic material present in the Newsweek photo, 336.\r\n\r\nThis is a front page of the New York Journal American dated February\r\n18, 1964, which is an identical picture with the one published in\r\nLife magazine, Exhibit 334, and the credit lines appearing on that\r\npublication indicate that the picture has been secured from the\r\nAssociated Press through the Detroit Free Press.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 338, for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. That picture has a telescopic sight, and is not the picture\r\nin terms of the metal material on the rifle which Newsweek stated they\r\nsecured through the Detroit Free Press, and is not the picture without\r\nthe telescopic sight which the New York Times states that it secured\r\nthrough the Associated Press. In any event, I would like to submit a\r\npicture procured from Worldwide Photos.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. 339.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 339, for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. This is allegedly a picture taken in the Dallas Police\r\nStation, showing the alleged murder weapon.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That is No. 339, Mr. Lane?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes, sir, and I would call the Commission's attention to the\r\ncurved line of the stock present in Exhibit 339, and obviously absent\r\nfrom every other picture, indicating that in no event is the rifle\r\nallegedly in the hands of Lee Oswald, in Exhibits 334 through 338\r\ncomparable to the alleged murder weapon as shown in the Dallas police\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nAnd should the Commission decide to investigate the obviously doctored\r\npictures that have been circulated so widely in our country, I would\r\nrefer the Commission investigators to the Times Picayune of New\r\nOrleans, published on November 24, 1963, in which an Associated Press\r\nstory indicated that the Dallas police chief, Jesse Curry, stated that\r\nhe had in his possession photographs found in the home of Lee Harvey\r\nOswald's Russian-born wife which linked Oswald with the rifle used\r\nin the assassination of President Kennedy. Curry said in the article\r\nattributed to Curry----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you wish to make that a part of the record?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That will be Exhibit 340.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 340 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. The article attributes a statement to Curry indicating that\r\nhe, the Dallas Police Chief, found the pictures in the suburban Irving,\r\nTex., home in which Marina Oswald lived, and stated that Mr. Curry had\r\nsaid that the pictures will be used in evidence in Oswald's murder\r\ntrial. This was published, I assume, prior to the time that Oswald was\r\nhimself killed on that day.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Would the date of the paper be on the back side?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It is on the front. November 24th.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I would like to offer this as an exhibit.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. This is marked Commission Exhibit 341.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 341, for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Exhibit 341 is a page or portion of a page of the New York\r\nTimes, on Sunday, December 8, with a picture of the alleged murder\r\nweapon, secured, according to the credit line under the picture, from\r\nthe United Press International, indicating clearly that that rifle is\r\nnot the rifle allegedly being held by Mr. Oswald in any of the pictures\r\nso widely circulated throughout our country.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. On what do you base that last conclusion, Mr. Lane? Would\r\nyou point out to the Commission the differences as you see them?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; the reference of the stock. The stock has a clearly\r\ncurved and bent line in this picture.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That is in Exhibit 341?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes, and it is present in none of the pictures of Oswald\r\nholding the rifle; 336, for example, in Newsweek magazine shows almost\r\na straight stock. Some of them show even an absolutely straight stock.\r\n\r\nExhibit 335 from the New York Times shows a perfectly straight\r\nstock--which is not only a stock unlike this particular Italian 6.5\r\nmillimeter carbine, but is a stock I believe unlike any rifle stock\r\nproduced during the 20th century, and possibly the 19th century,\r\nanywhere. Rifle experts seem to agree that every stock must have in\r\nit some break, so that it is possible to place your hand around the\r\nrifle while your finger holds the trigger. And there is no break in\r\nthe doctored photographs, in the stock portrayed on the doctored\r\nphotographs.\r\n\r\nI have checked many rifle catalogs. This is not my field, and I don't\r\nqualify as an expert. But I have checked many rifle catalogs, and have\r\nonly seen rifles with a break where the stock becomes narrow enough for\r\none's hand to grasp it while pulling the trigger.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is that the basis of your opinion that you have just given,\r\nthat it doesn't have a break in it, and that other rifles for any\r\nperiod later than you have described do?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Well, several persons who have described themselves as rifle\r\nexperts have made that statement to me.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Who are those?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I believe I have some of their names here. I don't have the\r\nnames of those who have called, but I can secure that at our first\r\nbreak by a telephone call to my office.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Would you furnish that then?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Surely. In any event, whether there was another rifle or\r\nnot, the rifle portrayed in the picture is clearly--in the picture in\r\nwhich Oswald is allegedly holding the rifle--clearly is not the rifle\r\nallegedly claimed to be the murder weapon. I wonder if I might ask the\r\nCommission if it might produce the rifle now, so that we might compare\r\nthe actual rifle with the pictures.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. We will do that in due course. But we don't have the\r\nrifle here now, Mr. Lane. We will make the proper comparisons, you may\r\nbe sure, with experts.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Now, on another peripheral matter--unless there are any\r\nfurther questions in relation to this matter----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. No, you may proceed. Do you have negatives of these\r\npictures you have produced?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No. I am glad you asked that question, because I can now\r\nrelate to you about a conversation that I had 2 or 3 days ago with\r\na Mr. Dirksen, who is on the photo desk of the Associated Press. I\r\ncalled Mr. Dirksen and asked him for a glossy of the picture which the\r\nAssociated Press sent out over the wire service.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Could you identify Mr. Dirksen a little more clearly?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. He just told me he was employed. I called the Associated\r\nPress in New York City and asked for the photo desk, Mr. Dirksen\r\nanswered and said he was employed there. I asked him what his specific\r\nposition was there, and he declined to give me that information. He\r\nsaid he didn't think it was relevant.\r\n\r\nIn any event, I asked him if he could secure for me a glossy, a glossy\r\ncopy of the picture sent by the Associated Press over the wires. And\r\nI described the picture as the one of Oswald allegedly holding the\r\nmurder weapon in his left hand, and having on his right hip a pistol,\r\nallegedly the pistol with which he slew Officer Tippit.\r\n\r\nMr. Dirksen stated to me that he could not make a glossy of that\r\npicture available to me and I pointed out to him that in the past the\r\nAssociated Press had been most cooperative when I asked for pictures,\r\nand he said, \"Yes, we sent a whole batch up to you last week, didn't\r\nwe?\" I said, \"Yes, you did, I appreciated that. I wonder why this\r\npicture is being treated differently from other pictures.\" He said,\r\n\"This is not a normal picture and this is not the normal situation.\"\r\n\r\nI asked him what he meant by that. He explained that there was a\r\nspecial contract--he did not have all the details, he said, because\r\nhe is not one of the persons who was involved in drafting the\r\ncontract--but there was a special contract between the Associated Press\r\nand the source of this picture, and they agreed, the Associated Press\r\nagreed in this contract that they would not make a glossy available\r\nto anyone, that they would send the pictures out only to their\r\nsubscribers, and that no one else would be allowed to see the picture.\r\n\r\nI said if that was the understanding, I certainly would not wish to\r\nhave them breach their agreement, and asked if instead he would make\r\nthe name of the source known to me, so that I might go directly to the\r\nsource and see if I might secure the picture in that fashion. He stated\r\nhe could not do that, because one of the other stipulations in the\r\ncontract would be that they could not reveal the name of the source of\r\nthe picture.\r\n\r\nI discussed this with an employee of the New York Times thereafter,\r\nsince I knew that the New York Times was a subscriber to the services\r\nmade available by the Associated Press.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Could you identify that employee, please?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No, I am not going to be able to discuss sources, obviously,\r\nhere, I am sorry.\r\n\r\nBut this employee indicated to me thereafter that an inquiry had been\r\nmade by the New York Times to the Associated Press along the same lines\r\nas the inquiry which I had made, in terms of trying to determine the\r\nsource of the Associated Press picture. And I was informed by this\r\nemployee of the New York Times that the Associated Press declined to\r\nname the source of the picture, even when the New York Times made a\r\nrequest. Therefore, I do not have the negative, and I do not know the\r\nsource of the picture.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is that true with regard to all of the pictures that you\r\nproduced?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. My office called Life magazine, and asked someone at Life\r\nmagazine on the photo desk, the editorial department, if a picture\r\ncould be made available and they stated that they would not make a\r\nglossy available--it was their policy in reference to all pictures in\r\ntheir possession.\r\n\r\nThose are the only inquiries I made with reference to the source of the\r\npictures.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now you may proceed.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes. I would like to raise one other peripheral matter before\r\ngoing into the evidence, if I might. That is, I would like to call to\r\nthe attention of the Commission this article, and ask that it be marked\r\nas an exhibit.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. That has been marked Commission Exhibit 342.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 342, for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThis is an article appearing in the New York Journal American Sunday,\r\nFebruary 23.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. This consists of two separate pages, does it not?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. It does--the first page being a masthead and front page,\r\nheadline from the Journal American, dated Sunday, February 23, 1964,\r\nand the second page containing a portion of the front page of the\r\nJournal American on that date, and a portion of page 15, the continued\r\nstory of the Journal American on the same date.\r\n\r\nThis is an article written by Bob Considine, who enjoys a reputation\r\nfor being an excellent reporter. Mr. Considine states in his article\r\nthat an eyewitness to the shooting of Officer Tippit by the name of\r\nWarren Reynolds was himself recently shot through the head by a man\r\nwith a rifle.\r\n\r\nNow, I don't believe that it is alleged that Reynolds actually saw the\r\nperson pull the trigger which sent the bullets at Officer Tippit. As\r\nI understand it, Mr. Reynolds has stated that he, Reynolds, heard the\r\nshot, the shooting, left his office and saw a man running away, placing\r\nnew shells into a pistol as he ran away. And Mr. Considine indicates\r\nthat Reynolds thereafter identified Oswald as the person who was\r\nrunning from the scene.\r\n\r\nThis article indicated that during January, Mr. Reynolds was himself\r\nshot through the head with a rifle, and that he is in the hospital--I\r\nbelieve he was in the hospital at that time. I don't know what the\r\nstate of his health is at the present time.\r\n\r\nMr. Considine indicates that a person was picked up in the Dallas area\r\nand charged with the shooting, but that someone who Mr. Considine\r\nrefers to as \"his girl\"--I assume he is making reference to the\r\ngentleman who was charged with the attack upon Reynolds--testified\r\nin such a fashion, and took a lie detector test, so that the person\r\ncharged with the crime was released.\r\n\r\nThis person, Betty Mooney MacDonald, who helped to free her friend,\r\naccording to Mr. Considine, herself had worked as a stripper in the\r\nCarousel Club in Dallas, owned by Jack Ruby.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks before this article was written, Miss MacDonald was herself\r\narrested for a fight with her roommate, and the week before the article\r\nwas written, Mr. Considine states she hanged herself in her cell.\r\n\r\nI would request the Commission to investigate into these series of most\r\nunusual coincidences, to see if they have any bearing upon the basic\r\nmatter pending before the Commission.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be introduced as are all of these pictures,\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\n(The documents heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibits Nos. 334 to 342, were received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. In the course of my investigation, I have come across some\r\nmaterial which would be relevant only if I was first able to examine\r\nthe rifle, quite frankly. I wonder if that might be able to be\r\naccomplished sometime during the day?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. During the day?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Today, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, I think not, because we don't have it. But we will\r\nmake it available to you, though, at the very first opportunity, Mr.\r\nLane.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Fine. Then I will reserve my comment in reference to the\r\nrifle for that occasion.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You may.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Thank you. I would like to, on behalf of Lee Harvey Oswald,\r\nmake this information available to the Commission.\r\n\r\nIt, of course, has been alleged by the chief of police of Dallas, and\r\nby the district attorney of Dallas that Oswald was present on the\r\nsixth floor of the Texas Book Depository Building during the very\r\nearly afternoon of November 22, 1963, and that from that area he fired\r\nan Italian carbine, 6.5 millimeters, three times, twice striking the\r\nPresident of the United States, wounding him fatally, and injuring the\r\nGovernor of Texas by striking him with a bullet, on one occasion.\r\n\r\nThe physician who signed the death certificate of the President\r\npronouncing him dead was Dr. Kemp Clark, whose name appeared on the\r\nofficial homicide report filed by the Dallas Police Department, and\r\nattested to by two police officers.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of November, the New York Times reported, \"Dr. Kemp Clark,\r\nwho pronounced Mr. Kennedy dead, said one bullet struck him at about\r\nthe necktie knot, 'It ranged downward in his chest and did not exit'\r\nthe surgeon said.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day the New York Herald Tribune stated, \"On the basis of\r\naccumulated data, investigators have concluded that the first shot\r\nfired as the Presidential car was approaching, struck the President in\r\nthe neck, just above the knot of his necktie, then ranged downward into\r\nhis body.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Richard Dudman--Mr. Dudman is the Washington\r\ncorrespondent, as I am sure you all know better than I, for the St.\r\nLouis Post-Dispatch--according to him, the surgeons who attended the\r\nPresident while he was at the Parkland Memorial Hospital, described\r\nthe wound--were in agreement in describing the wound in the throat\r\nas an entrance wound. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch on December 1\r\ncarried a rather long and involved story by Mr. Dudman, recounting his\r\nconversations with the physicians who were treating the President on\r\nthe 22d at the Parkland Memorial Hospital.\r\n\r\nDr. Perry explained that he began to open an air passage in the\r\nPresident's throat in an effort to restore his breathing, and he\r\nexplained that the incision had been made through the bullet wound in\r\nthe President's throat--since that was in the correct place for the\r\noperation, in any event. Dr. Perry, according to Mr. Dudman, described\r\nto him the bullet hole as an entrance wound.\r\n\r\nDr. Robert N. McClelland, who was one of the three physicians who\r\nparticipated in that operation, later stated to Mr. Dudman, \"It\r\ncertainly did look like an entrance wound.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on to say that he saw bullet wounds every day in Dallas,\r\nsometimes several times a day, and that this did appear to be an\r\nentrance wound.\r\n\r\nOne doctor made reference to the frothing of blood in the neck wound.\r\nThe doctor said, \"He is bubbling air.\" Two of the doctors, Drs.\r\nPeters and Baxter, inserted a tube into the right upper part of the\r\nPresident's chest, just below the shoulder, to reexpand the lungs, and\r\nto keep them from collapsing.\r\n\r\nDr. Jones and Dr. Perry inserted a similar tube on the left portion of\r\nthe President's chest.\r\n\r\nThe activity was necessitated because the bubbling air was the first\r\nclue that they had that the President's lung had been punctured.\r\n\r\nThe prosecuting authorities, confronted with what seemed then to be\r\nevidence that the President had been shot from the front, in the\r\nthroat----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Are you reading now, Mr. Lane?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No, I am just making reference to this. That is not a quote.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It is not a quote. You are just paraphrasing what was in\r\nthis article of Mr. Dudman's?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No, I am leaving Mr. Dudman now, and going on to statements\r\nmade by the prosecuting authorities. I will submit quotations--I will\r\ntry to remember to place quotation marks when I have a quotation.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes, all right.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. The authorities who were confronted with what seemed to be\r\nirrefutable evidence that the President had been shot in the front of\r\nthe throat, concluded that the Presidential limousine was approaching\r\nthe Book Depository Building when the first shot was fired, because\r\nit seems at the very outset a theory was developed by the prosecuting\r\nauthorities that Oswald was on the sixth floor of the Book Depository\r\nBuilding, that he was the assassin, and that he acted alone.\r\n\r\nI think that the record and an examination of the activities of the\r\nDallas police, and the Dallas district attorney's office, will show\r\nthat the only area where they have been consistent from the outset was\r\nonce this theory was enunciated, they stayed with the theory, and they\r\nwere devoted to the theory, regardless of the discovery of new evidence\r\nand new facts.\r\n\r\nFor example, the New York Times stated on November 26, 1963, \"The known\r\nfacts about the bullets, and the position of the assassin, suggested\r\nthat he started shooting as the President's car was coming toward him,\r\nswung his rifle in an arc of almost 180°, and fired at least twice\r\nmore.\" At that time, the prosecution case had already been developed in\r\nterms of the theory that Oswald was the assassin and that Oswald acted\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nThere were newspaper pictures published in many portions of the country\r\nshowing the Textbook Depository Building on Houston Street where the\r\nPresidential limousine approached the Book Depository Building, and Elm\r\nStreet, where after the limousine made a sharp left turn it continued\r\nuntil it reached the underpass directly ahead.\r\n\r\nAnd in these newspapers, there were superimposed dotted lines showing\r\nthe trajectory of the three bullets, showing that the first bullet was\r\nfired while the Presidential car was still on Houston Street, still\r\napproaching the Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\nHowever, it soon became essential for the prosecution to abandon that\r\ntheory, because the eyewitnesses present, including Governor Connally,\r\nand Mrs. Connally, stated that the limousine had already made a left\r\nturn, had passed the Book Depository Building at the time that the\r\nfirst shot was fired.\r\n\r\nIn essence, then, the prosecution remained with the theory that Oswald,\r\nwhile acting alone, shot the President from the front from the back.\r\n\r\nHowever,----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I don't understand that.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I don't understand that either, but this was the theory of\r\nthe prosecution--that the President had--it had been conceded at that\r\ntime that the President had been shot in the front of the throat.\r\nHowever, the evidence then developed indicated that the Presidential\r\nlimousine had already passed the Book Depository Building, and the\r\nPresident was not facing the Book Depository Building when the first\r\nshot was fired. At that time, Life magazine explains it all in a\r\nfull page article entitled, \"An End to Nagging Rumors, the 6 Crucial\r\nSeconds.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Life conceded that the limousine was some 50 yards past Oswald when\r\nthe first shot was fired, and that the shot entered the President's\r\nthroat from the front, but explained that the President had turned\r\ncompletely around and was facing the Book Depository Building when the\r\nshot was fired.\r\n\r\nBut that theory, however, could not----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have the date of that article?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. That was December 6, Life magazine. The full page article was\r\nentitled \"End to Nagging Rumors, the Six Critical Seconds.\"\r\n\r\nThe problem----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask a question there--just to clarify? Did you\r\nsay that in this article that Life said that the late President had\r\nturned around and was facing the Book Depository Building when the shot\r\nwas fired?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes, Senator. The trouble with that theory, however, which\r\nwas enunciated by Life, and from where they secured it I do not\r\nknow, but they certainly were in Dallas very much in evidence on the\r\nscene--was that the week prior to then Life magazine itself printed\r\nthe stills of the motion pictures, and in those stills, with Life's\r\nown captions, it was quite plain that the President was looking almost\r\ncompletely forward, just slightly to the right, but almost forward, and\r\ncertainly not turned around when the first shot was fired. And so the\r\nstills printed in Life's own publication a week before they enunciated\r\nthis theory proved that the Life theory was false.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, persons present on the scene, such witnesses as\r\nMrs. Connally and the Governor of Texas, indicated that the President\r\nwas looking almost straight ahead. And I believe that Mrs. Connally\r\nstated that she had just made a statement to the President, tragically\r\nenough, something about, \"You cannot say the people of Dallas have not\r\ngiven you a warm welcome today,\" and he was about to respond when the\r\nfirst bullet struck him.\r\n\r\nIn order for the prosecution to remain with the theory in the light\r\nof the new evidence that Oswald was the assassin and he acted alone,\r\nsomething would have to give, and it became plain that the third try\r\nwould have to result in a new examination of the medical testimony.\r\n\r\nMr. Dudman stated that the doctors at Parkland Hospital, who had, of\r\ncourse, this vital evidence to offer, were never questioned about the\r\nvital evidence by the FBI or by the Secret Service, and that it was not\r\nuntil after an autopsy had been performed at Bethesda, that two Secret\r\nService agents, armed with that report, journeyed down to the Parkland\r\nHospital and talked to the doctors, for the purpose of explaining to\r\nthem that the new medical testimony and evidence indicated they were\r\nall in error at the outset. And, eventually, that was the position\r\nagreed to by the physicians, that they all had been in error when they\r\nstated that it was an entrance wound in the throat.\r\n\r\nPhysicians seem to agree that a short period of time after death, as\r\na result of the deterioration of tissue, it is much more difficult to\r\nexamine wounds to determine if they are entrance wounds or exit wounds.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, according to Mr. Dudman in the Post Dispatch\r\nthere had been an operation performed on what the doctors thought then\r\nwas an entrance wound; therefore, it would seem altering the wound in\r\nthe throat so that it would probably be more difficult to determine\r\nif it were an entrance or an exit wound, after the operation had been\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not know, of course, what is in the autopsy report--very\r\nlikely you have seen that report--but portions of it, whether\r\naccurately or inaccurately, have been leaked to the public through\r\nthe press. And the portion which has been leaked to the press, to the\r\npublic through the press, in reference to the wound in the President's\r\nthroat, indicated that the bullet struck the back of the President's\r\nhead, and either a fragment of the bullet or a fragment of bone from\r\nthe President's head exited at the throat.\r\n\r\nIf this were so, while it could explain perhaps the wound in the\r\nthroat, it would be difficult to understand why this was not apparent\r\nto the doctors in the Parkland Hospital, particularly in view of the\r\nfact that it would indicate that the path of the bullet ran from the\r\ntop of the head down to the throat, not from the throat down to the\r\nback of the chest, a very different path entirely.\r\n\r\nAnd since Dr. Perry indicated that he inserted a tube into the\r\nPresident's throat following the bullet wound, it would be difficult to\r\nunderstand how he was not aware of the path of the bullet, when it was\r\nabsolutely in the opposite direction from the one he thought it was in\r\nwhen he inserted the tube.\r\n\r\nMost remarkable of all, though, is that if the bullet entered the top\r\nof the head, and a portion of it or a portion of bone exited from the\r\nthroat, the collapse of the lungs and the frothing of air at the throat\r\nare both indications of a punctured lung--it would be difficult to\r\nexplain by that particular bullet's path.\r\n\r\nI think that an openminded investigating and prosecuting agency would\r\nhave found, at the outset, in view of the medical evidence available\r\nat the outset, that the President was shot from the front while\r\nfacing slightly to the right, and after passing the book depository\r\nbuilding--an openminded investigating body in Dallas, the district\r\nattorney's office or the police, or others who were associated in that\r\ninvestigation, might have considered abandoning their theory that\r\nOswald was the assassin and that he acted alone, and might have been\r\nled by the factual data to investigate in other areas as well--clearly\r\nsomething that they did not do.\r\n\r\nI have been informed by reporters, for example, that--reporters from\r\nforeign countries covering the trial, that some of them were very\r\nconcerned about the fact that they would now not be able to leave\r\nDallas, that clearly the airports would be closed, there would be\r\nroadblocks placed on many of the streets, the trains would be stopped\r\nor searched, in order that the assassin or those who assisted him,\r\nor those who assisted the assassins, might be prevented from readily\r\nleaving the entire area.\r\n\r\nI am informed by the reporters in the area that there were no such\r\nroadblocks, that planes continued to leave, trains continued to leave,\r\nand that the prosecution continued with its theory that Oswald was the\r\nassassin, that he acted alone, and they had secured his arrest, and\r\nthere was nothing more to be done other than to prove as conclusively\r\nas possible, utilizing the press as we know, and the television, and\r\nthe radio media for that purpose.\r\n\r\nAnd while I am on this question, I wonder if I might ask the Commission\r\nto give consideration to--although I don't believe that it is\r\npresent in any of the six panels which have been established by the\r\nCommission--but to give consideration nevertheless to the 48 hours\r\nin which Oswald was in custody, in reference to what happened to his\r\nrights as an American citizen, charged with a crime in this country.\r\n\r\nThe statement by the National Board of the American Civil Liberties\r\nUnion, that had Oswald lived he could not have secured a fair trial\r\nanywhere in this country.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You may be sure, Mr. Lane, that that will be given most\r\nserious consideration by the Commission, and the Commission has already\r\nappointed as an act in that direction the President of the American\r\nBar Association, with such help as he may wish to have, to make an\r\ninvestigation of that very thing. I assure you it will be done by the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Getting back to the evidence, Mr. Chief Justice, the\r\nspectator closest to President Kennedy, a Mrs. Hill, who was a\r\nsubstitute teacher in the Dallas public school system, stated to me\r\nthat she was in her view the closest spectator to the President, and\r\nwas standing alongside a Mary Moorman, who resides in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have the date of this interview, Mr. Lane?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. It was within the last week. She stated to me that she was\r\nthe closest spectator to the President, she and her friend, when the\r\nPresident was struck by a bullet. She said that she heard some four to\r\nsix shots fired.\r\n\r\nNow, she was standing on the grass across the--across Elm Street,\r\nacross from the Texas Book Depository Building. She said that in\r\nher--it is her feeling that all of the shots, the four to six shots,\r\ncame from the grassy knoll near the triple overpass which was at that\r\ntime directly in front and slightly to the right of the Presidential\r\nlimousine, and that in her view none of the shots were fired from the\r\nBook Depository Building which was directly across the street from her,\r\nand which was to the rear of the Presidential limousine.\r\n\r\nShe said further that after the last shot was fired, she saw a man run\r\nfrom behind the general area of a concrete facade on that grassy knoll,\r\nand that he ran on to the triple overpass.\r\n\r\nShe told me that standing alongside of her was Mary Moorman, who took\r\na picture of the President just a brief moment before the first shot\r\nwas fired, and that agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation took\r\nthe film from Miss Moorman, and gave her a receipt, which she still has\r\nin her possession, but that she has not been able to see the picture,\r\nand that it is possible that the picture included the entire Book\r\nDepository Building, taken just precisely a second or less before the\r\nshots were fired.\r\n\r\nTom Wicker, who is a member of the New York Times White House staff,\r\nwho was the only New York Times reporter in Dallas when the President\r\nwas shot, stated in an article which appeared in the Saturday Review,\r\non January 11, 1964, \"As we came out of the overpass, I saw a\r\nmotorcycle policeman drive over the curb, cross an open area, a few\r\nfeet up a railroad bank, dismount, and start scrambling up the bank.\"\r\nRonnie Dugger, who is the editor of the Texas Observer, a statewide\r\npublication in Texas, stated in his publication on November 29, 1963,\r\nand later stated to me in two different interviews material of the same\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nI am now quoting from the publication:\r\n\r\n\"On the other side of the overpass a motorcycle policeman was\r\nroughriding across some grass to the trestle for the railroad tracks,\r\nacross the overpass. He brought his cycle to a halt and leapt from it\r\nand was running up the base of the trestle when I lost sight of him.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you give us the date of the paper that came from?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes. That was the Texas Observer, November 29, 1963. That\r\nstatement has been confirmed by Mr. Dugger to me in two interviews in\r\nDallas.\r\n\r\nJames Vachule, who is a reporter for the Fort Worth Star Telegram,\r\nsaid, \"I heard the shots, several, at the triple overpass.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Jerry Flemmons, reporting also for the Fort Worth Star Telegram,\r\non November 22, 1963, stated, \"Kennedy was gunned down by an assassin,\r\napparently standing on the overpass above the freeway.\"\r\n\r\nNow, I spoke to a Mary Woodward, who is an employee of the Dallas\r\nMorning News, and she stated that she was present with three coworkers,\r\nall employees of the Dallas Morning News, and they were standing near\r\nthe--the base of the grassy knoll, perhaps 50 feet or so from the\r\noverpass, with the overpass to their right, and the book depository\r\nbuilding to their left. And on November 23, 1963, the Dallas Morning\r\nNews ran a story by Miss Woodward, and I have since that time spoken\r\nwith Miss Woodward by telephone, and she has confirmed portions--the\r\nentire portion which I will quote from now--in her conversation with me.\r\n\r\nThat is, that as she and her three coworkers waited for the President\r\nto pass, on the grassy slope just east of the triple overpass, she\r\nexplained that the President approached and acknowledged their cheers\r\nand the cheers of others, \"he faced forward again, and suddenly there\r\nwas an ear-shattering noise coming from behind us and a little to the\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have a statement, then, by an employee of the Dallas Morning\r\nNews, evidently speaking--she indicated to me that she was speaking on\r\nbehalf of all four employees, all of whom stated that the shots came\r\nfrom the direction of the overpass, which was to their right, and not\r\nat all from the Book Depository Building, which was to their left.\r\n\r\nMiss Woodward continued, \"Instead of speeding up the car, the car came\r\nto a halt. Things are a little bit hazy from this point, but I don't\r\nbelieve anyone was hit with the first bullet. The President and Mrs.\r\nKennedy turned and looked around as if they, too, didn't believe the\r\nnoise was really coming from a gun. Then after a moment's pause there\r\nwas another shot, and I saw the President slumping in the car.\"\r\n\r\nThis would seem to be consistent with the statement by Miss Hill that\r\nmore than three shots were fired.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these statements, James A. Chaney, who is a Dallas\r\nmotorcycle policeman, was quoted in the Houston Chronicle on November\r\n24, 1963, as stating that the first shot missed entirely. He said he\r\nwas 6 feet to the right and front of the President's car, moving about\r\n15 miles an hour, and when the first shot was fired. \"I thought it was\r\na backfire\", he said.\r\n\r\nNow, Miss Hill told me that when she was questioned--put that word\r\nunfortunately in quotation marks--by the U.S. Secret Service agents,\r\nthat they indicated to her what her testimony should be, and that is\r\nthat she only heard three shots. And she insisted that she heard from\r\nfour to six shots. And she said that at least one agent of the Secret\r\nService said to her, \"There were three wounds and there were three\r\nshells, so we are only saying three shots.\" And they raised with her\r\nthe possibility that instead of hearing more than three shots, that she\r\nmight have heard firecrackers exploding, or that she might have heard\r\nechoes.\r\n\r\nDespite this type of questioning by the Secret Service, Miss Hill\r\ncontinued to maintain, the last I spoke with her, about a week ago,\r\nthat she heard from four to six shots.\r\n\r\nNow, to the best of my knowledge, from my investigation, which has been\r\nvery severely limited by lack of personnel and almost total lack of\r\nfunds, and, therefore, is clearly not the kind of investigation which\r\nis required here--but from this limited investigation, it seems that\r\nonly two persons immediately charged into the Texas Book Depository\r\nBuilding after the shots were fired. They were an officer of the Dallas\r\nPolice Force, Seymour Weitzman, who submitted an affidavit to the\r\nDallas police office, in which he stated that he discovered the rifle\r\non the sixth floor of the Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\nThere was one other gentleman who ran into the building, and that was\r\nRoy S. Truly, who was and is, I believe, the director of the Book\r\nDepository Building.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mr. Truly stated that he believed that the shots came from the\r\ndirection of the overpass and from the grassy knoll. And although he\r\nwas standing directly in front of the Book Depository Building, he did\r\nnot believe that the shots came from that building.\r\n\r\nStanding with him at the time of the assassination was O. V. Campbell,\r\nwho was the vice president of the Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\nIn the Dallas Morning News on November 23, 1963, it was stated that\r\n\"Campbell says he ran toward a grassy knoll to the west of the building\r\nwhere he thought the sniper had hidden.\"\r\n\r\nSo we have two persons that we know of standing in front of the Book\r\nDepository Building, and they both thought that the shots came from the\r\ngrassy knoll near the overpass.\r\n\r\nThe police officer, Seymour Weitzman, submitted an affidavit to the\r\nDallas district attorney's office, he and Mr. Truly, as I indicated\r\na moment ago were the only two who charged into the Book Depository\r\nBuilding when the shots were fired.\r\n\r\nWeitzman indicated in his affidavit--I assume you have the original of\r\nthat affidavit--that he ran \"in a northwest direction, scaled the fence\r\ntoward where we thought the shots came from.\"\r\n\r\nHe indicated \"then someone said they thought the shots came from the\r\nold Texas Building. I immediately ran to the Texas Building and started\r\nlooking inside.\"\r\n\r\nSo even the two people who ran into the building indicated that they\r\ndid not believe the shots came from the building.\r\n\r\nMr. Weitzman went into the building because someone whose name he\r\ndid not give in his affidavit told him to go into the building, and\r\nthen Truly explained that although he thought the shots came from the\r\ngeneral direction of the grassy knoll or the overpass in front of the\r\nPresident's limousine, he saw this officer run into the building, of\r\nwhich he is a director, and he felt that since he knew the building and\r\nthe officer did not, he should go in the building to assist the officer.\r\n\r\nFrom published accounts, and from my investigation, I can only find one\r\nperson who thought that the shots came from the building, and that was\r\nthe Chief of Police in Dallas, Jesse Curry, who said as soon as the\r\nshots were fired, he knew they came from the building. From the Book\r\nDepository Building.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, there were many persons present there whom I have not\r\nquoted, to whom I have no access.\r\n\r\nNow, I spoke on several occasions with the reporter for the Fort Worth\r\nStar Telegram, whose name is Thayer Waldo. Mr. Waldo was standing with\r\na police captain near the Dallas Trade Mart Building, which was the\r\nbuilding, public building, where the President was going to have spoken\r\nthat day. Mr. Waldo was awaiting his arrival, the President's arrival\r\nthere, when a sergeant who was seated in a police cruiser called the\r\ncaptain over hurriedly to the police car. Mr. Waldo accompanied the\r\ncaptain to the police car. And Mr. Waldo stated to me that he heard\r\nthe first bulletin which came over the Dallas police radio, and it was\r\n\"Bulletin. The President has been shot. It is feared that others in his\r\nparty have been wounded. The shots came from a triple overpass in front\r\nof the Presidential automobile.\"\r\n\r\nSo even the police, despite the Chief of Police's later assertion that\r\nhe knew that the shots came from the Book Depository Building, behind\r\nthe Presidential limousine, the first police radio broadcast indicated\r\nthat it was the police position at that time that the shots came from\r\nthe front, not from the rear.\r\n\r\nNow, Patrolman Chaney, who I made reference to a little earlier,\r\nthe motorcycle patrolman, stated that the Presidential car stopped\r\nmomentarily after the first shot. That statement was consistent\r\nwith Miss Woodward's statement in the Dallas Morning News, that the\r\nautomobile came to almost a complete halt after the first shot, and the\r\nstatement of many other witnesses as well.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When was that statement made?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. That statement appeared in the newspaper I made reference to\r\nbefore, the Houston Chronicle, on November 24, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When you made an independent inquiry at any time, would you\r\ntell us, Mr. Lane?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes, I certainly shall do that.\r\n\r\nNow, I think one has to conjecture as to why the Secret Service agent\r\nwho was undoubtedly trained for this assignment, and particularly the\r\nagent who was driving the Presidential limousine in Dallas, where\r\nwe were told that the greatest efforts ever to protect an American\r\nPresident were going to be made that day, because of the previous\r\ndifficulties in Dallas, the attack upon our Ambassador to the United\r\nNations and the attack upon the then Senator Johnson, when he spoke in\r\nDallas in 1960--one would assume that the most qualified Secret Service\r\ndriver that could be secured would be driving that automobile. It is\r\ndifficult to understand why the automobile almost came to a complete\r\nstop after the first shot was fired, if the shots were coming from the\r\nrear. The natural inclination, it would seem, would be to step on the\r\ngas and accelerate as quickly as possible. However, if the driver were\r\nunder the impression that the shots were from the front, one could\r\nunderstand his hesitation in not wanting to drive closer to the sniper\r\nor snipers.\r\n\r\nIn addition, however, Roy Kellerman, who was in the front right-hand\r\nseat of the automobile, who I am told was in charge of the Secret\r\nService operation that day, the director of the Secret Service not\r\nbeing present in Dallas on that occasion--according to the pictures\r\nprinted in Life magazine, Mr. Kellerman looked forward until the first\r\nshot was fired. Then he turned back, and looked at the President. He\r\nimmediately looked forward again, and was looking in the direction of\r\nthe overpass while the second shot was fired, and while the third shot\r\nwas fired.\r\n\r\nOne would certainly expect that Mr. Kellerman was and is a trained\r\nobserver, who would not panic in such a circumstance, for which he has\r\nreceived his training.\r\n\r\nThe pictures I make reference to are those in Life magazine which I\r\nreferred to a little earlier in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask a question there, Mr. Chief Justice?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes, go right ahead, Senator.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. This last statement you made, about the Secret Service\r\nagent who turned, so that he was faced to the rear, toward the\r\nPresident, and then turned forward--I didn't quite understand what you\r\ndeduced from that.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I assumed that he was looking toward the sound of the shots.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You mean when he turned to the rear, or turned ahead?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Well, when the President was shot, and was struck he then\r\nturned around, which I would imagine would be an ordinary response when\r\nsomebody in an automobile with whom you are riding has been shot.\r\n\r\nBut immediately after that, before the second shot was fired, he turned\r\ncompletely to the front, and was looking at the overpass during the\r\nremainder of the time that the shots were fired. It would seem to\r\nindicate to me that it is possible that Mr. Kellerman felt that the\r\nshots were coming from the general direction in which he was looking.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What do you base your statement on that the car stopped,\r\nthe President's limousine?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. The statement made by various witnesses, including Mr.\r\nChaney, a motorcycle policeman, Miss Woodward, who was one of the\r\nclosest witnesses to the President at the time that he was shot, and\r\nothers. I think that is the--I haven't documented that beyond that,\r\nbecause that seemed to be so generally conceded by almost everyone,\r\nthat the automobile came to--almost came to a complete halt after the\r\nfirst shot--did not quite stop, but almost did. And, of course, you\r\nhave the films, I assume, of the assassination and know more about that\r\nthan I do, certainly.\r\n\r\nNow, in reference to the rifle, there is on file--I assume that you\r\nhave it or copies of it--in the Dallas district attorney's office or\r\nthe police office in Dallas, an affidavit sworn to by Officer Weitzman,\r\nin which he indicates that he discovered the rifle on the sixth floor\r\nof the Book Depository Building at, I believe, 1:22 p.m., on November\r\n22, 1963.\r\n\r\nNow, in this affidavit, Officer Weitzman swore that the murder\r\nweapon--that the weapon which he found on the sixth floor was a\r\n7.65 Mauser, which he then went on to describe in some detail, with\r\nreference to the color of the strap, et cetera.\r\n\r\nNow, the prosecuting attorney, of course, took exactly the same\r\nposition, and for hours insisted that the rifle discovered on the sixth\r\nfloor was a German Mauser, adding the nationality. A German Mauser is\r\nnothing at all like an Italian carbine. I think almost any rifle expert\r\nwill indicate that that is so.\r\n\r\nI have been informed that almost every Mauser--and I am not able to\r\ndocument this, unfortunately, but I am sure that you have easy access\r\nto rifle experts--that almost every German Mauser has stamped upon it\r\nthe caliber, as does almost every Italian carbine.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you know the difference between the two?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Do I know the difference?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I know the difference between an Army M-l and an American\r\ncarbine--those are the only two weapons I fired--during the war. No, I\r\ndon't know anything about rifles, other than those two rifles, which I\r\nused at one time.\r\n\r\nI think it is most interesting to note that when Oswald was arrested\r\nwe were informed immediately that he had an alias--his last name was\r\nLee in that alias--as well as a great deal of material about his\r\npolitical background and activities on behalf of the Fair Play for Cuba\r\nCommittee, and his defection to the Soviet Union, et cetera. But the\r\nalias was raised immediately.\r\n\r\nThe following day, on the 23d, when it was announced by the Federal\r\nBureau of Investigation, that Oswald had purchased an Italian carbine,\r\n6.5 millimeters, under the assumed name, A. Hidell, then for the first\r\ntime the district attorney of Dallas indicated that the rifle in his\r\npossession, the alleged murder weapon, had changed both nationality\r\nand size, and had become from a German 7.65 Mauser, an Italian 6.5\r\ncarbine. And, further he indicated then for the first time that they\r\nknew of another alias maintained by Lee Oswald. In addition to the\r\nname Lee, which they discovered, they said, by going to the home where\r\nhe lived--the house where he had lived in Dallas, where he rented a\r\nroom, a rooming house, they discovered there he had secured the room\r\nunder the name Lee. Mr. Wade stated that on Oswald's person, in his\r\npocketbook, was an identification card made out to A. Hidell, and\r\nI have seen pictures of this reproduced in either Time magazine or\r\nNewsweek, or one of the weekly news magazines--I believe it was one or\r\nthe other--with a picture of Oswald appearing on this card, plainly\r\nindicating that Oswald had the alias A. Hidell, to Mr. Wade.\r\n\r\nI think it is interesting that the name Lee as an alias was released\r\nimmediately, although some investigation was required to secure that\r\nalias. But the name A. Hidell, was not released as an alias, although\r\nthat was present and obvious by mere search of Oswald's person when he\r\nwas arrested.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you give us the time of the release of the information\r\nabout the alias, A. Hidell?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. That was on November 23.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. And how about Lee?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. November 22. The first release of the name A. Hidell came\r\nfrom the district attorney's office after the FBI had indicated that\r\nOswald had purchased an Italian carbine under that name.\r\n\r\nIf I were permitted to cross-examine Mr. Wade, which evidently you have\r\ndecided that I shall not be permitted to do, and Officer Weitzman, I\r\nwould seek to find out how about the most important single element in\r\nprobably this case or any other murder case, physical evidence, the\r\nmurder weapon, in a case which I am sure is Mr. Wade's most important\r\ncase--how he could be so completely in error about this.\r\n\r\nMr. Wade is a very distinguished prosecuting attorney, has been one for\r\nsome 13 or 14 years, and I believe was an agent of the Federal Bureau\r\nof Investigation prior to that time.\r\n\r\nI would like to know how he could have been so wrong about something so\r\nvital.\r\n\r\nNow, assuming that the rifle found on the sixth floor was an Italian\r\nrifle, Italian carbine, one must wonder how it was possible for any\r\nnumber of things to happen for it to be fired there three times and\r\nstrike the President in front of the throat, although he was past\r\nthat building, and for the noise, according to the witnesses of the\r\nshooting, to have come from a different place entirely.\r\n\r\nBut in addition to that, one must wonder if that rifle is capable of\r\nthe performance which the prosecuting authorities allege that it gave\r\non that day. An Olympic rifle champion, Hubert Hammerer, said that he\r\ndoubts that it could be done.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Could you give us his address?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. He is not in the United States. The story appeared in the New\r\nYork Times. I don't have the exact date.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What nationality is he?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I don't know.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you know when he was Olympic champion?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No, I don't know that. I do know it probably was some time\r\nafter the Italian carbine was manufactured, since it is an extremely\r\nold weapon, manufactured back in 1938, as I recall. There seems to be\r\nan agreement that the period of time was between 5 and 6 seconds from\r\nthe first shot to the last shot.\r\n\r\nThere is a serious question in the minds, I think, of persons who have\r\nfired that pistol--that rifle--first of all, as to its ability to be\r\nfired that quickly accurately with a telescopic sight, and secondly, in\r\nreference to the ammunition which is available. Various persons have\r\ntested various lots of ammunition. Someone from the National Rifle\r\nAssociation told me that he tested more than 30 rounds, a little over\r\n30 rounds of the Italian 6.5----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When you refer to these people, will you tell us the names\r\nof any of them that you can? It might be of help to us.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I should remember this gentleman, because I just spoke with\r\nhim. That is another name I am going to have to supply for you.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. He is a member of the board of directors of the National\r\nRifle Association. He purchased for one of the television networks some\r\n30 rounds, a little over 30 rounds, and told me that 20 of them did\r\nnot fire at all, and 6 of them were guilty of hanged fire, which is a\r\nphrase I don't know anything about, but he tells me that means it did\r\nnot fire fully, and, therefore, could not be accurate. Therefore, a\r\nvery small percentage of the ammunition was of any value.\r\n\r\nMr. Ed Wallace talked about making a similar test in the New York World\r\nTelegram and Sun, in a feature article, and I think he said that he\r\nwent with an expert, and they got 20 rounds of this ammunition, and of\r\nthose 17 did not fire--only 3 fired. It was very old ammunition.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Who is Ed Wallace, and who is the individual that\r\nEd Wallace referred to? Do you have that information?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I believe Mr. Wallace indicated that he was present when the\r\ntest was made. But it was an article appearing in the New York World\r\nTelegram and Sun within a week after the assassination--from the 23d to\r\nthe 30th of November. And I can secure and mail to you a copy of that\r\narticle, if you prefer.\r\n\r\nWhile there may be some question as to whether or not a rifle expert\r\ncould secure such performance from a rifle, or whether or not one could\r\nsecure enough good ammunition to get such performance, I think there\r\nis general agreement that only in the hands of a rifle expert could\r\none attempt to come close to that kind of shooting that it is alleged\r\nOswald did on November 22.\r\n\r\nThe Times reported on November 23, \"As Marines go, Lee Harvey Oswald\r\nwas not highly regarded as a rifleman.\" And you have in your files,\r\nof course, the scorecard indicating Oswald's marksmanship or lack of\r\nmarksmanship while in the Marine Corps.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, you have the documents given to you by Marguerite\r\nOswald, Lee Oswald's mother, which contained a scorecard maintained by\r\nOswald while in the Marine Corps, showing his score in fast and slow\r\nshooting at various different yardages, in reference to both an M-l, as\r\nI recall, and an American carbine. Now, of course, it has been alleged\r\non occasion that Mr. Oswald practiced with his rifle, on occasion, on\r\nweekends, at rifle ranges.\r\n\r\nMrs. Paine, with whom Lee Oswald's wife lived for the 2 month period\r\npreceding the assassination, and where Lee Oswald himself spent\r\nweekends for that 2 months period preceding the assassination, told me\r\nthat Oswald could not have ever gone to a rifle range on a weekend,\r\nsince she can account for his whereabouts during that entire 2 month\r\nperiod just preceding the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you give us the day of that conversation with Mrs.\r\nPaine?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I have had about five conversations with her. The first one\r\nwould be, oh, I believe, New Year's Day. I think that is the first\r\ntime--this year--I believe that is the first time that she made the\r\nstatement to me. She said she could account for Oswald's whereabouts\r\nduring that 2 month period on weekends, from Friday late afternoon,\r\nwhen he left work in Dallas and arrived there in Irving, until early\r\nMonday morning.\r\n\r\nShe said the exception is during that time--she didn't watch him every\r\nmoment, of course--there might be exceptions when she went shopping for\r\nhalf an hour, and he was left home to take care of the children, her\r\ntwo children, his children. But that unless he ran out quickly into the\r\nback yard with the rifle and shot and then quickly put the rifle away\r\nwhile caring for three children, or four children, that it would be\r\nimpossible for him to practice with the rifle on weekends.\r\n\r\nSince it has been alleged that the rifle was in the garage during the\r\nentire period of time, of course--that was in Irving, Tex., and he was\r\nin Dallas, Tex.--it would have been impossible for him to practice\r\nduring the week while he was in Dallas, with that particular rifle.\r\n\r\nOf course one must zero in a rifle in order to be even fairly accurate\r\nwith it. One must practice with the specific weapon which one is going\r\nto use, in order to have any accuracy, in any event.\r\n\r\nNow, I spoke with Dial M. Ryder, who is a gunsmith in Irving, Tex.,\r\nat the Irving Sport Shop, and he told me that he mounted a telescopic\r\nsight on a rifle for a man named Oswald during October 1963.\r\n\r\nNow, unfortunately, he does not recall--that is around the deer\r\nseason, he informed me, and a lot of people are getting rifles\r\nfixed or repaired or sights mounted on them during that time in the\r\nDallas-Irving area. And he does not recall, therefore, what this\r\ngentleman named Oswald looks like.\r\n\r\nBut he does know that a rifle was brought to him by someone whose name\r\nnow appears in this record as Oswald, and that he drilled three holes\r\nin the rifle for a mount, telescopic mount. He said he had only seen\r\nthree rifles which required three holes for telescopic mount--a 303\r\nBritish Enfield, a 303 American Springfield army surplus rifle, or an\r\nEddystone, which is also an American rifle. He said, therefore, he did\r\nnot attach a telescopic sight to the Italian carbine, because he would\r\nhave only drilled two holes.\r\n\r\nHis employer, I think his name is Greener, he told me, checked with all\r\nthe Oswalds they could find in the Irving area after this matter came\r\nto their attention, and could not find anyone in that area--and they\r\ncalled some people in Dallas also named Oswald--could not find anyone\r\nnamed Oswald who brought the rifle in to him.\r\n\r\nI talked to Milton Klein, who is the owner of Klein's sporting\r\ngoods store in Chicago--Klein's Sporting Goods is the name of the\r\nestablishment, in Chicago.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When was this?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I spoke with him within the last 2 or 3 days. And he told\r\nme that--he runs the mail-order house which sent the carbine, Italian\r\ncarbine, to Dallas, not to Oswald, but to A. Hidell, and that he sent\r\nthat out with the holes already bored in the Italian carbine, and\r\nequipped with a telescopic sight which was already attached to the\r\nrifle.\r\n\r\nAguto Marcelli, who is a correspondent for an Italian publication which\r\nappears physically very much to be like Life magazine, called Leuropeo,\r\nstated to me that he had spoken with Mr. Klein, and Mr. Klein told him\r\nthat the FBI--\"The FBI warned me to keep my trap shut.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. When was this?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. He told me this about 2 weeks ago. When I spoke with Mr.\r\nKlein, about 3 days ago, 2 or 3 days ago, he indicated that he did not\r\nwant to discuss any aspect of this matter with me. And I asked him if\r\nthat was because he was told not to talk with anyone about this case,\r\nand he said yes.\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"Who told you that?\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"The FBI agents told me, ordered me not to discuss this case.\"\r\n\r\nI pointed out to him that if he did not wish to discuss the case\r\nwith me, I would not force him to. There was no way that he would\r\nbe compelled to answer any of the questions that I asked him. But,\r\nhowever, in our democratic society, the FBI cannot order anyone not to\r\ndiscuss a case, and that such an order to him was not a valid order, if\r\nhe wanted to discuss the case with me--he could.\r\n\r\nSo he did. And he told me what I informed you--that the FBI told him\r\nnot to discuss the case, and that he mailed this rifle with the holes\r\nalready bored and with the telescopic sight already mounted to someone\r\nnamed A. Hidell.\r\n\r\nHe also said that \"No ammunition was purchased from me by Hidell at\r\nthat time or since.\"\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did he name any person with the FBI who told him not to\r\ndiscuss the case?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No; he did not.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Can you identify--did he identify him in any way?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. He did not identify him. Earlier, perhaps before you arrived,\r\nSenator, I made reference to a statement made by Mrs. Hill, who was\r\ntold by the Secret Service--I think perhaps you were here--that only\r\nthree shots were fired. And I asked her specifically if she could\r\nidentify that Secret Service agent, and she told me that she could not,\r\nthere was such tremendous confusion at that time, there were so many\r\nagents of the FBI and Secret Service that she spoke to, that she did\r\nnot think she could. But possibly if she saw him, she might be able to\r\nrecognize him.\r\n\r\nI didn't go any further into that question, however, with Mr. Klein. He\r\nseemed very reluctant to discuss that entire area--to discuss anything,\r\nbut particularly that area.\r\n\r\nI read in the Dallas Times Herald, on November 25, 1963, the statement\r\nmade by Mr. Wade, when asked what they had tying Oswald to the\r\n\"crime of the century\" and his response was, according to the Dallas\r\nTimes Herald, \"If I had to single out any one thing, it would be the\r\nfingerprints on the rifle, and the book cartons which he used to prop\r\nthe weapon on.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day the World Telegram and Sun reported \"Federal\r\nauthorities have concluded that no readable print was found on the\r\nmurder weapon when it was flown to Washington for laboratory studies.\"\r\n\r\nThere were certain leaks that a fingerprint or a palm print was\r\ndiscovered on the bolt of the rifle. If that is so, it would be\r\nremarkable if it were a print belonging to anyone other than Captain\r\nFritz of the Homicide Squad in Dallas, because according to the\r\naffidavit signed by Officer Weitzman, who discovered the weapon, and I\r\nam quoting now from the affidavit on file--at that time on file with\r\nthe district attorney's office, \"The time the rifle was found was 1:22\r\np.m. Captain Fritz took charge of the rifle, and ejected one live round\r\nfrom the Chamber. I then went back to the office after this.\"\r\n\r\nNow, you know if you have worked with that rifle that the--on most\r\nItalian carbines that bolt is not worked too easily. One really has to\r\ngrab a hold of it and pull back. It would be unusual if a fingerprint\r\nbelonging to someone other than the person who did that survived.\r\n\r\nThe first statement made by Mr. Wade in reference to the taxi driver\r\nwho he alleged--he, Wade, alleged took Oswald generally from this\r\nscene, indicated that the driver's name was Daryl Click.\r\n\r\nNow, that statement was not made in the first hours of the arrest. That\r\nstatement was not made until after Chief Curry had announced to the\r\npress in Dallas, on that day, November 24th that the case was closed,\r\nthere would be no further investigation--Oswald was the assassin, he\r\nhad acted alone, he was then dead. And as a result of the change in\r\npolicy, to reopen the case and have Mr. Wade assume a position in front\r\nof the radio and television microphones and cameras of the Nation, on\r\nthat evening November 24, Mr. Wade then presented what he said was the\r\nevidence \"for you piece by piece.\" And part of the evidence which he\r\nhad secured was the proof that a taxi driver named Daryl Click drove\r\nOswald roughly from the scene to his home, to Oswald's home.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Dallas--I suppose this was on January 2d, my first trip\r\nthere in reference to this matter--I spoke with a Mr. Roseboro of the\r\nTeamsters Union--they have organized the taxi drivers in Dallas--and\r\nasked him if he knew--if he could give me any information about a Daryl\r\nClick. He said he did not have the name in his files, but Texas being a\r\nright-to-work law State, it is possible, he said, that Mr. Click was a\r\ndriver but not a member of that union. He referred me to the personnel\r\ndepartment of the City Transportation Co., which he told me was the one\r\ncompany monopoly running all the taxis in Dallas.\r\n\r\nI spoke with the City Transportation Co. personnel office, Mr. Pott, as\r\nI recalled, who checked the records, and indicated to me that there was\r\nno Daryl Click who drove a taxi in Dallas.\r\n\r\nSome time after Mr. Wade stated that Daryl Click was the taxi driver,\r\nhe then stated that a person by the name of William Whaley was the taxi\r\ndriver who took Oswald from the scene after he left the bus to his home.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore alleged by the prosecution that Oswald, after firing\r\nupon the Presidential limousine, walked the entire floor from the front\r\nof the Book Depository Building to the rear of the warehouse, almost\r\nto the extreme rear, where he hid the rifle, where it was found, and\r\nthen took the stairs at the rear of the Book Depository Building and\r\nwalked down four flights, until he arrived at the second floor, and\r\nthen he walked to the Coca-Cola machine, which was at the front of the\r\nbuilding, meaning he crossed the entire warehouse floor again, and\r\nhe purchased a Coca-Cola, and was sipping it when a police officer\r\narrived with a gun drawn, questioned him briefly. Mr. Truly explained\r\nto the officer that Oswald worked there. And eventually Oswald left the\r\nbuilding, boarded a bus, then walked, after leaving the bus--walked two\r\nblocks and entered Mr. Whaley's taxi, at exactly 12:30, according to\r\nMr. Whaley. The shots that killed the President were fired at 12:31.\r\n\r\nNow, there is on file in the district attorney's office--I assume you\r\nhave the original or copies of it--a report of a paraffin test taken\r\nof Oswald, of both his hands and his face. The test proved, according\r\nto Mr. Curry, and the statement that he made on Saturday, November\r\n23, to the press that Oswald had fired the murder weapon. However, a\r\nreading of the test indicates that one could come to a very different\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nThe test in reference to the face proved negative, indicating that\r\nOswald had not fired a rifle on November 22, 1963--although the test on\r\nthe hands showed positive--indicating, according to the person who did\r\nthe analysis, the kinds of patterns consistent with one having fired\r\na revolver. That was the statement on the test taken and conducted by\r\na Louis L. Anderson, on November 23, 1963, by the Dallas City County\r\nCrime Investigation Laboratory.\r\n\r\nNow, it has, of course, been alleged that after Oswald shot the\r\nPresident and took a bus and a taxi, and went home and got a jacket,\r\nhe then shot and killed Officer Tippit. The affidavit in the district\r\nattorney's office indicates that a person saw a stopped police car,\r\nwalked up to the police car, leaned on it with his arms on the window,\r\nor what would be a windowsill or window ledge of the automobile, and\r\nthen stepped back a step or two, the officer came out, and this person\r\nshot Officer Tippit to death.\r\n\r\nThe affidavit is peculiarly sparse in reference to the description of\r\nthe assailant, the man who killed Tippit, by an eyewitness who said she\r\nwas just 50 feet away.\r\n\r\nHer description of this person is found in two different portions of\r\nthe affidavit--he was young, white, male, and that is the entire\r\ndescription present in the affidavit at that time.\r\n\r\nI spoke with the deponent, the eyewitness, Helen Louise Markham,\r\nand Mrs. Markham told me--Miss or Mrs., I didn't ask her if she was\r\nmarried--told me that she was a hundred feet away from the police\r\ncar, not the 50 feet which appears in the affidavit. She gave to me\r\na more detailed description of the man who she said shot Officer\r\nTippit. She said he was short, a little on the heavy side, and his\r\nhair was somewhat bushy. I think it is fair to state that an accurate\r\ndescription of Oswald would be average height, quite slender, with thin\r\nand receding hair.\r\n\r\nHelen Markham said to me that she was taken to the police station on\r\nthat same day, that she was very upset, she of course had never seen\r\nanyone killed in front of her eyes before, and that in the police\r\nstation she identified Oswald as the person who had shot Officer Tippit\r\nin the lineup, including three other persons. She said no one pointed\r\nOswald out to her--she was just shown four people, and she picked\r\nOswald.\r\n\r\nShe said--when I asked her how she could identify him--she indicated\r\nshe was able to identify him because of his clothing, a gray jacket and\r\ndark trousers. And this was the basis for her identification--although\r\nOswald physically does not meet the description which she indicated.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When did you have this conversation with the\r\ndeponent?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Within the last 5 days.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Some time in late February 1964?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Or perhaps even early March, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nNow, I inquired--I told her that I was coming here today, and that I\r\nwas completing my investigation as Oswald's lawyer, and asked her if\r\nshe would discuss the matter with me, and she said she would.\r\n\r\nI asked her if anyone had asked her not to discuss this matter with me.\r\nAt first she seemed reluctant, and she said she was reluctant because\r\nI called her at her place of employment, the Eat Well Cafe in Dallas.\r\nI tried her at home many times before then, but her phone was always\r\nbusy. I believe it is a phone which is not her personal one, but is a\r\ncommon phone shared by others in the building where she resides.\r\n\r\nI apologized for calling her at her place of employment. And she seemed\r\nreluctant to talk to me. I asked if anyone had asked her not to talk\r\nabout this case with anyone. She said yes, she had been told by the\r\nFBI, by Secret Service agents, and by Dallas police, all three groups,\r\nnot to discuss anything in relation to this case, and that by and large\r\nshe had not.\r\n\r\nI told her that somewhere it occurred to me that I had seen an article\r\nin a newspaper in which she described the assailant of Oswald as short,\r\nstocky, and with bushy hair--I'm sorry, the assailant of Tippit--as\r\nbeing short, stocky, with bushy hair. And she said she did talk to a\r\nreporter, she thinks, for one of the Dallas newspapers, the Dallas\r\nTimes-Herald or the Dallas Morning News--but that is the only time she\r\ntalked to anybody.\r\n\r\nI would like to call to the Commission's attention the entire brief\r\nnarrative of the entire case, as presented by the district attorney's\r\noffice at this point, or at least on the 24th, because it seems to me\r\nto be so full of incredible happenings, that it would be very difficult\r\nto submit such a story to a jury by a prosecution generally.\r\n\r\nIf everything that the prosecution in this case says is true, one must\r\nconclude that Oswald behaved in a very, very unusual manner from the\r\nbeginning to the end.\r\n\r\nHe decided on Thursday, November 21, that he was going to assassinate\r\nthe President, and so he decided to go back to Irving, Tex., to secure\r\na rifle there, in order to carry out that purpose. He had on his person\r\nsome $13 when arrested, and almost $150 in cash in the top drawer\r\nof his dresser--so we can assume that on Thursday, the 21st, he had\r\nroughly that amount of money present.\r\n\r\nOne can purchase a rifle for less than $13 in many stores in Dallas.\r\nThere is no question about that. By using a small portion of that $150,\r\nhe could have purchased a rifle absolutely superior to the Italian\r\ncarbine at home in Irving in many respects. And there are gun magazines\r\nwhich have had editorials dwelling on this question, saying that if\r\nOswald did it with this weapon, and they do not move into the question\r\nof whether or not he did, it was an absolute miracle, because no one\r\nwho knew anything about rifles would have chosen such a decrepit,\r\nworthless rifle, as this Italian carbine, manufactured in 1938, for\r\nwhich there is such pure ammunition. There are a series, I believe, of\r\neditorials in gun magazines proving that Oswald, I think, as a matter\r\nof pride, from a sportsman's viewpoint--that Oswald was in no way\r\nassociated with weapons and did not belong in that category, because he\r\ncould not have chosen such a weapon.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Could you give us the citations of one of these\r\nmagazines?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes. One is called Gun Magazine. I do not recall the names.\r\nBut that is one of them. I am sure there was such an editorial in that\r\none. I will get the other one and mail those to you also.\r\n\r\nBut I think there would have to be a more compelling reason for Oswald\r\nnot to go home and get that particular inferior rifle if he decided on\r\nThursday to kill the President. That was the only rifle in the whole\r\nworld probably that could be traced to him. One can purchase a rifle\r\nin almost any community in this country, certainly in Dallas, without\r\nany notoriety attaching to it, without giving one's name or address, or\r\nhaving a serial number attached to a receipt kept by a store indicating\r\nwho owns that particular rifle.\r\n\r\nBut here we have Oswald going home to get an inferior rifle, which\r\nrifle is the only rifle in the whole world which can be traced to him,\r\nwhich rifle he is going to leave behind as a calling card after the\r\nassassination is complete.\r\n\r\nAnd so he goes home to Irving, Tex., and he gets this rifle, and\r\nhe wraps it up in paper, we are told, and brings it in to the Book\r\nDepository Building.\r\n\r\nNow, the rifle can be broken down, I believe, from examining other\r\nItalian carbines. But it would be not much shorter if it was broken\r\ndown--perhaps 6 or 7 inches shorter. Evidently, though, he did not do\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nSo he took this rifle into the book depository building, which I\r\nsuggest, gentlemen, is a most remarkable thing. This was going to be\r\nthe greatest series of precautions in the history of the United States\r\nto protect an American President. As we know now, and suspected then,\r\nwith very good reason, because of the nature of what had gone before,\r\nwith reference to public officials in Dallas--and here we have a\r\nman who has defected to the Soviet Union, who has married a Russian\r\nnational, active on behalf of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, we\r\nsee a discharge less than honorable from the U.S. Marine Corps, who\r\nwas working in the building exactly on the Presidential route. Not\r\nonly is it on the Presidential route, but it is the building where the\r\nautomobile is going to have to clearly slow down because of the sharp\r\nturn, sharp left turn, made right in front of the building.\r\n\r\nAnd despite all of these precautions--and I have been informed that\r\nthere were serious precautions taken in Dallas on that day by the\r\nDallas police and by others, and that persons who did no more publicly,\r\nwho did no more ever politically than to publicly speak in favor of\r\nschool integration, were followed that day as potential assassins in\r\nDallas.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Oswald, with that background, is permitted to walk into\r\nthe Book Depository Building, directly on the Presidential route,\r\ncarrying with him in his hand a full rifle.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Can you tell us the information on which you base this,\r\nabout anyone who merely spoke about school integration?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes. A reporter for the Dallas Morning News told me that,\r\ntold me he was absolutely certain that was so. But before revealing\r\nhis name, I am going to have to call him and indicate I am going to do\r\nthat. I will be happy to do that. I am glad you are interested in that\r\nmatter, because I think it is a most important one.\r\n\r\nI suggest that the Federal Bureau of Investigation knew that Oswald\r\nworked at the Texas Book Depository Building, which was on the\r\nPresidential route. An FBI agent by the name of Hosty visited the home\r\nof the Paines in Irving, Tex., sometime during September and October.\r\nHe visited that home on more than one occasion. Each of the at least\r\ntwo times that he was there, possibly three but I am not certain--but\r\nI was told he was there two times--I know I was told by Mrs. Paine\r\nin the presence of her husband, Michael Paine, that Agent Hosty was\r\nthere at least on two occasions--each time he was there he asked\r\nwhere Oswald was. Mrs. Paine explained to Agent Hosty, she told me,\r\nthat Oswald lived there only on weekends, and that during the week\r\nAgent Hosty could find him at his room in Dallas, where he stayed\r\nduring the week, or during the daytime could find him at the Texas Book\r\nDepository Building, where he was an employee. Nevertheless--and that\r\nOswald would not be found in Irving, Tex. at the Paine's home during\r\nthe week. Nevertheless, Agent Hosty returned again at least one more\r\ntime to the Paine home in Irving, during the week, during the day,\r\nI believe--certainly during the week--and again asked about Oswald,\r\nand again Mrs. Paine told him that he worked at the Book Depository\r\nBuilding, he would not be there, she said, \"As we told you last time\r\nhe won't be here during the week. During the daytime during the week\r\nyou can find him at his job at the Book Depository Building, and during\r\nthe nighttime during the week you can find him at his rooming house in\r\nDallas.\"\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Did she tell you whether she told him where the rooming\r\nhouse was?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I do not believe I asked her that question, and I don't\r\nbelieve she mentioned that.\r\n\r\nWell, to go back to the prosecution narrative, or narrative according\r\nto the facts presented by the prosecution, Oswald was on the sixth\r\nfloor, fired at the Presidential limousine, not as the automobile\r\napproached the building, when the automobile came extremely close to\r\nthe building, so close that possibly even with that weapon one could\r\nhave shot occupants of the automobile from that window--but it is\r\nalleged that Oswald never shot--it is now alleged that Oswald never\r\nshot when the automobile was right outside of the building, but fired\r\nwhen the automobile was some 75 yards beyond the building, when the\r\nfirst shot was fired.\r\n\r\nThen Oswald walked the entire floor--or ran--the entire floor of the\r\nwarehouse to the rear of the building, placing the rifle in between\r\nsome boxes, but visible, so that one can see it when one arrives on\r\nthe floor; went to the rear stairs, walked down the four flights to\r\nthe second floor, then to the front of the building again, where he\r\npurchased a Coca-Cola--made no effort to leave the building at that\r\ntime, evidently was going to wait until the building was surrounded by\r\npolice before leaving.\r\n\r\nHe stayed at the top of the stairs near the Coke machine long enough so\r\nthat a police officer could come up and place a pistol near him, and\r\nRoy Truly, the director, then intervened indicating that Mr. Oswald was\r\nemployed at the building at that time, and the officer then went on to\r\ndo other things in the building, including later on, I believe, to find\r\nthe rifle, if it was the same officer.\r\n\r\nMr. Truly stated that Oswald was quite calm when the officer approached\r\nhim on the stairs. He said although he did seem a little concerned\r\nabout that pistol being stuck at him--but otherwise he seemed quite\r\ncalm at that time.\r\n\r\nWell----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Where was this statement made, or testimony given?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. By Truly?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. This was reported very widely in probably dozens or scores\r\nof newspapers. The New York Times carried that, as did many other\r\npublications--direct quotations from Truly who was interviewed.\r\n\r\nThen the next thing we heard from the prosecution in their opening or\r\nclosing statement to the television cameras, after Oswald was killed\r\nwas that--the next we hear of Oswald he was on a bus. Well, if Oswald\r\nboarded the bus where the busdriver claims he did, then Oswald walked a\r\ndistance, in order to secure a bus which is going to take him directly\r\nback to the Book Depository Building, which one would think he was\r\ntrying to flee after assassinating the President.\r\n\r\nI would refer you to his story by Hugh Ainsworth in the Dallas Morning\r\nNews published during the first week after the assassination. Hugh\r\nAinsworth and Larry Grove published on November 28 in the Dallas\r\nMorning News--this is headed \"Oswald Planned To Ride By Scene\"--in\r\nwhich there are statements from the busdriver that--named C. J.\r\nMcWatters, in which Mr. McWatters indicates that Oswald entered the bus\r\nat Elm and Griffin, and further indicates that the bus was going to\r\ngo seven blocks further west and turn at Houston Street, exactly the\r\nscene of the assassination, or at least the scene of the Texas Book\r\nDepository. So Oswald traveled somehow some seven blocks in order to\r\nsecure a bus which is going to take him back to the place that he left.\r\n\r\nNow, although I have talked to Mr. Ainsworth, and he tells me that the\r\nstory is absolutely correct, and he questioned Mr. McWatters quite\r\nthoroughly, and he will so testify, I believe, if he is asked--Mr.\r\nAinsworth will--and the affidavit which Mr. McWatters signed, or which\r\nthe busdriver signed, he does not state that Oswald walked seven blocks\r\nand was going to get on a bus which was going to take him back. Indeed,\r\nhe states that he picked him up about Elm and Houston Street, at the\r\nBook Depository Building. But the busdriver indicates that that story\r\nin his affidavit is not true. He indicated that after the affidavit was\r\ndrawn and signed by him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. What did you say was not true, Mr. Lane--which part of it?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. The affidavit. Mr. McWatters indicates that the affidavit in\r\nwhich--let me start that again.\r\n\r\nThere is an affidavit from the busdriver, which I am sure you have,\r\nwhich shows that according to his statement Oswald came into the bus\r\nat Elm and Houston Street. However, the busdriver since that time has\r\nindicated that Oswald came into the bus seven blocks from Elm and\r\nHouston Street, and had entered a bus which was going to take him\r\nto Elm and Houston Street. Elm and Houston Street of course is the\r\nlocation of the Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, when you say since that time he has indicated that,\r\nyou mean to you or to someone else?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. To those two reporters for the Dallas Morning News with whom\r\nI discussed--one of them--I discussed this specifically. And he said\r\nthat every word in that story is absolutely accurate, that he went to\r\nsee the busdriver, and had a prolonged interview with him, and went\r\nover this in great detail with him. I think these two reporters will\r\ntestify as to what the busdriver told them in their interview with him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. But they have not published this later story that you are\r\ntelling about.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes, they have. That is the date that I gave you. The Dallas\r\nMorning News, on Thursday, November 28, under the headline \"Oswald\r\nPlanned To Ride By Scene\".\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you want to leave that with us?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I wonder if copies can be made of everything.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Then I will be happy to leave it.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. The story you were just referring to in the Dallas Morning\r\nNews is Commission Exhibit 343.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 343 for\r\nidentification and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. That's correct.\r\n\r\nWell, now, Oswald allegedly had shot the President and has walked some,\r\ntalked to an officer, was calm, walked some seven blocks to find a bus\r\nwhich was going to take him back to where he left, and then got off and\r\ngot--entered into a taxi after he had walked some two blocks from where\r\nhe left the bus. And this taxi he entered of course a minute before the\r\nPresident was shot, if the taxi driver's log is accurate--after Oswald\r\nhad done all these things, after allegedly shooting the President and\r\nthe Governor.\r\n\r\nThen the taxi driver drove him directly past his own home, according to\r\nthe statement and--past Oswald's Dallas rooming house, until he arrived\r\nat a scene about a half a mile beyond Oswald's house, where Oswald then\r\nleft the taxi, and then walked or ran home to secure a jacket--leaving\r\nbehind, although one would assume he is now giving considering to\r\nescaping, the $150 in the dresser drawer, and taking just his jacket\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Which dresser drawer?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. This is in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Not at the Paine's?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Not at the Paine's. I do not know if there was money at the\r\nPaine's, but if he had money there, he left that behind the night\r\nbefore, knowing he was going to----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. But the $150 you are speaking of was in his rooming house\r\nat Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have any affidavit or information in support of that\r\nstatement about the $150?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I do not have an affidavit. I have the statement of a\r\nreporter who was told that--he was told this by a police officer who\r\nwas present when the money was found in the Dallas rooming house. I\r\nhave his statement. I can again ask for his permission to release that.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Would you do that, please.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Mr. Chairman--perhaps it has been done, but I think it\r\nwould be proper in all cases in which he has referred to conversations\r\nthat he has had with individuals who made statements to him about some\r\naspect of this matter, and whose names he has not identified, that if\r\nhe could give to the Commission in all of those cases the names of the\r\nindividuals who gave him this information.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I mean at sometime--don't you think?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes, sir, it would be very helpful.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes, sir. I think there are only two occasions where I\r\nindicated I had to check the source, and one is the name of the rifle\r\nassociation board member whose name I will be happy to give to you, but\r\nI just do not recall it--my office has that.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I did not remember that you gave the name of this\r\nindividual who told you that some policeman had told him that he had\r\nbeen present when the $150 was found.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; that is one.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you give that name?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No; I did not give that name.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You said you were going to ask him his permission.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; that's correct.\r\n\r\nThen Oswald took a taxi, which took him approximately a half mile\r\nbeyond his own house, his own room in Dallas, and he either walked or\r\nran back to get his jacket--although it was a very warm day in Dallas.\r\nThat day Mrs. Kennedy said later on that, reviewing the moment before\r\nthe President was shot--she said she saw this overpass ahead and looked\r\nforward to being under it for a moment because there would be some\r\nbrief shade to protect them from the powerful sun that day.\r\n\r\nWell, Oswald ran home to get his jacket. He left the house, saw\r\na police car parked, went up to the police car, according to the\r\naffidavit of Mrs. Markham, leaned on the car, and when the officer\r\ncame out, he shot him to death, and then he went to the movies. And in\r\nthe movies, and just before he went into the Texas Theatre, he was so\r\nextremely agitated that a gentleman on the outside of the theatre--I\r\nthink his name is John Brewer--I am not certain--you have that\r\naffidavit, I am sure--indicated that Oswald was acting very agitated,\r\nthe cashier made the same statement, and changing from seat to seat.\r\nThe police were called and he was arrested.\r\n\r\nOf course, one would wonder why Oswald, who might have thought that\r\nhe had made his getaway while in the Texas Theatre unobserved, would\r\nbecome so extremely agitated, when just a moment after he allegedly\r\nshot the President and the Governor, with the policeman charging up the\r\nstairs, pointing a pistol at him, about to arrest him for these two\r\nterrible crimes, he was calm, according to Mr. Truly, but he became\r\nagitated only when he thought he had secured his getaway.\r\n\r\nI think those of us who saw, as we all did, I guess, Oswald on\r\ntelevision in his brief appearance would conclude that he seemed, even\r\nwhile in custody and charged with these two crimes, somewhat calm under\r\nthe circumstances--calm when charged with the assassination, calm a\r\nmoment after killing the President, when a policeman pointed a pistol\r\nat him, but agitated only in the theatre, and just before going to the\r\ntheatre when he might have concluded that he was then in the clear.\r\n\r\nI would just like to conclude on this note.\r\n\r\nI hope the Commission will give consideration to my request, which the\r\nCommission has answered, but which again I would like at this time to\r\nrenew. That is, that I be permitted, at the request of Mrs. Oswald,\r\nthe mother of the accused defendant, really, before this Commission's\r\nhearing, to represent his interests here, to have access to the\r\nmaterial which you have access to, and the right to present witnesses.\r\n\r\nIt is not usual for an attorney representing a party to be given an\r\nopportunity to testify, which is quite unusual--but rather to be given\r\nthe opportunity to present witnesses and to cross-examine them. It has\r\ngenerally been my role in criminal cases. Never before have I testified\r\nin behalf of a client.\r\n\r\nIf it is the Commission's position that this is not a trial in any\r\nrespect, and therefore Oswald is not entitled to counsel, that is the\r\nposition with which I would like to respectfully offer a dissent.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Oswald is not going to have a real trial flows only from\r\nhis death, and he is not responsible with that having taken place.\r\nEvery right belonging to an American citizen charged with a crime was\r\ntaken from him up to and including his life.\r\n\r\nI think now that that episode is completed, hopefully never to reappear\r\never again in our history, or anything close to it--I think it would\r\nbe proper to permit him to have counsel before the Commission, counsel\r\nwho can function on his behalf in terms of cross-examining evidence and\r\npresenting witnesses. If it is the Commission's position now that he is\r\nentitled to counsel, and the Commission will appoint counsel, then I\r\nask the Commission to consider that the Constitutional right to counsel\r\ninvolves the right to counsel of one's choice, or in the event of the\r\ndeath of a party, to counsel of the choice of the surviving members of\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\nIf Marina Oswald, the widow, sought to have counsel represent her\r\nhusband I would think--here--I would think that would cause a conflict\r\nand a problem, if the widow and also the mother made the same request.\r\nBut as I understand it no request has been made by the widow, who\r\nhas indicated to the press that she believes her husband is guilty,\r\nand through her former business agent, Mr. Martin, who I am told\r\nwas secured for her by the Secret Service as a business agent, she\r\nindicated that even a trial which might prove he was innocent, she\r\nwould still be sure he was guilty, and has indicated since that time\r\nno desire to my knowledge to secure counsel for her husband, her late\r\nhusband, before the Commission.\r\n\r\nI think, then, the mother would, in almost any jurisdiction, be the\r\nnext person to make a decision in this area, and the mother has made a\r\ndecision, as you know. She has retained me to represent the rights and\r\ninterests of her son.\r\n\r\nI think under those circumstances it would be proper for the Commission\r\nto permit me to participate.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, is not a jury trial. With all due respect to the\r\nintegrity and background of each of the members of the Commission,\r\nI suggest that it is not the function of the trying body to appoint\r\ncounsel, or the jury to appoint counsel, but in our society it is just\r\nthe reverse; it is the function of defense counsel to participate in\r\ndetermining who the jury should be.\r\n\r\nMany criminal lawyers, very noted counsel, would probably seek to\r\nexcuse certain--and again no disrespect at all is meant to the\r\nbackground of members of this Commission--but defense counsel generally\r\nseeks to excuse as jurors those who are in any way associated with\r\nthe Government in a criminal case. And here we have the Government\r\nappointing the jury, and then the jury picking counsel, who also is\r\nGovernment connected at this time. I in no way wish to raise the\r\nquestion of the integrity of any of the members of the Commission\r\nor counsel or anyone else, or their ability. But that truism about\r\nequality has some meaning in terms of impartiality--everyone is\r\nimpartial to some people, and more impartial to other people. And\r\ncounsel, in order to function, I believe, must be totally independent\r\nand totally committed to the responsibility of representing his client.\r\n\r\nBut above all, he must be secured by someone who has the ability to\r\nspeak for the deceased, in this case his mother and his wife. And under\r\nthose circumstances, I renew my request that I be permitted to, at the\r\nrequest of Lee Oswald's mother, who survives him--to function before\r\nthis Commission as counsel on his behalf.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Lane, I must advise you that the Commission, as you\r\nalready know, has considered your request and has denied it. It does\r\nnot consider you as the attorney for Lee Oswald. Now, this is not for\r\nany discussion. We are not going to argue it. You have had your say,\r\nand I will just answer.\r\n\r\nLee Oswald left a widow. She is his legal representative. She is\r\nrepresented by counsel. This Commission is cooperating with her in\r\nany way she may request. If anyone else wants to present any evidence\r\nto this Commission, they may do so. But it is the view and the\r\nwish--the will of the Commission--that no one else shall be entitled to\r\nparticipate in the work and the deliberations of the Commission.\r\n\r\nWe asked you to come here today because we understood that you did have\r\nevidence. We are happy to receive it. We want every bit of evidence\r\nthat you have. You may present anything that you wish to us. But you\r\nare not to be a participant in the work of the Commission. I assume you\r\nhave some questions you would like to ask Mr. Lane, Mr. Rankin?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes, sir. Do you have any affidavits that you would like\r\nto submit to the Commission? I understood at one time you had some\r\naffidavits.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Well, I do have some affidavits. They are not originals--they\r\nare photostatic copies of affidavits taken by the Dallas police and\r\non file in the Dallas district attorney's office. Now--including the\r\nparaffin test which I made reference to.\r\n\r\nNow, if the Commission does not have copies of those, I would like to\r\nbe so informed and I will see what I can do. I assume the Commission\r\nhas copies of all those documents.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Yes. Do you have anything beyond that that you care to\r\nsubmit?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I have the various statements which I have made reference to\r\nfrom Mrs. Hill and Mrs. Markham, Mr. Klein, Mr. Ryder. But I have given\r\nyou the essence of those statements. If you are interested in pursuing\r\nthat, I think it might be best to call them.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I am interested if there was anything beyond what you have\r\ngiven us, Mr. Lane. And if you say you have given us the substance,\r\nthen I take it that is complete as far as it could be of assistance to\r\nus, except our going directly to the witness. Is that what you have in\r\nmind?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, do you have any witnesses that you would like to\r\npresent for the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Well, I would like--I do not know that I would be able to do\r\nthat, frankly.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Well, would you have any that you suggest that we should\r\ninterview, bring before the Commission, that you have not presented up\r\nto this time in your testimony?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No; there is no one who I know of other than those names I\r\nhave given, and two other persons whose permission I am going to have\r\nto secure in reference to other matters, and hopefully they will be\r\nwilling to not only allow their names to be used, but to come forward\r\nand testify, if you wish to hear them.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, is there any documentary evidence beyond which you\r\nhave submitted that you would like to submit to the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Not beyond what I have submitted or made reference to.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. In regard to the paraffin that you have referred to, do\r\nyou have any particular materials or anything you want to refer the\r\nCommission to?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. To that particular test taken by Mr. Anderson on November 23d?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Anything beyond that?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No; not at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Now, I understand at one time you referred to some meeting\r\nin the Carousel Club a week or so before the assassination. Do you have\r\nany material on that or any information?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is there anything you would care to present to the\r\nCommission?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes. I have been informed--and this is the source I will have\r\nto check with again in order to secure his testimony----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You will advise us if you are permitted to.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes. But I can tell you the substance--that a meeting took\r\nplace on November 14, 1963, in the Carousel Club between Officer Tippit\r\nand Bernard Weissman, Mr. Weissman being the gentleman who placed a\r\nfull-page advertisement in the Dallas Morning News which was printed on\r\nNovember 22, asking a series of questions of President Kennedy. It was\r\naddressed \"Welcome to Dallas, President Kennedy. Why have you traded\r\nthe Monroe Doctrine for spirit of Moscow. Why has Gus Hall and the\r\nCommunist Party endorsed your 1964 election\" and such matter. I think\r\nthese two give a rather clear indication of the kind of advertisement\r\nthat it was. And I have been informed that Mr. Weissman and Officer\r\nTippit and a third person were present there. I have been given the\r\nname of the third person. But for matters which I will make plain to\r\nthe Commission, I will be pleased to give you the name of the third\r\nperson as given to me, but not in the presence of the press. I would\r\nrather do that in executive session--that one piece of testimony.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That is satisfactory to do that, if you wish.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is there anything else about that incident that you know\r\nand want to tell the Commission at this time?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That is the entire story, is it?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. That they were there for more than 2 hours conferring--these\r\nthree persons.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Your information does not--is not to the effect as to\r\nwhat they were conferring on.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No; they did not hear that.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. I am not suggesting, Mr. Lane, that you have been selective\r\nabout what you have told the Commission and what you have not told, but\r\nI do wish to make the inquiry as to whether there is any information\r\nyou might have that the Commission should be informed of as to other\r\npeople that you might have interviewed in regard to this matter.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I have given the Commission at this time everything that I\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Is there anything about the palm prints that you can tell\r\nus in addition to what you have given us?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Not in addition to what I have said.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Well, I will ask you generally--is there anything in\r\naddition to what you have said that you would like to tell the\r\nCommission at this time that has any bearing upon this investigation?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. All I can say in reference to that, Mr. Rankin, is that I\r\nam practically engaged in this project by myself, which means I am\r\nextremely limited. This is not my profession--investigator. I am an\r\nattorney. And there are many leads which I have followed, which have\r\nled me nowhere at all, obviously. Before finding Mrs. Markham or before\r\nfinding Mrs. Hill, there were many other persons I talked to who were\r\nnot even present, who I have heard were present. But there are still\r\nlarge numbers, probably at this point hundreds of leads which I have\r\nheard of, and which I have not yet been able to trace or to check\r\nthrough. I do not think it would be constructive just to tell you all\r\nof the things I have heard, because most of them are patently untrue,\r\nand they just require a great deal of work. But I will continue to do\r\nthat, and should I come across any material which might in any way\r\ninterest you, I will certainly either write to you for the purpose of\r\npresenting it to you through the mail in affidavit form, if you prefer,\r\nor indicate that I will be available to come and testify again if you\r\nprefer that.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Lane, your client, Mrs. Marguerite Oswald, when she\r\nwas testifying before us, told us that she had sold some pictures to\r\nthe press and she wanted the originals of all the pictures that she\r\npresented to us, because she said they were of great financial value to\r\nher. Do you know what sales she has made concerning pictures such as\r\nyou have shown us?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. In terms of the picture with the rifle, you mean, for example?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, we might start with that.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. She has never seen such a picture, she has informed me, of\r\nLee Harvey Oswald with the rifle--except after they had been published.\r\nShe never had any knowledge of such pictures, and had never seen them.\r\n\r\nI do not really represent Marguerite Oswald. She has retained me to\r\nrepresent the interests of her son. And so in her business dealings in\r\nterms of her sale of pictures and articles, I have not represented her.\r\nI believe she has a literary agent or perhaps even another lawyer--I\r\ndon't know. But she has retained me to represent her son's interests,\r\nnot to represent her at all.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Of course, we have conferred. But I do not have that\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Mr Lane, I have a further question. Have you ever been\r\nprevented by any law enforcement officer from interviewing anyone\r\nconcerning this matter when you wished to?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Well, I would say that I have been prevented by the\r\nstatements made by the law enforcement persons or agents to the\r\nindividual, that he should not talk to anyone about this case, that it\r\nis a secret matter. As I have indicated, Mr. Klein----\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You have described those cases, have you?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I have also spoken to a reporter who is employed by a Dallas\r\nnewspaper, who informed me that he sought to question more than 150 in\r\nthe area, and that many of those persons informed him that they were\r\nordered by the FBI not to talk to anyone about this case, and that\r\nalmost none of the witnesses would talk with him about the case, and\r\nthat some of them, when he asked the reason that they were not talking\r\nto him, it was \"Was this because you have been told by the FBI?\"--and\r\nhe indicated they were not even allowed to answer that question. But\r\nmany of them told him that the FBI or the Secret Service ordered them\r\nnot to talk. In no other respect have I been interfered with to my\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Do you have the name of that reporter--can you reveal that\r\nto us?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I cannot reveal it at this time, but I am hopeful you will\r\npermit me to. He is one of the reporters I referred to earlier.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Senator, do you have any questions?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. No; I have no questions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Rhyne.\r\n\r\nMr. RHYNE. Mr. Chief Justice--I wanted to ask Mr. Lane, on his inquiry\r\nabout what happened to Oswald during the 48 hours he was under\r\ndetention--you suggested that the Commission make an inquiry into\r\nwhether his civil rights were denied. Do you have any information on\r\nthat subject?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes. I saw what happened--I read in the newspapers and heard\r\non the radio.\r\n\r\nMr. RHYNE. It looked to me that most of the material presented here\r\ntoday was really in the newspapers. You are merely repeating what\r\nsomeone else has said.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I don't think that is an accurate characterization of my\r\ntestimony at all, sir. For example, I told you before of conversations\r\nthat I have had--I know you listened intently--I told you of\r\nconversations that I had with Mr. Klein. I told you of conversations\r\nI had with Miss Hill, who is probably the closest eyewitness to the\r\nassassination, with Miss Woodward, who is perhaps the second or third\r\nclosest witness to the assassination, with Dial Ryder, with at least\r\ntwo or three other persons.\r\n\r\nMr. RHYNE. But on this one point, with respect to denial of any civil\r\nrights or protection of civil rights during this 48-hour period, you\r\nsay that is all in the newspaper stories?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No. What I meant by that response was that the basic denial\r\nthat I was discussing was the development of the case publicly against\r\nhim, so that it would be impossible in securing a jury panel to secure\r\n12 jurors probably anywhere in this country who had not reached a\r\nconclusion, first of all. And secondly, obviously the death of the\r\naccused, which I know is a matter for the Commission's inquiry already.\r\n\r\nMr. RHYNE. I notice that you said your investigation was incomplete. So\r\nI just wanted to be sure that I understood what you meant with respect\r\nto this 48-hour detention period.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No; I have no knowledge over and above that that I could give\r\nyou in that area.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Murray, do you have any questions you would like to\r\nask?\r\n\r\nMr. MURRAY. No; I have none, Mr. Chief Justice, at this time.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, Mr. Lane, if any evidence should come to your\r\nattention in the future, would you be willing to convey the information\r\nto the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; I certainly would, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. We will appreciate it if you would. Thank you for your\r\nattendance.\r\n\r\nWe will adjourn at this time.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 5:35 p.m., the President's Commission adjourned, and\r\nreconvened in executive session.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MR. LANE RESUMED IN EXECUTIVE SESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The session will be in order.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. Will you proceed, Mr. Lane, in executive session now, to\r\ndescribe the names?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. The third name that I was informed--the person that I was\r\ninformed was there, the third person, is named Jack Ruby. It was my\r\nfeeling, of course, while his case was pending it would not be proper\r\nto comment on that in the presence of the press.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. You mean the third person in the group apparently\r\nconferring?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes. Tippit, Weissman, and Ruby.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Have you made any public statement of this kind before on\r\nthis subject--about this meeting?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Not about Ruby--about a meeting between Weissman and Tippit,\r\nyes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. But you never named Ruby publicly?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. No; I have not. I shall not.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I see. Do you know any way by which we might corroborate\r\nthat meeting--the fact that it was held?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I am going this evening to see, or tomorrow--I will try this\r\nevening first--to see if I can secure permission by my informant to\r\nreveal his name, and I hope he will be willing to come forward and\r\ntestify as to what took place.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission would like to know it, if you can do that.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes; I shall inform you as soon as I discover that. I would\r\nlike very much for the Commission to have that information. Can I\r\nindicate to my informant that the matter can be so raised so that his\r\nname will not be known to anyone other than the Commission?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes, sir; you may.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. That will be extremely helpful.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. If you can think of any way that can be corroborated, it\r\nwould be most helpful to us.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I understand.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Congressman, you just got in as we are about to adjourn.\r\nMr. Lane was telling us of one piece of information that he had\r\nconcerning a meeting that was held at the Carousel Nightclub, about a\r\nweek, did you say----\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. About a week before the assassination, at which the man\r\nwho financed this full-page article in the paper, Dallas paper, this\r\nmorning, concerning President Kennedy, and Officer Tippit, and he told\r\nus in private here--he didn't want to mention it before the press--Jack\r\nRuby. And he tells us that he will try to find out from his informant\r\nmore about that, and if he possibly can deliver the information to us.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask one question?\r\n\r\nI assume from what you have said you wouldn't be able to answer it, but\r\nwas there any reason ascribed for the presence of Tippit?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. My informant does not know the reason.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Or Ruby, with Weissman?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. My informant does not know that information.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. May I ask a question, Mr. Chief Justice? When did\r\nthis information come to your attention, Mr. Lane?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Some weeks ago.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you consider the informant a reliable,\r\nresponsible person?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Yes. I cannot vouch, of course, for the information\r\npersonally, but I believe the informant is a reliable and a responsible\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Would your informant be willing, as far as you\r\nknow--be willing to testify and give the Commission this information\r\ndirectly?\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. I am going to try to arrange that this evening. The Chief\r\nJustice has indicated that his name would not be known if he did that,\r\nand that I did not know that I could make that statement to him before\r\nnow. I hope that will be decisive.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Is there anything further, gentlemen?\r\n\r\nIf not----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. May I ask, Mr. Chairman, are we going to have a\r\nschedule laid out, are we going to have a meeting of the Commission\r\nwhere maybe we will know what the schedule is in the next week or 10\r\ndays or 2 weeks?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. We have a draft now.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. We have a draft for you to see.\r\n\r\nMr. LANE. Perhaps I should withdraw at this time.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. Lane, thank you very much, sir.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 5:45 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monday, March 9, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF ROY H.

Will you proceed? I believe the first thing is to swear\r\nthe witness.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Very good, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you promise to tell the truth, the whole truth,\r\nso help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I do, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN.

How long have you been with the Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This is my 23d year.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you sketch in a general outline what your duties have\r\nbeen with the Secret Service since the time you started with them,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I was appointed an agent with the Secret Service in\r\nDetroit, Mich., the 19th of December 1941. I was transferred to\r\nWashington, D.C., the field office, on February 9, 1942. Prior to\r\nthat I had a 30-day assignment in the office of Cincinnati, Ohio,\r\ntemporarily. I worked in the Washington field office from the 9th of\r\nFebruary 1942 until the middle of March 1942, whereby I was temporarily\r\ntransferred to the White House detail. This transfer became permanent,\r\neffective, I believe it was, the 17th of April or the latter part of\r\nApril in 1942, still as a special agent.\r\n\r\nAt the White House detail we work on shifts around the clock,\r\nprotecting the President and his family. I was a member of one of\r\nthose three shifts. Presently, these shifts change on a two-weekly\r\nbasis, from 8 to 4, 4 to midnight, and midnight to 8. I remained on the\r\nWhite House detail until February 7, 1951, when I was transferred to\r\nIndianapolis, Ind. Prior to that time I had received enough seniority\r\nwhereby I grew up on this shift from the bottom to the top, and was in\r\ncharge of one of the shifts prior to my departure to Indianapolis. This\r\nwas fieldwork in Indiana.\r\n\r\nOn February 1, 1955, I was transferred back to the White House detail.\r\nOn my return I was comparable to like, let's say, the No. 2 man of a\r\nshift. I was not in charge of it.\r\n\r\nFrom 1955, I believe a couple of years later a vacancy occurred, a top\r\nman of that shift left and I received his position. That title was\r\nassistant to the special agent in charge. You at that time governed\r\neach man on your shift. You were in charge of him.\r\n\r\nOn October 1 of 1962 a vacancy was opened in the three top officials of\r\nthe White House detail, which are comprised of, let me say, the special\r\nagent in charge, who has two assistants; one vacancy occurred. It was\r\nthe oldest man on the White House detail; it was given to me and that\r\nis why today I have the title of assistant special agent in charge.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, since you brought us up to 1955, have your duties\r\nremained the same since that time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I should bring you up to 1964. In 1955, I was\r\ntransferred back to the White House detail, remained on that status on\r\nshift work until 1962, whereas I am now an assistant special agent in\r\ncharge, which duties are the overseeing and the complete responsibility\r\nof the entire White House detail.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your educational background, Mr.----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I am a high school graduate only.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What year did you graduate from high school?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. 1933.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were your activities between graduation from high\r\nschool and the time you joined the Secret Service, please?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. In October of 1937 I completed the training with the\r\nMichigan State Police. I was sworn in as a trooper. I remained with the\r\nMichigan State Police until December 18, 1941, when I resigned and was\r\nappointed to the U.S. Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How were you employed or occupied from the time of\r\ngraduation from high school until the time you joined the Michigan\r\nState Police?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. 1933 there wasn't too much work; 1935 was my first work\r\nwith the Dodge Corp. of the Chrysler people in Detroit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long did you work there, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Three years, off and on.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You described in a general way the organization of the\r\nSecret Service on the White House protective detail. Who is the special\r\nagent in charge?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Mr. Gerald A. Behn, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he the special agent in charge back on November 22,\r\n1963?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. He was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many shifts are there?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Three shifts, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And approximately how many men are assigned to each shift?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Ten men on each shift, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were your specific duties back on November 22 of 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. My specific duty, gentlemen, on the 22d of November of\r\n1963, I was in charge of the detail for this trip of President Kennedy,\r\nfor the trip to Texas in those 2 days.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How did you personally make the trip to Texas?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I rode on the President's plane on the entire tour.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you outline in a general way the times of departure\r\nand arrival on the trip to Texas up until the morning of November 22,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I just don't have the time we left Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Without the precise times; just in a general way.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. All right. We departed in the morning from Washington.\r\nOur first stop was in San Antonio, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which morning was that, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It was November 21; it was at San Antonio, Tex., that\r\nwe picked up the then Vice President Johnson. The two people continued\r\non this tour of the State in separate planes. During our stay in San\r\nAntonio, we then flew from San Antonio to Houston, Tex. There were\r\nceremonies there, and the program there which had been set up. From\r\nHouston we flew into Fort Worth, Tex., where we remained overnight on\r\nNovember 21.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at the Texas Hotel, it was a little after 11 o'clock in the\r\nevening. There were no activities until the following morning, November\r\n22.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time did the activities start the following morning?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. On November 22, the activities started at around 8:25 in\r\nthe morning when the President, accompanied by the then Vice President\r\nJohnson, and a few congressional leaders walked out the front door,\r\nacross this street which was a parking lot, and a few minutes' speech\r\nwas made to the gathering there. It was a light drizzle at the time.\r\nFrom there we returned to the hotel and he attended a breakfast given\r\nby the chamber of commerce and, I believe it was, a citizens group of\r\nFort Worth. On completion of the breakfast he returned to his suite.\r\nThe weather was then changing. It had quit raining and it looked\r\nlike it was going to break out and be a real beautiful day. In the\r\nneighborhood of 10 o'clock in the morning I received a call from Mr.\r\nLawson, Special Agent Lawson, who had the advance from Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Lawson was with the Secret Service, was he?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; he is. He asked me to determine whether the\r\nbubbletop car that the President would ride in in Dallas that day\r\nshould have the top down or remain up.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Let me interrupt you there for just a minute, Mr.\r\nKellerman. I show you a photograph which has been marked as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 344. Are you able to identify that picture and the\r\nautomobile in that picture?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; this is the 1961 Lincoln Continental four-door\r\nconvertible bubbletop. It is a special car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. For the purpose of the record, how many doors does that\r\ncar have?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This vehicle has four doors.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And in the posture of the picture identified as Commission\r\nExhibit 344, is the top up or down?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The top is down, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what top does that automobile have?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This top is a plastic top. From the rear of the\r\npassenger all the way to the windshield there are four sections of\r\nplastic glass. The one that comes over the top of the passengers in the\r\nback seat, two little sections that come over the two doors, and one\r\nover the driver and passenger in the front seat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In what way is that attached, if any, to the car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Securely bolted, screwed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, may I ask that the Exhibit 344 be introduced\r\nformally in evidence, please?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It will be so admitted.\r\n\r\n(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 344 for\r\nidentification and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you a photograph marked Commission Exhibit 345.\r\nAre you able to tell us what that depicts?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; this is the same vehicle as mentioned in 344.\r\nThe difference being the top is up and there is a covering, a cloth\r\ncovering that also fits over this plastic top.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And Exhibit No. 345 is taken from what angle, Mr.\r\nKellerman?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. From the rear, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As contrasted with Exhibit No. 344, which is taken from\r\nwhat angle?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This is from the right side.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I ask that Exhibit 345 be introduced, if the Commission\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So admitted.\r\n\r\n(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 345 for\r\nidentification and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you a photograph marked Commission Exhibit 346,\r\nMr. Kellerman, and ask you if you can tell us what that depicts.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This picture depicts the interior of this same\r\nautomobile. It has a rear solid seat; there are two other jump seats\r\nthat can be folded forward in the rear and the complete solid front\r\nseat for the driver and passenger. This is the same vehicle.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe what, if anything, is present between\r\nthe front seat and the rear seat area?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir. This metal partition that is erected in back\r\nof the driver, between the driver and the passengers in the rear seat,\r\nis a metal framework that goes over the car. It has four holes in it.\r\nThese holes are utilized by the President for parades. As an example,\r\nsay it was used in Washington where you had an official visitor, and in\r\nusing one of the streets here as your parade route, he and his guest\r\nwould stand in this car where the people could view them a little\r\nbetter than sitting in the rear seat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where is that metal bar positioned with respect to the\r\nfront seat?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It is positioned over the front seat; the top of this\r\nbar would be 4 or 5 inches over my head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is it directly over the back portion of the front seat?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir. Directly over the front seat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And you describe it as 4 or 5 inches over your head. Can\r\nyou give us an estimate of the distance above the top of the front seat?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Oh, I am guessing in the neighborhood of 15, 18 inches.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the width of that metal bar?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The bar, 4 to 6 inches, I would say.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you tell us approximately how wide the automobile\r\nitself is?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; I can't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. With respect to the automobile, are there any running\r\nboards?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. There are no running boards.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there any place on the car where someone can stand up\r\nand ride as it proceeds in motion?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes; on the rear of the vehicle, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many such positions are there?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. There is a step on each side of the spare tire, one man\r\non each one.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is there any facility for holding on with a man riding\r\nin those positions?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; there is a metal arm erected on the trunk\r\nwhere a man can hold on while standing on the rear of the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nMay it please the Commission, I move that Exhibit 346 be introduced in\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It will be so admitted.\r\n\r\n(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 346 for\r\nidentification and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. With reference to the bubble top which you have heretofore\r\ndescribed, of what is that composed?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It is composed of plastic, clear plastic substance.\r\nIts use would be for a weather matter whereby the President or his\r\noccupants can see out. It is not an enclosed car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is it bulletproof?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It is not bulletproof.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is it bullet resistant in any way?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It's not bullet resistant.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you describe in a general way at this point what\r\nefforts, if any, have been made to obtain a bulletproof clear top for\r\nthe President's automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Presently?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Presently or heretofore.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I am going to have to go in the present day.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Fine.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This same vehicle, I understand, is being completed with\r\na bullet-resistant top and sides.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Can you explain the difference between bullet\r\nresistant and the existing kind of the top?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I can't; I really can't. I have been behind on this\r\nthing and I am at a loss for a better answer.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Could the present top deflect in any way, destroy\r\nthe accuracy of a shot?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This would be a guess, Mr. Congressman. I would think\r\nthat it would be deterred for, let's say, the velocity of a missile\r\ncoming in at great speed, I think it would deter it; I don't think it\r\nwould eliminate--it still would enter the top.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The vehicle.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I am sure; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But as far as you know the top that was available\r\nwould not impede the projectile? Do you know whether or not it would\r\ndeflect its accuracy?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Well, I have tried to study that, sir. The angle of\r\nthe back as an example which is, what degree I don't recall, hoping\r\nthat--of course, it was now known to be an upshot into the vehicle\r\nhoping that it would deter its force and so forth, but I really don't\r\nknow. I kind of doubt it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Kellerman, in describing the top as being not\r\nbulletproof and not bullet resistant, state whether you are describing\r\nthe top which they are currently working on or the top which was\r\npresent at the time of November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is the top that they are currently working on.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, as to the bubble top which accompanied this car on\r\nNovember 22, 1963, was that bulletproof or bullet resistant?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It was not; neither.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know whether or not an effort is being made at the\r\npresent time to develop a bullet-resistant or bulletproof top.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes sir; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you personally familiar with the progress of that\r\neffort?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I am not, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know how the President's automobile was transported\r\nfrom Washington, D.C., to Texas?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir. The President's vehicle was transported to San\r\nAntonio by cargo aircraft. It was flown to San Antonio a day before the\r\nPresident arrived. It was then flown from San Antonio to Dallas, where\r\nit was used on November 22. This vehicle was not used in the other two\r\nstops at Houston and Fort Worth.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you say cargo aircraft----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Like a C-130, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. A Government?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. You are right, sir; that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Kellerman, what were the President's activities, if\r\nyou know immediately prior to the time he departed from Fort Worth?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Might I ask just one question?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Do you know whether or not prior to November 22 the\r\nPresident's car had ever been equipped with a top which had the\r\ncapacity to stop or deflect a bullet?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Never had been, Senator.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. There was none in existence?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Kellerman, what were the President's activities\r\nimmediately before departing from Fort Worth on the morning of November\r\n22?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. First he walked from the hotel across the street, spoke\r\nto a group that were in a parking lot, with other congressional people\r\nthere in Texas. From there he walked right into the hotel and entered\r\nthe ballroom where a breakfast was held, given to him by the chamber of\r\ncommerce and, I believe, the citizens group in Fort Worth.\r\n\r\nFrom there he returned to his suite because there was time left before\r\nhis departure for Dallas. It was up there in the neighborhood of 10\r\no'clock in the morning that Special Agent Lawson called me from Dallas\r\nasking me to verify whether the top should be put on--should remain\r\non the President's car or should be taken off due to the change of\r\nweather. It had been raining slightly in Dallas at that time. I said,\r\n\"One moment and I will check with you one way or the other.\"\r\n\r\nAs I said earlier, the weather was clearing in Fort Worth; it was going\r\nto be a nice day. I asked Mr. Kenneth O'Donnell, who is President\r\nKennedy's appointment secretary: \"Mr. O'Donnell,\" I said, \"the\r\nweather; it is slightly raining in Dallas, predictions of clearing up.\r\nDo you desire to have the bubbletop on the President's car or do you,\r\nor would you desire to have it removed for this parade over to the\r\nTrade Mart?\"\r\n\r\nHis instructions to me were, \"If the weather is clear and it is not\r\nraining, have that bubbletop off,\" and that is exactly what I relayed\r\nto Mr. Lawson.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, at about what time did President Kennedy depart from\r\nFort Worth?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. We were airborne from Fort Worth at 11:20 in the morning.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In what plane were you airborne?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. In the President's special plane, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time did you arrive in that plane in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. We arrived in Dallas, Love Field, at 11:40 a.m.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Describe in a general way what President Kennedy's\r\nactivities were at Love Field, please.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Very well. May I add this: Again I said there were two\r\nplanes in this program. The then Vice President Johnson would be in\r\na separate plane. He would land ahead of us by a minute or two, all\r\nright. He is in Dallas by the time we arrive at 11:40 a.m. As we are\r\nspotted on the apron at Love Field and when the ramp is pulled forward,\r\nthe Vice President, then Vice President Johnson and Mrs. Johnson,\r\ntogether with a selected group of people would form a reception\r\ncommittee from the end of the ramp straight out to where the motorcade\r\nwas in place.\r\n\r\nAt 11:40, as I said, the President and Mrs. Kennedy left that plane,\r\nmet these people. As we finished greeting these folks here, there was\r\nan elderly lady wheeled up in a wheelchair; her name I do not know; the\r\nboth of them met her. By this time the people are starting to get in\r\ntheir automobiles for this trip into town. The President then noticed\r\nthat there was quite a gathering of people at this airport in back of a\r\nfenced area, and, with her, they both walked over to this crowded area\r\nand started shaking hands and greeting these people who had been there\r\nperhaps some time before we got in.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. By \"her\", who do you mean, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Mrs. Kennedy; I am sorry.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What would you estimate the crowd to be?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. In the thousands; I would say there were two, three,\r\nfour thousand people there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately how long did the greeting of the crowd at\r\nLove Field last, Mr. Kellerman?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Fifteen minutes. The motorcade left Love Field at 11:55.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately how many cars were there in that motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. At least 15.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the first car in line?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The first car in line, sir, was what we call the police\r\npilot car. The duties of these police officers in that car--they would\r\ndrive ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you personally know who was in that car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How far ahead of the regular motorcade were they to be?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. They could be several blocks ahead of us.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the general purpose of that pilot car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The purpose of that pilot car is to clear the roadway\r\nand instruct the officers along the route that the President is in\r\nmotion and coming in back of them. Next you will find a small group of\r\nmotorcycles.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know how many motorcycles there were in Dallas on\r\nthat day?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you tell us what the custom is with respect to\r\nmotorcycles?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; those motorcycles that would be in back of\r\nthat police car were to assist any officers along the way in any\r\ndisturbance that they would run into before we got to that point, or\r\nsecondly, in the event that we needed them back on our car they could\r\nbe called, utilized.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the next car in line?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The next car is the lead car. That car on that day was\r\ndriven by Chief Curry of the Dallas Police Department.\r\n\r\nHis occupants in that car was Special Agent Winston Lawson, who was\r\ncarrying a portable radio with him. Also in this car was Special Agent\r\nin Charge Verne Sorrels, in charge of our Dallas office. The other\r\noccupant, I believe, was a deputy sheriff.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was it Sheriff Decker, perhaps, of Dallas County?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The name doesn't reach me, sir; I am sorry.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You described a radio. Will you tell us a little more\r\nfully what radio transmission there was in the motorcade, please?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir. This lead car which Mr. Lawson was in has a\r\nportable radio. The President's car is next. This is equipped with a\r\npermanent set radio on the same frequency as that gentleman up front.\r\nThe next car is our Secret Service followup car which has a permanent\r\ninstallation. The Secret Service car, as I say, is equipped with a\r\npermanent installation which connects the President's car and the lead\r\ncar. The next car in back of our Secret Service car was the then Vice\r\nPresident Johnson. The Secret Service agent in that car had a portable\r\nradio that he could read all three of us ahead. His car following was a\r\nsmall Secret Service followup car, and they, too, had a portable set,\r\nwhich could read all four.\r\n\r\nSo we had a net of five on our own frequency. In the police cars they\r\nhad their own city police frequency radios.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many frequencies were used by your own network?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. One.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you have an alternative frequency, emergency\r\nfrequency?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; we do. We have two of them.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What automobile came behind the lead automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The President's car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Describe the occupants of that car, indicating their\r\npositions, if you can, please.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes. The President--President Kennedy sat on the right\r\nrear seat. Next to him on the left seat was Mrs. Kennedy. On the right\r\njump seat in front of President Kennedy was Governor Connally. On the\r\nleft jump seat in front of Mrs. Kennedy was Mrs. Connally. I sat on the\r\nright passenger seat of the driver's seat, and Special Agent William\r\nGreer drove the vehicle.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How far were you behind the lead car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No more than two or three car lengths.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What is that? I didn't hear it.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No more than two or three car lengths, Senator Cooper.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What car immediately followed the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Our own Secret Service followup car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What kind of a car was that?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This is a 1956 Cadillac, four-door touring car with the\r\ntop down.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that also a special automobile flown in?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This is a special automobile, flown in with the\r\nPresident's car; yes, sir; that is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who were the occupants of that car, indicating their\r\npositions in the car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. All during this ride in from Love Field Special Agent\r\nSam Kinney was the driver of this automobile. The assistant to the\r\nSpecial Agent in Charge Emory Roberts was sitting in the front seat,\r\nthe passenger side. This car has running boards. Standing on the front\r\nof the left running board was Special Agent Clinton Hill. In back of\r\nhim on the rear of that same running board on that side was Special\r\nAgent William McIntyre. On the right running board standing forward was\r\nSpecial Agent John Ready, and standing in back of him on the rear of\r\nthe right running board was Special Agent Paul Landis.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did that automobile have jump seats?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This automobile has jump seats.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what people occupied the jump seats?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It was occupied by Mr. Kenneth O'Donnell, who was the\r\nappointment secretary of President Kennedy, and Mr. Dave Powers.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know which sat on which side?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Mr. O'Donnell sat on the left; Mr. Powers sat on the\r\nright.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was in the back seat of that automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The back seat of that automobile on the right side was\r\nSpecial Agent George Hickey, and on the left side Special Agent Glen\r\nBennett.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How were the special agents in the followup car armed, if\r\nat all?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Each agent carries his own gun. This is a 4-inch\r\nrevolver on their person.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would that apply to you and Mr. Greer as well?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Absolutely.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there any other arms in the President's followup car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; in this followup car we have what is now known\r\nas an AR-15. This is a rifle, and it is on all movements; this vehicle\r\nis out of the case; it won't be shown; it could be laying flat on the\r\nfloor, but she is ready to go.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, how far behind the President's car did the\r\nPresidential followup car follow?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Not knowing how far it was behind, I would say, from the\r\npractice of that driver that he has, five feet would be a maximum.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What car was in the motorcade immediately behind the\r\nPresident's followup car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That was Vice President Johnson's car then.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What kind of a car was that on that particular day?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This was a Lincoln four-door Continental convertible.\r\nThis was a four-door car, with no top on it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that a special car, also, or is that obtained on the\r\nmarket?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This is not a special car; it is a car that is on the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What car followed the Vice President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The car following his car was a police car. It was\r\ndriven by a member of the Dallas Police Force, or I just don't recall.\r\nI am sorry.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have personal knowledge or detail of the occupants\r\nof the Vice President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was present there?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Special Agent Rufus Youngblood sat in the front seat on\r\nthe right side. In back of him on the right side and the rear was the\r\nthen Vice President Johnson. Next to him was Mrs. Johnson, and next to\r\nMrs. Johnson was Senator Yarborough.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was Vice President Johnson seated on the right side or the\r\nleft side of the rear seat?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. On the right side, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there jump seats in the Vice President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know the identity of the driver of the Vice\r\nPresident's car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was that?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That was Mr. Hurchel Jacks. He is a Dallas police\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Might he be a Texas State police officer?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; you are right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know the identity of all of the individuals in the\r\nVice President's followup car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Not the driver. The agents, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who were they, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Special Agent Thomas L. Johns, Special Agent Warren\r\nTaylor, and I believe that is all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you able to indicate their precise positions?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, no.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, what car, if you know, followed the Vice President's\r\nfollowup car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That was car--as an example, car No. 1, which would be a\r\ncongressional car; the occupants I do not know at the present time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And behind that car, describe in a general way the balance\r\nof the motorcade, if you will, please.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. All right. The balance of the motorcade, the back\r\nof that car No. 1 which would be the congressional people would be\r\ntwo press cars, one covering the wire people, and one would be the\r\nphotographic group. Then you would have a series of guest cars, and\r\nthen a press bus. And then a police car followup, bringing up the\r\nentire motorcade.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You described the motorcycles which followed the pilot\r\ncar. Were there any other motorcycles in the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; we had four other motorcycles opposite the\r\nback wheel of the President's vehicle, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were those on both sides or on each side?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. On each side; two on each side.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there any other motorcycles in the balance of the\r\nmotorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Not that I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At what speed did the motorcade proceed at the various\r\ntimes en route, say, from Love Field down to the downtown section of\r\nDallas, Tex.?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. As we left Love Field, the driveway from this apron on\r\nthe field was sort of a winding thing, and there were many people that\r\ngathered on the roadside to view him as they passed. I don't think\r\nwe traveled more than 12 to 15 miles until we left the airport apron\r\nproper.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Twelve to fifteen miles per hour?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Per hour.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Then, as we were in the opening between there and the\r\ncity limits of Dallas, we could have gone 25 to 30.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the size of the crowd at that specific point?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Nothing in between then until we hit the outskirts of\r\nthe city. Of course, then you got into a residential, a school, area\r\nwhere all the people were out on the curb line.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the speed when you reached that area?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Then we would reduce the speed down to 15 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate of the minimum speed traveled\r\nuntil you reached the downtown area?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. We could have been going 25 to 30 at several times, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were the crowds like in the downtown area itself?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. A lot of people.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the speed of the motorcade when you came into the\r\ndowntown area?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It would be reduced down to 10 to 15 miles an hour, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there any unusual occurrences en route from Love\r\nField until, say, you got to the downtown area of Dallas, Tex.?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. As we were on the outskirts of this town and apparently\r\nreaching a crowded area there were a group of youngsters on the right\r\nside of the car curb-line-wise, that had a large sign, oh, perhaps the\r\nwidth of the two windows there, that said, \"Please, Mr. President, stop\r\nand shake our hands,\" and he saw this and he called to the driver and\r\nsaid, \"Stop,\" he said, \"call these people over and I will shake their\r\nhands,\" which we did. The entire motorcade stopped. I got out of the\r\ncar and stood alongside of it while these people were right up on me.\r\nThe agents who were on the followup car, all around it. And then after\r\na few seconds he said, \"All right; let's travel on.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You say the agents in the followup car moved up at the\r\nstopping?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Always, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Specifically, what did they do on that occasion?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. They crowded right in between the President, the car,\r\nand the people.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did the President actually leave the car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how long did that stop last?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. A matter of seconds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any other unusual occurrence en route to the\r\ndowntown area itself?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; I can recall, however, one small affair. I think\r\nwe were in the heart of Dallas on this street when a young boy jumped\r\noff the curb and apparently he was thinking of running over to the\r\nPresident's car and shaking his hands when one of our people left the\r\nfollowup car and put him back on the curb, and that all happened in\r\nmotion so there was nothing out of the way.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I show you a photograph marked Commission Exhibit No.\r\n347 and ask you if you are at this time able to tell us what that\r\nphotograph represents.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Congressman Ford, may I interrupt at this time to ask to\r\nbe excused? I have a session in the Supreme Court, but I will be back\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\n(Chief Justice Warren left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This is an aerial photo of the downtown parade.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you able to identify the street on which you proceeded\r\ncoming into the area depicted by that photograph?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir. This is--this would be Main Street as we came\r\ninto the heart of Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I think it might be helpful if we marked that as Main\r\nStreet if we can get a pencil or pen that will mark on that.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. May I suggest the witness mark it?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I think it is a good idea. Will you mark the street which\r\nyou have identified as Main Street?\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you also mark----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. We were traveling----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The street onto which you turned from Main Street?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. As we were coming up from Main Street or down, either\r\nway.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In what general direction were you proceeding on Main\r\nStreet?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This was a westerly direction.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you put an arrow indicating which way is north on\r\nthe map? That is a general northerly direction on the map.\r\n\r\n(Witness indicating.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you mark an arrow on Main Street showing the\r\ndirection on which you were proceeding on Main? And how far did you\r\nproceed on Main Street to what street?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Elm Street, sir. This is a very short block, maybe a\r\ncouple of hundred feet at the most.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. My question was to what street did you proceed on Main?\r\nYou then drove to what street?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Houston Street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which way did you turn onto Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Turned right, which would be north.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you mark the street that you have told us would be\r\nHouston Street?\r\n\r\n(Witness indicating.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How far did you proceed down Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I am sure it wasn't more than 200 feet at the most. It\r\nwas a real short block.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What street then did you turn onto as you turned off of\r\nHouston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. From Houston we turned onto Elm, which was a rather\r\nsharp turn with a downgrade, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that a turn on the left or the right?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. To the left, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I ask that Exhibit 347 be admitted in evidence, may it\r\nplease the Commission.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It will be admitted.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now show you a photograph marked Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 348, Mr. Kellerman, and I ask you if you are able at this time to\r\nidentify what building is in that picture?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This building right straight ahead in the photo--I\r\ncouldn't have told you on the day of the 22nd of November what it was,\r\nbut as of now this is the Texas Depository Building.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that the building known as the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right, sir.\r\n\r\n(The photograph marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 347 and 348 for\r\nidentification and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you mark on Exhibit 347--we have 348, we will get 348\r\nback in a moment. I would like to have you mark in the aerial shot the\r\nprecise location of that building with the initials \"TS.\"\r\n\r\n(Witness marks.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. For the written part of our record will you describe how\r\nmany stories high the Texas School Book Depository building is?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This is a seven-story building. From here it appears to\r\nbe a rather square-type constructed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. As you were proceeding in a generally northerly\r\ndirection on Houston Street, can you describe the layout of the street,\r\nindicating first the approximate width of that street?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Houston Street is a rather wide city street similar to\r\nanything we have here in Washington, really, and being in the heart of\r\nthe business section, I would say that it was a six-lane street at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was on your right as you proceeded down Houston\r\nStreet?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The buildings.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how about on your left?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. On my left it was open.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As you turned left onto Elm Street, will you describe what\r\nwas on your right?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. As we turned left onto Elm Street and left this building\r\nthat we are speaking of here----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that the Texas School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes; then your area became clear.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On the right?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. On the right, sir. This was an open field area with a\r\nhill. Now, there were, if I recall correctly, just at the brink of\r\nthe hill, right beyond this building in question, there was a small\r\nwhite--how can I describe it?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. A little park area?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. A little park area; that is right. And beyond it it was\r\nall open.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was on your left at about that time as you proceeded\r\ndown Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Right. As we turned left on Elm Street off Houston,\r\nthis, too, was a little plaza area, and kind of a triangular thing\r\nwhere the street was on the opposite side; this is an apparently\r\none-way street, and directly to our left as we turned you had to view,\r\nthis looked like a little one-story plaza building or structure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. To complete the scene, as you looked ahead of you down Elm\r\nStreet what, if anything, did you see immediately in front of you?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes. First thing that I saw was that the road was going\r\nto turn, and then a little further ahead we had a viaduct which we were\r\ngoing under.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know what name the Dallas Texans give to that\r\nviaduct?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; I really don't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you heard it described since as the triple overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; I haven't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the approximate width of Elm Street in lanes of\r\ntravel, if you recall?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It is at least three lanes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And describe the terrain, whether it was smooth, level or\r\nin what way you went as you went down Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. As we went down Elm Street, there was a smooth road and\r\nthe terrain on each side was a grassy plotted area, a very cleared-off\r\narea, visibility tremendous.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And describe the composure of the crowds at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. As we turned north on to Houston Street, this was\r\nprimarily the end of the crowd in Dallas, Tex.; in the downtown\r\nsection, there were still a few on the sidewalk until we got to Elm\r\nStreet. As we turned in a northerly direction to Elm Street, which\r\nwould be on our left, then the crowds just diminished. They were\r\nspotty, standing on the grassy plot. They were not on the side of the\r\nstreet. In fact, there were just a matter of a handful, that was all,\r\nand we were through it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know what time it was when you got to the\r\nintersection of Houston and Elm on November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Not at Houston and Elm; no. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the speed of the motorcade, Mr. Kellerman, as you\r\nwere proceeding down Main Street at about the time you turned right\r\nonto Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Ten, fifteen, no more; real parade speed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How far ahead of you was the lead car at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Again, it was four or five car lengths in front.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know how far behind you the President's followup\r\ncar was as you turned right onto Houston from Main Street?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; I don't, but I am positive it was right on our rear\r\nwheels.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nNow, as you turned left off Houston onto Elm, what is your best\r\nestimate of the speed of the President's automobile at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. As we turned onto Elm Street and the crowd, we were\r\nthrough the section of Dallas; we might have had--the driver picked\r\nit up because we were all through. Purely a guess, we could have been\r\ngoing at the most 25.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What would your estimate, your minimum estimate, of the\r\nspeed be?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Fifteen.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As you turned left onto Elm Street, how far were you\r\nbehind the lead car at that point?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I am going to say the same; three to five car lengths,\r\nbut I can, to go a little further, I can see this car ahead of me. He\r\nis not running away from us.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about the pilot car; was that car in sight?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; that I didn't see; I didn't see it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know from your personal observation at the time you\r\nturned left onto Elm Street how far the President's followup car was\r\nbehind you at that point?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Not from personal observation.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Now, describe what occurred as you proceeded\r\ndown Elm Street after turning off of Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. As we turned off Houston onto Elm and made the short\r\nlittle dip to the left going down grade, as I said, we were away\r\nfrom buildings, and were--there was a sign on the side of the road\r\nwhich I don't recall what it was or what it said, but we no more than\r\npassed that and you are out in the open, and there is a report like a\r\nfirecracker, pop. And I turned my head to the right because whatever\r\nthis noise was I was sure that it came from the right and perhaps into\r\nthe rear, and as I turned my head to the right to view whatever it was\r\nor see whatever it was, I heard a voice from the back seat and I firmly\r\nbelieve it was the President's, \"My God, I am hit,\" and I turned around\r\nand he has got his hands up here like this.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating right hand up toward his neck?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right, sir. In fact, both hands were up in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Which side of his neck?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Beg pardon?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Which side of his neck?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Both hands were up, sir; this one is like this here and\r\nhere we are with the hands----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating the left hand is up above the head.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. In the collar section.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As you are positioning yourself in the witness chair, your\r\nright hand is up with the finger at the ear level as if clutching from\r\nthe right of the head; would that be an accurate description of the\r\nposition you pictured there?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes. Good. There was enough for me to verify that the\r\nman was hit. So, in the same motion I come right back and grabbed the\r\nspeaker and said to the driver, \"Let's get out of here; we are hit,\"\r\nand grabbed the mike and I said, \"Lawson, this is Kellerman,\"--this is\r\nLawson, who is in the front car. \"We are hit; get us to the hospital\r\nimmediately.\" Now, in the seconds that I talked just now, a flurry of\r\nshells come into the car. I then looked back and this time Mr. Hill,\r\nwho was riding on the left front bumper of our followup car, was on the\r\nback trunk of that car; the President was sideways down into the back\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating on his left side.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Right; just like I am here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You mean, correct, left side?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Correct; yes, sir. Governor Connally by that time is\r\nlying flat backwards into her lap--Mrs. Connally--and she was lying\r\nflat over him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was lying flat over him?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Mrs. Connally was lying flat over the Governor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You say that you turned to your right immediately after\r\nyou heard a shot?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the reason for your reacting to your right?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That was the direction that I heard this noise, pop.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have a reaction as to the height from which the\r\nnoise came?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; honestly, I do not.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was there any reaction that you noticed on the\r\npart of Greer when the noise was noticed by you?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. You are referring, Mr. Congressman, to the reaction to\r\nget this car out of there?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Mr. Congressman, I have driven that car many times, and\r\nI never cease to be amazed even to this day with the weight of the\r\nautomobile plus the power that is under the hood; we just literally\r\njumped out of the God-damn road.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. As soon as this noise was heard, or as soon as you\r\ntransmitted this message to Lawson?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. As soon as I transmitted to the driver first as I went\r\nto Lawson. I just leaned sideways to him and said, \"Let's get out of\r\nhere. We are hit.\"\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That comment was made to Greer; not to Lawson?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; that is right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And the subsequent message was to Lawson?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Correct. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. With relationship to that first noise that you have\r\ndescribed, when did you hear the voice?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. His voice?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. We will start with his voice.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. OK. From the noise of which I was in the process of\r\nturning to determine where it was or what it was, it carried on right\r\nthen. Why I am so positive, gentlemen, that it was his voice--there is\r\nonly one man in that back seat that was from Boston, and the accents\r\ncarried very clearly.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, had you become familiar with the President's voice\r\nprior to that day?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes; very much so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was the basis for your becoming familiar with his\r\nvoice prior to that day?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I had been with him for 3 years.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And had you talked with him on a very frequent basis\r\nduring the course of that association?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. He was a very free man to talk to; yes. He knew most\r\nall the men, most everybody who worked in the White House as well as\r\neverywhere, and he would call you.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And from your experience would you say that you could\r\nrecognize the voice?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Very much, sir; I would.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, I think you may have answered this, but I want to\r\npinpoint just when you heard that statement which you have attributed\r\nto President Kennedy in relationship to the sound which you described\r\nas a firecracker.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This noise which I attribute as a firecracker, when this\r\noccurred and I am in the process of determining where it comes because\r\nI am sure it came off my right rear somewhere; the voice broke in right\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At about the same time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is correct, sir. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, did President Kennedy say anything beside, \"My God, I\r\nam hit.\"\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is the last words he said, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Mrs. Kennedy say anything at that specific time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Mr. Specter, there was an awful lot of confusion in\r\nthat back seat. She did a lot of talking which I can't recall all the\r\nphrases.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, pinpoint----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. But after the flurry of shots, I recall her saying,\r\n\"What are they doing to you?\" Now again, of course, my comparison of\r\nthe voice of her speech--certainly, I have heard it many times, and in\r\nthe car there was conversation she was carrying on through shock, I am\r\nsure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, going back to the precise time that you heard the\r\nPresident say, \"My God, I am hit,\" do you recollect whether she said\r\nanything at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Whether or not you can re-create what she said?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Not that I can recall right then, sir. This statement,\r\nor whatever she said, happened after all the shooting was over.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Now, you have described hearing a noise which\r\nsounded like a firecracker and you have described turning to your right\r\nand described hearing the President's voice and, again, what was your\r\nnext motion, if any, or movement, if any?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. After I was sure that his statement was right that he\r\nwas hit, turned from the back I come right down----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You just indicated that you had turned to the left. Had\r\nyou turned to the left after hearing his voice?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes; certainly.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you see? You have described what you saw in\r\nterms of position of his hands.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That was it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you do next?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is when I completely turned to my right and grabbed\r\nfor the mike in the same motion, sideways telling the driver, \"Let's\r\nget out of here; we are hit.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you give us the best estimate of the lapse of\r\ntime from the instant you heard the sound which appeared to you to\r\nbe a firecracker until you instructed Mr. Greer in the way you have\r\ndescribed?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Seconds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many seconds?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Three or four.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, how long did it take you to relay the instructions\r\nwhich you have told us about to Special Agent Lawson; what your best\r\nestimate would be?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Instant, in seconds again. Again it is three to five.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, in your prior testimony you described a flurry of\r\nshells into the car. How many shots did you hear after the first noise\r\nwhich you described as sounding like a firecracker?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Mr. Specter, these shells came in all together.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you able to say how many you heard?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I am going to say two, and it was like a double\r\nbang--bang, bang.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You mean now two shots in addition to the first noise?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; yes, sir; at least.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate of the time, in seconds, from\r\nthe first noise sounding like a firecracker until the second noise\r\nwhich you heard?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This was instantaneous.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. No; let me repeat the question so I am sure you understand\r\nit. From the time you first heard the noise coming to your right rear,\r\nwhich you described as sounding like a firecracker, until you heard the\r\nflurry of shots?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This is about how long it took, sir. As I am viewing,\r\ntrying to determine this noise, I turned to my right and I heard the\r\nvoice and I came back and I verify it and speak to the driver, grab the\r\nmike, these shots come in.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, you have described it as 3 to 4 seconds from the\r\ntime----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No more.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. From the time of the first noise--wait a minute--until you\r\ngave the instruction to Mr. Greer and then as you made the statement\r\nto Special Agent Lawson over the microphone that was an instantaneous\r\ntimespan as you have described it.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How soon thereafter did the flurry of shots come?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. They came in, Mr. Specter, while I am delivering that\r\nradio message.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. To Mr. Lawson. All right. Was there any timespan which\r\nyou could discern between the first and second shots and what you have\r\ndescribed as the flurry?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I will estimate 5 seconds, if that.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But this flurry took place while you were occupied\r\nwith these other activities; is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You don't recall precisely a second shot and a\r\nthird shot such as you did in the case of the first?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Let me give you an illustration, sir, before I can give\r\nyou an answer. You have heard the sound barrier, of a plane breaking\r\nthe sound barrier, bang, bang? That is it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This is for the second and the third, or the\r\nflurry as you described it?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right; that is right, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On your 5-second estimate, was that in reference, Mr.\r\nKellerman, to the total timespan from the first noise until the flurry\r\nended?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right; that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Now, when the flurry occurred then, were you\r\nstill facing forward talking into the microphone to Lawson?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Then precisely what was your next movement\r\nafter completing the delivery of that message to Lawson?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. When I completed the delivery of those instructions to\r\nLawson, I just hung up the receiver and looked back.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. To your right this time--to your left; pardon me.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. To my left; that is right. This is when I first viewed\r\nMr. Hill, who was on the back of the----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Precisely where was he in that instant?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Lying right across the trunk of the car with Mrs.\r\nKennedy on the left rear. Mr. Hill's head was right up in back of her.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you describe the left rear you mean as the car was\r\nfacing?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. As the car is traveling, sir; yes, sir. He was lying\r\nacross the trunk of this car, feet on this side.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he flat across the trunk of the car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Flat; that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the position of Mrs. Kennedy's body at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. She was sitting up in the corner of this back seat, like\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that she was on the buttocks area of her body at that\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what movement, if any, did you observe Mrs. Kennedy\r\nmake at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I never did see Mrs. Kennedy leave that back seat, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say the back seat, are you referring----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The seat she was sitting on.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you referring to the seat itself of the automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where did you look next; what did you observe following\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Then I observed how the President was lying, which\r\nwas--he was--flat in the seat in this direction.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On his left-hand side?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir. Governor Connally was lying straight on his\r\nback with Mrs. Connally over him about halfway.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Governor Connally say anything up to this point?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Mrs. Connally say anything up to that point?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When was it that Mrs. Kennedy made the statement which you\r\nhave described, \"My God, what are they doing?\"\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This occurred after the flurry of shots.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At that time you looked back and saw Special Agent Hill\r\nacross the trunk of the car, had your automobile accelerated by that\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Tremendously so; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, to the best of your ability to recollect, exactly\r\nwhen did your automobile first accelerate?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Our car accelerated immediately on the time--at the\r\ntime--this flurry of shots came into it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you say the acceleration----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Between the second and third shot.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Might I ask a question there?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. A few minutes ago you said in response to a question\r\nthat when you spoke to the driver the car leaped forward from an\r\nacceleration immediately. Did that acceleration occur before the second\r\nshot was fired?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir. Just about the time that it came in.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. About the time it came in?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Not before?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. One other question: You said the flurry of shots came\r\nin the car. You were leaning forward talking to the driver after the\r\nfirst shot. What made you aware of a flurry of shots?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Senator, between all the matter that was--between all\r\nthe matter that was blown off from an injured person, this stuff all\r\ncame over.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What was that?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Body matter; flesh.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. When you were speaking of a flurry of shots, was\r\nthere a longer interval between the first shot and the second shot as\r\ncompared to the interval between the second shot and the third shot?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When did you first notice the substance which you have\r\ndescribed as body matter?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. When I got to the hospital, sir, it was all over my coat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you notice it flying past you at any time prior to\r\nyour arrival at the hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes; I know there was something in the air.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When, in relation to the shots, Mr. Kellerman, did you\r\nnotice the substance in the air?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Fine. When I have given the orders to Mr. Lawson, this\r\nis when it all came between the driver and myself.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you describe what it was in a little more detail as it\r\nappeared to you at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This is a rather poor comparison, but let's say you take\r\na little handful of matter--I am going to use sawdust for want of a\r\nbetter item--and just throw it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you describe the sound of the flurry of shots by way\r\nof distinction with the way you have described the sound of the first\r\nshot?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Well, having heard all types of guns fired, most of\r\nthem, rather, if I recall correctly these were two sharp reports, sir.\r\nAgain, I am going to refer to it as like a plane going through a sound\r\nbarrier; bang, bang.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, you are referring to the flurry?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did it sound differently from the first noise you have\r\ndescribed as being a firecracker?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes; definitely; very much so.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was there any other noise going on at the time of\r\nthe second and third shots different from the noise of the crowd or\r\notherwise at the time of the first shot?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. We had no crowd, sir. There was nothing there.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So the external noise was identical as far as\r\nthe----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Very much.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. First or second or the third shot?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir. We are in an open-field area, so to speak, and\r\neverything was just clear.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So there was no other sound that would have\r\ndisturbed your hearing capability from the first through the third shot?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right; no other shot.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Your only problem would be your personal activity\r\nafter the first shot.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Correct.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Your activity of speaking to Greer and talking to\r\nLawson?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is correct, sir; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was there any crowd reaction?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. There was no crowd.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There were a few stragglers?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. A handful, and I didn't view any reaction, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Kellerman, you said earlier that there were at least\r\ntwo additional shots. Is there any area in your mind or possibility, as\r\nyou recollect that situation, that there could have been more than two\r\nshots, or are you able to say with any certainty?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I am going to say that I have, from the firecracker\r\nreport and the two other shots that I know, those were three shots.\r\nBut, Mr. Specter, if President Kennedy had from all reports four\r\nwounds, Governor Connally three, there have got to be more than three\r\nshots, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What is that answer? What did he say?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you repeat that, Mr. Kellerman?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. President Kennedy had four wounds, two in the head and\r\nshoulder and the neck. Governor Connally, from our reports, had three.\r\nThere have got to be more than three shots.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is that why you have described----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The flurry.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The noise as a flurry?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Excuse me, do you have any independent recollection, Mr.\r\nKellerman, of the number of shots, aside from the inference that you\r\nmake as to how many points of wounds there were?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Could you rephrase that, please?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes. You have drawn a conclusion, in effect, by saying\r\nthat there were four wounds for the President and three wounds for the\r\nGovernor; and from that, you say there must have been more than three\r\nshots in your opinion or your view. But my question is: Do you have any\r\ncurrent recollection of having heard more than three shots?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No. I don't. I will have to say \"No.\"\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Has that been your recollection from the very time of\r\nthe shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir; it has been my opinion.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Not your opinion, but from the time of the shooting you\r\nthink then that you heard only three shots, or did you----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Or did you ever think that you heard more than three?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir; I can't say that, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, you referred to four wounds, Mr. Kellerman,\r\nrealizing, of course, your characterization is only lay opinion.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Very true.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you tell us which wounds you made reference to by\r\nthat statement, please?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. All right. Can I keep the train going from the time we\r\ngot to the hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir; do it in your own way just as you please.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Fine. As we arrived at the hospital I immediately got\r\nout of the car. Our followup car is in back of us, as you will recall.\r\nI yelled to the agents, \"Get in\"--\"Go get us two stretchers on wheels.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime in a matter of seconds--I don't know how they got out\r\nso fast--I turned right around to the back door and opened it. By this\r\ntime Mrs. Connally had raised up, and the Governor is lying in her lap,\r\nface up. His eyes are open and he is looking at me, and I am fairly\r\nsure he is alive. By this time I noticed the two stretchers coming out\r\nof the emergency room, and I said to the Governor, I said, \"Governor,\r\ndon't worry; everything is going to be all right.\" And he nodded his\r\nhead, which I was fairly convinced that that man was alive.\r\n\r\nBy this time the stretcher is there. I get inside on one side of him,\r\nand Special Agent Hill on the other. Somebody is holding his feet, and\r\nwe remove the Governor and put him on the stretcher and they take him\r\nin.\r\n\r\nWe then get in and help Mrs. Connally out. Our next move is to get\r\nMrs. Kennedy off from the seat, which was a little difficult, but\r\nshe was removed. Then Mr. Hill removed his coat and laid it over the\r\nPresident's face and shoulder. He and I among two other people--I\r\ndon't know--we lifted up the President and put him on a stretcher and\r\nfollowed him right into the emergency room.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, this emergency room is a, it looks like a, checkerboard;\r\nit has a walkway down the center and a crossway and there are rooms\r\non each side. President Kennedy was put into the one on the right,\r\nGovernor Connally across on the left. And as we pushed the wheelchair\r\nin--we pushed the stretcher inside, the medical people just seemed to\r\nform right in, right there, and I walked around him and I wanted to\r\nlook at this man's face, they had him face up.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. The President?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The President; I am sorry. I did not see any wounds in\r\nthat man's face.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating with your hand at that moment the front part of\r\nhis face?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Right, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May I interrupt you just to ask whether you had any\r\nview----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Surely.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Of the rear part of his head?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I did not, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the rearmost or uppermost portion of President\r\nKennedy's head which you could observe at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It was the hairline to the ear, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Proceed.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Having all the medical people in there, my business is\r\nleft in their hands. So I left. Mrs. Kennedy, incidentally, was still\r\nin there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In where, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. In the emergency room with him. Which after a few\r\nminutes they convinced her to leave, and she sat outside the room while\r\nthey were working over the President. I walked into this center area\r\nof this emergency room--and I am looking for a telephone--which there\r\nis a little doctor's office and I walked inside, and I am alone at\r\nthat time, except one medic who was in there. There are two phones and\r\nI said, \"Can I use either one of these phones to get outside?\" and he\r\nsaid, \"Yes; just pick one up.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time Mr. Lawson enters and also Mr. Hill. I asked Mr. Lawson\r\nfor the telephone number of the Dallas White House switchboard.\r\nHe immediately has it and I said to Mr. Hill, \"Will you dial it,\r\nplease?\" By that time a medic comes into the room from President\r\nKennedy's section and he asks if anybody knows the blood type of the\r\nPresident--President Kennedy. We all carry it. I produce mine, and that\r\nis what I believe they used; I am not sure. By this time the connection\r\nis made with the White House operator in Dallas, and I took the phone,\r\nidentified myself, and I said, \"Give me Washington. Please don't pull\r\nthis line; let's leave it open.\"\r\n\r\nI got the Washington operator and I said, identified myself, and I\r\nsaid, \"Give me Mr. Behn.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Behn was in the office at the time, and I said--his name is Gerald\r\nBehn--and I said, \"Gerry, we have had an incident here in Dallas. The\r\nPresident, the Governor have been shot. We are in the emergency room\r\nof the Parkland Memorial Hospital.\" I said, \"Mark down the time.\"\r\nOf course, since that time until now we have disagreed on about 3\r\nminutes. I said it is 12:38, which would be 1:38 Dallas time. I am\r\nsorry--Washington time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that at the time you were talking to Mr. Behn?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. To Mr. Behn; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And your version is that it is 12:38 Dallas time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. 12:38. He said it was 12:41; he told me the next day.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May I interrupt you there for you to tell us how long\r\nafter you arrived at the hospital did you make that telephone call to\r\nMr. Behn, to the best of your recollection?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Three to five minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. The topic we are on now, Mr. Kellerman, is your\r\nown way of relating the description of the wounds, starting with four\r\nwounds on President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Right; OK.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Proceed, then.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I can eclipse an awful lot here and get into the morgue\r\nhere in Bethesda, because that is where I looked him over.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I will come back and pick up some of the other detail.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Fine.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But for the sequence at the moment, as it relates to your\r\nconclusions on the shots which you have already testified about----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. OK.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I would like to develop your understanding and your\r\nobservations of the four wounds on President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. OK. This all transpired in the morgue of the Naval\r\nHospital in Bethesda, sir. He had a large wound this size.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating a circle with your finger of the diameter of 5\r\ninches; would that be approximately correct?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, circular; yes, on this part of the head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating the rear portion of the head.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. More to the right side of the head?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Right. This was removed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say, \"This was removed,\" what do you mean by this?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The skull part was removed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Above the ear and back?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. To the left of the ear, sir, and a little high; yes.\r\nAbout right in here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say \"removed,\" by that do you mean that it was\r\nabsent when you saw him, or taken off by the doctor?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It was absent when I saw him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Fine. Proceed.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Entry into this man's head was right below that wound,\r\nright here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating the bottom of the hairline immediately to the\r\nright of the ear about the lower third of the ear?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Right. But it was in the hairline, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In his hairline?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Near the end of his hairline?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the size of that aperture?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The little finger.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating the diameter of the little finger.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, what was the position of that opening with respect to\r\nthe portion of the skull which you have described as being removed or\r\nabsent?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Well, I am going to have to describe it similar to this.\r\nLet's say part of your skull is removed here; this is below.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You have described a distance of approximately an inch and\r\na half, 2 inches, below.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is correct; about that, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. What other wounds, if any, did you notice on\r\nthe President?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The other wound that I noticed was on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which shoulder.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Right shoulder.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was it--what was its general position with respect to\r\nthe breadth of the back?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Right straight.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. No. Upper shoulder, lower shoulder; how far below the\r\nlower neckline would you say?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The upper neckline, sir, in that large muscle between\r\nthe shoulder and the neck, just below it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the size of that opening?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Again about the size of a little finger.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, have you described three wounds which you have\r\nobserved?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is three. The fourth one I will have to collaborate\r\nwith--the medical people in Dallas said that he had entry in the throat\r\nor an exit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, you are indicating a part on the throat right\r\nunderneath your tie as you sit there, the knot of your tie.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who told you that?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This comes from a report from Dr. Kemp Clark.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you talk to Dr. Clark personally?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I did not. This is a written report.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. This is a written report which you have read?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes; that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have any knowledge of that wound on the front side\r\naside from the written report of Dr. Kemp Clark?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Except that in the morgue it was very visible that they\r\nhad incisioned him here to insert the tracheotomy that they performed\r\non him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So with the operative procedures to perform a tracheotomy,\r\nwas there anything, in your view, left of the original entry?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Entry or exit that you have described.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All you could see at that point was the operative\r\nprocedure, the cutting of the surgeon's blade in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You are saying this, then, that you did not see,\r\nyourself, at any time the mark of any wound in his neck front?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. When we took him into the hospital in Dallas; that is\r\nright.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right; when we took him in the hospital in\r\nDallas, I did not.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you ever see it?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Only after he was opened up in the morgue; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You saw some indication or some mark of a wound in the\r\nfront of his neck?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Senator, from the report of the doctor who worked on him\r\nin Dallas, that he enlarged the incision here in his throat to perform\r\nthat tracheotomy, and I believe in his own statement that that wound\r\nwas there prior to this incision.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I know, but I am asking----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I didn't see it, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What you saw yourself?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; I didn't.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was that because Hill had thrown his coat over the\r\nPresident, or just didn't see the skin or the body at the time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir. When I--that coat was thrown over, sir, to\r\neliminate any gruesome pictures.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How far over that body? Did it go over the head\r\nonly or down the chest?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; the whole coat went all the way down to the\r\nwaistline, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You saw the President's face, though, at a later time as\r\nyou have described?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, thank you. This I had lost track of, to help you\r\nout, Mr. Congressman. While he lay on the stretcher in that emergency\r\nroom his collar and everything is up and I saw nothing in his face to\r\nindicate an injury, whether the shot had come through or not. He was\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But while he was on the stretcher in the emergency\r\nroom you saw his face?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But he had his tie and his collar still----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Still on.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Still on?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You never saw his neck?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. At that time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. At that time, I did not observe him.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The only time you saw him was later at the morgue?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Very much, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any blood on the portion of his body in\r\nthe neck area or anyplace in the front of his body?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I don't recall any.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any hole in the clothing of the President\r\non the front part, in the shirt or tie area?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. From your observation of the wound which you observed in\r\nthe morgue which you have described as a tracheotomy, would that have\r\nbeen above or below the shirtline when the President was clothed?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It would have been below the shirtline, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, have you described all of the wounds of the President\r\nto which you have referred?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe the three wounds which I believe you\r\nsaid Governor Connally sustained?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I am going to refer to the medical report on Governor\r\nConnally, wherein they said one wound was in his right back----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating the upper shoulder area?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir. One went through his wrist.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating the right wrist.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I am using the numbers, and he was--a missile went into\r\nhis thigh somewhere.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know anything about Governor Connally's wounds\r\naside from what you read in the medical report?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; not personally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have any independent knowledge of which wrist and\r\nwhich thigh, aside from what you read in the medical reports themselves?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; I do, I talked to the Governor several times\r\nlater, and it is the right wrist, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. It is the right wrist?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And which thigh?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It would be the left one.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is this a good point for a recess?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. This is fine.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. We will take a 5-minute break.\r\n\r\n(Short recess.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The Commission will resume, and will you proceed,\r\nMr. Specter, please?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes sir. One of your last answers was that the position\r\nof the wounds on Governor Connally was ascertained from a conversation\r\nbetween you and Governor Connally, as well as from the medical reports\r\nthemselves. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; it is really not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then tell us what your basis is for your testimony on\r\nGovernor Connally's wounds.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I have never conversed with the Governor as to his other\r\nwounds outside of his wrist. Your medical report on Governor Connally\r\nwhich indicate the shoulder wound, wrist, and in the thigh.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When did you have occasion to talk to him about his wrist\r\nwound?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Over the holidays in Texas, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The Christmas holidays?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now told us everything you know, either from\r\nconversations or reports, about the wounds of Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Were you able to observe at the time of the\r\nshooting and immediately thereafter, as Governor Connally went into the\r\nhospital, any of his specific wounds?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Only of the--I am presuming now of the hand because,\r\nwhen he was lying, he had it across his stomach here, and it was rather\r\nbloody.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was it the hand that was bloody, the stomach, or both?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I would say so right now; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The hand.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the stomach bloody at all?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Not that I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add, Mr. Kellerman, on the total\r\nnumber of wounds in relationship to your view that there were more than\r\nthree shots?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Well, let's consider the vehicle.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Fine. What about the vehicle would you consider relevant\r\nin this regard?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The windshield itself, which I observed a day or two\r\nafter the funeral here, had been hit by a piece of this missile or\r\nmissiles, whatever it is, shell.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. While you are referring to the windshield, permit me to\r\nhand you a photograph marked Commission Exhibit 349 and ask if you can\r\ntell us what that photograph depicts?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This photograph is the windshield of the Presidential\r\nspecial automobile that we used in Dallas on November 22. And it\r\ndepicts a hit by some instrument on the metal railing that covers the\r\nwindshield.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In what position is the hit on that metal railing?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Directly to the right of the mirror.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that on the top of the windshield?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is on the top of the windshield. I am sorry; this\r\nis not the windshield itself; this is the top of the vehicle. This is\r\nthe framework.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you draw a red arrow with the pen that you have to\r\nthe mark which you have just described?\r\n\r\n(Mr. Kellerman marked the photograph.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, when did you first observe that indentation?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This was observed a day or two after the funeral, which\r\nfuneral was the 25th of November; this would be upward of the 27th.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was the automobile at the time you observed that\r\nindentation?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. At the White House garage, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the windshield in the automobile at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; it was in the automobile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe or notice that indentation in the\r\nwindshield when you were in Dallas after the shooting occurred?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe or notice that indentation before the\r\nshooting occurred?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you able to state positively whether or not that\r\nindentation was present before the shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that you observed it on the first occasion when you\r\nsaw the car in the White House garage on or about November 27; is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is correct, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The indentation could conceivably have been present before\r\nthe shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It could have; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But you didn't observe it before the shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you not observe it in Dallas after the shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any occasion to examine closely the\r\nwindshield area after the assassination in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any occasion to examine closely the\r\nwindshield at any time after the assassination until you saw the car in\r\nthe garage on or about November 27?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir; I have not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe for the record where that indentation\r\noccurs or is placed?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This indentation is placed on the metal-bar framework\r\nwhich is across the top of the windshield. The indentation is directly\r\nto the right of the mirror holder.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that on the inside or the outside of the car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This is on the inside of the car.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What prompted you to make that investigation on or\r\nabout November 27?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. First, Mr. Congressman, I wanted to look this car over\r\nfor--let me go back a little bit. When this car was checked over that\r\nnight for its return to Washington, I was informed the following day\r\nof the pieces of these missiles that were found in the front seat, and\r\nI believe aside from the skull, that was in the rear seat, I couldn't\r\nconceive even from elevation how this shot hit President Kennedy like\r\nit did. I wanted to view this vehicle, whether this was a slant blow\r\noff the car, whether it hit the car first and then hit him, or what\r\nother marks are on this vehicle, and that is what prompted me to go\r\naround and check it over myself.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Had anybody told you of this indentation prior to\r\nyour own personal investigation?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Not of the windshield; no, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You were the first one to find this indentation?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I believe I am the first one who noticed this thing up\r\non the bar.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is what I meant.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You are the first one to notice this particular\r\nindentation?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes; I believe I am, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to examine the windshield or the\r\nframework closely before the assassination, either in Dallas or in\r\nWashington?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; I honestly didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, I move for the admission to evidence of\r\nExhibit No. 349.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It will be so admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to, heretofore marked Commission Exhibit No. 349\r\nfor identification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now I hand to Mr. Kellerman, through the Chairman,\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 350, and ask you to describe what this picture\r\nrepresents?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This picture represents the windshield of the\r\nPresident's special automobile as we are looking into it. This is an\r\noutside photo. My reason for this is that on inspection there is a--the\r\nwindshield has been struck by an instrument and it has been cracked.\r\nThis crack is opposite the mirror facing the driver would be toward the\r\ndriver, to the right of the mirror, and----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The photograph, Exhibit 350, is from the outside of the\r\ncar front looking toward the car; correct?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What mark, if any, appears in the photograph on the\r\nwindshield itself?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. There is the cracked windshield located to the right of\r\nthe mirror as you look into the automobile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That would be on the driver's side, as you previously\r\nstated?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; on the driver's side of the vehicle.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, is this picture an accurate representation of the\r\nappearance of the windshield at some time when you observed the\r\nwindshield?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This windshield I observed on this same day.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On or about November 27, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does that picture accurately represent what the windshield\r\nlooked like on that day when you observed it?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any crack in the windshield as\r\nthe President's automobile was being driven from the point of\r\nassassination to the hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe it at any time prior to the time you saw\r\nthe automobile in the White House garage on or before November 27?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I did not, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any occasion to examine closely the\r\nwindshield after the time of the shooting up until the time you saw it\r\nin the White House garage?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, at the time of your examination of the windshield in\r\nthe White House garage, did you feel the windshield?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. On the day that I visited the White House garage and\r\nchecked this car over for my own personal reasons, and this windshield\r\ncrack was pointed out to me, I did----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say it was pointed out to you, by whom?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. There were other people in the garage, Mr. Specter, like\r\nMr. Kinney, I believe was there at the time, Special Agent Henry Rybka\r\nwas the other person.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was it sufficiently prominent without having to have it\r\npointed out specially?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Oh, yes; very much. And I felt this windshield both\r\ninwardly and outwardly to determine first if there was something that\r\nwas struck from the back of us or--and I was satisfied that it was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say struck from in back of you, do you mean on\r\nthe inside or outside of the windshield?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Inside, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Inside of the car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to feel the outside of the\r\nwindshield?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I did on that day; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you feel, if anything?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Not a thing; it was real smooth.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to feel the inside of the windshield?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How did that feel to you?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. My comparison was that the broken glass, broken\r\nwindshield, there was enough little roughness in there from the cracks\r\nand split that I was positive, or it was my belief, that whatever hit\r\nit came into the inside of the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I move for the admission into evidence of Exhibit No. 350.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It will be so admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to, heretofore marked Commission Exhibit No. 350\r\nfor identification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now call the attention of the Commission to Exhibit\r\nNo. 351, which is the windshield itself which, as the Commission may\r\nobserve, is present in the hearing room. Now, with reference to Exhibit\r\nNo. 351, which is a marking placed over a glass object, Mr. Kellerman,\r\ncan you describe for the Commission what that is?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes; this windshield, which has since been removed from\r\nthe vehicle, at the time I first viewed it, this area marked in here\r\nwas all that was cracked. These are later splints.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Before you proceed, Mr. Kellerman, do you have knowledge\r\nas to the general removal procedure during which this windshield was\r\ntaken from the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I believe I do not. However, I believe Mr. Greer would\r\nbe able to identify it better than I, on the removal side.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe the condition of the windshield in its\r\npresent state as we are viewing it here this morning?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The windshield this morning has--has been hit by some\r\nobject with sufficient force----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Perhaps we ought to start with the point of impact, Mr.\r\nKellerman. First, are you able to positively identify this as the\r\nwindshield from the President's automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; I would say it was, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is this the same windshield as depicted in Exhibits 349\r\nand 350?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Now, starting with the principal point of\r\nimpact, where does that exist on this windshield?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The principal point of impact is located to the left of\r\nthe mirror, to the right above the driver's head, and to the right of\r\nhis, I am going to say, view line.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As we view the windshield at this time, state whether or\r\nnot there are spidering lines which have emanated from that point which\r\nyou have described as the principal point of impact?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The spidering lines which extend in three different\r\ndirections--you are speaking of the large ones or the others?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, I want to put on this record all of the spidering\r\nlines which exist here.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. OK; the spidering lines which are in this encircled area\r\nreflect, in my opinion, that when the instrument hit this glass it\r\nshattered in half a dozen different ways.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well now, with respect to the cracks themselves, is there\r\na crack which goes in a generally upwardly direction slanting off in\r\nthe general direction of the driver?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. In the center of this, the impact of the center of this\r\nscratch, one goes directly to the top of the windshield.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On that line itself, is there a further splintering off of\r\nthat line at another point?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It then continues on a small leg, a straight leg, about\r\n3 inches from the original direction.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is there a change of direction at that point, or a\r\nbifurcation, dividing it into two parts?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, you have described in a generally upwardly direction\r\nof about 3 inches?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is there not a crack which then extends all the way to\r\nthe top of the windshield moving, in the direction of the left side of\r\nthe windshield from the driver facing it?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right. There is a complete crack from this\r\nso-called cutoff to the top right of the windshield right above the\r\nview line of the driver.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Taking that from a compass reading, would that be in a\r\ngenerally northeasterly direction?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; northeasterly.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. From a point 3 inches from the center crack,\r\nwhich we described as the principal point of impact, then, does there\r\nform a point of crack in a V-direction with the line you have already\r\ndescribed?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes; there does. There is a small splint, about 2\r\ninches, that heads directly north off from this splinter that goes in a\r\nnortheasterly direction.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Now, moving in a clockwise direction.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. In a clockwise direction.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What crack do you observe, if any?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I next observe on the eastward side of this center crack\r\na splint of about 3 inches long, which then makes a sharp veer to the\r\nsoutheast to the bottom of the windshield.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, moving further in a clockwise direction, what crack\r\ndo you next observe emanating from the central point of impact?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The next crack from the central point of impact extends\r\ndown about 3 inches, to the southeast, and then veers to a sharp\r\nsoutheast to the bottom of the windshield.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, moving further in a clockwise direction.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. From this point----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Let's continue to move from the central point of impact\r\nto finish up what divergent cracks there are from the central point of\r\nimpact. Is there one other?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. There is one other point left. This is completely in a\r\nwesterly direction about 3 inches from the center of impact, which then\r\nveers to the northwest to the top of the windshield.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there other cracks in the windshield?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. There is one other splint, which is from the\r\nsoutheasterly leg----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That would be southwesterly leg.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Southwesterly leg--I am sorry--that drops to within an\r\ninch of the bottom of the windshield, whereby another splint travels in\r\na northwesterly direction to about halfway of the windshield.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, have you described all of the visible cracks in the\r\nwindshield?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That has completed it, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As you have viewed this windshield, have you looked at it\r\nfrom the outside looking in or the inside looking out?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I have been looking from the outside looking in.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where you would have been if you had been, say, on\r\nthe front hood of the car when the windshield was in place on the\r\nautomobile?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I would have been--pardon?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On the hood of the car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. On the hood of the car this would have been facing me as\r\nit is sitting here today.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have there been any measures taken to protect the outer\r\nedges of this windshield in its position here in the hearing room?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes. A form of protective tape has been placed around\r\nthe entire windshield to protect it, to keep it intact.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there any differences in the cracks on the windshield\r\ntoday as it sits in our hearing room from its condition when you\r\nobserved it on or about November 27, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir. From the point of impact the four cracks that\r\nlooked in the four directions were the only ones on this windshield.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there any marking in color or otherwise on that piece\r\nof the windshield?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. There has been a yellow crayon marking the circumference\r\nof these four cracks, apparently before the windshield was removed from\r\nthe automobile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that yellow or red?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It is red.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were the cracks present within the circumference of that\r\nmarking present at the time you observed the windshield on or about\r\nNovember 27?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were any of the other marks present when you observed the\r\nwindshield on or about November 27?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you at this time feel the outside of the windshield\r\nand describe what, if anything, you feel at the point of impact?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The outside markings from the point of impact, the\r\nextended lines----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Kellerman. I would like for you at this time to\r\nactually touch the outside and tell me, first of all, if it is the same\r\nor if it differs in any way from the sense of feel which you noted when\r\nyou touched it on or about November 27?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. As I touch the outside on the impact, it would be the\r\nsame as I noticed on the 27th of November.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What do you notice, if anything?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It is a smooth surface without any----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Without any--finish your answer.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. On the inside.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. No; before. It is a smooth surface without any what?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Without any crack lines.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On the outside?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That can be felt.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On the outside?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right; on the outside of the windshield.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Feel the inside and tell us, first of all, whether it is\r\nthe same or different from the way you touched it on November 27?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. On November 27, when I felt the inside of this impact\r\narea, I was convinced that I could--that I felt an opening in one of\r\nthese lines, which was indicative to me that the blow was struck from\r\nthe inside of the car on this windshield.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does it feel the same to you today as it did on or about\r\nNovember 27?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. As a matter of fact, it feels rather smooth today.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. It feels somewhat differently today than it felt before?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes; it does.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Could we ask when the red circle was placed on the\r\nwindshield, if you know?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I do not know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. With respect to the shattering which existed on or about\r\nNovember 27, which is within the red circle, could that condition have\r\nexisted on November 22 after the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Absolutely not. I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the reason for your expressing your thought that\r\nit could not have existed?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This automobile is never out of sight of any agent, or\r\neven a police officer, before it is used--used or afterward. Let me\r\nclarify that. The agent that accompanied these cars to Dallas was with\r\nthe vehicles from the time they left Washington aboard this plane.\r\nOne of his many duties outside of keeping it, having this car run\r\nperfectly, is that all the equipment is in perfect condition.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Kellerman, what you are saying, then, is there had\r\nbeen no crack in the windshield prior to the time of the shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. My next question is: Did you observe any crack in the\r\nwindshield after the shooting on November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any occasion to look for or examine for any\r\ncrack in the windshield after the shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I had no occasion whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. If the crack in the windshield had been as prominent as it\r\nwas on or about November 27, 1963, would you have observed it after the\r\nshooting on November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir; I don't think I would have.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Is it correct then to say that you didn't find any\r\noccasion to examine the windshield after you heard the shots?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right, I did not have the opportunity.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And after the President was removed from the automobile,\r\ndid you ever go back and examine the car, including the windshield?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Not in Dallas; no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. To be absolutely certain our record is straight on this\r\npoint, when you observed this windshield on or about November 27, 1963,\r\nwas the windshield in or out of the car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It was in the car. This was the same day they were going\r\nto remove it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did they remove it later that day, to your knowledge?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes; they did, and the mechanics were there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you there at the time this was removed?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But the mechanics had arrived preparatory to removing it?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Kellerman, we intended to describe the windshield\r\nin detail prior to your mentioning it, but to go back to your train\r\nof thought, you had brought up the windshield in response to my\r\nquestion about whether you had told us everything that you had in mind\r\nwhen you expressed the view that there were more than three shots.\r\nNow, remaining on the subject of the windshield, what fact about the\r\nwindshield was important in your mind when you expressed the view that\r\nthere must have been more than three shots?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I may be a little--I am not ahead of myself in your\r\ninvestigation of this case, but I think with the evidence that you\r\nall have on the numbers, on the pieces of evidence that were found in\r\nthe car, plus the fact that you have a missile that was received from\r\nDallas, from one of the stretchers, plus the fact of the missile that,\r\nto my knowledge, hasn't been removed from Governor Connally--it may\r\nhave, I don't know--count up to more than three to me, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right; fine. But focusing just a moment on the\r\nwindshield in and of itself, is there any physical factor or\r\ncharacteristic of the windshield other than those already described for\r\nthe record which has any bearing on your conclusion about the number of\r\nshots?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; it does not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, moving on to the other pieces of evidence which you\r\nhave just described, you referred to pieces of evidence in the car.\r\nWhat did you mean when you made that reference, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I have--I was told, although this is a hearsay thing----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. For these purposes, please tell us whatever you are\r\nreferring to, whatever its source, hearsay or not.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Okay; fine. That when they examined that vehicle that\r\nnight, when it was brought back to Washington, D.C., two pieces of a\r\nbullet or bullets were found on the passenger side on the floor of the\r\nfront seat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe those?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who told you that, or what report?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Mr. Boring--Floyd Boring.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who is Mr. Boring?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. He is also an assistant special agent in charge.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is he currently with the Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. He is currently with the Secret Service at the White\r\nHouse; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were those two pieces of bullet described with more\r\nparticularity than you have mentioned?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; they were not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were they described as fragments of bullets as\r\ndistinguished from whole bullets?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Right, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But do you have any information as to the size of the\r\nfragments?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; I do not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there any other pieces of evidence in the car that you\r\nwere referring to there?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The only other piece of evidence in the car was\r\nPresident Kennedy's skull.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Do you know what was done with those fragments\r\nthat Mr. Boring told you about?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know whether or not those were turned over to the\r\nFBI?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I would say they were probably turned over to the FBI;\r\nyes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And why would you say they probably were?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Because they were assigned to going over the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was it their procedure to turn over whatever they found to\r\nthe FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, is there anything special in the nature of the skull\r\nwhich you just mentioned which would have any bearing on the number of\r\nshots fired in this assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, but it would be one shell, one shot.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That would be your conclusion?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That would be my conclusion.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That it would take one shot to have separated that portion\r\nof skull?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You mentioned a missile found on a stretcher in Dallas.\r\nWill you elaborate on what you were referring to there?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This was given, I believe, in your statements there, to\r\na Special Agent Johnsen. I haven't seen this missile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you referring there to the missile which was found on\r\nthe stretcher and to the sequence of events from which it was traced\r\nback to one of the two victims of this shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have any more knowledge about that other than that\r\nwhich you have already mentioned?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; I do not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You mentioned a missile which was not removed from\r\nGovernor Connally. Specifically, what did you refer to there?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. There was in the early--this was on the day in Parkland\r\nMemorial Hospital, and this information comes from Dr. George Burkley,\r\nthe President's physician, when, I believe, I asked him the condition\r\nof Governor Connally, and have they removed the bullet from him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did Dr. Burkley say?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Dr. Burkley said that to his knowledge he still has the\r\nbullet in him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at what time on November 22 was that?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This was after we got into the hospital after the\r\nshooting, sir, between then and 2 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that the operation on Governor Connally had not been\r\ncompleted at that point?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is correct, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have any additional knowledge about any bullet in\r\nGovernor Connally?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I do not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now told us about all of the facts which you took\r\ninto account in your conclusion that there were more than three shots?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add, Mr. Kellerman, by way of\r\nexplanation or elaboration, to tell us which might be helpful with\r\nrespect to your conclusion based on all of these items which you have\r\ndescribed to us that there were more than three shots?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Gentlemen, I think if you would view the films yourself\r\nyou may come up with a little different answer.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, have you viewed the films, Mr. Kellerman?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I have; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there something special in your viewing of the films\r\nwhich led you to believe that there were more than three shots?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; it doesn't point out more than three shots, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which films are you referring to?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. These are the colored ones that were taken on the right\r\nside.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Taken by Mr. Abraham Zapruder?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You are not familiar with the photographer?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; I am not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, can you describe the view you say is from the\r\nright-hand side of the automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that would be on the side of the road where the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository Building was?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And approximately where did those pictures begin and end?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. These pictures began as we turned off Houston Street\r\nonto Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where did they end?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. As we are, just before we are, going into the viaduct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were those black and white or in color?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; they were colored.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you seen any other films of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes; I saw a black-and-white, but I didn't--I saw a\r\nblack-and-white film. However, I didn't get enough out of it there\r\nto----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Before proceeding any further, I would like to move for\r\nthe introduction in evidence of Exhibit 351.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It is approved.\r\n\r\n(The windshield referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 351 for\r\nidentification and was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything at all to add which you think might\r\nbe helpful, Mr. Kellerman, on the question of how many shots were\r\nfired, or have you told us everything you have in mind on that question?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I believe I have, Mr. Specter.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What was the name of the special agent driving the\r\ncar--the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. William Greer.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. He was the one to whom you spoke when you heard the\r\nreport?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Has he ever expressed any opinion to you as to the\r\nnumber of shots that were fired?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir. I think we are all of the opinion, Senator,\r\nthat we know of three.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Kellerman, referring to Commission Exhibit No. 347,\r\nwill you pinpoint as precisely as you can on that aerial shot, aerial\r\npicture, where the President's car was at the time of the first shot?\r\nAnd mark that, if you would, please, with an \"X\" in red pencil.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. My guess would be right in here, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, would you mark as closely as you can where the\r\nPresident's car was at the time of the second shot and mark that with a\r\n\"Y\" in red.\r\n\r\n(Mr. Kellerman marking the picture.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, you have marked the cars being in approximately the\r\nmiddle of the road; is that accurate, as you recollect it?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is the general procedure, Mr. Specter; they were\r\ntraveling in the center of the road.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, with respect to the time of the third shot, would\r\nyour marking be any different from the \"Y\" position?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; it would not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, from the time of the shooting until the time the\r\nautomobile arrived at Parkland Hospital, did anyone in the President's\r\ncar say anything that you have not already told us about?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Kellerman, there is a report from the Federal Bureau\r\nof Investigation designated \"Bureau File No. 105\"--I believe there is\r\nan \"S\", although it is somewhat illegible on my copy--\"S2555, report\r\nof Special Agent Robert P. Gemberling,\" dated December 10, 1963, which\r\nrefers to an interview of you by Special Agent Francis X. O'Neill, Jr.,\r\nand James W. Sibert, in which the following is set forth:\r\n\r\n\"He\"--and this obviously refers to you--\"advised that he heard a shot\r\nand immediately turned around looking past Governor Connally who was\r\nseated directly in back of him, to the President. He observed the\r\nPresident slumped forward and heard him say 'get me to a hospital.'\r\nMr. Kellerman then heard Mrs. Kennedy say, 'Oh, no,' as the President\r\nleaned toward her.\" That is the end of the quotation. My question is:\r\nDid you hear him; did you hear President Kennedy say, \"Get me to a\r\nhospital\"?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you hear Mrs. Kennedy say, \"Oh, no\"?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have any knowledge or explanation as to why you\r\nwould have been so quoted in the report of the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. When these two gentlemen talked to me, I don't know\r\nwhere they got those quotes, because the only two things that I told\r\nthem, they were interested in what I heard from the people in the back\r\nseat, and one said \"my God, I have been hit,\" which was President\r\nKennedy, and Mrs. Kennedy said, \"What are they doing to you?\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You were interviewed, however, by Mr. O'Neill and Mr.\r\nSibert on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. November what?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. November 22.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No. November 22 is when they were in the morgue with me.\r\nThey interviewed me in the office that--it was around the 27th. This\r\nwas after the funeral.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did they have any conversation with you about these events\r\nin the morgue?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Not that I recall, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have a discussion with either of those gentlemen\r\nabout anything while you were at the morgue on November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The only thing I can recall discussionwise--I just\r\nforget which one it was, one of the two--this was before we even knew\r\nthat a shell had been found from the hole in the President's shoulder.\r\nWe couldn't determine what happened to it. They couldn't find it in the\r\nmorgue; they couldn't find any leeway as to whatever happened to the\r\nshell when it hit the President's shoulder; where did it go. So our\r\ncontention was that while he was on the stretcher in Dallas, and the\r\nneurosurgeon was working over him no doubt with pressure on the heart,\r\nthis thing worked itself out.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say \"our contention,\" what do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. One of these agents--I forget which one it was; it could\r\nhave been Sibert or O'Neill, but I am not sure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did what?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. We--our discussion or my discussion.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You had a discussion and when you say \"our contention\" by\r\nthat do you mean that was the conclusion you came to?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Conclusion--that is right, sir--as to where this bullet\r\nwent into the shoulder and where did it go.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. While you are on that subject, was there any conversation\r\nat the time of the autopsy on that matter itself?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Very much so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you relate to the Commission the nature of that\r\nconversation and the parties to it?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. There were three gentlemen who were performing this\r\nautopsy. A Colonel Finck--during the examination of the President,\r\nfrom the hole that was in his shoulder, and with a probe, and we were\r\nstanding right alongside of him, he is probing inside the shoulder with\r\nhis instrument and I said, \"Colonel, where did it go?\" He said, \"There\r\nare no lanes for an outlet of this entry in this man's shoulder.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you say anything in response to that?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I said, \"Colonel, would it have been possible that while\r\nhe was on the stretcher in Dallas that it works itself out?\" And he\r\nsaid, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any additional conversation between you and\r\nColonel Finck at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Not on that point; no, sir; not on that point.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any conversation of any sort between you and\r\nColonel Finck which would be helpful to us here?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Well, from Humes, who was the other gentleman out there,\r\nfrom the entry of the skull, from this hole here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You are now referring to the hole which you describe being\r\nbelow the missing part of the skull?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; it was confirmed that the entry of the shell\r\nhere went right through the top and removed that piece of the skull.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who confirmed that?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. One of the three gentlemen; I don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You don't recall which one, but it was one of the three\r\ndoctors doing the autopsy?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So you are saying it confirmed that the hole that was\r\nbelow the piece of skull that was removed, was the point of entry of\r\nthe one bullet which then passed up through the head and took off the\r\nskull?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Right, sir. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then that was all done by one bullet, based on what you\r\nare telling us at this moment?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. From the confirmation that one of the three doctors made?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, was there any other conversation between you and\r\nColonel Finck or Commander Humes----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At that time, which was important on the subject we are\r\ndiscussing?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Actually, from all the X-rays that were taken, and we\r\nviewed them all together; when I say \"we,\" I am saying the medical\r\npeople who were in the morgue at the time, the two Bureau agents,\r\nmyself, and also Mr. Greer, who was in there with me, naturally, they\r\nwere looking for pieces of fragmentation of this bullet. There was\r\nnone; only one piece to my knowledge. That was removed inside above the\r\neye, the right eye.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You have now told us all about the conversations between\r\nyou and Colonel Finck and Commander Humes and anyone else at the\r\nautopsy which are important on the positions of the hole and the wounds\r\nin the head?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Right, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any other conversation with either Special\r\nAgent O'Neill or Special Agent Sibert of the FBI on November 22, 1963,\r\nother than your conversations about the wounds on President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Kellerman, while we are discussing this in\r\nrelationship to your conversations with Special Agents O'Neill and\r\nSibert, were there any other comments made by anybody else present\r\nat the autopsy about the path of the bullet into Mr. Kennedy's back,\r\nrelating to whether there was any point of exit or anything of that\r\nsort?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Colonel Finck did all the talking, sir. He was the only\r\none.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, have you told us everything Colonel Finck said about\r\nthat subject?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Very much so; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that there is nothing that was said on that subject\r\nother than what you have already told us about?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Kellerman, I have read to you a part of what Special\r\nAgents O'Neill and Sibert have attributed to you in an interview which\r\nthey have written about on November 22, 1963. Referring to that in\r\nthe portion which I have read to you and which I will reread, I want\r\nyou to direct your attention to the issue about which way you turned.\r\nThe report states, \"He advised he heard a shot and immediately turned\r\naround looking past Governor Connally who was seated directly in back\r\nof him to the President.\"\r\n\r\nNow, did that describe a turn to the right or to the left? This is a\r\ndifficult question. Let me interject one thing. We are presupposing\r\nhere, based on your testimony, that you did not discuss with Special\r\nAgents O'Neill or Sibert these specific events on November 22, to the\r\nbest of your recollection as we sit here today.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that the question really goes to a situation where\r\nperhaps they have an inaccurate day or your recollection is inaccurate\r\nas to some of the things you might have told them. So, my prefatory\r\nquestion would be whether that is an accurate statement and is\r\nsomething you told them at some time.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I don't believe I did. I think I will stand on my\r\noriginal statement.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The original statement you made here today?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; very much.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that the statement I just read to you, so far as your\r\nbest----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I can't----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So far as your best testimony is at this time, it was\r\nsimply not made by you on November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right, now. Was that statement I just read to you, the\r\nshort one about your turn, to the best of your recollection at this\r\nmoment, did you ever make that statement to Special Agents O'Neill\r\nand/or Sibert?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Mr. Specter, everybody I have talked to I have always\r\nturned to the right when I first heard the noise. I turned to my left\r\nto view the people in my back seat because it is a more comfortable\r\nposition. So I don't think the turning is correct, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you say the report is incorrect?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. May I ask--you have viewed these colored motion\r\npictures which were taken during the assassination. Have you looked at\r\nthose to see what your own actions were during this period of time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do they coincide with what you have testified to\r\nhere today?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. They certainly do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you a photograph marked Commission Exhibit No.\r\n352, and ask you if you can tell us what that picture represents?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; this was the rear seat of the President's car,\r\nsir, after all the occupants were removed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when did the rear seat of the President's car look\r\nlike the picture 352?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. After all the occupants were removed on the 22d of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When the car was parked at Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I don't know where this picture was taken, sir. This\r\ncould have been taken in the White House garage.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes; but aside from where the picture was taken, is that\r\nthe way the car looked at the time it was at Parkland Hospital after\r\nPresident Kennedy and Governor Connally were removed from the car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe for the written record very briefly what\r\nthis picture shows?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The picture shows the complete rear seat of the\r\nPresidential limousine.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What, if anything, is on the rear seat?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. On the seat part of this car is splattered with blood;\r\nthere are a few petals of flowers, and the back seat cushion part is\r\npretty well bloodied up.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I move for the introduction in evidence of Commission\r\nExhibit No. 352.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So admitted.\r\n\r\n(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 352 for\r\nidentification, and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you, through the Chairman, Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 353, move its admission into evidence, and ask you to tell us what\r\nthis depicts.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This is the same Presidential vehicle after the\r\noccupants have been removed from the rear seat. It shows the--a goodly\r\namount of blood that had remained on the cushion and back part of the\r\nseat and also little flower petals.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is Exhibit No. 353 an accurate representation of the way\r\nthe rear seat of the President's automobile looked after----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. After President Kennedy and Governor Connally were removed\r\nto Parkland Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You have described in answers to previous questions what\r\noccurred upon the arrival at Parkland of the President's automobile.\r\nWhat action, if any, did you take immediately after President Kennedy\r\nand Governor Connally were taken into the hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I believe we had got to the point where I had made\r\nthis phone call to Washington to alert these people back here of the\r\nincident.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And proceeding from that point?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. From this point, the agents who were in this followup\r\ncar had joined me in the emergency room. They took up security posts\r\nat entrance into the emergency room to keep it clear of all people\r\nexcept medical people. The only people allowed in there would be\r\nworkers. After this was done, Special Agent Kinney came to me and asked\r\npermission to remove the President's car and our followup car to the\r\nairport, to load it aboard this aircraft for shipment to Washington,\r\nand I said, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nAt that time the next move was Special Agent Warren Taylor, who was\r\nassigned to the then Vice President Johnson, came to me and he said,\r\n\"Mr. Johnson wants to talk to you.\" So, I followed him into this room\r\nthat they had the Johnson party in. He asked me the condition of\r\nPresident Kennedy, which I told him that President Kennedy is still in\r\nthe emergency room, his condition is serious. He then said, \"You let me\r\nknow of any developments.\"\r\n\r\nI then returned to the emergency room. By that time another shift of\r\nagents, who were at the Trade Mart on duty for prior to our arrival,\r\nreported into the emergency room. This is what is called as our\r\nafternoon shift, the 4 to 12. Mr. Roberts, whose group was on the\r\nfollowup car in the motorcade through Dallas, was the 8-to-4 shift.\r\nThe 4-to-12 shift then was under the supervision of Mr. Stewart Stout.\r\nI then instructed Mr. Roberts to take his shift, which were the day\r\npeople, and join Special Agent Rufus Youngblood and stay with Vice\r\nPresident Johnson.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many agents were they to take with them?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. They took the entire followup car, which would mean that\r\nthey had Roberts, Ready, Bennett, McIntyre; those four.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know where they went or what specifically they did\r\nby way of establishing security for Vice President Johnson?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; I really don't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was your next activity?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. My next move, then, my next part in this was--by this\r\ntime it was after 1 o'clock--I am trying to pinpoint time--after 1,\r\nbecause Dr. Burkley said that the President had died; it was after 1\r\no'clock. By this time other people who were in with Mr. Kennedy, such\r\nas his staff--I am speaking of Mr. O'Donnell, Mr. Powers, I believe\r\nLarry O'Brien--through them, and I believe Mr. Hill, they had obtained\r\na casket from one of the funeral people in town.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where had Mrs. Kennedy been during this time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Mrs. Kennedy was right outside the door to the emergency\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long, if at all, was she inside the emergency room\r\nwith President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This I can't truly answer. However, I should say that,\r\nas for the casket being brought into the hospital, another gentleman\r\ncame into this little doctor's room, his name I don't recall, but he\r\nrepresented himself to be from the Health Department or commission,\r\nsome form. He said to me, he said, \"There has been a homicide here, you\r\nwon't be able to remove the body. We will have to take it down there\r\nto the mortuary and have an autopsy.\" I said, \"No, we are not.\" And he\r\nsaid, \"We have a law here whereby you have to comply with it.\"\r\n\r\nWith that Dr. Burkley walked in, and I said, \"Doctor, this man is from\r\nsome health unit in town. He tells me we can't remove this body.\" The\r\nDoctor became a little enraged; he said, \"We are removing it.\" He\r\nsaid, \"This is the President of the United States and there should be\r\nsome consideration in an event like this.\" And I told this gentleman,\r\nI said, \"You are going to have to come up with something a little\r\nstronger than you to give me the law that this body can't be removed.\"\r\n\r\nSo, he frantically called everybody he could think of and he hasn't got\r\nan answer; nobody is home. Shortly he leaves this little room and it\r\nseems like a few minutes he is back and he has another gentleman with\r\nhim, and he said, \"This is\"--the name escapes me--he said, \"He is a\r\njudge here in Dallas,\" and he said, \"He will tell you whether you can\r\nremove this body or not.\" I said, \"It doesn't make any difference. We\r\nare going to move it,\" and I said, \"Judge, do you know who I am?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"Yes,\" and I said, \"There must be something in your\r\nthinking here that we don't have to go through this agony; the family\r\ndoesn't have to go through this. We will take care of the matter when\r\nwe get back to Washington.\" The poor man looked at me and he said, \"I\r\nknow who you are,\" and he said, \"I can't help you out.\" I said, \"All\r\nright, sir.\" But then I happened to look to the right and I can see\r\nthe casket coming on rollers, and I just left the room and let it out\r\nthrough the emergency entrance and we got to the ambulance and put it\r\nin, shut the door after Mrs. Kennedy and General McHugh and Clinton\r\nHill in the rear part of this ambulance.\r\n\r\nI am looking around for Mr. Greer and I don't spot him directly because\r\nI want to get out of here in a hurry, and I recognize Agent Berger and\r\nI said, \"Berger, you get in the front seat and drive and, Mr. Stout,\r\nyou get in the middle and I will set on this side,\" and as we are\r\nleaving--Mr. Lawson, I should say, was in a police car that led us away\r\nfrom Parkland Memorial Hospital. As we are leaving a gentleman taps on\r\nthe driver's window and they roll it down and he says, \"I will meet you\r\nat the mortuary.\" \"Yes, sir.\" We went to the airport, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who said, \"Yes, sir\"?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I did, sir. We went to the airport. In the meantime, Mr.\r\nJohnson had been taken to the airplane. They had secured the airport;\r\nnobody was there. They had removed seats off the rear part of the plane\r\nso we could put the body and the casket in it. As we got to the airport\r\nthe ramp was there; we opened the door, and we moved the casket out and\r\nwalked it right up to the plane.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any further difficulty of any sort----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Imposed by any Texas officials on the removal of the body?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir. Whatever happened to the hearse, I don't know.\r\nI never left the plane.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. We left the hospital; we have a time on that; it is 4\r\nminutes after 2. It is about a 10-minute ride to the airplane.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On the question of timing, pinning down these times as\r\nbest we can, how long did it take you to get from the shooting incident\r\nto the time you arrived at Parkland, based on your best estimates?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Mr. Specter, it seemed like hours, but we flew there, I\r\nhonestly don't know. I can't really tell you.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the best estimate of the speed of your vehicle en\r\nroute from the shooting to the hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I don't know.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Let the record show that Congressman Ford has to go to\r\nhis official duties in the House and that I, Senator Cooper, am now\r\nacting as Chairman.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Go ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Moving ahead, then, on to the sequences of time as best\r\nyou can recollect them, Mr. Kellerman, at what time was it ascertained\r\nthat the President had died and what was the basis of the pronouncement\r\nof death.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That was on the death certificate, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you learn at or about 1 o'clock, while you were at\r\nParkland Hospital, that he had died?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I would think so. However, at that time let me say that\r\nI wasn't watching any clock too closely and this time was given to me\r\nby Dr. Burkley.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then you have no independent recollection of time at\r\nParkland when the death was announced or pronounced?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, then, you have specified the time of departure from\r\nParkland Hospital and en route back to Love Field at what, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. We departed at 4 minutes after 2 from Parkland.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time did you arrive at the President's plane?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. 2:14.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were your next activities?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Our next time, we had waited until Judge Sarah Hughes\r\nhad arrived for the swearing-in ceremonies.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time did the swearing-in ceremonies occur?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. 2:37 p.m.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what time did the plane depart from Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. We left at 2:48.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you present during the swearing-in ceremonies?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In a general way, tell us who else was present there,\r\nrecognizing that you don't know all the people there.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes. President Johnson, Mrs. Johnson, Mrs. Kennedy,\r\nMalcolm Kilduff. He was the press secretary for that trip. Congressman\r\nThornberry, Congressman Thomas, Marie Fehmer, Mrs. Evelyn Lincoln,\r\nJack Valenti, Bill Moyers, Special Agent Johns. There was another\r\ncongressional man--I believe his name was Congressman Roberts--Brooks;\r\nI am sorry; Congressman Brooks. The picture was taken by Capt. Cecil\r\nStoughton and myself.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time did the President's plane arrive back at the\r\nWashington area?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. May I look at my notes, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, you may. Identify for us, if you will, what notes you\r\nare referring to.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. 5:58 p.m. This is my report.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Let the record show that Mr. Kellerman has just referred\r\nto a four-page report dated November 29, 1963, entitled \"The\r\nAssassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, at\r\nDallas, Tex.,\" which is a copy of a report he made, three of the sheets\r\nbeing carbon copies, and one being a photostatic reproduction. So that\r\nour record may be complete, let the record show that this is the same\r\nreport which Mr. Kellerman submitted to the Secret Service which was,\r\nin turn, submitted by the Secret Service to the Commission, as one of\r\nthe statements in Exhibit 12, statement 11, which was furnished by\r\nthe Secret Service to the Commission as the report of the U.S. Secret\r\nService on the assassination of President Kennedy, under the exhibits\r\nsection. I will return that to you.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Fine; thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were your activities; specifically where did you land\r\nin the Washington area?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. We landed at Andrews Air Force Base.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were your activities then, immediately after landing\r\nat Andrews?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. While en route from Dallas to Washington, D.C., I had\r\nseveral telephone communications with my special agent in charge,\r\nGerald Behn, concerning this, transportation for the people aboard\r\nthe plane, an ambulance for the body of President Kennedy, and my\r\ninstructions. I was instructed to stay with the late President\r\nKennedy. Aboard this plane were agents of the 4-to-12 shift which, as\r\nI mentioned earlier, was under the supervision of Mr. Stewart Stout;\r\na conference was held with Mr. Rufus Youngblood, who was in charge of\r\nthe Johnson detail at that time. He was informed that he would take\r\nall the agents under Mr. Stout's supervision and they would remain with\r\nthem for the remainder of the day. That I would have Special Agents\r\nHill, Landis, Greer, and O'Leary.\r\n\r\nAs we arrived at Andrews Air Force Base, arrangements were made prior\r\nto having a lift brought up to the rear end of the plane, whereby all\r\nthe agents were requested by Mrs. Kennedy to carry this casket from the\r\nplane to the ambulance. It was put aboard this carrier; from there we\r\ntook it from the carrier into the Navy ambulance. Mrs. Kennedy rode in\r\nthe back seat, or in the rear part of the ambulance, with Mr. Robert\r\nKennedy and General McHugh.\r\n\r\nIn the front seat the ambulance was driven by Special Agent Greer, of\r\nwhich Agents Landis and myself and Dr. Burkley rode in the front seat\r\nto the U.S. Naval Hospital in Bethesda. At that point Navy officials\r\nthere instructed us where to take the ambulance, to what part of the\r\nbuilding, and remove the casket into the morgue facilities.\r\n\r\nAs we landed in Andrews Air Force Base, I was met by our Chief, Mr.\r\nJames Rowley, who informed me that Mr. Sibert and Mr. O'Neill of the\r\nFBI would join me at the Naval Hospital and to allow them in. I also\r\ninformed him that the vehicles--that is, the President's car and our\r\nSecret Service followup car--are en route to Washington from Dallas,\r\nand that he should assign some members from our Washington field office\r\nto go over these cars for any evidence that might be left. In the\r\nmorgue, I should say that Special Agent Greer and myself remained all\r\nnight, Mr. O'Leary only briefly.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where did the----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The family was placed----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where did the family go?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. They were placed in a room in the tower section of the\r\nNaval Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you actually accompany the body from the vehicle to\r\nthe morgue room?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were you present during the entire autopsy?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Tell us in a general way----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I only left on three different occasions.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. For how long were you absent on those occasions?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. A minute or two to make a phone call.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. While the autopsy was in session, or when did you leave on\r\nthose three occasions?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. OK. First I was informed by a Navy personnel that I\r\nshould call Mr. Rowley. There wasn't any phone--there was a phone in\r\nthe room, but I wasn't aware of it at the time. So, I left and walked\r\nout into the corridor and called him. This was my first knowledge that\r\nthey had found a projectile. The second call, I think I called home;\r\nthat was my first call to home and that was it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, the projectile that you just referred to was found\r\nwhere?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This was the projectile that was reportedly given to our\r\nSpecial Agent Richard Johnsen as we were leaving the hospital in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How did you find out about that?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. He says it was given to him by a security man or\r\nsecurity officer in the hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When did you first hear about it?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The phone call with Mr. Rowley that morning after we had\r\ngot to the morgue.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time was this?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I am only guessing; 9 o'clock in the evening.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Nine o'clock in the evening. You had said morning; you\r\ndidn't mean morning; you meant 9 o'clock in the evening when you had a\r\ntelephone call. From whom was the call again?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Mr. Rowley, Chief of Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You got the phone call from Mr. Rowley?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who had called him, if you know?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But at that time Chief Rowley advised of the detection\r\nof the bullet on the stretcher and brought you up to date with what\r\ninformation was known at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, have you described all the times that you were absent\r\nfrom the room of the autopsy?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The only other time that I was absent was when the\r\nautopsy was about completed before the funeral directors were in, and\r\nit was my decision to get Mr. Hill down and view this man for all the\r\ndamage that was done; so I went up to the floor where they were at and\r\nbrought him down and he inspected the incisions.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was your reason for that, Mr. Kellerman?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. More witnesses, Mr. Specter; I think more to view the\r\nunfortunate happenings it would be a little better.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time did that autopsy start, as you recollect it?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Immediately. Immediately after we brought him right in.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time was that approximately, if you have a\r\nrecollection?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I don't have a recollection.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time did it end, if you recollect?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. We left the hospital for the White House at 3:56 in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. 3:56 a.m. on November 23?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did the autopsy last all that time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No. They were going to give these people a couple of\r\nhours that they worked on them.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, did you observe, during the course of the autopsy,\r\nbullet fragments which you might describe as little stars?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, of the numerous X-rays that were taken mainly of\r\nthe skull, the head. The reason for it was that through all the probing\r\nwhich these gentlemen were trying to pick up little pieces of evidence\r\nin the form of shell fragments, they were unable to locate any. From\r\nthe X-rays, when you placed the X-ray up against the light the whole\r\nhead looked like a little mass of stars, there must have been 30, 40\r\nlights where these pieces were so minute that they couldn't be reached.\r\nHowever, all through this series of X-rays this was the one that they\r\nfound, through X-ray that was above the right eye, and they removed\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How big a piece was that above the right eye, would you\r\nsay?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The tip of a matchhead, a little larger.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Let me ask a few questions. Mr. Kellerman, from what\r\nyou have just said, I think it would be correct that from the time you\r\nbegan to assist in removing President Kennedy from his car to the time\r\nyou left him in the emergency room that you never saw any bullet on a\r\nstretcher, either his stretcher or Governor Connally's stretcher?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I never saw any bullet, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I believe you testified that, at the time you heard\r\nthis first report, the President's car was approaching a viaduct?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Approaching, yes, but quite a little distance from it,\r\nsir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Can you make any estimate as to how far away it was.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I don't know the footage, Senator Cooper.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Can you see it?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes; oh, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Can you see the viaduct plainly?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Oh, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Could you tell whether anybody was standing on top of\r\nthe viaduct, or did you observe?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I didn't notice anybody up there at all, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you observe whether anyone was in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the viaduct?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Not at this distance; no.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Do you have any--at the time of the shots, at the time\r\nthat you were conscious of these shots being fired, do you have any\r\njudgment as to from what direction they came?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. None whatsoever. Except I should say again that when\r\nthis first one went off, which I indicated here that it sounded like\r\na firecracker to my right and, say, rear, I looked to my right to see\r\nwhat it was.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Then it would be correct to say it was your judgment at\r\nthe time, at the time of the report----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It was my judgment, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. That it was to the right and to the rear?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That would be correct. It was my judgment, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you observe any persons standing to the right of\r\nthe car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Maybe a handful.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you see anything to indicate that any shot had been\r\nfired by those persons?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir; not at the time.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. When you heard the report and turned, could you see\r\nthis building known as the Texas Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Not by name. You could see the building because we\r\npassed right in front of it, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You didn't know it as the Texas Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Not then, no, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Have you any idea how--what distance the President's\r\ncar traveled from the time you heard the first report until the time\r\nyou have described as hearing the flurry of shots?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; I really don't know the distance. It wasn't too far.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It wasn't too far.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. For the record, I have some more questions when we\r\nreconvene.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. We will recess then until 2 o'clock.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 12:35 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfternoon Session\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF ROY H. KELLERMAN, SPECIAL AGENT, SECRET SERVICE, RESUMED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission reconvened at 2 p.m.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The Commission will come to order.\r\n\r\nWill you proceed, Mr. Specter?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, thank you. Mr. Kellerman, immediately before the\r\nluncheon recess, Senator Cooper had asked some questions relating to\r\nthe presence of anyone on the triple overpass which was in front of\r\nthe President's car. Did you have any occasion, immediately before\r\nor immediately after the shooting, to look for anyone on the triple\r\noverpass or in that vicinity?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; I really didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you in a position to state, then, whether there was or\r\nwas not someone on the triple overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; I am in no position to state that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At the time of the shooting, did you observe any bullets\r\nricochet off of the windshield or off of any other part of the\r\nautomobile?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No. If any of the bullets ricocheted off the windshield\r\nor front part of the car, this would have been matter that was blown\r\nover mine and the driver's head from, I would say, the explosion of\r\nPresident Kennedy's head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But aside from the portions of President Kennedy's head\r\nwhich you have already testified about, you observed nothing detectable\r\nas being bullet fragments or bullets?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Ricocheting off any part of the car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you ever observe any bullet fragments in the car\r\nat rest after the shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe a priest at Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes; there were two.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And approximately what time were they present at the\r\nhospital?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. When we brought President Kennedy into the emergency\r\nroom, the request for a priest was made immediately by one of the\r\nmembers of the staff. I do not recall who called for one. However, in\r\nthe interim, a second call was sent out. Consequently, two showed; not\r\nat the same time, but one after the other.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long were they at the hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Just a matter of a couple of minutes of time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do you know where they went upon arrival at the\r\nhospital?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir. They went right in the emergency room with the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you in the emergency room at the time they were there?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do you know what services, if any, they performed\r\nwhile they were there?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any conversations with either of them while\r\nthey were en route, either coming or going?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. With respect to the state of readiness of Parkland\r\nHospital at your arrival, how long after you got there were stretcher\r\nbearers at the front door?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. To the best of my knowledge, there were no stretcher\r\nbearers at the car--none.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At your arrival?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did some come shortly after you arrived?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, what sequence did follow with respect to the arrival\r\nof the stretchers?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. When we arrived at the hospital, I had called to the\r\nagents to go inside and get two stretchers on wheels. Between those\r\npeople and police officers who also entered the emergency room, they\r\nbrought the stretchers out. I did not at any time see a man in a white\r\nuniform outside, indicating a medical person.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When did you first see the first indication of a doctor?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. When we got in the emergency room itself proper.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do you know which doctor that was?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Not by name or sight; no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many doctors did you see at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The room was full.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who were the individuals who brought the stretchers on\r\nwheels, if you know?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Agents who were in the followup car, police officers who\r\nwere ahead of us on motorcycles.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Kellerman, did you state how long the autopsy lasted\r\nwhen you testified this morning?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; I didn't. However, this is going to be an assumption\r\non time; I think I can pin it pretty well.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Give us your best estimate on that, please.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Let's come back to the period of our arrival at Andrews\r\nAir Force Base, which was 5:58 p.m. at night. By the time it took us\r\nto take the body from the plane into the ambulance, and a couple of\r\ncarloads of staff people who followed us, we may have spent 15 minutes\r\nthere. And in driving from Andrews to the U.S. Naval Hospital, I would\r\njudge, a good 45 minutes. So there is 7 o'clock. We went immediately\r\nover, without too much delay on the outside of the hospital, into the\r\nmorgue. The Navy people had their staff in readiness right then. There\r\nwasn't anybody to call. They were all there. So at the latest, 7:30,\r\nthey began to work on the autopsy. And, as I said, we left the hospital\r\nat 3:56 in the morning. Let's give the undertaker people 2 hours. So\r\nthey were through at 2 o'clock in the morning. I would judge offhand\r\nthat they worked on the autopsy angle 4-1/2, 5 hours.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were you present when the funeral director's personnel\r\nwere preparing the body?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I was; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And about what time, then, did they complete their work?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. They were all through at 3:30.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you do immediately after they completed their\r\nwork?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. All right. Our communication between the Kennedy family\r\nand staff, who were on another floor in the hospital, was in this\r\nregard. We had telephone communication whereby we would tell them if\r\nthe body is ready to be taken out of the morgue and into the ambulance.\r\nAnd they would hit the elevator and come right out the same way. So the\r\n5 minutes it took to load the people in, we left the hospital morgue\r\npart at least at 3:50, and, as I say, we were off at 3:56, driving to\r\nthe White House.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you go directly to the White House?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; we did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did that complete your tour of duty for that day?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; it did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, with respect to the time you were present at the\r\nautopsy, was there any conversation of any sort concerning the\r\npossibility of a point of entry from the front of the President's body?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You have testified about the impression you had as to the\r\nsource of the first shot, which sounded to you like a firecracker. Did\r\nyou have any impression as to the source of the other shots, which you\r\ndescribed as being a flurry?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. If you will excuse me just a minute. I was trying to\r\nelaborate on the last question.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Pardon me. Go ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Just for the record, I wish to have this down. While the\r\nPresident is in the morgue, he is lying flat. And with the part of the\r\nskull removed, and the hole in the throat, nobody was aware until they\r\nlifted him up that there was a hole in his shoulder. That was the first\r\nconcrete evidence that they knew that the man was hit in the back first.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When did they lift him up and first observe the hole in\r\nthe shoulder?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. They had been working on him for quite some time,\r\nMr. Specter--through the photos and other things they do through an\r\nautopsy. And I believe it was this Colonel Finck who raised him and\r\nthere was a clean hole.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was said, if anything, by those present at the\r\nautopsy concerning the wound in the throat?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. To go back just a little further, the reason for the\r\nhole in the throat, the tracheotomy; I am thinking they were of the\r\nopinion that when the--when he was shot in the head, and they had found\r\nthis piece remaining above the eye underneath; I am sure there was some\r\nconcern as to where the outlet was, and whether they considered--this\r\nis all an assumption now; whether they considered this--that there was\r\na hole here in the throat prior to the tracheotomy, I don't know. But\r\nto complete the examination, they lifted him up by the shoulders, and\r\nthere was this hole. Now, I think you asked me a question. Could you\r\nrepeat it, please?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, let's be sure that we have your final answer on the\r\nquestion of any conversation at all about a point of entry in the front\r\npart of his body, in his throat, or any place else.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I don't believe, Mr. Specter, that it was ever concluded\r\nthat there was an entry in the front.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then that completes the conversations at the autopsy?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On any of the subjects I have asked you about?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The question which I had then started to ask you was\r\nwhether you had any impression at the time of the second and third\r\nshots, which you described as a flurry of shots, as to the point of\r\norigin or source of those shots.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The only answer I can give to that is that they would\r\nhave to come from the rear.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, is that the impression or reaction you had at the\r\ntime of the flurry?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever, since the time of the assassination to this\r\ndate, had any contrary impression, reaction, or view that the shots\r\ncame from the front of the President?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, Mr. Kellerman, with respect to the immediate reaction\r\nby you to the emergency situation, did you consider at any time leaving\r\nyour seat, on the right front of the President's automobile, to go into\r\nthe rear portion, where the President sat?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is the basis for--or what was the basis for your\r\nconclusion on that?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. After I had heard President Kennedy's voice say, \"My\r\nGod, I am hit,\" I viewed him, which was enough for me that he was. My\r\ndecision was to get this man to a hospital, because he needed medical\r\ntreatment. And during the few seconds that I instructed the driver to\r\nget out of here, we are hit, my second instruction was to the man in\r\nthe lead car ahead of us for the same, to lead us to a hospital, that\r\nwe are hit. I then turn around, and I had two people injured. Not only\r\nwas the President down in his seat; the Governor was down in his seat.\r\nMy presence back there was gone. On top of that, I had Mr. Hill lying\r\nacross that trunk.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What do you mean when you say, sir, that your presence\r\nback there was gone?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. They were comfortable, if there is a comfort in this.\r\nMr. Hill was taking care of Mrs. Kennedy. Mrs. Connally was over the\r\nGovernor; there was no motion. The next thing was a doctor, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you consider presenting a further shield for the\r\nPresident at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did the metallic handhold which you described early in\r\nyour testimony as being about 15 inches off the top of the seat and\r\ngoing all the way across the width of the car, did that metal structure\r\npresent any substantial impediment to your moving from the front seat\r\nto the rear seat of the automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Mr. Specter, I think it would have been a small\r\nobstacle. However, let me say this: If I thought in my own mind that\r\nI was needed back there, there wouldn't have been an obstacle strong\r\nenough to hold me.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about the presence of Governor Connally in the jump\r\nseat? Would the presence of Governor Connally or any passenger in the\r\njump seat provide a substantial obstacle to your moving from your seat\r\nto shield the President's body?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Not at all. It wouldn't have made any difference, sir.\r\nWhy? Because my job is to protect the President, sir, regardless of the\r\nobstacles.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Mr. Greer at any time use the radio in your car?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Kellerman, did the President's automobile at any time\r\nslow down after the first shot?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; not that I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, that completes our questions, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. As you turned from Houston onto Elm, you were then\r\nfacing the triple overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You were looking forward at the time?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You were not looking to the side particularly, or\r\nback at all?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Don't let me change your thought, Mr. Congressman. But\r\nas we turned left on Elm, there is also another curve before you get to\r\nthis overpass.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. A rather slight curve to the right?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Very much. I still knew there was an overpass.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But your concentration was ahead?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Ahead.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Not to the side or to the rear?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No; not to the rear especially; that is true. Let me\r\nexplain a little more. When you are riding in this automobile, which\r\nis with him, and on your right side, naturally you are observing more\r\non the right. It is obvious. However, you still have time periodically\r\nto glance over to the left for viewing anything that might be of a\r\ndanger--whether it is people or any other object.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There is no way you would know from personal\r\nobservation in what direction the President was looking at the time he\r\nwas hit by the first shot?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right; I would not.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Could you outline for us here the process by which\r\nyou were put in charge of this particular operation?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Can you outline for us the procedure that is\r\nfollowed in such cases?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, indeed. As I said earlier, we have three\r\npeople, for a better word, in charge of the White House detail. Mr.\r\nBehn--Gerald Behn--is the special agent in charge. There are two\r\nassistants, Floyd Boring and myself. On all trips this was a divided\r\nmatter. And this one was my trip. Not that I picked it or anything.\r\nIt was my trip that Mr. Behn said, \"You will make this one with the\r\nPresident.\" The other two people would have other duties to do. And\r\nthis is how it fell on to me for that day, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Once this assignment is made by Mr. Behn, what\r\nhappens after that?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. In regard to who, sir?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. To your responsibilities.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The overall.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, from that assignment by Mr. Behn,\r\nyou take charge; you execute; you make assignments and so forth?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Only one thing. I am not going to say that I don't make\r\nassignments. Mr. Congressman, these people all work in a team form. We\r\nhave three shifts. They work together for a long time, and to say this,\r\nthat they knew each other's footprints, is probably an overstatement.\r\nBut they know each other's methods. Let me go back just one step\r\nfurther. I want to give it clear to you.\r\n\r\nLet's say the four or five stops that we had in Texas on this visit--we\r\nhad one overnight in Fort Worth. All right. Each time, each stop that\r\nwe make, the individual that we had sent out ahead to set up and\r\ncoordinate the program with the people in that area, whether it is\r\nsecurity or otherwise, through communications for the days he is away,\r\nhe keeps us abreast of what is going on, who to expect, and so forth.\r\n\r\nAnd, again, I should say that in the morning of the 22d in Fort Worth,\r\nthis lad called me--Mr. Lawson--asked about the top, whether it should\r\nremain on or off, which decision was reached from Mr. O'Donnell. I then\r\nasked him--I said, \"Are we going to be all right in Dallas?\" He said,\r\n\"Oh, yes; it is a good program.\" Fine. If and when we ever arrived at\r\nthat spot, I would ask this man, is there anything unusual when we get\r\nhere. That is a general question that I have given these people all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, once the assignment has been made\r\nthat you handle this trip, and in this case there was first a stop at\r\nEl Paso, then at Houston----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. San Antonio.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. San Antonio; then Houston, Fort Worth. You stayed\r\novernight at Fort Worth?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Then you proceeded to Dallas on the 22d?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Correct; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. As I understand it, when you arrived at San\r\nAntonio, the man that is in charge there, you immediately contacted.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, indeed.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you go to Houston, the same process?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Fort Worth, the same?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Fine.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And when you got to Dallas, when you arrived\r\nthere, whom did you see first?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Mr. Lawson.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And what did he tell you?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. He said, \"Your program is all set. We have all the\r\nequipment and there should be no problem here.\" Fine.\r\n\r\nLet me go back to Fort Worth again. On that night we had an overnight.\r\nThe gentleman we had working that stop had an added thing thrown into\r\nhim, which was the speech before breakfast. The President spoke to a\r\ncrowd across the main street in front of the hotel. After the President\r\nretired that night, he and I went down to that parking lot. I said,\r\nshow me where this man is going to be, where the platform is going to\r\nbe, where are you going to have all these folks, and how close are they\r\ngoing to be; show me. He did.\r\n\r\nYou have got to keep abreast of these things, Mr. Congressman. Well, it\r\nis your job.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Were all of these men that had charge of these\r\nvarious operations in San Antonio, Houston, Fort Worth, Dallas, men of\r\nexperience?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Very much; very much so. I want to give you a little\r\ninformation on how these people are selected for doing your advance\r\nwork out of Washington. In the first place, when they are brought in,\r\nyou instruct them on everything you do securitywise around the White\r\nHouse. You instruct them in rangework, followup car work, every little\r\nphase entailed. Then say you have a little movement in town--the\r\nPresident has a press conference, as an example. He doesn't do that.\r\nSend him with an older fellow. Even if he just walks around, learn it.\r\nTake him another place, a departure from an airport, or a theater. Give\r\nhim four or five. Then give him one, give him a little departure at\r\nan airport, or a hotel. But have somebody with him. Then there is no\r\nmistake made.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Now, when these men are assigned to handle the\r\nresponsibilities in a particular city, such as Lawson in Dallas, is\r\nLawson on the staff here or is he a man from Dallas with the Secret\r\nService?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. These are all people we have in the White House detail,\r\nsir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, Lawson was a White House detail\r\nman from Washington?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Right, sir. He is one of the men off those three shifts.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Now, when was your assignment made as the man in\r\ncharge of this particular operation?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Oh, I am going to say a week ahead, for lack of a better\r\ntime--in fact, I knew that much of it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. November----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Say the 17th, for a better day.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. On or before November 17th you got this assignment.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Surely. I knew that I was making a trip, and none of the\r\nother two gentlemen were.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What did you do after you got this\r\nassignment--what steps did you take?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. OK. The steps that I took--this entails work right\r\nhere in Washington. First, to determine, to staff people in the White\r\nHouse, who is all going to make it, who are the passengers. This is a\r\nthing that those advance people out in the field do not know when they\r\nleave. You set up the time schedule--flight time--because the people\r\non the other end want you there at 11:30 in the morning, you have to\r\nwork back a flight time from Washington, or the helicopter time from\r\nthe White House. All this is incorporated. Weatherwise--you will use an\r\nautomobile. Allow a little more time. All right.\r\n\r\nFrom the people that are out in the field on those 4 or 5 different\r\nspots, they are the ones that coordinate with the local folks what\r\nprogram they would like, which is forwarded back, conferred with staff\r\npeople, whether it is approved, disapproved, added, or cut out. And\r\nabout the day before you leave, then it is all gelled.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But this is your principal responsibility, to pull\r\neverything together.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Now, according to the various reports we have,\r\nwhen you know you are going to a particular city, or several cities,\r\nyou have a method or a procedure to check to see if there are any\r\nindividuals or organizations that present a serious threat to the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir. We have what we call a Protective Research\r\nSection. This has been in existence for many years, through Roosevelt's\r\ndays--I will go back that far. Through the combined efforts of various\r\nsources, through other agencies, they have a file on all the, let's\r\nsay dangerous, for a better word, people that could be suspected in\r\nthe city he arrives in. They will furnish the agents on those three\r\nshifts, if there are a number of them, or even one--it doesn't make any\r\ndifference--all the data possible on that person--it will be given to\r\neach shift. It is a report form; can be read by all. And, if possible,\r\nthere is a photograph included. That will be circulated around.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Now, when you got your assignment on or about\r\nNovember 17, what did you do in this regard?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. One little thing I should say. Well, I am sorry. One\r\nof the first things we do, when a trip is planned, is make a call on\r\nthat PRS Section and tell them, \"On November 21 we are going to be in\r\nSan Antonio, Houston, and Fort Worth. On the 22d we will be in Dallas,\r\nAustin, and at the ranch.\" And they take it from there, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So, on or about November 22d, you made this\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. This inquiry, sir, would be made a week ahead of time.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. A week ahead of the date that you were appointed?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That's right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Who would make that inquiry?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That would be made by any one of the three people--Mr.\r\nBehn, Mr. Boring, or myself, or one other person which I interrupted\r\nyou a second ago. A departure is given to one man from one of the\r\nshifts who would set up a departure from the White House to Andrews.\r\nHe, too, in turn notifies our Protective Research Section of this thing.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Well, do you know who in this case for this trip\r\nmade that inquiry of the Protective Research Section?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I don't have the name right now.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Would there be a record of that made?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I think we ought to have that for the record--the\r\ntime it was made. You don't recall making it yourself, however.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Do you know if it was actually done?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It is always done, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I know. But do you know if it was done in this case?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Not for a fact; no.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But you must assume it was done.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Very much so.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Were you given the information from this inquiry,\r\neven though you didn't make it yourself?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. What kind of information, sir?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Well, about those people who are considered\r\ndangerous or a problem in any one of these four or five cities where\r\nthe President was going on this trip.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I will have to check this, but there was no record.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No information.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, PRS never turned over to you\r\nany information about any dangerous individuals in any one of these\r\ncommunities on this trip.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That's right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is this unusual?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes. But let me reserve the right to recheck that\r\nquestion again; may I?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Absolutely. All we want in this case, as in any\r\nother, are whatever the facts are to the best of records that are\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. All right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In the report from the Secret Service it says,\r\nand I quote, \"Because of the incidents on the occasion of the visit of\r\nAmbassador Stevenson to Dallas earlier in the fall, special attention\r\nwas given to extremist groups known to be active in Dallas. Appendix A\r\ndescribes the action taken in Dallas in more detail.\" Were you familiar\r\nwith that part of the Secret Service activity prior to your departure\r\nfor Texas?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I have knowledge of that; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How much knowledge?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. But not enough to be written up, that I recall, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Well, could you describe for the Commission what\r\nknowledge you did have in this regard?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The only knowledge I can describe to you, sir, is the\r\nfact that we were aware of what this Ambassador went through down\r\nthere. However, we had no information that such an incident would\r\nhappen to President Kennedy on his trip into that State.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But I gather from this report, which is the\r\nofficial report of the Treasury Department, that somebody knew of these\r\nprevious incidents, and was thereby alerted to the possibility of--the\r\npotential of one, because the report says, \"Special attention is given\r\nto extremist groups known to be in Dallas.\" Now, could you tell us what\r\nspecial attention was given?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No. Outside of the fact that everybody was alerted to\r\nthis previous incident.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. PRS, Protective Research Section, didn't tell\r\nyou, as the person in charge, of any individuals or of any groups that\r\nwanted special attention? I am using \"special attention\" as in the\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Right as of this minute, the only knowledge that I have\r\nof any incident that could happen was in San Antonio, when I believe we\r\nhad information of some pickets. Now, those pickets showed up outside\r\nof--he made a speech at that space hospital. Well, anyway, in view of\r\nthat, I cannot reach the name right now--these pickets were out at,\r\nlet's say, the main gate to the grounds, and just stayed right there\r\nwith their placards.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Also on the report it says, \"In accordance with\r\nthe usual practice, the local FBI office informed the local Secret\r\nService office of any information which affected the President's visit.\"\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. They did. That is the normal practice.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That was the normal procedure?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It is always the normal procedure; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Now, whom would they have informed in this case in\r\nDallas?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Their report would have come to Washington, and relayed\r\nto our Protective Research Section.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And the FBI in this instance gave you what\r\ninformation, if any, that you should relay back to the people----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. The only thing I can recall right now, sir, are those\r\npickets in San Antonio.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Well, may I say if on your return to your office\r\nyou find any information on this particular point, I think it would be\r\nvery helpful for the record, and it should be included in the record.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. All right. I surely will.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The report also says, \"On October 30, 1963, the\r\nlocal FBI office gave the local Secret Service officer the name of a\r\nrightwing individual in the Dallas area. An investigation was made.\r\nOn November 21 and 22 the local FBI office referred two pieces of\r\ninformation to the local Dallas office of the Secret Service.\" Were you\r\nfamiliar with that?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Who would, under your normal procedures, have been\r\nfamiliar with that?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. It would be the same organization, Protective Research\r\nSection.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But they did not give you any information of this.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is this unusual or different?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. If they evaluated this information, there would have to\r\nbe a degree of seriousness.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But, as far as you can best recollect at this\r\npoint, you were never so informed.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, indeed.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The report does go on to say, and I quote, \"One\r\ninvolved scurrilous literature already in the hands of the Secret\r\nService, Exhibit 4. The second involved possible picket trouble which\r\nthe local police were aware of.\" That is the picket trouble you were\r\ntalking about?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Apparently so.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The report also says on page 8, \"Special Agent\r\nLawson, SAIC Sorrel, and Special Agent Howlett met with Dallas\r\nlaw-enforcement officials. Special Agent Howlett also met with an\r\ninformant. They followed up all leads and tips and checked scurrilous\r\nliterature, Exhibit 4.\" Did you have any information personally about\r\nthis activity by Lawson, Sorrel, and Howlett?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was it their responsibility to do it, to undertake\r\nthat kind of an operation?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Everybody but Lawson. These other two gentlemen you are\r\nspeaking of are field agents out of Dallas. Yes; they would investigate\r\nthe seriousness of this thing, through the information furnished by\r\nthe FBI. And, depending on the degree now, this would be furnished our\r\nProtective Research Section here in Washington.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Now, did Lawson or anybody else communicate to you\r\nwhat was going on in this regard?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, no. I do not think Mr. Lawson got in this\r\ninvestigative part at all. It would not be any part of his duties.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I am only reading from the report.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And the report goes on to say, \"Their\r\ninvestigations did not bring to light the name or the individual Lee H.\r\nOswald, and he or his name was not known to them or any other Secret\r\nService agent in Dallas or elsewhere prior to this shooting of the\r\nPresident.\" Would that be the same as far as you are concerned?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is very true.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You did not know of Lee H. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. None whatsoever.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was it surprising to you that when the President\r\nwas going to a city as large as Dallas, that there were no names turned\r\nover to you, either by your Protective Research Section or by any other\r\nFederal agents--individuals or an individual dangerous to the President?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I recall, to give you an answer, Congressman, that it\r\ndid seem strange that here we are hitting five cities in one State\r\nand--and from the apparent trouble Ambassador Stevenson had down there\r\none evening, we certainly should have had some information on somebody.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Hypothetically, if you go to other large\r\nmetropolitan areas, do you normally get names from various agencies,\r\nincluding PRS, warning you of an individual or groups that might cause\r\ntrouble?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Again I say that our PRS would recheck their files,\r\nfrom all the cities--from all the cases that they have in that city,\r\nand furnished us information, whether a report or photographwise.\r\nThey in turn would--and I believe I am correct on this--they in turn\r\nnotify the Bureau of this visit, or may have people check through their\r\nfiles. They can doublecheck this stuff. I don't recall any information\r\nwhatsoever, except that picket thing.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It is surprising to me, as well, and I gather it\r\nwas certainly, on reflection, surprising to you----\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was this in itself any warning to you that there\r\nmight be some breakdown in the system?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Gee--no; I never cherished that thought, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You assumed that the proper liaison between\r\nvarious agencies was taking place, and your PRS was operating\r\neffectively?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Oh, yes; very much; yes indeed. Now, if I am wrong, when\r\nI check these two questions back here, I will let you know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Congressman Ford, on this line, perhaps I should say that\r\norganizationally we are divided into phases where this is a separate\r\nphase in terms of protective devices. So, for the prepared part of what\r\nthe staff has set up, we have by design omitted that portion here, with\r\nlater witnesses to go into all these questions in some detail for the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I was trying to get from Mr. Kellerman--from his\r\ntestimony he was indicating that he was the person who from on or about\r\nNovember 17 had the responsibility. And I was trying to trace precisely\r\nhow this responsibility was carried through, up to the point where you\r\nstarted out this morning. Do I understand, then, that at some later\r\npoint in the Commission hearings with other witnesses we will go back\r\ninto the process of how these decisions are made, as far as PRS is\r\nconcerned?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir. There will be detailed witnesses on the workings\r\nof PRS, and how they functioned with respect to this trip, and what\r\ninformation the FBI had or the State Department had about Lee Harvey\r\nOswald, and whatever coordination, if any, was present. Our thought was\r\nthat that would be handled separately, organizationally. Certainly, to\r\nsome extent it is impossible to draw sharp lines of distinction here.\r\nBut that is the way the staff has prepared the distinctions--with Mr.\r\nKellerman going more specifically, as the other witnesses of today, on\r\nthe sequence of events themselves at the assassination.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But, as far as the procedures within PRS and the\r\nrelationship between the Secret Service, the FBI, and other Federal\r\nagencies, that will come up later on in other witnesses who are more\r\nfamiliar with the precise workings.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Exactly; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Who actually had the responsibility to check the\r\nroute from the airport to the Trade Mart? I mean to check the route,\r\nlay out whatever security precautions should be taken from the outset\r\nuntil the day of the President's visit?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That was coordinated, Mr. Congressman, between Mr.\r\nLawson and members of the Dallas Police Department, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You did not arrive in Dallas until the morning of\r\nthe assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir; that is correct, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. As you were in the car, in the right front seat,\r\nand the car turned from Main Street right into Houston, you had for a\r\nrelatively short period of time an opportunity to look at the Texas\r\nSchool Depository Building. Did you look at it; did you notice anything\r\nabout it? What was your reaction, if any, to that particular building?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Not knowing the name of the building--let me say this:\r\nWhen you are driving down this street, regardless of Houston or which,\r\nand you have buildings on either side of you, you are going to scan\r\nyour eyes up and down this building.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did this building create, as you turned into\r\nHouston Street, any particular problem that would have alerted you one\r\nway or another?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. None whatsoever. It did not produce a thing.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Your eyes scanned the area. Did they scan\r\nsufficiently to identify anything, to be alerted by anything in any\r\nwindow, on the roof, or anyplace else?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Mr. Lawson or anybody else indicate to you at\r\nany time that the Book Depository Building was a problem?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I mean beforehand.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Never mentioned it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Mr. Lawson or anybody else discuss with you\r\nany particular danger involved in the overpass, the triple overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you have minute knowledge as to the route in\r\nDallas, or was that left up to Lawson in his judgment?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Left up to Lawson and the people in Texas.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But he did tell you when you arrived in Dallas;\r\nwhat, again?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. And the people in Texas, the police department.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What did he tell you? When you arrived in Dallas\r\nthat morning, he told you something.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir. He said, \"This is your reception committee,\r\nwhich is at the bottom of the ramp leading out.\" I said, \"Are we all\r\nright in Dallas here all the way for today?\" And he said, \"Yes; this\r\nwill be fine.\" I said, \"All right; let's get on with it.\"\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When were you first interviewed by anyone\r\nregarding the directions from which the shots came?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I don't recall ever being interviewed.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you ever make a statement for submission to\r\nthe Commission or to your supervisors?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Just this statement that I submitted here.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Which is included in the Secret Service report.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you have anything to do with setting up the\r\nmethod of trying to apprehend the alleged assassin? Was that outside or\r\nwithin your jurisdiction?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Outside, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You did nothing in that regard.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Nothing.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I believe that is all. I have to go back to a very\r\nimportant committee meeting, Mr. Chairman. I may be able to get back\r\nlater, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I will be here the rest of the afternoon, so there will\r\nbe no necessity of your coming back if you are tied up. Thank you very\r\nmuch for presiding all day.\r\n\r\nMr. Specter, have you some more questioning?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I have just one or two other questions.\r\n\r\nMr. Kellerman, you referred to a single statement which you said you\r\nhad made. In the report of the U.S. Secret Service on the assassination\r\nof President Kennedy, on Exhibit 12, statement 11--we have the first\r\nstatement which you made, which is four pages, and that is the one to\r\nwhich you referred, to refresh your recollection earlier today, and I\r\nshow you what appears to be a second very brief report which you made 1\r\nday later under date of November 30, 1963, with your name and initials,\r\nand ask you if you made this one, also.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is right; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. You referred to you and Mr. Boring being the\r\ntwo assistant special agents in charge. Is that status the same at the\r\npresent time, or are there now three assistant special agents in charge?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. There are three. Mr. Rufus Youngblood is the third one.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Has that slight shift been made since the time of the\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, those are my only additional questions,\r\nsir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Craig, would you like to ask any questions, or do you\r\nthink of any other avenue that we should explore here?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No, sir; thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. As the interrogation\r\nhas progressed, I have been handing notes to counsel and he has been\r\nvery kind in asking those questions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Murray, can you think of anything?\r\n\r\nMr. MURRAY. No, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nMr. SMITH. Off the record.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Mr. Kellerman, is there any special agent in charge of the\r\nprotection of the person next in line in succession, to your knowledge?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. I think Mr. Rowley would like to man that. I think they\r\nhave had a little difficulty to find a man.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. There is no such person now?\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. No, they have made numerous attempts with the people,\r\nand so far they have got a negative reply.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, Mr. Kellerman, thank you very much, sir, for your\r\nattendance and for your testimony.\r\n\r\nMr. KELLERMAN. Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Now, Mr. Specter.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. We will call Mr. Greer.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Greer, how do you, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. Greer, will you raise your right hand and be sworn.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing\r\nbut the truth before this Commission, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Would you be seated, please.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF WILLIAM ROBERT GREER, SPECIAL AGENT, SECRET SERVICE\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name for the record, please.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. William Robert Greer.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. By whom are you employed, Mr. Greer?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. The Treasury Department, Secret Service Division of the\r\nTreasury Department.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How old are you at the present time?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Fifty-four years old.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long have you been with the Secret Service Department?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I have been with the Secret Service Department since October\r\n1, 1945.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your educational background?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I have just education in public schools in Ireland, really.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And----\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I took courses here in this country.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you a high school graduate, then?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Well, I have 2 years of high school.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when did you complete this educational background?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I have to go back now.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. About 1924 or 1925.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you outline in a general way what your activities\r\nhave been since that time, up until your joining the Secret Service,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir. I was born and raised on farmwork, a farmer. And\r\nI done that until I came to this country in February 1930. I worked\r\nfor a period of time--I lived in Boston for a little while. I worked\r\none summer on the estate of Henry Cabot Lodge. I was a chauffeur for a\r\nfamily in Brookline, Mass., for about a year. And then I went to New\r\nYork, Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. I lived there for 13 years as a chauffeur for a\r\nprivate family in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. Then I went in the Navy in November\r\n1942. I got discharged on September 18, 1945.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were your principal duties while in the Navy?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I was seaman first class. I did almost 2 years at\r\nBainbridge, Md., with the seaman guard there. And then I was assigned\r\nto the presidential yacht in May 1944, until I was discharged in\r\nSeptember. But most of my duty was at the White House in that period,\r\nthat year.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how long after discharge from the Navy was it before\r\nyou joined the U.S. Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Well, I got out of the Navy September 18 and October 1 I\r\nwent with the Secret Service--a matter of 14 or 15 days.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Describe your duties since joining the Secret Service,\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Since joining the Secret Service I was assigned to the\r\nuniform force at first with the Secret Service at the Bureau of\r\nEngraving and Printing. For about 2 years I was with the physical\r\neducation part of it. We had a gymnasium there. I was an instructor\r\nthere part-time--part of the time. And then I was assigned for about 2\r\nyears to pick up the food of the President at the White House. I had\r\nthat duty for about 2 years. And then I went back to the Treasury for\r\na short period, a few months. And then I was reassigned to the White\r\nHouse as an agent in November--1950 I went, there. I was made a full\r\nagent that following August 1951. I was there as a special officer from\r\nNovember to August 1951.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have you been assigned to the White House staff since\r\nthat time?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; I have been there ever since.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And while assigned at the White House staff, how much of\r\nyour duty has involved driving the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Well, I drove the followup car for quite a long time--you\r\nknow, off and on. And then I drove the President at intervals\r\nduring President Truman's and President Eisenhower's terms. I was\r\nalso assigned a great many times to Mrs. Eisenhower. When she left\r\nWashington, I was always assigned to her, to travel with her. And I\r\nhave been assigned to the President, to drive the President, since\r\nelection day, with President Kennedy. I was the senior agent assigned\r\nto him, to drive him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How did you get to Dallas yourself back on November 22,\r\n1963?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I flew--I was on a plane with the President all during the\r\ntrip. And I flew from Fort Worth to Dallas that morning.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Greer, I hand you documents which have been marked\r\nCommission Exhibits 344, 345, and 346. I ask you if you can identify\r\nthose, starting with 344, what that depicts.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; I can identify this automobile very well. That is\r\nthe 1961 Lincoln, especially built for the President. And this is a\r\nrear view of that same automobile. This is the interior of that Lincoln\r\nContinental. Yes, sir, everything is very positive that I can identify.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How did that automobile--how was that automobile\r\ntransported to Texas?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. It was flown there in a C-130.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do you know where it was flown to?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Well, it was flown--let's see, I forget the day before where\r\nour first stop was on that trip right now. I would have to go back into\r\nmy papers. But we used I believe more than one stop. I am trying to\r\nthink where we used it before we went to Dallas. It could have been at\r\nHouston. I am not too sure whether we used it at Houston the day before\r\nor not. I would have to go back in my records.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is it possible the first time you used the automobile on\r\nthat Texas trip was at Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Right now it is so long ago, I have almost forgotten whether\r\nwe did use it at Houston prior to that or not. I am not too sure where\r\nthe first stop was. We sometimes use it more than one stop.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there any covering which can be put on the President's\r\nautomobile?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. There is--when we put the plastic--I put the plastic on it,\r\nwe have a black canvass-type cover that buttons over the top of the\r\nplastic.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you please describe in a general way the plastic\r\ncovering you just referred to.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. The plastic covering is made in six pieces. Three of\r\nthem--there are two corner pieces and a centerpiece on the back that\r\nwe fasten together before we set it up onto the car. Then there is a\r\nfront--one piece that goes across the front seat after that. Then the\r\nlast pieces we put on are two that go in the center, and they meet\r\ntogether in the center--they come together in the center. That makes\r\nthe six pieces that it comes down in. We have to break it down in the\r\nsix pieces to store it in the trunk. It is kept in the trunk of the car\r\nwhenever we are not using it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are the three pieces that you described as being joined\r\ntogether for the rear portion disassembled at all times?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. We disassemble them to store them in the trunk, yes, sir.\r\nBut we put them together on the floor, on the ground or something like\r\nthat--we put the three pieces together, then we lift it up and set it\r\nin place, which covers the back seat of the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And after you put the three pieces together for the back\r\nportion of the car, how many additional pieces are there for the\r\nbalance of the car?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Three; three more pieces.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how are they secured to the automobile itself?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. They are secured with--I don't know what you would call\r\nit--these fasteners, snaps, kind of snaps that snap on them. We have\r\nthem made that way so that we can install them or take them apart very\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, is this cover transparent? Can it be seen through?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. The plastic; yes. You can see through it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is the plastic made of, if you know?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Well, it is a type of plastic. I just don't know who\r\nmanufactures it. But it is clear plastic.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is it bulletproof or bullet resistant?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir. It is weather--the idea back of it was for\r\ninclement weather, that the President could be seen if the weather was\r\ntoo bad to have him outside. That is what we had in mind originally\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have any personal knowledge of any efforts made to\r\nobtain a bulletproof or bullet-resistant transparent top?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Now, or before that?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, start beforehand.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No; I never had anything to do with that at all. I never had\r\nanything to do with anything being made for that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know what efforts have been made subsequent to\r\nthe assassination of President Kennedy to obtain such a bulletproof\r\ntransparent top?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Only just hearing conversation; nothing definite; no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately what time, to the best of your recollection,\r\ndid President Kennedy arrive in Dallas on November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I would have to--I would not tell you right now. I would\r\nhave to go back and look into my--you probably have it there. I have it\r\nalso on my report.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. If you don't recall the exact time, just give us your best\r\nestimate.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Approximately 11:35. I am guessing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was his mode of transportation into Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. He flew on an Air Force plane.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where did he fly from?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. From Fort Worth to Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you tell us in a general way what he did upon arrival\r\nin Dallas at Love Field?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir. He got off the plane. He walked along the fence\r\nalong there, and shook hands with a great many people. There was a\r\nlarge crowd there. He and Mrs. Kennedy both walked along and shook\r\nhands with many people.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, approximately how long after arrival at Love Field\r\ndid he get into his automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I would guess probably, say, approximately maybe 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were the weather conditions like that day as he got\r\ninto his automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. The weather was very nice that day. It was a beautiful day\r\nin Dallas, very fine day, warm, fairly warm, nice day.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the car open?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. The car was open; no top.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately how many automobiles were there in that\r\nmotorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I wouldn't have--couldn't tell you right now how many. There\r\nwas quite a few cars.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who were the occupants of the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. On the back seat, on the right rear seat, the President,\r\nMrs. Kennedy on the left rear seat, Governor Connally was on the right\r\njump seat, and Mrs. Connally was on the left jump seat. Mr. Kellerman\r\nwas riding on the right front, and I was driving.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At what speed did you travel as you proceeded at various\r\npoints from Love Field, say, down into the downtown area of Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Well, we traveled at various speeds, according to the amount\r\nof people, the crowd. If it was--if we came to a large crowd, we would\r\nhave to slow down. I would say, to probably 10 to 15 miles an hour.\r\nThen we would pick it up possibly 25 or somewhere around--25 maybe to\r\n30, where there was few people.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the maximum speed at which you drove from the\r\ntime you left Love Field until the time you got to downtown Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I wouldn't have the slightest idea now, after this length of\r\ntime. I could not say how much it would be.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you give us your best estimate on the minimum speed\r\nfrom the time you left Love Field until the time you arrived at\r\ndowntown Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. The minimum speed traveling at all would probably be 10 to\r\n15 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what sort of crowds were along the way?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. There was large crowds--at some places there was quite large\r\ncrowds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did anything unusual occur en route from Love Field to the\r\ndowntown area of Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Well, I think--it may have been--we may have stopped one\r\ntime where he got out--didn't get out, but he stopped and spoke to some\r\nyoung people, I believe, en route. I think there may have been a group\r\nof people there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I hand you a photograph which has already been marked\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 347 and ask you if at this time you are able to\r\nidentify what that photograph depicts.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir. That is the photograph of the route that we\r\ntraveled in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I show you a photograph marked Commission Exhibit No. 348\r\nand ask you if you can identify what that picture represents.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. With pictures that I have seen since then, I would recognize\r\nthat as the Book Depository Building in Dallas--the street in front of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you familiar with the name of this street, which has\r\nsince been marked by Mr. Kellerman, who identified this exhibit and\r\nmarked the name of the street on it?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, I wasn't at the time, but I know now that it is supposed\r\nto be Main Street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do you know in what general direction Main Street\r\nproceeds?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I am not too sure. No; I wouldn't really know. I didn't have\r\nenough time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are you familiar with the street which intersects with\r\nMain----\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Houston Street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what street did you turn off of from Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Houston to Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, as you were proceeding down Main Street, which I will\r\nadd is in a generally westerly direction, what is your best estimate of\r\nyour speed as you turned the corner right onto Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I would estimate the speed was somewhere between 12 to 15\r\nmiles per hour, coming through there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And as you made that right-hand turn onto Houston Street,\r\nwhat was the composition of the crowds along the way, if any?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. On Main Street there were very, very large crowds. They were\r\nalmost close up against the automobile. Sometimes the motorcycles on\r\nthe sides could not even get through. They were real close to us. And\r\nvery large crowds. And when we got around on Houston Street, the crowds\r\nthinned out quite a lot. My recollection here is that there wasn't too\r\nmany people on Elm Street--a few scattered people at that point.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And your finger indicated there the position near the\r\nTexas School Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, you have described motorcycles. How many were present\r\nwith the President's automobile, if any?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I could not tell the exact amount of motorcycles that were\r\nescorting us at that time. We usually do have them on the two front\r\nfenders and two rear fenders, and some probably preceding that, and\r\nsome along the motorcade behind us. I could not tell you exactly how\r\nmany there probably would be.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recollect that there were some on this occasion,\r\nhowever?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; there were motorcycles.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, do you know how many cars back your car was in the\r\nmotorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No; I don't know how many police cars were ahead of us. I\r\nknew that the lead car was right directly ahead of me, with one of our\r\nagents, or maybe two, and the chief of police in that car. But how many\r\npolice cars prior to that, I do not know how many there were at the\r\ntime in front of us.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How far ahead of you was that police car as you turned off\r\nof Main Street onto Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I usually allow 4 or 5 car lengths, if possible, between the\r\ncar and myself, in case that there is any reason to speed up quick. I\r\nlike to leave enough room that I can get out of there. I don't like to\r\nget too tight to the lead car when possible--unless the crowds are so\r\nbig that I have to get in or they would close in on me--I have to get\r\nin closer.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know how far behind you the first car immediately\r\nbehind yours was?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. The car behind me was only some few feet, because with our\r\ntraining and all, we stay very, very close to the President's car.\r\nSometimes we are bumper to bumper. And the car never is much more than\r\n10 to 12 feet away from the President's car, at slow speeds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you endeavor to maintain a constant speed in the\r\noperation of the President's car so as to avoid contact with this\r\nclose gap between the President's car and the President's follow-up\r\nautomobile?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir. We tried to drive at a very steady speed. We are\r\nused to driving with each other, and we almost can tell each other's\r\nthoughts what we do, because of the training we have had, and we work\r\nso long together. We drive at a steady pace of speed, so that we give\r\neach other enough ample time to stop or move in close.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. After turning off Main onto Houston, did you have any\r\nopportunity to take a look at the building which you have since\r\nidentified as the Texas School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir. I had not any chance to look much at that building\r\nat all. When I made the turn into Elm Street, I was watching the\r\noverpass expressway--the overpass, or what was ahead of me. I always\r\nlook at any--where I go underneath anything, I always watch above, so\r\nif there is anyone up there that I can move so that I won't go over the\r\ntop of anyone, if they are unidentified to me, unless it is a policeman\r\nor something like that. We try to avoid going under them.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, when you turned off of Houston onto Elm, did you make\r\na right-hand or a left-hand turn?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I made a right-hand turn off of Main onto Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when you turned from Houston onto Elm, was that a\r\nright-hand or a left-hand turn?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. That was a left-hand turn.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And as you turned onto Elm Street, how far, to the best of\r\nyour ability to estimate, was your automobile from the overpass which\r\nyou have just described?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I wouldn't have a distance recollection at all on how far it\r\nwas. It wasn't too far. I just could not give you the distance.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At that time, did you make a conscious effort to observe\r\nwhat was present, if anything, on that overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir. I was making sure that I could not see anyone that\r\nmight be standing there, and I didn't see anything that I was afraid of\r\non the overpass.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see anything at all on the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Not that I can now remember.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best recollection of the speed at which you\r\nwere traveling as you turned left off of Houston onto Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. My best recollection would be between 12 and 15 miles per\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how far were you at that time behind the police car\r\nwhich was in front of you?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Probably 50 feet maybe--approximately. I will say\r\napproximately 50 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As you turned onto Elm, did you have any opportunity to\r\nobserve how far behind you the President's follow-up car was?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir. I was not looking in my mirror; I could not say how\r\nfar it was behind me at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was the nature of the crowd as you made the turn\r\nonto Elm Street, if you recall?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. To the best of my memory, the crowd had thinned out a great\r\ndeal, and there was not too many people in front of that building.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many lanes of travel were there on Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. It was either three or four lanes wide. I have forgotten.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In what portion of the street were you traveling?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I was right in the center of the street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe for us the contour of the street at\r\nthat point--whether it was level, hilly, or what.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. It was starting to go down--gradually going down toward this\r\nunderpass. It was a down grade.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, would you tell us just what occurred as you were\r\nproceeding down Elm Street at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Well, when we were going down Elm Street, I heard a noise\r\nthat I thought was a backfire of one of the motorcycle policemen. And\r\nI didn't--it did not affect me like anything else. I just thought that\r\nit is what it was. We had had so many motorcycles around us. So I heard\r\nthis noise. And I thought that is what it was. And then I heard it\r\nagain. And I glanced over my shoulder. And I saw Governor Connally like\r\nhe was starting to fall. Then I realized there was something wrong. I\r\ntramped on the accelerator, and at the same time Mr. Kellerman said to\r\nme, \"Get out of here fast.\" And I cannot remember even the other shots\r\nor noises that was. I cannot quite remember any more. I did not see\r\nanything happen behind me any more, because I was occupied with getting\r\naway.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, how many shots, or how many noises have you just\r\ndescribed that you heard?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I know there was three that I heard--three. But I cannot\r\nremember any more than probably three. I know there was three anyway\r\nthat I heard.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have an independent recollection at this moment of\r\nhaving heard three shots at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I knew that after I heard the second one, that is when I\r\nlooked over my shoulder, and I was conscious that there was something\r\nwrong, because that is when I saw Governor Connally. And when I turned\r\naround again, to the best of my recollection there was another one,\r\nright immediately after.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. To the best of your ability to recollect and estimate,\r\nhow much time elapsed from the first noise which you have described as\r\nbeing similar to the backfire of a motor vehicle until you heard the\r\nsecond noise?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. It seems a matter of seconds, I really couldn't say. Three\r\nor four seconds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How much time elapsed, to the best of your ability to\r\nestimate and recollect, between the time of the second noise and the\r\ntime of the third noise?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. The last two seemed to be just simultaneously, one behind\r\nthe other, but I don't recollect just how much, how many seconds were\r\nbetween the two. I couldn't really say.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Describe as best you can the types of sound of the second\r\nreport, as distinguished from the first noise which you said was\r\nsimilar to a motorcycle backfire?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. The second one didn't sound any different much than the\r\nfirst one but I kind of got, by turning around, I don't know whether\r\nI got a little concussion of it, maybe when it hit something or not,\r\nI may have gotten a little concussion that made me think there was\r\nsomething different to it. But so far as the noise is concerned, I\r\nhaven't got any memory of any difference in them at all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Describe as best you can the sound of the third noise.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Just, to me it was similar, to the first two. They all\r\nsounded practically the same to me.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You testified that at the second noise you glanced over\r\nyour shoulder.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which shoulder did you glance over?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Right shoulder.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And describe or indicate how far you turned your head to\r\nthe right at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Just so that my eyes over, caught the Governor, I could see,\r\nI couldn't see the President. I just could see the Governor. I made a\r\nquick glance and back again.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the movement of your head just then approximately the\r\nsame?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As the time?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You just indicated the turn of your head slightly to the\r\nright.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. My eyes slightly more than my head. My eyes went more than\r\nmy head around. I had vision real quick of it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Exactly where was Governor Connally when you first caught\r\nhim out of the corner of your eye?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. He was--he seemed to be falling a little bit toward Mrs.\r\nConnally, to the left. He started to go over a little bit to the left.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how far did you catch his movement during the time you\r\nwere able to observe him?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Just a second. He probably hadn't gotten his shoulder, he\r\nhadn't fell down or anything. He probably was in a position such as I\r\nam now.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he fall to the rear or to the side or how?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. In my opinion, he fell toward Mrs. Connally which would be\r\nto his left or to his side.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he fall then on his left shoulder and arm or in some\r\nother way?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. He appeared to me to be falling on his left shoulder when I\r\nglanced. He had only started to move that way whenever he--when I saw\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to see anything of President Kennedy as you\r\nglanced to the rear?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I didn't see anything of the President. I didn't\r\nlook, I wasn't far enough around to see the President.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you started that glance, are you able to recollect\r\nwhether you started to glance before, exactly simultaneously with or\r\nafter that second shot?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. It was almost simultaneously that he had--something had hit,\r\nyou know, when I had seen him. It seemed like in the same second almost\r\nthat something had hit, you know, whenever I turned around. I saw him\r\nstart to fall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you step on the accelerator before, simultaneously or\r\nafter Mr. Kellerman instructed you to accelerate?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. It was about simultaneously.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that it was your reaction to accelerate prior to the\r\ntime----\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You had gotten that instruction?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; it was my reaction that caused me to accelerate.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recollect whether you accelerated before or at the\r\nsame time or after the third shot?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I couldn't really say. Just as soon as I turned my head back\r\nfrom the second shot, right away I accelerated right then. It was a\r\nmatter of my reflexes to the accelerator.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was it at about that time that you heard the third shot?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; just as soon as I turned my head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate of the speed of the car at the\r\ntime of the first, second, or third shots?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I would estimate my speed was between 12 and 15 miles per\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At the time all of the shots occurred?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. At the time the shots occurred.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now what, if anything, was Mr. Kellerman doing at the time\r\nof the first shot?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I couldn't really speak for where he was watching, what part\r\nof the street or the buildings or what he was watching at that time. I\r\ndon't really know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know what Mr. Kellerman was doing at the time of\r\nthe second shot?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. He was sitting there in the front. No, sir; I don't know\r\nwhat his action was then. I was watching the overpass, I wasn't looking\r\nhis way.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you were watching the overpass at that time, did you\r\nobserve anything on the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Not that I can remember now.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe that there was no one present on the\r\noverpass?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. My recollection, there may have been a police officer up\r\nthere. It is vague to me now everything that I had seen at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know what Mr. Kellerman was doing at the time of\r\nthe third shot?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I couldn't say what he was doing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any radio communication between your automobile\r\nand any of the other automobiles?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who made that radio communication?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Kellerman.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Tell us as precisely as you can when he made that radio\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. After he had said to me, \"Get out of here fast.\" He got the\r\nradio and called to the lead car, \"Get us to a hospital fast, nearest\r\nhospital fast.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recall whether he said anything else at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. After he had said to me, he said, \"12:30,\" and that is all I\r\nremember him saying to me was 12:30, and he had communications with the\r\ncars but I don't remember what he had said to them.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he say just \"12:30,\" or was it 12:30 used in a\r\nsentence?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. He said \"12:30.\" He looked at his watch, he said \"12:30,\"\r\nand we were in the underpass at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Greer, would you on Commission's Exhibit 347, mark\r\nwith an \"A\" as best you can indicate the position of the President's\r\nautomobile at the time of the first shot?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Do you want me to mark it on this exhibit?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Right there, that is right, that red pencil with an \"A,\" a\r\nsmall \"A.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. This is the center, I would say [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you mark your best estimate as to the position of the\r\nautomobile at the time of the second shot with the letter \"B\"?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I would have to guess how far I had traveled at that time. I\r\nreally wouldn't know. It was probably a little farther, only guessing\r\nhow far I would go. I am guessing as to the distance between them.\r\nMaybe farther but I am only guessing to say at that. I wouldn't have\r\nany definite reason.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you make that \"B\" a little plainer, if you can?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you give us the best estimate in feet as to the\r\ndistance you traveled from the time of the first shot to the time of\r\nthe second shot?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I don't believe I could. Anything I would say would\r\nbe guessing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you be able to give us a meaningful mark on the\r\noverhead photograph as to the position of your car at the time of the\r\nthird shot?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. From this overhead. I probably was where this mark is here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you mark it?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I will put it alongside.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Put a little \"C.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. This was for the third shot.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. This is \"C.\" This not having an idea really of how much\r\nfootage is in there at all. I wouldn't----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I didn't understand.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I said I wouldn't probably know, Mr. Chief Justice, how many\r\nfeet would be in that distance, I would be guessing how many feet.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; I understand.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any opportunity to observe the overhead as\r\nyou were driving along after the last shot occurred?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir. I was fairly close to it, to the best of my memory,\r\nand I was trying to watch then where I was going. I had to look ahead\r\nto see, I was catching up on the lead car real fast, and I had to watch\r\nwhat was ahead of me.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How fast was it possible to accelerate your automobile at\r\nthat time?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Well, it is a very heavy automobile, and it does not pick up\r\ntoo fast on account of the weight. I have never tested to see how many\r\nfeet I could travel in a second. I have never had any reason to test it\r\nto see how much I could travel. But it was in low gear at that time,\r\nand that helps you to accelerate a lot faster.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you characterize it as a very rapid or a rapid\r\nacceleration?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Or how would you characterize it?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. It is a very smooth car taking off anyway, and I would say\r\nit wasn't rapid. It is fairly fast in low gear but not rapid like a\r\nlight car will be.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does that car have an automatic transmission?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what are the varieties of forward speeds in the\r\nvehicle?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. It has a low gear and then it has drive one and drive two.\r\nIt has two top gears. One has, one probably has, free wheeling more\r\nthan the other. The other is not a free wheeling gear.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How fast can the car be driven in the low gear?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I would say safely you can drive it up to 40 miles an hour\r\nin low gear. That is estimating it at 40.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. From the time of the first shot until the time of the\r\nthird shot, was your car moving in a straight line or in an arc or how\r\nwould you describe it?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I was following the contour of the road, the center of the\r\ncontour of the road as it goes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the path of the contour of the road?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Well, at the time I didn't think much of it but it is a\r\nlittle, there is a little bend in the road going to the underpass.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you hear anyone in the car say anything from the time\r\nof the first shot until the time of the third shot?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Not to the best of my recollection, I don't remember.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Boggs entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Greer, did you hear anyone say anything from the time\r\nof the third shot until the time of arrival at Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I didn't. I didn't hear, I can't remember hearing\r\nanyone say anything at all. We were quite preoccupied to get to the\r\nhospital as fast as we can, as we could, and that was my mind was\r\nreally occupied on what I was doing. I didn't hear anything.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know what speed you were traveling at en route to\r\nthe hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I couldn't say. I was just getting through the\r\ntraffic and through the streets as fast as I could get through.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you have any estimate at all on speed?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I would estimate that I must have been doing 40 or 50, at\r\nleast 50 miles an hour at times. We might have been going as fast as 50\r\nmiles an hour, I am sure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you accelerated your automobile, did you at any time\r\ncome alongside of or pass the police car in front of you?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I never passed it. I came up alongside one or two\r\nmotorcycle men and I called to them \"get to a hospital fast\". You know,\r\nI called to them \"hospital\".\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you led to the hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; I was led to the hospital by the police car who\r\nwas preceding me.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any independent knowledge of the route from\r\nwhere you were?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. From the point of assassination to the hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you escorted by any other automobiles besides the\r\npolice car in front of you?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. We had motorcycles and I don't know if there were other\r\npolice cars out in front of that or not. I am sure there may have been,\r\nbut I couldn't say right now.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any radio communication between your automobile\r\nand the hospital at any time prior to your arrival at the hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; not between the hospital and our car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Mr. Kellerman have any radio contact at all with\r\nanyone in addition to that which you have already described?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. He may have had some more communications to the car, the\r\nlead car, but I can't remember what they were now.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any bullets strike any portion of the car\r\nor ricochet in any way during the course of the shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any bullets or fragments of bullets at\r\nrest in the car after the shooting terminated?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I didn't. I left the car at the hospital and I\r\ndidn't see it any more until the next day.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I hand you Commission Exhibit No. 349, Mr. Greer, and ask\r\nif you are able to identify what that picture represents?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. That represents the windshield of the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Of the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; it looks like the windshield of the President's\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now calling your attention to a small arrow----\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Arrow.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which points up on what appears to be an indentation, I\r\nask you if you--when was the first time, if at all, that you observed\r\nthat indentation?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I didn't observe that----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On the car?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Until after I got back to Washington, until the car came\r\nback to Washington. I saw it at the White House garage. It was the\r\nfirst time I had ever noticed that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On what date did you observe that indentation on the car?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. That was the day after, the 23, would be it. It would be the\r\nday after the shooting. We got back from Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what time of the day did you observe the car at the\r\nWhite House garage on that date?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. It was in the afternoon, I believe. I believe it was in the\r\nafternoon, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did anyone call that indentation to your attention at that\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes; I was asked if I knew about it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was it who asked you?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I can't remember now who did say that, but I was shown that\r\nindentation at the same time I was the break in the glass. I was shown\r\nboth and asked if I had known but I can't remember who might have asked\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had you ever observed that indentation before the\r\nassassination occurred?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir. I had never noticed it before at any time. I had\r\nnever seen it before.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had you ever had any occasion to examine closely that\r\nmetallic area to ascertain whether or not there was such an indentation\r\nprior to the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Well, it seems to me I would have prior to that had it been\r\nthere because I do take care of the car sometimes, and it had never\r\nbeen--I had never noticed it at any previous time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I hand you Commission Exhibit 350 and ask you if you are\r\nable to state what that depicts?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. That depicts a break or a shatter in the windshield of it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does that picture accurately represent the status of the\r\nwindshield on the President's car at sometime?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; that windshield looks real familiar to me on the\r\nway it----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At what time, based on your observation, did the\r\nwindshield of the President's car look like that picture?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I had never seen that until the following day after it came\r\nback from Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But on November 23, did the President's car windshield\r\nlook like that?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; it looked like there was a break that had a\r\ndiamond, in the windshield whenever I was shown that at the garage, the\r\nWhite House garage.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the size and scope of the crack the same as that which\r\nis shown on that exhibit?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. That I wouldn't remember whether it was quite that large\r\nor not. I don't believe it was that big. It might not have been but I\r\nwouldn't say for sure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any crack on the windshield after the time\r\nof the shooting on November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I didn't see it at all. I didn't know anything\r\nabout it until I came back, until the car came back and I was shown\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any occasion on November 22, after the\r\nshooting, to observe closely the windshield?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir. The only time I was in the car was going to the\r\nhospital and I never--I didn't see the car any more. It was just from\r\nthe shooting until we got to Parkland that I was with the car. I left\r\nthe car there and never did see it until it was back at the White House\r\ngarage.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you able to state with certainty there was no crack in\r\nthat windshield prior to the shooting on November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; I am sure there was nothing wrong with that\r\nwindshield prior to that because I would have--it was almost in front\r\nof me and I examined the car. I looked it all over when I got there. I\r\nsaw it was clean and everything, the windshield. I didn't see this ever\r\nat any time previous.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Greer, I now call your attention to a windshield\r\nwhich has been marked as Commission Exhibit No. 351, and I will ask\r\nyou to take a look at it and identify it for us, if you can, calling\r\nyour attention first of all to the windshield itself. Are you able to\r\nstate----\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; this is the windshield that came out of the\r\nLincoln.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That you were operating on the day of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you describe what cracks, if any, which you see now on\r\nthat windshield were present?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. When I looked----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you observed the automobile windshield on November\r\n23, the next day?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. This little star, the star in here with the little star.\r\nThese cracks were not there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now by these cracks you are indicating----\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. These.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The long cracks which radiate off from the center?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. That is right. This was the only cracks that I could see was\r\nthis star-type fragment.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. There you are indicating what would be described as the\r\nprincipal point of contact which was present when you observed it on\r\nNovember 23?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Give me your best estimate on the diameter of the cracking\r\nof the windshield as it existed on November 23?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. To the best of my estimate it would be these little stars\r\nthat are here, the little shatters that are here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would it be fair to say that you are indicating a circle\r\nwith a circumference or diameter of approximately an inch to an inch\r\nand a half?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I don't think--it probably would be an inch. The whole\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately 1 inch as you estimate it?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Excuse me, did you say you did not notice this\r\ncrack from the time that you drove the car after the shooting to the\r\nhospital?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I had flags on the car and you know they were\r\nwaving at a high rate of speed and you have the Presidential flag and\r\nthe American flag in front of you there; you know when you are going\r\nat a fast speed you get a lot of, well, I don't know how you would say\r\nit, it attracts you so much that I didn't have any recollection of what\r\nhappened on the windshield.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. There was no glass or anything that spattered on\r\nyou in any way?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I didn't feel anything at all. I didn't feel a\r\nthing hit me. I was kind of shocked at the time, I guess anything\r\ncould have and I wouldn't have known what hit me. You are tense, I was\r\npretty tense, and naturally my thoughts were the hospital, and how fast\r\nI could get there, and probably I could have been injured and not even\r\nknown I was injured. I was in that position.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Greer, what is your best estimate and recollection of\r\nthe time that the shooting occurred?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Well, Mr. Kellerman saying 12:30 to me makes me--that stays\r\nin my mind foremost, and that was when we had just left the scene of\r\nthe shooting, a few seconds or a second or two from it. That is why\r\nthat 12:30 stays in my mind, him saying 12:30 to me right after the\r\nshooting, he said. His watch may not have been correct but that is what\r\nhe said to me at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate of the distance between the\r\npoint where the assassination occurred and Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I haven't. It seemed like endless miles and\r\nprobably wasn't very far, but it seemed like to me it was endless\r\ngetting there. I was----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you able to give us an estimate with reasonable\r\naccuracy on the time it took?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. From the time it took from the point of the shooting until\r\nyou arrived at Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I didn't check anything but I thought that probably it\r\nwould probably be 6 or 8 minutes. I am not too sure, somewhere in the\r\nvicinity of 5 and 10 minutes. I would have to guess at that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How did you know which entrance of the hospital to go to?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I followed the car that was in front of me right to where he\r\nstopped and I was right at the entrance. The car stopped and I stopped\r\nalongside of him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which entrance was that?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. It seems, I think it was the emergency entrance, I am almost\r\nsure. It was like a bay that you could pull in and out of. It looked\r\nlike an ambulance entrance.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe with respect to President Kennedy's\r\ncondition on arrival at the Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. To the best of my knowledge he was laying, it seemed across\r\nMrs. Kennedy, looked like laying across her lap or in front of her, I\r\nam not too sure which, I opened the doors--the doors were opened before\r\nI got to it, someone else had opened the doors and they were trying to\r\nget Connally out, and Mrs. Connally out of the seats so they could get\r\nto the President.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe about the President with respect to\r\nhis wounds?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. His head was all shot, this whole part was all a matter of\r\nblood like he had been hit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating the top and right rear side of the head?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; it looked like that was all blown off.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I run around the front of the car and got hold of a\r\nstretcher or thing and I got hold of it to keep it steady while they\r\nlifted the President's body onto it and then I helped pull the front\r\nend of it into the emergency room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was first removed from the automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Governor Connally was first removed. He was on the jump\r\nseats.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what, if anything, did you observe as to Governor\r\nConnally's condition on arrival at Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. The best of my recollection he was lying across the seat\r\ntoward Mrs. Connally when they picked him up and got him out of the\r\ncar. And he was rushed in first into the hospital. That is when I\r\ngot the stretcher to bring it, to hold it until they would get the\r\nPresident on it, on the right side of the car. They took him out on the\r\nside he was sitting on, that side of the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to make any personal observation about\r\nGovernor Connally's specific wound?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir. I didn't know how badly anyone really was injured.\r\nI had great thoughts the President was still living and that was the\r\nonly thing I was thinking about was to get them in quick.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe anything specific which led you to the\r\nconclusion that the President was still living?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir. When he was in the emergency room and I was there,\r\nI did see his chest expand and move, the movement of the chest a time\r\nor so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to observe any wound on the front side of\r\nthe President?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I didn't, I never seen any on the front side of the\r\nPresident. The only thing I saw was on the head. I didn't know at the\r\ntime of any other injuries on him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As to the front side of the President's body, were you\r\nable to observe any hole or tear in either his shirt or tie?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I didn't and I brought them back, those things,\r\nand I didn't see them at the time. I probably didn't inspect them very\r\nclosely but they were handed to me in a paper bag to bring back.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When did you acquire custody and possession of those items\r\nof clothing?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. After they had made the President's body ready for removal,\r\nI was in the emergency room, and a nurse got two shopping bags and I\r\nheld them and she put the President's suit, his belongings into the\r\ntwo bags including his shoes and socks, and his pants and jacket which\r\nthey had torn and the shirt they had torn, they had torn it to take it\r\noff him, and the nurse put these into the two bags and I got custody of\r\nthem right then from the nurse at the emergency room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there any other items of wearing apparel such as\r\nshorts or undershirt?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; his shorts and that brace he wore, whatever it\r\nwas, and his sox and shoes, and shirt, and his trousers, and his suit\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you able to state with certainty that there was no\r\nundershirt?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; there was no undershirt. I am sure there was no\r\nundershirt. I would have to say it to the best of my recollection,\r\nthere was no undershirt. I had been with him so many times and I knew\r\nhe didn't normally wear an undershirt because I had heard him one time\r\npreviously, I offered him a coat.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"I have an undershirt on today,\" it was at some ballgame. He\r\nnormally didn't wear an undershirt.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you describe with more particularity the brace you\r\njust said he was wearing?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. It looked like a, I would say, a corset-type brace, maybe 6\r\ninches wide, he wore it around his, down low around his, haunches, a\r\nlittle lower than the waist, probably, just probably below his belt he\r\nwore it there. It was something he normally wore, and I would guess,\r\nbut I would say it was of a soft, maybe a kind of corset-type material,\r\nmaybe elastic or something like that support.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Greer, when your automobile arrived at Parkland, was\r\nthere any medical individual awaiting your arrival?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I can't remember--there were--who brought the stretchers\r\nout. There were some hospital people there, but who they were, I never\r\ngot--I couldn't identify or knew who they were. There were some medical\r\npeople there; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where were they when you first saw hospital personnel?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. When I pulled into the ambulance entrance there were some\r\npeople there on the right-hand side with these stretchers that they had\r\nrushed out. I don't know just who they were from the hospital staff.\r\nThere was a great deal of confusion because everyone was trying to\r\nhelp, the agents were there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you able to state whether there was a doctor in\r\nattendance at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I couldn't state that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you do after your arrival at Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I helped pull it, take the stretcher into the emergency room\r\nthat he was on. It is on wheels, and I helped to take that in, and I\r\nstayed inside the door of the emergency room most of the time while\r\nthey were, the doctors were, working on the President's body.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many doctors were working on him in the emergency room?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. There were, between nurses and doctors. I would estimate\r\nthere were, between 10 or 12 people, maybe not that many, 8 to 10\r\npeople in and out of that room. I don't know how many of them were\r\ndoctors, attendants, nurses, and things like that with white jackets\r\nand they would come in and say, \"I am doctor so-and-so.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long were they working on him there in the emergency\r\nroom?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I couldn't remember the time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You say you were with him most of the time?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I was inside the door. I know, I kept the door closed most\r\nof the time, let doctors and nurses in and out while he was--while they\r\nwere working on him. I stayed inside the emergency room door.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any special reason for you to leave part of the\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I didn't go any farther away than outside the door.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there any other Secret Service agents inside the\r\nemergency room at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Not at that time; I was inside the door.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was Mrs. Kennedy at this time?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Mrs. Kennedy was outside the door. They got her a chair out\r\nthere for a little while and then she insisted on coming in and she got\r\nin the corner for a little while there and stayed there a little while\r\nand I don't quite remember the time she went over to his body but she\r\ndid go over there, and I don't remember how far along the doctors had\r\nbeen on him when that happened.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to overhear any of the conversations among\r\nthe doctors in the emergency room?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I don't understand anything that they were discussing at all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did a priest or more than one priest come upon the scene?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I believe there were two. To the best of my recollection\r\nthere eventually was two.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long after President Kennedy arrived at the emergency\r\nroom did the priest arrive, if you recollect?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I wouldn't have any idea, it seemed to me it was\r\nquite a little while in the matter, probably minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately how long did the priests stay?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I don't remember that, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did they say anything on leaving or in entering?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Not that I heard of personally. I was outside the room when\r\nthe priest was in there. I wasn't in the emergency room while he was in.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When did you find that the President had died?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. When the priest was in to give him the last rites then I\r\nknew that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have any reasonably close estimate on when the\r\nPresident did die?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I haven't right off. I would have to look at some\r\nreports.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you do after the President was pronounced dead?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. We stayed there until everything was settled up. I believe\r\nthere was a judge came in there and I think, someone came in and made\r\nthe decisions on removing the body and the casket was brought in, and\r\nthe body was put in the casket. I had this, his clothing, I kept it in\r\nmy hand at all times, all the time. Then I went, when they removed the\r\ncasket from the emergency room, I was in front of it going out to make\r\na path to get it to the ambulance.\r\n\r\nSo, I helped get it into the ambulance and then I drove a car with some\r\nagents and some people right behind the ambulance to Love Field back to\r\nthe airport again and helped to get the casket aboard the airplane.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you present at the swearing in of President Johnson?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; I was--we were all asked to come back into the\r\nstate room but I wasn't in too close. I was in the main part of the\r\nplane, as close as I could get to it, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How did you personally return to Washington, D.C.?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I returned on Air Force 1 with the President's remains.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at approximately what time did you leave Dallas to fly\r\nback?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I would have to look in my reports to say exactly. I would\r\nhave to go back on the times. Two something but I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have any idea of the time you arrived in the\r\nWashington area?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I believe it was 6 or 6:15. As I say I have it in my reports\r\nbut I haven't looked at the times recently.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where did you arrive in the Washington area?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. At Andrews Air Force Base.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you do next in connection with this matter?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I helped to get the casket out of the plane, and put it into\r\na Navy ambulance and then I drove that Navy ambulance to Bethesda Naval\r\nCenter.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you do upon arriving at the Bethesda Naval Center?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I stayed in, while the autopsy was being performed, I stayed\r\nin the autopsy room with Mr. Kellerman and the doctors and the people\r\nwho were in there. I stayed in there and observed what was necessary\r\nthat I could do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were any Secret Service Agents present besides you and Mr.\r\nKellerman?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At the autopsy?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. There may have been, Mr. Hill may have come in and out but\r\nhe didn't stay there. Mr. Kellerman and I stayed permanently the whole\r\ntime there. There may have been, Mr. Hill may have come in there and\r\nhave gone back out but he didn't stay in there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. During the course of the autopsy did you hear any doctor\r\nsay anything about the wound on the right side of Mr. Kennedy's back?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. That was the first time that I had ever seen it, when the\r\ndoctors were performing the autopsy, they saw this hole in the right\r\nshoulder or back of the head, and in the back, and that was the first\r\nI had known that he was ever shot there, and they brought it to our\r\nattention or discussed it there a little bit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What conversation was there concerning the wound on the\r\nright back?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Well, the doctors and people who were performing the\r\nautopsy, when they turned the body apparently over they discovered that\r\nthis wound was in the back, and they thought that they probably could\r\nget a bullet out of there, and it took a lot of--then they took more\r\nX-rays, they took a lot of X-rays, we looked at them and couldn't find\r\nthe trace of any bullet anywhere in the X-rays at all, nothing showed\r\non the X-rays where this bullet or lead could have gone.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately where in the President's back was the bullet\r\nhole?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. It was, to the best of my recollection it was, back here,\r\njust in the soft part of that shoulder.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating the upper right shoulder area?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Upper right, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any effort made to probe that wound by any\r\ndoctor?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I believe, yes, I believe the doctors probed to see if they\r\ncould find that there was a bullet there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know which doctor that was?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I don't, I don't have their names at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did any doctor make any statement about the results of his\r\nprobing effort?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I questioned one of the doctors in there about that, and\r\nwhen we found out that they had found a bullet in Dallas, I questioned\r\nthe doctor about it and he said if they were using pressure on the\r\nchest that it could very well have been, come back out, where it went\r\nin at, that is what they said at the time.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was anything said about any channel being present in the\r\nbody for the bullet to have gone on through the back?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I hadn't heard anything like that, any trace of it\r\ngoing on through.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you just mention, Mr. Greer, a hole in the President's\r\nhead in addition to the large area of the skull which was shot away?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No. I had just seen that, you know, the head was damaged in\r\nall this part of it but I believe looking at the X-rays, I looked at\r\nthe X-rays when they were taken in the autopsy room, and the person who\r\ndoes that type work showed us the trace of it because there would be\r\nlittle specks of lead where the bullet had come from here and it came\r\nto the--they showed where it didn't come on through. It came to a sinus\r\ncavity or something they said, over the eye.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating the right eye.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I may be wrong.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You don't know which eye?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I don't know which eye, I may be wrong. But they showed us\r\nthe trace of it coming through but there were very little small specks\r\non the X-rays that these professionals knew what course that the bullet\r\nhad taken, the lead.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe in very general terms what injury you\r\nobserved as to the President's head during the course of the autopsy?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I would--to the best of my recollection it was in this part\r\nof the head right here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Upper right?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Upper right side.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Upper right side, going toward the rear.\r\n\r\nAnd what was the condition of the skull at that point?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. The skull was completely--this part was completely gone.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, aside from that opening which you have described and\r\nyou have indicated a circle with a diameter of approximately 5 inches,\r\nwould you say that is about what you have indicated there?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Approximately I would say 5 inches; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any other opening or hole of any sort in\r\nthe head itself?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I didn't. No other one.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Specifically did you observe a hole which would be below\r\nthe large area of skull which was absent?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to look in the back of the head\r\nimmediately below where the skull was missing?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No; I can't remember even examining the head that close at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When President Kennedy was being treated in the emergency\r\nroom at Parkland Hospital, were any pictures or X-rays taken of him\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; not that I know of. I didn't see any being taken.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he ever turned over that you observed while being\r\ntreated at Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir. I can't recollect him ever being turned over.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have any recollection that he was in fact not\r\nturned over?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I couldn't even say. I didn't see them turn him\r\nover in any way in my vision, although my back was to him quite often\r\nand because I was attending to the door and they could have done it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he on a stretcher at the time he was being worked on\r\nat Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I can't remember whether they changed him from a stretcher\r\nto a table. I am not sure on that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Greer, as to the return of the President's automobile\r\nto Washington, do you know how that was accomplished?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. It was driven to Love Field, and put aboard the same C-130\r\nit was taken out on and flown back to Andrews Air Force Base.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know when it was returned from Dallas to the\r\nWashington area?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I believe it was returned shortly after, it left shortly\r\nafter, the President's plane left, was flown back.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I hand you two photographs marked Commission Exhibit No.\r\n352 and Commission Exhibit No. 353.\r\n\r\nDo those photographs represent the condition of the back seat of the\r\nPresident's car at some time?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; they do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at what time do those pictures look just as the back\r\nseat of the President's car looked?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. It looked like that when it came back from Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did it look like that immediately after President Kennedy\r\nwas removed from the back seat?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I wasn't there any more, sir. I was with the President after\r\nthey lifted him out. I didn't see the car after he had been removed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe the back seat of the car at any time\r\nfrom the time you arrived at Parkland Hospital until you observed the\r\nautomobile in Washington?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On November 23?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. By the way, Mr. Greer, how much, approximately, does or\r\ndid the President's automobile weigh?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. It weighed between--well, for flight reason we said 8,000,\r\nbut it wasn't that much. It probably was 7,500. We had extra weight on\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you able to tell the Commission the dimensions of the\r\nautomobile, indicating its length?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir. It is 21 feet 8 inches long.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how wide?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I would have to go back for the width on it. I have it all\r\nin black and white in the office, but I haven't got it with me in my\r\nhead right now; I am sorry.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could three people sit comfortably in the front seat of\r\nthe automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; it was wide enough for three. We many times had an\r\naide in there; many times, an aide rode in the front.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was it as wide or wider than, say, a Cadillac automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; it would be probably the same width.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Was that car specially made for the President?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; it was a specially built car.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Was it a Lincoln Continental?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; a Lincoln Continental.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. How did it differ from the ordinary Lincoln?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Well, Lincoln doesn't make a seven-passenger car, and this\r\nwas a seven-passenger car. The back seat on this car would raise 8\r\ninches. It was electric, and you could lift, you could raise, the seat\r\nup 8 inches from the ground, from the floorboards. It had a little step\r\nthat went with it. The President could raise it up and down himself. He\r\nhad a button alongside that would cause it to go up and down when the\r\ntop wasn't down. It wouldn't go up and down when the top was down. But\r\nwhen it was off he could raise it up or down, and it would be above the\r\nother seat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know whether the seat was actually raised at the\r\ntime of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I couldn't say right off. I don't believe it was,\r\nbut I wouldn't know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Going back to the shots themselves, Mr. Greer, do you have\r\nany reaction as to the direction from which the shots came?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. They sounded like they were behind me, to the right rear of\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would that be as to all three shots?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir. They sounded, everything sounded, behind me, to\r\nme. That was my thought, train of thought, that they were behind me.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever had any reaction or thought at any time\r\nsince the assassination that the shots came from the front of the car?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I had never even the least thought that they could\r\ncome. There was no thought in my mind other than that they were behind\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Congressman Boggs, are there any questions you would like\r\nto ask the agent?\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. I don't think so, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Congressman Ford.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you ever have any thought there were more than\r\nthree shots?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I never did.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you positively identify the fact that there\r\nwere one, two, three, or was there one, and then a delay, and then a\r\nflurry?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. To the best of my recollection, Congressman, was that the\r\nlast two were closer together than the first one. It seemed like the\r\nfirst one, and then there was, you know, bang, bang, just right behind\r\nit almost. The two seemed, the last two seemed, closer to me than the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did you speed up after you heard the first shot?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. After I heard the second. The first one didn't sink into me,\r\ndidn't give me the thought that it was a shot. I thought it was the\r\nbackfire of a motorcycle. But when I heard the second one and glanced\r\nover my shoulder, I knew something was wrong then. I didn't know how\r\nbad anyone was injured or anything, but I knew there was something\r\nwrong, and right away after the second one I accelerated as fast as I\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Craig, would you like to ask any questions?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the position of the President's car that you were\r\ndriving as it approached the underpass, you state now that you couldn't\r\nfix any specific distance. But would you say it was less than a mile\r\nthat the President's car was from the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Oh, definitely. I couldn't say in feet or yards, but it was\r\nwithin--it was feet. I would say probably a hundred or 200 feet. It\r\ncould be within that; it was definitely right up close to me, but I----\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. With respect to your vision, was it unobstructed down the\r\nroadway, looking at the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; there were no obstructions in the road that I\r\ncould see.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. As I recall your testimony, you were actually observing the\r\noverpass to see if there was any person there.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. People up there at that time I would be doubtful of going\r\nunderneath.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes, sir. And you say now you do not recollect that you saw\r\nanyone there?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. You said also, I believe, that it was some time now since\r\nyou made that observation. Did you make any report of any kind with\r\nrespect to anyone being on the overpass immediately after this incident?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. You made no written report to anybody as to whether or not\r\nthere were people on the overpass or were not people?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I haven't.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Do you believe if you had observed people on the overpass at\r\nthat time you would now remember it?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Yes, sir; I believe I would; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. If you had observed people on the overpass as you proceeded\r\ntoward it, and they were other than a policeman or policemen or some\r\nother law-enforcement agent, what would you have done?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Well, I try never to go underneath a bridge if there\r\nare people up over it, if there are people who I don't know as law\r\nenforcement. I try not to go underneath them. I will probably veer to\r\none side of them at any time. That is a matter of our training, that\r\nwe try not to go underneath anyone with an open car where anyone could\r\ndrop something.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Would you ever stop, if necessary, if you thought there were\r\npeople up there that you couldn't veer around?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. If there was any danger there I would have to either change\r\nmy way of traveling. I have never had it happen, and never had any\r\nreason to, but we try, I try, not to go underneath a group of people\r\nstanding on any overpass at any time. I try to move over, if the\r\ncondition permits me to. Sometimes, when the road is too narrow, I\r\ncouldn't. But that is part of our procedure, I think, to see that no\r\none is on an overpass.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. That is all.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. If there are no further questions----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, may I ask one or two other questions?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I have just noted that we have the report of the FBI which\r\nbears Bureau file No. 105-S, as it appears here somewhat indistinct,\r\nS-2555, \"Report of Special Agent Robert P. Gemberling, dated December\r\n10, 1963,\" and this refers, Mr. Greer, to an interview of you by\r\nSpecial Agents Francis X. O'Neill, Jr., and James W. Sibert. There is\r\na report here of an interview of you and of Special Agent Kellerman,\r\nand the date here is listed as November 22, 1963, and there is this\r\nreference made in the report, and I will quote it verbatim:\r\n\r\n\"Greer stated that he first heard what he thought was possibly a\r\nmotorcycle backfire, and glanced around and noticed that the President\r\nhad evidently been hit. He thereafter got on the radio and communicated\r\nwith the other vehicles stating that they desired to get the President\r\nto the hospital immediately.\"\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I didn't go on the radio. It was Mr. Kellerman who done the\r\nradio talking. I didn't. It is a misquote if I done it. I didn't get on\r\nthe radio. Mr. Kellerman did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you ever make this statement, Mr. Greer, to Special\r\nAgent O'Neill or Sibert?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Those two agents were in during the autopsy; those two\r\nagents were in the autopsy room, with Mr. Kellerman and I, all night.\r\nMr. Sibert and O'Neill were both in the autopsy room with us during\r\nthat time, and the only time that any of us, either Mr. Kellerman or I,\r\nwe never left the room, one or the other. We went and got some coffee\r\nand came right back, something like that, and the FBI did the same\r\nthing. One of them left; the other stayed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you now recollect whether or not you ever said to them\r\nthat you were the one who communicated on the radio with the other\r\nvehicles?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I know I never remember saying that to them because\r\nI know I didn't do it. So that is how I know that I didn't say it,\r\nbecause I know I didn't do it. Mr. Kellerman did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And the first part refers to your noticing that the\r\nPresident evidently had been hit. Did you ever----\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I have no recollection of ever telling the agents that I\r\nsaid that; no, sir. If I said it, I don't remember saying it. The\r\nGovernor was the person that I knew was--when we were first in trouble,\r\nwhen I see the Governor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. To the best of your current recollection, did you notice\r\nthat the President had been hit?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I didn't know how badly he was injured or anything\r\nother than that. I didn't know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you know at all, from the glance which you have\r\ndescribed that he had been hit or injured in any way?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I knew he was injured in some way, but I didn't know how bad\r\nor what.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How did you know that?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. If I remember now, I just don't remember how I knew, but\r\nI knew we were in trouble. I knew that he was injured, but I can't\r\nremember, recollect, just how I knew there were injuries in there. I\r\ndidn't know who all was hurt, even.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you able to recollect whether you saw the President\r\nafter the shots as you were proceeding toward Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No; I don't remember ever seeing him any more until I got to\r\nthe hospital, and he was lying across the seat, you know, and that is\r\nthe first I had seen of him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Your best recollection is, then, that you had the\r\nimpression he was injured but you couldn't ascertain the source of that\r\ninformation?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Right. I couldn't ascertain the source.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you hear the President say anything after the\r\nfirst shot?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; I never heard him say anything; never at any time\r\ndid I ever hear him say anything.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did Mrs. Kennedy say anything to you while you\r\nwere driving to the hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No, sir; she didn't.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did Mrs. Connally say anything to you?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. No. Mrs. Connally didn't say anything, either. There is\r\nquite a little distance between the front and the back seat of that\r\ncar. As you know, it is 21 feet long, and you are quite a little bit\r\naway, and there was the sirens were all going. The following car had a\r\nsiren wide--the big one on the fender was wide open. There wasn't much\r\nchance for me to hear anything, and I was really occupied with getting\r\nthere just as fast as I could and not seeing that anything happened,\r\navoid an accident or anything like that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have a siren on your car?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I didn't have mine going. There is a siren on that car, but\r\nI didn't even reach down to work it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. There was another agent in the car with you?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Mr. Kellerman; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. And after the first shot, did he say to speed up\r\nor what?\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. I believe it was at the second that he and I both\r\nsimultaneously--he said, \"Get out of here fast,\" and I speeded up as\r\nfast as I could then and as fast as the car would go.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. If there are no further questions, thank you very much,\r\nMr. Greer.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You may be excused.\r\n\r\nMr. GREER. Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. We will take a short recess.\r\n\r\n(Short recess.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Hill, come right in, sir. Would you raise your right\r\nhand, please, and be sworn? Do you solemnly swear that the testimony\r\nyou give before this Commission will be the truth, the whole truth, and\r\nnothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Would you be seated, please, Mr. Hill?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Specter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF CLINTON J. HILL, SPECIAL AGENT, SECRET SERVICE\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Hill, would you state your full name for the record,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Clinton J. Hill.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How old are you, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Thirty-two.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your educational background?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I went to secondary educational high school in Washburn, N.\r\nDak., and then went on to Concordia College, Moorehead, Minn. I was a\r\nhistory and education major, with a minor in physical education.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What year were you graduated?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. 1954.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What have you done since the time of graduation from\r\ncollege, Mr. Hill?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I went into the Army in 1954; remained in the Army until\r\n1957. Then I couldn't determine what I wanted to do, whether to go\r\nto law school or not, and I took a couple of odd jobs. I worked for\r\na finance company at one time. Then I went to work for the Chicago,\r\nBurlington & Quincy Railroad as a special agent in the spring of 1958,\r\nand entered the Secret Service in September 1958.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You have been with the Secret Service since September 1958\r\nto the present time?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you outline for the Commission your duties with the\r\nSecret Service during your tenure there?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I entered the Secret Service in Denver, and during that\r\nperiod I did both investigative and protection work. I was assigned to\r\nMrs. Doud, the mother-in-law of President Eisenhower. I attended the\r\nTreasury Law Enforcement School during my first year, and was sent to\r\nthe White House for a 30-day temporary assignment at the White House in\r\nJune 1959. In November of 1959, November 1, I was transferred to the\r\nWhite House on a permanent basis as a special agent assigned to the\r\nWhite House detail. I have been at the White House since that time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, were you assigned to duties on the trip of President\r\nKennedy to Texas in November 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir; I was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any special duty assigned to you at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In connection with the trip?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I was responsible for the protection of Mrs. Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, in a general way, what does that sort of an\r\nassignment involve?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I tried to remain as close to her at all times as possible,\r\nand in this particular trip that meant being with the President because\r\nall of their doings on this trip were together rather than separate. I\r\nwould go over her schedule to make sure she knows what she is expected\r\nto do; discuss it with her; remain in her general area all the time;\r\nprotect her from any danger.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you tell us, in a general way, what were the\r\nactivities of the President and Mrs. Kennedy on the morning of Friday,\r\nNovember 22, before they arrived in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I went to the fifth floor, I believe it was, where the\r\nPresident and Mrs. Kennedy were staying in the Texas Hotel in Fort\r\nWorth at 8:15 in the morning. President Kennedy was to go downstairs\r\nand across the street to make a speech to a gathering in a parking lot.\r\nI remained on the floor during the period the President was gone.\r\n\r\nIt was raining outside, I recall. About 9:25 I received word from\r\nSpecial Agent Duncan that the President requested Mrs. Kennedy to come\r\nto the mezzanine, where a breakfast was being held in his honor, and\r\nwhere he was about to speak. I went in and advised Mrs. Kennedy of\r\nthis, and took her down to where the President was speaking; remained\r\nwith her adjacent to the head table in this particular area during the\r\nspeech; and accompanied she and the President back up to the, I believe\r\nit was, the fifth floor of the hotel, their residential area; remained\r\non that floor until we left, went downstairs, got into the motorcade,\r\nand departed the hotel for the airport to leave Fort Worth for Dallas.\r\n\r\nWe were airborne approximately 11:20, I believe, in Air Force 1. I was\r\nin the aft compartment, which is part of the residential compartment,\r\nand we arrived in Dallas at 11:40.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe, in a general way, what the President\r\nand Mrs. Kennedy did upon arrival in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. They debarked the rear ramp of the aircraft first, followed\r\nby Governor and Mrs. Connally, various Congressmen and Senators. And\r\nSpecial Agent in Charge Kellerman and myself went down the ramp. There\r\nwas a small reception committee at the foot of the ramp, and somebody\r\ngave Mrs. Kennedy some red roses, I recall. I walked immediately to\r\nthe followup car and placed my topcoat, which is a raincoat, and small\r\nenvelope containing some information concerning the Dallas stop in the\r\nfollowup car, returning to where the President and Mrs. Kennedy were at\r\nthat time greeting a crippled lady in a wheelchair.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What do you estimate the size of the crowd to have been at\r\nDallas that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. At the airport?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. It is rather difficult to say. They were behind a chain-link\r\nfence, not on the airport ramp itself, and they were jammed up against\r\nthe fence holding placards, and many young people in the crowd. I\r\nwould say there were probably 2,000 people there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At approximately what time did the motorcade depart from\r\nLove Field to Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Approximately 11:55.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know approximately how many automobiles there were\r\nin the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. No, sir; I do not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In which car in the motorcade were you positioned?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I was working the followup car, which is the car immediately\r\nbehind the Presidential car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how many cars are there ahead of the followup car,\r\nthen, in the entire motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. There was a lead car ahead of the President's car, the\r\nPresident's car, then this particular followup car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know whether there was any car in advance of the\r\ncar termed the lead car?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. There could have been a pilot car, but I am not sure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, approximately how far in front of the President's car\r\ndid the lead car stay during the course of the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I would say a half block, maybe.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how far was the President's car in front of the\r\nPresident's followup car during the course of the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Approximately 5 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there some well-established practice as to the spacing\r\nbetween the President's car and the President's followup car?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. It would depend upon speed. We attempt to stay as close to\r\nthe President's car as practical. At high rates of speed it is rather\r\ndifficult to stay close because of the danger involved. Slow speeds,\r\nthe followup car stays as close as possible so that the agents on the\r\nfollowup car can get to the Presidential car as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the first car to the rear of the President's\r\nfollowup car?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. The Vice-Presidential automobile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What car was immediately behind the Vice President's\r\nautomobile?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. The Vice-Presidential followup car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know what cars in the Dallas motorcade followed the\r\nVice President's followup car?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Well, I couldn't say which car any individual rode in after\r\nthat particular automobile, but I could say they were occupied by\r\nmembers of the staff, both President Kennedy's and Vice President\r\nJohnson's; Congressmen and Senators who were on this particular trip;\r\nnewspaper personnel who were on this trip.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you identify the occupants of the President's\r\nfollowup car and indicate where each was in the automobile.\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. The car itself was driven by Special Agent Sam Kinney, and\r\nAssistant to the Special Agent in Charge Emory Roberts was riding in\r\nthe right front seat. I was assigned to work the left running board of\r\nthe automobile, the forward portion of that running board. McIntyre was\r\nassigned to work the rear portion of the left running board. Special\r\nAgent John Ready was assigned the forward portion of the right running\r\nboard; Special Agent Paul Landis was assigned the rear portion of the\r\nright running board. There were two jump seats, and they were occupied\r\nby two Presidential aides, Mr. O'Donnell and Mr. Powers. Mr. Powers\r\nwas sitting on the right-hand side; Mr. O'Donnell on the left. The\r\nrear seat was occupied, left rear by Special Agent Hickey, right rear,\r\nSpecial Agent Bennett.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How were the agents armed at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. All the agents were armed with their hand weapons.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is there any weapon in the automobile in addition to\r\nthe hand weapons?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes. There is an AR-15, which is an automatic rifle, and a\r\nshotgun.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where is the AR-15 kept?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Between the two agents in the rear seat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about the shotgun; where is that kept?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. In a compartment immediately in front of the jump seats.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is the President's followup car a specially constructed\r\nautomobile?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is the make and model and general description of\r\nthat vehicle?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. It is a 1955 Cadillac, nine-passenger touring sedan. It is a\r\nconvertible type.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that automobile flown in specially from Washington for\r\nthe occasion?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes; it was, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know how that automobile was transported to Dallas,\r\nTex.?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Generally, it is flown in a C-130 by the Air Force. I am not\r\nsure how on this particular occasion.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe, in a general way, the composition of\r\nthe crowds en route from Love Field down to the center of Dallas,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Well, when we left Love Field, we went away from the crowd\r\nto get to the exit point at Love Field, and there were no crowds at\r\nall, and then we, departing Love Field, found the crowds were sporadic.\r\nThere were people here and there. Some places they had built up and\r\nother places they were thinned out. The speed of the motorcade was\r\nadjusted accordingly. Whenever there were large groups of people,\r\nthe motorcade slowed down to give the people an opportunity to view\r\nthe President. When there were not many people along the side of the\r\nstreet, we speeded up. We didn't really hit the crowds until we hit\r\nMain Street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate of the maximum speed of the\r\nautomobile from the time you left Love Field until the time you arrived\r\nat downtown Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I would say we never ran any faster than 25 to 30 miles per\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate of the minimum speed during\r\nthis same interval?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Twelve to fifteen miles per hour. We did stop.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On what occasion did you stop?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Between Love Field and Main Street, downtown Dallas, on the\r\nright-hand side of the street there were a group of people with a long\r\nbanner which said, \"Please, Mr. President, stop and shake our hands.\"\r\nAnd the President requested the motorcade to stop, and he beckoned to\r\nthe people and asked them to come and shake his hand, which they did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did the President disembark from his automobile at that\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. No; he remained in his seat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At that time what action, if any, did you take?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I jumped from the followup car and ran up to the left rear\r\nportion of the automobile with my back toward Mrs. Kennedy viewing\r\nthose persons on the left-hand side of the street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What action was taken by any other Secret Service agent\r\nwhich you observed at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Special Agent Ready, who was working the forward portion of\r\nthe right running board, did the same thing, only on the President's\r\nside, placed his back toward the car, and viewed the people facing\r\nthe President. Assistant in Charge Kellerman opened the door of the\r\nPresident's car and stepped out on the street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What action was taken by Special Agent McIntyre, if you\r\nknow?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I do not know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about Special Agent Landis?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I do not know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your normal procedure for action in the event the\r\nPresident's car is stopped, as it did in that event?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Special Agent McIntyre would normally jump off the car and\r\nrun to the forward portion of the left-hand side of the car; Special\r\nAgent Landis would move to the right-hand forward portion of the\r\nautomobile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did anything else which was unusual occur en route from\r\nLove Field to the downtown area of Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Before we hit Main Street?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Not that I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any occasion to leave the President's\r\nfollowup car at any time?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. When we finally did reach Main Street, the crowds had\r\nbuilt up to a point where they were surging into the street. We had\r\nmotorcycles running adjacent to both the Presidential automobile and\r\nthe followup car, as well as in front of the Presidential automobile,\r\nand because of the crowds in the street, the President's driver,\r\nSpecial Agent Greer, was running the car more to the left-hand side of\r\nthe street more than he was to the right to keep the President as far\r\naway from the crowd as possible, and because of this the motorcycles on\r\nthe left-hand side could not get past the crowd and alongside the car,\r\nand they were forced to drop back. I jumped from the followup car, ran\r\nup and got on top of the rear portion of the Presidential automobile to\r\nbe close to Mrs. Kennedy in the event that someone attempted to grab\r\nher from the crowd or throw something in the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say the rear portion of the automobile, can you,\r\nby referring to Commission Exhibit No. 345, heretofore identified as\r\nthe President's automobile, specify by penciled \"X\" where you stood?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe for the record just what area it is back\r\nthere on which you stood?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. That is a step built into the rear bumper of the automobile,\r\nand on top of the rear trunk there is a handguard which you grab for\r\nand hang onto when you are standing up.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are identical objects of those descriptions existing on\r\neach side of the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir; they do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any other occasion en route from Love Field\r\nto downtown Dallas to leave the followup car and mount that portion of\r\nthe President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I did the same thing approximately four times.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What are the standard regulations and practices, if any,\r\ngoverning such an action on your part?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. It is left to the agent's discretion more or less to move to\r\nthat particular position when he feels that there is a danger to the\r\nPresident; to place himself as close to the President or the First Lady\r\nas my case was, as possible, which I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are those practices specified in any written documents of\r\nthe Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. No; they are not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, had there been any instruction or comment about\r\nyour performance of that type of a duty with respect to anything that\r\nPresident Kennedy himself had said in the period immediately preceding\r\nthe trip to Texas?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir; there was. The preceding Monday, the President was\r\non a trip in Tampa, Fla., and he requested that the agents not ride on\r\neither of those two steps.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And to whom did the President make that request?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Assistant Special Agent in Charge Boring.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was Assistant Special Agent in Charge Boring the\r\nindividual in charge of that trip to Florida?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. He was riding in the Presidential automobile on that trip in\r\nFlorida, and I presume that he was. I was not along.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, on that occasion would he have been in a position\r\ncomparable to that occupied by Special Agent Kellerman on this trip to\r\nTexas?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir; the same position.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And Special Agent Boring informed you of that instruction\r\nby President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir; he did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he make it a point to inform other special agents of\r\nthat same instruction?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I believe that he did, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, as a result of what President Kennedy said to him,\r\ndid he instruct you to observe that Presidential admonition?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How, if at all, did that instruction of President Kennedy\r\naffect your action and--your action in safeguarding him on this trip to\r\nDallas?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. We did not ride on the rear portions of the automobile. I did\r\non those four occasions because the motorcycles had to drop back and\r\nthere was no protection on the left-hand side of the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When the President's automobile was proceeding in downtown\r\nDallas, what was the ordinary speed of the automobile, based on your\r\nbest estimate?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. We were running approximately 12 to 15 miles per hour, I\r\nwould say.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I show you a document which we have marked as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 354, which is an aerial photograph identical with the\r\nphotograph already marked as Commission Exhibit No. 347.\r\n\r\n(The photograph referred to was marked Exhibit No. 354 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I ask you if, referring only to Exhibit 354, you are able\r\nto identify what that scene is.\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir; I am.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you able to indicate the route which the President's\r\nmotorcade followed through that area?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir; I am.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what does that scene depict--what city is it?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. That is Dallas, Tex. It shows Main Street, Houston Street,\r\nand Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you write on the picture itself where Main Street is?\r\nWould you now write, as best you can, which street is Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And would you now write which street is Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, would you indicate, if you know, which is a generally\r\nnortherly direction on that picture?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. What was the condition of the crowd as the\r\nmotorcade made a right-hand turn off of Main Street onto Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. The crowd was very large on Main Street, and it was thinning\r\ndown considerably when we reached the end of it, and turned right\r\non Houston Street. Noticeably on my side of the car, which was the\r\nleft-hand side of the street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your best estimate as to the speed of the\r\nPresident's car at the time it made the right-hand turn onto Houston\r\nStreet?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. In the curve?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The speed--in the curve itself; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. We were running generally 12 to 15 miles per hour. I would\r\nsay that in the curve we perhaps slowed to maybe 10 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how far behind the President's car was the\r\nPresidential followup car as the turn was made onto Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Four to five feet, at the most.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I show you a photograph of a building which has already\r\nbeen marked as Commission Exhibit No. 348, and ask you if at this time\r\nyou can identify what that building is.\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I believe I can, sir; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what building is it?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. It is the Texas School Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, does that building appear on the Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 354?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir; it does.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any occasion to notice the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building as you proceeded in a generally northerly direction\r\non Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir. It was immediately in front of us and to our left.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you notice anything unusual about it?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Nothing more unusual than any other building along the way.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your general practice, if any, in observing such\r\nbuildings along the route of a Presidential motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. We scan the buildings and look specifically for open windows,\r\nfor people hanging out, and there had been, on almost every building\r\nalong the way, people hanging out, windows open.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you observe, as you recollect at this moment, any\r\nopen windows in the Texas School Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir; there were.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you able to recollect specifically which windows were\r\nopen at this time?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. No, sir; I cannot.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the condition of the crowd along the streets, if\r\nany, along Elm Street, in front of the Texas School Book Depository\r\nBuilding?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. On the left-hand side of the street, which is the side I was\r\non, the crowd was very thin. And it was a general park area. There were\r\npeople scattered throughout the entire park.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, what is your best estimate of the speed of the\r\nPresident's automobile as it turned left off of Houston onto Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. We were running still 12 to 15 miles per hour, but in the\r\ncurve I believe we slowed down maybe to 10, maybe to 9.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How far back of the President's automobile was the\r\nPresidential followup car when the President's followup car had just\r\nstraightened out on Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Approximately 5 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, as the motorcade proceeded at that point, tell us\r\nwhat happened.\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Well, as we came out of the curve, and began to straighten\r\nup, I was viewing the area which looked to be a park. There were people\r\nscattered throughout the entire park. And I heard a noise from my right\r\nrear, which to me seemed to be a firecracker. I immediately looked\r\nto my right, and, in so doing, my eyes had to cross the Presidential\r\nlimousine and I saw President Kennedy grab at himself and lurch forward\r\nand to the left.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why don't you just proceed, in narrative form, to tell us?\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. This was the first shot?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. This is the first sound that I heard; yes, sir. I jumped from\r\nthe car, realizing that something was wrong, ran to the Presidential\r\nlimousine. Just about as I reached it, there was another sound,\r\nwhich was different than the first sound. I think I described it in\r\nmy statement as though someone was shooting a revolver into a hard\r\nobject--it seemed to have some type of an echo. I put my right foot, I\r\nbelieve it was, on the left rear step of the automobile, and I had a\r\nhold of the handgrip with my hand, when the car lurched forward. I lost\r\nmy footing and I had to run about three or four more steps before I\r\ncould get back up in the car.\r\n\r\nBetween the time I originally grabbed the handhold and until I was up\r\non the car, Mrs. Kennedy--the second noise that I heard had removed a\r\nportion of the President's head, and he had slumped noticeably to his\r\nleft. Mrs. Kennedy had jumped up from the seat and was, it appeared to\r\nme, reaching for something coming off the right rear bumper of the\r\ncar, the right rear tail, when she noticed that I was trying to climb\r\non the car. She turned toward me and I grabbed her and put her back in\r\nthe back seat, crawled up on top of the back seat and lay there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, referring to Commission Exhibit No. 354, would\r\nyou mark an \"X\", as best you can, at the spot where the President's\r\nautomobile was at the time the first shot occurred?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Approximately there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And would you mark a \"Y\" at the approximate position where\r\nthe President's car was at the second shot you have described? What is\r\nyour best estimate of the speed of the President's car at the precise\r\ntime of the first shot, Mr. Hill?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. We were running between 12 to 15 miles per hour, but no\r\nfaster than 15 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many shots have you described that you heard?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Two.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you hear any more than two shots?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your best estimate of the speed of the\r\nPresident's automobile at the time of the second shot?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Approximately the same speed as that of the first--although\r\nat the time that I jumped on the car, the car had surged forward. The\r\nPresident at that time had been shot in the head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When, in relationship to the second shot, did the car\r\naccelerate--that is, the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Almost simultaneously.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You testified just a moment ago that the President grabbed\r\nat himself immediately after the first noise which you described as\r\nsounding like a firecracker.\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you tell us with more particularity in what way he\r\ngrabbed at himself?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. He grabbed in this general area.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You are indicating that your right hand is coming up to\r\nyour--to the throat?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And the left hand crosses right under the right hand.\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. To the chest area.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. To the chest area. Was there any movement of the\r\nPresident's head or shoulders immediately after the first shot, that\r\nyou recollect?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir. Immediately when I saw him, he was like this, and\r\ngoing left and forward.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating a little fall to the left front.\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. This was after a head wound?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Before the head wound?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir; this was the first shot.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, what is your best estimate on the timespan between\r\nthe first firecracker-type noise you heard and the second shot which\r\nyou have described?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Approximately 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, did the impact on the President's head occur\r\nsimultaneously, before, or after the second noise which you have\r\ndescribed?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Almost simultaneously.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you see the President put his hands to his\r\nthroat and chest while you were still on the followup car, or after you\r\nhad left it?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. As I was leaving. And that is one of the reasons I jumped,\r\nbecause I saw him grab himself and pitch forward and to the left. I\r\nknew something was wrong.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It was 5 seconds from the firecracker noise that\r\nyou think you got to the automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Until I reached the handhold, had placed my foot on the left\r\nrear step.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When, in relationship to the second shot, did Mrs. Kennedy\r\nmove out of the rear seat?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Just after it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You say that it appeared that she was reaching as if\r\nsomething was coming over to the rear portion of the car, back in the\r\narea where you were coming to?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there anything back there that you observed, that she\r\nmight have been reaching for?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I thought I saw something come off the back, too, but I\r\ncannot say that there was. I do know that the next day we found the\r\nportion of the President's head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where did you find that portion of the President's head?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. It was found in the street. It was turned in, I believe, by a\r\nmedical student or somebody in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any difficulty maintaining your balance on\r\nthe back of the car after you had come up on the top of it?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Not until we turned off to enter the Parkland Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, what action did you take specifically with respect to\r\nplacing Mrs. Kennedy back in the rear seat?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I simply just pushed and she moved--somewhat\r\nvoluntarily--right back into the same seat she was in. The\r\nPresident--when she had attempted to get out onto the trunk of the car,\r\nhis body apparently did not move too much, because when she got back\r\ninto the car he was at that time, when I got on top of the car, face up\r\nin her lap.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And that was after she was back in the rear seat?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where were the President's legs at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Inside the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, what, if anything, did you observe as to the\r\ncondition of Governor Connally at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. After going under this underpass, I looked forward to the\r\njump seats, where Mrs. Connally and Governor Connally were sitting.\r\nMrs. Connally had been leaning over her husband. And I had no idea that\r\nhe had been shot. And when she leaned back at one time, I noticed that\r\nhis coat was unbuttoned, and that the lower portion of his abdomen was\r\ncompletely covered with blood.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When was it that you first observed that?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Just after going under the underpass.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to observe anything which was occurring on\r\nthe overpass as the President's motorcade moved toward the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. From the time I got on the back of the Presidential\r\nlimousine, I didn't really pay any attention to what was going on\r\noutside the automobile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had you noticed the overpass prior to the time you got on\r\nthe Presidential automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes; I had scanned it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do you recollect what, if anything, you observed on\r\nthe overpass at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. There were some people there, but I also noticed there was a\r\npoliceman there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately how many people would you say were there?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Very few, I would say--maybe five, six.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how were you able to identify that there was a\r\npoliceman there?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. He was wearing the uniform--presumably a policeman.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What color uniform was it?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I think it was blue of some shade.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you identify it at that time as being of the identical\r\ncolor which other Dallas policemen were wearing whom you had observed\r\nin the area?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. That's correct, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you characterize the type of acceleration which the\r\ncar made after it started to speed forward--that is, the Presidential\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Well, the initial surge was quite violent, because it\r\nalmost jerked me off the left rear step board. Then after that it was\r\napparently gradual, because I did not notice it any more.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate of the distance from the time\r\nof the shooting to Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. In time or----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Time and distance.\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Distance, I have no idea.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about time?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I would say roughly 4 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Mrs. Kennedy say anything as you were proceeding from\r\nthe time of the shooting to Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. At the time of the shooting, when I got into the rear of the\r\ncar, she said, \"My God, they have shot his head off.\" Between there and\r\nthe hospital she just said, \"Jack, Jack, what have they done to you,\"\r\nand sobbed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any conversation by anybody else in the\r\nPresident's automobile from the time of the shooting to the arrival at\r\nParkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I heard Special Agent Kellerman say on the radio, \"To the\r\nnearest hospital, quick.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Any other comment?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. He said, \"We have been hit.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, was there any other comment you heard Special Agent\r\nKellerman make?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Not that I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Special Agent Greer say anything?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mrs. Connally say anything?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Was Governor Connally conscious?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir; he was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Governor Connally say anything?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did President Kennedy say anything?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate on the speed at which the\r\nPresident's car traveled from the point of the shooting to Parkland\r\nHospital?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. It is a little bit hard for me to judge, since I was lying\r\nacross the rear portion of the automobile. I had no trouble staying in\r\nthat particular position--until we approached the hospital, I recall,\r\nI believe it was a left-hand turn and I started slipping off to the\r\nright-hand portion of the car. So I would say that we went 60, maybe 65\r\nat the most.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to secure a handhold or a leg-hold or any\r\nsort of a hold on the automobile as you moved forward?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir. I had my legs--I had my body above the rear seat,\r\nand my legs hooked down into the rear seat, one foot outside the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate of the time of the\r\nassassination itself?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Approximately 12:30.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I am not sure whether I asked you about this--about how\r\nlong did it take you to get from the shooting to the hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Approximately 4 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe as to President Kennedy's condition\r\non arrival at the hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. The right rear portion of his head was missing. It was lying\r\nin the rear seat of the car. His brain was exposed. There was blood and\r\nbits of brain all over the entire rear portion of the car. Mrs. Kennedy\r\nwas completely covered with blood. There was so much blood you could\r\nnot tell if there had been any other wound or not, except for the one\r\nlarge gaping wound in the right rear portion of the head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any opportunity to observe the front part of\r\nhis body, to see whether there was any tear or rip in the clothing on\r\nthe front?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I saw him lying there in the back of the car, when I was\r\nimmediately above him. I cannot recall noticing anything that was\r\nripped in the forward portion of his body.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What action, if any, did you take to shield the\r\nPresident's body?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I kept myself above the President and Mrs. Kennedy on the\r\ntrip to Parkland.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you do anything with your coat upon arrival at\r\nParkland Hospital to shield the President?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir. I removed it and covered the President's head and\r\nupper chest.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What, if anything, did you observe as to Governor\r\nConnally's condition on arrival at Parkland?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. He was conscious. There was a large amount of blood in\r\nthe lower abdominal area. He was helped from the automobile to the\r\nstretcher, and I do not recall him saying anything, but I know that he\r\nwas conscious. He was wheeled immediately into, I think, emergency room\r\nNo. 2.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who was removed first from the automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Governor Connally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long after the President's car arrived at Parkland\r\nHospital did medical personnel come to the scene to remove the victims?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Seconds. They were there when we were there almost--almost\r\nsimultaneously with the arrival.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know where President Kennedy was taken in the\r\nhospital?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir. I accompanied he, and Mrs. Kennedy to the emergency\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, tell us what you did at the hospital from the time of\r\narrival on, please.\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I went into the emergency room with the President, but it\r\nwas so small, and there were so many people in there that I decided I\r\nhad better leave and let the doctors take care of the situation. So I\r\nwalked outside; asked for the nearest telephone; walked to the nearest\r\ntelephone. About that time Special Agent in Charge Kellerman came\r\noutside and said, \"Get the White House.\"\r\n\r\nI asked Special Agent Lawson for the local number in Dallas of the\r\nWhite House switchboard, which he gave to me. I called the switchboard\r\nin Dallas; asked for the line to be open to Washington, and remain\r\nopen continuously. And then I asked for Special Agent in Charge Behn's\r\noffice. Mr. Kellerman came out of the emergency room about that time,\r\ntook the telephone and called Special Agent in Charge Behn that we\r\nhad had a double tragedy; that both Governor Connally and President\r\nKennedy had been shot. And that was about as much as he said. I then\r\ntook the telephone and shortly thereafter Mr. Kellerman came out of the\r\nemergency room and said, \"Clint, tell Jerry this is unofficial and not\r\nfor release, but the man is dead.\" Which I did. During the two calls,\r\nI talked to the Attorney General, who attempted to reach me, and told\r\nhim that his brother had been seriously wounded; that we would keep him\r\nadvised as to his condition.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was Mrs. Kennedy all this time, if you know?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Immediately upon arrival, she went into the emergency room.\r\nAnd a few minutes afterward, she was convinced to wait outside, which\r\nshe did, remained there the rest of the period of time that we were\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was there any pronouncement that the President had\r\ndied?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Not that I know of. Apparently there was. I was requested by\r\nMr. O'Donnell, one of the Presidential assistants, to obtain a casket,\r\nbecause they wanted to return to Washington immediately. I contacted\r\nthe administrator of the hospital and asked him to take me where I\r\ncould telephone the nearest mortuary, which I did, requested that their\r\nbest available casket be brought to the emergency entrance in my name\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what action was taken as a result of that request by\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. The casket did arrive from the O'Neal Mortuary, Inc., in\r\ntheir own hearse, which we then wheeled into the emergency room. I\r\nleft the emergency room and asked that two of our agents, Special\r\nAgent Sulliman and Assistant Special Agent in Charge Stout clear all\r\nthe corridors, and I checked the closest and most immediate route to\r\nthe ambulance. We took the body from the hospital and departed the\r\nParkland Hospital about 2:04 p.m. The ambulance was driven by Special\r\nAgent Berger. Special Agent in Charge Kellerman and Assistant Special\r\nAgent In Charge Stout were riding in the front seat; Mrs. Kennedy, Dr.\r\nBurkley, the President's body, and myself rode in the rear portion of\r\nthe ambulance.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately how long did it take you to reach the\r\nairplane at Love Field?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. We arrived at Love Field at 2:14.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were you present during the swearing-in ceremonies of\r\nPresident Johnson?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I was aboard the aircraft; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you witness those ceremonies?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Well, the Presidential compartment was so small that not all\r\npersons on the aircraft could get in. I was in the forward portion of\r\nthe aircraft, right adjacent to the area that the President was sworn\r\nin.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know the time of the swearing in?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. 2:38.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what time did the Presidential aircraft depart?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. 2:47.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know what time it arrived in the Washington area?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. 5:59, I believe, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where did it land?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. We landed at Andrews Air Force Base.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what action, if any, in connection with this matter\r\ndid you take following landing?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I assisted Mrs. Kennedy and the Attorney General, who had\r\njoined her at that time, into the ambulance bearing the President's\r\nbody, and I entered the automobile immediately behind the ambulance\r\nwith Dr. John Walsh, Mrs. Kennedy's physician, and members of President\r\nKennedy's staff.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where did you go then?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Immediately to Bethesda Naval Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you stay with the President's family at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. When we arrived there, I went to the 17th floor with Mrs.\r\nKennedy, and I remained with Mrs. Kennedy except for one time when I\r\nwas requested to come to the morgue to view the President's body.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you view the President's body?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What action did you take following the time you viewed the\r\nPresident's body in the morgue?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. After the viewing of the President's body?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I returned to the 17th floor and remained with Mrs. Kennedy\r\nuntil we departed the hospital.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. May I ask a question? At the hospital in Texas,\r\nyou had seen--had you seen the whole body, or just the back of the\r\nPresident's head?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I had seen the whole body, but he was still cold when I saw\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. At the morgue in Bethesda he was not cold?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir; the autopsy had been completed, and the Lawler\r\nMortuary Co. was preparing the body for placement in a casket.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. At this time did you see the whole body?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did you see any other wound other than the head\r\nwound?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Yes, sir; I saw an opening in the back, about 6 inches below\r\nthe neckline to the right-hand side of the spinal column.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Was there a frontal neck injury?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. There was an area here that had been opened but----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You are indicating----\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. In the neck. It was my understanding at that time that this\r\nwas done by a tracheotomy.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What else, if anything, of importance did you do between\r\nthe time you viewed the body in the morgue until the termination of\r\nyour duties on that date, Mr. Hill?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. We handled all communications on the 17th floor, up to the\r\n17th floor, for Mrs. Kennedy, members of her family, Cabinet members\r\nwho were there at that time, and secured the 17th floor for all\r\npersonnel. No one was permitted there that we did not know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time did you leave the 17th floor?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I believe, sir, it was 3:56, but I am not sure of the exact\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where did you go from there?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. We went downstairs to the rear of the hospital, where\r\nthe body was placed in a naval ambulance. I entered an automobile\r\nimmediately behind the ambulance. Mrs. Kennedy and the Attorney General\r\ngot into the rear of the ambulance with the body.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And from there, where did you go?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. I accompanied them to the White House.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did that mark the termination of your duties for that\r\nday?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. No, sir. I remained on duty until approximately 6:30 in the\r\nmorning; went home, changed clothes, and came back.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I believe you testified as to the impression you had as to\r\nthe source of the first shot. To be sure that the record is complete,\r\nwhat was your reaction as to where the first shot came from, Mr. Hill?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Right rear.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you have a reaction or impression as to the source\r\nof point of origin of the second shot that you described?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. It was right, but I cannot say for sure that it was rear,\r\nbecause when I mounted the car it was--it had a different sound, first\r\nof all, than the first sound that I heard. The second one had almost a\r\ndouble sound--as though you were standing against something metal and\r\nfiring into it, and you hear both the sound of a gun going off and the\r\nsound of the cartridge hitting the metal place, which could have been\r\ncaused probably by the hard surface of the head. But I am not sure that\r\nthat is what caused it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you describing this double sound with respect to what\r\nyou heard on the occasion of the second shot?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. The second shot that I heard; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, do you now or have you ever had the impression or\r\nreaction that there was a shot which originated from the front of the\r\nPresidential car?\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That is all I have.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Congressman Ford, any questions you would like to ask?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. I have no questions, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Craig.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. If not, thank you very much. We appreciate your coming.\r\n\r\nMr. HILL. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Youngblood, will you raise your right hand? Do you\r\nsolemnly swear the testimony you will give before this Commission will\r\nbe the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you\r\nGod?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I do, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Be seated, please.\r\n\r\nMr. Specter will conduct the examination.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF RUFUS WAYNE YOUNGBLOOD, SPECIAL AGENT, SECRET SERVICE\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Rufus Wayne Youngblood.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How old are you, Mr. Youngblood?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Forty.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And by whom are you employed?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. The U.S. Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long have you been so employed?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Since March of 1951.\r\n\r\nMrs. SPECTER. What is your educational background, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I graduated from Georgia Institute of Technology.\r\nBachelor of Industrial Engineering.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In what year?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. 1949.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How were you occupied from termination of your college\r\nwork until starting with the Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I worked for Bradshaws, Inc., which was a refrigeration\r\nand air-conditioning concern in Waycross, Ga., and then worked for\r\nAlvin Lindstrom, who is a consulting mechanical engineer in Atlanta, Ga.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And would you outline in general terms what your duties\r\nhave been with the Secret Service since the time you joined them?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I began in the Secret Service as a special agent,\r\ncriminal investigator, and started off at the Atlanta field office,\r\nand stayed there about a year and a half. This time was spent\r\nin investigation of Government forged check cases, bond cases,\r\ncounterfeiting, and similar investigations.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Chief Justice Warren withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I came to the Washington, DC. area, and worked in the\r\nWashington field office, a continuation of the same type of work I had\r\ndone in Atlanta, plus the beginning of the protective work, working\r\non temporary assignment at the White House detail. And then in 1953\r\nI was assigned to the White House detail and worked there during the\r\nEisenhower Administration about 6 years, and returned to the Atlanta\r\nfield office for 3 more years in that area, during which time President\r\nEisenhower would come to Augusta and Albany, and on two occasions on\r\nforeign trips I was called in.\r\n\r\nAnd after 3 years in that field office, I returned to Washington again,\r\nassigned to the White House detail. The last part of the Eisenhower\r\nAdministration and the beginning of the Kennedy Administration.\r\n\r\nAnd in March of 1961, I was assigned to the Vice-Presidential detail.\r\nThis, at that time, was part of the Washington field office. And I have\r\nbeen on an assignment with the Vice-Presidential detail since March\r\n1961, except for a 1-month period when I returned to the White House\r\ndetail. And then back to the Vice-Presidential detail.\r\n\r\nBut during this time, the Vice-Presidential detail changed from a\r\nfield office assignment to a small independent office, and then,\r\nlater, in October of 1962, when legislation was passed, changing\r\nthe laws relative to protection of the Vice President, it became a\r\nlarger detail. And I have been on the Vice-Presidential detail in the\r\noccurrence at Dallas, and returned to the White House detail when Mr.\r\nJohnson became the President.\r\n\r\nAnd during this period of time, I have been a special agent, assistant\r\nspecial agent in charge, and was scheduled to be the special agent in\r\ncharge of the Vice-Presidential detail. But due to what occurred in\r\nDallas, I went to the White House as an assistant special agent in\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nAny other particulars?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, what was your rank at the time of the Dallas trip,\r\nspecifically on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I was the assistant special agent in charge of the\r\nVice-Presidential detail.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Chief Justice Warren entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And as such, were you responsible for the security of the\r\nVice President on that trip?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, what is your current rank?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Assistant special agent in charge of the White House\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, as such, do you hold one of the three positions of\r\nthe assistant special agent in charge at the White House detail?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is that a rank comparable or exactly the same as that\r\nnow held by Special Agent Kellerman?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Yes, sir; he is senior to me, but it is a comparable\r\nrank.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, would you outline briefly and in general terms the\r\nactivities of Vice President Johnson during the few days immediately\r\nbefore Friday, November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. On Tuesday of that week we made a trip from the ranch\r\nto Dallas, and we went by commercial plane--actually, from the ranch\r\nto Austin in the Vice President's plane, and from Austin to Dallas on\r\na commercial plane. And while in Dallas, he addressed the Bottlers\r\nConvention. And we returned to the plane, flew back to Austin, then\r\nflew back to the ranch later that night, and remained at the ranch the\r\nnext day and through Thursday.\r\n\r\nAnd on Thursday we went to San Antonio, to join the group coming down\r\nfrom Washington.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, when did Vice President Johnson then address the\r\nBottlers Association in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. That was on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. November 19?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I would have to look at a calendar.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The preceding Tuesday----\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. The preceding Tuesday before the 22d; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, outline in a general way Vice President Johnson's\r\nactivities on the morning of November 22d, before he arrived in Dallas,\r\nif you would, please.\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Well, our day began at the hotel in Fort Worth, where\r\nwe had stayed overnight. And that morning we went down to a mezzanine\r\nfloor where we met with President Kennedy and a group of White House\r\npeople. We went across from this hotel to a parking lot across the\r\nstreet, and they had a speaker stand there, and they addressed an\r\nassembled gathering.\r\n\r\nThen they returned to the hotel, and there was a breakfast meeting in\r\nthe hotel. They attended that. And, after that, we formed a motorcade\r\nand went to the field nearby in Fort Worth and boarded Air Force 2, and\r\nflew into Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately what time did the Vice Presidential plane\r\narrive in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. About 11:35.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, will you tell the Commission in general terms what\r\nVice President Johnson did upon arrival at the Love Field?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. All right, sir.\r\n\r\nThis plane, Air Force 2, had on board the Vice President and Mrs.\r\nJohnson and other officials. And we disembarked from the plane and were\r\nmet by a welcoming committee composed of local dignitaries. And then we\r\nmoved from that area where we disembarked over to the area of the ramp,\r\nwhich would be pushed out when Air Force 1, the President's plane,\r\narrived. And when his plane did arrive, which was just a few minutes\r\nafter ours, roughly 10 minutes, we went out to the foot of the ramp and\r\nVice President Johnson and Mrs. Johnson headed the reception committee\r\nto greet the people who came off of Air Force 1.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately how long did the activities in greeting the\r\ncrowd and the general reception last at Love Field on that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Do you mean from the time we arrived on Air Force 2\r\nuntil we left?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I think it was about 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, in what position in the motorcade was Vice President\r\nJohnson's automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. We were following the Presidential followup car, and\r\nthe motorcade up to our point--there was a lead car, the President's\r\ncar, the Presidential followup car, and then our car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there, to your knowledge, in advance of the lead car a\r\ncar known as the pilot car?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Yes, sir; in all probability. This is a normal police\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And would you identify the occupants of Vice President\r\nJohnson's car, indicating the positions in the car of each individual?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. All right, sir. The driver of this car was Hurchel\r\nJacks, and he is with the State Highway Patrol. And behind him was\r\nSenator Ralph Yarborough, from Texas. And in the middle back seat was\r\nMrs. Johnson. And on the right-hand side of the back seat, behind me,\r\nwas the Vice President. And I was in the front seat on the right-hand\r\nside.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what kind of an automobile was it?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. This was a Lincoln convertible, a four-door convertible.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is this a specially constructed automobile, or was it\r\nobtained locally for use during this trip?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. It was obtained locally for use during the trip.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what car immediately followed the Vice President's\r\nautomobile?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. The Vice Presidential detail had a followup car which\r\nfollowed our car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What kind of an automobile was that?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. It was either a Lincoln or a Mercury, I don't know the\r\nexact make. It was a Ford product, and it was a four-door car. But it\r\nwas closed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you identify the occupants of that car, stating where\r\neach sat?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. The front seat, the driver, I think his name is Rich.\r\nHe is always on the Texas Highway Patrol. In the front seat in the\r\nmiddle is Cliff Carter. He is an assistant to the Vice President's\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Boggs withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. On the right-front side was Jerry Kivett. He is one\r\nof the agents on the Vice Presidential detail. And in the back seat,\r\nbehind the driver, was Warren Taylor, and in the back seat on the other\r\nside was my agent, Lem Johns.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know how many cars there were in the balance of the\r\nmotorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the maximum speed at which the motorcade\r\nproceeded from Love Field down to the downtown area of Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I doubt if the motorcade ever exceeded 20 miles or 25\r\nmiles an hour, and most of the time it was going slower than that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the minimum speed, would you estimate, during\r\nthat time?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. We actually came to stops during this time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many stops?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. More than one. Two or more.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What occurred during the course of those stops, or what\r\nprompted them?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Well, these stops were made by the Presidential car\r\nto greet well-wishers, students on one particular occasion, and other\r\ngroups of well-wishers, that were assembled along the streets.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Vice President Johnson greet anyone at those stops?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. He did greet them, but he didn't leave the car, I\r\nthink. He remained in the car. I got out of the car and stood by the\r\nside of it on more than one occasion. He waved at people, and some did\r\nrun over, and I think he did touch some. But he didn't leave the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How far behind the President's followup car did the Vice\r\nPresident's followup car drive?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. The Vice President's followup car?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Pardon me--the Vice President's automobile.\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. We usually stayed on motorcades like this about two or\r\nthree car lengths behind.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did your distance on this occasion conform to your\r\ncustomary practice of being that distance behind?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is the reason, if any, for staying that distance\r\nbehind the President's followup car?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Well, mainly so the crowd can see the Vice President,\r\nand he can see them. If you are too close behind the Presidential\r\ngroup, the crowd will be watching the President and will watch him\r\nas he goes by, and then they will miss the next man. So it gives the\r\npeople a chance to recover and look back and see him, and they to see\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I show you a photograph which has been marked as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 354, and ask you if you are able to identify\r\nwhat that is a picture of.\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what does that depict?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Well, it is a picture showing the main street, Houston\r\nStreet and Elm Street, and the assassination occurred on Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you familiar at this time with the identities of Main,\r\nHouston, and Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Yes, sir; when I have a map such as this ahead of me.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. How far behind the President's automobile was\r\nthe Vice President's automobile in which you were riding when the Vice\r\nPresident's automobile turned right off of Main Street onto Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. You ask again how far were we behind the President's\r\ncar? Did you mean, sir, how far were we behind the Presidential\r\nfollowup car?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. No; I meant the President's car on that occasion.\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Well, we were a distance of about two car lengths\r\nbehind the followup car, and they were probably one car length behind\r\nthe Presidential car. But this would be a guess on my part.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the situation with respect to the crowd which was\r\nlined up on Houston and Elm as you approached that intersection?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. On Houston Street, on the side where the tall building\r\nis, the crowd was still somewhat continuous. On the side which is the\r\npark side, the crowd was smaller. They did have some people there, but\r\nit wasn't continuous in the same way it was on the building side.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate of the speed of the Vice\r\nPresident's car as you proceeded down Houston Street toward Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Well, our speed, of course, was governed by the\r\nvehicles in front of us, but I would say we had just made one turn, and\r\nit was only a block there before we would make another turn. It was\r\napproximately 10 miles an hour, between 10 and 15.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I show you a photograph which has been marked as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 348, and I ask you if you are now able to\r\nidentify what that building is?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Yes, sir; I am now able to identify it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is that building, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. That is the School Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where, as best you can recollect, was the Vice President's\r\ncar at the time the first shots were heard? And would you take\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 354 and take the red pencil and mark as closely\r\nas you can the exact position on Commission Exhibit 354 of the Vice\r\nPresident's car with the capital letter \"A\" there?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. At the time of the first shot, did you say?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. It will be in this area here, I should think.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I want the Vice President's car at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Well, this is what I am attempting to locate. It would\r\nbe in the vicinity of this \"X\" right here, I do believe.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Now, will you describe----\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Excuse me. You said put an \"A\" here?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, please. Will you describe just what occurred as the\r\nmotorcade proceeded past the intersection of Houston and Elm Streets?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Well, the crowd had begun to diminish, looking ahead\r\nand to the right the crowd became spotty. I mean it wasn't continuous\r\nat all, like it had been. As we were beginning to go down this incline,\r\nall of a sudden there was an explosive noise. I quickly observed\r\nunnatural movement of crowds, like ducking or scattering, and quick\r\nmovements in the Presidential followup car. So I turned around and hit\r\nthe Vice President on the shoulder and hollered, get down, and then\r\nlooked around again and saw more of this movement, and so I proceeded\r\nto go to the back seat and get on top of him.\r\n\r\nI then heard two more shots. But I would like to say this. I would not\r\nbe positive that I was back on that back seat before the second shot.\r\nBut the Vice President himself said I was. But--then in hearing these\r\ntwo more shots, I again had seen more movement, and I think someone\r\nelse hit a siren--I heard the noise of a siren.\r\n\r\nI told the driver to close it up, and stick close to that car in front.\r\nAnd right away we started a hasty evacuation speed, and left this\r\nimmediate area, and we were following close behind. And I had a radio\r\nwhich was on a Baker frequency, where I could communicate back with the\r\nagents in my followup car. And they had a Charlie frequency, which was\r\non the same network of the Presidential motorcade. And I called back\r\nand said I am switching to Baker frequency--I said, \"I am switching to\r\nCharlie.\" And as I switched, I heard some transmission over the Charlie\r\nsets saying for me to keep my man covered, and I heard Kivett reply to\r\nEmory Roberts that he was covered, and I saw agents in the followup\r\ncar, the Presidential followup car signaling us to stay close. I asked\r\nthe driver what his opinion was as to--I don't know for exact sure\r\njust where we were going, but I knew our best protection was to stay\r\nwith that Presidential followup crew. And I asked the driver if he had\r\npassed the Trade Mart. He said he passed it and we were going on to the\r\nhospital. And I heard indications over the radio that we were going to\r\nthe hospital. We had a very fast ride there.\r\n\r\nI told the driver to go as fast as he could without having a wreck.\r\nThere was some conversation between the Vice President and myself\r\nwhile we were going to the hospital. I told him that I didn't know\r\nhow serious it was up in the front car, but when we arrived at the\r\nhospital, I would like to get out of the car and go into the building\r\nand not stop, and for him to stay close to myself and the other agents.\r\nHe agreed to.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the hospital, we immediately went right in. As we\r\nstopped at the hospital, two of my agents from the Vice Presidential\r\ncar, followup car, were coming up to meet us, and two from the\r\nPresidential followup were coming to meet us, and, with this group, we\r\nproceeded into the hospital and then went into a room. I posted one\r\nman at the door and said, not to let anyone in unless he knew him, was\r\ncertain of his identity.\r\n\r\nI told Jerry Kivett and Warren Taylor to pull all the shades and\r\nblinds, which they did. And they also busied themselves with evacuating\r\na couple of people out of there. There was a nurse and a patient in\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Before you go on, Mr. Youngblood, let me drop back and\r\npick up a few of the details theretofore.\r\n\r\nWhat would your best estimate be of the speed of the Vice President's\r\ncar at the time you heard that first explosive noise?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Oh, approximately 12 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And had you maintained the distance which you have\r\ndescribed heretofore behind the President's followup car?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Yes, generally. Sometimes as we went around corners,\r\nwe tried to close up the gap a little bit. But as soon as we got on a\r\nstraight stretch, we would drop back two or three car lengths.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, at this particular time, what is your best\r\nrecollection of the distance between the Presidential followup car and\r\nthe Vice President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. We are on Elm Street now.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At the time the first shot occurred.\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. We were two or three car lengths behind.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how far behind the President's car was the\r\nPresidential followup car at the time of the first shot?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I would think somewhat less than a car length.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate of the total timespan between\r\nthe first and third shots which you have already described?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. From the beginning to the last?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I would think 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And you have described the first shot as being an\r\nexplosive noise. How would you describe each of the second and third\r\nshots?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Well, there wasn't too much difference in the noise\r\nof the first shot and the last two. I am not really sure that there\r\nwas a difference. But in my mind, I think I identified the last two\r\npositively as shots, whereas the first one I thought was just an\r\nexplosive noise, and I didn't know whether it was a firecracker or a\r\nshot. It seems, as I try to think over it, there was more of a crack\r\nsound to the last two shots. That may have been distance, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, as to time interval--was there longer or less time or\r\nthe same between the first and second shots and the second and third\r\nshots?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. There seemed to be a longer span of time between the\r\nfirst and the second shot than there was between the second and third\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, did you have any reaction or impression as to the\r\nsource or point of origin of the first shot?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I didn't know where the source or the point of origin\r\nwas, of course, but the sounds all came to my right and rear.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, how about as to the latter two shots, would the same\r\napply, or would there be a different situation there?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. No; all of them seemed to sound that they were from the\r\nright.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did they sound on the surface or in the air or\r\ncouldn't you discern?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I couldn't say for certain. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, did you then or have you ever had any contrary\r\nimpression that the shots might have come from in front as opposed to\r\nthe rear of the automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, you say that you hit the Vice President's shoulder,\r\nand at that time you were indicating your left hand, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which hand did you use in hitting the Vice President's\r\nshoulder?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. My left, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And which shoulder of the Vice President did you hit?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. His right, because I turned this way. I turned to my\r\nleft, with the hand out, and then came into his right shoulder.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when you moved from the front to the rear seat, would\r\nyou describe in as much detail as you can your relative position with\r\nrespect to the position of President Johnson's body?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Well, the Vice President says that I vaulted over. It\r\nwas more of a stepping over. And then I sat on top of him, he being\r\ncrouched down somewhat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating towards the left?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. He moved towards the center, or towards his left, yes,\r\nsir, and down. And then I sat on this portion of his arm here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating the right upper portion of the arm from elbow\r\nto the shoulder?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Yes, sir; generally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what were the positions of the other occupants of the\r\nback seat at the time you sat on the Vice President?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Mrs. Johnson more or less moved into a forward--just\r\nmoved forward. And Senator Yarborough also moved forward, and possibly\r\nhe moved over a little to the right. I am not sure. But we were all\r\nbelow the window level of the car. And those two generally were\r\nforward. But the Vice President was forward and a little to his left.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In what direction did you look when you were first sitting\r\non the Vice President?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. In what direction did I look?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Almost all directions.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have a reaction with respect to looking in the\r\ndirection from which you thought the danger was emanating?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I think I first looked to the right--but to the right,\r\nforward, up, as much as I could scan, and also the people in the\r\nPresidential followup car. Because I recall seeing at the time one of\r\nour agents, Hickey, who was in the Presidential followup car, in almost\r\na standing position with an AR-15 looking back and up.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you able to fix the precise time of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I would say 12:30. I was to keep the times. The Vice\r\nPresident was asking me if we were running on time, and so forth. And\r\nso he asked me how much further, and I would call back to our followup\r\ncar and ask them how many more miles and so forth.\r\n\r\nSo, for this reason, I was at that time keeping up with the time very\r\nclosely. And when we turned the corner, I noticed an illuminated clock\r\nsign on this building, which I now know is the School Book Depository\r\nBuilding. And that clock indicated 12:30. And the reason it is\r\nsignificant is because this was the time we were supposed to arrive at\r\nthe Trade Mart.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. As you looked at the school depository building,\r\nand noticed this clock, where is the clock? Can you identify it?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. This, right here.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It is on top of the roof?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Yes, sir; right up here.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And this is after you turned from Main Street on\r\nto Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. We were on Houston Street--just as soon as we got on\r\nHouston Street. And I looked up and I saw it there.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you notice anything else on the building as\r\nyou scanned it from the top down, or from the bottom up?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I noticed open windows, and some people, I think. But I\r\ndidn't notice this particular window.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You saw nothing unusual in any of the open windows\r\nthat you noticed?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Well, sir, all through the day here we had been passing\r\nbuildings with windows and people. And that I saw. But I saw nothing\r\nunusual.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Youngblood, what is your best estimate as to the time\r\nit took to get to Parkland Hospital after the shooting occurred?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I believe it was between 5 and 8 minutes, something of\r\nthat nature.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at what speed did your automobile proceed, based on\r\nyour best estimate, en route from the shooting to Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I believe we were going around 60 or 70 miles an hour\r\nat times.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, did you observe President Kennedy or Governor\r\nConnally being removed from the President's automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. No, sir; because I had--as I mentioned before--I had\r\ntold the Vice President, or suggested to the Vice President that we did\r\nnot want to linger, and get into the building as quickly as we could,\r\nand we would find out the condition of the other party after we got\r\ninto a safe place.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had they already been taken in by the time you arrived at\r\nthe scene?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. No, sir; I don't hardly see how they could have been,\r\nbecause we arrived almost simultaneously with them. It was just a\r\nmatter of opening the door and getting out of the car and hastily\r\nwalking right on past. I think they were in the act of removing these\r\npeople, but I don't think they would have had time to have removed them.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you enter the emergency entrance as well?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, I interrupted you before when you were describing the\r\nsecurity arrangements which you were making on the room to which you\r\ntook the Vice President. Would you continue and describe for us what\r\noccurred thereafter?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. At what point?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I interrupted you. You were in the room, you had pulled\r\nthe shades down, and were making security arrangements for the Vice\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Well, we were in a corner of this room, and there was\r\nthe Vice President, Mrs. Johnson, and myself at first, with agents\r\nKivett and Warren Taylor also in the big room, but not right over in\r\nthe corner at the beginning. And shortly thereafter Emory Roberts came\r\nin. He was one of the White House detail agents. He told us that the\r\nsituation--situation with President Kennedy looked very bad. The Vice\r\nPresident asked me what I thought--what we should do. And I said I\r\nthink we should evacuate the hospital as soon as we can, and get on\r\nthe plane, and return to Washington. And Emory Roberts concurred. And\r\nthe Vice President agreed. But he wanted to get a better report on the\r\ncondition and so forth.\r\n\r\nThen we were joined by many others. Congressman Homer Thornberry came\r\nin, and Congressman Brooks, and Cliff Carter, and the Vice President\r\nhad some conversations with these gentlemen. And at one time Cliff\r\nwent out and got coffee. And then Mr. Ken O'Donnell and Roy Kellerman\r\ncame down on one occasion, and Ken O'Donnell said for us to return to\r\nWashington, and to go ahead and take the President's plane.\r\n\r\nThe Vice President was worried about Mrs. Kennedy. So Mrs. Johnson\r\nthought that she would go see Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Connally. She did.\r\nAgents Kivett and Taylor went with her. Then later, after she came\r\nback, Ken O'Donnell and Roy Kellerman came down again and told us that\r\nthe President had died.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. About what time was that, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I don't know. I had told Lem Johns to try to keep up\r\nwith all the times. I think it is a matter of record. I believe you\r\nhave it in other documents.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, are you referring to a document which I will mark as\r\nCommission Exhibit 355?\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 355 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. This is our shift report, and this is the times that\r\nLem Johns was keeping that day. He shows 1 p.m., President Kennedy died\r\nat Parkland Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that daily shift report prepared under your\r\nsupervision, Mr. Youngblood?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you review it and approve it when it was completed,\r\nafter the end of the workday on November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Well, not exactly at the end of the workday, sir. These\r\nagents would keep notes. And in this particular case you can see that\r\nthis one, it says, \"Date completed, December 2\" down at the bottom.\r\nThat is when he got around to typing it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, does this document bear your initial in any place?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Yes, sir; up at the top. The \"RYW\" is my initials.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And does that signify your approval shortly after\r\ncompletion of the document?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Would you go ahead and tell us what your\r\nactivities were from the time you had learned that the President had\r\ndied?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Well, when Mr. O'Donnell and Roy Kellerman told us that\r\nhe had died, the Vice President said, \"Well, how about Mrs. Kennedy?\"\r\n\r\nO'Donnell told the Vice President that Mrs. Kennedy would not leave the\r\nhospital without the President's body. And O'Donnell suggested we go\r\nto the plane and that they just come on the other plane. And I might\r\nadd that, as a word of explanation, there were two jet planes, one Air\r\nForce 1, in which the President flew, and the other Air Force 2, in\r\nwhich the Vice President and his party flew on. And O'Donnell told us\r\nto go ahead and take Air Force 1. I believe this is mainly because Air\r\nForce 1 has better communications equipment and so forth than the other\r\nplanes.\r\n\r\nPresident Johnson said that he didn't want to go off and leave Mrs.\r\nKennedy in such a state. And so he agreed that we would go on to the\r\nairplane and board the plane and wait until Mrs. Kennedy and the body\r\nwould come out. Shall I go on?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes. Proceed. Did you then depart from Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Yes, sir; previous to all of this, I had Johns, my\r\nagent, line up some unmarked police cars so that they would be ready\r\nwhen we did decide to evacuate the hospital.\r\n\r\nSo we left the room and proceeded out to these cars. The car that\r\nwe went in was driven by Chief Curry, the Dallas Police Chief, and\r\nCongressman Thornberry was in the front seat, and the Vice President\r\nand I were in the back seat. And I had told the Vice President before\r\nwe left the room that I would prefer that he stay below window level,\r\nand stay close with me as we went out, and that I would also prefer\r\nMrs. Johnson to go in another car, but she would be accompanied by\r\nagents. And Mrs. Johnson did get in a second car. She was accompanied\r\nby Warren Taylor and Jerry Kivett and Congressman Brooks, and also Glen\r\nBennett, another agent from the White House.\r\n\r\nAnd as we started to leave the hospital area, that is drive away,\r\njust as we started away, Congressman Thomas saw us leaving--I imagine\r\nhe saw Congressman Thornberry, and he said, \"Wait for me.\" I don't\r\nthink he saw the Vice President. And I told the driver to continue. I\r\ndidn't want to stop there in front of the hospital. But by this time\r\nCongressman Thomas was right over at the side of the car, and the Vice\r\nPresident said, \"Stop and let him get in.\"\r\n\r\nSo he got in in the front seat with Congressman Thornberry, having\r\nCongressman Thornberry move over closer to the driver. And then we\r\nstarted out again. This probably takes longer to tell about it than it\r\nactually took. It was about a 30-second stop.\r\n\r\nWe started out again, and the Vice President asked Congressman\r\nThornberry to climb on over and get in the back seat, which he did,\r\nwhile the car was in motion. And then that put Congressman Thornberry\r\nbehind the driver, and on the Vice President's left, and I was on his\r\nright.\r\n\r\nAnd we continued on our way. We were momentarily stopped as we were\r\nleaving the hospital on this access road. There was a truck or delivery\r\nor something coming in there. We were stopped for one moment. But then\r\nthe police got us on through, and we went on out to the main roads, and\r\nwe were getting a motorcycle escort.\r\n\r\nAnd they started using the sirens, and the Vice President and I both\r\nasked Chief Curry to discontinue the use of sirens, that we didn't want\r\nto attract attention. We were going on an unscheduled different route.\r\nWe were not using any particular route. But in telling Lem Johns to get\r\na car available, I told him to be sure and get a local driver who knew\r\nthe area, a local policeman who could take us any route that we needed\r\nto go, and knew all the areas of evacuation and so forth.\r\n\r\nSo we went on to the airport. But we did have him stop using the\r\nsirens. And just before arriving at the airport, I called on the radio\r\nand told Air Force 1 to be ready to receive us, that we would be coming\r\non board immediately. We arrived there and ran up the ramp onto the\r\nplane.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how long after that did the swearing-in ceremonies\r\noccur? Approximately?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I would say in the neighborhood of about 40 or 45\r\nminutes after that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long after the arrival of the Vice President on the\r\nplane did the party of the late President Kennedy and Mrs. Kennedy\r\narrive at the plane?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Approximately--after we got on the plane, I would say\r\nit was approximately 30 or 35 minutes before Mrs. Kennedy and that\r\nparty arrived.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how long after the swearing-in ceremonies did the\r\nplane take off for the Washington area?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. After the swearing-in ceremonies, it took off\r\nimmediately. It was just a matter of letting the people who had to get\r\noff the plane, such as Judge Hughes and Chief Curry disembark, and as\r\nsoon as they had disembarked, we closed the door and started taxiing\r\nout.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there any conversations between Vice President\r\nJohnson and anyone else with respect to advice on the swearing-in\r\nceremonies?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Yes, sir. I think probably the first thing the Vice\r\nPresident did after he got on board the plane was to place a call to\r\nthe Attorney General. In fact, he talked to the Attorney General, I\r\nbelieve, two times--at least two times.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you present when those conversations occurred?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I was present when he placed the first call. I think he\r\nplaced the first call from the bedroom there of the plane. Then someone\r\nfrom the Attorney General's office called back--not the Attorney\r\nGeneral, but someone from the office--and gave the wording of the oath.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you informed as to what advice Vice President Johnson\r\nreceived from Mr. Kennedy with respect to the time of swearing in?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. I heard him discussing this--because after we got on\r\nboard the plane I told them to pull down the shades, and then I told\r\nthe Vice President, I am going to stick with you like glue while we\r\nare on the ground here. And so we were joined by Mrs. Johnson and then\r\nby Congressman Thornberry and Thomas, and Congressman Brooks. And I\r\nheard them discussing about taking the oath immediately, right there in\r\nDallas. I heard the Vice President ask about anyone in particular that\r\nshould administer the oath. And as I gathered from conversation, it was\r\nanyone who was authorized to administer a Federal oath. And then he put\r\nin calls to Judge Hughes, and he told me to expect Judge Hughes and to\r\nbe sure she could get through the security lines.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, were you informed that Attorney General Kennedy\r\nadvised Vice President Johnson that he should have himself sworn in as\r\npromptly as possible?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Well, as I said, I was in the area, in their immediate\r\nvicinity, when they were talking about it. And this is what I gathered\r\nfrom hearing them talk--that the Attorney General had told him to go\r\nahead and be sworn in there, as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And upon arrival back in Andrews Air Force Base, what\r\nactivity, if any, were you engaged in then, along with President\r\nJohnson?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Well, on the plane, on the flight up here, there had\r\nbeen numerous radio contacts in making arrangements and so forth. But\r\nwhen we actually arrived, Mrs. Kennedy and the body were removed first\r\nby the lift that was provided, and then when the ramp was in place,\r\nour party disembarked from the plane, and then President Johnson had a\r\nshort statement that he was to make, and we went over to an area where\r\nthe microphones were set up, and he made this brief statement. And then\r\nwe proceeded from there to the awaiting helicopter, which was just a\r\nfew yards away. We boarded the helicopter and flew in to the south\r\ngrounds of the White House.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you then accompany President Johnson to his home?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. He didn't go to his home at that time; but the answer\r\nto your question is yes, when he did go later that night. You see,\r\nhe went to his office in the EOB, the Executive Office Building, and\r\nconducted business there until in the vicinity of 9 o'clock. And then\r\nhe went home, at which time I accompanied him, and many other agents.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe briefly what security arrangements if\r\nany were instituted on that day for the Vice President's daughters?\r\n\r\nMr. YOUNGBLOOD. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nWhile we were in the hospital, receiving these reports relative to\r\nPresident Kennedy's condition, I asked Mrs. Johnson--I knew generally\r\nwhere Luci and Lynda were, but I wanted to get the very latest from\r\nher, since sometimes these girls might visit a friend or a relative.\r\nAnd I knew that Lynda was going to the University of Texas, and that\r\nLuci was going to National Cathedral. So I confirmed the locations with\r\nMrs. Johnson and then told Agent Kivett, who was in our presence at the\r\ntime I was talking to her, to make the necessary calls to have Secret\r\nService protection placed around Lynda and Luci. And Agent Kivett made\r\nthese calls and then came back and reported to me that Lockwood, from\r\nAustin, who is in the San Antonio office, but he was in Austin at the\r\ntime, had proceeded to the University of Texas to get Lynda, and that\r\nan agent from the Washington field office would go out and get Luci at\r\nthe school.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, I move for the admission into evidence\r\nof Commission Exhibits No. 354, which is a reproduction of the overhead\r\nshot, and 355, which is a reproduction of the Vice Presidential detail\r\nschedules.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. They may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The documents heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibits Nos. 354 and 355, were received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That concludes my questions, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Craig, any questions?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. MURRAY. I have no questions, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Well, Agent Youngblood, thank you very much for coming\r\nand testifying. We appreciate it.\r\n\r\nWe will adjourn now. We will adjourn until 9 in the morning.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 6:20 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, March 10, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF ROBERT HILL JACKSON, ARNOLD LOUIS ROWLAND, JAMES RICHARD\r\nWORRELL, JR., AND AMOS LEE EUINS\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 9:15 a.m. on March 10, 1964 at 200\r\nMaryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Sherman\r\nCooper and Representative Gerald R. Ford, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present were Joseph A. Ball, assistant counsel; David W. Belin,\r\nassistant counsel; Norman Redlich, assistant counsel; Arlen Specter,\r\nassistant counsel; and Edward L. Wright, Chairman, House of Delegates,\r\nAmerican Bar Association.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF ROBERT HILL JACKSON\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right, gentlemen, are we ready? Would you raise your\r\nright hand and be sworn, Mr. Jackson? Do you solemnly swear to tell the\r\ntruth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Will you be seated, please.\r\n\r\nMr. Specter will conduct the examination.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you state----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. First, I will read a very small short statement for the\r\nrecord. The purpose of this day's hearing is to hear the testimony\r\nof Arnold Louis Rowland, Amos Lee Euins, James Richard Worrell, and\r\nRobert H. Jackson, who were in the vicinity of the assassination scene\r\non November 22, 1963. The Commission proposes to ask these witnesses\r\nfor facts concerning their knowledge of the assassination of President\r\nKennedy.\r\n\r\nYou have seen a copy of this, have you, Mr. Jackson?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well, you may proceed, Mr. Specter.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Robert Hill Jackson.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your address, Mr. Jackson?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. 4030 Sperry.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What city is that located in?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long have you lived at that address, please?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Since September of 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And of what State are you a native?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I am a native of Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you lived in Dallas all your life?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your occupation at the present time?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Staff photographer for the Dallas Times Herald.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long have you been so employed?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Since August of 1960.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you outline for us briefly----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. 1950 or 1960?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. 1960.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you outline for us briefly your educational\r\nbackground, please?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I attended Highland Park High School and then Southern\r\nMethodist University, where I studied for a business degree, and I did\r\nnot finish. I lack about 8 hours of finishing, of getting a degree.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What year did you leave the university?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. 1957.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How were you occupied between the time you left the\r\nuniversity and the time you started to work for the newspaper?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I did some freelance photography work for a while, over\r\na year, until I went into the service on the 6 month's plan through\r\nmy National Guard unit, and I was a photographer there in the Army,\r\non-the-job training, and then after I was released from the Army I did\r\nfreelance work, I guess for about a year, until I got the job at the\r\nHerald.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How old are you at the present time?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Twenty-nine.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your marital status?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I am married.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have children?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. One child. One girl 15 months today.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Going back to November 22, 1963, by whom were you employed\r\nat that time?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Dallas Times Herald.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was your assignment on that specific day?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I was assigned to the motorcade to meet the President,\r\nLove Field, and go to the Trade Mart and that was the extent of it,\r\ncover the parade, I mean the motorcade and the speech.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you assigned to take pictures?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. To take pictures, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you meet the President at Love Field?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you take photographs for your newspaper at Love\r\nField?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Describe briefly your activities at Love Field on the\r\nmorning of November 22, please.\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Well, we got there, I guess, 30, 40 minutes early.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At about what time would that have been?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I have to think to remember exactly what time, around 9,\r\nI guess, 9 to 9:15, I believe. And I took pictures there. There were\r\nother photographers from our paper there, our chief photographer. And\r\nwe just took shots of the crowd, and waited for the President to arrive.\r\n\r\nAnd then when he did arrive, our chief photographer left and went\r\ndirectly to the Trade Mart and I got into the motorcade to ride to town.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know exactly which car you were in in the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. We counted up, and it is either the seventh or eighth car.\r\nWe said eighth car from the President, from the lead car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say we counted up, whom do you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. The photographers in the car. As we left Love Field, we\r\nwere trying to figure how far back we were and we all decided it was\r\nthe eighth car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you reconstruct that count for us which provided the\r\nbasis for your conclusion that you were in the seventh or eighth car.\r\nFor example, how many cars ahead of you was the President's car or the\r\nVice President's car, if you can recollect, please.\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Let me think a minute. I know there was a photographer's\r\ncar directly in front of us which I believe had some of the local\r\npress. It was a convertible. Then in front were, I believe, two\r\nor three cars carrying the press, the White House press, and then\r\nPresident Johnson, I guess would be in the next car, and then the\r\nPresident in the lead car, or the next car, and I believe there was\r\nanother car in the lead.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So as you recollect the scene there was the lead and\r\nimmediately behind the lead car, whose car?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. The President's, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And then immediately behind the President's whose car?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. The Vice President's.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And immediately to the rear of the Vice President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Press vehicles and I was told it was the White House\r\npress, two or three cars.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And then there was one car filled with photographers?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Directly in front of us.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Between your car and the cars which you believe to have\r\nbeen filled with White House newsmen?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Wasn't there a Secret Service car directly behind the\r\nPresident's car?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Between it and the Vice President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir; that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Wasn't there a Secret Service car immediately behind the\r\nVice President's car, if you know?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. There must have been. That is what I can't recall is which\r\nwas which in there. I knew the White House press was in there but I\r\ndidn't know how many cars. I am sure there were Secret Service cars,\r\nyes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As you were proceeding along in the motorcade, were you\r\nwithin sight of the President's automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. At times. When he was--when we could not get a clear view\r\nof it because of the photographers in the car ahead of us who were\r\nsitting up on the back of the seat just like we were, we did not have a\r\nclear view of the car at all times.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As you proceeded along approximately how far behind the\r\nPresident's car were you, expressed either in cars, block lengths or in\r\nany way that is convenient for you?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Well, I would say approximately a block, average city\r\nblock, maybe closer at times.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Jackson, I show you a photograph which has been marked\r\nheretofore as Commission Exhibit No. 347, and ask you to look at it for\r\na moment, and see if you can identify what that photograph depicts.\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir; this is the scene of the assassination, parade\r\nroute, Main and Houston, left on Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, which street did the Presidential motorcade take\r\ncoming on to that scene which you have described as the assassination\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. They were on Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And before Houston what street were they on?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Main Street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What direction were they proceeding on Main Street?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. West.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now without reference to the photograph, will you tell us\r\nwhat happened as the motorcade proceeded west on Main Street?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Well, on Main, as we neared Houston Street everyone was\r\nmore or less in a relaxed state in our car, because we were near the\r\nend of the route, I guess, nothing unusual happened on Main Street.\r\n\r\nThe final block on Main, before we turned on Houston I was in the\r\nprocess of unloading a camera and I was to toss it out of the car as we\r\nturned right on Houston Street to one of our reporters.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had that been set up by prearrangement?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir. And that I did as we turned the corner, and\r\nwhen--it was in an interval and as I threw it out the wind blew it,\r\ncaught it and blew it out into the street and our reporter chased\r\nit out into the street and the photographers in our car, one of the\r\nphotographers, was a TV cameraman whom I do not recall his name, and\r\nhe was joking about the film being thrown out and he was shooting my\r\npicture of throwing the film out.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At this point could you tell us, to the best of your\r\nrecollection, precisely who was with you in the car at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Jim Underwood from KRLD-TV station, Tom Dillard, chief\r\nphotographer for the Dallas Morning News, and me, and then two newsreel\r\ncameramen who I know by sight but I don't know their names.\r\n\r\nOne is with WFAA which is the Dallas Morning News station, and I\r\nbelieve the other was channel 11, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you position those people in the automobile for us\r\nwith respect to where each was sitting?\r\n\r\n(At this point Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Tom Dillard and Jim Underwood were in the front seat with\r\nthe driver.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you identify who the driver was?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But he was a sixth individual separate and apart from the\r\nfive heretofore described?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir. And in the back seat were the two I know by\r\nsight but I can't remember the names.\r\n\r\nAnd I was on the right side of the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On the right side of which seat?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Back seat, sitting up on the back of a seat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What kind of a car was it, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I believe it was a Chevrolet convertible.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Top down?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you carrying one camera or more than one camera?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Two cameras.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was one camera loaded at the time you rounded the\r\ncorner of Main and Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir; and one was empty.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was it from the camera which was empty that you had taken\r\nthe roll of film which you have just described?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Will you now proceed to tell us what happened\r\nas you rounded the corner of Main and Houston, please?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Well, as our reporter chased the film out into the street,\r\nwe all looked back at him and were laughing, and it was approximately\r\nthat time that we heard the first shot, and we had already rounded the\r\ncorner, of course, when we heard the first shot. We were approximately\r\nalmost half a block on Houston Street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you identify for me on Commission Exhibit 347,\r\nprecisely as possible, where your automobile was at the time you heard\r\nthe first shot?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Approximately right here, I would say the midpoint of this\r\nbuilding. Approximately where we heard the first report.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, will you mark in a black \"X\" on 347 the spot where\r\nyour car was at the time you heard the first shot?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Right here approximately. And as we heard the first shot,\r\nI believe it was Tom Dillard from Dallas News who made some remark as\r\nto that sounding like a firecracker, and it could have been somebody\r\nelse who said that. But someone else did speak up and make that comment\r\nand before he actually finished the sentence we heard the other two\r\nshots. Then we realized or we thought that it was gunfire, and then\r\nwe could not at that point see the President's car. We were still\r\nmoving slowly, and after the third shot the second two shots seemed\r\nmuch closer together than the first shot, than they were to the first\r\nshot. Then after the last shot, I guess all of us were just looking all\r\naround and I just looked straight up ahead of me which would have been\r\nlooking at the School Book Depository and I noticed two Negro men in a\r\nwindow straining to see directly above them, and my eyes followed right\r\non up to the window above them and I saw the rifle or what looked like\r\na rifle approximately half of the weapon, I guess I saw, and just as I\r\nlooked at it, it was drawn fairly slowly back into the building, and I\r\nsaw no one in the window with it.\r\n\r\nI didn't even see a form in the window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you do next?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I said \"There is the gun,\" or it came from that window. I\r\ntried to point it out. But by the time the other people looked up, of\r\ncourse, it was gone, and about that time we were beginning to turn the\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which corner were you beginning to turn?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Houston onto Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now show you a photograph marked as Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 348 and ask you if you can identify what that depicts?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. This is the School Book Depository. This is the window the\r\ntwo colored men were looking out of. This is the window where the rifle\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you mark the window where the rifle was with an \"A\"\r\nand would you please mark the window where you have identified the men\r\nbelow with a \"B.\"\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Referring to your mark of \"A,\" the photograph will show\r\nthat you have marked the window on the sixth floor with the mark being\r\nplaced on the window on the westerly half of the first double window.\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I am sorry. This window here on the very end was\r\nthe window where the weapon was. I am sorry, I just marked the\r\ndouble--actually this is the rifle window right here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you take the black pencil again and draw an\r\narrow--before you start to mark, hear the rest of the question--as\r\nprecisely as you can to the exact spot where you saw what you have\r\ndescribed as the rifle.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the window you have just marked as being the spot from\r\nwhich the rifle protruded, open when you looked up?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best recollection as to how far open it was\r\nat that time?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I would say that it was open like that window there,\r\nhalfway.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating a window on the sixth floor of the westernmost\r\nportion of the building open halfway as you have described it.\r\n\r\nMy last comment, as to the description of your last window, is only for\r\nthe purpose of what you have said in identifying a window to show how\r\nfar open the window was.\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which you heretofore marked with an arrow, correct?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nAlso in that window I could see boxes, corrugated boxes on the left\r\nportion which would be my left, of the window, of the open window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many boxes could you see?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I couldn't tell. It just seemed like a stack of boxes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How high were the boxes stacked?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Maybe two is all I saw. They were stacked, I believe they\r\nwere as high as the window was open, halfway up the window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best recollection of the size of those boxes\r\nwhich you say you saw?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Maybe like that, that wide.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating approximately 3 feet wide?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Three feet or a little less maybe.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the height of those boxes?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I would say high enough to hide a man. Let's say, between\r\n5 and 6 feet high, I would say to the best of my recollection. From the\r\nangle I was looking at it, I would say they were 5 feet high at least.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That is each box would be 5 feet high?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. No; the stack, the stacked boxes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you see how many boxes were stacked up to reach a\r\ntotal height of 5 to 6 feet?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, were you able to see anyone in front of those boxes?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Whether or not you could identify anyone, could you see\r\neven the form or outline of the man?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. No, sir. It looked to me like the man was over to the side\r\nof the window because the rifle was at quite an angle to me.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which side of the window?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Well, from the position of the rifle it would be the\r\ncorner of the building, the east. It would be to the right of the\r\nwindow from my view.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which direction was the rifle pointing?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. West. To my left.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was it pointing in a straight westerly direction or was it\r\npointing at an angle from the building.\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. It was at an angle from the building. I am not--well,\r\nlet's see--well, it wouldn't be directly west.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the general line of direction of the pointing of\r\nthe rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Well, directly down the street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And by down the street you are pointing out what street?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Down Elm Street toward the triple, toward the underpass.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was it pointed as you have indicated at the angle which\r\nElm Street traverses heading toward the triple underpass?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir. And the rifle was pointing slightly down.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you at any time in this sequence observe the\r\nPresident's automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. As we turned the corner--or we stopped where the\r\nintersection, actually we stopped before we began to turn left onto Elm\r\nStreet, or rather I would say we hesitated and we were all looking down\r\ntowards the President's car and I could see two cars going under the\r\nunderpass. I barely saw the President's car. I would say just the rear\r\nend of it as it disappeared under the underpass.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that the only time you saw the President's car from\r\nthe time you made a right-hand turn off of Main Street onto Houston\r\nStreet?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate as to the time span between the\r\nfirst shot you heard and the last shot you heard?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I would say 5 to 8 seconds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you give us a breakdown between the shots which you\r\nheard as to how many seconds elapsed between each one?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I would say to me it seemed like 3 or 4 seconds between\r\nthe first and the second, and between the second and third, well, I\r\nguess 2 seconds, they were very close together. It could have been more\r\ntime between the first and second. I really can't be sure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you sure you heard three shots?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, will you mark on the overhead shot, which is Exhibit\r\n347, with a \"Y\" as precisely as you can the position of your automobile\r\nat the time you heard the second shot?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. With a \"Y\"?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, please.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you now mark on the same exhibit the precise\r\nposition of your car as closely as you can recollect it when you heard\r\nthe third shot with a letter \"Z\"?\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When, in relation to the timing of the shots, which\r\nyou have described, did you first look toward the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. It couldn't have been more than 3 seconds before I looked\r\nat that window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Three seconds from what point in time?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. From the last shot.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you say from the last shot?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. From the last shot, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best recollection or estimate of the speed\r\nof your automobile as you were proceeding in a generally northerly\r\ndirection on Houston Street at the time of the shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I would say not over 15 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What would your best estimate be as to the minimum speed?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Ten, I would say.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where, in the window were the two Negro men, whom you have\r\ndescribed?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Well, there was one in each of those double windows.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On which floor was that?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. The fifth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And will you place an arrow where you saw each of those\r\nmen, please?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Each one of them?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any reaction from either or both of those\r\ntwo men when you saw them?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. No, sir. Just looking up.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you see their faces reasonably clearly to observe\r\nthat they were looking up.\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I could tell they were looking up because they were\r\nleaning way out just like that. I couldn't see their faces very well at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The witness has leaned forward and turned his head to\r\nthe right and looking upward as he sits in the witness chair, may the\r\nrecord show.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did they both turn the same way as you have\r\nindicated in answer to Mr. Specter's question?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. To the best of my recollection one man looked up to his\r\nright and the other man looked up like this to his left, one in each\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Can you identify which to his right and which to\r\nhis left?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I believe the one on the right window, my right, was\r\nlooking to his right. The one on the west window, the one to my left\r\nwas looking to his left. I believe I am right on that but I may not\r\nbe because I just looked at them for a fraction of a second, I just\r\nfollowed them up.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate of the distance which separated\r\nyou from those two men at the time you observed them?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I am not very good at distances. I was about the middle of\r\nthe block, I guess. I would say around a hundred yards, I guess.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see those two men before or after you observed the\r\nrifle?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Before.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate of how many inches of the rifle\r\nthat you observed?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I saw the barrel and about half--well, I did not see a\r\ntelescopic sight, but I did see part of the stock, so I guess maybe 8\r\nor 10 inches of the stock maybe. I did see part of the stock, I did not\r\nsee the sight.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Eight or ten inches of the stock, and how much of the\r\nbarrel would you estimate?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I guess possibly a foot.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see anyone's hands on the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, as best as you can recollect it, what exact words did\r\nyou state at or about the time you made the observation of the rifle,\r\nif any?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I said, \"There is the gun\" and somebody said \"Where?\" And\r\nI said, \"It came from that window\" and I pointed to that window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recollect who it was who said \"Where?\"\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Somebody in the car, I don't recall who.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did anybody else in the car say anything else at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Nothing that I could remember. I am sure they were all\r\ntalking.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you say anything else at about that time?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. If I did, I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did anyone in the automobile state that he, too, had seen\r\nthe rifle from the window?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have a conversation with all of the men in the car\r\nimmediately after the incident?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. No, sir; because as, I guess after the third shot, I do\r\nrecall the driver speeding up, and we hesitated at the corner before\r\nturning left, and three of the occupants of the car got out, jumped out.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who were those three?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. That was Underwood, Jim Underwood, Tom Dillard and one of\r\nthe TV cameramen. The WHAA channel 8 cameraman and I were left in the\r\nback seat. We couldn't make up our minds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there an individual in the car by the name of Mr.\r\nCouch, to your knowledge?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Couch?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I don't know him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Malcolm Couch?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. The name is familiar. I might state what I did see as we\r\ndid hesitate there, at the corner, I don't recall whether this was\r\nbefore the other three fellows got out of the car or not, I believe we\r\nwere still all in the car, as we observed these other things, but in\r\na fleeting glance as I saw the cars go under the underpass, I did see\r\npeople running. I saw a motorcycle policeman jump off his motorcycle,\r\nin fact, he just hit the curb and just let it fall, and he went down on\r\nhis knees on the grass, on the lawn of that parkway.\r\n\r\nI did see a family covering up their child, and I just saw a state of\r\nconfusion, people running, and that is about all I saw at that point of\r\nthe scene.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Jackson, at the time you heard the first shot, did you\r\nhave any reaction or impression from the sound itself as to the source\r\nof the shot, point of origin?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. No, sir; I didn't. It did sound like it came from ahead of\r\nus or from that general vicinity but I could not tell whether it was\r\nhigh up or on the ground.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say that general vicinity, what vicinity did you\r\nmean?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. We were sure it came from ahead of us which would be in a\r\nnortherly direction, northwesterly direction. It did sound as though it\r\ncame from somewhere around the head of the motorcade.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. From the second shot, did you have any reaction or\r\nimpression as to the source of this shot?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. No, sir. Through all three shots, I could just tell that\r\nit was ahead of me and not behind me, that is it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And the same impression then prevailed through the third\r\nshot as well.\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir. To me it never sounded like it was high or low.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you had occasion since this incident to relate the\r\nfactual sequences, your observations and what you heard? Have you had\r\noccasion to tell anybody about what you saw and heard as you have\r\ndescribed it to us?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Has there been any variation in your recollection or\r\nimpressions about your observations on these occasions?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Not to my knowledge. The other times were not as thorough\r\nas this.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, those are all of the questions which I\r\nhave, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Congressman Ford, any questions you would like to ask Mr.\r\nJackson?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Jackson, when and by whom were you questioned\r\nor interrogated subsequent to the event? I was thinking of the FBI, the\r\nSecret Service, or any investigative organization.\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. You say when, how soon afterwards?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I would say within 2 days afterwards, let's see, the next\r\nday was the first day.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Saturday November 23?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir; I believe it was the first time.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Who, by name, if you can, but if not by what\r\norganization?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. The FBI called me, I believe it was Friday evening, and I\r\nbelieve I did give some information on the phone Friday night.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was that followed up----\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. And they came and saw me in the office, I believe on\r\nSaturday.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How did they happen to contact you? Had you made a\r\nstatement publicly before?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Our newspaper ran an article by me or I got a byline on it\r\nstating this in general which I have stated today.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Following this initial contact have you made\r\nsubsequent statements to various organizations or any organization?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I made statements to the Secret Service also. Other than\r\nthat there was none other.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How good are your eyes, do you wear glasses?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Have you had an eye examination recently or when\r\nwas the last examination?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I had a physical when I reenlisted in the National Guard,\r\nlet's see, that was, I believe, about a year and a half ago, I had that\r\nphysical and I had 20-20 vision.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. 20-20 vision?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You just indicated you were in the Texas National\r\nGuard?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How long have you been in the Texas National Guard?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I joined in October 1958.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And you have been in continuously since?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So you are familiar with guns in general?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So you would readily identify, if you saw it, a\r\nrifle?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did any others in the automobile in which you were\r\nriding recollect as far as you know, hearing you say \"There is the gun.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I don't know whether they would remember it or not.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Have you ever talked with any others in the car?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I have never sat down and talked with them about the\r\nevents, no, sir. I have seen them, of course, several times but I have\r\nnever discussed it with them.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You never discussed what you said or what they\r\nsaid?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. No, sir. I guess the one man I have discussed it more\r\nwith than anybody else was Tom Dillard, the chief photographer for the\r\nDallas News, and we recalled to each other the scene but we really\r\nnever went into any detail or as to what each one of us said either.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. At the time you were in the car, after it had\r\nturned from Main onto Houston, was there any noise from the crowd on\r\neither side of the street, Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. There was very little crowd on Houston, as I recall. On\r\nHouston itself. The crowd--I mean as compared to Main Street, to the\r\nother end of town and down through Main. The crowd thinned out as we\r\ngot down near the intersection of Main and Houston, and there were a\r\nlot less people but I couldn't make an estimate of how many.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There was no noise from the crowd at that point?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. No, sir; no noise, I would say.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. At the time you heard the first shot, what was\r\nyour position in the car? Were you standing or sitting?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I was sitting on the back of the seat, on the right-hand\r\nside of the back seat, sitting up.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you have your camera in your hand?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes; I had one camera around my neck and the camera I\r\nhad just emptied, it was in my lap. I had thrown my film out to this\r\nreporter over the side of the car as we rounded the corner and I still\r\nhad the camera lying in my lap, and the other one was around my neck.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was this the position you were in at the time you\r\nheard the first shot?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. After the third shot and as the car hesitated,\r\ndid you see any law enforcement officials move in any concentrated or\r\nconcerted direction?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. I saw at least one, there may have been more, run up the\r\nSchool Depository steps, toward the door. That is one of the things I\r\nsaw in this confusion.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This was separate from the policeman on the\r\nmotorcycle?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Yes, sir. Yes. I should have said that a while ago. There\r\nwas a policeman who moved toward the door of the Depository. But to my\r\nbest knowledge there was no concentrated movement toward any one spot.\r\nIt looked like general confusion to me, and of course, I stayed in the\r\ncar. As we did turn the corner our driver speeded up and we went by the\r\nscene pretty fast and I do recall this Negro family covering up their\r\nchild on the grass, and I, as we passed them, they were just getting up\r\nand he had the child in his arms and the child looked limp and I didn't\r\nknow whether the child was shot or not. But then we were moving fast\r\nand went on under the underpass.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is all, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Wright, do you have any questions?\r\n\r\nMr. WRIGHT. No, Mr. Chief Justice, I passed a question on.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I have just one additional question, and that is whether\r\nMr. Jackson had any occasion to see anybody leave the scene of the\r\nTexas School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That is all, Your Honor.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Jackson, thank you very much for coming.\r\n\r\nMr. JACKSON. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. We appreciate it.\r\n\r\nWho is next?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Rowland.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Would you raise your right hand and be sworn, please.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony given before this Commission will\r\nbe the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you\r\nGod?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Specter will conduct the examination.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you state your full name for the record, please, but\r\nbefore you do, Mr. Chief Justice, is it your practice to read that\r\nstatement to the witness?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes. I will read a short statement to you for the purpose\r\nof the hearing.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of today's hearing is to hear the testimony of Arnold Louis\r\nRowland, Amos Lee Euins, James Richard Worrell, and Robert H. Jackson,\r\nwho were in the vicinity of the assassination scene on November\r\n22, 1963. The Commission proposes to ask these witnesses for facts\r\nconcerning their knowledge of the assassination of President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nA copy of that statement was furnished to you, was it not?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You didn't see it. You have one before you. Very well.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF ARNOLD LOUIS ROWLAND\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER.

What postgraduate work had you been doing that you just\r\nmentioned?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Studies in math and science.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where were you studying these courses?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. This was a high school in Dallas as advanced courses.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you been accepted in any college?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; several. Texas A. & M., Rice, SMU, Arlington.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have plans to attend one of those colleges?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which one do you plan to enter?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Preferably Rice.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have an entry date set?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; I am trying for a scholarship for it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you been in the military service?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; I haven't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the general condition of your health.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Good.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the condition of your eyesight?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Very good.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you wear glasses at any time?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When, most recently, have you had an eye test, if at all?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. About 7 months ago.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And you know the results of that test?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Very good vision.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know what classification the doctor placed on it?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; I don't remember it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recollect if it was 20-20?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. He said it was much better than that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what doctor examined your eyes?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. This was the firm of doctors Finn and Finn.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. F-i-n-n and F-i-n-n?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where are they located?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The Fidelity Union Life Building in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately how long ago was that examination?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. About 6 months.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Going to the day of November 22, 1963, how were you\r\noccupied at that time, Mr. Rowland?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I was attending classes in school part of the day, working\r\npart time as a pizzamaker in Pizza Inn.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had you regularly scheduled classes on the morning of\r\nNovember 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes. I had classes up until 11. I just had two classes on\r\nFriday.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what school were you attending at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. W. H. Adamson High.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How far is that from the intersection of Houston and Elm\r\nStreets in Dallas, approximately?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It must have been about a mile and a half.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe for the Commission what you did on that\r\nmorning, in a general way, up until approximately noon time?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I went to my classes. My wife got out of school early. We\r\nwent to town. I had to go to work at 4, so we were going downtown to do\r\nsome shopping. We went early so we could see the President's motorcade.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time did you arrive in town?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. We rode a bus from the school. We got to town\r\napproximately a quarter to 12.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What school was your wife attending at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The same: Adamson.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time did her classes end?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. She got out at 11 also.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you do from the time you arrived in town at\r\napproximately a quarter of 12 for the next 15 minutes?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Trying to find a good vantage point. We walked about five\r\nor six blocks.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. From where did you walk?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. We got off at the junction, at the intersection of Main\r\nand Houston, walked up toward Ervay, about four blocks, I would say\r\nup to Akard. We walked from Houston to Akard on Main, and then we\r\nwalked back down Commerce and then over to the sheriffs or the county\r\ncourthouse, there was a lesser crowd there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that the reason you selected the spot you ultimately\r\npicked to watch the parade?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes, there was no one in front of us, no one around that\r\narea.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I am going to show you a photograph, Mr. Rowland, which\r\nhas already been identified as Commission Exhibit No. 347 and first ask\r\nyou if you can identify what scene this represents.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; I can.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What scene is that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. This is the triple underpass, this is the scene where the\r\nPresident was assassinated.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is this plaza called in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I don't know exactly. It is just known as the triple\r\nunderpass.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is it known as Dealey Plaza to your knowledge?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I have never heard it called that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you point with your finger for me at the spot where\r\nyou were standing as best you can recollect it?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. We were about in this area on this sidewalk of this\r\nbuilding. I say approximately two-thirds of the distance between here\r\nand here in this direction.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nI have a substitute photograph for you to mark. I am now showing you\r\nan identical scene on a photograph which has been heretofore marked as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 354. Will you mark with an arrow as closely as\r\npossible to the point where you were standing?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. There is an elevator shaft below this second window on\r\nthat building that comes through a sidewalk. I was about 5 feet to the\r\nleft of it, about the third window or right here in this area.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you mark that a little more heavily, please?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time were you so positioned?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. We got there about 5 after 12.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did your position move at any time during the course of\r\nthe next half hour?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes. We did move to this corner, there were too many\r\npeople on this corner.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You are indicating back to the corner of Houston and Main?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes. Houston and Main there were too many crowds so we\r\ncame back to this street here, Commerce is that right; no, Elm and\r\nMain. We came back to Elm and Main and figured it wouldn't be a very\r\ngood vantage point because of the crowd there so we went back to where\r\nwe were.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where were you standing at the time the President's\r\nmotorcade passed by you?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. At that position.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The position you have marked with a \"V,\" inverted \"V.\"\r\n\r\nWill you mark with the letter \"A\" the point to which you had moved when\r\nyou described it as being at Commerce which you corrected to Elm and\r\nHouston.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It was this corner.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately what time did you move to the position you\r\nhave marked \"A\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. About 10 after 12.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long did you stay at position \"A\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Momentarily, just long enough to look, maybe a minute.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. To look at what?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. To look at the position itself. There was too much of a\r\ncrowd in that area. When the President would come by they would be\r\npushing or rushing in that area and it would be too crowded for us.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At that point you did what?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Then we went back to where we were.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. To position \"V\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes, and we stayed there for a minute or so, walked to the\r\ncorner of Main and Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mark Main and Houston with the letter \"B,\" if you would,\r\nwhere you moved next.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Stayed there momentarily, less than a minute. There was\r\nquite a crowd there and we went back to where we were, our original\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. To position \"V\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time would you say you got back to your position \"V\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. We got back there 14 after, I noticed the time on my\r\nwatch, and the Hertz time clock I noticed was about a minute later.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was the Hertz time clock located?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. That was on top of the school depository building.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was your watch synchronized with the Hertz up on top.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; I always set it by the same clock whenever I pass it.\r\nI pass it coming into town and I set my watch at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, did you observe at any time the building which is\r\ndepicted in Commission Exhibit No. 348?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes. We were looking around it, my wife and I, amongst the\r\ncrowd, the different areas, making note of the policemen on top of the\r\nunderpass itself, in that area, and the security precautions that were\r\nbeing taken.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to show the witness the same\r\nphotograph, but a different picture on an exhibit marked Commission\r\nExhibit No. 356.\r\n\r\nMr. Rowland, I show you a picture marked Commission Exhibit No. 356 and\r\nask you if you can identify what that represents?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. That is Houston, Elm running in front of this building.\r\nThis is the school book depository building.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you familiar with that building prior to November 22,\r\n1963?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; I have been in there on occasion.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You have been in the building?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes, to purchase books.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When were you in the building most recently prior to\r\nNovember 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Within the first week of November. This was to buy a\r\nphysics notebook.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What part of the building were you in at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Just inside the door of the main lobby.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had you ever had occasion at any time to be on any floor\r\nother than the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. While you were standing on Houston Street in the various\r\npositions which you have described, did you have occasion at any time\r\nto observe the Texas School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes. When we returned to position \"V\" we stayed there,\r\nwe began looking around. My wife and I were discussing the security\r\nprecautions that were taken in view of the event when Mr. Stevenson was\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Before you go on, let me ask you at which time was this on\r\nyour return to position \"V\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. This was 12:15.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right; proceed to tell us what you saw and heard at\r\nabout that time?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. We were discussing, as I stated, the different security\r\nprecautions, I mean it was a very important person who was coming\r\nand we were aware of the policemen around everywhere, and especially\r\nin positions where they would be able to watch crowds. We talked\r\nmomentarily of the incidents with Mr. Stevenson, and the one before\r\nthat with Mr. Johnson, and this being in mind we were more or less\r\nsecurity conscious. We looked and at that time I noticed on the sixth\r\nfloor of the building that there was a man back from the window, not\r\nhanging out the window.\r\n\r\nHe was standing and holding a rifle. This appeared to me to be a fairly\r\nhigh-powered rifle because of the scope and the relative proportion of\r\nthe scope to the rifle, you can tell about what type of rifle it is.\r\nYou can tell it isn't a .22, you know, and we thought momentarily that\r\nmaybe we should tell someone but then the thought came to us that it is\r\na security agent.\r\n\r\nWe had seen in the movies before where they have security men up in\r\nwindows and places like that with rifles to watch the crowds, and we\r\nbrushed it aside as that, at that time, and thought nothing else about\r\nit until after the event happened.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, by referring to the photograph on this Commission\r\nExhibit No. 356, will you point to the window where you observed this\r\nman?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. This was very odd. There were--this picture was not taken\r\nimmediately after that, I don't think, because there were several\r\nwindows, there are pairs of windows, and there were several pairs where\r\nboth windows were open fully and in each pair there was one or more\r\npersons hanging out the window.\r\n\r\nYet this was on the west corner of the building, the sixth floor, the\r\nfirst floor--second floor down from the top, the first was the arched,\r\nthe larger windows, not the arch, but the larger windows, and this was\r\nthe only pair of windows where both windows were completely open and no\r\none was hanging out the windows, or next to the window.\r\n\r\nIt was this pair of windows here at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nWill you mark that pair of windows with a circle?\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best recollection as to how far each of those\r\nwindows were open?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. To the fullest extent that they could be opened.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What extent would that be?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Being as I looked half frame windows, that would be\r\nhalfway of the entire length of the window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that the approximate status of those windows depicted\r\nhere in Exhibit 356?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In which of those double windows did you see the man and\r\nrifle?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It was through the window to my right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Draw an arrow right into that window with the same black\r\npencil please.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How much, if any, or all of that rifle could you see?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. All of it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You could see from the base of the stock down to the tip\r\nof the end of the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The barrel of the rifle?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Congressman Ford, will you excuse me for just a few\r\nminutes to run across the street to my office. You conduct during my\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Will you proceed, Mr. Specter?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate of the distance between where\r\nyou were standing and the man holding the rifle whom you have just\r\ndescribed?\r\n\r\n(The Chief Justice left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. 150 feet approximately, very possibly more. I don't know\r\nfor sure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you very good at judging distances of that sort?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Fairly good.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you had any experience or practice at judging such\r\ndistances?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes. Even in using the method in physics or, you know,\r\nelementary physics of looking at a position in two different views, you\r\ncan tell its distance. I did that quite frequently. And the best I can\r\nrecollect it was within 150 to 175 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you describe the rifle with any more particularity\r\nthan you already have?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No. In proportion to the scope it appeared to me to be a\r\n.30-odd size 6, a deer rifle with a fairly large or powerful scope.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say, .30-odd-6, exactly what did you mean by that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. That is a rifle that is used quite frequently for deer\r\nhunting. It is an import.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you own any rifles?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; my stepfather does.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever gone hunting deer with such a rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is that a .30-odd-6 rifle that you have hunted deer\r\nwith?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that a popular size of rifle in the Dallas, Tex., area?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I don't know about Dallas. I do know in Oregon it is one\r\nof the most popular for deer hunting.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the rifle which you observed similar to, or perhaps\r\nidentical with, .30-odd rifles which you have seen before?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The best I could tell it was of that size.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you seen such .30-odd rifles before at close range\r\nwhich had telescopic sights?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; one my stepfather has has a very powerful scope on it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did this rifle appear similar to the one your\r\nstepfather owned?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. From my distance, I would say very similar or of similar\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In what manner was the rifle being held by the man whom\r\nyou observed?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The way he was standing it would have been in a position\r\nsuch as port arms in military terms.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say port arms you have positioned your left hand\r\nwith the left elbow of your hand being about level with your shoulder\r\nand your right hand----\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Not quite level with my shoulder, and the right hand being\r\nlower on the trigger of the stock.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So the waist of the imaginary rifle you would be holding\r\nwould cross your body at about a 45-degree angle.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long was the rifle held in that position?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. During the entire time that I saw him there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see him hold it in any other position?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. For example, was he standing at any time in a parade-rest\r\nposition?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; not to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Describe, as best you can, the appearance of the\r\nindividual whom you saw?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. He was rather slender in proportion to his size. I\r\ncouldn't tell for sure whether he was tall and maybe, you know heavy,\r\nsay 200 pounds, but tall whether he would be and slender or whether he\r\nwas medium and slender, but in proportion to his size his build was\r\nslender.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you give us an estimate on his height?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; I couldn't. That is why I said I can't state what\r\nheight he would be. He was just slender in build in proportion with his\r\nwidth. This is something I find myself doing all the time, comparing\r\nthings in perspective.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he a white man or a Negro or what?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Seemed, well, I can't state definitely from my position\r\nbecause it was more or less not fully light or bright in the room. He\r\nappeared to be fair complexioned, not fair, but light complexioned, but\r\ndark hair.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What race was he then?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I would say either a light Latin or a Caucasian.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were you able to observe any characteristics of his\r\nhair?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; except that it was dark, probably black.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to observe whether he had a full head of\r\nhair or any characteristic as to quantity of hair?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It didn't appear as if he had a receding hairline but I\r\nknow he didn't have it hanging on his shoulders. Probably a close cut\r\nfrom--you know it appeared to me it was either well-combed or close cut.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What, if anything, did you observe as to the clothes he\r\nwas wearing?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. He had on a light shirt, a very light-colored shirt, white\r\nor a light blue or a color such as that. This was open at the collar.\r\nI think it was unbuttoned about halfway, and then he had a regular\r\nT-shirt, a polo shirt under this, at least this is what it appeared to\r\nbe. He had on dark slacks or blue jeans, I couldn't tell from that. I\r\ndidn't see but a small portion.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You say you only saw a small portion of what?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Of his pants from his waist down.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which half of the window was open, the bottom half or the\r\ntop half?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It was the bottom half.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how much, if any, of his body was obscured by the\r\nwindow frame from that point down to the floor?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. From where I was standing I could see from his head to\r\nabout 6 inches below his waist, below his belt.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you see as far as his knees?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your best recollection as to how close to the\r\nwindow he was standing?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. He wasn't next to the window, but he wasn't very far back.\r\nI would say 3 to 5 feet back from the window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How much of the rifle was separated from your line of\r\nvision by the window?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The entire rifle was in my view.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In the open part of the window?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how much of his body, if any, was in the open view\r\nwhere there was no window between your eyes and the object of his body?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Approximately two-thirds of his body just below his waist.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Up to what point?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Mid point between the waist and the knees, this is again\r\nin my proportion to his height that I make that judgment.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So from the waist, some point between his knees and his\r\nwaist, you started to see him clear in the window?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And from that point how far up his body were you able to\r\nsee without any obstruction of a window between you and him?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. To the top of his head. There was some space on top of\r\nthat where I could see the wall behind him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate of the space between the top of\r\nhis head and the open window at the perspective you were observing?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Two and a half, three feet, something on that--that is\r\nsomething very hard to ascertain. That would just be an estimation on\r\nmy part.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there anything else you observed about his appearance\r\nor his clothing or the rifle which you haven't already told us about?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was he facing toward you directly?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, did you get a full view of his\r\nface and his chest and the front of him?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. He appeared to me as though he were looking out the window\r\nand watching the crowd in particular.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Excuse me, go ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. That is all right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was he looking toward the corner of Houston and\r\nMain?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; I would say he was looking in the area or the general\r\nvicinity of where I was.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And you were on the sidewalk on Houston in front\r\nof the building that you have indicated?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes. Now, I can't--here again I wasn't close enough to\r\nsee his eyes but from the position of his head he was looking in that\r\ngeneral area. It could have been that maybe he was--his eyes were a\r\nlittle bit off perspective and he was watching that corner, I don't\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In what position did you say his hands were on the\r\nrifle?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. One hand was at what is called the gun stock of the rifle,\r\njust above the trigger, it was around the rifle. The other was at the\r\nother end of the rifle about 4 inches below the end of the stock.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was the rifle held above his waist?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The majority of it was, just a small portion of butt below\r\nhis waist.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The butt or the end of the rifle, the barrel end?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The butt, the stock end, was below his waist. The barrel\r\nbeing pointed in the air toward the ceiling or the wall next to him.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I see. The stock was down and the barrel was up.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to form any opinion as to the age of that\r\nman?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. This is again just my estimation. He was--I think I\r\nremember telling my wife that he appeared in his early thirties. This\r\ncould be obscured because of the distance, I mean.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to form any opinion as to the weight of\r\nthe man in addition to the line of proportion which you have already\r\ndescribed?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I would say about 140 to 150 pounds.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When did you tell your wife you thought he was in\r\nhis thirties?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Right after I noticed the man, I brought him to my wife's\r\nattention, and she was looking at something else at that time, we\r\nlooked at that, and when we both looked back she wanted to see also,\r\nand he was gone from our vision.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So she never saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. My wife never saw him.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you say at that time how old he was or how old\r\nyou thought he was?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I think I remarked to my wife that he appeared in his\r\nthirties, early thirties.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When, after you first observed him did you have a\r\nconversation about him with your wife?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Right afterwards. There was--just before I observed him\r\nthere was a police motorcycle parked just on the street, not in front\r\nof us, just a little past us, and the radio was on it giving the\r\ndetails of the motorcade, where it was positioned, and right after the\r\ntime I noticed him and when my wife was pointing this other thing to\r\nme, I don't remember what that was, the dispatcher came on and gave the\r\nposition of the motorcade as being on Cedar Springs. This would be in\r\nthe area of Turtle Creek, down in that area.\r\n\r\nI can't remember the street's name but I know where it is at. And this\r\nwas the position of the motorcade and it was about 15 or 16 after 12.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, did you tell your wife about the presence of this\r\nman immediately after you saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was the quality or condition of her eyes?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. She has nearsightedness and has to wear glasses.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was she wearing glasses at the time?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, she wasn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Based on your knowledge of her eyesight, would it have\r\nbeen possible for her to have seen him considering your relative\r\npositions?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Had he still been there she would have been able to\r\nacknowledge the figure with no description.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long did you see him there in total point of time?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It was all relatively brief, short time, 15 seconds, maybe\r\n20. I was looking at the building, looking at the people hanging out of\r\nthe building, I noticed him, my eye contact was at that position for 15\r\nto 20 seconds. This is all relatively very short length of time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now----\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. But a lot can happen in that much time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you saw him, you told her about him, and then did she\r\nlook in the direction of the man?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. After she pointed something else out to me she looked in\r\nthat direction.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you then look back toward the direction of, to the\r\nwindow where you had seen him?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; I even pointed to it with my wife.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you look back at the same time she looked back?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when you looked back what, if anything, did you\r\nobserve in the window?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. There was nothing there then.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Following that did you and she have any additional\r\nconversation about this man in the window?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. We talked about it momentarily, just for a few seconds\r\nthat it was of most likelihood a security man, had a very good vantage\r\npoint where he could watch the crowds, talked about the rifle, it\r\nlooked like a very high-powered rifle.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you mention that to your wife?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you described as fully as you can everything you\r\ndiscussed with your wife at that juncture?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I think so.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was there anybody else standing close to you as\r\nyou had this conversation with your wife?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. There was a policeman about as far as me to the flag.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is about how many feet, would you say?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Twelve, thirteen feet.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There was no one between you and the policeman in\r\nthat line of vision?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No.\r\n\r\nThen there were three or four colored men just behind the elevator, and\r\na couple on the elevator that had come up through the sidewalk. This\r\nwas a distance of--this was on the opposite side of us about 15 feet,\r\njust a little further than the officer.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There was no one closer to you and your wife than\r\n10 to 15 feet?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. That is correct. That is one of the main reasons we\r\nselected that spot.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did it ever enter your mind that you should go and\r\ntell the policeman of this sight or this vision that you had seen?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Really it didn't.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It never entered your mind?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I never dreamed of anything such as that. I mean, I\r\nmust honestly say my opinion was based on movies I have seen, on the\r\nattempted assassination of Theodore Roosevelt where they had Secret\r\nService men up in the building such as that with rifles watching the\r\ncrowds, and another one concerned with attempted assassination of the\r\nother one, Franklin Roosevelt, and both of these had Secret Service men\r\nup in windows or on top of buildings with rifles, and this is how my\r\nopinion was based and why it didn't alarm me.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if I had been older and had more experience in life it might\r\nhave made a difference. It very well could have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Rowland, did the man with the rifle have any\r\ndistinctive facial appearance such as a mustache or a prominent scar,\r\nanything of that sort which you could observe?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. There was nothing dark on his face, no mustache. There\r\ncould have been a scar if it hadn't been a dark scar. If it was, you\r\nknow, a blotch or such as this, there was nothing very dark about the\r\ncolor of his face.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Rowland, will you recount as precisely and as\r\nspecifically as you can, the exact conversation between you and your\r\nwife from the time you first noticed this man until your conversation\r\nabout the man concluded, indicating what you said and what she said in\r\nlanguage as closely as you can recollect it?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. That is a whopper.\r\n\r\nI am almost sure I told her or asked her, did she want to see a Secret\r\nService agent. She said, \"Where,\" and I said, \"In the building there,\"\r\nand at that time she told me to look--I remember what she was looking\r\nat. Right directly across from us in this plaza in front of the pond\r\nthere was a colored boy that had an epileptic fit or something of this\r\ntype right then, and she pointed this out to me and there were a couple\r\nof officers there and a few moments later they called an ambulance,\r\nthis is what she told me to look at then, and we looked at this for a\r\nshort period of time, and then I told her to look in the building, the\r\nsecond floor from the top and on that end, the two open windows, is I\r\nthink what I said, and I said, \"He is not there now.\"\r\n\r\nI think that is what I said. She said, \"What did he look like,\" and I\r\ntold her just that--I gave her more or less a brief description of what\r\nhe looked like, open collared shirt, light-colored shirt, and he had a\r\nrifle, I described the rifle in as much detail as I have to you to her.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You described the rifle to her in as much detail as you\r\nhave to us?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nAnd then she said something about wishing she could have seen him but\r\nhe was probably somewhere else in another part of the building watching\r\npeople now. Then we were discussing again, just preceding that we\r\nwere discussing the event with Mr. Stevenson, this was about 2 weeks\r\nbeforehand, this was fresh on our mind, and right after that we started\r\ndiscussing that it was a security man.\r\n\r\nWe were looking around, we became very security conscious. We noted\r\nthat policemen, I think there were maybe 2, maybe 3 on the viaduct\r\nitself; some 20 or 30, I would say 20 to 25 policemen being in that\r\nimmediate area.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. About what time, as you can best recollect, did\r\nthis conversation with your wife take place?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. About 5 minutes until about 22 after. I think I again\r\nlooked at my watch.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. After you and your wife looked up and saw that\r\nthere was no one in the window, did you ever again look at the window?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; I did, constantly.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And as you looked at the window subsequently did\r\nyou ever see anything else in the window?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; not in that window, and I looked back every few\r\nseconds, 30 seconds, maybe twice a minute, occasionally trying to find\r\nhim so I could point him out to my wife.\r\n\r\nSomething I would like to note is that the window that I have been told\r\nthe shots were actually fired from, I did not see that, there was\r\nsomeone hanging out that window at that time.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. At what time was that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. At the time I saw the man in the other window, I saw this\r\nman hanging out the window first. It was a colored man, I think.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is this the same window where you saw the man\r\nstanding with the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; this was the one on the east end of the building, the\r\none that they said the shots were fired from.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I am not clear on this now. The window that you\r\nsaw the man that you describe was on what end of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The west, southwest corner.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And the man you saw hanging out from the window\r\nwas at what corner?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The east, southeast corner.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Southeast corner. On the same floor?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. On the same floor.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When did you notice him?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. This was before I noticed the other man with the rifle.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I see. This was before you saw the man in the\r\nwindow with the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes. My wife and I were both looking and making remarks\r\nthat the people were hanging out the windows. I think the majority of\r\nthem were colored people, some of them were hanging out the windows to\r\ntheir waist, such as this. We made several remarks to this fact, and\r\nthen she started watching the colored boy, and I continued to look, and\r\nthen I saw the man with the rifle.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. After 12:22 or thereabouts you indicated you\r\nperiodically looked back at the window in the southwest corner where\r\nyou had seen the man with the rifle. What happened as the motorcade\r\ncame along?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. As the motorcade came along, there was quite a bit of\r\nexcitement. I didn't look back from then. I was very interested in\r\ntrying to see the President myself. I had seen him twice before but I\r\nwas interested in seeing him again.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you notice a sedan come by with any officials\r\nin it at the outset of the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The first car in the motorcade was, I think it was, a\r\nwhite or cream-colored Ford. This appeared to be full of detectives or\r\nsuch as this; rather husky men, large men.\r\n\r\nI think there were four in this car.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was this an open or a closed car?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. This was a sedan, the doors were closed.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What was the next car you noticed?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The next car was the President's car.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you notice again or did you look again during\r\nthis period of time at the School Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No. From where we were standing the motorcade came down\r\nMain, and when it turned on Houston we watched the motorcade, my wife\r\nremarked at Jackie's clothing, Mrs. Kennedy, and we made a few remarks\r\nof her clothing and how she looked, her appearance in general, and we\r\nalso discussed--we didn't immediately recognize Governor Connally and\r\nhis wife being in the car, we were trying to figure out who that was.\r\n\r\nThen the motorcade turned on Elm and was obscured from our vision by\r\na crowd, and we were discussing the clothing of Mrs. Kennedy at that\r\ntime. My wife likes clothes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You never again, after the motorcade once came\r\ninto your view, looked back at the School Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I did after the shots were fired.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had you finished telling us all about the conversation\r\nbetween you and your wife concerning this man?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. To the best of my recollection, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nYou have described seeing someone in another window hanging out. Would\r\nyou draw a circle and put an \"A\" beside the window where you say you\r\nsaw someone hanging out. That is on Exhibit No. 356.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At about what time was it that you observed someone\r\nhanging out of the window that you have marked as window \"A\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Again about 12:15 just before I noticed the other man.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You have marked the double window there. Would you draw\r\nthe arrow in the red pencil indicating specifically which window it was.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe with as much particularity as you can\r\nwhat that man looked like?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It seemed to me an elderly Negro, that is about all. I\r\ndidn't pay very much attention to him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At or about that time did you observe anyone else hanging\r\nout any window or observe any one through any window on the same floor\r\nwhere you have drawn the two circles on Exhibit 356?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; no one else on that floor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You testified before that there were other windows where\r\nyou had seen people hanging out, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you tell us and indicate on the picture, Exhibit\r\n356, to the best of your ability to recollect just which those windows\r\nwere?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. There was either two or three people in this window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mark that with a \"B\" if you would, please.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Those pair of windows. I think this was all on that floor.\r\n\r\nHere on this floor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating the second floor?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Circle the windows and mark it with a \"C\" if you will.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I think it was this pair immediately over the door, and\r\nthis pair.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mark one \"C\" and one \"D,\" if you will.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Here I know there were two Negro women, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating window \"C.\" You say two Negro women?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were those women each in one window, both in one\r\nwindow or what?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. They were one in each window. Then at the window \"D\" there\r\nwas one, one window open.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which was that, indicate that by an arrow, if you please.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The one on the west side, and this appeared to have two\r\nheads just inside the window, no one hanging out the window as with the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe anyone else hanging out the window?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. There was someone on the third floor. I think it was--wait\r\na minute--yes, the third floor had three adjoining sets of windows that\r\nwere open. They were all open to the fullest extent they would open.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you mark those \"E,\" \"F\" and \"G,\" please.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any people in those windows marked \"E,\"\r\n\"F,\" and \"G\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes, and this pair, \"E,\" both windows were open, and there\r\nappeared to be one man in the eastern window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which you have now marked with an arrow.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about as to window marked \"F\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Both windows were completely up, and there appeared to\r\nbe several people in that window, four or five, a number that I don't\r\nremember, you know I couldn't see all of them.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about window \"G\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. This again, both windows were open all of the way and I\r\nthink there was one person in each window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any other people either through any other\r\nwindow or hanging out of any other window in the building?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. There was no one in the fourth floor to my knowledge, to\r\nmy recollection.\r\n\r\nThere were what appeared to be secretaries, several young white girls\r\nor ladies, standing on the steps of the building in this general area.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating the door of the building.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. And there was no one else in there, except I think there\r\nwas a policeman in front of the door on the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you described everybody you have observed, with\r\nrespect to everybody hanging out the windows?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. To the best of my recollection.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Or anybody you could see through the windows?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As to the window which you have marked \"A\", that double\r\npair of windows, which, if either or both, was open?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The one on the eastern side was open and not all of the\r\nway it would open.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that the one you have marked with an arrow?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How much of that window was open?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It was open about that far.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating 2-1/2 feet?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Two feet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Two feet.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Indicating 2 feet. It looked like the windows might open\r\n3--two-thirds or three-fourths of the distance.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about the other of the windows in the double-set\r\nmarked \"A,\" was that completely closed?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about the windows in the group marked \"B,\" was either\r\nof those windows open?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. They were both completely open.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you describe with any more particularity the people\r\nyou saw in the window which you have marked \"B\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. There was a white man hanging out either \"G\" or \"B,\" I do\r\nnot remember which. He was the only white man, besides the man in these\r\nwindows that I saw----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you said \"these windows\" you mean the first window\r\nyou marked with a black circle and a black arrow?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there anything else you can tell us about the people\r\nyou saw in window \"B\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I think to the best of my recollection there was either\r\ntwo or three people in window \"B,\" and as I stated before, either \"B\"\r\nor \"G\" had a white man in the window. I do not remember which. I do\r\nremember it was one of the windows on the corner.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recollect if the other people in window \"B\" were\r\nwhite or Negro?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. They were Negro.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, did you have any occasion to look back at window \"A\"\r\nfrom the time you saw the man whom you described as a Negro gentleman\r\nin that window until the President's procession passed by?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Well, up until the time the procession was----\r\n\r\n(Short recess.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I suggest, Mr. Specter, we resume the hearing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you read the last question, Mr. Reporter, please.\r\n\r\n(Question read.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you like to start the question again or would you\r\nlike the question repeated?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I understand the question.\r\n\r\nLet me see, the exact time I do not remember, but the man, the colored\r\nman, was in that window until the procession reached Commerce--I mean\r\nMain, and Ervay. I was looking back quite often, as I stated.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How do you fix the time that he was there until the\r\nprocession reached the intersection of Commerce and Ervay?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The police motorcycle was almost in front of me with the\r\nspeaker on very loud, giving the relative position about every 15 or 20\r\nseconds of the motorcade, and this is how I was able to note that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you observing the window which you marked \"A\" at the\r\ntime he departed?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, I didn't. I just know, I was looking at the crowd\r\naround, and then I glanced back up again, and neither did I see the man\r\nwith the rifle nor did I see him. The colored man went away.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long was that after you first noticed the colored man\r\nin the window \"A\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had you looked back at window \"A\" at any time during that\r\n15 minute interval?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had you seen anybody in window \"A\" during that time?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The colored man was that----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So how many times did you notice him altogether?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Several. I think I looked back about two, maybe three\r\ntimes a minute, an average. I was, you know, trying to find the man\r\nwith the rifle to point him out to my wife. I noticed the colored man\r\nin that window. I looked at practically every window in the building\r\nbut I didn't look at anything with the detail to see what I was looking\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Over how long a time span did you observe the Negro man to\r\nbe in the window marked \"A\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. He was there before I noticed the man with the rifle and\r\napproximately 12:30 or when the motorcade was at Main and Ervay he was\r\ngone when I looked back and I had looked up there about 30 seconds\r\nbefore or a minute before.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long after you heard the motorcade was at Main and\r\nErvay did the motorcade pass by where you were?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Another 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that you observed this colored man on the window you\r\nhave marked \"A\" within 5 minutes prior to the time the motorcade passed\r\nin front of you?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Approximately 5 minutes prior to the time the motorcade\r\ncame, he wasn't there. About 30 seconds or a minute prior to that time\r\nhe was there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. A few moments ago in your testimony you stated that in\r\nobserving policemen in the area you had observed some officers on the\r\noverpass?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately how far were you from the overpass at that\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. 125 yards approximately.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to observe with clarity the individuals who\r\nwere standing on the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Not with detailed distinction. I do remember there were\r\nthree women there, two or three men, a couple of boys, and two officers\r\non the overpass itself.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How did you identify the officers as being policemen?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. They were uniformed officers.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What kind of uniforms were they wearing?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Blue; I think trimmed in gold, uniforms.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are those the regular uniforms worn by the Dallas police?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where were you standing at the time you observed the\r\npeople on the overpass whom you have just described?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Position \"B.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At about what time was it when you observed those\r\nindividuals?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. This was between the time between 12:15 and 12:30. I think\r\nI looked more than once.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many times did you look?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I don't know really. I was more or less scanning the crowd.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did the individuals present on the triple overpass change\r\nat the various times when you looked in that direction?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I don't think so. I don't think anyone went off who was up\r\nthere or anyone else went on.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you now relate what occurred as the Presidential\r\nmotorcade passed by you?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Well, the car turned the corner at Houston and Main.\r\nEveryone was rushing, pressing the cars, trying to get closer. There\r\nwere quite a few people, you know, trying to run alongside of the car\r\nsuch as this; officers were trying to prevent this. The car turned--we\r\nhad more or less a long period of time that they were within our sight\r\nconsidering some of the other people.\r\n\r\nThe car went down Houston, again turned on Elm, and it was proceeding\r\ndown Elm when we heard the first of the reports. This I passed off\r\nas a backfire, so did practically everyone in the area because gobs\r\nof people, when I say gobs, I mean almost everyone in the vicinity,\r\nstarted laughing that couldn't see the motorcade. The motorcade was\r\nobscured from our vision by the crowd.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What would the occasion be for laughter on the sound of a\r\nbackfire?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I don't know. A lot of people laughed. I don't know. But\r\na lot of people laughed, chuckled, such as this. Then approximately 5\r\nseconds, 5 or 6 seconds, the second report was heard, 2 seconds the\r\nthird report. After the second report, I knew what it was, and----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was it?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I knew that it was a gun firing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How did you know that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I have been around guns quite a bit in my lifetime.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the sound of the fire different from the first and\r\nsecond sounds you described?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, that is just it. It did not sound as though there was\r\nany return fire in that sense.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What do you mean by return fire?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. That anyone fired back. You know, anyone in the procession\r\nsuch as our detectives or Secret Service men fired back at anything\r\nelse. It gave the report of a rifle which most of the Secret Service\r\nmen don't carry in a holster although I am sure they had some in the\r\ncars but the following two shots were the same report being of the\r\nsame intensity. I state, because from a different position I know that\r\nthe same rifle is not going to make the same sound in two different\r\npositions especially in a position such as it was, because of the\r\nricocheting of sound and echo effects.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your basis for saying that, Mr. Rowland, that the\r\nrifle would not make the same sound in two different positions?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. This is due to a long study of sound and study of echo\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When had you conducted that study?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. In physics in the past 3 years.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you read any special books on that subject?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Quite a few.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recollect any of the titles and authors?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; I do not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you take any special courses which would give you\r\ninsight into that subject matter?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. This was more or less on my own initiative. The instructor\r\ngave me help and aided me when I requested this during my off periods\r\nof class.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What instructor was that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. His name was Foster.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recall his first name?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Sam.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at what school does he teach?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. He teaches at Crozier Tech, Downtown Technical High School.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is he still there?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. To my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How recently did you have a course with him?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Last year, last school year.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you describe the second sound by comparison with the\r\nfirst sound which you have described as being similar to a backfire?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The second to my recollection was identical or as closely\r\nas could be.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about the third shot?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The same.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Sounded the same to you?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any impression or reaction as to the point of\r\norigin when you heard the first noise?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Well, I began looking, I didn't look at the building\r\nmainly, and as practically any of the police officers that were there\r\nthen will tell you, the echo effect was such that it sounded like it\r\ncame from the railroad yards. That is where I looked, that is where all\r\nthe policemen, everyone, converged on the railroads.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say railroad yards, what area are you referring\r\nto? Identify it on Commission Exhibit No. 354, for example?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. In this area in here.\r\n\r\nNow most of the officers converged on this area----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say \"in here,\" I will get a black pencil here and\r\nsee if we can draw a circle around the area where you have described\r\nthe echo effect?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The echo effect felt as though it came from this general\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mark that with the letter \"C\" in the center of your circle.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, as to the second shot, did you have any impression as\r\nto the point of origin or source?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The same point or very close to it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how about the third shot?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Very close to the same position.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where did you look, if you recall, after you heard the\r\nfirst shot, in what direction?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. We were standing here at position \"B.\" At the sound of the\r\nsecond report, I proceeded across the street. My wife was very anxious\r\nto find out what was going on. I proceeded to cross the street like\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating you were--she was pulling you ahead?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes. She was very anxious to find out what was going on.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That was at the sound of the second report?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes, it was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And will you mark with this black pencil, with the letter\r\n\"D,\" where you went to, as she pulled you across the street?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. We crossed the street in this area, proceeded down the\r\nsidewalk, around here, there was quite a bit of crowd, people were\r\nrunning.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where were you at the time that you heard the second\r\nreport?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. At the second report we were approximately at the curb,\r\nout from the curb, we were off the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At point \"V\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about the third shot, where were you then?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. At the third shot I was in this vicinity halfway to where\r\nwe crossed the street to the end of the block.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you indicate with the letter \"D\" where you were at\r\nthe time of the third shot?\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where did you look when you heard the third report?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Well, we were trying to actually see the President's car,\r\nthat is what my wife was trying to do, and then I decided I might as\r\nwell give in to her.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. After the shots occurred, did you ever look back at the\r\nTexas School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; I did not. In fact, I went over toward the scene of\r\nthe railroad yards myself.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why did you not look back at the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building in view of the fact that you had seen a man with a\r\nrifle up there earlier in the day?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I don't remember. It was mostly due to the confusion, and\r\nthen the fact that it sounded like it came from this area \"C,\" and that\r\nall the officers, enforcement officers, were converging on that area,\r\nand I just didn't pay any attention to it at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many officers were converging on that area, to the\r\nbest of your ability to recollect and estimate?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I think it would be a very good estimation of 50, maybe\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know how fast the President's automobile was\r\ndriving as it proceeded in front of you when you were standing at\r\nposition \"B\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Very slow pace, 5, 10 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When, if at all, did you first report what you had\r\nobserved in the Texas School Book Depository Building about the man\r\nwith the rifle to anyone in an official position?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. That was approximately 15 minutes after the third report\r\nthat I went to an officer, he was a plainclothesman who was there\r\ncombing the area, close to position \"C,\" looking for footprints and\r\nsuch as this, some lady said someone jumped off one of the colonnades\r\nand started running, there was an officer looking in this area for\r\nfootprints and such as this.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that lady ever identified to you?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; I do not remember his name. He introduced himself and\r\nshowed me his ID.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I mean the lady you talked about.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now as to the officer to whom you made a report, was he a\r\nState, City or Federal official, if you know?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It was a Dallas detective.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you give him a statement or what procedure did he\r\nfollow?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It happened such as this: He was looking in this area for\r\nfootprints or any visible marks. I started looking around also. I found\r\na fountain pen that someone had probably dropped during the confusion\r\nor fell out of their pocket when they fell on the ground or such. I\r\npicked it up and handed it to him. I had on gloves, I wasn't to mess up\r\nthe fingerprints because it very possibly could have fallen out of the\r\npocket of the man who supposedly had jumped down.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You were wearing gloves on that day?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was it a chilly day?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The sun was shining, it was a fair day but the wind was\r\nblowing and it was breezy.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was it cold enough to have gloves?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; I had on my overcoat and my wife had a fairly heavy\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Proceed, and tell us what you did.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I handed this pen to the officer and I started thinking\r\nand I went to him and told him again just before the motorcade came\r\nI saw a man in the building with a rifle, and he immediately took me\r\nto Sheriff Decker which, in turn, asked two other deputies to take\r\nme to his office. We went there to his office. There was quite a few\r\nreporters around, such as this. They took my wife and I to a back room\r\nand shut us off completely from the reporters and everyone. There was\r\nno one in that room for 4 hours but this sheriff and a FBI agent, Agent\r\nSorrels, and a stenographer, and I think another lady and a man that\r\nhad seen another man carrying a rifle in a case on the other end of\r\ntown earlier prior to this time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you sure there was a court reporter present?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It was one of the secretaries from the office of the\r\nsheriff, stenographer who was taking, using an electric typewriter\r\nevery time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was she taking down in shorthand----\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As you could observe----\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Each word that you were saying?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did she have any sort of a machine, such as a stenograph,\r\nas the gentleman who is serving as court reporter has?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; she took it down in shorthand and retyped it on an\r\nelectric typewriter that she brought into the room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did she type up what you had said?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; typed up three or four copies and then I signed it at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now show you a photostatic copy of what purports to\r\nbe an affidavit which you gave to the Sheriff's Department of the\r\nCounty of Dallas, Tex., on November 22, 1963, and has been marked as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 357. Would you take a look at that, take your\r\ntime, of course, and tell us whether or not that is the affidavit which\r\nyou took on the occasion which you have just related?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes. In fact, at this time I also noted that my wife\r\ndragged me across the street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Just one detail on that statement: There is a reference\r\nhere to the man holding the rifle being in a position which you\r\ndescribe as \"a parade-rest sort of position.\" That appears----\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It does appear in there?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Eighteen lines down.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; I see it. It wasn't a parade-rest position. It was\r\na port-arms position. I never noticed that in there before. There\r\nwere--actually, I will say this, I said what I had to say. The FBI\r\nagent reworded it, and she took it down.\r\n\r\nNow this happened; it wasn't my words verbatim, it was reworded.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you ever use the words \"parade-rest\" position?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Not to my recollection.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So it is just an error in transcription which you did not\r\nnotice when you signed it.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Chief Justice Warren entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nIs there any other aspect of the affidavit which you gave, which you\r\nhave just observed, which is at variance with your current recollection\r\nof what you saw and heard on that date?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Here it states we were at the west entrance of the\r\nsheriff's office, that is just a general approximation, we were 25 feet\r\nfrom there, in fact.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there any other portions of it which vary from your\r\ncurrent recollection?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I don't remember saying definitely that he was back about\r\n15 feet. In fact, I think I said, as I said now, 3 to 5 feet, because\r\nfrom my point of view if he was back 15 feet I couldn't have even seen\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there any other parts of the affidavit which vary from\r\nyour current recollection?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The actual time between the reports I would say now, after\r\nhaving had time to consider the 6 seconds between the first and second\r\nreport and two between the second and third. It is very fast for a\r\nbolt-loading rifle.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recall whether or not the statement is accurate in\r\nthat you told the police officials at that time that there was a time\r\nspan of 8 seconds between the first and second shots and a time span of\r\n3 seconds between the second and third shots?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I think I did tell them that, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And with respect to the facts which appear in the\r\nstatement that you said the man was standing about 15 feet back\r\nfrom the windows, did you actually tell them that when you made the\r\nstatement, or is that an error of transcription?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I don't think I said that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now are there any other points where the affidavit is at\r\nvariance from your current recollection?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The time that it states here, we arrived in downtown\r\nDallas at approximately 12:10. Actually we arrived before 12 but we\r\ntook the position that we have, approximately 12:10, that position \"V\"\r\non this other Exhibit 354.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there any other variances between your current\r\nrecollection and this statement?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I do not think so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you tell the police officials at the time you made\r\nthis statement that there was a Negro gentleman in the window on the\r\nsouthwest corner of the Texas School Book Depository Building which you\r\nhave marked with a circle \"A\"--pardon me, southeast?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. At that time, no. However, the next day on Saturday there\r\nwere a pair of FBI officers, agents out at my home, and they took\r\nanother handwritten statement from me which I signed again, and this\r\nwas basically the same. At that time I told them I did see the Negro\r\nman there and they told me it didn't have any bearing or such on the\r\ncase right then. In fact, they just the same as told me to forget it\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Reporter, will you please repeat that last answer for\r\nus?\r\n\r\n(Answer read.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I am now handing you a document which I have marked as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 358, which purports to be a reproduction of a\r\nstatement which was purportedly given by you to the FBI, two agents of\r\nthat Bureau.\r\n\r\nWill you take a look at that and tell us if that is the statement which\r\nyou gave to the FBI to which you just referred?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Again, I have a variance of time and a variance of\r\ndistance that he was from the window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Before you direct your attention to those factors, Mr.\r\nRowland, are you able to tell us whether or not this is the statement\r\nwhich you gave to the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes. My wife was with me when I gave the statement.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And without looking at the statement which, may the record\r\nshow, you are not now doing, do you recollect the names of the FBI,\r\ndon't look there, just tell me if you can recollect without seeing\r\ntheir names on the statement?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, sir; I talked to seven different pairs of FBI agents\r\nand I don't remember their names.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Seven different pairs?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes, sir; I had--this is only one of the statements. They\r\ncame to my home or where I worked and took three more besides this one.\r\nThere were four handwritten statements that I signed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Before getting the details on those, tell me in what\r\nrespect, if any, the statement which we have identified as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 358 differs from what you told the FBI agents at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I do not think it differs.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then that statement accurately reflects what you said at\r\nthat time?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; I am sure it does.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, in what respects, if any, does that statement vary\r\nfrom your current recollection about the facts which are contained\r\ntherein?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The time factor, the time that we arrived in town. Here\r\nagain it states 12:10. Now this is the time that we arrived at the\r\nposition that we stayed at, not the time we arrived in town, and the\r\ndistance the man was back from the window. Here it states 12 to 15\r\nfeet. I do not remember saying that although I very well could have.\r\nEverything was confusing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But what is your current recollection on the distance that\r\nthe man was back from the window?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Three to four, five feet, somewhere in that neighborhood.\r\nHe wasn't very far. Far enough for the sunlight to hit him and at the\r\nangle the sun was that wouldn't be very far.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now noticing that the date on that statement is November\r\n24, 1963, does that appear to you to be the date when that statement\r\nwas taken, or was it taken on the 23d, the day after the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It was Saturday morning, the 24th.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On what day was the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It was Thursday, wasn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. No; the assassination occurred on Friday.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I am sorry, that is right. It is so confused in this.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, was the statement taken the second day after the\r\nassassination or the morning of the first day after the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; it was taken on Saturday morning before I went to work\r\nbecause on Sunday there was another statement taken from me at my job\r\nwhere I was working. This occurred right after Oswald was shot himself.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, are you able to identify that statement which we\r\nhave marked Exhibit 358, as the statement taken on Saturday, the 23d,\r\nas distinguished from the statement taken on Sunday, the 24th of\r\nNovember?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How can you be certain of that, Mr. Rowland?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The one on Sunday, this particular one, I do remember the\r\nagent used a legal pad. He did have three pages of it handwritten. I\r\nmade corrections on this in different parts of it. The one on Sunday\r\nwas not a legal pad. It was a steno pad and it, in fact, covered a page\r\nand a half, I think, and it was concerned with mainly could I identify\r\nthe man that I saw, his description.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, at the time you made the Saturday statement, which\r\nyou say was transcribed and appears as Exhibit 358, did you at that\r\ntime tell the interviewing FBI agents about the colored gentleman who\r\nyou testified was in the window which you marked with an \"A\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you ask them at that time to include the information\r\nin the statement which they took from you?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No. I think I told them about it after the statement, as\r\nan afterthought, an afterthought came up, it came into my mind. I also\r\ntold the agents that took a statement from me on Sunday. They didn't\r\nseem very interested, so I just forgot about it for a while.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that information included in the written portion of\r\nthe statement which was taken from you on Sunday?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, it wasn't. It shouldn't but the agent deleted it\r\nthough himself, I mean I included it in what I gave.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say deleted it, did he strike it out after\r\nputting it in, or did he omit it in the transcription?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Omitted it.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I think you said a while ago that when you told the FBI\r\nagents on Saturday that you had seen this Negro man in the window, that\r\nthey indicated to you that they weren't interested in it at all. What\r\ndid they say which gave you that impression?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I don't remember exactly what was said. The context was\r\nagain the agents were trying to find out if I could positively identify\r\nthe man that I saw. They were concerned mainly with this, and I brought\r\nup to them about the Negro man after I had signed the statement, and at\r\nthat time he just told me that they were just trying to find out about\r\nor if anyone could identify the man who was up there. They just didn't\r\nseem interested at all. They didn't pursue the point. They didn't take\r\nit down in the notation as such.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. It was more of the fact that they didn't pursue it, didn't\r\ninclude it?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Or that they said something which led you to believe they\r\nwere not interested?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It was just the fact they didn't pursue it. I mean, I\r\njust mentioned that I saw him in that window. They didn't ask me, you\r\nknow, if was this at the same time or such. They just didn't seem very\r\ninterested in that at all.\r\n\r\nMr. WRIGHT. By man who was up there you mean man with the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. They were interested in the man with the rifle, and\r\nfinding out if anyone could identify him. The other man was the colored\r\nman in the other window.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. A minute ago you indicated that you could see\r\nthe man in the window with the rifle because of the light conditions,\r\nI think you referred to the sun shining in that direction toward the\r\nbuilding. Was the sun bright, do you recall that at all?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; the sun was out, somewhat bright. I didn't have any\r\nsunglasses on at that time because I had broken them the week before,\r\nand I hadn't gotten any new ones. The sun was shining in from what I\r\ncould tell he was standing where I seen him through the window on my\r\nright. This would be the east window of the pair. It appeared as though\r\nthe sun were shining in through either a window on the other side of\r\nthe building, on the west side of the building, or possibly the western\r\npair, one of the pair. This sun was--that hit him about from the\r\nshoulders down as far as I could see, that is why I was able to tell\r\nthe rifle was of the type or such that it was.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. As you faced the window, as you faced the\r\nbuilding, the sun was shining over which shoulder, to your left or your\r\nright shoulder?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. As I faced the building the sun was shining--well, I would\r\nhave been facing the building if the building were in this direction\r\nmore or less this way and the sun would have been shining from this\r\narea.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Over your left shoulder?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; forward.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to identify the man whom you saw in the\r\nwindow with the rifle for the FBI agents?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did they have pictures with them at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I have seen three pictures of Lee Harvey Oswald, two of\r\nthem in the paper. They had a morning newspaper was all they had. It\r\nwasn't a very good picture, and I couldn't tell. I didn't know, I\r\nwasn't going to say because I didn't, I mean. I just couldn't identify\r\nhim. I wouldn't be--I had already resigned myself not to be given that\r\ntask, because I couldn't definitely say any one man was that man.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was the basis of your concluding, as you put it,\r\nthat you resigned yourself to that task?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. This was because I just didn't have a good enough look at\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that your conclusion at this moment that you are\r\nunable to identify, with precision and certainty, the man whom you saw\r\nholding the rifle in the window of the Texas School Book Depository\r\nBuilding?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; that is true.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you believe that you could identify the Negro gentleman\r\nin window \"A\" whom you testified you saw?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I would have to say perhaps. I can't say for sure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. A moment ago you testified that you gave statements\r\nto seven different pairs of FBI agents. Have you already testified\r\nabout three of those occasions, or, stated differently, start at the\r\nbeginning and tell us, as best you can recollect, what were those\r\noccasions, when they occurred, where you were when you had those\r\nmeetings with the seven different pairs of agents.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The first statement I gave was in the sheriff's office on\r\nthat date.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there two FBI agents present?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I think there were.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do you recollect their names?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, I do not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When was the second occasion?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The Saturday morning.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was that statement given?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. That was in the agent's car in front of my mother-in-law's\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recollect the identities of those FBI agents?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, I do not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That is the statement you have identified as being\r\nreproduced in Commission Exhibit 358?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, when was the third statement obtained?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It was Sunday morning, the following day, November 25.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was that statement obtained?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. This was at my place of employment at the Pizza Inn.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, Sunday after the assassination would have been the\r\n24th.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; that is right, I am sorry, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you certain of the day of the week, however?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; I am certain of that because I went to work at noon\r\non Sunday and they were there when I got to work, they were waiting on\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That is the statement which you described as having been\r\ntaken on a stenopad?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you sign that statement?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; I did. This was in the presence of my wife because\r\nshe was there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recollect the identity of those FBI agents?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; I do not, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When was the fourth statement taken?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The fourth was Tuesday night of that week.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Of the following week?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was that statement taken?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. This was at my mother-in-law's house, and----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that reduced to writing?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. That was merely one paragraph. They were concerned with\r\nidentification of the man that I saw.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you tell them essentially at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The description and that I could not positively identify\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you sign a statement for them at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know the identity of those FBI agents?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Up to this point were any of the FBI agents the same who\r\nhad interviewed you and taken statements from you?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All different?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When did the fifth occasion take place when you were\r\ninterviewed by the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. This was again where I worked. This was, it was not a\r\nformal written statement. They just took notes on what I said, had me\r\nrecount that entire thing to the best of my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When did this occur, the fifth one?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It was on the following Friday.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. About what time of the day or night was it?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. About 8:30 p.m.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At the Pizza Inn?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; Dallas time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do you recall the identities of those FBI agents?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were they the same as any who had ever interviewed you\r\nbefore?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, sir; none of them are the same.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When was the sixth occasion when you were interviewed by\r\nthe FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It was again on Sunday.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. This would have been November--it would have been December\r\n1st?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I don't remember that date but it was----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The second Sunday after the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was the sixth interview conducted?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. This was at the Pizza Inn.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. About what time of the day or night was that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. About 1 o'clock. This was again right after I came to work.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the statement taken from you at that time reduced to\r\nwriting?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It was again informal, just taking notes on my statement,\r\nhad me recount what I had told the other agents.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were they interested in specifically at that time if\r\nyou recall?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. They just wanted me to recount everything that I could\r\nrecall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know the identity of those agents?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were they again different agents?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; they were.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. From all those you had seen before?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When had you given the seventh statement to the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The last statement I gave I think it was to one FBI agent\r\nand a Secret Service Agent.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When did that occur?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. That was either Tuesday or Wednesday of the week. I do not\r\nremember which.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On the week following the Sunday when you gave the sixth\r\nstatement?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recall the identities of those men?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had you ever seen either before?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, sir; I hadn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did they reduce your statement to writing?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, sir; they just had me recount everything again.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In addition to the times you have already stated, have you\r\never been interviewed by the FBI on any other occasion?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever been interviewed by the Secret Service on\r\nany other occasion?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The afternoon of the 22d and the seventh time was the only\r\ntwo times of the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. There was a Secret Service agent present in the sheriff's\r\noffice?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; he was Agent Sorrels.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you gave the affidavit which we have identified as\r\nCommission Exhibit 357?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In addition to the times you have mentioned, have you\r\never been interviewed by any agent or representative of the Federal\r\nGovernment?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, sir; I have not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you been interviewed by any other agent or\r\nrepresentative of the State Government of Texas?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, on any of the other occasions, other than those you\r\ntestified about, did you mention seeing the Negro gentleman in the\r\nwindow which we have circled with the \"A\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Rowland, what was the quality of your grades in high\r\nschool?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Well, up until my senior year they were 4.0 straight A's,\r\nin my senior year I got a couple of B's.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know what your IQ or intelligence quotient is?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. 147.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know when you were tested for that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. In 1963; in May.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Rowland, a couple of other questions.\r\n\r\nAre you able to give us any other type of a description of the Negro\r\ngentleman whom you observed in the window we marked \"A\" with respect to\r\nheight, weight, age?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. He was very thin, an elderly gentleman, bald or\r\npractically bald, very thin hair if he wasn't bald. Had on a plaid\r\nshirt. I think it was red and green, very bright color, that is why I\r\nremember it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you give us an estimate as to age?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Fifty; possibly 55 or 60.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you give us an estimate as to height?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. 5'8\", 5'10\", in that neighborhood. He was very slender,\r\nvery thin.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you give us a more definite description as to\r\ncomplexion?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Very dark or fairly dark, not real dark compared to some\r\nNegroes, but fairly dark. Seemed like his face was either--I can't\r\nrecall detail but it was either very wrinkled or marked in some way.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Shortly after the assassination and before these\r\ninterviews that you described were completed, Mr. Rowland, had you\r\nlearned or heard that the shots were supposed to have come out of the\r\nwindow which we have marked with the \"A\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, sir. I did not know that, in fact until Saturday when\r\nI read the paper.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which Saturday is that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The following Saturday.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would that be the second day, the day after the\r\nassassination?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, knowing that, at that time, did you attach any\r\nparticular significance to the presence of the Negro gentleman, whom\r\nyou have described, that you saw in window \"A\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; that is why I brought it to the attention of the FBI\r\nagents who interviewed me that day. This was as an afterthought because\r\nI did not think of it firsthand. But I did bring it to their attention\r\nbefore they left, and they----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That was at the interview on the Saturday morning November\r\n23?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you think it of sufficient significance to bring it\r\nto the attention of any of the other interviewing FBI agents on the\r\nbalance of the interviews you have described?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; I did on the following Sunday to the agents who\r\ninterviewed me where I worked.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about the following Sunday?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, at this time I move for the admission\r\ninto evidence of the three exhibits which we have shown this witness.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. They may be admitted.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Exhibits Nos. 356, 357, and 358. That completes our\r\nquestioning, Your Honor.\r\n\r\n(The documents referred to were marked Commission's Exhibits Nos. 356,\r\n357, and 358 for identification and admitted into evidence.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Senator Cooper, have you any questions?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You said earlier that you had been much interested in\r\nand pursued studies in sounds, I believe?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I have studied quite a bit of electronics, sound. Math and\r\nscience is what I like.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You said you had read books on this subject. Did you\r\never conduct any experiments yourself?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; in the form of--there is a theory that sound is a\r\nbasis of a transmitter and a receiver, that you have to have a receiver\r\nto have sound. There is a theory that if a tree falls down in the\r\nmiddle of a forest and there is nobody around where they can hear it,\r\nthere is no sound.\r\n\r\nWell, I have conducted experiments on this, and I--it is very\r\ninteresting, very fascinating, but you can't prove it or you can't\r\ndisprove it because if you have got a microphone there you have got a\r\nreceiver.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you ever conduct any experiments with rifles,\r\nfiring a rifle in relation to sound?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; in a firing range.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Beg pardon?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Firing range.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I did conduct a few experiments. One of them was firing a\r\nbullet over water; you know, we were using a set of wood blocks to fire\r\ninto, so we had a big vat of water that we were firing over, and we\r\nhad several different articles and composition floating on the water,\r\ntrying to measure the effect of the sound wave upon that. Such as this\r\nwe did conduct.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I think you did say that when you heard the first\r\nreport that you considered it to be a rifle shot?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. I did, but almost immediately everyone started laughing\r\nso I did not give it any further consideration until the second shot,\r\nsecond report.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. At the time you saw a man standing near a window in the\r\nTexas School Book Depository with a rifle, can you state whether there\r\nwere any, did you know whether or not any police officers were near you?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. There was an officer about 20 feet to my left.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you see any others?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. There were officers all over, that was the closest one.\r\nThere were four or five on the block across the street from me, two of\r\nthem being with the boy who had the epileptic fit.\r\n\r\nThere was also an officer in front of the doors to that building.\r\nThere were several on the corners. I would say there were 20 uniformed\r\nofficers right there in that 1-1/2-block area.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Could any of the officers that you saw whose position\r\nyou noted, have seen this window from the place where they were\r\nstanding?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. They could have; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You don't remember whether any of them were looking up\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No; I don't remember whether they were. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did it occur to you that you should speak to the\r\nofficer about seeing a man in the window?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. It has. Do you ever have reoccurring dreams, sir?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Do you ever have reoccurring dreams?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. This is a reoccurring dream of mine, sir, all the time,\r\nwhat if I had told someone about it. I knew about it enough in advance\r\nand perhaps it could have been prevented. I mean this is something\r\nwhich shakes me up at times.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I don't want to disturb you about that but my point was\r\nat the time did you--I think you said, though, you thought that he was\r\na--he could have been a--Secret Service man, officer.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. Yes; that is right.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. That is all.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Anything further, Congressman Ford?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Rowland, have you ever had occasion to go back\r\nto the scene and reconstruct it? Have you ever gone back----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Supposing we take a few minutes recess.\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. The answer to that question is yes; I do all the time. I\r\npass that area very frequently.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Any other questions, gentlemen, Mr. Wright?\r\n\r\nMr. WRIGHT. No, Your Honor.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Very well, Mr. Rowland, I want to thank you for coming\r\nhere and cooperating with the Commission. I know that this is a matter\r\nthat recalls very sordid thoughts to your mind, and I can see how you\r\nwould be somewhat distressed about it but you have been very frank and\r\ncooperative with us and I appreciate it.\r\n\r\nWe will take a short recess.\r\n\r\n(Short recess.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF JAMES RICHARD WORRELL, JR.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right.\r\n\r\nWill you raise your right hand and be sworn, please?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before this\r\nCommission will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Will you be seated, please.\r\n\r\nMr. Worrell, the purpose of today's hearing is to hear the testimony of\r\nArnold Louis Rowland, Amos Lee Evins, yourself, and Robert Jackson, who\r\nwere in the vicinity of the assassination scene on November 22, 1963.\r\nThe Commission proposes to ask you and the other witnesses for facts\r\nconcerning your knowledge of the assassination of the President.\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Specter, will you proceed with the examination.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. James Richard Worrell, Jr.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Senator, will you preside while I answer a phone call to\r\nanother member of the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER.

How long did you live in California?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I am not exactly sure. I was a little bitty old thing and\r\nI think it was 2 or 3 years.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where did you move from California?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. From California we moved to Abilene, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Abilene, Tex.?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have you lived in Texas since that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your marital status?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Sir?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER.

And how much schooling have you had?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Eleven years.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When did you end your schooling, if you have ended it?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I ended it October of this year, I quit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What school were you going to at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Thomas Jefferson.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. High school?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. High school; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Located in Dallas, Tex.?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were you in the 11th grade or had you completed the\r\n11th grade?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I was a senior.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How were your grades in school?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Average.\r\n\r\n(The Chief Justice entered the hearing room at this point.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How were you occupied or employed back on November 22,\r\n1963?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I was in school then. I skipped school to go there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You were attending Jefferson High School on that day or\r\nwere enrolled at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I was enrolled but I hadn't been going since October.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any special reason for your not going since\r\nOctober?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had you been employed anywhere from the time you stopped\r\ngoing to school?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir. I was employed for El Capitan Oil Drilling out\r\nin Kermit, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What sort of work were you doing for them?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I was a floor man on a derrick.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you say floor man?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On November 22, 1963, were you working on that day for\r\nyour employer?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No. I didn't start this oil job until--it was the last of\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Of 1964?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are you working for them at the present time?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Whom are you working for now?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I am not employed now.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then going back to November 22, 1963, you had no job at\r\nthat time?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you attend school that day at all?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you outline for us briefly what your activities were\r\nfrom the time you awakened until about noon time on November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, I got up about, well, I got up at my usual time,\r\nabout 6:30. I was going to go to school that day but I decided to go\r\nsee the President and my mother left about 7:30, and my sister left\r\nabout a quarter of 8. I left about 8, and hitchhiked down to Love Field\r\nand got there. It took me quite a while to get there, about 9, and just\r\nmessed around there until the President come in, whatever time that\r\nwas. And then I didn't get to see him good at all. So, I caught a bus\r\nand went over, went downtown and I just, I don't know, happened to\r\npick that place at the Depository, and I stood at the corner of Elm and\r\nHouston.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you leave Love Field before the President did?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why did you happen to leave Love Field before he left?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, so I could see him better.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Couldn't you get a good view of him at Love Field?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No, I just saw him off the plane and I figured that I\r\nwasn't going to see him good so I was going to get a better place to\r\nsee him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How did you travel from Love Field down to Elm and Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Bus. No, no; I just traveled so far on the bus. I went\r\ndown to Elm, and took a bus from there. I went down as far as, I don't\r\nknow where that bus stops, anyway I got close to there and I walked the\r\nrest of the way.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time, to the best of your recollection, did you\r\narrive at the intersection of Elm and Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, about 10, 10:30, 10:45, something around there.\r\nThere weren't many people standing around there then.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, about how long before the Presidential motorcade\r\ncame to Elm and Houston did you get there?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. An hour; an hour and a half.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you sure you were at Love Field when the President\r\narrived there?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Now I am going to show you a photograph which I\r\nhave marked as Commission Exhibit No. 359. Take a look at that, if you\r\nwould, please, and tell us whether or not you can identify what scene\r\nthat is?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, this is Elm, Pacific, and Commerce. This is the\r\nDepository right here, and this is Stemmons, and this is the way the\r\nPresident come down.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So is that the assassination scene itself?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now take a look at that picture and tell us where you\r\nwere standing--and I will give you a pencil so you can mark it on that\r\npicture itself--at the time the Presidential motorcade came by. Mark\r\nit with an \"X,\" if you would, just exactly where you were standing, as\r\nbest as you can recollect it, at this moment, at the time the President\r\nwent by.\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Right underneath that window right there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, how close were you standing to this building which I\r\nwill ask you to identify; first of all, what building is that?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. That is the Texas Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nNow how close to that building were you standing?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I was, I don't know, 4 or 5 feet out from it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you standing with your face to the building, with\r\nyour back to the building, or how?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. My back was to the building.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I show you a photograph which has been identified as\r\nCommission Exhibit 360 and I will ask you if you can identify what that\r\nbuilding is?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. That is the Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nNow on this picture will you again, with an \"X,\" mark where you were\r\nstanding as closely as you can recollect it.\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. That car is in the way.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Put the mark then right above where the car is,\r\nindicating where you were standing on the sidewalk near that building.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, did you observe the President's motorcade come by?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Describe to us what you saw, heard, and observed at that\r\ntime, as the motorcade came by.\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, I saw him--I was standing looking--I don't know my\r\ndirections very well; anyway, I was looking down towards Elm Street\r\nwatching him come, and they filed by me----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On which street were you watching them come?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. This way.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Look at Exhibit 359 and pick out which street they were on?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. They were coming down this way, so on and so forth.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, now, were they coming down Elm Street or were they\r\ncoming down Main Street with a right-hand turn on to Houston Street\r\nwith a curve on Houston down Elm, recollect it if you can?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. That is right. They did turn around.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did they come down----\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I didn't see him up there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was the President's motorcade at the time you first\r\nsaw it?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Oh, about right in here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Proceeding in this direction, indicating in a generally\r\nnortherly direction on Houston Street, right?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, north.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then tell us what the President's motorcade did?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. It turned and went down this way.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Made a left-hand or right-hand turn?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Left-hand turn.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did it pass right by in front of where you were standing?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Within a hundred feet, I guess.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to get a pretty good view of the President's\r\nmotorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right; go ahead and tell us.\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Didn't get too good a view of the President either, I\r\nmissed out on there too. But as they went by, they got, oh at least\r\nanother 50, 75 feet on past me, and then I heard the shots.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many shots did you hear?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Four.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe anything at about that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir, I looked up and saw the rifle, but I would say\r\nabout 6 inches of it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where did you see the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I am not going--I am not too sure but I told the FBI it\r\nwas either in the fifth or the sixth floor on the far corner, on the\r\neast side.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now looking at the picture which we have identified as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 360, which is where you have drawn an \"X,\" can\r\nyou indicate the line of vision which you followed to the point where\r\nthe rifle was to the best of your ability to recollect?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, when I heard the first shot it was too loud to be\r\na firecracker, I knew that, because there was quite a big boom, and I\r\ndon't know, just out of nowhere, I looked up like that, just straight\r\nup.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating you looked straight back over your head,\r\nraising your head to look over your body at the 90 degree angle?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes; and I saw it for the second time and I looked back to\r\nthe motorcade.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I saw about 6 inches of the gun, the rifle. It had--well\r\nit had a regular long barrel but it had a long stock and you could only\r\nsee maybe 4 inches of the barrel, and I could see----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to observe any of the stock?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How much of the stock were you able to observe?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Just very little, just about 2 inches.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many inches of the barrel then could you observe\r\nprotruding beyond the stock?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. About 4 inches, I would say, not very much.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, at the time of the second shot were you able to\r\nobserve anything at that precise instant?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. You mean as to firing it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As to anything at all. What did you see when the second\r\nshot went off?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, I looked to see where he was aiming and after the\r\nsecond shot and I have seen the President slumping down in the seat,\r\nand----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see the President slump in his seat after the\r\nsecond shot?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Uh, huh. And about that----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you look up and see the rifle between the first and\r\nthe second shots?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir. And saw the firing on the second and then before\r\nhe could get a shot I was--I took in everything but especially the car,\r\nthe President's car, and saw him slumping, and I looked up again and\r\nturned around and started running and saw it fire a third time, and\r\nthen----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When did you see it fire a third time, when you looked up,\r\nthe time you just described?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. When I was, I did it all in one motion, I looked up,\r\nturned around and ran, pivoted.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you hear, if anything, after that?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Just a lot of commotion, everybody was screaming and\r\nsaying \"duck.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. After the third shot, did you hear a fourth shot?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Oh, yes. Just as I got to the corner of Exhibit 360, I\r\nheard the fourth shot.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, did these four shots come close together or how\r\nwould you describe the timing in general on those?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Succession.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were they very fast?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. They were right in succession.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now going back to the position of the rifle which you\r\ntestified that you saw, you say it was either on the fifth or sixth\r\nfloor?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there any way you can tell us which floor it was on, or\r\nwould the angle of your observation permit you to be sure it was the\r\nfifth or sixth floors?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I am not going to say I am positive, but that one there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right, would you mark that one----\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Because that right there, I feel, would have obstructed my\r\nvision but I said it was either on the fifth or sixth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, now, will you mark with a \"Y\" the window which you\r\nhave just pointed to?\r\n\r\n(At this point Chief Justice Warren departed the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. A \"Y?\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. A \"Y.\"\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You have marked the \"Y\" over two windows. Was it the\r\nwindow--which window was it there as best you can recollect, as between\r\nthose two?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I didn't mean to bring it down that far but this one.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you put an arrow then at the window that you have\r\njust indicated, was the one where the rifle was protruding from?\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, the sum of it is you are not sure whether it was the\r\nfifth or the sixth floor, but you believe it was on the floor where you\r\nhave marked a \"Y\" which is the sixth floor and that was the line of\r\nvision as you looked straight up over your head?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where did you run, which is what you have just described\r\nthat you did next?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, a better view of it is here in 360. I ran down\r\nHouston Street alongside the building and then crossed over the street,\r\nI ran alongside the building and crossed over, and in 359, I was\r\nstanding over here, and I saw this man come bustling out of this door.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Before you get to that, Mr. Worrell, let me show you a\r\ndiagram which has been prepared here, which may be of some assistance\r\nto you in telling us your movements in running. I will mark this as\r\nCommission Exhibit 361 and ask Mr. David Belin, Staff Counsel, to make\r\na statement as to the preparation of this exhibit for the record.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The record will show that Exhibit 361 was prepared in the\r\nexhibit section of the Federal Bureau of Investigation by Inspector\r\nLeo. J. Gauthier and Eugene Paul Airy, exhibit specialist, with the\r\nassistance of Charles D. Musser, illustrator, with particular reference\r\nto showing the Texas School Book Depository Building, and the immediate\r\narea with relation to the parking lot that employees used.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Worrell, take a good look at this. Study it for just\r\na moment in order to get your bearings on this particular map. This\r\nis the Texas School Book Depository Building designated as such. This\r\nis Houston Street and this is the direction I am indicating that the\r\nmotorcade, as you have described from the other exhibit, came from, a\r\ngenerally northerly direction. This is generally north, and it made the\r\nleft-hand turn which you have already described for the record, onto\r\nElm Street Parkway going down the front there.\r\n\r\nNow perhaps the best place to start on this is with this red pencil, to\r\nput a small \"X\" where you were standing on this map.\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Where I was standing?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where you were standing.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now will you describe your movement in running as you had\r\nstarted to a few moments ago, indicating with a line of the red pencil\r\njust exactly where you went and describe it as you go along.\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, as I said on the third shot I was looking up and\r\npivoting and turning to run at the same time. When I got here I heard\r\nthe fourth shot.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating that you were at that point right at the corner\r\nof the building on Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Making a turn.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Having moved slightly to your left, and beginning to make\r\na turn to go in a generally northerly direction on Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I thought that was north.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. No, this is north, there is a symbol showing which is\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Okay. Then I turned the corner, went right down beside the\r\nbuilding on the sidewalk and when I got to the corner----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Corner of what?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Of this building.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Of the Texas School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you do there?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Cut directly across, kind of at an angle.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Across Houston Street as you have drawn the red line there?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, and I rested there, I was out of breath, I smoke too\r\nmuch, short winded.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you mark that \"Y\" where you stopped and rested and\r\ntell us how long you stopped there?\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. How long?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I was there approximately 3 minutes before I saw this man\r\ncome out the back door here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nNow will you put a \"Z\" where you first saw the man whom you have just\r\ndescribed or mentioned?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. It is here I am pretty sure, I am not positive.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You are pretty sure--but you can't be positive--but you\r\nare pretty sure?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Okay. Now, describe as best you can the man whom you have\r\ntestified you saw at point \"Z.\"\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Describe his appearance?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes. Start by telling us how tall he was, to the best of\r\nyour ability to recollect and estimate?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. To the--it is going to be within 3 inches, 5-7 to 5-10.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate as to his weight?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. 155 to 165.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate as to his height?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. 5-7, 5-10.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Pardon me, your best estimate as to his age.\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, the way he was running, I would say he was in his\r\nlate twenties or middle--I mean early thirties. Because he was fast\r\nmoving on.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Of what race was he?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. White.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you describe the characteristics of his hair?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Black.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he have----\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, I will say brunette.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he have a full head of hair, a partial head of hair,\r\nor what?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, see, I didn't see his face, I just saw the back\r\nof his head and it was full in the back. I don't know what the front\r\nlooked like. But it was full in the back.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What clothes did the man have on?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Dark, like a jacket like that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating a dark gray jacket?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No, no. It was a jacket like that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. A suit jacket?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Or was it a sports jacket?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Sports jacket.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did not have on matching coat and trousers?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was it dark in color or light?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. It was dark in color. I don't know whether it was blue,\r\nblack, or brown, but it was dark, and he had light pants. And that is\r\nall I can say on his clothes, except his coat was open and kind of\r\nflapping back in the breeze when he was running.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, are there any other distinguishing characteristics\r\nthat you can describe about him?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Not a thing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did he----\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. He wasn't holding nothing when he was running. He was just\r\nrunning.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe him do, if anything?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, when he ran out here, he ran along the side of the\r\nDepository Building and then when he got----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Make a dotted line as to where he went, or take this black\r\npencil and make a line as to where he went.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where did you see him eventually go?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, he went on further.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that the last you saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did something come between you and him so that your\r\nvision was obstructed?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As of the point you have just dotted out there?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What obstructed your view of him at that juncture or at\r\nthat point?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I can't really be sure, it was a building, but the type of\r\nbuilding, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. During the course of your seeing him, did you ever get a\r\nview of his face?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Oh, no, no.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. What did you do next, Mr. Worrell?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, I went on down this way and headed up back to Elm\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating you went on down to Pacific?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And then proceeded----\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No, no; that is wrong. I went on Pacific and----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Just a minute. You proceeded from point \"Y\" on in a\r\ngenerally northerly direction to Pacific and then in what direction did\r\nyou go on Pacific, this would be in an easterly direction?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I went east.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You went in an easterly direction how many blocks down\r\nPacific?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I went down to Market and from Market I went on Ross.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You went left on Market down to Ross, and then?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. From Ross I went all the way to Ervay.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where were you heading for at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. For the bus stop near my mother's office. And I rode the\r\nbus from there out to the school and hitchhiked the rest of the way to\r\nFarmers Branch.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. When did you first report to any official what\r\nyou had seen and heard on this occasion?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, I turned the TV on early next morning to see what\r\nhad happened, and Chief Curry was making a plea----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Is that going to become a part of the evidence at this\r\npoint?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Chief Curry was making a plea for anyone who had seen the\r\nshooting, would they please come down and make a statement. So I called\r\nthe Farmer Branch police, and told them, and they come and picked me\r\nup, and they called the Dallas police, and they come way out there and\r\npicked me up and took me downtown to make a statement and brought me\r\nback home.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Worrell, before we leave this Exhibit 361, are you\r\nable to testify as to the accuracy of the scale drawing here which\r\nrepresents the part of it that you have testified about, specifically\r\nthe presence of the Texas School Book Depository Building on the\r\nnorthwest corner of Elm and Houston. Is that the accurate location of\r\nthat building?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is it an accurate reproduction of the intersection of\r\nElm and Houston leading into the parkway on Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. As far as this?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As far as all the parts you have testified about Elm and\r\nHouston. Is it accurate that Pacific is one block in the northerly\r\ndirection away from Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And Ross is another block, generally, in a northerly\r\ndirection away from Pacific?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No, Ross is over here. This is Record Street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, first there is Elm, then there is Pacific, and then\r\nthere is Ross. Is that much accurate as the map shows it to be, is that\r\nthe way the streets are laid out?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I think so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about the general width of Houston Street in relation\r\nto the general width of the Texas School Depository Building, is that\r\nabout right?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I don't know, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right, that is fine.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that we have marked Exhibit 361, Mr. Chairman, I would\r\nlike to use the next number in sequence, No. 362 to mark the other half\r\nof this same exhibit which is designated Texas School Book Depository\r\nfloor plan of the first floor, which we will not use at this time, but\r\nI would like to mark it in sequence.\r\n\r\nAnd at this time I ask that Commission Exhibits Nos. 359, 360, 361, and\r\n362 be admitted into evidence.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. So ordered. Let those exhibits be admitted as part of\r\nthe evidence.\r\n\r\n(The documents referred to, heretofore marked Commission Exhibits Nos.\r\n359, 360, 361, and 362 were admitted into evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Worrell, you had told us that you heard a plea by\r\nChief of Police Curry for all witnesses to come forward.\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And you heard that plea on the 23d of November?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. It was on Saturday.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What action, if any, did you take in response to that\r\nrequest?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I called on the phone to the Farmers Branch police.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You called who?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. The Farmers Branch police.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I see. And what did you do then?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, I told them what I had seen and they said, \"Well,\r\nstay there and we will come and get you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did they come and get you?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Oh, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you then tell the police what you had seen and heard?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I told a Lt. Butler what I had seen, and I don't know\r\nif--they placed the call into the Dallas police and something like an\r\nhour later they came to pick me up there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you make a statement or take an affidavit on what you\r\nhad seen and heard?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. To the Dallas police?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Oh, yes, sir. I made a statement and signed five of them.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I will show you a paper which is marked Commission Exhibit\r\n363 which purports to be an affidavit bearing your signature.\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Let me ask you first of all if that is your signature?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And would you take just a minute, take your time and read\r\nthat affidavit over, please.\r\n\r\nHave you had a chance to read that over, Mr. Worrell?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you tell us that you signed five different statements\r\nor five copies of the same statement?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Five copies of the same statement.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is this the statement which you signed in affidavit form\r\nat that time?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And----\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As you have just--have you had time to read it over just\r\nnow?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that statement accurate based on your current\r\nrecollection of the event?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. It is accurate down to, well, I changed my height to 5-8\r\nfrom 5-7.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Aside from that minor variation, is it accurate in its\r\nentirety; that is, is it all accurate?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, I left out, when I was making my affidavit, I left\r\nout, while I was running I heard a gun fire two more times. Well, as I\r\ntold you, I was turning the corner when I heard it and saw it fire the\r\nthird time, and then the fourth.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, are there any other additions or modifications\r\nthat you would like to make from the contents of your statement in\r\naccordance with your recollection at this moment?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I can't verify that--the time they got here because I am\r\nnot too sure of that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You are not sure of that now?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nAre there any other modifications that you would want to make in the\r\ncontents of the statement?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Leave out firecracker. It sounded, it was too loud for a\r\nfirecracker.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Your current recollection is that it was too loud for a\r\nfirecracker?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there any other respect in which your current\r\nrecollection differs from this affidavit?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Instead of looking I ran, I looked up.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there any other respect in which your current\r\nrecollection differs from the affidavit?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, I left out on the barrel of the rifle, I left out\r\npart of the stock. I didn't recollect that at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there any other aspect in which your current\r\nrecollection differs from the facts set forth in this affidavit?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, everything else is O.K.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate as to the length of time\r\nbetween the first shot and the last shot which you heard?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. The best estimate 5, 6 seconds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you talked to, been interviewed by or given a\r\nstatement to any Federal agent?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. The FBI down at Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many times have you seen the FBI agents?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Once.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recollect the names of the agents you saw?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recollect when it was that you saw those agents?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. It was on that Saturday, the 23d.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where were you when you saw them?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. In the Dallas Police Station.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long did that interview last?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Thirty minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you sign a statement for them?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I just signed it for the Dallas police. They didn't have\r\nme sign anything.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you been interviewed by any other Federal agent or\r\nrepresentative?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, Mr. Sorrels interviewed me when he called me and\r\nasked me some questions when he called me up Wednesday night, I guess\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that in relationship to your coming here to this\r\nCommission hearing?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What sort of questions did Mr. Sorrels ask you?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. What I saw. And I told him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that just on the telephone?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long did that conversation last?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Not very long. He talked to my mother first. He talked to\r\nher for 15 minutes, something like this.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he talking to her about what you saw or about travel\r\narrangements to get you here?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I don't know. I was watching television, I didn't know\r\neven who she was talking to.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Aside from that conversation with Mr. Sorrels\r\nand the interview you have had with the FBI, have you ever talked with\r\nany agent or representative of the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you talked to any police official of Dallas or the\r\nState of Texas after you gave this affidavit?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Based on seeing only the back of this man, were you ever\r\nable to make any identification of him?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, I move for the admission into evidence of\r\nthe other exhibit which we have used with Mr. Worrell being Commission\r\nExhibit No. 362.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. The exhibit will be admitted to evidence.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 362 for\r\nidentification and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That concludes our questions.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You stated that, I believe, you looked up after you had\r\nheard the first report?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You looked up and saw the barrel of a rifle, and then\r\nthe rifle fired. What made you know that it fired?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Pardon?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. How did you know it was fired when you were looking at\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Well, I saw what you might call a little flame and smoke.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You saw something that came out of the barrel?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Were you looking at it when you heard the third report?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir, looking at it, turning around and started to run.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you see anything then?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Same thing, a little flash of fire and then smoke. I\r\ndidn't see it on the fourth one.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you only look at the car in which the President was\r\nriding one time when you said you saw him slump?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you look back at the President's car then?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No, sir. I didn't do that because I mean I didn't know if\r\nthere was one or more guns, because I wondered why if it was in such\r\nrapid succession being a bolt action, I found out later, and I didn't\r\nknow what was coming off, so I was running to the back of the building\r\nbecause I figured that would be the safest place.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you see anyone in the windows, in the Texas\r\nDepository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you notice where this man you have described later\r\nas running away from the building, did you see him come out of the\r\nbuilding?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Where?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. At the back entrance. Approximately where I put the mark\r\n\"Z.\"\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was he running all the time you saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Yes, sir, he sure was.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. That is all.\r\n\r\nMr. WRIGHT. Prior to hearing the first shot, had you looked up at the\r\nSchool Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No, sir; I sure didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. WRIGHT. That is all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to observe the direction of the barrel which\r\nyou have described?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. Pointing right down at the motorcade.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Any special part of the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I mean, I couldn't really say that because it was too high\r\nup and he could have been pointing at anyone of the cars. I mean I\r\ncouldn't tell from where I was standing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was it on the part of the motorcade which had turned down\r\nElm Street or on the part of the motorcade that was still on Houston or\r\nwhat?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. It was the part that was turned down Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Worrell, we have a report of the Federal Bureau of\r\nInvestigation which contains a purported interview with you, designated\r\nas report of Robert P. Gemberling dated November 30, 1963, which has\r\nthis statement:\r\n\r\n\"He\"--referring to you--\"stated that last night when he saw photographs\r\nof Lee Harvey Oswald on television he felt this was the person he had\r\nseen running away from the building. He stated this person did not look\r\nback but he was certain this was a white person since he had a profile\r\nview.\"\r\n\r\nMy question, first of all, to you: Did you have a profile view of the\r\nman who ran away from the building that you described?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The second question is, did you tell the FBI that you had\r\na profile view?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No, sir, I sure didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you tell the FBI agent who interviewed you, that you\r\nfelt that this person was Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. I don't know if I did or not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see anyone else leave the building, that is the\r\nTexas School Book Depository Building, except the man you have already\r\ndescribed to us?\r\n\r\nMr. WORRELL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Are there any further questions? I believe we will\r\nstand in recess until 2 o'clock.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 1:10 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfternoon Session\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF AMOS LEE EUINS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission reconvened at 2:15 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will come to order.\r\n\r\nAmos, will you stand up, please, and raise your right hand?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you will give before this\r\nCommission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You may be seated. How old are you?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Sixteen.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, should we start by reading the purpose?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes. I think you received a copy of this statement. But I\r\njust want to say to you that the purpose of today's hearing is to hear\r\nthe testimony of Arnold Louis Rowland, James Richard Worrell, Robert\r\nH. Jackson, and yourself who were in the vicinity of the assassination\r\nscene on November 22, 1963. The Commission proposes to ask you facts\r\nconcerning your knowledge of the assassination of President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nYou understand that?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you tell us your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Amos Lee Euins.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your exact date of birth, Amos?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. January 10, 1948.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. January 10, 1948?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are you a school boy at the present time?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What school do you go to?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Franklin D. Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What grade are you in at that school?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. The ninth.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you live with your parents, Amos?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How is your health generally?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I guess it is all right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How are your eyes?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. They are all right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you see good at a distance?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, I can see good at a distance, but I can't see at real\r\nclose range.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you able to read without glasses?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You don't use glasses for any purposes, then?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say you have trouble at close range, just what do\r\nyou mean by that?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. You know, like I put something on real close.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating about 4 or 5 inches from your eyes?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir. And then they kind of get dim. But on a long\r\nscene, I can see good.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How are your grades in school, Amos?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. They are all right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are they better than average, or what?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. They are about average.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nGoing back to November 22, 1963, that is last year, Amos, do you recall\r\nwhat you were doing early on that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir. When I first got up, I went to school. Then about\r\n11:30, well, the teachers called us and told us the ones that wanted\r\nto go downtown to see the President come down to the office and get an\r\nexcuse and they could go. So I went down to the office, and I got an\r\nexcuse, so I went downtown.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what time did you leave school?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. 11:30.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where did you go from your school?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Downtown.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What part of downtown?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Right over by the county jail.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know the names of those streets, Amos?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. If I told you they were Elm and Houston, would that help\r\nyour memory as to what the names of those streets were?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. It was right by the freeway.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Let me show you a photograph, Amos, which is on\r\na document I have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 365.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 365 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Take just a minute and look at that, and see if you can\r\nrecognize where that is.\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. This is going across the railroad tracks, back up to\r\nhere--right here at the corner is the Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That is the Book Depository Building, you say?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nWhy don't you just put an \"X\" with this pencil on the Book Depository\r\nBuilding, as you identify it there, Amos--on the building itself.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, were you somewhere in that area when the President's\r\nmotorcade went by?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I was right here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why don't you take this black pencil and put an \"A\" right\r\nwhere you were, Amos.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, what time did you get to the place where you have\r\nmarked with an \"A\"?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Oh, I would say around about 15 minutes or something like\r\nthat to 12, because my mother brought me down there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. She drove you down, did she?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, were you with anybody when you came to that spot, or\r\ndid your mother leave you off there by yourself?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. She left me. She had to go on to work.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, about how long was it after you got there that the\r\nmotorcade came by?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Oh, I would say about--I had been there about 15, maybe 20\r\nminutes. It come around the corner, come on around.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nAmos, I want to show you another picture here that I have marked as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 366.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 366 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I ask you if you can recognize what that building is.\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. This here is the Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nNow, look back over here at 365. Can you tell us which direction the\r\nPresident's motorcade came from on this picture?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. It come from right in here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. First of all, do you know what the name of this street is?\r\nWould that be Main Street, in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir; I think so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Coming down Main Street, indicating in a general westerly\r\ndirection. Turning which way?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. This way.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Turned right.\r\n\r\nDo you know if that is Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Let the record show the witness is identifying a street\r\nheretofore identified as Houston.\r\n\r\nThen which way did the motorcade go after proceeding in a general\r\nnortherly direction on Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. It come this way, turn.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which way--right or left?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. It turned to the left, coming down, going on.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know the name of the street it turned onto when it\r\nmade the left turn?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I was just trying to keep an eye on the President.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The witness has identified a street heretofore identified\r\nas Elm Street.\r\n\r\nTell us what you saw as the motorcade went by.\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I was standing here on the corner. And then the President\r\ncome around the corner right here. And I was standing here. And I was\r\nwaving, because there wasn't hardly no one on the corner right there\r\nbut me. I was waving. He looked that way and he waved back at me. And\r\nthen I had seen a pipe, you know, up there in the window, I thought it\r\nwas a pipe, some kind of pipe.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When had you first seen that thing you just described as a\r\npipe?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Right as he turned the corner here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, exactly where did you see that thing you have\r\ndescribed as a pipe come from. And take a good look now before you tell\r\nus where it was.\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Right here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, will you mark an \"X\" on Exhibit No. 366 where you saw\r\nthe pipe? Mark the exact window, if you can, Amos.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nProceed to tell us what happened, Amos.\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Then I was standing here, and as the motorcade turned the\r\ncorner, I was facing, looking dead at the building. And so I seen this\r\npipe thing sticking out the window. I wasn't paying too much attention\r\nto it. Then when the first shot was fired, I started looking around,\r\nthinking it was a backfire. Everybody else started looking around.\r\nThen I looked up at the window, and he shot again. So--you know this\r\nfountain bench here, right around here. Well, anyway, there is a little\r\nfountain right here. I got behind this little fountain, and then he\r\nshot again.\r\n\r\nSo after he shot again, he just started looking down this, you know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who started looking down that way?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. The man in the window. I could see his hand, and I could see\r\nhis other hand on the trigger, and one hand was on the barrel thing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nNow, at the time the second shot was fired, where were you looking then?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I was still looking at the building, you know, behind\r\nthis--I was looking at the building.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Looking at anything special in the building?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir. I was looking where the barrel was sticking out.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many shots did you hear altogether?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I believe there was four, to be exact.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, where were you looking at the time of the third shot,\r\nif you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. After he shot the first two times, I was just standing\r\nback here. And then after he shot again, he pulled the gun back in\r\nthe window. And then all the police ran back over here in the track\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Slow down just a little bit in what you are telling us.\r\n\r\nWhen the second shot occurred, were you still standing at the point\r\nwhere you marked with an \"A\" on 365?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir. But I was right behind this little----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you a little bit behind of where that \"A\" is?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir; right back here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Let's mark that with a \"B,\" where you were at the time the\r\nsecond shot occurred.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nNow, when the third shot occurred, Amos, let me ask you again, where\r\nwere you looking then?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I was still down here, looking up at the building.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you see in the building?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I seen a bald spot on this man's head, trying to look out\r\nthe window. He had a bald spot on his head. I was looking at the bald\r\nspot. I could see his hand, you know the rifle laying across in his\r\nhand. And I could see his hand sticking out on the trigger part. And\r\nafter he got through, he just pulled it back in the window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see him pull it back in the window?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were you still standing at point B?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When he pulled it back in the window?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I was still behind here, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where were you when you heard what you described as the\r\nfourth shot?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. The first shot I was standing here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now you are referring to 366. Put an \"L\" on 366 where you\r\nwere standing at the first shot.\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Right here.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. And then as I looked up there, you know, he fired another\r\nshot, you know, as I was looking. So I got behind this fountain thing\r\nright in there, at this point B.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At point B on 365?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I got behind there. And then I watched, he did fire again.\r\nThen he started looking down towards my way, and then he fired again.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The question I have for you now is where were you when he\r\nfired on that fourth time.\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I was still behind point B.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You were still at point B when he fired the fourth time?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir. Then he pulled the gun back in the window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see him pull the gun back in the window after the\r\nfourth shot?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes; he just come back like this.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you watch what he did after that?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir; because after he had pulled it back in the window,\r\nI ran this way, and went across the tracks.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nYou start on Exhibit 365, and put the black mark and show us the path\r\nof where you ran on 365.\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I was here at \"B.\"\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I was coming down like this here, and there was a policeman,\r\nyou know there is a little cut you can come through there. There was a\r\npoliceman standing right around here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was the policeman standing? Mark that with point\r\n\"C,\" Amos.\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Right there.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You ran past the policeman standing at point C?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir. You see, I come from point B, and ran here, and\r\ntold the policeman I had seen the shot, because they were looking at\r\nthe railroad tracks. So he put me on the cycle and he went to here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. He put you on the cycle and took you where?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Up to the front of the building.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The Texas School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir; and then he called some more cars. They got all\r\naround the building. And then the policemen came from the tracks, and\r\nthey got around the building.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see the policemen come from the tracks to go\r\naround the building?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. About how many policemen were there, would you say, Amos?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. There was about 14 or something like that. They were coming\r\nfrom the tracks here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know what the name of that policeman was, who was\r\nin that position where you have marked C?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir. He was kind of an old policeman. I ran down and got\r\nhim. And he ran up here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You mean----\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. The Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\nThen he called some more cars. They got all the way around the\r\nbuilding. And then after that, well, he seen another man. Another man\r\ntold him he seen a man run out the back.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know who that man was who said somebody ran out the\r\nback?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir. He was a construction man working back there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you there when the man talked about somebody running\r\nout the back?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir. He said the man had--he said he had kind of bald\r\nspot on his head. And he said the man come back there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know what the name of the man was who told the\r\npolice that someone had run out the back?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. . No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you do next, Amos?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. So then they took me over to the county jail. And that is\r\nwhere I told them what happened. And then they was standing around the\r\nBook Depository Building, and I stayed over there to the jailhouse\r\nabout 6 o'clock. And then they took me home.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did they question you about what happened and what you\r\nobserved on that occasion?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. At the jailhouse?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At the jailhouse.\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nAmos, would you tell us everything that you can remember about what you\r\nsaw about the gun itself?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Well, when I first got here on the corner, the President was\r\ncoming around the bend. That is when--I was looking at the building\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you think it was when you first saw it?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I thought it was a piece of pipe or something sticking out\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did it look like it was a piece of metal to you?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir; just a little round piece of pipe.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. About an inch in diameter, would you say?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how long was the piece of pipe that you saw?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. It was sticking out about that much.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. About 14 or 15 inches?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir. And then after I seen it sticking out, after\r\nawhile, that is when I heard the shot, and everybody started looking\r\naround.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At that time, Amos, did you see anything besides the end\r\nof the pipe?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. For example, you didn't see anything about a stock or any\r\nother part of the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir--not with the first shot. You see, the President was\r\nstill right along down in here somewhere on the first shot.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, when you saw it on the first occasion, did you think\r\nit was a rifle then? Or did that thought enter your mind?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir; I wasn't thinking about it then. But when I was\r\nlooking at it, when he shot, it sounded like a high-powered rifle,\r\nafter I listened to it awhile, because I had been in the NDCC for about\r\na year.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is NDCC?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. We call it a military army for the boys, at our school.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that ROTC?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. ROTC. And have you had any opportunity to fire a weapon in\r\nthat ROTC class?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir; not outside of just .22's. We fire them on the\r\nfiring range.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nNow, when you looked up at the rifle later, you described seeing some\r\nof the trigger part.\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, describe as fully as you can for us what you saw\r\nthen, Amos.\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Well, when he stuck it out, you know--after the President\r\nhad come on down the street further, you know he kind of stuck it out\r\nmore, you know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How far was it sticking out of the window would you say\r\nthen, Amos?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I would say it was about something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating about 3 feet?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. You know--the trigger housing and stock and receiver group\r\nout the window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I can't understand you, Amos.\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. It was enough to get the stock and receiving house and the\r\ntrigger housing to stick out the window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The stock and receiving house?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, what direction was the rifle pointing?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Down--what did you say--Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir; down Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was it pointing in the direction of the President?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, could you see anything else on the gun?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir; I could not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. For example, could you see whether or not there was a\r\ntelescopic lens on the gun?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, is there anything else about the gun that you can\r\ndescribe to us that you have not already told us about?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, what kind of a look, if any, did you have at the man\r\nwho was there?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. All I got to see was the man with a spot in his head,\r\nbecause he had his head something like this.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating his face down, looking down the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir; and I could see the spot on his head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How would you describe that man for us?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I wouldn't know how to describe him, because all I could see\r\nwas the spot and his hand.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he slender or was he fat?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I didn't get to see him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you tell from where you looked whether he was tall\r\nor short?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Of what race was he, Amos?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I couldn't tell, because these boxes were throwing a\r\nreflection, shaded.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you tell whether he was a Negro gentleman or a white\r\nman?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Couldn't even tell that? But you have described that he\r\nhad a bald----\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Spot in his head. Yes, sir; I could see the bald spot in his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, could you tell what color hair he had?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you tell whether his hair was dark or light?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How far back did the bald spot on his head go?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I would say about right along in here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating about 2-1/2 inches above where your hairline\r\nis. Is that about what you are saying?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir; right along in here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, did you get a very good look at that man, Amos?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to tell anything about the clothes he was\r\nwearing?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, when you were at the sheriff's department in the\r\npolice station that you have described, did they ask you to sign an\r\naffidavit or statement for them, Amos?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now show you a paper, Amos, which I have marked as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 367.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 367 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. This is supposed to be a statement which is signed. Let me\r\nfirst point out to you that it is a copy of it. I ask you if this is a\r\ncopy of your signature?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nNow, will you take your time, Amos, and read that over, and then I want\r\nto ask you a couple of questions about it.\r\n\r\nDid you have a chance to read it over?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nLet me ask you about a couple of specific things here, Amos.\r\n\r\nIn the statement you say here that he was a white man. By reading the\r\nstatement, does that refresh your memory as to whether he was a white\r\nman or not?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir; I told the man that I could see a white spot on his\r\nhead, but I didn't actually say it was a white man. I said I couldn't\r\ntell. But I saw a white spot in his head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Your best recollection at this moment is you still don't\r\nknow whether he was a white man or a Negro? All you can say is that you\r\nsaw a white spot on his head?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then, did you tell the people at the police station that\r\nhe was a white man, or did they make a mistake when they wrote that\r\ndown here?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. They must have made a mistake, because I told them I could\r\nsee a white spot on his head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, is there anything else in this statement, Amos, which\r\nis different from the way you remember this event, as you are sitting\r\nhere right now?\r\n\r\nAmos, did you understand the last question?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you answer it for us?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir; I don't think there is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I don't understand you, Amos. The question I am trying to\r\nget at it, as you read that statement over now, you have testified or\r\ntold us here today what you remember about this assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And I am asking you, when you read that statement over,\r\nis there anything on that statement which you think is wrong, based on\r\nwhat you remember right now?\r\n\r\nFor example, you told us that they were wrong when they wrote down that\r\nyou identified him as a white man. Were they wrong about anything else\r\nthat they wrote down?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Not that I can see.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nWhen you looked up and saw this man, Amos, did he have on a hat?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you notice any boxes behind him at that time, Amos?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir; there were some boxes, you know, all the side of\r\nthe window. Like this window--there were some boxes in these windows up\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You saw some boxes in these windows?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. In these windows, and these windows, and there was boxes in\r\nhalf of this one.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nNow, mark the windows where you saw those boxes, Amos. Start off\r\nwith--mark the window \"Y\" where you saw boxes.\r\n\r\n(Witness marking.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You made a figure 9, as I read it, on the two places you\r\nsaw boxes in the windows.\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir; in this half.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, were there boxes in the window marked \"X\"?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir. There were about two or three of them right along\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating the middle dividing line there?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that window marked \"X\" opened, Amos, or closed?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. It was open.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How far open was it?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. About that high.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating about 19 inches?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was the window in the other double window immediately\r\nnext to the window marked \"X\" open or closed?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. The top window, on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I am referring to the window right next to it.\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir; it was not open.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Amos, when you heard the first shot, did you have any\r\nreaction or impression as to where the noise was coming from at that\r\nexact time?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir; not at the exact time. You know, because everybody\r\nelse started looking around. So I just started looking around, thinking\r\nit was a backfire, just like everyone else.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you look up towards that window before the second\r\nshot, or just when the second shot occurred?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I think--just a little before, because as soon as I did, I\r\nlooked at it--pow.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You heard a pow?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, as you were watching and heard, did you have the\r\nimpression that the noise you heard was coming from that rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir; I didn't, because I wasn't thinking of the rifle at\r\nfirst--you know, because it looked like a pipe at first.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say the second--when you heard the second shot,\r\nwhen you say you were looking at the rifle, did you have the feeling\r\nthat the noise came from the rifle when you heard the second shot, when\r\nyou were looking at it?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, did you have any impression at all about where the\r\nnoise was coming from?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir; not on the first shot.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about the second shot?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where did you think the noise was coming from on the\r\nsecond shot?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I seen him shoot on the second shot.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So you thought the noise was coming from the rifle on the\r\nsecond shot?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Did you say you thought, or saw?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. I saw him shoot the second shot.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How high were those boxes behind him, Amos?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. They was probably about 2 feet high stacked in the back of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Amos, were you questioned later by the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Yes, sir; over in the office.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many times were you questioned by the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. Oh, once.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you remember when that was?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. It was around about 2 or 3 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you remember how many days after the assassination it\r\nwas?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. About 4.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You think they might have talked to you more than once?\r\n\r\nMr. EUINS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, I move for the admission into evidence\r\nof the statement marked Commission Exhibit 367.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 367 was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That concludes the questioning I have, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Wright?\r\n\r\nMr. WRIGHT. Nothing further, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER.

The Commission will be in order.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I would like to assign Commission Exhibit No. 364 to a paper\r\nsack which the FBI has identified as their C-109 Exhibit. That will be\r\nthe Commission's Exhibit No. 364 for identification at this time.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right.\r\n\r\n(The paper sack referred to was marked Commission's Exhibit No. 364 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Also for the record I would like to announce that prior\r\nto--this morning, Mr. Cortlandt Cunningham and Charles Killion of the\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation laboratory, the Ballistics Division,\r\nFirearms Division, I guess it is, broke down, that is unscrewed\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 139, an Italian rifle, and that rifle has been\r\nplaced in, after being disassembled, has been placed in Commission's\r\nNo. 364 for identification, that paper sack.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. We have also here before the Commission, Commission No. 142\r\nwhich is a paper sack which is identified as the FBI's Exhibit No. 10.\r\nI think that has its number, exhibit number on it.\r\n\r\nI have been informed that was 142.

She was there for, I believe, for a period of about 4 or 5\r\nweeks because my stepfather was with her and he got sick and they had\r\nto put him in the hospital and he was in the hospital 3 or 4 weeks,\r\nsomewheres, 4 or 5 weeks because they were there a week before he got\r\nsick.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then on November 21 and 22, living with you in this residence\r\nat Irving, Tex., were your mother, Mrs. Williams, and your sister,\r\nLinnie Mae Randle?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL.

How long have you worked there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I have been working there since September.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. September of 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of work do you do there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I fill orders.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How did you happen to get that job?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I went to see, first I come up there and started\r\nlooking for a job and couldn't find one myself so I went to one of\r\nthese employment agencies and through that a lady called up one\r\nmorning, I was fixing to go out and look for one, I was looking for\r\nmyself in the meantime when they were, too, and so she called up and\r\ngave me a tip to it if I was interested in a job like that I could go\r\nover there and see about that and for the time being I wasn't working\r\nand needed some money and so I did and I went over there and saw Mr.\r\nTruly, and he gave me an interview, and then he hired me the same day I\r\nwent over there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You say you came up, you mean you came up from Huntsville?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That is right; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was in September 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Looking for a job around Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go to live with your sister at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What--where is the employment agency and what is its name\r\nwhen you first applied for a job?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I went to several but, see, this one got me this job\r\nthe main one was Massey, the employment agency, and it is over there on\r\nShady Grove Road.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; in Irving.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How do you spell that name, the name of the employment agency?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Massey?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I believe it is M-a-s-s-e-y.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And it was a woman at the employment agency that called you\r\nand told you to go to see the Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you went to see Mr. Truly and after an interview he gave\r\nyou a job?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you started work there about what date in September?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It was the 13th. I say that was the same day I went for\r\nan interview. I went early enough that morning that he told me to come\r\nback after lunch.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you are still working there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When Mr. Truly hired you did he tell you it would be a\r\nfull-time job or just a temporary job?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he told me that he was looking for somebody full\r\ntime and I told him, well, that is what I wanted, and so he said that\r\nwould be just fine.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How much did he start to pay you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. He started me off with a dollar and a quarter an hour.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is for an eight-hour day?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right. Five days a week.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you commute back and forth from your sister's home in\r\nIrving?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Over there to the Texas School Books?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. To the Texas School Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. From the first day?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you still do?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you own a car?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Your own car?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You had it, did you, when you started to work?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Still have it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you have been since September driving that car from your\r\nsister's home in Irving over to the Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Go there in the morning?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time do you get to work?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I get there around 8 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When do you quit?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I quit at 4:45.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you drive home?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long for lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do all the employees have the same lunch hour?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Now, the ones who work down there filling book orders\r\naround where I work now, so we all work the same hours. Some people\r\nwork up there in the offices, I hear that they come in a little bit\r\nlater. Now, I don't know for sure but I see primarily the ones who does\r\nthe same type of work I do, we all start the same time and work the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Those are the people who fill the orders?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How far is it in miles from your sister's home to Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It is roughly around 15 miles.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And did you take the same route every day?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. You mean since I have been going over there; since the\r\nfirst day?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Up to now?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes, right.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nYou see, I found two ways, you can more judge by the traffic and you\r\ncan go some days one way and the traffic will be easier than others,\r\nbut most times I use just one route.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What route did you usually use?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Used one like you go down from the house there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Go down and right Storey Road, see Fifth Street is just\r\none block off Storey Road, and just go down and hit Storey Road and\r\nstay on it until you come to Stemmons Freeway and you stay right on\r\nStemmons until you come right on into Dallas there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About what length of time does it take you to go from your\r\nsister's home to work in the morning?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Usually, I usually leave not any later than 7:25. I\r\nusually try to leave about 7:20, and if you leave at 7:20, you usually\r\nget around there, by the time you get down to the parking lot now it is\r\nusually pretty close to 5 minutes to 8 and that gives you enough time\r\nto walk to the Book Depository, put up your lunch and take off your\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you have a place to park your car?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was it assigned to you by Mr. Truly?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he just said we had a parking lot there and\r\nshowed me where it was and said you can park in the parking lot.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was that the parking lot two or three blocks from the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir, it is down there; right across from the\r\nwarehouse there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you would walk from there from that parking lot----\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Up to the other Depository up there at the corner of\r\nHouston and Main.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. We have here a map which has been marked as Commission's\r\nExhibit No. 361.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And north is to the bottom of the map.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Instead of the top, as usually the case.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It has two pictures over here, one to the left and one to the\r\nright of the map.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let's take a look at the picture to the right of the map. Do\r\nyou recognize that area?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I see that is right there where you say that is the street\r\ngoing up to the parking lot there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you recognize this car?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What car is that?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That is my car.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that where you usually park every day?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I would say at the time being when I first started\r\nto work there I first started to park there but now I park on the other\r\nside of the fence there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But that is a picture of the parking lot, is it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where you park is in the parking lot?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir. I park inside the fence but what I am talking\r\nabout--I park on the different side of the lot.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Different side of the same lot?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; we just have one lot there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you see the Texas School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; right there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you walked from about the place where your car is parked?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Usually up to the Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right, correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, the map to the left, upper left-hand corner of the map,\r\nthere is a picture.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you see this area where I point my finger which is marked\r\n\"parking lot No. 1.\"\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is that?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That is the same parking lot we were looking at right here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What route do you walk, which way do you walk when you park\r\nin this parking lot No. 1, to the Texas School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Do you want me to get up to where I can show it to you?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes; show it to us.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I usually always come up, you know, you can come right,\r\nyou see the building right down here, and you notice a series of\r\nrailroad tracks, so usually early in the morning, now about 8 o'clock\r\nthere is usually not any cars right here, but I say they are switching\r\nback and forth.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. By \"cars\" you mean railroad cars?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; they usually start switching around 8 o'clock.\r\nUsually, there are not any cars, it is usually a long train that moves\r\nup pretty soon but I usually move up in this direction here, especially\r\nwhen it is dry. When it is wet I walk on this because it is harder. But\r\nwhen it is raining, I usually walk around here, because in this area\r\nright here, when you get up closer to the railroad tracks it has more\r\ntrenches, and it gets muddy and slimy and you can get bogged down.\r\n\r\nSo, when it is bad weather, I usually walk on this side. But I say nine\r\ntimes out of ten I come up right down here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let's look at the map. Here is the parking lot here, is that\r\nthe parking lot where you usually park?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This is parking lot No. 1.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That is parking lot No. 1, isn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. We will show you this map later, but just to illustrate, how\r\ndo you usually, what is the route you usually take, just show us on\r\nthe board here, the route you usually take to the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building in the morning?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. You mean when I am coming off of the freeway?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. After you park here.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. You know right here, you say like the car, you notice that\r\nlittle house right there, I assume you have checked off. You know like\r\nI was telling you now. I usually park over in this corner. But at the\r\ntime I parked right there. But anyway, there is a little cyclone fence\r\nand this was the series of railroad tracks, I was talking to you about.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I usually come down here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Munger Street?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That is right, and usually cross along the railroad tracks\r\nand come up here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Houston runs into it, now they are doing some work across\r\nthe tracks and you can't go any further than the tracks, right along\r\nhere this line, cyclone, but that type of fence and I usually walk\r\nright up, you know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. To the buildings?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And enter the rear of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nNow, we call it a loading zone out there, dock area.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Fine.\r\n\r\nDid anyone else ride with you in the morning, usually did anyone else\r\nride with you in the morning from home to work?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; they didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did anybody ride with you from work to home?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; they didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When did you first hear of Lee Harvey Oswald, first hear the\r\nname?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I first heard, I never really did know his name, we just\r\ncalled him Lee around there. But the first time I ever saw him was the\r\nfirst day he come to work.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had you heard he was coming to work before he came to work?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I will say, you know, talking back and forth with the\r\nbossman all the time and from being around and getting along real fine\r\nand so he told me, I assume the day after he hired him that he was\r\ngoing to have him come in on Monday and he asked me had I ever seen him\r\nand I told him then no; I had never seen him.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had your sister told you that this fellow Lee was coming to\r\nwork?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; she did. She said one afternoon when I went home she\r\ntold me she found out from one of the neighbors there he came over for\r\nthat interview with Mr. Truly and Mr. Truly had hired him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You heard that from your sister?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Before you saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right, before I saw him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you first saw him was it a Monday morning?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you have any idea of the date itself, do you have any\r\nmemory of the date when you first saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was it sometime around the middle of October, do you think,\r\nwould that be close to it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It could have been because it was sometime in October\r\nbecause I remember I went to work there on the 13th and I had been\r\nworking there, 4 or 5 weeks and then he come there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where was he when you first saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I first saw him he was--we have a table not as large as\r\nthis, but just about half as large as this, and we have just like you\r\nwalk up to it where I am sitting over here and we have four or five\r\nboxes there and we have different names on it, you know, for different\r\npublishing companies, and he was there getting some orders, and I say,\r\nas well as I remember, I said, the foreman there was getting him out\r\nsome real easy orders. Some of the orders we have are real easy to\r\nfill, easier than the others, you don't have to know so much about the\r\ntextbooks to be able to fill them and he was getting some of them easy\r\nones out to start on, when we have a great number of them, you see, the\r\nlittle pamphlet type books and all we do is count them out and read the\r\ninvoice number.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was the name of the foreman showing him?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. You mean the foreman, that was Mr. Shelly.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. S-h-e-d?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. S-h-e-l-l-y.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Shelly.\r\n\r\nWhat floor was this on?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It was on the first floor there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did Shelly introduce you to him or did you go up and shake\r\nhands with him?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he didn't. I remember, I knew, you know that he\r\nwas going to be coming to work so naturally I hadn't been there very\r\nlong, you know, living in Dallas and so I wanted to make friends with\r\neverybody I could, because you know yourself friendship is something\r\nyou can't buy with money and you always need friends, so I went up and\r\nintroduced himself to myself, and he told me his name was Lee and I\r\nsaid \"We are glad to have you.\"\r\n\r\nWe got talking back and forth and he come to find out I knew his wife\r\nwas staying down there at the time with this other woman and so I\r\nthought he would go out there and I said, \"Are you going to be going\r\nhome this afternoon?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he told me then, he told me that he didn't have a car, you know,\r\nand so I told him, I said, \"Well, I live out there in Irving,\"--I found\r\nout he lived out there and so I said, \"Any time you want to go just let\r\nme know.\"\r\n\r\nSo I thought he would go home every day like most men do but he told me\r\nno, that he wouldn't go home every day and then he asked me could he\r\nride home say like Friday afternoon on weekends and come back on Monday\r\nmorning and I told him that would be just fine with me.\r\n\r\nI told him if he wanted a ride any other time just let me know before\r\nI go off and leave him because when it comes to quitting time some of\r\nthese guys, you know, some of them mess around the bathroom and some of\r\nthem quit early and some of them like that and some leave at different\r\ntimes than others.\r\n\r\nBut I said from talking to him then, I say, he just wanted to ride home\r\non weekends with me and I said that was fine.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he say at that time he was living in Dallas, he had a\r\nroom in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; he did. He had an apartment.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he say where?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he didn't. He just said he had an apartment over\r\nin Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had you known his wife before that? Had you ever met his\r\nwife, Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I never had.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had you heard that a Russian girl was staying there in the\r\nneighborhood?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I say about this time I met him, you know, I knew\r\nthat at the time then but I didn't think anything about it because, you\r\nknow, the people travel from one country to the next all the time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you know Mrs. Paine, Ruth Paine?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I didn't until all this had happened because I\r\nwill be frank with you, people around there, I say, they just don't\r\nmake friends very easy. I say you can have somebody living three doors\r\nfrom you and you can live a couple of years and you still might not\r\nknow the name.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you had never met Mrs. Ruth Paine before the day you met\r\nLee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of work did Lee do, what kind of work was assigned\r\nto him?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. He filled orders like I do and several other men.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How many order fillers were there employed at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Oh, I would say roughly around five, six at that time.\r\nBecause about the time we was real busy, the busy season. I come there,\r\nyou know, and they was going pretty good when I went to work there and\r\nI say we were still going pretty good when he come to work there.\r\n\r\nWe had a lot of work to do and usually when we have a lot of work to do\r\nwe have more order fillers.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he ride home with you in your car on weekends?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; he did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On Friday nights.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. From that time until November 22, did he ride home with you\r\nevery weekend?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he did every weekend but one.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember that date?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In the statement you made I believe you said it was the 16th\r\nand 17th of November. I am just reminding you of that.\r\n\r\nDoes it refresh your memory any?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I remember one weekend, I say, right now I can't recall\r\nbecause just to be frank with you I couldn't tell you roughly; I say I\r\nmight have at that time but I say it slipped my mind but the thing is I\r\ndo know he rode home with me every weekend up to that but one.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And why did--did he tell you why he wasn't going to ride home\r\nthat weekend?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, he did. He said he was working on his driving license\r\nand he was going to go take a driving test.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever ask him afterward if he had taken his driver's\r\ntest?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I never did. I assumed that he had taken it and\r\npassed it what part of the test he was taking.\r\n\r\nMost men do, I say, they usually work at it, study at it good enough so\r\nthey don't flunk out.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do you have to get a learner's permit in Texas\r\nbefore you can get a driver's permit?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I say, you don't. Just two steps to it. I say,\r\nfirst no matter what age you are; say, when you have to be at least 14\r\nis about the youngest you can get it in Texas and then you have to take\r\na DE, Driver's Education, if you are going to school but otherwise,\r\nthe age is 16 and you just go around to the driving license bureau\r\nthere, they have an office in most any town of any size in Texas, and\r\nyou just go in and see the driving license man and just tell him that\r\nyou plan to take your driving test and you would like to have the auto\r\nmanual, and the manual covers any laws and so forth in the State of\r\nTexas, and you can either study for your operator's or your commercial\r\nand you pick out which one you want, and you study up for it and then\r\nhe is there, he tells you what days he is in his office, and so he goes\r\nthere a certain time and he gives you several sheets of paper, a quiz\r\nand you answer them questions, and if you--you have to make a grade of\r\n70 on it to pass and if you make a grade of 70 or above, well, I say,\r\nin another week or two you go down there and you say like for instance\r\nif you are going to want a driver's license for a car----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Lee ever ask you or did Lee ever tell you\r\nwhether he had ever actually applied for a driver's license?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he never had, except I told you that weekend that\r\nhe said he was going down to take his driving test, and so I knew from\r\nbeing in the State of Texas that you have to know something; you have\r\nto have the manuals and so forth to study up on it. Or there isn't any\r\nuse going down there if you don't know the rules because you are not\r\nwasting any time but your own.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember whether or not one weekend that he didn't\r\ngo down with you but he rode back with you, say, on the Armistice Day\r\nholiday? Do you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Your memory is that he went, he rode home with you every\r\nFriday and came back the following Monday?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Except this one weekend?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right, that is what I say. If he went home with me on\r\nFriday afternoon he always rode back with me on Monday morning. It\r\nwasn't no added job when he would come with me on the weekend. He would\r\nride home with me on Friday and he would come back with me on Monday.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he ever tell you that he had or had not applied for a\r\ndriver's license?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No; he had not except he told me he was going down to take\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He never told you that he had or had not?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And he never told you whether he had obtained a driver's\r\nlicense?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever talk to him on whether or not he could drive a\r\ncar, knew how to drive a car?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I say, I believe the first afternoon, the first time\r\nwe was going home and we were talking about that and he said he was\r\nworking on his driving license then, and then naturally like I told you\r\nseveral weeks later, then he told me he was going to take his driving\r\ntest and I assumed he could drive a car being as old as he was because\r\nmost everybody in the State of Texas by the time you are my age if you\r\ncan't drive a car something is wrong with you.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He did never say whether he could or couldn't?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he ever ask you about the parts of a car?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I don't believe he did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember any conversation when he asked you what the\r\nclutch was?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Oh, yes. We got talking about that. He noticed, you know,\r\nmost cars as old as mine, you know most of them are standard shift,\r\nand when I bought this old car it kind of fooled me it had automatic\r\ntransmission on it so we got talking about it on the way home driving\r\nhome and I told him that I really prefer a standard because you know,\r\nthey are a lot easier to work on and you know, when an automatic goes\r\ndead it goes dead, there is no rolling a couple of feet and jumping on\r\nthe clutch and starting when the battery is down.\r\n\r\nAnd I remember he said it was a little bit different to drive with a\r\nclutch. I said, if you are not used to it, but if you get used to it.\r\nYou have to find a friction point on any car, even on Chevrolet or\r\nFord, you know yourself the friction points on a clutch and the brakes\r\nare different adjusted on every car you drive.\r\n\r\nAnd I told you there is nothing you do. You just have to get used to\r\na car of the individual, you can drive one car to do it, and you can\r\ndrive another one it may take you a couple of days to get used to it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He is the one who mentioned the clutch, is he, that you\r\ndidn't have a clutch?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nI guess he noticed that I didn't have a clutch.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I see.\r\n\r\nDid he pay for any part of the trip, buy your gasoline?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he didn't. I never did ask him. Because like I\r\nsaid I drove over there anyway and it doesn't take any more to drive\r\none guy than it does to drive a carload.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he offer to pay any time?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he never did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At any time coming back after a weekend did you ever stop at\r\na restaurant for breakfast?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; we never did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever stop on the way home on Friday night and buy\r\nanything?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; stopped one time and bought some gas, I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he pay for it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he offer to?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see him have any money in his possession, bills,\r\nchange?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I never did see him out playing around with any\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the way back and forth did you talk very much to each\r\nother?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. N,. sir; not very much. He is, probably in your line of\r\nbusiness you have probably seen a lot of guys who talk a lot and some\r\ndon't and he was one of these types that just didn't talk. And I have\r\nseen, you know, I am not very old but I have seen a lot of guys in my\r\ntime, just going to school, different boys and girls, some talk a lot\r\nand some don't, so I didn't think anything strange about that.\r\n\r\nAbout the only time you could get anything out of the talking was about\r\nbabies, you know, he had one and he was expecting another, that was\r\none way he had him get that job because his wife was pregnant and I\r\nwould always get something out of it when I asked him about the babies\r\nbecause it seemed he was very fond of children because when I asked\r\nhim he chuckled and told me about what he was doing about the babies\r\nover the weekend and sometimes we would talk about the weather, and\r\nsometimes he would go to work and it would be cloudy in the morning and\r\nit would come out that afternoon after work, sometimes during the day\r\nand it would turn to be just one of the prettiest days you would want\r\nanywhere, and he would say some comment about that, but not very much.\r\n\r\nHe would say a few words and then he would cut off.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he tell you he had been to Russia, say anything about\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I say, we were talking about one time talking about\r\nthe service, and so I asked him had he ever been overseas and he said\r\nhe had, and I asked him had he ever been to Germany and he said he had\r\nbeen through there.\r\n\r\nSo, most times when boys are in the service in the United States they\r\neither go to Japan or, I say, they either go over there or you know, go\r\nto some of these, say, like Germany or France somewhere like that.\r\n\r\nAnd so other than that he told me that he had been through there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he say he had been to Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. He said, you know, like I say, he said he had been over\r\nthere and he said he had been there so I thought when he told me, yes;\r\nhe had, so I thought maybe, you know, by being, I know he told me had\r\nbeen in service and I thought maybe that is how he got in.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, your answer is yes; he did tell you he had\r\nbeen in Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he go into detail and tell you how he got there and what\r\nhe did there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, he didn't. I, to be frank with you I, was more\r\ninterested about France and Germany and I asked him about them towns\r\nand he told me he liked France, I mean he said not that he didn't like\r\nFrance, he said people in France was more the kind to con the United\r\nStates boys out of their money and he was in Germany there 2 or 3 days\r\nand he said he liked Germany better than France because that is one\r\nreason. Because he said if you didn't really know how to count that\r\nFrench money them French guys would really take you.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he say anything about being in the Marines?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; he told me he was a Marine.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That he had been to Japan?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he didn't say he had been to Japan.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Ever talk about politics?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Ever mention any subjects like, political parties, the\r\nDemocrats, Republicans?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Ever mention anything about Communists, Marxists or any words\r\nlike that did he use?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he tell you where he met his wife?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he ever talk much about his wife?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he didn't. I say, like I said, he was just a guy\r\nwho didn't talk very much at all.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At the Texas School Book Depository, you have lunch,\r\n45-minute lunch hour, don't you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you pack your lunch from home?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir, I always took lunch.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember whether or not when Oswald came back with you\r\non any Monday morning or any weekend did he pack his lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; he did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He did?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir. When he rode with me, I say he always brought\r\nlunch except that one day on November 22 he didn't bring his lunch that\r\nday.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But every other day he brought a lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right, when he rode with me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Would he bring it in a paper sack or what kind of a container?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; like a little paper sack you get out of a\r\ngrocery store, you have seen these little old sacks that you could buy,\r\nsandwich bag, sack.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you carry your lunch in a paper sack?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There is a lunch room in the Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that on the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; on the second floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There is some kind of a recreation room on the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. There is a little domino room there where some of the guys\r\ngo in and play dominoes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But the lunch room is on the second floor?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do they sell any food there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; they don't. About all they sell in the lunch room\r\nis different types of soft drinks and then near the window, the men who\r\nwork in the offices there they have coffee there, you can drink coffee\r\nup there, I never did. Then you have an assortment of cookies and\r\ncandies and peanuts and so forth on the machine there. That is about\r\nall they have.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember whether or not Oswald packed his lunch,\r\nbrought his lunch on other days, the days that he didn't ride with you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. To be frank with you, I don't know whether he brought his\r\nlunch because I will tell you one way, some guys bring their lunch\r\nthere and some guys buy it there because we have a caterer service, you\r\nsee, comes around about 10 o'clock the man comes around and several\r\nof the boys they go out there and buy their lunch from the catering\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then later on at 11:45?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. 12 o'clock is when we always eat lunch.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. 12 to 12:45?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you get off your job, did you usually go to the lunch\r\nroom on the second floor to eat your lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; most of the time I don't. Most of the time you\r\nsee several of us guys sitting down at our own table and we just sit\r\nthere. I say we usually go up there to get something to drink and I say\r\nI have ate up there several times but most of the times I eat with the\r\nguys I work with.\r\n\r\nUsually we just sit down and eat, and we lay down on the big tables\r\nthere and sometimes talk or go to sleep.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is on the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you notice where Oswald had his lunch usually?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nNow, I say we have a refrigerator there, some of the boys put their\r\nlunches in there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever eat lunch with Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I never have.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see him eating lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I never have seen him eat lunch. I have seen him\r\ngo to the Doctor Pepper machine by the refrigerator and get a Doctor\r\nPepper but I never have seen him, you might say, sit right down and eat\r\nhis lunch.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In driving back and forth with Oswald did you ever hear\r\nhim--did he ever talk about guns?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he never did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he ever tell you he owned a gun?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did Oswald ever say anything to you about buying an\r\nautomobile in any of these trips?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. One time we were talking about it, he said he thought he\r\nwould just buy him an old car, you know, like mine. I say most models\r\nlike that you can get them pretty cheap and as far as going back and\r\nforth for work that is about all they are good for.\r\n\r\nI said, \"You don't need a new car to be used for going back and forth.\r\nYou don't need it unless you drive a good-sized distance.\"\r\n\r\nBut that is what he said in the long run he planned to buy one but so\r\nfar as I know he never did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he say that once or more than once?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; just one time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When he said he would get an old car?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he ever tell you he had gone to an old car dealer?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he ever tell you he had tried out a car?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir. So far as I--like I say, that one time, that\r\nis as far as I can ever recall that we even talked much about\r\nanything--about cars--except a while ago he asked me--we were talking\r\nabout the clutch and automatic transmission and so forth.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There is a bus service between Dallas and Irving?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; there is.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you get the bus anywhere near the Texas School Book\r\nDepository?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. To be frank with you I will say I have never ridden the\r\nbus from Irving over there, but I assume you can get off there just\r\nlike any other bus at any street corner you want to.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know what the fare is?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is there a toll charge to call from Dallas to Irving?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; it is not.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. For 10 cents you can call there, can you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I say just for your regular telephone bill, you just\r\npick it up and call.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I see.\r\n\r\nNow, there was the one date that Oswald came to you and asked you to\r\ndrive him back to Irving, it was not a Friday, was it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; it wasn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It was on a Thursday.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was that the 21st of November?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, tell us about that.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I say, we were standing like I said at the\r\nfour-headed table about half as large as this, not, quite half as\r\nlarge, but anyway I was standing there getting the orders in and he\r\nsaid, \"Could I ride home with you this afternoon?\"\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"Sure. You know, like I told you, you can go home with me\r\nany time you want to, like I say anytime you want to go see your wife\r\nthat is all right with me.\"\r\n\r\nSo automatically I knew it wasn't Friday, I come to think it wasn't\r\nFriday and I said, \"Why are you going home today?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he says, \"I am going home to get some curtain rods.\" He said, \"You\r\nknow, put in an apartment.\"\r\n\r\nHe wanted to hang up some curtains and I said, \"Very well.\" And I never\r\nthought more about it and I had some invoices in my hands for some\r\norders and I walked on off and started filling the orders.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This was on what floor?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. This was on the first floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About what time in the morning?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I would say sometime between eight and ten, because I go\r\nto work at eight and I would break at ten.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was it at the break time or before?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It was before the break.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It was before noon then?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see him at the noon hour?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That day?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That day.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I don't recall, to be frank with you. You know, I will\r\njust be frank with you, I say just like after a guy works there for\r\na while and he comes by and he walks by you, you don't pay so much\r\nattention but say like somebody else comes in there strange, you\r\nautomatically just look at them.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you talk to him again until quitting time?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, to be frank with you, like I said, the only\r\ntime--you know, like I say, he didn't talk very much and about the\r\nonly time--other than like I told you about talking about them babies\r\nand about the weather sometimes he would ask me some questions about a\r\nbook because down there, I say, if you have ever been acquainted with\r\nbooks a lot of times maybe just a little bit of difference in a title\r\nor something like that would make the difference in what type of book\r\nthey want and sometimes maybe they will forget to put that on there and\r\nyou look at the price.\r\n\r\nIf you can tell the price, some editions we have a paperback and some\r\nwe have hard bound and the price can automatically tell you which one\r\nthey want, and sometimes he would ask me something like that which\r\nbook do they want and I would tell him and that was about the only\r\nconversation we had.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You didn't talk any more with him that day concerning the\r\nride home?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But you did go home with him?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That is he rode home with me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time did you get off from work?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. 4:40.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time did you get to Irving?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, usually get there, if you make good time, get there\r\nmaybe around 5:20 or 5:25. But if you catch the traffic and catch the\r\ntrain crossing the tracks, it is usually about 5:30 or 5:35, it is just\r\naccording to how bad the traffic is.\r\n\r\nIf you get ahead of it before it starts coming out, you can make pretty\r\ngood headway.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you make any stop in the car before you got home?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I don't believe we did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did the two of you walk together down to the parking lot?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; we did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you dropped him off at the place where his wife was\r\nstaying, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I believe I did. I, to be frank with you I, say\r\nsometimes he rode home with me, sometimes--a little store not too far\r\nfrom the house, there and if I was going to the store I would just\r\ndrop him off by the house, but if I wasn't going to the store he would\r\nusually go on to the corner near the house and walk the rest of the way\r\nto the house up to where his wife was staying just about a half a block\r\nfrom my house up to where he was, his wife was staying, so he would\r\nwalk there just a little bit.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember if you talked to him any on the walk down two\r\nor three blocks down to the parking lot, anything said that you can\r\nremember?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I don't believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you got in the car and went home do you remember if you\r\nsaid anything, if you said anything to him, or if he said anything to\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I don't believe he did. Like I said, he didn't\r\ntalk very much. About the only time we would talk was about the weather\r\nand babies, something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember this day whether or not you let him walk to\r\nthe house where his wife was staying?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. To be frank with you, I can't remember positively whether\r\nI let him off at the house or whether he got out there where I lived,\r\njust to be frank with you.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You know where the house is, don't you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where Mrs. Paine lives?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How far is that from your house?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Like I say, it is just about half a block up the street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It is on the same street, is it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I say, we lived at the corner of Westbrook and Fifth\r\nStreet, and Fifth Street runs on up, you know, and I say they live on\r\nFifth Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What direction does Fifth run, east, west, north or south?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It runs east and west.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. East and west. And you live on the corner of Westbrook and\r\nFifth?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And Paine's house is east or west of your house?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It is west.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It is west of of your house?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About a half block?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the same street. Fifth Street?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What side of the street do you live on, the north side or\r\nsouth side of Fifth Street?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. North side.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What side of the street do the Paine's live on, the north or\r\nsouth side of Fifth Street?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. North.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You both live on the north side?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. So to walk from Paine's house to your house you walk east\r\nalong the north side of Fifth Street across Westbrook, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Now, from the corner of Westbrook and Fifth you walk west\r\non the same side of the street on the north side.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the north side?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. From your house to Paine's?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right, you walk west.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And from Paine's house to yours. OK.\r\n\r\nNow, did you see Oswald any that night, the Thursday night----\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You brought him home.\r\n\r\nNext morning what time did you get up? What time did you get up the\r\nnext morning?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I believe I got up around 6:30, that is the time I usually\r\nget up, right around 6:30 there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Always eat your breakfast before you go to work?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember the night before, that is after you got home\r\nthat night, that your sister asked you how it happened that Oswald came\r\nhome with you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; I believe she did or something. We got to talking\r\nabout something and said, I told her that he had rode home with me\r\nand told her he said he was going to come home and pick up some\r\ncurtain rods or something. I usually don't talk too much to my sister,\r\nsometimes she is not there when I am in because she is either at the\r\nstore or something like that and I am either when she comes in as I say\r\nI am playing with the little nieces and we don't talk too much about\r\nwork or something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This night, this evening, do you remember you did talk to her\r\nabout the fact that Oswald had come home with you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I believe I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you tell her what he had told you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir. I believe she said why did he come home now and\r\nI said, well, he says he was going to get some curtain rods.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The next morning you had breakfast about what time?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Between 7 and 7:15, that is the time I usually, I usually\r\ncome to the breakfast table about 7.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Breakfast table in the kitchen?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; it is in the den.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And the kitchen windows look out on what street, Westbrook or\r\nFifth?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Westbrook.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. They look onto Westbrook?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There is a back door, is there, to the kitchen?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; there is. I say when we come in there we have a\r\ndouble carport more or less type of garage.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that on Westbrook?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; the entrance to the garage there, more or less\r\ncarport; yes, the entrance is from Westbrook.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. As you were having breakfast did your mother say anything to\r\nyou about----\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I say----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I was sitting there eating my breakfast there, so sitting\r\nthere, I usually talk to my little nieces, you know, they have them\r\ncartoons on for a while and we usually talk a little bit back and forth\r\nwhile eating breakfast and I was just finishing my coffee there and\r\nmy sister, you know, was working over there around, you know the sink\r\nthere, and she was fixing my lunch so she was somewhere around there\r\nover on the cabinets fixing the cabinets and mother just happened to\r\nglance up and saw this man, you know, who was Lee looking in the window\r\nfor me and she said, \"Who is that?\"\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"That is Lee,\" and naturally he just walked around and so I\r\nthought he just walked around there on the carport right there close to\r\nthe door and so I told her I had to go, so I went in there and brushed\r\nmy teeth right quick and come through there and I usually have my coat\r\nlaying somewhere on the chair and picked it up and put it on and by\r\nthat time my sister had my lunch, you know, in a sack and sitting over\r\nthere on the washer where I picked it up right there by the door and I\r\njust walked on out and we got in the car.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, did your sister say anything as you were having\r\nbreakfast?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No; she didn't say anything to me at all.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. She didn't say anything to you either about Oswald or did she?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; say, she didn't say, you know, when I looked up\r\nand saw him I knew who it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was he doing?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. He just looked through the kitchen window. To see from\r\nthere on the ground outside there. I say you don't have to be any\r\nheight at all, you don't have to be too tall to be able to look in the\r\nkitchen window there.\r\n\r\nI say, if you have the window open you can see in, if you have light on\r\nin there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When your mother mentioned, \"Who is that,\" you looked up and\r\nsaw Lee Oswald in the kitchen window?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I just saw him for a split second and when he saw I saw\r\nhim, I guess he heard me say, \"Well, it is time to go,\" and he walked\r\ndown by the back door there.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When he would go with you on Monday, on any\r\nMonday, was this the same procedure for getting to, getting in contact\r\nwith you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. You mean coming in there and looking through the window?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; it wasn't. I say, that is the first time he had\r\never done that. I say, most times I would usually call him, you know,\r\nI was already out in the car fixing to go out the driveway there, and,\r\nyou know, around to pick him up if he hadn't come down but most times,\r\nonce in a while I picked him up at the house and another time he was\r\nalready coming down the sidewalk to the house when I was fixing to pick\r\nhim up and I usually picked him up around the corner there.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did this different method of him meeting you raise\r\nany questions in your mind?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; it didn't. I just thought maybe, you know, he\r\njust left a little bit earlier but when I looked up and saw that the\r\nclock was, I knew I was the one who was running a little bit late\r\nbecause, as I say, I was talking, sitting there eating breakfast and\r\ntalking to the little nieces, it was later than I thought it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you went out the back door where was Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. He was standing just a few feet there outside the back\r\ndoor there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He wasn't in the car?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he wasn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was he near the car?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he wasn't.\r\n\r\nYou see, always I keep my car parked outside the carport there, on the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He was just a few feet outside your back door when you came\r\nout?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you walk together to the car?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; we did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you got in one side and he got in the other?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes. Right in front there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you say usually you had to go by and pick him up?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I said I had a couple of times. Most of the time,\r\nyou know, he was usually walking down the sidewalk as I was driving\r\nout of the driveway so, therefore, I didn't have to go up to the house\r\nthere to pick him up. I just usually picked him up around the corner\r\nbecause he was usually on the sidewalk and I just stopped and picked\r\nhim up.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you later than usual that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I don't believe we were, because we got to work\r\non time. I say, when I looked at the clock, after I glanced he was\r\nthere a split second and I just turned around and looked at the clock\r\nto see what time it was and it was right around 7:21 then and I went in\r\nand brushed my teeth real quick and running through the house put my\r\ncoat on and we left.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You both got in the car about the same time?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right.\r\n\r\nWhen you got in the car did you say anything to him or did he say\r\nanything to you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Let's see, when I got in the car I have a kind of habit\r\nof glancing over my shoulder and so at that time I noticed there was a\r\npackage laying on the back seat, I didn't pay too much attention and I\r\nsaid, \"What's the package, Lee?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"Curtain rods,\" and I said, \"Oh, yes, you told me you was\r\ngoing to bring some today.\"\r\n\r\nThat is the reason, the main reason he was going over there that\r\nThursday afternoon when he was to bring back some curtain rods, so I\r\ndidn't think any more about it when he told me that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did the package look like?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I will be frank with you, I would just, it is\r\nright as you get out of the grocery store, just more or less out of a\r\npackage, you have seen some of these brown paper sacks you can obtain\r\nfrom any, most of the stores, some varieties, but it was a package just\r\nroughly about two feet long.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It was, what part of the back seat was it in?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It was in his side over on his side in the far back.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How much of that back seat, how much space did it take up?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I would say roughly around 2 feet of the seat.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. From the side of the seat over to the center, is that the way\r\nyou would measure it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. If, if you were going to measure it that way from the end\r\nof the seat over toward the center, right. But I say like I said I just\r\nroughly estimate and that would be around two feet, give and take a few\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How wide was the package?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I would say the package was about that wide.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How wide would you say that would be?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Oh, say, around 5 inches, something like that. 5, 6 inches\r\nor there. I don't----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The paper, was the color of the paper, that you would get in\r\na grocery store, is that it, a bag in a grocery store?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right. You have seen, not a real light color but you know\r\nnormally, the normal color about the same color, you have seen these\r\nkinds of heavy duty bags you know like you obtain from the grocery\r\nstore, something like that, about the same color of that, paper sack\r\nyou get there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there anything more said about the paper sack on the way\r\ninto town?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; there wasn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What route did you take into town that day?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Went down--you know, I told you I had two routes; that day\r\nI went down, you know, Fifth Street runs into Sixth after you cross\r\nthe Storey Road there, so I just went on down Sixth until I come to\r\nO'Connor, and then took a left on O'Connor and it takes you right on\r\nout to Stemmons and from there I went right on into Stemmons and come\r\nup Commerce, and you go up Commerce, there until you hit Record Street,\r\nthat is one block over from Houston and then I went down until I hit\r\nMcKinney and then it goes right down to the warehouse and then take a\r\nleft and you go right around to the parking lot.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You didn't stop any place on your way in?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Park in the parking lot?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you park in the parking lot this time?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I parked in the same place the picture I showed you there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. As shown in the picture. That is Exhibit No. 361.\r\n\r\nAnything else said about curtain rods?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; there wasn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Anything else said about the package?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; there wasn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who got out of the car first?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. He did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember any conversation on the way in about anything?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I asked him did he have fun playing with them\r\nbabies and he chuckled and said he did. And so that morning I said just\r\na few minutes after we started you know it was a cloudy day and it\r\nstarted misting and rain and by the time we got out on the Freeway I\r\nsaid, you know, how those trucks throw that grime on the windshield and\r\nfinally it was getting pretty thick on there with spots of rain, and\r\nI turned on the windshield wiper and you know how grime spatters your\r\nwindshield and I said, \"I wish it would rain or just quit altogether, I\r\nwish it would do something to clear off the windshield,\" and the drops\r\nstarted getting larger so eventually it cleaned off the windshield and\r\nby the time I got down to Dallas there I just turned off the windshield.\r\n\r\nJust a few clouds, and rained a little bit to get out of it. But other\r\nthan that just saying the weather was messy, that is about all.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was it foggy?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; not in too particular. I say in other words, just\r\nold cloudy, dull looking day and like I say fine mist of rain and after\r\nwe got a little bit further we got into larger drops.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there anything said about the President coming to Dallas\r\nthat day?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; it wasn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he say anything about that the day before?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever have any conversation with him with reference to\r\nthe President's visit to Texas?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you got to the parking lot who got out of the car first?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. He did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You didn't get out immediately then?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I was sitting there, say, looked at my watch and\r\nsomewhere around 7 or 8 minutes until and I saw we had a few minutes\r\nand I sat there, and as I say you can see the Freeway, Stemmons\r\nFreeway, from the warehouse and also the trains coming back and forth\r\nand I was sitting there.\r\n\r\nWhat I was doing--glanced up and watching cars for a minute but I was\r\nletting my engine run and getting to charge up my battery, because when\r\nyou stop and start you have to charge up your battery.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you have your lunch beside you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you notice whether or not Lee had a package that looked\r\nlike a lunch package that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. You know like I told you earlier. I say, he didn't take\r\nhis lunch because I remember right when I got in the car I asked him\r\nwhere was his lunch and he said he was going to buy his lunch that day.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He told you that that day, did he?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right. That is right. So, I assumed he was going to buy\r\nit, you know, from that catering service man like a lot of the boys do.\r\nThey don't bring their lunch but they go out and buy their lunch there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did he do about the package in the back seat when he got\r\nout of the car?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Like I say, I was watching the gages and watched the car\r\nfor a few minutes before I cut it off.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. He got out of the car and he was wearing the jacket that\r\nhas the big sleeves in them and he put the package that he had, you\r\nknow, that he told me was curtain rods up under his arm, you know, and\r\nso he walked down behind the car and standing over there at the end of\r\nthe cyclone fence waiting for me to get out of the car, and so quick as\r\nI cut the engine off and started out of the car, shut the door just as\r\nI was starting out just like getting out of the car, he started walking\r\noff and so I followed him in.\r\n\r\nSo, eventually there he kept getting a little further ahead of me and\r\nI noticed we had plenty of time to get there because it is not too far\r\nfrom the Depository and usually I walk around and watch them switching\r\nthe trains because you have to watch where you are going if you have to\r\ncross the tracks.\r\n\r\nOne day you go across one track and maybe there would be some cars\r\nsitting there and there would be another diesel coming there, so you\r\nhave to watch when you cross the tracks, I just walked along and I just\r\nlike to watch them switch the cars, so eventually he kept getting a\r\nlittle further ahead of me and by that time we got down there pretty\r\nclose to the Depository Building there, I say, he would be as much as,\r\nI would say, roughly 50 feet in front of me but I didn't try to catch\r\nup with him because I knew I had plenty of time so I just took my time\r\nwalking up there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you usually walk up there together.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; we did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is this the first time that he had ever walked ahead of you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; he did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You say he had the package under his arm when you saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean one end of it under the armpit?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; he had it up just like you stick it right under\r\nyour arm like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And he had the lower part----\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. The other part with his right hand.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Right hand?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He carried it then parallel to his body?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right, straight up and down.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Under his right arm?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did it look to you as if there was something heavy in the\r\npackage?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I will be frank with you, I didn't pay much\r\nattention to the package because like I say before and after he told me\r\nthat it was curtain rods and I didn't pay any attention to it, and he\r\nnever had lied to me before so I never did have any reason to doubt his\r\nword.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did it appear to you there was some, more than just paper he\r\nwas carrying, some kind of a weight he was carrying?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, yes, sir; I say, because one reason I know that\r\nbecause I worked in a department store before and I had uncrated\r\ncurtain rods when they come in, and I know if you have seen when they\r\ncome straight from the factory you know how they can bundle them up and\r\nput them in there pretty compact, so he told me it was curtain rods so\r\nI didn't think any more about the package whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, from the way he carried it, the way he walked, did it\r\nappear he was carrying something that had more than the weight of a\r\npaper?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I say, you know like I say, I didn't pay much\r\nattention to the package other than I knew he had it under his arm and\r\nI didn't pay too much attention the way he was walking because I was\r\nwalking along there looking at the railroad cars and watching the men\r\non the diesel switch them cars and I didn't pay too much attention on\r\nhow he carried the package at all.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I will show you this picture again, this map, which is the\r\nCommission's Exhibit No. 361, and would you show us the way he walked,\r\nthe course he walked from the place your car was parked up to the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository. You come around here and here is a black pen.\r\nShow us the course that he walked.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Like I say, I had that car parked.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Put an \"X\" there which will represent your car.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. All right (indicating).\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is where your car was parked?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I would say roughly like in there, you know like the\r\npicture shows right in there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, draw a line to show the way that he walked.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. O.K.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The direction he walked.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. All right.\r\n\r\nLike I say, he was standing right about there when I got out of the\r\ncar so naturally he started off walking so we just come on right on\r\njust like you would come across these tracks right here, and he was\r\ncoming right on along the fence like that. Just coming right on, right\r\nhere now is the School Book Depository, right, so he was coming right\r\non down this fence there and he was coming across these tracks, and\r\nstanding right in here somewhere at the door.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Door?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At the end of that put a \"XY\", so \"X\" to \"XY\" will represent\r\nthe course he walked. It shows \"XY\".\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then \"X\" to \"XY\" is the course he took, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go in the same door?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You walked the same direction?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now when he went in the door you were about 50 feet behind\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right. The last time I saw him I was right in this area\r\ncoming across these railroad tracks and I just happened to glance up\r\nand see him going through the door there and shut the door.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let's see, the last time you saw him he was at the door?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which is at \"XY\" and you were crossing the railroad tracks on\r\nPacific Avenue?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I say this is Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Pacific runs east and west?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Put a mark there, put a \"Z\" there as to your location.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right in there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is about where you were, a \"Z\" when he entered the door\r\nat \"XY\"?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, you went on in the Building, did you, afterwards?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right. I went on in.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, the first floor of the Texas School Book Depository is\r\nfairly clear, isn't it, it is clear of partitions?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Pretty well. I will say we have bins after you get so far.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Toward the middle of the floor you have bins?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see Lee as you walked in the door?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Here is Commission 362 which we will show you. I will put it\r\nup high so everyone can see it. There is a picture in the lower left\r\ncorner which is marked \"Exterior View of Entrance Door from Houston\r\nStreet Loading Dock.\"\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that the door?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is the door that Lee entered?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And that is also the door that you entered, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And over to the right here is the interior view of entrance\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is the same door, isn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Now, this door, you see right there is that door right\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, the door in the lower left-hand corner is the\r\noutside door?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And as you walk through--and this is the door, the outside\r\ndoor, is shown in the picture on the lower right-hand corner?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That is right, right there, that is this same door you are\r\nlooking at over here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then there is an interior door?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Leading into the interior that is also shown there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is sort of, what is it--a little corridor that you walk\r\nthrough?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I say it is just about that distance from here over to\r\nthat man over there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let's take a look there.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It is called the loading zone there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This map shows certain steps up, doesn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where is the door that you entered or that he entered.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is the door. Is that covered, is that area covered with\r\na ceiling roof?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And this is also walled in, is it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right. The railroad track runs along here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. After you get into this outside shed how did you get into the\r\nfirst floor of the Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Through that door.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Through the door there, into the interior door?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How much of the first floor here is clear so that you can see\r\nanybody there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Roughly say, let's see, just a few feet back, you know\r\nhere is the door right here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Whose door?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Mr. Shelley's.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Just a few feet back in here is where the bins start, they\r\nrun this way.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you mark in this where the bins start, the place?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Just draw a line across, you don't need to draw in the bins\r\nbut just where the bins start and we we will know it is the area.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Somewhere right in here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Draw the line clear across.\r\n\r\nWe will mark the line \"A\" on one side and \"B\" on the other so that we\r\ncan refer to it.\r\n\r\nNow, the area between, all the area shown in here from entrance to line\r\n\"AB\", is clear, is it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, the line from \"AB\" to the Elm Street side there are\r\nbins, are they?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And are those bins man high?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. 6, 7 feet?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir. Like I say these bins, we have two or three that\r\nrun across this way, like I have this line drawn, and they have broken\r\nspaces, and you can see a man on the other side of these bins because\r\nthey are not sealed up in the back.\r\n\r\nIn other words, you can put books in, say, from this side and go on the\r\nother side and have another. Anyway, we have more like these window\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The windows on Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right. We have some bins running this way, over here,\r\nseveral bins, two or three over here, and two or three over here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is this the only entrance to the first floor of the Building,\r\nthe one you have shown us?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir, it is not.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What other entrance is there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right here is the main entrance.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The main entrance?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That is right, coming on through here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There are two entrances. There is a main entrance in the\r\nfront of the Building or the Elm Street entrance, and then there is the\r\ndoor through which you entered the first floor, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, then we have another.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Out over here, let's see if I can find it, where the\r\ngarage where we have the truck. Let's see.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There is an overhead door here.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I see, right through here now, I see right through this\r\ndoor here we come out right here and we come out in this area right in\r\nhere where we have another dock right out in this area right here, in\r\nthat area there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That would be----\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That would be one, two, three. From this loading, like I\r\nsay, where we keep the truck.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is this overhead door usually covered, usually down closed,\r\nrather?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I say we keep it closed, and we have it here\r\nback in cold weather and we kept it closed and like I say when you go\r\nout there and get into the truck like you are going to drive the truck.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mark an arrow that you say is the entrance or exit, mark an\r\narrow going out.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Going out.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right.\r\n\r\nNow, this day did you see Lee Oswald the rest of the morning?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I saw him back and forth, you know, that morning\r\nwalking around, filling books and so forth, filling orders, had\r\ninvoices filling orders.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you came in that morning to go to work where did you go\r\nfirst?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I went like I did every morning, I went down in the\r\nbasement there and hung up my coat and put up my lunch.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see Oswald down there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you went to work?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How did you get to the basement?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Went down through the, now over there where they have--are\r\nyou familiar with the Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Only through the map.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. We have the----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There is the map of the first floor. Does it show the steps\r\nleading down to the basement?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir. You see the one there where you have the arrow\r\nthat is one entrance to the basement and that is the entrance I used\r\nthe biggest part of the time, that is the one I go down.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see Oswald there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. During the morning you say you saw Oswald around filling\r\norders?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you on the sixth floor any that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. One time just a few seconds. I said to Mr. Shelley we had\r\nsome book returns. They had sent back and he told me to count the books\r\nand make sure they were all there and put them in the space and so I\r\ntook the elevator and loaded them on with a two-wheeler and so I know\r\nwhere they went, and I went to the shelf off the elevator and put them\r\non the shelf and turned around and went right on down.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were they doing some work there that day?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; they were.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What time was that?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. When I went to put up the stock?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Yes. On the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That was sometime between 8 and 10 o'clock. I say it was\r\nthe early part of the morning.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of work did you notice they were doing up there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. As well as I remember they were moving stock, I believe\r\nputting up some stock, straightening up the stock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Any work done on the floor?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I don't remember if they were working on the floor or not.\r\nThey may have because upon the fifth floor I know we have done the\r\nfifth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember the names of any workmen you saw on the sixth\r\nfloor that morning you were there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I believe Billy was up there, Billy Lovelady, but so far\r\nas I can say I went and put books on the shelf and turned around and\r\nwalked back and glanced up when I was coming back, I didn't stay any\r\nlength of time because when we are pretty busy, some fill out orders\r\nand some doing something else and if you have a lot of orders to fill\r\nyou haven't got a lot of time to sit around and be talking.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see Oswald on the sixth floor any time that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir. I didn't because like I say that was the only\r\ntime I went up there at all that day and I was just up there for a few\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you talk to him any that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I don't believe I did much unless he asked me something\r\nabout a book like I told you, and I was always willing to help anybody\r\nI can.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, you knew that the President was going to pass that\r\nbuilding sometime that morning, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I heard he would.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you talk to some of the men around there about it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever talk to Oswald about that?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time did you knock off for lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. 12.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you eat your lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; not right then I didn't. I say, you know, he was\r\nsupposed to come by during our lunch hour so you don't get very many\r\nchances to see the President of the United States and being an old\r\nTexas boy, and [he] never having been down to Texas very much I went\r\nout there to see him and just like everybody else was, I was standing\r\non the steps there and watched for the parade to come by and so I did\r\nand I stood there until he come by.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You went out there after you quit work?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right, for lunch.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About 12 o'clock?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you hadn't eaten your lunch up to that time?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go out there with somebody?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who did you go out there with?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I stayed around there pretty close to Mr. Shelley and this\r\nboy Billy Lovelady and just standing there, people talking and just\r\ntalking about how pretty a day it turned out to be, because I told you\r\nearlier it was an old cloudy and misty day and then it didn't look like\r\nit was going to be a pretty day at all.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And it turned out to be a good day?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Pretty sunshiny day.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Warm?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; it was pretty warm.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then let's see, there was Billy Lovelady and you were there.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Anybody else you can remember?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. There was a lady there, a heavy-set lady who worked\r\nupstairs there whose name is Sarah something, I don't know her last\r\nname.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you near the steps?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I was, I was standing about, I believe, one step\r\ndown from the top there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. One step down from the top of the steps?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; standing there by the rail.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. By steps we are talking about the steps of the entrance to\r\nthe Building?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Shown in this picture?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which is Commission's Exhibit No. 362. Can you come over here\r\nand show us about where you were standing?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir. Like I told you this was an entrance right here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. We have a bar rail running about half way up here. This\r\nwas the first step and I was standing right around there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Put a mark there. Your name is Frazier, put an \"F\" there for\r\nFrazier.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. O.K.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In the picture that would show you about there, would it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; you can see, just see, the top, about the top\r\nrail there, I was standing right in there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Right in there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. To be frank with you, I say, shadow from the roof there\r\nknocked the sun from out our eyes, you wouldn't have any glare in the\r\neyes standing there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There was a roof over your head, was there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you stand there for 30 minutes or--tell us how long you\r\nstayed there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I stood there until the parade come by.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see the President go by?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you hear anything?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I say, just right after he went by he hadn't hardly\r\ngot by, I heard a sound and if you have ever been around motorcycles\r\nyou know how they backfire, and so I thought one of them motorcycles\r\nbackfired because right before his car came down, now there were\r\nseveral of these motorcycle policemen, and they took off down toward\r\nthe underpass down there, and so I thought, you know, that one of them\r\nmotorcycles backfired, but it wasn't just a few seconds that, you know,\r\nI heard two more of the same type of, you know, sounds, and by that\r\ntime people was running everywhere, and falling down and screaming,\r\nand naturally then I knew something was wrong, and so I come to the\r\nconclusion somebody else, somebody was shooting at somebody and I\r\nfigured it was him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You figured it was who?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I figured it was somebody shooting at President Kennedy\r\nbecause people were running and hollering so I just stood still. I have\r\nalways been taught when something like that happened or anywhere as far\r\nas that it is always best to stand still because if you run that makes\r\nyou look guilty sure enough.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, then, did you have any impression at that time as to the\r\ndirection from which the sound came?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, to be frank with you I thought it come from down\r\nthere, you know, where that underpass is. There is a series, quite a\r\nfew number, of them railroad tracks running together and from where\r\nI was standing it sounded like it was coming from down the railroad\r\ntracks there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you able to see the President, could you still see the\r\nPresident's car when you heard the first sound?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I couldn't. From there, you know, people were\r\nstanding out there on the curb, you see, and you know it drops, you\r\nknow the ground drops, off there as you go down toward that underpass\r\nand I couldn't see any of it because people were standing up there in\r\nmy way, but however, when he did turn that corner there, there wasn't\r\nanybody standing there in the street and you could see good there, but\r\nafter you got on past down there you couldn't see anything.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You didn't see the President's car at the time you heard the\r\nsound?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But you stood right there, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right. Stood right where I was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And Mr. Shelley was still standing there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And also Billy Lovelady?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The three of you didn't go any place?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I believe Billy and them walked down toward that direction\r\nbut I didn't. I just stood where I was. I hadn't moved at all.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see anybody after that come into the Building while\r\nyou were there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. You mean somebody other that didn't work there?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. A police officer.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I stood there a few minutes, you know, and some\r\npeople who worked there; you know normally started to go back into the\r\nBuilding because a lot of us didn't eat our lunch, and so we started\r\nback into the Building and it wasn't but just a few minutes that there\r\nwere a lot of police officers and so forth all over the Building there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you went back into the Building, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And before you went back into the Building no police officer\r\ncame up the steps and into the building?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Not that I know. They could walk by the way and I was\r\nstanding there talking to somebody else and didn't see it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did anybody say anything about what had happened, did you\r\nhear anybody say anything about the President had been shot?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; right before I went back, some girl who had\r\nwalked down a little bit further where I was standing on the steps, and\r\nsomebody come back and said somebody had shot President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know who it was who told you that?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Sir?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know who the girl was who told you that?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. She didn't tell me right directly but she just came back\r\nand more or less in a low kind of hollering she just told several\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you went back into the Building, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And police officers came in there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I would say by the time, you know some of us\r\nwent back in, and it wasn't just a few minutes, I say there were\r\nseveral.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you stay on the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, stayed on the first floor there for a few minutes\r\nand I hadn't eaten my lunch so I had my lunch down there in the\r\nbasement and I went down there to get my lunch and eat it and I walked\r\nback up on the first floor there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you came back into the Building, you came in the front\r\ndoor, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go down to the basement immediately or did you stand\r\naround on the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I stood around for several minutes there, you\r\nknow, and then, you know, eventually the ones who hadn't eaten their\r\nlunch, some of them had taken their lunch outside.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did other people go downstairs with you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; they didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You went down alone, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go at any time in the back end of the Building back\r\nnear the door to the loading dock?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I never did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Perhaps I had better ask you to point out on the map here\r\nwhere you were. Come over here, please.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. O.K.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You came in back into the Building?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Tell us where you went and what you did?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, you know like I said I come back through here\r\n[indicating on Commission Exhibit No. 362, diagram of first floor].\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. By \"coming back through here,\" you mean you came down the\r\nhallway and into the entrance into the first floor warehouse?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right, and you come by Mr. Shelley's office, that is his\r\ncounter right here, after you get in, you get off here, that is his\r\noffice, anyway, right out, I come out around here, you know where\r\nseveral of the people walked around here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is in the bin area?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; the bins don't start automatically right up in\r\nhere. I say, there is a little bit more or less, like more or less a\r\nhall through here, but anyway, you know, I say, you have two or three\r\nbins.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Through here you mean there is sort of a hall after you enter\r\ninto the warehouse?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. From it, after you come past this counter you have several\r\nrows of bins coming this way, but, I say, right after you get past,\r\nsay, this last bin right here running that way, right out this general\r\narea right here you have a telephone and everything out in here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, you indicated that everything that would be beyond this\r\nline, the bin lines, would be clear on the first floor.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right, beyond here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever go into that area where it was clear before you\r\nwent downstairs?\r\n\r\nFrom the time you came back into the room, did you go down into this\r\narea which was clear before you went downstairs?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I didn't go in here. I was right over right close\r\nto Mr. Shelley's office right around here and sit around and talked\r\nwith some guys around there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You are indicating around Mr. Shelley's office?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; pretty close right there, like I say more or\r\nless right out over in here we have a----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Put a mark there.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Let's see----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Put a circle to show the general area where you and the rest\r\nof them stood around and talked.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right in there is right around near the telephone and we\r\nwere just right around in there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you go?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. We left, you know, after we stood and talked with some\r\nguys there, some of them had eaten and some of them didn't, some of\r\nthem had sandwiches in their hands, so naturally I felt like eating and\r\nI walked around the bin and walked down the steps there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Got your lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Come back up?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I didn't come back up. I was sitting eating\r\nmy lunch. I looked at my watch and didn't have but 10 minutes, so\r\nI naturally ate faster than normal, so I was eating a couple of\r\nsandwiches, and eat an apple or something and come right back up and\r\nthe guys, the people who worked there, standing around on the first\r\nfloor, some of them eating their lunches and others merely talking.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You never went back to work?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; we didn't. I didn't work any more that day.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You stayed there on the job until you were told to go home?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time did they tell you to go home?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It was between 1 and 2 there sometime, roughly, I don't\r\nknow what time it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had the police officers come in there and talked to you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; they come in and talked to all of us. They asked\r\nus to show our proper identification, and then they had us to write our\r\nname down and who to get in touch with if they wanted to see us.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did they ask you where you had been at the time the President\r\npassed?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; they had. I told them I was out on the steps\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Asked you who you were with?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I told them and naturally Mr. Shelley and Billy\r\nvouched for me and so they didn't think anything about it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you hear anybody around there asking for Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At any time before you went home, did you hear anybody ask\r\nfor Lee?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I don't believe they did, because they, you know,\r\nlike one man showed us, we had to give proper identification and after\r\nwe passed him he told us to walk on then to the next man, and we, you\r\nknow, put down proper information where he could be found if they\r\nwanted to see you and talk to you any more, and then we went on up to a\r\nlittle bit more to the front entrance more toward Mr. Shelley's office\r\nthere with another man and stood there for a little while and told us\r\nall that was there could go ahead and go home.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you went on home?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did all this occur after you had finished your\r\nlunch?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; it did.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did it ever occur to you at any time following the\r\nshooting there was something connecting the shooting with Lee Oswald\r\nand the package?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I say not particularly not at that time, I didn't\r\nthink anything about it because, to be frank with you, some were over\r\nhere, one or two would be over here talking and just strung out here,\r\non the first floor and I didn't think anything about it. I see some of\r\nthe guys, they go out for lunch and they come back 12:45 so I didn't\r\nknow whether he had went out to lunch or not. Some of them do every\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did any of the policemen interfere with your\r\nefforts to go into the Building and eventually down into the basement\r\nwhere you had your lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; they didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Before you left, did you look for Oswald to see about taking\r\nhim home?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No; I didn't, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there some reason why you didn't?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I did. Because like I told you, he was going\r\nhome to get the curtain rods and I asked him at the time, the same\r\ntime, it would be about that, would he be going home with me Friday\r\nafternoon like he had been doing, he said no. So naturally when they\r\nlet us go I took on off because I thought maybe they had already\r\ndismissed him and he went on home.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you talked to him on Thursday and he told you he\r\nwouldn't be going home on Friday, did he tell you what he was going to\r\ndo, why he wasn't going to go home?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you talk to him again on Friday morning as to whether or\r\nnot he had changed his mind? Did you ask him whether or not you could\r\npick him up at the end of the day?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. To be frank with you, Mr. Ball, I am not sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Whether you did or not.\r\n\r\nDid anybody tell you that Lee Oswald was missing before you went home?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; they didn't.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Could you describe for the Commission where you\r\nwent on the sixth floor that morning in relationship to the overall\r\npicture of the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I could.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Would you do so, please?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nDo you have a piece of paper I can draw? [Witness draws diagram on\r\npiece of paper.]\r\n\r\nLet's see, right here is your two elevator shafts we have. That morning\r\nI used this one over here.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Would you mark Houston, Elm and the other streets?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. This is Houston, this is Elm right out here. Anyway, like\r\nI said, I won't draw these buildings. I have these two elevator shafts\r\nhere. Quickly you come off these elevator shafts right here, we have\r\nskids with books on them, and you see right on those skids you would\r\nhave some shelves right about like this and so I merely walked over\r\nto the elevator with the two-wheeler we use on the dock and walked\r\nsomewhere say maybe halfway, not quite halfway, there and put up some\r\nbooks, put them down on the floor there, on the floor level and so I\r\njust turned around and come back to the elevator and come on down, and\r\nwent about my business. He had me putting up some books there on the\r\nshelves.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. From this point here could you see the windows or\r\nthe area at the corner of Houston and Elm in the Building?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; you could. I say you could look down and see\r\nthis area back over here.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you look over there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nRight on down there, I knew where the books went so normally I didn't\r\nhave to look around. I say, I was going to get through, if you are not\r\nfamiliar with the books and so forth it would take you a little longer\r\nto find and put them up. But if you know where they go you can put them\r\nup very quickly.\r\n\r\nSo I knew this book went in the shelf because this book we don't handle\r\nvery many of them and that is where I put books you don't handle very\r\nmany, put them in the shelf.\r\n\r\nSo I put the books in the shelf and turned around and put them in the\r\nelevator and come on down.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can I have this marked as Commission Exhibit 368, the diagram\r\njust drawn by the witness to illustrate his work on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be marked.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 368, for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have here Commission's 163, a gray blue jacket. Do you\r\nrecognize this jacket?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see Lee Oswald wear this jacket?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I don't believe I have.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Commission Exhibit No. 162, which can be described for the\r\nrecord as a gray jacket with zipper, have you seen Lee Oswald wear this\r\njacket?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I haven't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have here Commission 150, which is described as sort of a\r\nrust brown shirt. Have you ever seen Lee Oswald wear this shirt? It has\r\na hole in the sleeve near the elbow.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I don't believe I have because most time I\r\nnoticed when Lee had it, I say he put off his shirt and just wear a\r\nT-shirt the biggest part of the time so really what shirt he wore that\r\nday I really didn't see it or didn't pay enough attention to it whether\r\nhe did have a shirt on.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On that day you did notice one article of clothing, that is,\r\nhe had a jacket?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What color was the jacket?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It was a gray, more or less flannel, wool-looking type of\r\njacket that I had seen him wear and that is the type of jacket he had\r\non that morning.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did it have a zipper on it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; it was one of the zipper types.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It isn't one of these two zipper jackets we have shown?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know what kind of trousers he had on, what color?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Not that day, I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You wouldn't remember that day?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I had seen him wear some gray ones before.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Here is Commission's Exhibit No. 157 which are gray trousers.\r\nHad you ever seen him wear these?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; to be frank with you, I had seen something more or\r\nless of that order, that type of material, but so far as that, being\r\nsure that, was his pants or some of his clothes, I couldn't be sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Here is Commission No. 156 which is a pair of gray trousers.\r\nDid you ever see him wear trousers of that type?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Not that I know of.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You are not able to tell us then anything or are you able to\r\ntell us, describe any of the clothing he had on that day, except this\r\ngray jacket?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is the only thing you can remember?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have here a paper sack which is Commission's Exhibit 364.\r\n\r\nThat gray jacket you mentioned, did it have any design in it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was it light or dark gray?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It was light gray.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mentioned it was woolen.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Long sleeves?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Buttoned sleeves at the wrist, or do you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. To be frank with you, I didn't notice that much about the\r\njacket, but I had seen him wear that gray woolen jacket before.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You say it had a zipper on it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now we have over here this exhibit for identification which\r\nis 364 which is a paper sack made out of tape, sort of a home made\r\naffair. Will you take a look at this. Does this appear to be anything\r\nlike the color of the sack you saw on the back seat?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I would say it was, it was more a color like\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It was more like this color, correct?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did it have tape on it or did you notice it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, like I say, I didn't notice that much about it as I\r\ndidn't see it very much.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you take a look at it as to the length. Does it appear\r\nto be about the same length?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. We will just use this. Was one end of the sack turned over,\r\nfolded over? Do you remember that?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, you know, like I was saying, when I glanced at it,\r\nbut I say from what I saw I didn't see very much of it, I say the bag\r\nwasn't open or anything like it where you can see the contents. If you\r\nwas going to say putting--to more or less a person putting in carefully\r\nhe would throw it in carefully, you put it more toward the back. If he\r\nhad anything folded up in it I didn't see that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you saw him get out of the car, when you first saw him\r\nwhen he was out of the car before he started to walk, you noticed he\r\nhad the package under the arm?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. One end of it was under the armpit and the other he had to\r\nhold it in his right hand. Did the package extend beyond the right hand?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir. Like I say if you put it under your armpits and\r\nput it down normal to the side.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But the right hand on, was it on the end or the side of the\r\npackage?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No; he had it cupped in his hand.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Cupped in his hand?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Take a look at this paper bag which is Commission Exhibit 364\r\nfor identification, with reference to the width.\r\n\r\nWas the bag about that width or a different width?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well. I would say it appears to me it would be pretty\r\nclose but it might be just a little bit too wide. I think it is,\r\nbecause you know yourself you would have to have a big hand with that\r\nsize but like I say he had this cupped in his hand because I remember\r\nglancing at him when he was a walking up ahead of me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This is another bag here which has been marked Commission's\r\nExhibit 142. But I don't see the stamp on it. This is FBI No. 10. This\r\nwas shown to you before, wasn't it, in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were asked if you had seen this before, weren't you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you first saw it, you felt that the bag you saw was of a\r\ndifferent color, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right, and I say they told me this one had been treated in\r\nthe lab.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. If you will note there is a part of this bag which has not\r\nbeen treated.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. So I will show you this part of this exhibit that hasn't been\r\ntreated, and tell me whether or not the paper, the color of the paper\r\nthat has not been treated, is or is not similar to the color of the\r\npaper on the bag you saw on the back seat of your car that morning.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. To be frank with you, more like I say the color, the color\r\nI saw would be more like it but I imagine if this hadn't been run\r\nthrough that process that this color here that you unwrapped would be\r\nmore closer to this. This seems to have a little bit different color to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I didn't get the answer because of the--let's refer to this\r\nbag, that is the colored bag.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Okay, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And the bag that is not colored, and the other is just a bag.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Okay, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. We are talking about the colored bag, the one that has\r\nchanged its color. There is a part of the colored bag that hasn't\r\nchanged color, isn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is the part I want to call your attention to.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The color of this bag, the colored bag, has not been treated.\r\nTake a look at it. Is that similar to the color of the bag you saw in\r\nthe back seat of your car that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It would be, surely it could have been, and it couldn't\r\nhave been. Like I say, see, you know this color, either one of these\r\ncolors, is very similar to the type of paper that you can get out of a\r\nstore or anything like that, and so I say it could have been and then\r\nit couldn't have been.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you mean by that that it is similar to the color?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And do you have a definite memory of the color of the bag you\r\nsaw on the back seat of your car so that you can distinguish between\r\none color and another?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I believe it would be more on this basis here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You say it would be more on the color of bag No. 364, is that\r\nright?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You will notice that this bag which is the colored bag, FBI\r\nExhibit No. 10, is folded over. Was it folded over when you saw it the\r\nfirst time, folded over to the end?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I will say I am not sure about that, whether it was folded\r\nover or not, because, like I say, I didn't pay that much attention to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This is Commission Exhibit No. 142.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That is the dark bag?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The dark bag is Commission Exhibit No. 142.\r\n\r\nWhen you were shown this bag, do you recall whether or not you told the\r\nofficers who showed you the bag--did you tell them whether you thought\r\nit was or was not about the same length as the bag you saw on the back\r\nseat?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I told them that as far as the length there, I told them\r\nthat was entirely too long.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What about the width?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I say, like I say now, now I couldn't see much of\r\nthe bag from him walking in front of me. Now he could have had some\r\nof it sticking out in front of his hands because I didn't see it from\r\nthe front. The only time I did see it was from the back, just a little\r\nstrip running down from your arm and so therefore, like that, I say, I\r\nknow that the bag wouldn't be that long.\r\n\r\nSo far as being that wide like I say I couldn't be sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It could have been that wide?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, you said that some of the bag might have been beyond his\r\nhands, did you say?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I said it could have, now I am not saying it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, it could have been longer than his hands?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It has been suggested that you take this bag, which is the\r\ncolored bag, Commission Exhibit No. 142, and put it under your arm just\r\nas a sample, or just to show about how he carried the bag.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Okay.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Put it under your armpit.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Like that, normally your hand would come down like that\r\nand you would say, you would have an item, like you have seen people\r\ncarry items like they would be walking along and your arm would come\r\ndown like that, just like----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But are you sure that his hand was at the end of the package\r\nor at the side of the package?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Like I said, I remember I didn't look at the package very\r\nmuch, paying much attention, but when I did look at it he did have his\r\nhands on the package like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But you said a moment ago you weren't sure whether the\r\npackage was longer or shorter.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. And his hands because I couldn't see that about the\r\npackage.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. By that, do you mean that you don't know whether the package\r\nextended beyond his hands?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. This way?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. No; lengthwise, toward his feet.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No; now I don't mean that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What do you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. What I was talking about, I said I didn't know where it\r\nextended. It could have or couldn't have, out this way, widthwise not\r\nlengthwise.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, you say it could have been wider than your\r\noriginal estimate?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But you don't think it was longer than his hands?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How tall are you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I am 6-foot, a little bit over 6-foot.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know what your arm length is?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. We can probably measure it before you leave.\r\n\r\nDid you ever see Lee taking home anything with him from the Texas Book\r\nDepository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; never did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see him taking a package home with him?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When was the last time you can remember you saw Lee?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. You mean on the 22d?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the 22d, that day.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Somewhere between it was after 10 and somewhere before\r\nnoon, because I remember I was walking down to the first floor that\r\nday, that was the only time I went up on the elevator was, like I say,\r\nfor a few minutes and, I put that box of books up and put it down, and\r\nI was on the first floor putting up books all day and I seen him back\r\nand forth and he would be walking and getting books and put on the\r\norder.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was the last time you saw him all day?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You didn't talk to him again?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you wear a coat or jacket to work that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It was chilly, was it?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you stood out on the front looking at the parade, where\r\nwas Shelley standing and where was Lovelady standing with reference to\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, see, I was standing, like I say, one step down from\r\nthe top, and Mr. Shelley was standing, you know, back from the top step\r\nand over toward the side of the wall there. See, he was standing right\r\nover there, and then Billy was a couple of steps down from me over\r\ntoward more the wall also.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Usually when Lee walked in the Building in the morning, when\r\nyou came to work with him where did he go, do you know?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir. He just walked in, say, like inside the Building,\r\nand like I say I always went and put my lunch up and hang my jacket or\r\ncoat up, whichever I wore, and he was usually around there on the first\r\nfloor there after some of them put their lunch in the refrigerator, so\r\nfar as that I never paid too much attention to what he usually did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You usually walked in together?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That is right, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you separated after you got in there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; after we got into the interior I just went and put my\r\nlunch up.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you notice where Lee kept his lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see him come into the Building on other days\r\nthan the days that he rode with you?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. You mean did I ever see him come in the Building when he\r\nrode with me?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; because when he rode with me we always walked\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. No; other than when he rode with you.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Oh, other than when he rode with me. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Did he have any particular associates around there that\r\nyou knew of?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Not that I knew of. I say he didn't mingle with other guys\r\nlike the rest of us. The rest of us usually joked back and forth with\r\npractically everybody who worked around there. But he usually kept to\r\nhimself, that was the only time he talked to anybody was when he wanted\r\nto know something about a book or something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. We have got a picture taken the day of the parade and it\r\nshows the President's car going by.\r\n\r\nNow, take a look at that picture. Can you see your picture any place\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; I don't, because I was back up in this more or\r\nless black area here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Because Billy, like I say, is two or three steps down in\r\nfront of me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you recognize this fellow?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That is Billy, that is Billy Lovelady.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Billy?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let's take a marker and make an arrow down that way. That\r\nmark is Billy Lovelady?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is where you told us you were standing a moment ago.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In front of you to the right over to the wall?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is this a Commission exhibit?\r\n\r\nWe will make this a Commission Exhibit No. 369.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 369 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is written in. The arrow marks Billy Lovelady on\r\nCommission's Exhibit No. 369.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Do you have any lockers there in which you put your\r\nclothes, and so forth?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; we don't.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Some boys hang their jackets up in there in that little\r\ndomino room where they were going to play dominoes. But here lately,\r\nI have been wondering, you know, most of us wear our jackets, what we\r\nhave on, because if you are going out there on a dock in the cold air\r\nwe usually keep them on.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On Thursday afternoon when you went home, drove on home, did\r\nhe carry any package with him?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir; he didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he have a jacket or coat on him?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of a jacket or coat did he have?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. That, you know, like I say gray jacket.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That same gray jacket?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir. Now, I can be frank with you, I had seen him\r\nwear that jacket several times, because it is cool type like when you\r\nkeep a jacket on all day, if you are working on outside or something\r\nlike that, you wouldn't go outside with just a plain shirt on.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have no further questions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Senator, have you any questions you would like to ask?\r\n\r\nI think that is all.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody else have any questions to ask? Do you have any questions?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mr. Frazier, we have here this Exhibit No. 364 which is a\r\nsack and in that we have put a dismantled gun. Don't pay any attention\r\nto that. Will you stand up here and put this under your arm and then\r\ntake hold of it at the side?\r\n\r\nNow, is that anywhere near similar to the way that Oswald carried the\r\npackage?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, you know, like I said now, I said I didn't pay much\r\nattention----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Turn around.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I didn't pay much attention, but when I did, I say, he had\r\nthis part down here, like the bottom would be short he had cupped in\r\nhis hand like that and, say, like walking from the back if you had a\r\nbig arm jacket there you wouldn't tell much from a package back there,\r\nthe physical features. If you could see it from the front like when you\r\nwalk and meet somebody you could tell about the package, but walking\r\nfrom behind you couldn't tell much about the package whatsoever about\r\nthe width. But he didn't carry it from the back. If this package were\r\nshorter he would have it cupped in his hands.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Could he have had the top of it behind his shoulder, or\r\nare you sure it was cupped under his shoulder there?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; because the way it looked, you know, like I say, he\r\nhad it cupped in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I beg your pardon?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I said from where I noticed he had it cupped in his hands.\r\nAnd I don't see how you could have it anywhere other than under your\r\narmpit because if you had it cupped in your hand it would stick over it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Could he have carried it this way?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No, sir. Never in front here. Like that. Now, that is what\r\nI was talking to you about. No, I say he couldn't because if he had you\r\nwould have seen the package sticking up like that.\r\n\r\nFrom what I seen walking behind he had it under his arm and you\r\ncouldn't tell that he had a package from the back.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you cupped the bottom of your package in the hands, will\r\nyou stand up, again, please, and the upper part of the package is not\r\nunder the armpit, the top of the package extends almost up to the level\r\nof your ear.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Or your eye level, and when you put the package under your\r\narmpit, the upper part of the package, and take a hold of the side of\r\nit with your right hand, it extends on approximately about 8 inches,\r\nabout the span of my hand, more than 8 inches, 8, 10 inches.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. If you were using a yardstick or one of these little----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I was using my hand.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I know you were, but there are some different means to\r\nmeasure it. I will say it varies, if you use a yardstick. You can go\r\nand measure something with a tape measure, with a yardstick and come\r\nup with a different measurement altogether, maybe a quarter of an inch\r\nshorter or longer.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I was asked, there was some uncertainty in your testimony as\r\nto the direction from which you heard the shots fired. Let's see if we\r\ncan illustrate it.\r\n\r\nYou heard the shots fired and you expressed an opinion that it came\r\nfrom a certain direction. I would like to clear that up, if I could, on\r\nthis map.\r\n\r\nHere is the Texas School Book Depository Building, and you were\r\nstanding right here, you said, weren't you? Can you tell me?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. You know the entrance there is not quite at that corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That close.\r\n\r\nNow, you say you heard these three sounds which you later thought were\r\nprobably shots, you thought it came from a certain direction.\r\n\r\nCan you tell us from what direction as illustrated on the map?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right. Now I say, you know where it is the straight curve\r\nthat goes under the underpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is the parkway?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right. I say it runs over this parkway, you don't have it\r\non here--anyway, I say these railroad tracks there is a series of them\r\nthat come up over this, up over this overpass there, and from where I\r\nwas standing, I say, it is my true opinion, that is what I thought, it\r\nsounded like it came from over there, in the railroad tracks.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That would be east and south?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No; that would be west and south.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. West and south?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. No; it would be north.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. No; it wouldn't be north.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes; it wouldn't be south because that is in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This is north, and you say it, I believe, it came from north?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. It would be more or less west and north were these tracks\r\nfrom this overpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Your direction was west and north as the source of the sound.\r\n\r\nWell, take a look at the map that does show the overpass and you will\r\nput a mark on that.\r\n\r\nDid any other people who were standing there with you express any\r\nopinion as to where they thought the sounds came from?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Well, I say, after we found out it was shots I see some of\r\nthe other people around there said when they were staying there, said\r\nthat is what it was, downward right back from us, like where we were\r\nstanding. If we had been standing somewhere else you might have gotten\r\na different opinion, but from where we were standing on the steps there\r\nit sounded like back down to the right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Here is a Commission Exhibit, No. 347. It is an aerial\r\nphotograph, and it shows the Texas School Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Here is the Depository Building here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is right, sir. Here is the parkway.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Here are the overpasses here.\r\n\r\nCan you show us on that map where you think--will that map--can you\r\non that map indicate the general direction from which you thought the\r\nsounds came from?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; because we were standing right here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Don't mark it up right now.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right. But what I am trying to say is we were standing\r\ndown there, and back over here, this over here is more or less a\r\nknoll, and you can look over there and see this. You see this furthest\r\nleft line that curved around here is the ones we take to come out on\r\nStemmons Expressway, and this is a high knoll up here which runs where\r\nthe tracks are, from standing there it sounded like it came from this\r\ngeneral area over here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Just mark on that if you can, if you can mark a source.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. This is where it is.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mark a circle.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. I would say just like over in here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let's make it a little heavier. In that general direction?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Yes, sir. That was just part of the knoll.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The circle marked on No. 347, we will identify it with an\r\n\"F,\" the circle marked \"F\" represents the direction, general direction,\r\nof a source of sound as you--as occurred to you as you stood on the\r\nfront steps of the Texas Book Depository Building, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have no further questions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Anything from you, Senator?\r\n\r\nWell, that will be all. Thank you very much for coming and testifying\r\nbefore the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. FRAZIER. Thank you, Mr. Warren.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right, bring in the next witness.\r\n\r\nThe Commission will be in order.\r\n\r\nMrs. Randle, I will just read you a brief statement of the purpose of\r\nour meeting today.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of today's hearing is to hear the testimony of Buell Wesley\r\nFrazier and Linnie Mae Randle. The Commission has been advised that\r\nthese two witnesses have stated that they saw Lee Harvey Oswald on the\r\nmorning of November 22, 1963. The Commission proposes to ask these\r\nwitnesses questions concerning their knowledge of the assassination of\r\nPresident Kennedy.\r\n\r\nYou have a copy of that, do you not?\r\n\r\nVery well, Mr. Ball will conduct the examination.\r\n\r\nWill you rise and be sworn, please?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you give before this Commission\r\nwill be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help\r\nyou God?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Please be seated.\r\n\r\nMr. Ball?\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF LINNIE MAE RANDLE\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mrs. Randle, where do you live?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. 2438 Westfield, Irving, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you live there with your husband and three daughters, do\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And your brother?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Wesley?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long has Wesley been living there?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Since September, somewhere around the first, I am not sure\r\njust the date.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know Mrs. Ruth Paine?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. She is a neighbor that lives up the street from me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When did you first meet Mrs. Paine?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Well, for a period, I am not sure of this, it is quite 2\r\nyears, I lived across the street from her. I didn't visit with her, but\r\nI visited with her neighbor who lives next door.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is her name?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Mrs. Dorothy Roberts.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is on Fifth Street in Irving, Tex.?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. That is right; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was before you moved down the street to the corner of\r\nWestfield and Fifth Street?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You had never visited in Mrs. Paine's home?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. I was in her home on one occasion that I remember at a\r\nbirthday party for one of her children and she invited mine.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long ago?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. It has been about a year ago.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is the only time you have visited Mrs. Paine?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever meet Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When did you meet her?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. The first time I met her was over at this Mrs. Roberts.\r\nI had gone up there to see Mrs. Roberts and her, Mrs. Oswald and Mrs.\r\nPaine was over there drinking coffee, that was the first time I met her.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When was that?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Well, I believe it was the first week in October.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is the first time you had ever met Mrs. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Officially met her. I had seen her out in the yard and\r\nthrough the neighbor I knew who she was. I hadn't met her until that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see her again to talk to her, Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Well, she couldn't speak English, \"How are you\" and things\r\nlike that was about all she could say and I did visit with Mrs. Roberts\r\nquite often and so she would be out in the yard and she would speak.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In whose yards, Mrs. Roberts' yard or Mrs. Paine's?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Mrs. Paine's. She played with her children, and kept the\r\nyard and things like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But on this one occasion she was in the house, Mrs. Roberts'\r\nhouse?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Mrs. Roberts.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. With Mrs. Paine, Mrs. Roberts and yourself?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there some conversation at that time about her husband\r\nLee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Well, they had--it was just general knowledge in the\r\nneighborhood that he didn't have a job and she was expecting a baby. Of\r\ncourse, I didn't know where he was or anything. And of course you know\r\njust being neighborly and everything, we felt sorry for Marina because\r\nher baby was due right away as we understood it, and he didn't have any\r\nwork, so they said, so it was just----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mrs. Paine told you that Lee didn't have any work?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Well, I suppose. It was just in conversation.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Marina didn't take part in the conversation?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. No. She couldn't. So far as I know, she couldn't speak.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You and Mrs. Roberts and Mrs. Paine talked about it?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there anything said then about the Texas School Book\r\nDepository as a place he might get a job?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Well, we didn't say that he might get a job, because\r\nI didn't know there was a job open. The reason that we were being\r\nhelpful, Wesley had just looked for a job, and I had helped him to try\r\nto find one. We listed several places that he might go to look for\r\nwork. When you live in a place you know some places that someone with,\r\nyou know, not very much of an education can find work.\r\n\r\nSo, it was among one of the places that we mentioned. We mentioned\r\nseveral others, and Mrs. Paine said that well, he couldn't apply for\r\nany of the jobs that would require driving because he couldn't drive,\r\nand it was just in conversation that you might talk just any day and\r\nnot think a thing on earth about it. In fact, I didn't even know that\r\nhe had even tried any place that we mentioned.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What were some of the other places mentioned?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Well, I remember two of them. Mrs. Roberts entered into\r\nthe conversation and, of course, she is more familiar with the place\r\nthan I am. It was Manor Bakeries which was a home delivery service.\r\n\r\nThen there was this Texas Gypsum which makes sheet rock and things like\r\nthat, and we mentioned because Wesley had tried those places that I\r\nmentioned those.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And then you also mentioned the Texas Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Well, I didn't know there was a job opening over there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But did you mention it?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. But we said he might try over there. There might be\r\nwork over there because it was the busy season but I didn't have any\r\nprevious knowledge that there was any job opening.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you later learn that Lee had applied for a job?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. She told me, Mrs. Paine told me, later that he had applied\r\nfor the job, and had gotten the job and she thanked us for naming the\r\nplaces and things like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you tell your brother that a fellow named Lee Oswald was\r\ngoing to work for them?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. No, sir; I didn't even know his name. She said Lee so I\r\njust assumed that was his last name and I just merely mentioned to\r\nWesley that he had got the job or a job over there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That Lee had the job?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. That Mrs. Paine said that, I had told Wesley that he\r\nmight--that she said he was going to call over there.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Mrs. Paine asked me if I would call and see if there was a\r\njob available and I told her, no, that I didn't know anybody over\r\nthere, and if she wanted to call over the place she would have to do it\r\nbecause I didn't know if there was any job openings over there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You told Wesley, though, that you had--Mrs. Paine had told\r\nyou that Lee had applied for a job and gotten a job there?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Sir, I don't remember if I mentioned it to him or not.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you said a moment ago that you had mentioned something\r\nto Wesley?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. I might have had. But I can't say for sure I did because\r\nat the time it was unimportant to me. It didn't really matter.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, you are not sure whether you did or didn't?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. That is right. I might have, I don't know maybe for sure\r\nif I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did Lee tell you at sometime that he had started to drive?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. I never talked to Lee.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did Wesley tell you that he was driving Lee home weekends or\r\ndriving him to Irving weekends?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Wesley had told me that he asked to ride out on weekends.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see him arrive with Lee?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you recall on a Thursday night, November 21 that you saw\r\nLee get out of Wesley's car?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About what time of night was it?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. About 5:20, I believe, 5:15 or 5:25 something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you when you saw him?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. I was on my way to the grocery store.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you talk to Wesley about the fact that he had brought Lee\r\nhome on this night?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you think it was unusual that he had come home that night?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Well, I knew that he had--Friday is the only time he had\r\never ridden with him before which was a couple of times, I don't think\r\nhe rode with him over three times, I am not sure but I never did know\r\nof him arriving, you know, except on Friday.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, did you mention to Wesley that night or did you ask\r\nWesley that night how Lee happened to come home on Thursday?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. I might have asked him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember anything about curtain rods?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What do you remember about that?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. He had told Wesley----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Tell me what Wesley told you.\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. What Wesley told me. That Lee had rode home with him to\r\nget some curtain rods from Mrs. Paine to fix up his apartment.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When did Wesley tell you that?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Well, that afternoon I suppose I would have had to ask\r\nhim, he wouldn't have just told me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean that night?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. After he came home?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. I was on my way to the store. So I probably asked him when\r\nI got back what he was doing riding home with him on Thursday afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You think that was the time that Wesley told you----\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir; after I got back home.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That Lee had come home to get some curtain rods?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, I am sure he told me that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The next morning did you get breakfast for Wesley, you, and\r\nyour mother?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes; mother and my children.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you were packing his lunch, too, were you?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see Lee?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you see him?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. I saw him as he crossed the street and come across my\r\ndriveway to where Wesley had his car parked by the carport.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What street did he cross to go over?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. He crossed Westbrook.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you saw him walking along, did you?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was he carrying any package?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes; he was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was he carrying?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. He was carrying a package in a sort of a heavy brown bag,\r\nheavier than a grocery bag it looked to me. It was about, if I might\r\nmeasure, about this long, I suppose, and he carried it in his right\r\nhand, had the top sort of folded down and had a grip like this, and the\r\nbottom, he carried it this way, you know, and it almost touched the\r\nground as he carried it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let me see. He carried it in his right hand, did he?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And where was his hand gripping the middle of the package?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. No, sir; the top with just a little bit sticking up. You\r\nknow just like you grab something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And he was grabbing it with his right hand at the top of the\r\npackage and the package almost touched the ground?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He walked over to your house, did he?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Well, I saw him as he started crossing the street. Where\r\nhe come from then I couldn't say.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You don't know where he went from that?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Where he went?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see him go to the car?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did he do?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. He opened the right back door and I just saw that he was\r\nlaying the package down so I closed the door. I didn't recognize him\r\nas he walked across my carport and I at that moment I wondered who was\r\nfixing to come to my back door so I opened the door slightly and saw\r\nthat it--I assumed he was getting in the car but he didn't, so he come\r\nback and stood on the driveway.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He put the package in the car.\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir; I don't know if he put it on the seat or on the\r\nfloor but I just know he put it in the back.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. We have got a package here which is marked Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 364. You have seen this before, I guess, haven't you, I think the\r\nFBI showed it to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was the color of that package in any way similar to the color\r\nof this package which is 364?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Similar kind of paper, wasn't it?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, was the length of it any similar, anywhere near similar?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Well, it wasn't that long, I mean it was folded down at\r\nthe top as I told you. It definitely wasn't that long.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How about the width?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. The width is about right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The width is about right.\r\n\r\nCan you stand up here and show us how he was carrying it. Using this\r\npackage as an example only?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. What he had in there, it looked too long.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This looks too long?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About how long would you think the package would be, just\r\nmeasure it right on there.\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. I would say about like this.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean from here to here?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir; with that folded down with this much for him to\r\ngrip in his hand.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This package is about the span of my hand, say 8 inches, is\r\nthat right? He would have about this much to grip?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. What I remember seeing is about this long, sir, as I told\r\nyou it was folded down so it could have been this long.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I see. You figure about 2 feet long, is that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. A little bit more.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. A little more than 2 feet.\r\n\r\nThere is another package here. You remember this was shown you. It is a\r\ndiscolored bag, which is Exhibit No. 142, and remember you were asked\r\nby the Federal Bureau of Investigation agents if this looked like the\r\npackage; do you remember?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, first of all with color, you told them the bag was not\r\nthe color?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But they showed you a part of the bag that had not been\r\ndiscolored, didn't they?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Looking at this part of the bag which has not been discolored\r\ndoes that appear similar to the color of the bag you saw Lee carrying\r\nthat morning?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes; it is a heavy type of wrapping paper.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, with reference to the width of this bag, does that look\r\nabout the width of the bag that he was carrying?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. I would say so; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What about length?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. You mean the entire bag?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. There again you have the problem of all this down here. It\r\nwas folded down, of course, if you would take it from the bottom----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Fold it to about the size that you think it might be.\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. This is the bottom here, right. This is the bottom, this\r\npart down here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I believe so, but I am not sure. But let's say it is.\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. And this goes this way, right? Do you want me to hold it?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. About this.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that about right? That is 28-1/2 inches.\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. I measured 27 last time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You measured 27 once before?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How was Lee dressed that morning?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. He had on a white T-shirt, I just saw him from the waist\r\nup, I didn't pay any attention to his pants or anything, when he was\r\ngoing with the package. I was more interested in that. But he had on a\r\nwhite T-shirt and I remember some sort of brown or tan shirt and he had\r\na gray jacket, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. A gray jacket. I will show you some clothing here. First, I\r\nwill show you a gray jacket. Does this look anything like the jacket he\r\nhad on?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That morning?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Similar to that. I didn't pay an awful lot of attention to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was it similar in color?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir; I think so. It had big sleeves.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Take a look at these sleeves. Was it similar in color?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. I believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is the Commission Exhibit on this jacket?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. It was gray, I am not sure of the shade.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. 163.\r\n\r\nI will show you another shirt which is Commission No. 150.\r\n\r\nDoes this look anything like the shirt he had on?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Well now, I don't remember it being that shade of brown.\r\nIt could have been but I was looking through the screen and out the\r\nwindow but I don't remember it being exactly that. I thought it was a\r\nsolid color.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Here is another jacket which is a gray jacket, does this look\r\nanything like the jacket he had on?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. No, sir; I remember its being gray.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, this one is gray but of these two the jacket I last\r\nshowed you is Commission Exhibit No. 162, and this blue gray is 163,\r\nnow if you had to choose between these two?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. I would choose the dark one.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You would choose the dark one?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which is 163, as being more similar to the jacket he had?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir; that I remember. But I, you know, didn't pay an\r\nawful lot of attention to his jacket. I remember his T-shirt and the\r\nshirt more so than I do the jacket.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The witness just stated that 163 which is the gray-blue is\r\nsimilar to the jacket he had on. 162, the light gray jacket was not.\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have no further questions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN.. Senator, have you any questions?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. No questions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Have you any questions, Mr. Powell?\r\n\r\nMr. POWELL. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I think I do have one.\r\n\r\nPrior to the assassination of President Kennedy, did any FBI agents or\r\npolice officer ever visit your house?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. And said anything to you about Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Could I ask, Mr. Chief Justice, along the line Senator\r\nCooper touched on--whether there had been any conversation in the\r\nneighborhood prior to the assassination of any FBI agents or police\r\nofficers having visited in the neighborhood?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You heard nothing along rumors of that kind?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. No. Later, after all this was over, I had heard that they\r\nhad been to Mrs. Paine's residence.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But there was no excitement in the neighborhood up to that\r\npoint?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have one question, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nYou used an expression there, that the bag appeared heavy.\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You meant that there was some weight appeared to be----\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. To the bottom.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. To the bottom?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes. It tapered like this as he hugged it in his hand. It\r\nwas more bulky toward the bottom than it was this way.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Toward the top? More bulky toward the bottom than toward the\r\ntop?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have no further questions.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. On that point--did you see Lee Oswald place the package\r\nin the automobile?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. In the automobile. I do not know if he put it on the seat\r\nor on the floor.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I mean did you see him throw open the door?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. When he placed the package in there do you remember\r\nwhether he used one hand or two?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. No; because I only opened the door briefly and what made\r\nme establish the door on Wesley's car, it is an old car and that door,\r\nthe window is broken and everything and it is hard to close, so that\r\ncinched in my mind which door it was, too. But it was only briefly that\r\nI looked.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chief Justice, could I ask--how far away were you? You\r\nwere at the kitchen door and the automobile was in the driveway, what\r\nwas the distance between yourself and Mr. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Sir, I don't know. The carport will take care of two cars,\r\nand then Wesley's car was on the other side of the carport so that\r\nwould be three car lengths plus inbetween space.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Car widths?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Car widths, excuse me.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was it a light day?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. It was sort of cloudy, but there wasn't any--I mean it\r\nwasn't dark or anything like that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you be good enough as you can recall--can you recall\r\nwhat the fabric of the jacket was that Mr. Oswald had on this morning,\r\nwas it twill or wool or gabardine? Cotton?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Probably cotton or gabardine, something like that that\r\nwould repel water probably, and that is just my own opinion.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is your present recollection?\r\n\r\nMrs. RANDLE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mrs. Randle, thank you very much for coming, you may be\r\nexcused.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF CORTLANDT CUNNINGHAM\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you state your name for the record?\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. Cortlandt Cunningham.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Cunningham, will you raise your right hand and be\r\nsworn, please?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony given before this Commission will\r\nbe the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you\r\nGod?\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mr. Cunningham, be seated there.\r\n\r\nWhat is your business?\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. I am a special agent of the FBI.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is your specialty with the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. I am assigned to the FBI laboratory in the Firearms\r\nIdentification Unit.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There is a rifle here that has been identified as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 139, it has been in your custody, hasn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. It has.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You brought it over here this morning?\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And I requested you disassemble it?\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let's take it out of the sack and put it before the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nDo you need any special tools to assemble this rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I notice you have a screwdriver there. Can you assemble it\r\nwithout the use of a screwdriver?\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What can you use?\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. Any object that would fit the slots on the five screws\r\nthat retain the stock to the action.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Could you do it with a 10-cent piece?\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you do that--about how long will it take you?\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. I know I can do it, but I have never been timed as far\r\nas using a dime. I have been timed using a screwdriver, which required\r\na little over 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. 2 minutes with a screwdriver.\r\n\r\nTry it with the dime and let's see how long it takes.\r\n\r\nOkay. Start now. Six minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. I think I can improve on that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And the only tool you used was a 10-cent piece?\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is all.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Does the bolt work all right now?\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. Once in a while with regard to the top portion--namely\r\nthe retaining screw and the top stock--you have trouble getting them\r\nengaged on this particular model.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. That is the case on this weapon. On that one over\r\nthere, however, it slid right on when I put it together a little while\r\nago; it was much faster.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes. This is a weapon identical to the one that has been\r\nidentified as the assassination weapon?\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. This is the assassination weapon.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This is the weapon found on the sixth floor of the Texas Book\r\nDepository.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. May I ask, have you fired it?\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. Many times.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That has been fired many times?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You can disassemble it in a lesser amount of time, I assume.\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. Definitely, it comes apart much faster. I can do it for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I understand with a screwdriver you put the rifle\r\ntogether in 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. Yes, sir; a few seconds over 2 minutes, somewhere\r\naround 2-1/4, 2-1/2 minutes, readily.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. And I am sure I can assemble it faster the second time\r\nwith a dime than I did the last time but I did have trouble with that\r\none retaining screw.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Is there anything more you have on this?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. No.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Anybody?\r\n\r\nWell, Agent Cunningham, thank you very much, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Gentlemen, if there are no further witnesses today,\r\nwe will adjourn for the day, and we will meet tomorrow morning at 9\r\no'clock for the purpose of taking further testimony.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 12:45 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thursday, March 12, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF WILLIAM WAYNE WHALEY AND CECIL J. McWATTERS\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 9:20 a.m. on March 12, 1964, 200\r\nMaryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Cooper\r\nand Representative Gerald R. Ford, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; Joseph A. Ball,\r\nassistant counsel; David W. Belin, assistant counsel; Melvin Aron\r\nEisenberg, assistant counsel; Lewis F. Powell, Jr. and Charles Murray,\r\nobservers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF WILLIAM WAYNE WHALEY\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Whaley, the purpose of our meeting today is to\r\ntake some further testimony concerning the events surrounding the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy, and we understand you have some\r\nfacts that will bear on it in a way and we would like to ask you\r\nquestions concerning it.\r\n\r\nWill you rise, please, raise your right hand to be sworn?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing\r\nbut the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I do, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Will you be seated, please? Mr. Ball will conduct the\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mr. Whaley, what is your business?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I am a taxi driver, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long have you been a taxi driver?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. 37 years.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You worked all that time in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is your residence?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. 619 Pine Street, Route 2, Louisville, Tex., 26 miles north\r\nof Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But you drive a taxicab in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Whom do you work for?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. City Transportation Company.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You are an employee of theirs, are you?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You don't own your own cab?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir; they don't allow that in that city.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long have you worked for that company?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. 37 years. Not for that company, sir, but for the original\r\nowners, it started out. I have been in with that original company but\r\nall banded together in one cab company.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you on duty on the 22nd of November 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What were your hours that day at work?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Well, my hours run from 6 to 4, sir; 6 in the morning to 4\r\nin the afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of a cab were you driving on that day?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. A 1961 Checker.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was it equipped with radio equipment?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You can call in to your dispatcher?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; I can.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. By a two-way radio?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you operate on cab stands or do you cruise?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir; you just go out in the morning and wherever they\r\nsend you you go to work and wherever you unload you check in they give\r\nyou another call like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About 12:30 that day where were you?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Well, about 12:30 as you say, sir; I was at the Greyhound\r\nbus station. I have a copy of my trip sheet here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Could I see that, please?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. The FBI took the original and the pictures of the cab and\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is what I have been waiting for.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I think it is supposed to be delivered to you, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is right. I am glad you have that copy.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I thought maybe you might need it. You look down there it\r\nsays Greyhound, 500 North Beckley, I think it is marked 12:30 to 12:45.\r\nNow that could have been 10 minutes off in each direction because I\r\ndidn't use a watch, I just guess, in other words, all my trips are\r\nmarked about 15 minutes each.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I am going to let you use this manifest to refresh your\r\nmemory, Mr. Whaley. I have seen it. I am going to ask you some\r\nquestions and you refresh your memory if you will from the manifest.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, describe the document you are using, what is that?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. It is a trip sheet manifest. The company gets the amount of\r\nmoney you have run, your meter reading and all, and they have to keep\r\nit because of the city ordinance requirement that the taxis make this\r\nkind of manifest.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Tell me when you make the entries, you make the entries when?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Sometimes I make them right after I make the trips, sir,\r\nand sometimes I make three or four trips before I make the entries.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Are you required by your employer to describe the trip, where\r\nyou went, how far it was?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Not by the employer, sir. All the employers are interested\r\nin are the meter reading and your tolls. The city of Dallas ordinance\r\nrequires that you put down where you picked the passenger up, where you\r\nunload the passenger. They are not interested in the price, the number\r\nof passengers and the time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, the manifest does contain that information, though, does\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; it does.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you describe the different columns of the manifest, that\r\ninformation that is in each column generally?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Over on the left side, where you see call or pickup, if you\r\nget the call on your radio you mark with a \"C\" and if somebody hails\r\nyou on the street that is marked \"P\" for pickup.\r\n\r\nIn the next column it has the trip numbers from one to fifty.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The number of the trips you make that day?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir. In the third column it says \"from.\" Like this\r\nfirst one, 4924 Belmont and then to the next column, to the airport.\r\n\r\nThe next column is the \"meter reading,\" what the meter said, $1.75. The\r\nnext column says \"flat rate.\" If it had been an extra passenger or so\r\nand you had a flat rate you would put it in that column.\r\n\r\nThe third column is \"charge,\" the people who have the charge accounts\r\nthrough the company in the car, you put the meter reading in there\r\nbecause you don't get cash and you put charge, the company takes it off.\r\n\r\nThe next column says the number of passengers and that first trip was\r\nfour passengers, time out six o'clock, I got that trip out of the barn\r\nand it is marked \"call.\"\r\n\r\n6:20 is \"time in.\" \"Mileage in\" was 44. Now, see I didn't put the\r\nmileage out on the first one, the mileage out is up here, 35 to 44. It\r\nwould have been nine miles I made on the first trip.\r\n\r\nOver here on the side here, it has the number of trips I made that\r\nday which is 21, on the meter registered 21 trips 45 cents a trip is\r\n$9.45. 157 units, a unit is a dime clicks every four-tenths of a mile.\r\nThat would be 157 units at $15.70. Added total of $25.15. I used 5-1/2\r\ngallons of gas, had eight pickups in 13 calls and 29 passengers. That\r\nis it complete, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I see.\r\n\r\nNow, look at your manifest and tell me where you were at 12 o'clock the\r\nday of November 22, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. 12 o'clock I got a call to the Travis Hotel. I have got it\r\nmarked 16 which is the Continental bus station, stand No. 15, 55 cents.\r\nI unloaded that at 12:15.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then where did you go at 12:15 according to your record?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. According to my record I got a pickup at the Continental\r\nbus station which is stand 16 and went to the Greyhound which is 55\r\ncents. I unloaded at the Greyhound, I have got it marked 12:30. See\r\nthere is that 15 minutes you say I am off, I just mark it 15, I don't\r\nput the correct time on the sheet because they don't require it, sir,\r\nbut anywhere approximate.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, it took you about 15 minutes to go----\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. It actually took about nine minutes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you put the trip ending Greyhound around 12:30?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You remember that trip, do you, you remember the fact that\r\nyou took the trip to the Greyhound and parked your car at the Greyhound\r\nor your cab at the Greyhound, don't you?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; I remember it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you standing at the Greyhound, at your cab stand at the\r\nGreyhound, long before you picked up another passenger?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir, there was no one at the Greyhound stand and when\r\nI unloaded at the door I just pulled up about 30 feet to the stand\r\nand stopped and then I wanted a package of cigarettes, I was out so I\r\nstarted to get out and I saw this passenger coming so I waited for him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He was coming down the street?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. He was walking down the street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What street was he walking down?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Lamar.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Would that mean he was walking south on Lamar?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. He was walking south on Lamar from Commerce when I saw him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That would be on which side of the street?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. The west side of the street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. South on Lamar?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you notice how he was dressed?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir. I didn't pay much attention to it right then. But\r\nit all came back when I really found out who I had. He was dressed in\r\njust ordinary work clothes. It wasn't khaki pants but they were khaki\r\nmaterial, blue faded blue color, like a blue uniform made in khaki.\r\nThen he had on a brown shirt with a little silverlike stripe on it and\r\nhe had on some kind of jacket, I didn't notice very close but I think\r\nit was a work jacket that almost matched the pants.\r\n\r\nHe, his shirt was open three buttons down here. He had on a T-shirt.\r\nYou know, the shirt was open three buttons down there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, what happened after that, will you tell us in your own\r\nwords what he did?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Well, on this which was the 14th trip when I picked up at\r\nthe Greyhound I marked it 12:30 to 12:45.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You say that can be off 15 minutes?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. That can be off either direction.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Anything up to 15 minutes, you say?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; I wrote that trip up the same time I wrote the\r\none up from the Continental bus station to the Greyhound, I marked this\r\n12:15 to 12:30 and started 12:30 to 12:45. And the next one starts at\r\n1:15 to 1:30 and it goes on all day long every 15 minutes the time\r\nkeeps pretty approximate.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let's take the 12:30 trip, tell me about that, what the\r\npassenger said.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. He said, \"May I have the cab?\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"You sure can. Get in.\" And instead of opening the back door he\r\nopened the front door, which is allowable there, and got in.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Got in the front door?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir. The front seat. And about that time an old lady,\r\nI think she was an old lady, I don't remember nothing but her sticking\r\nher head down past him in the door and said, \"Driver, will you call me\r\na cab down here?\"\r\n\r\nShe had seen him get this cab and she wanted one, too, and he opened\r\nthe door a little bit like he was going to get out and he said, \"I will\r\nlet you have this one,\" and she says, \"No, the driver can call me one.\"\r\n\r\nSo, I didn't call one because I knew before I could call one one would\r\ncome around the block and keep it pretty well covered.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that what you said?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir; that is not what I said, but that is the reason I\r\ndidn't call one at the time and I asked him where he wanted to go. And\r\nhe said, \"500 North Beckley.\"\r\n\r\nWell, I started up, I started to that address, and the police cars, the\r\nsirens was going, running crisscrossing everywhere, just a big uproar\r\nin that end of town and I said, \"What the hell. I wonder what the hell\r\nis the uproar?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he never said anything. So I figured he was one of these people\r\nthat don't like to talk so I never said any more to him.\r\n\r\nBut when I got pretty close to 500 block at Neches and North Beckley\r\nwhich is the 500 block, he said, \"This will do fine,\" and I pulled over\r\nto the curb right there. He gave me a dollar bill, the trip was 95\r\ncents. He gave me a dollar bill and didn't say anything, just got out\r\nand closed the door and walked around the front of the cab over to the\r\nother side of the street. Of course, traffic was moving through there\r\nand I put it in gear and moved on, that is the last I saw of him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you parked your car you parked on what street?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I wasn't parked, I was pulled to the curb on Neches and\r\nNorth Beckley.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Neches, corner of Neches and North Beckley?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Which is the 500 block.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What direction was your car?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. South.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The cab was headed?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. South.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And it would be on the west side of the street?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Parked, stopped on the west side of the intersection, yes,\r\nsir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When he got out of the cab did he go around in front of your\r\ncab?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. He went around in front, yes, sir; crossed the street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Across to the east side of the street?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see whether he walked south?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I didn't see whether he walked north or south from there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, he walked east from your cab and that is the\r\nlast time you saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there anything in particular about him beside his\r\nclothing that you could identify such as jewelry, bracelets?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; he had on a bracelet of some type on his left\r\narm. It looked like an identification bracelet. Just shiny, you know,\r\nhow you see anything shiny, an unusual watchband or something shiny,\r\nyou notice things like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have a map of Dallas here, which I would like to have\r\nmarked as the Commission's next exhibit which is Exhibit No. 371.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It will be so marked.\r\n\r\n(The map referred to was marked Commission's Exhibit No. 371 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I would like to offer into evidence Exhibits Nos. 368 and 369\r\nthat were marked yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. They may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibits Nos. 368 and 369, heretofore marked for\r\nidentification, were received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And 371 being a form map of Dallas can probably be offered\r\nin evidence at this time. It is going to be used to illustrate the\r\nwitness' testimony.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That may be done.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 371, heretofore marked for identification was\r\nreceived in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There is a map here which is described as Dallas street map,\r\nRepublic National Bank of Dallas, and in one corner of this map there\r\nis shown a small map of downtown Dallas.\r\n\r\nWill you point on the map there to the Greyhound bus station?\r\n\r\nLet's take the small map. It was on the corner of Jackson?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. And Lamar.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And Lamar.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. The northwest corner, Greyhound bus station.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You have seen this map before, have you not?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; I am very familiar with that map.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And let's take Lamar, here is Jackson.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Lamar is down here, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This is Jackson, this is the Houston viaduct.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Here is Jackson, and Lamar is right there.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Well, the Greyhound bus station is on the northwest corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Suppose we make an \"X\" there at Jackson.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. All right, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And Lamar. That is where you picked your passenger up?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you started out which direction did you go, and before\r\nyou mark just take this blunt end and then we will mark it after you\r\ndescribe it on the map.\r\n\r\nNow, the next street is Austin, just to the west of Lamar?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I turned to the left.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I turned to the left off Lamar onto Jackson, went one block\r\nto Austin, then from Austin I turned to the left again and went one\r\nblock over to Wood Street.\r\n\r\nNow, the reason for that is if you catch this light right at Lamar and\r\nJackson, this other light turns green as you make your turn here and\r\nthe other one turns green as you make your turn at Wood. You just move\r\nthrough traffic. That was my reason for making the turn.\r\n\r\nThen I turned left on Wood off Austin and went straight on down Wood to\r\nHouston which is the street which we call the old viaduct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You call that the Houston Street viaduct?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes.\r\n\r\n(At this point Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Went across the viaduct to Zangs, as soon as you get across\r\nthe angle to the left, that is Zangs Boulevard.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Take the black pen and draw your course along this small map\r\nas far as you can go and we will go to the continuation of the map.\r\n\r\nNow, can you tell us--did everybody see this course--now can you tell\r\nus where you were when the sirens were blowing and you saw police cars\r\nall around?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I was still at the Greyhound, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were still there?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. They were there when I loaded.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, in the course of your travel down to the Houston viaduct\r\ndid you see any police cars?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Oh, yes, sir; lots of them, what we call triangle,\r\nthree-wheeled motorcycle, they all seemed to be converging on one spot.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What spot?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Well, it seemed to be the courthouse, that is what it\r\nseemed to me at that time. I didn't know what had happened.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The courthouse is about a block from the Texas State Book\r\nDepository?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. You could throw a baseball from one building to the other.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now we will turn to the large map and we will still use\r\nthe--get downtown. Here we are. Will you use--Lamar and Jackson again.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. This will be kind of ticklish because that is very small.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Main, Commerce, Jackson, Lamar.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do the same thing.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. To Austin, to Wood, to Houston, to the viaduct, across\r\nthe viaduct, let's see, Colorado comes in off this, this is the Zangs\r\nBoulevard, the red line where it hits Marcel is here, that is Zangs\r\nBoulevard. Up past Colorado, still going Zangs here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You are going along Zangs, will you go along----\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I am trying to find Beckley, the green light changed from\r\nred to green on Beckley, right here is an intersection; Zangs Boulevard\r\ngoes on up, and Beckley turns off.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Here is Neches right here.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Let me see where Neches is, is that right? Yes, that is it.\r\nThis is the intersection right there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. We put an \"X\" there.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. That is where he got off.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is where you dropped your passenger, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. That is--as far as I can see that is Neches.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is Neches, that is Beckley.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; that is right, because that is the 500 block of\r\nNorth Beckley.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, we will mark the beginning of your trip on the large map\r\nas \"Y\", and where you dropped your passenger as an \"X\".\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. \"Y\" is the corner of Lamar and Jackson, and \"X\" is the corner\r\nof Neches and Beckley.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. O.K.\r\n\r\nCan you tell me what distance that was?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Well, it was 95 cents on the meter, the meter starts off at\r\n45 cents, then it goes four-tenths of a mile and it clicks a dime which\r\nwould be 55, then a dime every four-tenths of a mile after that and it\r\nwas almost ready to click a $1.05 when it stopped, so I imagine that\r\nwould be 55 cents, would be eight-tenths of a mile and then after the\r\nfirst 45 cents it runs 25 cents a mile, because it gets a dime every\r\nfour-tenths.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. So you had 95 cents?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. 65 cents would be three, four-tenths, would be 1 mile and\r\ntwo-tenths. 75 would be one mile and six-tenths. 85 would be one--would\r\nbe 2 miles. 95 would be 2 and four-tenths, almost ready to click.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What do you give them for 45 cents?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Four-tenths of a mile.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Four-tenths of a mile?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. It goes four-tenths of a mile.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Five clicks after the first?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. 45 cents.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, then, you ran about----\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. About 2-1/2 miles, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Two and one-half miles?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Approximately.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Two miles and four-tenths approximately.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you give me any estimate of the time it took you to go\r\nthat 2-1/2 miles?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Not actually, sir. I run it again with the policeman\r\nbecause the policeman was worried, he run the same trip and he couldn't\r\ncome out the same time I did. But he was turning off of Jackson and\r\nLamar when the light was wrong, and he was hitting a red light at\r\nWood--I mean at Austin and Jackson and he hit a red light at Wood and\r\nAustin, then he hit a red light at Houston. Where I wait to make my\r\nturn until the light is right just after it has been green, almost\r\nready for it to come red, turn right then, then the other lights turn\r\ngreen just as fast as you get to them, go on right through, you save\r\nabout 2 minutes in traffic that way. That is where I got the 2 minutes\r\non him he never could make up. So I had to go back with him to make\r\nthat trip to to show him I was right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How much time, in that experiment, when you hit the lights\r\nright, how long did it take you?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Nine minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Nine minutes?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Nine minutes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Now on this particular trip with Oswald, do you\r\nrecall the lights being with you?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. They were with me, sir; for I timed them that way before I\r\ntook off. Because I made that so much that I know the light system and\r\nhow they are going to turn.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So this was a typical trip?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The witness has been driving a taxicab in Dallas for 36\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Thirty-seven, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Thirty-seven.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. You name an intersection in the city of Dallas and I will\r\ntell you what is on all four corners.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you stop and let your passenger out on this run on the\r\nnorth or south side of the intersection?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. On the north side, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. North side?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That would be----\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Northwest corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Northwest corner of Neches and Beckley?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Northwest corner of Neches and Beckley.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have some clothing here. Commission Exhibit No. 150, does\r\nthat look like the shirt?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. That is the shirt, sir, it has my initials on it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, this is the shirt the man had on?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; that is the same one the FBI man had me identify.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This is the shirt the man had on who took your car at Lamar\r\nand Jackson?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. As near as I can recollect as I told him. I said that is\r\nthe shirt he had on because it had a kind of little stripe in it,\r\nlight-colored stripe. I noticed that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Here are two pair of pants, Commission Exhibit No. 157 and\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 156. Does it look anything like that?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I don't think I can identify the pants except they were the\r\nsame color as that, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which color?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. More like this lighter color, at least they were cleaner or\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is 157?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But you are not sure about that?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I am not sure about the pants. I wouldn't be sure of the\r\nshirt if it hadn't had that light stripe in it. I just noticed that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Here is Commission No. 162 which is a gray jacket with zipper.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I think that is the jacket he had on when he rode with me\r\nin the cab.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Look something like it?\r\n\r\nAnd here is Commission Exhibit No. 163, does this look like anything he\r\nhad on?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. He had this one on or the other one.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. That is what I told you I noticed. I told you about the\r\nshirt being open, he had on the two jackets with the open shirt.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Wait a minute, we have got the shirt which you have\r\nidentified as the rust brown shirt with the gold stripe in it.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You said that a jacket----\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. That jacket now it might have been clean, but the jacket he\r\nhad on looked more the color, you know like a uniform set, but he had\r\nthis coat here on over that other jacket, I am sure, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This is the blue-gray jacket, heavy blue-gray jacket.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Later that day did you--were you called down to the police\r\ndepartment?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you the next day?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir; they came and got me, sir, the next day after\r\nI told my superior when I saw in the paper his picture, I told my\r\nsuperiors that that had been my passenger that day at noon. They called\r\nup the police and they came up and got me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you saw in the newspaper the picture of the man?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You went to your superior and told him you thought he was\r\nyour passenger?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did the Dallas police come out to see you?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Or FBI agents?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. The Dallas police came down and took me down and the FBI\r\nwas waiting there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Before they brought you down did they show you a picture?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. They didn't?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. They brought you down to the Dallas police station?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do there?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Well, I tried to get by the reporters, stepping over\r\ntelevision cables and you couldn't hardly get by, they would grab\r\nyou and wanted to know what you were doing down here, even with the\r\ndetectives one in front and one behind you. Then they took me in\r\nan office there and I think Bill Alexander, the Assistant District\r\nAttorney, two or three, I was introduced to two or three who were FBI\r\nmen and they wanted my deposition of what happened.\r\n\r\nSo, I told them to the best of my ability. Then they took me down in\r\ntheir room where they have their show-ups, and all, and me and this\r\nother taxi driver who was with me, sir, we sat in the room awhile and\r\ndirectly they brought in six men, young teenagers, and they all were\r\nhandcuffed together. Well, they wanted me to pick out my passenger.\r\n\r\nAt that time he had on a pair of black pants and white T-shirt, that is\r\nall he had on. But you could have picked him out without identifying\r\nhim by just listening to him because he was bawling out the policeman,\r\ntelling them it wasn't right to put him in line with these teen-agers\r\nand all of that and they asked me which one and I told them. It was him\r\nall right, the same man.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. They had him in line with men much younger?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. With five others.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Men much younger?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Not much younger, but just young kids they might have got\r\nthem in jail.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he look older than those other boys?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And he was talking, was he?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. He showed no respect for the policemen, he told them what\r\nhe thought about them. They knew what they were doing and they were\r\ntrying to railroad him and he wanted his lawyer.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did that aid you in the identification of the man?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir; it wouldn't have at all, except that I said\r\nanybody who wasn't sure could have picked out the right one just for\r\nthat. It didn't aid me because I knew he was the right one as soon as I\r\nsaw him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You don't think that that in any way influenced your\r\nidentification?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir; it did not. When you drive a taxi, sir, as long as\r\nI have, you can almost look at a man, in fact, you have to, to be able\r\nto tell whether you can trust or whether you can't trust him, what he\r\nis.\r\n\r\nNow, like you got in my taxicab and I looked you over and you told me\r\njust wait for me here and went in the building, well, I will have to\r\nknow whether I could just say, \"OK, sir.\" Or say, \"Will you leave me a\r\n$5 bill, sir?\"\r\n\r\nWhen you drive a taxi that long you learn to judge people and what I\r\nactually thought of the man when he got in was that he was a wino who\r\nhad been off his bottle for about two days, that is the way he looked,\r\nsir, that was my opinion of him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was there about his appearance that gave you that\r\nimpression? Hair mussed?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Just the slow way he walked up. He didn't talk. He wasn't\r\nin any hurry. He wasn't nervous or anything.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He didn't run?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he look dirty?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. He looked like his clothes had been slept in, sir, but\r\nhe wasn't actually dirty. The T-shirt was a little soiled around the\r\ncollar but the bottom part of it was white. You have to know those\r\nwinos, or they will get in and ride with you and there isn't nothing\r\nyou can do but call the police, the city gets the fine and you get\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who was the other cab driver?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I don't know his name, sir. He worked for the same company\r\nbut he works out of the Oak Cliff branch. They say he was the one who\r\nsaw him kill the policeman, the one who used the policeman's microphone.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that Mr. Scoggins?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. What is his name?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Scoggins.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. It could have been, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You don't know him?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I just know he drives taxi 213. He works out of Oak Cliff\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I would like to have a copy of the manifest temporarily\r\nmarked 370.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. You may have it, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Commission 370, and offer it into evidence and ask leave to\r\nsubmit the original, if it is brought in, when it is brought here by\r\nthe FBI.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes, it may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The manifest referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 370 for\r\nidentification and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This will be 370.\r\n\r\nCould we excuse Mr. Whaley now? There are two pieces of evidence to be\r\nhere and they are not here.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Excuse him and we will take the other witness.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. We will excuse him and take the other witness.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Whaley, will you wait outside until we get the other\r\nexhibits and we will finish with you very shortly.\r\n\r\nMr. McWatters, would you be seated please.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission is meeting today to take further testimony\r\nconcerning the events surrounding the assassination of President\r\nKennedy, and it is our understanding that you have some information\r\nthat would bear on that subject, and that is the reason for our asking\r\nyou to come here and testify.\r\n\r\nWould you raise your right hand to be sworn please.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you give before this Commission\r\nwill be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help\r\nyou God?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I do.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF CECIL J. McWATTERS\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Would you be seated please, and Mr. Ball will conduct the\r\ninterrogation.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mr. McWatters.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is your business?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I am a bus driver.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long have you been a bus driver?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Let's see, this coming September will be 19 years.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Whom do you work for?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. The Dallas Transit Company.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long have you worked for the Dallas Transit Company?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. It will be 19 years in September, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where do you live?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. 2523 Blyth Drive, Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On November 22,1963, were you on duty as a driver?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of a bus were you driving?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I was driving a 44-passenger, let's see, it is a\r\n44-passenger city bus made by White, I believe is the maker of the bus.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What hours of work were you assigned that day?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I was assigned that day on the particular run from\r\n11:52 until 2:27.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was your run?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Do you mean the name of the run?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What course did you take, what part of Dallas did you drive\r\nin.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I went from----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Describe it generally, you don't need to go into any detail.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I would say from northeast Dallas in the Lakewood\r\naddition of Dallas to the Oak Cliff addition of Dallas, which is, would\r\nbe southwest.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Would that be northeast to southwest?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There is a place near the downtown area of Dallas where you\r\ntimed your run, wasn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; I have after I get into town, when I get into\r\nthe downtown part of it, now St. Paul Street is my official time point\r\ngoing in, where they have a supervisor that stays at this checkpoint\r\nthere, to check all incoming vehicles.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You would be coming in from northeast Dallas at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; I am coming in from the Lakewood addition of\r\nDallas, which I came in on. The main thoroughfare is Gaston Avenue.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you got to the intersection of what street and St. Paul\r\nwhen you were timed by your dispatcher?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is Elm, Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Elm and St. Paul?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Elm and St. Paul.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. If you are ahead of time do you stop there until you are\r\nassigned a time to get in?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, sir; no sir; you don't--a man he has his watch and\r\nschedule. If you are ahead of your schedule he will come out and stop\r\nyou, in other words, and ask you if your watch is right or what is it,\r\nyou know, the idea of you being there. There is no excuse, you know for\r\na man being ahead of his schedule.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. If you are ahead of your schedule does he stop you there\r\nuntil you leave?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time are you due, according to your schedule, to leave\r\nthe corner of St. Paul and Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. 12:36.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time did you leave there that day?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I left there that day on time because coming into\r\ntown that day, I guess everybody done went to, down to, see the parade,\r\nI didn't have over four or five passengers coming into downtown.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you ahead of your schedule?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I stopped about a block before--now, just a block\r\nbefore we get to St. Paul, there is a big theater there, and it has all\r\nloading zones, no parking there and a lot of times if we are a minute\r\nor two ahead of our schedule when we pull in in front of this theater\r\nbefore we get there in time, in other words, we kill a minute.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do this day?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I was a little ahead of my schedule and I killed\r\nabout a minute, I guess, before I went to cross St. Paul Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. After your dispatcher checked you in what time did you leave\r\nthat corner of St. Paul and Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, the best I can remember I don't recall even\r\npicking up a passenger there. I think I discharged one lady passenger\r\nthere on that, to the best I can recall, because I remember that I had,\r\nwhen I crossed Field Street, I think I had five passengers on my bus.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well then, back to the question, what time did you leave that\r\nday, leave Elm and St. Paul?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I would have to say I left there around, in other\r\nwords, 12:36 because I know I was on good time when I come in there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you think you left at the time you were supposed to leave?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I am almost positive I did, because, as I say, we\r\ngenerally come in on schedules on good time because from that street on\r\nis where we generally--for the next seven or eight blocks--is where we\r\nget all of our passengers going through the downtown area.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had you heard any sirens before you got to St. Paul and Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know if your dispatcher keeps a written record?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. The only way he keeps a written record is if you are\r\nahead of your schedule. He has a little pad, and if a man is ahead of\r\nhis schedule, in other words, he writes, of course, we all go by badge\r\nnumbers, in other words, he would write your badge number, your bus\r\nnumber, and if you was ahead of schedule he would write how much ahead\r\nof schedule you were, and----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you think he did anything, did he write anything up on you\r\non that day?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir; the guy that we have down there now, if you are\r\nahead of schedule he will come out, in other words, because he stands\r\non the corner all the time, and if you are a minute or two ahead of\r\nyour schedule he will come out and if nothing else, converse with you\r\nfor a minute or two to see that you leave it on time and very seldom, I\r\nmean, if ever--of course, a report goes in on you, it goes against your\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, if he did make a record it would be by way of\r\na reprimand to you?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. As you went on down Elm you left your post at St. Paul and\r\nElm, did you hear any sirens?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you pick up any passengers?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I picked up within a period of from the time I picked up\r\ntwo or three passengers, I can't recall just exactly which stop. I have\r\nafter I leave St. Paul Street, I have Ervay Street and Akard Street,\r\nand Field Street which would be three stops where I can't recall that,\r\nexactly where I discharged or picked up passengers, because I had the\r\nfew passengers that I had which I came into town with.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well then, do you remember picking up a passenger at a place\r\nother than at a bus stop as you went down Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nAs I left Field Street, I pulled out into the, in other words, the\r\nfirst lane of traffic and traffic was beginning to back up then; in\r\nother words, it was blocked further down the street, and after I pulled\r\nout in it for a short distance there I come to a complete stop, and\r\nwhen I did, someone come up and beat on the door of the bus, and that\r\nis about even with Griffin Street.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it is a street that dead ends into Elm Street which\r\nthere is no bus stop at this street, because I stopped across Field\r\nStreet in the middle of the intersection and it is just a short\r\ndistance onto Griffin Street, and that is when someone, a man, came up\r\nand knocked on the door of the bus, and I opened the door of the bus\r\nand he got on.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were beyond Field and before you got to Griffin?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right. It was along about even with Griffin\r\nStreet before I was stopped in the traffic.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And that is about seven or eight blocks from the Texas Book\r\nDepository Building, isn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir. It would be seven, I would say that is seven,\r\nit would be about seven blocks.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. From there?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. From there, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did the man look like who knocked on your door and got\r\non your bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I didn't pay any particular attention to him. He\r\nwas to me just dressed in what I would call work clothes, just some\r\ntype of little old jacket on, and I didn't pay any particular attention\r\nto the man when he got on.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Paid his fare, did he?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; he just paid his fare and sat down on the\r\nsecond cross seat on the right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember whether or not you gave him a transfer?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Not when he got on; no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You didn't. Did you ever give him a transfer?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; I gave him one about two blocks from where he\r\ngot on.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he ask you for a transfer?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember what he said to you when he asked you for the\r\ntransfer?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, the reason I recall the incident, I had--there\r\nwas a lady that when I stopped in this traffic, there was a lady who\r\nhad a suitcase and she said, \"I have got to make a 1 o'clock train at\r\nUnion Station,\" and she said, \"I don't believe--from the looks of this\r\ntraffic you are going to be held up.\"\r\n\r\nShe said, \"Would you give me a transfer and I am going to walk on\r\ndown,\" which is about from where I was at that time about 7 or 8 blocks\r\nto Union Station and she asked me if I would give her a transfer in\r\ncase I did get through the traffic if I would pick her up on the way.\r\n\r\nSo, I said, \"I sure will.\" So I gave her a transfer and opened the door\r\nand as she was going out the gentleman I had picked up about 2 blocks\r\nasked for a transfer and got off at the same place in the middle of\r\nthe block where the lady did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where was that near, what intersection?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. It was the intersection near Lamar Street, it was\r\nnear Poydras and Lamar Street. It is a short block, but the main\r\nintersection there is Lamar Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He had been on the bus about 2 blocks?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. About 2 blocks; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Up to that time had you heard any sirens?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Not up until--now just about the time that, let's see,\r\nthat is when I left Griffin, right about the time this gentleman got on\r\nthe bus the traffic was starting and that was about the first that I\r\ncan recall of hearing the sirens, but when, in other words, when they\r\nstarted it seemed to me like they was coming from all over town.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you have a radio in your bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you hear a radio from nearby cars announcing anything\r\nabout the President's assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, there was cars that were stopped alongside of the\r\nbus and I think someone raised the window but I couldn't hear. I never\r\ndid hear anything outside of the----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you when you first heard the President had been\r\nshot?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I was sitting in the bus, there was some gentleman\r\nin front of me in a car, and he came back and walked up to the bus and\r\nI opened the door and he said, \"I have heard over my radio in my car\r\nthat the President has been--\" I believe he used the word--\"has been\r\nshot.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that when you were stalled in traffic?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right. That is when I was stalled right there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was that before or after the man got off the bus that asked\r\nfor the transfer?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That was before. In other words, at that time no one had\r\ngotten off the bus.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was your location then, near what street?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Between Poydras and Lamar, in other words, because I\r\nstayed stopped there for, I guess oh, 3 or 4 minutes anyway before I\r\nmade any progress at that one stop right there and that is where the\r\ngentleman got off the bus. In fact, I was talking to the man, the man\r\nthat come out of the car; in other words, he just stepped up in the\r\ndoor of the bus, and was telling me that what he had heard over his\r\nradio and that is when the lady who was standing there decided she\r\nwould walk and when the other gentleman decided he would also get off\r\nat that point.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At that point.\r\n\r\nWhat course did you take after that?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I still was going west, in other words, in the\r\nsame direction, going west, in other words, towards Houston Street. In\r\nother words, I went there before I changed my course which was about, I\r\nwould say, three or four blocks.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to Houston Street, in other words, I turned to the left,\r\nwhich would be south----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You went by the Texas School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; I turned at the corner of Elm Street and\r\nHouston which this book store is on the opposite corner from where I\r\nchanged course there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was traffic still heavy along there?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; the traffic was still tied up, but the police,\r\nthey opened up a lane there, they had so many buses and everything that\r\nwas tied up, they opened up, moved traffic around that they run quite a\r\nfew of these buses through there.\r\n\r\nIn other words, from two blocks on this side of where the incident\r\nhappened they had, in other words, they was turning all the traffic to\r\nthe right and to the left, in other words, north and south.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You went on down to Houston viaduct then?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, I turned after they finally let--they weren't\r\nletting any cars through at that time but they just run a bunch of\r\nthose buses through there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is there a bus stop in front of the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL, Where do you stop for that intersection?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, you stop, in other words, on this side of the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You stop on the south side of, the southeast corner of the\r\nintersection?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nIn other words, like you would be going, direct south towards the\r\nBuilding, the bus stop is on this corner over here on this side.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean the corner of Houston and Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which corner, north, south, east, west?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, it would be on the north.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. North.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. On the north.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Here is a map and maybe you can show us where the bus stop\r\nis. This is Exhibit No. 371.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. In other words, this is south, in other words.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This is west. You are going west on Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. In other words, I am going--right here is where the\r\npolice had all traffic, they wasn't allowing anything to go any further\r\nthan Market Street here.\r\n\r\nIn other words, all the traffic there they were moving was turning\r\neither to the right or left, on Market Street. But after they held us\r\nup there so long, of course, they run these buses in this right lane\r\nhere and they did open up and let a bunch of these buses go right on\r\ndown here to Houston, of course, a lot of them go straight on and a\r\nlot of them turn left to Houston Street, a lot of them go under the\r\nunderpass here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Wait a minute, you turned to the left?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I turned to the left.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. In other words, my last stop, in other words at this\r\ncorner right here on Record Street, all buses turning to the left have\r\nto stop at this corner right here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At Record and Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. At Record and Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you have a bus stop at Houston and Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; there is a bus stop there for the buses that\r\ngo on under the underpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is there a bus stop for the buses that go south on Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir; all the buses, we have to get in, this is a\r\none-way street and you have to get over in this lane here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. By the lane you mean the extreme left lane?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. The extreme left lane to make----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. To make the left turn south on Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And your last bus stop, as you go west on Elm and before you\r\nturn is the northeast corner of Record and Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; that is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You went on over to Houston Viaduct into the Oak Cliff\r\nsection, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; to the Oak Cliff section.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And there was some conversation occurred on that bus that you\r\ntold the FBI officers about?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Tell us what that was?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, there was a teenage boy, I would say 17 or 18\r\nyears of age, who was sitting to my right on the first cross seat and\r\nme and him had, we had conversationed a little while we was tied up\r\nin the traffic, you know, of the fact of we wondered where all, what\r\nall the excitement was due to the fact of the sirens and others, and\r\nafter I turned on Houston Street I said to him and I made the remark,\r\nI wonder where the President was shot, and I believe he made the\r\nremark that it was probably in the head if he was in a convertible\r\nor something to that effect. I don't remember just exactly the way\r\nwe worded it or what it was, but it was a conversation about the\r\nPresident, in other words, to where he was shot.\r\n\r\nIn other words, and he made the remark or something, he was probably\r\nshot in the head, if he was sitting in a convertible or to that effect.\r\nI really don't know just exactly at that time. Just like I say I never\r\nthought anything about it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Didn't some lady say something?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nNow, as we got on out on Marsalis, along about it was either Edgemont\r\nor Vermont, I believe it was Vermont Street, there was a lady who was\r\nfixing to cross the intersection and I stopped and asked her if she was\r\ngoing to catch the bus into town from the opposite direction, and she\r\nsaid that she was and I told her that we was off schedule, that the\r\nother bus had done went into town, and I asked her did she care to just\r\nride on to the end of the line and come back and she wouldn't have to\r\nstand there and wait, and she was getting on, and I asked her had she\r\nheard the news of the President being shot, at the time that was all I\r\nknew about it, and she said, \"No, what are you--you are just kidding\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"No, I really am not kidding you.\" I said, \"It is the truth\r\nfrom all the reliable sources that we have come in contact with,\" and\r\nthis teenage boy sitting on the side, I said \"Well, now, if you think\r\nI am kidding you,\" I said, \"Ask this gentleman sitting over here,\" and\r\nhe kind of, I don't know whether it was a grinning or smile or whatever\r\nexpression it was, and she said, \"I know you are kidding now, because\r\nhe laughed or grinned or made some remark to that effect.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I just told her no it wasn't no kidding matter, but that was part\r\nof the conversation that was said at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was this teenage boy--do you know where this teenage boy got\r\non the bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; he got on at between, he got on at the stop,\r\nin other words, I stopped in front of the Majestic theater which is a\r\nblock before I get to St. Paul; in other words, it is a middle of the\r\nstop, block stop, in other words. We pull in and stop in the center of\r\nthe block, and my next stop would be St. Paul; in other words, that is\r\nwhere the teenage boy got on.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He was on the bus when this man knocked on the door of your\r\nbus and got on?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; he was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He was on the bus when the man asked for the transfer and got\r\noff?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you later called down to the--did the teenage boy ask\r\nfor any transfer?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, you were called down to the Dallas police department\r\nlater, weren't you?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What day was it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. It was on the same day, the 22d.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. 22d. Do you know how they happened to get in touch with you,\r\ndid you notify them that you----\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir; I didn't know anything to that effect.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did they come out and get you?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. They come out and----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did they ask you?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, they stopped me; it was, I would say around 6:15\r\nor somewhere around 6:15 or 6:20 that afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were still on duty, were you?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Still on your bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I was on duty but I was on a different line and a\r\ndifferent bus.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did they ask you when they came out?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, they stopped me right by the city hall there when\r\nI come by there and they wanted me to come in, they wanted to ask me\r\nsome questions. And I don't know what it was about or anything until I\r\ngot in there and they told me what happened.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did they tell you?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, they told me that they had a transfer that I had\r\nissued that was cut for Lamar Street at 1 o'clock, and they wanted to\r\nknow if I knew anything about it. And I, after I looked at the transfer\r\nand my punch, I said yes, that is the transfer I issued because it had\r\nmy punch mark on it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did your punch mark have a distinctive mark?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. It had a distinctive mark and it is registered, in other\r\nwords, all the drivers, every driver has a different punch mark.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What makes it different?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, it is, it would be, the symbol of it or angle, in\r\nother words, every one; it is different, in other words.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You have a punch there?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; I have the punch right here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that the punch that you used?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is the punch I used.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you punch a piece of paper and show us?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. In other words, that is the type of punch that this one\r\nmakes right here, in other words.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is a different type of punch than any other driver has?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Any driver, in other words.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On any bus in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. In other words, the superintendent has a list, in other\r\nwords, it would be just like this and every man has a punch and he has\r\nhis name, and everything. In other words, if anyone calls in about\r\na transfer or anything, I mean brings one in he can look right down\r\nthe list by the punch mark and tell whose punch it is, and who it is\r\nregistered to.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, the sample of your punch there has been on a piece of\r\npaper and we would like to have it marked as 372 at this time.\r\n\r\n(The paper referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 372 and\r\nreceived in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. If you punched, made a punch mark, on a transfer, did you\r\ndesignate the time of the punch or the place of the punch?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; I designate the time of the--we have one\r\ngeneral transfer point. In other words, Lamar Street is what we call\r\nour general transfer point in which all transfers are cut within the\r\nquarter of the hour in which you are supposed to be there.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if you was to arrive there at, say, 12:50 or in that\r\nvicinity, you always give the passenger the 15 minutes, in other words,\r\nwithin the hour of the transfer. In other words, is the way they have\r\nyou to cut your transfers across your cutter.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it is just a little thing that you raise up and down\r\nand you can adjust them, and right here is a book of them in which you\r\ncan see the time. It is one, in other words, 2:15, 3:30, and 4:45, and\r\nwe set them in other words, if you wanted at 1:15, 1 o'clock would be\r\nacross this direction. If you wanted it 1:15 you would cut across this\r\ndirection or if you wanted it 1:45 you would cut it in this direction.\r\nIn other words, 1:15, -:30 and -:45. In other words, the 15 minutes is\r\nalways given at the time, at the general transfer point.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It is 10:25 now. How would you cut it right now?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. At 10:25.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Why don't you cut one?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I have a regular cutter, you see; let's see if he can\r\nget something that would--in other words, 10:25, I will just cut it, in\r\nother words, cut across there, and cut it, in other words, at 10:30,\r\nin other words, it would show at 10:30.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Where do you put your own identification?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. On here. Well, if it is in the morning or in the\r\nafternoon, here is your a.m., or your p.m. In other words, it is before\r\n12:45, in other words, we consider up to 12:45 a.m., in other words,\r\nthat is the way they are.\r\n\r\nIn other words, I would punch it in the a.m. side of it, and if it\r\nwas in the afternoon, in other words, after that, it would be a p.m.\r\ntransfer, and whatever line that you are working has the name on it\r\nright here.\r\n\r\nIn other words, at that time that transfer I had punched was punched a\r\np.m. Lakewood, in other words, because I was coming from the Lakewood\r\naddition is the way that was punched on the transfer.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well now, do you punch the transfer when the passenger asks\r\nfor it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No. No, sir; in other words, when you leave this, you\r\nare inbound when you are going into town or when you are going, in\r\nother words, out of town, in other words.\r\n\r\nI was coming in, in other words, when I got in Lakewood Addition I set\r\nmy transfers for downtown.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. For downtown and you set them for what time?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I set them for 1 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You set them for 1 o'clock?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. 1 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you reached your end of the run in northeast Dallas then\r\nyou set your transfers for 1 o'clock, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right, when I was coming back in.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And when you gave this transfer near Poydras and Elm----\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you pull out a transfer that had already been set for 1\r\no'clock time?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir. In other words, I just reached up on my cutter\r\nand just tore off one which is already punched.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then did you punch it again or was it already punched?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. It was already punched.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you had punched it at the end of the line?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. So all you had to do is pull the transfer off of the pile of\r\ntransfers and hand it to the man?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you had anticipated at the end of the line that when\r\nyou got to about this point it would be a 1 o'clock transfer, is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, that is right.\r\n\r\nIn other words, there is enough time on it, just like I say, within a\r\nquarter of an hour, but----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you got to the police station that day did they show you\r\na transfer?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you tell them about the transfer?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I recognized the transfer as being the transfer\r\nthat I had issued.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How did you recognize it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. By my punch mark on it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And what about the line?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. The line?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Lakewood.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. The Lakewood punch on it, and where it was punched and\r\nLakewood with my punch mark on it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you able to identify it any further as a particular\r\ntransfer you had given to any particular passenger?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir. Only----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Go ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I only gave two transfers going through town on that\r\ntrip and that was at the one stop of where I gave the lady and the\r\ngentleman that got off the bus, I issued two transfers. But that was\r\nthe only two transfers that were issued.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you tell the police in Dallas that?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I don't remember whether I did or not.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But you do remember it now?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\n(At this point Chief Justice Warren left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right. Now, what else did you do that day?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, let's see----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did they show you any prisoner?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; when they stopped me over there and took me\r\ninto the police department there, like I say, it was around 6:15 or\r\n6:20, they took me down before the lineup there and asked me if I could\r\nidentify anyone in that lineup as getting on my bus that day.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did they take you down and show you a lineup?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You sat there with police officers and they brought men in\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. They brought four men out. In other words, four men\r\nunder the lights; in other words, they was all----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All the same age?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir; they were different ages, different sizes and\r\ndifferent heights. And they asked me if I could identify any man in\r\nparticular there, and I told them that I couldn't identify any man in\r\nparticular, but there was one man there that was about the size of the\r\nman. Now, I was referring back, after they done showed me this transfer\r\nat that time and I knew which trip, that I went through town on at that\r\ntime, in other words, on the Lakewood trip and just like I recalled,\r\nI only put out two transfers and I told them that there was one man\r\nin the lineup was about the size and the height and complexion of a\r\nman that got on my bus, but as far as positively identifying the man I\r\ncould not do it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was the size and the height and complexion of the man\r\nthat knocked on the window of this bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I would say, just like I told the police, to me he\r\nwas just a medium-sized man. To me he was, I would say, not, I wouldn't\r\ncall him--just of average weight, and I would say a light-complected,\r\nto the best of my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you say \"average weight\" what do you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I figured just like I saw, the man, he looked like to me\r\nthe best way I can describe him would be 135 or 140 pounds.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What about height?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, just like I told them, it looked like to me he\r\nwould probably be five-seven or five-eight, in that vicinity.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Anyway, you were not able to identify any man in the lineup\r\nas the passenger?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. As the passenger who had gotten on?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You said there was one man who closely resembled in height,\r\nweight and color?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know who that was?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Just like I told them, I didn't know who was who or\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever learn who that person was?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I don't know whether that was really the man or\r\nnot, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I see.\r\n\r\nNow, I have a map here.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. All right, proceed.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You remember you told us about the man that knocked on the\r\nwindow of the door of your bus just before you got to Griffin, wasn't\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; along about the vicinity of Griffin Street, it\r\ncomes to.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You let him on the bus, and he paid his fare, how much is\r\nthat fare?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. It is 23 cents.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. 23 cents, and you went about down almost to Poydras.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Almost, between Poydras and Lamar.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Between Poydras and Lamar, closer to Lamar than to Poydras?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And a man got on. Was it the same man?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That was the same man who got on the bus that I picked\r\nup, in other words.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And the man you gave the transfer to?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. The man I gave the transfer to when the woman--in other\r\nwords, when the man that got on Griffin Street there got off at the\r\nsame place she did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And he was only on the bus about 2 blocks?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Two blocks was the only distance.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long did it take you to go those 2 blocks?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Now, he paid as far as from St. Paul Street. I\r\nmade--there wasn't any traffic holding me up whatsoever, I come on\r\nright down to where I picked the man up there, in other words, about\r\nField, and that is where the traffic was starting to back up to. So\r\nthe best of my knowledge I would say it took me 3 or 4 minutes to get\r\ndown there, so I will just have to say it was in the vicinity of around\r\n12:40.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, how long was the man on your bus, the man\r\nwho got on, about Griffin and got off and you gave him the transfer,\r\napproximately?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, he got on, and when he got on, I made that one\r\nblock, and then the other, well, I would be safe in saying he wasn't on\r\nthere 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you think he got off or on around 12:40?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. 12:40 that is the best.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time did you say he got on approximately?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. On the bus?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I would say in the vicinity from where I left\r\nup there it would be probably it took me, I would say, 3 minutes to\r\ncome, let's see, it would be Ervay, Akard and Field, that is about 3\r\nblocks there where I left my time point which I would say just a rough\r\nestimation it would be with no traffic would be 2 or 3 minutes, I would\r\nsay 3 minutes anyway.\r\n\r\nSo, it must have been somewheres 12:39 or--so.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When he got on the bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. 12:40.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And then he was on the bus about how many minutes?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, just like I say he wasn't on the bus over 4 or 5\r\nminutes, in other words, just made that 1 block there, and in other\r\nwords, when the traffic stopped, well, that is when he got off the bus.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. During the time he was on the bus this man rapped\r\nat your door or was your door open, and spoke up and said that the\r\nPresident had been shot?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. He was on the bus, you mean was the door open?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. No. You previously testified that while you were\r\nstalled or jammed up in the traffic----\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. A man came to the door of the bus and indicated by\r\nword of mouth----\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That the President had been shot.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Now, was the man to whom you issued the transfer\r\non the bus at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Now, the man who spoke up and said that the\r\nPresident had been shot, how loudly did he say that?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, he said it loud enough that I guess everybody on\r\nthe bus heard him when he stepped up in the bus.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, that would be your best impression\r\nor best recollection that whoever said this, that the President had\r\nbeen shot, said it loudly enough for not only you but the other bus\r\npassengers to hear it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir. Because he stepped up in the bus and when he\r\nmade the statement in other words, he said that the President had been\r\nshot, because I am pretty sure everybody--he said it to the fact. I\r\nthink that everybody, there might have been some, if there was anybody\r\nin the extreme back of the bus, might not have heard it, but I think\r\nanyone who was near the front part of the bus could have.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But at that time when this man made this\r\nstatement, there was a teenager sitting in the first cross seat on the\r\nright-hand side of the bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And the man who had gotten on the bus to whom you\r\nlater issued the transfer, was sitting in the second?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. In the second seat.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What is the distance from the door of the bus\r\nwhere the man was standing who made this statement to the second cross\r\nseat?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I would say, let's see, it would be I would say 6\r\nor 8 feet.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was he sitting alone in the second cross seat?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. He was sitting alone.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you notice any reaction on the part of any of\r\nyour passengers to this comment by this man who made this statement?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, the only reaction that I knew is when he got up\r\nand said that, well, that is when the lady got off first, which she\r\njumped up and got her suitcase and said, in other words, made a remark\r\nto something. \"I am afraid you are going to be tied up here in this\r\ntraffic and I want to get off.\"\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Where was this lady sitting who got up and asked\r\nfor this transfer?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Now, this lady was sitting behind me, in other words, I\r\nam the driver.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. On the left-hand side of the bus looking forward?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; in other words, it is a cross seat. I mean a\r\nside seat, in other words, like the driver sitting here, the first seat\r\nis the one that runs parallel with the bus, in other words.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Well now, the seat in which the lady was sitting\r\nwould be parallel to the second cross seat on the other side of the bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, in other words----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It would be on the same line?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The first seat would be ahead--the first seat on\r\nthe right-hand side of the bus would be ahead of the seat where the\r\nlady was sitting?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, you mean the lady, I am referring to who got off\r\nfirst?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, the lady--I was sitting in the driver's seat, she\r\nwas sitting right behind me, in other words, facing out his way.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But she obviously heard what the man said about\r\nthe President being shot?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There is no doubt in your mind she heard that?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I wouldn't think so because when she got up and stated\r\nshe wanted to get off----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was she any further from the man who made this\r\nstatement about the President being shot than the man who was sitting\r\nin the second cross seat?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. She was closer to the man actually than the man that got\r\noff with her was.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How many feet or how much difference?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, the lady in other words, from the door here, it\r\nis just two cross seats, and two seats where you sit sideways and then\r\nthe two seats in which he would be back here.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Could you diagram that as best as you can?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Congressman, we have a diagram. We have a picture of the\r\nside of the bus.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Right here.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Sit down.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. You can see it from this point right here, in other\r\nwords. You see this cross seat, in other words, these first two right\r\nhere, the driver's seat, you see the first two seats there, in other\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Could you sit down and mark it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. This is the inside, let's see, this is the driver right\r\nhere. Here is your cross seat right here. Here, about back here, is\r\nwhere the lady got off who was sitting on this seat.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Will you mark that with an \"L\"?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. In other words, right here.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Where was the man in the first cross seat sitting?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Right here is the first. Right here is where the man\r\nthat was sitting, got off, in this seat right here, I believe it is.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Will you mark that \"M\" where the man who was\r\nsitting also got off who got the transfer?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Maybe we had better use a black pen that will show better on\r\nthat glazed surface.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This is where the man was sitting who you issued\r\nthe transfer to at the same time the lady was issued the transfer?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And the teenager was sitting in what seat?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Right here.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Will you mark that \"O\"?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Where was the man standing who came to the bus and\r\nsaid the President had been shot?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Right here.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. On the step?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. On the step. I guess, I presume this would be the second\r\nstep there. To the best of my recollection he stepped up on the first\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mark that \"P.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. \"P.\"\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Now, after the man who was standing at \"P\" said\r\nthe President was shot, what did the lady do who was sitting in \"L\"?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, the lady, she had a suitcase sitting right there\r\nbeside me and she left. When the lady got up and said she would like to\r\nget off the bus, and that she was going to walk to the Union Station\r\nand asked me if I would give her a transfer in case that I caught up\r\nwith her, and asked me if I would pick her up.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You gave her a transfer?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What happened?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. She got off and by the time when she was talking to me\r\nthat is when he got up, this gentleman here in the seat got up, at seat\r\n\"M\" got off. In other words, the door was never closed of the bus from\r\nthe time the gentleman stepped up in the door of that there, in other\r\nwords, when he said what he did, and got on back in his car, in other\r\nwords, the lady got off, and the man got off, too, both at the same\r\nstop.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the bus hadn't moved at that stop.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I would like to mark this as the next exhibit, Commission's\r\nexhibit, which will be the diagram of the bus with the initials \"M,\"\r\n\"O,\" \"L,\" \"P,\" will be marked as Commission's Exhibit 373.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It will be so admitted.\r\n\r\n(The diagram referred to was marked Commission's Exhibit No. 373 for\r\nidentification and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And a photograph of the interior of the bus, I would like to\r\nhave marked as 374.\r\n\r\nAnd a diagram of the bus itself showing front and side as 375.\r\n\r\n(The photograph and diagram referred to were marked Commission Exhibits\r\nNos. 374 and 375, respectively, and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I will hand you a photograph of the exterior of the bus.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; in other words, that is the same bus number.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is the bus it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is the bus. Number----\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. 433.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So admitted.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. These are all admitted.\r\n\r\nNow, we have this map which is Commission's Exhibit 371. Can you show\r\nme your starting point which is where you started your time on Elm and\r\nwhat street?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is Elm and St. Paul.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you mark an \"X\" there with your black pen, or let's take\r\nred pen this time for you, on this same map, here it is right there,\r\nthat is where you commenced your time, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Put an \"O\" there.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Put an \"O\" here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Just circle that intersection.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. O.K.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, you went along Elm, westerly along Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Put a \"P\" about the place where the man knocked on the window\r\nof your door of your bus and got on. Here is Griffin.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. This is Griffin right here, mark that with a \"P\".\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And put an \"R\" at the place where the man got off the bus.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Let's see.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Here is Lamar.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Here is Lamar here. I want to find Poydras.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is right in here.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That would be, in other words, about the center here\r\nwould be, in other words, a little bit closer to Lamar than----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Put an \"R\" there to indicate the approximate position where\r\nhe got off.\r\n\r\n\"O\" is where you started, so you had better raise those up to Elm. The\r\nplace he got on and the place he got off.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, if you would just draw a line up and put your \"R\" it would be\r\neasier.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. On Griffin here now that is where you want----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where he got on, wherever it was.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Is that where you want the \"P\"?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is where he got on?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes. O.K. right here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And where he got off \"R\".\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is a very short block right in between Poydras and\r\nLamar here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right.\r\n\r\nNow, let's use the map here. You made your start at St. Paul and Elm\r\ndidn't you, and went west.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, you picked up a man who knocked on the window of your\r\nbus at a place in the street that was not a bus stop, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And its approximate location was where?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. At Griffin Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you have marked that as \"P\"?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Marked that as \"P\".\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That same man stayed on your bus until you got to what\r\nlocation\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, the location was between Poydras and Lamar Street.\r\n\r\nIn other words, I would say closer to Lamar than to Poydras.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At that point he got off the bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. He got off the bus.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you gave him a transfer?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you have marked that \"R\", is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There is another map I would like to show you that hasn't\r\nbeen marked yet as a Commission Exhibit, and I will have that marked as\r\n376, a map of Dallas.\r\n\r\nYou have already marked on this map, haven't you, or it has been marked\r\nin advance then by someone.\r\n\r\n(The map referred to was marked Commission's Exhibit No. 376 and\r\nreceived in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, take a look at this map and tell me if that map, the\r\nblue line on the map, indicates your route on that day, where you\r\nstarted in northeast Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, that is the original starting line there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is the street?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I believe--I can't even see that small print on that.\r\nThat is Ellsworth and Anita, that is where it is coming back there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Ellsworth and Anita, and then you proceeded downtown along\r\nthat course, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir. This is Lakewood shopping center.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you have an alternative route through there?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, in other words, that is where the main thoroughfare\r\nstarts right there at Gaston Avenue. Gaston right here which is the\r\nmain street when you leave this shopping center.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You went down Gaston to Pacific?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Went down Gaston to, let's see this is Hawkins Street\r\nright here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you went left on Hawkins to Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. To Elm Street, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you went on Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Went from Elm to, this would be Houston Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Turned on Houston Street viaduct?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Left on Houston Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. To Marsalis?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. In other words, this is the Houston Street viaduct and\r\nthis is Marsalis where you turn and come off Houston Street viaduct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you go south how far?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Go south all the way to, let's see, it is Ann Arbor.\r\nThis is all Marsalis right here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. A straight run south?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Straight run.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you make a turn and go back?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I make a turn, in other words, on Ann Arbor and in other\r\nwords, just circle, make a loop, just circle right around this little\r\nshopping center here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And go back.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. And right back down Marsalis.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Marsalis is how far from Beckley?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Marsalis is, let's see----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This is Beckley here?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You can count the streets there, can you?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. In other words, it would be seven blocks.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Seven blocks, Beckley is seven blocks west of Marsalis, is\r\nthat correct?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Your bus line doesn't run down Beckley?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It doesn't run seven blocks, close to Beckley? Have you seen\r\nthis? Here is Beckley and here is Marsalis, the bus line.\r\n\r\nIs there a bus route on Beckley?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; there is.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you get a bus that goes down Beckley some place around\r\nHouston and Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; the bus comes, the Beckley bus comes in on\r\nSt. Paul and Elm, in other words, at the time that I was, before we\r\nstarted, in other words, that is where the Beckley bus enters Elm\r\nStreet there and then he goes the same route through town.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Same route you go down to the Houston viaduct?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes. In other words, after the Book Depository down\r\nthere, he goes straight on.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let me ask you this: The Beckley bus, the bus that will take\r\nyou south on Beckley, has a starting point the same place as yours at\r\nSt. Paul and Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. St. Paul, in other words, the time element is the same.\r\nIn other words, he comes in there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then that Beckley bus goes west on Elm the same as your bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But instead of turning south on the Houston Street viaduct\r\nthe Beckley bus goes straight west on Elm, doesn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you show us the bus stop for the Beckley bus on this\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 361?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, yes; his last bus stop would be right here at the\r\ncorner of----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let's put a mark on this. Here is a red pencil, and put a\r\nmark on this in red and show us the place where the Beckley bus would\r\nstop.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. It would stop--in other words, we consider this corner\r\nof this intersection right here, any letter or what.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Just put a rectangular mark about the size of a bus\r\nindicating bus stop--take black ink and indicating a place where the\r\nbus would stop.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. In other words, the bus would stop along in this place\r\nright here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right, now that is bus stop for Beckley bus.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is bus stop for Beckley bus.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Northeast corner Houston and Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Northeast corner of Houston and Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The Beckley bus goes on across directly in front of the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. As your bus gets into another lane of traffic and does not\r\nstop at Houston and Elm and makes a turn south on Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then the Beckley bus stop, the stop of the Beckley bus, which\r\nis in black ink on the northeast corner of Houston and Elm, we will\r\nmark that with a big \"B\" which stands for Beckley bus.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How long have you been on this run that you had\r\nthe day of November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I worked this run for, I would say, this is the second\r\nyear. This makes 2 years that I worked this.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Two years consecutively?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. 2 years consecutively that I have been on this run and\r\nworked it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So you would be familiar with the route?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; just like I say, I worked it, this is the\r\nsecond year that I have worked the same, in other words, the same\r\nhours, and the same route.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How many hours a day do you work this route?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, now, this one particular route right here, I work\r\nit only 2 hours and 35 minutes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Each day?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Each day.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How many days a week?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. 5 days, Monday through Friday. And after that, in other\r\nwords, I work on another, a different bus line.\r\n\r\nBut this one particular one here is just 2 hours and 35 minutes each\r\nday.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you say a different bus line, you mean the\r\nsame company but a different route?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. A different route.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You would be familiar with the time schedules and\r\nall of the stops on this particular route from your 2 years' experience?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask a question?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Have you testified that you saw this passenger whom\r\nyou later recognized in the lineup, get on the bus in the vicinity of\r\nMurphy Street--is Murphy Street on your right?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Murphy Street is the street that, in other words, that\r\ncomes in.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Does it run into Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. It runs into Elm Street, it dead ends, in other words,\r\ninto Elm Street.\r\n\r\nHere is Field Street, in other words, across this intersection and we\r\nstopped across the intersection of Field, and Murphy Street comes in to\r\nthe intersection at about where the bus stops, in other words, where\r\nField Street stops and I guess that Griffin is the next small street\r\nthat comes in just, it is just a short distance below.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Well, did the passenger that you have testified about,\r\nand whom you stated that you later identified, did he get on in the\r\nvicinity of Murphy Street?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Murphy Street--you proceeded from Murphy Street toward\r\nthe Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is correct.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was the passenger that got on near Murphy Street the\r\nsame passenger that you later have testified about who told you that\r\nthe President had been shot in the temple?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, they told me later that it was, but at the time\r\nthey didn't tell me.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Who didn't tell you?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. The police didn't.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. When you say this passenger got on near Murphy Street,\r\nwas there anything about him that caused you to take notice of him\r\nparticularly?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, no, sir. I wouldn't say there was. He was, I would\r\nsay, he didn't have on no suit or anything, he had on, I believe, some\r\ntype of jacket, cloth jacket.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What caused you to remember him getting on?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. What caused me to remember?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes; at the time he got on.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Because, the reason I remembered exactly because I\r\ndidn't put out but two transfers, and that, in other words, from where\r\nhe got on and everything, I didn't have but one, there wasn't but one\r\nman on the bus and that was the teenage boy, when he got on the bus, in\r\nother words, when he got off, he was the only man except the teenage\r\nboy who was on the bus at the time.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Now was this man that you saw got on the bus the same\r\none who told you that the President had been shot in the temple?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. The man who got on the bus now?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes. The man to whom you have just referred as getting\r\non the bus near Murphy Street.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Is he the same man who told you that the President had\r\nbeen shot in the temple?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Who told you that?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. A man in an automobile in front of me, in other words,\r\nthat was sitting in a car come back and told me.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Told you what?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That the President had been shot, that he had heard over\r\nhis radio in his car that the President had been shot.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I think you have testified that someone, some passenger\r\non the bus, in response to a question that you had asked, \"I wonder\r\nwhere they shot the President\" said, \"They shot him in the temple.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Oh, that was now, that was after we had done, that is\r\nwhen I turned on Houston Street, the conversation with the teenage boy.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. It was the teenage boy who told you that?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; it was the teenage boy, sitting on his right\r\nside of the side seat there, the one that I conversationed with about\r\nthe President being shot in the head or the temple, I don't remember,\r\nbut the teenage boy was the one.\r\n\r\nThat was after the man that already got off that had boarded my bus up\r\naround Griffin there.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Then the one who told you the President had been shot\r\nin the temple was not the one you later identified in the police lineup?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. This probably has been testified to, but where did the\r\nman that you later identified in the police lineup get off the bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Got off between Poydras and Lamar Street.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was that after you crossed over the viaduct or before?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir; that was before I crossed over.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. When did the teenage boy get off the bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. He got off at Oak Cliff, I believe. He got off at\r\nMarsalis and Brownley.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was that after the bus had crossed the viaduct?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is after the bus had----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Past the Texas Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; that is about 3 or 4 miles out in the Oak\r\nCliff section where the teenage boy got off of the bus.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. From the time the man got on the bus, which you later\r\nidentified in the police lineup until he got off, had you noticed him,\r\nhad you looked at him again?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Had I looked at him again?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Not until just like I say he was sitting--I was talking\r\nto this teenage boy and he was sitting right behind this boy, but I\r\ndidn't pay him any particular attention, to the man.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You saw him get on the bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you see him get off?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes; I gave him a transfer when he got off the bus,\r\nthe same place that was, the same place I was stopped where the man\r\ncome back and stepped up in the bus and told me what he had heard over\r\nhis radio in his car, the same place that the lady got off, with a\r\nsuitcase, is the place that the man got off.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. The man you later identified in the police lineup?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is correct; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you pay any particular attention to him when he got\r\noff?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Not no more than I did than, I think, when he got on.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Do you remember anything about his clothes or his\r\ngeneral appearance in any way?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Just like I say, I remember he had on, to me he had on\r\njust work clothes, he didn't have on a suit of clothes, and some type\r\nof jacket. I would say a cloth jacket.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I believe that is all.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You didn't--as I understand it, when you were at the police\r\nlineup, you told us that you didn't--weren't able to identify this man\r\nin the lineup as the man who got off, that you gave the transfer to.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I told them to the best of my knowledge, I said the man\r\nthat I picked out was the same height, about the same height, weight\r\nand description. But as far as actually saying that is the man I\r\ncouldn't----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You couldn't do it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I wouldn't do it and I wouldn't do it now.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You signed an affidavit for the Dallas Police Department, do\r\nyou remember that?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I will show you a copy of it, we can get the original if you\r\nwant, but there is a copy of it, a picture taken of it.\r\n\r\nWill you read it, please?\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford withdrew from the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This document, I would like to have marked as 377, at this\r\ntime, Commission Exhibit, with the understanding that we may substitute\r\nthe photostat for the original.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Very well; let it be substituted. It has been\r\nidentified, and will be identified.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes, it will be; I will identify it for the record as a\r\nphotostat of an affidavit of Cecil J. McWatters made before Patsy\r\nCollins, Notary Public of Dallas County, Tex., November 22, 1963.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit 377, and\r\nreceived in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, having read that, first of all, does that look like your\r\nsignature, Mr. McWatters?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; it does.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember the circumstances under which you made that\r\naffidavit?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I just told them the best I could remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I am showing this to you for the purpose of refreshing your\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, I know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I know it has been several months.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, I know what you mean.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And sometimes when you see something that you signed before\r\nit refreshes your memory.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. It sure does.\r\n\r\nYes, that is what you mean, I know what you mean, I said that looked\r\nlike the man I saw.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In this affidavit, it says, it mentions the fact that when\r\nyou went to Marsalis and picked up a woman.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You asked her if she knew the President had been shot, you\r\ntold us about that a few moments ago.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. She thought you were kidding, and you told her, \"I told her\r\nif she didn't believe me to ask the man behind her, that he had told me\r\nthe President was shot in the temple.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was the man, was that the teenager?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right, sir, that was the teenage boy. In other\r\nwords, he was, I would say, around 17 or 18 years old.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You said here, \"The man didn't say anything but he was\r\ngrinning.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you think that happened?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, when the lady asked him, he just kind of grinned,\r\nin other words, and she said, \"This is not a grinning or laughing\r\nmatter,\" or something to that effect I don't remember just exactly what\r\nshe did say.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now you told them at that time you didn't know where you let\r\nthis man off.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right, I didn't at that time, I didn't know\r\nwhere he got off.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You told us a few moments ago you thought he got off another\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was that place?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. He got off at Brownley, because the man rode with me the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You went out there the next day, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. With an FBI man or a Dallas policeman?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, I mean----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The same teenager?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. The same teenager rode with me the next day.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you noticed he got off there?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, and I noticed, and I asked him, like I told him, I\r\nsaid that I was--I thought that, you know, that he was, when he first\r\ngot on down there, I says, \"From all indications, we had you kind of\r\npinpointed as the man who might have been mixed up in the assassination\r\nand everything.\" And----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do I understand the day after you made the affidavit, this\r\nwould be the 23d of November?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That this same teenager got on your bus again?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, he got on.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you noticed where you let him off?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I noticed where I let him off, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that the reason that today you remember he got off?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is it today I remember, just like I say, I remember\r\nI talked to him the next day, and he told me where he got on, and he\r\ntold me where he got on, and where he got off and where he lived, and,\r\nyou know that----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Has he been on your bus since?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He has?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. He has rode with me since.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes. I see.\r\n\r\nDid you give him a transfer that day?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, because he gets on and he lives within about two\r\nblocks of the busline, in other words, where he gets off.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know this boy's name?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I believe his name is Milton Jones.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Milton Jones?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Milton Jones. I don't believe I know where he lives, but\r\nI pass where he lives. But he told me his name was Milton Jones and he\r\ntold me he was 17.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he ever tell you where he works?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. He told me that, I believe, he goes to school half a\r\nday, believe he said and I believe he goes home and he has a part-time\r\njob, but he never did state where he works.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he tell you where he went to school?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir; he never did tell me where he went to school.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Or where he worked?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Where he worked, either one.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You notice in the affidavit there it says, \"This\r\nman\"--referring to the man who was grinning----\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. \"This man looks like the No. 1 man I saw in the lineup\r\ntoday.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who was the No. 2 man you saw in the lineup on November 22,\r\n1963?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, just like I say, he was the shortest man in the\r\nlineup, in other words, when they brought these men out there, in other\r\nwords, he was about the shortest, and the lightest weight one, I guess,\r\nwas the reason I say that he looked like the man, because the rest of\r\nthem were larger men than----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, now, at that time, when you saw the lineup----\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you under the impression that this man that you saw in\r\nthe lineup and whom you pointed out to the police, was the teenage boy\r\nwho had been grinning?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I was, yes, sir; I was under the impression----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was the fellow?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That was the fellow.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were not under the impression then that night when you\r\nsaw the lineup that the No. 2 man in the lineup was the man who got off\r\nthe bus, to whom you had given a transfer?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is what I say. In other words, when I told them,\r\nI said, the only way is the man, that he is smaller, in other words,\r\nhe kind of had a thin like face and he weighs less than any one of\r\nthem. The only one I could identify at all would be the smaller man on\r\naccount he was the only one who could come near fitting the description.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let me ask you this, though. Did you tell them the man, the\r\nsmaller man, you saw in the lineup, did you tell them that you thought\r\nhe was the man who got off your bus and got the transfer or the man who\r\nwas on the bus who was the teenager who was grinning?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I really thought he was the man who was on the bus.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That stayed on the bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That stayed on the bus.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you didn't think he was the man who got off the bus and\r\nto whom you gave a transfer?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At that time you didn't?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is why I say I pinpointed that transfer on that boy\r\nas far as that is concerned. But at first, just like I say, I really\r\nthought from the height and weight of the two men, I mean was just\r\nlike I say, was both of them were small. In the lineup they had, in\r\nother words, bigger men, in other words, he was the smallest man at the\r\nlineup.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. We have got--we have this diagram that you have already drawn\r\nof the bus which has several initials on it. Could you tell me where on\r\nthe bus this lady sat who told the teenager it was no grinning matter?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, now, that is, in other words, I don't think at\r\nthat time--now this teenager was still on the bus near, but I had a\r\ncouple of more passengers on there, I believe I had two women on there,\r\nbut I can't recall just, when I picked her up where she sat down on the\r\nbus.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember you said to the woman, \"Look at that man\r\nbehind you?\"\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, she was standing up here at the fare, paying fare.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And the teenager was where?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. He was sitting right here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At the place \"O\", is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, at the place \"O\".\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is where the conversation was going on.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mr. McWatters, that affidavit you have there, will you look\r\nat another item you have there?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. \"Today, November 22, 1963, about 12:40 p.m., I was driving\r\nMarsalis Bus No. 1213.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. First of all, you have referred to that as another bus,\r\nMunger Bus, is that the same bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; in other words, that number there is my run\r\nnumber right here on my card.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I understand that, but do you call that run the Marsalis run\r\nas well as the Munger run?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir. Well, here you can--let me show you here on\r\nthis schedule right here, Marsalis, Ramona, Elwood and Munger.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can we take this and have a Xerox----\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. You can just take the whole thing.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right. We will have a Xerox of this and mark it 378, a\r\nXerox copy.\r\n\r\nWill you identify that document and tell me what it is?\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit 378, for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. This is a schedule, I will just say a bus schedule.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is for the Marsalis-Ramona-Elwood-Munger run?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Run 1213. Is this the run schedule that was in effect on\r\nNovember 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; that is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It shows here at St. Paul you were to leave at 12:36; is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. We will make a photostat of that and we will give you back\r\nthe original.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. You can keep that if you want to. They made another copy\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right, then, we will keep this as an original.\r\n\r\nCan this be introduced into evidence, Senator?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes, let it be made a part of the evidence.\r\n\r\n(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 378, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have a few more questions to ask you, a few more questions,\r\nMr. McWatters.\r\n\r\nLet's look again at this affidavit.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. \"I picked up a man on the lower end of town on Elm around\r\nHouston,\" as I remember you didn't stop at Elm and Houston; you stopped\r\nat Record and Houston for a pickup.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember having picked up any man around the lower end\r\nof town at Elm around Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Elm and Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, no, sir; I didn't pick up. I made a statement here I\r\npicked up----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Take a look at it, \"I picked up a man on the lower end of\r\ntown on Elm around Houston.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, I didn't. I picked--\"I picked a man up at the lower\r\nend of town at Elm,\" no, sir, I didn't pick up no man.\r\n\r\nNo, I was tied up in traffic there. Market Street is the--I must not\r\nhave read that very good when I signed that, because I sure didn't. No,\r\nI didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you pick up a man at Record and Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You didn't?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir; that is not even no stop.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, this statement is not an accurate statement?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right, sir, because in fact that day the police\r\nwouldn't let nobody, in other words they run them buses through but\r\nthey wouldn't let nothing stop there, in other words.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let's get back to that lineup.\r\n\r\nDid you pick out one man or two men that night as people you had seen,\r\nas a person you had seen before?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I picked out, the only one that I told them it was\r\nthe short man that I picked out up there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you thought he was the teenager whom you described?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, first that is what I thought he was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now you have named him Milton Jones.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, he was----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now you realize you were mistaken in your identification that\r\nnight?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. As I understand it, neither then nor now are you able to\r\nidentify or say that you have again seen the man that got off your bus\r\nto whom you gave a transfer?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir; I couldn't. I could not identify him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This Beckley bus that we talked about, remember the one that\r\nhas the starting point at St. Paul and Elm----\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The same as your bus, the Marsalis bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is the difference in the time run, what time does the\r\nBeckley bus leave--let me withdraw the question.\r\n\r\nYour bus leaves St. Paul and Elm at 12:36, scheduled to leave there as\r\nof November 22d?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Using the same schedule, can you tell me at what time around\r\n12:30 or so that the Beckley bus would leave Elm and St. Paul and\r\nproceed westerly on Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. He is scheduled in there the same time as I am, 12:36.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. 12:36. Was that bus in the line?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No. In other words, that bus was behind me, in other\r\nwords, because when I got there as a general rule, when we pull up\r\nthere every day, in other words, I am coming in one direction and he\r\nis another, in other words, most every day, we will pull up at this\r\nintersection at the same time.\r\n\r\nNow, whichever way the light changes is who gets, in other words, who\r\ngets in front of who. But at that day, I am sure that I was ahead of\r\nthe Beckley bus.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You are sure you were ahead of it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Because there wasn't another bus in front of me. I was\r\nthe first bus down there that was tied up in there in the traffic.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see the Beckley bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You don't remember whether he was behind you or not?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I don't remember whether he was behind me or not.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you transfer from your bus to the Beckley bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; sure can.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Any particular transfer point?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, there are particular transfer points, but we don't\r\nquestion anybody within the downtown section with a transfer.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. If you gave a transfer to your bus, then that transfer would\r\nbe good on a Beckley bus any place along Elm, wouldn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right, it sure would.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Up to the place where you change courses?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. It would be accepted; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Your course is westerly on Elm, is identical with that of the\r\nBeckley bus between St. Paul and Houston, isn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And from that point you go south on Houston, and the Beckley\r\nbus continues west on Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. So that would be a normal transfer point, wouldn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Houston and Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That would be a transfer. In other words, now, like I\r\nsay, Lamar is the general transfer point of where all the buses cross.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, that night of the lineup, when you identified this one\r\nshort man----\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. As being probably the teenager that had been on the bus----\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there anything unusual in the conduct of anyone in the\r\nlineup?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did any man in the lineup talk more than anyone else?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, I believe they had a guy that asked them their\r\naddress, and they said, \"address\" and I don't know, he asked them, I\r\nbelieve he asked some of them where they lived or some or them where\r\nthey worked, or I don't remember just what, in other words, he asked\r\nsome enough, every one of them to say some few words.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You could hear them talk?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; you could hear them talk.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was any one man boisterous, mean, loud, anything of that sort?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, not that I could tell any difference. They all\r\ntalked to me as, in other words, you just asked them their name and\r\naddress. If they did, I didn't pay any attention to it.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This is Exhibit No. 376 that I will show you again. You have\r\nindicated on the map the course of your bus south on Marsalis. Is there\r\nany other bus route that goes south on any street east of Marsalis?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. You mean that crosses it this way?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. No, goes south.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, let's see.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is there a main highway called Denley? Is there a bus route\r\non Ewing?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir. Bus route on Ewing.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That goes south on Ewing?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Does that bus come anywhere near, does that bus run down Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where does it turn to get to Ewing?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. In other words, it turns, it goes just like the Marsalis\r\nbus here goes, until he gets----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let's start up at Elm here, Elm and Houston now. Does the bus\r\nthat goes down Ewing come west on Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Does it go by St. Paul and Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Have a starting point there?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; it is a final point for it right there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And it goes west on Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where does it turn off Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. It turns the same place as I do, in other words.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. South on Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. South on Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And then does it go across the Houston Street viaduct?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then it turns on, how does it get onto Ewing?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. It comes on out to Marsalis to, let's see, I have to\r\nfind the zoo. That is where it turns right there at the Marsalis\r\nPark, and turns and goes over to Ewing, let's see, what is the name\r\nof that--this bus turns to the left off Marsalis there, it is a\r\npark--there is a big expressway there and it is the first street when\r\nit crosses over the expressway where it turns off of Marsalis on\r\nOpera. The name of the bus is Ramona, it is the same, in other words,\r\nit is the same line as this other one.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. As I understand it now the bus that goes down Ewing comes off\r\nthe Houston Street viaduct as far as, comes down the Houston Street\r\nviaduct as far as Marsalis, does it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; and it goes south on Marsalis.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It goes south on Marsalis?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And it turns over to Ewing, that would be east on Ewing?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes; that would be east.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At or about what point?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, in other words, that is the Marsalis Zoo is where\r\nit is, after you cross the expressway there, it is the first street,\r\nOpera is the name of that and it goes right down to Ewing.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then at the corner of 11th, at the intersection of 11th and\r\nMarsalis both buses travel the same route?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; they sure do. Both buses travel the same route\r\nto Marsalis and the Ramona bus on that part travel the same route.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Probably on the same route.\r\n\r\nNow, I show you this document which is the bus schedule of\r\nMarsalis-Ramona-Elwood-Munger, and it shows you leave St. Paul at 12:36\r\nand you arrive at Lamar 12:40.\r\n\r\nThe bus transfers are punched you told me for 1 o'clock. We have a\r\ntransfer here that you have seen or we will show you in a few minutes\r\nas soon as it gets here, which has a punch mark of 1 o'clock. You told\r\nSenator Cooper that you usually punched within 15 minutes of the time\r\nyou reached the transfer points?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. If that is the case, what----\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. You mean why did I have it punched at 1 o'clock?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Because I punch it p.m. In other words, I have a punch,\r\nI am going to Lakewood, I mean I am going Marsalis and I am going back\r\nLakewood, so I just take me two books of transfers. Instead of punching\r\none of them a.m. and one p.m. I just punched them p.m.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you punch within 15 minutes of the time you reach the\r\ntransfer points?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is the way that the transfers are supposed to be\r\ncut.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, if you reach Lamar, if you were to reach Lamar at\r\n12:40, what time, according to the rules should you punch it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I should have punched it at 12:45.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At 12:45?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. But I would have to punch one book a.m. and another one\r\np.m., so I just punched both of them p.m.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, what you do is punch on the hour rather than\r\nthe 45 and 15 minutes usually?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, your usual practice is not to punch on the\r\n15-minute interval, is that right, but to punch on the hour?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, just like I say within the closest of the hour\r\nlike that, in other words.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Suppose today you were wanting to punch some transfers at the\r\nend of the line and you knew you were going to get to Lamar at 12:40.\r\nWould you punch--what would you punch it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I work that run all the time, I punch at 1 o'clock every\r\nday. As I say I worked it 2 years and as I say in order to keep from\r\npunching one of them a.m. and one p.m., for the difference in the hour\r\nthere, I just punch them p.m.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I don't quite understand that. Doesn't your p.m. start at\r\nafter 12 o'clock?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, the way the transfers are there, did you notice\r\nhow they was, they run them until--see how 12:45 there, in other\r\nwords, that is what they use that up to a.m. in other words.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It is 12:45 a.m., it runs up to a.m.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is what they run it to a.m. In other words, after\r\n12:45 or in there, in other words, everything is punched p.m.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, everything in the hour from 12 on is punched\r\na.m., the day time, 12 to one is a.m., 12 to 12:45, for that hour, a\r\ntransfer good in that hour is punched a.m., is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, it can be punched a.m. up to, just like 12:45.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And the next punch is 1 o'clock and that is p.m.?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is p.m.; yes, sir. That is the way they have them.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The day that you punched this particular transfer,\r\nNovember 22?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You punched them the same that day as you did\r\nevery other day?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right. Every day, in other words, I just punch\r\nthem p.m. I punch them p.m., and in other words, so it will be just a\r\nstraight cut across it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is that the usual practice for all bus drivers to\r\nuse this practice?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. The practice they are supposed to cut them within the\r\nquarter of the hour, but in other words, I just have been working that\r\nrun and I just, it is p.m., and I just make one trip one way and one\r\nback the other, and so I--all I carry are two books of transfers and so\r\nI just punch two books p.m., using one going one way at 1 o'clock and\r\nthe other coming back at 2.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This is the practice you have used for 2 years\r\napproximately?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right, when I worked that run, in other words,\r\nwhen I am going one way at 1 o'clock, coming back from the other end of\r\nthe line I set them at 2. I am back in there at, my next trip I am back\r\nin there at Lamar Street, I think it is 1:38 but I always just set them\r\nat 2 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. We have a couple of more pictures here. 378 and 379 which\r\nare pictures of the interior of the bus--Nos. 379 and 380. (Picture\r\nmarked for identification as Commission Exhibit No. 374 is the same as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 379.)\r\n\r\nI will first show you 379. Is that a picture of the bus from front to\r\nrear of your bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; that is the front and that is the rear.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Here is 380, is that a picture of the bus taken from the\r\nfront taken looking towards the rear?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I offer these in evidence, too.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So admitted.\r\n\r\n(The pictures referred to were marked Commission's Exhibits Nos. 379\r\nand 380 and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have here an exhibit which I would like to have marked as\r\n381 which can be identified as a transfer issued by Dallas Transit\r\nCompany, Friday, November 22, 1963.\r\n\r\nDo you identify it, can you tell me, if you have ever seen that\r\ntransfer before?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, that is my punch mark right on that there; p.m.\r\n\r\n(The transfer was marked Commission Exhibit No. 381 for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You issued it, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Tell me when you issued it, on what run?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I issued it on Marsalis and Munger line at I would\r\nsay, around to the best of my knowledge it would be around 12:40 or\r\nsomewheres in that vicinity on November 22.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And it has your punch mark, has it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; that is my punch mark.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Identify it punched in the p.m. section?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Of the Lakewood column here on the transfer.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When did you punch it exactly? Where were you when you\r\npunched it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I punched it before I left the end of the line, in other\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This is number 004459, is the transfer number. Entitled \"The\r\nShoppers Transfer.\" Every transfer has a separate number, has it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; everyone has a separate number.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What we would like to do is mark a photostat of the transfer\r\nas 381A and substitute the photostat and we can return the transfer to\r\nthe custody of the FBI.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The exhibit will be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The photostat referred to was marked Commission Exhibit 381A and\r\nreceived in evidence.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How many of those transfers did you issue on this\r\nparticular run?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Up to the time you passed the Texas School\r\nDepository.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I really don't know because I didn't, see. I didn't know\r\nanything--I didn't put out any--most of the transfers that you put out\r\nat this time or that time of day are for elderly women which get the\r\nshopper's transfers, in other words. It has got a line there, and it\r\nentitles them to a free ride back to where they came from, in other\r\nwords, and that time of the morning, because when I get downtown, in\r\nother words, you can catch a bus at Elm Street going to any place that\r\nI would go without having a transfer, in other words.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Would you have any recollection of how many\r\npassengers you picked up from the beginning of the line to the time\r\nthat this man got on at the middle of the block on Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, I don't--I recall that I didn't have very many\r\npassengers that day, because I figured that everybody had done gone to\r\ntown to see the parade, to see the President, and it just wasn't what\r\nfew passengers I recall was mostly elderly women that was going into\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nI don't recall just how many of them I did have on the bus.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But you did have these two men, the teenager and\r\nthis other young man?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; that were on the bus.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And you very specifically recall giving a transfer\r\nto this woman with the suitcase and the man who was in the second seat\r\non the right-hand side?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. On the right side that got off. In other words, to the\r\nbest of my knowledge that is the only two transfers that I put out\r\ngoing through town that I can recall at all, I mean, because I don't\r\nrecall putting out any more transfers than those two that I put out\r\nwhen I was held up there in traffic.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mr. McWatters, on this transfer is the name of Shopper's\r\nTransfer.\r\n\r\nDoes that have any significance?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; that is what I was telling him. In other\r\nwords, if they want a Shoppers; well I put my punch mark in that\r\nShoppers there, which they cannot use it for a transfer, in other\r\nwords, any more than other than--all the stores, most of them in\r\ndowntown Dallas, if you buy as much as a dollar's worth between the\r\nperiod of ten and four in the afternoon they give you a little white\r\nslip which entitled you to ride what is called the Shopper's Pass. It\r\nrides you back, but in other words you have to, a passenger has to, ask\r\nfor it in other words.\r\n\r\nWhen they say a Shopper, you take a punch and punch your punch mark\r\nwhere it says Shoppers, but they are not supposed to use the transfer\r\nthen to transfer to another bus. They are supposed, in other words,\r\nwhere it is punched in the store, get it exchanged for their return\r\nfare.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, all your transfers have on them printed the\r\nword \"Shopper's Transfer\"?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; they do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And in order to make it a Shopper's Transfer so that the\r\ntransfer can be exchanged for a merchandise coupon to ride home, it has\r\nto have your punch in the Shopper's Transfer area, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is correct, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you know, did you remember, an elderly woman getting on\r\nyour bus some place on Elm after you left St. Paul?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Not that I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember when this man, do you remember when this man\r\nknocked on your window, and you opened your bus and let him on, some\r\nplace around Murphy or Griffin and Elm, that an elderly woman got up in\r\nthe bus and moved?\r\n\r\nDid you see that or anything like that?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, I don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know whether or not you left an elderly woman off down\r\naround in the Oak Cliff area some place?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. The best I can recall I had two or three or four elderly\r\nwomen, the best I can remember on the bus when I left town, but I don't\r\nrecall where any of them got off.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know a woman named Mary Bledsoe?\r\n\r\nDid you pick anybody up at St. Paul and Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I really don't--I really can't recall whether I did or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have no further questions.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I would like to ask a few, if I may.\r\n\r\nAm I correct in saying that the direction of your bus at the time of\r\nthese events you have testified to it was going west on Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. West on Elm. In other words, west, the streets of Dallas\r\nall run east and west.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. But when you got to Houston Street, then you turned\r\nsouth?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I turned south, that is correct.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did your bus pass the Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I mean does it pass it directly?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. It doesn't pass it directly, no, sir. In other words,\r\nwhere I turn to the left on Houston Street, the book store is across on\r\nthe opposite corner.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Now, as you reached Lamar Street, or did you reach\r\nLamar Street on that date before you passed near the Texas School Book\r\nDepository?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. You mean--yes, I have to pass Lamar Street before I get\r\ndown to there.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Now, this first affidavit you made on November 22----\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Which has been referred to in the testimony.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. It stated in this affidavit that, \"I picked up a man on\r\nthe lower end of town on Elm around Houston.\"\r\n\r\nNow, you picked up a man at that time it would have been after you\r\npassed Lamar Street?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. It would have been after I passed Lamar.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. The remainder of the affidavit, which has been made a\r\npart of the testimony----\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Refers to that you picked up a woman and you asked her\r\nif she knew the President had been shot, and then the man--you asked\r\nher then to speak to the man behind her.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. \"Who said the President was shot in the temple.\" Now,\r\nthen, this incident that you testified to in this affidavit, was after\r\nyou had passed Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; that is right.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was the man that you were talking about in this\r\naffidavit the teenager?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. At the time this affidavit was made, were you asked\r\nabout any other man who may have been on the run that day at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I don't remember whether I was or not.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What was it then that caused you at some time later to\r\nremember that another man had got on the bus near Murphy and had left\r\nthe bus, as you have stated in 2 or 3 blocks in the vicinity of Elm\r\nStreet?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, just like I say, the best I can remember is the\r\nman, I believe in fact beside the boy, I believe he was the only man on\r\nboard the bus. After I got to recall, in other words----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. But what I am asking you is what it was that caused you\r\nto remember the teenager at the time you made this affidavit on the\r\n22d, and what it was that, why it was that, you didn't at that time\r\nspeak of the other man who had got on the bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is what I say, it just didn't--it just doesn't\r\nregister, I don't know.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Were you asked whether or not any other man was on the\r\nbus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I don't remember whether I was or not.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. When was it that you remembered about the second man\r\nbeing on the bus, the man that you now state got on around Murphy\r\nStreet and got off at Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well. I just studied and tried to remember everything\r\nthat I could. In other words, I still, you know, just try to see if I\r\ncould remember any incidents or anything that was said or done that I\r\nhadn't thought of and everything.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I think you stated you did not give the teenager any\r\ntransfer?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, I don't--no.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was the fact then that you were shown a transfer by the\r\npolice that called your attention to that?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I guess that would probably be----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Another man?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That would probably be the reason.\r\n\r\nI don't know of any other reason that it would be unless it was the\r\ntransfer, that I can recall.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Are you absolutely certain that you did see another man\r\non that bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Do you mean the day?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. A man other than the teenager?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; I picked up a man.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Where?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Along about Griffin Street that knocked on the door of\r\nthe bus.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Is that near Murphy?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is near Murphy, in other words, Murphy is over here\r\nzig-zags, Griffin zig-zags across to Murphy.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Why was it then that when you made this affidavit, you\r\nwouldn't remember that a man knocked on the door to get in the bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Just like I say, I guess it never did dawn on me until\r\nI just got to thinking about it and everything, and I had this boy, I\r\nmean was the one I was referring to in that affidavit right there.\r\n\r\nIn other words, he was just kind of a slight build, so far as him and\r\nOswald, I guess they probably somewhere in the same size, I don't know.\r\nBut I was mistaken in that, in other words, that was the boy right\r\nthere----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did the police ask you if any man other than the\r\nteenager was on the bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I don't recall whether they did or not.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you tell the police at that time on the 22d or the\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation on the 23d about a man knocking on the\r\nwindow and wanting to get into the bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, I believe I did.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What is it about this transfer that makes you know that\r\nit was a transfer which you issued?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, you look at that old punch mark, I guess as many\r\ntimes as I have punched it----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Does each--does each driver have a different punch?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you weren't here he showed us his punch and he punched\r\nit for us. He has got his punch.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Each driver has a different punch. They all are\r\nregistered. In other words, regardless of how many there are--that is\r\nmy punch right there--there is some shape or form different, just like\r\nI say the superintendent has every man's name and a punch mark right on\r\ndown, in other words, so when----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Do you know whether the punches are different in the\r\nshape that they make?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir; no, sir; I don't know anything about that. I\r\nknow----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What you are saying is, then, you have punched so many\r\nof these transfer that you recognize your own punch?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I can recognize my own punchmark. I don't think there is\r\nsupposed to be another----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Is there anything else on the transfer which indicates\r\nthat it was one which would be issued on your bus?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, except only where it is punched--in other words,\r\nI come off of Lakewood Boulevard there where that would be the only\r\ndistinction right there, is the punchmark and the name of where I have\r\nit punched there.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did anyone tell you, either the police or the FBI or\r\nany other officer or any other person, tell you at the time you made\r\nyour first affidavit or later that there was another man reported to\r\nhave been on your bus and got off?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I don't recall.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Have you ever reported to the police the fact that you\r\nhave carried as a passenger since November 22d the teenager whom you\r\nhave now identified as having the name of Milton Jones?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Did I ever report it to the police?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Have they ever been back to talk to you any more about\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. About this matter?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. They have never been back to me. The only time they have\r\ntalked to me----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you ever see----\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. I beg pardon?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You saw--was any of the men in the police lineup ever\r\nidentified to you as being Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Any men in the----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes, I think you saw the men in the lineup, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Before you were asked to select a man in the lineup,\r\ndid the police or any officer identify any one of them as bearing the\r\nname of Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir; they never stated anything.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Later was he identified to you in any way?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Was he identified to me?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. As being Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, they didn't tell me as far as saying, mentioning any\r\nname Lee Oswald, it was never, the name Lee Oswald, I don't believe was\r\never mentioned while we was back there.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you ever see this same man you call No. 2 in the\r\nlineup again--did you ever go back there after that time and see this\r\nsame person again?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Identified as No. 2?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir; I never did go back any more, that was the only\r\ntime I was ever there was the one on November 22, about 6 something in\r\nthe afternoon.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Have you seen photographs of a man who is named in\r\nthose photographs as being Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Have I saw them?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Well, now, you have seen this young man, Milton Jones,\r\nseveral times since then?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Now after having seen him several times since then,\r\nand having seen these photographs of the man who is identified as Lee\r\nOswald----\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Does Milton Jones look like Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, they both, just like I say, about the same height,\r\nand same build, and everything, as far as identifying looking at a man\r\nin the face--of course, I know him now, distinctly.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. But at this time would you identify him as Lee Oswald\r\nfrom the photographs you have seen of Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Right now?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No. At the time, I couldn't then, in other words, even\r\nfrom the recalling of what I seen him then, I mean just to say that the\r\nheight and size of him, no, I wouldn't make the statement that I could\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Are you certain that you did see some man who knocked\r\non the window of your door of your bus and wanted to get in your bus at\r\nsome point near Murphy?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; I am positive about that. There was----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You saw that man get off later?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Before you got to----\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Before I got to Lamar Street, between Poydras and Lamar.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. That is all.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. The best I can remember is that is where I issued two\r\ntransfers. That is the best I can remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. To clear this matter up with your punch, you have your punch\r\nthere, have you?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was issued to you by the Dallas Transit Company?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Does that make a different mark in a transfer than any other\r\npunch issued to any other driver in the Dallas Transit Company?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It is a distinctive mark?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; it is supposed to be, there is not supposed to\r\nbe any driver that has a punch that makes a punchmark like my punch.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. So your supervisor could take this transfer and compare it\r\nwith his list in his office?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And he could see McWatters issued this transfer?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right; that is the way, if they have any\r\ncomplaint, any transfers brought in to him, he has a list. When he\r\nlooked at the punchmark he knows the man's name, and his badge number.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And this document here which is 381, you have identified that\r\npunchmark as the one made by your punch?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir; that punchmark was made by that punch right\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, there are on this transfer two punches, there is one in\r\np.m., and there is marked punch Lakewood. Now, the p.m., refers to the\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But Lakewood refers to a certain location on your run,\r\ndoesn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. If this transfer was issued around the Lamar area or St.\r\nPaul--Elm area, is there any place that you could punch and show that\r\nparticular location?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You always punch at the end of your destination?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, that is the usual procedure on it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, on one side of Lakewood is Beckley, where is that?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, that is on the opposite of town from----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The other side is Capital. Where is that?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Capital, well, Capital is in north Dallas, I believe it\r\nis.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Are those Beckley lines listed on the transfer on your run?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. No, sir; I don't--you mean on the transfer?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Well, that is, in other words, we all--they have so many\r\nof the lines listed, in other words, I believe they have two divisions,\r\nI believe all the buses that work out of the east Dallas division\r\nhave----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. We can make this pretty simple. You have on this transfer\r\ncertain names. When you are running Marsalis-Ramona-Elwood-Munger, how\r\nmany possible punches would--location punches would you make?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. In other words, if I was--Marsalis when I left the end\r\nof Marsalis out there I would punch my transfer Marsalis, if I left the\r\nend of Ramona I would punch them Ramona. In other words, that is so\r\nthey can't ride them, in other words, they can't ride the transfer.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, Lakewood is at one end of your run?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And Marsalis-Ramona-Elwood is the other, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. So you would punch one of those names?\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Going that way, while at Marsalis, I would punch the\r\nLakewood when I would leave Marsalis coming toward Lakewood, I would\r\nhave Lakewood on the front of my bus but I would punch the transfer\r\nMarsalis.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have no further questions.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Thank you very much, Mr. McWatters.\r\n\r\nMr. McWATTERS. Thank you, gentlemen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF WILLIAM WAYNE WHALEY RESUMED\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mr. Whaley. I have here an exhibit which I will mark 370.\r\n\r\n(The document was marked Commission Exhibit No. 370 for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. 370 is a photostat of a manifest of yours, and it is dated\r\nNovember 22, 1963. I mark this 370. Do you recognize that?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. That is the original trip sheet.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In your handwriting?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; in my handwriting.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I will offer this into evidence at this time, and the\r\noriginal trip sheet as Exhibit No. 382.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So admitted.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibits Nos. 370 and 382 were received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have here a bracelet which is marked 383. Take a look at it\r\nand tell me if you have ever seen it before.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; as near as I can tell that is the bracelet he was\r\nwearing the day I carried him, the shiny bracelet I was talking about.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mentioned the fact that the man who sat in the front seat\r\nof your cab, which you drove from the Greyhound Station on Lamar Street\r\nover to 500 North Beckley, had an identification bracelet on him.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, it looked like an identification bracelet. It looks\r\nlike this one, sir, it was shiny, I couldn't tell exactly whether that\r\nwas the bracelet or not.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But it looks like one of them?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; it looks like it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Offer this in evidence.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So admitted.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 383 was withdrawn and a photograph of the\r\nbracelet was received as Commission Exhibit No. 383-A.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What hand or what arm did he have it on?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. He had it on the arm next to me, which was the left arm.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was it protruding below the sleeve or jacket?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. His coatsleeve was like this when he stretches his arm out\r\nit was short, that is when I saw it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Where was his hand when you saw it, if you can\r\nrecollect it?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Well, just moving. You know you catch any bright object,\r\nwhy you notice it, that is how I noticed it. He was just moving his\r\nhand around. When the old lady stuck her head in the door and asked me\r\nto call her a cab, why he reached over to the door to open it like he\r\ntold her she could have that one but she decided that she would wait\r\nfor the next one because he already had that one. And that is when I\r\nsaw it, sir.\r\n\r\nIn the picture, I believe, I don't think he had it on in that picture\r\nin the paper the next morning.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This is something you clearly noticed while he was\r\nriding in the car with you?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; I noticed it; yes, sir. I always notice\r\nwatchbands, unusual watchbands, and identification bracelets like\r\nthese, because I make them myself. I made this one.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, you have a particular interest in\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, I particularly notice things like that.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you notice anything unusual about it?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir, it was just a common stretchband identification\r\nbracelet. A lot of them are made of chain links and not stretchbands.\r\nStretchbands are unusual because there is very few of them.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, this was an unusual band?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; this one was a stretchband like the one you\r\nshowed me.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It is sort of a hobby with you to make these kinds\r\nof wristbands?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; I make watchbands like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you recall when you told, talked to the Dallas police\r\nofficers that you told them that you had seen a heavy identification\r\nbracelet on this passenger's wrist?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir, I told them about the bracelet.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You told the FBI officers, also?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; but I don't remember saying it was heavy because\r\nI wouldn't have known how heavy it was without handling it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You described the bracelet?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I just described the bracelet as a shiny bracelet.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. A moment ago you told us about this man getting into your cab\r\nand an old lady coming up and asking for a cab.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did the man sitting next to you open the door?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. He just started to, sir, just reached for door handle and\r\nshe said she wanted me to call one. She didn't want that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did the man who was sitting beside you in the cab say\r\nanything?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Only that she could have that one.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He said that?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I think that is all.\r\n\r\nAny other questions of this witness?\r\n\r\nDid you describe the shirt that this man had on to the police?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir, I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you tell them?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. To the best of my ability, I did, sir. I just told them it\r\nwas a dark colored shirt with what looked like a silver lining.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you shown the shirt later?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. About, it was at least a week later, sir, an FBI man\r\nbrought the shirt over and showed it to me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that the same shirt you saw here?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I think it is, sir. I am not positive but it had the same\r\nkind of silver streak in it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you tell the FBI man who brought the shirt to you?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I told him to the best of my ability that was the shirt he\r\nhad on.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did the man riding with you say anything at all except tell\r\nyou where he wanted to go?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. That is all, sir, except he said when we got to where he\r\nwanted to go he said, \"This will do fine,\" when I pulled over.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, in the police lineup now, and this man was talking to\r\nthe police and telling them he wanted a lawyer, and that they were\r\ntrying to, you say he said they were trying to, frame him or something\r\nof that sort----\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Well, the way he talked that they were doing him an\r\ninjustice by putting him out there dressed different than these other\r\nmen he was out there with.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, did anyone, any policeman, who was there, say anything\r\nto him?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; Detective Sergeant Leavelle, I believe it was,\r\ntold him that they had, would get him his lawyers on the phone, that\r\nthey didn't think they were doing him wrong by putting him out there\r\ndressed up.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did the man you identified have any reaction when\r\nthey brought the group out, did he have any reaction that you noticed\r\nat the time you identified him?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Only that he was the only one that had the bruise on his\r\nhead, sir. The only one who acted surly. In other words, I told this\r\nCommission this morning you wouldn't have had to have known who it was\r\nto have picked him out by the way he acted. But he was the man that\r\nI carried in my taxicab. I told them when I identified him. I didn't\r\nidentify him as the man who shot the President. I identified him as the\r\nman who rode from the Greyhound to 1500 North Beckley with me.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you point him out with your hand?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir; I did not. They asked me which number he was\r\nstanding under and he was standing under No. 2.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Could he hear you make this identification?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir; he couldn't see me.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. He couldn't see you?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir; they had the black silk screen that keeps the\r\nprisoners from seeing the people who show up.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have no further questions.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I have no questions.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know a taxi driver named Darrell Click?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I may know his face, sir, but not his name.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You don't know his name?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. We go mostly by numbers.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Okay, no further questions.\r\n\r\nThe witness is excused.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. May we wait just a moment, please? Would you like\r\nto make a statement, Mr. Powell?\r\n\r\nMr. POWELL. Mr. Chairman, I think I might say just this: I am here\r\nrepresenting Mr. Walter Craig, as I think the Commission understands.\r\nI have been here the last two days. In a conversation with Mr. Rankin\r\nyesterday morning we agreed that rather than my asking questions\r\ndirectly of witnesses, I would make suggestions to Mr. Ball or to one\r\nof his associates, and I have been following that practice yesterday\r\nand today, after consulting with Mr. Murray who is also here for\r\nMr. Craig, and Mr. Ball and his associates have followed up these\r\nsuggestions that we have made.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The suggestions you have made have been\r\ntransmitted to Mr. Ball or his associates and have been asked of the\r\nvarious witnesses?\r\n\r\nMr. POWELL. That is correct.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Any other questions?\r\n\r\nThank you very much, Mr. Whaley.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Thank you, sir. I am glad to be able to be of service.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 12:30 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Friday, March 13, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MRS. KATHERINE FORD, DECLAN P. FORD, AND PETER PAUL GREGORY\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 9:10 a.m. on Friday, March 13, 1964,\r\nat 200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Representative Gerald\r\nR. Ford, member.\r\n\r\nAlso present were Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel; Norman\r\nRedlich, assistant counsel; and Charles Murray, observer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MRS. KATHERINE FORD\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will be in order.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ford, I would just like to read to you a short statement\r\nconcerning the purpose of the meeting.\r\n\r\nI think you have had a copy of it but I will just read it for the\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The purpose of this hearing is to take the testimony of\r\nMr. and Mrs. Declan P. Ford and Mr. Peter Paul Gregory. The Commission\r\nhas been advised that Mr. and Mrs. Ford made the acquaintance of the\r\nOswalds shortly after their arrival in the United States in June\r\nof 1962, and that Mrs. Marina Oswald lived in the Ford home on two\r\ndifferent occasions in November 1962, and for a period following\r\nFebruary 12, 1964.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has also been advised that Mr. Gregory was contacted by\r\nMr. Lee Harvey Oswald shortly after Mr. Oswald's return from Russia as\r\na result of which Mr. and Mrs. Oswald made the acquaintance of a large\r\nnumber of Russian-speaking people in the Dallas and Fort Worth area.\r\n\r\nSince the Commission is inquiring fully into the background and\r\npossible motive of Lee Harvey Oswald, the alleged assassin, it intends\r\nto ask the above witnesses questions concerning Mr. Oswald, his\r\nassociations and relations with others and any and all other matters\r\nrelating to the assassination.\r\n\r\nWould you please rise and be sworn, Mrs. Ford.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you give before the Commission will\r\nbe the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you\r\nGod?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You may be seated. Mr. Liebeler will conduct the\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. My maiden name?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Katrina Evstratova.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Where were you born, Mrs. Ford?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Nova Tchkarsk.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Could you tell us just briefly how you came to come to\r\nthe United States, Mrs. Ford?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. How I came to the United States; I was in Germany during the\r\nwar. I was taken there by Germans, not in concentration camps, but in\r\nlabor camp, and after we were liberated by Americans I got acquainted\r\nwith an American soldier and was married to him, and that is how I came\r\nstraight to Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What was this soldier's name that you married?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Skotnicki.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you were married to him in about 1946?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you subsequently divorced him?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Approximately 4 years ago, a little over 4 years.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I want to ask you a few questions about Mr. Skotnicki and\r\nsome of the people that he knew.\r\n\r\nDo you still have any friends that were your friends when you were\r\nmarried to Mr. Skotnicki?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; I would think, some neighbors, I would say that we\r\nwould be still--we don't see together, acquaintances together with\r\nthose friends but I am sure they are still friendly. He is still\r\nfriendly with the same people as I am. I would say Campbells down on\r\n6468 Lane, the old house still stands there I would think he would\r\nstill be friendly with them, and I know them very well.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You don't continue to see Mr. Skotnicki in any way, do\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No, no; I have no reason for it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know whether or not Mr. Skotnicki has a friend by\r\nthe name of John M. Grizzaffi? That is spelled G-r-i-z-z-a-f-f-i.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I think that he is friends, yes. It is a neighbor across the\r\nstreet. He was friendly with that man.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you tell us just a little bit about Mr. Grizzaffi,\r\nif you know about him?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I think he is in grocery business, that is what I know about\r\nhim, and I believe, I wouldn't say he is busy in local politics but\r\nhe is always talking about people he knows around town that are in\r\npolitics, and that is about all I know. I was never very friendly with\r\nhis wife and so I just know a little bit about him.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know whether Mr. Grizzaffi is a friend of Jack\r\nRuby's?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That I don't know. I was told by my son that Mr. Grizzaffi\r\nknew Ruby.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Your son told you that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. My young son.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What is you son's name?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. My son's name is Gary.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. How old is he?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Twelve.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. He is a son by Mr. Skotnicki?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Is he living with you and Mr. Ford?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. He lives with me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know whether Mr. Skotnicki knew the Oswalds?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I don't think he did.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know whether he knew anything about the Oswalds?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Unless something was told by my son or something, by\r\nchildren. I don't think he knew them personally.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You yourself didn't have any conversations with Mr.\r\nSkotnicki about the Oswalds?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I want to go through a list of names which I will go\r\nthrough fairly quickly and ask you if you recognize any of these names\r\nor if you know any of the people.\r\n\r\nDo you know a gentleman by the name of George Senator?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. How about a man by the name of Ralph Paul?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Andrew Armstrong?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know a lady by the name of Karen Bennett?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Bruce Carlin?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know a man by the name of Roy William Pike?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. How about Larry Crafard?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You yourself don't know Jack Ruby in any way?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Does Mr. Ford know Mr. Ruby?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I don't thing so; no.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know a lady by the name of Earlene Roberts?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Mary Bledsoe?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Bertha Cheek?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. John Carter.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. How about Mr. and Mrs. A. C. Johnson?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. A. C. Johnson, I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know of any connection between Mr. Oswald, Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald and Jack Ruby?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I don't know. I don't know that they knew each other.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you tell the Commission, Mrs. Ford, how you first\r\nmet the Oswalds?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. We were invited there after lunch, the Oswalds had a\r\nluncheon at Anna Meller's house, and we were invited after luncheon to\r\nmeet them, and that was our first contact with them.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Can you tell me when that was, approximately?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I would say it was approximately at the end of August of\r\n1962.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Will you tell us who was at the luncheon?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I believe there was Mr. and Mrs. Ted Meller and George Bouhe\r\nand the Oswalds and ourselves, I believe that is all I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Who first told you about the Oswalds? Did you hear of\r\nthem the first time that you came to that luncheon or had you heard of\r\nthem before?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I had heard of them maybe a couple of weeks before from Mr.\r\nGeorge Bouhe, I believe, who had told us that there was a young Russian\r\ngirl came to Fort Worth and the man was out of a job, and that was the\r\nreason for us to try to help them. And she had a baby and so forth.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Mr. Bouhe tell you anything else about the Oswalds?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; he was just telling that the man was having a very hard\r\ntime finding a job because the last job he had was in Minsk or so.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. He told you that Mr. Oswald had been in Russia?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; he did. He told us about that he was in Russia and\r\ndecided to come back and he brought a Russian wife with him who didn't\r\nspeak English and had a tiny baby and both were having a very hard time\r\nat the moment.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Mr. Bouhe tell you anything about the circumstances\r\nunder which Mr. Oswald went to Russia?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; nothing like that was discussed.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. At the luncheon at which you and your husband, and Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Meller----\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And Mr. Bouhe were present----\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What was said at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. At the time we were present, actually, I was only interested\r\nin economic conditions of Russia at the moment, for me to compare them\r\nwith the time I was living there, and they were showing some pictures\r\nof Minsk and Leningrad and some of the pictures of some of the friends\r\nof Marina's friends, girl friends.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you have any conversations with the Oswalds at that\r\ntime about the kind of apartment that they had when they lived in Minsk?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I don't remember any particulars about that apartment, but\r\nthey were talking about, I think, about the apartment, I don't know\r\nexactly what was said about it. I know it was, I think I remember they\r\nwere saying they lived in one room and sharing a kitchen.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did they tell you how they came to meet each other in\r\nRussia and how they came to be married?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. It wasn't said at that particular time, but I remember\r\nMarina was telling me afterwards how they came to meet each other, and\r\nI believe it was at a dance some place at the Hall of Culture or some\r\nplace they would have in Russia dances, and she met him there.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Of the people that were at this luncheon, aside from\r\nyourself, how many of them were originally born in Russia?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Mr. Bouhe and I believe and Mr. Meller would be--I believe\r\nTed Meller was born in Poland.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did it appear to you at the time of that luncheon that\r\nLee Harvey Oswald lived like other Russian people lived or did it\r\nappear that he might have received preferential treatment in some way.\r\n\r\nDid you gather an impression about that during the course of your\r\nconversation?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; I believe he was still in something of a hardship in\r\nliving in Russia, that was the reason for his leaving Russia. That it\r\nwas rather difficult to make his ends meet as we say, because he was\r\ncomparing it with his living standards of Marina's uncle who was a\r\ncolonel or a major, I don't know, I wouldn't say because I don't know.\r\nHe was saying that they had a very lovely apartment consisting of maybe\r\nfour or five rooms and he was comparing it with his apartment, and such.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he compare his apartment with the apartment of other\r\nworkers who worked in Minsk?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I don't think so. He was just comparing, I believe with\r\nher uncle.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he tell you how much money he was paid at his job?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I don't remember, he was saying or Marina was saying\r\nsomething, 80 rubles, I don't know which one gave me that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he indicate whether that was about the same that\r\nother people were paid or more?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; about the same as the workers were paid.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, is there anything else you can remember about that\r\nluncheon, the conversation at that luncheon which you would like to\r\ntell the Commission about other than what we have already touched on?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, I don't know what was important. I know he was\r\nsaying--my husband made a sort of a joking statement that he had a\r\nchild born in Russia, and he said, well, if it wasn't for the Americans\r\nshe wouldn't be born over there because he had to wait so long to get a\r\nvisa, I don't know what else he said.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. That was a visa for him to return?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; and the little girl, June, was born there because of\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And Lee Oswald blamed the Americans for causing the delay?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he indicate what attitude the Russian authorities\r\ntook when he told them he wanted to come back to the United States?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I don't know. He didn't say anything. I don't remember\r\ndiscussing it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he say anything about the attitude they took toward\r\nletting Marina leave Russia and coming to the United States?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I don't believe anything was said about that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Is there anything else you can remember about that\r\nluncheon now you think we ought to know about?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, I am thinking, I really don't think I remember\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What was the next contact then that you had with the\r\nOswalds?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I think it must have been at--in late October or the first\r\npart of November when Mr. Bouhe called me and said that Marina made a\r\ncall to Anna Meller and told her she is leaving her husband because of\r\nshe can't stand the beating and treatment any longer from Lee Oswald,\r\nbut none of us knew at the moment that he had mistreated her that way,\r\nbut at the time at the party I remember seeing Marina with bruises on\r\nher face and she made excuses of running into a door or something at\r\nthe night when attending the baby.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. This was the first time you saw her?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right, the first time I saw her I did see bruises on\r\nher face. And George Bouhe was saying that Anna Meller, I don't know\r\nwho picked her up, I believe George Bouhe because Anna Meller don't\r\nhave a car, they went to Marina's apartment and picked up the baby\r\nthings, playpen, and other things that she could take with her at the\r\ntime, and she stayed there, I couldn't say how many days.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Stayed with Mrs. Meller?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. With Mrs. Meller, I don't think it was longer than a week,\r\nand then my husband was supposed to go away for a week or so; I don't\r\nremember the time, I thought he was going--he said he had to go Austin\r\nand I told Mr. Bouhe that I could take her for a week, just take her\r\nin, if she didn't have a place to go, so I did, and she stayed with me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Why did she come to you as opposed to staying with Anna\r\nMeller?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Anna Meller has a small two-room apartment and I have a\r\nbigger house. We have four bedrooms so I could make room for her and\r\nher children.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When Mr. Bouhe called you and told you about this, did he\r\ntell you anything about why Marina was leaving Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; he said because of mistreatment and she decided she is\r\nnot going to return to him any longer, and Mr. Bouhe said, told her,\r\nif she made a promise to him she is not going to return to that man he\r\nwill help her all he could to find a place to stay permanently such\r\nas maybe as help at home at somebody's house until she learns enough\r\nEnglish to start going on her own whatever she could do.\r\n\r\nAnd I think he was trying to do, he was trying to find a place and that\r\nis the reason before that she needed a place to stay until she did find\r\na place, and I kept her for a week until my husband returned and then\r\nanother friend of mine, who also has a fairly large place where Marina\r\ncould be comfortable, she told me she could keep her there for as long\r\nas Marina wished to stay.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. How did Marina actually get to your place? Did Mr. Bouhe\r\nbring her to your place?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; he did.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know how long Marina stayed with Anna Meller\r\nbefore she came to your place?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. It could be a week but I am not sure. But I don't think it\r\nis longer than a week.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Lee Oswald come to see Marina while Marina was at\r\nyour house?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; he did not but he did talk to her on the telephone, I\r\nthink approximately after 3 days, after she stayed with me he called\r\nher up every night, I think he did call, every evening.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Marina talk to him on the telephone?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. She was hesitating at first but he wouldn't leave the\r\ntelephone until she came to telephone and she was talking to him. I\r\ndidn't hear what he was saying but she was telling him not to call on\r\nher again and not to bother, she was not going to return to him.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she tell you what the conversations were about?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No. She did not say anything.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When was this period that she stayed with you,\r\nOctober and November of 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I believe it must have been the first part of November.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Of 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. 1962.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. 1962.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, did Marina Oswald pay you anything for the privilege\r\nof staying at your home at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I did not expect it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was there any arrangement she would work in the house?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; there was no arrangement; no.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Tell us what Marina told you while she was staying there\r\nabout her relations with Lee Oswald and particularly as to why she\r\nseparated from him and what the difficulties were in their marriage?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I think mostly it was a mistreatment by him that she\r\ncouldn't stand any longer, she was saying.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Mistreatment by him?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Mistreatment by him; yes. That is what she was saying.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she tell you any more specifically than that what the\r\nproblem was?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; she didn't really. She did not elaborate. She did not go\r\ninto explanations of their living together.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she mention that Lee Oswald was jealous of the\r\nRussian friends that Marina had?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; she did. She told me that, that he was.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did they argue about that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, I didn't know if they were arguing about that. I know\r\nshe said that he was very jealous of them helping Marina and jealous\r\nfor the reason that he wasn't able to provide her at the time with any\r\nof the things that they were giving Marina, clothes, and baby clothes,\r\nand I think that he was--it was making him rather mad because he said\r\nhe was unable to buy the things for her at the time, and I know that he\r\nwas not accepting things people were giving him. He was telling her not\r\nto take them but she was taking them because she needed them. I suppose\r\nthey were arguing about that but I don't remember the particulars.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you form an impression at the time that Marina lived\r\nwith you for that week as to what the cause of their difficulties might\r\nbe?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. She mentioned one time that soon after marriage he told her\r\nhe didn't love her any more in any way. So I don't know what is the\r\ndifficulty, I don't know if that is what she mentioned. She did not\r\nexplain and didn't go into explanations of this.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you think, did you form an opinion as to whether this\r\nseparation and the difficulties they were having was primarily the\r\nresult of Oswald's behavior or did you think Marina might have been\r\npartially responsible for it, what did you think?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. My own opinion was that Marina was responsible for it. I\r\nthink Marina was and I think now she is a rather immature girl.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. She is what?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I think she is rather immature in thinking.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. And a lot of times she agreed herself about provoking him in\r\na way by arguing about his mother or things of some sort.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What did she tell you about arguments concerning his\r\nmother?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, I don't know really. She would say something that he\r\nwas badly brought up or something like that.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. He was what?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Badly brought up, some sort of thing, and he would get mad\r\nand slam her for that or something and then he was telling her not to\r\nlet mother in, and when mother comes to the apartment she would let her\r\nin and then they would argue over that.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. He would tell her not to let the mother in?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right, and she would because she said she just\r\ncouldn't do that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Marina tell you at that time what her feelings toward\r\nLee's mother were?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I don't remember her saying anything one way or the other if\r\nshe liked her or didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember whether Marina might have mentioned that\r\nLee Oswald had spoken to a neighbor and told the neighbor that Marina\r\nwas from Czechoslovakia?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I don't know of anything like that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You didn't know at any time that Oswald didn't want\r\npeople to know that his wife was from Russia? Marina didn't mention\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Not around us, we didn't because we knew it anyway.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Marina didn't mention anything like that to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When Marina lived with you during that time did she tell\r\nyou anything about her background in Russia, did she tell you about her\r\nbirthplace and youth in Russia?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; she was going into more of that in talking with me\r\nmore than anything else, I think. Actually most of the time she was\r\ntalking about her friends during, I think about when she was going to\r\nschool, about her boy friends and things she was talking to me about\r\nher friends and she did go into talk about when she lived in, let's\r\nsee, it is not Ukraine, I think it is Bessarabia, right now where would\r\nthat place be, to live there, and she was very young, I believe, let's\r\nsee she was born during the war, and they were sent somewhere, I don't\r\nknow where they were sent, but then she lived there in Bessarabia for\r\na few years, because there was a lot of food there and vegetables and\r\nthey were sent there, to feed, like they sent the cattle to be fed\r\nup, I believe that is the expression she used after the war where the\r\nchildren could eat a lot of fruit and then she returned to Leningrad, I\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nI don't know how long she lived in Bessarabia.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What did she tell you about her life in Leningrad, just\r\nbriefly, if you will summarize it for us.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, really, I don't know--the only thing I knew was about\r\nsome of the things she was telling me about friends she had there, she\r\nhad a friend that was a medical student and she told me she talked a\r\nlot on the telephone to him, and she was rather, I thought that is\r\nwhere I made the impression to me, it made an impression to me she was\r\nimmature, she liked to talk to the man for a long time in the evening\r\nbut she was afraid to be seen with him in the streets, he was ugly, so\r\nI thought it was rather strange, you know, and then----\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she tell you who she was living with in Leningrad?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; she was living with her stepfather, that is what I\r\nremember, living with a stepfather she was telling me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she tell you about her relations with her stepfather?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; she did. She didn't like him and I think he doesn't\r\nlike her, either; they never did.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she tell you any reasons why she did not like him?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. She was telling me a lot of times, she was telling me about\r\nher mother, the mother didn't want to show affection to Marina or\r\nsomething like that because the father was jealous of that affection,\r\nand I think he did some sort of a cruel thing to her once that she\r\ndoesn't--she still remembers as being very cruel, something of accusing\r\nher of taking some family silver and selling it while she knows that\r\nhe had pawned the silver for buying liquor, because it showed up, she\r\ncouldn't explain it to her aunt and it just made her feel very bad at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nI think she just could never forgive him for that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Marina tell you about her move to Minsk?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, she didn't tell me at that time. I just found it out\r\nnot too long ago that was the reasons she wanted to get away from a\r\nfriend that she found out later that he was married, she went with him\r\nfor a short while she did not know he was married, but she did not go\r\ninto particulars of explaining the whole thing to me.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. She was going with a man who was married?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes. She met him somewhere, she had two tickets, she said,\r\nto a theater or to a movie, and she wanted to sell one ticket and he\r\nwas the person who bought the ticket and they sat together in a movie\r\nhouse and later on, I believe, I don't know how they got to know each\r\nother later on, it was a few times they met, they have seen each other\r\nand at one time she went to his apartment, to the house that he lived,\r\nto call on him, and someone said that, \"oh, that is the man who has\r\nthat little boy,\" and she said she just turned around and went home.\r\nThat is the time she found out he was married and was deceiving her.\r\n\r\nBut I don't know why she left, I mean why, exactly she left but I think\r\nthis is the person that was her reason for leaving Leningrad.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she tell you that she had left in part at least to\r\nget away from this man?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is what I understood.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, did Marina tell you why she married Lee Oswald when\r\nshe was in Russia, did she talk to you about that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; she did.\r\n\r\nI don't exactly know why she married him. But she said she met him at a\r\ndance, and soon after that, I don't know the reason why he was in the\r\nhospital but he was in a hospital, and she called on him, and I don't\r\nknow how long he stayed there, either, and she liked the man, I think,\r\nand she bought him an Easter Egg, that was during Easter sometime and\r\nhe was very surprised that such a thing could be done in Russia.\r\n\r\nI think it rather pleased him very well. She said somehow she felt\r\nsorry for the man because none of her friends liked him, and mistrusted\r\nhim, and she felt sort of like she was on the defensive, she wanted to,\r\nshe felt sorry for him in a way.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did she tell you why her friends didn't trust him?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; she said they were thinking that he was an American\r\nspy or something like that, that is what they were trying to tell her.\r\n\"Maybe he is a spy, and how can you trust a man like that?\"\r\n\r\nShe told me the other day, she says no one trusted him, but she says,\r\n\"I wasn't afraid of him,\" that is how she put it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Marina indicate to you whether she thought or\r\nhad any reason to believe that Oswald was a spy?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; she didn't. She didn't think so. She never said that, I\r\nmean.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Marina ever indicate to you or did you gather\r\nthat one of the reasons that Marina married Lee Oswald was she had the\r\npossibility of leaving the Soviet Union in mind?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes. She never did go out directly and say that but I think\r\nI got an impression that was her reason. She was telling me that way\r\nbefore she met Oswald she was dreaming of coming over here, and that\r\nis, I mean gathering by that later I thought that she wanted to come\r\nover, and he was, I suppose he was a reason.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In this connection, I wanted to ask you whether you ever\r\nhad any contact with any newspaper reporters from the Dallas newspapers\r\nabout this, did they ask you about this at any time?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. About this I don't remember if they asked me. I don't\r\nremember. But a couple of reporters came to my house soon after the\r\nassassination and talked to me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I represent to you that there was a story in the November\r\n27, 1963, issue of the Dallas Times Herald which told about some\r\nRussian-born woman in Dallas to whom Marina had supposedly confided\r\nsome of the most intimate secrets of her stormy marriage, in the words\r\nof the newspaper article. Do you have any knowledge whether that would\r\nbe you or somebody else?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I think that would be me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you tell the reporters that Marina had told you that\r\nMarina had felt sorry for Oswald because everybody hated him even in\r\nRussia?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; I might have said that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Marina did say that to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; she did.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Marina tell you anything at this time about their\r\ntrip back to the United States and the difficulties that they\r\nencountered, or how they did it, that sort of thing?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I never talked with her about that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was there any conversation while Marina stayed with you\r\nduring that week in November 1962, about the possibility of a divorce,\r\nof her divorcing Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. The possibility--I know she didn't want to go back to him at\r\nthe time she stayed with me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. But you don't remember any specific conversation?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I don't remember any specific conversation.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. About divorce?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Frankly, there was talk about it, she didn't want to go back\r\nand I just told her, I felt that Marina wasn't really the domestic type\r\nshe could stand very long being a help at home, not that I think she is\r\nnot capable of taking care of her own house. I see now since she has\r\ngot even her own place she keeps it very clean and her children are\r\nalways neat. But she wasn't right for domestic help and I told her to\r\nstay with Lee, that is what I told her myself, and wait until she could\r\nbe able to take care of herself other than working in a house.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What did she say about that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. She didn't say, she was really just listening, I think, and\r\nshe didn't say anything.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Marina say anything to you at this time about wanting\r\nto go back to Russia?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No, no; she didn't want to.\r\n\r\nIn fact, she told me that Lee soon after he came to the United States,\r\nhe was telling her that he would want to go back because he couldn't\r\nfind a job here and he was, of course, seeing a lot of difficulties for\r\nhimself, and Marina said, \"If you want to go back, you can go but I am\r\nnot going,\" that is what she told me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Marina told Lee if he wanted to go back he could but she\r\nwasn't going to go back to Russia.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Is that all the conversation that you had with her about\r\ngoing back to Russia at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right. That is about all.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you know where the Oswalds lived at this time when\r\nMarina came to the Meller's house and then to your house?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I have never been at their apartment, and she couldn't\r\ntell me. I know she lived in Oak Cliff, the Dallas section about\r\nsouthwest, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In Dallas?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you know whether Marina had lived with a lady in Fort\r\nWorth before they came to Dallas?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; I know they stayed there but I didn't talk to her\r\nduring the time and I didn't visit her. I know she stayed at Elena\r\nHall's house and I think Elena had an accident just before that and she\r\nwas--she stayed in bed most of the time. Marina was helping her out.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, you had only seen Lee Oswald, up to this week that\r\nMarina came to live with you, one time, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. That was the Meller's luncheon party?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Were you surprised on the basis of any judgment you might\r\nhave made of Lee Oswald to learn that he had beaten his wife?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Just from seeing him once I would not have made--no; that\r\nhe has beaten his wife; no, I didn't think at that time. I did, when\r\nshe came in after I learned that he has beaten her, I was rather--I\r\nremember the bruises on her face and that rather made signs to me that\r\nhe did.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did it surprise you that he would have done this?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; it did not surprise me. I just felt that young man as he\r\nwas, if he was--decided to go to Russia after living in a country like\r\nthe United States, I didn't feel he was very, what shall I say, how\r\nwould you say, a person's mind won't work at this time----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Unstable?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Unstable, that is how I felt. I felt a person like that, I\r\nfelt frankly could do anything.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did she ever tell you that Lee Oswald was the\r\ncause of these bruises on her face?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, she did tell me after she came to the house to stay\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is what I mean?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The bruises you saw on her face at the house she\r\ntold you Lee Oswald was the cause?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes, that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Let's clarify that a little. Did Marina Oswald have any\r\nbruises at the time she came to live in your house in November 1962?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; that is right. But she stayed at Anna Meller's house\r\nfor a week and when she came to Anna Meller's house I heard there were\r\nbruises at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Anna Meller tell you that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Either Anna Meller or George Bouhe told me that. I don't\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you yourself did see bruises on her face the first\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I did see the first time; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she tell you that Lee Oswald had given her those\r\nbruises?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. She told you that when she stayed with you?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Tell us the circumstances under which Marina left your\r\nhome in November of 1962, where she went and what happened?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, she stayed with me a week, and my husband came home\r\non Saturday, and we discussed with another friend of mine for Marina\r\nto go to her house and stay there as long as she wanted, and I think\r\nSunday morning this friend of mine, Anna Ray, came with a station wagon\r\nand picked all her things up, her playpen she had for baby, and diapers\r\nand things, and took her to her house and I believe my husband was with\r\nher, too, at that time and that is how she left.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, do you know how long she stayed with the Rays?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. With the Rays. I think she just stayed there, she had had\r\ndinner there, I believe she stayed one afternoon. I don't know how soon\r\nLee came there but he came soon over to the house, but Marina said he\r\ncried and begged her to return, he would be nothing, if she didn't\r\nreturn, he would be finished, that is what he was telling her, and she\r\nsaid she just couldn't say, no to him.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. So she returned to Oswald at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; she returned to Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever talk with the Mellers about their\r\nexperiences with Marina when she lived at their house for that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I don't remember, she did not discuss it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you remember or did you know where Lee Oswald was\r\nliving prior to the time that Marina came to Dallas?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I don't know where he lived at any time.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you know where he was working at that time or if he\r\nwas working at all?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. During the time they lived in Dallas, I believe, I don't\r\nknow exactly, though, either George Bouhe or Anna Meller's husband\r\nfound him a job in a printing shop, I think, or I believe it is\r\nprinting shop, somewhere in Oak Cliff, and that is why they had an\r\napartment there. I remember that is the reason because George Bouhe was\r\nrather mad at Marina for taking an apartment in Oak Cliff because it\r\nwas too far for him to drive and help her when she needed help and the\r\nbaby, I think he was taking her to the dentist and taking the baby to a\r\ndoctor to help her in ways that she couldn't do herself.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Who was doing this driving?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I believe George Bouhe did this. He has the car.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Where does Mr. Bouhe live?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. He lives, well, I don't know his address now. I know where\r\nhe lives but I don't know the street number.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. But it is not in the Oak Cliff Section of Dallas?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; it is not. I think it would be in the east part of\r\nDallas.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. During the time that Marina stayed with you, did she say\r\nanything to you about Lee Oswald's political beliefs or his attitudes\r\nconcerning politics?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; she didn't talk to me about that and I didn't ask her.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I didn't talk with Lee about that, I didn't feel the need of\r\nit myself to discuss politics with him.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you discuss that subject with any of your friends?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, yes. They were telling me, those friends that went\r\nto his apartment, were telling me, that they have seen books like\r\nKarl Marx open in front of him, just lying there on the table, that he\r\ndidn't even hide it when someone came in, and then someone else said\r\nthere was a book laying there of How to Be a Spy, laying right open\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember who told you that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I believe it was Lydia Dymitruk.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. D-y-m-i-t-r-u-k.\r\n\r\nDo you remember anything about that particular conversation?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, she was telling me, she took, when the baby left my\r\nhouse, she had a cold, and it was getting worse, and I believe soon\r\nafter she left Anna Ray, the baby began to have a fever, and Lydia, I\r\nbelieve, I don't know how she got to go to her apartment, really, I\r\ndon't know the reason she went there; she went there and wanted to take\r\nthe baby to the doctor and she told me of an incident that says even\r\nMarina was ashamed of Lee because when she took her to the hospital Lee\r\nwas lying about that he didn't have a job at the time, which Lydia knew\r\nthat he did have. He didn't want to pay for the services, and people at\r\nthe hospital was asking him how does he pay for the apartment and he\r\nwas telling them that, \"My friends were helping me,\" and Marina just\r\nsaid something in Russian that Lydia remembers, \"What a liar,\" you\r\nknow, behind his back.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she say that so he could hear it?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I think so, because she said it aloud.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And she said it in Russian?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; she did.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In front of Lydia Dymitruk?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; that is right, and Lydia was rather mad about the whole\r\nthing and she said she is not going to help them any more if they are\r\nacting that way.\r\n\r\nThe baby wasn't helped at the hospital. I think the hospital didn't\r\nwant to take the child because the father couldn't pay, that is what I\r\ngot, the father couldn't pay for it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever see Marina say anything adverse to Oswald in\r\nhis presence, did she run him down or make fun of him in public so far\r\nas you know?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. As far as I know, I don't, except the first time, the one\r\ntime, I would think when she said, \"What a liar,\" in front of him.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You don't know of any other instance when she would have\r\ndone that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I don't know of any other instance.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know whether she ever spoke of his political views\r\nbefore other people or make fun of him?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I don't remember except lately I have been talking to\r\nher about that and she said she thought of him being young, and she\r\nthought she hoped it would pass with years, that he would mature, this\r\nis what she was telling me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she tell you whether or not she discussed politics\r\nwith him herself? Did she argue with him about anything?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. She said she was arguing with him about that. Certainly, in\r\nfact, he called her, she was typical American girl, that she is not\r\ninterested at all in politics, except in the material things that he\r\nwasn't interested in. She said she wanted a house and a family and he\r\nsaid, \"All the American girls think that way\" and he thought he married\r\na different sort of a girl, a Russian girl.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, think back on that week that Marina stayed with you.\r\nIs there anything else that happened or is there anything that Marina\r\ntold you that you think we should know about and about which I haven't\r\nalready asked you?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I cannot think of it at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When was the next contact that you had with the Oswalds'?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. It was right after Christmas before New Year's. I believe it\r\nwas the 28th of December, a Friday. I gave, I had, a party for all the\r\nfriends, and I invited a family by the name of De Mohrenschildt, wife\r\nand husband, and Mrs. De Mohrenschildt called me up and asked me if she\r\ncouldn't bring Marina and her husband over because she was saying it\r\nis a shame the way all their Russian friends have forsaken them during\r\nthat time and they had no place to go and the De Mohrenschildts were\r\nthe only ones helping them at the time, and I told her I didn't object\r\nto it. So she brought them over with them.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was Mr. Bouhe at the party?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; I think so.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Mr. and Mrs. Frank Ray?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Ray?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Were Elena Hall and her husband there?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I don't remember them being at that party. I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Were the Mellers there?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You mentioned that De Mohrenschildt was there.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And the Oswalds.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was there a gentleman by the name of Allen A. Jackson at\r\nthe party?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And his wife?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. And his wife.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember any conversations or observe any\r\nconversations between Marina Oswald and Mr. Jackson?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Marina Oswald, no; I don't think so. I don't think Marina\r\nspoke English at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Were Mr. and Mrs. Charles Edward Harris at the party?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you talk to Mr. and Mrs. Harris about the party\r\nafterward?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I might have.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she mention translating a conversation between Mr.\r\nJackson and Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; she did not mention it to me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you didn't see her doing that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I didn't see her doing that at the party.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you have any conversation with Lee Oswald at the\r\nparty that night?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you notice anybody else talking to him?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; I did. I noticed a girl talking to him who was of\r\nJapanese descent but I don't remember her name.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was there anything striking about that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I think, the only thing it was that I think he talked\r\nto her most of the time and wasn't making any conversation with anyone\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Marina comment on that to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; she didn't. But I heard from somebody else that she did\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Who told you that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I think George Bouhe again. He always spoke to everybody.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What did Mr. Bouhe say about that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, he said something that I asked Marina afterward and\r\nshe told me that it wasn't true. He said that Lee talked to that\r\nJapanese girl like a--it is an expression in Russia to take a bath and\r\nthen beat themselves with the leaves from a tree, and the leaf would\r\nstick to the body, in the wintertime, and so the expression from that,\r\nlike a leaf sticks to the hot body when you take a bath, you know.\r\nThen I suppose Lee struck her as just not saying anything--and I asked\r\nMarina and she said he did not do it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was there any talk at the party about Oswald's\r\nexperiences in Russia or his marriage to Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. During the party?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I didn't talk to him at all.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you didn't overhear anybody else talking about\r\nOswald's experiences in Russia?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You mentioned that the Oswalds came with De\r\nMohrensehildt. Did they go home with De Mohrensehildt?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; they did because Mrs. De Mohrensehildt stated that the\r\nlady who stayed with Oswald's child had to leave at 12 o'clock and they\r\nleft before that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. After the Oswalds left the party, was there any\r\ndiscussion about the Oswalds that you can remember?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; really not. I don't think they made a big impression on\r\nthat party on anybody.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Can you fix the date on which your party was held?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. The 28th of December.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What year?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. 1962.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was there any other party the next day or the day after\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. There were other parties. I don't think that Marina and\r\nher husband were present. I don't know if you would call it a party,\r\nthere was a sort of a get-together at my house afterward because some\r\npeople stayed over in town for a few days, I think that was the Rays,\r\nand the Harrises, and a friend of my husband from Louisiana, Sullivans,\r\nstayed there. But they hadn't met Oswald, they came much later after 12\r\no'clock. So we sort of had a get-together.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. This would have been the next day?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. The next day.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. On the 29th of December.\r\n\r\nWas Mr. Bouhe----\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; Mr. Bouhe wasn't present at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was there any conversation at that time about Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I don't remember, 1 don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember that there was a party or open house at\r\nMr. Bouhe's house on the 29th?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. If there was, I wasn't present, I didn't go.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was there a party at Meller's house?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. There was a party or luncheon.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you go?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I didn't go.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you hear any conversation during this period of 3 or\r\n4 days about Oswald, anybody speculating about Oswald or discussing his\r\nexperiences----\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I think----\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In Russia?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I think at that time everyone rather--George Bouhe said he\r\nwas not going to help them any more, he was through, since Marina, he\r\ntried to help her very hard, and she did not hold her word about not\r\ngoing back to him. So he said since she went back, so now it is her\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nWell, he is sort of that type of man, he is trying to help hard and\r\nif you are doing what he says otherwise he is not going to help, so\r\nthat was it. So it was rather, sort of Marina and her husband were\r\ndropped at that time, nobody actually wanted to help, and I think what\r\nthey heard about Lydia Dymitruk was saying that he couldn't help those\r\npeople. I mean they were just sort of--he couldn't reach them. He was\r\nlying in hospital and things, we sort of gave it up.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Lydia make that remark at one of those parties or was\r\nthat at a previous time?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Oh, that was a previous time. As soon as she left to go back\r\nto her husband, George Bouhe even took the Russian dictionary back to\r\nhim. He told her to give it back and he was just through with him.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. So far as you know Mr. Bouhe had no more contact with the\r\nOswalds after that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you have any conversation with any of your friends\r\nin Dallas or Fort Worth on the question of Oswald's ability to leave\r\nRussia and come back to the United States and bring Marina with him?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. We didn't speculate on that until really later, until now,\r\nafter the assassination that subject came up, and people asking why\r\nthey left so soon. He was telling me it took them a year, so I don't\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was there any conversation prior to the assassination,\r\nduring this period in 1962, any speculation as to whether Oswald might\r\nbe an agent of any government?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No. I frankly didn't think he was capable of it. That was my\r\nfeeling on it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Were there any conversations on that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No. There were not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember that Mr. Bouhe suggested at one time that\r\nOswald was a mental case?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Mr. Bouhe, he might have; yes, I think we all thought that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember that Mr. Bouhe said that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I don't remember particularly that he would say that.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Did you say, \"We all thought that\"?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; we thought that, that he was rather mentally--you just\r\nsaid the word before.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Unstable?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Unstable.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Unstable.\r\n\r\nWhy did you think that, Mrs. Ford?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. In my own opinion, I just didn't think that a man as young\r\nas he was could come to the conclusions just by rather experiences or\r\nliving a long time in America and I mean studying the whole economic\r\nstructures of different governments, and things that he would come to\r\nthe conclusion that is the best thing for him. I think he was just\r\nrather too young for that.\r\n\r\nI thought he was just rather--something was rather wrong with the man.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You based this----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In the conversation that Oswald had with this\r\nJapanese lady at your party, did you overhear any of that conversation?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I did not. I did not have time, I was the hostess and I\r\njust didn't get to talk to anyone.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you ever ask the Japanese lady what the gist\r\nof the conversation was or what the content of the conversation was?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I never have. In fact, I have not seen her after that.\r\nThat was the first time she came to my house. I mean I have seen her\r\nlater on in the beauty shop but I have never talked to her about it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did she speak English?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; she speaks English well.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. At this get-together that you mentioned at your house on,\r\nI think it was the 29th, after the party, the informal get-together,\r\nthe Rays were there, and the Sullivans, and Mr. and Mrs. Harris.\r\n\r\nWould it refresh your recollection if I suggested to you that some of\r\nthe people that were there at that party said the possibility of Oswald\r\nbeing a Russian agent was discussed in detail at that party in that\r\ngroup?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You don't remember any of the discussion?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I don't remember any of the discussion.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Is there anything other than what you told us that led\r\nyou to believe that Oswald was unstable or a mental case?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Nothing, except that I was thinking about him myself beating\r\nhis wife. That would have been one reason. I don't think that any\r\nstable man would do that, especially she appeared to me very sick sort\r\nof a woman, not sick, but frail and fragile, I think any man who\r\nstrikes a woman who is incapable of striking back, I would think would\r\nbe unstable.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. This Russian group that we have been discussing, Mr.\r\nBouhe and these other people, do they see each other regularly? Is\r\nthere sort of a Russian community in Dallas, would you say?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; there are about, I think, maybe four families in Fort\r\nWorth and maybe half a dozen in Dallas or more than that, but that\r\nmainly we see each other, and there is one Eastern Orthodox Church in\r\nRussia where that is where we actually meet each other.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In Dallas, you mean, or Fort Worth?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Dallas. I am sorry. In Dallas, and we still observe our\r\nEastern Orthodox religion during the holidays and sometimes like\r\nChristmas falls 13 days after the American Christmas so there is New\r\nYear's sometimes we celebrate those.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. How well do you know the De Mohrenschildts?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, I know George De Mohrenschildt the same,\r\napproximately, I will say I was acquainted with him for approximately\r\n14 years but I don't know him well.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You mentioned before that De Mohrenschildt was the only\r\nmember of the Russian community that kept on seeing the Oswalds and\r\ntrying to help them.\r\n\r\nWas there any discussion about that among your friends?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; George De Mohrenschildt is rather an odd ball, among\r\nRussians anyway, so it was nothing unusual about him doing that. He was\r\nalways doing something unusual. He would even go to church with shorts\r\non, you know, this is something, he would do something that nobody else\r\nwould do.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Shorts?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Shorts.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Short trousers?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember any specific conversations about the\r\nreasons as to why De Mohrenschildt continued to associate with the\r\nOswalds after the rest of you had given them up.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, I remember his wife was telling me like she felt it\r\nwas their duty now since everybody else dropped them and they needed\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember any conversation with the Oswalds among\r\nany of your friends as to whether or not Oswald went hunting in Russia\r\nand had access to weapons?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; I think that George Bouhe was telling me that. He was\r\ntelling him that he was going hunting and he told him about killing\r\nducks or something of that type.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Can you remember that in any greater detail?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I don't remember it. I only remember that because of the\r\nway he was saying, \"ducks\" in Russian, George was saying that he was\r\nusing sort of a word when you call for it, it is a small duck rather\r\nthan for ducks, he was saying that his Russian wasn't perfect.\r\n\r\nI mean in that conversation he was using, an example of he was saying,\r\nwhen he would go hunting for ducks, instead of \"utki\" for ducks he\r\nwould say \"utitschki\" that would mean small ducks, and he was saying\r\nthat his Russian was imperfect.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. That is Oswald's Russian?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What about Marina's ability to speak English at that\r\ntime, did she speak English at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I don't think she did. She could speak a few words but I\r\ndon't think she did.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did any of you attempt to teach her English?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; George Bouhe was attempting to teach her to write and\r\nwas giving her lessons.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Can you tell us something about that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, he was telling me that he had gotten her a dictionary\r\nand he had--or some other book anyway and he was telling me that every\r\ntime he saw her, made an attempt to see her I don't know how he did\r\nthat but anyway he was giving her a lesson and she was supposed to have\r\ncompleted it by the next time in writing.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Mr. Bouhe tell you anything about Marina's ability to\r\nspeak English or write English? Did Marina learn as a result of that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. He said she was doing very well. I don't know if she learned\r\nto speak but he said she was a good student.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Lee Oswald ever object to this effort on Mr. Bouhe's\r\npart?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, he was objecting to anyone of the Russians helping her.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Helping her learn English?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Not learning English, but I mean helping her about anything.\r\nI don't know whether he was objecting to that. But we talked with Lee\r\nabout this, why he wasn't teaching her English and he wasn't speaking\r\nto her and he said that he didn't want to forget Russian and he really\r\nsaid, \"If she wants,\" this is what Marina said the other day, that he\r\ndidn't actually object, but he thought if she could learn Russian just\r\nby herself in any way she could, she could, but he is not going to help\r\nher. He just didn't want to help her by speaking English.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You mean English.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right. He is not going to talk English with her, he\r\nwanted Russian. He wanted for the little girl to learn Russian and for\r\nhimself not to forget it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he indicate, in other words that he wanted Marina to\r\nspeak Russian so that he could maintain his own ability in Russian?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And he also wanted his children to learn to speak Russian?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. After this party on the 28th of December, what was your\r\nnext contact with either Lee or Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. After the 28th? I think after the assassination, I only\r\nheard once about her, I just heard she went to New Orleans. Again a\r\nfriend, Lydia Dymitruk, was in the bakery and she said she saw Marina\r\ncoming in and she told her she thought Marina was pregnant and she told\r\nher Marina was going to New Orleans. That is the only time I have heard\r\nanything about them after that party. The next contact I had with her\r\nwas, I don't know the date but it was soon after the assassination when\r\nI just felt sorry for Marina, I thought she was, I always felt she was\r\ninnocent, I thought she was a naive girl in a lot of ways and that is\r\nwhy she got into a lot of problems and troubles.\r\n\r\nI just felt if she didn't have anybody there except the FBI and nobody\r\nto speak in Russian, she didn't know how everybody felt, I would\r\nthink she would feel very badly, so I called Mrs. Paine who, I found\r\nout after the assassination she was a friend of Marina's and I told\r\nher that if she would have a contact with Marina, tell her that we\r\nsympathize with her that she is in the position that she is, and to\r\ncall me or to let me--that I would like to talk with her.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Can you tell us approximately when it was that you talked\r\nto Mrs. Paine?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I think that was either the first part of December, I think\r\nit must have been at least a week after the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In early December?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What happened after that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Right after that, I think the next day Marina called me, and\r\nshe said the reason she called me was because Mrs. Paine told her that\r\nI called, and let her know.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember specifically that Marina told you that\r\nshe, Marina, had talked to Mrs. Paine?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, this, I don't know. I think that is what she did. In\r\nfact, I think that Mrs. Paine told me she talked on the telephone with\r\nMarina but I couldn't be positive about it. I know she wrote letters,\r\nthey wrote, I know Mrs. Paine wrote to Marina, and I couldn't exactly\r\nsay she talked to her on the telephone or how it was, either Marina\r\ncalled Mrs. Paine or I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You say you know Marina wrote Mrs. Paine a letter? Did\r\nMarina tell you that she wrote Mrs. Paine during that period?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I don't remember. I know later Mrs. Paine kept calling me\r\nand asked if I heard from Marina, because she kept writing to Marina\r\nand Marina didn't answer, so she wanted to know if I talked to her,\r\nthat she was the reason she was calling me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Mrs. Paine indicate to you after she called you\r\ntrying to find out from Marina, did she indicate to you she had or had\r\nnot heard from Marina since the assassination?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I believe she told me she talked on the telephone with her\r\nright soon after, after I did.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. During this first telephone conversation with Marina, was\r\nthere anything said about the events of the assassination in any way?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; not at all, except that Marina was very surprised the\r\nway people treated her. She was telling me that if it had happened in\r\nRussia, she just would--she just knew she wouldn't be talking to me or\r\nanybody else. She knew they would be sent to Siberia or shot right away\r\nis what she said.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Is that what Marina said?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is what she said. I told her that was the big\r\ndifference in Russian Government and the American Government. And\r\nthen she asked me for advice. Someone contacted her at the time from\r\na western paper and offered her $10,000 or something for the story\r\nand she asked me if it was the right thing to do because she felt she\r\ndidn't want to make money on such a thing, a horrible thing as that,\r\nand I advised her to take the money because I thought she would need it\r\nfor the children.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, after that first--was there anything else you\r\ndiscussed in that telephone conversation?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I think we talked mostly about that book deal, about the\r\noffer she had.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. After that first telephone conversation, what was the\r\nnext contact you had with Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That was quite a long time after that when it was again Mrs.\r\nPaine contacted me, and wanted to know if I could go and translate for\r\nthem for, we were saying about that yesterday, what is that union.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I did talk to you yesterday afternoon.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I have forgotten, I couldn't say because it is important.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was it the American Civil Liberties Union?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right, it was the American Civil Liberties Union and\r\nI talked to my husband about that and he tried to find out; I told him\r\nto find out all he can if it had anything to do with a Communist front\r\nor something and if it was I didn't want to do anything about it, to be\r\nconnected with it, and he couldn't find anything out, but at the same\r\ntime I told him that I did not want to go with them but I didn't mind\r\ntranslating. So I did translate and they wanted to know if Marina was\r\nheld incommunicado, and she answered. Mrs. Paine brought me that letter\r\nto translate from English to Russian, and the man in charge, I don't\r\nknow his name, I have forgotten his name, you mentioned it yesterday,\r\nif you say it I will remember it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Let's come to that in a moment, let's develop the story\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nHow did the question of the American Civil Liberties first come up, did\r\nMrs. Paine bring it up?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; that is right, because she tried to write letters to\r\nMarina and she wouldn't answer and she thought she was held in sort of\r\na protective custody and couldn't see anybody. That is what she felt,\r\nand she was rather imprisoned is what she thought.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. So Mrs. Paine came to you with a letter that was written\r\nin English, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And she asked you to translate into Russian?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was that a letter from Mrs. Paine to Marina or a letter\r\nfrom the Civil Liberties Union?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; from Civil Liberties Union.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And so you translated that into Russian?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right, I translated it into Russian.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Up to that point was Mrs. Paine the only person who\r\ndiscussed that subject with you.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you have any further discussions with Mrs. Paine or\r\nanybody else?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. We tried to find out about the Union and my husband called\r\nlawyers and friends of his who would know about it and called the\r\nSecret Service and FBI and nobody would tell us anything about it. They\r\nwould send us somewhere else, refer it to someone else to find out, so\r\nwe don't find out.\r\n\r\nSo, I just decided on my own not to go, just to translate.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Well now, what is this about going with them, what did\r\nMrs. Paine ask you?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. She thought that maybe since I knew Marina she would rather\r\nconfide in me more than just anyone like reporters or someone just from\r\nthe Union would go there.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. But you declined to go with them?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did there come a time when somebody else spoke to you\r\nabout this subject?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No, not at all. Just during that time I wanted to find out\r\nif she was in prison.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Marina respond to the letter that you translated?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; they received an answer right the next day, and the man\r\nfrom Richardson, who I think is the head of that Union in Dallas, came\r\nto my house and asked me if I could translate it back into English.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember that man's name?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; if you mention it I would know.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would it refresh your recollection if I mentioned the\r\nname of Gregg Olds?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right; yes, that is his name.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What did Mr. Olds say to you when he came to see you?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. He just brought the letter and he was rather standing and\r\nhe wasn't talking very much. He was kind of a quiet person, I think.\r\nI took the letter--he thought I could just sit there and do it real\r\nfast in front of him, but I had to take it into a room and sort of\r\nconcentrate in the living room and translated and giving it to him.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Thank you,\" and he left.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Can you tell us approximately when this was?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I cannot say. Let's see. I think it was sometime before\r\nChristmas, because after that I sent her a Christmas card.\r\n\r\nNo, wait a minute, I just can't say if it was before Christmas or\r\nafterward, I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember if it was before or after Marina\r\ntestified before this Commission?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That was before the Warren Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. It was before the Warren Commission?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you talk to Marina again on the telephone after this\r\nfirst time?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; I talked to her on the telephone because through my\r\nhusband's brother who is a professor in one of the universities in\r\nCalifornia, he had a friend by the name of Isaac Levine who does write,\r\nwho speaks Russian and writes rather--he wrote a book of on the mind of\r\nthe assassin, Trotsky's story. He wanted to contact me and to find out\r\nif Marina had signed a contract on writing a book. So I told him that\r\nI would call the managers, since there was published in the newspaper\r\nat that time, and to find out if they did, and I did call. I called her\r\nlawyer and I asked if she signed for a book, and I called Levine long\r\ndistance and told him she did not have a contract signed. Then he told\r\nme that he would like--he wanted to know if he could arrange to see\r\nMarina, and I told him that I would ask the manager and he told me to\r\ncontact, for Levine to contact, the attorney and the manager. I saw\r\nlater on they have somehow gotten together. I think he wrote to them.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did there come a time when Marina came to your house to\r\nvisit?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; she brought a letter she wanted me to translate. It was\r\nafter this, after I had a contact about the writer Marina called me,\r\nthis is the first time, the first time after the assassination that she\r\ncalled me on the telephone and we talked about that and I told her that\r\nthe man had contacted me and he speaks Russian. I thought it would be\r\na good opportunity for her to write if she wanted to since she could\r\ncommunicate easily with a writer that speaks Russian. I read his book\r\nthat he sent me, and he makes real sense. I invited her to come out\r\nto dinner and, of course, I didn't expect that there would be a whole\r\ncompany with her.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she come out?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; they did, they came out, the Secret Service and the\r\nmanager were there and everybody so I cooked a Russian dinner.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Can you tell us approximately when that was?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. It was shortly before the Commission, maybe about 2 weeks\r\nbefore the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Late in January sometime?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. During that time that Marina was there did you have any\r\ndiscussion with her about the events of the assassination or anything\r\nrelating to that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she discuss with you her possible testimony before\r\nthis Commission?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No, not during that time.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Marina come back to your house again before she came\r\nto testify before the Commission?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes, she was once more at my house. During the first time\r\nher manager brought a letter that she wanted to bring to the Governor\r\nabout how she feels about Ruby's being executed. She told me she didn't\r\nwant, she didn't feel, if she could help she didn't want to have the\r\nkilling of a dead man on her conscience, on her mind. She wanted me to\r\ntranslate that letter and I did translate it.\r\n\r\nAnd I left it at home and later on they came by, I told Mr. Martin\r\nthat I would come by his house and bring the letter to her after I\r\ntranslated.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"If you wanted to we can come back to your house like we did\r\nbefore.\" And they did and they picked up the letter.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you have any copy of that letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I think maybe I have a copy of it, of my translation. But I\r\nam not positive. I know I put it in a desk.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This was a letter from whom to whom?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. From Marina to, I will say they did--I think it was advised\r\nto her to write it to the Governor, to Governor Connally.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. To Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. To the present Governor of Texas, that is the Governor of\r\nTexas?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You said that Marina said to you she did not want to have\r\nanother death on her conscience?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right. She feels like, she told me she feels\r\nstrongly about it, that people shouldn't kill one another, if there is\r\nno war.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she use the words as you remember it, the words \"on\r\nher conscience\"?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I don't remember that word really but I just feel this\r\nwas, she would feel very badly if that would happen.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she seem to feel that she had some responsibility for\r\nthese things?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. What do you mean by that? I mean how, responsibility in what\r\nway?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. That she was in anyway a cause of any of these deaths\r\nherself?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I wouldn't think she feels this way, no.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Tell us about the conversations at the second meeting.\r\nWere there any conversations at that time about her testimony before\r\nthe Commission or about the assassination?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I believe she mentioned she was going to Washington at that\r\ntime. She knew about going, I believe Martin said that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. But she didn't talk about her testimony?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; she didn't, not at all she didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you talk to anybody else about her testimony before\r\nthe Commission?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I don't know, I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Mr. Martin say anything about it?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I don't remember, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When was the next time that you saw Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. After she came back from Washington.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she come to your house then?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; she did not. Her lawyer, in fact Mr. Martin, called me\r\nand told me she is staying at her brother-in-law's, and that he wanted\r\nto break the partnership with her, and he asked me if I could go with\r\nher attorney and translate for her the conditions of the break, the\r\nbreaking of the contract, and I agreed to go with them.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. To Robert Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. To Robert Oswald's house; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did there come a time after that when Marina came to live\r\nwith you in your house?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; when I came there, Marina told me she couldn't stay\r\nanother day, she thought, in Robert's house. It was such a small house\r\nand small children and she just didn't like to stay in there at all,\r\nand so I told her, \"Well, you could come and stay at my place if you\r\nwanted to,\" and she said she would love to do that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. After Marina moved in with you, did you talk to her\r\nabout her testimony before the Commission, that she gave before the\r\nCommission?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; we never talked about what she did. She told me she had\r\nit, written something. She said something maybe that someone mentioned\r\nin the Commission that that was rather good for a novel but not for the\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\nShe said, well, she had written the way she remembers her past, those\r\nare the words she made.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. She was referring to a statement she had written.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. She had written, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she show it to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I have never seen it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. During the time that Marina stayed with you or at any\r\nother time, did she say anything to you about this incident where Mr.\r\nOswald was allegedly going to attack Mr. Nixon?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I hadn't learned about that until later.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you discuss it with Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Somehow she didn't feel, she didn't want to discuss it very\r\nmuch, she felt badly that it came out, I suppose or something. She\r\ndidn't want it to.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. But she did talk to you about it?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. She talked to me because I had to translate it to her,\r\nthe discussion with her lawyer, and he, I think, the FBI were at the\r\nlawyer's office while they went to talk to her about the subject, and I\r\nhad to translate what she was telling the lawyer about it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you have any conversations with her about this Nixon\r\naffair at a time when the FBI was not present?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I think going home, I just maybe, I don't know what I asked\r\nher. She said the same thing actually what she said in the office, that\r\nshe held him in the bathroom and I asked her how was it finished, and\r\nshe said, \"I talked him out of it,\" and he said, \"If you will keep me\r\nin the bathroom, just give me something to read.\" She didn't talk very\r\nmuch about it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ask her how she could lock Lee in the bathroom?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; it never occurred to me to ask her and I did not ask her.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you discuss this question with anybody else how she\r\ncould lock anybody in the bathroom?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Not until yesterday with my husband, how she could do it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Is there anything else that Marina told you about this\r\nNixon affair that you can remember now?\r\n\r\nDid she tell you when it happened?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; she told me only that, that she said she mixed up dates.\r\nShe thought it was one month and it was, supposedly happened, another\r\nmonth and she said that a lot of times she doesn't remember exactly the\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she tell you anything about the General Walker affair?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; she told me something about that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What was that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. She said in the first place, people are saying that maybe\r\nshe knew ahead of time and she said she did not. Lee told her after it\r\nhad happened, after he had shot, and he told her, \"Well, I just tried\r\nto shoot Walker.\" She said she was rather angry and she told him if he\r\never does that again, she said, \"Don't ever do that again,\" she was\r\nrather disgusted--that he shouldn't do such a thing.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she tell you about any note that he had written in\r\nconnection with the attack on General Walker?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; she didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she tell you whether the Walker incident occurred\r\nbefore or after the Nixon incident?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I don't know. She never said it to me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she discuss with you during this period that she had\r\nbeen living in your house any of the details of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I, frankly, just didn't feel like asking her questions, I\r\nreally felt like I just wanted to help her, that is all. She never\r\nbrought the subject up herself.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she say anything about what happened on Thursday\r\nnight when Lee Oswald came back from Irving to Dallas?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; she said that was not long ago, and she somehow found\r\nout someone, I think Robert, told her there was some evidence that\r\nsomeone saw a boy running across--a boy saw someone running across\r\nthe yard or something, and he thought maybe there was some other man\r\ninvolved. And she began to say, \"Well, if Lee didn't kill the President\r\nwhy did he come home on Thursday and why did he leave his ring at home\r\nand why was the gun taken from the garage.\" I mean she was putting that\r\ntogether, she was making me believe that Lee was doing it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. She was considering at that time the possibility that Lee\r\nOswald was not?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Guilty of this?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; Robert, I believe, was telling her that, that there\r\nwas a possibility that somebody else did the crime and she was talking\r\nabout that to me, and that is when she said about why would he come\r\nback on Thursday when he never did that before, and also that he would\r\nleave a ring that was to her it would mean something that he didn't\r\nwant--he didn't feel like he would return or something.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you discuss with Marina her feeling as to Lee\r\nOswald's guilt or innocence in this matter?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, she feels that--no, I don't remember her discussing\r\nit. I think she asked him after she saw him after the assassination he\r\ntold her no, he did not kill anybody. He told her that. But I think her\r\nown conclusion is that he did.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you have any discussions with her as to whether Lee\r\nOswald was angry with President Kennedy for any reason?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; she told me that he actually never did say anything bad\r\nabout Kennedy. He didn't like General Walker because he compared him\r\nrather with Hitler in some way. He said, he was telling her, she was\r\nasking him why would he kill a man like that, I mean that he should not\r\nkill anybody. He said, he told her, well, if somebody killed Hitler\r\nahead of time that wouldn't have happened in Germany and he says he\r\nfelt like it was his duty to get rid of men where he was a Fascist,\r\nspeaking about General Walker.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Marina say anything about Lee's attitude toward\r\nGovernor Connally?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; she never discussed that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you talk to Marina about Marina's feelings toward\r\nMrs. Paine?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Lately, I have been talking to her about that, and Mrs.\r\nPaine, I know, tried to contact her and asked Marina why she did not\r\nwant to write to her, because I know that she had written to her often.\r\nSomehow she doesn't like Mrs. Paine and then she said she feels that\r\nMartin told her that Mrs. Paine was making money on her articles about\r\nMarina, and she don't like that.\r\n\r\nI got, even lately, Mrs. Paine called me up, and I believe it was only\r\na pretense because she knew that I had a contact with Marina and she\r\nwanted to see Marina. She came to my house and told me she wanted for\r\nme to read in Russian very slowly that she could follow me for her\r\nstudents. She is teaching Russian to some students in private school\r\nand that she could record it and then listen to it, and she said she\r\nwould pay me for the services, and at the time, the same time.\r\n\r\nSo, I had Marina that evening, I know she would want to see her, so I\r\ninvited Marina to my house and at the time Mrs. Paine was coming.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You told her Mrs. Paine was coming?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; I told her Mrs. Paine was coming and she only said she\r\ndidn't want Mrs. Paine for her to know the telephone number or the\r\nhouse she lives in. She said she would come in all the time and she\r\ndidn't exactly like her. She didn't want to see her at her house, not\r\nnow anyway, she said.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Marina and Mrs. Paine meet this evening at your house?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; they did, they talked.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What did they say to each other?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, frankly, I got an idea that Mrs. Paine came there\r\nto convince Marina to write a book with Mr. Levine who is rather\r\npersistent about it at the moment. He wants to start writing a book\r\nbefore Marina finishes with her lawyer and attorney--and her manager.\r\nShe knows and she is advised by her attorney now not to do it before it\r\nis finished, and I think Mrs. Paine tried to talk her into it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. They didn't discuss anything about the assassination or\r\nMrs. Oswald's testimony before the Commission?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I did not hear it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. So far as you heard.\r\n\r\nDid Marina ever tell you anything about the trip to Mexico that Lee\r\nOswald took?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, let's see. I think she was saying something about\r\nit that she did not mention to the FBI but she mentioned it to the\r\nCommission. She did say that. And that the FBI wanted to talk with her,\r\nthat was the reason they wanted to come back again and talk with her.\r\nThey came to my house quite often during the time she stayed at my\r\nhouse and talked with her, and she said that was the subject, and they\r\nasked her why she did not say it to start with, and she said well, she\r\nhad begun to get tired of the FBI and she didn't like to talk with them.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. The FBI had been interviewing her while she stayed at\r\nyour place?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Have you been present at any of those interviews?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; unless they needed--no; I was not present.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You were present at an FBI interview at Mr. McKenzie's\r\noffice at one time?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. At Mr. McKenzie's office, that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was there a translator present when the FBI interviewed\r\nMarina?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; there is at the moment.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know his name?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Mr. Gopadze.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Has Marina discussed with you the questions that the FBI\r\nhas been asking her?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; except this particular Mexican trip.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she tell you anything about the details of that trip?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. On that trip--she did not go into details of the trip; but\r\ncertain things about--she asked Lee to bring her a bracelet and he\r\ndidn't, things like that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she say anything about a desire that Lee Oswald had\r\nto go to Cuba?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, this is something that she talked about but I don't\r\nremember how--she said he wanted to actually go to Cuba. He wanted to\r\nget a visa to go to Russia but he would go to Russia by the way of\r\nCuba, and she thought that he would stay in Cuba and not go to Russia.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Marina tell you what she was supposed to do when\r\nOswald was in Cuba.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Frankly, I don't know. I know that subject was discussed one\r\ntime but I either had to go diaper the baby or something. I just cannot\r\nsay--I know she tried to talk on this subject to Mr. Levine once and\r\nshe explained it. It was a rather complicated sort of a thing and I\r\ncannot explain it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she express any fears that Oswald was going to leave\r\nher and go to Cuba and abandon her.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. There was a possibility--something she would stay here or\r\nsomething, and for a while, and we were asking her well, how did she\r\nintend to live while he was gone, and she thought, well, she said,\r\nwell, Lee said, \"You have a lot of Russian friends and they will help\r\nyou,\" while he is not here, that was the conversation.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Marina ever speak of any plans that Oswald had to\r\nhijack an airplane and go to Cuba?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; she said something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What did she say?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, that was again, I believe she was discussing with\r\nMr. Levine at the time about this Cuba and this airplane. It is again\r\ncomplicated, I don't think I can say it to make sense, somehow that he\r\nhad to go, had to have enough gasoline or something to go there, not to\r\nmake a stop anywhere. I could not say it to make any sense. I know she\r\nwas talking about it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever talk to Robert Oswald about the\r\nassassination?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; we we never discussed it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Robert Oswald never expressed to you any thoughts that he\r\nhad on Lee Oswald's guilt or innocence?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I understand he didn't like the cover of Life magazine and I\r\nwas rather surprised because it was in my mind like it seems there is\r\nno question. Nobody knows very sure but I feel like it was Lee that did\r\nit. And he was rather angry about the statement there that it was a gun\r\nwith which the President was killed, and he was rather angry about that\r\ncover, and that is why I thought that maybe he didn't believe that Lee\r\nkilled him.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. That is the only discussion you had with Robert Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; that is the only one, that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Have you talked to Marina about any rifle practice that\r\nLee Oswald may have engaged in?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I didn't discuss it with him but she said that she didn't\r\nthink that he went to a rifle practice. She told me that about a lot of\r\nthings that people would say that it was not true, she thought that she\r\ndidn't think it was true about Lee being at practice.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In Grand Prairie you are referring to?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In Grand Prairie?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right. She didn't think he was doing that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she say anything about him practicing with the rifle\r\nany place else?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; she didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she mention that he had practiced with the rifle at\r\nLove Field?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. She didn't say anything.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Marina ever say anything to you that indicated she\r\nwanted to go back to Russia?\r\n\r\nYou said before that she told Lee Oswald that if he wanted to go back\r\nto Russia he could go but she wasn't going to go.\r\n\r\nBut did she ever indicate to you at any time she wanted to go back to\r\nRussia?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. She did not. Again the first call after the assassination\r\nshe asked me, she said, \"You know I have a visa, a pending visa, to go\r\nto Russia and if they will send it to me, I may have to go.\" I sort of\r\nanswered her, I am pretty sure they wouldn't send her a visa now so she\r\ndoesn't have to worry about it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Yesterday afternoon we discussed some of these things,\r\ndid we not?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You mentioned the fact that Marina Oswald had told you\r\nthat at one time she was thinking about committing suicide?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; she mentioned that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Tell us about that.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. She said she didn't want to have it published anywhere, she\r\nis rather ashamed of it. But there was a time after all the--I think\r\nit was before she went to New Orleans and before she lived at Paine's\r\nhouse, that there was a time that she didn't have any friends, all the\r\nRussian friends left her, I believe De Mohrenschildts were gone during\r\nthat time, and that Lee was treating her rather badly at the time and\r\nshe just felt like she had no way out.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she tell you anything other than that? Did she tell\r\nyou she actually tried to commit suicide or was it something she was\r\nthinking of?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. She didn't tell me the particulars but somehow Lee found out\r\nwhat was on her mind because he had beaten her again and told her only\r\ncrazy people would consider doing a thing like that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. She said Lee had found out she had thought of committing\r\nsuicide?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she ever tell you how he found out?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she indicate to you in any way that she had ever\r\ntried to do this?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, she didn't tell me the particulars of it, I didn't\r\nwant to, I mean I just didn't, ask her for all the details about it.\r\nBut she was saying she was thinking about doing it at a certain time.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Well, I don't want to press you too hard about it but\r\nthere is quite a difference between thinking about doing it and\r\nactually doing it.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. She didn't hear it, she didn't hear it, did she?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. That is right.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right, that is enough.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you write to Marina at any time after the\r\nassassination?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Did I write to her?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I sent her a Christmas card; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Any other letters?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; no letters.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. How many times have you been interviewed by the FBI, do\r\nyou remember?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. FBI maybe twice. The first time, soon after the\r\nassassination; the same day that Lee Oswald was shot.\r\n\r\nActually we heard by radio, friends of ours had called us, anyone who\r\nknew Lee Oswald was supposed to come out and say it and call the FBI or\r\nthe police. So we called the FBI and we said we did know and we came to\r\nthe office ourselves and to talk about it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Have you been interviewed by the Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In our conversation yesterday we discussed your testimony\r\nand reviewed these matters. Is there anything you can remember that we\r\ndiscussed at that time that we have not talked about here now?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I don't remember. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Is there any other information that you have that you\r\nthink the Commission would like to know about that we don't have\r\nrelating to the assassination?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I don't think there is anything of importance that you don't\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you have any papers relating to these matters other\r\nthan I think you mentioned a copy of the letter that you translated for\r\nthe American Civil Liberties Union, other than that paper, do you have\r\nany papers that might relate to these questions I asked you?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; I might have a copy of the letter that Marina was\r\nwriting for----\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. To Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. To Governor Connally, and it is just rather a translation in\r\nmy own handwriting.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. On this point about the rifle practice, did Marina tell\r\nyou simply that he did not practice at the range at Grand Prairie or he\r\ndid not practice at any place with the rifle?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I think she was talking about the particular range.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Particularly Grand Prairie?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And she didn't say anything about any other practice?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. She was telling me that people were--supposedly saw him in\r\nSan Antonio and she knew for sure he wasn't there, and then she was\r\nsaying they saw him at Grand Prairie practicing and she thought that he\r\nwasn't there, and then again in Ruby's place and she knew sure that Lee\r\nwould never go to a place like that, things like that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I have no further questions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Congressman Ford, do you have some questions for Mrs.\r\nFord?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Chief Justice, I have one or two.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Proceed, please.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Marina Oswald ever tell you about her\r\nschooling in Russia?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; she did. I think that would be a junior college here.\r\nShe would finish 7 or 8 years, I don't know exactly, and then I think\r\nit is 4 years in a junior college which would make her in my opinion an\r\nassistant pharmacist.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, she went to the regular----\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. School, yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Primary school?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Following that she went on to a secondary school.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. You don't have to finish primary school. Russian High School\r\nis 10 years, and if you want to specialize in some sort of assistant or\r\ntechnical work you would finish 7 or 8 years and then you would go 4\r\nyears after that, it is a finishing technical school, whether you would\r\ncall it, where you would actually finish high school and at the same\r\ntime you acquire some sort of a profession or technician, assistant to\r\nengineer or in this case assistant to a pharmacist.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But those were the only schools that she has ever\r\nindicated to you that she attended?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I think so, that is right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did she ever indicate to you the participation\r\nthat she had in the Komsomol.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. She said that she did join it and then she was kicked out or\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did she ever give you any reason why she was\r\nkicked out?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. She told me that one time but I don't--I have forgotten the\r\nreason, I really don't remember.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was it an ordinary thing for a person to be kicked\r\nout of the Komsomol, so far as you know?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; I believe you have to be the sort, if you join it you\r\nhave to perform your duty, you have to go the meetings and be sort of\r\na leader in the community or in school or take on their work so if you\r\ndon't do that, I think they just consider you not being a good young\r\nKomsomol. They wouldn't keep you there.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Marina ever tell you that she did or didn't\r\njoin the Communist Party in the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. She couldn't join it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Why couldn't she join it?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, not from my own experience but from what I know about\r\nit, I think you have to be over 20 years and you have to be 5 years,\r\nyou have a 5-year waiting period until they check your background and\r\nsee if you are good enough person to get by their standards to join the\r\nParty.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Marina ever discuss with you any schools or\r\ntraining programs that Lee participated in while he was in the Soviet\r\nUnion?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No; she never has said anything of that sort. I think she\r\nsaid one time that they wanted to send him to a school which would give\r\nhim a profession but it had nothing to do with military or anything\r\nlike that but somehow he didn't go there. But I have forgotten what he\r\nhad to be so he was just working regular labor in the factory.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You don't recall anything, any details?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I don't recall any details of the school.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You don't recall any of the details of the kind of\r\nschool?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; but it was some sort of a civilian, it had nothing to\r\ndo with military or espionage or anything like that that I remember.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. At the time that Marina and June stayed with you\r\nand your husband in October or November of 1962, did Lee Oswald visit\r\nher at your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No. He did not.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. He called her?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. He called on the telephone.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did anyone else visit her while she was staying at\r\nyour home on this occasion?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. On this occasion, I think the only person who visited was\r\nAnna Ray to whom she was to go later after she stayed with me.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Excuse me, I didn't hear you.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Anna Ray, that is another Russian-born person to whom Marina\r\nwould go from my house, she came to visit her.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The individual who kept Marina after she left you?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right, that is correct.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And his name was what?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Her name.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What is the name?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Anna Ray.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is the only person who visited Marina during\r\nthis period?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. At my house; yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I would like to clarify the time and the\r\ncircumstances of this discussion you had with Marina about the Nixon\r\naffair.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You had gone to Mr. McKenzie's office with Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right. I had gone translating for her; yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You were in Mr. McKenzie's office?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. With Marina. Who else was there?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. And at that time she had a date with the FBI, and we were\r\ndoing, I was translating some legal work for her about dismissing her\r\nold attorney and manager and the FBI called me to come later after we\r\nfinished with that, and they told Marina why they wanted to talk with\r\nher, and McKenzie took us in that other office and he asked Marina\r\nabout that, and told her that that is what she had to talk about, and\r\nshe was really angry. She said the thought Robert had said, I mean she\r\ndid not tell anybody about it, and she didn't want to talk about it,\r\nand now she has to talk about it to the FBI since Robert mentioned it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In this meeting there was Mr. McKenzie?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right. Mr. McKenzie, Marina and I.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Just the three of you?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In a room in Mr. McKenzie's office?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; in one of the rooms in his office.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And Mr. McKenzie said what?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Oh, I think that maybe--frankly, I don't know what he was\r\ntelling her.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was this meeting only about the Nixon affair?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I am very sorry, but I think that during that time when\r\nwe were talking about that it was when he was talking about General\r\nWalker, that he was--it was not about Nixon that they talked about.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This meeting with Mr. McKenzie, when Marina and\r\nyou were discussing matters----\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That was about General Walker.\r\n\r\nI think Mr. McKenzie didn't know what they would talk about but he\r\nadvised her \"They will ask you if there were two guns, you tell them\r\nthere was one gun that was used,\" he told her.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. One gun used where?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. For Walker, I mean the same one they had at the house or\r\nsomething, frankly this is what I had----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I think you just said at the outset of this\r\nmeeting the prime purpose or the principal purpose was to discuss the\r\nWalker affair.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; that is right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How did the Nixon affair come up?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I just can't recollect how.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did McKenzie raise the question or did Marina\r\nraise it?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. How it was raised, I didn't get to discuss it with her about\r\nthe particulars about it, except one time in the car, I don't remember\r\nhow it came up and I was asking well how did that happen, and she was\r\nrather hesitating to talk about it, but she said, \"Well, I locked him\r\nin the bathroom, and he was screaming or something, he was wanting to\r\nget out\", and she tried to talk him out of it and he said, \"if you are\r\ngoing to keep me in here just let me have a book to read\", and I told\r\nher how did he get out later, she said, \"Well, he rather cooled off and\r\nI talked him out of it.\"\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You say this conversation took place in the car?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes; this conversation right now took place in the car but I\r\ndon't know how it got started, I have forgotten.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you say it took place in the car, was it in\r\nthe car going from Mr. McKenzie's to your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right, to my home. She was staying at my place at\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did she talk rather freely about this Nixon----\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. She didn't talk about it freely, I thought she was rather\r\nhesitant about going into particulars.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did she ever indicate why she had not discussed\r\nthis incident with anybody, including the Commission?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, right during that time, just before that, in the\r\noffice, Mr. McKenzie, and I told her before that, \"if you know anything\r\nthat I think that would help either the Commission or the FBI I thought\r\nit my duty to tell them,\" and I told her that if she doesn't want me to\r\nsay to anybody just don't talk to me about it, that is what I told her.\r\n\r\nBut because and maybe that is why she was hesitating to talk to me,\r\nMr. McKenzie told it to her and had a written statement to her, too,\r\nif he feels there is anything he will have to say he will say it in\r\nconnection with the President.\r\n\r\nSo it was said right before that, and I feel maybe that is why she was\r\nhesitating to talk to me.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is all.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mrs. Ford, you are an American citizen now, aren't you?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. How did you acquire it, by marriage to your first soldier\r\nhusband?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. No. I had to apply for it.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Where were you naturalized?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. In Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. In the Federal court?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is correct.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. When was that about?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I have it on my bracelet, so I will give you the correct\r\ntime, I got it in 1952.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. In 1952?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. This I got on \"This is Your Life\". I was on \"This is Your\r\nLife\".\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Chairman, I have one or two more questions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Go right ahead.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I wish you could clarify, if you can, the comment\r\nyou made about Marina mentioning two guns.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. She did not mention two guns ever to me or anything like\r\nthat. But I don't know how or why he advised her to say that at all, I\r\ndon't know, it was not clear to me.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When you say he, was that Mr. McKenzie?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right, because the only reason--the only thing I\r\nremember about Marina was saying that Lee had laughed about the attempt\r\nto kill General Walker, that he said that they were even too stupid\r\nto find out what gun was used to kill him because it was written up a\r\ndifferent type of gun was used other than the one really used by Lee.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Marina said that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right. Lee had commented on that they were not even\r\nsmart enough to identify the gun by a bullet.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When did Marina say Lee said that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Well, soon after he--maybe that evening or the next day but\r\nI mean after he had attempted to shoot the General.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. After he had attempted to shoot General Walker?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. That is right. And the bullet was found in the room and I\r\nsuppose by the bullet they had tried to identify the gun or whatever he\r\nused to shoot him and it was identified wrong.\r\n\r\nIt was not, I don't know what kind of gun he used, frankly, I don't\r\nknow, but he said, he just made a comment, they weren't even smart\r\nenough to identify the gun by the bullet.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Lee said that to Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. To Marina, that is right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Right after the incident?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. Right after the incident, that is correct.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And Marina told Mr. McKenzie that?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I don't know.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You don't know?\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. But I think right after that it was in the papers that\r\na different type of gun was used, and to shoot the President was\r\ndifferent again, there were supposedly two guns, you see, so maybe that\r\nis why he advised her, that he had only one gun. I really don't know\r\nhow this came out.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. That is all. Thank you very much for coming, you have\r\nbeen very helpful.\r\n\r\nMrs. FORD. I hope so. I frankly wish I had questioned her more but I\r\ndidn't feel it was my duty, but I wanted to tell you what she said to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. We will take a short recess.\r\n\r\n(Short recess.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DECLAN P. FORD\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Ford, you were given a copy of this statement were\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. As to the purpose so you understand what we are doing\r\nhere today?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Will you please rise. Do you solemnly swear the testimony\r\nyou give before this Commission will be the truth, the whole truth and\r\nnothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Be seated please and Mr. Liebeler will ask the questions.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Will you state your name, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Declan P. Ford.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Where do you live?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What is your employment?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I am a consulting geologist.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Are you independently employed?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes; I am self-employed.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you give us a brief statement of your educational\r\nbackground?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I was graduated from the University of California at Los\r\nAngeles in 1948, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Geology, and was\r\nfirst employed by Tidewater Associated Oil Co. as a geologist, later\r\nwith the Continental Oil Co. as a geologist, and then later with\r\nDeGollyer McNaughton, a consulting firm in Dallas, Tex., until 1962,\r\nOctober. I went into business for myself as a consulting geologist. All\r\nthis time has been in exploration, development of oil and gas fields\r\nboth in the United States and foreign countries.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Have you been employed in and about the Fort Worth and\r\nDallas area ever since you graduated from college?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; I have only been in the Dallas area since January 1960.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Your wife's name is Katherine Ford?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When were you married?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. We were married July 1960. July 2.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Were you married at any time prior to that?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; I was not.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. '62, did you say?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. 1960.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Are you acquainted with Jack Ruby?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; I am not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know of any connection between Lee Oswald and Jack\r\nRuby?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Directly or indirectly?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know Mr. John M. Grizzaffi?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes; I knew him.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know whether or not he is a friend or associate of\r\nJack Ruby's?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I don't know. I have heard that he knows Jack Ruby, I don't\r\nknow how well he knows him.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know whether Mr. Grizzaffi had any contact with\r\nthe Oswalds or knew them?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. None that I knew of.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When did you first meet the Oswalds?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. In 1962, and I think it was in August of 1962, I am not sure\r\nof the exact date.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you tell us the circumstances of the meeting?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I was a guest at the house of some friends, the Mellers, and\r\nthe Oswalds had been there for lunch, and we came over after lunch to\r\nhave cocktails and to meet Lee and Marina Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Who was there at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Mr. Meller and his wife, Anna Meller, George Bouhe, my wife\r\nand myself, Marina and Lee Oswald, and I can't remember for sure if\r\nanybody else. It seems to me there was somebody else there but I can't\r\nremember who it was. Someone else may have come in later or something\r\nlike that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you mention George Bouhe as being there?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes; George Bouhe was there.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You mentioned him?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Who invited you to that luncheon?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Mrs. Meller.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Had you heard of the Oswalds prior to that time?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes; I had.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. How?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I first heard of them, I think, from either George Bouhe or\r\nmaybe from Max Clark who lives in Fort Worth but I think it was George\r\nBouhe. He had mentioned the name of Lee Oswald and briefly described\r\nhis history, his story of his going to Russia, attempting to give\r\nup his American citizenship, and later returning from Russia with a\r\nRussian wife and child, and living in Fort Worth, and we were, my wife\r\nis Russian and we were interested in meeting her. George Bouhe, I\r\nthink, at the time was attempting to help Lee Oswald find employment.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When you say \"her\" in that sentence you are referring to\r\nMrs. Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes; Marina Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Is that the reason why basically you went to the lunch at\r\nthe Mellers to meet Lee and Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was there any conversation with the Oswalds at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. There was, most of the conversation was in Russian which\r\nI don't understand. I had very little conversation with Lee himself\r\nbecause he spoke Russian most of the time that afternoon and Marina\r\ndidn't speak any English at all.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you have any conversations in English with Oswald\r\nabout living conditions in Russia, about his expenses in Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. A little bit. He showed me pictures of people that he had\r\nworked with in Russia. I believe they were on a picnic together, a\r\ngroup of men, and various other pictures of places he had seen in\r\nMinsk, and he briefly described the living conditions in Russia, I\r\nguess the conditions under which he had lived in Russia, the small room\r\nthey had to live in, and he said something about how much money he made\r\nthere. I don't remember how much it was though.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he tell you what kind of a job he had?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No, he didn't. I think George Bouhe told me he had been a\r\nsheet metal worker or something similar to that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In Minsk?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. In Minsk, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Oswald compare to you the amount of money that he was\r\npaid with the amount of money that other workers in the plant were paid?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; he said nothing about it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he indicate in any way any source of income other\r\nthan from his job?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. None.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. At any time did he do that?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever learn of anything like that?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; I have heard people speak of it but I have never heard\r\nhim or anybody that knew him say he had another source of income.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You have heard people speak of it when, since the\r\nassassination?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Since the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. But you heard nothing of it prior to the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you get any impressions of Oswald at this first\r\nmeeting?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I had an impression that he was not the type of person I\r\ncould make friends with very easily. He didn't impress me as being\r\nfriendly to me as a person. He was kind of closed up within himself.\r\nAnd it seemed to me he preferred to speak in Russian rather than in\r\nEnglish. He wanted to practice speaking Russian with the Russian\r\nspeaking people rather than talking to me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Mrs. Oswald have any bruises on her at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes, she did. On her face.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. On her face. Was there any conversation about that?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Not directly with me. My wife told me that Mrs. Oswald told\r\nher it was due to some accident of running into a door at nighttime\r\nwhile she was getting up to see what--the baby crying, something like\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you accept that explanation?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I didn't--well, really, I didn't accept it. It just didn't\r\nmake much sense but it didn't make an impression one way or the other\r\nto me. I frankly at the time thought of a standard cartoon joke of\r\na kid explaining his black eye, by a kid explaining he ran into a\r\ndoorknob.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was there anything that happened at this first luncheon\r\nthat impressed you about Oswald or his attitude, in any way that you\r\nthink the Commission should know about?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Very little. Except he seemed reserved, and I would call\r\nexcessively polite, and the fact I don't think he made any effort to\r\nmake friends with the other people.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When was the next time that you had any contact with\r\nOswald?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. The next time I saw him was the night I drove Marina from our\r\nhouse to another friend's house, Mr. Frank Ray's house. She had been\r\nstaying at our house for about a week and she had been separated from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI had been out of town and when I came home she was invited to stay\r\nover at Mr. Ray's house and I took her over there, I think it was on a\r\nFriday evening.\r\n\r\nLee Oswald called and wanted to talk to Marina and wanted then to come\r\nout and see her. Mr. Ray told him if he would get on the bus and come\r\nto the bus stop nearest their home that he would pick him up, and I\r\nwent with Mr. Ray to pick up Lee Oswald at the bus stop.\r\n\r\nWe went back to Mr. Ray's home, and had a short conversation with Lee\r\nOswald but he said he wanted to talk to Marina, and he and Marina went\r\ninto another room. I don't know exactly how long it was but we sat\r\ndown and had one or two drinks, and then Lee came back in and said he\r\nand his wife were going to have a reconciliation and she wanted to go\r\nhome with him that evening. Mr. Ray offered to drive them back to their\r\nplace in Oak Cliff, and then I went home.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You were out of town throughout the entire time that\r\nMarina stayed with your wife?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Except for the last night. She stayed there one more night\r\nafter I came home.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you form any impression on Oswald that evening\r\ndifferent from the one that you originally had of him?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Only it confirmed my original thought. I remember one\r\ninstance. Frank asked him where he was working and he would never\r\nidentify the place he was working. He would hedge, I forget his exact\r\nwords, but he mentioned that he was working, I think in a printing\r\nshop, either printing or photographic developing shop, and Mr. Ray\r\nasked him the name of the place, I think, twice, and he avoided\r\nanswering. He would just start talking about something completely\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nIn other words, when he didn't want to answer a question he would\r\neither change the subject or just start talking to somebody else.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You had no independent knowledge of where he was working\r\nat that time?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I didn't know the name. I had heard he was employed in this\r\nshop that I think was a printing and photographic developing shop.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You didn't have anything to do with his getting that job?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No, I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know whether your friend did?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I am not sure. I think either George Bouhe or maybe Theo\r\nMeller may have introduced him to the owner of the shop but I am not\r\nsure about it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you have any conversations with either Mr. Meller or\r\nMr. Bouhe about this?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I have had conversations with them, but it was prior to this\r\nnight when Lee came to make a reconciliation with his wife.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did they tell you that they had anything to do with his\r\ngetting this job?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I don't specifically remember that they said so. I either\r\nassumed this or something they said led me to believe it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you have any conversations with the Rays that evening\r\nwhile you were taking Marina over there about the difficulties that the\r\nOswalds had in their marriage?\r\n\r\nLet's expand the question. Think about that, and also think about any\r\nconversations that you may have had with your wife about that after\r\nyou went back, and tell us the conversations that you had with anybody\r\nat that time about the incidents of the separation, what caused it and\r\nwhat was the trouble between the Oswalds?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I don't believe I had any discussion with either Mr. or Mrs.\r\nRay about specifically the difficulties in their marriage between\r\nMarina and Lee Oswald.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I remember is frankly saying something to the effect,\r\nwell, he is really a screwy nut, or something, he can't find ways to\r\nwork, something to that effect.\r\n\r\nI have not discussed their personal problems. But I have discussed it\r\nwith my wife about it prior to that and after that and also after the\r\nassassination and it was my understanding when she left her husband it\r\nwas because he had beat her up.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did anybody tell you any of the details about why he had\r\ndone that or what the cause of the trouble was?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Not at the time. My wife didn't tell me anything about that.\r\nAgain, after the assassination, she told me more about it, but I don't\r\nknow if Marina had mentioned this prior to the assassination, the year\r\nbefore that when she stayed at our house, or whether she mentioned it\r\nafter the assassination, I don't know the exact time that these details\r\nwere brought out.\r\n\r\nMy wife did mention that perhaps Marina antagonized him by arguing with\r\nhim, talking back to him, or something like that whereas if she just\r\nlearned to be quiet when he said something he might not have hit her.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. But you don't recall whether that was developed during or\r\nat the time or later on?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I don't remember whether she told me that before the\r\nassassination or not. I know we have talked about it since the\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When was the next contact that you had with the Oswalds?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. The next contact was after Christmas 1962. Between Christmas\r\nand New Year's we gave a cocktail party and some friends of ours,\r\nGeorge De Mohrenschildt and his wife were invited and later called my\r\nwife and asked her if it would be all right to bring Lee and Marina to\r\nthe party and my wife said sure, bring them along or might have asked\r\nme if it was all right to bring them along and I said sure. It was\r\nprior to December 28.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Oswald come with De Mohrenschildt?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes, he came with De Mohrenschildt.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you know anything about the relations between Oswald\r\nand the De Mohrenschildts?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I knew they were friends, no more than that. How often they\r\nsaw each other or what they talked about or anything they talked about\r\nI don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. How old are the De Mohrenschildts?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I guess George De Mohrenschildt is between 50 and 55 years\r\nold.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did it seem curious to you that a man that age would be\r\nclose to Lee Oswald who was around 21 or 22 at that particular time?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Not in the particular case.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Why do you say that?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Well, George De Mohrenschildt has a reputation for being\r\na left-wing enthusiast or something, I don't mean a member of the\r\nCommunist Party, but he is, I have heard other people say he has\r\nexpounded the ideals of Marxism and since Lee Oswald was supposedly a\r\nMarxist or a Communist they would agree on their political views.\r\n\r\nAgain, I have never heard George De Mohrenschildt expound on any of\r\nthese ideas. I have met him socially several times and he is very\r\npleasant, a big, good looking man, but other than their agreement on\r\nwhat is the ideal political system, I can't think of anything else they\r\nwould have in common.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Your knowledge of De Mohrenschildt's political views are\r\nhearsay?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. All of it is hearsay.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. How did you learn about Oswald's political views?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Also hearsay, from other people.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Can you tell us who told you about it?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I can't remember anybody, any specific statement from\r\nanybody, but I have discussed it with people like both my wife and\r\nGeorge Bouhe and I don't remember if I discussed it with the Mellers\r\nor not but it seems I have heard this from several different people\r\nabout just about everybody who knew them, the Oswalds, this was one of\r\nthe things that people were leary about in dealing with him was his\r\nreputation for being a Communist.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he have that reputation in the community?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes, I think he had that reputation of either--not being\r\na member, say, of the Communist Party, but his political ideas were\r\neither Marxist or Communist or something he had derived from reading\r\nKarl Marx, I suppose.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know whether he expressed any extreme antagonism\r\nor antagonism of any sort toward the Government of the United States?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. The only occasion I know of was the first time I met him, he\r\ndid blame the U.S. Embassy for delaying his exit, the exit of he and\r\nhis wife from Russia.\r\n\r\nHe did state if it had not been for their delaying the exit visa that\r\nhis daughter would have been born in the United States rather than\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he say anything more about that, do you remember any\r\nmore in detail?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Not that I heard of or can remember.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did he think the birth of his daughter in Russia\r\nrather than in the United States was something important, did it appear\r\nthat way?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I don't know how important he thought it was. It actually\r\nstarted as a joke. We also had a baby born shortly before that and I\r\nsaid, \"Pretty little Russian girl\" or something like that, and he made\r\na statement, \"She is just as much a Texan as your son,\" and then went\r\non to explain that if the U.S. Embassy had acted more quickly that he\r\nand Marina could have left Russia and that June, the daughter, would\r\nhave been born in the United States.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether he placed any great importance on it or not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Oswald ever appear to you to have any kind of a sense\r\nof humor?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. None whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he say anything about the attitude the Russian\r\nauthorities took when he wanted to come back to the United States and\r\nbring his wife back with him?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. He never said anything to me. I think he may have while he\r\nwas talking Russian with these other people. He may have mentioned the\r\nfact that it was easier, they got their visa for he and his wife from\r\nthe Russian authorities, the delay came from the American authorities,\r\nbut I don't specifically know whether it did. He said these things,\r\nagain it would be hearsay, again I would have heard it from my wife or\r\nsomebody else who could speak Russian who had either discussed it with\r\nhim or was present when he was discussing it with somebody else.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever hear Oswald or hear of Oswald making any\r\nremarks that would indicate a hostility toward President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; never did.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What about Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Never heard that either, until after the assassination. I\r\nsaw newspaper copies of a letter he wrote to Governor Connally when\r\nGovernor Connally was Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I would limit my question to before the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Before the assassination, no.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you hear anything about his military career prior to\r\nthe assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; in fact I had assumed prior to the assassination that he\r\nhad had an honorable discharge from the Marine Corps.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You never had any discussions with him about that or\r\nheard anybody discussing it?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. He said something the first time I met him, I can't\r\nspecifically remember what it was, but I got the impression that, at\r\nthat time that he had been a Marine Corps guard at the U.S. Embassy\r\nin Russia and I can't remember whether he said this or somebody else\r\nmentioned it or whether I just assumed it on my own.\r\n\r\nSo I know my first idea was this was the way he had gotten to Russia. I\r\nlater learned he had gone on his own.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. But you don't remember any specific discussion with him\r\nabout this question?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you know where Oswald was living during this period\r\nthat his wife was separated from him and living with you and Mrs.\r\nMeller?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I knew he had an apartment in this Oak Cliff section of\r\nDallas. I don't remember the exact address. I don't know whether he\r\nstayed there while Marina was in our house or not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You had no knowledge where he lived prior to the time\r\nthat he took the apartment in Oak Cliff, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Well, I think he lived in Fort Worth. I am not absolutely\r\nsure. I believe this apartment in Oak Cliff was the first place he\r\nlived in Dallas, but I am not absolutely sure about it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You had never talked to him about it?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; never.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever visit the apartment?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, had we gotten to the Christmas party?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. You asked me about it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Tell us as best as you can recall the events of that\r\nperiod. I think you said there was a party at your house on the 28th of\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Tell me if there were parties or get-togethers at which\r\nyou were present or of which you knew at other homes during that period.\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Well, there were, but I don't remember the specific dates\r\nthat they were. I think they were after the party at our house. There\r\nwas a party at George Bouhe's home, an apartment, during that period. I\r\nthink it was a few days after that, right in the period of New Year's\r\nEve, and I went to several celebrations.\r\n\r\nI would hate to try to recall exactly when each one of them was and who\r\nwas there.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember going to George Bouhe's apartment?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes; I remember going there but I don't remember the exact\r\ndate that it was.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was Oswald at that meeting?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; he was not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was there any discussion of Oswald at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Not that I can remember.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Were there any other parties that you attended during\r\nthat period?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I don't remember any formal parties. I stopped and had drinks\r\nwith a lot of people.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Specifically, was there a get-together at your home the\r\nnight after the party that you had on the 28th of December?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Not a formal party, just a group of people happened to show\r\nup and we started another party.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Who was there?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan, friends of ours from New Orleans, and\r\nMr. and Mrs. Harris who were from Georgetown, Tex., and another Mr. and\r\nMrs. Ray, not the ones who live in Dallas, but these live in Paris, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would that be Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Ray?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Thomas Ray.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Thomas Ray. And yourself and your wife?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Anybody else?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Right now I can't remember anybody else who came in. It was\r\nnot a formal gathering, just people happened to stop in and we started\r\nhaving a party.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you have any recollection of any discussion of Oswald\r\nat that time?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember at any time having any discussion with\r\nany of your Russian friends on the question of whether or not Oswald\r\nwas a Russian agent?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Prior to the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; I don't remember prior to the assassination. There may\r\nhave been some but I don't remember any.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. At the party at your home on the 28th of December, did\r\nyou have any conversation with Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Said \"hello, how are you,\" to he and Marina, and after that,\r\nI can't remember Oswald talking to anybody there except one guest, a\r\nJapanese girl, Yaeko, I forget her last name; my wife will remember.\r\n\r\nAs nearly as I can remember she was the only person in the whole party\r\nthat he ever bothered to talk to.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember whether Oswald was drinking that evening?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I fixed one drink for him, in a little liqueur glass full of\r\nliqueur. As far as I remember he never touched it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever observe Oswald smoking?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you don't remember any discussion about Oswald after\r\nhe left that evening?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; after he left that evening, I don't recall any discussion\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever have any conversations with De Mohrenschildt\r\nabout Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I don't remember any specific conversations with George De\r\nMohrenschildt. I may have.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What was your impression of Oswald at this time as far\r\nas his relations with the other members of the Russian community were\r\nconcerned, and generally?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. My impression was that he didn't want his wife to associate\r\nwith them, and that he resented any aid or help people tried to give\r\neither he or his wife. I might say, I know, I have heard other Russian\r\npeople there, for example, would take Marina to a grocery store and\r\nbuy a load of groceries for her and take her back, and one girl that\r\nwent by and found the baby had a fever and nobody was taking it to the\r\nhospital and she took Marina and the baby to the hospital for some\r\nmedical treatment for it, and I had the impression that Lee Oswald\r\nresented this.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You gained that impression from conversations that you\r\nhad?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. From conversations with other people, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Is there any----\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I was also going to say----\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Pardon me.\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I think during the period of 1962 that George Bouhe, for\r\nexample, thought it would be helpful for Marina to learn English and he\r\ntried to encourage her to learn English and I had heard later that Lee\r\nOswald resented this, he didn't want her to learn English.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When did you hear that?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. That was back in 1962. I can't remember the specific time,\r\nbut----\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you have any conversation with Mr. and Mrs. Harris at\r\nthe party at your place on the 28th of December?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Oh, yes; I had conversations with them.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you hear of an incident where Mrs. Harris was trying\r\nto teach English to Marina at the party and certain American customs\r\nand Oswald objected to it?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I didn't observe it. She may have tried to teach her some\r\nAmerican customs. I don't remember hearing Oswald say anything about\r\nit, Lee Oswald say anything about it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Mrs. Harris say anything about it to you?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Not that I can remember.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. So you have no knowledge of that incident if it occurred\r\nat all?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No. It seems to me I have heard somebody else mention this\r\nbut I did not see it or hear anything myself.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, after the party on the 28th of December that was\r\nheld at your house, when was the next contact that you had with either\r\none of the Oswalds?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Well, I heard a few times or my wife had heard something\r\nabout Marina living in Irving, but never actually saw either one of\r\nthem until after the assassination. Then the first contact we had with\r\nMarina was, I believe, my wife tried to get in touch with her, either\r\ninvite her to come to my house or to tell her that once things had been\r\ncleared up, the investigation had been cleared up, to feel free to come\r\nby, and let her know she still had friends.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did anybody suggest to you shortly after the\r\nassassination that Marina should come and live with you?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever express any hesitancy to anyone in\r\nconnection with any suggestion that Marina should come and live with\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I don't remember ever expressing it. If somebody had\r\nmentioned it the afternoon or next day after the assassination I\r\nprobably would have been a little bit hesitant about it. But I don't\r\nremember saying anything to anybody.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did there come a time when Marina moved into your home\r\nafter the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes; but this was in February of this year.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you express any hesitancy at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you don't recall expressing any immediately after the\r\nassassination or before?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No. I don't remember talking to anybody at all about it. I\r\nmean the first few days immediately after the assassination, I don't\r\nrecall saying anything to anybody about it, where she was going to live\r\nat my house or anybody else's.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever have any conversations with Mr. Jim Martin\r\non that subject?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now prior to the time that Marina came to live in your\r\nhome, your wife has testified she talked to Marina on the telephone\r\nseveral times and that Marina came to visit on two or three occasions,\r\ntwo occasions, I believe, at your home.\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you talk to your wife about what Marina had said\r\nduring your wife's visits with Marina?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. When she came to visit us in our home?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I talked to her about what she had talked to Marina, and I\r\ncouldn't carry on much of a conversation with Marina myself because she\r\ndidn't speak much English but I would ask my wife, and my wife would\r\ntell me what she had said.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember whether there was any discussion about\r\nMarina's testimony before this Commission, either before she went to\r\nWashington or after she came back?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; not--my wife never told me before she came to Washington\r\nto testify before the Commission. After she came back, I did overhear\r\nsome conversation between Marina, my wife, and Mr. William M. McKenzie\r\nregarding the testimony given to the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Can you tell us what that was to the best of your\r\nrecollection?\r\n\r\nLet me ask you this: Where did this occur?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I think it was in Mr. McKenzie's office, it may have been\r\neither in his office or my home but I think it was in his office, and I\r\nbelieve the FBI had been questioning her this afternoon, I am not sure\r\nof the date, and I came back later to pick up my wife and Marina and in\r\nmy presence Mr. McKenzie asked my wife to ask Marina in Russian if she\r\nhad told the Commission this Nixon story. I don't know the details of\r\nthe story, but something regarding the threat to Mr. Nixon.\r\n\r\nAnd I think Marina, again through my wife, told Mr. McKenzie that she\r\nhad not mentioned this to the Commission. But that she had mentioned it\r\nto the FBI, and she had mentioned it, I believe to the FBI prior to the\r\nCommission hearing.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Who told you that?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Well, I was standing there while Mr. McKenzie was talking to\r\nMarina using my wife as a translator.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was this in your home, did you say?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I think it was in Mr. McKenzie's office; it might have been\r\nin my home. Several times I have overheard conversation either in Mr.\r\nMcKenzie's office or at my home.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It could have been in either?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. It could have been either, but it seems to me it was at\r\nhis office. I think as Marina said, she had not said anything to the\r\nCommission about this, and then I think Mr. McKenzie asked her why\r\nnot, and she said well she hadn't thought of it or nobody asked her;\r\nsomething to that effect.\r\n\r\nI think he was trying to establish whether or not she had purposely\r\nwithheld information from the Commission and she said no.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever hear Marina Oswald make any remark to the\r\neffect when she was before the Commission she just answered questions\r\nand did not volunteer anything?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I never heard her say that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did anybody ever translate that, a remark like that, so\r\nthat you heard it when it was translated?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; I never heard anybody translate for Marina and say that;\r\nno.\r\n\r\nIn my presence, I never heard her say that and have it translated by\r\nanybody.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever hear from anybody else that she had said\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Not until yesterday when I was talking about it with you,\r\nthat I can remember anything.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And yesterday when we talked about it, I asked you the\r\nquestion, had anybody said that, isn't that right?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you obtain any information concerning the Nixon,\r\nany detailed information concerning the Nixon affair as a result of\r\ndetailed conversations with your wife after she had had conversations\r\nwith Marina? I am assuming Marina would speak in Russian to your wife.\r\nDid your wife ever tell you what Marina had ever said to her about the\r\nNixon affair?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. A little bit, not all the details. But something to the\r\neffect that Lee Oswald was threatening, I don't know whether to shoot\r\nNixon, and in some way she had locked him in a bathroom and kept him\r\nthere, I think all day. He had calmed down or cooled off and wasn't\r\ngoing to do anything. Just how she managed to do this, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you discuss the question with your wife as to how?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; not--again, I never discussed it until yesterday, last\r\nnight. I was talking to her and wondered how the devil she managed to\r\nlock him in the bathroom.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you discussed that with your wife last night as a\r\nresult of a similar question that I asked you yesterday afternoon when\r\nwe were reviewing the testimony?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you learn anything relating to the Walker affair as a\r\nresult of conversations with your wife?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Well, I had read about it in the newspapers; I had read\r\nstories that Lee Oswald had told Marina that he had taken a shot at\r\nGeneral Walker and my wife did tell me later on she asked Marina if\r\nthis were true and I think Marina said this was true, that Lee Oswald\r\nhad told Marina he was the one who had taken a shot at General Walker.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Is that the extent of your conversations about the Walker\r\nincident?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; she mentioned something else that my wife told me about.\r\nThat after Lee had taken a shot at General Walker, he had hidden\r\nthe gun somewhere and went back the next day or a few days later\r\nand recovered the gun. And that Lee was reading the reports in the\r\nnewspaper and made some statement, \"Well, how stupid can the police\r\nbe,\" something to this effect. In other words, expressing the idea\r\nthat the police were unable to find out what happened in the Walker\r\nincident. And then also Marina had said at one time, I believe the day\r\nafter the shooting of Walker or attempted shooting of Walker, George De\r\nMohrenschildt had come into the house and made some statement to them\r\nregarding it. I can't remember the exact words but it was referring to\r\nit, Walker, somebody shooting at General Walker, and asking Lee how he\r\ncould miss and she was surprised that De Mohrenschildt knew about it\r\nand Marina thought Lee had told George De Mohrenschildt about it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever learn how George De Mohrenschildt had\r\nlearned about it?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; I imagine he was surprised that Lee had done the shooting\r\nand to him it would have been a good joke.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember anything else about the Walker incident\r\nthat you and your wife may have talked about?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes; we have discussed it some after, I believe, Marina came\r\nto stay with us, and I expressed the doubt that Lee Oswald was the one\r\nwho took a shot at Walker.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you have any basis for expressing that doubt?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. The only basis for it was that there was a story in one of\r\nthe newspapers that they could not identify the bullet taken out of the\r\nwood in Walker's home as having come from a gun that Lee Oswald owned,\r\nit was too badly destroyed and they couldn't be sure it was the gun,\r\nthe same gun, that shot the bullets at President Kennedy and Governor\r\nConnally.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. So on the basis of that newspaper story you expressed\r\ndoubts as to whether Oswald was actually involved in the Walker\r\nincident?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Well, I expressed the doubt. It was possible that he really\r\nwasn't the one who took a shot at General Walker but just claimed he\r\ndid and this to me would not be surprising.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Why do you say that?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Well, I think, my opinion of Lee Oswald is that he would do\r\nanything to gain attention for himself, draw attention to himself, make\r\nnot necessarily a hero out of himself but just a well-known person. He\r\nwanted attention. He wanted to be a big shot.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you think in an attempt to do that he might claim he\r\nhad been the one who shot at Walker where, in fact, he was not the one\r\nat all?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. It is possible, I think it is possible.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you have any conversations with your wife in which\r\nyour wife told you anything that Marina said about the details of the\r\nassassination, about Lee's coming home to Irving and his leaving for\r\nDallas the next morning?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Well, we talked about it; I don't recall all the details of\r\nwhat my wife told me, whether they were my wife's opinions or things\r\nshe had heard directly from Marina.\r\n\r\nApparently Marina was surprised that he would come home in the\r\nmiddle of the week rather than on weekends or come to visit her,\r\nand I gathered that Marina had thought of these things after the\r\nassassination, as she tried to figure things out. Well this increased\r\nher belief that Lee Oswald was the man who assassinated the President,\r\nbecause he did so many strange things that week, I mean that day\r\nbefore, not the week, the day before the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. To your knowledge, has Marina expressed any feeling about\r\nOswald's guilt while she lived with you or while you were acquainted\r\nwith her after the assassination, other than the fact he was guilty?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; so far as I know she just accepts the fact he was guilty.\r\nHe was the man who shot the President. And she believes this is true.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever discuss this question with Robert Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No, not specifically, I didn't. I never asked Robert Oswald\r\nif he believed that his brother shot the President.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Oswald ever indicate to you that he did not believe\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Not directly. The only thing that might have indicated it\r\nwas when Life published a picture of Lee Oswald on the front cover and\r\nI read a newspaper article which stated that Mrs. Marguerite Oswald\r\nwas intending to sue Life Magazine and I wondered why, was the picture\r\nfaked, and Robert Oswald said no it was a true picture of Lee Oswald\r\nbut the title of the picture, that is what he was upset about, and I\r\nthink the title was Lee Oswald holding the gun he either used to shoot\r\nor used to kill the President, and I didn't pursue the subject further\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nI don't know specifically what he was upset about, if he thought his\r\nbrother did shoot the President. There was nothing wrong with the\r\nstatement except he may not have liked it in print.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. That was the only statement Robert Oswald made to you\r\nabout the subject.\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. But he never said he didn't believe his brother did it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you have any other reasons for thinking that Oswald is\r\nthe kind of person who would claim to do something that he hadn't done\r\njust to get attention drawn to him?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Well, yes; I think he was erratic enough in his behavior\r\nthroughout his whole life to indicate that. Of course, I have read a\r\nlot about his life since the assassination, so it is not all opinion I\r\nformed prior to the assassination.\r\n\r\nIt is hard for me to distinguish which things I thought before the\r\nassassination from those I have thought about since the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In that respect let me ask you this question: Were\r\nyou surprised when you heard that Oswald had been charged with the\r\nassassination?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes, I was.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you think on the basis of your knowledge of him\r\nbefore the assassination that he would have been capable of such a\r\nthing?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; I wouldn't have thought so prior to the assassination and\r\nwhen I first heard he was picked up, I first thought, well, as I said\r\nto my wife, \"This nut has gone down and got himself mixed up just to\r\nget some publicity.\"\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You said that to your wife?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes; that was my first opinion. When I heard that Lee Oswald\r\nwas the man arrested, and I said I think I said, \"This idiot has got\r\nhimself arrested and got himself mixed up to get some publicity\".\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What made you say that?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Again, I considered him to be erratic and unpredictable, I\r\ndon't know how to explain the things that he would do.\r\n\r\nFor example, he had gone to Russia and he didn't like it there, he had\r\ngone back to Fort Worth and he didn't like it there. He didn't seem to\r\nlike any place that he was, he didn't seem to make lasting friendships\r\nwith anybody. And he would hop from one job to another, and move from\r\none town to another. He never seemed to be satisfied and I considered\r\nhis whole behavior rather erratic, and I suppose the main reason was,\r\nI felt that he had no desire to support, and I felt this prior to the\r\nassassination, he had no desire to support his wife and child, and he\r\nwanted and would be quite willing to sponge off anybody to get their\r\nsupport, and this was my primary reason for not wanting to associate\r\nwith him rather than any political feelings he had.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. How did these things lead you to think that he was not\r\ncapable of doing the assassination or that he just went there to get\r\ninvolved?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Prior to the assassination I never even considered the\r\npossibility of his killing a man but if somebody had asked me prior to\r\nthe assassination, I would have answered no, I don't think he would\r\nkill anybody. But I don't think I really even considered it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You would have----\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. When the President was assassinated.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you would have based that response on the things you\r\nmentioned already.\r\n\r\nIs there anything else you would have based that reason on?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Well, it is difficult to say. My general opinion of the\r\nman was that he was strange and he did a lot of things I couldn't\r\nunderstand but I had no reason to think he would attack a person with\r\nthe intent to kill him.\r\n\r\nAs far as I knew there was nothing he had ever done before that that\r\nwould indicate he would ever kill anybody. I don't know how you tell\r\nahead of time whether a man can commit murder. I was never worried\r\nabout him going out and killing somebody: say I would have never said\r\nprior to the assassination that you have got to watch out for this guy,\r\nhe is dangerous. He didn't impress me that way.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You had information prior to the assassination that he\r\nhad beaten his wife, did you not?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And did you take that information, would you take that,\r\ninto consideration in the judgment that you just expressed?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; I don't think so. I think man and wife can fight over\r\na lot of things and it isn't necessary that either one of them would\r\nintend to kill somebody. He might become violent toward his wife, who\r\nis a much smaller and weaker person but he never impressed me as the\r\ntype of person who would violently attack another man, for example.\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. When did you first hear that Lee Oswald was held by the\r\nauthorities?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. It was the afternoon of the assassination, I heard on the\r\nradio.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What was your reaction then?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Just what I said, my first reaction, \"This idiot has gone\r\ndown to get himself some attention and confuse the whole issue.\"\r\n\r\nAt that time I didn't know he was working in the School Book Depository\r\nBuilding.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What did you do subsequent to hearing this radio\r\nbroadcast?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Let's see; I heard it in a hardware store and I went and\r\npicked up my wife who was shopping at the grocery store, picked her up,\r\nand told her what I had heard and we went home. I didn't do anything\r\nspecifically that I can think of. I did not mention it to anybody.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you and your wife on the way home from this shopping\r\ntrip discuss the apprehension of Lee Oswald and his implication in the\r\naffair?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Well, I told her the police had picked him up, and that he\r\nwas apparently being held both for the assassination of the President\r\nand for shooting a police officer, and my wife was a little bit worried\r\nthen, I think, about the people's reaction to the children, and she\r\nsaid, well, \"Don't mention it in front of the children.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time we got home, I believe Linda, my stepdaughter, had already\r\ntalked on the phone to Mrs. Anna Ray, who had also heard the radio\r\nbroadcast and called up to ask if my wife had heard it, and, of course,\r\nby then it was too late, they knew who Lee Oswald was, they read who he\r\nwas, that Marina stayed at our house.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Then if I understand it you and your wife voluntarily\r\nwent down to police headquarters?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Well, the next Sunday.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Two days later?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes; the assassination was on a Friday afternoon. On Sunday\r\nmorning, Mr. Frank Ray called me and said he heard on the radio that\r\nthe FBI had requested anybody who knew Lee Oswald to please contact\r\nthem, and he asked me what I was going to do, I said, \"Well, I don't\r\nknow, I will call an attorney and see what he suggests.\" I called Max\r\nClark at Fort Worth and he was out, so I called my sister out in Los\r\nAngeles. She is an attorney and married to one, and I said, \"Who are\r\nyou supposed to contact if you know information about Lee Oswald,\" and\r\nshe said she assumed it would be the FBI, so I then called the FBI\r\noffice and made an appointment to talk to an agent and we made the\r\nappointment to talk in the FBI office in downtown Dallas. While we were\r\ndriving downtown I stopped to get some gas and the attendant told me\r\nthat somebody had just shot Lee Oswald and it was right about that time\r\nthat I went down to talk with the FBI.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In this interval between your first reaction and your\r\ngoing to the interview with the FBI, did you and your wife discuss any\r\nfurther the Oswald implications?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I am sure we discussed it, but I can't remember exactly what\r\nwe said to each other about it.\r\n\r\nI think she was worried at first that her children would suffer some\r\nprejudice from other people.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Marina's children?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; our children. And, of course, also that Marina was and\r\nher two children, my wife felt, would be sort of considered persona\r\nnon grata in this country from then on, but I didn't consider this\r\nwould happen as long as she was not implicated in a plot to kill the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nI know we discussed it but I just can't remember specifically what we\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Mr. Ford, did you at any time learn of any desire on\r\nOswald's part to return to Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes; after the assassination I did.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. How did you learn that?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Well, partly from discussing it, I heard it through friends\r\nand then later when Marina talked to my wife, I don't remember if this\r\nwas during the time she visited us during January or after she moved\r\nin, but she did tell the story to my wife of his desire, as expressing\r\na desire, to return to Russia, and I am a little confused as to what\r\nthe story was.\r\n\r\nAs nearly as I could make out he had told her he wanted to go back to\r\nRussia first and then later said, no, he was going--couldn't get a visa\r\nto Russia and he was going to try to get a visa and go through Cuba and\r\nthen go to Russia, and then I think he changed his mind again and said\r\nhe was going to ask for a visa to Cuba, using it as an excuse with the\r\nidea of going to Russia and then stay in Cuba, and somewhere in there\r\nI got the idea that Marina was not willing to go. He wanted Marina\r\nto return to Russia and I had the impression this was just a--but I\r\ncouldn't even give you the details of her various statements which led\r\nme to the conclusions--as nearly as I could figure out, this was the\r\nstory she had told my wife and she told me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you learn at any time through your wife or otherwise\r\nthat Marina Oswald at one point had contemplated committing suicide?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Tell us about that?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Well, the first time I heard it was yesterday.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. During our conversations?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. During our conversations, yesterday.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And your wife explained to us in our conversations\r\nyesterday that she, Marina Oswald, had told her at onetime contemplated\r\ncommitting suicide?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. That was the extent of our conversations yesterday?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes, sir. That is right. I think my wife said Marina felt so\r\ndesolate and downhearted that she felt that was the only way out at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Are you finished?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you have any other information or knowledge that\r\nyou think the Commission should know about in connection with these\r\nmatters that we haven't already asked you about?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. There is nothing I can think of offhand.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In our conversations yesterday you and your wife and I\r\ndiscussed your testimony today. Have we covered those matters here in\r\nthe testimony and have there been any inconsistencies between what we\r\ndiscussed yesterday and what we have discussed today on the record that\r\nyou can think of?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No; I can't think of any inconsistencies. I assume we have\r\ncovered everything we discussed yesterday. I can't remember everything\r\nwe discussed yesterday, so I am just assuming we covered it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I have no more questions then.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Have you anything further, Congressman Ford?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Ford, you drove Marina Oswald from your home\r\nto the Ray home?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In October or November of 1962?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. It was in November.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It was November of 1962. How long a drive is that?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. It is about 15 minutes. I guess it couldn't be over 7 or 8\r\nmiles, 6, 7, 8 miles, something like that.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did you have any conversation with her at that\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No. She couldn't speak but about a half dozen words of\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. So there was no real conversation between the two\r\nof you?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is all.\r\n\r\nMr. MURRAY. Mr. Chief Justice, may I confer briefly with counsel?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Where were you born?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Did you go to the public schools there?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I attended both parochial and public schools in Los Angeles\r\nand Glendale.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Then you went to the University of California at Los\r\nAngeles?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Right.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Where did you go after that. You were in the service, did\r\nyou say?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I was in the service. After I got out of the service I went\r\nback to UCLA and finished my education and then went to work in the oil\r\nindustry first in Bakersfield and in Los Angeles, Ventura, and then\r\nwent to work for DeGollyer and McNaughton overseas.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. I see.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How old are you, Mr. Ford?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Forty-one.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Mr. Ford, were you at any time present in Mr. McKenzie's\r\noffice, William McKenzie, when there was a discussion with Marina\r\nOswald concerning guns and the gun that was used to or presumably used\r\nto attack Walker and the gun that was subsequently presumably used to\r\nattack the President?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I don't remember any discussion. I have been in his office\r\nseveral times when he was discussing things with Marina, but I don't\r\nremember him ever asking about this gun or discussing this gun.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you hear McKenzie at anytime advise Marina if she\r\nwere asked about these guns she should say there was only one gun?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. I think I did hear him say that once or something to that\r\neffect but I don't remember specifically the words.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Can you recall----\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. But I don't think it was any discussion about the gun used in\r\nshooting General Walker.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Tell us about it.\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. As nearly as I can remember it, the whole discussion was, he\r\nwas telling her, he had asked her if there was anything else but this\r\none rifle and she said no, and he said \"be sure you always say that\r\nthere was just this one gun,\" but I thought he was referring to the gun\r\nused only in the case of the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. He asked her about this before he advised her?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. Apparently this was after she had been interrogated by the\r\nFBI and I don't know--I just had the impression they were talking about\r\nthe possibility that more than one gun was used in the assassination of\r\nPresident Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Is that the best you can recall about that conversation?\r\n\r\nMr. FORD. The best I can recall, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. That is all.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Ford. I appreciate your coming\r\nhere with your wife. You have been very helpful.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Let's call Mr. Gregory.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF PETER PAUL GREGORY\r\n\r\nMr. Gregory, you were given a copy of a statement of the reason for our\r\nmeeting today, were you not?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Then I will read it to you. This is customary----\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. We read a statement to the witness.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this hearing is to take the testimony of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nDeclan P. Ford, and Mr. Peter Paul Gregory. The Commission has been\r\nadvised that Mr. and Mrs. Ford made the acquaintance of the Oswalds\r\nshortly after their arrival in the United States in June of 1962,\r\nand that Mrs. Marina Oswald lived in the Ford home on two different\r\noccasions, in November 1962, and for a period following February 12,\r\n1964.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has also been advised that Mr. Gregory was contacted by\r\nMr. Lee Harvey Oswald shortly after Mr. Oswald's return from Russia\r\nas a result of which Mr. and Mrs. Oswald made the acquaintances of a\r\nlarge number of Russian speaking people in the Dallas and Fort Worth\r\narea. Since the Commission is inquiring fully into the background\r\nand possible motive of Lee Harvey Oswald, the alleged assassin, it\r\nintends to ask the above witnesses questions concerning Mr. Oswald,\r\nhis associations and relations with others, and any and all matters\r\nrelating to the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Will you raise your right hand and be sworn, please, Mr.\r\nGregory.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before this\r\nCommission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You may be seated.\r\n\r\nMr. Liebeler will ask the questions of you.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you state your name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. My name is Peter Paul Gregory.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And will you tell us where you were born?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I was born in Chita, Siberia.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you tell us briefly how you came to the United\r\nStates?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nI came to the United States on or about August 1, 1923. I landed in San\r\nFrancisco; came from Japan where I lived for 2 years prior to that. And\r\nmy purpose was, of course, to come as an immigrant and to attend the\r\nUniversity of California.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you attend the University of California?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, sir; I enrolled at the University in 1923 and I\r\nstayed out of the University for a couple of years but I graduated in\r\n1929 as a petroleum engineer at Berkeley.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What educational background did you have in Russia or\r\nJapan before you came to the United States?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I started my primary education in Russia, in 1912, and my\r\neducation was interrupted by civil war in 1919. I finished high school\r\nor the equivalent of high school in Tokyo, Japan, where I attended the\r\nAmerican school in Japan.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Where did you learn to speak English?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I learned it in Japan.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Were you personally involved in the civil war in Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Not personally, no. I was too young; I was only 16, 17 at\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Were any of your relatives involved in that?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. My older brother was an officer in the White Russian Army.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you presently reside in Fort Worth?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, sir. I have been residing in Fort Worth for the past\r\n20 years, and prior to that in the oilfields in the western part of\r\nTexas for 15 years, and prior to that I resided in California from 1923\r\nto 1929.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You are presently self-employed in Fort Worth, is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I am presently chairman of the Yates Pool Engineering\r\nCommittee which is a group of engineers supervising activities in\r\nthe Yates oilfield in Pecos County, Tex., and I am also a consulting\r\npetroleum engineer.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you are fluent in the Russian language, are you?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I am, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In fact, you teach Russian at the Fort Worth Public\r\nLibrary, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, I do; as a civic enterprise. I teach Russian once a\r\nweek from 10 to 20 weeks a year.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Approximately how long have you been doing that, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. For about 3 or 4 years.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you tell us about your first contact with Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nIt was in the middle of June 1962. On that particular morning, I was in\r\nthe office, my telephone rang, and the voice on the other end told me\r\nthat my name was given to him by the Fort Worth Public Library. He knew\r\nI was teaching Russian at the library, that he was looking for a job\r\nas a translator or interpreter in the Russian and English languages,\r\nand that he would like for me to give him a letter testifying to that\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to me in English, so I suggested to him, not knowing who that\r\nwas, that he might drop by my office and I would be glad to give him a\r\ntest. He did. He came by the office, about 11 o'clock that morning, and\r\nI gave him a short test by simply opening a book at random and asking\r\nhim to read a paragraph or two and then translate it.\r\n\r\nHe did it very well. So I gave him a letter addressed to whom it may\r\nconcern that in my opinion he was capable of being an interpreter or a\r\ntranslator.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What happened after you gave Mr. Oswald--this individual\r\nwas Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, sir; that individual was Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nAfter that, I asked him--I noticed that he spoke with what I thought\r\nto be a Polish accent, so I asked him if he were of Polish origin, and\r\nhe stated that he was not, that he was raised in Fort Worth, Tex., but\r\nthat he learned Russian in the Soviet Union where he lived for 2-1/2 or\r\n3 years.\r\n\r\nHe also told me that he married a Russian girl, and that he brought\r\nhis wife with him, and that they also had a baby. I told him that I\r\nknew of no openings at the time--I didn't know of any--for services of\r\na translator or interpreter, but that if he would leave his address I\r\nwould be glad to get in touch with him if and when I learned of any\r\nsuch openings.\r\n\r\nHe gave me his address. He lived with his brother at that time at the\r\nwestern edge of Fort Worth.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever send him any work as a translator or\r\ninterpreter?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you and Mr. Oswald have lunch together that day.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, sir. It was about noontime when I gave him that test,\r\nso I invited him to lunch, and during the lunch being naturally curious\r\nabout the present day life in the Soviet Union, I was asking him\r\nquestions, asked how people lived there, and so forth.\r\n\r\nHe told me that he was employed in a factory in Minsk as a sheet-metal\r\nworker. He told me a little bit about the working conditions and living\r\nconditions in that country.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he tell you how he was paid as a worker?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes; I think I asked him what he was paid and my\r\nrecollection is that he told me he was getting about 80 rubles a month.\r\nI may be wrong about that but that is my recollection.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he compare his salary with the salary of other\r\nworkers in Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Other workers in the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No, he did not. By way of comparison. I was curious as to\r\nwhat the purchasing power of his earnings would be, I asked him what 80\r\nrubles would buy, and I think he mentioned, as I say, a pair of shoes\r\ncost around 15 rubles.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he indicate to you that he had any source of income\r\nother than his job at the factory?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No, sir; he did not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he tell you anything about why he went to Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. The only statement he made that I remember, he said, \"I\r\nwent to the Soviet Union on my own,\" but I did not feel like prying\r\ninto his affairs. I did not press the question.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you notice anything about the way he was dressed or\r\nanything else about him that would seem strange to you?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes; it was a very hot morning. You know in Texas in the\r\nmiddle of June, it is generally hot. I remember that he wore a flannel,\r\nwoolen coat, suit, and atrocious looking shoes that were made in Russia.\r\n\r\nI know he was very uncomfortable because he was too warmly dressed for\r\nthat time of the year.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Mr. Oswald tell you anything else at that time about\r\nconditions in the Soviet Union or his attempt to come back to the\r\nUnited States or bringing his wife back that you can recall?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I don't recall of anything outstanding that he told me.\r\nBut I think he did tell me that they, he and his wife, left Moscow by\r\ntrain, and they went through East Germany to Berlin, I believe, and\r\nthat their destination was Amsterdam, I believe, where they took a ship\r\nto come to New York.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he express anything about any difficulties that he\r\nmight have had in returning to the United States?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No, sir; not to my recollection.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did it seem extraordinary to you that his wife was able\r\nto leave the Soviet Union with him or didn't you think about that?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I thought at the time it was more than extraordinary.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Why do you say that?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Because simply from reading accounts of the difficulties\r\nexperienced by so many Americans who married Russian girls in the\r\nSoviet Union, and all the difficulties they had to secure permits from\r\nthe Soviet Government for an exit visa for their wives.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you discuss that with Mr. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When was the next time you saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. The next time was a few days later, and the occasion was\r\nthis, to the best of my recollection. My youngest son Paul, who at\r\nthe time was a junior at the University of Oklahoma, Paul majoring in\r\neconomics and also studying the Russian and the German languages, Paul\r\nexpressed a wish to meet Marina Oswald simply because she was fresh\r\nfrom the country, Russia; that presumably her language was pure Russian\r\nlanguage as compared to mine which became, shall we say, affected by\r\nmy 40 years living in the United States, is not pure Russian any more\r\nprobably, in fact, he thought that maybe he could take lessons of the\r\nRussian language from Marina Oswald.\r\n\r\nSo, I arranged; I called Lee Oswald at his brother's residence, and\r\nasked if it would be, if they would be, at home, that my son and I\r\nwould come out to visit them, and we did. I don't remember the date but\r\nit must have been within possibly within 10 days, the first 10 days\r\nafter his initial contact with me at the office.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Let us try to set the date of your initial contact. I\r\nhave here a copy, not a confirmed copy, but just a typewritten copy of\r\na letter entitled \"To Whom it May Concern.\" I show it to you and ask\r\nyou if that is the letter to the best of your recollection that you\r\ngave to Mr. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I think that is a copy of the letter I gave. That was on\r\nJune 19, 1962.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I ask that it be admitted in evidence and marked as the\r\nnext exhibit.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be marked.\r\n\r\nIt will be marked as Exhibit 384.\r\n\r\nVery well, it is admitted as Exhibit 384.\r\n\r\n(The letter referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 384 for\r\nidentification and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I would hazard a guess that the second contact with Lee\r\nOswald that I just referred to was made, say, around the 25th, toward\r\nthe end of June 1962.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you went to see him at his brother's house?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. At his brother Robert's, Robert Oswald's house. Paul and I\r\nspent there perhaps an hour, speaking Russian with Marina, and mostly\r\nwith Marina. They showed some pictures, snapshots of their friends, of\r\nthemselves, taken in Minsk. We talked about the living conditions, just\r\nin a very general way.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you discuss politics with Mr. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No, sir; we did not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you discuss politics with him at any time?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Not with Lee Oswald, no.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you get the impression from just talking to the\r\nOswalds at this time that Oswald was treated pretty much as other\r\nRussians were in Russia or did you think he had a special situation\r\nthere in any way?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. My personal impression was that he was treated there as\r\nthe rest of the Russians.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did your son subsequently have additional contacts with\r\nthe Oswalds?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes. He and I made arrangements for Marina Oswald to give\r\nhim lessons, conversational lessons, I believe it was twice a week, and\r\nPaul paid her for these lessons. I don't remember the exact amount,\r\nwhether it came under the minimum or not, it was around a dollar and\r\na half an hour. And he took those lessons after he made a visit to\r\nhis aunt in San Francisco in July of 1962. So, I would say that he\r\ntook lessons from Marina Oswald, say, from approximately August 1 to\r\nSeptember 15 when he went back to the university of Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember when the last contact was that your son\r\nhad with the Oswalds?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. To the best of my knowledge his last contact with them was\r\nthe Thanksgiving Day of 1962.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did your son tell you whether he had discussions with\r\nOswald concerning politics and economics and things like that?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. He mentioned once, I believe, that there were political\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What did he tell you about that?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. He told me that he thought Lee Oswald was pretty silly in\r\nhis views.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Pretty silly?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Silly.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Silly.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he express any other----\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. He also mentioned that he saw some book on Marxism,\r\nwhether it was Das Kapital or some other book I don't recall now,\r\nbut he saw a book on Marxism in Lee's residence when they lived on\r\nMercedes Street in Fort Worth.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he say in words or substance that he thought that\r\nOswald was a half-baked Communist?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I think that is the expression he used, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, did there--did you ever go to Oswald's own apartment?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, I went there once to take Paul to his lesson. I, in\r\nother words I visited in their so-called living room once, when they\r\nlived on Mercedes Street.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In Fort Worth?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. In Fort Worth, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you tell us what the conditions in their home were\r\nlike?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. It was practically a bare room. There was no furniture to\r\nspeak of. There was the bare necessities; there was no playpen or crib\r\nfor the baby. The baby was playing in the middle of the floor in the\r\nliving room, as I remember. It was an extremely primitively furnished\r\nroom, and the rest of the house was the same way.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you have any impression as to whether the Oswald baby\r\nwas being adequately cared for?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No; that I don't know. I do know this, that Oswald showed\r\noutward signs of love toward the baby. He would pucker his lips and\r\nthis and that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Indicating that he had affection for the child?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. For the child.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. At that visit did you have any discussion with Oswald\r\nabout living conditions or anything else in Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No, sir; I simply took Paul in for that lesson, and I left\r\nbefore the lesson began.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, did there come a time when you held a dinner party\r\nto which you invited Mr. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes. Well, really, it was not a dinner party. It was a\r\nsmall dinner. I mentioned the fact that Marina Oswald went to school\r\nin Leningrad, formerly St. Petersburg prior to the revolution, and\r\na friend of mine, George Bouhe of Dallas, who is an accountant, was\r\nborn and raised in St. Petersburg. He indicated to me that he would\r\nlike to meet Marina Oswald and his fellow townswoman and townsman, so\r\nI discussed it with my wife, and she thought she will invite Marina\r\nOswald and Lee Oswald and Mr. Bouhe, and a friend of Mr. Bouhe, Mrs.\r\nMeller of Dallas, to their dinner. I am sure Paul was at home at that\r\ntime, so there were six of us at the dinner and my wife and my son.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Will you tell us when the dinner was held?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes; it was before Paul went back to school so I assume it\r\nwas in the early party of September, maybe it was late in August.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Mr. Bouhe is a native born Russian?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes; he was born in St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What about Mrs. Meller?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I assume Mrs. Meller was born in Ukrania.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. During this dinner party was there any discussion between\r\nMrs. Meller and Mr. Bouhe with the Oswalds concerning their background,\r\nexperiences in Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. The conversation, as I recall it, centered mostly on St.\r\nPetersburg. Bouhe brought with him his albums of St. Petersburg, and he\r\nwas asking her and they were both looking at the pictures, and is such\r\nand such statue on the main street of St. Petersburg, and so on and so\r\nforth. I think that was the gist of the conversation.\r\n\r\nThey also discussed the present day life in the Soviet Union. I do\r\nrecall, the conversation was mostly with Marina, and she did not speak\r\nany English at that time, so all of that conversation was in the\r\nRussian language, which my wife does not understand at all.\r\n\r\nI remembered that Lee Oswald hazarded, he would interject into the\r\nconversation, and he was a little bit critical of the attitude of the\r\nSoviet Government toward its own people, and here is what I am trying\r\nto say; he said they make the best shoes in Minsk for export, and\r\nthe people get the--and I think he indicated his own shoes, which he\r\nstill wore at that time. Then just very, very slight criticism, not\r\npolitically, but sort of in the sense of economics that the people were\r\nnot getting the best products, they were all for export.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, at that time was there any indication that Oswald\r\nwas better treated than other people in the Soviet Union or did you\r\nmaintain the impression throughout your acquaintance with Oswald that\r\nhe was treated similarly to other Russians?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. That was my impression, that he was treated the same as\r\nother Russians.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you detect any friction between Marina Oswald and Lee\r\nOswald at this dinner?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was there any indication at that time that Lee Oswald had\r\nbeaten his wife in any way?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Not at that time; no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever see any indication that Marina Oswald had\r\nbeen beaten?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No, sir; I haven't seen it personally. I have heard\r\nreports from my friends that he did mistreat her physically, and that\r\nhe had blackened her eyes, and once even extinguished a cigarette on\r\nher shoulder, something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Who told you that?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. To the best of my recollection it was either--I think it\r\nwas Bouhe or it could have been Mrs. Meller, but I believe it was Bouhe.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. That was at a time subsequent to this dinner party?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, sir; subsequent. It was after the assassination of\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. That Bouhe told you?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Oswald at all discuss the reason why he went to\r\nRussia?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No; he just told me, you know once, the very first time I\r\nmet him that he went there on his own.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he indicate any desire to return to Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I learned subsequently that he did but he never indicated\r\nit to me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know whether Oswald maintained contacts with\r\npeople that he had associated with in Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. None to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You don't know that he wrote them letters?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No, sir. Excuse me, sir, when you asked me about his\r\nrelations with Marina Oswald, I don't know whether this is of any\r\nimportance or not, but during my first visit at their apartment\r\non Mercedes Street in Fort Worth, the second time I saw Marina, I\r\nsuggested to him that he should insist that she learn English as\r\nquickly as possible because it would be so much easier for her to get\r\nalong in this country, and he replied that he would prefer that she\r\ndid not learn English at all or else he would lose his fluency in the\r\nRussian language.\r\n\r\nSo it showed to me that he didn't particularly care about her. He cared\r\nmore about himself.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you say anything to him in response to that?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No, sir; I was frankly very much disgusted with that sort\r\nof attitude.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Oswald ever come to your office?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, he came to my office once or twice more. Once I\r\nwas in the office when he came, and at that time, apparently he was\r\ndowntown, my office is downtown in Fort Worth, he brought with him some\r\ntypewritten sheets which he told me he was writing his memoirs of his\r\nlife in the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nI remember seeing, I did not read the manuscripts at all, but I saw\r\nsome snapshots or photographs attached to some typewritten sheets.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. During this time that you--did you have any other\r\ncontacts with Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Well, he came to the office once more but I was not in the\r\noffice, my secretary told me that he came by.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember what he came to your office for? Did he\r\nindicate any particular reason for coming there?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I don't recall. I don't know why he came back. Frankly,\r\nI don't remember. Here is something else that--one of the newspaper\r\nreporters came to the office and asked me if I would deliver a letter\r\nto Oswald, a reporter who tried several times to contact Oswald and get\r\nthe story of his life or something like that, and they simply refused\r\nto see him. Why he choose me, I don't know. How he learned that Oswald\r\ncame to my office, I don't know. But this man came and asked me to\r\ndeliver this letter to Oswald the next time he came to the office, and\r\nI remember now that he did come once or twice more because I handed him\r\nthat letter, and Oswald took it and put it in his pocket.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When were these visits, the second and third\r\nvisits to your office?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I would say that was probably during the month of July\r\n1962.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. 1962.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Oswald ever ask you to help him work on a book?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. That he was working on?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Other than these contacts we have discussed, did you have\r\nany other contacts with Oswald ever?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Well, I was at home when my son Paul answered a telephone\r\ncall from Lee Oswald and he asked if Paul would come to get them, I\r\nguess they were at his brother's, they were going to Dallas, they moved\r\nto Dallas by then, so it must have been in October or maybe it was----\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was it Thanksgiving?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. It could have been Thanksgiving. It was Thanksgiving.\r\nIt was Thanksgiving Day. Paul went to Oswald, Robert Oswald, and\r\nbrought Marina and Lee Oswald and the baby to the house. He fixed\r\nsome sandwiches for them and he took them to the bus station and they\r\nwent to Dallas where they had already established residence. That\r\nwas the last time I saw Lee Oswald and Marina Oswald until after the\r\nassassination of the President.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. On the basis of your contacts with Lee Oswald during this\r\nperiod of time, did you form any judgment of him?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, sir; I think I did. He impressed me as a man that,\r\nfirst, he carried some sort of a chip on his shoulder. I also had the\r\nimpression that, probably unfounded on my part, I don't know, I just\r\nformed that impression, that he, Lee Oswald, felt that he did not get\r\nproper recognition from the people, say, in the United States, maybe\r\neven in the Soviet Union. I don't know. In other words, I felt like he\r\nthought that he was a better man than the other people thought he was.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you have the feeling that he desired to achieve\r\nrecognition?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. That is my distinct impression of him.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you have any opinion as to whether he was ever able\r\nto command this recognition and respect that he was seeking?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you think he was an intelligent person?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Fairly.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you think he was capable of performing an act such as\r\nan assassination of a President?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Definitely.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What do you base that opinion on?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Well, he was a Marine; he, as I said, he carried a chip\r\non his shoulder. From the best--from what I have read and so forth, I\r\npersonally am of the opinion that he assassinated the President.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Well now, based on your knowledge of him prior to the\r\nassassination did you have any reason to believe that he might do such\r\na thing?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Prior to that time, no, sir. I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You didn't regard him as a dangerous individual or\r\nsomething of that sort, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Well, I thought he was--I did not think he was an\r\nunbalanced person or crazy person or anything like that. I would say he\r\nwas sort of, I would say I thought he was sort of a peculiar person but\r\nI never thought he would do an act like that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever make the acquaintance of the mother?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you tell us about that?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes. As I mentioned earlier, I teach Russian once a\r\nweek at the library. We started a new series of lessons on November\r\n12, 1963, and in my class there was a lady by the name of Marguerite\r\nOswald. Frankly, I never connected her with Lee Oswald. Oswald was\r\njust a name to me, and I did not learn about it until the day of the\r\nassassination. Or the next day, the next day, that she was his mother.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Mrs. Oswald call you on the telephone at any time\r\nafter the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes. She called me----\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Tell us about it?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Sunday morning, November 24, about 7 o'clock in the\r\nmorning, from Dallas.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This is the mother called?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. The mother. Sunday morning about 7 o'clock in the morning,\r\nand she said, I still remember, she said, \"Mr. Gregory, I need your\r\nhelp. The reporters, the news media were badgering me.\" I think that is\r\nthe word she used. She said, \"I wonder if some of your friends or you\r\ncould provide a place for me to hide from them.\" And it sounded like\r\nshe was crying on the telephone, although I think that woman is not\r\ntaken to crying.\r\n\r\nSo I told her--she did not want to identify herself when she called\r\nme first. I asked her, I said, \"Who are you?\" And she said, \"I would\r\nrather not tell you who I am but I shall identify myself by saying I am\r\none of the students in the Russian class in the library.\" Of course, I\r\nknew it was Mrs. Oswald. In fact, I guessed who she was before she even\r\ntried to identify herself. So I told her, I said, \"Now, I will tell you\r\nwhat I will do, Mrs. Oswald, you stay where you are and I will promise\r\nto you that I will come to see you sometime today.\" Of course, I knew\r\nwhere she was because the Secret Service told me where they had her\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. The Secret Service contacted you the day before?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. On Saturday?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Isn't it a fact they had asked you to come and translate\r\nan interview with Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. But you didn't do it because you didn't need to do it\r\nthat day?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you see Lee Oswald that day?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No, I did not see him.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you later on Sunday go to see Mrs. Marguerite Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes. As soon as I hung up the phone, I was talking to\r\nMarguerite Oswald, I called the U.S. Secret Service and reported this\r\ncall, of course, and an agent, I called Agent Howard, who lives just\r\nnorth of Fort Worth, and he said, \"Well, that is fine, we will find a\r\nhiding place for her, for Marguerite and Marina Oswald and the babies,\"\r\nand he suggested he come by my house in a matter of 45 minutes or an\r\nhour and we will go to Dallas and then proceed from there. And that is\r\nwhat we did then. We went to Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You went to the Executive Inn where Marina and Mrs.\r\nOswald were staying at that time, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, sir; we went to the Executive Inn, and on the way\r\nwe stopped en route on the turnpike, where the agents arranged a\r\nrendezvous with Robert Oswald and other agents, and we went to the\r\nExecutive Inn in Dallas by the airport, and Robert and I went in and\r\nwe told the women to pack up, that we were going to take them to,\r\nRobert told them we were going to take them to, the farm of his wife's\r\nparents, north of Fort Worth.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. But Mrs. Oswald objected to that?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, she objected, she said she didn't want to go there.\r\nBut I told her that she bothered me to come, to call me at the house to\r\nprovide a place for her and here I am, and if she doesn't like it then\r\nI am just through with her.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You told her that?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. So she packed up and we got with the agents in two or\r\nthree cars, two cars, and we started toward that farm of Robert\r\nOswald's parents. But en route we detoured because Marguerite Oswald\r\nmentioned the fact that the two little babies were all wet, and that\r\nthere were no diaper change for them, that Marina and she had no change\r\nof dresses, and so forth, and she insisted that we go by Irving where\r\nMarina lived with Ruth Paine.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Then you went and obtained some materials for the babies\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Well, we didn't go to the house because we got the report\r\nthat Lee Oswald was shot. You see, that all happened Sunday morning, it\r\nwas 11 o'clock in the morning, we were driving from Dallas to Irving\r\nand we got this report that Lee was shot, and the police advised us not\r\nto go to the house because there was a mob, so we went to the Chief of\r\nPolice of Irving, to his residence. Marina telephoned Ruth Paine from\r\nthere to gather these things for the babies and a change of dress for\r\nher and some money and so forth.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You went from there, then, to Parkland Hospital where\r\nsome events occurred and then you came back to the Inn of the Six Flags?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I want to ask you about something that might have\r\nhappened or happened at the Inn of the Six Flags.\r\n\r\nThere has been a newspaper report, and Mrs. Marguerite Oswald has said\r\nthat on Saturday night an FBI agent came to the Executive Inn and\r\nshowed her a picture of a man who she claims to be Jack Ruby. Have you\r\nseen newspaper reports to that effect?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, I have seen reports to that effect.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, Mrs. Oswald says, also, that while at the Inn of the\r\nSix Flags she observed a newspaper that had Jack Ruby's picture in it\r\nand exclaimed in the presence of other people that that was the same\r\npicture as the FBI had showed her, that is what she says. Did you ever\r\nhear her say anything like that?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No, sir; not to my recollection.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. She never did anything like that in your presence?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. After you met Mrs. Oswald, Marguerite Oswald, and had a\r\nchance to observe her, did that further your judgment of Lee Harvey\r\nOswald in any way?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, sir. I felt that a lot of his, many of his,\r\npeculiarities, possibly were brought on by the influence of his mother.\r\n\r\nTo me, she impressed me as being not necessarily rational. She is\r\nquite clever, but she certainly is most peculiar. She demands public\r\nattention, she wants to be the center of attention. As, for example,\r\nstanding there in the middle of the room at the motel of that Six\r\nFlags, standing in the middle of the room saying \"I want to make a\r\nstatement,\" and she made those statements throughout the frequent\r\nintervals and always she would precede the statement by saying, \"I want\r\nto make a statement. I feel that my son can't be buried anywhere but at\r\nthe Arlington National Cemetery.\"\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you detected similarities between Mrs. Oswald and Lee?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes; I felt they both craved public recognition or to be\r\ncraving attention or publicity or whatever you wish to call it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In our conversation last evening about your testimony, I\r\nasked you about Mrs. Ruth Paine, and you told me that Mrs. Ruth Paine\r\nhad come to visit you at a time subsequent to the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No, sir; she never did. Ruth Paine?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No. She called me on the phone once.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Called on the telephone?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes. But I have never met her.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What was the conversation between you and her?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. She asked me if I would tutor her in writing letters in\r\nRussian. If I remember, she mentioned that she either was going to\r\nwrite to the Soviet Embassy or Soviet Union, something like that, but\r\nI told her I was just too busy, I have no time for that. In fact, I\r\ndidn't want to have anything to do with that sort of--I didn't want to\r\nwrite letters to the Soviet Union or to the Embassy or anybody else.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How long have you taught Russian, Mr. Gregory?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. In the library?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. For approximately 3 or 4 years from 10 to 20 weeks a year.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Have you taught Russian in any other area or\r\ncapacity?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, sir; I taught Russian a couple of years ago, not more\r\nthan 2 years ago, at Carswell Air Force Base at Fort Worth, where I had\r\na class of officers and men in the Russian language. With the result\r\nthat two out of my class passed the Russian examination, and the rest\r\nflunked.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How long would you estimate it would normally\r\ntake for a person of average intelligence to learn to speak and write\r\nRussian as fluently as Oswald did?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. If he lived in this country or in that country? That would\r\nmake a lot of difference.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Well, let's take this country first.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. This country. That would depend again on the effort put\r\nout by the particular individual. If he were in earnest I would think\r\nhe could do it in about 4 years.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is an ordinary person living in the United\r\nStates?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Living in the United States.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Who made----\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Going to study Russian, say at the university, normal\r\nload, maybe 4 hours a week, plus homework, it would take about 4 years.\r\n\r\nIf he lived in the country----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. In the Soviet Union, he probably could do it in 2 or 3\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Oswald tell you when he first visited you that\r\nhe had learned to speak Russian, where?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. In the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. He never gave you any indication he had learned or\r\nstudied prior to going to the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I have about one or two more questions.\r\n\r\nDid you discuss at any time with Marina Oswald the conversation that\r\nshe had with Lee Oswald after the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Would you mind to state that again?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald spoke with Lee after the assassination, when he was in\r\nthe jail.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she tell you about that?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Well, I don't remember whether it was Marina or whether\r\nit was Marguerite Oswald. I don't remember now; they did go to see him\r\nin the jail in the city of Dallas, and it must have been Marguerite\r\nbecause she was bragging what a wonderful son he is because he looked\r\nat the little girl, June, she is 2 years old, and he said, \"You have\r\ngot to buy her a new pair of shoes,\" I remember that. It must have been\r\nMarguerite because she used that as an illustration of what a wonderful\r\nboy he was.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Other than that, you have no information as to what\r\ntranspired at that time, happened at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would it be fair to say, Mr. Gregory, that it was through\r\nOswald's contact with you that he subsequently made the association\r\nwith and contact with the other members of the Russian community in\r\nDallas and Fort Worth?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. I think that would be a fair statement, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I have no more questions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Congressman?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I have one more, Mr. Gregory.\r\n\r\nI believe Marina has testified when she first met Lee Harvey Oswald it\r\nwas approximately 17 months after he had arrived in the Soviet Union.\r\nShe testified, also, that she could not tell whether he was a native\r\nborn resident of the Soviet Union or a foreigner by the way he spoke.\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is that unusual?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Well, frankly. I don't know. You see, Congressman, the\r\ncity of Minsk is what we call, they call it, not we call, they call it\r\nin the White Russia Republic. You know they called this the Union of\r\nRepublics, you know, in the White Russian Republic, and Minsk, I guess,\r\nis the capital of it.\r\n\r\nIt is fairly close to Poland, and there are all sorts of people, Poles,\r\nLithuanians, probably Latvians, that lived in that part of the country,\r\nand none of those people speak pure Russian.\r\n\r\nNow, whether she had reference, whether that had anything to do with\r\nher statement----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Her observations?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Right; I don't know.\r\n\r\nNow, I thought that Lee Oswald spoke with a Polish accent, that is why\r\nI asked him if he was of Polish descent.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But leaving----\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. But, otherwise, I would say it would be rather unusual,\r\nrather unusual for a person who lived in the Soviet Union for 17 months\r\nthat he would speak so well that a native Russian would not be sure\r\nwhether he was born in that country or not.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That would be a very unusual kind of a person?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. It would be, yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Or a person who had unusual training?\r\n\r\nMr. GREGORY. Right, or unusual ability or training, yes, that is right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is all, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Gregory. You have been very\r\nhelpful.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 1 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monday, March 16, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF COMDR. JAMES J. HUMES, COMDR. J. THORNTON BOSWELL, AND LT.\r\nCOL. PIERRE A. FINCK\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 2 p.m. on March 16, 1964, at 200\r\nMaryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Sherman\r\nCooper, Representative Gerald R. Ford, John J. McCloy, and Allen W.\r\nDulles, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; Francis W. H. Adams,\r\nassistant counsel; Norman Redlich, assistant counsel; Arlen Specter,\r\nassistant counsel; and Charles Murray, observer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF COMDR. JAMES J. HUMES\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will be in order.\r\n\r\nCommander Humes, will you please step up. You know, Commander, what\r\nwe have met for today to take your testimony concerning the autopsy\r\nand anything else you might know concerning the assassination of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nWould you raise your right hand, please?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you give before this Commission\r\nwill be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help\r\nyou God?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Will you be seated?\r\n\r\nYou may proceed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Humes, will you state your full name for the record,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. James Joseph Humes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your profession or occupation, please?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I am a physician and employed by the Medical\r\nDepartment of the United States Navy.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your rank in the Navy?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Commander, Medical Corps. United States Navy.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where did you receive your education, Commander Humes,\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I had my undergraduate training at St. Joseph's\r\nCollege at Villanova University in Philadelphia. I received my medical\r\ndegree in 1948 from the Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nI received my internship and my postgraduate training in my special\r\nfield of interest in Pathology in various Naval hospitals, and at the\r\nArmed Forces Institute of Pathology at Walter Reed in Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What do your current duties involve?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. My current title is Director of Laboratories of the\r\nNaval Medical School at Naval Medical Center at Bethesda. I am charged\r\nwith the responsibility of the overall supervision of all of the\r\nlaboratory operations in the Naval medical center, two broad areas, one\r\nin the field of anatomic pathology which comprises examining surgical\r\nspecimens and postmortem examinations and then the rather large field\r\nof clinical pathology which takes in examination of the blood and\r\nvarious body fluids.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you been certified by the American Board of Pathology?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; both in anatomic pathology and in clinical\r\npathology in 1955.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What specific experience have you had, if any, with\r\nrespect to gunshot wounds?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. My type of practice, which fortunately has been in\r\npeacetime endeavor to a great extent, has been more extensive in the\r\nfield of natural disease than violence. However, on several occasions\r\nin various places where I have been employed, I have had to deal with\r\nviolent death, accidents, suicides, and so forth. Also I have had\r\ntraining at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, I have completed\r\na course in forensic pathology there as part of my training in the\r\noverall field of pathology.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to participate in the autopsy of the\r\nlate John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was your specific function in connection with that\r\nautopsy?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. As the senior pathologist assigned to the Naval\r\nMedical Center, I was called to the Center by my superiors and informed\r\nthat the President's body would be brought to our laboratories for an\r\nexamination, and I was charged with the responsibility of conducting\r\nand supervising this examination; told to also call upon anyone whom I\r\nwished as an assistant in this matter, that I deemed necessary to be\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who did assist you, if anyone, in the course of the\r\nautopsy?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. My first assistant was Commander J. Thornton Boswell,\r\nwhose position is Chief of Pathology at the Naval Medical School, and\r\nmy other assistant was Lt. Col. Pierre Finck, who is in the wound\r\nballistics section of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.\r\n\r\nWhen I ascertained the nature of the President's wounds, having had\r\nthe facilities of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology offered to\r\nme by General Blumberg, the commanding officer of that institution, I\r\nfelt it advisable and would be of help to me to have the services of an\r\nexpert in the field of wound ballistics and for that reason I requested\r\nColonel Finck to appear.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Tell us who else in a general way was present at the time\r\nthe autopsy was conducted in addition to you three doctors, please?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. This, I must preface by saying it will be somewhat\r\nincomplete. My particular interest was on the examination of the\r\nPresident and not of the security measures of the other people who were\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Surgeon General of the Navy was present at one time or\r\nanother. Admiral Galloway, the Commanding Officer of the National Naval\r\nMedical Center; my own commanding officer, Captain John H. Stover of\r\nthe Naval Medical School, Dr. John Ebersole, one of the radiologists\r\nassigned to the Naval Hospital, Bethesda, who assisted with X-ray\r\nexaminations which were made. These are the chief names, sir; that I\r\ncan recall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time did the autopsy start approximately?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The president's body was received at 25 minutes before\r\n8, and the autopsy began at approximately 8 p.m. on that evening.\r\nYou must include the fact that certain X-rays and other examinations\r\nwere made before the actual beginning of the routine type autopsy\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Precisely what X-rays or photographs were taken before the\r\ndissection started?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Some of these X-rays were taken before and some during\r\nthe examination, which also maintains for the photographs, which were\r\nmade as the need became apparent to make such.\r\n\r\nHowever, before the postmortem examination was begun, anterior,\r\nposterior and lateral X-rays of the head, and of the torso were made,\r\nand identification type photographs, I recall having been made of the\r\nfull face of the late President. A photograph showing the massive\r\nhead wound with the large defect that was associated with it. To my\r\nrecollection all of these were made before the proceedings began.\r\n\r\nSeveral others, approximately 15 to 20 in number, were made in total\r\nbefore we finished the proceedings.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now were those X-rays or photographs or both when you\r\nreferred to the total number?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. By the number I would say they are in number 15 to 20.\r\nThere probably was ten or 12 X-ray films exposed in addition.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time did this autopsy end?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. At approximately 11 p.m.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What wounds did you observe on the late President, if any?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The wounds which we observed on the President\r\nwere--excuse me, at this point might I use the charts which I have\r\nprepared?\r\n\r\nWould that be appropriate?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes; would you like to start with the neck wound?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. All right, sir.\r\n\r\nI might preface my remarks by stating that the President's body was\r\nreceived in our morgue in a closed casket. We opened the casket, Dr.\r\nBoswell and I, and the President's body was unclothed in the casket,\r\nwas wrapped in a sheet labeled by the Parkland Hospital, but he was\r\nunclothed once the sheet was removed from his body so we do not have at\r\nthat time any clothing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Humes, before you identify what that represents let me\r\nplace Commission Exhibit No. 385 on it so it may be identified.\r\n\r\n(The drawing was marked Commission Exhibit No. 385 for identification.)\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. When appraised of the necessity for our appearance\r\nbefore this Commission, we did not know whether or not the photographs\r\nwhich we had made would be available to the Commission. So to assist in\r\nmaking our testimony more understandable to the Commission members, we\r\ndecided to have made drawings, schematic drawings, of the situation as\r\nwe saw it, as we recorded it and as we recall it. These drawings were\r\nmade under my supervision and that of Dr. Boswell by Mr. Rydberg, whose\r\ninitials are H. A. He is a hospital corpsman, second class, and a\r\nmedical illustrator in our command at Naval Medical School.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you provide him with the basic information from which\r\nthese drawings were made?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Distances, that sort of thing?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir. We had made certain physical measurements of\r\nthe wounds, and of their position on the body of the late President,\r\nand we provided these and supervised directly Mr. Rydberg in making\r\nthese drawings.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you checked the drawings subsequent to their\r\npreparation to verify their accuracy?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And proportion?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I must state these drawings are in part schematic.\r\nThe artist had but a brief period of some 2 days to prepare these.\r\nHe had no photographs from which to work, and had to work under our\r\ndescription, verbal description, of what we had observed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would it be helpful to the artist, in redefining the\r\ndrawings if that should become necessary, to have available to him the\r\nphotographs or X-rays of the President?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. If it were necessary to have them absolutely true to\r\nscale. I think it would be virtually impossible for him to do this\r\nwithout the photographs.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is the reason for the necessity for having the\r\nphotographs?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I think that it is most difficult to transmit into\r\nphysical measurements the--by word the--exact situation as it was seen\r\nto the naked eye. The photographs were--there is no problem of scale\r\nthere because the wounds, if they are changed in size or changed in\r\nsize and proportion to the structures of the body and so forth, when\r\nwe attempt to give a description of these findings, it is the bony\r\nprominences, I cannot, which we used as points of references, I cannot,\r\ntransmit completely to the illustrator where they were situated.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is the taking of photographs and X-rays routine or is this\r\nsomething out of the ordinary?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. No, sir; this is quite routine in cases of this sort\r\nof violent death in our training. In the field of forensic pathology\r\nwe have found that the photographs and X-rays are of most value, the\r\nX-rays particularly in finding missiles which have a way of going\r\nin different directions sometimes, and particularly as documentary\r\nevidence these are considered invaluable in the field of forensic\r\npathology.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you now proceed to show us what Commission Exhibit\r\n385 depicts, please?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Actually, I think, sir, at this time the view from the\r\nposterior aspect would also be of value to the Commission.\r\n\r\nThis is----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Doctor, I hand you the second exhibit which is marked\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 386.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 386 was marked for identification.)\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I believe at this point I would like to have, if you\r\nhave my gross autopsy description because I will give the dimensions of\r\nthese wounds at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. We will use the Commission Exhibit No. 387 and I will ask\r\nyou first of all, for the record, to identify what this document is,\r\nDr. Humes.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 387 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. This document is a copy of the gross autopsy report\r\nwhich was prepared by myself, Dr. Boswell, and Dr. Finck, and completed\r\nwithin approximately 48 hours after the assassination of the President.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does that report bear your signature at its end?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. It bears my signature on the first or covering page as\r\nwell as on my last page, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you now proceed to tell us what you observed with\r\nrespect to the wound which is marked as appearing in the upper back or\r\nlower neck?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Have you identified that?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The one on the side is 385 and the one of the rear view is\r\n386. And that one is 387. For purposes of our record, if you will, put\r\nthem in as 385 and 386 for our printed record. You might want to put\r\nthem in chalk above them so you will see the one on the left is 385 and\r\non the right is 386.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. These exhibits again are schematic representations\r\nof what we observed at the time of examining the body of the late\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nExhibit 385 shows in the low neck an oval wound which--excuse me, I\r\nwish to get the measurements correct. This wound was situated just\r\nabove the upper border of the scapula, and measured 7 by 4 millimeters,\r\nwith its long axis roughly parallel to the long axis of vertical column.\r\n\r\nWe saw--I would rather not discuss the situation of the anterior neck\r\nat this time or would you prefer it?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How would you prefer to do it, Dr. Humes?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I would prefer to discuss the wounds, two wounds, we\r\nsaw posteriorly and the wound, other wound, of the skull before going\r\nto that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That is fine, Dr. Humes, do it any way you find\r\nconvenient. I will give you the other drawing and you can do them both\r\ntogether. Let the third drawing be marked as Commission Exhibit No. 388.\r\n\r\n(The drawing referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 388 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The wound in the low neck of which I had previously\r\nbegun to speak is now posteriorly--is now depicted in 385, in 386 and\r\nin 388.\r\n\r\nThe second wound was found in the right posterior portion of the scalp.\r\nThis wound was situated approximately 2.5 centimeters to the right,\r\nand slightly above the external occipital protuberance which is a bony\r\nprominence situated in the posterior portion of everyone's skull. This\r\nwound was then 2-1/2 centimeters to the right and slightly above that\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThe third obvious wound at the time of the examination was a huge\r\ndefect over the right side of the skull. This defect involved both\r\nthe scalp and the underlying skull, and from the brain substance was\r\nprotruding.\r\n\r\nThis wound measured approximately 13 centimeters in greatest diameter.\r\nIt was difficult to measure accurately because radiating at various\r\npoints from the large defect were multiple crisscrossing fractures of\r\nthe skull which extended in several directions.\r\n\r\nI have noted in my report that a detailed description of the lines of\r\nthese fractures and of the types of fragments that were thus made were\r\nvery difficult of verbal description, and it was precisely for this\r\nreason that the photographs were made so one might appreciate more\r\nclearly how much damage had been done to the skull.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were the photographs made available then, Dr. Humes, when\r\nExhibit 388 was prepared?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The photographs, to go back a moment, the photographs\r\nand the X-rays were exposed in the morgue of the Naval Medical Center\r\non this night, and they were not developed, neither the X-rays or the\r\nphotographs. They were submitted to the, and here, if I make a mistake\r\nI am not certain, to either the Federal Bureau of Investigation or to\r\nthe Secret Service, I am not sure of those.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you submit those yourself immediately after they were\r\ntaken, Dr. Humes?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Again, one of the senior people present, I believe\r\nmy own Commanding Officer, Captain Stover, took care of turning this\r\nmaterial over to these authorities, and receiving a receipt for this\r\ninformation, for this material. It was--I supervised the positioning of\r\nthe body for various of these examinations but as far as beyond that, I\r\ndid not consider that my responsibility.\r\n\r\nThese, then, were the three wounds which were quite obvious at the time\r\nof the examination.\r\n\r\nI could expand further on the general appearances of these wounds or I\r\ncould turn to the anterior portion of the body and describe various\r\nother wounds which were present.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You were focusing on 388 before I last asked a question,\r\nDr. Humes. Why don't you describe in general terms the nature of the\r\nwound which was present at the top of the head of the late President?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. With your permission, sir, and Mr. Chief Justice, I\r\nthink I might describe those two wounds together, and describe the\r\ndefects in the scalp and in the skull in each instance.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That would be fine.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Would that be appropriate?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Turning now to Commission Exhibit 388, where we have\r\ndepicted in the posterior right portion of the skull a wound which we\r\nhave labeled \"in\" or a wound of entrance and a large roughly 13 cm.\r\ndiameter defect in the right lateral vertex of the skull. I would go\r\ninto some further detail in describing these wounds.\r\n\r\nThe scalp, I mentioned previously, there was a defect in the scalp and\r\nsome scalp tissue was not available. However, the scalp was intact\r\ncompletely past this defect. In other words, this wound in the right\r\nposterior region was in a portion of scalp which had remained intact.\r\n\r\nSo, we could see that it was the measurement which I gave before, I\r\nbelieve 15 by 6 millimeters.\r\n\r\nWhen one reflected the scalp away from the skull in this region, there\r\nwas a corresponding defect through both tables of the skull in this\r\narea.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe what you mean by both tables, Dr. Humes?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe skull is composed of two layers of bone. We will put the scalp in\r\nin dotted lines.\r\n\r\nThe two solid lines will represent the two layers of the skull bone,\r\nand in between these two layers is loose somewhat irregular bone.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflected the scalp, there was a through and through defect\r\ncorresponding with the wound in the scalp.\r\n\r\nThis wound had to us the characteristics of a wound of entrance for the\r\nfollowing reason: The defect in the outer table was oval in outline,\r\nquite similar to the defect in the skin.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You are referring there, Doctor, to the wound on the lower\r\npart of the neck?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. No, sir; I am speaking here of the wound in the\r\nocciput.\r\n\r\nThe wound on the inner table, however, was larger and had what in\r\nthe field of wound ballistics is described as a shelving or a coning\r\neffect. To make an analogy to which the members of the Commission are\r\nprobably most familiar, when a missile strikes a pane of glass, a\r\ntypical example, a B-B fired by a child's air rifle, when this strikes\r\na pane of glass there will be a small, usually round to oval defect on\r\nthe side of the glass from whence the missile came and a belled-out or\r\nconed-out surface on the opposite side of the glass from whence the\r\nmissile came.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Mr. Dulles entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Experience has shown and my associates and Colonel\r\nFinck, in particular, whose special field of interest is wound\r\nballistics can give additional testimony about this scientifically\r\nobserved fact.\r\n\r\nThis wound then had the characteristics of wound of entrance from this\r\ndirection through the two tables of the skull.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say \"this direction,\" will you specify that\r\ndirection in relationship to the skull?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. At that point I mean only from without the skull to\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Fine, proceed.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Having ascertained to our satisfaction and\r\nincidentally photographs illustrating this phenomenon from both the\r\nexternal surface of the skull and from the internal surface were\r\nprepared, we concluded that the large defect to the upper right side of\r\nthe skull, in fact, would represent a wound of exit.\r\n\r\nA careful examination of the margins of the large bone defect at that\r\npoint, however, failed to disclose a portion of the skull bearing again\r\na wound of--a point of impact on the skull of this fragment of the\r\nmissile, remembering, of course, that this area was devoid of any scalp\r\nor skull at this present time. We did not have the bone.\r\n\r\nIn further evaluating this head wound, I will refer back to the X-rays\r\nwhich we had previously prepared. These had disclosed to us multiple\r\nminute fragments of radio opaque material traversing a line from\r\nthe wound in the occiput to just above the right eye, with a rather\r\nsizable fragment visible by X-ray just above the right eye. These tiny\r\nfragments that were seen dispersed through the substance of the brain\r\nin between were, in fact, just that extremely minute, less than 1 mm.\r\nin size for the most part.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Humes, this would be a good juncture to produce two\r\nphotographs.\r\n\r\nMay it please the Commission, Mr. Chief Justice Warren, I have\r\nidentified as Commission Exhibits 389 and 390 which will at a later\r\ntime be identified as being two frames from the motion picture camera\r\noperated by one Abraham Zapruder, being the amateur photographer who\r\nwas on the scene, which I think would assist in evaluating the angle of\r\nthe President's head corresponding to that exhibit designated as 388.\r\n\r\nI will hand those to you, Dr. Humes, and ask you if you would state for\r\nthe record the relative position of the President's head in 389 which\r\nis a frame about one-sixteenth of a second before the point of impact\r\nshown in Exhibit 390.\r\n\r\n(The frames referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 389 and\r\n390 for identification.)\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. It will be noted in Exhibit 389 that the President's\r\nhead is bent considerably forward and perhaps somewhat to the left in\r\nthis frame of the photograph 389.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that in approximately the same position as the angle of\r\nthe head depicted in Commission Exhibit No. 388?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, at this time I would like to move for\r\nadmission in evidence of Exhibits 385 through 390.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. They may be admitted under those numbers.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibits Nos. 385, 386, 387, 388, 389, and 390, previously\r\nmarked for identification, were received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you proceed now, Dr. Humes, to continue in your\r\ndescription of the head wound?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Head wound--a careful inspection of this large defect\r\nin the scalp and skull was made seeking for fragments of missile before\r\nany actual detection was begun. The brain was greatly lacerated and\r\ntorn, and in this area of the large defect we did not encounter any of\r\nthese minute particles.\r\n\r\nI might say at this time that the X-ray pictures which were made would\r\nhave a tendency to magnify these minute fragments somewhat in size and\r\nwe were not too surprised in not being able to find the tiny fragments\r\ndepicted in the X-ray.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately how many fragments were observed, Dr. Humes,\r\non the X-ray?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I would have to refer to them again, but I would say\r\nbetween 30 or 40 tiny dust-like particle fragments of radio opaque\r\nmaterial, with the exception of this one I previously mentioned which\r\nwas seen to be above and very slightly behind the right orbit.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Were these all fragments that were injected into the skull\r\nby the bullet?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Our interpretation is, sir, that the missile struck\r\nthe right occipital region, penetrated through the two tables of the\r\nskull, making the characteristic coning on the inner table which I have\r\npreviously referred to. That one portion of the missile and judging by\r\nthe size of the defect thus produced, the major portion of the missile,\r\nmade its exit through this large defect.\r\n\r\nA second portion of the missile or multiple second portions were\r\ndeflected, and traversed a distance as enumerated by this interrupted\r\nline, with the major portion of that fragment coming to lodge in the\r\nposition indicated.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of these minor fragments were dislodged from the major one\r\nas it traversed this course.\r\n\r\nTo better examine the situation with regard to the skull, at this time,\r\nDr. Boswell and I extended the lacerations of the scalp which were\r\nat the margins of this wound, down in the direction of both of the\r\nPresident's ears. At that point, we had even a better appreciation of\r\nthe extensive damage which had been done to the skull by this injury.\r\n\r\nWe had to do virtually no work with a saw to remove these portions of\r\nthe skull, they came apart in our hands very easily, and we attempted\r\nto further examine the brain, and seek specifically this fragment which\r\nwas the one we felt to be of a size which would permit us to recover it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you refer to this fragment, and you are pointing\r\nthere, are you referring to the fragment depicted right above the\r\nPresident's right eye?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; above and somewhat behind the President's\r\neye.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you proceed, then, to tell us what you did then?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir. We dissected carefully in this region and in\r\nfact located this small fragment, which was in a defect in the brain\r\ntissue in just precisely this location.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How large was that fragment, Dr. Humes?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I refer to my notes for the measurements of that\r\nfragment.\r\n\r\nI find in going back to my report, sir, that we found, in fact, two\r\nsmall fragments in this approximate location. The larger of these\r\nmeasured 7 by 2 mm., the smaller 3 by 1 mm.\r\n\r\nTo make my presentation of this wound of the skull more logical to the\r\nCommission, I would like to go forward in time that evening to at a\r\nlater hour. I apologize--time and what happened exactly at what moment\r\nescapes me at this time.\r\n\r\nI mentioned previously that there was a large bony defect. Some time\r\nlater on that evening or very early the next morning while we were all\r\nstill engaged in continuing our examination, I was presented with three\r\nportions of bone which had been brought to Washington from Dallas by\r\nthe agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\r\n\r\nThese were----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Might that have been by a Secret Service agent?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. It could be, sir; these things----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At any rate, someone presented these three pieces of bone\r\nto you?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Someone presented these three pieces of bone to me, I\r\ndo not recall specifically their statement as to where they had been\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me they felt it had been recovered either in the street or\r\nin the automobile, I don't recall specifically.\r\n\r\nWe were most interested in these fragments of bone, and found that the\r\nthree pieces could be roughly put together to account for a portion of\r\nthis defect.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How much remained unaccounted for, Dr. Humes?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I would estimate that approximately one-quarter\r\nof that defect was unaccounted for by adding these three fragments\r\ntogether and seeing what was left.\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat difficult, because as back to when we were actually\r\nlooking for the fragments of metal, as we moved the scalp about,\r\nfragments of various sizes would fall to the table, and so forth, so it\r\nwas difficult to put that exact figure into words.\r\n\r\nHowever, the thing which we considered of importance about these three\r\nfragments of bone was that at the margins of one of them which was\r\nroughly pyramidal in shape, there was a portion of the circumference\r\nof what we interpreted as a missile wound. We thus interpreted it this\r\nbecause there was, the size was, sufficiently large for us, for it to\r\nhave the curve of the skull still evident. At the point of this defect,\r\nand I will draw both tables of the bone in this defect, at the area\r\nwhich we interpreted as the margin of a missile wound, there was a\r\nshelving of the margin.\r\n\r\nThis would, to us, mean that a missile had made this wound from within\r\nthe skull to the exterior. To confirm that this was a missile wound,\r\nX-rays were made of that fragment of bone, which showed radio-opaque\r\nmaterial consistent and similar in character to the particles seen\r\nwithin the skull to be deposited in the margins of this defect, in this\r\nportion of the bone.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then what conclusion did you reach as to what caused that\r\nhole reconstructed from the three portions of the late President's\r\nscalp?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. We reached the conclusion a missile entered the\r\nleft--the right posterior inferior portion----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Doctor, perhaps it would be helpful if you would refer\r\nto that as letter \"A\" and the exit as letter \"B\", so that the record\r\nis clear on those two points and perhaps it will be helpful to your\r\ndescription as well.\r\n\r\nAnd would you mark them as well, with a pencil?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. That is not entry for the second.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Exit for the second?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I will label 388 with the letter \"A\" to indicate our\r\nopinion as to the wound of entrance into the skull.\r\n\r\nI will label as Point \"B\" the area of exit of a portion of the missile\r\nthat entered posteriorly. I say a portion because a small fragment was\r\nseen in the position previously noted which was recovered.\r\n\r\nHowever, we concluded that a very significant portion, perhaps the\r\nlargest portion, made its exit and accounted for this very large defect\r\nfor the multiple fractures of the skull and for the loss of brain and\r\nscalp tissue at this point.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe at this juncture the damage which was\r\ninflicted upon the brain, please?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. May I refer at this point to the gross description of\r\nthe brain prepared separately?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Certainly, Dr. Humes, if you prefer to do it in that order.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I believe you have that. It is the second portion of\r\nthe report.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir. I can make that available to you here.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. While that is being provided, when we reflected the\r\nscalp away from the badly damaged skull, and removed some of these\r\nloosened portions of skull bone, we were able to see this large defect\r\nin the right cerebral hemisphere. It corresponded roughly in size with\r\nthe greatest diameter of the defect in the scalp measuring some 13 cm.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record now show I am handing to you, Dr. Humes, an\r\nexhibit marked Commission Exhibit 391, and will you identify what that\r\nis, please, Doctor?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Exhibit 391 is listed as a supplementary report on the\r\nautopsy of the late President Kennedy, and was prepared some days after\r\nthe examination.\r\n\r\nThis delay necessitated by, primarily, our desire to have the brain\r\nbetter fixed with formaldehyde before we proceeded further with the\r\nexamination of the brain which is a standard means of approach to study\r\nof the brain.\r\n\r\nThe brain in its fresh state does not lend itself well to examination.\r\n\r\nFrom my notes of the examination, at the time of the post-mortem\r\nexamination, we noted that clearly visible in the large skull defect\r\nand exuding from it was lacerated brain tissue which, on close\r\ninspection proved to represent the major portion of the right cerebral\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\nWe also noted at this point that the flocculus cerebri was extensively\r\nlacerated and that the superior sagittal sinus which is a venous blood\r\ncontaining channel in the top of the meninges was also lacerated.\r\n\r\nTo continue to answer your question with regard to the damage of the\r\nbrain, following the formal infixation, Dr. Boswell, Dr. Finck and I\r\nconvened to examine the brain in this state.\r\n\r\nWe also prepared photographs of the brain from several aspects to\r\ndepict the extent of these injuries.\r\n\r\nWe found that the right cerebral hemisphere was markedly disrupted.\r\nThere was a longitudinal laceration of the right hemisphere which was\r\nparasagittal in position. By the saggital plane, as you may know, is a\r\nplane in the midline which would divide the brain into right and left\r\nhalves.\r\n\r\nThis laceration was parasagittal. It was situated approximately 2.5 cm.\r\nto the right of the midline, and extended from the tip of occipital\r\nlobe, which is the posterior portion of the brain, to the tip of the\r\nfrontal lobe which is the most anterior portion of the brain, and it\r\nextended from the top down to the substance of the brain a distance of\r\napproximately 5 or 6 cm.\r\n\r\nThe base of the laceration was situated approximately 4.5 cm. below the\r\nvertex in the white matter. By the vertex we mean--the highest point on\r\nthe skull is referred to as the vertex.\r\n\r\nThe area in which the greatest loss of brain substance was particularly\r\nin the parietal lobe, which is the major portion of the right cerebral\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe margins of this laceration at all points were jagged and irregular,\r\nwith additional lacerations extending in varying directions and for\r\nvarying distances from the main laceration.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there was a laceration of the corpus callosum which is a\r\nbody of fibers which connects the two hemispheres of the brain to each\r\nother, which extended from the posterior to the anterior portion of\r\nthis structure, that is the corpus callosum. Exposed in this laceration\r\nwere portions of the ventricular system in which the spinal fluid\r\nnormally is disposed within the brain.\r\n\r\nWhen viewed from above the left cerebral hemisphere was intact. There\r\nwas engorgement of blood vessels in the meninges covering the brain. We\r\nnote that the gyri and sulci, which are the convolutions of the brain\r\nover the left hemisphere were of normal size and distribution.\r\n\r\nThose on the right were too fragmented and distorted for satisfactory\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nWhen the brain was turned over and viewed from its basular or inferior\r\naspect, there was found a longitudinal laceration of the mid-brain\r\nthrough the floor of the third ventricle, just behind the optic chiasma\r\nand the mammillary bodies.\r\n\r\nThis laceration partially communicates with an oblique 1.5 cm. tear\r\nthrough the left cerebral peduncle. This is a portion of the brain\r\nwhich connects the higher centers of the brain with the spinal cord\r\nwhich is more concerned with reflex actions.\r\n\r\nThere were irregular superficial lacerations over the basular or\r\ninferior aspects of the left temporal and frontal lobes. We interpret\r\nthat these later contusions were brought about when the disruptive\r\nforce of the injury pushed that portion of the brain against the\r\nrelative intact skull.\r\n\r\nThis has been described as contre-coup injury in that location.\r\n\r\nThis, then, I believe, Mr. Specter, are the major points with regard to\r\nthe President's head wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have an opinion, Dr. Humes, as to whether there\r\nwere dumdum bullets used specifically on this wound which struck point\r\n\"A\" of the head, on 388?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I believe these were not dumdum bullets, Mr. Specter.\r\nA dumdum bullet is a term that has been used to describe various\r\nmissiles which have a common characteristic of fragmenting extensively\r\nupon striking.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you characterize the resultant effect on this bullet\r\nas not extensive fragmenting?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes. Had this wound on point \"A\" on Exhibit 388 been\r\ninflicted by a dumdum bullet, I would anticipate that it would not have\r\nanything near the regular contour and outline which it had. I also\r\nwould anticipate that the skull would have been much more extensively\r\ndisrupted, and not have, as was evident in this case, a defect which\r\nquite closely corresponded to the overlying skin defect because that\r\ntype of a missile would fragment on contact and be much more disruptive\r\nat this point.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At this point would you state for the record the size and\r\napproximate dimension of the major wound on the top of the head which\r\nyou have marked wound \"B\"?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. This was so large, that localization of it in a\r\ndescriptive way is somewhat difficult.\r\n\r\nHowever, we have mentioned that its major--its greatest dimension\r\nwas approximately 13 cm. The reason it was difficult to measure is\r\nthat various fracture lines extend out from it in a quite irregular\r\nfashion, but it was approximately 13 cm.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. This red that is marked on 388 on the base of the skull, is\r\nthat seepage or what?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. No, sir; that is to depict the musculature at the base\r\nof the neck.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I see.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. That is not taken to depict the blood, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On the reconstruction of the three portions of the scalp\r\nwhich you described----\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Skull, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Skull, which enabled you to reconstruct a point of exit\r\nof the bullet, will you state at this point of the record that size of\r\nopening or exit path of the bullet?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. As I mentioned previously, at one angle of this\r\nlargest pyramidal shaped fragments of bone which came as a separate\r\nspecimen, we had the portion of the perimeter of a roughly what we\r\nwould judge to have been a roughly circular wound of exit. Judging from\r\nthat portion of the perimeter which was available to us, we would have\r\njudged the diameter of that wound to be between 2.5 and 3 cm.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Doctor Humes, have you now described the major\r\ncharacteristics and features of the wounds to the late President's head?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I believe that I have, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Will you now turn your attention, please to the\r\nwound which is noted on 385 and 386 being at the----\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Before we leave that, could I ask a question?\r\n\r\nWhen you talk about dumdum bullets, do you include the ordinary type\r\nof soft nose sporting bullets, maybe this is something that Colonel\r\nFinck would be more expert on, but was that, was the bullet, could it\r\npossibly have been a sporting type of hunting bullet that has a soft\r\nnose but is still somewhat firm?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. From the characteristics of this wound, Mr. McCloy, I\r\nwould believe that it must have had a very firm head rather than a soft\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Steel jacketed, would you say, copper jacketed bullet?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I believe more likely a jacketed bullet because of the\r\nregular outline which was present.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask a question?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Dulles.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Believing that we know the type of bullet that was usable\r\nin this gun, would this be the type of wound that might result from\r\nthat kind of a bullet?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I believe so, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. If my question is clear----\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. We think we know what the bullet is, we may be wrong but we\r\nthink we know what it was, is this wound consistent with that type of\r\nbullet?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Quite consistent, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. There is no evidence of any keyholing of the bullet before\r\nit hit, before the point of impact?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I don't exactly follow your question.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Was the bullet moving in a direct line or had it begun to\r\ntumble?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. To tumble?\r\n\r\nThat is a difficult question to answer. I have the opinion, however,\r\nthat it was more likely moving in a direct line. You will note that\r\nthe wound in the posterior portion of the occiput on Exhibit 388\r\nis somewhat longer than the other missile wound which we have not\r\nyet discussed in the low neck. We believe that rather than due to a\r\ntumbling effect, this is explainable on the fact that this missile\r\nstruck the skin and skull at a more tangential angle than did the other\r\nmissile, and, therefore, produced a more elongated defect, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask a question there? Perhaps you have done\r\nthis, but if not, how would you explain the difference of the courses\r\nof the fragments which you traced and described as, I think, being\r\ndiscovered behind the right eye?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. And the course of the fragment which was believed\r\ncaused the large defect?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Caused the large defect?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. How do you explain----\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The discrepancy?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. The difference in the courses.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nAs this missile penetrated the scalp, it then came upon a very firm\r\nsubstance, the hard skull, and I believe that this track depicted by\r\nthe dotted lines on Exhibit 388 was a portion of that missile which was\r\ndislodged as it made its defect in the skull. And that--that another\r\nportion, and, as I say, presumably, by the size of the defect, a more\r\nmajor portion made its exit through the right lateral side of the skull.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Is this piece of pyramidal bone that was brought in to you\r\nsubsequently as I understand it----\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Was that part of the outer table or the inner table?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. It was both tables, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Both tables?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; had it only been one it might have been\r\ndifficult to ascertain whether it was.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Shelving or not?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; in or out, but it encompassed both tables,\r\nsir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is the angle of declination that you--one sees there from\r\nin and out approximately the angle you think at which the bullet was\r\ntraveling at the time of impact and exit?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. That is our impression, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. So then the shot would have been fired from some point\r\nabove the head of the person hit?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Humes, would you elaborate a bit on the differences in\r\nthe paths, specifically why the bullet went in one direction in part\r\nand in part in the second direction, terminating with the fragment\r\nright over the right eye?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nI will make a drawing of the posterior portion of the skull showing\r\nagain this beveling which we observed at the inner table of the skull.\r\n\r\nOur impression is that as this projectile impinged upon the skull in\r\nthis fashion, a small portion of it was dislodged due to the energy\r\nexpended in that collision, if you will, and that it went off at an\r\nangle, and left the track which is labeled 388, which is labeled on\r\nExhibit 388 from \"A\", point \"A\" to the point where the fragment was\r\nfound behind the eye.\r\n\r\nWhy a fragment takes any particular direction like that is something\r\nwhich is difficult of scientific explanation. Those of us who have seen\r\nmissiles strike bones, be it the skull or a bone in the extremity,\r\nhave long since learned that portions of these missiles may go off in\r\nvarious directions and the precise physical laws governing them are not\r\nclearly understood.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would the angle be accentuated in any way if you were\r\nto assume the President was in a moving automobile going in a slight\r\ndownhill direction?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. There are many variables under these circumstances.\r\nThe most--the crucial point, I believe, to be the relative position of\r\nthe President's head in relation to the flight of the missile.\r\n\r\nNow, this would be influenced by how far his head was bent, by the\r\nsituation with regard to the level of the seat in the vehicle, off of\r\nthe horizontal, and so forth.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about a decline in the path of the road itself?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I think that that would have a tendency to accentuate\r\nthis angle, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to move for the admission\r\nin evidence now of Exhibit 391, which is the exhibit on the brain\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 391 was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Humes, would you now move over to the wound which\r\nappears on the lower part of the neck and upper part of the back?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask one more question before we get to that, I am\r\nsorry.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Certainly.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could one say as to what portion of the bullet was found in\r\nall these fragments, I mean arrive at an estimate, was it a tenth of\r\nthe bullet, was it, how much was it, assuming the type of bullet that\r\nwe believe was used in this particular rifle.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Sir, I have not had the opportunity to personally\r\nexamine the type of bullet which is believed to have been represented\r\nby this injury.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would estimate--if I understand you correctly the total\r\namount that was present in the President's skull and brain?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Including the fragment?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Including all the fragments.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Including all these minute particles. I would say\r\nthere was something less than one-tenth of the total volume of the\r\nmissile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Humes, do you make that calculation on the assumption\r\nthat the bullets used here were 6.5 mm. Mannlicher-Carcano rifle bullet\r\nweighing 158.6 grams?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, I do; sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had I brought that particular fact to your attention prior\r\nto the time you started testifying here today?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir. One point I intended to make clear these\r\nfragments which I recovered from this position were turned over to the\r\nSecret Service.\r\n\r\nI presume that they have made physical measurements including the\r\nweight of them, and could give a much more intelligent estimate of\r\nthe proportion than I. I would say, however, that we did not deliver\r\nthese minute fragments because they were so small as to be essentially\r\nunrecoverable.\r\n\r\nSo, obviously they were of a very small portion of the major missile.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. These minute fragments were part of the bullet, emanations\r\nfrom the bullet?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. They were not from the head?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. No, sir, they were small, dust, of the size of dust\r\nparticles, however.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is the posture of the head of that figure there, the\r\ninclination of it, roughly the inclination that you think the\r\nPresident's head had at the time from the other photographs?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir. From the photographs and based on the\r\nphysical examination of this wound, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is all I have.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Perhaps this was something that Colonel Finck could testify\r\nto exactly, but, he would be quite competent. Is there anything to\r\nindicate that this was, might have been a larger than a 6.5 or smaller\r\nthan a 6.5?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The size of the defect in the scalp, caused by a\r\nprojectile could vary from missile to missile because of elastic recoil\r\nand so forth of the tissues.\r\n\r\nHowever, the size of the defect in the underlying bone is certainly not\r\nlikely to get smaller than that of the missile which perforated it, and\r\nin this case, the smallest diameter of this was approximately 6 to 7\r\nmm., so I would feel that that would be the absolute upper limit of the\r\nsize of this missile, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Seven would be the absolute upper limit?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; and, of course, just a little tilt could\r\nmake it a little larger, you see.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I have one other question, if I may.\r\n\r\nIs the incidence of clean entry as indicated there, and then great\r\nfragmentation on exit, is that a normal consequence of this type of\r\nwound?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Sir, we feel that there are two potential explanations\r\nfor this.\r\n\r\nOne, having traversed the skull in entrance in the occiput as depicted\r\non 388, the missile begins to tumble, and in that fashion it presents\r\na greater proportion of its surface to the brain substance and to the\r\nskull as it makes its egress.\r\n\r\nThe other and somewhat more difficult to measure and perhaps Colonel\r\nFinck will be able to testify in greater detail on this, is that a high\r\nvelocity missile has tremendous kinetic energy, and this energy is\r\nexpanded against the structures which it strikes, and so that much of\r\nthis defect could be of the nature of blast, as this kinetic energy is\r\ndissipated by traversing the skull.\r\n\r\nIs that the sense of the question, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I will ask a question, and perhaps this isn't in your\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nBut assuming that the shot which struck President Kennedy at point A\r\nwas fired by a gun from the window of the Texas School Book Depository,\r\nand which has been testified to, and assuming that you could locate the\r\nposition of the President at the time he was struck by a bullet, you\r\ncould then, could you not, establish the degree of the missile?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The degree of angle?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. The angle, yes, the degree of angle of the missile from\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; there is one difficulty, and that is\r\nthe defect of exit was so broad that one has to rely more on the\r\ninclination of the entrance than they do connecting in this instance\r\nentrance and exit because so much of the skull was carried away in this\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. That was my second question.\r\n\r\nMy first question was would it be possible physically to establish the\r\ndegree of angle of the trajectory of the bullet?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Within limited accuracy, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Within limited accuracy.\r\n\r\nThat being true then my second question was whether the point of entry\r\nof the bullet, point A, and the, what you call the exit----\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Exit.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you establish them so exactly that they could be\r\nrelated to the degree of angle of the trajectory of the bullet?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; to our satisfaction we did ascertain that\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Just one other question.\r\n\r\nAm I correct in assuming from what you have said that this wound is\r\nentirely inconsistent with a wound that might have been administered if\r\nthe shot were fired from in front or the side of the President: it had\r\nto be fired from behind the President?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Scientifically, sir, it is impossible for it to have\r\nbeen fired from other than behind. Or to have exited from other than\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. This is so obvious that I rather hesitate to ask it. There\r\nis no question in your mind that it was a lethal bullet?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The President, sir, could not possibly have survived\r\nthe effect of that injury no matter what would have been done for him.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Specter.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What conclusions did you reach then as to the trajectory\r\nor point of origin of the bullet, Dr. Humes, based on 388?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. We reached the conclusion that this missile was fired\r\ntoward the President from a point above and behind him, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, on one detail on your report, Dr. Humes, on page\r\n4, on the third line down, you note that there is a lacerated wound\r\nmeasuring 15 by 6 mm. which on the smaller size is, of course, less\r\nthan 6.5 mm.?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What would be the explanation for that variation?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. This is in the scalp, sir, and I believe that this\r\nis explainable on the elastic recoil of the tissues of the skin,\r\nsir. It is not infrequent in missile wounds of this type that the\r\nmeasured wound is slightly smaller than the caliber of the missile that\r\ntraversed it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you proceed, now then to the other major wound of\r\nentry which you have already noted and described?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Its point of origin, where it hit the President.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I--our previously submitted report, which is\r\nCommission No. 387, identified a wound in the low posterior neck of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nThe size of this wound was 4 by 7 mm., with the long axis being in\r\naccordance with the long axis of the body, 44 mm. wide, in other words,\r\n7 mm. long.\r\n\r\nWe attempted to locate such wounds in soft tissue by making reference\r\nto bony structures which do not move and are, therefore, good reference\r\npoints for this type of investigation.\r\n\r\nWe then ascertained, we chose the two bony points of reference--we\r\nchose to locate this wound, where the mastoid process, which is just\r\nbehind the ear, the top of the mastoid process, and the acromion which\r\nis the tip of the shoulder joint. We ascertained physical measurement\r\nat the time of autopsy that this wound was 14 cm. from the tip of the\r\nmastoid process and 14 cm. from the acromion was its central point--\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That is the right acromion?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The tip of the right acromion, yes, sir, and that is\r\nwhy we have depicted it in figure 385 in this location.\r\n\r\nThis wound appeared physically quite similar to the wound which we\r\nhave described before in 388 \"A,\" with the exception that its long\r\naxis was shorter than the long axis of the wound described above.\r\nWhen the tissues beneath this wound were inspected, there was a\r\ndefect corresponding with the skin defect in the fascia overlying the\r\nmusculature of the low neck and upper back.\r\n\r\nI mentioned previously that X-rays were made of the entire body of\r\nthe late President. Of course, and here I must say that as I describe\r\nsomething to you, I might have done it before or after in the\r\ndescription but for the sake of understanding, we examined carefully\r\nthe bony structures in this vicinity as well as the X-rays, to see\r\nif there was any evidence of fracture or of deposition of metallic\r\nfragments in the depths of this wound, and we saw no such evidence,\r\nthat is no fracture of the bones of the shoulder girdle, or of the\r\nvertical column, and no metallic fragments were detectable by X-ray\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nAttempts to probe in the vicinity of this wound were unsuccessful\r\nwithout fear of making a false passage.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What do you mean by that, Doctor?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Well, the defect in the fascia was quite similar,\r\nwhich is the first firm tissue over the muscle beneath the skin, was\r\nquite similar to this. We were unable, however, to take probes and have\r\nthem satisfactorily fall through any definite path at this point.\r\n\r\nNow, to explain the situation in the President's neck, I think it will\r\nbe necessary for me to refer back to Exhibit 385, I believe the number\r\nis correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes; please do, that is 385.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Now, as the President's body was viewed from\r\nanteriorly in the autopsy room, and saying nothing for the moment about\r\nthe missile, there was a recent surgical defect in the low anterior\r\nneck, which measured some 7 or 8 cm. in length or let's say a recent\r\nwound was present in this area.\r\n\r\nThis wound was through the skin, through the subcutaneous tissues and\r\ninto the larynx. Or rather into the trachea of the President.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. To digress chronologically----\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to discuss that wound on the front\r\nside of the President with Dr. Malcolm Perry of Parkland Hospital in\r\nDallas?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; I did. I had the impression from seeing\r\nthe wound that it represented a surgical tracheotomy wound, a wound\r\nfrequently made by surgeons when people are in respiratory distress to\r\ngive them a free airway.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain that point, I called on the telephone Dr. Malcolm Perry\r\nand discussed with him the situation of the President's neck when he\r\nfirst examined the President, and asked him had he in fact done a\r\ntracheotomy which was somewhat redundant because I was somewhat certain\r\nhe had.\r\n\r\nHe said, yes; he had done a tracheotomy and that as the point to\r\nperform his tracheotomy he used a wound which he had interpreted as a\r\nmissile wound in the low neck, as the point through which to make the\r\ntracheotomy incision.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When did you have that conversation with him, Dr. Humes?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I had that conversation early on Saturday morning, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On Saturday morning, November 23d?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. That is correct, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have you had occasion since to examine the report of\r\nParkland Hospital which I made available to you?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May it please the Commission, I would like to note this as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 392, and subject to later technical proof, to\r\nhave it admitted into evidence at this time for the purpose of having\r\nthe doctor comment about it.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be so marked.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 392, for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did your examination of the Parkland Hospital\r\nrecords disclose with respect to this wound on the front side of the\r\nPresident's body?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The examination of this record from Parkland Hospital\r\nrevealed that Doctor Perry had observed this wound as had other\r\nphysicians in attendance upon the President, and actually before a\r\ntracheotomy was performed surgically, an endotracheal tube was placed\r\nthrough the President's mouth and down his larynx and into his trachea\r\nwhich is the first step in giving satisfactory airway to a person\r\ninjured in such fashion and unconscious.\r\n\r\nThe President was unconscious and it is most difficult to pass such a\r\ntube when the person is unconscious.\r\n\r\nThe person who performed that procedure, that is instilled the\r\nendotracheal tube noted that there was a wound of the trachea below the\r\nlarynx, which corresponded in essence with the wound of the skin which\r\nthey had observed from the exterior.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How is that wound described, while you are mentioning the\r\nwound?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I think you will find that on the first page of the\r\nsummary sheet, Dr. Humes.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThis report was written by doctor--or of the activities of Dr. James\r\nCarrico, Doctor Carrico in inserting the endotracheal tube noted a\r\nragged wound of trachea immediately below the larynx.\r\n\r\nThe report, as I recall it, and I have not studied it in minute detail,\r\nwould indicate to me that Doctor Perry realizing from Doctor Carrico's\r\nobservation that there was a wound of the trachea would quite logically\r\nuse the wound which he had observed as a point to enter the trachea\r\nsince the trachea was almost damaged, that would be a logical place in\r\nwhich to put his incision.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of that wound in the neck, Doctor Perry told me that before\r\nhe enlarged it to make the tracheotomy wound it was a \"few millimeters\r\nin diameter.\"\r\n\r\nOf course by the time we saw it, as my associates and as you have\r\nheard, it was considerably larger and no longer at all obvious as a\r\nmissile wound.\r\n\r\nThe report states, and Doctor Perry told me in telephone conversation\r\nthat there was bubbling of air and blood in the vicinity of this wound\r\nwhen he made the tracheotomy. This caused him to believe that perhaps\r\nthere had been a violation of one of the--one or other of the pleural\r\ncavities by a missile. He, therefore, asked one of his associates, and\r\nthe record is to me somewhat confused as to which of his associates, he\r\nasked one of his associates to put in a chest tube. This is a maneuver\r\nwhich is, was quite logical under the circumstances, and which would,\r\nif a tube that were placed through all layers of the wall of the chest,\r\nand the chest cavity had been violated one could remove air that had\r\ngotten in there and greatly assist respiration.\r\n\r\nSo when we examined the President in addition to the large wound which\r\nwe found in conversation with Doctor Perry was the tracheotomy wound,\r\nthere were two smaller wounds on the upper anterior chest.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. These are apparently exit wounds?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Sir, these were knife wounds, these were incised\r\nwounds on either side of the chest, and I will give them in somewhat\r\ngreater detail.\r\n\r\nThese wounds were bilateral, they were situated on the anterior chest\r\nwall in the nipple line, and each were 2 cm. long in the transverse\r\naxis. The one on the right was situated 11 cm. above the nipple--the\r\none on the left was situated 11 cm. on the nipple, and the one on the\r\nright was 8 cm. above the nipple. Their intention was to incise through\r\nthe President's chest to place tubes into his chest.\r\n\r\nWe examined those wounds very carefully, and found that they, however,\r\ndid not enter the chest cavity. They only went through the skin.\r\n\r\nI presume that as they were performing that procedure it was obvious\r\nthat the President had died, and they didn't pursue this.\r\n\r\nTo complete the examination of the area of the neck and the chest, I\r\nwill do that together, we made the customary incision which we use in\r\na routine postmortem examination which is a Y-shaped incision from the\r\nshoulders over the lower portion of the breastbone and over to the\r\nopposite shoulder and reflected the skin and tissues from the anterior\r\nportion of the chest.\r\n\r\nWe examined in the region of this incised surgical wound which was\r\nthe tracheotomy wound and we saw that there was some bruising of the\r\nmuscles of the neck in the depths of this wound as well as laceration\r\nor defect in the trachea.\r\n\r\nAt this point, of course, I am unable to say how much of the defect in\r\nthe trachea was made by the knife of the surgeon, and how much of the\r\ndefect was made by the missile wound. That would have to be ascertained\r\nfrom the surgeon who actually did the tracheotomy.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, some ecchymosis or contusion, of the muscles of the\r\nright anterior neck inferiorly, without, however, any disruption of the\r\nmuscles or any significant tearing of the muscles.\r\n\r\nThe muscles in this area of the body run roughly, as you see as he\r\ndepicted them here. We have removed some of them for a point I will\r\nmake in a moment, but it is our opinion that the missile traversed\r\nthe neck and slid between these muscles and other vital structures\r\nwith a course in the neck such as the carotid artery, the jugular vein\r\nand other structures because there was no massive hemorrhage or other\r\nmassive injury in this portion of the neck.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to relate findings within the President's body to this\r\nwound which we had observed low in his neck, we then opened his chest\r\ncavity, and we very carefully examined the lining of his chest cavity\r\nand both of his lungs. We found that there was, in fact, no defect in\r\nthe pleural lining of the President's chest.\r\n\r\nIt was completely intact.\r\n\r\nHowever, over the apex of the right pleural cavity, and the pleura now\r\nhas two layers. It has a parietal or a layer which lines the chest\r\ncavity and it has a visceral layer which is intimately in association\r\nwith the lung.\r\n\r\nAs depicted in figure 385, in the apex of the right pleural cavity\r\nthere was a bruise or contusion or ecchmymosis of the parietal pleura\r\nas well as a bruise of the upper portion, the most apical portion of\r\nthe right lung.\r\n\r\nIt, therefore, was our opinion that the missile while not penetrating\r\nphysically the pleural cavity, as it passed that point bruised either\r\nthe missile itself, or the force of its passage through the tissues,\r\nbruised both the parietal and the visceral pleura.\r\n\r\nThe area of discoloration on the apical portion of the right upper lung\r\nmeasured five centimeters in greatest diameter, and was wedge shaped in\r\nconfiguration, with its base toward the top of the chest and its apex\r\ndown towards the substance of the lung.\r\n\r\nOnce again Kodachrome photographs were made of this area in the\r\ninterior of the President's chest.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you mark the point on Exhibit 385, the one on the\r\nrear of the President as point \"C\" and the one on the front of the\r\nPresident as point \"D\" so we can discuss those, Dr. Humes?\r\n\r\nNow, what conclusion did you reach, if any, as to whether point \"C\" was\r\nthe point of entry or exit?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. We reached the conclusion that point \"C\" was a point\r\nof entry.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What characteristics of that wound led you to that\r\nconclusion?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The characteristics here were basically similar to\r\nthe characteristics above, lacking one very valuable clue or piece of\r\nevidence rather than clue, because it is more truly a piece of evidence\r\nin the skull. The skull as I mentioned before had the bone with the\r\ncharacteristic defect made as a missile traverses bone.\r\n\r\nThis missile, to the best of our ability to ascertain, struck no bone\r\nprotuberances, no bony prominences, no bones as it traversed the\r\nPresident's body. But it was a sharply delineated wound. It was quite\r\nregular in its outline. It measured, as I mentioned, 7 by 4 mm. Its\r\nmargins were similar in all respects when viewed with the naked eye to\r\nthe wound in the skull, which we feel incontrovertibly was a wound of\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\nThe defect in the fascia which is that layer of connective tissue over\r\nthe muscle just beneath the wound corresponded virtually exactly to the\r\ndefect in the skin.\r\n\r\nAnd for these reasons we felt that this was a wound of entrance.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you search the body to determine if there was any\r\nbullet inside the body?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Before the arrival of Colonel Finck we had made X-rays\r\nof the head, neck and torso of the President, and the upper portions\r\nof his major extremities, or both his upper and lower extremities. At\r\nColonel Finck's suggestion, we then completed the X-ray examination by\r\nX-raying the President's body in toto, and those X-rays are available.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did those X-rays disclose with respect to the\r\npossible presence of a missile in the President's body?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. They showed no evidence of a missile in the\r\nPresident's body at any point. And these were examined by ourselves and\r\nby the radiologist, who assisted us in this endeavor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What conclusion, if any, did you reach as to whether point\r\n\"D\" on 385 was the point of entrance or exit?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. We concluded that this missile depicted in 385 \"C\"\r\nwhich entered the President's body traversed the President's body and\r\nmade its exit through the wound observed by the physicians at Parkland\r\nHospital and later extended as a tracheotomy wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does the description \"ragged wound\" which is found in the\r\nParkland report shed any light in and of itself as to whether point \"D\"\r\nis an exit or entry wound?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I believe, sir, that that statement goes on, ragged\r\nwound in the trachea. I don't believe that refers to the skin. And you\r\nmight say that it is a ragged wound is more likely to be a wound of\r\nexit.\r\n\r\nHowever, the trachea has little cartilaginous rings which have a\r\ntendency, which would be disrupted by this, and most wounds of the\r\ntrachea unless very cleverly incised would perhaps appear slightly\r\nragged.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, what was the angle, if any, that you observed on the\r\npath of the bullet, as you outlined it?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The angle which we observed in measuring, in comparing\r\nthe point of entrance, our point of entrance labeled \"C\" on 385 and\r\n\"D\" point of exit is one that the point of exit is below the point of\r\nentrance compared with the vertical.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you had an opportunity to examine the clothing which\r\nhas been identified for you as being that worn by the President on the\r\nday of the assassination?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes; yesterday, just shortly before the Commission\r\nhearing today was begun, Mr. Chief Justice, we had opportunity for the\r\nfirst time to examine the clothing worn by the late President.\r\n\r\nIn private conversation among ourselves before this opportunity, we\r\npredicted we would find defects in the clothing corresponding with the\r\ndefects which were found, of course, on the body of the late President.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Commission, I would\r\nlike to have identified for the record three articles on which I\r\nhave placed Commission Exhibits Nos. 393 being the coat worn by the\r\nPresident, 394 being the shirt, and 395 being the President's tie, and\r\nat this time move for their admission into evidence.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The articles of clothing referred to were marked Commission Exhibits\r\nNos. 393, 394 and 395 for identification, and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Taking 393 at the start, Doctor Humes, will you describe\r\nfor the record what hole, if any, is observable in the back of that\r\ngarment which would be at or about the spot you have described as being\r\nthe point of entry on the President's back or lower neck.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir. This exhibit is a grey suit coat stated to\r\nhave been worn by the President on the day of his death. Situated to\r\nthe right of the midline high in the back portion of the coat is a\r\ndefect, one margin of which is semicircular.\r\n\r\nSituated above it just below the collar is an additional defect. It is\r\nour opinion that the lower of these defects corresponds essentially\r\nwith the point of entrance of the missile at Point C on Exhibit 385.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would it be accurate to state that the hole which you have\r\nidentified as being the point of entry is approximately 6 inches below\r\nthe top of the collar, and 2 inches to the right of the middle seam of\r\nthe coat?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. That is approximately correct, sir. This defect, I\r\nmight say, continues on through the material.\r\n\r\nAttached to this garment is the memorandum which states that one half\r\nof the area around the hole which was presented had been removed\r\nby experts, I believe, at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and\r\nalso that a control area was taken from under the collar, so it is\r\nmy interpretation that this defect at the top of this garment is the\r\ncontrol area taken by the Bureau, and that the reason the lower defect\r\nis not more circle or oval in outline is because a portion of that\r\ndefect has been removed apparently for physical examinations.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, does the one which you have described as the entry of\r\nthe bullet go all the way through?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; it goes through both layers.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about the upper one of the collar you have described,\r\ndoes that go all the way through?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; it goes all the way through. It is not--wait\r\na minute, excuse me--it is not so clearly a puncture wound as the one\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does the upper one go all the way through in the same\r\ncourse?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Through the inner side as it went through the outer side?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. No, in an irregular fashion.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you take Commission Exhibit 394 and describe what\r\nthat is, first of all, please?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. This is the shirt, blood-stained shirt, purportedly\r\nworn by the President on the day of his assassination. When viewed\r\nfrom behind at a point which corresponds essentially with the point of\r\ndefect on the jacket, one sees an irregularly oval defect.\r\n\r\nWhen viewed anteriorly, with the top button buttoned, two additional\r\ndefects are seen. Of course, with the shirt buttoned, the fly front\r\nof the shirt causes two layers of cloth to be present in this\r\nlocation, and that there is a defect in the inner layer of cloth and a\r\ncorresponding defect in the outer layer of the cloth.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there any observable indication from the fibers on the\r\nfront side of the shirt to indicate in which direction a missile might\r\nhave passed through those two tears?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. From an examination of these defects at this point, it\r\nwould appear that the missile traversed these two layers from within to\r\nthe exterior.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would it be accurate to state that the hole in the back of\r\nthe shirt is approximately 6 inches below the top of the collar and 2\r\ninches to the right of the middle seam of the shirt?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. That is approximately correct, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, how, if at all, do the holes in the shirt and coat\r\nconform to the wound of entrance which you described as point \"C\" on\r\nCommission Exhibit 385?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. We believe that they conform quite well. When\r\nviewing--first of all, the wounds or the defects in 393 and 394\r\ncoincide virtually exactly with one another.\r\n\r\nThey give the appearance when viewed separately and not as part of the\r\nclothing of a clothed person as being perhaps, somewhat lower on the\r\nExhibits 393 and 394 than we have depicted them in Exhibit No. 385. We\r\nbelieve there are two reasons for this.\r\n\r\n385 is a schematic representation, and the photographs would be more\r\naccurate as to the precise location, but more particularly the way in\r\nwhich these defects would conform with such a defect on the torso would\r\ndepend on the girth of the shoulders and configuration of the base of\r\nthe neck of the individual, and the relative position of the shirt\r\nand coat to the tissues of the body at the time of the impact of the\r\nmissile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As to the muscular status of the President, what was it?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The President was extremely well-developed, an\r\nextremely well-developed, muscular young man with a very well-developed\r\nset of muscles in his thoraco and shoulder girdle.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What effect would that have on the positioning of the\r\nshirt and coat with respect to the position of the neck in and about\r\nthe seam?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I believe this would have a tendency to push the\r\nportions of the coat which show the defects here somewhat higher on the\r\nback of the President than on a man of less muscular development.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Commission, I would\r\nlike to mark for identification Exhibit 396, which later proof will\r\nshow is a picture of President Kennedy shortly before the first bullet\r\nstruck him, and ask the doctor to take a look at that.\r\n\r\nWill you describe, Doctor Humes, the position of President Kennedy's\r\nright hand in that picture?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes. This exhibit, Commission Exhibit No. 396,\r\nallegedly taken just prior to the wounding of the late President, shows\r\nhim with his hand raised, his elbow bent, apparently in saluting the\r\ncrowd. I believe that this action----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which hand was that?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. This was his right hand, sir. I believe that this\r\naction would further accentuate the elevation of the coat and the shirt\r\nwith respect to the back of the President.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now. Doctor Humes, will you take Commission Exhibit No.\r\n395----\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Before you go, may I ask a question? In your examination of\r\nthe shirt, I just want to get it in the record, from your examination\r\nof the shirt, there is no defect in the collar of the shirt which\r\ncoincides with the defect in the back of the President's coat, am I\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. You are correct, sir. There is no such defect.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As to Commission Exhibit 395, Dr. Humes, will you identify\r\nwhat that is, please?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. We had an opportunity to examine this exhibit before\r\nthe Commission met today, sir. This is Commission Exhibit No. 395, and\r\nis the neck tie purportedly worn, purportedly to have been worn, by the\r\nlate President on the day of his assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What defect, if any, is noted on the tie which would\r\ncorrespond with the path of a missile apparently passing through the\r\nfolds of the shirt which you have already described?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. This tie is one of those--this tie is still in its\r\nknotted state, as we examine it at this time. The portion of the tie\r\naround the neck has been severed apparently with scissors or other\r\nsharp instrument accounting for the loop about the neck.\r\n\r\nThe tie is tied in four-in-hand fashion but somewhat askew from the way\r\na person would normally tie a four-in-hand knot.\r\n\r\nSituated on the left anterior aspect of this knotted portion of the\r\ntie at a point approximately corresponding with the defects noted\r\npreviously in the two layers of the shirt is a superficial tear of the\r\nouter layer only of the fabric of this tie which, I believe, could have\r\nbeen caused by a glancing blow to this portion of the tie by a missile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, I move at this time for the admission\r\ninto evidence of Exhibits 393 through Exhibit 396, the three articles\r\nof clothing and the photograph which we have just used.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. They may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(Exhibits Nos. 393 through 396 were received in evidence and may be\r\nfound in the Commission files.)\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Commander, did you say left or right?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. No, sir. In fact, the way this bow is tied now it\r\nwould appear to be on the left of this tie, but it is kind of twisted\r\nout of shape.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Yes. It is twisted. It is not too clear.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. It is not too clear, it is not clear how that might\r\nhave been in position with the shirt, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, Doctor Humes, at one point in your examination of the\r\nPresident, did you make an effort to probe the point of entry with your\r\nfinger?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at or about that time when you were trying to\r\nascertain, as you previously testified, whether there was any missile\r\nin the body of the President, did someone from the Secret Service call\r\nyour attention to the fact that a bullet had been found on a stretcher\r\nat Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; they did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And in that posture of your examination, having just\r\nlearned of the presence of a bullet on a stretcher, did that call to\r\nyour mind any tentative explanatory theory of the point of entry or\r\nexit of the bullet which you have described as entering at Point \"C\" on\r\nExhibit 385?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir. We were able to ascertain with absolute\r\ncertainty that the bullet had passed by the apical portion of the right\r\nlung producing the injury which we mentioned.\r\n\r\nI did not at that point have the information from Doctor Perry\r\nabout the wound in the anterior neck, and while that was a possible\r\nexplanation for the point of exit, we also had to consider the\r\npossibility that the missile in some rather inexplicable fashion had\r\nbeen stopped in its path through the President's body and, in fact,\r\nthen had fallen from the body onto the stretcher.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what theory did you think possible, at that juncture,\r\nto explain the passing of the bullet back out the point of entry; or\r\nhad you been provided with the fact that external heart massage had\r\nbeen performed on the President?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; we had, and we considered the possibility\r\nthat some of the physical maneuvering performed by the doctors might\r\nhave in some way caused this event to take place.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, have you since discounted that possibility, Doctor\r\nHumes?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes; in essence we have. When examining the wounds\r\nin the base of the President's neck anteriorly, the region of the\r\ntracheotomy performed at Parkland Hospital, we noted, and we noted in\r\nour record, some contusion and bruising of the muscles of the neck of\r\nthe President. We noted that at the time of the postmortem examination.\r\n\r\nNow, we also made note of the types of wounds which I mentioned to you\r\nbefore in this testimony on the chest which were going to be used by\r\nthe doctors there to place chest tubes. They also made other wounds,\r\none on the left arm, and a wound on the ankle of the President with\r\nthe idea of administering intravenous blood and other fluids in hope\r\nof replacing the blood which the President had lost from his extensive\r\nwounds.\r\n\r\nThose wounds showed no evidence of bruising or contusion or physical\r\nviolence, which made us reach the conclusion that they were performed\r\nduring the agonal moments of the late president, and when the\r\ncirculation was, in essence, very seriously embarrassed, if not\r\nnonfunctional. So that these wounds, the wound of the chest and the\r\nwound of the arm and of the ankle were performed about the same time as\r\nthe tracheotomy wound because only a very few moments of time elapsed\r\nwhen all this was going on.\r\n\r\nSo, therefore, we reached the conclusion that the damage to these\r\nmuscles on the anterior neck just below this wound were received at\r\napproximately the same time that the wound here on the top of the\r\npleural cavity was, while the President still lived and while his heart\r\nand lungs were operating in such a fashion to permit him to have a\r\nbruise in the vicinity, because that he did have in these strap muscles\r\nin the neck, but he didn't have in the areas of the other incisions\r\nthat were made at Parkland Hospital. So we feel that, had this missile\r\nnot made its path in that fashion, the wound made by Doctor Perry in\r\nthe neck would not have been able to produce, wouldn't have been able\r\nto produce, these contusions of the musculature of the neck.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask a question about the missile, I am a little\r\nbit--the bullet, I am a little bit--confused. It was found on the\r\nstretcher. Did the President's body remain on the stretcher while it\r\nwas in the hospital?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Of that point I have no knowledge. The only----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Why would it--would this operating have anything to do with\r\nthe bullet being on the stretcher unless the President's body remained\r\non the stretcher after he was taken into the hospital; is that possible?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. It is quite possible, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Otherwise it seems to me the bullet would have to have been\r\nejected from the body before he was taken or put on the bed in the\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Right, sir. I, of course, was not there. I don't know\r\nhow he was handled in the hospital, in what conveyance. I do know he\r\nwas on his back during the period of his stay in the hospital; Doctor\r\nPerry told me that.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes; and wasn't turned over.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. So he might have been on the stretcher the whole time, is\r\nthat your view?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. He said he had no view. He wasn't there, he doesn't know\r\nanything about it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes. I wonder if there is other evidence of this.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. There has been other evidence, Mr. Dulles. If I may say\r\nat this point, we shall produce later, subject to sequential proof,\r\nevidence that the stretcher on which this bullet was found was the\r\nstretcher of Governor Connally. We have a sequence of events on the\r\ntransmission of that stretcher which ties that down reasonably closely,\r\nso that on the night of the autopsy itself, as the information I have\r\nbeen developing indicates, the thought preliminarily was that was from\r\nPresident Kennedy's stretcher, and that is what led to the hypothesis\r\nwhich we have been exploring about, but which has since been rejected.\r\nBut at any rate the evidence will show that it was from Governor\r\nConnally's stretcher that the bullet was found.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. So this bullet is still missing?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That is the subject of some theories I am about to get\r\ninto. That is an elusive subject, but Dr. Humes has some views on it,\r\nand we might just as well go into those now.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Before he gets into that, may I ask a question?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Surely, go right ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Quite apart from the President's clothing, now directing\r\nyour attention to the flight of the bullet, quite apart from the\r\nevidence given by the President's clothing, you, I believe, indicated\r\nthat the flight of the bullet was from the back, from above and behind.\r\nIt took roughly the line which is shown on your Exhibit 385.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I am not clear what induced you to come to that conclusion\r\nif you couldn't find the actual exit wound by reason of the tracheotomy.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The report which we have submitted, sir, represents\r\nour thinking within the 24-48 hours of the death of the President, all\r\nfacts taken into account of the situation.\r\n\r\nThe wound in the anterior portion of the lower neck is physically lower\r\nthan the point of entrance posteriorly, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. That is what I wanted to bring out.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. May I ask this: In spite of the incision made by the\r\ntracheotomy, was there any evidence left of the exit aperture?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Unfortunately not that we could ascertain, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. There is no evidence in the coat or the shirt of an exit\r\nthrough the coat or shirt.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. There is no exit through the coat, sir. But these two,\r\nin the shirt, of course--excuse me, sir--there is. The entrance by our\r\ncalculations----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The entrance I know.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Posteriorly.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What about the exit?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The exit wounds are just below.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But there was no coat to exit through.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. No; anteriorly the coat was quite open.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask a question?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir, Senator.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Assuming that we draw a straight line from Point \"C\"\r\nwhich you have described as a possible point of entry of the missile,\r\nto Point \"D\" where you saw an incision of the tracheotomy----\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What would be the relation of the bruise at the apex of\r\nthe pleural sac to such a line?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. It would be exactly in line with such a line, sir,\r\nexactly.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What was the character of the bruise that you saw there?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The bruise here, photographs are far superior to my\r\nhumble verbal description, but if I let my hand in cup shaped fashion\r\nrepresent the apical parietal pleura, it was an area approximately 5\r\ncm. in greatest diameter of purplish blue discoloration of the parietal\r\npleura. Corresponding exactly with it, with the lung sitting below it,\r\nwas a roughly pyramid-shaped bruise with its base toward the surface of\r\nthe upper portion of the lung, and the apex down into the lung tissue,\r\nand the whole thing measured about 5 cm., which is a little--2 inches\r\nin extent, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What would be the--can you describe the covering around\r\nthe apex of the pleural sac, the nature of its protection. My point is\r\nto get your opinion as to whether some other factor, some factor other\r\nthan the missile could have caused this bruise which you saw.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. A couple of ways we might do this, sir. One with\r\nregard to temporal, it was quite fresh. When examined under the\r\nmicroscope, the lung in this area had recent hemorrhaging in it. The\r\nred blood cells were well-preserved, as they would be if it happened\r\nquite recently before death, as was the red blood cells where they had\r\ngotten out into the lung tissue near there.\r\n\r\nThe discoloration was essentially of the same character as the\r\ndiscoloration in the muscles adjacent thereto, which would roughly\r\nagain place it temporally in approximately the same time since bruises\r\nchange color as time goes by, and these appeared quite fresh.\r\n\r\nThis is with regard to time--I don't know whether that is the right\r\nparameter in which you wished to study it, Senator.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. My question really went to this point: Considering the\r\nlocation of the bruise at the apex of the pleural sac----\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. And of the tissue or muscles around it, was there any\r\nother factor which you could think of that might have caused that\r\nbruise other than the passage of a missile?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. It was so well localized that I truthfully, sir, can't\r\nthink of any other way.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. That is all.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. May I ask you one question which, perhaps, the answer is\r\nquite obvious. If, contrary to the evidence that we have here, that\r\nanterior wound was the wound of entry, the shot must have come from\r\nbelow the President to have followed that path.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. That course, that is correct, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Humes, can you compare the angles of declination on\r\n385, point \"C\" to \"D\", with 388 \"A\" to \"B\"?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. You will note, and again I must apologize for the\r\nschematic nature of these diagrams drawn to a certain extent from\r\nmemory and to a certain extent from the written record, it would appear\r\nthat the angle of declination is somewhat sharper in the head wound,\r\n388, than it is in 385.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this, we feel, by the pattern of the entrance wound at\r\n388 \"A\" causes us to feel that the President's head was bent forward,\r\nand we feel this accounts for the difference in the angle, plus\r\nundoubtedly the wounds were not received absolutely simultaneously, so\r\nthat the vehicle in which the President was traveling moved during this\r\nperiod of time, which would account for a difference in the line of\r\nflight, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Aside from the slight differences which are notable by\r\nobserving those two exhibits, are they roughly comparable to the angle\r\nof decline?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I believe them to be roughly comparable, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you state for the record an approximation of the\r\nangle of decline?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Mathematics is not my forte. Approximately 45 degrees\r\nfrom the horizontal.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you elaborate somewhat, Doctor Humes, on why the\r\nangle would change by virtue of a tilting of the head of the President\r\nsince the basis of the computation of angle is with respect to the\r\nground?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I find the question a little difficult of answering\r\nright off, forgive me, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I will try to rephrase it. Stated more simply, why would\r\nthe tilting of the President's head affect the angle of the decline?\r\nYou stated that was----\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The angle that I am making an observation most\r\nabout is the angle made that we envisioned having been made by the\r\nimpingement of the bullet in its flight at the point of entry. This\r\nangle we see by the difference of the measurement of the two wounds.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this is--we have several angles we are talking about here,\r\nunfortunately, this is--the angle of which we speak in this location,\r\n\"A\" to \"B\", and it is difficult.\r\n\r\nI have to retract. Since we feel from their physical configurations,\r\nwounds 385 \"C\" and 388 \"A\" are entrance wounds, if there wasn't some\r\nsignificant change in the angulation of the President's head with\r\nrespect to the line of flight from these missiles, the physical\r\nmeasurements of 385 \"C\" and this 388 \"A\" should be similar. They\r\naren't, in fact, dissimilar in that there is a greater angulation in\r\n388 \"A\". Therefore, there has to be either a change in the position\r\nof the vehicle in which the President is riding with respect to the\r\nhorizontal or a change in the situation of the President's head. I\r\nbelieve that the exhibits submitted earlier, the photograph----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I believe the ones were given to you so far--excuse me,\r\nyou are right, 389.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. 389, in fact at this point shows the President's head\r\nin a slightly inclined forward position, and I am not enough aware of\r\nthe geography of the ground over which the vehicle was traveling to\r\nknow how much that would affect it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. If you were to be told that there was a distance traversed\r\nof approximately 150 feet from the time of Point \"C\" on 385 to Point\r\n\"A\" on 388, and you would assume the additional factor that there was\r\na slight angle of decline on the street as well, would those factors,\r\nassuming them to be true, help in the explanation of the differences in\r\nthe angles?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I think that they would make the figure as depicted in\r\n388 quite understandably different from 385.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was it possible, in view of the condition of the brain to\r\npoint with absolute accuracy to the point of exit there? I can see\r\nthat the point of exit in 385 can be clearly determined. Is it equally\r\npossible to determine the point of exit in 388?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. No, sir; it was not, other than through this large\r\ndefect because when----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Therefore, that angle might be somewhat different.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Might be somewhat different, sir. I think we made\r\nreference to that somewhat earlier. The fragments were so difficult to\r\nreplace in their precise anatomic location----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is what I thought, but I wasn't sure.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I would like to ask a question in regard to 385 similar to\r\nthat I asked as to 388. In your opinion, was the 385 wound lethal?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. With the wound in 385, would it have affected the\r\nPresident's power of speech?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. It could have, sir. The wound caused a defect in his\r\ntrachea which would most usually have caused at least some defect in\r\nthe proper phonation, sir.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. On the record.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In response to Mr. Dulles' question a moment ago, Doctor\r\nHumes, you commented that they did not turn him over at Parkland. Will\r\nyou state for the record what the source of your information is on that?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes. This is a result of a personal telephone\r\nconversation between myself and Dr. Malcolm Perry early in the morning\r\nof Saturday, November 23.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At that time did Doctor Perry tell you specifically,\r\nDoctor Humes, that the Parkland doctors had not observed the wound in\r\nthe President's back?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. He told me that the President was on his back from the\r\ntime he was brought into the hospital until the time he left it, and\r\nthat at no time was he turned from his back by the doctors.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at the time of your conversation with Doctor Perry did\r\nyou tell Doctor Perry anything of your observations or conclusions?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. No, sir; I did not.\r\n\r\n(A short recess was taken.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Gentlemen, the Commission will be in order. We will\r\ncontinue with the examination.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Doctor Humes, as to points of entry on the body of the\r\nlate President, how many were there in total?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Two, sir, as depicted in 385-C and 388-A.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And to points of exit, how many were there?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Two, sir, as depicted in 385-D and the vicinity\r\nof 388-B. I make the latter remark as was developed earlier, in\r\nthat the size of the large defect in the skull was so great and the\r\nfragmentation was so complex that it was impossible to accurately\r\npinpoint the exit of the missile in the head wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now as to that last factor, would the X-rays be of\r\nmaterial assistance to you in pinpointing the specific locale of the\r\nexit?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I do not believe so, sir. The only path that the\r\nX-rays show in any detail are of the minor fragments which passed from\r\npoint A to point B.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now that you have finished your major descriptions of\r\nthe wounds, can you be any more specific in telling us in what way\r\nthe availability of the x-rays would assist in further specifying the\r\nnature of the wounds?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I do not believe, sir, that the availability of the\r\nX-rays would materially assist the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about the same question as to the pictures?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The pictures would show more accurately and in more\r\ndetail the character of the wounds as depicted particularly in 385 and\r\n386 and in 388-A. They would also perhaps give the Commissioners a\r\nbetter--better is not the best term, but a more graphic picture of the\r\nmassive defect in 388.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Going back for a moment, Doctor Humes----\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Before we get off that, may I ask you this, Commander: If\r\nwe had the pictures here and you could look them over again and restate\r\nyour opinion, would it cause you to change any of the testimony you\r\nhave given here?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. To the best of my recollection, Mr. Chief Justice, it\r\nwould not.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. McCloy.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. May I ask this question?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Go right ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Do you have any knowledge as to whether or not any\r\nphotographs were taken in Dallas?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I have none, sir, no knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. No knowledge that any were taken?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. May I ask what size are the pictures to which you\r\nrefer?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. We exposed both black and white and color negatives,\r\nCongressman. They were exposed in the morgue during the examination.\r\nThey were not developed. The kodachrome negatives when developed would\r\nbe 405. They were in film carriers or cassettes, as were the black and\r\nwhite. Of course they could be magnified.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Have those been examined by personnel at Bethesda?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. No, sir. We exposed these negatives; we turned them\r\nover. Here I must ask the counsel again for advice--to the Secret\r\nService.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes; it was the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. They were turned over to the Secret Service in their\r\ncassettes unexposed, and I have not seen any of them since. This is the\r\nphotographs. The X-rays were developed in our X-ray department on the\r\nspot that evening, because we had to see those right then as part of\r\nour examination, but the photographs were made for the record and for\r\nother purposes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But they had never been actually developed for\r\nviewing.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I do not know, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Doctor Humes, back to the angles for just a moment.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Hypothesize or assume, if you will, that other evidence\r\nwill show that the wound inflicted on Commission Exhibit 385 at point\r\nC occurred while the President was riding in the rear seat of his\r\nautomobile approximately 100 feet from a point of origin in a six-floor\r\nbuilding nearby, and assume further that the wound inflicted in 388 at\r\npoint A occurred when the President was approximately 250 feet away\r\nfrom the same point.\r\n\r\nWith those assumptions in mind, there would be somewhat different\r\nangles of declination going from C to D on 385 and from A to B on 388.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I would expect there would.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You have already testified earlier today that you were\r\nunable to pinpoint with precision angle A to B on 388 because of the\r\nreconstruction of the scalp.\r\n\r\nNow my question to you, in that elongated fashion, is from what you\r\nknow and what you have described, are the angles, as you have expressed\r\nthem to be in your opinion, consistent with a situation where the two\r\nwounds were inflicted at the angles and at the distances just described\r\nto you?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I believe they are consistent. I would state that the\r\npath outlined on 388-A to B is to a certain extent conjectural for the\r\nreasons given before.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, Doctor Humes, I hand you a group of documents which\r\nhave been marked as Commission Exhibit No. 397 and ask you if you can\r\nidentify what they are?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; these are various notes in long-hand, or\r\ncopies rather, of various notes in long-hand made by myself, in part,\r\nduring the performance of the examination of the late President, and in\r\npart after the examination when I was preparing to have a typewritten\r\nreport made.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there also included there some notes that you made\r\nwhile you talked to Doctor Perry on the telephone?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; there are.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there any notes which you made at any time which are\r\nnot included in this group of notes?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; there are.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what do those consist of?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. In privacy of my own home, early in the morning of\r\nSunday, November 24th, I made a draft of this report which I later\r\nrevised, and of which this represents the revision. That draft I\r\npersonally burned in the fireplace of my recreation room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that the Exhibit No. 397 is the\r\nidentical document which has been previously identified as Commission\r\nNo. 371 for our internal purposes.\r\n\r\nIs the first sheet then in that group the notes you made when you\r\ntalked to Doctor Perry?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. That is correct, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do the next 15 sheets represent the rough draft which\r\nwas later copied into the autopsy report which has been heretofore\r\nidentified with an exhibit number?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. That is correct, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what do the next two sheets represent?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The next two sheets are the notes actually made in the\r\nroom in which the examination was taking place. I notice now that the\r\nhandwriting in some instances is not my own, and it is either that of\r\nCommander Boswell or Colonel Finck.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was that writing made at the same time that the\r\nautopsy report was undertaken; that is, did you review all of the\r\nmarkings on those papers and note them to be present when you completed\r\nthe autopsy report?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir. From the time of the completion of this\r\nexamination until the submission of the written report following its\r\npreparation, all of the papers pertinent to this case were in my\r\npersonal custody.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now described all of the documents which were\r\npresent in that 397, Exhibit No. 397?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; with the exception of the certification\r\nto the fact that I, in fact, detailed them in my custody, and a\r\ncertification that I had destroyed certain preliminary draft notes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And these represent all the notes except those you have\r\nalready described which you destroyed?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. That is correct, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, just one point on the notes themselves. Page 14 of\r\nyour rough draft, Doctor Humes, as to the point of origin, the notes\r\nshow that there was a revision between your first draft and your final\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you first of all read into the record the final\r\nconclusion reflected in your final report.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I would rather read it from the final report. The\r\nfinal report reads:\r\n\r\n\"The projectiles were fired from a point behind and somewhat above the\r\nlevel of the deceased.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did the first draft of that sentence as shown on\r\npage 14 of your rough draft state?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. It stated as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The projectiles were fired from a point behind and somewhat above a\r\nhorizontal line to the vertical position of the body at the moment of\r\nimpact.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now would you state the reason for making that\r\nmodification between draft and final report, please?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. This examination, as I have indicated, was performed\r\nby myself with my two associates. The notes which we have just admitted\r\nas an exhibit are in my own hand and are my opinion, was my opinion at\r\nthat time, as to the best way to present the facts which we had gleaned\r\nduring this period.\r\n\r\nBefore submitting it to the typist, I went over this with great care\r\nwith my two associates. One or the other of them raised the point\r\nthat perhaps this sentence would state more than what was absolutely\r\nfact based upon our observations, pointing out that we did not know\r\nprecisely at that time in what position the body of the President was\r\nwhen the missiles struck, and that therefore we should be somewhat\r\nless specific and somewhat more circumspect than the way we stated it.\r\nWhen I considered this suggestion, I agreed that it would be better to\r\nchange it as noted, and accordingly, I did so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, I move now for the admission into\r\nevidence of Exhibit No. 397.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The documents, previously marked Exhibit No. 397 for identification,\r\nwere received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. May I ask one question about the notes? The notes that you\r\nmade contemporaneously with your examination, you said you put those\r\ndown and then you put some in later. How much later were the notes,\r\nwithin the best of your recollection of the final notes made, not the\r\nfinal report, but the final notes that you made in your own handwriting?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The examination was concluded approximately at 11\r\no'clock on the night of November 22. The final changes in the notes\r\nprior to the typing of the report were made, and I will have to give\r\nyou the time because whatever time Mr. Oswald was shot, that is\r\nabout when I finished. I was working in an office, and someone had a\r\ntelevision on and came in and told me that Mr. Oswald had been shot,\r\nand that was around noon on Sunday, November 24th.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, I have now marked another photograph\r\nas the next exhibit number, Commission Exhibit 398. May I say to the\r\nCommission that this is a photograph which, subject to later proof,\r\nwill show it to be taken immediately after the President was struck by\r\nthe first bullet.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be marked.\r\n\r\n(The photograph was marked Commission Exhibit No. 398 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMay I move for its admission into evidence at this time for this\r\npurpose?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The photograph, previously marked Commission Exhibit No. 398 for\r\nidentification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nLooking at Commission Exhibit 398, Doctor Humes, with that as a\r\nbackground, have you had an opportunity to review the medical reports\r\non Governor Connally at Parkland Hospital in Commission Exhibit 392?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you noted the wounds which he sustained on his right\r\nwrist, that is, Governor Connally's right wrist?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir; I have noted the report of it in these\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What does the report show as to those wounds on the right\r\nwrist?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The report shows a wound of entrance on the dorsal\r\naspect of the right wrist. Let's get the precise point here. The wound\r\nof entry is described as on the dorsal aspect of the right wrist above\r\nthe junction of the distal fourth of the radius and the shaft. It was\r\napproximately two centimeters in length and rather oblique, with the\r\nloss of tissue, and some considerable contusions at the margins. There\r\nwas a wound of exit along the volar surface of the wrist about two\r\ncentimeters above the flexion crease of the wrist in the midline.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Doctor Humes, I show you a bullet which we have marked as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 399, and may I say now that, subject to later\r\nproof, this is the missile which has been taken from the stretcher\r\nwhich the evidence now indicates was the stretcher occupied by Governor\r\nConnally.\r\n\r\nI move for its admission into evidence at this time.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The article, previously marked Commission Exhibit No. 399 for\r\nidentification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. We have been asked by the FBI that the missile not be\r\nhandled by anybody because it is undergoing further ballistic tests,\r\nand it now appears, may the record show, in a plastic case in a cotton\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\nNow looking at that bullet, Exhibit 399, Doctor Humes, could that\r\nbullet have gone through or been any part of the fragment passing\r\nthrough President Kennedy's head in Exhibit No. 388?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I do not believe so, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And could that missile have made the wound on Governor\r\nConnally's right wrist?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I think that that is most unlikely. May I expand on\r\nthose two answers?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, please do.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. The X-rays made of the wound in the head of the late\r\nPresident showed fragmentations of the missile. Some fragments we\r\nrecovered and turned over, as has been previously noted. Also we have\r\nX-rays of the fragment of skull which was in the region of our opinion\r\nexit wound showing metallic fragments.\r\n\r\nAlso going to Exhibit 392, the report from Parkland Hospital, the\r\nfollowing sentence referring to the examination of the wound of the\r\nwrist is found:\r\n\r\n\"Small bits of metal were encountered at various levels throughout\r\nthe wound, and these were, wherever they were identified and could be\r\npicked up, picked up and submitted to the pathology department for\r\nidentification and examination.\"\r\n\r\nThe reason I believe it most unlikely that this missile could have\r\ninflicted either of these wounds is that this missile is basically\r\nintact; its jacket appears to me to be intact, and I do not understand\r\nhow it could possibly have left fragments in either of these locations.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What wounds did Governor Connally sustain in his chest\r\narea, based upon the records of Parkland Hospital, which you have\r\nexamined, Doctor Humes?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Governor Connally received in his chest a wound of\r\nentrance just--this is again from 392--\"just lateral to the right\r\nscapula close to the axilla which had passed through the lattisimus\r\ndorsi muscle, shattered approximately ten centimeters of a lateral and\r\nanterior portion of the right fifth rib, and emerged below the right\r\nnipple anterially.\"\r\n\r\nThese were the wounds of the chest of Governor Connally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now assuming that there were only three missiles fired,\r\nand bearing in mind the positions of President Kennedy and Governor\r\nConnally from the photograph marked Commission Exhibit 398, do you\r\nhave an opinion as to the source of the missiles which inflicted the\r\nwound on President Kennedy marked 385-C to D, and the wound in Governor\r\nConnally's chest which you have just referred to?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes. I would preface this statement by the following:\r\nAs I testified earlier in the afternoon, as much as we could ascertain\r\nfrom our X-rays and physical examinations, this missile struck no bony\r\nstructures in traversing the body of the late President. Therefore, I\r\nbelieve it was moving at its exit from the President's body at only\r\nvery slightly less than that velocity, so it was still traveling at\r\ngreat speed.\r\n\r\nI believe in looking at Exhibit 398, which purports to be at\r\napproximately the time the President was struck, I see that Governor\r\nConnally is sitting directly in front of the late President, and\r\nsuggest the possibility that this missile, having traversed the low\r\nneck of the late President, in fact traversed the chest of Governor\r\nConnally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How much of the velocity, if any, or would there be an\r\nappreciable diminution of the velocity of the projectile on passing\r\nthrough the portions of President Kennedy's body which you have\r\ndescribed?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I would have to defer to my associate, Colonel Finck,\r\nfor an opinion about this.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Fine. As to any damage to the rib which you described\r\nGovernor Connally sustained, would that impact or trauma be consistent\r\nwith the markings which are shown on Exhibit 399?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I think it quite possible. Here I think if this point\r\nwere to be explored further, a most valuable piece of evidence would be\r\nan X-ray of the chest of Governor Connally, because I believe that this\r\nmissile could have struck the rib a glancing blow.\r\n\r\nThe rib is a rather rigid structure, and the missile would not have\r\nto strike it directly to cause the fracture that was described, and\r\nthe fracture is not very clearly described to me, and if an X-ray, for\r\ninstance, showed no metallic fragments in the chest of the Governor,\r\nI would think it quite likely that this was the missile that had\r\ntraversed his chest, because I doubt if this missile would have left\r\nbehind it any metallic fragments from its physical appearance at this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could that missile have traversed Governor Connally's\r\nchest without having him know it immediately or instantaneously?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I believe so. I have heard reports, and have been told\r\nby my professional associates of any number of instances where people\r\nreceived penetrating wounds in various portions of the body and have\r\nonly the sensation of a slight discomfort or slight slap or some other\r\nminor difficulty from such a missile wound. I am sure he would be aware\r\nthat something happened to him, but that he was shot, I am not certain.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Would that have been the potential reaction of the\r\nPresident when first hit, as shown in 385?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. It could very easily be one of some type of an\r\ninjury--I mean the awareness that he had been struck by a missile, I\r\ndon't know, but people have been drilled through with a missile and\r\ndidn't know it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Humes, under your opinion which you have just given\r\nus, what effect, if any, would that have on whether this bullet, 399,\r\ncould have been the one to lodge in Governor Connally's thigh?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. I think that extremely unlikely. The reports, again\r\nExhibit 392 from Parkland, tell of an entrance wound on the lower\r\nmidthigh of the Governor, and X-rays taken there are described as\r\nshowing metallic fragments in the bone, which apparently by this report\r\nwere not removed and are still present in Governor Connally's thigh. I\r\ncan't conceive of where they came from this missile.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The missile identified as Exhibit 399.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. 399, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Doctor Humes, would you have an opinion as to whether the\r\nwounds on Governor Connally's wrist and thigh were caused by the same\r\nbullet?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. In reading the description of the fragmentation that\r\nwas found, fragments were found in the wrist, one fragment was found\r\nimbedded in his femur, I would feel it was definitely within the realm\r\nof possibility that the same missile could have produced both of those\r\ninjuries.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Those are all my questions, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Are there any other questions? If not, thank you very\r\nmuch, Commander. You have been very helpful to us, indeed.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Thank you very much, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Commander Boswell.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. May I ask one more question?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Of course you may.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Earlier in the afternoon we had taken out of cellophane\r\nbags here the clothing of the President.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. And amongst them was the shirt.\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. From your examination of the wounds, of the defects, I\r\nguess you would call it in the shirt----\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Would you from examining the tissues of that shirt have any\r\nconclusions as to how that wound, how that missile passed through the\r\nshirt? Was it from the rear to the front, or from the front to the rear?\r\n\r\nCommander HUMES. As I examined that exhibit today, sir, the threads are\r\nfragmented and distorted in such a fashion which would indicate to me\r\nthat the missile passed through the shirt from the rear to the front.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF COMDR. J. THORNTON BOSWELL, MEDICAL CORPS, U.S. NAVY\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Commander Boswell, will you raise your right hand and be\r\nsworn, please?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you give before this Commission\r\nwill be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help\r\nyou God?\r\n\r\nCommander BOSWELL. I do, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Be seated, please.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nCommander BOSWELL. J. Thornton Boswell, Commander, Medical Corps, U.S.\r\nNavy.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your profession?\r\n\r\nCommander BOSWELL. Physician.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where did you obtain your medical degree, please?\r\n\r\nCommander BOSWELL. At the College of Medicine, Ohio State University.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what experience have you had in your professional line\r\nsubsequent to obtaining that degree?\r\n\r\nCommander BOSWELL. I interned in the Navy and took my pathology\r\ntraining at St. Albans Naval Hospital in New York. I was certified\r\nby the American Board of Pathology in both clinical and pathological\r\nanatomy in 1957 and 1958.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your duty assignment at the present time?\r\n\r\nCommander BOSWELL. I am the Chief of Pathology at the National Naval\r\nMedical School.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to participate in the autopsy of the\r\nlate President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nCommander BOSWELL. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you assist Doctor Humes at that time?\r\n\r\nCommander BOSWELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you been present here today during the entire course\r\nof Doctor Humes' testimony?\r\n\r\nCommander BOSWELL. I have, sir; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything that you would like to add by way of\r\nelaboration or modification to that which Doctor Humes has testified?\r\n\r\nCommander BOSWELL. None, I believe. Doctor Humes has stated essentially\r\nwhat is the culmination of our examination and our subsequent\r\nconference, and everything is exactly as we had determined our\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are you one of the three coauthors of the autopsy\r\nreport which has been previously identified as a Commission Exhibit?\r\n\r\nCommander BOSWELL. Yes; I am.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All the facts set forth therein are correct in accordance\r\nwith your analysis and evaluation of the situation?\r\n\r\nCommander BOSWELL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And specifically, as to the points of entry and points of\r\nexit which have been testified to by Doctor Humes, do his views express\r\nyours as well?\r\n\r\nCommander BOSWELL. They do, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Doctor Boswell, would you state for the record what your\r\nconclusion was as to the cause of death of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nCommander BOSWELL. The brain injury was the cause of death.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And in the absence of brain injury, what, in your view,\r\nwould have been the future status of President Kennedy's mortality, if\r\nhe had only sustained the wound inflicted in 385?\r\n\r\nCommander BOSWELL. I believe it would have been essentially an\r\nuneventful recovery. It could have been easily repaired, and I think it\r\nwould have been of little consequence.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Those are my only questions, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Does anyone have any questions of the Commander? If not,\r\nCommander, thank you very much, indeed. You have been very helpful to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Colonel Finck.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF LT. COL. PIERRE A. FINCK, PHYSICIAN, U. S. ARMY\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Colonel Finck.\r\n\r\nColonel, will you raise your right hand and be sworn? Do you solemnly\r\nswear that the testimony you give before this Commission will be the\r\ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Will you be seated, please, Colonel?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. My first name is Pierre. My middle initial is \"A\". My\r\nlast name is Finck.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your profession, sir?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. I am a physician.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And by whom are you employed?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. By the United States Army.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your rank?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. I am a lieutenant colonel in the Medical Corps.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where did you obtain your medical degree?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. At the University of Geneva Medical School in\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And in what year did you obtain that degree?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. In 1948.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What has your experience been in the medical profession\r\nsubsequent to obtaining that degree?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. I had 4 years of training in pathology after my\r\ninternship, 2 years, including 2 years of pathology at the University\r\nInstitute of Pathology in Geneva, Switzerland, and 2 years at the\r\nUniversity of Tennessee Institute of Pathology in Memphis, Tenn.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how long have you been in the United States Army?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Since 1955.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what have your duties consisted of in the Army?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. From 1955 to 1958 I performed approximately 200\r\nautopsies, many of them pertaining to trauma including missile wounds,\r\nstationed at Frankfurt, Germany as pathologist of the United States\r\nArmy Hospital in Frankfurt, Germany.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you had any additional, special training or\r\nexperience in missile wounds?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. For the past 3 years I was Chief of the Wound Ballistics\r\nPathology Branch of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and in that\r\ncapacity I reviewed personally all the cases forwarded to us by the\r\nArmed Forces, and some civilian cases from the United States and our\r\nforces overseas. The number of these cases amounts to approximately 400\r\ncases. I was called as a consultant in the field of missile wounds for\r\nthis particular case, and also last year in February 1963, the Surgeon\r\nGeneral of the Army sent me to Vietnam for a wound ballistics mission.\r\nI had to testify in a murder trial involving a 30/30 rifle in the first\r\nweek of March this year, and I came back yesterday after one week in\r\nPanama where I had to testify. I was sent to Panama by the Secretary of\r\nthe Army regarding the fatalities of the events of 9-10 in January of\r\n1964.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you been certified by the American Board of\r\nPathology, Doctor Finck?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. I was certified in pathology anatomy by the American\r\nBoard of Pathology in 1956, and by the same American Board of Pathology\r\nin the field of forensic pathology in 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe briefly for the Commission what\r\nforensic pathology involves?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Forensic pathology is the study with the naked eye and\r\nwith the microscope of injuries, including missile wounds, trauma\r\nin general. In summary, it is the part of pathology in relation to\r\nthe law, violent death being homicide, be it suicide, accidental or\r\nundetermined. It also includes unexplained deaths, sudden deaths, and\r\npoisoning.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to participate in the autopsy of the\r\nlate President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are you one of the three coauthors of the autopsy\r\nreport which has been previously marked and introduced into evidence\r\nhere?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Yes, I am.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you had occasion to conduct any experiments on the\r\neffect of missile penetration of the brain reflected in the chart which\r\nyou have brought with you here today?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Of the skull--let me phrase the question this way: What\r\ndoes the test which is depicted on the document before you relate to?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. It is based on my observations, not on experiments.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you pass that to me, sir, so that I may mark that as\r\na Commission Exhibit, and then I will ask you to identify it, please?\r\n\r\nMr. Chief Justice, may I mark as Commission Exhibit No. 400 a document?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be marked.\r\n\r\n(The document was marked Commission Exhibit No. 400 for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I will ask Doctor Finck to describe it for us, please.\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. This is a scheme which I prepared before the 22d of\r\nNovember. It is a teaching scheme, but it applies to the case in\r\ndiscussion. It will be of help in understanding how I could identify\r\nthe entrance and the exit by examination of bone. \"A\" represents the\r\nbony portion of the skull. \"B\" represents the cavity of the head, the\r\ncranial cavity. \"C\" represents the entrance and \"D\" represents the\r\nexit. The arrows indicate the missile path.\r\n\r\nThis scheme is based upon observation of through and through wounds of\r\nbone, and the same differences apply to a pane of glass. The surface\r\nstruck first by the missile in relation to the surface struck next\r\nby the missile, this one, shows a smaller diameter, which means that\r\nif you look at the route of entrance in this case here, C, from the\r\noutside you will not see a crater. If you examine it from the inside,\r\nyou will see a crater corresponding to the bevelling, coning, shelving,\r\npreviously described by Commander Humes.\r\n\r\nIn the case we are discussing today, it was possible to have enough\r\ncurvature and enough portion of the crater to identify positively the\r\nwound of entrance at the site of the bone.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Relating then your evaluation of the situation with\r\nrespect to President Kennedy, and turning to Commission Exhibit No.\r\n388, what is your opinion as to whether point A is a wound of entrance\r\nor exit?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. My opinion as regards Exhibit 388, letter A, is that\r\nthis wound is the wound of entrance.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what are the characteristics of that wound which lead\r\nyou to that conclusion?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. The characteristics were that seen from the inside of\r\nthe skull, I could see a beveling in the bone, a beveling that could\r\nnot be seen when the wound was seen from outside the skull.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there any other individual characteristics that led\r\nyou to conclude A was the wound of entrance?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you present when the three pieces of scalp were\r\nreconstructed to form the major portion of the absent part of President\r\nKennedy's skull which Doctor Humes described?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. I was present when several portions of bone were brought.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you observe, if anything, as to a\r\nreconstructed hole from those three portions of skull?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. May I refer to my scheme?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Please do.\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. For the sake of demonstration.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Fine.\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. At the level of the wound of exit, E, in my scheme,\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 400, when viewed from the inside of the skull,\r\nthere was no crater, whereas when the wound is seen from the outside of\r\nthe skull, there was beveling, cratering, or coning--this is possible\r\nto determine an exit even if only a portion of the bone is submitted,\r\nfor the reason that if there was enough bone submitted, there is enough\r\ncurvature to identify the inside and outside of the skull. Therefore\r\nthe fragment, to give you an example, this portion at the level of the\r\nwound of exit can be oriented, and the outer surface of the skull and\r\nthe inner surface of the skull may be identified due to the curvature.\r\n\r\nAnd then you look at the direction of the beveling and you do see the\r\nbeveling when looking from the outside and you can identify an exit\r\nwound. And that is what I did, and now I am referring to the actual\r\ncase in discussion, Commission Exhibit 388.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That is B?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Letter B. We will see portions of bone in this general\r\narea, the large wound in the bone on the right side of the skull of\r\nPresident Kennedy. I had enough curvature to identify outside of\r\nthe skull, and inside of the skull, as the first step to orient the\r\nspecimen, and then I could determine the location of the beveling, and\r\nI could therefore say that B, Commission Exhibit 388, is a wound of\r\nexit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Based on your observations and conclusions, was President\r\nKennedy shot from the front, rear, side or what?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. President Kennedy was, in my opinion, shot from the\r\nrear. The bullet entered in the back of the head and went out on\r\nthe right side of his skull, producing a large wound, the greatest\r\ndimension of which was approximately 13 centimeters.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And as to angle, was he shot from below, from level, from\r\nabove, or what, in your opinion?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. In my opinion, the angle can be determined only\r\napproximately due to the fact that the wound of entrance is fairly\r\nsmall and could give enough precision in the determination of the path,\r\nbut the dimension of the wound of exit, letter B of Exhibit 388, is so\r\nlarge that we can only give an approximate angle. In my opinion, the\r\nangle was within 45 degrees from the horizontal plane.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that to say that there was a 45-degree angle of\r\ndeclination from the point of origin to the point of impact, from the\r\npoint of origin of the bullet where the bullet came from a gun until\r\nthe point where it struck President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. In other words, you mean was he shot from above or below.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. I think I can only state, sir, that he was shot from\r\nabove and behind.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At this time I move for admission into evidence Exhibit\r\n400, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document was marked Commission Exhibit No. 400 for identification,\r\nand was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As to Exhibit 385, Dr. Finck, was point C a point of entry\r\nor a point of exit, in your opinion?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. In my opinion point C of Commission's Exhibit 385 is a\r\nwound of entrance.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is the basis for that conclusion?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. The basis for that conclusion is that this wound was\r\nrelatively small with clean edges. It was not a jagged wound, and that\r\nis what we see in wound of entrance at a long range.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you present here today and did you hear the entire\r\ntestimony of Doctor Humes?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do you concur in Dr. Humes' statements and opinions\r\nregarding the point of entry C, point of exit D, and general angle on\r\nthe flight of the missile?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. I certainly do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then from what direction was President Kennedy shot on\r\nentry point C?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. From behind and above.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were the bullets used dumdum bullets, in your opinion, Dr.\r\nFinck?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. In what wound, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, start with the head wound, or the back wound, either\r\none.\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. In all the wounds considered, on the basis of the aspect\r\nof the wound of entrance, dumdum bullets were not used.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what characteristics of dumdum bullets were absent, in\r\nyour opinion--in your evaluation of these wounds?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. I would expect more jagged, more irregular and larger\r\nwounds of entrance than described in this case.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. With a dumdum bullet?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. With a dumdum bullet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. With respect to the question of likelihood of Governor\r\nConnally having been wounded in the back and chest with the same bullet\r\nwhich passed through President Kennedy in 385, what reduction would\r\nthere be, if any, in the velocity, considering the relative positions\r\nof the two men in the automobile as reflected in photograph, Exhibit\r\n398?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Of course, to reach precise figures we would need\r\nexperiments and similar circumstances with the same type ammunition at\r\nthe same distance through two human cadavers, which I did not do.\r\n\r\nOn the basis that if we assume that this is one bullet going through\r\nPresident Kennedy's body and also through Governor Connally's body, the\r\nreduction of velocity would be of some extent after passing through\r\nPresident Kennedy's body, but not having hit bones, the reduction\r\nin velocity, after going through President Kennedy's body, would be\r\nminimal.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would there be sufficient force then to inflict the wound\r\nwhich Dr. Humes described from the Parkland Hospital records as having\r\nbeen inflicted on Governor Connally's back and chest?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. There would be enough energy to go through the body of\r\nthe Governor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In expressing your opinion on that subject, Doctor\r\nFinck, have you taken into account the assumptions on distance, that\r\nwe are dealing here with a weapon that has a muzzle velocity in the\r\nneighborhood of slightly in excess of 2,000, and that the vehicle\r\ncarrying these two individuals was approximately 150, about 150 feet\r\naway from the site of origin of the missile?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. At this range, a bullet of this velocity loses very\r\nlittle velocity, and keeps upon impact a large amount of kinetic energy.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You heard the whole of Doctor Humes' testimony, did you\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything that you would like to add to what he\r\nsaid?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Or would you like to modify his testimony in any way?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you subscribe to the observations and procedures which\r\nhe outlined during the course of his testimony?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As having been conducted on President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do you share the opinions which he expressed in their\r\nentirety in the course of his testimony here today?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You might be seated, Colonel.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Just as truthful seated as standing.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How many cases did you investigate to develop this\r\ntheory shown by Commission Exhibit 400?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Among the more than 400 cases I have reviewed, several\r\nof them--I cannot give you an exact figure, I do not tabulate them, but\r\nmany of them had through and through wounds of the skull as well as of\r\nflat bones, as, for instance, the sternum, the bone we have in front of\r\nour chest, and this would apply also to a through and through wound of\r\nthe sternum. I have cases like that.\r\n\r\nThere was a specific case in which I was able to identify the entrance\r\nat the level of the sternum on the same basis as the criteria I have\r\ngiven for the skull. Whenever a bullet goes through a flat bone, it\r\nwill produce that beveling, that cratering, shelving, and that I have\r\nseen in numerous cases.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is this a generally accepted theory in the medical\r\nprofession?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Yes, sir; it is. Am I allowed to quote a standard\r\ntextbook?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You may; yes sir.\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. The textbook of legal medicine, pathology and toxicology\r\nby Gonzalez, Vance, Halpern and Umberger does not give a scheme like I\r\nhave shown to you today, but describes similar criteria.\r\n\r\nAs you know, one of the authors of the book I mentioned is still chief\r\nmedical examiner of New York City, with 20,000 medical-examiner cases a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Doctor Finck, after the path C-D described in No. 385,\r\nwould that be a straight line starting with the weapon itself, or was\r\nthat line deviated in any way or altered when it passed through the\r\nbody of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. For practical purposes line C-D is a straight line with\r\nlittle or no deviation, the bullet not having hit bony structures.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Finck, have you had an opportunity to examine\r\nCommission's Exhibit 399?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. For the first time this afternoon, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And based upon your examination of that bullet, do you\r\nhave an opinion as to whether in its current condition it could have\r\npassed through President Kennedy at point C-D in 385 and then inflicted\r\nthe wound in the back and chest of Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Yes; I do. This is a bullet showing marks indicating the\r\nbullet was fired. The second point is that there was practically no\r\nloss of this bullet. It kept its original caliber and dimensions. There\r\nwas no evidence that any major portion of the jacket was lost, and I\r\nconsider this as one bullet which possibly could have gone through the\r\nwounds you described.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And could that bullet possibly have gone through President\r\nKennedy in 388?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Through President Kennedy's head? 388?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And remained intact in the way you see it now?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Definitely not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And could it have been the bullet which inflicted the\r\nwound on Governor Connally's right wrist?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. No; for the reason that there are too many fragments\r\ndescribed in that wrist.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is the condition of Exhibit 399 consistent with the\r\ntype of a wound which Doctor Humes described on Governor Connally's rib?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I have a question.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Go right ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. From your examination of Exhibit 399, can you identify the\r\ncaliber of that bullet?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. The caliber of this bullet, if I could measure it, but I\r\ncannot touch it.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. We can.\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. I would say it is consistent with a 6.5 mm.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Are you familiar with the Mannlicher 6.5 rifle?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. I am familiar with the caliber 6.5. I can draw the\r\ncalibers for you on the blackboard.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. What is the initial velocity of a 6.5 mm. bullet of that\r\ncharacter?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Of the order of 2,000 feet per second.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. And you say there would not be a substantial diminution of\r\nthat velocity either at the point of impact or at the point of exit?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. One more question, Mr. Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nOn 388, point A to B, what is your view, Dr. Finck, as to whether or\r\nnot that is represented by a straight line going back to the point of\r\norigin of the weapon?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. The difficulty in interpreting the path in line A-B of\r\nCommission's Exhibit 388 is that, one, there is, as stated before, a\r\nlarge wound of exit, and, two, there is a secondary path as indicated\r\nby the fragments recovered. So we can have an assumption and state\r\nthat the general direction, the general path, the general angle of\r\nthis missile was from behind and above, and that the bullet, markedly\r\nfragmented, went out of the President's head on the right side, but\r\nthat a portion of this bullet which badly fragmented was recovered\r\nwithin the skull.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In view of the impact on the skull at point A, it is\r\nunlikely to be a straight line to B all the way back to the muzzle of\r\nthe weapon as it is, say, in 385 C-D, all the way back to the muzzle of\r\nthe gun.\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. In C-D, Commission's Exhibit 385, due to the fact that\r\nthere was no fragmentation, I can say that it is a straight line from\r\nbehind and above, whereas here, due to the fragmentation and to the\r\ndual path, I can't give a precise angle, but I can say that the injury\r\nis consistent with a wound produced by one bullet producing many\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Senator, have you any questions you want to ask?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. May I ask one?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; go right ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Did you examine any of the fragments which were removed\r\nfrom the President's skull?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. I only saw one fragment shown to me when I arrived at\r\nBethesda, and it was an elongated black metallic fragment, and that\r\nis the only one I saw to my recollection. I was told that it had been\r\nremoved from the brain of President Kennedy in the anterior portion of\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. From that bullet, that fragment, could you determine, was\r\nit sufficiently large to determine from the ballistic evidence the\r\ncaliber of the bullet?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. No, sir; for the reason that to determine the caliber\r\nyou need the entire bullet, or at least an entire portion. You need a\r\nportion of the bullet showing the entire diameter, and I was not shown\r\nthat. I was shown a fragment which represented a very small portion of\r\nthe original bullet. Therefore, at that time I could not say anything\r\non the possible original caliber.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. You examined no fragment which did contain those\r\ncharacteristics?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. No, sir; I did not see any entire bullet or bullet\r\nshowing the entire diameter.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Congressman Ford?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I believe you testified, Colonel, that you\r\nconcurred in the previous testimony by Commander Humes and Commander\r\nBoswell, and that you were one of the co-authors of the autopsy. At any\r\ntime during this process where you were conducting the autopsy, was\r\nthere any disagreement between any one of you three, any difference of\r\nopinion as to anything involved in the autopsy?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. No, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. There has been complete unanimity on what you saw,\r\nwhat you did, and what you have reported?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Senator Cooper?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Colonel, I would like for you to look at Exhibit 388\r\nand at the possible trajectory of the bullet which entered President\r\nKennedy's head at A and then mark it as a possible point of exit by\r\n\"out\". You remember there was testimony about a portion of the bullet\r\nfrom point A to the place on the diagram marked \"fragment\" where a\r\nfragment was found. I would like to ask if it is possible that the\r\ntrajectory of the bullet, from the point of origin, could have been A\r\nto this point marked \"fragment\" as well as from A to the place marked\r\n\"out\"?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. I don't think so, sir.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Why? Would you explain that answer?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. I would think that I would consider the midportion of\r\nthis exit would labeled B, Exhibit 388, as the wound produced by most\r\nof the fragments and the major portions of the fragmenting bullet.\r\nThis is only a small portion of it which makes me say that this is a\r\nsecondary path.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What was the size of the fragment relative to the size\r\nof the missile of the 6.5 Mannlicher, fired from the 6.5 Mannlicher\r\nrifle?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Approximately one-tenth, or even less.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. From your numerous case studies, is it typical\r\nfor a bullet, for a missile in this circumstance as shown in 388, to\r\nfragment to the degree that this one apparently did?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Yes, it is quite common to find a wound of exit much\r\nlarger than the wound of entrance for weapons commonly used.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But is it typical for the missile to fragment to\r\nthe degree that this one did as shown in Exhibit 388?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Is it typical to find only a limited number of\r\nfragments as you apparently did in this case?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. This depends to a great extent on the type of ammunition\r\nused. There are many types of bullets, jacketed, not-jacketed, pointed,\r\nhollow-nosed, hollow-points, flat-nose, round-nose, all these different\r\nshapes will have a different influence on the pattern of the wound and\r\nthe degree of fragmentation.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That is all.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Colonel, very much for your help.\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. You are welcome, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. May I ask just one question?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes; Colonel, we would like to ask just one more question.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Do these two wounds represent the same or a\r\ndifferent kind of bullet?\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. You are referring to one wound and this other wound here?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I am referring to the wound shown in Exhibit 388\r\nidentified as point of entry A, and wound in Exhibit 385 identified as\r\nC.\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Due to the difference in the nature of the tissue,\r\ndifference in the nature of the target, it is perfectly possible that\r\nthese two wounds came from the same type of bullet, that one hit bony\r\nstructures and the other one did not, and that explains the differences\r\nbetween the patterns of these two wounds.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Why one fragmented and one did not.\r\n\r\nColonel FINCK. Yes.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Gentlemen, again thank you very much.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 3:45 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, March 18, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MICHAEL R. PAINE AND RUTH HYDE PAINE\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 9 a.m. on March 18, 1964, at 200\r\nMaryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Sherman\r\nCooper, Representative Gerald R. Ford, John J. McCloy, and Allen W.\r\nDulles, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; Wesley J. Liebeler,\r\nassistant counsel, Albert E. Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel; Dr. Alfred\r\nGoldberg, historian; and Charles Murray, observer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MICHAEL R. PAINE\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. The Commission will be in order.\r\n\r\nMr. Paine, I will just read a brief statement concerning the purpose of\r\nthe meeting today which is our practice.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this hearing is to take the testimony of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nMichael R. Paine. The Commission has been advised that Mr. and Mrs.\r\nPaine made the acquaintance of the Oswalds during 1963, and that Mrs.\r\nMarina Oswald lived in the Paine home from late September 1963 up to\r\nthe time of the assassination.\r\n\r\nSince the Commission is inquiring fully into the background and\r\npossible motive of Lee Harvey Oswald, the alleged assassin, it intends\r\nto ask the above witnesses questions concerning Mr. Oswald, his\r\nassociations and relations with others, as well as questions concerning\r\nany and all matters relating to the assassination.\r\n\r\nYou have been furnished a copy of this, have you not?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I have seen something to that effect.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You have seen it.\r\n\r\nVery well, will you rise and raise your right hand, please. Do you\r\nsolemnly swear the testimony you give before this Commission will be\r\nthe truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I do.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You may be seated; Mr. Liebeler will propound the\r\nquestions to you.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you state your name, please?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Michael R. Paine.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And your address?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. 2515 West Fifth Street, Irving, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When were you born, Mr. Paine?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. June 25, 1928.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Where?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. New York City.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you tell us briefly your educational background,\r\nwhere you attended schools?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I went to school, high school in New York, went to 2 years\r\nof Harvard and a year of Swarthmore, I have not finished college.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What class would you have been in Swarthmore?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. 1953.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You would have been 1953 if you finished or did you finish?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Excuse me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You are presently married, are you not?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Your wife's name is?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Ruth Hyde Paine.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You have two children?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Tell us who your parents are.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Lyman Paine is my father and Ruth Forbes Paine Young, or\r\nYoung is her present name. Mrs. Arthur Young now. She is my mother.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Where is your father living at the present time?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He is in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Your mother?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you have any brothers and sisters?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I have a brother in Baltimore.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What is his name?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Cameron Paine.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. By whom are you presently employed?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Bell Helicopter, Fort Worth.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you have a security clearance in connection with your\r\nwork at Bell Helicopter?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I suppose it is. I don't happen to know what the\r\nclassification is.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Where did you work prior to working for Bell Helicopter?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I worked in Pennsylvania for Arthur Young.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What was the nature of your employment with Mr. Young?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I had set up a shop in his barn and started work for myself\r\nand then he employed me making models, helicopter models for himself.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Approximately at what time, what period of time did you\r\nwork for Mr. Young?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is very difficult to say. I began more or less\r\ngradually first. I was doing other things. I am very vague about the\r\ndates.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know the year approximately?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I suppose I went to work at Bell in 1958. I have been there\r\n4-1/2 years.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is this Mr. Young your stepfather?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is right\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you worked for him immediately prior to your going to\r\nBell Helicopter?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Prior to working for Mr. Young, did you have any other\r\nemployment?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think I came from the Army. Before that I worked at Bartol\r\nResearch Foundation in Swarthmore.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You were going to tell us what that was.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That was mostly a job of setting up a laboratory to--was\r\nnuclear research laboratory, Van Der Graaf generators it had there.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What was the nature of your work with Bartol?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Mostly all the work in making those machines, setting those\r\nmachines so they would run; making counters, coincidence counters,\r\ninstrumentation to operate the machine.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. How long did you work for Bartol?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That was just about a year, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Prior to that did you have any other employment?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No, that was Swarthmore.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever work for the Griswold Manufacturing Co.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Oh, I did; yes. That was after--well, after the Army. I\r\nthink it was only a few months, I don't remember when it fitted in.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What was the nature of your work with that company?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That was very boring. It was engraving precision scales.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You worked in the actual engraving of the scales?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What is the nature of your work with Bell Helicopter at\r\nthe present time?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I am called a research engineer. I work in a lab and design\r\nand build and test models of new concepts of helicopter configurations.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Have you been engaged in that type of work for Bell\r\nthroughout the entire time you have been employed by them?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I have been in the research laboratory research group that\r\nlong. It has all been problems----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Are you a helicopter pilot by any chance yourself?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I am an airplane pilot.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. But your work basically for Bell has been in the research\r\nof design and operation of helicopters?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you tell us the circumstances under which you met\r\nyour wife and subsequently married her?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I met her at a folk dance party, folk dance meeting, and I\r\nhad known her for about 2 years before we married.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When did you meet her approximately?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. We were married, I think, in 1958, it was the end of the\r\nyear so maybe it was 1957. What was the question again?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Approximately when you met her.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Two years before that would be, 1957.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. 1956 or 1957.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. We understand that you are a Quaker, Mr. Paine, is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is not quite correct.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Philadelphia, I sang in various churches, and Ruth being\r\na Quaker, started going to Quaker meetings. Had I remained there I\r\nwould have become a Quaker. Moving to Texas there was a very small\r\nQuaker community, and I joined the Unitarian Church after a while.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When did you first become interested in the Quaker\r\nreligion; was it about the time you met your wife or was it before that.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I think she was instrumental in bringing me into that\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Give us a brief description of the outside interests that\r\nyou and your wife and that your wife had during the time subsequent to\r\nyour meeting and until the time you left Philadelphia. Was she active\r\nin church activities?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I wouldn't say so. She was active in the Young Friends\r\nCommittee of North America which was making an effort to bring a group\r\nof Russians on tour of this country. It was in the first flush or\r\nenthusiasm of East-West contacts, and after a couple of years they did\r\nsucceed in bringing those Russians on tour. That was the beginning of\r\nher interest in Russian, learning the Russian language. I think that\r\nwas her only activity that I am aware of or remember right now.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know whether your wife engaged in a writing\r\ncampaign or a pen pal campaign between people in the United States and\r\npeople in the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That was another part of this East-West contacts committee's\r\nduties or tasks they took upon themselves and I think she was chairman,\r\naccepted the chairmanship of that committee.\r\n\r\nFor a while, it was almost moribund, very inactive.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Which committee was that, the committee to stimulate\r\nletters between Russia and the United States?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; to find names and addresses on each side to connect\r\npeople together.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you yourself ever take part in any activity of that\r\ngroup?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You spoke of the East-West contacts committee as being\r\nactive in trying to bring a group of Russians to the United States. Did\r\nthey engage in any activities other than this attempt to bring Russians\r\nto the United States that you know of?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is the only one I know of, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did they succeed in bringing some Russians to the United\r\nStates?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; they did. They brought three Russians, and then the\r\nRussians reciprocated by taking a group of Quakers who knew Russian on\r\na tour of Russia.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Were you married to Ruth Hyde Paine at the time these\r\nRussian people came to the United States under the auspices of the\r\nEast-West contacts committee?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I might have been; I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know whether she actively participated in the\r\nprogram to bring the Russians to the United States?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Well, she participated insofar as going to the meetings. I\r\ndon't believe she did most of the writing to the State Department and\r\nwhat-not to try to arrange clearances and itineraries and things like\r\nthat, but she was at the meetings at which those things were discussed.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she ever discuss them with you in any detail?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. We, I would often--I went to several of those meetings\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know the names of any of the Russians who came to\r\nthe United States in connection with this program?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I might recognize them if I saw them again, but right now\r\nthe names have escaped me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You say there were just three of them?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think there were three; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Are you a member of the American Civil Liberties Union?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When did you become a member of that organization?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I suppose you become a member as soon as you contribute\r\nmoney, and I may have contributed money a good many years back. I\r\ndidn't start going to a meeting of the organization until I was--I have\r\nonly been to about four perhaps, in Dallas, four meetings.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Is Dallas the only place you have attended meetings of\r\nthe ACLU?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. To my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Are you acquainted with an organization known as the\r\nFriends Peace Committee?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. It is a familiar name. I guess not, though. I don't think I\r\nhave been to a meeting of theirs.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know if it is connected in any way with the Young\r\nFriends Committee of North America.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I take it to be a Friend, you know, a Quaker committee but I\r\nbelieve it is connected.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know a gentleman by the name of Dennis Jamison,\r\nwho I believe is active in the Friends Peace Committee?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Or George Lakey?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. For practical purposes; no. The names seem a little familiar\r\nbut I can't place them.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you have any recollection of the connection in which\r\nit is familiar to you?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Are you familiar with the Committee for Non-Violent\r\nAction?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Many of these things sound familiar. I don't--I really am\r\nsaying no.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Are you a member or have you ever attended any meetings\r\nof the John Birch Society?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I am not a member. I have been to one or, I guess chiefly\r\none meeting of theirs.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Where was that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That was in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That was the night Stevenson spoke in Dallas.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. When?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. The night Stevenson spoke in Dallas, U.N. Day.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was that 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you tell us the circumstances of your attendance at\r\nthat meeting and what happened?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I had been seeking to go to a Birch meeting for some time,\r\nand then I was invited on this night so I went. It was an introductory\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. On the 9th of November?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. It was November something, I don't know what, a Wednesday or\r\nThursday night.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. For the record I think the record should indicate that\r\nMr. Stevenson was in Dallas on or about October 24, 1963. Who invited\r\nyou to this meeting?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I had tried once before to go to a meeting which didn't\r\noccur. There happens to be a member of our choir, a paid soloist who is\r\na John Birch advocate so I have been applying--so I have been telling\r\nher, that I wanted to go. I suppose, I don't remember for certain but I\r\nsuppose she was the one who told me where and when.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did this meeting have anything to do with the activity\r\nthat occurred at Mr. Stevenson's meeting in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No. You see they were taking place at the same time. It was\r\nrather sparsely attended, most of them were down spitting on Stevenson.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. The Birch meeting which you were down to was sparsely\r\nattended?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was this an evening meeting or afternoon?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. This is evening.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Evening.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask, did you go out of curiosity rather than sympathy\r\nor rather how did you happen to go?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I am not in sympathy.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. So I gathered.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I have been to a number of rightist meetings and seminars in\r\nTexas. I was interested in seeing more communication between the right\r\nand the left; there isn't much liberal out there and so I wanted to be\r\nable to speak their language and know that their fears--and be familiar\r\nwith their feelings and attitudes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was there any discussion at this meeting as far as you\r\ncan recall of Mr. Stevenson's appearance in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I don't believe there was any.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was there any discussion of the policy of the Kennedy\r\nadministration?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. There was no discussion at that meeting. It was a 2- or\r\n3-hour lecture on a movie by Welch, and then a young man gave a few\r\nmore explanations about the organization. It was mostly an introductory\r\nmeeting. I think for newcomers.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Telling them about the John Birch Society itself?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Mr. Welch was not there, was he?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; he was not.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was this a movie in which he participated?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He was the speaker at a lectern in this movie.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you have any knowledge of the political attitudes or\r\nactivities of your father, George Lyman Paine?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I have very little specific knowledge of what he does.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you tell us what you do know about your father's\r\npolitical activities?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I have seen my father rather rarely. Since I have been in\r\nTexas, I have seen him more frequently. I think I have been out there\r\nthree times now in the last 5 years.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When you say out there--you mean Los Angeles?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; I have seen him twice. He was out to Texas. I have been\r\nto Los Angeles twice, and he came at least once to Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Please fix the time when you went to Los Angeles?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Last summer, 2 weeks in August or something. I was there for\r\n3 days, the first, the middle of August.\r\n\r\nI would guess it was about 2 years before that that I had been there.\r\nI could be off by a year both ways. I can't even remember whether he\r\ncame--I think he probably interspersed his visit between mine.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you recall that he visited Irving on two different\r\noccasions, once in Christmas, 1962?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. One was a Christmas party, that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And once in the summer of 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't remember '61. I do remember pictures now, we have\r\npictures showing us outside so that was balmy weather.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. So that in the period that you have been living in Texas\r\nyou have gone to Los Angeles on two different occasions and visited\r\nyour father there and he has been in Irving on two different occasions,\r\nis that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That seems, I think, to be right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you go on and tell us what you know about your\r\nfather's political activities?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nWell, we would have to go back to a little to when I lived in New York\r\nas a school student in school, grammar school and high school. There I\r\nwould see him very infrequently considering our close proximity and the\r\nfact that I found him stimulating and I liked him.\r\n\r\nHe took me to a few, one or possibly two, Communist meetings at my\r\nconsiderable insistence. He didn't urge this upon me. I wanted to go,\r\nto get the feeling of the--I asked him what he did or something and I\r\nwanted to know all this, my mother said he was on the radical left.\r\n\r\nSo, I went to a few of those meetings, and didn't--was unfamiliar\r\nwith the issues and questions they were debating. I got the feeling,\r\nI came away with the impression, that these people, there were three\r\nCommunist groups apparently in New York at the time, and they were most\r\nup in arms with each other, or there----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Excuse me, how old were you at this time approximately?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. This was somewhere from eighth grade to high school.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What year about, what time span would that be?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Well 1947, I think I got out of high school, so it is 1943\r\nto 1947.\r\n\r\nThen I didn't--I got the flavor of those meetings. I found sort of an\r\nintense people, people of high intensity. I didn't feel very much at\r\nhome there, and I guess I didn't go to any more.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did they try to recruit you at all or to get you to be a\r\nmember or attend or join meetings?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; they were glad to meet Lyman's son. That is he would\r\nintroduce me to friends or people he knew there, and I liked--I had\r\nsome favorable attitudes to the zeal of the group or the zeal of the\r\nassembled people.\r\n\r\nThey were fully committed to what they believed in. I had my own dreams\r\nof how I would like to see society at the time and it wasn't along the\r\nsame line.\r\n\r\nSo, I felt happy to have them there and I would go my course and\r\njust--I didn't feel opposed to them; neither did I feel drawn to them,\r\nalthough I tried to read some of Das Kapital at that time and Communist\r\nmanifesto.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever join any of these organizations?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Well, I didn't know of any organization as such.\r\n\r\nI went to this meeting in downtown New York. I didn't know--so\r\ntherefore I knew three groups. Maybe it was the Socialist group and the\r\nStalinist group and I think the group that Lyman was in, I don't know,\r\nmaybe he was a Socialist.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Which was the second group, was it the Stalinist?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I mentioned the Stalinist, Dubinsky, David Dubinsky, was the\r\nonly name I remember aside from Stalin, was a name I remember there,\r\nand I can't now remember whose side who was on.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you have any clear recollection of what particular\r\ngroup your father was associated with?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I never had--never knew what the name of any group he\r\nmight be associated with.\r\n\r\nNow, I suppose it was Trotsky. Trotskyite was a different distinct\r\ngroup at that time. They probably wouldn't be mentioning their own\r\ngroup. They would be mentioning their opponent's group.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Subsequent to your attendance at the meetings of these\r\ngroups at the time you have spoken of did you ever attend any other\r\nmeetings of similar groups either in New York or any other place?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I can't remember anything of a similar nature.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you know of your father ever using any aliases?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You are not familiar with the name Thomas L. Brown or\r\nLyman Pierce?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When was the----\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I was aware that my father didn't talk readily about his\r\naffairs. When we met we would talk at great length and we always do\r\ntalk. There is an amazing similarity in our natures. I have almost\r\nthought there was one person trying to live in two bodies.\r\n\r\nBut we have always been completely absorbed in subjects that were\r\ncloser to my--without going into what he was doing day to day or what\r\nhe was--I was aware that I didn't know, and I didn't pry or probe as to\r\nwhat he might be doing there.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. So far as you know, however, he was actively\r\nparticipating in the meetings and activities of this group?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Am I correct in understanding that your father and mother\r\nwere divorced when you were about 4 years old?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You were at that time living in New York City?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Subsequently you and your mother.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. She got a divorce in Reno, Nev., she had a house in Virginia\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. In New York you were living with your father or mother?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. They lived together in New York. Then there was a year, a\r\npart of a year, we moved to Philadelphia. They may have separated and\r\nhe tried to come back or something like that, and then we went to Reno,\r\nNev.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. During the time you lived in Philadelphia, was your\r\nfather living with the family?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think he was there part time. I don't remember that for\r\nsure. We had two houses there. One I think I remember him slightly and\r\nthe other one I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Your father was not present during the time that you\r\nstayed in Nevada?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; he was not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You and your brother stayed in Nevada with your mother?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. And a housekeeper also.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. After you left Nevada where did you live?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. We went over to California. Santa Barbara.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Who lived there at that time with you?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. A friend of hers, Kathleen, now she was originally Kathleen\r\nSchroeder, a sister of my uncle, now Kathleen Forbes, and a distant\r\ncousin of my mother's, and I think my grandfather, grandparents, would\r\ncome out occasionally.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was your father present at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; he was not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. He wasn't there at any time during your stay in Santa\r\nBarbara?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't remember that. I am not certain of it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. How long did you live in Santa Barbara, Calif.?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Each year my grandfather paid our way back across the\r\ncountry to Naushon Island in Massachusetts. We lived there 3 years.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Where did you go after that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Cambridge, Mass.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. How long were you there?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. From the third to the sixth grade.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. With whom did you live?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. With my mother on Fairweather Street.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Is this of particular importance to the investigation, it\r\nis very lengthy, and I don't know particularly what it bears upon. If\r\nit is in relation with his father, let's get at that and get it over\r\nwith, but I don't see what this man's history from the time he was\r\nborn--I don't see how it bears on it. It just takes altogether too much\r\ntime for an extraneous purpose, it seems to me. Let's get on with the\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. It bears on the point only on what connection he has with\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Let me go to that. I have seen him on a few times, once a\r\nyear would be a frequent--we felt great affinity in our bent, not in\r\nthe actual application of the way we would like to do things but in a\r\nconcern for the value of people. I know very little about what he does,\r\nand he has not tried to proselytize me, and he has not volunteered\r\ninformation about what he did.\r\n\r\nI think a certain change has come over him since. For many years or\r\nyears in college or something I thought he was still interested in his\r\nrevolutionary groups and that was a pity because that wasn't going to\r\nhappen, and it was to be a dead end, a blind, he would come to the end\r\nof his life and his cause had fizzled out.\r\n\r\nWhen I went out to California more recently, the last time we were\r\ntalking about the civil rights movement and, shall we say, the\r\nrevolution occurring in this country spearheaded by the Negroes'\r\ndemand for dignity, that was a subject that completely absorbed the\r\nweekend and there were various Negroes who came around the country, who\r\nhappened to pass through at that time.\r\n\r\nYou probably might be interested in regard to Cuba. I was surprised\r\nsometime in the conversation someone there had spoken favorably of the\r\nrevolution in Cuba. This was a surprise to me, I didn't realize that\r\nthis was part of the--was the present thrill, shall we say. I don't\r\nknow whether that applied to Lyman also or whether--I think he went\r\nalong with that. We didn't get around to arguing on that point. I only\r\nmention that in passing. That was about the full extent of it.\r\n\r\nShe mentioned Cuba in this favorable way, and it was a subject I\r\ndidn't----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Who was this she?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. It was Grace somebody, I have forgotten.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. One of the people present in these conversations?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes. So that was my only knowledge that he was, or the\r\npeople around him were, interested in Cuba, and that is the only thing\r\nI can see has any bearing in your interest here.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. To what extent would you say that your father has\r\ninfluenced your own political views and attitudes?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I would have guessed it was almost negligible. I was aware\r\nthat sometime in the beginning of college or something I used the\r\nlanguage of the masses or I used jargon which I recognized, came to\r\nperceive was of quite leftist nature, and I think that at the time I\r\nused to get The Nation, that was in high school. I probably picked it\r\nup more from the magazines and things of that sort than from him.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever discuss your father with Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. On a phone call shortly after the assassination he called\r\nand thought it was outrageous to be pinning Lee Oswald who was a\r\nscapegoat, an ideal person to hang the blame on.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Your father called you?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; he called me, yes. He didn't suppose it was true, I\r\ntold him I thought it probably was true. And I told him to keep his\r\nshirt on.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember anything else about that conversation?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No. It was chiefly both he and Freddy, his wife, had to be\r\ncalmed down. They thought it was a steamrollered job of injustice or\r\nsomething. And I didn't think their admonitions were--I think not to\r\nsay anything, not to join the hubbub or jump on the things I said or I\r\ntook it to be things I said would be distorted and blown up and added\r\nto the hullabaloo to lynch Lee.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did they infer or imply that the allegations or\r\naccusations against Oswald bore the semblance of a lynching? And I use\r\nlynching in the broad sense.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. They did not use lynching at all. I added that. They thought\r\nhe was----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Being railroaded?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; he said that no one, no member of the Friends of Cuba\r\nwould want to assassinate the President. That was a crazy idea.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You said that was a crazy idea?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; he said that. Therefore, he concluded, and this was the\r\nsame, similar to my feeling, that I first didn't think Oswald had done\r\nit because I didn't see how it fitted in, how it helped his favorite\r\nideals.\r\n\r\nAnd Lyman then said the same thing. Therefore, including himself,\r\nLyman, that Lee couldn't have done it, and that this must be--Lee was\r\nthe ideal person to hang it on.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How soon was this phone call after the\r\nassassination?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think it was--he did not know, I think, that we had Marina\r\nstaying with us, but he was one of the first to connect, guess that it\r\nwas us. He called and asked us, \"Is this you?\"\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. \"Is this you?\" What? I don't quite understand the\r\ncontext here.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He heard it on the news and he heard Mrs. Paine, and Marina\r\nhad been staying with a Mrs. Paine and he called to ask, \"Are you the\r\nPaines?\"\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Had you discussed Lee Oswald with your father prior to\r\nthis time?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I don't think I mentioned him.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know whether your father knew Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I do not know. Or I gather since he had such a funny\r\nidea of him over the phone.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. To the best of your judgment the only way your father\r\nheard of Lee Oswald, connected Lee Oswald to you, was through a news\r\nbroadcast that he had heard connecting Oswald with somebody named Paine?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Or Marina had stayed with the Paines.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever discuss your father with Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And Oswald never asked you about your father in any way\r\nor did he indicate that he knew of your father?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; he did not. I think Ruth came closer to revealing that\r\nmy father had--you will have to ask her about that question. I did not\r\nmention my father to Lee.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When did you meet Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I met him sometime in the spring of 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. This is Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Yes; Lee Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. We were invited to a party, Ruth and I were invited to a\r\nparty, given by Everett Glover. I had a cold and wasn't able to go.\r\nRuth went at that time and subsequently went once or twice to see\r\nMarina. And she invited Marina and Lee to our house for dinner, and\r\nhere the date that comes to mind is April 10.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Where was Marina staying at this time?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Berry Street.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Berry Street in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Berry Street or would it be Neely Street?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Neely Street. So this was the first time I saw them. I had\r\nto go over, he didn't drive a car and I had to go over, and pick him\r\nup in my car and bring him back to the house. So I went over to Neely\r\nStreet and saw them. Marina took about half an hour to pack all the\r\nthings for Junie. Meanwhile I was talking to Lee at their house there.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you tell us about that conversation?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I asked him what he was doing, his job, and he showed me a\r\npicture on the wall, which was a piece of newspaper, I think--that is\r\nbeside the point. I asked him about Russia, what he liked about----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could we get that picture?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think it was beside the point. It was a piece of newspaper\r\nshowing a fashion ad, I think. I think his job was----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Nothing to do with politics at all, to do with his job. I\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I asked him what he thought. I wanted to know why he had\r\ngone to Russia and why he had then come back. He had told me he had\r\nbecome a Marxist in this country without ever having met a Communist,\r\nby reading books and then he got to Russia, and----\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he tell you why he went to Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He said he wanted to go to Russia. He had chosen to go to\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. He didn't elaborate on it?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I gathered he had had an interest in going to Russia\r\nfor a number of years prior to the time he got there and decided that\r\nthat was the paradise of the world and through fortunate relations\r\nbetween this country and Russia at the time, I would have to remember\r\nhistory to know whether that was a warm, a friendly time or not, but he\r\nindicated both his going and his coming were fortunate times in history\r\nor something that made it possible for him to do these.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Fortunate times?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Fortunate times, this was sort of an accident in history.\r\nThis is what I gathered from his conversation.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Fortunate that he could leave at the time and\r\nfortunate that he could come back.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Fortunate that he could be accepted to emigrate to Russia.\r\nHe told me that he had--so he went to Russia and he tried to surrender\r\nhis passport to the Russians but the State Department would not give\r\nit to him, or the consul in Moscow, which was--which proved to be\r\nfortunate because then a few years later when he wanted to return it\r\nwould not have been possible, except if they still had his passport. He\r\nhad not legally surrendered it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he indicate that was a fortunate circumstance?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think he smiled, he indicated to me he genuinely had\r\nwanted to become a Russian citizen and to surrender it. He wanted to\r\nrenounce his American citizenship. He tried to, and the Russians, he\r\ntold me, had accepted his bona fide intentions and tried to get the\r\npassport away from the Americans.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was the failure to get his passport a determining\r\nfactor in their not accepting his desires?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No. He told me that they did accept his desires despite his\r\ninability to get the passport and give it to them.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Despite his inability?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. \"They\" being the Russians?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; they being the Russians and they issued to him, he told\r\nme, the standard kind of temporary citizenship paper which is given to\r\nall emigres to Russia, and there are some----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was it citizenship paper he said or something else,\r\ncitizenship paper?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Now, I suppose there was a regular paper and everybody would\r\nknow of it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Domicile paper or something allowing domicile.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I had thought, my impression was, that it was kind of\r\nprobationary citizenship. It is a kind of paper issued for a year to\r\nsomebody who is seeking citizenship. That was my impression at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could it have been a probationary residence permit or\r\nsomething of that sort. He said citizenship, did he?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That was my impression. That it was the commencement of a\r\ncitizenship paper.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did he tell you about any difficulties he had in getting\r\npermission to stay on in Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Well, this was a question. I asked him how was it they so\r\nreadily accepted--you know other Americans have a hard time staying\r\nmore than 30 days there, \"How was it that you were so readily accepted\r\ninto the bosom of Soviet Society?\" And to that he answered, \"well, it\r\nwas just a fortunate mood between the countries or something to that\r\neffect,\" is something that I gathered.\r\n\r\nI didn't remember the history and I thought it would be--he smiled a\r\nlittle bit. I can't remember whether he smiled a little bit when I\r\nthen asked him how did he manage to get out, at one time, but at one\r\ntime I do remember he smiled as though there were a story there, and I\r\ndidn't--I supposed the story would be too intricate, not interesting\r\nenough to try to get him to relate it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You did not ask him to relate the story?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever learn the circumstances under which he left\r\nRussia, from him?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. As he told me at that same half hour before we came back to\r\nour house on Fifth Street,----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was this the first time you had seen him?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. All this happened in the first half hour.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The first time you had ever seen him?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. The first time I had seen him or at least that first night.\r\n\r\nHe told me he had decided, that he had wanted, to come back to this\r\ncountry and it was through the fortunate circumstance of the Embassy\r\nstill having his passport which was a legal loophole that made it\r\nlegally possible, and I asked him--at sometime I thought this was\r\nrather nice that the State Department, I think this was a little later\r\nin the same evening, the State Department had forewarned him, had\r\ngranted him money also, to come back.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he tell you that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He told me that and I was rather proud of the State\r\nDepartment for its generous behavior toward such a wayward citizen.\r\nHe actually had spoken--I had mentioned this because he had spoken\r\nabusively of the American Government.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. At this time, during the first meeting?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Not just the American Government--yes; at this same meeting.\r\nHe had spoken with abuse of, sort of resentment that they didn't let\r\nhim have his passport and I thought, well now, that was just kind of a\r\nnice trick, by having a consular official there that he knew, this man\r\nwanted to change his mind, this little legal dodge of not wanting to\r\ngive him his passport which I think is illegal if the man wants it, it\r\nwould be the thing to permit him to come back.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you point that out to Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What did he say?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't think he responded to it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. He talked about surrendering the passport rather than\r\nsurrendering citizenship, did he?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. The two were synonymous, I thought, that if you surrendered\r\nyour passport and with the intention of adopting another one that was\r\nrenouncing American citizenship.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Which he wanted, he told me he wanted to renounce his\r\nAmerican citizenship. He said that quite flatly.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember anything else about this conversation\r\nconcerning his trip back and his attitude toward the State Department\r\nand the United States that he discussed during this first meeting?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't believe so. I think I have got it a little confused\r\nwith Marguerite Oswald what she said at the assassination, at the time\r\nof the night of the 22d. She was resentful of the State Department,\r\nthinking it had been remiss in taking so long in getting him back. I\r\ndon't remember whether he had voiced the same--I am confused, I don't\r\nknow whether it was he or she who had voiced this resentment. I thought\r\nto the contrary it was very generous.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember whether or not Oswald himself voiced\r\nresentment against the Government of the United States in this\r\nconnection?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; I do remember that. That was the thing that prompted me\r\nto say that it was actually rather nice of them to have been illegal\r\njust for this----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I didn't catch the last. Nice of them to have been what?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I thought it probably was illegal of the embassy official\r\nnot to hand over his passport when he demanded it in order to surrender\r\nit to the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. But you don't remember Oswald responding to that when you\r\nmade that answer to him?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't remember his response.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. You also said you thought it was rather nice of the State\r\nDepartment to do that in order to make it possible for him to return if\r\nhe wanted to?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; I said both of these things. They had given him money.\r\nThey had held, a peccadillo to hold, the passport out of the knowledge\r\nthat he might, such people might, want to return, change their mind,\r\nand then to provide him money moreover to come back, this all seemed\r\nto me rather nice even though it had taken 2 more months than when he\r\noriginally wanted to come back.\r\n\r\nI had said, this in response to his, some kind of expression on his\r\npart of criticism of the State Department or the foreign embassy or\r\nwhatever it is.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember why he was critical? Was he critical\r\nbecause they had not given him his passport when he went to Russia\r\nor was he critical because in his opinion they had taken so long to\r\narrange his return?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think he was critical when he first mentioned it, he\r\nseemed to have the critical attitude--some of this critical attitude\r\nmay have been facial expressions or way of speaking, which was somewhat\r\ncommon with him. Therefore, I can't remember for sure whether it was in\r\nthe words or in his attitude. He was critical, though, certainly of\r\nthe first, of the State Department not relinquishing his passport.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was he critical at this latter time?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He was critical of that as he was relating to his desire\r\nto go to the Soviet Union. He was relating the story to me, and then\r\nhe had spoken of the State Department as though they were a bunch of\r\nbastards, wouldn't--or illegal or something. Anyway, he was unfavorable.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But did you indicate he was rather glad that they had later\r\ntaken this position so that he could get his passport back or did I\r\nmisunderstand you on that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Well, I pointed out to him that or said \"it was kind of\r\nfortunate that they had held your passport,\" and I think he nodded his\r\nassent to that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he tell you why he decided to return to the United\r\nStates from Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Most of this conversation, I think, was when we had first\r\nmet and I wasn't sure whether he was speaking derogatively of the\r\nSoviet Union in order to win my good graces or thinking he could win my\r\nfriendship that way.\r\n\r\nHowever, he spoke more with disfavor of the Soviet Union during this\r\nfirst meeting than was quite comprehensible to someone who had gone\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What did he say?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. But chiefly what he said was that he didn't have choice of\r\nwhere he could live, you were assigned, he spoke with a certain amount\r\nof derision, scorn of the fact that you were assigned jobs, and he\r\nthought the food was boring, I think, to use his word. He had mentioned\r\nthat he liked to--he had gone hunting with some friends, that was the\r\nonly thing he mentioned about the Soviet Union in which I sensed that\r\nhe had been with people except for also mentioning that he had been the\r\ncenter of interest as an American who couldn't drive a car.\r\n\r\nBut apparently he had relished going hunting. He had also said with\r\nresentment, a Soviet citizen could not own a rifle. They could own\r\nshotguns but not a rifle, and that you could shoot a rifle only by\r\njoining a rifle club which he said was a paramilitary organization.\r\n\r\nAgain, this was with a degree of scorn in his voice or his attitude. I\r\nhad assumed that he at least tried the paramilitary organization, the\r\nrifle club, so he could speak with such scorn, with knowledge of what\r\nhe was speaking about.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he tell you that he had joined an organization in\r\nwhich he was permitted to shoot a rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; he did not. I don't know that for a fact. I had assumed\r\nfrom his conversation that he had tried it but I gather that he did not\r\nlike this organization.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did he say anything about having to leave the rifle at the\r\nclub, that you couldn't take the rifle away from the club, or anything\r\nof that kind?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I assume that was true. He didn't mention it, he mentioned\r\nthat a Soviet citizen could not possess a rifle.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he speak of any training that he might have received\r\nin connection with either a rifle or a shotgun while he was in the\r\nSoviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; he didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he indicate to you the degree of facility with which\r\nhe used either of these weapons while he was in the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; he did not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. He--is there anything else he told you about this hunting\r\nclub or this rifle or shotgun that you can remember now?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I am not particularly interested in rifles and hunting\r\nso that I didn't--it was an ideal opportunity--I think he did love\r\nhunting so I think it would have been an ideal way to reach him in a\r\nsomewhat human way.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You got no idea of how much time he was at the rifle club\r\nor what? Did it seem to be a frequent occupation?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I can't say I had any fruitful idea of whether he was\r\na member of it. I assumed he was a member of it. He didn't say he\r\nwas a member of it. I assumed he spoke with authority saying it was\r\na paramilitary organization and somehow conveying the idea that he\r\ndidn't like that aspect of it and, therefore, I assumed he didn't like\r\nit. He spoke only with pleasure of his hunting trip. He mentioned a\r\nhunting trip, I don't think he mentioned them in plural, which he had\r\ntaken with some friends.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember any more details about that hunting trip?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. We talked, this was within the first half hour, the talk was\r\nvery brief.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he ever mention to you this hunting trip or anything\r\nrelating to a rifle or shotgun in the Soviet Union at any later time?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I didn't know what time he was referring to.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I mean at any other time after the first meeting with you\r\ndid he refer again to his activities in the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In connection with this rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; that subject never came up again.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he tell you at this first meeting about his work in\r\nthe Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I had gathered he worked somewhere in a television factory.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he tell you that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; I can't remember whether it was television, it was\r\nelectronics of some sort.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he tell you the nature of his work?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He did not tell me. I thought to myself that if he was in a\r\nvery honorable position there he would have mentioned it. So, I thought\r\nhe was probably just a mechanic of some sort, wiring it together.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he tell you how much he was paid?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I can't remember, I think he did but I don't remember what\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he indicate that he received any income other than\r\nfrom his work?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I don't believe he told me anything about that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. We have been referring primarily here in our questioning\r\nto the first meeting that you had with him, but do you remember any\r\nsubsequent conversation with Oswald about his work, his pay, and his\r\nincome in the Soviet Union after this first meeting?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think he thought it was too low. He thought the standard\r\nof living, he recognized the standard of living was low, and they were\r\nrestricted therefore in their--just too confined, told where to live.\r\nThe food was boring and there was nothing to do. I didn't get the idea\r\nit was lack of money. He did not say anything about lack of money.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I wonder if we could get for our guidance the approximate\r\nnumber of times he saw Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. It was about four times that we had lengthy conversations.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Four times, that is four times prior to the date of the\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Or that includes all the times?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I didn't see him again after the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You didn't see him after the assassination. Four times\r\nprior to the assassination including this one time you have already\r\ndescribed?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes. This is the first meeting before he went to New Orleans\r\nand then about three weekends after he came back----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I think that will be taken up. I just wanted to get in my\r\nmind approximately how many times in all you saw him.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Oswald at any time indicate to you that he was\r\ntreated by the Russian authorities in any way different from ordinary\r\nRussian citizens who occupied a similar status in the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I wasn't aware of that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he tell you about any special training that he had?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; he did not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he mention his living accommodations?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Well, with some kind of resentment he did, that it was\r\nassigned, and I think that is about all he said.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask whether these questions relate to all the four\r\ntimes or just to the first time, are we still on the first?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Basically on the first time, sir, unless we specify to\r\nthe contrary.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Tell us what else you and Oswald discussed during this\r\nfirst meeting that you had?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Unfortunately that first meeting was the clearest one. I\r\nwas asking him questions, taking his answers. I had hoped when I met\r\nthis man to have insights into Russia, both meeting him and meeting his\r\nwife, and interesting talks about the differences between the Russian\r\nsystem and the American, the western system.\r\n\r\nThen I found that he was--some questions, later in the evening, the\r\nconversation was translated into Russian also so that Marina could\r\nfollow along.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You mean after the first half hour when you were\r\npreparing----\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is right, when we came back after dinner to our house.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Your house. So this went on?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. What you have heard now occurred mostly in the first half\r\nhour when I was speaking directly to him when I met him.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Then you returned to Irving to your house and had dinner\r\nand had the additional conversation?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes. Now, in all the subsequent conversations, you are going\r\nto get less information in what he said.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In the first part of this meeting you were alone and in the\r\nsecond part of the meeting there were other people there?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. My wife and Marina was able to join us. At this time Marina\r\nwas packing things for Junie and I noticed that he was speaking very\r\nharshly to her. He was telling her what bag or satchel to take. I\r\ngathered from it, of course, it was in Russian, and I thought to\r\nmyself, here is a little fellow who certainly insists on wearing the\r\npants.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You don't understand Russian yourself?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No. So he spoke loudly to her, and didn't rise from his\r\nseat. But spoke surprisingly harshly especially in front of a guest.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. How did she take this?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. With a bit of umbrage. She didn't like it. It rankled her.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In other words, this half hour conversation took\r\nplace in their apartment?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. While she was packing the bags to go to your home?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was she packing the bags for some days or was this----\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; just bottles, diapers, clothing, something.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. For a weekend?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Just for the evening.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Just for an evening?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't know why it took so long but it did. I guess they\r\nweren't quite ready when I arrived.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What else did you and Oswald speak about during this\r\nevening, do you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. After supper the conversation was translated into Russian,\r\nand I wanted to gather Marina's or get Marina's corroboration of\r\ncertain things he said about Russia and there we found when she had\r\ndiffering opinions from him that he would not let her, he would slap\r\nher down verbally, and not let her express them or say--Ruth told me\r\nlater, he was calling her a fool, \"You don't know anything.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I encountered this, I actually trusted Marina to know--the\r\nquestions I was asking, it seemed to me could be better answered by\r\nMarina, so I wasn't paying very close attention to what he had said\r\nabout that.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could you indicate on what points they seemed to differ or\r\nwhat points that he raised that irritated her or vice versa in their\r\ndiscussion about Russia? You said he slapped her down. I was wondering\r\non what kind of points he slapped her down.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I have unfortunately tried to remember those points myself\r\nwishing, wondering whether hypnosis would bring it out of me as a tape\r\nrecorder, or something. I was interested to know whether the Russians\r\nwere happy with their system, whether they felt the presence of the\r\nSecret Police, these are questions, I don't remember asking them, these\r\nare questions that I would have been interested in.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember any response either from Marina or from\r\nOswald on these points?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. And I don't remember anything specific here. I just remember\r\nthat I encountered too many points, where they apparently differed and,\r\ntherefore, I had in mind I will just wait until she can learn English\r\nand we will get it from the horse's mouth.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you speak with Oswald during this first meeting of\r\nthe circumstances under which he met Marina and married her in Russia?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't remember when I learned that. I think I learned it\r\nfrom Ruth, who had spoken to Marina on this subject.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What did you learn?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. It may have been--I don't remember when it occurred, it may\r\nhave been after the assassination, I may have read it in the paper or\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You don't remember any specific conversations with Oswald\r\non that subject?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Lee Oswald ever speak to you about his experience in\r\nthe United States Marine Corps?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He mentioned that his brother went in the Marine Corps and\r\napparently enjoyed it and he had then, I think he said he had left\r\nschool early to join it and I gathered, I thought to myself, he is\r\nexpecting to find the joy his brother found there and he did not find\r\nit. He did not like the Marine Corps.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he tell you anything--pardon me.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He did not mention that I can recall his exit from the\r\nMarine Corps.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he ever mention the name of Governor Connally in\r\nconnection with his experiences in the Marines?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Not that I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did he ever mention the President in this or any other\r\nconversations?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He mentioned the President only once that I can remember\r\nspecifically; at the ACLU meeting I think.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. At the which?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. At the ACLU meeting I took him to. He had mentioned, he\r\nthought President Kennedy was doing quite a good job in civil rights,\r\nwhich was high praise coming from Lee.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you have any discussion during this first meeting\r\nother than the discussion you have already mentioned concerning\r\nOswald's political beliefs?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. There, of course, I was interested in that subject, found we\r\ndiffered, and then in order to not wrestle with concepts or arguments\r\nthat were unmanageably large, I tried to bring it down to more specific\r\ninstances of how he would like to see the world be.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. How did you become aware of the fact that you differed,\r\ndo you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't remember him making any bones about it the very\r\nfirst meeting. He told me he had become a Marxist, in his own apartment\r\nthere, that he had become a Marxist by reading books and never having\r\nmet a Communist in this country.\r\n\r\nAnd he also then told me with a certain sadness or regret that he\r\ncouldn't speak about political and economic subjects with his people,\r\nand fellows at work.\r\n\r\n(At this point Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You were going to mention specific areas of political\r\ndiscussion that you had with him.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. One other thing happened in this first half hour, the\r\nmost fruitful half hour I had ever had with him. He had mentioned\r\nhis employer. I probably asked him why did he leave this country to\r\ngo to the Soviet Union, and his supreme theme in this regard is the\r\nexploitation of man by man, by which he means one man making a profit\r\nout of another man's labor, which is the normal employment situation in\r\nthis country and to which he found--took, felt great resentment.\r\n\r\nHe was aware that his employer made--he made more money for his\r\nemployer than he was paid and specifically he mentioned how his\r\nemployer of the engraving company goods and chattels that he had,\r\nthat Oswald didn't have, and with some specific resentment toward\r\nthis employer, and I thought privately to myself that this resentment\r\nmust show through if he ever meets his employer, it must sort of show\r\nthrough and that his employer wouldn't find that man very attractive.\r\nSo this was his guiding theme.\r\n\r\nThe reason it appears that this country, the system in this country had\r\nto go, had to be changed, was because of this supreme immoral way of\r\nmanaging affairs here, the exploitation of man by man which occurs in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nWe discussed about it occurring in the Soviet Union, the taxation of a\r\nman's labor, it occurs there also, and it appeared that only, he seemed\r\nto agree or sometimes I had to feed him, this conversation now is a\r\nlater one, when we were talking about the specifics of exploitation of\r\nman by man, he agreed that the only difference was that in the Soviet\r\nUnion it is a choice which is impersonal.\r\n\r\nThe person who decides the man's wages and labor does not stand to gain\r\nby it whereas in this country the man who decides stands to gain by it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The man who decides what, to employ the other man?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; what wage to pay him.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What wage to pay him?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Or what his return shall be. So that was the only--the most\r\nimportant, by far economic and political almost, let's call it economic\r\ndoctrine he held.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he translate that economic doctrine to specific\r\npolicies that he thought should be adopted or specific changes that\r\nshould be made in the structure of this country?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I had never, to my satisfaction, uncovered an area of\r\nprogressive change that he would advocate. I asked him how did he think\r\nthis change was going to come about, and he never answered that.\r\n\r\nAnd it seemed to me he was critical of almost everything that occurs\r\nin this country. So that he did not--I did not come to--did not know\r\nof anything in which he could see a progressive evolutionary change or\r\npolicies that could be pushed in order to promote his ideals.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did he react academically, intellectually,\r\nviolently or in what way did he express these views?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Well, he was quite dogmatic. First he wanted to put me in a\r\ncategory. In one of the later talks--when we first met he talked very\r\nfreely and then I think as we made, in later conversations, I had to do\r\nmore and more of it--make more and more effort to draw something out of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn his later conversations, Ruth found him so bothersome.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What was that word?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Bothersome, that she couldn't join the conversations. He\r\nwould get too angry or too----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. He resented the probing or the questioning?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; he did not really resent the probing. For instance, take\r\nthis issue of the exploitation of man by man. When we had boiled it\r\ndown to this rather fine difference or technical difference that one\r\nwas done by an impersonal body and one was done personal.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The Soviet being the first and the American being the\r\nsecond?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct. That being then the crux of the matter and\r\nthe reason this is the matter to be changed, if we were to follow the\r\nlogic of the discussion, many arguments seemed to approach at that kind\r\nof a point where it is just logic or reason just didn't seem to work\r\nor hold water in this case, and we were left then with the starkness of\r\nhis statement that this was an unforgivable moral sin, and he called\r\nit a moral sin or I questioned him to that effect, and so he thought\r\nit was a moral sin and he thought he was moral by adhering to that\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did he appear to enjoy these give and takes\r\nbetween you and himself or did he resent them as you proceeded in your\r\ndiscussions?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't think he resented them. I noticed at times he got\r\nquite hot under the collar and I noticed that he was holding his,\r\nstaying on a steady keel even better than I was, as though he had had\r\nconsiderable practice in sticking to, controlling himself, holding his\r\nposition and not getting ruffled.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But in this process over a period of time during\r\nthese four discussions he never deviated from his basic thesis?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes. Of course, as I said to the others, I don't believe\r\nwhether you were here, we only had about four talks altogether,\r\nand I later came to realize that if he were to have abandoned any\r\none of these or have abandoned that one in particular, that would\r\nhave undermined his whole philosophy, would humanly itself quite\r\nunreasonable to expect a fundamental exchange within an evening, just\r\nbecause of a logical compulsion or logical argument or something.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you get the impression that he felt both systems, the\r\nAmerican system and the Soviet system involved the exploitation of man\r\nby man except it was a different exploiter?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I gathered--I was irked because it seemed to me the\r\ndifference that he accepted as a sufficient difference, the one in\r\nthe Soviet Union was impersonal, that he was not, in other words--he\r\nadmitted in the Soviet Union that the tax rate which was a general term\r\nthen for the amount of money or reward that is not returned of what a\r\nman makes, was higher in the Soviet Union. He agreed that that could\r\nbe true, and didn't seem to be dismayed at that. So I did not find\r\ncriticism of the Soviet Union on that score.\r\n\r\nAnd in fact he didn't--I didn't discover in what ways he would like to\r\ntry to change the Soviet Union except he didn't like the restrictions\r\non his freedom there. Neither did he see there was any connection\r\nbetween the restrictions on freedom there and the freedom we have here\r\nwithout control of how the relationship between men would be governed.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did he ever go into the question of the relative position\r\nof labor in the United States from the point of view of its freedom of\r\nbargaining and the control of labor in the Soviet Union? Did that ever\r\ncome up?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No. I think, I can't remember whether it was a conversation\r\nI had directly with him or immediately after, I was following this\r\nidea that here we feel we have quite a different attitude about\r\nexploitation. Somebody--he felt exploited and he thought all the\r\nworking class was exploited, and he also thought they were brainwashed,\r\nand he also thought that churches were all alike, all the religious\r\nsects were the same and they were all apparatus of the power structure\r\nto maintain itself in power.\r\n\r\nWhen I pointed out that our church was financed by people like myself,\r\nwhen I contribute so many dollars to the church, he just shrugged his\r\nshoulders. It didn't--his views still stood and it also permitted him,\r\nI think, gave him the moral ground to dismiss my arguments because I\r\nwas here just a product of my environment and I didn't know better and\r\nhe had the word from the enlightenment, that he knew the truth and\r\ntherefore I was just spouting the line that was fed to me by the power\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I think you mentioned before that he had wanted to put\r\nyou in a category, categorize you. Did he indicate to you during that\r\nfirst conversation that he had concluded what category?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; it was over several conversations, I suppose it was the\r\nlast conversation we had, he couldn't put me in a category and he named\r\nabout seven or eight categories.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What were they?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I wasn't a Bircher, I wasn't a liberal, a Communist, a\r\nSocialist, probably something to do with religion, something like that,\r\natheist.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. He didn't say whether you were a Republican or Democrat?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't believe he was concerned about that.\r\n\r\n(Laughter.)\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I am sure he would see no distinction between the two\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. So he concluded that he was unable to categorize you?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes. And I also felt as soon as he had realized that that he\r\ncould then dismiss me as not something that functions in this world,\r\nnot one of the forces or the opposing camps he has to contend with.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You mentioned that your wife became bothered or Oswald\r\nproved bothersome to your wife. Could you tell us in what way Oswald\r\nwas bothersome to Mrs. Paine?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Well, I think one of the most outstanding was in this\r\ndiscussion of religions and I was trying to suggest that religions\r\ndid embody many of the values of many people and so the conversation\r\nwas trying to talk about those values quite apart from--I think the\r\nRussian, I think Marina's view of religion is quite primitive--never\r\nmind Marina. Ruth was bothered by his logic or argument being of no\r\navail. She would be content, you know if he had followed the laws of\r\ndebate or something, you present evidence and he presents opposite\r\nevidence and you try to answer, let one answer the other. But when he\r\ncouldn't answer he would just state his belief and there he followed\r\nthe Communist line.\r\n\r\nHe talked something about feudalism, or the church being more powerful\r\nin feudalism than it was today and he tried to explain why that was.\r\n\r\nI had then suggested that maybe science was instrumental as an\r\nalternative explanation to his explanation but instead of supporting\r\nfurther his view, which just didn't make sense to me, he just restated\r\nit. Well, this kind of thing.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Upset your wife?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; you just couldn't enter the conversation deeper.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember any other conversation, you and Oswald\r\nhad during this first evening that you met?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. From the first day, are you going back to?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think we probably spoke, I was trying still to find common\r\nground with him, and I think we probably spoke critically of the far\r\nright. It even seems to me we may have mentioned Walker.\r\n\r\nI had been bothered at the time that Walker had--I guess it doesn't do\r\nany good to enter into the matter because I don't remember his response.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you mention Walker's name during the first meeting?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. My memory is very foggy. But I would take it as--this was an\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Give us your best recollection, and I want to ask you\r\nagain this was in early April 1963, that you had this conversation, is\r\nthat correct?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. It was that first meeting when we had them over to dinner\r\nand Ruth can give you the date of that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. For the benefit of the Commission the record indicates\r\nit was about April 2, 1963, that that occurred. Tell us to the best of\r\nyour recollection what the conversation about General Walker was at\r\nthat time?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think he had mentioned, a friend of ours had a German wife\r\nand she just achieved her citizenship papers, and this had been done at\r\nthe ceremony and General Walker had been invited to lead the singing,\r\nconducted by June Davis who is somewhat old and slipped into error\r\nof calling him Judge Walker every once in a while, and it somewhat\r\noffended this friend of ours who was aware of why she liked this\r\ncountry, freedoms, and liberties and values that are expressed here.\r\nAnd she was rather sorry that Walker should take it upon himself to\r\ndefine, to these stupid foreigners or these ignorant foreigners, what\r\nthis country stands for. So I think I mentioned this episode to him.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Him being Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Oswald, and I think he smiled and nodded his assent. I don't\r\nthink he said any--I don't think he made any important remarks about\r\nWalker.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember anything that he said about Walker at all?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think that is the only time, probably the only time we\r\nmentioned Walker.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. To refresh my recollection, there was about 2 days or----\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. 8 days before.\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. It was on the 10th.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did he indicate in any way that he knew about General\r\nWalker at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. We seemed to agree at least superficially that in thinking\r\nthe far right was unfortunate in its thoughts.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he say anything or do anything that would lead you to\r\nbelieve that he planned an attack on General Walker?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Absolutely not.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did he indicate in any way that he knew about General\r\nWalker's activities and beliefs and position on public affairs?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. When I went to the ACLU meeting he then got up, stood up and\r\nreported what had happened at the meeting of the far right which had\r\noccurred at convention hall the day before, U.N. Day, they called it\r\nU.S. Day, and I think Walker had spoken then.\r\n\r\nFrom this I gathered that he was doing more or less the same thing--I\r\nthought he was, I didn't inquire how he spent his free time but I\r\nsupposed he was going around to right wing groups being familiarizing\r\nhimself for whatever his purposes were as I was.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Is that prior to the conversation you have talked about?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; this is after this conversation.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. This is after this conversation and I only had this, this\r\nwas the only concrete evidence I had of how he spent, might have spent\r\nsome of his time. It happened in the ACLU meeting in late October. I\r\nsuppose he was familiar with the right-wing groups and activities, and\r\nmovements. And certainly familiar with Walker; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Confining the Senator's question to the meeting in April,\r\nhe didn't indicate in any way that he was familiar with Walker's\r\nattitude or activities?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He was familiar with Walker. He knew who Walker was, there\r\nwas no doubt about that. We were talking about Walker.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. To find some common ground.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. He didn't say he knew where Walker lived or anything of\r\nthat kind. That didn't come up?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he indicate any understanding to you at that April\r\nmeeting of Walker's attitude?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't think he singled out Walker as--I had the impression\r\nthat he was quite familiar with Walker and probably familiar with\r\nthe names of various right-wing groups, shall we say, the Christian\r\nScience, not the Christian Science, I have forgotten the names of\r\nvarious organizations.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you relate to Oswald this story about Walker speaking\r\nat the meeting or the ceremony at which the immigrants were given their\r\ncitizenship?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I believe I did; yes. I believe that is what I said about\r\nWalker at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What was his response to that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. And I think he didn't say much. I think he smiled and nodded\r\nhis head and did that kind of thing. He may have said just a few words.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you take it that Oswald agreed with the views that\r\nyou expressed?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, after this first meeting----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I interrupt you again, I don't want to interrupt\r\nyour train too much but I think you had said that during this\r\nconversation that you did have some discussion about right-wing groups.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. And their position and activities, and so forth. In\r\nthat discussion were individuals named or members assumed to be members\r\nof that group?\r\n\r\n(At this point Representative Ford left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. It is possible we would have mentioned Welch. I don't think\r\nI would have mentioned Welch, I didn't know anything specifically about\r\nthe John Birch Society at the time.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Was Walker, he was talking about Walker?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He was the only one whose name was mentioned.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Are you sure whether or not Oswald made any comment at\r\nany time during this conversation about Walker?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't remember, as I say, I remember it very vaguely but\r\nI remember telling that instance of his conducting that ceremony.\r\nBut--and Walker was known, I knew that Walker was known to Lee. And at\r\nleast it achieved a certain feeling of similarity there, even though\r\nthe similarity was only superficial in our views and feelings about it.\r\nI don't think he went on to describe any--it was mostly a ploy on my\r\npart to curry him or make him feel more at ease.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. It was clear to you at that time that both you and\r\nMr. Oswald had an adverse view of General Walker and did not think\r\nfavorably of him, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Had you heard of Lee Oswald before you had occasion to go\r\nand pick him up that time and bring him to your house for dinner?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; I heard about him as soon as Ruth had been invited to\r\nthis party back in February, whenever it was.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What was the basis of your wife's interest in the Oswalds\r\nand of your interest in the Oswalds?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Everett Glover invited us knowing that Ruth was studying\r\nRussian and that--asked us if we would be interested in meeting\r\nthis--they were presented to us as an American who had defected to\r\nRussia and decided he didn't like it and came back and brought a\r\nRussian wife with him. Would we like to meet these people? Yes, that\r\nsounded interesting.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was this the Fort Worth group?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; this is in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. After this first meeting with Lee Oswald when was the\r\nnext time that you saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That would be after he returned, when Marina was living with\r\nus, when he returned, we thought he returned from looking for work from\r\nHouston but apparently it had been his trip to Mexico.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Tell us the circumstances of how you met him and what\r\nhappened at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could we have the date of this?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. This would have been what, early October or late\r\nSeptember of 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think Marina was there about a week, at least a week\r\nbefore he came, if she came the 24th of September, which comes to my\r\nmind, it would be in the early part of October. I would normally appear\r\nat the house on Fridays, sometimes occasionally on Sundays, I would\r\ncome on Friday evening, and----\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You were separated from your wife at this time?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you had your own apartment at Arlington, Tex.?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Grand Prairie.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Grand Prairie.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't particularly remember, the occasions don't stand out\r\none from another. The first two meetings, I think were before he found\r\nwork, and at first I talked a little bit about the problem of finding\r\nwork with him.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. These were the first two meetings after the preliminary\r\nmeeting?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes. While Marina was staying with us.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Go through your testimony, Mr. Paine and tell us as best\r\nyou can recall how many times you saw Oswald after his return from New\r\nOrleans, up until the time of his assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think I saw him every weekend on Friday; I think he was\r\nthere except for the weekend, before the assassination, exceptional.\r\n\r\nI would arrive on Tuesday or Wednesdays and, of course, he was not\r\nthere and there was Ruth and Marina. I would simply come in on Sunday\r\nwhen he was generally there.\r\n\r\nAlso, I quite specifically remember on the long holiday he had some\r\nperiod there, I don't remember, what celebration it is, when Bell did\r\nnot have that day off and he did, so he was there that morning, a\r\nMonday morning on that date of that holiday, perhaps you can feed me\r\nthe date.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would that be November 8th, 9th and 10th, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was that the last time you saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That would be correct; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, tell us the circumstances about how Oswald arrived\r\nin Irving upon his return from New Orleans as best you can recall it,\r\nwhat happened, what was said.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I must not have been there when the phone call arrived but\r\nI think Ruth reported it to me so that Ruth said that Marina was very\r\npleased, very happy to receive this call, a surprise or something. I\r\nthink I had at one or two times seen her answer a call from him, and\r\nI observed she was glad to have this call from him but I wasn't there\r\nwhen he first called, I don't believe.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was that the call from New Orleans to Irving?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; that is the call from somewhere in Dallas to Irving\r\nasking if he could come out. I don't know of a call from New Orleans to\r\nIrving.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he subsequently come out to the house in Irving that\r\nweekend?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Then he came out that weekend. I suppose he came out on a\r\nFriday and it was probably before I got over there, I arrived about six.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember if he was there when you arrived home\r\nthat weekend?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't remember that. I think he was there; yes. I think he\r\nwas there because otherwise I would have seen that meeting. I did not\r\nsee them first embrace each other.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he say anything to you about where he had been?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I thought I knew where he had been. Ruth had told me he\r\nwas looking for work in Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Ruth had told you that before this date?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. There was no conversation among any one at that time\r\nabout Oswald having been in Mexico.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; it was a complete surprise to Ruth and myself. When we\r\nsaw this letter where he mentioned having been to Mexico, Ruth took it\r\nas an example of his colossal lying.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Tell us about this letter, what were the circumstances\r\nsurrounding that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He had written a letter using her typewriter and her desk to\r\na party I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is Ruth's typewriter and desk?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Ruth's typewriter and he left the rough draft of the letter\r\non her desk, not folded, just out there on her desk, in English. Ruth\r\nhad given me the impression it was there for a couple of days. Actually\r\nit was there for a day and a half or so. I think he wrote it on\r\nSaturday and we then moved the furniture on Sunday night.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. This would be Saturday, November what?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. This might be that holiday November. I don't remember for\r\nsure about that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Mr. Paine, you and I discussed this question yesterday\r\nand I asked you whether you recalled seeing Oswald again after you had\r\ndiscussed this letter with your wife. What did you tell me?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I thought probably not but we figured out the dates from my\r\nprobable reaction that I read that letter and then had I encountered\r\nhim again I would have had a different, I would have had questions or\r\nfeelings or something in response to this letter and since I didn't\r\nencounter him with those feelings I must not have seen him again.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. So that would place the date of your seeing this letter\r\nas approximately shortly after the weekend of November 8, 9, and 10?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I show you Commission Exhibit 103 and ask you if you\r\never saw the original of this letter and if you did to tell us the\r\ncircumstances surrounding that event.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; I saw this letter. I remembered most of the contents.\r\nI apparently didn't remember that he didn't use his real name, I was\r\nreading something else at the time and Ruth handed me this letter and\r\nit took a while--I didn't read it as thoroughly as I could have.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could you tell us just briefly the contents of this letter\r\njust for the record?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Yes, sir; apparently it is a draft of a letter that\r\nOswald wrote in his own hand. The Commission does have a copy of the\r\nactual letter, and it was a letter to the Russian Embassy, I believe in\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The Russian Embassy in Washington?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Yes, sir; in which he tells them about his trip to\r\nMexico and his political activity on behalf of the Fair Play for Cuba\r\nCommittee. I believe it includes the words \"notorious FBI,\" which is no\r\nlonger interested in his political activity in Texas.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Was this letter ever sent?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I believe it was.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. There was a letter sent like this? You said you had the\r\noriginal?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. It is in evidence.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What was sent, a letter like this?\r\n\r\nMr. RANKIN. A redraft.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. A redraft.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Typewritten copy.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. This letter refers to the fact that Oswald had been in\r\nMexico, does it not?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; it tells of his visit to the Cuban Consul and the\r\nSoviet Embassy there.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did your wife call that to your attention when she showed\r\nyou this letter?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. We took it, she took it, and I likewise took it as somewhat\r\nof a fabricated story, I didn't suppose he had been down to Mexico. I\r\nread \"Dear Sirs\" there, I read \"Dear Lisa.\" I thought he was writing to\r\na friend, and Ruth pointed out to me after I had given the letter back\r\nto her, Ruth was somewhat irked that I didn't take more interest in the\r\nthing. I think I might have--no, I don't know as I might have since I\r\nmight have dismissed it as a lie but anyway Ruth was irked and didn't\r\nshow it to me again and I asked her now what was in that letter that I\r\ndidn't see and she didn't tell me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. This was all prior to the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What did she say to you?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Ruth was quite bothered by that letter, and apparently\r\nhad--apparently I hadn't really taken it in. I said, \"The heck with it.\r\nYes; it is a fantastic lie, isn't that amazing that he will fabricate\r\nsuch stories here.\"\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What did she say?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; she said--she approached me and said, \"I never realized\r\nhow much he could lie\" or that he was a liar or something like that,\r\nand \"I want you to read this letter.\" So I put aside the thing I was\r\nreading in which I was more interested and read most of the letter, not\r\nthe latter part about having used another name.\r\n\r\nAnd then I thought it was too personal, \"Dear Lisa,\" so I thought he\r\nwas telling her, being rather braggadocio telling about his exploits\r\nwhich were rather imaginary and I put it out of my mind. Then later\r\nRuth asked me what did I think about it----\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. This was before the assassination that she asked you this?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think so.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was it later the same day?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I think it probably was another day but I don't\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What did she say?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Well, she was--I think I said, \"Let me see that letter\r\nagain,\" and she said, \"No; if you didn't absorb it, never mind.\" So,\r\nheck, if she felt that way, I wasn't going to bother. My first impulse\r\nwas to throw it aside and pay no attention to it. If she felt that way\r\nI continued to do it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Who brought the letter up the second time, did Ruth bring\r\nit up?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; Ruth brought it up.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember whether there was any event that caused\r\nher to bring it up or did she bring it up out of the clear blue sky or\r\nwhat?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't remember having slept with her but I have the\r\nimpression she brought it up while I was in bed anyway. So it might\r\nhave been, just be, I was staying late that night also, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you know that Oswald had given Marina a charm made\r\nout of a Mexican peso at the time that you read this letter?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you learn about that at any time prior to the\r\nassassination?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Not that I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you note the fact that Oswald had a record of Mexican\r\nmusic in your home prior to the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I didn't know that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you subsequently learn that Oswald had given Marina\r\nthis charm made from a Mexican peso?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Under what circumstances?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. The FBI came out and they were wondering whether Oswald had\r\nused my shop to mount his sight so we went out to look at the shop and\r\ntools and we looked at the threading tap and what not, the threading\r\ntap looked as though it hadn't been used but the drill press seemed to\r\nhave little chips of metal on it and then Ruth remembered that he had\r\ngone in there and used the drill press to have drilled out this coin\r\nwhich Marina put around her neck, and I think she then mentioned it was\r\na peso. But it hadn't sunk into Ruth with significance of its being a\r\npeso, hadn't impressed itself upon her prior to the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. So that neither you nor your wife believed that Oswald\r\nhad been in Mexico prior to the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. You will have to ask Ruth about that. That was my impression\r\nhe hadn't been there.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Your wife hadn't said anything to you that indicated that\r\nshe believed it?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, you mentioned before the fact that you had gone with\r\nOswald to a meeting of the American Civil Liberties Union, is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When did you do that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That was the day after Stevenson had been stoned.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you tell us the circumstances of that event?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That was a Friday I had intended to go, I had also invited\r\nFrank Krystinik for his first visit, I had been telling him about the\r\nACLU. So I invited Lee to come thinking it might be part--I was not\r\nreally talking to him very much, but just being civil but I thought it\r\nmight be helpful for him to see something in which I was interested,\r\nthat I might find some way that he might find an interest, something\r\nconstructive to do.\r\n\r\nSo, I took him in my car, he and I alone, and on the way, which takes\r\nabout 35 minutes, described the ACLU to him, and he didn't know about\r\nit, and described its purpose. Then we went to the meeting which was a\r\nmeeting, first we saw a movie called \"Suspect,\" I think it was showing\r\nhow a candidate lost, who had won handily in a previous election, lost\r\nafter a smear campaign in Washington State, which it had been brought\r\nout that his wife had once been a Communist Party member.\r\n\r\nI didn't think the movie showed very much, but the meeting, the\r\ndiscussion following the movie, there were two people who gave little\r\ntalks about the movie and the principles involved afterward, this--do\r\nyou want to break?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Who went with you in the car to the meeting, just you and\r\nMr. Oswald or was Mr. Krystinik with you?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; Krystinik came in his own car, so just Lee and myself.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Go ahead with your story.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I thought the meeting was conducted in a manner that\r\nillustrated its own beliefs. One of the things said was that the\r\nBirchers must not be considered anti-Semitic, anti-Semites because they\r\nare also Birchers.\r\n\r\nLee at this point got up, speaking loud and clear and coherently,\r\nsaying that, reporting that, he had been to this meeting of the\r\nright-wing group the night before or two nights before and he refuted\r\nthis statement, saying names and saying how that people on the platform\r\nspeaking for the Birch Society had said anti-Semitic things and also\r\nanti-Catholic statements or spoke against the Pope or something.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember what Oswald said?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I don't remember. He said something very similar to,\r\n\"I disagree with what had just been said,\" and I do remember that it\r\ncontained both some corroboration of his points of view. There had been\r\nsome kind of an anti-Semitic statement and criticism of the Pope.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Oswald seemed to make a convincing argument and seemed to\r\nmake sense?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That was good speaking. It was out of keeping with the mood\r\nof the meeting and nobody followed it up in a similar manner but I\r\nthink it was accepted as--it made sense; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did anybody else say anything in response to Oswald's\r\nremarks?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What happened then later on in the meeting?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Later on in the meeting, when the meeting broke up, people\r\nclustered into discussion groups, and Frank, I told Frank, who was a\r\ncolleague at work, Frank Krystinik, about Lee and Marina, and so of\r\ncourse he immediately came to defend free enterprise and what not in\r\nopposition to this fellow I told him about, and I left the discussion\r\nat that point, thinking I knew the kind of discussion it would be.\r\n\r\nIt was a discussion between three people, a more elderly man whom I\r\nprobably thought was a member of the ACLU, and Frank and Lee.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you hear any part of the discussion?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I didn't hear any part of the discussion.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you subsequently discuss it with either Oswald or\r\nKrystinik?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. And in the car going home, Lee asked me if I knew this man\r\nhe had been talking to, this older man he had been talking to, and I\r\nthink he said that the man seemed to be friendly to Cuba or rather he\r\nsaid, \"Do you think that man is a Communist?\" And I said, \"No.\" And\r\nthen he said something, \"I think he is.\" Then I asked him why and I\r\nthink he said something in regard to Cuba or sympathy with Cuba, and\r\nthen I thought to myself, well, that is rather feeble evidence for\r\nproving a Communist.\r\n\r\nBut he seemed to have the attitude of, felt he wanted to meet that\r\nman again and was pleased he had met him. I thought to myself if that\r\nis the way he has to meet his Communists, he has not yet found the\r\nCommunist group in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was there a Communist group in Dallas, to your knowledge?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Not to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Oswald ever speak of a Communist group in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; he did not. I had the impression, this I remember\r\nclearly that he had not found the group with similar feelings to his.\r\nI then asked Frank in regard to, I can't remember when I asked Frank\r\nbut I asked Frank about the same conversation and whether he thought\r\nthat this third man was a Communist. And he thought no, he thought the\r\nother man was a better--Frank almost got into a fight with Lee, and the\r\nother man was more receptive or didn't argue with him, or drew him out\r\nbetter, Frank used the word, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Drew Oswald out better?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Drew Oswald out better. But he didn't gather the impression\r\nthat he was favoring Castro or Cuba.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What else did you and Oswald say on the way home after\r\nthe meeting?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. So I was describing to him the purpose of the ACLU, and\r\nhe said specifically, I can remember this, after I had described it\r\nand said that I was a member, that he couldn't join an organization\r\nlike that, it wasn't political and he said something or responded in\r\nsome manner, which indicated surprise that I could be concerned about\r\njoining an organization simply to defend, whose purpose it is, shall we\r\nsay, to defend, free speech, free speech, per se, your freedom as well\r\nas mine.\r\n\r\nHe was aware of enjoying his freedom to speak but he didn't seem to be\r\naware of the more general principle of freedom to speak for everyone\r\nwhich has value in itself. And I think it took him by surprise that a\r\nperson could be concerned about a value like that rather than political\r\nobjective of some sort, and this was, struck me as a new idea and it\r\nstruck me that he must never have met people who paid more than lip\r\nservice, he wasn't familiar with the ways of expressing this value.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you say anything to him about the activities of the\r\nCivil Liberties Union in connection with the defense of people accused\r\nof crimes under certain conditions?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; I am sure I told him that it came to the defense of all\r\npeople who didn't seem to be receiving adequate help when it seemed to\r\nbe an issue involving the Bill of Rights. I was then--that was a pang\r\nof sorrow that occurred after the assassination when I realized that he\r\nhad then subsequently, a fortnight later, joined the ACLU, and still\r\ndidn't quite seem to perceive its purpose, and then I realized--I had\r\nalso perceived earlier that he was still a young fellow and I had been\r\nexpecting rather a lot of him, when I first approached meeting him;\r\nthis man had been to Russia and had been back and I had been--met some\r\nothers who had been around the world like that and they are powerful\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Oswald impress you that way?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. And he did not impress me that way; no.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Oswald respond to your, or did you request Oswald or\r\ndid you suggest to him that he join the ACLU?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I don't think I was eager to have him join until he knew\r\nwhat was what about it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. During the time after the ACLU meeting did Oswald say\r\nanything about his discussion with Mr. Krystinik?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I don't believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you subsequently discuss that with Mr. Krystinik?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What did you say and what did he say?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He told me how he had argued, that he had pointed out that\r\nhe had employed a few people himself, he works at Bell but on the side,\r\nat night he had done a little extra business and had employed other\r\npeople, and had to receive from them more than he paid them, that he\r\nreceived from their labor, for their product, more than he paid them\r\nbut that he created work and jobs, and he was fully--and he was ready\r\nto defend his way of that activity and was presenting that against\r\nLee's criticism and apparently encountered the same kind of nonsequitur\r\nresponse or no response from him or Lee's response didn't--Lee\r\npresented his opposing view against it without any issue.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You mentioned that Krystinik and Oswald had almost gotten\r\ninto a fight, did Krystinik tell you that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think it was Frank who told me that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Can you tell us more about that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I am sure Frank would not haul off and slug him, but just\r\nFrank said he got pretty mad at this. I think Frank was using that\r\nexpression to me only, you know, saying how irked he was at Lee.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. He didn't indicate that Oswald had threatened any\r\nphysical violence toward him in connection with the argument, did he?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Oh, no; I think Lee knows how to keep his temper, knows how\r\nto control himself.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Might I ask a question at this time? Earlier you\r\ntalked about your, I think your, first meeting with Oswald and your\r\nconversation with him?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You said, you talked about, the fact that subsequently\r\nyour wife was bothered by his attitude?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. She was bothered by----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I am not going into that.\r\n\r\nNow, you have talked about this conversation with Mr. Krystinik?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Krystinik.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. In which they reached some point in which further\r\ndiscussion was not, if not impossible, was at least difficult between\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nFrom these experiences you had was there a situation, that after some\r\narguments or discussion of economic or political issues, he would reach\r\na point in which he relied upon certain fixed positions that he held\r\nabout which he would not admit of any further discussion or argument?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct. He would just present his dogmatic view and\r\nthen one was at loss to find any way to get off that impasse.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. When he was questioned about that view or when an\r\nattempt was made to argue that view with him, would he then become\r\nangry or disturbed in any way?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. The time that I reported I was angry and I noticed he was\r\nholding his temper pretty well and I wasn't going to let him hold his\r\ntemper better than mine.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you see indication----\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I saw he was angry, his hands trembled a little bit.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. But he was dogged, I think he was practiced or skilled or\r\ntook pride in this was a kind of struggle or fight that he would do\r\nthis, and he would do it for a long time.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Clench his fists and put them together?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; it was expressing this as a mood.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. He would hold himself back?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He would oppose himself to you steadily, and it seemed to me\r\nhe liked to put himself in a position of belligerence or opposition,\r\nand he would just hold his ground or something, was accustomed to doing\r\nthat and expected to stick it out. It reminded me a little bit of\r\nLawrence of Arabia when Lawrence held the match that burned down to his\r\nfinger and the fellows asked him what is the trick? He said no trick\r\nyou just learn how to stand the pain.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I have to go and I would like to ask a few questions.\r\n\r\nI ask these questions to get a certain background of his views which\r\nyou have said he finally came to some fixed position which he would\r\nhold and would not move and there was no brooking of real argument on\r\nthat position.\r\n\r\nYou said earlier in response to a question by counsel that he did not\r\nbelieve there was any possibility of any evolutionary progress in this\r\ncountry, at least upon this issue of economic change.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. This he never said that specifically. But I would ask him\r\nwhat policy should we take or I was trying to find if he didn't have\r\nsome avenue of following a policy in this country.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you direct questions to him which showed some\r\nevolution in our own economic ideas and theories which he either\r\nrefused to accept----\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; I did. I mean I tried to show him how labor and\r\nmanagement, first labor had a right, I was criticizing labor for the\r\nrigid position it is getting us into now----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. He would not accept that idea of evolution?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think he did not accept it; yes.\r\n\r\nHe didn't have patience with it.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Is that also a tenet of the Communist dogma, do you\r\nknow?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't believe, I don't know whether you can say there is\r\na single Communist dogma of that sort. I suppose there are some groups\r\nthat feel that way and others don't.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did he indicate any other way in which he thought that\r\neconomic change might come about in the United States?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He did not indicate or reveal to me how he thought it would\r\ncome about and I on several occasions felt by his, perceived from his\r\nattitude or felt impelled by his attitude to say that the values that\r\nI held dear were diminished in a situation of violence, to which he\r\nremained silent and I took it as disagreement. But I don't remember if\r\nhe had said that.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. He remained silent when you spoke about that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. When I said I was opposed to violence or said, why, when I\r\nsaid that he remained silent and I took it----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You took it that he disagreed in any way by your\r\nstatement?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Well, just by the way he would sort of withdraw.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. He did not agree with your position?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He did not agree; no.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. That violence was unacceptable as a means of change?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is right, and I don't think he perceived also, was a\r\nwar of the kind of values that I am--tolerance, for instance seems to\r\nme disappears when strained situations----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did you discuss at least the kind of economic changes\r\nthat had occurred in Russia by means of violence?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I was trying to find out whether he thought it was going\r\nto come by revolution or not and he never did say, I never got an\r\nanswer as to how he thought this change was going to come. He did not\r\nreveal constructive, or from my point of view, constructive effort to\r\nmake.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did he ever discuss the revolution in Russia where by\r\nmeans of violence the change had come about?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He did not. That would have been the kind of argument I\r\nwould have accepted, a normal kind that you would have accepted it as\r\nevidence here is the normal way to produce it, but he never said that.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did he ever say any way in which he was expecting\r\nRussia or any other country to indicate that he felt the use of\r\nviolence had produced good?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No. As I say he did not--I would have accepted that argument\r\nas a debating argument but he didn't bring it up.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. That is all.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did he say or did you get the impression that he felt that\r\nviolence was the only way to improve things, let's say, in the United\r\nStates?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I felt he was so disgusted with the whole system that he\r\ndidn't see a way that was worthwhile fussing around trying to modify\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Other than violence or he didn't go that far?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He didn't mention advocating violence or didn't say anything\r\nin regard to violence but he did seem to me he didn't see dismissed as\r\ntrivial, no difference between the parties so why join one party or\r\nanother. They were all the same.\r\n\r\nChurches--there is no avenue out that way. Education--there is nothing\r\nthere. So that he never revealed to me any constructive way that wasn't\r\nviolent.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did he think that communism was different from capitalism\r\nin this respect?\r\n\r\n(Short recess.)\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. All right, gentlemen, the Commission will be in order.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What I was getting at with my question was as to whether\r\nhe thought that probably violence was necessary with respect to both\r\nsystems to achieve the millennium that he sought or did he think it was\r\njust necessary with regard to the American system.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He didn't reveal to me to my satisfaction what criticism he\r\nfound of the Soviet Union. He had indicated he didn't like it. But I\r\nwasn't aware that he was proposing to change that system also in some\r\nway. Neither did he ever speak, he never spoke to me, in a way that I\r\ncould see a paradise, see his paradise. He spoke only, he was opposed\r\nto exploitation of man by man. That was his motivating power.\r\n\r\n(At this point Senator Cooper left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Oswald indicate to you in any way that he had been\r\npresent at the right-wing rally that was held in Dallas the night\r\nbefore Stevenson appeared in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He indicated that at the ACLU meeting.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he say he had met anybody there?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Not that I recall, no.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he mention speaking to anyone at that meeting?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he tell you whether or not he was at the Stevenson\r\nmeeting itself?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I guess I didn't ask him that. I remember asking myself\r\nsubsequently what was the answer to that question and I couldn't answer\r\nit then and I can't answer it now.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You have no recollection of his mentioning it at all?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No, I don't remember what--I think I assumed that he had\r\nbut----\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You assumed that he had been at the Stevenson affair?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think I assumed that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you have any basis for that assumption?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. There had been some discussion in the ACLU, some other\r\npeople had gotten up and had spoken of that awful last night, I guess,\r\nthis was the previous night, that awful time and I think he seemed to\r\nnod his assent. That was my----\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You inferred from that that he had possibly been present\r\nat the Stevenson meeting?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. There was no other basis for your assumption in that\r\nregard?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. On the weekend of November 8, 9, and 10, do you recall\r\nwhen you came to your house in Irving?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Well, I would come out regularly on Friday after cashing my\r\ncheck at the bank.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember coming on Friday evening on the 8th of\r\nNovember?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't remember any break in that habit.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you recall whether or not Oswald was present at your\r\nhome on the Friday evening November 8, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I don't specifically remember that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You don't remember one way or the other?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Were you at the house on Saturday? November 9th?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I was at the house probably on Saturday and certainly on\r\nSunday. I think that weekend I remember stepping over him as he sat\r\nin front of the TV, stepping past, one of these things laying on\r\nthe floor and thinking to myself for a person who has a business to\r\ndo he certainly can waste the time. By business I mean some kind of\r\nactivity and keeping track of right-wing causes and left-wing causes or\r\nsomething. I supposed that he spent his time as I would be inclined to\r\nspend more of my time if I had it, trying to sense the pulse of various\r\ngroups in the Dallas area.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know what Oswald did on Saturday morning, November\r\n9, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you know that he was taken by your wife to apply for\r\na driver's license and take a driver's license test on that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. She told me sometime subsequently that she had taken him\r\nfor--wait. I remember the incident that he had arrived on a Saturday\r\nmorning at the drivers' license bureau, stood in line for a long time\r\nbut they cut off the line at 12 o'clock and he did not stay there long\r\nenough for him to get his driver's license student permit.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was this at this time or would that have been another\r\ntime. Let me help you.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't remember that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would it help to refresh your recollection if I suggested\r\nthat November 9th was a local election day in Dallas, I believe?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think that is an election that I have forgotten.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You have no knowledge of Oswald's activities on that day,\r\nno direct personal knowledge?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. It doesn't, it didn't cue me in, so I don't----\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever see Oswald drive a car?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever discuss with him driving an automobile or\r\nobtaining a driver's license?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I probably said it would be well to get a driver's license.\r\nIt would be well--I probably said, \"You probably need a car to get\r\naround here.\" In other words, effectively; no.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he ever indicate to you that he planned to purchase\r\nan automobile?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I bought this second-hand car for $200.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What kind of a car is that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is a 1956 Oldsmobile.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When did you buy it?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I bought it while they were there, while Marina was staying\r\nwith us, which was sometime in November. Either October or November,\r\nprobably the early part of November. They went out to admire the car.\r\n$200, I suppose, didn't seem out of their reach then.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he indicate to you that he was thinking----\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Therefore, I think Ruth, they went out to admire the car\r\nand, of course, I was thinking that it, this might make it appear to\r\nthem that the car was within reach, and driving was something to be\r\nsought.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In addition to the Oldsmobile that you mentioned, you\r\npersonally own a Citroen automobile and your wife owns a station wagon,\r\nis that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You never saw Oswald drive any of those cars at any time?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct. I had keys to both of my cars so he could\r\nnot have driven them without----\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Without your knowledge?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Or else somehow getting another. He would have to--you can,\r\nI have driven my car when I have broken the key.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. But you never saw him drive it?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I never saw him drive it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did your wife ever tell you that she had seen Oswald\r\ndriving a car or she was trying to teach him how to drive a car?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes; she did.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she indicate what proficiency he had at operating an\r\nautomobile?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. She thought he was, she observed how much one has to learn\r\nin order to drive a car. He had a difficulty in some manner, perhaps\r\nit was in judging when to turn the wheel when parking. And I think she\r\nsaid he over controlled it, turned too far.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Looking back now on all your conversations with Oswald,\r\nafter his return from New Orleans, did you have any discussions with\r\nhim other than the ones you have already mentioned in your previous\r\ntestimony?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask a question before you answer this question.\r\nAbout the car, did you get any idea as to why he didn't want to drive a\r\ncar or to have a car, did he think this would make him a capitalist or\r\nanything of that kind? Did anything come up in the conversations with\r\nregard to his not having a car or not driving a car?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No. I gathered that was slightly embarrassing not to be able\r\nto drive a car.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. All right. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Can you recall any conversations that you had with\r\nOswald that you think would be helpful for us to know other than the\r\nones you have already mentioned?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't recall one now.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he ever indicate to you any specific hostility toward\r\nPresident Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think at this ACLU meeting he mentioned this specifically\r\nthat he thought Kennedy had done a good job in civil rights. That was\r\nit--generally my impression was that he liked--he didn't like anybody,\r\nbut he disliked Kennedy least as you might go right from Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. To the best of your recollection, was that the only time\r\nhe mentioned President Kennedy specifically?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he ever mention Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Not to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he ever indicate any hostility toward the United\r\nStates other than the hostility that you have previously testified to\r\nafter his return from the Soviet Union and his general dislikes of the\r\nAmerican system?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is right. Just his general dislike.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he ever indicate to you a desire to return to the\r\nSoviet Union?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I think when I learned, I don't know when it was that he\r\nhad planned to go back there that it was a surprise to me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When did you learn that he planned to go back there?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That was probably subsequent; yes, that was certainly\r\nsubsequent to November 22.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Or to go to Cuba?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Or to go to Cuba, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When that was spoken----\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I remember now, first it was mentioned could he be connected\r\nwith a Communist plot and there I thought of Russian Communists and\r\nthat didn't seem to ring a bell.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When was that mentioned?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. This was after the assassination, a day or two later. Then\r\nwhen the Fair Play for Cuba Committee was mentioned, that was the first\r\nI had heard of it except for his mentioning Cuba to this man at the\r\nACLU meeting referring to it in the car to me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. He never told you that he had been active in the Fair\r\nPlay for Cuba Committee?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct, that was the only recollection I could\r\nremember his ever having mentioned Cuba.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now yesterday, we asked you about an incident or spoke to\r\nyou about an incident that happened in September of 1963 when you went\r\ninto your garage to use some tools, your garage in Irving, Tex. Would\r\nyou tell us about that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't remember whether the date was September. I remember\r\nthat was the date they came back from New Orleans and I do remember\r\nthat my wife asked me to unpack some of their heavy things from their\r\ncar. I only recall unpacking duffelbags but any other package, that was\r\nthe heaviest thing there and they were easy also.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You must have moved the duffelbags from the station wagon\r\ninto the garage?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is right. I unpacked whatever was remaining in the\r\nstation wagon to the garage.\r\n\r\nSo sometime later, I do remember moving about this package which, let's\r\nsay, was a rifle, anyway it was a package wrapped in a blanket. The\r\ngarage was kind of crowded and I did have my tools in there and I had\r\nto move this package several times in order to make space to work,\r\nand the final time I put it on the floor underneath the saw where the\r\nhandsaw would be casting dust on it and I was a little embarrassed to\r\nbe putting his goods on the floor, but I didn't suppose, the first time\r\nI picked it up I thought it was camping equipment. I said to myself\r\nthey don't make camping equipment of iron pipes any more.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Why did you say that to yourself when you picked up the\r\npackage?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I had, my experience had been, my earliest camping equipment\r\nhad been a tent of iron pipes. This somehow reminded me of that. I felt\r\na pipe with my right hand and it was iron, that is to say it was not\r\naluminum.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. How did you make that distinction?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. By the weight of it, and by the, I suppose the moment of\r\ninertia, you could have an aluminum tube with a total weight massed in\r\nthe center somehow but that would not have had the inertia this way.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You were just feeling this through the blanket though?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I was also aware as I was moving his goods around, of his\r\nrights to privacy. So I did not feel--I had to move this object, I\r\nwasn't thinking very much about it but it happens that I did think a\r\nlittle bit about it or before I get on to the working with my tools I\r\nthought, an image came to mind.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you think there was more than one tent pole in the\r\npackage or just one tent pole?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. As I say, I moved it several times, and I think I thought\r\nprogressively each time. I moved it twice. It had three occasions. And\r\nthe first one was an iron, thought of an iron pipe and then I have\r\ndrawn, I drew yesterday, a picture of the thing I had in mind. Then in\r\norder to fill out the package I had to add another object to it and\r\nthere I added again I was thinking of camping equipment, and I added a\r\nfolding shovel such as I had seen in the Army, a little spade where the\r\nblade folds back over the handle. This has the trouble that this blade\r\nwas too symmetrical I disposed to the handle and to fit the package\r\nthe blade had to be off center, eccentric to the handle. Also, I had\r\nmy vision of the pipe. It had an iron pipe about 30 inches long with\r\na short section of pipe going off 45 degrees. No words here, it just\r\nhappened that I did have this image in my mind of trying to fill up\r\nthat package in the back burner of my mind.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. The witness yesterday did draw a picture of what he\r\nvisualized as being in the blanket, and I will offer it in evidence\r\nlater on in the hearing.\r\n\r\nHow long was this package in your estimation?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Well, yesterday we measured the distance that I indicated\r\nwith my hand, I think it came to 37 inches.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Approximately how thick would you say it was?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I picked it up each time and I put it in a position and then\r\nI would recover it from that position, so each time I moved it with the\r\nsame position with my hands in the same position. My right hand, the\r\nthumb and forefinger could go around the pipe, and my left hand grabbed\r\nsomething which was an inch and a half inside the blanket or something\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did it occur to you at that time that there was a rifle\r\nin the package?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That did not occur to me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You never at any time looked inside the package?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct. I could easily have felt the package but I\r\nwas aware that of respecting his privacy of his possessions.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Were you subsequently advised of the probability or the\r\npossibility that there had been a rifle wrapped in that package?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. When I arrived on Friday afternoon we went into the garage,\r\nI think Ruth, Marina and the policeman, and I am not sure it was the\r\nfirst time, but there we saw this blanket was on the floor below the\r\nbandsaw----\r\n\r\n(At this point Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. And a rifle was mentioned and then it rang a bell, the\r\nrifle answered, fitted the package that I had been trying to fit these\r\nunsuccessfully. It had never resolved itself, this shovel and pipe\r\ndidn't fit in there.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And it seemed to you likely that there had in fact been a\r\nrifle in the package?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That answered it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Can you tell us when the last time was that you saw that\r\npackage in the garage prior to the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I am afraid I can't.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do we have the date of the first time in the record?\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Yes; I think the witness testified it was either late\r\nSeptember or early October of 1963.\r\n\r\nI show you a blanket which has been marked as Commission Exhibit 140\r\nand ask you if that is the blanket you saw in the garage?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. This looks a little cleaner, of course. I was there in the\r\nnight, and I also put the thing on the floor thinking it was rustic\r\nequipment and that sawdust wouldn't hurt it.\r\n\r\nI also was concerned with moisture. This is very close to what I\r\nremember. Yesterday in my testimony I had a desire to add blue to the\r\ncolors of brown and green. Last night I remembered that Thanksgiving\r\nweekend I had bought another rustic blanket of a similar nature which\r\nhad blue in it, which is why I tried to get blue into the blanket.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Are you able to say at this time positively that this was\r\nthe blanket that you saw in your garage and that you moved on various\r\noccasions in October and possibly November of 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I didn't notice the particular design so I can't--it is a\r\nvery good representative of what I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember the texture of the blanket?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. The texture. I felt it, of course, these several times and\r\nthe texture is the same.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was the package wrapped securely when it was in your\r\ngarage?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I had the impression--yes, it was. The whole package was\r\nstiff. There was no shaking of the parts, and I had the impression it\r\nwas wrapped with about two strings.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I now show you Commission Exhibit 139, which is a rifle\r\nthat was found in the Texas School Book Depository Building, and ask\r\nyou if you at any time ever saw this rifle prior to November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Have you seen it since that time and prior to yesterday?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I saw a rifle being shown to Marina in an adjoining cubicle\r\nwith a glass wall between us.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When was that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That was the night of the 22d.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Have you ever seen this leather strap that is attached to\r\nthe rifle.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I have not seen that strap.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Have you ever seen a strap like this strap?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Or anything like it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Have you any idea where this strap could have come from?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask in that connection, was this just loosely wound\r\nup in that blanket or was there some string around it or----\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I had the impression there were about two strings on the\r\nthing. It wouldn't--also, I didn't think you could look into the\r\npackage readily.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You would have to take something off, some string or\r\nsomething in order to get into the package?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I now show you Commission Exhibit 364 which is a replica\r\nof a sack which was prepared by authorities in Dallas, and I also show\r\nyou another sack which is Commission Exhibit 142, and ask you if you\r\nhave ever seen in or around your garage in Irving, Tex., any sacks\r\nsimilar to those?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; I haven't.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Have you seen any paper in your garage in Irving prior to\r\nNovember 22, 1963, or at any other place, at your home in Irving, Tex.,\r\nthat is similar to the paper of which those sacks are made?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No, I haven't; we have some rugs, most of them are wrapped\r\nin polyethylene. I couldn't be sure that one of the smaller ones wasn't\r\nwrapped in paper. To my knowledge, we had no free kraft paper of that\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Will you examine the tape on the sacks and tell me\r\nwhether you have any tape similar to that or whether you have seen any\r\ntape similar to that in your garage before November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. We have some tape in a drawer of my desk at the house, my\r\nrecollection is that the tape is a 2-inch tape, gum tape.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And the tape on the sack appears to be three?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. This is 3-inch.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever observe in your garage any scraps of paper\r\nor scraps of tape similar to the materials used to construct those\r\nsacks?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No, I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Either before November 22, 1963, or afterwards?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When you moved the sacks, the blanket, the package that\r\nwas wrapped in the blanket in your garage, were you able to determine\r\nwhether or not the object inside the sack was also wrapped in paper?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I would have said that it was not. When we practiced\r\nwrapping that rifle yesterday I would have guessed that any paper\r\naround the barrel in there, which I could feel with some clarity, would\r\nhave crinkled.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And to your recollection there was no crinkling in the\r\npackage wrapped with the blanket?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes. It was a very quiet package.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Yesterday we did try to and did wrap the rifle previously\r\nreferred to in our testimony in the blanket which you have just\r\nexamined. Would you tell the Commission about that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I tried wrapping it to the shape and size and bulk that I\r\nremembered the package. I had a little difficulty, it got quite close\r\nto the right shape by wrapping it at an angle. The rifle was laid in\r\nthe blanket somewhat on a bias to the rectangle blanket form. Then\r\nthere was a small end of the barrel, I didn't discover how you could\r\nfold that over to tie it with string without making it bulkier than I\r\nremember. But the package came quite close to what I remembered.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now on the basis of wrapping that rifle in the blanket,\r\nwould you say that it was probable, that the package that was in your\r\ngarage was in fact that rifle wrapped in that blanket?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes, I think it was or a rifle of that size.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You said just a moment ago that you saw the rifle we\r\nhave had here this morning or a similar rifle shown to Marina Oswald\r\nsometime shortly after the assassination. Would you tell us the\r\ncircumstances surrounding that event?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. We went to the police station that evening, and probably\r\nabout 9 o'clock, I saw the rifle being shown to Marina.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. This was at the Dallas police station?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Dallas police station. Ruth was present, and Mamantov was\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Who was the last one?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Ilya Mamantov, I think Ilya is the first name, but Mr.\r\nMamantov. He teaches parttime, parttime teaching in Russian, was\r\nfamiliar to Ruth as the son-in-law of her tutor.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you hear any of the conversation that was going on in\r\nthe room in which Marina was being shown this rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No, no.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know whether or not your wife heard them?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. My wife, of course, was right there. And heard the whole\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she subsequently tell you what occurred?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes, she did.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What did she tell you?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. She told me that Marina wasn't able to identify that rifle\r\nas the one that Lee had. She knew that Lee had a rifle, and I think\r\nshe knew it was wrapped in a package like this. I think Ruth reported\r\nthat she had, Marina had, opened up a corner of the blanket and looked\r\nin and seen part of the butt, and hadn't liked the idea of rifles, the\r\nrifles made her a little uncomfortable and hadn't looked at it further.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. This was at the time the rifle was presumably wrapped in\r\nthe blanket in your garage, correct?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I assumed that. I didn't ask that question.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did your wife tell you anything more about what happened\r\nat that time?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. You will have to jog my memory if you have any specific\r\nquestions. I don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. That is the best of your recollection now that you have\r\ngiven us?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. How much would you say that the package that you saw in\r\nyour garage weighed?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I reported earlier to the FBI 7 or 8 pounds. I never at the\r\ntime thought of the weight of it as I was moving it around.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In your previous discussions or conversations with the\r\nFBI did you ever tell them in word or substance that if there had been\r\na rifle in the package that was located in your garage that you did not\r\nthink it could have a telescopic sight mounted on it?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't recall having said that. I don't believe I would\r\nhave known that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you recall any discussions of that sort with the FBI\r\nat all. Did they ask you about that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes, I think they asked me coming out to find out when and\r\nwhere and how the sight may have been put on but I never felt the\r\npackage in the center. I always grabbed it at these two ends.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. To the best of your recollection you never told the FBI\r\nthat you didn't think the package contained a rifle with a telescopic\r\nsight?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever observe or hear prior to the assassination\r\nthat Lee Oswald had been practicing with a rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No, I didn't know prior to the assassination, we didn't know\r\nhe had a rifle. I had supposed from my conversation with him back on\r\nNeely Street that he would like to have a rifle but I didn't gather\r\nthat he did.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Aside from whether or not you knew that he had a rifle,\r\ndid you ever hear or observe him practicing with a rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No, I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Are you familiar with the Sport's Drome Rifle Range in\r\nGrand Prairie, Tex?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think I know about where it is. No, I don't even know\r\nwhere it is. I know the race track is there.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Have you ever been there?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you know that Oswald received mail at your house from\r\nIrving, Tex?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know what kind of mail he received?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I suppose he used it as the mailing address for most of his\r\nmail until he would receive, get a permanent address, so he received\r\nthe Daily Worker there, or The Worker, and also, I didn't see it come,\r\nI don't generally see the mail that arrives there. Most of my mail\r\nwould arrive at that address even though I was living somewhere else\r\nbecause I also didn't feel permanent in my other addresses, so Ruth\r\nwould collect the mail and separated mine into a separate pile. I\r\ndidn't see the Militant arrive. I did see various Russian magazines,\r\nAgitateur, maybe a very large one. A very large one and the Daily\r\nWorker, The Worker.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever discuss these publications with Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes, we talked with regard to the Daily Worker. He said\r\nthat, he told me, that you could tell what they wanted you to do, they,\r\na word I dislike, what they wanted you to do by reading between the\r\nlines, reading the thing and doing a little reading between the lines.\r\nHe then gave me an issue to look and see. I wanted to see if I could\r\nread between the lines and see what they wanted you to do.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you read the particular issue that he referred to?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I tried to. I don't think I had very much patience to go\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember what particular issue it was?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No, I didn't notice.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Can you set the date of this discussion that you had with\r\nOswald?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That was fairly soon after his coming back. So let's say the\r\nmiddle of October.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he discuss with you, your ability or inability to\r\ndetermine what they wanted you to do by reading between the lines after\r\nyou had read the publication?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No, I just handed it back to him.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was there anything else said between you at that time on\r\nthat subject?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. He asked me how did I like it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What did you say?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. And I tried to be polite. I said it was awful extreme, I\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he respond to that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think that was the end of it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do I understand that this was, this Daily Worker was,\r\nmailed----\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. To 515.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. To your address in Irving?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is right. Or Ruth's address.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It wasn't readdressed but it was directly sent?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. He gave your address for The Worker to come to?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What prompted him to hand you The Worker? Was\r\nthere any preface to the actual handing of it to you?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes. I think I was asking him, I would like to, I wanted to\r\nsee some literature or what he liked to read or something like that. I\r\nthink it was as a response to some question or inquiry of mine.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you know whether this was addressed to him in care of\r\nyou or Ruth Paine or was it just sent at the Paine address?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't remember for certain. I would think it would have\r\njust been Oswald at that address but I don't remember. It may have\r\nbeen. There were enough of those packages but I just don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you draw any inference at the time as a result of\r\nthis conversation with Oswald about his statement that you could tell\r\nwhat they wanted you to do by reading between the lines?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Well, it made me realize that he would like to be active\r\nin some kind of--activist. It made me also feel that he wasn't very\r\nwell connected with a group or he wouldn't have such a tenuous way of\r\ncommunication, and I thought it was rather childish to someone like\r\nDick Tracy, attract a child to Dick Tracy, to think that that was his\r\nbona fide way of being communicated or being a member of this Communist\r\ncause or something.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever have any other discussions with him about\r\nliterature that he received?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I didn't know. Other literature, I was somewhat interested\r\nin what the Russian publications were saying but I didn't take it up\r\nwith him. I wanted Ruth to translate those.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever observe any Cuban literature?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No, I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you ever know that he ever received any such\r\nliterature?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No, I never, until after the assassination, I had never\r\nthought of Cuba either in connection with Oswald or in connection with\r\nthe Communists or the Communist Party.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I show you Commission Exhibit 128 which is ENCO Map of\r\nthe Dallas-Fort Worth area, and ask you if you recognize that map.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. This is the kind of map that I always used, stopping in\r\nstations when I am out of one so I always have one in my car, and when\r\nthe FBI showed me this particular map, which I trust is the same one I\r\nlooked at before. I found on the back side a mark where it shows the\r\nwhole map of the whole area, the Dallas-Fort Worth area, a little mark\r\nwhere our house is, that is the kind of mark that I would make when I\r\nwas trying to buy some land earlier and had in mind for a long time and\r\nI wanted to find the location that was accessible to the places I would\r\nthen want to go.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Can you tell us----\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. This mark is still here.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This is the mark or can you identify that mark\r\nthat you placed on this map?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes, I think I see a mark here of the sort which looks\r\nreasonable to me. I think it is the only mark on this side of the map.\r\n\r\nGenerally, I didn't make marks on the other side of the map.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In your statement referring to one side of the map\r\nyou were referring to the side that shows a map of the entire Fort\r\nWorth-Dallas area, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you say as best you can see there is only one mark on\r\nthis side of the map?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is the only one that is here, that I remember having\r\nfound. I don't remember finding another one.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember putting that mark on the map?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I remember putting--I think I put this kind of mark on more\r\nthan one map. That is our house. It then helps locate it with regard to\r\nall the arteries and what not that lead to various places.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You do think then it is probable that you did place the\r\nmark on the map that indicates the location of your house in Irving,\r\nTex.; is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes, I think that is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know whether or not Oswald ever came into\r\npossession of this map?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. And Ruth gave Oswald a map to--she told me she gave him a\r\nmap, and this is the kind we have around the house, the best one she\r\ncould get in the service station, to help him find a job, or help him\r\nwhen he was searching for a job.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember any other conversations with your wife\r\nabout the map before the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No, I don't believe she told me she had given him the map. I\r\ndon't believe we discussed it at all.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you open the map to the portion that shows the area\r\nof Dallas. I call your attention to a mark at the intersection of Boll\r\nStreet and San Jacinto, and ask you if you have any recollection of\r\nplacing that mark on the map?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No, I don't have any recollection of placing that mark on\r\nthe map.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember any circumstances that might make it\r\nlikely that you placed that mark on the map?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I could have placed that mark on the map when I was looking\r\nfor properties. I went down to the courthouse to get plats of the areas\r\nthat I was thinking of buying, and they had a copy of the plat, and so\r\nthey sent it out late on Saturday, short of 12 o'clock, and just short\r\nof closing, and it was a reproduction company at that address or near\r\nthat address.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Is that the L. L. Ridgway Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes. That is the company that I am referring to. I don't\r\nknow exactly.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. But it is near the intersection we have just referred to?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I will take your word for that.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know that it is?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No, I don't know. I think the FBI man said it was. I hadn't\r\nlooked into it and didn't check it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You haven't any knowledge at this point whether the\r\nRidgway company is in this intersection or not?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I remember it is right beside the expressway and in about\r\nthat area. I don't remember the names of the roads.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you think it is probable or improbable that you placed\r\nthe mark on the map, the one we have just been talking about, at Boll\r\nand San Jacinto Streets?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I remember in asking the clerk where it was, and I had a map\r\nof this sort, that was also in August when I was looking for places. I\r\nwould have guessed I would not. I would have been able to see where it\r\nwas and know in my mind where I wanted to go.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is that the same kind of a mark or a different kind of mark\r\nthat is on the other side of the map to which we have just referred,\r\nthe area map?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. It is a different mark. That mark that is on the other side\r\nof the map to which we have just referred, the area map, was our house.\r\nSo I made a little square that I can see and indicate a house rather\r\nthan--generally I don't make marks on maps. I look up where I want to\r\ngo and I go.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did your wife tell you when she had given this map to\r\nOswald?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I suppose she gave it very soon after he came back and\r\nstarted looking for work.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you said it was August of 1963 when you were looking\r\nto find this reproduction place; is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I call your attention to a mark on Hillcrest and Asbury,\r\nand I ask you if you put that mark on the map?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't recall making that mark. I think it is different\r\nfrom the other mark, and it is--if I were to make a mark that is more\r\nthe way I would make a mark. It also happens to be the cafeteria where\r\nI like to eat, where you can get all you want for a dollar there, and\r\nit is a very good meal. So I would be interested in that, in locating\r\nit. Here is one of the places where I was thinking of buying property.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is there a mark there at that place where you were\r\ninterested in buying property?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't think there is. I almost guessed that I didn't\r\nhave that map at that time. Also I was not living--I would guess for\r\na further reason that I would not have this map on the time of that\r\nAugust date was because I hadn't been living--I had been living in this\r\napartment, and I had a map over there, and I probably didn't have the\r\nsame map that Ruth had around her house.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. So you think it is probably likely you didn't place any\r\nmarks on that map other than the one indicating your home?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct. In other words, I think that mark was\r\nplaced there quite a long time back, because I have been interested in\r\nthis locating of property for several years.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Is the mark at the Hillcrest Avenue spot, a mark of the\r\ntype that you usually make?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. And, as I say, I don't usually make a mark, but I think I\r\nmight more likely have made that kind of mark, more than some of the\r\nothers--somebody else has put marks here with a ball-point pen which\r\nare not the kind I would make.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. In reviewing this map with the FBI, were there any other\r\nmarks on the map that it was developed that you possibly put on the map\r\nother than the ones we have discussed?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't now remember any others. This one of the cafeteria\r\nthere is not exactly at the right spot.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. The mark at Hillcrest Avenue?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. As you look at the map now do you see any other marks\r\nwhich you think you might have put on the map?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No. We went over it at mealtime in considerable detail, he\r\nhaving located most of the marks he could find on the map--no, I guess\r\nit was still marked up like this. We didn't find anything that I can\r\nremember there that I might have put on there.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, on the basis of your knowledge of Oswald and your\r\nmeeting with him, and your familiarity with him prior to the time of\r\nthe assassination, did you form an opinion about him as to whether or\r\nnot he would be likely to commit an act such as this, or whether he\r\nwould be likely to take the life of any human being?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. It was a question we had to consider when we considered\r\nhaving Marina at our house. So Ruth and I discussed that, whether he\r\nwas a dangerous person, and he didn't seem to be dangerous. Of course,\r\nI also felt that I wasn't a particular opponent or foe of his. Helping\r\nhis family we were quite free and would let him, roughly, think of our\r\narguments. I talked about getting angry, but, for the most part, it was\r\na cordial relationship, so I didn't sense--he didn't display hostility\r\nto me or to Ruth, and he was nice with the children, and while they\r\nwere living with us, he was nice to Marina also. He was during this\r\ntime when he returned from Mexico, he was quite a reasonable person. He\r\nwas only unreasonable the first time I had met him.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When did you have this discussion with your wife\r\nconcerning whether or not you should let Marina live with you? Was that\r\nbefore they came back from New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes, it was.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you concluded at that time there was no reason why\r\nMarina should not come there; is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is right. Of course, Ruth went in and sounded them out\r\nrather cautiously and reported to me also his facial expressions and\r\nwhat-not when she was suggesting this, and he seemed to be glad of that\r\nrather than worried.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, after Marina came and lived at your house, Oswald\r\nwas there during parts of the months October and November. Did you\r\nchange your opinion in this respect or was it reinforced, on the basis\r\nof his activities and your observation of him during that period?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. It was reinforced.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You did not think him to be a violent person or one who\r\nwould be likely to commit an act such as assassinating the President?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I didn't--I saw he was a bitter person, he was bitter and\r\nquite a lot of very negative views of people in the world around him,\r\nvery little charity in his view toward anybody, but I thought he was\r\nharmless.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Was this a different reaction from the one you had\r\nhad at your first meeting or your first acquaintance?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. When we first became acquainted I was somewhat shocked,\r\nespecially that he would speak so harshly to his wife in front of a\r\ncomplete stranger, and it was at that point, or at that time, that\r\nI was persuaded I would like to free Marina from her bondage and\r\nservitude to this man. He seemed to me he was keeping her, not helping\r\nher to learn the language, keeping her vassal to him, and this offended\r\nme, so at that point I became interested in helping her escape from\r\nhim. Of course, I was not going to try to force that. I didn't want to\r\nbe separating a family that could get along.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. This bitterness that you detected following his return\r\nfrom Mexico, was that a new reaction?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No. That bitterness had existed all along. He also had been\r\ndisagreeable to his wife, cruel to her.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Not allowing her any personality, a mind of her own, and\r\nmaking sharp jibes at her.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And that continued awhile?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That only existed that first night in March or April.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It did not continue when Marina was at your house in Irving?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. When Marina came to our house she gained in health and\r\nweight. She started to look better and it looked to me as if the strain\r\nwas off the family relationship. They were not quarreling. They billed\r\nand cooed. She sat on his lap and he said sweet nothings in her ear.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you get any information from any source with regard to\r\nthe situation while they were living in New Orleans that she wanted to\r\nget away from him?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Oh, yes; well, Ruth had told me when she came back from\r\ndelivering Marina to New Orleans, she had gone down there expecting\r\nto spend a week, seeing New Orleans, and it was a pretty long trip,\r\nand found the household, she reported to me, so uncomfortable living\r\nthere. They were fighting, I mean, so difficult. She wanted to leave\r\nright away, and she left in a few days, left a lot sooner than she had\r\nexpected to leave.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Then your wife took her back, as you recall?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Then, my wife came home, and then she went back to Naushon,\r\nMass., for a couple of months in the summer, and on her way back to\r\nTexas stopped in New Orleans, found him out of work, and invited Marina\r\nto come back with her right then.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What did she learn at that time about Oswald? What did she\r\nlearn about Lee Oswald's treatment of Marina, anything new or different\r\nat the time she stopped by New Orleans, and then went back?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. She, perhaps, saw he loved her because she said that the\r\nparting, he genuinely seemed so happy to have Ruth take her back. In\r\nother words, he seemed to be exhibiting some concern for Marina, who\r\nwas with child, and the child would be adequately taken care of, and\r\nsorry--it was a cheerful parting or something. She saw human qualities\r\nin him at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did she say after Marina returned to your home in Irving,\r\nand after Oswald came back to Dallas that their relationship improved\r\neven more, and Oswald seemed to be under less strain than he had been\r\nprior to that time; is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Well, I don't--I only know two times, at the time in April\r\nwhen they came to dinner with us, and he was rough, crude, uncivil to\r\nher, and Ruth's report of how they were while she was trying to live in\r\nthis house in New Orleans, when she just moved in.\r\n\r\nShe also reported to me, and she will tell you this though that\r\napparently Lee had wanted to make her happy in this house, had liked\r\nthe house, said it was in the old famous quarter of New Orleans,\r\nand Ruth could see that Marina was unhappy. She thought it was\r\nuncomfortable in this darkness, and Ruth thought it was a tragedy. Both\r\npoints of view were valid depending on which way you looked at it, so\r\nshe saw that Lee apparently had wanted to make her happy, wanted her to\r\nlike the house when she arrived in New Orleans, and had called her out\r\nthere. She had also been eager to go out.\r\n\r\nApparently Ruth reported to me when he called from New Orleans, saying\r\nhe had a job and \"come live with me, come back with me,\" Marina had\r\nbeen very happy.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you specifically consider the question before you let\r\nMarina move into your home as to whether Oswald was a violent person?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes, specifically. I talked it over with Frank. Frank raised\r\nthe question also. So I talked it over with Ruth several times, and\r\nFrank brought up the question, and I thought of it myself.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you concluded on the basis of these discussions and\r\nyour knowledge of Oswald, your collective knowledge of Oswald, at that\r\ntime that he was not a violent person; is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That he wasn't going to stab Ruth or Marina.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. That he wasn't going to exhibit any violence to any of\r\nyou people?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is right. He wouldn't be a danger to Ruth. That was\r\npartly based, first, on the fact that we were not--we were careful to\r\navoid putting him in a position that he felt offended.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You didn't consider at the time that you were considering\r\nOswald's possible violence toward you and your group whether he might\r\nexhibit violence to some other person?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You formed no judgment about that one way or the other?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct. We assumed or felt that--if we handled him\r\nwith a gentle or considerate manner that he wouldn't be a danger to us.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In the light of subsequent information and developments,\r\nand the information which is publicly available, have you reached any\r\nother conclusions as to or any conclusions as to whether or not Lee\r\nOswald was the assassin of the President?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. When the police first asked me did I think he had done it,\r\nmy dubiousness in my mind arose from not seeing how this could fit, how\r\nthis could help his cause, and I didn't think he was irrational. It\r\ndid not seem to me that he could shoot a man as he would shoot a tin\r\ncan. Difficulty of a person shooting another person was not the reason\r\nfor my doubting, and the circumstantial evidence seemed quite powerful\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Seemed quite powerful?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes. But then I realized with subsequent people calling from\r\nall over the country, somebody had said it is only a single-shot rifle,\r\nand I recognize one little fact like that could alter my thinking\r\nentirely. Somebody else said there was a shot through the windshield of\r\nthe car. We went down to the place and looked around, and he thought\r\nthat--he had a theory that the man had been shot from a manhole in the\r\nstreet, so I recognized that my views could change with evidence.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you have a view on Oswald's guilt at this time?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Most of these other things have proved to be false. It\r\nseems to be a clip-fed rifle. The man who thought it was shot from\r\nthe place, I went down and saw the diagram drawn by Life seemed to be\r\nquite accurate so far as I could reconstruct the thing, and there was\r\nconfusion about the number of bullets. I never did discover--it didn't\r\nquite make sense, but for the most part, I accept it, the common view\r\nthat he did it.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Where were you on the morning of November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I was having, at the time of the assassination I was at\r\nwork, of course, but at the time of the assassination I was in the\r\ncafeteria associated with the bowling alley having lunch.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Who was with you?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. A student, a co-op student called Dave Noel happened to be\r\nwith me. We happened to be talking about the character of assassins at\r\nthat lunchtime, of all things.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Prior to the time you heard of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is right. When we first sat down at the meal we\r\nwere discussing it, beside the point, except unless you believe in\r\nextrasensory perception, but we happened to just--we didn't have enough\r\nhistorical knowledge to explore it, but I just raised the question\r\nand tried to pursue it, and then dropped it, and then a waitress came\r\nand said the President had been shot, and I thought she was cracking\r\na nasty joke, and went over to a cluster of people listening around a\r\ntransistor set, and heard there was some commotion of this sort from\r\nthe tone of the voice of the transistor set, and we went back to the\r\nlab where there is a good radio, and followed the news from there.\r\n\r\nWhen it was mentioned, the Texas School Book Depository Building was\r\nmentioned, then I told Frank Krystinik that that was where Lee Oswald\r\nworked, and then in a few minutes he came back and said, he asked me,\r\ndidn't I think I had better call the FBI and tell them.\r\n\r\nSo over a period of about 20 minutes, I trying to carry on work in a\r\nfoolish way, or talking or discussing other things or something, we\r\nwere discussing this problem, and I thought, I said to myself, or said\r\nto him, that the FBI already knew he worked there. Everybody would know\r\nhe was a black sheep, and I didn't want to--a friend or one of the few\r\nfriends in position of friendship to him, I didn't want to--join the\r\nmob barking at his heels or join in his harassment, so I declined. I\r\ndidn't tell Frank that he couldn't call the FBI, but I said I wasn't\r\ngoing to do it, so I didn't.\r\n\r\nI called Ruth immediately after getting back just to see that she\r\nwould turn on the radio and be clued in with the news, but this was\r\nbefore the Texas School Book Depository Building was mentioned, to my\r\nknowledge, and she was already watching the news. So we communicated\r\nnothing at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you know whether your luncheon companion did or did not\r\ntelephone the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. This is not the luncheon companion. This is Dave Noel. Frank\r\nKrystinik brings his lunch, and he eats his lunch at the lab.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. At the lab?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Mr. Paine, would you give us the nature of the\r\nconversation you were having concerning assassination prior to the\r\nassassination. First let me ask you was anybody else present beside\r\nyou and your companion at the time of the conversation?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No, just he and I.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Tell us the general essence of the conversation as best\r\nyou can recall.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. There had been talk, of course, people, I don't get a\r\nnewspaper, but I do listen to the radio. I know what my news source is,\r\nit is mostly magazines. So there was some anxiety about the President\r\ncoming to Dallas-Fort Worth, and it appeared that this thought was in\r\nthe minds of several others, I was not singular in this way. It had\r\nbeen expected, of course, that trouble would come from the right-wing,\r\nand I was wondering whether there was any danger, I suppose, that\r\nis somebody who could be drummed up by local feeling. The number of\r\nanti-Kennedy jokes cracked was quite large in Texas, and so I was\r\nwondering, you know, what kind of a person would kill a President, and\r\nI don't think Dave Noel knew anything about it, so it was just musing\r\nor conjecturing on my part. I certainly didn't think of Lee Oswald. I\r\ndidn't expect it from that cause, from that end of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. When did you first think of Lee Oswald in connection with\r\nthe assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. As soon as I heard the Texas School Book Depository Building\r\nmentioned. Now, I did not know that--it never occurred to me, I didn't\r\nrealize, there was a building there on his route. I had seen this\r\nwarehouse building from the expressway, you can see the name written in\r\nlarge letters, but that is the way from any main thoroughfare. So I had\r\nsupposed, I never put--except when it was mentioned that that was the\r\nbuilding he shot from or was the building that the shot was fired from,\r\nthen I realized I did know where he worked.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You had not been at Irving that previous night?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No, I had not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You knew Oswald worked at the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes, I did.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. As soon as you heard that that building was involved in\r\nthe assassination, you thought of Oswald, did you not?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What did you think?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Wondering whether Oswald would do it. And the argument\r\nagainst it, the only argument against it, was just I didn't think he\r\nwas irrational, or it seemed to me to be irrational.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And you asked yourself the question of whether or not\r\nOswald would do it solely on the basis of your knowledge that he worked\r\nin that building, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes. Well, I didn't realize he worked in that building, but\r\nthen I realized I didn't know--I knew he worked at that organization. I\r\ndidn't realize there was a building on Elm Street there.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you talk to your wife after you heard that the\r\nTexas School Book Depository Building was involved in the shooting,\r\nand before you subsequently heard that Oswald had been arrested in\r\nconnection with the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't believe so. I think I called her only once to see\r\nthat she was listening to the news, and then I assumed she would know\r\nall that I knew, and as soon as she heard that I supposed she would\r\nbe wondering the same thing. It wasn't many minutes later though, it\r\nseemed to me, that the name Lee Oswald was mentioned--in the theater.\r\nThe newsmen didn't connect it up at all, but that is all I needed to\r\nsend me home.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. So then you left for your home in Irving?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You left for home before there had been any public\r\nconnection made between Oswald and the assassination, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Well, of course, the police were reporting they had suspects\r\nhere and suspects there, were chasing suspects over here, and here was\r\na man who had shot Officer Tippit. They didn't even mention him as a\r\nsuspect, but there was another murder coincident in time.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. So the news broadcast connected Oswald with Officer\r\nTippit?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you then consider again whether or not Oswald had\r\nbeen involved in the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Well, that was too much to have his name mentioned away from\r\nhis place of work as having killed somebody; the stew was too thick to\r\nstay at work, and I was shaken too much, anyway.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. So your testimony is that you first thought of Oswald\r\nafter you heard of the Texas School Book Depository Building being\r\ninvolved in the assassination, but you concluded at that time that\r\nOswald was probably not involved in the assassination; is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Is there any other reason other than the fact Oswald\r\nwas at that building that made you think of him when you heard that\r\nbuilding mentioned in connection with the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Well, yes; Oswald, of course, stands--he is a black sheep\r\nin society; I mean he is, if you were to pick out the singular person\r\namong the employees there, he is the one, or he is probably the one.\r\nI don't happen to know the people who worked there. I gather from him\r\nthere were about 30 people working there in a fairly large building.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What was your state of mind when you heard that the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository Building was involved in the shooting, did you\r\ndeeply suspect Oswald had been involved, or was it just a passing\r\nthought? Tell us some more about that if you can, recreate your state\r\nof mind.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think I was nervous. I know I was trying to assemble\r\na vibration meter and could not put in the screws or I kept making\r\nmistakes. I was preoccupied. Of course, the darn fools, we should have\r\nall stopped to mourn the President, but it is kind of a habit, I wasn't\r\naccustomed, habit drove us on, very unhappy or unresolved emotional\r\ntime. I thought, firstly, Frank was quite insistent, he didn't just ask\r\nme once, but several times, whether I didn't think I should call the\r\nFBI.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did he tell you why he thought you should call the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Well, he would have, but he is of that nature. At one time\r\nhe had seen someone taking pictures of Hensley Field, which has signs\r\non the outside \"No Photographs Allowed,\" and I said I believe more in\r\nfreedom. It seems to me if the field doesn't want the pictures taken,\r\nthey had better put up a big fence. But he had gone ahead and called\r\nup the base commander, and the base commander knew the man. That was\r\nhis normal mode of behavior, whereas my normal defense is of the\r\nindividual, and I didn't think--I would not like to, if Lee is falsely\r\naccused, I wouldn't want to be jumping on him with the mob. If he is\r\nproperly, if he is guilty, he will be found. They know he works there,\r\nhe is connected to us. I couldn't contribute to his capture, so that my\r\nwithholding information wouldn't harm the search for the right man, and\r\nhaving jumped on him unfairly I might be ashamed of that later on. So\r\nthat was my feeling in regard to whether I should call the FBI. I think\r\nI just kind of felt cold sweats or something like that in regard to\r\nthe question could he have done that thing. I don't think I went much\r\nbeyond that, could he, could he.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did Krystinik indicate to you any reason for his desire\r\nto call the FBI? Did he suspect Oswald had done this on the basis of\r\nhis knowledge of Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. It seemed to me very reasonable that he should think so. Of\r\ncourse, I don't think the others were so sharply aware, the others in\r\nthe lab were so sharply aware that we were wrestling with this problem.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. He didn't say anything to you, he didn't tell you any\r\nother reason?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No, he didn't; but his reaction seemed perfectly reasonable\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I felt the same one--if you were to pick out somebody in\r\nthat building, it was a rather singular coincidence we knew this man\r\nwho was so negative to our society and not an ingratiating person, not\r\na person with compassion or something.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What time did you arrive at your home in Irving?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I would guess about 3 or 3:30, somewhere in that\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Who was there when you arrived?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. The police, the Dallas police mostly were there.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Your wife was there?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. My wife and Marina.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember what you said when you arrived?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't know. No, I don't remember what I said.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you say in words or substance, \"I came right home\r\nas soon as I heard the shots were fired from the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building?\"\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No, I came right home as soon as I heard Lee Oswald\r\nmentioned. I did not come home.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember saying that you came right home as soon\r\nas you heard that Oswald was involved?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes, I think I said something like that. Ruth asked me.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, you mentioned before that after you arrived home you\r\nwent into the garage when the police officers went into your garage.\r\nWas there any indication to you at that time that the garage had been\r\npreviously searched by the police or anyone else?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. This I don't remember very well. But, as I remember, this\r\nwas not the first time we had gone in there. I think, perhaps, they\r\nwent into--I don't remember, but I don't think it was the first time\r\nthey had gone in.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You said when you did go into the garage, however, the\r\nblanket was there in the garage?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think it was. It was still there.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Tell us, to the best of your recollection, what was said\r\nin respect of the blanket and search of the garage, as you say. Before\r\nyou answer that question, let me ask you, did your wife go with you\r\ninto the garage with the police officers?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think they were further in in the garage. I think I\r\nstayed--the band saw is fairly close to--there is an overhead door to\r\nthe garage, and close to the under edge of that when it is pulled up.\r\nIn other words, it is fairly close to the outside in the garage, and I\r\nthink I stayed somewhat near the door entering the garage, which is the\r\ninside end of the garage.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. And your wife was with the police officers further in?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes, I think she was.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Was Marina Oswald there?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Failure of recollection, I would say, yes. But it is a very\r\nfuzzy recollection.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Can you tell us where the blanket was found?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. It doesn't really make sense as to why they would still\r\nleave the blanket there, and these things would have been discussed\r\nat that time, but I kind of remember a kind of silhouette situation,\r\na police officer either lifted up or kicked this blanket, which was\r\nin exactly the same location that the rifle, the package had been,\r\nunderneath the saw and somewhat in the sawdust. And I think he put it\r\nback there. He may have asked me at that time, \"Did you know what was\r\nin this?\"\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. And that is why I think they asked me, it may have been as\r\nearly as that, whether it was a rifle, \"Do you think it could have been\r\na rifle?\" I don't remember how it was posed, but I probably answered\r\nwhen it was suggested, it was a rifle, and there they suggested it was\r\na rifle, because they had already learned from Marina that he had had\r\na rifle, and it had been, perhaps, had learned it had been in that\r\nblanket.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you know they had previously asked Marina about that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; but I think--I'm just telling you my impressions here,\r\nvery fuzzy impressions.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Go ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. My impression was that they asked me if I knew what was in\r\nthis blanket, or he asked me, and then he asked me if it could be a\r\nrifle, and I probably responded, yes. It didn't take long once the\r\nrifle was suggested as the object to fit this puzzle together, this\r\npuzzle of the pieces that I had been trying to assemble in the package.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. What else happened?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. We went out of the garage, I don't think he took the blanket\r\nthen even.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. This is the Dallas police officer?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes, plainclothesman, wearing black hats; one of them had\r\none of those Texas hats. He collected all the useless stuff in our\r\nhouse, he went around and collected all the files of Ruth, and a\r\ndrawer of cameras, mostly belonging to me. I tried to tell him one of\r\nthe files contained our music or something like that, and the more I\r\nsuggested it, that he not bother taking those, the more insistent he\r\nwas in taking those objects.\r\n\r\nSo with the various boxes and piles of stuff, mostly of our stuff,\r\nwe got in the car and went off, and he was quite irked that we had\r\nwasted quite enough time around there, he said, and Ruth was irked, and\r\neverybody was irked by it. He wouldn't let us be helpful, and thought\r\nwe were--he became angry when we tried to be helpful or something that\r\nwe would suggest that he should do.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did they tell you how they happened to come to your house?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No. I don't remember. I think I may have asked it, \"You\r\nfound us pretty quickly,\" or somebody said this, but I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Do you remember any other conversations about this\r\nblanket?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did anyone notice any scraps of paper or tape similar\r\nto the ones of which these sacks were constructed that we previously\r\nidentified, particularly Commission 142?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Not that I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Is there anything else that happened during this period\r\nprior to the time the police left that you think would be significant\r\nor that we ought to know about?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No; very little happened. We just bundled up and went.\r\nMarina was--whimpered a little bit, but mostly it was dry.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You went with the police?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. We went with the police in several cars and didn't come back\r\nuntil quite a lot later that night, didn't go into the garage again;\r\ndidn't want the Life reporters to take photographs, so I don't think\r\nthey went in the garage to take photographs. Several--their possessions\r\nwere searched by various waves of succeeding policemen, Dallas, and\r\nIrving and FBI, and what not.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Now, there has been a report that on November 23, 1963,\r\nthere was a telephone call between a man and a woman, between the\r\nnumbers of your residence and the number of your office, in which the\r\nman was reported to have said in words or substance, \"We both know who\r\nis responsible for the assassination.\" Have you been asked about this\r\nbefore?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I had heard that--I didn't know it was associated with our\r\nnumbers. I had heard a report that some telephone operator had listened\r\nin on a conversation somewhere, I don't know where it was. I thought it\r\nwas some other part of the country.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you talk to your wife on the telephone at any time\r\nduring Saturday, November 23, on the telephone?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I was in the police station again, and I think I called her\r\nfrom there.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you make any remark to the effect that you knew who\r\nwas responsible?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. And I don't know who the assassin is or was; no, so I did\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. You are positive in your recollection that you made no\r\nsuch remark?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Would you tell us your impression and your opinion of\r\nthe relationship that had developed between Marina Oswald and your\r\nwife during the period that they knew each other up to the time of\r\nthe assassination and subsequent to the assassination when, as we\r\ndiscussed briefly yesterday, there came to be a cooling off between\r\nthem or a disenchantment.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Ruth was mostly learning the language, so she was limited\r\nin her vocabulary and couldn't talk about--she explained to me she\r\ncouldn't talk about--political or economic subjects. It was a topic on\r\nwhich her vocabulary didn't serve her, but it did appear she had spoken\r\nof quite a number of things. Marina had told her about movies she had\r\nseen in the Soviet Union, but I thought that the knowledge, Ruth's\r\nknowledge, I suppose Ruth's knowledge of Marina was fairly shallow. And\r\nMarina was quite reserved. Now, it may have been more so when I was in\r\nthe house that she was not as much at ease as she was, perhaps, with\r\nRuth herself.\r\n\r\nOf course, Marina was in a position where she always had to be polite.\r\nRuth is easy to get along with, however, so I didn't expect Marina to\r\nhave difficulty. But I didn't think Ruth and Marina were bosom friends\r\nor buddies, but neither, of course, I didn't mean to suggest the\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\nRuth was enjoying Marina's company and I was glad to have Marina\r\nstaying with Ruth. It actually reduced the cost. Ruth saved money.\r\nThe bills were less while Marina was there, and Ruth, in general, was\r\nhappier.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you learn----\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I didn't think Ruth knew Marina very well, but I don't know\r\nhow well she knew her.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Did you learn subsequently or are you aware that\r\nsubsequent to the assassination there has been a disenchantment or some\r\nstrain between Marina and Ruth?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Several things happened. Ruth was put out when she learned\r\nMarina knew afterward that Oswald had taken a shot at Walker, if that\r\nwere true. She thought that was quite morally remiss on Marina's part,\r\nand so we talked about that thing.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. When did she learn that?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. This was in the newspaper report.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. She only learned it through the newspaper?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. That is correct. So we discussed the mitigating\r\ncircumstances of Marina not knowing the language and not knowing who\r\nshe could go to if she wanted to stay in this country and, perhaps--we\r\nbelieve there were extenuating circumstances which would, perhaps,\r\nexcuse Marina. Ruth was troubled about that, and so she wrote a series\r\nof quite a number of letters, each one referring to previous letters,\r\ntrying to discover whether they were being withheld, thinking Marina\r\nwas a responsible person or normally civil person, she would normally\r\nrespond to or at least acknowledge receipt of them.\r\n\r\nSo Ruth didn't know whether she was receiving them or not, and had\r\nanother--some encounters with Martin and Thorne which didn't put her at\r\nease. She still didn't know whether Marina was receiving them. She saw\r\nonly some of the checks had been signed by Thorne rather than Marina.\r\nThorne had said that Marina didn't say he had power of attorney, and\r\nMarina was trying to do everything that she could which, at least, she\r\ncould sign her checks, checks or gifts.\r\n\r\nSo there were these indications. Ruth was very much in the dark, not\r\nknowing why she had received no communication from Marina, and having\r\nconflicting reports from Martin. Martin said she had a phone right\r\nbeside her if she wanted to call.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. How did she receive these checks?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I guess Ruth--some of the checks came to Ruth as gifts to\r\nher, and Ruth would write her own check so she got her own stub back.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Therefore, Ruth had this question of whether she had\r\noffended Marina or whether Marina had done something that offended Ruth\r\nor whether Marina didn't like Ruth and had never let on. This would be\r\na great blow to her ego. It had Ruth in great periods of depression and\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did either you or your wife, to your knowledge, know Robert\r\nOswald?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. We only met him for the first time on the night of the\r\nassassination. We both liked him at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. Mr. Paine, is there any other subject that we haven't\r\ncovered in the testimony that you think the Commission ought to know\r\nabout in connection with this assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I don't believe there is anything else that I know.\r\n\r\nMr. LIEBELER. I have no more questions.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Do you have any questions, Mr. Dulles?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. The only question I have in mind is as to what took place\r\nas far as Mr. Paine is concerned on the night of the assassination.\r\nWere you in the police station?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. We went down to the police and stayed there until about 8 or\r\n9 o'clock. Then Marguerite came home with us and spent the night.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You didn't see Lee Harvey at that time, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. They asked me and I declined to see him at that time. I\r\nchanged my mind. When they immediately asked me, I declined. I did not\r\nknow what he would ask me, so I did not see him.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You did not see him?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did your wife see him?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think no one saw him. Marina went in the next morning\r\nhoping to see him.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. There were no conversations that took place that evening\r\nthat are pertinent to our investigation so far as you know?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Quite soon I called the ACLU. There were reports, yes, I\r\nthink at that time, that Friday night, Marguerite was saying he wasn't\r\nreceiving counsel, and so I called the ACLU to see if there was anybody\r\nthere checking to see if this was true, and apparently a delegation,\r\nthis was Saturday morning, and apparently a delegation had been sent.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But to your knowledge neither you nor your wife had any\r\nconversations with Marina or Robert that would throw any light on this\r\napparent coolness?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Ruth apparently saw Marina this last weekend. We have some\r\nindications that people had gone between, chiefly Levine.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You think money considerations had anything to do with this?\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. I think quite a lot--it will be borne out, between Ruth and\r\nMarina subsequently, I think they will find the difficulties. I think\r\nThorne----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What I have in mind is as to whether some of these other\r\npeople thought that you and Ruth might intervene in as business manager\r\nor something of that kind between them, and the monetary considerations\r\nthat were coming in to Marina.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. We didn't know why. We have the feeling that Thorne was\r\nadvising her not to speak to Ruth. Ruth is not interested in the\r\nmoney, but is interested in protecting her from the wolves, and so she\r\nthought, we both thought, there were some false stories being told to\r\nMarina in regard to Ruth.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is all.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Paine.\r\n\r\nMr. PAINE. Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. We will examine Mrs. Paine this afternoon at 2 o'clock.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 1:05 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfternoon Session\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF RUTH HYDE PAINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission reconvened at 2:20 p.m.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Before I ask you to be sworn, Mrs. Paine. I will give you a\r\nlittle general indication of what our testimony is apt to cover.\r\n\r\nWe have heard that you and your husband made the acquaintance of the\r\nOswalds somewhere during 1963, and that Mrs. Marina Oswald lived in\r\nyour home from late September 1963, I believe, to the time of the\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\nSince we are inquiring under our mandate into the background and the\r\npossible motives of the assassination by Lee Harvey Oswald, the alleged\r\nassassin, we will question you regarding your association with Mr.\r\nOswald and try to glean from you any other facts that may bear upon the\r\nassassination or its motivation.\r\n\r\nI believe you have been furnished with a copy of the executive order\r\nunder which we are operating as well as the Congressional resolution?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Now if you will please stand, I will swear you.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I would like to affirm.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Do you solemnly affirm that the evidence you will give in\r\nthis investigation will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but\r\nthe truth?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Will you state your full name for the record and your\r\naddress?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am Ruth Hyde Paine. I live at 2515 West Fifth Street, in\r\nIrving, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Mr. Jenner is going to conduct the examination.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Your maiden name?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Is Hyde.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Ruth Avery Hyde.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are wife of Michael Ralph Paine?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you were born September 3, 1932?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are almost 34 years old.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Almost 32. I will be 32 in September.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Pretty bad arithmetic. Just a little bit of your\r\nbackground, Mrs. Paine, very little. Your mother and father are living?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And your mother is an Unitarian Minister ordained in the\r\nUnitarian Church at the moment?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; she is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And received her degree in theology last summer I believe,\r\nis that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No, she has completed her work for a Bachelor of Divinity\r\nDegree from Oberlin College and she will receive it in the spring. They\r\ndon't give them in mid-year. She completed just the first of February.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You yourself are a college graduate?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Antioch College?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yellow Springs.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yellow Springs, Ohio?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have a brother and sister.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And your mother, your father, yourself, your brother, and\r\nyour sister are your entire family.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. My immediate family.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Your brother is a graduate of Antioch also, he and your\r\nsister. Are they older than you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes, they are.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which is the elder of the two?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. My brother is the oldest.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And your brother is a professional man, is he?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He is a doctor, general practitioner.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. A general physician, and he practices in Yellow Springs,\r\nOhio?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you tell us where Yellow Springs is?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is about 60 miles south and west from Columbus, Ohio,\r\nthe capital, which is more or less in the middle of the State, and\r\njust a little bit east of Dayton.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is your brother married.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes, he is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Does he have a family?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He has four children.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And is your sister married?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; she is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Does she have a family?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She has four children.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And each of your brothers and your sister, it is their\r\nfirst marriage?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now you were married to Mr. Paine December 28, 1957, is\r\nthat correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; I believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you were married where, in Philadelphia?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was suburban Philadelphia. Friends meeting in Media, Pa.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you tell us what the Friends meeting is which you\r\nhave mentioned?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am a member of the Society of Friends often known as\r\nQuakers.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are a Quaker?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When did you embrace that faith?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I joined in early 1951, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Has any other member of your family embraced the Quaker\r\nfaith?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; my brother is also a Quaker.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When did he embrace that faith.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Similar in time, a year or two one way or the other. I\r\ndon't recall exactly.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am afraid I might have been inattentive. When did you say\r\nthat occurred?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Similar in time. I don't remember just when exactly he\r\njoined.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I was thinking more as to when you said you did.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. In early '51, I think; I am quite certain it was winter of\r\n'51.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You were then in college?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That was the year out. I went to Antioch one year and then\r\nI took a year out and I joined my home meeting in Columbus which I had\r\nalready attended perhaps 2 years.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And from the time you joined the Quaker church you have\r\nbeen a member of that church?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Or that faith?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Or church; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Ever since?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now you and Mr. Paine, did you take up a residence in\r\nPhiladelphia as soon as you married?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I had been living in Philadelphia working there, and then\r\nwhen we married I moved to suburban Philadelphia where Michael was\r\nliving, Paoli, Pa.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. His folks live in Paoli, also, do they not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. His mother and stepfather.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you remained in Paoli until when?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, it was summer of '59 we were in the process of\r\nmoving, didn't complete it until fall of '59.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. You moved to where?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. To Irving, where we are now, to the present address.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. To your present home? And that was in the summer of 1959?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. At some later stage we will go into what occurred. In the\r\nmeantime we have you now in Irving, Tex. Is that a suburb of Dallas?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You and your husband purchased the home you have there\r\nbefore you went down.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Oh, no; we stayed at a small apartment for several weeks\r\nlooking around and then rented for a year, and then we purchased the\r\nhouse we have been renting.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So you purchased that and moved in in 1960, is that about\r\nright?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. We first moved into it in the fall of '59.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You rented it and then purchased it.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The same house; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right, thank you. You have two children?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. A boy and a girl?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. A girl and a boy.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you name the oldest of the two.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Sylvia Lynn and the boy--she is now 4. The boy is\r\nChristopher and he is 3.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The point I was getting at, your daughter, Sylvia, was born\r\nafter you reached Texas?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And what was her birth?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She was born on November 17, '59.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. 1959. Now you are acquainted, became acquainted with Marina\r\nOswald, did you not, in due course in Irving, Tex.?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No. I first met her and her husband at a gathering of\r\npeople in Dallas at the home of Everett Glover.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I will get to that in a moment.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Okay. I had not met her before that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. At this time you and your husband were living in your\r\npresent home in Irving, Tex.?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. In '59.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. At the time that you met Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No. Michael moved to an apartment in September of 1962.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. There had been some strained relations or difficulties\r\nbetween yourself and your husband Michael. When we shake our heads we\r\ndon't get it on the record.\r\n\r\nThe answer to that is \"Yes\"?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Is \"No.\" I had not met her when there had been some\r\nstrained relations between me and my husband. It is just we are having\r\ndifficulties with words.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What I was getting at--there had been some strained\r\nrelations, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And Mr. Paine had moved to separate quarters. This was in\r\nSeptember of 1962, correct.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You met Marina for the first time when.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I judge it was the last of February, towards the end of\r\nFebruary of 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You were then living with your children in your home at\r\n2515.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. West Fifth.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. West Fifth Street in Irving, Tex. Now would you please\r\nrelate the circumstances under which the meeting between yourself and\r\nMarina Oswald first occurred in February of 1963.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I was invited to come to the home of Everett Glover to\r\nmeet a few friends of his, and I judge that was on the 22d of February\r\nlooking back at my calendar.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you please tell us who Mr. Everett Glover was and how\r\nyou became acquainted with him.\r\n\r\nWhat was the milieu?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I met Mr. Glover at a group gathered to sing madrigals\r\ntogether. These are old English songs where each part has a melody and\r\nit was for the enjoyment of reading the music and in harmony, and we\r\noften had coffee afterward and would talk.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This included your husband, however, did it not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes indeed.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You had a common interest in this?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Madrigal singing?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Madrigal singing?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. And went together.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Proceed.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And then Everett knew that I was interested in learning\r\nRussian well enough to teach it, and since this gathering was to\r\ninclude some people who spoke Russian, he invited me and he invited\r\nMichael also to attend. Michael caught a bad cold and wasn't able to go.\r\n\r\nI went.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me, could I interrupt you a moment here. Though your\r\nhusband was living in his own quarters, the relations between you,\r\nhowever, were not so disruptive but what you were friendly, and you\r\nwere attending these singing groups?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right. I saw him perhaps once or twice a week for\r\ndinner at my house, and we went out to rather more movies than some of\r\nmy married friends.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. There was reasonable cordiality?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes. I don't wish to pry into your private life.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. If it is pertinent, go ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mrs. Paine, there is some necessity. We might touch a\r\nlittle on your private life if you will forgive me for doing it. Mr.\r\nGlover, is he a single person?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He was at the time of the party. He has been divorced from\r\nhis wife. He is now remarried.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now I interrupted you at the point at which you were\r\nrelating that Mr. Glover had raised with you, I assume this was a\r\ntelephone call, that he was going to have some guests. He knew of your\r\ninterest in the study and the learning of the Russian language and its\r\nuse?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do I correctly summarize it up to the moment?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have an entry in your calendar as I recall on this\r\nsubject. There is a question mark.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I recall it says \"Everett?\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. May I hand the witness the document?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. You may.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This will be Commission Exhibit No. 401. Gentlemen for the\r\npurpose of identification of the exhibit, it is Mrs. Paine's calendar\r\nwhich she used in part as a diary and part to record prospective\r\nappointments and she surrendered it to the FBI. This is not merely a\r\nphotostat, it is a picture taken with a camera of that calendar.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 401 was marked for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. May I ask you a question or two about it Mrs. Paine. Did\r\nyou not go through each of the pages of that calendar with me this\r\nmorning?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes, I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And I asked you, did I not, whether it was all in your\r\nhandwriting?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. You did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Except for the identification on the front, the officer who\r\nreceived it from you--he made a notation of the date of receipt--it is\r\nall in your handwriting?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And it is in the same condition now, isn't it, as it was\r\nwhen you surrendered it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you turn to the diary page to which I have reference\r\nin connection with the first meeting with Marina Oswald, and that is\r\nwhat month and what page and what date?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is on the page for February, and the only thing I can----\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. February what year?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. February 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And the day please?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There is a notation on the 22d of February.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me, there is a square with the figure 22 in it\r\nindicating February 22, 1963. Do you have something written in there?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What is written in there?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It says \"Everett's?\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that all there is in that square?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is all.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you explain that and how it related to what you are\r\nnow telling us?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I believe it refers to the invitation to come to his home.\r\nAs I recall, he telephoned me twice, first to say that they might\r\nget together a group of people, hence the question mark. Then he\r\ncalled again to say they were going to have a party, and to make the\r\ninvitation definite.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now you used the expression \"I believe.\" Is that your best\r\nrecollection at the moment?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is my best recollection.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And I went over this with you this morning and you gave me\r\nthe same explanation, did you not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now did that event take place?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And what is your best recollection as to the day of the\r\nmonth it took place?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have no other way of guessing when it was except to\r\nassume that this notation means it was on the 22d of February.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that does represent your present best recollection\r\nrefreshed to the extent it is refreshed by the memorandum before you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right, and of course this first----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What day of the week was that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That was a Friday.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Friday night. You attended the party did you not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes, I did.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I believe you used the word Friday. I don't believe she\r\ndid, Friday night. You said Friday night.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was Friday evening.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Friday evening?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The 22d was Friday. I don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. You used the word \"evening\"?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was an evening party.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It was held in Mr. Glover's home was it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes, it was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where is his home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. At that time he was living in the Highland Park section of\r\nDallas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How far from your home is that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Half hour drive.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. By what means did you get to Mr. Glover's home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I drove.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You owned or then had, or maybe you still have a station\r\nwagon?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is it the same car still?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is the same car.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And when you arrived, were either of the Oswalds present?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am not sure I recall accurately. I think they came a\r\nlittle after I arrived.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you give us your best recollection of all the people,\r\ncouples if you can remember them that way, and then single persons or\r\npersons there without their wives or husbands, as the case may be, that\r\nevening?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, I will try. The Oswalds, two were there, Marina and\r\nLee, Everett Glover, the host, Mr. and Mrs. De Mohrenschildt who were\r\nthe friendship link between the Oswalds and Glover.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Could I interrupt you there? Had you known the De\r\nMohrenschildts?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I had never met them. I have not met them since.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is the only occasion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That you ever saw either Mr. or Mrs. De Mohrenschildt?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You had no conversations, no letters, no contact whatsoever\r\nwith them either before or after this party?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is correct, no contact whatsoever before or after.\r\nThere was a roommate of Everett's. Dirk, I think, I forget the name.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Are you attempting to recall his first name or his last\r\nname?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. His first name. I may be wrong. It was a young German\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Schmidt?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Do you know the first name?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. No, I don't recall the first name.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And he had two roommates, so that is two other single men,\r\nand I don't recall their names.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was each of them there?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. They were both there.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. There were two roommates.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Two roommates and they were both present at the party. I\r\nshould remember their names but I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And there was a couple who lived in Irving; again I don't\r\nrecall the name. I don't believe I have seen any of these people since\r\nwith the exception of one of the roommates once, and again I don't\r\nrecall the name.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you see the roommate the second----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I may have seen him since. All these people were new to me\r\nwhen I came to the party with the exception of Everett.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you see the roommate the second time before or after\r\nNovember 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Oh, it was before.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But it is a fact that none of these people who were at the\r\nparty other than Mr. Glover had you seen or heard of?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Before.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Up to the time that the party was held.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you exhausted your present recollection as to the\r\npeople who were present on that occasion.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I can't get a name. The couple were living in Irving, I\r\nrecall that, but I don't--I have forgotten their name.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now the Oswalds arrived shortly after the party began or at\r\nleast after you arrived?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I believe they came with the De Mohrenschildts.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you were introduced, were you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes, I was introduced.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. By whom?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't recall. It was a very informal gathering. Marina\r\nwas wearing slacks and Mrs. De Mohrenschildt also was. I doubt pains\r\nwere taken with the introductions.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I doubt any pains were taken with the introductions.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How long did the party proceed?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It must have started something after 8 o'clock and went\r\nuntil towards midnight.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have an interest in square dancing and that sort of\r\nthing also. Did you do any of that then?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No. We talked and ate.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you do any madrigal singing?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. No singing that evening?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now before I get to any specificity with respect to Marina\r\nand Lee Oswald, was Russian spoken that night by anybody?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you speak Russian?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Who else at the party had some facility with Russian in\r\naddition to Lee Oswald and Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Just the De Mohrenschildts, both of them, and myself.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And yourself. Did you mention that Mr. Glover had some\r\ninterest in the Russian language?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No, I don't believe he does.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He did not, all right. Were the Oswalds really the center\r\nof attention that evening?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think so, yes, although you can't say that there was a\r\nsingle center for the entire evening. It wasn't like being invited to\r\nhear what he had to say. It was much more informal than that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you speak with Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes, I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you converse with her during the course of the evening?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Very briefly. She spent the first part of the evening\r\ntrying to get June to go to sleep.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. June is her daughter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The little girl with her.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She brought her daughter with her did she?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes, and then we talked some in the kitchen with Mrs. De\r\nMohrenschildt, Marina and I.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And what subject did you ladies pursue?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I really can't remember. The actual conversation with\r\nMarina didn't cover much time at all. I saw very little of her that\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That evening?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Can you remember any subject you talked to her about in the\r\nkitchen?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What subjects were discussed, I assume in the living room\r\nor--where everybody was gathered? Do you recall what was being pursued\r\nthere in the way of conversation.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Part of the time Lee talked with people who were asking\r\nhim about his trip to Russia. I believe Everett had told me that he\r\nhad been, so I knew that when I arrived. And the fact that he had gone\r\nintending to become a citizen in the Soviet Union. He talked freely and\r\nwith considerable interest in his subject to the three or four people\r\naround him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were you gathered in that group?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Part of the time at least I was listening to that. He spoke\r\nof the things about the Soviet Union that had displeased him, as for\r\ninstance the censorship. He knew that it had been going on regarding\r\nhis letters.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mrs. Paine, when you talk in terms of conclusion, we have\r\na little trouble testifying. If you will give us examples such as\r\nyou just gave us about censorship, could we go back a moment to the\r\nconversation about his going to Russia. During the course of that\r\nsubject, in questions put to him, was anything he listed as to why he\r\nwent to Russia? May I have a yes or no first?\r\n\r\nDo you recall anything like that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I can't be certain that this is when I first got an idea\r\nabout why he wanted to go or whether I learned this later.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Does your memory serve you enough so that there is a fair\r\npossibility that--it is important to us--was the subject discussed at\r\nthat gathering?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think so.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that is your best recollection?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now would you give us your best recollection of what he\r\nsaid or what Marina said, but primarily what Mr. Oswald said on that\r\nsubject. Why did he go to Russia?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I carry the impression, and I think it is recalled from\r\nthis evening----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me. When you say you carry the impression you are\r\nsaying \"It is my present recollection.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. All right. That he spoke of himself as a Marxist that\r\nevening, that he had read certain Marxist books and thought that the\r\nSoviet economic system was superior to ours, and wanted to go to the\r\nSoviet Union and live there.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What response was elicited from others at the meeting,\r\nagreement?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; I would not say there was any agreement. People were\r\ninterested. This is an unusual thing to do. And they were interested in\r\nhearing how he found Soviet life, what he thought of it, whether he was\r\npleased or disappointed.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you be good enough to tell the members of the\r\nCommission what Mr. Oswald said in those respects, to the best of your\r\nrecollection?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He mentioned that he was displeased with the censorship, or\r\nat least he commented on it in a way that I took as unfavorable.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Thank you, Ma'am.\r\n\r\nDid he say he was----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. What had happened, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What censorship is he talking about?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He referred to a letter that had been sent to him by Robert\r\nOswald that he later learned, after he had come back to the United\r\nStates, had been sent. He had not received it. He judged that they had\r\nsimply stopped it, and he commented that they are more apt to just take\r\na letter than take out a piece of it and then send it on, and that\r\ncensorship is more obvious.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right, go on.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I wondered, listening to him, whether he really was----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me, please. Before we get to what you wondered\r\nabout, exhaust your recollection as to what he said, what others might\r\nhave said on the subjects in his presence about which he talked.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is all I can think of.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You mentioned, also, Mrs. Paine, that there was discussed\r\nthat evening the subject of his return to America.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Obviously, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Why he returned, was that subject discussed?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Not very much, no. I can't recall any specifics relating to\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All you can recall, I take it, at the moment, is that there\r\nwas an allusion to the subject?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, he was clearly here, yes. He had come back,\r\nand--well, I have to put it in terms of what I guess or what I feel was\r\nhis reaction. I can't give you a specific recall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. We have no objection to your doing that. We would like\r\nto have you first state all you can recall as to what specifically\r\nhappened in this instance. How did Mr. Oswald treat or regard--what\r\nrelationship did you gather existed between Marina and her husband,\r\na cordial one as of that occasion, separating from what you learned\r\nafterward, but just this initial instance. What impression did you have?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Almost none. There was very little contact between them\r\nduring the evening. He spoke English to those that were asking them\r\nquestions. She was either in the bedroom by herself trying to get the\r\nlittle baby to go to sleep, or in the kitchen speaking Russian to the\r\nDe Mohrenschildts. I listened more than I spoke in that situation.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When Mr. Oswald was in the living room with you ladies and\r\ngentlemen, the conversation was in English, was it not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I take it, then, that when Marina returned to the room\r\nRussian was spoken, at least by those who had command of the Russian\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. When she was in the same room, there was more than one\r\nconversation going on, and in two languages.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When anybody spoke to Marina----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was in Russian.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It was in Russian. When people spoke with each other other\r\nthan with Marina, it was in English, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is my best recollection.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, in very short compass what was your impression of Mr.\r\nOswald at that initial party?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I thought he was pleased to be interesting to this group\r\nof people and glad to tell them about his experience, to answer their\r\nquestions. He seemed open and forthright. I did wonder as he was\r\ntalking about it whether he had come to the conclusion after being in\r\nthe Soviet Union that their system was inferior.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Inferior to ours?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. To ours, or whether he still thought that the Soviet system\r\nwas a better one. His discussion of the censorship made me feel that\r\nhe wanted his listeners to know that he was not blind to the defects\r\nof the Soviet system, but it did not convince me that he was in favor\r\nof the American system. I was left wondering which country he thought\r\nconducted itself better.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you have an interest in the Oswalds at this moment\r\nwholly apart from your interest in the Russian language?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were you intellectually curious about them is all I meant.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Oh, yes. Well, it is most unusual to take such a step as he\r\ntook.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had you had some notice in advance of this meeting, Mrs.\r\nPaine, of the fact that Mr. Oswald was at least--there had been\r\npublications of his having been a defector?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; I wasn't aware of that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When did you first learn of that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, a name is always given to someone who goes to the\r\nSoviet Union and wants to have citizenship there, isn't it, so I could\r\nwell have assumed that there had been such, but I really didn't learn\r\nabout it until after the assassination, I guess. No; I take it back.\r\n\r\nThere was a reference now.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That evening?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Specific recall. It is coming. The content of Robert's\r\nletter to him, as I recall, included a clipping from the Fort Worth\r\nnewspapers relative to his defection.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me, Mrs. Paine, you are talking about a letter of\r\nRobert Oswald's?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. A letter from Robert to Lee which Lee never got but heard\r\nabout when he came back to the States.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that was the subject of discussion that evening?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That came up, so, therefore, I did know that he had been\r\ncalled a defector.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did Robert refer to this letter or did someone in the\r\nmeeting refer to the letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Lee referred to the letter in discussion of censorship.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But up until that moment, you had not had any prior\r\nimpression with respect to whether he had been a defector or an\r\nattempted defector?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, I think, yes; I had some impression of that sort,\r\nbut it came directly from Lee. He said he went to the Soviet Union\r\nand tried to give up his American citizenship, and as I recall, he\r\nsaid that the American embassy did not relinquish his passport, and,\r\ntherefore, he was not eligible to get Soviet citizenship.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are remembering more now.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am pleased that you are, Mrs. Paine. He did discuss his\r\nattempts to obtain----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. To surrender his passport and to accomplish his Soviet\r\ncitizenship?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that was openly discussed in this gathering?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. This is Senator Cooper, a member of the Commission, Mrs.\r\nPaine.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. How do you do?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This party, I gather, lasted approximately from 7 to 12,\r\ndid you say?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Eight to eleven-thirty or twelve.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And the party broke up, and you went home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What was your overall impression of Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I had very little impression altogether. I did ask for her\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Why did you do that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And I asked if I could write her. I wanted to go visit her\r\nat her home.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Why?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. To talk Russian. She is very hard to find, a person\r\nspeaking modern Russian, and in fact I know of no other, and this was\r\nan opportunity for me to again practice in the language, a rather\r\nunusual opportunity, and I was interested in meeting her and getting to\r\nknow her.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chairman, I will go back and develop this lady's\r\ninterest in the Russian language during the course of the examination,\r\nand her prior study of the language up to this point. She did have an\r\nabiding interest in the language at this particular point, but I wanted\r\nto get at the initial meeting first before anything further.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Very well.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You say modern Russian, that Marina Oswald had a command of\r\nmodern Russian. Would you please explain to us what you mean by that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, I am not in a position to judge a person, whether a\r\nperson is speaking modern Russian or not. My language is not that good,\r\nbut she talked with--this was later, I only assumed that she had--I\r\nhoped that she spoke good Russian. I didn't know at that time whether\r\nshe spoke educated Russian or not. Shall I jump ahead?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Well, I wish you wouldn't. You meant, then, by your\r\nexpression that you hoped to find that she did speak educated Russian?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And if she did, that then you might profit or learn from\r\nher educated Russian to a greater degree than you knew it as of that\r\ntime? That was your main interest at the moment?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Aside from interests in another lady or human being under\r\nthose circumstances?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, until I then got to know her it was my only interest.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes. That is the point I was seeking to make. Did you\r\nbecome better acquainted with the Oswalds thereafter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I met----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you, first, yes or no?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I became better acquainted with Marina.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chairman, if members of the Commission--I am going to\r\npass from this initial event--if you have any questions you would like\r\nto put to the witness now rather than my deferring it.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Are there any questions?\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Not for me.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Not at this point.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. May I ask one? Did Oswald, Lee Oswald on this occasion\r\nexpress any dislike for any elements or aspects of American society?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I can't recall anything specific that was said.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. He did not indicate to this group why it was that he left\r\nthe United States to go to Russia originally?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is hard to say how I formed this opinion, but I gathered\r\nthat he disapproved of the economic system.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Was there anything more specific than that that he referred\r\nto? Did he refer, for example, to any dislike of individuals?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Individuals? No; I am certain there was none.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. In government or out of government?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Your impression was that he was motivated to go to the\r\nSoviet Union because he didn't like the capitalist system?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. And had an affinity for what might be called the Marxist\r\nsystem, is that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. That is all the questions that I have.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Along those lines, Mrs. Paine, did he make any remarks\r\nwith respect to workers in Russia as compared with the position, the\r\neconomic position of workers in America? Did he refer to workers as a\r\nsubject?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am trying to refresh your recollection. You said\r\neconomics, he thought that the economic situation was superior in\r\nRussia. I wonder whether he related it to the ordinary worker rather\r\nthan the overall system.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. How well did Marina speak English at the time you\r\nmade the first acquaintance or first contact?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I was under the impression she spoke no English at all.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did she appear to understand any English at that\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't believe she understood much of anything.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That was your definite impression?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you hear her speak any English words that evening?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. None whatsoever?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Senator Cooper?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I believe you said a few minutes ago that you were\r\ninterested in knowing why Lee Oswald left the United States and went to\r\nRussia. Did you say that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, I don't recall saying it. I suppose I was curious.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I don't recall that she actually said that. She said it was\r\nan interesting situation.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was unusual, I think I probably said.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. She used the word unusual.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. An unusual thing to do, certainly.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I don't want to say that you said something you didn't,\r\nbut I got the impression that one of the reasons you were interested\r\nin meeting this family was in fact that this man had left the United\r\nStates and gone to Russia.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. In some sense?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Not in any sense whatever.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. As I recall it she did say that this was an unusual\r\nsituation, and that to some extent developed your interest. This is Mr.\r\nDulles, a member of the Commission.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Maybe I could put it this way. Perhaps we could read\r\nback and find out, but I thought that you intimated or indicated that\r\nyou were interested in the fact that this man had gone to Russia.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Perhaps I can answer your question----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. And it provoked your interest.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I can answer it this way. I was interested at the party to\r\nhear something of what he had to say. I was hopeful when I wrote and\r\ninquired if I could see Marina where they lived; and knowing that he\r\nwould be at work, that I would try to go during the week when I would\r\nhave a chance simply to talk with her.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. That night he did say that he did not like the\r\ncapitalist system?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is my best recollection.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Were you interested, then, in finding out what it was\r\nabout it he didn't like?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. In reference to his experience in Russia or for any\r\nother reason?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. You didn't inquire further to have him elaborate on his\r\nreasons for not liking the capitalist system?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No. Of course, it is a rather short space of time we are\r\ntalking about, perhaps 45 minutes or so or less. People were inquiring\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But others did inquire on these subjects?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. For the most part the other people asked questions, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On the subject that Senator Cooper has inquired about, is\r\nthat true?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now perhaps to help your recollection a little bit on that,\r\nwas this roommate of whom you speak named Volkmar Schmidt?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Volkmar sounds familiar.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you recall a couple by the name of Richard Pierce, or\r\na gentleman at least by the name of Richard Pierce who attended that\r\nmeeting?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; that would be the other roommate, not a couple, he was\r\nsingle, Richard Pierce.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there not present a Miss Betty MacDonald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Which I had completely forgotten about, yes; there was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you still are unable to recall the name of the other\r\ncouple?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am unable to. Betty MacDonald I do recall lives in the\r\nsame apartment building as this couple, and it is a long German sort of\r\nname, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had you become acquainted with Mr. Glover through your\r\nhusband?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, you might say so. We both became interested in going\r\nto madrigal sings at the same time. My interest in madrigals was\r\ndeveloped by Michael, but that was before we ever moved to Texas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were you teaching Russian at this time?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You were not? Had you done any teaching of Russian prior to\r\nthis occasion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You subsequently did some teaching; have you done some\r\nteaching of Russian?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Just this past summer.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes. I will get to that in due course. Did you do some\r\ntranslating that evening for Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You did not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I spoke to her very little. I was embarrassed to.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Why was that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Because my Russian was so poor, and the De Mohrenschildts\r\ncould both do it all so much better.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was Mr. Oswald's command of Russian very good, also?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I didn't hear him speak Russian that night at all.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Oh, is that so?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He may have, but I don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He did no translating?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No. For her, no.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. For Marina. And on no occasion--he sat there and on none of\r\nthe occasions did he translate, but, rather, Mr. De Mohrenschildt did\r\nthe translating?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't even believe that was translating. They would\r\naddress themselves to her in a separate conversation from what was\r\ngoing on from these three or four around him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So that those who did not understand Russian got nothing\r\nfrom it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Those who did not understand English got nothing from what\r\nhe was saying--is that what you mean, or do you mean the other way?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. If no one interpreted her in English, translated for her.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No one understood it; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Then whose who didn't understand Russian----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did not understand what she was saying?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that went on through the entire evening?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. You must understand she was not present for, I would say,\r\nmore than half of the evening. She was just with her child.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But while she was present.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There was no translation done for her benefit.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Or for the benefit of anybody else who did not understand\r\nRussian?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The other way; no. It is a long time ago.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Oh, yes. Was anything the subject that evening of Mrs.\r\nOswald's family background? Was that discussed?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Of Marina's?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; nothing.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It was not discussed at anytime during that evening, the\r\nfact that she was in Russia, she had been educated as, and was, a\r\npharmacist?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That might have been said. I don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What was your reaction to the De Mohrenschildts that\r\nevening?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I had heard from Everett that they were interesting people,\r\nthat they had gone on a hiking tour through Mexico taking pictures\r\nas they went. I learned or had known from Everett, also, in this one\r\ntelephone conversation, that he was a geologist, a free lancer.\r\n\r\nMrs. De Mohrenschildt seemed somewhat protective toward Marina in the\r\nsense of wanting her to understand what was--wanting to talk with her,\r\nto include her. Mr. De Mohrenschildt talked about his past life some in\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. His speaking of his past life was in English?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Was in English. I recalled to him his first wife who was\r\nalso a Quaker. I remember he said that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When was your next contact with either Marina Oswald or Lee\r\nOswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I wrote a letter, a note to Marina at the address I had\r\nbeen given, and got a note back saying, \"We have moved. This is the new\r\naddress. Come in perhaps a week.\" From that time. She wanted to get the\r\nhouse cleaned up before I came.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. They lived in Dallas, did they not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That was in Dallas; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On this February 22 occasion they were then living on Neely\r\nStreet in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I believe they moved just in that period that I had the\r\nprevious address, and as soon as I wrote, the first letter I got back\r\ngave the Neely Street address.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have recorded that, have you not, in your address book?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which I will follow up in a moment. Do you have a copy of\r\nthe letter that you wrote to Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No. That initial letter asking if I could come over? I\r\ndon't believe I do.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Not having----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have her reply.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You do have a reply?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have her reply.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you have it with you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She drew a map. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. May I have it, please?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Do you want it right now?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. All right. Wait--no; perhaps I have it at the hotel. I\r\ndon't think it is here. I didn't think I would be before the Commission\r\ntoday at all.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. We will pass that. You can get it tonight.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; I am certain I have it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That was written in Russian, I assume.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Oh, yes; in my letter to her, bad Russian.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. As long as you have the letter I don't want you to attempt\r\nto summarize it then, but you did write her a note in which you sought\r\nto come see her. She responded advising you of a change of address.\r\nThere would be some delay, I gather, because she wished to get her home\r\nin order, having just moved. And this exchange of letters took place\r\napproximately when?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was early March some time.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think her letter is postmarked the 8th of March.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. After that exchange of letters, did you see Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you go to her home or did she come to yours?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I drove to her home. There would be no way for her to come.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had you had another exchange of letters before you went to\r\nher home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You just waited a few days, guessed how long it would take\r\nher to have her home in order, and you visited her, am I correct in my\r\nsummary?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She suggested Tuesday, as I recall in her letter, but what\r\nTuesday I don't know. If it was written the 8th that would be Tuesday\r\nthe 12th. There is no notation on my calendar.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But you do have her response to your letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; that is what I have.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In the hotel. We will get that this evening. Was Mr. Oswald\r\nhome when you visited her?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On the next occasion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He was not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you make a description in your calendar with respect to\r\nthis visit?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I judge not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you find any in your calendar?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. With respect to this visit?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. By the way, that calendar is all in your handwriting, isn't\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence as Exhibit No. 401 the\r\ndocument that has been given that exhibit number.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 401, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What time of day was this visit, Mrs. Paine?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was midmorning, up to lunchtime. She had hoped I could\r\nstay through lunch but I wanted to get back so my children could have\r\nnaps.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there anybody at home to care for your children when\r\nyou made this visit?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I took them.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Oh, you took them.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Therefore, I wanted to get them home to take naps.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What is the driving time from your home in Irving----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Thirty-five to forty minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. To the Neely Street address of the Oswalds?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I take it--or was Mr. Oswald home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Just Marina? And that visit--tell us about that visit,\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I fear my recollection may meld one or two visits that\r\noccurred in March.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It might be a good idea, then,--go ahead and tell us about\r\nthem in a melded form.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. All right. I recall we walked out to a nearby park.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. In both cases?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am not sure.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You think so?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Anyway, I recall walking to the park, and I think this was\r\nthe first visit, and we sat and talked. It was warm weather, March, in\r\nDallas. And the children played on the park equipment, and we talked,\r\nand she told me that she was expecting a baby, and asked me not to talk\r\nabout it among the Russian community.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me. Had anything been said on that subject when you\r\nfirst met Marina Oswald the night of February 22?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Nothing? This was your first notice of that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And she told you not--would you repeat that, please?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She told me that she was expecting a child.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She told you not to do what?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Not to tell members of the Russian-speaking community in\r\nDallas. She preferred for it not to be publicly known, so to speak.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were you in contact with the Russian-speaking community in\r\nDallas?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you say that to her on that occasion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, it is a contact I could have had. It was reasonable\r\nfor her to assume I might be.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But you said nothing in response to that. Did you reassure\r\nher?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I just said I wouldn't talk about it, that it was up to her\r\nto make such an announcement when she felt like it.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. May I ask a question at this point?\r\n\r\nYou said Lee Oswald was not there. A little earlier in your testimony\r\nyou said you hoped he would not be there.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Why did you say that? Was it because you took any dislike\r\nto his being there or was it merely because you wanted exclusive\r\ncontact with Marina, or both?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I certainly wanted to make the contact with Marina. She\r\nhad not appeared as a person at all at the party. I couldn't tell what\r\nsort of person she was, and I felt meeting alone with her would make\r\nan opportunity both to speak the language and to find out what sort of\r\nperson she was.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Go on. Did you have any further motivation for that wish?\r\nDid you take any dislike to him?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Not an active dislike, but I didn't like him. I think we\r\ncan say that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you gathered that impression the evening of February 22?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is very hard to know whether I gathered it then or in\r\nterms of things she told me then after we met, and I will outline them.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes; we will get into those.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I would say it was more formed later.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And in your responding to Mr. McCloy's question you were\r\nattempting to transport yourself back to that particular occasion and\r\nnot be affected by the course of events that had taken place in the\r\nmeantime, am I correct about that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I tried to.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. To the best of your ability. Tell us a little more, then,\r\nto the extent you have a recollection what occurred and what was said\r\nin the park on that occasion.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, I recall that we talked, and, as I said, it may be\r\nthe first visit or it may have been the first and the second melded\r\nin my mind. She said that she was expecting a baby. She said that Lee\r\ndidn't want her to learn English. He was not encouraging her to learn\r\nEnglish or helping her with it, that he spoke only Russian to her and\r\nto their baby June. And she told me--now, let me say that my calendar\r\ndoes show a notation on the 20th of March, it says, \"Marina\" and I\r\njudge I went again to see her at her home on that day, or brought her\r\nto my house, I am not certain which. But I judge, also, that this was\r\nthe second visit.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I suggest that you might have melded these a moment ago.\r\nNow I wish you would keep these apart for the moment.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. So far as I can.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And stick with the occasion in the park first and exhaust\r\nyour recollection.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, I was impressed, talking with her in the park, with\r\nwhat I felt to be her need to have a friend. This was virtually our\r\nfirst meeting, but she confided to me something that she didn't want\r\ngenerally known among the Russian segment.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That was her pregnancy?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Of Dallas. She inquired of me, a young woman, about birth\r\ncontrol methods, and she said that she felt--well, clearly this\r\npregnancy had surprised her, but she said that she didn't believe in\r\nabortion, and didn't want to consider such a course.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you exhausted your recollection?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is all I recall; yes.\r\n\r\nI do not recall whether it was this time or the next time, it may well\r\nhave been the next time, that she told me that----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me, please.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. All right, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I would like to stick with this. When Mrs. Oswald, this is\r\nyour first visit, she related to you and said that her husband did not\r\nwish her to acquire any command of the English language, what did you\r\nsay? Did you express yourself in some fashion as to why? Didn't that\r\nseem curious to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I likely said that----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is best you don't guess.\r\n\r\nGive us your best recollection.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. My best recollection is that she did most of the talking\r\nbecause she could. My Russian was bad enough that if she talked I was\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you feel any embarrassment because you were----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Oh, a terrible embarrassment.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You did?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is a terrible impediment to talking and to friendship.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I wish you would elaborate on that because I am sure the\r\nmembers of the Commission would like to have your mental reaction to\r\nwhat you thought was your limited command of the Russian language and\r\nwhether it interfered with communication between you.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It interfered very markedly.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you elaborate?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I could think of many more things to say than I could think\r\nof the words to use in order to say it in Russian. I want to keep\r\njumping ahead to illustrate this. But just it was very difficult for me\r\nto communicate.\r\n\r\nI understand much more readily than I speak, so that I could understand\r\nwhat she was saying to me easily, especially as she took care to see\r\nthat she used small words and made herself understood.\r\n\r\nBut it was very difficult for me just to speak. I could not possibly\r\nhave reacted to her as I would to someone else in English, as I would\r\nif she had been speaking English.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. At this time you felt that she could not gain very much if\r\nyou talked to her in English?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I was certain of that, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But later she had improved, apparently?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. After the assassination, to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That was after the assassination?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. I never knew her to speak English at all.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Or to understand?\r\n\r\nI wasn't speaking of just speaking, but about the comprehension of it.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, she said to me in November that she has changed from\r\nnever listening to an English conversation to giving it some of her\r\nattention because she is able to pick up some words. You know how if\r\nyou don't understand anything there is no point even----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I personally got the impression when she was here that she\r\nunderstood a good deal of English.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I believe she does, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But this time she did not have that facility at all?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you not think it was curious that her husband was\r\nadverse to her acquiring some facility with the English language?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I thought it was distinctly thoughtless on his part, even\r\ncruel.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you discuss it with her to the extent that you could in\r\nyour limited command of Russian?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think the easiest thing was to agree with what she was\r\nsaying about it, agree with what she was saying.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which was what?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Which is that this wasn't the way it should be and I\r\ncertainly agreed.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She complained, did she?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She complained, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. Did she express an interest, then, in acquiring some\r\nfacility?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Not against his wishes, no. She didn't express an interest.\r\nIn learning English through me, for instance.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes. She showed no interest unlike the interest you had in\r\nher helping you with Russian, she showed no interest at that moment in\r\nlearning from you some command of the English language?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now you think the second occasion occurring in your\r\ncalendar entry there was possibly March 20?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And what is the entry?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It says, \"Marina\".\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that is the only word?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is all it says.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In that square?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Probably I went again to her home.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me. Does that refresh your recollection as to\r\nanything on that occasion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It does not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am guessing, again, that this was the second meeting. I\r\nthink I went to her home twice before I carried her from her place to\r\nmy home, which was considerably more of an event, since it was 35 or 40\r\nminutes each way, going twice in one day.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You say carry?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Carry, that is a good Texas term for driving a person in a\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. I must say there, that is an old term even in Kentucky.\r\nYou take some person some place you carry them.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. You carry them; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is an odd expression to me.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have been in Texas longer than I think.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I take it then there were two occasions when you visited\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I believe there were two down there, and then I asked her,\r\nwent to pick her up and brought her to my home and we spent a portion\r\nof the day at my home, and I then took her back.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This was at your invitation?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; surely.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had you by this time--let us take the March 20 affair,\r\noccasion--had you some feeling of affinity or liking for Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. As a person?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I did feel that she was in a difficult position from the\r\nfirst I met her.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, chronologically, would you in your own words, so that\r\nI don't suggest anything to you, what was the next occasion?\r\n\r\nThe next time it was under circumstances in which you went to her home\r\nin your station wagon, picked her up and brought her to your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was probably then that she mentioned to me that Lee\r\nwanted her to go back to the Soviet Union, was asking her to go back.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He mentioned this subject as early as that, did he not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This was still in March.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She did?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She did, yes; and said that she didn't want to go.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The Commission is interested in that. Would you please\r\nrelate it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She said she did not want to go back, that he asked her to\r\ngo back, told her, perhaps, to go back.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. State just as accurately----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. As she described it I felt----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Just what she said now, please.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He told her he wanted to send her back with June.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Alone?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. To the Soviet Union. As she described it, I judged that\r\nmeant----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Please----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. A divorce----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Instead of saying as she described it tell us what she\r\nsaid, if you can.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She said that she had written to the Soviet Embassy to ask\r\nabout papers to go back, and received a reply from them saying, \"Why do\r\nyou want to go back?\" And she said she just didn't answer that letter\r\nbecause she didn't want to go back, and that that was where the matter\r\nstood at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She had not answered the letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The inquiry from the Embassy. She did not answer it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did she say whether or not she showed that answer from the\r\nSoviet Embassy to her husband?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; she didn't say.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did I understand you to say that Marina said to you that\r\nshe thought that meant a divorce?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I will state again that she felt she was being sent back to\r\nstay back, that he would stay here, that this amounted to the end of\r\nthe marriage for them, but not legally done.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. And did she express any opinion of opposition to\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She particularly was opposed to going back. It was leaving\r\nthe United States that she was opposed to.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She wanted to stay here, did she?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; very much so.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I ask you this general question, then, Mrs. Paine: During\r\nall of your contact with Marina Oswald, did she ever express any view\r\nother than that one of wanting to remain in America?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; she did not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did she? Was she affirmative about it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Very.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Of wanting to stay in this country?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, what did you say when she related that her husband\r\nwanted her to return to Russia, and she thought to remain in Russia.\r\nDid it elicit some curiosity from you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Curiosity? It elicited anger at Lee that he would presume\r\nto drop his responsibilities so preemptorily.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you discuss it with her?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I wrote a letter to her in an effort to gather my words.\r\nI couldn't just discuss it with her. My language was not that good.\r\nWhat I wanted to do was offer her an alternative to being sent back,\r\nan economic alternative, and I thought for some time and thought over\r\na week about inviting her to live with me. I was alone with my two\r\nchildren at the time, as an alternative to being sent back. If he\r\nthought he couldn't support her or didn't care to or whatever reason he\r\nhad, I simply wanted to say there was an alternative to her going back,\r\nthat she could stay and live with me if she wanted to. I wrote such a\r\nletter, really, to gather----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you have it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; I do. This letter was never sent.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that also at the hotel?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't know. It may be here. I can look if you want. This\r\nletter was never sent and never mentioned to her. I wrote it so that\r\nI would have the words before me to use if it seemed appropriate to\r\nme to make the invitation, you see, a way of gathering enough of the\r\nlanguage, enough Russian, and to say what I wanted to say. And this\r\nletter is dated the 7th of April.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The 7th of April?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And I know I spent at least a week thinking about it. I\r\ntalked it over with Michael before I wrote it, and it is plainly marked\r\n\"never sent\" on the letter. I carried it with me, as I recall I carried\r\nit once to the apartment so that if----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. To what apartment?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. To their apartment on Neely Street, so that if it seemed\r\nappropriate I could hand it to her, you see. I could make this\r\ninvitation at home with time and a dictionary in hand, and then let her\r\nread it. It was ever so much easier than just trying to say it.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Though you never delivered it, did you ever speak from it\r\nto her?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. When she was staying with me the last few days of April and\r\nthe first week of May, I made, yes, a verbal invitation of that sort,\r\nand in the April 7 letter, I have just gone over this correspondence or\r\nI wouldn't recall what it said, but----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me, Mrs. Paine. I think we can take the time to see\r\nif you have the letter in your bag.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am sorry that I feel precipitated into a discussion\r\nof this correspondence, and I would rather--no, it is not here--go\r\nat it--there are several things I want to say about it. I began to\r\nmention it to Mr. Jenner this morning and thought we would have a whole\r\nafternoon to talk more.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. We will have time tonight, Mrs. Paine.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. You will have time tonight?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I thought Mr. Redlich might look at the letter. I didn't\r\nwant to delay the Commission. You do have it at hand?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is not here. It is at the hotel.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I would like to return to something else for the moment,\r\nthen, first.\r\n\r\nWhat reasons did Marina give, if she gave any, as to why her husband\r\nwished her to return to Russia? What did she say on that subject?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She didn't say.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Nothing at all?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. No explanation?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On that occasion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I meant by that last question to imply that there might\r\nhave been another occasion subsequently in which the subject was\r\ndiscussed again in which she did state what Mr. Oswald's reasons were,\r\nif any?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She never stated any reasons.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Never?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She implied that it was because he didn't want her.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He didn't what?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Want her.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What is the date of this letter, April 7?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. We will take a brief recess.\r\n\r\n(Brief recess.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, would you turn to your calendar, please. What is the\r\nnext day, date, in your calendar, in which you have an entry?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Regarding the Oswalds?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Regarding the Oswalds.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is April 2, Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What is the entry?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. \"Marina and Lee dinner.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Now, I take it that by this time, that is, up to\r\nApril 2 you had had several visits with Marina and you had reached the\r\npoint at which you invited them to your home for dinner?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. Now, Michael had never met either. By this time I had\r\ntalked to him. I had indeed invited them to stay indefinitely.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And so I wanted him to meet them and invited them both to\r\ncome to dinner.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me, Mrs. Paine, if I seem presumptuous.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But you have stated several times, and now you state you\r\ninquired of your husband as to whether you could invite Marina to stay\r\nwith you. Didn't you think that was a little presumptuous on your part\r\nto invite a man's wife to come to live with you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, toward Lee it was presumptuous.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Beg pardon?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Presumptuous in relation to Lee.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In relation to Lee?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Indeed it is. Well, I will have to refer again to the\r\nletter of April 7 where I said I didn't want to hurt Lee by such an\r\ninvitation, but that if they were unhappy, if their marital situation\r\nwas similar to mine, and this is not specifically in the letter, but if\r\nhe just did not want to live with her, that I would have offered this\r\nas an alternative, really to both of them. I didn't want to get into a\r\nposition of competition with Lee for his wife. I thought about that,\r\nand thought he might be very offended.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is possible he might very well be.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes, it is possible he even might have been violent, but I\r\ndidn't think anything about that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you have any impression of him up to this moment on\r\nthis score?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. As a man of temper?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Violence?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. None of that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No. I had met him once.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You invited the Oswalds to dinner on the evening of April 2?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What day of the week was that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did anything occur that evening?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, Michael picked them up.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Who did?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Michael picked them up.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Your husband?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. At the Neely Street address. Has he talked about that? It\r\ndidn't come up?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I don't know. I haven't the slightest notion. I was talking\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Should I go ahead? I just want to get this first impression\r\ninto the record somewhere if he hasn't already.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I think it would be helpful if you gave your\r\nimpression of his impression.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Of his impression.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. All right. This I have learned since the assassination, he\r\ndidn't give me this impression as at the time we didn't talk that much.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Please, you are not giving us your impression of his\r\nimpression on this occasion, but rather your impression of what he said\r\nto you after the assassination.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. You still want it?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I think it is important.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Let us hear it.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He said--you must understand, that not living together\r\nwe talked together very little. I am sure he would have given me\r\nhis impression if we had been having dinner together the next day\r\nafterwards, you see. He went over and Marina was not yet ready. He\r\nthought that Lee was somewhat thoughtless. While doing absolutely\r\nnothing to help her get ready, get the baby's things together, prepare\r\nhimself, he was quite impatient, thought she should be ready, and gave\r\norders while he himself sat down and talked to Michael, and Michael\r\ncarried the impression that Lee was somewhat thoughtless.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What did you do? That was about a half hour--what did you\r\ndo during that period?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I was at the house preparing the dinner.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You were at home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. It has to be my impression of his impressions. I don't\r\nrecall the evening too well, the evening of the second. I do recall\r\nwe certainly had dinner together. I can't recall what the predominant\r\nlanguage was. Lee and Michael, of course, talked in English. Not\r\nwanting to exclude her entirely from the conversation, I made\r\nopportunity to talk with her in Russian after the meal was over. She\r\nand I did the dishes and talked in Russian, and we were in the kitchen\r\nwhile Michael was talking to Lee in English in the living room, so I do\r\nnot know what was said then between the two of them.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How did your husband get along with Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, you probably have something on that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What was your impression? I want your impression of how\r\nyour husband got along.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Okay. He was initially very interested in learning what\r\nsort of man this was who had taken such a dramatic and unusual step\r\nto go to the Soviet Union and attempt to renounce his citizenship.\r\nHe thought here is a person that must have thought things out for\r\nhimself, a very individualistic person, not a follower of the masses,\r\nand he wanted to hear what the ideology was that led Lee to this step.\r\n\r\nMichael has told me that he very soon felt that there wasn't much\r\nideology or thought, foundation. That Michael had thought he might be\r\nable to learn from this man something and find at least good thinking\r\ngoing on or inquiry, but he didn't find it. He rather found very rigid\r\nadherence to a few principles such as the principle of the capitalist\r\nexploiting the worker, and that this was a great moral failing of the\r\ncapitalistic society. Michael's own feeling was that Lee's view of\r\nmorality was very different from Michael's.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In what respect, Mrs. Paine?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Michael recalls having--now, this is later. This is not\r\nthat evening. Did you expect it was? This is answering your question of\r\nMichael's impression of Lee.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I wanted his initial impression.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. All initial impressions. Well, I have passed that. I have\r\ngone considerably past it, in fact.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. How many times had you seen Marina up to this\r\nmoment, that is, up to April 2?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was two or three times besides the initial party in\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And your best recollection is that this was a nice,\r\npleasant evening, and that was about all?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did your husband take the Oswald's home that evening?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This is the second. When was the next occasion that you had\r\ncontact with either of the Oswalds?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There is a notation of the eighth of April. I am looking on\r\nmy calendar, I have no other way of knowing, and one also on the tenth\r\nwhich has an arrow going to the eleventh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I would like to ask you a little bit about that before you\r\ngo into it. Would you describe for the Commission now the condition,\r\nthe physical condition, of your calendar there?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Physical?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes. There is a square, and in the square there is written\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. \"Marina\" is written this time in Russian. I am improving,\r\nit seems.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In Russian. It is in the square dated April 10.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am talking now about the square on April 8. There is a\r\nnotation \"Marina\".\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that all there is in that square?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is all that is in that square.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Then the only thing that appears in the square for April 10\r\nis the name \"Marina\" in Russian, and an arrow pointing, an arrow from\r\nit pointing, to April 11.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, go back, if you will, to April 8.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Does that refresh your recollection or stimulate you as to\r\nwhether you had any contact with Marina on that day or whether it was\r\nprearranged and what the occasion was?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Certainly, it says that there had been an arrangement to\r\nget together. Whether we did I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I thought you had read everything that appeared in that\r\nsquare. Is there more than just the word \"Marina\" in the square?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is my recollection. But that refreshes your\r\nrecollection in turning that, that was a prearranged meeting?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, all of these were, since there was no way over the\r\ntelephone.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is your recollection sufficiently refreshed to state\r\nwhether the meeting was a visit by you to her or she to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; I don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Does it have a relation to the letter that you say that you\r\nprepared dated April 7, which is the day before?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I might have taken it that day, I don't know. Yes; it is\r\nentirely possible. I hadn't thought about it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But anyhow my mentioning those two events together, does\r\nthat refresh your recollection or stimulate it more specifically on the\r\nsubject?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It does not. You have no recollection beyond the fact that\r\non April 8 you have an entry with the word \"Marina.\" Is that written in\r\nRussian?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The word \"Marina\" in Russian, it doesn't stimulate you in\r\nany respect, does not stimulate your recollection?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. At the time of the dinner at your home on April\r\n2, following that or during that time, do you recollect any discussion\r\nabout General Walker between your husband and Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; I don't recollect any such discussion.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That night?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. If there was any it would have had to have been in the\r\nliving room while I was talking to Marina in Russian in the kitchen. I\r\ndidn't hear any reference to it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You didn't hear any discussion that evening\r\nbetween your husband and Lee Oswald about General Walker?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did your husband ever tell you subsequently of any\r\nsuch discussion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't recall it. There was one reference, but that was\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That was later. Do you recall when?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. It would be the Friday after U.N. Day, October the 4th.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That was October 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And this was April 2d?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. 1963.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you recall any discussion of General Walker at all\r\nwith Marina or in the presence of Marina or with Lee Oswald or in his\r\npresence in your home or their home or even out in the parkway on the\r\nsubject of General Walker up to April 11, 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. None whatsoever?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Any discussion between yourself and your husband on that\r\nday?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; none that I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you subscribe to a newspaper?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. At that time I subscribed to the Irving local paper.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that an evening or a morning paper?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. At that time it was a morning paper.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Morning paper. Do you have a recollection of being aware in\r\nthe edition of April 11 of an attack on General Walker the night before?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is more likely that I heard it on television. I think I\r\nmust have heard it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have a television and a radio?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. We get news from the television.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you were aware of the attack on General Walker the\r\nevening of April 10. Did you see Marina Oswald on the 11th?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I can only guess so judging from these marks on my calendar.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. We would like your very best recollection, please, Mrs.\r\nPaine?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't recall; I just don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You just don't have any present recollection that you did\r\nsee her on the 11th or you didn't? You just have no--you are blank?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I can only guess from the calendar, that is all.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Other than that entry you have no recollection whatsoever?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. If you had seen her would it have been at her house, at her\r\napartment?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't even know that.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Wouldn't you have remembered four trips back and forth?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I remember that I made such trips, but which day it is, it\r\nis very difficult to know.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I see. But you think--have you had a recollection about\r\nseeing her at this time, without pinpointing it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there any discussion between you and Marina on the\r\nsubject of the General Walker incident?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. None whatsoever?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am trying to recall now when she first told me that Lee\r\nwas out of work. The next note I have of having seen them, and you must\r\nunderstand this calendar by no means tells everything I have done or\r\nwould even be accurate about what I have done on account of what has\r\nhappened, but at some point she told me that he was out of work.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was it some point near the time we are now discussing?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Near the time we are now discussing. I am trying to get\r\nsome content in order to answer the question of what happened, did I\r\nsee her, what happened. The next date I have down for seeing her is a\r\npicnic on the 20th of April.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had she told you----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't recall it having been that long, but it probably\r\nwas, between the 11th and the picnic. It was before the picnic she told\r\nthat he was out of work and had been for a few days before he told her.\r\n\r\nNow, you probably know when he was out of work, but I don't, when he\r\nlost his job. So I am judging that possibly this was mentioned on the\r\n11th that he was out of work, because we did plan to have a picnic on\r\nthe 20th which included Lee, but it could have been even that day that\r\nshe told me that he was out of work and had been for some time.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there any day on or about this time, the 10th or 11th\r\nor 12th, within those 3 days, that you saw Marina, where your attention\r\nwas arrested by her being upset or disturbed?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In any fashion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, I notice in your calendar and entry April 16, \"St.\r\nMarks open again 12 noon.\" Is that the school your children attend?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No, they are both preschool age. It must have been an\r\nEaster--my children are preschool age.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What was the occasion of your making that entry?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I probably wanted to visit the class.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What class?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. A language class. This is a school at which I subsequently\r\ntaught. Last summer I taught at St. Marks School.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You were visiting the class in advance of your teaching?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. So I probably wanted to visit--no, just any language class\r\nthere, and inquired, I judge, you see, you will find on Good Friday no\r\nschool, too, the 12th. So I was marking when the Easter vacation was\r\nfor St. Marks in order to make plans sometime later to go and visit.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Would you return to April 2, that dinner. Is\r\nthat entry \"dinner at 8\"? I couldn't quite figure out----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I believe that is the 7.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Seven. Was anything said that night about Lee Oswald's work?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; nothing.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. About his job?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, I asked him how could I reach them if I had to call\r\noff a get-together. I had no way of telephoning Marina. If the child\r\ngot sick how would I tell her I am not coming. So I said could I have\r\nhis telephone at work in order to reach them through him if I felt it\r\nnecessary some time, and he wrote down for me the address and telephone\r\nnumber of the place where he worked. This was on the 2d of April.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that, I will turn to that, if I might, and that will be\r\nCommission Exhibit 402, and we have a like photograph of the exhibit.\r\nIs all of that exhibit in your handwriting?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, I have just said he wrote down Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. There is one entry that is in his handwriting?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Give us the letter page of that, will you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The letter page, \"O\" for Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. \"O\" for Oswald. The entry Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall was\r\nwritten by Mr. Oswald; all other entries on that page are in your\r\nhandwriting; is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Are all other entries in the entire address book in your\r\nhandwriting?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Did we go over it? What did I say?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes, we did this morning.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I would guess so. I don't recall. Did we say so this\r\nmorning? I will have to look it over again.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am not permitted to testify, Mrs. Paine.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. All right. You want me to look right now? I usually write\r\nthe addresses down myself, so it would be quite unusual for someone\r\nelse to.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is this address book in the same condition now as it was\r\nwhen you gave it to the police?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I did not give it to the police, they took it, and I didn't\r\nknow it was gone until later that day. It is in the same condition\r\nexcept it has been through the finger-printing process.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am particularly interested----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; it is all in my handwriting.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am particularly interested in the entries on the page\r\nlettered \"O,\" and I want to especially ask you whether that page is in\r\nthe same condition now as it was when it was----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask the witness why there are certain lines half\r\nhorizontal, half perpendicular there, certain of these?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It means it is an old address, no longer applicable.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Dulles, you were referring to the page lettered \"O\"?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is correct; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I had digressed or interrupted at that point because you,\r\nfor the first time, made reference to an entry in your address book\r\nmade by Mr. Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, I offer in evidence the document identified as Exhibit\r\n401.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Where is that----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. 402 rather. That is the address book.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(Commission Exhibit No. 402 was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you were relating that you inquired as to how you could\r\nreach them if you had to reach them, and Mr. Lee Oswald wrote----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. His work, the name of the company and the telephone number.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I take it they did not have a telephone?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. They did not; no.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did they ever have a telephone even when they were in New\r\nOrleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; they did not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When they came back again to Dallas, they did not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. They did not.\r\n\r\n(At this point in the proceedings Senator Cooper left the Commission\r\nhearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, was the April 2d occasion the second time that you had\r\nseen Lee----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Oswald? You had not seen him in the interim?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When next did you see him?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I next saw him on the 20th of April at a picnic at a park\r\nnear where they lived on Neely Street.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In between certainly the 2d of April and, possibly, in that\r\nperiod from the 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th, let us take that period up,\r\nuntil the time of the 20th, did you see Marina Oswald in between?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Did you say between the 2d----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Between the 8th and 10th through the 20th.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I guess not; between the 11th or so and the 20th.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that your best recollection?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. So far as I know, no.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How did you communicate with her about the picnic?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Probably by letter.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. By a letter. Do you have that letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have--I don't know if I have it. I have a letter that\r\ncloses \"October 20th\" in my hand, a scratch note.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Could I look at that correspondence this evening?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. At the same time.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThen the next occasion was when you had the picnic on the 20th, is that\r\nright?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I notice in that entry what looks to me like \"Miss Mary\r\n7:15.\" What is the significance of that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is probably going out in the evening. It had no\r\nrelationship with the picnic at all. It has a relationship with a\r\ndinner group which is at the time, you see the line \"dinner group--7:15\r\nMiss Mary,\" who is a babysitter.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That entry has nothing to do with the Oswalds?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Without elaborating, please, Mrs. Paine, what would the\r\nsubjects of discussion between you and Marina and Mr. Oswald have been\r\nat the picnic?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. At the picnic?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He spent most of his time fishing. We saw almost nothing\r\nof him and heard virtually nothing from him. I was impressed with his\r\nunwillingness to be sociable really in this situation. He came to eat\r\nwhen it was time to, and complained about the food.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he complain about the food?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was your husband present at this picnic?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; he was not.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you supply the food?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; Marina had cooked it. He complained about it. He caught\r\na fish, as I recall, and took it home to be cleaned. I hardly know who\r\nwould clean it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Who did clean it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't know. I left about that time.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What discussion occurred between you and Lee Oswald, if\r\nany, with respect to his life in Russia on that occasion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. None.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you have any conversation with him other than some\r\npleasantries?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't believe so. I can't even think of the pleasantry.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. As I understand it, as you were sitting there, the picnic\r\ntook place in the park----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What was he doing?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He was way over at the lake fishing.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. He was over fishing at the lake?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did any further discussion occur between you and Marina on\r\nthat occasion, or on any interim occasion, of Mr. Oswald's desire to\r\nhave her return to Russia or the fact that she did not wish the Russian\r\nemigré group to know she was pregnant and was about to have a child?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't recall specifically. I did feel that it wasn't a\r\nparticularly happy occasion. I don't recall it with lightness.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was he out of work at that time or not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; he was out of work. I knew at that time he was out of\r\nwork. Whether I found out that morning or the previous time I had seen\r\nher I don't recall. I only recall when she said he was out of work she\r\nalso said he had been out of work for a week or a few days before he\r\ntold her.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I would like to have you draw on your recollection as\r\nclosely as you can. Did you learn of his being out of work from him or\r\nfrom Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. From her.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did she say on that subject as to whether he was\r\ndischarged or whether he had left his employment, or did she say\r\nanything in that area?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I judged he had been discharged.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Give me your best recollection of what she said.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Do you want something else?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Give me your best recollection of what she said, Mrs. Paine.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I can't recall it that closely.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You next have an entry on April 24 reading \"Lee and\r\nMarina.\" Do you find it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was that a meeting with Lee Harvey Oswald and his wife,\r\nMarina?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where was that held?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That was to be a visit at the apartment on Neely Street.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. At their apartment?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did it take place?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I arrived and found that he was packed to go to New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was this a surprise to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This was a distinct surprise.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had there been some communication between you and the\r\nOswalds about your visiting them on the 24th of April?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It had been arranged that I would come over to visit as\r\nmuch as these other visits had been arranged, just with Marina to talk.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had you had any visit with Marina between the 20th of April\r\nand the 24th?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. None whatsoever?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. None.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had you arranged on the 20th to visit on the 24th?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Probably.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is your best recollection?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What time of day did you arrive, or night?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Mid-morning, perhaps around 10.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And then you found him packed or packing to leave?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He was fully packed. I was evidently expected. I and my\r\ncar, because he asked if I could take these bags and duffel bags,\r\nsuitcases, to the bus station for him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Where he would buy a ticket to go to New Orleans, and he\r\nsaid he had not been able to----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What he said to you is what I am interested in.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That he said----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He said he had not been able to find work in Dallas, around\r\nDallas, and Marina suggested going to New Orleans, which is where he\r\nhad been born.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. He said she had suggested?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. That is my best recollection.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was Marina present now while he is relating this to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; I think so.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She was present. Was he speaking in Russian or in English?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think he must have been speaking in English when he asked\r\nme to take the things to the bus station and explained that he was\r\ngoing to look for work.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Your best recollection is that this was in English?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't recall. It could well have been in Russian also. He\r\ndidn't like to speak English to me. He preferred to speak Russian.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. To you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. To me; yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did he ever indicate why?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I think you said to me this morning, and please correct me\r\nif my recollection is not good, that he always spoke to you in Russian.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. With, perhaps, a couple of rare exceptions, yes, he spoke\r\nto me in Russian. When I tried to teach him to drive I tried to explain\r\nto him, proceeded to explain to him in English.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me, you tried to teach him to do what?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. To drive. This is later.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Drive, yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. But he would answer me in Russian, which is a way of\r\ngetting the person to go back to Russian. But I couldn't explain\r\ndriving in Russian, so I did it in English.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That incident, Mrs. Paine, is very important, and we will\r\nget to that at a later stage as to your efforts to teach him to drive.\r\n\r\nGoing back to this 24th of April, there was here, this was, a complete\r\nsurprise to you. You arrived at the home and this man was all packed to\r\ngo to New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had you had any discussion with Marina about her coming to\r\nlive with you of which she was aware prior to this occasion on April 24?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I had discussed with her the possibility of her coming at\r\nthe time the baby was expected.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When was the baby expected?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Mid-October.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But there had been no discussion up to April 24, to your\r\nrecollection, even about your inviting Marina to come to live with you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. You mean on a more permanent basis, other than to stay when\r\nthe baby was due?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes; which would be in the fall of the year.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right. There was none.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. There was no discussion about her coming to live with you\r\nin the spring around about this time?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I remember feeling when I arrived that they were, and\r\nprobably appropriately, making their own plans, and wondering whether I\r\nshould have already made this invitation, but I had not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You say they were already making their own plans; are you\r\nseeking to imply that they had some notion she might join you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; I don't think there was any notion. I am trying to say\r\nI recall that I hadn't made that invitation at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. To the best of your recollection it is now that you had not\r\ndiscussed the subject with Marina up to this occasion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Not the subject of staying on with me as an alternative to\r\ngoing back to Russia.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Only staying with you in the fall?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When the baby came?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did you say, Mrs. Paine--excuse me. First, have you\r\nexhausted your recollection of everything that Lee Oswald said on that\r\noccasion when you arrived there?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did you say?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I said, yes, I would take his bags to the station if he\r\nwanted me to.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And we then did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You just left?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Take them to the bus station to be checked.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did Marina accompany you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Marina went, and he checked the baggage. It was rather more\r\nthan he could have carried on the city bus, and I am sure he preferred\r\nme to a taxi because I don't cost as much.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You didn't cost anything?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right. And he then bought a ticket, he bought a\r\nticket for Marina, I mean I was thinking, while he was in the bus\r\nstation, and suggested that it would be a very difficult thing for a\r\npregnant woman with a small child to take a 12-hour, 13-hour bus trip\r\nto New Orleans, and suggested that I drive her down with June.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You volunteered this?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I volunteered this, and suggested further that instead of\r\nher staying at her--at the apartment, as was planned at that time,\r\nwhile waiting to hear from him, that she come and stay at my house\r\nwhere he would reach us by phone, and where she would have someone else\r\nwith her while she waited to hear if he got work.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This was the conversation between you and Lee Harvey\r\nOswald? Was it in English or in Russian?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Probably in Russian. I would think so, because I wanted her\r\nto understand.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was Marina along?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She was present.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She was present; I see.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This took place where, in the car?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Probably in the bus station--in the car near the bus\r\nstation. He then took the bus ticket back, returned it, and got the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Ticket for her?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Ticket for her.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Her bus ticket?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; and he left some money for her for buying things in\r\nthe next few days before she could join him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he get on the bus then and depart?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; the bus left in the evening. We all drove back to the\r\napartment after he had checked the baggage, and he helped load the baby\r\nthings and things that Marina would need during the next few days into\r\nmy car, and we emptied what was left there of the things that were in\r\nthe apartment, and which belonged to them, and then drove, I drove with\r\nMarina and June and my two children back to my house, and he stayed\r\nat the apartment. He was scheduled to leave by bus, city bus, and an\r\ninterstate bus that evening.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I take it then, Mrs. Paine, that your impression was that\r\nit was contemplated, when you arrived at the Oswalds that morning, that\r\nMrs. Oswald, Marina, and her child June, and her husband, Lee, were\r\ncontemplating going to New Orleans together that day?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Am I wrong?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is wrong. She was to have stayed in the apartment.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And wait to hear from him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. If they had been going together that would not have been\r\nthe hardship on her, but that traveling alone was, I felt.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Why did he buy the ticket for her at the----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. To leave with her so that she could follow him when he\r\ncalled, to leave the ticket in her hand as a means of her following\r\nhim. I haven't been clear.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It was a little indefinite.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I thought the ticket had been redeemed; then he bought\r\nanother ticket?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He bought a ticket for himself and a ticket for her.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You said, \"I will take her,\" and then he redeemed the\r\nticket for her, and gave her the cash?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Gave her some money?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. But the ticket that he did buy for her----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Was to have been left with her.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Was for a subsequent date?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. For a subsequent date following.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That was clear to you on that occasion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That was clear.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She was scheduled to join him subsequently?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She was scheduled to join him subsequently if he did find\r\nwork. If he found no work there would have been no point to her making\r\nthe trip.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is this a discussion or is it your rationalization?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was clearly said she would stay.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I am puzzled. I am puzzled, Mr. Jenner, about this ticket\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am, too.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. A ticket was bought for her on the theory that she was\r\ngoing with him first.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That is where I got off the track. He bought two tickets,\r\nthen why was the ticket redeemed?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Because it was made clear by Mrs. Paine that she was going\r\nto take Marina down in her own car.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But only going to stay with you during the period until he\r\ngot work, hence she wouldn't need a ticket. You were going to drive her\r\ndown?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You would drive her down all the way to New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. In either case it was planned to delay going.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. She would go down if he got work, but she would not need a\r\nticket if she stayed with you. Therefore, the ticket was redeemed.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. But I did not think of this or suggest it until after\r\nhe had already bought the ticket.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. May I ask this, Mrs. Paine? In the things that\r\nwere packed when you arrived, or things that were packed while you were\r\npresent----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Nothing was packed while I was present. It was already\r\npacked.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Everything was already packed by the time you got\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Were any of the things for Marina or Lee packed?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. They were all packed. I don't understand your question.\r\nAll of the things he wanted to take with him to the bus station were\r\nalready packed.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Well, in that group of things which were so\r\npacked, were there things for Marina and Lee?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I mean Marina and June, excuse me?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. Some of their things were among those things, yes, I\r\njudge so, clothing. The things that remained were a crib, playpen, baby\r\nstroller, some dishes, some clothing.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The things you would not ordinarily take on a bus,\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; it would be very difficult. That was another one of\r\nthe things that motivated me to suggest driving her down. I thought\r\nsending these by train, with the risk of their getting strayed or--it\r\nwould be difficult, trying, for her to try to handle them, or convey\r\nthem with her by bus--that would have been worse.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. But there were some things that were packed in the\r\nthings that Lee was going to take with him that would include things----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That belonged to----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. To--to Marina and to June?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I would judge so simply by what remained. Surely it was not\r\nthe total sum of her clothing and June's clothing.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Which could lead a person to the conclusion that\r\nat one stage of their discussion Marina was going to accompany Lee to\r\nNew Orleans.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Not from the time I arrived.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. From the station.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was clear she would stay up in the apartment.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Up to that time it appeared to you from what was in the\r\nduffelbag----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think he was carrying all he could to lighten her burden.\r\nIn other words, if and when she followed, he was carrying all he could.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Representative Ford is interested in this, Mrs. Paine----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I am puzzled, too.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you arrived at the Oswald apartment that morning, Lee\r\nOswald had duffelbags packed and some----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Suitcases.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Suitcases. He had in those suitcases and in the duffelbag\r\nsome of the apparel for Mrs.--Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Of course, I did not see it. I have to guess what was in it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But, from your knowledge of the household and afterwards,\r\nthis was at least your impression?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That they must have included some of her things.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes. Which, in turn, might lead to the inference that,\r\ntherefore, they contemplated at that moment from what he was taking\r\nthat Marina was ultimately to join him in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Oh, yes; absolutely.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. Was that your question?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Or even at one point in the process of packing,\r\nshe and June were going to accompany him to New Orleans on the bus.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I didn't have that impression, no. No, he was going and\r\nhappened to stay with an aunt and uncle where he could live without\r\nmuch charge. For her to come would have been quite a greater expense,\r\nand a risky one without a job, nothing coming in, so he was hoping that\r\nhe could stay with the aunt and uncle while he looked, and then if he\r\ngot remunerative work, get an apartment and call her to come, too.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. If that is so, and let us assume that is so----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It puzzles me that he went into the bus station\r\nand bought two tickets, one for himself and one for her.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. How would she get there?\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Well, eventually she might have to go by bus. But\r\nwhy should he at this time make an investment in a bus ticket when\r\nthere was no certainty----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. When she might follow? This is what puzzles me.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. Well, I can only guess about this. I judge from his\r\nhaving done this that he certainly intended for her to follow, and it\r\nis also possible she couldn't have asked for a bus ticket herself.\r\nIf he had written her and said, \"Don't come to New Orleans, come to\r\nNashville,\" and he had said, \"That is where I have got my job,\" he\r\nmight have felt she would not know how to go and get such a bus ticket.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Is it also possible he may not have wanted to leave that\r\namount of money with her to buy a ticket and preferred to leave her a\r\nticket rather than cash?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This is possible, this is possible.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right.\r\n\r\nNow, Mrs. Paine, in light of that speculation, tell us what discussion\r\nthere was on the subject.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think I have, that while he was in the bus station I\r\nthought how difficult it would be for her to travel alone with the\r\nbaby, and all the things----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you raised that yourself for the first time at that\r\npoint?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Then I said she might stay with me while waiting to hear\r\nfrom him, and that I would drive her down if we did hear that he had\r\ngotten work.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had there been prior discussion that it was contemplated\r\nthat, if he obtained a position, she would join him in New Orleans, or\r\nwherever he obtained a position.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. We had already talked about that at the apartment.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that had been discussed with her present?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And discussed in Russian so that she could have understood\r\nthe discussion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. To the best of my recollection, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, Mrs. Paine, the staff is interested in Lee Harvey\r\nOswald's luggage.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. What?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. His luggage.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Luggage.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you please, to the best of your recollection, tell us\r\nwhat pieces of luggage he had on that occasion, what they looked like,\r\ntheir shape and form?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. He had two large marine duffelbags with his name on\r\nthem, and probably his Marine serial number. It was marked with a good\r\ndeal of white paint. It stood quite high.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were they up-ended when you say high? You mean standing on\r\nend, they were high?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Standing on their end they would come well above this table.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. About 40 inches?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Something like that; I would guess so.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me, I am interested in just that. Would you go over\r\nto the drawing board and move your hand, judge from the floor, and stop\r\nright there? We will measure that later.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Understand I saw those two later in my garage.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I understand, and I will get to that. That is just about 45\r\ninches, and there were two of them?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There were two of them. Do you want anything about the rest\r\nof the luggage? Does that interest you the most?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes, I am interested, and I would like to stick with\r\nthe duffelbags for a moment. Was there any appearance as to either\r\nduffelbag, which, to you, would indicate some long, slim, hard----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I assume them to be both full of clothes, very rounded.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I don't wish to be persistent, but was there anything that\r\nyou saw about the duffelbags that lead you at that time to even think\r\nfor an instant that there was anything long, slim and hard like a pole?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Or a gun, a rifle?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. No? Nothing?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Nothing. I did not move these bags.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. To the extent you saw them is all I am inquiring about. You\r\ndid not touch them, you did not lift them, but you saw them.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. There appeared--the entire circumference of these bags\r\nwhich you could see was smooth?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, smooth, bumpy, but irregular.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But no stick, no hard surface. Now, what about the diameter\r\nof these bags, these duffelbags, what would you say it was?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. About like this, 15, 18, 20 inches across.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Eighteen, twenty inches across?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Probably more than that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This is 15 inches.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. About like this; a little more than 15, probably.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. About 18 inches. Now, how many pieces of luggage in\r\naddition to the two duffelbags?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Quite a few. There were probably three suitcases.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Three suitcases?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Or more. A small radio bought in Russia.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I want to stick with the luggage.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Three suitcases?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think so, two or three, and a large softsided suitcase, I\r\ndon't know what to call it. It zips around the side.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Zipper case?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes, made of canvas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. We would like to have you describe that zipper case.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is green----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am interrupting you, I am sorry. Were there any other\r\npieces of luggage, first?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So there were two or three or possibly four, is that true,\r\nsuitcases?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And there was a zipper case?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Describe this zipper case to us first.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It stood about so high [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So high is 15 inches, about 30 inches long?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Not quite, about that long [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It was a generous sized zipper case?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. With generally green canvas and leather, dark-colored\r\nleather.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Black or brown--do you remember the color?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Dark brown, I guess, or black, certainly very dark.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It was a generous sized one, was it not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did it appear to be well packed?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you describe each of the three suitcases now, with\r\nparticular reference to the staff being interested in whether they were\r\nrectangular, whether they were hard boarded types of things, or whether\r\nthey were canvas or soft?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't remember how many there were. I recall they had a\r\nhard composition kind of suitcase such as you don't buy here, and I\r\njudge they were bought in the Soviet Union. I think there may have been\r\ntwo of those.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was any one of them rectangular in shape?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. That was rectangular.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The one you specifically have in mind, he did have a\r\nrectangular one?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And what color was it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Dark, blackish green, or dark brown, something of this\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Anything else you can think about it in the way of\r\ndescription?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think it had--it was reinforced, corners, with rivets, or\r\nbolts, of something to hold it, hold the corners on it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. How long was this rectangular suitcase?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't recall. In fact, I can't recall whether it was one\r\nor two, but something like that, normal suitcases.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chairman, may I have your permission to approach the\r\nwitness?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. And take the measurements?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And take the measurements.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. The witness may be approached.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That or larger, I would say.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are now describing the length of the rectangular\r\nsuitcase, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that would be 21-1/2 inches?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is your best recollection?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am brief in my recollection, a normal rectangular shape\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Width, that is the side, you mean?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is the whole thing. That is looking at the top. How\r\nhigh it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. No; wide.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am filling it out. This would be the width then from here\r\nto here, possibly more.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Fourteen inches?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am not sure I am recalling one or two at the same time. I\r\nhave to be under oath, and giving you details on things I don't recall\r\nthat well.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All we are seeking is your best recollection.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. All right, that is my best recollection.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Twenty-one and a half times fourteen, and how high was it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. About so, 6, about 6.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I said high. Was this lying flat on its side when you saw\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, all these things again I saw in the fall, so it is a\r\nmixed recollection.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am going to get as to what you saw in the fall, but it is\r\nimportant to us as to what you saw on this occasion.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, I particularly recall the duffels because they are\r\nunusual, and I recall this bag being, I judge Russian make rather than\r\nAmerican, it was a large zipper bag.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And Mrs. Paine, you do recall that zipper bag on this\r\noccasion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And there was at least one, if not more than one,\r\nrectangular----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I can't be certain of the zipper bag.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Hard-sided suitcase?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; hard-sided suitcase. I can't be certain, absolutely\r\ncertain, of the zipper bag. I recall seeing so much of it since,\r\ntripped over it numerous times, that it may be just that I recalled it.\r\nI didn't move this luggage at all.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am not suggesting that you did.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am sorry I can't remember it better.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were all of these suitcases about the same size and shape?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have described the rectangular one. Would you now\r\ndescribe the second, the second in order of your recollection?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, there was at least another rectangular one.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Hard-sided?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was it larger or smaller than the one you have described?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't recall with certainty.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there a third?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There may have been a third. I certainly recall this radio\r\nthat was unusual. The others I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is possible you might be confused between the radio case\r\nand a suitcase.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No, no; no possibility of that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. He checked all these articles, checked them into\r\nthe bus station?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And did you and Lee and Marina return to their home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you remain there?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No. He then helped pack up the remaining things, the\r\nplaypen, the bed, and then we left there midafternoon, perhaps 4, all\r\nof this must have taken quite a long time, because----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. They removed everything from their home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. They removed everything that remained to them.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Put it in the station wagon?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Put it in the station wagon and went with Lee and Marina.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Your station wagon was big enough to hold everything in the\r\nhouse, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, they had no furniture, but it held all the rest of\r\ntheir things; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he do the packing?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What were you doing in the meantime?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Packing was haphazard, this packing was haphazard; put the\r\ndishes in a box and carried it out to the car.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It was in the open so you could see what went into your car?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think so. I certainly then repacked it to go to New\r\nOrleans.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Well, I want to stick with this occasion, please.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there a rifle packed in the back of the car?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You didn't see any kind of weapon?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Firearm, rifle, pistol, or otherwise?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; I saw nothing of that nature.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you drive them to your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were the materials and things in your station wagon\r\nunpacked and placed in your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; immediately.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you see that being done, were you present?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I helped do it; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you see any weapon on that occasion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Whether a rifle, pistol or----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Or any covering, any package, that looked as though it\r\nmight have a weapon, pistol, or firearm?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Up to this moment, Mrs. Paine, had there been any\r\ndiscussion with Marina or with Lee Harvey Oswald in connection with his\r\nlife in Russia with the use of a firearm or his right to use one in\r\nRussia?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I never heard him mention anything of this sort. Michael\r\ntold me later he mentioned it to Michael.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. State that, please.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Michael told me later that Lee had complained in Michael's\r\nhearing that they did not permit a private individual to have a gun,\r\nbut I didn't hear that when it was said. So there was no discussion at\r\nany time that mentioned guns, nothing brought up by Marina or Lee.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I will broaden my question. Up to--now up to, and not\r\nincluding, up to November 22, 1963, had there ever been any discussion\r\nbetween you and Lee Harvey Oswald or between you and Marina or any\r\ndiscussion in the presence of either of them by anybody, including\r\nyourself, about the use of a firearm by Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. Marina told me that he had been hunting in the Soviet\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, please, to the best of your recollection when did that\r\noccur?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. When did she tell me?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It might have been as long ago as May, when she was first\r\nstaying at my house. She quoted a proverb to the effect that you go\r\nhunting in the Soviet Union and you catch a bottle of vodka, so I judge\r\nit was a social occasion more than shooting being the prime object.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That was in this period when she was living with you in the\r\nspring of 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It could have been there. It might have been in October,\r\nbut I would guess it was in May.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I wish you would elaborate on that.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I wish I wouldn't guess, I know.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did she say that Lee Harvey Oswald had some kind of a\r\nfirearm in Russia?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That he had gone hunting with a group, in other words, in\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What was the occasion----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And she quoted this proverb.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Can you remember the circumstance in which she made that\r\nutterance?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Anything that provoked it or brought it about?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think she was probably recalling something of their life\r\nin Russia.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In a discussion between you and Marina as to their life in\r\nRussia?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Any other occasion in which a discussion occurred between\r\nyou and either of them or in their presence while you were present on\r\nthe subject of a firearm prior to November 22?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. On one occasion around the middle of November I said to\r\nMarina that----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was Lee Harvey Oswald present?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He was not present.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Just Marina and you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Just Marina and I.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was it in your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. I said to her that I did not want to buy toy guns for\r\nmy children, and that this view of things was shared with a German\r\nfriend of mine who had been a young girl at the time of the last World\r\nWar in Germany, and she didn't wish to buy guns for her children to\r\nplay with, and I said too few people think about this. She said nothing\r\nin reply.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She didn't say anything at all in response to that. Does\r\nthat exhaust your recollection of all discussion of firearms?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; it does.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That occurred in your presence?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Up to November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Up to, that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. There was no suggestion of Lee's using a firearm for\r\nhunting purposes in the United States?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. None; nor that he might have had any gun.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Nor that he might have had any gun.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. After Marina's things and the baby's things had been placed\r\nin your home then what occurred in the evening, was this late in the\r\nday of the 24th?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was close to supper. I am sure we then ate and put our\r\nchildren to bed, possibly talked a short time. I no doubt explained\r\nto her quite soon that I was to go away for the weekend. Indeed, this\r\ninvitation was made quite on the spur of the moment. You don't normally\r\ninvite someone to come and stay with you when you are about to go away,\r\nbut I was to go to a folk-dance camp with Michael that weekend, and you\r\nsee on the calendar \"FDC\" which stands for folk-dance camp, arrow San\r\nAntonio. That is the 26th, 27th and 28th.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes; I noticed that.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And I left her in the house with the telephone number of\r\nmy Russian tutor to call, and I believe they talked, in fact, before I\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you tell us the name of your Russian tutor.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could I ask one question that we passed by?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. When you unloaded Marina's things and the baby's things,\r\ndid this subtract one suitcase from this number you have indicated? Was\r\none of the suitcases delegated to her things or were they just loose in\r\nthe car?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Insofar as I remember, I believe they were loose.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. They were loose. So that the number of suitcases you have\r\nindicated were those that were eventually checked and taken by Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald to New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, that is the way I remember it. It does not seem\r\nreasonable that he would go off without leaving her a suitcase to put\r\nher things in, so I would guess there was something for her in the\r\nnature, perhaps, of a small bag.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. So that one of these bags may have been unloaded at your\r\nhouse?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. You testified, I believe, you started to testify, that\r\nthere was also a radio that had been presumably purchased in Russia.\r\nDid he take that with him?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He took that.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. He took that with him. He didn't return that to her.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mrs. Paine, I don't want to speculate, but I thought you\r\nhad testified in response to my questions that the two or three pieces\r\nof luggage, that is, the suitcases, plus the two duffel bags, plus the\r\nzipper bag, plus the radio, had been checked into the bus station.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; that is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All of those pieces of luggage were actually checked in,\r\nand when you left the bus station none of the pieces of luggage or the\r\nradio or the duffel bags had been placed back in your car.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't recall it, but it seems to me unreasonable----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, please, I don't want you to rationalize. I want your\r\nbest recollection.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I cannot recall. I mean the suitcases that came to my\r\nhouse----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You don't recall having taken one of the pieces of luggage\r\nand placed that piece back in your station wagon?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Oh, no, no, that is definite. All that went to the bus\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Remained there.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Remained there.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. At what stage did they go to the bus station? Did you go\r\nfrom their apartment to your house and then to the bus station or did\r\nyou go to the bus station first?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Directly to the bus station.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And then went to your house?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Directly to the bus station from their apartment, back to\r\ntheir apartment and picked up the rest of the things.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I see.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The baby things and her clothing and then went to my house.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mrs. Paine, apart from your rationalization, do you have\r\nthe recollection that there was any luggage at all in the Oswald home\r\nwhen you got back?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; I have no such recollection.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So that in response to Mr. Dulles' questions when you\r\ntalked about the possibility of some luggage, you were rationalizing?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are not drawing on your recollection?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I take it your best recollection, in fact, is that there\r\nwas no luggage remaining at the Oswald home when you got back?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There was nothing packed when we got back.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you recall undertaking to pack anything when you got\r\nback in order to remove what they had there remaining to your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. You mean was there a suitcase into which I could pack\r\nanything?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is it.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Now, you have related to us that you went away\r\nfor the weekend.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. With your husband.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, you have an entry in your diary, and I quote it on the\r\n24th of April, 1963: \"Lee and Marina.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was that an entry made after the fact?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; I judge that was----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, please give me your best recollection.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That was the plan to meet, knowing Lee was no longer\r\nworking; it was there for not only a meeting with Marina, but I\r\nexpected to see them both at the apartment.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So that is confined to the meeting you expected to have\r\nwith Lee and Marina that morning when you went there and, to your\r\nsurprise, you found that Mr. Oswald was all packed to go to New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. All packed and looking for a cab; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How long did Marina remain in your home on that occasion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She stayed then until May 9--well, excuse me, she stayed\r\nuntil the 10th of May.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have an entry, do you not, in your diary as to the May\r\n9th or 10th.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Read it.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It says now going over to the 11th \"New Orleans.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you have written across then \"May 10 and May 11,\" is\r\nthat right?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What does the \"New Orleans\" signify, please?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Lee called on the evening of the 9th to say he had work.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You recall that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I recall that definitely. Marina says, \"Papa naslubet,\"\r\n\"Father loves us,\" \"Daddy loves us, he got work and he wanted us to\r\ncome.\" She was very elated.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This is Marina talking to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I could see as she talked on the phone.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You overheard this conversation?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Afterward. She said over and over, \"Papa naslubet,\" \"Daddy\r\nloves us,\" \"Daddy loves us.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She was elated?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She was elated and, let's see, we tried to think when we\r\ncould leave, and first said over the phone that we would leave on the\r\nmorning of the 11th. But I thought it would be too long to do all this\r\nin one day, and we accelerated our preparations and left midday on the\r\n10th which got us to Shreveport.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Before we get into this, and I would like to cover this\r\ninterim period before any adjournment today; there was a 16-day period\r\nnow, approximately, maybe we will limit it to 15 days, that Marina\r\nstayed with you in your home.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you have conversations with her about her husband?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. About their life in Russia?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, even going so far as to wonder----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. During this 15-day period?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. We had such conversations.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you please relate to us your discussions with Marina\r\nwith respect to her husband Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, she wondered if he did, in fact, love her.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did she say?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She said she supposed most couples had at some time\r\nwondered about this. She wondered herself whether she loved him truly.\r\nShe talked some of her few months of dating that she had in Minsk, and\r\nof living there.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is before her marriage to Lee Harvey?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. At some point, and I want to tell you this, whether\r\nit is appropriate or whether it happened later in October, I can't be\r\ncertain, but I think in May she told me that she had written a letter\r\nto a previous boyfriend, and that this letter had come back because she\r\nhad put insufficient postage on it, and Lee had found it at the door\r\ncoming back through the mail, and had been very angry.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did she go beyond that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She did not. To tell me what was in the letter, you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am not thinking so much within the letter. Did she go\r\nbeyond stating that he was merely only angry? Was there any discussion\r\nabout his having struck her?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; none. No; none. She never mentioned to me ever that Lee\r\nhad struck her.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And during all the visits you ever had with her, all the\r\ntete-a-tetes, her living with you on this occasion we now describe as\r\n15-1/2 days, and in the fall, was there any occasion when Marina Oswald\r\nrelated to you any abuse, physical abuse, by her husband, Lee Harvey\r\nOswald, with respect to her?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There was never any such occasion.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Never any such occasion. And in particular this incident?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She related this incident, but it did not include anything\r\nfurther than he had been very angry and hurt.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Up to this time, that is, the time she came to you on the\r\n24th, had you ever seen any bruises----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; I never saw her----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On her person?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; I never saw her bruised.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. At no time that you have ever seen her or known her, have\r\nyou ever seen her bruised?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. At no time.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So that there has been no occasion when you have seen it,\r\nor been led to believe, she had been subjected to any physical abuse by\r\nher husband?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there any discussion during these 15 days of any\r\noccasion when Marina had gone off to live with someone else?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No. I think she told me that in the fall.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. As long as I have raised that, would you please give\r\nus the time and the occasions and tell us what occurred?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. What she told me?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What she said. When was this?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This probably was in October. She told me that the previous\r\nyear she had----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. 1962?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. She had in the fall, she had gone to a friend's home,\r\nleft Lee. She described his face as she left, as shocked and dismayed\r\nand unbelieving.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Unbelieving?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. In a sense that she was truly walking out on him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes. Excuse me. Did she put it in those terms, that she was\r\nleaving?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She was leaving; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She left him?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; and went to stay with a friend. Then moved to the\r\nhome----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did she name the friend?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She did not name the friend; no. The friend's name came up\r\nin another connection, but I had no way of making the connection until\r\nafter I learned about this to whom she referred.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you now recall the name?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She went to Katya Ford's.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. To the Fords?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. To Katya, being the friend, Mrs. Ford.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mrs. Ford.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And then moved. She did tell me this. She had moved on the\r\nweekend to a different home. Then Lee came there, pleaded for her to\r\ncome back, promised that everything would be different. She went back\r\nand she reported--as she reported it to me, things were no different.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were not different?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Were not different.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you undertake a discussion with her as to what the\r\nthings were that were disturbing her?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That offended her that much? No; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That led her to leave her husband?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. There was no discussion of that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Did you ever witness any altercations?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Indeed I saw them argue a good deal.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Sharp arguments?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. But no violence of any kind?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No physical violence.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Any profanity?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am not sure I know Russian profanity. He was very curt\r\nand told her to shut up quite a great deal.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In your presence?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In the presence of others?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Particularly in New Orleans the first time when we went\r\ndown, when I took her to New Orleans in May, he was very discourteous\r\nto her, and they argued most of that weekend. I was very uncomfortable\r\nin that situation, and he would tell her to shut up, tell her, \"I said\r\nit, and that is all the discussion on the subject.\"\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What were the kinds of discussions that prompted\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I can't recall that, and I have already had my brain\r\npicked trying to, with other people trying to, to recall what was the\r\ndifficulty. I do recall feeling that the immediate things they were\r\ntalking about were insufficient reason for that much feeling being\r\npassed back and forth, and I wondered if I wasn't adding to the strain\r\nin the situation, and did my best to get back to Texas directly. But\r\nthe--well, I do recall one thing, yes--we arrived with a big load of\r\nblackberries that we bought from a vendor along the street.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. On the way down?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. On the way down, on the road, and ate them, and then,\r\nhe, one morning, started to make blackberry wine, and she bawled him\r\nout for it, what a waste of good blackberries, and she said, \"What\r\ndo you think you are doing? Ruining all this.\" And he proceeded, and\r\nargued about it, but thought he should, you know, defend himself. On\r\nthis occasion she was making the attack in a sense and didn't think\r\nhe should do it this way, and then, so, under fire and attack, he\r\ncontinued. But then the next day she observed that he had tossed it all\r\nout and lost heart after the argument, and decided it wasn't----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. He tossed out the wine?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He tossed it out; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You detected, then, irritability as between them. Is that a\r\nfair statement?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is accurate.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And anger rose to the surface pretty easily?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Very easily.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What was your impression? Of course he hadn't seen her then\r\nfor a couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Tell us about it--when she came in. Did they embrace?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. We arrived at his uncle's in one section of New\r\nOrleans, and had a very friendly half hour or so----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was he there?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; he was there. He introduced her and little June, and\r\nplayed with June, on his shoulders, perhaps. At any rate, he was very\r\nglad to see the baby, and was congenial and outgoing. We talked with\r\nthe relatives for a short time.\r\n\r\nThen the uncle drove them to the apartment--I was following with my\r\nchildren in my car--drove to the apartment he had rented, which was in\r\na different section of the city. And Lee showed her, of course, all\r\nthe virtues of the apartment that he had rented. He was pleased that\r\nthere was room enough, it was large enough that he could invite me to\r\nstay, and the children, to spend the night there. And he pointed out\r\nthis little courtyard with grass, and fresh strawberries ready to pick,\r\nwhere June could play. And a screened porch entryway. And quite a large\r\nliving room. And he was pleased with the furniture and how the landlady\r\nhad said this was early New Orleans style. And Marina was definitely\r\nnot as pleased as he had hoped. I think he felt--he wanted to please\r\nher. This showed in him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Tell us what she said. What led you to that conclusion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She said it is dark, and it is not very clean. She thought\r\nthe courtyard was nice, a grass spot where June could play, fenced in.\r\nBut there was very little ventilation. We immediately were aware there\r\nwere a lot of cockroaches.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was she aware of this, and did she comment on that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't know as anything was said. He was pretty busy\r\nexplaining. He was doing his best to get rid of them. But they didn't\r\nsubside. I remember noticing that he was tender and vulnerable at that\r\npoint, when she arrived.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He was tender?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Hoping for--particularly vulnerable, hoping for approval\r\nfrom her, which she didn't give. It wasn't a terribly nice apartment.\r\nAnd she had been disappointed, because when we first arrived she\r\nthought that the home we were going to was the apartment.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She thought the Murrets' home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. So when we came up to the Murrets' home, she said,\r\n\"This is lovely, how pleased I am.\" So that she was in--disappointed by\r\ncontrast with the apartment that she really had to live in.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. She expressed this?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She expressed her disappointment; yes; and didn't meet his\r\nhopes to be pleased with it.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. As compared with their previous place of residence, how was\r\nthe New Orleans apartment? It was bigger, I gather.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was larger. It was darker, less well ventilated. It\r\nwas on the first floor, the other was upstairs. I would say they were\r\ncomparable in cost and in attractiveness.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What about vermin?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I didn't see any vermin at the first place. But then I\r\ndidn't spend the night there.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So the welcoming was cordial?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The welcoming was cordial.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. They seemed to have a fine relationship at that moment?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But as the weekend progressed, and she saw the new\r\napartment, all the time you were there, you were aware of friction and\r\nirritability?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Going back to the 15 days again, was there any discussion\r\nduring this period, again, on the subject of Mr.--of Lee Oswald wishing\r\nMarina to return to Russia?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I believe I made definite, but only verbal, an invitation\r\nfor her to stay on with me, past the time of the baby's birth, if she\r\nwished to.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I take it--I will get into that. But I take it your answer\r\nto my question first is yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, tell us what that discussion was.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And how it arose.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, we still discussed the possibility of her coming back\r\nto have the baby here--although by no means a definite--definitely\r\nplanned.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me. I am a little confused. When you say coming back\r\nto have the baby here----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was assumed she would go to New Orleans when he called,\r\nbut we talked about the possibility of her coming back to Dallas. I\r\nsaid she was still welcome to if she wants to, if it seems appropriate,\r\nto come here to have the baby.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. That was to your house, you mean?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; to stay at my house before, or especially right after\r\nthe baby's birth, where I could look after June while she was in the\r\nhospital and later. June didn't take readily to strangers. She did\r\nlike me and was comfortable with me, so I felt she might want to have\r\nsomeone she knew and got along with.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But in this connection, was there a discussion between\r\nyou and Marina Oswald subject to her husband wishing her to return to\r\nRussia?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't believe she again said that he was after her to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Well, then, on the whole, your answer to my question would\r\nbe no.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right. As far as I recall, it came up only once in\r\nour discussions prior to New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which you have already related?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there any discussion during the 15-day period on the\r\nsubject of her acquiring greater facility with the English language?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And his attitude toward that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. His attitude had already been discussed, and I don't\r\nbelieve it was particularly discussed further. But she did indicate\r\nthat she was going to try to learn some anyway.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Despite that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I judged so. I asked if she had a book written in Russian\r\nentitled \"The Self Teacher in the English Language.\" She did not.\r\nAnd I ordered it. And I think I gave it to her even then. I am quite\r\ncertain of that. This turned out to be not much help. At least she was\r\ninterested in trying to learn English.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there any discussion of the subject of it being\r\ndisclosed to the Russian emigré group that she was pregnant.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; she continued to ask me not to mention that. We did,\r\nhowever, meet someone in the Russian emigré group in Fort Worth after\r\nshe had the first day put on maternity clothes--and so she was sorry\r\nthat that meeting had occurred. She judged now people would know.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Did anything else occur in the way of\r\ndiscussions during that 15-day period on the subject of life in Russia,\r\nhis political philosophy, how they got along, his general disposition,\r\nher reaction to America?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She discussed her reaction to America. She was very\r\nimpressed with the variety of goods available in the stores. She\r\nthought the quality was better here than in Russia. Then there was more\r\nof that later in October.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I will get to that, in October. Have we pretty well\r\nexhausted this 15-day interim period, then?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Jenner, may I ask a question there? During\r\nthis 15-day period, did any individual, male or female, come and visit\r\nyou at your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. You mean particularly to see her? I am sure there are\r\npeople coming and going at my house. There must have been. For\r\ninstance, May 1, Mary--this is again Miss Mary referred to previously,\r\na babysitter, \"8:15. War and Peace.\" Mary came and stayed with my\r\nchildren, and Marina and June and I went to see War and Peace. Miss\r\nMary recalls that meeting.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that a play or the movie?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This is the movie, War and Peace, in English. But, of\r\ncourse, she knew the story, so she could enjoy seeing it. \"Ed tennis\r\nconfirm.\" I went over to play tennis. On the fourth of May, Craig's\r\nchildren--they came here.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Into your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Probably.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Who is Craig?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Craig is this young German woman who didn't want to buy\r\nguns for her children either, that I mentioned. And we exchanged\r\nchildren often.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Does she speak Russian?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; German only, and English. And, mow the lawn, it says\r\non the third, but that is not me, it is a neighbor who mows the lawn.\r\nAnd May 9 in the morning, \"Ilse\"--means Mrs. Craig again--kept my\r\nchildren while I went at 8:10 to Saint Marks for an interview. So there\r\nwas a normal flow. And I told my immediate neighbor, Mrs. Roberts, who\r\nfigures later, that Marina was there over the weekend, that I wouldn't\r\nbe there, and introduced them, so Marina could go to Mrs. Roberts and\r\nmake signs or symbols if she had to get a message through to someone.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mrs. Roberts is your next door neighbor?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Then your response to Representative Ford's question is\r\nthat----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. A normal flow to my house.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But there wasn't anybody that came specifically to see her\r\nfrom the Russian emigré group, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Were there any telephone calls to her from anybody\r\nof this group, or any other group?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No. I made the contact for her with my tutor, got her to\r\ncall. But that is all.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. She probably could not operate the telephone.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She could. That was the first I knew. I wasn't certain. But\r\nshe knew how to operate the telephone.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am pleased you raised that, sir. She could dial. Did you\r\nhave the dial system in effect at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Way out in Irving; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And she could dial the number if she wished?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; she knew how to do that.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Did you at any time get any evidence to indicate that she\r\nwas in touch with any Soviet officials at all, the consul general? Did\r\nshe ever talk of going to the Soviet Embassy or the Soviet Consulate in\r\nregard to her problems?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No. The only thing ever mentioned was this that I have\r\nalready mentioned for the record--that she had written to the Soviet\r\nEmbassy inquiring about papers to go back.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Did you think she did that on her own initiative?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; because he was insisting.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. We have a copy of that letter, have we not?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Did she ever tell you why she didn't want to return to the\r\nSoviet Union?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She said she liked America better.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. And she rather liked the conditions here better than she\r\nhad experienced them in the Soviet Union?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. And that you think was her fundamental motivation for\r\nstaying here?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Wanting to stay here? When you were in contact with her at\r\nall did any--when she was staying with you, was there any unidentified\r\ncharacters or people that called to see her?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; there was no one at all that called to see her.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were there any telephone calls received during that period\r\nwhen you answered the phone that someone asked for Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Only that from Lee on the night.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Only from Lee?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Only from Lee.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. No other calls to her?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And no other callers--that is persons who came to your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. None.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. What was the name of these--De Mohrenschildts. Did they\r\ncommunicate with her when she was with you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; my impression is they were already out of the country.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there any mail received or delivered to your home\r\nduring this period for her?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; I don't think so. It is possible that Lee wrote once. I\r\nthink it is more likely she wrote him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In the household goods and paraphernalia transferred to\r\nyour house, were there any books, pamphlets, literature?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I didn't see any.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You did not see any?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Did you ever engage in any discussion or dialectics with\r\nLee about the respective merits of the capitalist system or the Soviet\r\nsystem? Did you engage in any debates with him on political philosophy?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I once listened to such a debate between Lee and my\r\nhusband, in October.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You kept out of the debate?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I tried hard. I felt it was not going anywhere, and that\r\nhe was not a man that could be approached by logic, and that there was\r\nno point to arguing with him. I disagreed with him quite strongly,\r\nand I didn't see how it would help in any way to say so, or to try to\r\nchange--certainly it would not have helped to try to change his views.\r\nHe, for instance, was of the opinion that all churches were an arm of\r\nthe state, intent upon blinding the people. I thought his thinking\r\nwas extremely erroneous, and not open to introduction of other facts,\r\nanything contradictory to his own view.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Did he become intemperate in argument?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; he did not.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. But in the course of his discussions with your husband, did\r\nhe assert adherence to the element of violence as a factor----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Michael tells me he did. I didn't hear that particular\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In response to Mr. McCloy, you told of this\r\nargument that your husband and Lee Oswald had. You said it was October.\r\nThis is October 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Do you have any more questions? We are going to resume in\r\nthe morning at 9 o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Will you be here?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Yes; I will be here.\r\n\r\nThe CHAIRMAN. Then you continue to preside throughout her testimony. I\r\nwill be here, though.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I have no questions.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Do you want to close?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I would just as soon adjourn now, if it suits your\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. All right. We will excuse you. Thank you for your\r\ncooperation.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 5:20 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thursday, March 19, 1964_\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF RUTH HYDE PAINE RESUMED\r\n\r\nThe President's Commission met at 9:05 a.m. on March 19, 1964, at 200\r\nMaryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nPresent were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Sherman\r\nCooper, Representative Hale Boggs, Representative Gerald R. Ford, John\r\nJ. McCloy, and Allen W. Dulles, members.\r\n\r\nAlso present were Albert E. Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel; and Wesley\r\nJ. Liebeler, assistant counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Mrs. Paine, I must remind you that you are still under\r\naffirmation. We don't take a new affirmation with each hearing.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. We had concluded, if you recall, the 15-day period in May\r\nthat Mrs. Oswald resided at the home of Mrs. Paine.\r\n\r\nWould you please describe for us the items of household furniture, or\r\nwhatever the articles were, that were packed in your station wagon when\r\nyou took Mrs. Oswald to New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. We packed in a play pen and crib. I recall a stroller, some\r\nkitchen utensils, and personal clothing for herself and the baby.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there any luggage of any character?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There may have been a small suitcase but I don't recall it\r\nspecifically.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You do not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am just guessing.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. As I recall you have told us yesterday that when you\r\narrived in New Orleans, you went by the Murrets' home first?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And then from the Murrets' home to the apartment at, what\r\nwas that address on Magazine Street?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. 4907.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That was 4907 rather than 4905.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mrs. Paine, there has been a touch of testimony, at least\r\nof the possibility that Mr. Oswald may have dry-fired or dry-sighted\r\nany rifle in the courtyard or garden space at 4907?\r\n\r\nWould you be good enough to draw for us free hand the layout, at least\r\nthe ground layout of the 4907 premises on Magazine Street in New\r\nOrleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Now, shall I describe this?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Could I first show the diagram. I have marked the diagram\r\nthe witness has drawn as Commission Exhibit No. 403.\r\n\r\n(The diagram referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 403 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chairman, might it be helpful and permissible if I had\r\nthe witness stand to your rear and point to the diagram so that you\r\nmight follow her testimony?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Very well.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This street is Magazine Street; it is a corner house.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me, Mrs. Paine, left on your plot is east and west\r\nand up and down are north and south?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; that is the way I recall it. This is a corner house\r\nand there was room enough----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me, I have to keep the record. You are referring now\r\nto a square on the right-hand margin of your outline.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Between this house, and the courtyard and house where the\r\nOswalds were staying, there was room enough to drive a car.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you marked the courtyard with that word?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, you have written \"courtyard\" in the sort of an \"L\"\r\nshaped space that you have indicated on the plot, is that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This is a square space cut by a walk.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This was a low fence.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you say this, it does not help us on the record; what\r\nis this to which you have pointed--you have written something across it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Around this courtyard and in front of the house was a low\r\nmetal picket fence.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That you have so designated?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There was grass within this small courtyard or walk,\r\nsteps----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which you have also marked \"walk\"?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. Steps going up.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which you have likewise so marked?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. To a screened porch.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Likewise so marked?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And then the doorway from the porch goes into the living\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And the living room is marked \"Living room.\" Would you use\r\nthose names and those designations as you testify?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, would you please indicate the courtyard or square or\r\noblong portion you have marked, rectangular portion, that was open\r\nspace, was it, it was not roofed?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was fully open.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It was fully open, and it faced out on Magazine Street?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And was there open space to the east, that would be toward\r\nthe building, which you have merely designated as an empty square?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I will write in here \"driveway;\" this was open here as a\r\ndriveway.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mrs. Paine, is that what you have now marked a building, a\r\ndwelling?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was a dwelling.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were there dwellings to the south of Magazine Street and on\r\nthe opposite side of the street?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That so far as I recall, that is my best recollection.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What was to the east in the way of dwellings or buildings?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The rest of the house; they lived in a portion; entered\r\nfrom the side door of a large house; I assume it was once a one-family\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Then for our purpose here as far as the courtyard is\r\nconcerned on the east it was--there was a walk?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. A building.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. West, I am sorry. On the west line of the courtyard there\r\nwas a walk?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On the north of the courtyard there was the screened porch\r\nand to the east, but with intervening driveway there was a dwelling\r\nhouse?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Then the courtyard was open on Magazine Street?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Does your recollection serve you that anybody standing in\r\nthe courtyard and dry-sighting a rifle would be visible to people who\r\njust happened by, or who would be looking out a window on the south\r\nside of Magazine Street, or in the home or in the dwelling house to the\r\neast of the courtyard?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He would have been very visible. Would have collected a\r\nclutch of small boys.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This was a neighborhood, then, in which there were small\r\nchildren?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was it a reasonably busy street?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Very busy street.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What were the days of the week that you were there when you\r\nreturned, when you brought Mrs. Oswald to New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. When we first went down, we arrived on Saturday, I was\r\nthere Sunday and Monday and left Tuesday morning.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right.\r\n\r\nDoes your recollection serve so that you can state that the days\r\nyou were there you observed during the daytime, at least many or a\r\nreasonable number of small children and mothers and fathers, in and\r\nabout the neighborhood?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. A good many small children and adults.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was that likewise true when you returned in September about\r\nwhich you will testify in a few moments?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That was certainly true in September.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n403, a plot which Mrs. Paine has just drawn and which is so marked.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. So received.\r\n\r\n(The diagram referred to heretofore, marked Commission Exhibit No. 403\r\nfor identification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\n(At this point, Mr. Dulles entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was the dwelling in which the Oswalds were residing, 4907\r\nMagazine Street, a single level or a double level house?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was all on the ground floor.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It was a one-story house, one story high?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was a segment of a house that probably had two stories\r\nto it. I don't recall. But the segment they had was all on one level.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that was the ground level?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Directing your attention to Exhibit No. 403, and Mr.\r\nDulles, would you favor me by handing her the exhibit, and with\r\nparticular reference to the screen porch, the screen porch likewise\r\nopened up on Magazine Street, did it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, it was set back a short space from the street, but\r\nthe door opened up toward Magazine.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The screened portion, that is, that faced on Magazine\r\nStreet?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. If anyone were on the screen porch, let us say,\r\ndry-sighting a rifle or some other firearm, would he be, would that\r\nperson be observable from Magazine Street, and from the east?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I doubt he would have been noticed from Magazine Street. A\r\nsmall boy passing in the driveway could have looked through the screen,\r\nup to the----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is to the east?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I will mark \"screen\" on the south and east side so you know\r\nit is screened on both sides.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't recall for certainty but there may have been a kind\r\nof shade that could have been put down. It was not when I was there,\r\ndown, but there may have been some means of----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Lattice shade?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Putting down a lattice blind.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. A blind or something?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Of course, if the blind were down no one could see it. Did\r\nyou have occasion when you were there, Mrs. Paine, on either of your\r\ntwo trips to be on the screen porch?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And looking out?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And was there any impediment to your view?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No, I could see the street very well.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you have occasion there on either of those occasions to\r\nbe out in the courtyard or on the street to be looking into the porch\r\narea.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Could you see the persons, from the courtyard, could you\r\nsee persons behind the screen?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. From the courtyard you could see persons behind the screen.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do I take it then by your emphasis on courtyard, do you\r\nmean by that if you were on Magazine Street itself, that is the\r\nsidewalk in front of the home it would be difficult to see in?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Looking directly in you would notice someone but just\r\npassing by you would not have been apt to see them.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But if you looked directly you could see in on the porch?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think so; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You mentioned yesterday a series of letters and\r\ncorrespondence and you spent some time with me last night and we went\r\nover all that, do you recall?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you have your summary we worked with last night at hand\r\nto assist you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you mind taking that out, please?\r\n\r\nYou mentioned yesterday in your testimony a note that you had sent\r\nto Marina Oswald shortly after your initial acquaintance with her in\r\nFebruary of 1963. Did you receive a response to that note?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I did; and I have that response.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I have here a document which we will mark as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 404, including its envelope as 404A.\r\n\r\nIs that the document or note you received from Mrs. Oswald and the\r\nenvelope?\r\n\r\n(The document and envelope referred to were marked Commission Exhibits\r\nNos. 404 and 404A, respectively, for identification.)\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did that reach you in the ordinary course of its posting by\r\nmail?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Are you familiar with the handwriting of Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am now.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that--do you identify the handwriting in that document\r\n404?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is her handwriting.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is hers.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And is it in the same condition now as it was when you\r\nreceived it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that is her response to your note?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I offer in evidence as Exhibit No. 404 the document now so\r\nmarked.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The letter and envelope referred to, heretofore marked for\r\nidentification as Commission Exhibits Nos. 404 and 404-A, were received\r\nin evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, that is in what language?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is in Russian. Except for the address on the outside.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nHave you made a translation of that note?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And is it the translation on the notes that you exhibited\r\nto me last night which we have marked as No. 1?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. May I inquire, Mr. Chairman, if you would prefer that I\r\nread the translation in evidence or may we have it----\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. It is a short note?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is a short note. Others are a little longer, however,\r\nand if I have your permission, to save you time, I would read that into\r\nthe record during the noon recess or something of that character.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Very well.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that acceptable.\r\n\r\nNow, did you thereafter--you wrote Mrs. Oswald at or about that time in\r\nresponse to that note of yours, did you not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No. Let's see--I don't recall whether I did or not or\r\nwhether I arrived on the Tuesday that she had suggested.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I have a little difficulty in handling these, Mr. Chairman,\r\nbecause they are in Russian, and I don't immediately have a vision of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am handing you a document which I have numbered as No. 2.\r\n\r\nWould you locate that for me on your summary?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that the second page?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That note also in Russian but in whose handwriting?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. In my handwriting.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that is a draft, I take it, of a letter or note that\r\nyou transmitted to Mrs. Oswald.\r\n\r\nWould you identify in your sheaf of notes the point at which you made a\r\ntranslation of that note?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. When did I make a translation of it? I didn't understand\r\nyour question.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you point out in your notes the translation of the\r\ndocument? Is that the center of the page on page 2?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is the document which I will have marked as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 405 in your handwriting?\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 405 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is it in the same condition now as it was when you\r\ncompleted it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; being, of course, a rough draft of what I sent and not\r\nwhat I sent.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You do not have the original of that because you sent it to\r\nMarina Oswald, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But it does represent your present best recollection of the\r\nnote as you transmitted it to her?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right. This note is without a date. Shall I give my\r\nrecollection of when I think it was written?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes; please.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think it was written in March and referred to--it closes,\r\n\"Until the 20th.\" I believe that referred to Wednesday, March 20, which\r\nis what appears here with the name Marina.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which is what you testified to yesterday, and when you say\r\n\"appears here\" you meant Exhibit 401?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I offer in evidence the original document which has now\r\nbeen identified as Commission Exhibit No. 405.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to heretofore marked Commission Exhibit No. 405\r\nfor identification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I will read the translation in the record during the noon\r\nrecess. You shortly transmitted another letter of your own to Mrs.\r\nOswald, did you not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And I have here a document which I have marked Commission\r\nExhibit No. 406. Is this a draft of the letter in your handwriting?\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 406 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And did you shortly after the completion of that draft\r\nretranscribe it and transmit the letter to Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you made a translation of that letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is the draft of that document in the same condition now as\r\nit was when you completed it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where is that document transcribed on your notes?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is at the top of page 2.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is what we call No. 3, is it not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And dated March 26.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This, Mr. Chairman, is her note to which she testified\r\nyesterday was an invitation to the Oswalds to dinner at her home on\r\nApril 2.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It appears--the following invitation is a full explanation\r\nof it. I believe I had made the explanation in person. This letter was\r\nto say that Michael would come and pick them up.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This was confirmation of your original invitation?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; this was that Michael could pick them up.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I offer in evidence a document marked Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 406.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to, heretofore marked Commission Exhibit No. 406\r\nfor identification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you receive from Marina herself a note with respect to\r\nyour invitation to have her and her husband join you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have a note which I take to be a reply to that\r\ninvitation, saying that that date, Tuesday, would be fine.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And I hand you Commission Document No. 407.\r\n\r\nIs that the note you received from Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 407 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you made--is it in the same condition now as it was\r\nwhen you received it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have no envelope anymore. I don't know what happened to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is the note itself in the same condition as it was at the\r\ntime you received it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No. I have written on it in my hand to help me understand\r\nthe meaning of it, some pen notations, translation of the Russian words.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am interested in that, Mrs. Paine.\r\n\r\nDid you also--are there some additions in your handwriting on the first\r\npage of the note?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes, marked one, two, three, four and clearly taken from a\r\ndictionary.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Why did you do that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. To explain to myself the meaning of these particular words.\r\nI had to look them up.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is it a fair statement, Mrs. Paine, that your command\r\nof the Russian language was not facile enough for you to read the\r\ntotal letter freehand, as soon as you received it, but you wrote\r\non the letter definitions of words and of phrases to assist you in\r\ninterpreting it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is a fair statement.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were all the notations you have now identified placed by\r\nyou on that letter shortly after you received it, or in the course of\r\nyour effort to interpret it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, save for those additions of yours, is the document in\r\nthe same condition now as it was when you received it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And is it otherwise in the same condition as it was when\r\nyou placed those notes on it?\r\n\r\nIn other words, there have been no notes of your own placed on the\r\ndocument subsequent to, at, or about the time you received it when you\r\nwere attempting to interpret it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, you first said, or when I was translating it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I translated it immediately for myself at the time, and\r\nthen when I made a written translation I made a more careful one so\r\nthat some of these notes were done a week ago.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is what I was getting at.\r\n\r\nWould you please, for the Commission identify the particular notes that\r\nyou placed on there at the time you were seeking to interpret it when\r\nyou first received it, and the notes you placed on there about a week\r\nago, and indicate the pages.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I can easily answer that.\r\n\r\nThere is only one that was placed more recently. That is an underline\r\non the inside.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Right-hand inside page?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Right-hand side.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is it merely an underlining?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Underline and a question mark.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And would you interpret that for us, please?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I couldn't read her handwriting, but later realized the\r\nword to be \"if.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you were seeking to interpret it a week ago to\r\ntranslate it, you placed a question mark over that word because you\r\ncouldn't quite figure it out?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And then later realized what it was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. As being the word \"if\"?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Other than that, Mrs. Paine, is the document in the\r\ncondition it was when you received it and when you initially placed\r\nnotations on it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you recognize that handwriting?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes, that is Marina Oswald's handwriting.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you made a translation for the Commission of that\r\nletter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that appears in your notes at page what?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The first page at the bottom.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which I have marked No. 4, I believe, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Beginning \"For Ruth and Michael Paine.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Does your interpretation or translation of the letter\r\nrepresent your impressions of the letter when you read it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that is true, is it, of the other translations which we\r\nwill introduce through you today? Is that true of all your translations?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am not sure of what you are inquiring.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What I am inquiring about, others--as you related to me\r\nlast night--other persons with the command of the Russian language.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I had no help with the translations.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nOther persons with their command of the Russian language might read\r\none of Marina's letters and have at least, as to some words, an\r\ninterpretation different from yours. What I am saying----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. In a minor regard, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It may be?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. But I believe the meaning would have been the same.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But it is important to get your impressions, Mrs. Paine, of\r\nMarina's letters to you, despite what interpretations some other people\r\nmight give to the same letter, and what I am seeking to emphasize is\r\nwhether your translations are your impressions of those letters?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; but they are good translations.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I don't mean to question that. We seek the impact of these\r\nnotes upon you.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I see. This is exactly what I understood them to mean, of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is fine.\r\n\r\nNow, you received in May or on or about May, or shortly after May 25,\r\n1963, another note from Marina Oswald, did you not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This was postmarked May 25.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. After you had taken her to New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is correct. This was the first letter I received from\r\nher from New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you have kindly produced the original of that letter\r\nfor the Commission, have you not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am sorry, I have to have your answer aloud or I can't get\r\nit on the record.\r\n\r\nThe document you have produced is marked Commission Exhibit 408.\r\n\r\nDo you recognize the handwriting of that note and of that envelope?\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 408 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This is the handwriting of Marina Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Both documents?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. On both.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you receive--that is a letter, is it not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is a letter.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you receive it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is it on or about, did you receive it on or about the date\r\nit is postmarked?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Shortly after, I would guess.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I can see some handwriting written horizontally on the back\r\nof the envelope, is that handwriting yours or Marina's?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is mine.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When did you place that handwriting on the reverse side?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. When I first read the letter and sought to understand it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see.\r\n\r\nAnd those notations are in Russian or in English?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. A word is given in Russian followed by a translation in\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. As in the case of one of the earlier exhibits, did you\r\nplace those notations on the reverse side of the envelope at the time\r\nyou received the letter in the course of your attempting to interpret\r\nthe letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And those notations were in the course of your doing that.\r\nExcept for the notations on the reverse side of the envelope, is the\r\nletter and is the envelope, each in the same condition now as when you\r\nreceived it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; I have made a few underlinings.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you identify any additions you placed on the original\r\ndocument, indicating the page, front or reverse side?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have marked \"bind\"----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that b-i-n-d?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Over one word.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you written the word \"bind\"? Is that what you mean?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. B-i-n-d.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that is an interpretation, I take it of a word written\r\nin Russian underneath it.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that word then to you in English was \"bind\", b-i-n-d.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Anything else?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have written the word \"thaw\" and crossed it out; that was\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Meaning what, Mrs. Paine?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I had the wrong translation for that word. I realized it\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What was the word rather than----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The meaning was \"insists\"; the rest of the markings by me\r\nare underlinings.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I will cover those by asking you this. Were there any\r\nunderlinings on the letter placed there by Marina Oswald at the time\r\nyou received the letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Only one, under this word here.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is on the reverse side of the second page of the\r\nletter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is on the last page. The second page; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is the reverse side of the second sheet of paper?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And it looks to help from her as though it is an arrow, is\r\nthat correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There is an underline and then from the underlined word is\r\nan arrow.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibits Nos. 407 and 408\r\nthe documents now so marked and identified by the witness.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. They may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The documents referred to, heretofore marked for identification as\r\nCommission Exhibits Nos. 407 and 408, were received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you retain that for a moment, please?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. May I ask, is the envelope 408A attached?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes; and in the ease of the earlier exhibit the envelope----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is only the second envelope we have had.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The envelope accompanying Exhibit 404 was marked 404A, and\r\nthe envelope now accompanying 408 is marked 408A.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Is it so marked now?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you wish me to mark it?\r\n\r\n(The enevelope was marked Commission Exhibit 408A for identification\r\nand received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you supplied the Commission, Mrs. Paine, with your\r\ntranslation of that letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes, I have.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And your interpretation and the effect or the impression\r\nthat you had of that letter when you received it and as you read it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, turning to the first page, I would like to direct\r\nattention----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Do you wish this back?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; I will look at the translation.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She has supplied me with an interpretation. In the first\r\nparagraph it reads and I quote, and you follow me, please. I will read\r\nthe whole paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"Here it is already a week since I received your letter. I can't\r\nproduce any excuses as there are no valid reasons. I am ashamed to\r\nconfess that I am a person of moods and my mood currently is such that\r\nI don't feel much like anything. As soon as you left all love stopped\r\nand I am very hurt that Lee's attitude toward me is such that I feel\r\neach minute that I bind him. He insists that I leave America which I\r\ndon't want to do at all. I like America very much and I think that even\r\nwithout Lee I would not be lost here. What do you think?\"\r\n\r\nHad you had any discussion with Marina when you were in New Orleans\r\non the subject matters which I have just read to you from the first\r\nparagraph of her letter, Commission Exhibit No. 408?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There was no such discussion in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What impact did this have on you, Mrs. Paine, when you\r\nreceived this letter and read that first paragraph?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was a repetition, or similar to something she had told\r\nme late in March, which I have already put on the record yesterday,\r\nsaying basically that he wanted her to go back, wanted to send her back\r\nto the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And to send her back alone, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That was the impression I carried.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there ever any occassion, during all your acquaintance\r\nwith the Oswalds, when there was any suggestion or implication that if\r\nshe returned to Russia, at his request, that he would accompany her?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There was no such suggestion.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was it always that she was to go to Russia alone?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. As she described it, it carried from her the feeling that\r\nshe was being sent away.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What about the little child, June?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. June with her.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was to accompany her to Russia. Now, the second paragraph,\r\nif I may:\r\n\r\n\"This is the basic question which doesn't leave me day or night. And\r\nagain Lee has said to me that he doesn't love me. So you see we came\r\nto mistaken conclusions. It is hard for you and me to live without a\r\nreturn of our love interest gone. How would it all end?\"\r\n\r\nHad there been discussions between you and Marina Oswald on the subject\r\nof whether or not her husband had love for her, and in that area?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. What I particularly recall is what I mentioned yesterday,\r\nwhen he telephoned her and said he had found a job and wanted her to\r\ncome----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This was just before going to New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Just before going to New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In the spring?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Right. She said \"Papa loves us,\" as I have testified. She\r\nhad wondered to me during the 2 weeks previous whether he did, whether\r\nshe loved him. But was clearly elated by his call and gradually came\r\nto her own conclusions. Really, I had no ground upon which to make a\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. She was speaking in Russian then to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, were you impressed that this paragraph, however, was\r\nnot consistent with her immediate response at the time that telephone\r\ncall had been made to her?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It showed me there was not as much change as she had hoped.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you have any discussion with her on this subject when\r\nyou were in New Orleans, and when you took her or when you were taking\r\nher from Irving, Tex., to New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. None whatsoever. When you were in New Orleans, Mrs. Paine,\r\ndid you tour any night clubs?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you or Marina ever evidence any interest in touring\r\nBourbon Street, for example?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. You are talking about the spring visit?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes; I am.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. We went to the French Quarter during the day.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Please identify whom you include when you say \"we.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Lee, Marina, I, and three children.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did all of you, including Lee, go to the French Quarter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; we did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you tour the Bourbon Street areas, Royal Street, and\r\nthe other areas?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; we did not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Will you tell us without any length--you did not. This was\r\na tourist visit of the French Quarter, is that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In the day?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. With the children?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was anything said during the course of that tourist visit\r\nabout visiting Bourbon Street at night rather than in the daytime?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't recall that there was anything said.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there any discussion about Lee Oswald visiting or\r\nfrequenting night clubs?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. None.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Either in Dallas, or in New Orleans or in Irving, Tex.?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. None; at any time.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did any one of you tour Bourbon Street at night during that\r\nspring visit?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Any discussion of the subject?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Not to my recollection.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there a subsequent occasion when you did visit Bourbon\r\nStreet at night?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. In September, when I visited again in New Orleans. Shall I\r\ntell that?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes; please, because there is a measure of contrast to that\r\nI would like to bring out.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Marina and I and our three small children went down in the\r\nearly evening and walked along the street.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you tell us how that came about, whether Lee Oswald\r\naccompanied you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He did not accompany us. He was asked if he wanted to go,\r\nand he said he did not. Marina was interested in my seeing Bourbon\r\nStreet at night simply as a tourist attraction.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you two girls took your children?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did she take June?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You two girls walked down Bourbon Street?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And one of us very pregnant.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And observed everything from the outside. You didn't go\r\ninside any night clubs?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No. In fact, when I realized we weren't permitted, we went\r\non.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You had small children?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there any discussion with Mr. Oswald at that time or\r\nwith Marina which led you to form a judgment as to whether he was a man\r\nwho might, or would, or had frequented night clubs?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I judged he was not such a person.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In all your experiences with the Oswalds from February,\r\nsometime in February 1963, even to the present date, had any mention\r\nbeen made of Lee Oswald frequenting night clubs?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. None.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Or of Marina at any time?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No mention of her.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you get the impression when you made this trip that\r\nMarina had previously made the trip herself, that she seemed to know\r\nthe surroundings?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This occurs in the next paragraph of the letter she wrote\r\nin May, so I knew she had been herself.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. She had been there before?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. From the letter I judge with Lee accompanying her.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mrs. Paine, if you will pardon me. Mr. Reporter, will you\r\nread the question?\r\n\r\n(Question read.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you answer just that question?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. She did answer it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I didn't think she did.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I think she said \"yes.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now the letter of May 25th to you does make reference to\r\nvisits to the French Quarter, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Gentlemen of the Commission, that portion of the letter\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Now a bit about the impressions I have received this week. Last\r\nSaturday we went to Aunt Lillian's\"--Aunt Lillian, Mrs. Paine, is Lee\r\nOswald's aunt?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mrs. Murret?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Mrs. Murret.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. \"And leaving June with her we are at the lake. Lee wanted\r\nto catch crabs but caught nothing. I have a very high opinion of his\r\nrelatives.\"\r\n\r\nBy the way, what was your opinion of his relatives?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I met them only once. I thought them to be very nice.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. \"Straightforward and kind people. To me they are very\r\nattentive. I like them. We have been to the French Quarter in the\r\nevening. It is a shame you didn't manage to get there in the evening.\r\nFor me it was especially interesting as it was the first time in my\r\nlife I had seen such. There were many night clubs there. Through the\r\nopen doors were visible barrel covered dancing girls (so as not to say\r\nentirely unclothed). Most of them had really very pretty, rare figures\r\nand if one doesn't think about too many things then one can like them\r\nvery much. There were a great many tourists there. For the most part\r\nvery rich. We have been to the near park again.\"\r\n\r\nThat is all of that paragraph dealing with the nightclubs. Now, did you\r\never know a man or person by the name of Jack Rubinstein or Jack Ruby?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Prior to November 24, 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you ever hear of any such individual?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No, I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had you frequented a nightclub in Irving or in Dallas prior\r\nto November 24, 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Not at any time. In either town.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You and your husband Michael were not in the habit of\r\nvisiting, frequenting nightclubs?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is a fact, is it not, Mrs. Paine that neither you nor\r\nMr. Paine attended nightclubs at all?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is this true prior to your moving to Irving?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there anything that occurred during all these months of\r\nyour acquaintance with the Oswalds that did or might have led you to\r\nany opinion as to Lee's frequenting of nightclubs or his acquaintance\r\nwith nightclubs or his being intimate with nightclub people?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. During the entire time, is that your question?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes. Let us end the day for you for this purpose at\r\nNovember 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He was, I would say, actively disinterested in going down\r\nto Bourbon Street in the last weekend in September.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But even prior to that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was the 21st.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had anything occurred by way of a remark at all that made\r\nan impression on you in the area of his being acquainted possibly with\r\nany nightclub people, any entertainers?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There had been no hint of any sort that he was acquainted\r\nwith nightclub people?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Whether in Dallas, New Orleans or Irving?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right. Of course, I had not talked to him a great\r\ndeal up to the New Orleans trip. Then after that time there was also no\r\nhint or mention of any nightclub people. After that time in New Orleans\r\nhe did refuse table wine at my home, so I got the impression of him as\r\na person who didn't like to drink.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. During all your acquaintance with Lee Harvey Oswald, did\r\nyou ever see him take a drink of spirits, intoxicating spirits?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is possible he had beer at the initial party on the 22d\r\nof February, that is as far as I can remember.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What impression did you have of him as a man of temperance?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He teased Marina about liking wine as if it displeased him\r\nmildly.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me, Mrs. Paine. You are talking in terms of\r\nconclusions which is all right with me if you will give me the\r\nspecifics also. Could you give us an example or an occasion of what you\r\nhave in mind?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, at the same occasion when he refused the wine, she\r\nhad some.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. Did he say something that led you to say he was\r\nteasing her?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you describe what that was?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Indicating a mild disapproval.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you please relate to the Commission your impression\r\nof Marina Oswald as a temperate person?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She did not like liquors.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What we would call hard liquor?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Strong spirits.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Strong spirits.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. But she did drink beer at my home, and did occasionally\r\nhave wine.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She occasionally had a bit of wine and she occasionally had\r\nsome beer?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that the extent of, as far as your personal knowledge is\r\nconcerned, her indulgence in intoxicating spirits?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Does that likewise describe your indulgence or do you----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I would also drink a cocktail on occasion.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But very limited and just an occasional drink?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that likewise true of your husband, Michael?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did Marina ever drink to excess?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Certainly not that I ever heard about or saw.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Not that you ever heard about or that you saw?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Or saw.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. From your testimony that is certainly true with Lee Harvey\r\nOswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is certainly true of him also.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. As far as you are concerned?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. As far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, I think you testified yesterday that Marina would\r\nassist you in your becoming more proficient in the Russian language by\r\nreturning letters that you had written her, upon which she would place\r\nher comments of instruction or criticism or suggestion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Before she left for New Orleans in May, she offered to\r\ncorrect and send back any letters I wrote to her. In the correspondence\r\nwhich included some four letters with her altogether, there was only\r\none of mine that was actually corrected and sent back and you have that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I have marked a three-page document as Commission Exhibit\r\n409, and the envelope as Commission Exhibit 409A, the envelope being\r\npostmarked at New Orleans on June 6, 1963, and being addressed to Mrs.\r\nRuth Paine.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Do you want to make a separate designation for my return\r\nletter? You are looking at the letter which accompanied her letter.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That document I will mark as Commission Exhibit----may I\r\nhave permission, Mr. Chairman, to mark this document in my own hand\r\nbecause the sticker, I am afraid, will obliterate some of the letter.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. You may.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I will mark this as 409B.\r\n\r\nNow, Mrs. Paine, would you be good enough to identify 409, 409A, and\r\n409B, the sequence in which they passed back and forth between you and\r\nMrs. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It includes, No. 409 is my letter to her dated the 1st of\r\nJune, which she----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that document, or do you recognize the handwriting on\r\nthat document?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is my hand.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you turn to the reverse side of the second page,\r\nthird page. I see there is something on that in red crayon.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. All the red marks and the little bit in ballpoint pen are\r\nmade by her.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is what I was seeking to bring out.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. At the end it includes a note of comments.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, Mrs. Paine, the portion of the letter in blue ink in\r\nlonghand is in whose handwriting?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. In my handwriting.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And the portion of the letter in red crayon on the reverse\r\nside of the third page is in whose handwriting?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Is in her handwriting.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On the first page is there any of her handwriting?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. On the first page in blue ink, ballpoint pen there is some\r\nhandwriting which is hers at the top.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Those are notations in between the lines or in the margin?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Above my writing. Yes; sir.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. They are comments of hers on your letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And my spelling.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Of your spelling?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do any of those markings appear other than on the face of\r\nthe first sheet?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. In blue ink you are asking?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes, I am.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No. The rest is all in red.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That then was a letter that you had sent to her?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was it returned to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did some document which you now have before you accompany\r\nthe letter on its return?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Her letter dated June 5th.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which has been marked Commission Exhibit 409B?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you do recognize that handwriting as having been hers?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Of the two documents you have now identified, 409 and 409B,\r\nwere they enclosed in an envelope?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; they were.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that envelope before you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is marked Commission Exhibit 409A?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Are all those conditions of documents in the condition\r\nwhich they were in when you received them?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have again added in my hand on her letter.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is 409B?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Translations of certain of the words.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you please, for the purpose of the record, identify\r\nwhat your handwriting is, on the letter 409B.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is above her words. Most of it is in English.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is in your hand?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Other than that, are the documents in the condition they\r\nwere when you received them?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. There is one interesting thing to me, Mrs. Paine, to which\r\nI would like to draw the attention of the Commission. And I direct\r\nyour attention in this respect to Exhibits 404, 404A, 408, 408A, 409,\r\nand 409A. Each has an envelope addressed to you, and each is addressed\r\nwritten in English.\r\n\r\nIs the handwriting on each of those envelopes Marina Oswald's?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She was then able to write some English, is that so?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you please----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She learned her own address.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did her command of the use of the English language, at\r\nleast from the writing standpoint, extend beyond those examples?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Not to my knowledge. I knew that she looked at signs and\r\nhad learned the sound value of the English letters. That she looked at\r\nthe Thursday supplement to the newspaper for the ads on vegetables and\r\nthings with pictures on a can or something that showed the English of\r\nwhat it was, to try to determine what this word was and pronounce it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So she did acquire some command of English with respect to\r\nreading newspapers?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was not my impression that she could read a newspaper.\r\nShe could pick out the sound values. It was not until October that\r\nI read with her a portion from Time magazine regarding Madam Nhu,\r\nwhenever that was news, she asked me to read this to her and translate\r\nit. I read it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you read it in English first?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I read it in English, giving translation of some of the\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. As you went along?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. As I went along.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. But many of the words, English words, were words she\r\nunderstood, because they were either similar to the Russian or because\r\nshe had learned them.\r\n\r\nI was surprised at how much she understood when I pronounced it and\r\nread it to her.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. In English?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. In English. Because she was very hesitant to speak English\r\nwith me, fearful that her pronunciation would not be correct. She would\r\nask me several times, \"How do I pronounce this,\" although she didn't\r\nthink she was doing very well with the pronunciation, although she did\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She was sensitive in this respect, Mrs. Paine, she was\r\nhesitant to use the English language in the presence, say, of Americans\r\nor even the Russian emigré groups?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think most people are sensitive about using a language\r\nwhen the person they are with can understand them in the language they\r\nuse better. She also talked with my immediate neighbor for a short\r\ntime, when only she and the neighbor were present. I went to see about\r\na child.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Could your neighbor understand Russian?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But there was a measure of communication?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There was some communication, not a great deal. My neighbor\r\ntold me after she saw Marina on television in January, whatever it was,\r\n\"that girl has learned a great deal of English.\" She was amazed at the\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. The improvement from October to January?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. How would you appraise her general intelligence, her level\r\nof intelligence for a girl of that age in the early twenties?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think she certainly had above average intelligence.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. What prompted her, if you know, to ask about Madam\r\nNhu?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She was interested in the family. She was worried about\r\nwhat Madam Nhu would do. Madam Nhu and the children still in her\r\ncountry. She wanted to know were these children going to come out\r\neither in Paris or the United States. She was concerned, and her\r\nconcern for world affairs seemed to go this way, of what is this mother\r\nand children going to do.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was she concerned about the conflict between the North\r\nVietnamese and the South Vietnamese?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; this didn't interest her, it didn't appear to.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It was the human side rather than the political side?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Strictly that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Thank you; that is what I wanted to bring out. I offer in\r\nevidence, Mr. Chairman, as Exhibits with those numbers, the documents\r\nmarked Commission Exhibits 409, 409-A, and 409-B.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The documents referred to previously, marked Commission Exhibits Nos.\r\n409, 409-A, and 409-B, were received in evidence.)\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Boggs entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, Mrs. Paine, turning to this series of correspondence\r\nwhich has now been admitted in evidence, have you made an\r\ninterpretation for the Commission of Exhibit 409-B?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where does that appear on your summary you furnished to me\r\nlast evening?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That begins in the middle of page 6, marked second letter\r\nfrom New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Your interpretation of the letter dealing with\r\nthe night club visit of the Oswalds, you have interpreted that for the\r\nCommission, and that appears on page what of your summary?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That appears on page 3 marked first letter from New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Were you concerned about Mrs. Oswald, about\r\nMarina's condition and her receiving proper medical attention?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I was very concerned about it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you write her at any time about it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I would like to refer you to my letter of June 1st which\r\nwas returned in the document you just admitted in evidence.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You did write her about it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I wrote particularly in that letter to Lee.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You wrote both Lee and Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. In this letter I addressed each, and a particular portion\r\nof that letter is in English.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that is Commission Exhibit No. 409?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That was to Lee, that particular portion.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You incorporated, did you not, in that letter, a direct\r\ncommunication to Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I say in Russian a few words to Lee now about hospital and\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But incorporated in your note in that letter to Lee Oswald\r\nyou used the English rather than the Russian language, did you not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I wanted to speak of things I couldn't say in Russian. I\r\ndidn't have the vocabulary to do it with any ease in Russian.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And further I particularly wanted to tell him I thought it\r\nimportant she get to a doctor and have prenatal care and felt he would\r\nbe the one who actually got her there. It was his concern that would\r\nproduce a visit to the doctor.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. That explains that portion of the letter which is\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 409.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. 409.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I won't go into the details, Mr. Chairman, because these\r\nare recommendations of Mrs. Paine for medical care of Marina Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Do I understand you are going to read all of these into the\r\nrecord at the noon hour?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. At the noon hour I will read all of these into the record\r\nrather than do it now. Now you, last night, Mrs Paine, suggested to me\r\nyou would like to make an explanation of this series of letters, and I\r\ndirect your attention to page 7 of your notes.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, the commentary on page 7 by me is----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Refreshing your recollection from having read it, you would\r\nlike to make a statement to the Commission and you may proceed to do so.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It doesn't refresh me enough. I could say this. That when\r\nI received 409-B, her letter, I read it through. I glanced at 409, her\r\ncorrected--my letter which she had corrected, and at the note at the\r\nback which began, \"You write well\" and assumed this to be commentary on\r\nmy letter; it was not until I sat down nearly a month later to write\r\na proper reply to her, I read this through more carefully and found\r\nin the middle of the paragraph discussing my writing a comment by her\r\nsaying, \"Very likely I will have to go back to Russia after all.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. For the purpose of the record there appears the red crayon\r\nto which I earlier drew your attention on the back of page 3.\r\n\r\nWould you read that entire notation of hers so that the Commission may\r\nnow know that to which you are now directing your attention?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. In the back of my letter she writes in red pencil, \"You\r\nwrite well, when will I write that way in English. I think never. Very\r\nlikely I will have to go back to Russia after all. A pity.\"\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What was the last?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. \"A pity.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I take it when you first read that notation on the back of\r\nthe third page of the letter you had not noticed the sentence, \"Very\r\nlikely I will have to go to Russia after all. A pity.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you proceed with your comment?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This was early July when I read this letter more carefully\r\nand I was shocked that I hadn't noticed this. That my poor Russian made\r\na scanning of the letter not adequate to picking that up, and I wrote\r\nher immediately apologizing for my bad understanding, and I don't have\r\nthat letter, but I have three which followed it, and----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me. Do you have a draft, have you produced for the\r\nCommission your immediate preceding draft of that letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have no rough draft of my first letter explaining my\r\nshock and my worry at this statement of hers.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. But I have rough drafts of three letters I wrote\r\nsubsequently.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you ever seen at any time a copy or the original of\r\nthe letter that you wrote, a draft of which you do not have?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; I haven't.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you please relate to the Commission your present\r\nrecollection of the substance and content of that letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Much what I have said. That I apologized that my poor\r\nRussian didn't see this immediately and I inquired after her what she\r\nwas doing, and asked to hear from her.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You say, that sentence when you finally did read it rather\r\nshocked you. Would you rather--would you elaborate on that statement to\r\nthe Commission? Why did that shock you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It seemed more final than anything else that had preceded.\r\nShe had told me in March that he had asked her to go back, that she had\r\nwritten to the embassy but she didn't reply to the embassy when the\r\nembassy inquired why. It looked as though she was able to just say no\r\nby not doing anything about it. But this, on the other hand, looked as\r\nif she was resigned to the necessity to go back.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were you aware at this time, Mrs. Paine, that Lee had\r\napplied to the State Department for a passport and had obtained one?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; I was not aware of that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When did you first become aware of that, if you ever did?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was considerably after the assassination, and I read it\r\nin a paper. I still don't remember what time or day it was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, did you write Marina on or about the 11th of July?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have a rough draft of that date.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I hand you a document of two pages which has been\r\nidentified as Commission Exhibit No. 410.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 410 for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nWould you please tell us what that document is?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This is the rough draft, to which I just referred, written\r\nto Marina.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you thereupon prepared the final draft and sent it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This represents, does it not, your best recollection of the\r\ncontents of the letter, the letter in its final form as you transmitted\r\nit to Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think this is probably a very accurate representation of\r\nthe letter in its final form. It was the first time I put on paper an\r\ninvitation to her to come and stay with me for anything more than a few\r\nweeks around the birth of the baby.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you supplied the Commission with a translation of your\r\nletter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that appears at the bottom of page 7 of your notes\r\nwhich you have supplied to me?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I direct your attention, if I may, and the attention of\r\nthe Commission as interpreted by Mrs. Paine, the first sentence reads,\r\n\"Dear Marina, if Lee doesn't wish to live with you any more and prefers\r\nthat you go to the Soviet Union, think about the possibility of living\r\nwith me.\"\r\n\r\nYou just said--is that the portion of your letter which you say this\r\nis the first invitation you made to Marina to come to live with you\r\ngenerally?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This was the first written invitation.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I had made an informal invitation face to face when she was\r\nstaying the first week in May, but felt as I made it that she didn't\r\ntake this seriously.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, you go on in your letter and you make reference, for\r\nexample, to--let's take the second paragraph of your letter appearing\r\nat the top of page 8 of your notes, \"You know I have long received\r\nfrom my parents, I live dependent a long time. I would be happy\r\nto be an aunt to you and I can. We have sufficient money. Michael\r\nwill be glad. This I know. He just gave me $500 for the vacation or\r\nsomething necessary. With this money it is possible to pay the doctor\r\nand hospital in October when the baby is born, believe God. All will\r\nbe well for you and the children. I confess that I think that the\r\nopportunity for me to know you came from God. Perhaps it is not so but\r\nI think and believe so.\"\r\n\r\nHad you discussed this matter with your husband?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; I had.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you were still living separate and apart at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. But I felt so long as I was not yet earning, he would\r\nbe the one, in fact, who was supporting all of us.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I think the Commission might be interested in that. You\r\nwere not taking this action, either in the earlier stage in the early\r\nspring or in the summer of inviting Marina to live with you without\r\ndiscussing that with your husband even though you and your husband at\r\nthat time were separated?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you do anything, Mrs. Paine, in this connection with\r\nrespect to keeping Lee Oswald informed of your invitations and your\r\ncommunications in this area with Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I wrote into the letter that I hoped--well you might just\r\nread the last paragraph.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you mind reading it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I will read it, the last paragraph in the letter, and I\r\nmight say that the entire letter I wrote with the possibility in mind\r\nthat he should see this.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you desire that he do see it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I wanted him to--her to feel free to show it to him. I\r\ndidn't want her to come to my house if this offended or injured him, if\r\nthis was in some way----\r\n\r\n(At this point, Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Divisive?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. If he did in fact want to keep his family together, I\r\ncertainly wanted him to, but if the bulk of his feelings lay on the\r\nside of wanting to be away, separated from Marina, then I thought it\r\nwas legitimate for him to have that alternative, although it was not\r\nlegitimate for him to simply send her back if she didn't want to go.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Send her back where?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. To the Soviet Union, if she didn't want to go. So in this\r\nlight I will read the last paragraph of Commission Exhibit 410:\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to hurt Lee with this invitation to you. Only I think\r\nthat it would be better that you and he do not live together if you\r\ndo not receive happiness. I understand how Michael feels. He doesn't\r\nlove me and wants a chance to look for another life and another wife.\r\nHe must do this, it seems, and so it is better for us not to live\r\ntogether. I don't know how Lee feels. I would like to know. Surely\r\nthings are hard for him now, too. I hope that he would be glad to see\r\nyou with me where he can know that you and the children will receive\r\neverything that is necessary and he would not need to worry about it.\r\nThus he could start life again.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mrs. Paine, having all this in mind and what you have\r\ntestified to up to now, would you please tell the gentlemen of the\r\nCommission the factors and motivations you had in inviting Marina to\r\ncome live with you; first to have her baby, next on a more extended\r\nscale, all of the factors that motivated you in your offer, in your own\r\nwords?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The first invitation, just to come for a few weeks at the\r\ntime of the birth is a simpler question, I will answer that first.\r\n\r\nI felt that she would need someone simply to take care of her older\r\nchild for the time that she was in the hospital, and that things would\r\nbe easier for her if she didn't have to immediately take up the full\r\nhousehold chores upon returning from the hospital. This was a very\r\nsimple offer.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That was all that motivated you at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Now, in asking her to come and stay for a more extended\r\nperiod, I had many feelings. I was living alone with my children, at\r\nthat time, had been since the previous fall, nearly a year, at the time\r\nthis letter is written. I had no idea that my husband might move back\r\nto the house. I was tired of living alone and lonely, and here was a\r\nwoman who was alone and in a sense also, if Lee, in fact didn't want to\r\nbe with her, and further she was a person I liked. I had lived with her\r\n2 weeks in late April and early May. I enjoyed her company.\r\n\r\nFurther, being able to talk Russian with her added a wider dimension\r\nto my rather small and boring life as a young mother. I didn't want\r\nto go out and get a job because I wanted to be home with my children,\r\nbut on the other hand, I saw a way to, and that is part of what\r\nstudying Russian altogether is for me, a way to make my daily life\r\nmore interesting. I also felt when I first heard in March that Lee was\r\nwanting to send Marina back, that is how it was presented to me, that\r\nit just seemed a shame that our country couldn't be a more hospitable\r\nthing for her if she wanted so much to stay, that I thought she should\r\nhave that opportunity.\r\n\r\nI was pleased that she liked America, and thought that she should have\r\na chance to stay here and raise her children here as she wished.\r\n\r\nI might say also if I had not been living alone I would not have\r\nundertaken such an invitation. My house is small and it wouldn't have\r\ngone with married life.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I wanted to afford you that opportunity. Now, you have\r\nrelated all the factors that motivated you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibit No. 410 the\r\ndocument which has been so identified.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. It may be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to, previously marked as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n410 for identification, was received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. We have been going for an hour and a half. If you would\r\nlike to have a recess you may have it.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am all right.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. All right, we will go on then.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You mentioned in the course of your explanation earlier a\r\nseries of three letters. I hand you a draft of letter dated July 12,\r\n1963, addressed to Dear Marina, consisting of two pages, which we will\r\nmark as Commission Exhibit No. 411. And another one-page letter which\r\nwe will mark as Commission Exhibit No. 412.\r\n\r\nIn whose handwriting is each of those exhibits?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Each of these are in my handwriting.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And they are drafts, are they?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. They are.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you would then, after making those drafts put them in\r\nfinal form?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you transmit the final draft of letter to Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I mailed them to her address in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you supplied me with your translation of both of those\r\ndrafts?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Each draft is in your handwriting?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And the interpretations appearing at the bottom of page\r\n8 and the bottom of page 9 are the material you supplied me and they\r\nconsist of your interpretations of those letters or translations,\r\nrather?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right. They are dated respectively July 12 and July\r\n14.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I hand you a picture copy rather than a photostatic copy\r\nof a two-page letter dated July 14, 1963, and a translation of that\r\nletter which we will mark as Commission Exhibits Nos. 413 and 414,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 413 and\r\n414 for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Directing your attention to Exhibit 413, would you tell us\r\nwhat that is?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This appears to be a photograph of the letter I then wrote\r\nfrom my final draft and sent to Marina, dated the 14th of July.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So that Exhibit No. 413 is the----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. 413, the photograph.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. 413 is to the best of your recollection an actual picture\r\nof your final draft letter as transmitted to Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now directing your attention to page 10 of the material\r\nthat you supplied me, and which you discussed with me last evening,\r\nyou wished to make a statement to the Commission with respect to this\r\nletter, do you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Would you please proceed to do so?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think it would be easier if I read what is here.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Any way you want to handle it, Mrs. Paine.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Marina stayed with me 2 weeks in the spring as you know,\r\nand I realized then what a proud and capable person she is. She was\r\nnot accustomed to accept help from others, and I knew that her pride\r\nand independence would be a stumbling block to her accepting help even\r\nthough she needed it.\r\n\r\nI respected her for this and somehow I wanted to ease such acceptance\r\nfor her, and to explain that the situation I proposed would be a\r\nsituation of mutual help. I hoped--now I should say that in Commission\r\nExhibit----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. They are to your right on the table.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; 411 and 412, I mentioned that if she were counted as a\r\ndependent on Michael's income tax his yearly payment to the government\r\nwould be reduced by a certain amount, and that by that amount she--we\r\ncould very nearly live--her expenses could very nearly come under\r\nthis, so it would be more a case of breaking even than a case of her\r\naccepting so much as she might think from us. But I think that in fact\r\nthis reference to the tax reduction did not encourage her, as I had\r\nhoped.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It wasn't quite correct either, was it, Mrs. Paine?\r\n\r\n(Laughter.)\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Did I get a chance to read the second letter as written at\r\n2 a.m. and I was hopeful only more than----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mrs. Paine, I think the members of the Commission and also\r\nyou from our talk last night, are interested in your letters which you\r\nhave now identified suggesting financial arrangements to Mrs. Oswald,\r\nsince to one who might read them without knowing the background they\r\nmight seem crass.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I felt crass in Russian, particularly.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I was not thinking in terms of your difficulty in\r\ncommunicating with her, but you had no selfish or ulterior financial\r\nmotive, did you, in this connection?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Did it appear that?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It might.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Even with such bad arithmetic.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Your arithmetic was all right. Your interpretation of the\r\nlaw was not as good as it might be.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Am I not correct, I understood you were trying to make her\r\nfeel she was not going to be a burden to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. And were using certain subterfuges to accomplish that; that\r\nis the impression I got from what you said.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is absolutely correct. That I hoped, and further I\r\nwould say in the letters to her I made reference that this money not\r\npaid to the government would be therefore available for spending money\r\nfor her. I had put myself in her position and thought wouldn't it\r\nbe terrible to have to ask for a nickel for a package of Lifesavers\r\nevery time you wanted it, and thought I wouldn't want to be in such a\r\nsituation if she doesn't have her own, something she can count upon as\r\nher own money, it would be unbearable to her.\r\n\r\nSo I tried to cast about both for a way of making her feel that this\r\nwould not be a burden to us, and a way of getting her petty cash in the\r\npocket that she would not feel was a handout. So that it would be a\r\nlegitimate possibility for her to consider.\r\n\r\nI judge that my effort in this regard, besides the bad understanding\r\nof the tax law and the poor arithmetic, didn't help because of her\r\nfollowing letter.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is what I was coming to. Before we get to that, Mrs.\r\nPaine, I direct your attention to Commission Exhibit No. 414.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. 414?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is a translation of your letter, Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 413. Have you read that translation?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is there anything in the translation to which you might\r\ndesire to take exception or at least make a comment?\r\n\r\n(At this point Chief Justice Warren left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. One minute. Yes, it accurately reflects some of my bad\r\nRussian.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You take no exception to the translation?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think no.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chairman, if you please, I offer in evidence, Mr.\r\nDulles, may I have those exhibits----\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. They may be admitted.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. As Commission Exhibits 411, 412, 413 and 414, the documents\r\nthat had been so marked?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. They will be admitted.\r\n\r\n(The documents referred, previously marked Commission Exhibits Nos.\r\n411, 412, 413, and 414, were received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You did receive a response from Marina, did you not, Mrs.\r\nPaine?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And is the response the document now handed to you marked\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 415?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you supplied the Commission with your translation of\r\nthat letter and that translation----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. 415 is that what you said?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. 415. It appears on pages 10, 11, and 12 of the material you\r\nsupplied me.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You don't have an envelope but you have a letter.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't have an envelope. I don't know what happened to it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is the exhibit in Marina Oswald's handwriting?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is there anything on the exhibit other than that in the\r\nhandwriting of Marina Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There are a few underlinings on the page marked four.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Who placed them there?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Which are my own.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Anything else?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Except for the underlining \"he does not know\" at the very\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. \"He\" refers to whom?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Lee.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You were about to state to the Commission Marina Oswald's\r\nreaction to your series of invitations. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you proceed then?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. As reflected in this letter. This was the third letter I\r\nreceived from her after a space of over a month, and I had been very\r\nconcerned about her. I was much relieved to get it. She said she had\r\nbeen to the doctor and her condition was normal. She responded to\r\nthis series of four letters of which we have three in rough draft,\r\nsaying--shall I read in some of the things said?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. To the extent that you desire to do so. We will not read\r\nthe whole letter, it is quite long; that which is pertinent to what you\r\nhave in mind.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, that for a considerable period Lee has been good to\r\nher, she writes. He talks a lot about the coming baby.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Perhaps you might pick out--there are only about four\r\nsentences.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. \"He has become more attentive and we hardly quarrel\".\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This indicates a change somewhat in relationship and would\r\nyou please read that portion of the letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could we have the date of this letter once again?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The date of the letter. We have no date on the letter. It\r\nwas written somewhere between July 18 and July 21, which is the date of\r\nmy reply.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is how you identify it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This is 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Right. Again, \"He has become much more attentive and we\r\nhardly quarrel. True I have to give in a great deal. It could not be\r\notherwise. But if one wants peace then it is necessary to give in. We\r\nwent to the doctor, my condition is normal.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she thanks me for the invitation and thanks Michael also and says:\r\n\r\n\"I would try to take advantage of it if things really become worse, if\r\nLee becomes coarse with me again and treats me badly.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I direct your attention to the paragraph following that\r\none, Mrs. Paine.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Now another question:\r\n\r\n\"If as is possible it becomes necessary for me to come to live with\r\nyou in order to say that I am a dependent of Michael's surely it would\r\nbe necessary to have an official divorce, isn't that so? But I think\r\nLee would not agree to a divorce, and to go simply from him to become\r\na burden to you that I don't wish. Surely Michael would need to have\r\na paper showing that I am living at his expense but no one would just\r\ntake his word for it, right?\"\r\n\r\nAnd I realized much later that in the Soviet Union you don't do\r\nanything without the proper papers, and just having a person under your\r\nroof for anyone to see, having them in fact eating at your table is\r\nnot, would not be, sufficient proof--would not be sufficient there in\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. It might not be here.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It might not be here. Well, in any case I judged she felt,\r\nreading my invitations this was of some importance to me whether\r\nMichael counted her as a deduction, and so on, whereas in fact this\r\nwasn't the point at all, but that I had hoped to somehow make, if\r\npossible, for her to accept such help.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you finished your observations?\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. As a matter of fact, there are certain\r\nlimitations under our law as to how you can claim a dependent.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, I asked a few people who didn't know much about it\r\nbefore I wrote it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The tenor then of this letter was as I gather from your\r\ntestimony and as you have related to me last evening whether she would\r\ncome to live with you in the fall or generally was something which now\r\nbecame subject to reconsideration?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Pardon?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The matter of her coming to live with you, the possibility\r\nof her living with you on a more extended basis than----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Was an invitation I had made to her.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And that her response was not acceptance but one that she\r\nwould now defer?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was a \"thank you\" and a refusal basically.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you respond to that letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; I did. My letter is dated July 12.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Liebeler will mark that Commission Exhibit 416, which\r\nconsists of how many pages, Mr. Liebeler, three pages. You have that\r\nexhibit. Is that exhibit all in your handwriting?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that the draft of letter to which you have reference\r\nbeing your response to Marina's letter of----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Undated letter.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Undated letter which would be somewhere just prior to July\r\n21?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And is that a draft of letter in the same condition now as\r\nit was when you completed it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you supplied the Commission with a translation of that\r\nletter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. We will mark as Commission Exhibits 417 and 418 two\r\nexhibits, the first being a one-page exhibit entitled \"Translation from\r\nRussian\", and the second being a four page photograph of what appears\r\nto be a letter dated July 21, 1963. Directing your attention to Exhibit\r\n418.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you find it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you please identify that exhibit? It consists of four\r\npages.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It appears to be a photograph of my letter to her of July\r\n21.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Having observed it and looked at it last night, is it your\r\nbest recollection at the moment that it is a photograph of the letter\r\nthat you actually transmitted to Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Directing your attention to the next exhibit which is No.\r\n418----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. 417, you are talking about the translation.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that a translation of the letter, of your letter to her?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is far from complete.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It is far from complete?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Far from complete. It is incomplete.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I would like to have you make then, directing your\r\nattention to the translation that has been supplied us.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It goes as far as two-thirds down on page 2, you must have\r\nmore somewhere.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. No; that is all we have. Would you mark with this red\r\nmarker pen the point to which Exhibit 417 is a translation?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Here.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is the translation accurate up to that point or rather do\r\nyou have any exceptions to it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In relation to what?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. \"This would\" on the next to the last paragraph \"this would\r\noffend my father very much.\" \"This hurt my father\", no subjunctive to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do it this way. Read what is on it, what the interpreter----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Wait.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Said.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I guess that is just the interpreter trying to \"offer you\r\nan alternative\". State the question again. You want to know if I take\r\nany exception to the translation I have before me, this portion of my\r\nJuly 21 letter? They are all small.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. They are small and none of consequence.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So far as you are concerned. Your translation, however,\r\nthat you supplied the Commission is as far as you are concerned\r\naccurate and what you intend to say, at least?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; and I think it is what I said.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. I offer in evidence, if the Chairman please, the\r\ndocuments that have been marked--may I have them please, Representative\r\nFord?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. These, too?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Documents marked 415, 416, 417, and 418.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Do I understand there is not a complete translation?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Of the letter. It is an incomplete translation?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There is a page 2 somewhere.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is correct. During the noon hour I will see if that is\r\nnot a mistake and if I can be supplied with the balance, if there is a\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. They may be admitted in this form and then you can advise\r\nus after the recess whether there is anything additional to insert at\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\n(The documents referred to, heretofore marked Commission Exhibits Nos.\r\n415, 416, 417, and 418, were received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, there is a matter to which I would like to draw your\r\nattention in your letter of July 21, which is Commission Exhibit No.\r\n416, the last portion of it, and I direct your attention, in turn,\r\nto your own interpretation appearing at page 3. The last paragraph,\r\nwhen you brought Marina to New Orleans, did you do anything by way of\r\nseeking to have people in New Orleans visit her?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No. I have already testified that after an initial warm\r\ngreeting with Lee, they quarreled, and I was uncomfortable there, and\r\nwanted to get back home. I had thought of making contact for Marina\r\nwith someone in the Russian speaking community in New Orleans, and\r\nlater when I didn't hear from her after this note that looks like \"I\r\nwill have to go back to Russia after all,\" I much regretted that I had\r\nnot made some contact for her, someone she could talk to, herself.\r\nAnd anxious, not having heard from her a month from the time of this\r\nappendage to my corrected letter, I telephoned Ruth Kloepfer who is the\r\nclerk of the Quaker Meeting in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you spell her name, please?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She is not someone I know. That is spelled K-L-O-E-P-F-E-R,\r\nand I asked her if she knew any Russians in New Orleans. She did not. I\r\nthen wrote to Mrs. Paul Blanchard.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me, when you use the pronoun \"she\" there you asked\r\nMarina?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I asked Mrs. Kloepfer if she knew any Russian-speaking\r\npeople and described why I was interested in knowing. I must have given\r\nher the address of Marina, probably asked that she go and see her. In\r\nany case, I have a letter which followed that telephone call, which I\r\nwrote to Mrs. Paul Blanchard.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Pardon me, did you say you telephoned to Mrs. Blanchard or\r\nyou wrote to Mrs. Blanchard?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I wrote to Mrs. Blanchard, I had originally telephoned to\r\nMrs. Kloepfer.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you make the telephone call when you were in New\r\nOrleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; this was when I was concerned. I had not heard from\r\nMarina for a month. I did not know whether she was in good health or\r\nhad gone back to the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So you called Mrs. Kloepfer in New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is correct. After having tried to call the Murrets. I\r\nhad not had their name accurately.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. How did you happen to write to Mrs. Blanchard?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She is the secretary of the Unitarian Church in New Orleans\r\nand I called the Quaker Church in Dallas to find out who was in New\r\nOrleans of the Quakers, and then I called the Unitarian Church which my\r\nhusband belongs to in Dallas to find out who the secretary of the New\r\nOrleans Unitarian Church was.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You do not know Mrs. Blanchard?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I did not know her, and I did not know Mrs. Kloepfer\r\neither, and appended to this that I am leaving with the Commission is\r\nmy carbon of a letter to Mrs. Blanchard of the Unitarian Church, which\r\nI sent in carbon to Mrs. Kloepfer so each would know what the other was\r\ndoing in an effort to find a Russian-speaking person who could be a\r\ncontact for Marina.\r\n\r\n(At this point Representative Ford left the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mrs. Paine, you have now mentioned a letter that you wrote\r\nto Mrs. Blanchard; have you supplied the Commission with a carbon copy\r\nof that letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And it is a two-page document, Mr. Chairman, dated July 18,\r\n1963, now marked as Commission Exhibit 419. That exhibit has now been\r\nhanded to you, Mrs. Paine. Is that the carbon copy of your letter to\r\nMrs. Blanchard?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You did not know Mrs. Blanchard, had never heard of her\r\nprior to the time you wrote the letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is correct. It begins saying, \"Mrs. Philip Harper, the\r\nsecretary of the Dallas Unitarian Church, suggested I write to you when\r\nI told her of the following problem.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is the document in the same condition now as it was when\r\nyou prepared the original of which that is a carbon copy?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibit No. 419 the\r\ndocument which has been so identified.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. It may be so admitted.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked for identification as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 419 and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Will there be any difficulty that it starts with typing and\r\nthen it goes carbon?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Explain that.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I wrote two carbon paragraphs and then I thought I should\r\nwrite a carbon of this to Mrs. Blanchard and put in a carbon and then\r\nin my own copy put in typing.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So that which appears to be a copy is an original and that\r\nwhich follows, what appears to be original, is an actual carbon copy of\r\nthe letter you actually sent to Mrs. Blanchard?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. With copy stated here to Mrs. Kloepfer.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you hear from Marina on that subject at any time?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. In her succeeding and last letter that I got from her.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Her succeeding letter is dated what?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It has no date inside. It is postmarked August 11 from New\r\nOrleans and sent to me while I was on vacation.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. We have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 420 the envelope\r\nand attached to 420 is what purports to be a four-page letter in\r\nRussian longhand--may we have this as a group exhibit consisting of the\r\nenvelope and the four-page letter?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. If it is properly attached I guess you can.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There is no date on the letter, if they separate you don't\r\nknow what it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. We have marked the four-page letter as Commission Exhibit\r\n421 in order to avoid any difficulty.\r\n\r\nDirecting your attention to Exhibit 421, do you recognize the\r\nhandwriting on that exhibit?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; that is Marina Oswald's handwriting.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is a letter to you, is it not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you supplied the Commission with your translation of\r\nthat letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That appears at pages 13 and 14 of the materials you\r\nfurnished me?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that letter in the same condition now as it was when you\r\nreceived it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; with the exception of an addition in my handwriting on\r\nthe bottom of unmarked page 3.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you read that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Which is a translation of one word.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What word is that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. A word means to grow downcast.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. I didn't catch that.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. To grow downcast, to lose courage.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Directing your attention to the envelope which is marked\r\nCommission Exhibit 420.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I want to make one other comment. I underlined the word on\r\nthe second page that I have translated as \"winsome.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. W-i-n-s-o-m-e?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. The other underlinings in her letter are her own.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right. Directing your attention to the pink envelope\r\nwhich is Commission Exhibit No. 420, was Exhibit 421 enclosed in\r\nExhibit 420?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That also is in English, that is the address?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The address is in English, addressed to me while on\r\nvacation.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you received those documents in due course?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Which documents?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You received the documents in due course?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was not forwarded. It was addressed to me where I was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But you received them is all I am asking?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibits 420 and 421, the\r\ndocuments which have been so marked.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. They may be so admitted.\r\n\r\n(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 420 and\r\n421 for identification and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. There is one item in Exhibit 421 to which I wish to direct\r\nyour attention. On the last page about the third paragraph from the\r\nbottom appears the second sentence, \"Lee doesn't have work now already\r\nthree weeks.\" Do you find that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Had you had any information prior to the receipt of this\r\nletter that Lee Oswald no longer was employed in New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I had no such information.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This was your first information?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you respond to that letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I have a five-page document Mr. Liebeler is identifying as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 422.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This is not what you want. You want my reply, don't you\r\nnext?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is right.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This is not it. You have my reply but I had had no copy of\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. We will keep that exhibit number. There has been identified\r\nas Commission Exhibit 423 an exhibit consisting of four pages, the\r\nfirst three of which are a photograph of a letter, and the last page of\r\nwhich is a photograph of an envelope. Handing you Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 423, is that a picture of your letter to Marina Oswald in response\r\nto her letter of August 11?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. August 11. Yes; it is dated August 24, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you do recognize that as being a picture copy of letter\r\nyou had written?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you supplied the Commission with a translation of that\r\nletter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; I did not. I did not have this in rough draft. I had no\r\ncopy of this. You may have a translation but I do not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I supplied you only on this summary that you have with a\r\nbrief recollection of what it contained.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I now hand you a document, Commission Exhibit No. 424\r\nconsisting of two pages which purports to be a translation of Exhibit\r\n423. Did you review that translation with me last evening?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Briefly.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. To the best of your recollection at the moment of what you\r\nsaid last night that the translation is of Exhibit 423?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is approximately what I recall writing. I didn't look at\r\nthe Russian in your pictures.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. During the noon recess would you wish to look at that and\r\nif you have any exception you wish to take to the translation would you\r\nplease state it to the Commission?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. May I intervene at this point about Exhibit 422, has that\r\nbeen properly identified?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; not yet.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Could we return it to the witness? Exhibit 422 is in whose\r\nhandwriting?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is in my handwriting.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that a draft of a letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is a letter which I wrote but never sent.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You testified about that letter yesterday?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is dated April 7.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you supplied the Commission with a translation, your\r\ntranslation of that letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; I have with appropriate paragraph before it saying\r\nthat it was not sent, that I wrote it not necessarily to send or give\r\nto her but simply to have, I think as I testified yesterday, the words\r\nat my command ready in case it seemed appropriate to make such an\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And this was prepared on or about April 7, 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I would judge on the 7th.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that letter in the same condition now as it was when you\r\ncompleted writing it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have added since completing writing, I have added in\r\npencil at the top, \"not sent\" in English. It is otherwise the same.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I won't go into that further, Mr. Chairman, because the\r\nwitness did testify about it yesterday other than to offer the document\r\nin evidence.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. I simply thought it needed a little elaboration.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You were quite right, sir.\r\n\r\n(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 422 for\r\nidentification and received in evidence.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where were you in the summer of 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. May I interrupt.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Did you want to make any reference to the reference to\r\nLee's driving in Exhibit 424?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Thank you very much, Mrs. Paine, and I do want to go into\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have it underlined.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Dulles, would you be good enough to let me have it?\r\nThis translation which appears as Commission Exhibit 424, the fourth\r\nparagraph reads \"Lee told me that he learned a little from his Uncle\r\nhow to drive a car. It would be very useful for him to know how to\r\ndrive but it is hard to find time for this when he works every day.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I might make a comment about that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This is your comment, is it not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I might make a comment about that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This is your comment, is it not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I wrote that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, the Commission is very interested in the subject\r\nmatter of Mr. Oswald, of Lee Oswald being able to drive a car and\r\nI think it might be well if we covered the whole subject from the\r\nbeginning to the end.\r\n\r\nWould you give the Commission your full, most accurate recollection of\r\nthis whole subject? Start at the very beginning.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think I learned either in March or April that Lee----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Of 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This would be early in your acquaintance with him?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Very early. I learned Lee was not able to drive and didn't\r\nhave a license.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How did you learn he was not able to drive?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think it was related to his looking for work the first\r\ntime in the middle of April, and I had learned he had looked in the\r\nDallas area for work.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How did you learn it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. We were talking about it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You were talking with Lee?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he tell you that he was not able to drive a car?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That he had never learned how.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That he had difficulty in getting around?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Simply he had never learned how.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He said this to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. And I felt immediately that his job opportunities, the\r\njobs to which he could have applied, and the jobs to which he could get\r\nhimself would be greatly broadened if he were able to drive and said so.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You said that to him?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And said that to him. Then when we arrived in New Orleans\r\nhe said to me by way of almost pride that he had been allowed by his\r\nuncle to drive his uncle's car.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is Mr. Murret?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I don't know whether there was more than one.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But he volunteered the statement to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And it was something that had occurred after he had gotten\r\nto New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And he was in a sense pleased to report to me that he was\r\ngetting some experience driving. That his uncle had permitted him to\r\ndrive the car on the street.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On the street?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. On the street.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you have occasion while you were in New Orleans to\r\nverify that in any respect whatsoever?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Or have it verified to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This was confined to a remark that he made to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right. Then when I learned in Marina's letter of\r\nAugust 11 that Lee was out of work, I immediately thought it would\r\nbe well for him to make use of those free weekdays, not only for job\r\nhunting but for learning the skill of driving and, therefore, that\r\nparagraph--shall we read it?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Haven't I already read it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You mean from your letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Did you read that?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The paragraph \"Lee told me that he learned a little from\r\nhis uncle how to drive a car.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you read that \"It would be very useful for him to know\r\nhow to drive but it is hard to find time for this when he works every\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\nJust to be certain of this, Mrs. Paine, this was a remark made to you\r\nby Lee Harvey Oswald when you brought Marina from Irving, Tex., to New\r\nOrleans, and----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The second week in May.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The second week in May of 1963. And then, according to the\r\nremark made to you by Lee Harvey Oswald that his uncle had permitted\r\nhim to drive his uncle's car on the street in New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; and he was proud of this.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he ask at that time or any time while you were in New\r\nOrleans in the spring to drive your car?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there any discussion at all during--did you have the\r\nfeeling that he would like to drive the car?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There was no discussion of it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he demonstrate to you that he could drive?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There was no discussion of it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You have given us all that occurred in New Orleans by\r\nway of conversation or otherwise on the subject of Lee Harvey Oswald\r\ndriving an automobile or his ability to drive?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, you are telling us the whole story on this subject. So\r\nwhen next----\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask this one question?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Did Lee Oswald identify the uncle who permitted him to\r\ndrive his car?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Senator Cooper, he did not. He just said his uncle. He did\r\nnot identify his uncle by name.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Do you know of your own knowledge who the uncle was?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I can only assume.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. What?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I can only assume it was the uncle he had been staying\r\nwith. He had been staying at his home.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You had met the uncle at this time?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Just met him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So it was the uncle with whom he had been staying just\r\nbefore he obtained the apartment at Magazine?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. What is the uncle's name?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Dutz Murret. This was the relative who had the nice home\r\nthat Marina first saw when she arrived there and thought maybe that is\r\nwhere she was going to live, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Go ahead, Mrs. Paine.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. You want all other references to driving?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Confining yourself to his ability to drive automobiles,\r\nwhen next, and take it in chronological order as to when you next\r\nrecall it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It came up next after he returned to the Dallas area in\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When was that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. After he returned on the 4th, to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The 4th of October?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That was the first I know.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. We will get into the reasons and the circumstances but you\r\nstick with the automobile incidents.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He was looking for work.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In Dallas?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. In the Dallas area and again, of course, I felt that he\r\ncould find more jobs, be eligible for more if he could drive.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did you do about it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I recalled that I had a copy of the regulations for\r\ndriving, what you need to know to pass the written test.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In what State?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. In the State of Texas, and I gave him that booklet.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you have a discussion with him about your desire, your\r\nrecommendation, that he qualify to drive an automobile in Texas so it\r\nwould assist him in connection with his job hunting.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Probably. We certainly had conversation about it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Give us the subject of the conversation in terms of\r\nrecommendations by you, or what did you say?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I again recommended, as I had in the spring, that he learn\r\nto drive.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did he say?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He was interested in learning to drive.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he say anything to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I would like to offer to the Commission something we didn't\r\nget to last night.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Which is a letter I wrote to my mother, which she just\r\nshowed me recently, she just found it recently, which makes reference\r\nto the date I first gave him a lesson in driving.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That would be helpful to us. May I have the letter, please?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. Now only a portion of it is applicable.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Why don't we give it a number?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Another portion is applicable in another connection, which\r\nI would like especially to bring up.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Having that in mind, we will give that document for\r\nidentification at the moment only, the number Commission Exhibit No.\r\n425.\r\n\r\nI won't identify it beyond that for the moment because the witness will\r\nbe using it to refresh her recollection.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I will read what applies here.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are now reading from Commission Exhibit No. 425.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Which is a letter dated October 14, in my hand, from me to\r\nmy mother.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Would you give your mother's name?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Her name is Mrs. Carol Hyde.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Where does she live?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. In Columbus, Ohio. It was likely written to Oberlin, where\r\nshe was a student at that time.\r\n\r\n\"If Lee can just find work that will help so much. Meantime I started\r\ngiving him driving lessons last Sunday (yesterday). If he can drive\r\nthis will open up more job possibilities and more locations.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I want to comment too on the nature of this lesson.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The Commission will be interested in that but you go ahead.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Now?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Go right ahead.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I knew that he had not even a learner's permit to drive. I\r\nwasn't interested in his driving on the street with my car until he had\r\nsuch. But on Sunday the parking lot of a neighboring shopping center\r\nwas empty, and I am quite certain that is where the driving lesson took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is your best present recollection?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. Now I recall this also, and it is significant. I\r\noffered him a lesson and intended to drive him to this area for him to\r\npractice. He, however, started the car.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He got in and started the car?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He got in and started the car so that I know he was able to\r\ndo that and wanted to drive on the street to the parking lot.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He wanted to?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He wanted to. I said, \"My father is an insurance man and he\r\nwould never forgive me.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Your father?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. My father. And insisted that he get a learner's permit\r\nbefore he would drive on the street.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. At that moment and at that time he acted, in any event in\r\nyour presence, as though he himself thought----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He would be capable of driving an automobile from your home\r\nto the parking area in which you were about to give him a lesson. That\r\nwas your full impression, was it not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. I should add that, as I am recalling, he did drive a\r\nportion of the way, he drove in fact, it is about three blocks, to the\r\nparking lot. I was embarrassed to just tell him \"No, don't.\" But I did,\r\nin, effect, on the way there, when he was on the street, driving on the\r\nstreet in my car, when we got there I said, \"Now, I am going to drive\r\nback.\" I didn't want him to.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. From your home to the parking lot?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The first time before we had any lesson at all. And at that\r\ntime I made it clear I didn't want him to drive in the street. Also,\r\nit became clear to me in that lesson that he was very unskilled in\r\ndriving. We practiced a number of the things you need to know, to back\r\nup, to turn, right angle turn to come to a stop.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was this on the parking lot?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This was all on a parking lot.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did I understand you to say he drove three blocks, was that\r\nall the way to the parking lot? So he drove all the way to the parking\r\nlot?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Perhaps a little longer. But a short distance, whatever it\r\nwas, to the parking lot, yes. Rather than stopping in midstreet and\r\nchanging drivers. Going to turn a right angle----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. How well did he do on that?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. That is what she is telling.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; that is a separate answer.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She is talking about the parking lot.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I was very nervous while he was doing it and was not at\r\nall happy about his doing it. I would say he did modestly well; but no\r\nmeans skilled in coming to a stop and turning a square right angle at a\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there much traffic?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No. But then too, I noticed when we got to the parking lot\r\nwhen he attempted to turn in a right angle he made the usual mistake of\r\na beginner of turning too much and then having to correct it. He was\r\nnot familiar with the delay of the steering wheel in relation to the\r\nwheels, actual wheels of the power----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was it power----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was not power steering. But it has no clutch so that\r\nmakes it a lot easier to drive.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is an automatic transmission?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is an automatic transmission.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Describe your automobile, will you please?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is a 1955 Chevrolet station wagon, green, needing paint,\r\nwhich we bought secondhand. It is in my name.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. But automatic transmission?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Automatic transmission; yes.\r\n\r\nThen, in the later lessons, I think there were altogether three with\r\nLee----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you finished with this lesson on the Sunday morning,\r\nwas it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; it was a Sunday afternoon and I drove back to the house.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How long did the lesson take on the parking lot?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Oh, 20 minutes, perhaps. I will say of him that he set for\r\nhimself tasks; a good student in the sense that he planned now I am\r\ngoing to back up this way and I am going--one of the problems is to\r\nturn around and go the other way on the street. In other words----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. U-turn.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is not a U-turn, no. It is a narrower one to head in\r\nback up and go the other way and he would set this problem for himself,\r\nhow to do it, back up and do it, and set the problem of backing up,\r\ndriving, going back, I mean. And set himself a course. I was doing\r\nthis, too, but I was interested in the eagerness he had and his desire\r\nto achieve; desire to do this and do it well.\r\n\r\nIn helping himself by setting up these course plans, you could almost\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right.\r\n\r\nWould you refresh my recollection of the date this occurred?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. My letter is dated the 14th. I say, \"I taught him\r\nyesterday, Sunday.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Fourteenth of October?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Fourteenth of October. So that would have been----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That would have been October 7?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Thirteenth.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. May I ask a question here?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Senator Cooper has a question.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. On the occasion when you drove with him, did you find\r\nit necessary to show him how to turn on the ignition?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; I did not.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. How to take steps to start the car and put it in motion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No, indeed; he had started it before I came out or else he\r\nwouldn't have been in the driver's seat because I didn't want him to\r\ndrive on the street. So he had the car ready to go; backed out with a\r\nconsiderable bump.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He backed out of the driveway?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am recalling this now, I think so. I recall that he then\r\ndidn't attempt to go, I didn't let him, but at one point we practiced\r\nparking on the street in front of my house.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This was a subsequent occasion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This was a subsequent occasion. But when the lesson was\r\ndone he gradually let me turn the car into the driveway. This is\r\nharder and I was glad to do it and he was glad to be relieved of that\r\nrequirement.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Mr. Chairman, I don't want to interrupt this line\r\nof inquiry, but I have to go to a meeting at the Speaker's office and\r\nI can't be back this afternoon, and I wonder if I might ask Mrs. Paine\r\nseveral questions?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. By all means.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Not particularly in this line.\r\n\r\nWhere did you first meet Marina. I know you told us.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. She testified to that yesterday.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Tell me briefly.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. At a party of people at the end of February 1963.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. How long was it thereafter that she moved into\r\nyour home for the first time?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She first came on the 24th of April.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. And she lived there for 2 weeks?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. And her husband lived here--her husband was with\r\nher?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No. He had already gone on to New Orleans.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. When did she return to your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She came with me from New Orleans, leaving there the 23d of\r\nSeptember and arriving in Irving the 24th of September.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. And she lived with you in Irving from the 24th of\r\nSeptember until the 23d?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The morning of the 23d.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Of November?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She left the morning of the 23d, she left expecting to come\r\nback.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. During that period of time did Lee Oswald live\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. He visited there on weekends?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He visited there on weekends.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. How well did you know Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Insufficiently well.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, I regret, of course, very deeply that I didn't\r\nperceive him as a violent man.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You saw no evidence of violence in him at any\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No, I didn't. He argued with his wife but he never struck\r\nher. I never heard from her of any violence from him.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did he ever express any hostility toward anyone\r\nwhile he was talking with you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Not of a violent or----\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did he ever express any political opinions to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes, he called himself a Marxist. He said that on the\r\noccasion after Stevenson had been in town in relation to the United\r\nNations Day.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Adlai Stevenson?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Adlai Stevenson, and Lee had been to a meeting of the\r\nNational Indignation Committee held another night that week, and he was\r\nat our home the following Friday night and commented that he didn't\r\nlike General Walker.\r\n\r\nThis is the only thing I heard from him on the subject.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did he ever express any violence toward General\r\nWalker?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did he ever discuss President Kennedy with you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He never mentioned Kennedy at all.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did you see the rifle that he had in the room in\r\nyour home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. In the garage, no.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. In the garage, you never saw one?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I never saw that rifle at all until the police showed it to\r\nme in the station on the 22d of November.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Were you at home when the FBI interviewed Marina\r\nand Lee?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The FBI never interviewed Marina and me; I was waiting to\r\nhear your question.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. At your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The FBI never interviewed Marina and Lee at my home. The\r\nFBI was there one afternoon and talked to Marina through me; they never\r\nsaw Lee Oswald in my home. I told them he would be there on a weekend.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did you ever discuss politics with Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. As close as we would come, I would say, would be what I\r\nhave mentioned about Madam Nhu; she was interested in what the family\r\nwould do. She also said to me that she thought Khrushchev was a rather\r\ncoarse, country person. She said that she admired Mrs. Kennedy a great\r\ndeal, and liked, this is all before, liked President Kennedy very much.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This was all before November 22?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Were you aware of the fact that Lee returned to\r\nyour home the night before the assassination?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Were you curious about that in view of the fact\r\nthat he seldom came except on weekends?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was the first time he had come without asking permission\r\nto come. He came after he and his wife had quarreled, and Marina and I\r\nsaid to one another, we took this to be as close as he could come to an\r\napology, and an effort to make up.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. That was the reason you thought he had come?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. But I didn't inquire of him.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You did not know that the next morning when he\r\nleft he had a rifle?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did you see him when he left that morning?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No, I didn't.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Have you been active in politics yourself?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; I vote. And I am a member of the League of Women\r\nVoters, that is the extent of my activity.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Do you belong to any other political\r\norganizations?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Have you ever belonged?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Are you, I don't know quite how to state this\r\nquestion, are you a practicing Quaker?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am. I am also a pacifist.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You are a pacifist?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You are not a Marxist?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; they don't go together, in fact. You can't believe\r\nviolent overthrow and be a pacifist.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Did you know Norman Thomas quite well?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. When I was 8 I went to a rally of Norman Thomas in New York\r\nCity. That was my only contact.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Is your feeling towards Marina, shall I say in\r\nthe Quaker spirit of friendship and hospitality, was that the main\r\nobjective, plus the intellectual?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I was interested in the language.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Intellectual stimulation of the language.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. I found that while living with her, I could say that\r\nthis day, at least added something to what I knew, what I--I learned a\r\nfew more words.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You never formed any opinion about Lee Oswald as\r\na person?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I formed many, and I would like to make that a special area.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Would you just tell me just in a sentence or two,\r\nI know you could go into it in greater detail, but was your opinion\r\nfavorable? Was it unfavorable, or what?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I disliked him actively in the spring when I thought he\r\njust wanted to get rid of his wife and wasn't caring about her, wasn't\r\nconcerned whether she would go to the doctor. I then found him much\r\nnicer, I thought, when I saw him next in New Orleans in late September,\r\nand this would be a perfectly good time to admit the rest of the\r\npertinent part of this letter to my mother written October 14, because\r\nit shows something that I think should be part of the public record,\r\nand I am one of the few people who can give it, that presents Lee\r\nOswald as a human person, a person really rather ordinary, not an ogre\r\nthat was out to leave his wife, and be harsh and hostile to all that he\r\nknew.\r\n\r\nBut in this brief period during the times that he came out on weekends,\r\nI saw him as a person who cared for his wife and his child, tried to\r\nmake himself helpful in my home, tried to make himself welcome although\r\nhe really preferred to stay to himself.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't much to take up a conversation. This says, \"Dear Mom,\" this\r\nis from Commission Exhibit No. 425, \"Lee Oswald is looking for work in\r\nDallas. Did my last letter say so? Probably not. He arrived a week and\r\na half ago and has been looking for work since. It is a very depressing\r\nbusiness for him, I am sure. He spent last weekend and the one before\r\nwith us here and was a happy addition to our expanded family. He played\r\nwith Chris\"--my 3-year-old, then 2--\"watched football on the TV, planed\r\ndown the doors that wouldn't close, they had shifted and generally\r\nadded a needed masculine flavor\"----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Wait a second.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. \"And generally added a needed masculine flavor. From a poor\r\nfirst impression I have come to like him. We saw the doctor at Parkland\r\nHospital last Friday and all seems very healthy\" and this refers to\r\nMarina. \"It appears that charges will be geared to their ability to\r\npay.\"\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Were you----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. May I go on?\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Yes; surely. Finish.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This was an intervening section where he was the most human\r\nthat I saw him, and, of course, it has been followed by my anger with\r\nhim, and all the feeling that most of us have about his act. But it\r\nseems to me important, very important, to the record that we face the\r\nfact that this man was not only human but a rather ordinary one in many\r\nrespects, and who appeared ordinary.\r\n\r\nIf we think that this was a man such as we might never meet, a great\r\naberration from the normal, someone who would stand out in a crowd as\r\nunusual, then we don't know this man, we have no means of recognizing\r\nsuch a person again in advance of a crime such as he committed.\r\n\r\nThe important thing, I feel, and the only protection we have is to\r\nrealize how human he was though he added to it this sudden and great\r\nviolence beyond----\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You have no doubt about the fact that he\r\nassassinated President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have no present doubt.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Do you have any reason to believe he was\r\nassociated with anyone else in this act or it was part of a conspiracy?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have no reason to believe he was associated with anyone.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did you ever see him talking with anyone else, in\r\nconversation with anybody else or get mail at your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I never saw him talking with anyone else. He received all\r\nhis mail from home, third class for the most part perhaps one letter\r\nfrom Russia.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did he have telephone calls at your home of a\r\nmysterious nature?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me, did he ever have a telephone call at your home\r\nmysterious or otherwise?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; never.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. You then would be surprised if he were part of\r\nany group?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I would be very surprised. For one thing, I judged, I\r\nhad to wonder whether this man was a spy or someone dangerous to our\r\nNation. He had been to the Soviet Union and he had come back and he\r\ndidn't go as a tourist. He went by his own admission intending to\r\nbecome a Soviet citizen and then came back.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What about Marina--go ahead and finish.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Then the FBI came, as I thought they well might, interested\r\nin this man who had been to the Soviet Union, and I felt that if he had\r\nassociations this would be very easy for them to know. I didn't see\r\nany, but would tend to point to the possibility of his being a spy or\r\nsubversive. But I didn't see any such and I felt happy that they were\r\ncharged with the responsibility of knowing about it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did you see any indication of any connection of\r\nMarina with any group that might be considered unusual?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; no one called her.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Did she have any letters?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She received a letter from a friend in the Soviet Union\r\nwhich she showed to me and mentioned to me.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Was this just a normal letter?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Girl friend.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. What is your present relationship with Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I have seen her once since the assassination. That was a\r\nweek ago Monday. It was the first time since the morning of the 23d\r\nwhen she left my house, both of us expecting she would come back to it\r\nthat evening. In the intervening period I wrote her a collection of\r\nletters trying to determine what her feelings were and whether it was\r\nsuitable for me to write and see her.\r\n\r\nI am presently confused, as I was then, as to how to best be a friend\r\nto her. I don't know what is appropriate in this situation.\r\n\r\nBy that I mean during the time I was writing the letters to her and not\r\ngetting an answer when she was with Mr. Martin.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Was your conversation last Monday friendly?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you, Mrs. Paine.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Might I ask one question?\r\n\r\nYou said that Lee had mentioned General Walker and indicated that he\r\ndidn't like General Walker. Can you elaborate on that a little bit, to\r\nwhat extent, how violent was he in his expression?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; it wasn't violent at all. It was more of, oh, well,\r\nmore not giving him much credit even, but it was done briefly, this\r\nwas in passing, so my recollection is hazy. But certainly there was no\r\nstrong expression.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. No vehemence about it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Absolutely not, I would have remembered that. And I recall\r\nthat Marina said nothing.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You mentioned that Lee did not receive any calls at your\r\nhouse. Did he make any telephone calls?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I heard him call what he said was the \"Time.\" You know, he\r\ndialed, listened and hung up, and then he told us what time it was.\r\nThat is all his social contact.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. This is only on one occasion that he spoke of General\r\nWalker?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Just that one in my hearing, apropos of a discussion that\r\nwas already begun.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. We have rather interrupted the sequence of your questioning.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is all right.\r\n\r\nRepresentative BOGGS. There is one item I might bring out along the\r\nline you were inquiring about.\r\n\r\nYou gave some consideration, did you not, Mrs. Paine, during this\r\nperiod, as to whether Mr. Oswald, Lee Harvey Oswald, could or might\r\nhave been a Russian agent.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And we discussed this yesterday, as I recall?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Briefly.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And what conclusions did you come to on that score and why?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I thought that he was not very intelligent. I saw as far as\r\nI could see he had no particular contacts. He was not a person I would\r\nhave hired for a job of any sort, no more than I would have let him\r\nborrow my car.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you give consideration in that connection? Did his\r\nlevel of intelligence affect your judgment as to whether the Russian\r\nGovernment would have hired him?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How did it affect you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I doubted they would have hired him. I kept my mind open on\r\nit to wonder.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you had doubt why?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Simply because he had gone to the Soviet Union and\r\nannounced that he wanted to stay, and then came back, and I wasn't\r\nconvinced that he liked America.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did your judgment of him, and as to his level of\r\nintelligence, affect your decision ultimately that the Russian\r\nGovernment might not or would not have hired him because he was not a\r\nman of capacity to serve in such a way for the Russian Government?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes; that affected my judgment.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Have you any idea as to his motivation in the act, in light\r\nof what you have said in the assassination?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It is conjecture, of course, but I feel he always felt\r\nhimself to be a small person; and he was right. That he wanted to be\r\ngreater, or noticed, and Marina had said of him he thinks he is so big\r\nand fine, and he should take a more realistic view of himself and not\r\nbe so conceited.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Representative Ford entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And I feel that he acted much more from the emotional\r\npushings within him than from any rational set of ideas, and----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Emotional pushings toward aggrandizement you have in mind\r\nis what you said?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. When you testified earlier this morning, Mrs. Paine, about\r\nthe dry sighting of the rifle, you know what dry sighting is, don't you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I found out last night.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. You found that out last night?\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. Tell her to describe it then.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Shall I try to describe it? See if I know? It involves\r\nholding the rifle and as if to fire and pulling the trigger, but\r\nwithout any ammunition in it. Going through the motions and, therefore,\r\nwiggling it and having to resight it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Going through the motions?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Of ejecting something.\r\n\r\nSenator COOPER. A dry run.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Is that sufficient, Senator?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Do I understand it?\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. That is a pretty good description, it is just as well as I\r\ncan give.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. You actually saw him doing this?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No, he showed me last night how it was done.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. We had testimony this morning whether he had an opportunity\r\nto dry sight the rifle in his New Orleans house.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I was just discussing what would be visible in the front of\r\nhis house.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. We were having some testimony, Representative Ford, of Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald's dry sighting of the rifle when he was in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Marina so testified when she was here.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. You don't purport to say it was impossible for him to do it\r\nwithout observation but it was difficult.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was difficult.\r\n\r\nMy then 2-year-old boy found a number of boys with trucks to play with\r\nright on that immediate driveway or alley as it is marked on the paper\r\nand small boys would have been very interested and they went right by\r\nthere and Marina complained that Junie couldn't get her nap because\r\nthere were so many children.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. He could have done it very early in the morning without\r\nobservation?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Have you any idea generally how Lee Oswald used his time, I\r\nmean when you weren't observing him when he wasn't at your house? Did\r\nhe talk, tell you how he used his time? Did he use it on television?\r\nWhat I am trying to get at is--is there a great deal of time he had\r\navailable to him that there is no way of knowing what he did. But did\r\nhe talk about that, did he give you an idea of what he was, how he\r\noccupied himself, reading, television?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Talking just about the time after October 4 when he was----\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes; let's take it in that period.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I knew he was occupied with looking for a job.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. How much of the day this occupied him, of course, I didn't\r\nknow. I didn't see him. Then he got the job, and I judge that occupied\r\nhim more fully. He spoke of one evening meeting he went to, this\r\nNational Indignation Committee meeting.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What about other evenings? Do you know anything about other\r\nevenings when he wasn't with you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Except for the one in which he accompanied my husband to a\r\nCivil Liberties Union meeting.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Did you, at any stage of your life while you were, whether\r\nliving with your husband or apart from him, did you ever contemplate\r\ninviting anyone to come and live with you in anything like the manner\r\nin which you did invite Marina?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. My mother completed her studies at Oberlin College in\r\nFebruary, and we talked----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. February 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; just now, February of 1964 and we talked about the\r\npossibility as long ago as last summer of 1963, we talked about the\r\npossibility of her coming and staying for several months. I said I was\r\ntired of living alone. This is not exactly comparable, but it also is a\r\nsearch for a roommate.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. But apart from your mother, there was no one similarly\r\nsituated to Marina, whom you thought of inviting to live with you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No one situated similarly that I knew either.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. No; you didn't invite anyone?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Didn't make any other such invitation.\r\n\r\nMr. McCLOY. Anyone to live with you.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Before returning to the automobile and somewhat along the\r\ntail end at least of Representative Boggs' inquiries of you, did you\r\never give any consideration, Mrs. Paine, to the possibility that Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald might have been employed by some agency of the Government\r\nof the United States?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I never gave that any consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. None whatsoever?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. None whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It never occurred to you at any time?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It never occurred to me at any time.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is all on that.\r\n\r\nWas the absence of its occurring to you based on your overall judgment\r\nof Lee Harvey Oswald and his lack, as you say, of, not a highly\r\nintelligent man?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. There was some reason why you gave it no thought, is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That, and he was not in a position to know anything of use\r\nto either Government. I am questioning myself.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you please elaborate?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. As regards he might be a Soviet agent, what does this\r\nman know that would be of interest to anybody or what could you find\r\nout, and you judge he didn't know anything that the Soviets might\r\nbe interested in, and, as I say, I never gave it any thought of the\r\npossibility of his being employed by this Government.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, Representative Ford, Mrs. Paine had been relating to\r\nus her experiences with Lee Harvey Oswald with respect to his ability\r\nto operate an automobile, and she has up to this moment revealed some\r\nthings to us which we had not known of and it is something that is\r\ncausing the staff considerable concern. This is his ability to drive\r\nwhich is a proper connection with his visit to Mexico in some one or\r\ntwo instances and also his escape or his attempted escape and other\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nWe interrupted the chronology to have Mrs. Paine state fully everything\r\nshe knows on this particular subject.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. It is important.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. If we can recall just about where you were because I\r\nwould like to have you pick it up just exactly where you were in this\r\nchronology.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I had about completed the full statement of what I saw of\r\nhis driving.\r\n\r\nI will pick up by repeating when he turned a right angle corner\r\nhe would turn too far and have to correct. I will complete now by\r\ndescribing my teaching him to park.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was this on that same Sunday afternoon?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There were, I think, three altogether, but I am not\r\ncertain. This is the only particular reference.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me, but I think, Mr. Chairman, Representative Ford,\r\nMrs. Paine has related to us something we had not known, that this\r\nSunday afternoon----\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. October 13.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. October 13, when she sought to instruct Lee Harvey Oswald\r\non the local parking lot--was it by a shopping center?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That he had gotten into the car, in the driveway, with the\r\nkey, and had turned on the motor of the car, had backed it up into the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. And then proceeded to drive to the shopping center.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. With Mrs. Paine.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. While I complained.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mrs. Paine complaining because she was concerned; she is\r\nthe daughter of an insurance actuary.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. In my complaint I simply said that I would drive back, and\r\nthat I didn't want him to drive on the street, but I didn't insist that\r\nhe stop at that moment.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I recall one other afternoon when he practiced just parking\r\ndirectly in front of our house, and when, as I say, after he had done\r\nthis he wanted me to drive the car into the driveway, that being a\r\nlittle harder to do.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Where did you keep your car ordinarily, in the driveway?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Always in the driveway in front of our house; the garage\r\nitself is too full of many other things.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you leave the key in the car?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I never leave the key in the car; I always lock it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That was your habit with respect to the ignition key?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I always lock the car and leave the ignition key in my\r\npurse.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You never leave the ignition key around your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, my purse was in the home.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So it was not in the open?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He had to go in the purse, never. Just how he got the car\r\nstarted, I recall my shock that he had. But I must have laid out the\r\nkey or something because I did not intend for him to start it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You didn't give him the key on that occasion to go out and\r\nstart the motor?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Absolutely not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But when you came out of the house he had already started\r\nthe motor and backed the car into the street?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No, no; I let him back it out.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You did?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I was deciding what I was going to do.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. You were in the car at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes, I had gotten in the car at that time.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. And he was in the driver's seat?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was he in the driver's seat when you came out of the house?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is my recollection. Then, referring now to the\r\npractice of his parking.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me, Representative Ford, the witness had also\r\nrelated to us, which we had not known, when she came to New Orleans in\r\nthe spring to bring Marina from Irving to New Orleans, that Lee Harvey\r\nOswald told her that he had driven his uncle's car, one of the Murrets,\r\nin New Orleans on the street.\r\n\r\nGo ahead.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Perhaps I should say that I have been absent for\r\na half hour or so attending a very important committee meeting, so I\r\ndidn't get this story from the outset and I appreciate being brought up\r\nto date on it.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There were two occasions when we practiced parking, one in\r\nthe larger parking lot just backing into, pretending there were cars\r\nthere to back between, as in parallel parking, and another occasion\r\ndirectly in front of my house. On this second occasion directly in\r\nfront of my house he finally learned how to do it. He had had a bad\r\ntime, getting his wheels too cramped and not getting in, and getting\r\nhis wheels straightened out, a beginner's mistakes.\r\n\r\nFinally, I got into the car and told him when to start reversing the\r\ntwist on his wheel and cramp, and he said, so soon. It was a surprise.\r\nIt didn't feel to him it was time already to start coming out of the\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw that it was when he then got into the parking place\r\ncorrectly, and quite soon got the feel of it but this was clearly his\r\nfirst experience doing it right, and then he practiced doing it right\r\nseveral times, and he learned quite well, I thought.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Chief Justice Warren entered the hearing room.)\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. On these subsequent occasions did he ask you to\r\nhelp him or did he take the keys and do it on his own initiative?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No, he never took the keys. I offered to give him--give\r\nLee lessons on Sunday afternoons and we managed to do it a few Sunday\r\nafternoons, I think three altogether and there were a couple of\r\nweekends when we didn't get the lesson in, something intervened.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. This was in October of 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. October and November. I think the last lesson was November\r\n10, being the last Sunday.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. What progress did he make over that period?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Considerable.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Reasonable progress?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Very reasonable progress. I thought he learned well, as\r\nI have said, both backing and to make a right-angle turn, and really\r\nbegan to understand the feeling of parking.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Did he indicate to you when he might apply for a\r\ndriver's license?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. Oh, yes. Thank you. It is a whole new section.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I was about to go into that.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. There was some testimony on that point, I believe.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Mr. Frazier testified that Oswald mentioned to him\r\nthat he was going to or had, I am not sure which, and I was wondering\r\nwhether he mentioned it to you?\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Got in line.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes, on November 9, which was election day, Saturday, in\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This was the weekend he was home?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This was the weekend that he was home, which was the last\r\nweekend he was home, don't call it home though.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I am sorry. It was the last weekend that he was at your\r\nhome?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And he arrived the previous day, evening or late afternoon?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now starting with that Friday afternoon, please relate the\r\ncourse of events?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, I will say that we went Saturday morning to a station\r\nin Dallas where you can take the written test and eye test that permits\r\nyou to get a learner's permit, but when we got there--that is all\r\nof us, children, Lee, Marina and myself, driving in my car to Oak\r\nCliff--when we got there it was closed, being election day. I hadn't\r\nthought, realized that this would mean it would be closed. So we\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nThe next weekend----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Excuse me, before you reach that.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Are you reasonably certain that he came home or came to\r\nIrving the previous afternoon?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Certainly.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Perhaps to refresh your recollection, do you remember a\r\nweekend in which Lee Harvey Oswald called from Dallas and said to\r\nMarina that he would not be in that Friday afternoon because he was\r\ngoing to do some job hunting the next morning, and that he would come\r\nthe next day? Could it be that this was that weekend?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Well, he had already had a job that weekend, didn't he?\r\nSo he wouldn't have been job hunting. I recall he was there in the\r\nmorning, Saturday morning.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Looking for another job?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Oh, well, no.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You don't recall any discussion of his being dissatisfied\r\nwith the job at the Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And was undertaking to look for another job?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. There is no discussion?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. There is one Saturday that he came out later but that\r\nwas still in October. It was the second weekend that he came out,\r\naltogether he came out on the weekend of the 4th, so he would have come\r\nout on October 12, Saturday. It doesn't check with my recollection.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So just to make sure, it is your present recollection that\r\nyou can recall no occasion when you were advised by Marina or directly\r\nthat Lee Harvey Oswald called and said he would not be in on that\r\nparticular Friday but would come the next day?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I would be quite certain it was not that weekend. It is\r\npossible that this happened, I don't recall any discussion, nor did I\r\nhave any idea that there had been any occasion when he had to look for\r\na different job.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Never any discussion on that subject?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Never.\r\n\r\nJust to complete the discussion of automobile driving, I will go on to\r\nthe next weekend then when he did not come out to my house, but I----\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. That would be the weekend of the 18th?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Just prior to the assassination. The 16th I was having a\r\nbirthday party for my little girl and said I couldn't possibly take him\r\nagain to this place so he could take a test. But that he didn't need a\r\ncar. This was news to him. He thought he needed a car for his initial\r\ntest, learner's permit. I said he could go himself from Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This was a conversation between you and Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How did it take place?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It must have been by phone.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he call you or did you call him?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He called to the house nearly every night around 5:30 to\r\ntalk to Marina. And Marina suggested to him that he wouldn't, shouldn't\r\ncome out that weekend because I was having a birthday party and it had\r\nbeen a long weekend, the prior weekend. She didn't want him to wear out\r\nhis welcome, and then I said to him he could still try to get----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You did talk with him on the telephone?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is my recollection. I am certain that I talked with\r\nhim, that he was surprised that he didn't need a car. I had to tell him\r\nthat he didn't need a car to take with him to take his test.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Take his initial test?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Take his test, and suggested that he go from Dallas himself\r\nto take this test. Then he called us Saturday afternoon of the 16th to\r\nsay he had been and tried to get his driver's permit but that he had\r\narrived before closing time but still too late to get in because there\r\nwas a long line ahead of him, the place having been closed both the\r\nprevious Saturday for election day and the following Monday, the 11th,\r\nVeterans Day. There were a lot of people who wanted to get permits and\r\nhe was advised that it wouldn't pay him to wait in line. He didn't have\r\ntime to be tested.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Could you help us fix, can you recall as closely as\r\npossible the day of the week, this is the weekend of the assassination,\r\nwas it not?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. The weekend before.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The weekend before, and this conversation you are now\r\nrelating that you had with him in which he said that he had gone to\r\nthe driver's license station, when did that conversation with you take\r\nplace?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That conversation was with Marina, and she told me about it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When did she tell you about it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He called her, it must have been Saturday afternoon, soon\r\nafter he had been, he went Saturday morning and they closed at noon.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. This was the weekend he did not come out to Irving?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This was the weekend he did not come out.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The weekend in which you had your birthday party for your\r\nson was it?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. It was either that same afternoon or it was possibly\r\nSunday, I don't recall. It is important though. I wish I could recall\r\nwhen his call to her was. Since it relates to the problem of when I\r\ndialed his number.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Chairman, I have marked as Commission Exhibit No. 426\r\na form or document which purports to be a driver's permit or driver's\r\nlicense permit application by Lee Harvey Oswald. It is a one-page form\r\ndocument on heavy board, or at least heavy paper.\r\n\r\nAre you familiar sufficiently with the handwriting or handprinting\r\nof Lee Harvey Oswald to be able to tell us whether the writing and\r\nhandprinting on that document is or is not Lee Harvey Oswald's?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I am not sufficiently familiar. I can simply compare it\r\nwith the only other thing I have seen in his printing which is what he\r\nwrote down in my diary.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Refreshing your recollection in that respect and looking at\r\nthe exhibit, if you are able to do so, would you give us your opinion\r\nas to whether the exhibit is in the handwriting or handprinting of Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. I think it very likely is.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In your short talk with Lee Harvey Oswald on the subject of\r\nhis having gone to the license application department in Dallas, was\r\nanything said about his actually having filled out a driver's license\r\nor a learner's permit application?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; nothing.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. Could we have the date of this document?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. If it is dated. My recollection is it is not.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. His birthday is on it only. Picked up at his room on the\r\ndate of the assassination. I guess it was picked up, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Could I review this with you a little bit? Did Lee Harvey\r\nOswald on this occasion tell you in the course of what limited\r\ntelephone conversation you had with him, that he had gone to the\r\ndriver's license application bureau?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. No; he told Marina.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And did--he told Marina and then Marina in turn told you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How near the time of the telephone conversation?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. She told me immediately.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did Marina tell you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. She just turned from the phone and told you at once?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This was spontaneous?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Yes. It may have been while she was still on the phone, I\r\ndon't recall, but it certainly was immediate.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Dulles, to answer your question the document is not\r\ndated.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. I was just noticing in the upper right-hand corner\r\non the one side he lists his occupation as photographer.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes; this is so.\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. This is what he wanted to do, not what he was doing.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you please relate to the Commission what your\r\nimpression of what his occupation was or occupation had been during the\r\nperiod of time that you had known him?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. When I first met him he was working at\r\nJaggars-Chiles-Stovall. And had expressed himself as liking his work.\r\nI gathered that it was a kind of copying or making up of advertising\r\nlayout, develop a photographic process.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at New Orleans he pointed to a building where he was\r\nworking. I saw no writing on the outside of the building. He said--no,\r\nfirst on the phone when he first called to say he had a job, he said he\r\nwas doing work similar to what he had been doing, photographic type of\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nRepresentative FORD. Work in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. He called to us in Dallas from New Orleans to say he was\r\ndoing such work.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In New Orleans?\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. Subsequently, I have heard it is not so, but this is what\r\nhe told Marina and she told me over the phone. He said, and she told me\r\nimmediately over the phone, that he was getting $1.50 an hour instead\r\nof $1.25 he had been getting, and then in New Orleans he pointed to\r\na building where he was working, somewhere along the river, near the\r\nFrench Quarter, but a big large brick building with no particular\r\ndesignation on it. I don't know what sort of building it was, but he\r\nsaid it was the photo outfit where he was working then.\r\n\r\nWhen he was looking for a job he said, now, in October, early October,\r\nhe came back to the Dallas area and he was looking for a job, he said\r\nhe was hopeful of getting similar work again, photographic layout,\r\nwhatever it was. But that he was pleased to get any job that would\r\nproduce an income.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. For the Commission's information, Mr. Jenner, is this not,\r\nthat is Exhibit No. 426, a form which Lee Oswald apparently took home,\r\nor filled out somewhere, either his home or at the office, but it was\r\nnever sworn to and is not signed.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. DULLES. It is not a completed document. It has no date on it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is my information and there will be testimony and that\r\nis why I didn't go into the document, that it was found in his, among\r\nhis effects in his room on Beckley Street. With permission, I might\r\ndescribe the document possibly a little more in detail in view of the\r\ninterest and the question. At the top of the document under name there\r\nis hand printing on this form, first the form is entitled \"Application\r\nfor Texas Driver's License.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. PAINE. May I interrupt?\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 12:45 o'clock the President's Commission recessed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\n\r\nPunctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant\r\npreference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.\r\n\r\nMisspellings in quoted evidence not changed; misspellings that could be\r\ndue to mispronunciations were not changed.\r\n\r\nSome simple typographical errors were corrected.\r\n\r\nInconsistent hyphenation of compound words retained.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous end-of-line hyphens retained.\r\n\r\nOccasional uses of \"Mr.\" for \"Mrs.\" and of \"Mrs.\" for \"Mr.\" corrected.\r\n\r\nDubious repeated words, (e.g., \"What took place by way of of\r\nconversation?\") retained.\r\n\r\nSeveral unbalanced quotation marks not remedied.\r\n\r\nOccasional periods that should be question marks not changed.\r\n\r\nOccasional periods that should be commas, and commas that should be\r\nperiods, were changed only when they clearly had been misprinted (at\r\nthe end of a paragraph or following a speaker's name in small-caps at\r\nthe beginning of a line). Some commas and semi-colons were printed so\r\nfaintly that they appear to be periods or colons: some were found and\r\ncorrected, but some almost certainly remain.\r\n\r\nThe Index and illustrated Exhibits volumes of this series may not be\r\navailable at Project Gutenberg.\r\n\r\nPage 2: Missing opening quotation mark: the fund for the Russian-born\r\nwidow had reached $76,000.\"\r\n\r\nPage 3: \"No, I have no recollection of anything that she said?\" likely\r\nshould end with a period. Punctuation errors like this occur elsewhere\r\nand have not been changed.\r\n\r\nPage 152: \"RYW\" may be a misprint for \"RWY\".\r\n\r\nPage 224: \"Mr. Ball. It is west of of your house?\" repeats \"of\".\r\n\r\nPage 229: 'Mr. Ball. That is about where you were, a \"Z\" when he\r\nentered the door' should be 'at \"Z\"'.\r\n\r\nPage 262: \"The Chairman. Mr. Whaley, will you wait outside....\"\r\nwas printed as \"Mr. Chairman....\" and has been changed here for\r\nconsistency, to make searches more reliable.\r\n\r\nPage 286: Added missing period between \"m\" and \"?\": and that is p.m.?\r\n\r\nPage 320: \"you have to go the meetings\" may be missing \"to\" after \"go\".\r\n\r\nPage 320: \"She said the thought\" probably should be \"She said they\r\nthought\".\r\n\r\nPage 341: \"in the early party of September\" probably should be \"part\".\r\n\r\nPage 363: \"a bruise or contusion or ecchymosis\" was misprinted as\r\n\"eccmymosis\"; spelled correctly earlier on the same page.\r\n\r\nPage 364 and elsewhere: \"Mr. Specter\" misprinted five times as \"Mr.\r\nSpector\"; corrected here.\r\n\r\nPage 375: \"its jacket appears to me to be intact\" misprinted as \"in\r\ntact\"; corrected here.\r\n\r\nPage 383: \"exit would labeled B, Exhibit 388\" probably should be \"exit\r\nwound\".\r\n\r\nPage 388: \"Mr. Paine. That was in Dallas?\" should end with a period,\r\nnot with a question mark.\r\n\r\nPage 481: \"Does your interpretation\" misprinted as \"Does you\r\ninterpretation\"; corrected here.",
