Adam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Thomas Hart Benton,\r\n  \"On the Expunging Resolution.\"\r\n  U.S. Senate,\r\n  January 12, 1837\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. President:\r\n\r\nIt is now three years since the resolve was adopted by the Senate,\r\nwhich it is my present motion to expunge from the journal.  At the\r\nmoment that this resolve was adopted, I gave notice of my intention to\r\nmove to expunge it; and then expressed my confident belief that the\r\nmotion would eventually prevail.  That expression of confidence was not\r\nan ebullition of vanity, or a presumptuous calculation, intended to\r\naccelerate the event it affected to foretell.  It was not a vain boast,\r\nor an idle assumption, but was the result of a deep conviction of the\r\ninjustice done President Jackson, and a thorough reliance upon the\r\njustice of the American people.  I felt that the President had been\r\nwronged; and my heart told me that this wrong would be redressed!  The\r\nevent proves that I was not mistaken.  The question of expunging this\r\nresolution has been carried to the people, and their decision has been\r\nhad upon it.  They decide in favor of the expurgation; and their\r\ndecision has been both made and manifested, and communicated to us in a\r\ngreat variety of ways.  A great number of States have expressly\r\ninstructed their Senators to vote for this expurgation.  A very great\r\nmajority of the States have elected Senators and Representatives to\r\nCongress, upon the express ground of favoring this expurgation.  The\r\nBank of the United States, which took the initiative in the accusation\r\nagainst the President, and furnished the material, and worked the\r\nmachinery which was used against him, and which was then so powerful on\r\nthis floor, has become more and more odious to the public mind, and\r\nmusters now but a slender phalanx of friends in the two Houses of\r\nCongress.  The late Presidential election furnishes additional evidence\r\nof public sentiment.  The candidate who was the friend of President\r\nJackson, the supporter of his administration, and the avowed advocate\r\nfor the expurgation, has received a large majority of the suffrages of\r\nthe whole Union, and that after an express declaration of his\r\nsentiments on this precise point.  The evidence of the public will,\r\nexhibited in all these forms, is too manifest to be mistaken, too\r\nexplicit to require illustration, and too imperative to be disregarded.\r\nOmitting details and specific enumeration of proofs, I refer to our own\r\nfiles for the instructions to expunge--to the complexion of the two\r\nHouses for the temper of the people--to the denationalized condition of\r\nthe Bank of the United States for the fate of the imperious\r\naccuser--and to the issue of the Presidential election for the answer\r\nof the Union.\r\n\r\nAll these are pregnant proofs of the public will, and the last\r\npre-eminently so: because, both the question of the expurgation, and\r\nthe form of the process, were directly put in issue upon it....\r\n\r\nAssuming, then, that we have ascertained the will of the people on this\r\ngreat question, the inquiry presents itself, how far the expression of\r\nthat will ought to be conclusive of our action here.  I hold that it\r\nought to be binding and obligatory upon us; and that, not only upon the\r\nprinciples of representative government, which require obedience to the\r\nknown will of the people, but also in conformity to the principles upon\r\nwhich the proceeding against President Jackson was conducted when the\r\nsentence against him was adopted.  Then everything was done with\r\nespecial reference to the will of the people.  Their impulsion was\r\nassumed to be the sole motive to action; and to them the ultimate\r\nverdict was expressly referred.  The whole machinery of alarm and\r\npressure--every engine of political and moneyed power--was put in\r\nmotion, and worked for many months, to excite the people against the\r\nPresident; and to stir up meetings, memorials, petitions, travelling\r\ncommittees, and distress deputations against him; and each symptom of\r\npopular discontent was hailed as an evidence of public will, and quoted\r\nhere as proof that the people demanded the condemnation of the\r\nPresident.  Not only legislative assemblies, and memorials from large\r\nassemblies, were then produced here as evidence of public opinion, but\r\nthe petitions of boys under age, the remonstrances of a few signers,\r\nand the results of the most inconsiderable elections were\r\nostentatiously paraded and magnified, as the evidence of the sovereign\r\nwill of our constituents.  Thus, sir, the public voice was everything,\r\nwhile that voice, partially obtained through political and pecuniary\r\nmachinations, was adverse to the President.  Then the popular will was\r\nthe shrine at which all worshipped.  Now, when that will is regularly,\r\nsoberly, repeatedly, and almost universally expressed through the\r\nballot-boxes, at the various elections, and turns out to be in favor of\r\nthe President, certainly no one can disregard it, nor otherwise look at\r\nit than as the solemn verdict of the competent and ultimate tribunal\r\nupon an issue fairly made up, fully argued, and duly submitted for\r\ndecision.  As such verdict, I receive it.  As the deliberate verdict of\r\nthe sovereign people, I bow to it.  I am content.  I do not mean to\r\nreopen the case nor to recommence the argument.  I leave that work to\r\nothers, if any others choose to perform it.  For myself, I am content;\r\nand, dispensing with further argument, I shall call for judgment, and\r\nask to have execution done, upon that unhappy journal, which the\r\nverdict of millions of freemen finds guilty of bearing on its face an\r\nuntrue, illegal, and unconstitutional sentence of condemnation against\r\nthe approved President of the Republic.\r\n\r\nBut, while declining to reopen the argument of this question, and\r\nrefusing to tread over again the ground already traversed, there is\r\nanother and a different task to perform; one which the approaching\r\ntermination of President Jackson's administration makes peculiarly\r\nproper at this time, and which it is my privilege, and perhaps my duty,\r\nto execute, as being the suitable conclusion to the arduous contest in\r\nwhich we have been so long engaged.  I allude to the general tenor of\r\nhis administration, and to its effect, for good or for evil, upon the\r\ncondition of his country.  This is the proper time for such a view to\r\nbe taken.  The political existence of this great man now draws to a\r\nclose.  In little more than forty days he ceases to be an object of\r\npolitical hope to any, and should cease to be an object of political\r\nhate, or envy, to all.  Whatever of motive the servile and time-serving\r\nmight have found in his exalted station for raising the altar of\r\nadulation, and burning the incense of praise before him, that motive\r\ncan no longer exist.  The dispenser of the patronage of an empire, the\r\nchief of this great confederacy of States, is soon to be a private\r\nindividual, stripped of all power to reward, or to punish. His own\r\nthoughts, as he has shown us in the concluding paragraph of that\r\nmessage which is to be the last of its kind that we shall ever receive\r\nfrom him, are directed to that beloved retirement from which he was\r\ndrawn by the voice of millions of freemen, and to which he now looks\r\nfor that interval of repose which age and infirmities require.  Under\r\nthese circumstances, he ceases to be a subject for the ebullition of\r\nthe passions, and passes into a character for the contemplation of\r\nhistory.  Historically, then, shall I view him; and limiting this view\r\nto his civil administration, I demand, where is there a Chief\r\nMagistrate of whom so much evil has been predicted, and from whom so\r\nmuch good has come?  Never has any man entered upon the Chief\r\nMagistracy of a country under such appalling predictions of ruin and\r\nwoe! never has any one been so pursued with direful prognostications!\r\nnever has any one been so beset and impeded by a powerful combination\r\nof political and moneyed confederates! never has any one in any country\r\nwhere the administration of justice has risen above the knife or the\r\nbowstring, been so lawlessly and shamelessly tried and condemned by\r\nrivals and enemies, without hearing, without defence, without the forms\r\nof law and justice!  History has been ransacked to find examples of\r\ntyrants sufficiently odious to illustrate him by comparison.  Language\r\nhas been tortured to find epithets sufficiently strong to paint him in\r\ndescription.  Imagination has been exhausted in her efforts to deck him\r\nwith revolting and inhuman attributes.  Tyrant, despot, usurper;\r\ndestroyer of the liberties of his country; rash, ignorant, imbecile;\r\nendangering the public peace with all foreign nations; destroying\r\ndomestic prosperity at home; ruining all industry, all commerce, all\r\nmanufactures; annihilating confidence between man and man; delivering\r\nup the streets of populous cities to grass and weeds, and the wharves\r\nof commercial towns to the encumbrance of decaying vessels; depriving\r\nlabor of all reward; depriving industry of all employment; destroying\r\nthe currency; plunging an innocent and happy people from the summit of\r\nfelicity to the depths of misery, want, and despair.  Such is the faint\r\noutline, followed up by actual condemnation, of the appalling\r\ndenunciations daily uttered against this one MAN, from the moment he\r\nbecame an object of political competition, down to the concluding\r\nmoment of his political existence.\r\n\r\nThe sacred voice of inspiration has told us that there is a time for\r\nall things.  There certainly has been a time for every evil that human\r\nnature admits of to be vaticinated of President Jackson's\r\nadministration; equally certain the time has now come for all rational\r\nand well-disposed people to compare the predictions with the facts, and\r\nto ask themselves if these calamitous prognostications have been\r\nverified by events?  Have we peace, or war, with foreign nations?\r\nCertainly, we have peace with all the world! peace with all its benign,\r\nand felicitous, and beneficent influences!  Are we respected, or\r\ndespised abroad?  Certainly the American name never was more honored\r\nthroughout the four quarters of the globe than in this very moment.  Do\r\nwe hear of indignity or outrage in any quarter?  of merchants robbed in\r\nforeign ports? of vessels searched on the high seas? of American\r\ncitizens impressed into foreign service? of the national flag insulted\r\nanywhere?  On the contrary, we see former wrongs repaired; no new ones\r\ninflicted.  France pays twenty-five millions of francs for spoliations\r\ncommitted thirty years ago; Naples pays two millions one hundred\r\nthousand ducats for wrongs of the same date; Denmark pays six hundred\r\nand fifty thousand rix-dollars for wrongs done a quarter of a century\r\nago; Spain engages to pay twelve millions of reals vellon for injuries\r\nof fifteen years' date; and Portugal, the last in the list of former\r\naggressors, admits her liability and only waits the adjustment of\r\ndetails to close her account by adequate indemnity.  So far from war,\r\ninsult, contempt, and spoliation from abroad, this denounced\r\nadministration has been the season of peace and goodwill and the\r\nauspicious era of universal reparation.  So far from suffering injury\r\nat the hands of foreign powers, our merchants have received indemnities\r\nfor all former injuries.  It has been the day of accounting, of\r\nsettlement, and of retribution.  The total list of arrearages,\r\nextending through four successive previous administrations, has been\r\nclosed and settled up.  The wrongs done to commerce for thirty years\r\nback, and under so many different Presidents, and indemnities withheld\r\nfrom all, have been repaired and paid over under the beneficent and\r\nglorious administration of President Jackson.  But one single instance\r\nof outrage has occurred, and that at the extremities of the world, and\r\nby a piratical horde, amenable to no law but the law of force.  The\r\nMalays of Sumatra committed a robbery and massacre upon an American\r\nvessel.  Wretches! they did not then know that JACKSON was President of\r\nthe United States! and that no distance, no time, no idle ceremonial of\r\ntreating with robbers and assassins, was to hold back the arm of\r\njustice.  Commodore Downes went out.  His cannon and his bayonets\r\nstruck the outlaws in their den.  They paid in terror and blood for the\r\noutrage which was committed; and the great lesson was taught to these\r\ndistant pirates--to our antipodes themselves--that not even the entire\r\ndiameter of this globe could protect them, and that the name of\r\nAmerican citizen, like that of Roman citizen in the great days of the\r\nRepublic and of the empire, was to be the inviolable passport of all\r\nthat wore it throughout the whole extent of the habitable world....\r\n\r\nFrom President Jackson, the country has first learned the true theory\r\nand practical intent of the Constitution, in giving to the Executive a\r\nqualified negative on the legislative power of Congress.  Far from\r\nbeing an odious, dangerous, or kingly prerogative, this power, as\r\nvested in the President, is nothing but a qualified copy of the famous\r\nveto power vested in the tribunes of the people among the Romans, and\r\nintended to suspend the passage of a law until the people themselves\r\nshould have time to consider it.  The qualified veto of the President\r\ndestroys nothing; it only delays the passage of a law, and refers it to\r\nthe people for their consideration and decision.  It is the reference\r\nof a law, not to a committee of the House, or of the whole House, but\r\nto the committee of the whole Union.  It is a recommitment of the bill\r\nto the people, for them to examine and consider; and if, upon this\r\nexamination, they are content to pass it, it will pass at the next\r\nsession.  The delay of a few months is the only effect of a veto, in a\r\ncase where the people shall ultimately approve a law; where they do not\r\napprove it, the interposition of the veto is the barrier which saves\r\nthem the adoption of a law, the repeal of which might afterward be\r\nalmost impossible.  The qualified negative is, therefore, a beneficent\r\npower, intended as General Hamilton expressly declares in the\r\n\"Federalist,\" to protect, first, the executive department from the\r\nencroachments of the legislative department; and, secondly, to preserve\r\nthe people from hasty, dangerous or criminal legislation on the part of\r\ntheir representatives.  This is the design and intention of the veto\r\npower; and the fear expressed by General Hamilton was, that Presidents,\r\nso far from exercising it too often, would not exercise it as often as\r\nthe safety of the people required; that they might lack the moral\r\ncourage to stake themselves in opposition to a favorite measure of the\r\nmajority of the two Houses of Congress; and thus deprive the people, in\r\nmany instances, of their right to pass upon a bill before it becomes a\r\nfinal law.  The cases in which President Jackson has exercised the veto\r\npower have shown the soundness of these observations.  No ordinary\r\nPresident would have staked himself against the Bank of the United\r\nStates and the two Houses of Congress in 1832.  It required President\r\nJackson to confront that power--to stem that torrent--to stay the\r\nprogress of that charter, and to refer it to the people for their\r\ndecision.  His moral courage was equal to the crisis.  He arrested the\r\ncharter until it could be got to the people, and they have arrested it\r\nforever.  Had he not done so, the charter would have become law, and\r\nits repeal almost impossible.  The people of the whole Union would now\r\nhave been in the condition of the people of Pennsylvania, bestrode by\r\nthe monster, in daily conflict with him, and maintaining a doubtful\r\ncontest for supremacy between the government of a State and the\r\ndirectory of a moneyed corporation....\r\n\r\nSir, I think it right, in approaching the termination of this great\r\nquestion, to present this faint and rapid sketch of the brilliant,\r\nbeneficent, and glorious administration of President Jackson.  It is\r\nnot for me to attempt to do it justice; it is not for ordinary men to\r\nattempt its history.  His military life, resplendent with dazzling\r\nevents, will demand the pen of a nervous writer; his civil\r\nadministration, replete with scenes which have called into action so\r\nmany and such various passions of the human heart, and which has given\r\nto native sagacity so many victories over practiced politicians, will\r\nrequire the profound, luminous, and philosophical conceptions of a\r\nLivy, a Plutarch, or a Sallust.  This history is not to be written in\r\nour day.  The contemporaries of such events are not the hands to\r\ndescribe them.  Time must first do its office--must silence the\r\npassions, remove the actors, develop consequences, and canonize all\r\nthat is sacred to honor, patriotism, and glory.  In after ages the\r\nhistoric genius of our America shall produce the writers which the\r\nsubject demands--men far removed from the contests of this day, who\r\nwill know how to estimate this great epoch, and how to acquire an\r\nimmortality for their own names by painting, with a master's hand, the\r\nimmortal events of the patriot President's life.\r\n\r\nAnd now, sir, I finish the task which, three years ago, I imposed on\r\nmyself.  Solitary and alone, and amid the jeers and taunts of my\r\nopponents, I put this ball in motion.  The people have taken it up, and\r\nrolled it forward, and I am no longer anything but a unit in the vast\r\nmass which now propels it.  In the name of that mass I speak.  I demand\r\nthe execution of the edict of the people; I demand the expurgation of\r\nthat sentence which the voice of a few Senators, and the power of their\r\nconfederate, the Bank of the United States, has caused to be placed on\r\nthe journal of the Senate; and which the voice of millions of freemen\r\nhas ordered to be expunged from it.",
