For example one hundred pounds is shown as 100_l._,\r\n  instead of 100l.\r\n\r\n  A superscript is denoted by ^{}, for example 1./5.^{th.}.\r\n\r\n  All changes listed in the Errata at the back of the book have been\r\n  applied to the etext.\r\n\r\n  Some other minor changes to the text are noted at the end of the\r\n  book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n  TREATISE\r\n  OF\r\n  Taxes & Contributions.\r\n\r\n  Shewing the Nature and Measures of\r\n\r\n  { Crown-Lands.      }\r\n  { Assessements.     }\r\n  { Customs.          }\r\n  { Poll-Moneys.      }\r\n  { Lotteries.        }\r\n  { Benevolence.      }\r\n  { Penalties.        }\r\n  { Monopolies.       }\r\n  { Offices.          }\r\n  { Tythes.           }\r\n  { Raising of Coins. }\r\n  { Harth-Money.      }\r\n  { Excize, &c.       }\r\n\r\n  With several intersperst Discourses and Digressions concerning\r\n\r\n  { Warres.                     }\r\n  { The Church.                 }\r\n  { Universities.               }\r\n  { Rents & Purchases.          }\r\n  { Usury & Exchange.           }\r\n  { Banks & Lombards.           }\r\n  { Registries for Conveyances. }\r\n  { Beggars.                    }\r\n  { Ensurance.                  }\r\n  { Exportation of { Money.     }\r\n  {                { Wool.      }\r\n  { Free-Ports.                 }\r\n  { Coins.                      }\r\n  { Housing.                    }\r\n  { Liberty of Conscience, &c.  }\r\n\r\n  _The same being frequently applied to the present\r\n  State and Affairs of_\r\n  IRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _London_, Printed for _N. Brooke_, at the Angel in _Cornhill_. 1662.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (decorative header)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Preface._\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung and vain persons, though perhaps they marry not primarily\r\nand onely on purpose to get Children, much less to get such as may\r\nbe fit for some one particular vocation; yet having Children, they\r\ndispose of them as well as they can according to their respective\r\ninclinations: Even so, although I wrote these sheets but to rid my\r\nhead of so many troublesome conceits, and not to apply them to the\r\nuse of any one particular People or Concernment; yet now they are\r\nborn, and that their Birth happened to be about the time of the\r\n_Duke of Ormond’s_ going Lord Lieutenant into _Ireland_, I thought\r\nthey might be as proper for the consideration of that place, as of\r\nany other, though perhaps of effect little enough in any.\r\n\r\n_Ireland_ is a place which must have so great an Army kept up in\r\nit, as may make the Irish desist from doing themselves or the\r\nEnglish harm by their future Rebellions. And this great Army\r\nmust occasion great and heavy Leavies upon a poor people and\r\nwasted Countrey; it is therefore not amiss that _Ireland_ should\r\nunderstand the nature and measure of Taxes and Contributions.\r\n\r\n2. The Parishes of _Ireland_ do much want Regulation, by uniting\r\nand dividing them; so as to make them fit Enclosures wherein to\r\nplant the Gospel: wherefore what I have said as to the danger of\r\nsupernumerary Ministers, may also be seasonable there, when the new\r\nGeograpy we expect of that Island shall have afforded means for the\r\nRegulation abovementioned.\r\n\r\n3. The great plenty of _Ireland_ will but undo it, unless a way be\r\nfound for advantageous Exportations, the which will depend upon the\r\ndue measure of Custom and Excize here treated on.\r\n\r\n4. Since _Ireland_ is under-peopled in the whole, and since the\r\nGovernment there can never be safe without chargeable Armies, until\r\nthe major part of the Inhabitants be English, whether by carrying\r\nover these, or withdrawing the other; I think there can be no\r\nbetter encouragement to draw English thither, then to let them\r\nknow, that the Kings Revenue being above 1./10. part of the whole\r\nWealth, Rent, and Proceed of the Nation; that the Publick Charge\r\nin the next Age will be no more felt there then that of Tythes is\r\nhere; and that as the Kings Revenue encreases, so the causes of his\r\nExpence will decrease proportionably, which is a double advantage.\r\n\r\n6. The employing the Beggars in _England_ about mending the\r\nHigh-wayes, and making Rivers Navigable will make the Wool and\r\nCattle of _Ireland_ vend the better.\r\n\r\n7. The full understanding of the nature of Money, the effects of\r\nthe various _species_ of Coins, and of their uncertain values, as\r\nalso of raising or embasing them, is a learning most proper for\r\n_Ireland_, which hath been lately much and often abused for the\r\nwant of it.\r\n\r\n8. Since Lands are worth but six or seven years purchase, and yet\r\ntwenty years just cross the Channel, ’twere good the people of\r\n_Ireland_ knew the reasons of it at a time when there is means of\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nLastly, if any man hath any Notions which probably may be good\r\nfor _Ireland_, he may with most advantage expose them to publick\r\nexamination now, when the Duke of _Ormond_ is Chief Governour: for,\r\n\r\n1. His Grace knows that Countrey perfectly well, as well in times\r\nand matters of Peace as War, and understands the Interests as well\r\nof particular persons, as of all and every factions and parties\r\nstruggling with each other in that Kingdom; understanding withall\r\nthe state of _England_, and also of several Forreign Nations, with\r\nreference to _Ireland_.\r\n\r\n2. His Grace hath given fresh demonstration of his care of an\r\nEnglish Interest in _Ireland_, and of his wisdom in reconciling the\r\nseveral cross concernments there so far as the same is possible.\r\n\r\n3. His Graces Estate in Lands there is the greatest that ever was\r\nin _Ireland_, and consequently he is out of the danger incident\r\nto those _Proreges_, against whom _Cambden_ sayes, _Hibernia est\r\nsemper querula_; there being no reason for ones getting more Land,\r\nwho hath already the most of any.\r\n\r\n4. Whereas some chief Governours who have gone into _Ireland_,\r\nchiefly to repair or raise fortunes, have withdrawn themselves\r\nagain when their work hath been done, not abiding the clamors and\r\ncomplaints of the people afterwards: But his Grace hath given\r\nHostages to that Nation for his good Government, and yet hath taken\r\naway aforehand all fears of the contrary.\r\n\r\n5. His Grace dares do whatever he understands to be fitting, even\r\nto the doing of a single Subject Justice against a Confederate\r\nmultitude; being above the sinister interpretations of the jealous\r\nand querulous; for his known Liberality and Magnificence shall ever\r\nkeep him free from the clamor of the people, and his through-tried\r\nfidelity shall frustrate the force of any subdolous whisperings in\r\nthe Ears of His Majesty.\r\n\r\n6. His good acceptance of all ingenious endeavours, shall make\r\nthe wise men of this Eastern _England_ be led by his Star into\r\n_Ireland_, and there present him with their choicest advices, who\r\ncan most judiciously select and apply them.\r\n\r\nLastly, this great Person takes the great Settlement in hand, when\r\n_Ireland_ is as a white paper, when there sits a Parliament most\r\naffectionate to his Person, and capable of his Counsel, under a\r\nKing curious as well as careful of Reformation; and when there is\r\nopportunity, to pass into Positive Laws whatsoever is right reason\r\nand the Law of Nature.\r\n\r\nWherefore by applying those Notions unto _Ireland_, I think I have\r\nharped upon the right string, and have struck whilest the Iron is\r\nhot; by publishing them now, when, if ever at all, they be useful.\r\nI would now advertise the world, that I do not think I can mend\r\nit, and that I hold it best for every mans particular quiet, to\r\nlet it _vadere sicut vult_; I know well, that _res nolunt male\r\nadministrari_, and that (say I what I will or can) things will\r\nhave their course, nor will nature be couzened: Wherefore what I\r\nhave written (as I said before) was done but to ease and deliver\r\nmy self, my head having been impregnated with these things by the\r\ndaily talk I hear about advancing and regulating Trade, and by the\r\nmurmurs about Taxes, &c.

I.\r\n\r\n_Of the several sorts of Publick Charges._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Publick Charges of a State, are, _That of its Defence_ by Land\r\nand Sea, of its Peace at home and abroad, as also of its honourable\r\nvindication from the injuries of other States; all which we may\r\ncall the Charge of the Militia, which commonly is in ordinary as\r\ngreat as any other Branch of the whole; but extraordinary, (that\r\nis, in time of War, or fear of War) is much the greatest.\r\n\r\n2. Another branch of the Publick Charge is, the Maintenance of\r\nthe Governours, Chief and Subordinate; I mean, such not onely\r\nas spend their whole time in the Execution of their respective\r\nOffices, but also who have spent much in fitting themselves as well\r\nwith abilities to that end, as in begetting an opinion in their\r\nSuperiours of such their ability and trustworthiness.\r\n\r\n3. Which Maintenance of the Governours is to be in such a degree\r\nof plenty and splendour, as private Endeavours and Callings seldom\r\nreach unto: To the end, that such Governours may have the natural\r\nas well as the artificial Causes of Power to act with.\r\n\r\n4. For if a great multitude of men should call one of their number\r\nKing, unless this instituted Prince, appear in greater visible\r\nsplendour then others, can reward those that obey and please\r\nhim, and do the contrary to others; his Institution signifies\r\nlittle, even although he chance to have greater corporal or mental\r\nfaculties, then any other of the number.\r\n\r\n5. There be Offices which are but πἀρεργα, as Sheriffs, Justices\r\nof the Peace, Constables, Churchwardens, &c. which men may attend\r\nwithout much prejudice to their ordinary wayes of livelihood, and\r\nfor which the honour of being trusted, and the pleasure of being\r\nfeared, hath been thought a competent Reward.\r\n\r\n6. Unto this head, the Charge of the administring Justice may\r\nbe referred, as well between man and man, as between the whole\r\nState or Commonalty and particular members of it; as well that of\r\nrighting and punishing past injuries and crimes, as of preventing\r\nthe same in time to come.\r\n\r\n7. A third branch of the Publick Charge is, that of the _Pastorage\r\nof mens Souls_, and the guidance of their Consciences; which,\r\none would think (because it respects another world, and but the\r\nparticular interest of each man there) should not be a publick\r\nCharge in this: Nevertheless if we consider how easie it is to\r\nelude the Laws of man, to commit unprovable crimes, to corrupt and\r\ndivert Testimonies, to wrest the sense and meaning of the Laws,\r\n&c. there follows a necessity of contributing towards a publick\r\nCharge, wherewith to have men instructed in the Laws of God, that\r\ntake notice of evil thoughts and designs, and much more of secret\r\ndeeds, and that punisheth eternally in another world, what man can\r\nbut slightly chastise in this.\r\n\r\n8. Now those who labour in this publick Service, must also be\r\nmaintained in a proportionable splendour; and must withall have the\r\nmeans to allure men with some kinde of reward, even in this life;\r\nforasmuch, as many heretofore followed even Christ himself but for\r\nthe Loaves he gave them.\r\n\r\n9. Another Branch is, the Charge of Schools and Universities,\r\nespecially for so much as they teach above _Reading, Writing,\r\nand Arithmetick_; these being of particular use to every man, as\r\nbeing helps and substitutes of Memory and Reason, Reckoning being\r\nof the latter, as Writing and Reading are of the former, for\r\nwhether Divinity, &c. ought to be made a private Trade, is to me\r\na question.\r\n\r\n10. ’Tis true, that Schools and Colledges are now for the most part\r\nbut the Donations of particular men, or places where particular\r\nmen spend their money and time upon their own private accounts;\r\nbut no doubt it were not amiss, if the end of them were to furnish\r\nall imaginable helps unto the highest and fined Natural Wits,\r\ntowards the discovery of Nature in all its operations; in which\r\nsense they ought to be a publick Charge: The which Wits should not\r\nbe selected for that work, according to the fond conceits of their\r\nown Parents and Friends, (Crows that think their own Birds ever\r\nfairest) but rather by the approbation of others more impartial;\r\nsuch as they are, who pick from out of the Christians Children the\r\nablest Instruments and Support of the Turkish Government. Of which\r\nSelections more hereafter.\r\n\r\n11. Another Branch is, that of the _Maintenance of Orphans, found\r\nand exposed Children_, which also are Orphans; as also of Impotents\r\nof all sorts, and moreover such as want employment.\r\n\r\n12. For the permitting of any to beg is a more chargeable way of\r\nmaintaining them whom the law of Nature will not suffer to starve,\r\nwhere food may possibly be had: Besides, it is unjust to let any\r\nstarve, when we think it just to limit the wages of the poor, so\r\nas they can lay up nothing against the time of their impotency and\r\nwant of work.\r\n\r\n13. A last Branch may be, the Charge of High-wayes, Navigable\r\nRivers, Aquæducts, Bridges, Havens, and other things of universal\r\ngood and concernment.\r\n\r\n14. Other Branches may be thought on, which let other men either\r\nrefer unto these, or adde over and above. For it suffices for my\r\npurpose to have for the present set down these the chief and most\r\nobvious of all the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\n_Of the Causes which encrease and aggravate the several sorts of\r\nPublick Charges._\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken of the several sorts of Publick Charges, we\r\nshall next consider the Causes which encrease them both in general\r\nand in particular.\r\n\r\nAmong the general Causes is, First, the unwillingness of the\r\npeople to pay them; arising from an opinion, that by delay and\r\nreluctancy they may wholly avoid them, with a suspition that what\r\nis imposed is too much, or that what is collected is embezelled or\r\nill expended, or that it is unequally leavied and assessed. All\r\nthese resolving into an unnecessary Charge to collect them, and of\r\nforcing their Prince to hardships towards the people.\r\n\r\n2. Another Cause which aggravates Taxes is, the force of paying\r\nthem in money at a certain time, and not in commodities, at the\r\nmost convenient seasons.\r\n\r\n3. Thirdly, Obscurities and doubts concerning the right of imposing.\r\n\r\n4. Fourthly, Scarcity of Money, and Confusion of Coins.\r\n\r\n5. Fifthly, Fewness of people, especially of Labourers and\r\nArtificers.\r\n\r\n6. Sixthly, Ignorance of the numbers, Wealth and Trade of the\r\npeople, causing a needless repetition of the charge and trouble of\r\nnew additional Levies, in order to amend mistakes.\r\n\r\n7. As to particulars. The Causes of encreasing the Military Charge\r\nare the same with those that encrease Wars, or fear of Wars, which\r\nare Forreign or Civil.\r\n\r\n8. An Offensive Forreign War is caused by many, and those very\r\nvarious, secret, personal distastes coloured----with publick\r\npretences; of which we can say nothing, but that the common\r\nencouragement unto them particularly here in _England_ is a\r\nfalse opinion, that our Countrey is full peopled, or that if we\r\nwanted more Territory, we could take it with less charge from our\r\nneighbours, then purchase it from the _Americans_; and a mistake,\r\nthat the greatness and glory of a Prince lyeth rather in the extent\r\nof his Territory, then in the number, art, and industry of his\r\npeople, well united and governed. And moreover, that it is more\r\nglorious to take from others by fraud or rapine, then to gain ones\r\nself out of the bowels of the Earth and Sea.\r\n\r\n9. Now those States are free from Forreign Offensive Wars (arising\r\nas abovesaid out of Personal and Private Causes) where the chief\r\nGovernours Revenue is but small, and not sufficient to carry on\r\nsuch Wars, the which if they happen to be begun, and so far carryed\r\non, as to want general Contributions, then those who have the\r\npower to impose them, do commonly enquire what private persons and\r\nEnds occasioned the War, and so fall upon the Authors, rather then\r\ncontribute to the Effect; otherwise then to quench it.\r\n\r\n10. Defensive Wars are caused from unpreparedness of the offended\r\nState for War, as when defective Stores are served into the\r\nMagazines by corrupt Officers at the rate of good; when Armies are\r\nfalsely Mustered; when Souldiers are either Tenants or Servants to\r\ntheir Commanders, or else persons, who for their Crimes or Debts,\r\nwant protection from Justice; when the Officers are ignorant of\r\ntheir business, and absent from their Commands; and withal afraid\r\nto punish, because unwilling to pay. Wherefore to be alwayes in a\r\nposture of War at home, is the cheapest way to keep off War from\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\n11. The causes of Civil Wars here in _Europe_ proceed very much\r\nfrom Religion, _viz._ the punishing of Believers heterodox from the\r\nAuthorized way, in publike and open places, before great multitudes\r\nof ignorant people, with loss of life, liberty, and limbs, rather\r\nthen by well proportioned tolerable pecuniary mulcts, such as every\r\nconscientious Non-Conformist would gladly pay, and Hypocrites by\r\nrefusing, discover themselves to be such.\r\n\r\n12. Civil Wars are likewise caused by peoples fansying, that\r\ntheir own uneasie condition may be best remedied by an universal\r\nconfusion; although indeed upon the upshot of such disorders they\r\nshall probably be in a worse, even although they survive and\r\nsucceed, but more probably perish in the contest.\r\n\r\n13. Moreover, the peoples believing that Forms of Government shall\r\nin a few years produce any considerable alteration as to the wealth\r\nof the Subject that the Form which is most ancient and present\r\nis not the best for the place; that any established family or\r\nperson is not better then any new pretender, or even then the best\r\nElection that can be made; that Sovereignty is invisible, and that\r\nit is not certainly annexed unto some certain person or persons.\r\n\r\n14. Causes of Civil War are also, that the Wealth of the Nation\r\nis in too few mens hands, and that no certain means are provided\r\nto keep all men from a necessity either to beg, or steal, or be\r\nSouldiers.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the allowing Luxury in some, whilst others needlesly\r\nstarve.\r\n\r\nThe dispensing of benefits upon casual and uncertain Motives,\r\nthe giving vaste Emoluments to persons and parties of no certain\r\nvisible merit. These are the things which cause animosities among\r\nthe totter-headed multitude, who are the tinder that the sparks of\r\na few Designers may easily inflame.\r\n\r\n15. One Cause of Publick Charge in matters of Religion, is the not\r\nhaving changed the limits of Parishes and Cures with the Change of\r\nReligion from Popery, and with the Changes in Plantation and Trade.\r\nFor now when the Ministers of the Gospel preach unto multitudes\r\nassembled in one place, may not Parishes be bigger? that is, may\r\nnot Flocks be more numerous, then when every particular sheep was,\r\nas heretofore, drest and shorn three or four times _per annum_\r\nby Shrift. If there be in _England_ and _Wales_ but about five\r\nmillions of people, what needs more then 5000. Parishes? that is\r\n1000. Sheep under every Shepheard. Whereas in the middling Parishes\r\nof _London_ there are about 5000. souls in each. Upon which account\r\nthere needs be in _England_ and _Wales_ but a 1000. Parishes,\r\nwhereas there are near 10000.\r\n\r\n16. Now the saving of half the Parishes, would (reckoning the\r\nbenefices one with another, but at 100_l._ _per Annum_ a piece) save\r\n500000_l._ Besides, when the number of Parochial Parsons were halved,\r\nthen there would need but half the present number of Byshops, Deans\r\nand Chapters, Colledges and Cathedralls, which perhaps would amount\r\nto two or three hundred thousand pounds more: And yet the Church\r\nof God would be more regularly served then now, and that without\r\nprejudice to that sacred, ancient Order of Episcopacy, and the way\r\nof their Maintenance by Tythes; and all this in a method of greater\r\nReformation and suitableness thereunto.\r\n\r\n18. But suppose it be said, that in some wild Countreys, a thousand\r\npeople do not live in a less scope of ground then of eight miles\r\nsquare. To which I answer, that there are few or no such places,\r\nthe largest Parishes I know, being not more capacious then of three\r\nor four miles square, in which is no difficulty, for the people to\r\nmeet once a week at some central place within that scope.\r\n\r\n19. Moreover I say, that a Curate of small Learning, if of good\r\nlife, and duly Ordained, may officiate in four Chappels of Ease\r\nevery Sunday; and the Preacher, who indeed should be a person of\r\nLearning and Eloquence, may preach every other Sunday in every\r\nof the said Chappels, by preaching in two of them one day, and\r\nin the other two, the other day: And this with Catechizing, and\r\nExtra-Lectures upon the Week-dayes, would perform as much as now is\r\nperformed, and as much as by the blessing of God is necessary to\r\nsalvation; for the yoak of Christ is easie, and his burthen light.\r\n\r\n20. But to put an end to this doubt; I affirm, that if England and\r\nWales were cut out in parcels of three miles square, there would be\r\nfound few above four thousand such, of which to make Parishes.\r\n\r\n21. Now if it be said, that the Alienation of these Tythes is\r\nSacriledge; I answer, that if the same be employed to defend the\r\nChurch of God against the Turke and Pope, and the Nations who\r\nadhere to them, it is not at all; or less, then to give 3./4. of\r\nthe same to the Wives and Children of the Priests which were not in\r\nbeing when those allowances were set forth?\r\n\r\n21. If I had not an abhorrence from propounding the lessening of\r\nthe Church Means, I could say, that the retrenching part of each\r\nremaining Parsons Tythes and Emoluments, and leaving them for part,\r\nto the free Contributions of their Flocks, were a way to promote\r\nthe Gospel, and to give less offence to such as think that their\r\nwhole maintenance should be made in that manner.\r\n\r\n22. I might also say, that forasmuch as there be more Males then\r\nFemales in _England_, (the said disproportion _pro tanto_ hindering\r\nprocreation) that it were good for the Ministers to return to\r\ntheir Cælibat; or that none should be Ministers, whilst they were\r\nmarried, it being easie among five millions of people to finde out\r\n5000. that could and would live single, that is, one in a thousand:\r\nAnd then our unmarried Parson might live as well with half, as now\r\nwith the whole of his Benefice.\r\n\r\n23. Alwayes provided, that though the number of Parishes, and the\r\nmeasure of Benefices were lessened, yet that the same ought to be\r\ndone without dammage to the present Incumbents.\r\n\r\n24. As for lessening the Charge of Offices relating to the\r\nGovernment and the Law, the same will consist in abolishing the\r\nsuperfluous, supernumerary, and antiquated; and withall, in\r\nretrenching the Fees of others, to what the labour, art, and trust\r\nof their respective employments do require. For there be many\r\nOffices wholly executed by Deputies for small wages, whereas the\r\nMasters of them have ten times as much, although they know nothing\r\neither of what is done, or ought to be done in the business.\r\n\r\n25. Now such Surplusages as these should be either restored unto\r\nthe people who gave them unto the King, at a time when those Fees\r\nmade up but a just reward for the Officer; or else the King keeping\r\nthem still might take them for so much toward the Publick Charge,\r\nbut not give them away to stop the importunate suits of any\r\nparticular person, in whom and in all his dependants, such benefits\r\ndo but cause a laziness as to the true original gain of the Nation,\r\nand themselves in particular, together with a total negligence and\r\nignorance of the publick good.\r\n\r\n26. Many are the particulars that might be instanced of this\r\nkinde; but my aim not being to prejudice any man in particular, I\r\ndescend no lower, wishing onely that there might be an universal\r\nReformation of what length of time hath warped awry, in which case\r\nno particular men are to be troubled; for if all suffer, none\r\nsuffers, and all men would be no poorer then now they are if they\r\nshould lose half their Estates; nor would they be a whit the richer\r\nif the same were doubled, the _Ratio formalis_ of Riches lying\r\nrather in proportion then quantity.\r\n\r\n27. To lessen the charge of Universities, unto which I adde the\r\nInns of Court, which is not much, were to lessen the number of the\r\nStudents in Divinity, Law and Medicine, by lessening the use of\r\nthose Professions.\r\n\r\nNow having spoken already of Divinity, I come next to the Law, and\r\nsay; that if Registers were kept of all mens Estates in Lands, and\r\nof all the Conveyances of, and Engagements upon them; and withal\r\nif publick Loan-Banks, Lombards, or Banks of Credit upon deposited\r\nmoney, Plate, Jewels, Cloth, Wooll, Silke, Leather, Linnen,\r\nMettals, and other durable Commodities, were erected, I cannot\r\napprehend how there could be above one tenth part of the Law-suits\r\nand Writings, as now there are.\r\n\r\n28. And moreover, if by accompt of the people, of their Land and\r\nother wealth, the number of Lawyers and Scriveners were adjusted,\r\nI cannot conceive how their should remain above one hundredth part\r\nof what now are; forasmuch as I have heard some affirm, that there\r\nbe now ten times as many as are even now necessary; and that there\r\nare now ten times as many Law-suits, as upon the abovementioned\r\nReformation, there would be. It follows therefore, that upon the\r\nwhole there would not need one in a hundred of the present number\r\nof Retainers to the Law, and Offices of Justice; the occasions as\r\nwell of crimes as injuries being so much retrenched.\r\n\r\n29. As for Physicians, it is not hard by the help of the\r\nobservations which have been lately made upon the Bills of\r\nMortality, to know how many are sick in _London_ by the number\r\nof them that dye, and by the proportions of the City to finde\r\nout the same of the Countrey; and by both, by the advice of the\r\nlearned Colledge of that Faculty to calculate how many Physicians\r\nwere requisite for the whole Nation, and consequently, how many\r\nStudents in that art to permit and encourage; and lastly, having\r\ncalculated these numbers, to adoptate a proportion of Chyrurgeons,\r\nApothecaries, and Nurses to them, and so by the whole to cut off\r\nand extinguish that infinite swarm of vain pretenders unto, and\r\nabusers of that God-like Faculty, which of all Secular Employments\r\nour Saviour himself after he began to preach engaged himself upon.\r\n\r\n30. Moreover, if it were agreed, what number of Divines,\r\nPhysicians, and Civilians (that is, of men bred in Universities)\r\nwere requisite to the publick service? As suppose 13000. in\r\nthe present way, and perhaps not above 6000. in that way of\r\nRetrenchment which we propound; then supposing that but one in\r\nforty dyes _per annum_, it follows that less then 350. might\r\nsuffice to be sent yearly out of the Universities: Where supposing\r\nthey stay five years one with another, it followeth also that\r\nabout 1800. is the number of Students fit to be allowed in the\r\nUniversities at a time; I mean, of such as intend to make Learning\r\ntheir Trade and way of Livelihood.\r\n\r\n31. I might intimate, that if 1800. Students were enough, and that\r\nif there were 40000. Parish Children and Foundlings in _England_,\r\nit were probable that one in twenty of them might be of excellent\r\nwit and towardness.\r\n\r\nNow since the Publick may dispose of these Children as they please,\r\nand since there is Maintenance in both Universities for above 1800.\r\nwhat if our Professors of Art were in this manner selected and\r\neducated? But of this but _in transitu_.\r\n\r\n32. Hereunto may be added, that by reason of Loan Banks\r\naforementioned, whereby the Credits and Estates of all Dealers may\r\nbe known, and all the mysterious dangers of money prevented, and\r\nthat by good Accompts of our growth, Manufacture, Consumption,\r\nand Importation, it might be known how many Merchants were able\r\nto mannage the Exchange of our superfluous Commodities with the\r\nsame of other Countreys: And also how many Retailers are needful\r\nto make the subdistributions into every Village of this Nation,\r\nand to receive back their superfluities. Upon these grounds I\r\npresume a large proportion of these also might be retrenched, who\r\nproperly and originally earn nothing from the Publick, being onely\r\na kinde of Gamesters, that play with one another for the labours\r\nof the poor; yielding of themselves no fruit at all, otherwise\r\nthen as veins and arteries, to distribute forth and back the blood\r\nand nutritive juyces of the Body Politick, namely the product of\r\nHusbandry and Manufacture.\r\n\r\n33. Now if the numerous Offices and Fees relating to the\r\nGovernment, Law, and Church, and if the number of Divines, Lawyers,\r\nPhysicians, Merchants, and Retailers were also lessened, all which\r\ndo receive great wages for little work done to the Publick, with\r\nhow much greater ease would common expences be defrayed? and with\r\nhow much more equality would the same be assessed?\r\n\r\n34. We enumerated six Branches of the Publick Charge, and have\r\nslightly spoken how four of them might be lessened; we come next\r\nto the other two Branches, whereof we shall rather recommend the\r\naugmentation.\r\n\r\nThe first of these two Branches I call, generally speaking, Care of\r\nthe Poor, consisting of Receptacles for the aged, blinde, lame, &c.\r\nin health; Hospitals for noysome, chronical, curable and uncurable,\r\ninward and outward Diseases. With others for acute and contagious.\r\nOthers for Orphans, sound and exposed Children; of which latter\r\nsort none should be refused, let the number be never so great,\r\nprovided their names, families, and relations were well concealed:\r\nThe choice of which Children being made at their being about eight\r\nor ten years old, might afford the King the fittest Instruments\r\nfor all kinde of his Affairs, and be as firmly obliged to be his\r\nfaithful servants as his own natural Children.\r\n\r\n35. This is no new nor rare thing, onely the neglect of it in\r\nthese Countreys, is rather to be esteemed a rare and new project:\r\nNor is it unknown what excellent fruits there have been of this\r\nInstitution, of which we shall say much more, upon another occasion\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n36. When all helpless and impotent Persons were thus provided for,\r\nand the lazy and thievish restrained and punished by the Minister\r\nof Justice, it follows now, that we finde out certain constant\r\nEmployments for all other indigent people, who labouring according\r\nto the Rules upon them, may require a sufficiency of food and\r\nraiment. Their Children also, (if small and impotent) as aforesaid,\r\nbeing provided for elsewhere.\r\n\r\n37. But what shall these Employments be? I answer, such as were\r\nreckoned as the sixth Branch of the Publick Expence, _viz._ making\r\nall High-wayes so broad, firm, and eaven, as whereby the charge\r\nand tedium of travelling and Carriages may be greatly lessened.\r\nThe cutting and scowring of Rivers into Navigable; the planting of\r\nusefull Trees for timber, delight, and fruit in convenient places.\r\n\r\nThe making of Bridges and Cawseys.\r\n\r\nThe working in Mines, Quarries, and Colleries.\r\n\r\nThe Manufactures of Iron, &c.\r\n\r\n38. I pitch upon all these particulars, first, as works wanting in\r\nthis Nation; secondly, as works of much labour, and little art; and\r\nthirdly, as introductive of new Trades into _England_, to supply\r\nthat of Cloth, which we have almost totally lost.\r\n\r\nIn the next place it will be asked, who shall pay these men? I\r\nanswer, every body; for if there be 1000. men in a Territory, and\r\nif 100. of these can raise necessary food and raiment for the whole\r\n1000. If 200. more, make as much commodities, as other Nations\r\nwill give either their commodities or money for, and if 400. more\r\nbe employed in the ornaments, pleasure, and magnificence of the\r\nwhole; if there be 200. Governours, Divines, Lawyers, Physicians,\r\nMerchants, and Retailers, making in all 900. the question is,\r\nsince there is food enough for this supernumerary 100. also, how\r\nthey should come by it? whether by begging, or by stealing; or\r\nwhether they shall suffer themselves to starve, finding no fruit\r\nof their begging, or being taken in their stealing be put to death\r\nanother way? Or whether they shall be given away to another Nation\r\nthat will take them? I think ’tis plain, they ought neither to\r\nbe starved, nor hanged, nor given away; now if they beg, they\r\nmay pine for hunger to day, and be gorged and glutted to morrow,\r\nwhich will occasion Diseases and evil habits, the same may be said\r\nof stealing; moreover, perhaps they may get either by begging or\r\nstealing more then will suffice them, which will for ever after\r\nindispose them to labour, even upon the greatest occasion which may\r\nsuddenly and unexpectedly happen.\r\n\r\n39. For all these Reasons, it will be certainly the safer way to\r\nafford them the superfluity which would otherwise be lost and\r\nwasted, or wantonly spent: Or in case there be no overplus, then\r\n’tis fit to retrench a little from the delicacy of others feeding\r\nin quantity or quality; few men spending less then double of what\r\nmight suffice them as to the bare necessities of nature.\r\n\r\n40. Now as to the work of these supernumeraries, let it be without\r\nexpence of Foreign Commodities, and then ’tis no matter if it be\r\nemployed to build a useless Pyramid upon _Salisbury Plain_, bring\r\nthe Stones at _Stonehenge_ to _Tower-Hill_, or the like; for at\r\nworst this would keep their mindes to discipline and obedience, and\r\ntheir bodies to a patience of more profitable labours when need\r\nshall require it.\r\n\r\n41. In the next place, as an instance of the usefulness of what\r\nhath been propounded, I ask what benefit will the mending of\r\nHigh-wayes, the building of Bridges and Cawseys, with making of\r\nRivers navigable produce, besides the pleasure and beauty of them?\r\nTo which I also answer, as an instance of the premises, that the\r\nsame, together with the numerous millions of Cattle and Sheep\r\nout of _Ireland_, shall produce a vaste superfluity of English\r\nHorses, the which because they have the many excellent qualities of\r\nbeauty, strength, courage, swiftness, and patience concentrated in\r\nthem, beyond the Horses of other places, would be a very vendible\r\nCommodity all over _Europe_; and such as depending upon the\r\nintrinsick nature of the English Soyle could not be counterfeited,\r\nnor taken away by others. Moreover, an Horse is such a Commodity as\r\nwill carry both himself and his Merchant to the Market, be the same\r\nnever so distant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\n_How the Causes of the unquiet bearing of Taxes may be lessened._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have slightly gone through all the six Branches of the Publick\r\nCharge, and have (though imperfectly and in haste) shewn what would\r\nencrease, and what would abate them.\r\n\r\nWe come next to take away some of the general Causes of the unquiet\r\nbearing of Taxes, and yielding to Contributions, _viz._\r\n\r\n2. 1. That the people think, the Sovereign askes more then he\r\nneeds. To which we answer, 1. That if the Sovereign were sure to\r\nhave what he wanted in due time, it were his own great dammage\r\nto draw away the money out of his Subjects hands, who by trade\r\nincrease it, and to hoard it up in his own Coffers, where ’tis of\r\nno use even to himself, but lyable to be begged or vainly expended.\r\n\r\n3. 2. Let the Tax be never so great, if it be proportionable unto\r\nall, then no man suffers the loss of any Riches by it. For men (as\r\nwe said but now) if the Estates of them all were either halfed or\r\ndoubled, would in both cases remain equally rich. For they would\r\neach man have his former state, dignity, and degree; and moreover,\r\nthe Money leavied not going out of the Nation, the same also would\r\nremain as rich in comparison of any other Nation; onely the Riches\r\nof the Prince and People would differ for a little while, namely,\r\nuntil the money leavied from some, were again refunded upon the\r\nsame, or other persons that paid it: In which case every man also\r\nshould have his chance and opportunity to be made the better or\r\nworse by the new distribution; or if he lost by one, yet to gain by\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n4. 3. Now that which angers men most, is to be taxed above their\r\nNeighbours. To which I answer, that many times these surmizes\r\nare mistakes, many times they are chances, which in the next Tax\r\nmay run more favourable; and if they be by design, yet it cannot\r\nbe imagined, that it was by design of the Sovereign, but of some\r\ntemporary Assessor, whose turn it may be to receive the _Talio_\r\nupon the next occasion from the very man he has wronged.\r\n\r\n5. 4. Men repine much, if they think the money leavyed will be\r\nexpended on Entertainments, magnificent Shews, triumphal Arches,\r\n&c. To which I answer, that the same is a refunding the said moneys\r\nto the Tradesmen who work upon those things; which Trades though\r\nthey seem vain and onely of ornament, yet they refund presently to\r\nthe most useful; namely, to Brewers, Bakers, Taylours, Shoemakers,\r\n&c. Moreover, the Prince hath no more pleasure in these Shews and\r\nEntertainments then 100000. others of his meanest Subjects have,\r\nwhom, for all their grumbling, we see to travel many miles to be\r\nspectators of these mistaken and distasted vanities.\r\n\r\n6. 5. The people often complain, that the King bestows the money\r\nhe raises from the people upon his Favourites: To which we\r\nanswer; that what is given to Favourites, may at the next step or\r\ntransmigration, come into our own hands, or theirs unto whom we\r\nwish well, and think do deserve it.\r\n\r\n7. Secondly, as this man is a Favourite to day, so another, or\r\nour selves, may be hereafter; favour being of a very slippery and\r\nmoveable nature, and not such a thing as we need much to envy; for\r\nthe same way that----leads up an hill, leads also down the same.\r\nBesides, there is nothing in the Lawes or Customes of _England_,\r\nwhich excludes any the meanest mans Childe, from arriving to the\r\nhighest Offices in this Kingdom, much less debars him from the\r\nPersonall kindness of his Prince.\r\n\r\n8. All these imaginations (whereunto the vulgar heads are subject)\r\ndo cause a backwardness to pay, and that necessitates the Prince\r\nto severity. Now this lighting upon some poor, though stubborn,\r\nstiff-necked Refuser, charged with Wife and Children, gives the\r\ncredulous great occasion to complain of Oppression, and breeds ill\r\nblood as to all other matters; feeding the ill humours already in\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\n9. 6. Ignorance of the Number, Trade, and Wealth of the people, is\r\noften the reason why the said people are needlesly troubled, viz.\r\nwith the double charge and vexation of two, or many Levies, when\r\none might have served: Examples whereof have been seen in late\r\nPoll-moneys; in which (by reason of not knowing the state of the\r\npeople, _viz._ how many there were of each Taxable sort, and the\r\nwant of sensible markes whereby to rate men, and the confounding of\r\nEstates with Titles and Offices) great mistakes were committed.\r\n\r\n10. Besides, for not knowing the Wealth of the people, the Prince\r\nknows not what they can bear; and for not knowing the Trade, he\r\ncan make no Judgment of the proper season when to demand his\r\nExhibitions.\r\n\r\n11. 7. Obscurities and doubts, about the right of imposing, hath\r\nbeen the cause of great and ugly Reluctancies in the people, and of\r\nInvoluntary Severities in the Prince; an eminent Example whereof\r\nwas the Ship-money, no small cause of twenty years calamity to the\r\nwhole Kingdom.\r\n\r\n12. 8. Fewness of people, is real poverty; and a Nation wherein are\r\nEight Millions of people, are more then twice as rich as the same\r\nscope of Land wherein are but Four; For the same Governours which\r\nare the great charge, may serve near as well, for the greater, as\r\nthe lesser number.\r\n\r\n13. Secondly, If the people be so few, as that they can live, _Ex\r\nsponte Creatii_, or with little labour, such as is Grazing, &c.,\r\nthey become wholly without Art. No man that will not exercise his\r\nhands, being able to endure the tortures of the mind, which much\r\nthoughtfulness doth occasion.\r\n\r\n14. 9. Scarcity of money, is another cause of the bad payment of\r\nTaxes; for if we consider, that of all the wealth of this Nation,\r\n_viz._ Lands, Housing, Shipping, Commodities, Furniture, Plate, and\r\nMoney, that scarce one part of an hundred is Coin; and that perhaps\r\nthere is scarce six millions of Pounds now in _England_, that is\r\nbut twenty shillings a head for every head in the Nation. We may\r\neasily judge, how difficult it is for men of competent estates, to\r\npay a Summe of money on a sudden; which if they cannot compass,\r\nSeverities, and Charges ensue; and that with reason, though\r\nunluckie enough, it being more tolerable to undoe one particular\r\nMember, then to endanger the whole, notwithstanding indeed it be\r\nmore tolerable for one particular Member to be undone with the\r\nwhole, then alone.\r\n\r\n15. 10. It seems somewhat hard, that all Taxes should be paid in\r\nmoney, viz., (when the King hath occasion to Victual his Ships at\r\n_Portsmouth_) that Fat Oxen, and Corn should not be received in\r\nkind, but that Farmers must first carry their Corn perhaps ten\r\nMiles to sell, and turn into money; which being paid to the King,\r\nis again reconverted into Corn, fetcht many miles further.\r\n\r\n16. Moreover, the Farmer for haste is forced to under-sell his\r\nCorn, and the King for haste likewise, is forced to over-buy his\r\nprovisions. Whereas the paying in kinde, _Pro Hic & Nunc_, would\r\nlessen a considerable grievance to the poor people.\r\n\r\n17. The next confederation shall be of the consequences, and\r\neffects of too great a Tax, not in respect of particular men, of\r\nwhich we have spoken before, but to the whole people in general:\r\nTo which I say, that there is a certain measure, and proportion\r\nof money requisite to drive the trade of a Nation, more or less\r\nthen which would prejudice the same. Just as there is a certain\r\nproportion of Farthings necessary in a small retail Trade, to\r\nchange silver money, and to even such reckonings as cannot be\r\nadjusted with the smallest silver pieces. For money, (made of Gold\r\nand silver) is to the τἁ χρἠϛα (that is to the matter of our Food\r\nand Covering) but as Farthings, and other local extrinsick money,\r\nis to the Gold and Silver species.\r\n\r\n18. Now as the proportion of the number of Farthings requisite in\r\ncomerse is to be taken from the number of people, the frequency of\r\ntheir exchanges; as also, and principally from the value of the\r\nsmallest silver pieces of money; so in like maner, the proportion\r\nof money requisite to our Trade, is to be likewise taken from the\r\nfrequency of commutations, and from the bigness of the payments,\r\nthat are by Law or Custome usually made otherwise. From whence\r\nit follows, that where there are Registers of Lands, whereby the\r\njust value of each mans interest in them, may be well known; and\r\nwhere there are Depositories of the τἁ χρἠϛα, as of Metals, Cloth,\r\nLinnen, Leather, and other Usefuls; and where there are Banks of\r\nmoney also, there less money is necessary to drive the Trade.\r\nFor if all the greatest payments be made in Lands, and the other\r\nperhaps down to ten pound, or twenty pound be made by credit in\r\nLombars or Money-Banks: It follows, that there needs onely money to\r\npay sums less then those aforementioned; just as fewer Farthings\r\nare requisite for change, where there be plenty of silver two\r\nPences, then where the least silver piece is six Pence.\r\n\r\n19. To apply all this, I say, that if there be too much money in a\r\nNation, it were good for the Commonalty, as well as the King, and\r\nno harm even to particular men, if the King had in his Coffers,\r\nall that is superfluous, no more then if men were permitted to pay\r\ntheir Taxes in any thing they could best spare.\r\n\r\n20. On the other side, if the largeness of a publick Exhibition\r\nshould leave less money then is necessary to drive the Nations\r\nTrade, then the mischief thereof would be the doing of less work,\r\nwhich is the same as lessening the people, or their Art and\r\nIndustry; for a hundred pound passing a hundred hands for Wages,\r\ncauses a 10000_l._ worth of Commodities to be produced, which hands\r\nwould have been idle and useless, had there not been this continual\r\nmotive to their employment.\r\n\r\n21. Taxes if they be presently expended upon our own Domestick\r\nCommodities, seem to me, to do little harm to the whole Body of\r\nthe people, onely they work a change in the Riches and Fortunes of\r\nparticular men; and particularly by transferring the same from the\r\nLanded and Lazy, to the Crafty and Industrious. As for example, if\r\na Gentleman have let his Lands to Farm for a hundred pound _per\r\nannum_, for several years or lives, and he be taxed twenty pound\r\n_per annum_, to maintain a Navy; then the effect hereof will be,\r\nthat this Gentleman’s twenty pound _per annum_, will be distributed\r\namongst Seamen, Ship-Carpenters, and other Trades relating to\r\nNaval matters; but if the Gentleman had his Land in his own hands,\r\nthen being taxed a Fifth part, he would raise his Rents near the\r\nsame proportion upon his under Tenants, or would sell his Cattle,\r\nCorn, and Wooll a Fifth part dearer; the like also would all other\r\nsubdependents on him do; and thereby recover in some measure, what\r\nhe paid. Lastly, but if all the money levied were thrown into the\r\nSea, then the ultimate effect would onely be, that every man must\r\nwork a fifth part the harder, or retrench a fifth part of his\r\nconsumptions, _viz._ the former, if forreign Trade be improveable,\r\nand the latter, if it be not.\r\n\r\n22. This, I conceive, were the worst of Taxes in a well policyed\r\nState; but in other States, where is not a certain prevention of\r\nBeggary and Theevery, that is a sure livelihood for men wanting\r\nimployment; there, I confess, an excessive Taxe, causes excessive\r\nand insuperable want, even of natural necessities, and that on a\r\nsudden, so as ignorant particular persons, cannot finde out what\r\nway to subsist by; and this, by the law of Nature, must cause\r\nsudden effects to relieve it self, that is, Rapines, Frauds; and\r\nthis again must bring Death, Mutilations, and Imprisonments,\r\naccording to the present Laws which are Mischiefs, and Punishments,\r\nas well unto the State, as to the particular sufferers of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\n  _Of the several wayes of Taxe, and first, of setting a part,\r\n  a proportion of the whole Territory for Publick uses, in the\r\n  nature of Crown Lands; and secondly, by way of Assessement, or\r\n  Land-taxe._\r\n\r\n\r\nBut supposing, that the several causes of Publick Charge are\r\nlessened as much as may be, and that the people be well satisfied,\r\nand contented to pay their just shares of what is needfull for\r\ntheir Government and Protection, as also for the Honour of their\r\nPrince and Countrey: It follows now to propose the several wayes,\r\nand expedients, how the same may be most easily, speedily, and\r\ninsensibly collected. The which I shall do, by exposing the\r\nconveniencies and inconveniences of some of the principal wayes\r\nof Levyings, used of later years within the several States of\r\n_Europe_: unto which others of smaller and more rare use may be\r\nreferred.\r\n\r\n2. Imagine then, a number of people, planted in a Territory, who\r\nhad upon Computation concluded, that two Millions of pounds _per\r\nannum_, is necessary to the publick charges. Or rather, who going\r\nmore wisely to work, had computed a twenty fifth part of the\r\nproceed of all their Lands and Labours, were to be the _Excisum_,\r\nor the part to be cut out, and laid aside for publick uses. Which\r\nproportions perhaps are fit enough to the affairs of _England_, but\r\nof that hereafter.\r\n\r\n3. Now the question is, how the one or the other shall be raised.\r\nThe first way we propose, is, to Excize the very Land it self in\r\nkinde; that is, to cut out of the whole twenty five Millions, which\r\nare said to be in _England_ and _Wales_, as much Land _in specie_,\r\nas whereof the Rack-rent would be two Millions, _viz._ about four\r\nMillions of Acres, which is about a sixth part of the whole;\r\nmaking the said four Millions to be Crown Lands, and as the four\r\nCounties intended to be reserved in _Ireland_ upon the forfeitures\r\nwere. Or else to excize a sixth part of the rent of the whole,\r\nwhich is about the proportion, that the Adventurers and Souldiers\r\nin _Ireland_ retribute to the King, as Quit Rents. Of which two\r\nwayes, the latter is manifestly the better, the King having more\r\nsecurity, and more obligees, provided the trouble and charge of\r\nthis universal Collection, exceed not that of the other advantage\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\n4. This way in a new State would be good, being agreed upon, as it\r\nwas in _Ireland_, before men had even the possession of any Land\r\nat all; wherefore whosoever buyes Land in _Ireland_ hereafter, is\r\nno more concerned with the Quit Rents wherewith they are charged,\r\nthen if the Acres were so much the fewer; or then men are, who\r\nbuy Land, out of which they know Tythes are to be paid. And truly\r\nthat Countrey is happy, in which by Original Accord, such a Rent\r\nis reserved, as whereby the Publick charge may be born, without\r\ncontingent, sudden, superadditions, in which lies the very _Ratio_\r\nof the burthen of all Contributions and Exactions. For in such\r\ncases, as was said before, it is not onely the Landlord payes, but\r\nevery man who eats but an Egg, or an Onion of the growth of his\r\nLands; or who useth the help of any Artisan, which feedeth on the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n5. But if the same were propounded in _England_, _viz._ if an\r\naliquot part of every Landlords Rent were excinded or retrenched,\r\nthen those whose Rents were settled, and determined for long times\r\nto come, would chiefly bear the burthen of such an Imposition,\r\nand others have a benefit thereby. For suppose _A._ and _B._\r\nhave each of them a parcel of Land, of equal goodness and value;\r\nsuppose also that _A._ hath let his parcel for twenty one years at\r\ntwenty pound _per annum_, but that _B._ is free; now there comes\r\nout a Taxe of a fifth part; hereupon _B._ will not let under 25_l._\r\nthat his remainder may be twenty, whereas _A._ must be contented\r\nwith sixteen neat; nevertheless the Tenants of _A._ will sell the\r\nproceed of their bargain at the same rate, that the Tenants of _B._\r\nshall do. The effect of all this is; First, that the Kings fifth\r\npart of _B._ his Farm, shall be greater then before. Secondly, that\r\nthe Farmer to _B._ shall gain more then before the Taxe. Thirdly,\r\nthat the Tenant or Farmer of _A._ shall gain as much as the King\r\nand Tenant to _B._ both. Fourthly, the Tax doth ultimately light\r\nupon the Landlord _A._ and the Consumptioners. From whence it\r\nfollows, that a Land-taxe resolves into an irregular Excize upon\r\nconsumptions, that those bear it most, who least complain. And\r\nlastly, that some Landlords may gain, and onely such whose Rents\r\nare predetermined shall loose; and that doubly, _viz._ one way\r\nby the raising of their revenues, and the other by enhansing the\r\nprices of provisions upon them.\r\n\r\n6. Another way is an _Excisum_ out of the Rent of Houseing,\r\nwhich is much more uncertain then that of Land. For an House is\r\nof a double nature, _viz._ one, wherein it is a way and means of\r\nexpence; the other, as ’tis an Instrument and Tool of gain: for\r\na Shop in _London_ of less capacity and less charge in building\r\nthen a fair Dining-Room in the same House, unto which both do\r\nbelong, shall nevertheless be of the greater value; so also shall\r\na Dungeon, Sellar, then a pleasant Chamber; because the one is\r\nexpence, the other profit. Now the way of a Land-taxe rates\r\nhousing, as of the latter nature, but the Excize, as of the former.\r\n\r\n7. We might adde hereunto, that housing is sometimes\r\ndisproportionally taxed to discourage Building, especially upon\r\nnew Foundations, thereby to prevent the growth of a City; suppose\r\n_London_, such excessive and overgrown Cities being dangerous to\r\nMonarchy, though the more secure when the Supremacy is in Citizens\r\nof such places themselves, as in _Venice_.\r\n\r\n8. But we say, that such checking of new Buildings signifies\r\nnothing to this purpose; for as much as Buildings do not encrease,\r\nuntil the People already have increased: but the remedy of the\r\nabovementioned dangers is to be sought in the causes of the\r\nencrease of People, the which if they can be nipt, the other work\r\nwill necessarily be done.\r\n\r\nBut what then is the true effect of forbidding to build upon new\r\nfoundations? I answer to keep and fasten the City to its old seat\r\nand ground-plot, the which encouragement for new Buildings will\r\nremove, as it comes to pass almost in all great Cities, though\r\ninsensibly, and not under many years progression.\r\n\r\n9. The reason whereof is, because men are unwilling to build new\r\nhouses at the charge of pulling down their old, where both the old\r\nhouse it self, and the ground it stands upon do make a much dearer\r\nground-plot for a new house, and yet far less free and convenient;\r\nwherefore men build upon new free foundations, and cobble up old\r\nhouses, until they become fundamentally irreparable, at which time\r\nthey become either the dwelling of the Rascality, or in process of\r\ntime return to waste and Gardens again, examples whereof are many\r\neven about _London_.\r\n\r\nNow if great Cities are naturally apt to remove their Seats, I ask\r\nwhich way? I say, in the case of _London_, it must be Westward,\r\nbecause the Windes blowing near 3./4. of the year from the West,\r\nthe dwellings of the West end are so much the more free from the\r\nfumes, steams, and stinks of the whole Easterly Pyle; which where\r\nSeacoal is burnt is a great matter. Now if it follow from hence,\r\nthat the Pallaces of the greatest men will remove Westward, it will\r\nalso naturally follow, that the dwellings of others who depend upon\r\nthem will creep after them. This we see in _London_, where the\r\nNoblemens ancient houses are now become Halls for Companies, or\r\nturned Into Tenements, and All the Pallaces are Gotten Westward;\r\nInsomuch, As I Do Not Doubt but That Five Hundred Years Hence,\r\nThe Kings Pallace will be near _Chelsey_, and the Old Building Of\r\n_Whitehall_ converted to uses more answerable to their quality. For\r\nto build a new Royal Pallace upon the same ground will be too great\r\na confinement, in respect of Gardens and other magnificencies,\r\nand withall a disaccommodation in the time of the work; but it\r\nrather seems to me, that the next Palace will be built from the\r\nwhole present contignation of houses at such a distance as the old\r\nPallace of _Westminster_ was from the City of _London_, when the\r\nArchers began to bend their bowes just without _Ludgate_, and when\r\nall the space between the _Thames_, _Fleet-street_, and _Holborn_\r\nwas as _Finsbury-Fields_ are now.\r\n\r\n10. This digression I confess to be both impertinent to the\r\nbusiness of Taxes, and in it self almost needless; for why should\r\nwe trouble our selves what shall be five hundred years hence, not\r\nknowing what a day may bring forth; and since ’tis not unlikely,\r\nbut that before that time we may be all transplanted from hence\r\ninto _America_, these Countreys being overrun with Turks, and made\r\nwaste, as the Seats of the famous Eastern Empires at this day are.\r\n\r\n11. Onely I think ’tis certain, that while ever there are people\r\nin _England_, the greatest cohabitation of them will be about the\r\nplace which is now _London_, the _Thames_ being the most commodious\r\nRiver of this Island, and the seat of _London_ the most commodious\r\npart of the _Thames_; so much doth the means of facilitating\r\nCarriage greaten a City, which may put us in minde of employing our\r\nidle hands about mending the High-wayes, making Bridges, Cawseys,\r\nand Rivers navigable: Which considerations brings me back round\r\ninto my way of Taxes, from whence I digrest.\r\n\r\n12. But before we talk too much of Rents in order to Taxes, we\r\nshould endeavour to explain the mysterious nature of them, with\r\nreference as well to Money, the rent of which we call usury; as to\r\nthat of Lands and Houses, aforementioned.\r\n\r\n13. Suppose a man could with his own hands plant a certain scope of\r\nLand with Corn, that is, could Digg, or Plough, Harrow, Weed, Reap,\r\nCarry home, Thresh, and Winnow so much as the Husbandry of this\r\nLand requires; and had withal Seed wherewith to sowe the same. I\r\nsay, that when this man hath subducted his seed out of the proceed\r\nof his Harvest, and also, what himself hath both eaten and given to\r\nothers in exchange for Clothes, and other Natural necessaries; that\r\nthe remainder of Corn, is the natural and true Rent of the Land for\r\nthat year; and the _medium_ of seven years, or rather of so many\r\nyears as makes up the Cycle, within which Dearths and Plenties\r\nmake their revolution, doth give the ordinary Rent of the Land in\r\nCorn.\r\n\r\n14. But a further, though collaterall question may be, how much\r\nEnglish money this Corn or Rent is worth? I answer, so much as\r\nthe money, which another single man can save, within the same\r\ntime, over and above his expence, if he imployed himself wholly\r\nto produce and make it; _viz._ Let another man go travel into a\r\nCountrey where is Silver, there Dig it, Refine it, bring it to the\r\nsame place where the other man planted his Corn; Coyne it, &c. the\r\nsame person, all the while of his working for Silver, gathering\r\nalso food for his necessary livelihood, and procuring himself\r\ncovering, &c. I say, the Silver of the one, must be esteemed of\r\nequal value with the Corn of the other; the one being perhaps\r\ntwenty Ounces, and the other twenty Bushels. From whence it\r\nfollows, that the price of a Bushel of this Corn to be an Ounce of\r\nSilver.\r\n\r\n15. And forasmuch as possibly there may be more Art and Hazzard\r\nin working about the Silver, then about the Corn, yet all comes\r\nto the same pass; for let a hundred men work ten years upon Corn,\r\nand the same number of men, the same time, upon Silver; I say,\r\nthat the neat proceed of the Silver is the price of the whole neat\r\nproceed of the Corn, and like parts of the one, the price of like\r\nparts of the other. Although not so many of those who wrought in\r\nSilver, learned the Art of refining and coining, or out-lived the\r\ndangers and diseases of working in the Mines. And this also is the\r\nway of pitching the true proportion, between the values of Gold and\r\nSilver, which many times is set but by popular errour, sometimes\r\nmore, sometimes less, diffused in the world; which errour (by the\r\nway) is the cause of our having been pestred with too much Gold\r\nheretofore, and wanting it now.\r\n\r\n16. This, I say, to be the foundation of equallizing and ballancing\r\nof values; yet in the superstructures and practices hereupon, I\r\nconfess there is much variety, and intricacy; of which hereafter.\r\n\r\n17. The world measures things by Gold and Silver, but principally\r\nthe latter; for there may not be two measures, and consequently\r\nthe better of many must be the onely of all; that is, by fine\r\nsilver of a certain weight; but now if it be hard to measure the\r\nweight and fineness of silver, as by the different reports of the\r\nablest Saymasters I have known it to be; and if silver granted to\r\nbe of the same fineness and weight, rise and fall in its price,\r\nand be more worth at one place then another, not onely for being\r\nfarther from the Mines, but for other accidents, and may be more\r\nworth at present, then a moneth or other small time hence; and if\r\nit differ in its proportion unto the several things valued by it,\r\nin several ages upon the increase and diminution thereof, we shall\r\nendeavour to examine some other natural Standards and Measures,\r\nwithout derogating from the excellent use of these.\r\n\r\n18. Our Silver and Gold we call by severall names, as in _England_\r\nby pounds, shillings, and pence, all which may be called and\r\nunderstood by either of the three. But that which I would say upon\r\nthis matter is, that all things ought to be valued by two natural\r\nDenominations, which is Land and Labour; that is, we ought to\r\nsay, a Ship or garment is worth such a measure of Land, with such\r\nanother measure of Labour; forasmuch as both Ships and Garments\r\nwere the creatures of Lands and mens Labours thereupon: This being\r\ntrue, we should be glad to finde out a natural Par between Land and\r\nLabour, so as we might express the value by either of them alone\r\nas well or better then by both, and reduce one into the other as\r\neasily and certainly as we reduce pence into pounds. Wherefore we\r\nwould be glad to finde the natural values of the Fee simple of\r\nLand, though but no better then we have done that of the _usus\r\nfructus_ abovementioned, which we attempt as followeth.\r\n\r\n19. Having found the Rent or value of the _usus fructus per annum_,\r\nthe question is, how many years purchase (as we usually say) is\r\nthe Fee simple naturally worth? If we say an infinite number, then\r\nan Acre of Land would be equal in value to a thousand Acres of the\r\nsame Land; which is absurd, an infinity of unities being equal to\r\nan infinity of thousands. Wherefore we must pitch upon some limited\r\nnumber, and that I apprehend to be the number of years, which I\r\nconceive one man of fifty years old, another of twenty eight, and\r\nanother of seven years old, all being alive together may be thought\r\nto live; that is to say, of a Grandfather, Father, and Childe;\r\nfew men having reason to take care of more remote Posterity: for\r\nif a man be a great Grandfather, he himself is so much the nearer\r\nhis end, so as there are but three in a continual line of descent\r\nusually co-existing together; and as some are Grandfathers at forty\r\nyears, yet as many are not till above sixty, and _sic de cæteris_.\r\n\r\n20. Wherefore I pitch the number of years purchase, that any\r\nLand is naturally worth, to be the ordinary extent of three such\r\npersons their lives. Now in _England_ we esteem three lives equal\r\nto one and twenty years, and consequently the value of Land, to be\r\nabout the same number of years purchase. Possibly if they thought\r\nthemselves mistaken in the one, (as the observator on the Bills of\r\nMortality thinks they are) they would alter in the other, unless\r\nthe confederation of the force of popular errour and dependance of\r\nthings already concatenated, did hinder them.\r\n\r\n21. This I esteem to be the number of years purchase where Titles\r\nare good, and where there is a moral certainty of enjoying the\r\npurchase. But in other Countreys Lands are worth nearer thirty\r\nyears purchase, by reason of the better Titles, more people, and\r\nperhaps truer opinion of the value and duration of three lives.\r\n\r\n22. And in some places, Lands are worth yet more years purchase\r\nby reason of some special honour, pleasures, priviledge or\r\njurisdiction annexed unto them.\r\n\r\n23. On the other hand, Lands are worth fewer years purchase (as in\r\n_Ireland_) for the following reasons, which I have here set down,\r\nas unto the like whereof the cause of the like cheapness in any\r\nother place may be imputed.\r\n\r\nFirst, In _Ireland_ by reason of the frequent Rebellions, (in\r\nwhich if you are conquered, all is lost; or if you conquer, yet\r\nyou are subject to swarms of thieves and robbers) and the envy\r\nwhich precedent missions of English have against the subsequent,\r\nperpetuity it self is but forty years long, as within which time\r\nsome ugly disturbance hath hitherto happened almost ever since the\r\nfirst coming of the English thither.\r\n\r\n24. 2. The Claims upon Claims which each hath to the others\r\nEstates, and the facility of making good any pretence whatsoever\r\nby the favour of some one or other of the many Governours and\r\nMinisters which within forty years shall be in power there; as also\r\nby the frequency of false testimonies, and abuse of solemn Oaths.\r\n\r\n25. 3. The paucity of Inhabitants, there being not above the\r\n1./5.^{th.} part so many as the Territory would maintain, and of\r\nthose but a small part do work at all, and yet a smaller work so\r\nmuch as in other Countreys.\r\n\r\n26. 4. That a great part of the Estates both real and personal\r\nin _Ireland_ are owned by Absentees, and such as draw over the\r\nprofits raised out of _Ireland_ refunding nothing; so as _Ireland_\r\nexporting more then it imports doth yet grow poorer to a paradox.\r\n\r\n27. 5. The difficulty of executing justice, so many of those in\r\npower being themselves protected by Offices, and protecting others.\r\nMoreover, the number of criminous and indebted persons being\r\ngreat, they favour their like in Juries, Offices, and wheresoever\r\nthey can: Besides the Countrey is seldom rich enough to give\r\ndue encouragement to profound Judges and Lawyers, which makes\r\njudgements very casual; ignorant men being more apt to be bold and\r\narbitrary, then such as understand the dangers of it. But all this\r\na little care in due season might remedy, so as to bring _Ireland_\r\nin a few years to the same level of values with other places; but\r\nof this also elsewhere more at large, for in the next place we\r\nshall come to Usury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\n_Of Usury._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat reason there is for taking or giving Interest or Usury for any\r\nthing which we may certainly have again whensoever we call for it,\r\nI see not; nor why Usury should be scrupled, where money or other\r\nnecessaries valued by it, is lent to be paid at such a time and\r\nplace as the Borrower chuseth, so as the Lender cannot have his\r\nmoney paid him back where and when himself pleaseth, I also see\r\nnot. Wherefore when a man giveth out his money upon condition that\r\nhe may not demand it back until a certain time to come, whatsoever\r\nhis own necessities shall be in the mean time, he certainly may\r\ntake a compensation for this inconvenience which he admits against\r\nhimself: And this allowance is that we commonly call Usury.\r\n\r\n2. And when one man furnisheth another with money at some distant\r\nplace, and engages under great Penalties to pay him there, and at\r\na certain day besides; the consideration for this, is that we call\r\nExchange or local Usury.\r\n\r\nAs for example, if a man wanting money at _Carlisle_ in the\r\nheat of the late Civil Wars, when the way was full of Souldiers\r\nand Robbers, and the passage by Sea very long, troublesome, and\r\ndangerous, and seldom passed; why might not another take much more\r\nthen an 100_l._ at _London_ for warranting the like summe to be paid\r\nat _Carlisle_ on a certain day?\r\n\r\n3. Now the Questions arising hence are; what are the natural\r\nStandards of Usury and Exchange? As for Usury, the least that\r\ncan be, is the Rent of so much Land as the money lent will\r\nbuy, where the security is undoubted; but where the security\r\nis casual, then a kinde of ensurance must be enterwoven with\r\nthe simple natural Interest, which may advance the Usury very\r\nconscionably unto any height below the Principal it self. Now if\r\nthings are so in _England_, that really there is no such security\r\nas abovementioned, but that all are more or less hazardous,\r\ntroublesome, or chargeable to make, I see no reason for endeavoring\r\nto limit Usury upon time, any more then that upon place, which\r\nthe practice of the world doth not, unless it be that those who\r\nmake such Laws were rather Borrowers then Lenders: But of the\r\nvanity and fruitlessness of making Civil Positive Laws against the\r\nLaws of Nature, I have spoken elsewhere, and instanced in several\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\n4. As for the natural measures of Exchange, I say, that in times\r\nof Peace, the greatest Exchange can be but the labour of carrying\r\nthe money _in specie_, but where are hazards and emergent uses for\r\nmoney more in one place then another, &c. or opinions of these true\r\nor false, the Exchange will be governed by them.\r\n\r\n5. Parallel unto this, is something which we omitted concerning\r\nthe price of Land; for as great need of money heightens Exchange,\r\nso doth great need of Corn raise the price of that likewise, and\r\nconsequently of the Rent of the Land that bears Corn, and lastly\r\nof the Land it self; as for example, if the Corn which feedeth\r\n_London_, or an Army, be brought forty miles thither, then the Corn\r\ngrowing within a mile of _London_, or the quarters of such Army,\r\nshall have added unto its natural price, so much as the charge of\r\nbringing it thirty nine miles doth amount unto: And unto perishable\r\nCommodities as fresh fish, fruits, &c. the ensurance upon the\r\nhazard of corrupting, &c. shall be added also; and finally unto\r\nhim that eats these things there (suppose in Taverns) shall be\r\nadded the charge of all the circumstancial apparatus of House-rent,\r\nFurniture, Attendance, and the Cooks skill as well as his labour to\r\naccompany the same.\r\n\r\n6. Hence it comes to pass, that Lands intrinsically alike near\r\npopulous places, such as where the perimeter of the Area that feeds\r\nthem is great, will not onely yield more Rent for these Reasons,\r\nbut also more years purchase then in remote places, by reason of\r\nthe pleasure and honour extraordinary of having Lands there; for\r\n\r\n  ----_Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci._\r\n\r\n7. Having finished our digression upon the measures of the Rents\r\nand Values of Lands and Moneys, we now return to our second way of\r\nleavying Publick Charges, which was the taking of a proportion of\r\nthe Rent, (commonly called Assessment) it follows next to speak\r\nof the way of computing the said Rents, otherwise then according\r\nto the bargains which a few men make one with another, through\r\nignorance, haste, false suggestion, or else in their passion or\r\ndrink: Although I acknowledge, that the medium or common result of\r\nall the bargains made within three years (or other such Cycle of\r\ntime, as within which all contingencies of Land revolve) may be\r\nvery sufficient to this purpose, being but the summe synthetically\r\ncomputed by casual opinions, as I would endeavour to cast up\r\nanalytically by a distinct particularizing of the Causes.\r\n\r\n8. 1. Therefore I propound a Survey of the Figures, Quantities, and\r\nScituations of all the Lands both according to the civil bounds of\r\nParishes, Farms, &c. and the natural distinctions thereof by the\r\nSea, Rivers, ridges of Rocks, or Mountains, &c.\r\n\r\n9. 2. I propound that the quality of each denomination were\r\ndescribed by the Commodities it had usually born, in some Land,\r\nsome sort of Timber, Grain, pulse or root growing more happily then\r\nin others: Also by the encrease of things sown or planted, which\r\nit hath yielded _communibus annis_; and withall, the comparative\r\ngoodness of the said Commodities not unto the common Standard\r\nmoney, but to one another. As for example; if there be ten acres\r\nof Land, I would have it judged whether they be better for Hay or\r\nCorn; if for Hay, whether the said ten Acres will bear more or\r\nless of Hay then ten other Acres; and whether an hundred weight\r\nof the said Hay will feed or fatten more or less, then the same\r\nweight of other Hay, and not as yet comparing it to money, in which\r\nthe value of the said Hay will be more or less, according to the\r\nplenty of money, which hath changed strangely since the discovery\r\nof the _West Indies_, and according to the multitudes of people\r\nliving near this Land, together with the luxurious or frugal\r\nliving of them; and besides all, according to the Civil, Natural,\r\nand Religious Opinions of the said people: As for example, Eggs in\r\nthe fore-part of Lent (because their goodness and delicacy decayes\r\nbefore Lent be done) being worth little in some Popish Countreys;\r\nnor Swines flesh among the Jews, nor Hedgehogs, Frogs, Snails,\r\nMushrooms, &c. to those that fear to eat them, as poisonous or\r\nunwholesome; nor Currans and Spanish Wines, if they were all to be\r\ndestroyed as the great thieves of this Nation, by an Edict of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\n10. This former I call a Survey or Inquisition into the intrinsick\r\nValues of Land, this latter of extrinsick or accidentall follows.\r\nWe said, that the change of the store of money would change the\r\nrates of commodities according to our reckoning in names and words,\r\n(pounds, shillings, and pence being nothing else) as for example:\r\n\r\nIf a man can bring to _London_ an ounce of Silver out of the Earth\r\nin _Peru_, in the same time that he can produce a bushel of Corn,\r\nthen one is the natural price of the other; now if by reason of new\r\nand more easie Mines a man can get two ounces of Silver as easily\r\nas formerly he did one, then Corn will be as cheap at ten shillings\r\nthe bushel, as it was before at five shillings _cæteris paribus_.\r\n\r\n11. It behoves us therefore to have a way, whereby to tell the\r\nmoney of our Countrey (which I think I have, and that in a short\r\ntime, and without cost, and (which is more) without looking into\r\nparticular mens pockets; of which hereafter.) Now if we know what\r\nGold and Silver we had in _England_ two hundred years ago, and\r\ncould tell it again now; and though we also knew the difference of\r\nour denominations then, when thirty seven shillings were made out\r\nthe same quantity of Silver as sixty two are now; also that of the\r\nalloy, labour in Coinage, remedies for weight and fineness, and\r\nduties to the King; nay, if we also knew the Labourers wages then\r\nand now, yet all this would not shew the difference of the Riches\r\nof our Nation even in money alone.\r\n\r\n12. Wherefore we must adde to the premises, the knowledge of the\r\ndifference of the numbers of the people, and conclude, that if\r\nall the money in the Nation were equally divided amongst all the\r\npeople both then and now, that that time wherein each Devisee had\r\nwherewith to hire most labourers, was the richer. So that we want\r\nthe knowledge of the People and Bullion which is now in this Land,\r\nand which was heretofore; all which I think may be found out even\r\nfor the time past, but more probably for the time present and to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n13. But to proceed; suppose we had them, then we would pitch the\r\naccidental values upon our Lands about _London_; as thus, _viz._ We\r\nwould first at hazzard compute the materials for food and covering,\r\nwhich the Shires of _Essex_, _Kent_, _Surrey_, _Middlesex_ and\r\n_Hertford_, next circumjacent to _London_, did _communibus annis_\r\nproduce; and would withal compute the Consumptioners of them living\r\nin the said five Shires and _London_. The which if I found to be\r\nmore then were the Consumptioners living upon the like scope of\r\nother Land, or rather upon as much other Land as bore the like\r\nquantity of Provisions. Then I say, that Provisions must be dearer\r\nin the said five Shires then in the other; and within the said\r\nShires cheaper or dearer as the way to _London_ was more or less\r\nlong, or rather more or less chargeable.\r\n\r\n14. For if the said five Shires did already produce as much\r\nCommodity, as by all endeavour was possible; then what is wanting\r\nmust be brought from a far, and that which is near, advanced in\r\nprice accordingly; or if the said Shires by greater labour then now\r\nis used, (as by digging instead of Ploughing, setting instead of\r\nsowing, picking of choice seed instead of taking it promiscuously,\r\nsteeping it instead of using it wholly unprepared, and manuring the\r\nground with salt instead of rotten straw, &c. could be fertilized)\r\nthen will the Rent be as much more advanced, as the excess of\r\nencrease exceeds that of the labour.\r\n\r\n15. Now the price of labour must be certain, (as we see it made by\r\nthe Statutes which limit the day wages of several workmen); the\r\nnon-observance of which Laws, and the not adapting them to the\r\nchange of times, is by the way very dangerous, and confusive to\r\nall endeavours of bettering the Trade of the Nation.\r\n\r\n16. Moreover, the touchstone to try whether it be better to use\r\nthose improvements or not, is to examine whether the labour\r\nof fetching these things even from the places where they grow\r\nwilde, or with less Culture, be not less then that of the said\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\n17. Against all this will be objected, that these computations are\r\nvery hard if not impossible to make; to which I answer onely this,\r\nthat they are so, especially if none will trouble their hands or\r\nheads to make them, or give authority for so doing: But withall,\r\nI say, that until this be done, Trade will be too conjectural a\r\nwork for any man to employ his thoughts about; for it will be the\r\nsame wisdom in order to win with fair Dice, to spend much time in\r\nconsidering how to hold them, how much to shake them, and how hard\r\nto throw them, and on what angles they should hit the side of the\r\nTables, as to consider how to advance the Trade of this Nation;\r\nwhere at present particular men get from their neighbours (not\r\nfrom the earth and sea) rather by hit then wit, and by the false\r\nopinions of others, rather then their own judgements; Credit every\r\nwhere, but chiefly in _London_, being become a meer conceit, that\r\na man is responsible or not, without any certain knowledge of his\r\nWealth or true Estate. Whereas I think the nature of credit should\r\nbe limited onely to an opinion of a mans faculties to get by his\r\nart and industry. The way of knowing his Estate being to be made\r\ncertain, and the way of making him pay what he owes to the utmost\r\nof his ability, being to be expected from the good execution of our\r\nLaws.\r\n\r\n18. I should here enlarge upon a Paradox, to prove that if every\r\nmans Estate could be alwayes read in his forehead, our Trade would\r\nmuch be advanced thereby, although the poorer ambitious man be\r\ncommonly the more industrious. But of this elsewhere.\r\n\r\n19. The next objection against this so exact computation of the\r\nRents and worth of Lands, &c. is, that the Sovereign would know too\r\nexactly every mans Estate; to which I answer, that if the Charge\r\nof the Nation be brought as low as it may be, (which depends much\r\nupon the people in Parliament to do) and if the people be willing\r\nand ready to pay, and if care be taken, that although they have not\r\nready money, the credit of their Lands and Goods shall be as good;\r\nand lastly, that it would be a great discommodity to the Prince to\r\ntake more then he needs, as was proved before; where is the evil\r\nof this so exact knowledge? And as for the proportion of every\r\nContributor, why should any man hope or accept to ease himself by\r\nhis craft and interest in a confusion? or why should he not fear,\r\nthough he may be advantaged this time, to suffer in the next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\n_Of Customs and Free Ports._\r\n\r\n\r\nCustom is a Contribution or Excisum out of Goods sent out or\r\nimported into the Princes Dominions: In these Countreys of a\r\ntwentieth part not according to the Prices currant among Merchants\r\nof each respective Commodity, but according to other standing Rates\r\nset by the State, though advised for the most part by concerned\r\nPersons.\r\n\r\n2. I cannot well imagine what should be the natural Reasons, why\r\na Prince should be paid this duty inward and outward both; there\r\nseems indeed to be some, why he should be paid for indulging the\r\nExportation of some such things as other Countreys do really want.\r\n\r\n3. Wherefore I think, that Customs at the first were a _præmium_\r\nallowed the Prince for protecting the Carriage of Goods both inward\r\nand outward from the Pyrats; and this I should verily believe, if\r\nthe Prince were bound to make good losses of that kinde. And I\r\nthought that the proportion of five pound _per cent._ was pitched\r\nupon computation, that the Merchants before the said undertaking\r\nand composition, had usually lost more by Pyracy: And finally, that\r\nthe Customs had been an ensurance upon losses by enemies, as the\r\nensurance now usual, is of the casualties of sea, winde, weather\r\nand Vessel, or altogether; or like the ensurance in some Countreys\r\nof Houses from Fires for a certain small part of their yearly Rent.\r\nBut be it what it will, it is anciently established by Law, and\r\nought to be paid until it shall be abolished. Onely I take leave as\r\nan idle Philosopher to discourse upon the Nature and Measures of it.\r\n\r\n4. The Measures of Customs outwards may be such, as after\r\nreasonable profit to the Exporter will leave such of our own\r\nCommodities as are necessary to Forreigners somewhat cheaper unto\r\nthem then they can be had from elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs for example, Tin is a Native Commodity, which governs the Market\r\nabroad, that is, there is none so good and so easie to be had and\r\nexported.\r\n\r\nNow suppose Tin might be made in _Cornwall_ for four pence the\r\npound, and that the same would yield twelve pence at the nearest\r\npart in _France_, I say, that this extraordinary profit ought to\r\nbe esteemed as a Mine Royal, or _Tresor Trové_, and the Sovereign\r\nought to have his share in it: Which he will have, by imposing\r\nso great a duty upon Tin Exported, as on one side may leave a\r\nsubsistence to the Workmen, (and no more) with a competent profit\r\nto the owners of the ground; and on the other side, may leave the\r\nprice abroad less then that for which Tin may be had from any other\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n5. The same Imposition might also be made on the Tin spent at home,\r\nunless it be as impossible so to do, as for the King of _France_ to\r\nimpose the Gabel upon Salt in the very places where it is made.\r\n\r\n6. But it is observed, that such high duties make men endeavour\r\nnot to enter any such Goods at all, or pay for them, provided the\r\ncharge of smuckling and bribing, with the hazzard of being seized\r\ndo not _communibus vicibus_ exceed the Duty.\r\n\r\n7. Wherefore the Measures of this Nature are, that it be more\r\neasie, safe, and profitable for men to keep the Law, then to break\r\nit, unless it be in such cases, where the Magistrate can with\r\ncertainty execute the Law. As for example, it would be hard to save\r\nthe Duties upon Horses shipped at a small Port, without adjacent\r\nCreeks, and that but some certain two hours every Tide, forasmuch\r\nas Horses cannot be disguised, put up in bags or cask, nor shipped\r\nwithout noise and the help of many hands.\r\n\r\n8. The Measures of Customs upon imported Commodities are; 1. That\r\nall things ready and ripe for Consumption may be made somewhat\r\ndearer then the same things grown or made at home; if the same be\r\nfeasible _cæteris paribus_.\r\n\r\n2. That all Superfluities tending to Luxury and sin, might be\r\nloaded with so much Impost, as to serve instead of a sumptuary Law\r\nto restrain the use of them. But here also care is to be had that\r\nit be not better to smuckle then to pay.\r\n\r\n9. On the contrary, all things not fully wrought and Manufactured,\r\nas raw Hides, Wool, Beaver, Raw-silk, Cotton; as also all Tools and\r\nMaterials for Manufacture, as also Dying-stuff, &c. ought to be\r\ngently dealt with.\r\n\r\n10. If to leavy the payment of these Duties could be most exactly\r\nperformed, Princes might strangely practice one upon another;\r\nwherefore since they cannot, the people pay no more then they\r\ncannot with greater safety upon the whole matter save, nor observe\r\nany more of these Laws, then they cannot elude.\r\n\r\n11. The Inconveniences of the way of Customs, are, _viz._\r\n\r\n1. That Duties are laid upon things not yet ripe for use,\r\nupon Commodities in _fieri_, and but in the way of their full\r\nimprovements, which seems the same ill-husbandry, as to make fuel\r\nof young Saplings, instead of Dotards and Pollards.\r\n\r\n2. The great number of Officers requisite to Collect the said\r\nDuties, especially in a Countrey where the Harbours are many, and\r\nthe Tides convenient for shipping of Goods at any time.\r\n\r\n3. The great facility of smuckling by Briberies, Collusions,\r\nhiding and disguising of Commodities, &c. and all this\r\nnotwithstanding Oaths and Penalties, and withall by the several\r\nwayes of mitigating and taking off the said Penalties even after\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\n4. The Customs or Duties upon the few Commodities of the growth\r\nof _England_ exchanged with Foreigners, make too small a part of\r\nthe whole Expence of the people of this Kingdom, which (perhaps\r\nis not less then fifty millions of pounds _per annum_) out of\r\nwhich to bear the common Charges thereof, so as some other way\r\nof Leavy must be practised together with it; whereas by some one\r\nway, if the best, the whole work may be absolved: wherefore ’tis\r\nan inconvenience in the way of Customs, that it necessitates other\r\nwayes then it self.\r\n\r\n12. Now as a small attempt of a Remedy or Expedient herein, I offer\r\nrather, that instead of the Customs upon Goods shipped, every Ship\r\nthat goes in or out, may pay a Tonnage, the same being collectible\r\nby a very few hands, as a matter visible to all the world; and\r\nthat the said Duty be but such a part of the Fraight, as the like\r\nwhereof being excinded out of the whole Consumption, would defray\r\nall the Publique Charge; which part perhaps is 4. _per Cent._ or\r\nthereabouts, _viz._ two millions _per annum_ out of fifty.\r\n\r\n13. The other is, that the Customs be reduced into the nature of an\r\nEnsurance-_præmium_, and that the same be augmented and fitted, as\r\nwhereby the King may afford to ensure the goods as well against the\r\nSea as Enemies; by which means the whole Nation would be concerned\r\nin all such losses, and then the Merchant for his own sake would\r\nmore willingly enter and pay for whatsoever he would have ensured.\r\n\r\n14. But it will be here objected, that although the duty of Customs\r\nbe abrogated, yet that there must be almost the same number of\r\nOfficers maintained as now to prevent the bringing in and carrying\r\nout of prohibited Commodities. Wherefore we shall here state the\r\nnature of such Prohibitions by two or three grand instances.\r\n\r\n15. To prohibit the Exportation of Money, in that it is a thing\r\nalmost impracticable, it is almost nugatory and vain; And the\r\ndanger of it resolves either into a kinde of Ensurance answerable\r\nto the danger of being seized, or unto a Surcharge of a Composition\r\nby bribing the Searchers. As for example, If but one in fifty\r\nExportations are seized, or if twenty shillings be usually taken\r\nfor conniving at fifty pounds, then the Commodities bought with\r\nthis Money must be sold two at least _per cent._ the dearer to\r\nthe Consumptioner. Now if the Trade will not bear this Surcharge,\r\nthen Money will not be exported with discretion. Now the use of\r\nthis Prohibition, supposing it practicable, is to serve as a\r\nsumptuary Law, and to binde the Nation in general not to spend\r\nmore then they get; for if we could export no Commodity of our\r\nown growth or manufacture then by prohibiting the going out of\r\nMoney, it is also _ipso facto_ commanded that nothing forreign\r\nshould be brought in. Again supposing, that ordinarily we export\r\nenough to furnish us with all Forreign Commodities, but upon some\r\nextraordinary decay of our Land or hands, we are able to export but\r\nhalf as much as would procure our ordinary proportion of Forreign\r\nGoods, then the Prohibition of Money performs indeed the part of\r\na sumptuary Law, in hindring us to bring in any more then half as\r\nmuch Forreign Commodities as we formerly used, onely it leaves it\r\nto the discretion of the Merchant, to chose which he will neglect\r\nor forbear to bring in, and which not; whereas in sumptuary Laws\r\nthe State taketh this care upon themselves. As for example, If we\r\nwanted Exportation to ballance our Importations by forty thousand\r\npounds, and suppose for examples sake, that the Importation of\r\nforty thousand pounds worth of Coffee-Berries, or the like of\r\nSpanish Wine must be retrenched; in this case, the said Prohibition\r\nof Money will do one, or some of the one, and some of the other as\r\nthe Merchant himself pleases: But the sumptuary Law determines,\r\nwhether we shall encourage and keep fair with the Nation that sends\r\nus Wine rather then that which sends us Coffee, and whether the\r\nExpence of Wine or Coffee be most prejudicial to our people, &c.\r\n\r\n16. The benefits alledged for the free Exportation of Money is\r\nmeerly this, _viz._ That if a Ship carrying out of _England_ forty\r\nthousand pounds worth of Cloth, might also carry with it forty\r\nthousand pounds in Money, then could the Merchant stand the stiffer\r\nupon his terms, and in fine would buy cheaper, and sell dearer;\r\nbut by the way, the Merchant buyes this power with the Interest\r\nand advantage of the Money he carries, which if it amount to five\r\npound _per Cent._ then he had better sold his Goods at four pound\r\n_per Cent._ under rate, then to have fortified himself with Money\r\nas aforesaid. But of this more may be said, we hasten to the great\r\npoint of Wool.\r\n\r\n17. The Hollanders having gotten away our Manufacture of Cloth, by\r\nbecoming able to work with more art, to labour and fare harder, to\r\ntake less fraight, Duties and Ensurance, hath so madded us here\r\nin _England_, that we have been apt to think of such exorbitantly\r\nfierce wayes of prohibiting Wool and Earth to be exported, as\r\nperhaps would do us twice as much harm as the losse of our said\r\nTrade. Wherefore to return to our Wits and Trade again, before we\r\ncan tell what to do in this case, we must consider;\r\n\r\n1. That we are often forced to buy Corn from abroad, and as often\r\ncomplain that we are pestered with abundance of idle hands at home,\r\nand withall that we cannot vend the Woollen Manufactures even which\r\nour few working hands do produce. In this case were it not better\r\nto lessen our sheep-trade, and convert our hands to more Tillage?\r\nBecause 1. Flesh becomming dearer, there would be encouragement\r\nfor Fish, which will never be till then. 2. Our Money would not\r\nrun so fast away for Corn. 3. We should have no such Gluts of Wool\r\nupon our hands. 4. Our idle hands would be employed in Tillage and\r\nFishing, one man by the way of grazing, tilling as it were many\r\nthousand Acres of Land by himself and his Dog.\r\n\r\n2. Suppose we wanted no Corn, nor had any idle hands, and yet\r\nthat we abounded with more Wool then we can work up; in this case\r\ncertainly Wool might be exported, because ’tis supposed, that the\r\nhands which work are already employed upon a better Trade.\r\n\r\n3. Suppose the Hollander outdo us by more art, were it not better\r\nto draw over a number of their choice Workmen, or send our most\r\ningenious men thither to learn; which if they succeed; it is most\r\nmanifest, that this were the more natural way, then to keep that\r\ninfinite clutter about resisting of Nature, stopping up the windes\r\nand seas, &c.\r\n\r\n4. If we can make Victual much cheaper here then in _Holland_, take\r\naway burdensome, frivolous, and antiquated Impositions and Offices.\r\n\r\nI conceive even this were better then to perswade Water to rise of\r\nit self above its natural Spring.\r\n\r\n5. We must consider in general, that as wiser Physicians tamper not\r\nexcessively with their Patients, rather observing and complying\r\nwith the motions of nature, then contradicting it with vehement\r\nAdministrations of their own; so in Politicks and Oconomicks the\r\nsame must be used; for\r\n\r\n  _Naturam expellas furcâ licet usque recurrit._\r\n\r\n18. Nevertheless, if the Hollanders advantages in making Cloth be\r\nbut small and few in comparison of ours, that is, if they have but\r\na little the better of us, then I conceive that Prohibitions to\r\nexport Wool may sufficiently turn the scales. But whether this be\r\nso or not, I leave to others, being my self neither Merchant nor\r\nStatesman.\r\n\r\n19. As for Prohibition of Importations, I say that it needs not be,\r\nuntil they much exceed our Exportations. For if we should think it\r\nhard to give good necessary Cloth for debauching Wines, yet if we\r\ncannot dispose of our Cloth to others, ’twere better to give it\r\nfor Wine or worse, then to cease making it; nay, better to burn a\r\nthousand mens labours for a time, then to let those thousand men by\r\nnon-employment lose their faculty of labouring. In brief, what may\r\nbe further said hereupon, resolves into the Doctrine and _Ingenium_\r\nof making sumptuary Laws, and judicious use of them _pro hic &\r\nnunc_.\r\n\r\n20. Unto this Discourse of Customs appertains that of Free Ports,\r\nwhich (in a Nation that onely trades for it self, _viz._ vents its\r\nown superfluities, and imports onely Necessaries for it self) are\r\nof no use, but rather harm; for suppose Wines be brought into a\r\nFree Port, be there housed and privately sold, but the Cask filled\r\nup with stained water, and put on ship-board again to be staved as\r\nsoon as the ship is out at sea: In this case, the Duties of those\r\nWines are defrauded, as it also may be many other wayes.\r\n\r\n21. Now if it be said, that although we should trade but for our\r\nselves, yet that our Ports (being more commodious then those of\r\nother Nations) would be the more frequented; for being free, and\r\nconsequently the more enriched, by the expence of Sea-men and\r\nPassengers, hire of Labourers, and Ware-houses, &c. even without\r\nany Custom at all upon the Goods. Nevertheless ’tis reason that a\r\nsmall duty should be paid upon the ship as aforesaid for such use\r\nof our Ports, and that _eo nomine_; not expecting all our Benefit\r\nfrom the said hire of Cellaridge, Porters, and Carmen, which also\r\nmight be had over and above for their proper reasons.\r\n\r\n22. But if we could attain to be the Merchants between other\r\nNations, there is then no reason for exacting Duties (as was said\r\nbefore) upon things _in fieri_, and which are but in the way of\r\ntheir improvement: And as for the fraud that may be committed, as\r\nin the case of Wines abovementioned, I affirm that our Excize upon\r\nthe Consumption, would overcome and elude them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\n_Of Poll-money._\r\n\r\n\r\nPoll-money is a Tax upon the Persons of men, either upon all simply\r\nand indifferently, or else according to some known Title or mark\r\nof distinction upon each; and that either of bare honour, or else\r\nof some Office sought or imposed, or of some Faculty and Calling\r\nwithout respect to Riches or Poverty, Incomes or Expence, Gain or\r\nLoss accrewing by the said Title, Office, or Faculty.\r\n\r\n2. The Poll-moneys which have been leavied of late have been\r\nwonderfully confused; as taxing some rich single persons at the\r\nlowest rate; some Knights, though wanting necessaries, at twenty\r\npounds, encouraging some vain fellows to pay as Esquires, on\r\npurpose to have themselves written Esquires in the Receipts; making\r\nsome pay ten pounds as Doctours of Physick or Law, who get nothing\r\nby the Faculty, nor minde the practice; making some poor Tradesmen\r\nforced to be of the Liveries of their Companies to pay beyond their\r\nstrength; and lastly, some to pay according to their Estates, the\r\nsame to be valued by those that know them not; thereby also giving\r\nopportunity to some Bankrupts to make the world credit them as men\r\nof such Estates, at which the Assessors did rate them by Collusion.\r\n\r\n3. So as by this Confusion, Arbitraries, Irregularities, and\r\nhotch-pot of Qualifications, no estimate could be made of the\r\nfitness of this Plaister to the Sore, nor no Checque or way to\r\nexamine whether the respective Receipts were duly accompted for, &c.\r\n\r\n4. Wherefore wholly rejecting the said complicated way of Tax, I\r\nshall speak of Poll-money more distinctly, and first of the simple\r\nPoll-money upon every head of all mankinde alike; the Parish paying\r\nfor those that receive alms, Parents for their Children under age,\r\nand Masters for their Apprentices, and others who receive no wages.\r\n\r\n5. The evil of this way is, that it is very unequal; men of unequal\r\nabilities, all paying alike, and those who have greatest charges\r\nof Children paying most; that is, that by how much the poorer they\r\nare, by so much the harder are they taxed.\r\n\r\n6. The Conveniencies are; first, that it may be suddenly collected,\r\nand with small charge: Secondly, that the number of the people\r\nbeing alwayes known, it may be sufficiently computed what the same\r\nwill amount unto. Thirdly, It seems to be a spur unto all men, to\r\nset their Children to some profitable employment upon their very\r\nfirst capacity, out of the proceed whereof, to pay each childe his\r\nown Poll-money.\r\n\r\n7. The next Poll-money is upon every head, but distinguished by\r\nTitles of meer Honour, without any kinde of Office or Faculty; as,\r\nDukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts, Barons, Baronets, Knights, and\r\nEsquires, _viz._ the eldest Sons of Knights _in perpetuum_, and\r\nGentlemen if they write themselves so. This way is much more equal\r\nthen the other; forasmuch as those who are Titled, are for the most\r\npart rich proportionably; or if they were not, yet men so dignified\r\nshall command a preheminence and place, even although they do not\r\nor cannot buy it of the vulgar by their Expence: my meaning hereby\r\nis, that a Title may possibly save a man as much as his Poll-money,\r\nmay exceed the Plebeian Level by reason of such title.\r\n\r\n8. Moreover, good and multiform Accompts being kept of the People,\r\nthis Tax may be also easily speedily and inexpensively collected;\r\nand also being capable of being computed aforehand, may be fitted\r\nand seized according to the needs of the Prince.\r\n\r\n9. As for Offices, they are indeed Dignities for the most part, but\r\npaid for by the trouble of administring them; as for example, to be\r\nan Alderman suppose of _London_, is indeed an honour, yet many pay\r\nfive hundred pounds to be excused from receiving it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it may not be improper to tax Offices sought; or such\r\nas are accepted although they might be refused: And on the other\r\nside no _Titulado_ should be forced to pay Poll-money according to\r\nhis Title, if he be contented to lay it down, and never resume it\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n10. The Titles of Faculties and Callings ought to be no\r\nQualification in a Poll-money, because they do not necessarily\r\nnor probably inferr ability to pay, but carry with them vaste\r\ninequalities. But therefore if a man by his Licence to practise\r\nget much, it may be presumed he will spend accordingly; in which\r\nnet the way of Excize will certainly take him, as it will all the\r\nOfficers aforementioned.\r\n\r\n11. Harth-money seems to be a Poll-money, but is not, being rather\r\na way of Accumulative Excize; of which hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\n_Of Lotteries._\r\n\r\n\r\nMen that accept Titles may foresee, that they may be taxed by them\r\nas aforesaid, (although it be unlikely (one House of Parliament\r\nbeing all Tituladoes, and the greatest part of the other being such\r\nalso) that any such way of Leavy should pass) and therefore they do\r\nas it were _à priori_ consent unto the Tax in their own Individuals.\r\n\r\n2. Now in the way of Lottery men do also tax themselves in the\r\ngeneral, though out of hopes of Advantage in particular: A Lottery\r\ntherefore is properly a Tax upon unfortunate self-conceited fools;\r\nmen that have good opinion of their own luckiness, or that have\r\nbelieved some Fortune-teller or Astrologer, who had promised them\r\ngreat success about the time and place of the Lottery, lying\r\nSouthwest perhaps from the place where the destiny was read.\r\n\r\n3. Now because the world abounds with this kinde of fools, it is\r\nnot fit that every man that will, may cheat every man that would be\r\ncheated; but it is rather ordained, that the Sovereign should have\r\nthe Guardianship of these fools, or that some Favourite should beg\r\nthe Sovereigns right of taking advantage of such mens folly, even\r\nas in the case of Lunaticks and Idiots.\r\n\r\n4. Wherefore a Lottery is not tollerated without authority,\r\nassigning the proportion in which the people shall pay for their\r\nerrours, and taking care that they be not so much and so often\r\ncouzened, as they themselves would be.\r\n\r\n5. This way of Lottery is used but for small Leavies, and rather\r\nupon privato-publick accompts, (then for maintaining Armies or\r\nEquipping Fleets,) such as are Aque-Ducts, Bridges, and perhaps\r\nHighwayes, &c. Wherefore we shall say no more of it upon this\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\n_Of Benevolence._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe raising of Money by Benevolence, seems to be no force upon\r\nany man, nor to take from any man but what himself knows he can\r\nspare, nevertheless there is more in it; for to be but brow-beaten\r\nby a Prince or Grandee, proves often as heavy as to be distrained\r\nupon for an Assessment or Subsidy; and the danger of being\r\nmisrepresented by linsy Pick-thanks and Informers as disaffected to\r\nthe Cause for which the Leavy is made, is more frequent then the\r\npayment of any summe in a due proportion with all other men (which\r\nI have said is no impoverishment) can possibly be hurtful.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of this way are these, _viz._ That forasmuch as it\r\nsometimes falls out (as in the late Differences with the Scots,\r\n_annis_ 1638. and 1639. when the Church Dignitaries were most\r\nconcerned) that the cause of the Expence concerns some men more\r\nthen others, that then an Imposition should not pass upon all for\r\nthe sakes of a part: Sometimes it happens, that one sort of men\r\nhave received greater and fresher favours then another; as upon\r\nthe late Restoration of his Majesty _Anno_ 1660. those who needed\r\nan Act of Indempnity did: And sometimes it is visible, that some\r\nmen have had better times of gain and advantages then others,\r\nas the Clergy most eminently have had since his Majesties said\r\nRestoration. In all these Cases, the proposal of a Benevolence may\r\nbe offered, although in no cases it be without its inconveniencies;\r\nthe which are principally these.\r\n\r\n1. The abovementioned Brow-beating and distaste given, if a man\r\nhave not contributed as largely as envious observers think he\r\nshould have done.\r\n\r\n2. A Benevolence in many cases may divide a whole Nation into\r\nparties, or at least make the strength of Parties too well known to\r\nsuch as need not know it: and withall it may (on the contrary and\r\nupon design) disguize the same, and elude the measures which the\r\nGovernours thought to have taken by such an exploratory artifice.\r\n\r\n3. Some men may have particular reasons to contribute large, _viz._\r\ncomplacency with, and hopes of being repaired by the favour of some\r\nGrandee, who favours the business, and the very same may make to\r\nthe prejudice of others.\r\n\r\n4. Men of sinking Estates, (who nevertheless love to live high, and\r\nappear splendid, and such who make themselves friends, (by their\r\nhospitality paid for, in effect by others) enough to be protected,\r\neven from Justice) do often upon this occasion of Benevolence set\r\nextravagant Examples unto others, who have laboured hardly for what\r\nthey have; those not caring what they pay, because it encreaseth\r\ntheir credit, to borrow the more, so as at length the whole burthen\r\nof such Bankrupts Benevolence, lights upon the frugal Patriots, by\r\nwhom the Publique Weal subsists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\n_Of Penalties._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe usual Penalties are Death, Mutilations, Imprisonment, Publick\r\ndisgrace, Corporal transient pains, and great Tortures, besides\r\nPecuniary Mulcts. On which last we shall most insist, speaking of\r\nthe others but in order to examine whether they may not be commuted\r\nfor these.\r\n\r\n2. There be some certain Crimes, for which the Law of God appoints\r\ndeath; and these must be punished with it, unless we say that those\r\nwere but the Civil Laws of the Jewish Commonwealth, although given\r\nby God himself; of which opinion certainly most modern States\r\nare, in as much as they punish not Adulteries, &c. with death, as\r\namong the Jewes, and yet punish small Thefts with Death instead of\r\nmultiple reparation.\r\n\r\n3. Upon this supposition we shall venture to offer; whether the\r\nreason of simple Death be not to punish incorrigible Committers of\r\ngreat faults?\r\n\r\n4. Of publick Death with Torments, to affright men from Treasons,\r\nwhich cause the deaths and miseries of many thousand innocent and\r\nuseful people?\r\n\r\n5. Of Death secretly executed, to punish secret and unknown Crimes,\r\nsuch as Publick Executions would teach to the World? Or else to\r\nsuffocate betimes some dangerous Novelties in Religion, which the\r\npatient suffering of the worst man would much spread and encourage.\r\n\r\n6. Mutilations suppose of Ears, Nose, &c. are used for perpetual\r\ndisgrace, as standing in the Pillory is for temporary and\r\ntransient; which and such other punishments have (by the way) made\r\nsome corrigible offenders, to become desperate and incurable.\r\n\r\n7. Mutilations of parts as of Fingers, are proper to disable such\r\nas have abused their dextrous use of them, by Pocket-picking,\r\nCounterfeiting of Seals and Writings, &c. Mutilations of other\r\nparts, may serve to punish and prevent Adulteries, Rapes, Incests,\r\n&c. And the smaller Corporal pains, serve to punish those, who can\r\npay no pecuniary mulcts.\r\n\r\n8. Imprisonment seems rather to be the punishments of suspected\r\nthen guilty persons, and such as by their carriage give the\r\nMagistrate occasion to think, either they have done some smaller\r\nparticular Crime, as Thefts, &c. or that they would commit greater,\r\nas Treasons and Seditions. But where Imprisonment is not a securing\r\nmen untill their Trialls, but a sentence after Triall, it seems\r\nto me proper onely to seclude such men from conversation, whose\r\nDiscourses are bewitching, and Practices infectious, and in whom\r\nneverthelesse remains some hopes of their future Amendments, or\r\nusefulnesse for some service not yet appearing.\r\n\r\n9. As for perpetual Imprisonment by sentence, it seems but the same\r\nwith death it self, to be executed by nature it self, quickened\r\nwith such Diseases, as close living, sadness, solitude, and\r\nreflections upon a past and better condition, doth commonly beget:\r\nNor do men sentenced hereunto live longer, though they be longer in\r\ndying.\r\n\r\n10. Here we are to remember in consequence of our opinion, [That\r\nLabour is the Father and active principle of Wealth, as Lands are\r\nthe Mother] that the State by killing, mutilating, or imprisoning\r\ntheir members, do withall punish themselves; wherefore such\r\npunishments ought (as much as possible) to be avoided and commuted\r\nfor pecuniary mulcts, which will encrease labour and publick wealth.\r\n\r\n11. Upon which account, why should not a man of Estate, found\r\nguilty of man-slaughter, rather pay a certain proportion of his\r\nwhole Estate, then be burnt in the hand?\r\n\r\n12. Why should not insolvent Thieves be rather punished with\r\nslavery then death? so as being slaves they may be forced to as\r\nmuch labour, and as cheap fare, as nature will endure, and thereby\r\nbecome as two men added to the Commonwealth, and not as one taken\r\naway from it; for if _England_ be under-peopled, (suppose by half)\r\nI say that next to the bringing in of as many more as now are, is\r\nthe making these that are, to do double the work which now they do;\r\nthat is, to make some slaves; but of this elsewhere.\r\n\r\n13. And why should not the solvent Thieves and Cheats be rather\r\npunished with multiple Restitutions then Death, Pillory, Whipping?\r\n&c. But it will be asked, with how manifold Restitutions should\r\npicking a pocket (for example) be punished? I say, ’twere good in\r\norder to the solution hereof, to enquire of some candid Artists\r\nin that Trade, how often they are taken one time with another\r\npractising in this work? If but once in ten times, then to restore\r\neven but seven-fold, would be a fair profit; and to restore but\r\nten-fold, were but an even lay; wherefore to restore twenty-fold,\r\nthat is, double to the hazard, is rather the true _ratio_ and\r\nmeasure of punishment by double reparation.\r\n\r\n14. And surely the restoring two, three, four, and seven-fold\r\nmentioned in _Moses_ Law must be thus understood, or else a man\r\nmight make thieving a very fair and lawful profession.\r\n\r\n15. The next question is, in such multiple Restitutions how many\r\nparts should be given to the sufferer. To which I answer, never\r\nabove one, and scarce that, to oblige him to more care, and\r\nself-preservation, with three parts to discoverers, and the rest to\r\npublick uses.\r\n\r\n16. Thirdly, In the case of Fornications, most of the punishments\r\nnot made by pecuniary mulcts and commuted, are but shame, and\r\nthat too but towards some few persons, which shame for ever after\r\nobdurates the Offender, what ever it work upon such whose fames\r\nare yet intire: Of all which men take little consideration,\r\nstanding upon the brink of such precipices as makes them giddy; and\r\nwhen they are in danger of such faults as are rather madnesses,\r\ndistempers, and alienations of the minde and reason, as also\r\ninsurrections of the passions, then deliberate acts of the\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n17. Moreover, according to that Axiom of _In quo quis peccat, in\r\neodem puniatur_; if the _Ratio formalis_ of the sin of _Concubitus\r\nVagi_, be the hindering of procreation, let those who by their\r\nmiscarriages of this kinde are guilty thereof, repair unto the\r\nState the misse of another pair of hands with the double labour of\r\ntheir own, or which is all one, by a pecuniary mulct; and this is\r\nthe practice of some wise States in punishing what they will never\r\nbe able to prevent: Nor doth the Gospel specifie any punishment in\r\nthis world, onely declaring they shall not be received into the\r\njoyes of the next.\r\n\r\n18. I could instance in more particulars, but if what I have\r\nalready said be reasonable, this little is enough; if not, then all\r\nthe rest would be too little also: wherefore I shall adde but one\r\ninstance more, as most suitable to our present times and occasions,\r\nwhich is the way of punishing Heterodox Professors of Religion.\r\n\r\n19. That the Magistrate may punish false Believers, if he believe\r\nhe shall offend God in forbearing it, is true; for the same\r\nreasons that men give for Liberty of Conscience, and universal\r\ntolleration; and on the other side, that he may permit false\r\nWorships, seems clearly at least by the practice of all States,\r\nwho allow Ambassadours their freedom (be their Worship never so\r\nabominable) even when they come to negociate but upon temporal and\r\nsmall matters.\r\n\r\n20. Wherefore, since the Magistrate may allow or connive at such\r\nWorships as himself thinks fit, and yet may also punish; and since\r\nby Death, Mutilations, and imprisonments of the Subjects, the\r\nState not onely punisheth it self, but spreadeth the Pseudodoxies;\r\nit follows, that pecuniary Mulcts are the fittest wayes of\r\nchecking the wantonness of men in this particular: forasmuch as\r\nthat course favours of no bitterness at all, but rather argues a\r\ndesire to indulge, provided such indulgence may consist with the\r\nindempnity of the State; for no Heterodox believer will desire to\r\nbe tollerated longer then he keeps the Publick Peace; the which if\r\nhe means to do, he cannot take it ill of the Magistrate, to keep\r\nhim steddy unto that his duty, nor grudge to contribute towards so\r\nmuch charge for that purpose as himself occasions.\r\n\r\n21. Moreover, as there seems a reason for indulging some\r\nconscientious misbelievers, so there is as much for being severe\r\ntowards Hypocrites, especially such as abuse holy Religion to cloak\r\nand vizzard worldly ends: Now what more easie and yet effectual\r\nway is there to discern between these two, then well proportioned\r\npecuniary mulcts? for who desiring to serve God without fear, and\r\nlabouring ten hours _per diem_ at his Calling, would not labour one\r\nhour more for such a freedom? even as religious men spend an hour\r\n_per diem_ more then the looser sort do at their Devotions; or who\r\nwearing Cloth of one and twenty shillings the yard, would not be\r\ncontented with that of twenty shillings, for the same advantage of\r\nhis liberty in Worship? Those that kick at this, being unwilling\r\neither to do or suffer for God, for whose sake they pretend so much.\r\n\r\n22. It may be here objected, that although some bad Religions might\r\nbe tollerated, yet that all may not, _viz._ such as consist not\r\nwith the Civil Peace. To which I answer,\r\n\r\nFirst; that there is no Schisme or Separation be it never so small,\r\nconsistent with that unity and peace as could be wisht; nor none so\r\nperfectly conscientious, but may also be civilly most pernicious:\r\nFor that _Venner_ and his Complices acted upon internal motives,\r\nthe most free exposing of themselves to death may evince; and yet\r\ntheir holding the King to be an Usurper upon the Throne and Right\r\nof Jesus Christ was a Civil mischief neither to be pardoned or\r\nparallel’d.\r\n\r\n23. And yet on the other hand there is no Pseudodoxy so great, but\r\nmay be muzzled from doing much harm in the State, without either\r\nDeath, Imprisonment, or Mutilation: To make short, no opinion\r\ncan be more dangerous, then to disbelieve the immortality of the\r\nSoul, as rendring man a beast, and without conscience, or fear of\r\ncommitting any evil, if he can but elude the penalties of humane\r\nLaws made against it, and letting men loose to all evil thoughts\r\nand designs whereof man can take no notice: Now I say, that even\r\nthis Misbeliever may be adæquately punished if he be kept as a\r\nbeast, be proprietor of nothing, as making no conscience how he\r\ngets; be never admitted in Evidence or Testimony, as under no\r\nObligation to speak truth; be excluded all Honours and Offices,\r\nas caring onely for himself, not the protecting of others; and be\r\nwithall kept to extream bodily labour, the profit whereof to the\r\nState is the pecuniary Mulct we speak of, though the greatest.\r\n\r\n24. As for opinions less horrible then this, the Mulct may be\r\nfitted to each of them respectively, according to the measure of\r\ndanger which the Magistrate apprehends from their allowance, and\r\nthe charge necessary to prevent it.\r\n\r\n25. And now we are speaking of the wayes how to prevent and\r\ncorrect Heterodoxies in Religion, which we have hitherto done\r\nby designing punishments for the erring sheep, I think it not\r\namiss to adde, That in all these cases the Shepherds themselves\r\nshould not wholly scape free: For if in this Nation there be such\r\nabundance of Free-Schools, and of liberall Maintenance provided in\r\nour Universities and elsewhere for instructing more then enough in\r\nall such learning as is fit to defend the established Religion,\r\ntogether with superabundant Libraries for that purpose. Moreover,\r\nif the Church-preferments be so numerous and ample both for Wealth,\r\nHonour, and Power, as scarce any where more; it seems strange that\r\nwhen by the laziness, formality, ignorance, and loose lives of our\r\nPastours, the sheep have gone astray, grown scabbed, or have been\r\ndevoured by Wolves and Foxes, that the Remedy of all this should\r\nbe onely sought by frighting those that have strayed from ever\r\nreturning again, and by tearing off as well the skins as the wool\r\nof those that are scabbed; whereas Almighty God will rather require\r\nthe blood even of them that have been devoured, from the shepheards\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n26. Wherefore if the Minister should lose part of the Tythes of\r\nthose whom he suffers to defect from the Church, (the defector not\r\nsaving, but the State wholly gaining them) and the defector paying\r\nsome pecuniary Mulct for his Schisme, and withall himself defraying\r\nthe charge of his new particular Church and Pastorage, me thinks\r\nthe burthen would be thus more equally born.\r\n\r\n27. Besides, the judicious world do not believe our Clergy can\r\ndeserve the vaste preferments they have, onely because they preach,\r\ngive a better accompt of Opinions concerning Religion then others,\r\nor can express their conceptions in the words of the Fathers, or\r\nthe Scriptures, &c. Whereas certainly the great honour we give\r\nthem, is for being patterns of holiness, for shewing by their own\r\nself-denials, mortifications, and austerities, that ’tis possible\r\nfor us to imitate them in the precepts of God; for if it were but\r\nfor their bare Pulpit-discourses, some men might think there is\r\nten thousand times as much already printed as can be necessary,\r\nand as good as any that ever hereafter may be expected. And it is\r\nmuch suspected, that the Discipline of the Cloisters hath kept up\r\nthe Roman Religion, which the Luxury of the Cardinals and Prelates\r\nmight have destroyed.\r\n\r\n28. The substance therefore of all we have said in this discourse\r\nconcerning the Church is, that it would make much for its peace,\r\nif the Nursery of Ministers be not too big, that Austerities in\r\nthe Priests lives would reconcile them to the people; and that it\r\nis not unreasonable, that when the whole Church suffers by the\r\ndefection of her Members, that the Pastours of it by bearing a\r\nsmall part should be made sensible of the loss; the manner and\r\nmeasures of all which I leave unto those unto whom it belongs.\r\n\r\n29. Concerning Penalties and Penal Laws I shall adde but this, that\r\nthe abuse of them is, when they are made not to keep men from sin,\r\nbut to draw them into punishment; and when the Executers of them\r\nkeep them hid until a fault be done, and then shew them terrible to\r\nthe poor immalicious offender: Just like Centinels, who never shew\r\nmen the advertisements against pissing near their Guards, till they\r\nhave catcht them by the coats for the forfeiture they claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XI.\r\n\r\n_Of Monopolies and Offices._\r\n\r\n\r\nMonopoly (as the word signifies) is the sole selling power, which\r\nwhosoever hath can vend the commodity whereupon he hath this power,\r\neither qualified as himself pleases, or at what price he pleaseth,\r\nor both, within the limits of his Commission.\r\n\r\n2. The great example of a Monopoly is the King of _France_ his\r\nGabel upon Salt, whereby he sells that for sixty which costs him\r\nbut one; now Salt being a thing of universal use to all degrees\r\nof men, and scarce more to the poor then the rich, it seems to be\r\nof the same effect with the simplest Poll-money abovementioned,\r\nin case all men spent equally of it, or if men be forced to take\r\nit whether they spend it or not, as in some places they are. But\r\nif men spend or eat Salt unequally, as they commonly do, nor are\r\nbound to take or pay for more then they spend, then it is no other\r\nthen an accumulative Excize, especially if the salt be all of one\r\nuniform goodness, otherwise it is a distinct species of Leavy,\r\n_viz._ a Monopoly.\r\n\r\n3. The use or pretence of instituting a Monopoly is,\r\n\r\nFirst, Right of Invention; forasmuch as the Laws do reward\r\nInventions, by granting them a Monopoly of them for a certain time;\r\n(as here in _England_ for fourteen years) for thereby the Inventor\r\nis rewarded more or less according to the acceptance which his\r\nInvention findes amongst men.\r\n\r\nWhere note by the way, that few new Inventions were ever rewarded\r\nby a Monopoly; for although the Inventor often-times drunk with\r\nthe opinion of his own merit, thinks all the world will invade\r\nand incroach upon him, yet I have observed, that the generality\r\nof men will scarce be hired to make use of new practices, which\r\nthemselves have not thoroughly tried, and which length of time\r\nhath not vindicated from latent inconveniences; so as when a new\r\nInvention is first propounded, in the beginning every man objects,\r\nand the poor Inventor runs the Gantloop of all petulent wits; every\r\nman finding his several flaw, no man approving it, unless mended\r\naccording to his own advice: Now not one of an hundred out-lives\r\nthis torture, and those that do, are at length so changed by the\r\nvarious contrivances of others, that not any one man can pretend to\r\nthe Invention of the whole, nor well agree about their respective\r\nshares in the parts. And moreover, this commonly is so long a\r\ndoing, that the poor Inventor is either dead, or disabled by the\r\ndebts contracted to pursue his design; and withall railed upon as a\r\nProjector, or worse, by those who joyned their money in partnership\r\nwith his wit; so as the said Inventor and his pretences are wholly\r\nlost and vanisht.\r\n\r\nSecondly, a Monopoly may be of real use for a time, _viz._ at the\r\nfirst introducing of a new Manufacture, wherein is much nicety\r\nto make it well, and which the generality of men cannot judge of\r\nas to the performance. As for example; suppose there were some\r\nmost approved Medicament which one certain man could make most\r\nexactly well, although several others could also make the same\r\nless perfectly: in this case this same chief Artist may be allowed\r\na Monopoly for a time, _viz._ until others have had experience\r\nenough under him, how to make the Medicament as well as himself.\r\nFirst, because the world may not have the Medicament variously\r\nmade, when as they can neither discern the difference by their\r\nsenses, nor judge of the effects thereof _à posteriori_, by their\r\nreasons. Secondly, because others may be fully instructed by him\r\nthat can best do it; and thirdly, because he may have a reward for\r\nsuch his communications: But forasmuch as by Monopolies of this\r\nkinde, great Leavies are seldom made, they are scarce pertinent to\r\nour design.\r\n\r\nOffices instituted by the State with Fees of their own appointment,\r\nare of parallel nature to Monopolies; the one relating to actions\r\nand employments as the other to things, and have the same to be\r\nsaid for and against them as Monopolies have.\r\n\r\nAs a Kingdom encreaseth and flourisheth, so doth variety of things,\r\nof actions, and even of words encrease also; for we see that the\r\nlanguage of the most flourishing Empires was ever the most copious\r\nand elegant, and that of mountainous Cantons the contrary: Now as\r\nthe actions of this Kingdom encreased, so did the Offices (that is,\r\nthe power and faculty of solely executing and performing the said\r\nactions) encrease likewise; and on the contrary, as the business of\r\nOffices encreased, so did the difficulty and danger of discharging\r\nthem amiss decrease proportionably: from whence ’tis come to pass,\r\nthat the Offices which at their first erecting were not performed\r\nbut by the ablest, most inventive, and versatile Instruments, (such\r\nas could wrestle with all emergent difficulties, and collect Rules\r\nand Axioms out of the Series of their own Observations, (with\r\nreference to the various casualties of their employments) whereby\r\nto direct Posterity) are now performed by the most ordinary,\r\nformal, pack-horse Deputies and Sub-Deputies.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas at first such large Fees were allowed as (considering\r\neven the paucity of them which might then be received) should\r\ncompensate the Art, Trust, and Industry of the Administratour; yet\r\nthe said large Fees are still continued, although the skill and\r\ntrust be lessened, and the number of the said Fees so extreamly\r\nmultiplyed: so as now the profits of such Offices (being become\r\ncleer, and the work so easie as any man is capable of it, even\r\nthose that never saw it,) are bought and sold for Years or Lives,\r\nas any other Annuity may be; and withal, the splendor arising from\r\nthe easie gaines of those places in Courts of Justice, is called\r\nthe Flourishing of the Law, which certainly flourisheth best, when\r\nthe Professors and Ministers of it have least to do. And moreover,\r\nwhen the burthen and uselesness of such an Office is taken notice\r\nof, ’tis nevertheless spared as a Subjects Freehold in favour of\r\nhim that bought it.\r\n\r\nOf these Offices are many in this Nation, and such as might be a\r\nRevenue to the King, either by their Annual profits, or the Sale of\r\nthem for many years together. And these are the Offices that are\r\nproperly Saleable, _viz._ where the Fees are large, as appointed\r\nwhen the number of them was few, and also numerous, as multiplying\r\nupon the increase of business, and where the business is onely the\r\nlabour of the meanest men: length of time having made all the work\r\nso easie, and found out security against all the frauds, breaches\r\nof trust, and male-administrations, whereunto the infancies of\r\nthose places were obnoxious.\r\n\r\nThese Offices are therefore Taxes upon such as can or will not\r\navoid the passing through them, and are born as men endure and\r\nrun themselves into the mischiefs of Duelling, the which are very\r\ngreat, which side soever prevails; for certainly men do not alwayes\r\ngo to Law to obtain right, or prevent wrong, which judicious\r\nneighbours might perform as well as a Jury of no abler men; and men\r\nmight tell the Judge himself the merits of their Cause, as well\r\nas now they instruct their Councel. This therefore of Offices is\r\na voluntary Tax upon contentious men, as Excize upon Drink is, to\r\ngood Fellows to love it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XII.\r\n\r\n_Of Tythes._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Word Tythes being the same with Tenths, signifie of it self\r\nno more then the proportion of the Excisum, or part retrenched,\r\nas if Customs upon imported and exported Commodities should be\r\ncalled by the name of Twentieths, as it is sometimes called Tunnage\r\nand Poundage; wherefore it remains to say, that Tythes in this\r\nplace, do together with the said proportion, consignifie the use\r\nof it, _viz._ the maintenance of the Clergy, as also the matter\r\nor substance out of which this Maintenance is cut, _viz._ the\r\nimmediate fruit of the Land and Waters, or the proceed of mens\r\nLabour, Art, and Stock laid out upon them. It signifies also the\r\nmanner of paying it, _viz._ in _specie_, and not (but upon special\r\nand voluntary causes) in money.\r\n\r\n2. We said the matter of Tythes, was the immediate Fruits of the\r\nEarth, _viz._ of Grain as soon as ’tis ready to be removed from\r\nthe ground that bare it; and not of Bread which is Corn thresht,\r\nwinnowed, ground, tempered with liquor and baked.\r\n\r\n3. ’Tis also the second choice out of the young of multiparous\r\nCattle taken in _specie_, so soon as the said Younglings can\r\nsubsist without their Dams, or else a Composition in Money for the\r\nUniparous.\r\n\r\n4. ’Tis Wool, so soon as it is shorn; ’tis Fowl and Fish, where\r\nFowling and Fishing is rather a Trade then a meer Recreation, &\r\n_sic de cæteris_.\r\n\r\n5. Moreover, in great Cities Tythes are a kinde of composition in\r\nMoney for the labour and profit of the Artisans who work upon the\r\nmaterials which have paid Tythes before.\r\n\r\n6. Tythes therefore encrease within any Territory, as the labour\r\nof that Countrey increases; and labour doth or ought to increase\r\nas the people do; now within four hundred years the people of\r\n_England_ are about quadrupled, as doubling every two hundred\r\nyears, and the proportion of the Rent of all the Lands in _England_\r\nis about the fourth part of the Expence of the people in it, so as\r\nthe other three parts is labour and stock.\r\n\r\n7. Wherefore the Tythes now should be twelve times as good as they\r\nwere four hundred years ago; which the rates of Benefices in the\r\nKings books do pretty well shew, by comparing of times; something\r\nof this should be abated because the proportion between the proceed\r\nof Lands and Labour do vary as the hands of Labourers vary:\r\nWherefore we shall rather say, that the Tythes are but six times as\r\ngood now as four hundred years ago, that is, that the Tythes now\r\nwould pay six times as many Labourers, or feed six times as many\r\nmouthes, as the Tythes four hundred years ago would have done.\r\n\r\n8. Now if there were not onely as many Parishes then as now, more\r\nPriests in every Parish, and also more Religious Men who were\r\nalso Priests, and the Religion of those times being more operose,\r\nand fuller of work then now, by reason of Confessions, Holydayes,\r\nOffices, &c. more in those dayes then now, (the great work in\r\nthese dayes being a compendious teaching above a thousand at once\r\nwithout much particular Confession and Catechising, or trouble\r\nabout the Dead), it seems clear, that the Clergy now is far richer\r\nthen heretofore; and that to be a Clergy-man then was a kinde\r\nof a Mortification, whereas now (praised be God) ’tis matter of\r\nsplendour and magnificence; unless any will say, that there were\r\ngolden Priests when the Chalices were wood, and but wooden Priests\r\nwhen the Chalices were gold; or that Religion best flourisheth when\r\nthe Priests are most mortified, as was before said of the Law,\r\nwhich best flourisheth when Lawyers have least to do.\r\n\r\n9. But what ever the increase of the Churches Goods are, I grudge\r\nit them not; onely wish, that they would take a course to enjoy\r\nit with safety and peace to themselves; whereof one is, not to\r\nbreed more Churchmen then the Benefices as they now stand shared\r\nout, will receive; that is to say, if there be places but for\r\nabout twelve thousand in _England_ and _Wales_, it will not be\r\nsafe to breed up 24000. Ministers, upon a view or conceipt that\r\nthe Church means otherwise distributed might suffice them all;\r\nfor then the twelve thousand which are unprovided for, will seek\r\nwayes how to get themselves a livelihood; which they cannot do more\r\neasily then by perswading the people, that the twelve thousand\r\nIncumbents do poison or starve their souls, and misguide them in\r\ntheir way to Heaven: Which needy men upon a strong temptation will\r\ndo effectually; we having observed, that Lecturers being such a\r\nsort of Supernumeraries, have preached more times in a week, more\r\nhours in the day, and with greater vehemence every time then the\r\nIncumbents could afford to do; for _Graculus esuriens in Cælum,\r\njusseris, ibit._ Now this vehemence, this pains, this zeal, and\r\nthis living upon particular donations, makes the people think, that\r\nthose who act them are withall more Orthodox, nay better assisted\r\nfrom God then the others. Now let any man judge, whether men\r\nreputed to be inspired will not get help to lift themselves into\r\nChurch-livings, &c. But these things are too plain from the latest\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\n10. Now you will ask, how shall that be done, or how may we know\r\nhow to adjust our Nursery to our Orchard? To which I answer,\r\nthat if there be twelve thousand Church-livings in _England_,\r\nDignitaries included, then that about four hundred being sent forth\r\n_per ann._ into the Vineyard, may keep it well served, without\r\nluxuriency; for according to the Mortality-Bill-observation, about\r\nthat number will dye yearly out of twelve thousand Adult-persons,\r\nsuch as Ministers are as to age, and ought to be as well as to\r\nspeculative knowledge, as practical experience, both of themselves\r\nand others.\r\n\r\n11. But I have digressed, my main scope being to explain the\r\nnature of the Tax of Tythes; nevertheless since the end of such\r\nexplanation is but to perswade men to bear quietly so much Tax as\r\nis necessary, and not to kick against the pricks; and since the end\r\nof that again, and the end of all else we are to do, is but to\r\npreserve the publick Peace, I think I have not been impertinent in\r\ninserting this little Advertisement, making so much for the Peace\r\nof our _Jerusalem_.\r\n\r\n12. But to return to Tythes as a Tax or Levy, I say that in\r\n_England_ it is none, whatsoever it might be or seem to be in\r\nthe first Age of its Institution; nor will the Kings Quit-rents\r\nin _Ireland_ as they are properly none now, seem any in the next\r\nAge, when every man will proportion his Expence to the remainder\r\nof his own Rent after the King is paid his; for ’tis surprize and\r\nthe suddenness of the Charge, which a Tax supervenient to a mans\r\nother expences and issues makes, that renders it a burthen, and\r\nthat intolerable to such as will not understand it, making men\r\neven to take up Arms to withstand it; that is, leap out of the\r\nFrying-pan upon earth into the fire even of hell, which is War and\r\nthe consequences thereof.\r\n\r\n13. Now Tythes being no Tax, I speak of it but as the _modus_ or\r\npattern of a Tax, affirming it to be next to one, the most equal\r\nand indifferent which can be appointed in order to defray the\r\npublick Charge of the whole Nation as well as that of the Church;\r\nfor hereby is collected a proportion of all the Corn, Cattle, Fish,\r\nFowl, Fruit, Wool, Honey, Wax, Oyl, Hemp, and Flax of the Nation,\r\nas a result of the Lands, Art, Labour, and Stock which produced\r\nthem; onely it is scarce regular in respect of Housing, Cloth,\r\nDrinks, Leather, Feathers, and the several Manufactures of them;\r\ninsomuch, as if the difference of Tythes which the Countrey payes\r\nin proportion to the City, were now _de novo_ to be established, I\r\ndo not see what in likelihood would sooner cause a grand sedition\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n14. The payment of an _aliquot_ part to the King out of the\r\nsame things as now pay Tythes, _in specie_, would have an\r\ninconvenience, because the Kings Rents would be like the Dividend\r\nin Colledges, _viz._ higher or lower according to the prices of\r\nthose Commodities, unless the said inequality in Colledges happen\r\nby reason of the fewness of particulars, according to the market\r\nrates whereof, their Rents are paid in money; whereas the whole\r\nof all the particulars might well enough ballance each other, a\r\ndear or plentiful year being but an appellation _secundum quid_,\r\n_viz._ with reference as to Corn onely, as the chief food of the\r\nmultitude; whereas ’tis likely, that the same causes which makes\r\nCorn scarce may make other things in plenty of no less use to the\r\nKing; as repairing in one thing what he wants in another.\r\n\r\n15. Another inconvenience would be that which was observed in\r\n_Ireland_, when the Ministery were paid by Sallary, and the Tythes\r\nin kinde paid to the State; who because they could not actually\r\nreceive them _in specie_, let them at farm to the most bidder;\r\nin the Transaction whereof was much juggling, combination, and\r\ncollusion, which perhaps might have been remedied, had not that\r\ncourse been used but as a sudden temporary shift, without intention\r\nof continuing it.\r\n\r\n16. The third inconvenience is, that abovementioned, _viz._ the\r\nnecessity of another way of Tax, to take in the Manufactures of\r\nthose Commodities which pay the Tax of Tythes; whereas possibly\r\nthere is a way of Tax equal in its own nature, and which needs\r\nnot to be pieced up by any other; so as the Officers about that\r\nmay have a full employment, and none others wanted, whose wide\r\nintervals of leasure shall make them seem Drones, as they are also\r\nthe Caterpillers of any State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIII.\r\n\r\n_Of several smaller wayes of levying Money._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the people are weary of any one sort of Tax, presently\r\nsome Projector propounds another, and gets himself audience, by\r\naffirming he can propound a way how all the publick charge may be\r\nborn without the way that is. As for example, if a Land-tax be the\r\npresent distasted way, and the people weary of it, then he offers\r\nto do the business without such a Land-tax, and propound either\r\na Poll-money, Excize, or the institution of some new Office or\r\nMonopoly, and hereby draws some or other to hearken to him; which\r\nis readily enough done by those who are not in the places of profit\r\nrelating to the way of Levies in use, but hope to make themselves\r\nOffices in the new Institution.\r\n\r\n2. I shall enumerate a few of the smaller wayes which I have\r\nobserved in several places of _Europe_, _viz._\r\n\r\nFirst, in some places the State is common Cashier for all or most\r\nmoneys, as where Banks are, thereby gaining the interest of as much\r\nmoney as is deposited in their hands.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Sometimes the State is the common Usurer, as where\r\nLoan Banks, and _montes pietatis_ are in use, and might be more\r\ncopiously and effectually where Registers of Lands are kept.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Sometimes the State is or may be Common Ensurer, either\r\nupon the danger onely of Enemies at sea, according to the supposed\r\nprimitive end of our Customs in _England_, or else of the\r\ncasualties of the Enemy, Weather, Sea, and Vessel taken together.\r\n\r\nFourthly, Sometimes the State hath the whole sale and benefit of\r\ncertain Commodities, as of Amber in the Duke of _Brandenburghs_\r\nCountrey, Tobacco formerly in _Ireland_, Salt in _France_, &c.\r\n\r\nFifthly, Sometimes the State is common Beggar, as ’tis almost in\r\n_Holland_, where particular Charity seems only to serve for the\r\nrelief of concealed wants, and to save these wanting from the shame\r\nof discovering their poverty, and not so much to relieve any wants\r\nthat are declared, and already publickly known.\r\n\r\nSixthly, In some places the State is the sole Guardian of Minors,\r\nLunaticks, and Idiots.\r\n\r\nSeventhly, In some other Countreys the State sets up and maintains\r\nPlay-houses, and publick Entertainments, giving Sallaries to the\r\nActors, but receiving the bulk of the profit to themselves.\r\n\r\nEighthly, In some places, Houses are ensured from fire by the State\r\nat a small Rent _per annum_ upon each.\r\n\r\nNinthly, In some places Tolls are taken upon passage over Bridges,\r\nCauseys, and Ferries built and maintained at the Publick Charge.\r\n\r\nTenthly, In some places men that dye are obliged to leave a certain\r\npittance to the publick, the same is practised in other places upon\r\nMarriages, and may be in others upon Births.\r\n\r\nEleventhly, In some places strangers especially Jews, are\r\nparticularly taxed; which may be good in over-peopled Countreys,\r\nthough bad in the contrary case.\r\n\r\n3. As for Jews, they may well bear somewhat extraordinary, because\r\nthey seldom eat and drink with Christians, hold it no disparagement\r\nto live frugally, and even sordidly among themselves, by which way\r\nalone they become able to under-sell any other Traders, to elude\r\nthe Excize, which bears but according to mens Expences; as also\r\nother Duties, by dealing so much in Bills of Exchange, Jewels, and\r\nMoney, and by practising of several frauds with more impunity then\r\nothers; for by their being at home every where, and yet no where\r\nthey become responsible almost for nothing.\r\n\r\n4. Twelfthly, There have been in our times, wayes of levying\r\nan _aliquot_ part of mens Estates, as a Fifth, and Twentieth,\r\n_viz._ of their Estates real and personal, yea of their Offices,\r\nFaculties, and imaginary Estates also, in and about which way\r\nmay be so much fraud, collusion, oppression, and trouble, some\r\npurposely getting themselves taxed to gain more trust: Others\r\nbribing to be taxed low, and it being impossible to check or\r\nexamine, or trace these Collections by the print of any footsteps\r\nthey leave, (such as the Harths of Chimneys are) that I have not\r\npatience to speak more against it; daring rather conclude without\r\nmore ado, in the words of our Comick to be naught, yea exceeding\r\nnaught, very abominable, and not good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIV.\r\n\r\n_Of raising, depressing, or embasing of Money._\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes it hath happened, that States (I know not by what raw\r\nadvice) have raised or embased their money, hoping thereby, as it\r\nwere, to multiply it, and make it pass for more then it did before;\r\nthat is, to purchase more commodity or labour with it: All which\r\nindeed and in truth, amounts to no more then a Tax, upon such\r\nPeople unto whom the State is indebted, or a defalkation of what\r\nis due; as also the like burthen upon all that live upon Pensions,\r\nestablished Rents, Annuities, Fees, Gratuities, &c.\r\n\r\n2. To explain this fully, one might lanch out into the deep Ocean\r\nof all the Mysteries concerning Money, which is done for other ends\r\nelsewhere; nevertheless I shall do it the best I can, by expounding\r\nthe reasons _pro & contrà_ for embasing and raising of Money: and\r\nfirst of embasing.\r\n\r\n3. Copper or Tin Money made _ad valorem_ in its matter, is no\r\nembasing; the same being onely cumbersom and baser then silver\r\nmoney, onely because less convenient and portable.\r\n\r\nAnd Copper money _ad valorem_ in workmanship and matter both\r\ntogether; (such as on which the Effigies and Scutcheon are so\r\ncuriously graven and impressed, as the moneys seem rather Medalls)\r\nis not embasing, unless the numbers of such pieces be excessive,\r\n(the measures whereof I shall not set down, until I shall hereafter\r\npropound the fittest Sections of the abstracted pound into which\r\nI would have money coyned, and determine how many pieces of each\r\nSection should be in an hundred pound) for in case of such excess,\r\nthe workmanship being of no other use but to look upon, becomes\r\nbase by its being too common.\r\n\r\n4. Nor are such Tokens base as are coyned for Exchange in retailing\r\nby particular men, (if such men be responsible and able to take\r\nthem back, and give Silver for them.)\r\n\r\n5. But that Gold I count to be embased, which hath more allay\r\neither of Copper or Silver in it, then serves to correct its too\r\ngreat natural softness and flexibility, whereby it wears too\r\nfast in Money: And that Silver I reckon also embased, wherein is\r\ncommixed more Copper then will sufficiently toughen it, and save it\r\nfrom cracking under the Hammer, Press, or Mill that must coin it,\r\nor the like.\r\n\r\n6. Base Money is therefore such as Dutch Shillings, Stivers, French\r\nSoulz, Irish Bon-galls, &c. and for the most part consisting of\r\ngreat pieces, though of small value. To answer the first reason or\r\npretence of making them, which is, that the said Pieces might be\r\nmore bulky, handleable, and the silver in them less apt to be lost\r\nor worn away.\r\n\r\n7. The other reason (besides that of allay which we must allow in\r\nthe Measures abovementioned) is to save it from being melted down\r\nby Goldsmiths and Bullioners, or exported by strangers; neither of\r\nwhich can happen but to their loss: for suppose a Stiver of two\r\npence, had a penny of pure silver, if the Bullioner melts it for\r\nthe sake of the silver onely, in the separation he shall lose the\r\nCopper and charge of refining the Silver; nor will strangers export\r\nit into places where the local value of the Piece perisheth, the\r\nintrinsick leaving him to loss.\r\n\r\n7. Now the reasons against this kinde of Money are, first the\r\ngreater danger of falsification, because the colour, sound, and\r\nweight by which men (without the test) guess at the goodness of\r\nthe material of Money is too much confounded, for the vulgar (whom\r\nit concerns) to make use of them for their marks and guides in the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n8. Secondly, In case small pieces of this Money, _viz._ pieces of\r\ntwo pence should happen to be raised or depressed twelve, fifteen,\r\nor sixteen _per cent._ then there will be a certain loss by reason\r\nof the fractions, which the vulgar cannot reckon: As for example,\r\nif such Money were depressed but ten, eleven, or twelve _per cent._\r\nthen the two pence piece would be worth but three half pence, which\r\nis twenty five _per cent._ and so of other proportions.\r\n\r\n9. Thirdly, In case the Inconvenience of this Money should be so\r\ngreat as to necessitate a new Coinage of it, then will happen all\r\nthe losses we mentioned before in melting it down by Bullioners.\r\n\r\n10. Fourthly, If the two pence piece contained but 1./5.^{th.}\r\npart of the Silver usually in a shilling, then Dealers would have\r\nfifteen pence paid in this money for the same Commodity, for which\r\nthey would take a shilling in Standard Silver.\r\n\r\n11. Raising of Money is either the cutting the pound _Troy_ of\r\nStandard Silver into more pieces then formerly, as into above\r\nsixty, whereas heretofore the same was made but into twenty, and\r\nyet both sorts called shillings, or else calling the money already\r\nmade by higher names: The reasons or pretences given for such\r\nraising are these, _viz._ That the raising of Money will bring it\r\nin, and the material thereof more plentifully; for trial whereof\r\nsuppose one shilling were proclaimed to be worth two, what other\r\neffect could this have, then the raising of all Commodities unto\r\na double price? Now if it were proclaimed, That Labourers Wages,\r\n&c. should not rise at all upon this raising of Money, then would\r\nthis Act be as onely a Tax upon the said Labourers, as forcing\r\nthem to lose half their wages, which would not be onely unjust but\r\nimpossible, unless they could live with the said half, (which is\r\nnot to be supposed) for then the Law that appoints such Wages were\r\nill made, which should allow the Labourer but just wherewithall to\r\nlive; for if you allow double, then he works but half so much as\r\nhe could have done, and otherwise would; which is a loss to the\r\nPublick of the fruit of so much labour.\r\n\r\n12. But suppose the _Quart d’ Ecus_ of _France_ commonly esteemed\r\nworth eighteen pence were raised to three shillings, then ’tis\r\ntrue, that all the Moneys of _England_ would be indeed _Quart d’\r\nEcus_ pieces; but as true, that all the English Money would be\r\ncarried away, and that our _Quart d’ Ecus_ would contain but half\r\nso much Bullion as our own money did; so that raising of Money may\r\nindeed change the _species_, but with so much loss as the Forreign\r\nPieces were raised unto, above their intrinsick value.\r\n\r\n13. But for remedy of this, suppose we raised the _Quart d’ Ecus_\r\ndouble, and prohibited the Exportation of our own money in Exchange\r\nthereof. I answer, that such a Prohibition is nugatory, and\r\nimpossible to be executed; and if it were not, yet the raising of\r\nthe said _species_ would but make us sell the Commodities bought\r\nwith raised _Quart d’ Ecus_, in effect but at half the usual rate,\r\nwhich unto them that want such commodities will as well yield the\r\nfull; so that abating our prices, will as well allure strangers to\r\nbuy extraordinary proportions of our Commodities, as raising their\r\nmoney will do: But neither that, nor abating the price will make\r\nstrangers use more of our Commodities then they want; for although\r\nthe first year they should carry away an unuseful and superfluous\r\nproportion, yet afterwards they would take so much the less.\r\n\r\n14. If this be true, as in substance it is, why then have so many\r\nwise States in several ancient, as well as modern times frequently\r\npractised this Artifice, as a means to draw in money into their\r\nrespective Dominions?\r\n\r\nI answer, that something is to be attributed to the stupidity\r\nand ignorance of the people, who cannot of a sudden understand\r\nthis matter: for I finde many men wise enough, who though they be\r\nwell informed that raising of money signifies little, yet cannot\r\nsuddenly digest it. As for example, an unengaged person who had\r\nmoney in his purse in _England_, and should hear that a shilling\r\nwas made fourteen pence in _Ireland_, would more readily run\r\nthither to buy Land then before; not suddenly apprehending, that\r\nfor the same Land which he might have bought before for six years\r\nPurchase, he shall now pay seven. Nor will Sellers in _Ireland_\r\nof a sudden apprehend cause to raise their Land proportionally,\r\nbut will at least be contented to compound the business, _viz._ to\r\nsell at six and an half; and if the difference be a more ragged\r\nfraction, men under a long time will not apprehend it, nor ever be\r\nable exactly to govern their practice according to it.\r\n\r\n15. Secondly, Although I apprehend little real difference between\r\nraising Forreign Money to double, and abating half in the price of\r\nour own Commodities, yet to sell them on a tacite condition to be\r\npaid in Forreign present Money, shall increase our money; forasmuch\r\nas between raising the money, and abasing the price, is the same\r\ndifference as between selling for money and in barter, which latter\r\nis the dearer; or between selling for present money, and for time;\r\nbarter resolving into the nature of uncertain time.\r\n\r\n16. I say, suppose English Cloth were sold at six shillings a Yard,\r\nand French Canvas at eighteen pence the Ell, the question is,\r\nwhether it were all one in order to increase Money in _England_ to\r\nraise the French Money double, or to abate half of the price of\r\nour Cloth? I think the former better, because that former way or\r\nproposition carries with it a condition of having Forreign Money\r\nin _specie_, and not Canvas in barter, between which two wayes\r\nthe world generally agrees there is a difference. Wherefore if we\r\ncan afford to abate half our price, but will not do it but for\r\nour neighbours money, then we gain so much as the said difference\r\nbetween Money and Barter amounts unto, by such raising of our\r\nNeighbours Money.\r\n\r\n17. But the fundamental solution of this Question depends\r\nupon a real and not an imaginary way of computing the prices\r\nof Commodities; in order to which real way I premise these\r\nsuppositions: First then, suppose there be in a Territory a\r\nthousand people, let these people be supposed sufficient to Till\r\nthis whole Territory as to the Husbandry of Corn, which we will\r\nsuppose to contain all necessaries for life, as in the Lords Prayer\r\nwe suppose the word Bread doth; and let the production of a Bushel\r\nof this Corn be supposed of equal labour to that of producing an\r\nounce of Silver. Suppose again that a tenth part of this Land, and\r\ntenth of the people, viz. an hundred of them, can produce Corn\r\nenough for the whole; suppose that the Rent of Land (found out as\r\nabovementioned) be a fourth part of the whole product, (about which\r\nproportion it really is, as we may perceive by paying a fourth\r\nSheaf instead of Rent in some places) suppose also that whereas but\r\nan hundred are necessary for this Husbandry, yet that two hundred\r\nhave taken up the Trade; and suppose that where a Bushel of Corn\r\nwould suffice, yet men out of delicacy will use two, making use of\r\nthe Flower onely of both. Now the Inferences from hence are;\r\n\r\nFirst, That the goodness or badness, or the value of Land depends\r\nupon the greater or lesser share of the product given for it in\r\nproportion to the simple labour bestowed to raise the said Product.\r\n\r\nSecondly, That the proportions between Corn and Silver signifie\r\nonely an artificial value, not a natural; because the comparison\r\nis between a thing naturally useful, and a thing in it self\r\nunnecessary, which (by the way) is part of the reason why there are\r\nnot so great changes and leaps in the prices of Silver as of other\r\nCommodities.\r\n\r\nThirdly, That natural dearness and cheapness depends upon the\r\nfew or more hands requisite to necessaries of Nature: As Corn is\r\ncheaper where one man produces Corn for ten, then where he can\r\ndo the like but for six; and withall, according as the Climate\r\ndisposes men to a necessity of spending more or less. But Political\r\nCheapness depends upon the paucity of Supernumerary Interlopers\r\ninto any Trade over and above all that are necessary, _viz._ Corn\r\nwill be twice as dear where are two hundred Husbandmen to do the\r\nsame work which an hundred could perform: the proportion thereof\r\nbeing compounded with the proportion of superfluous Expence,\r\n(_viz._ if to the cause of dearness abovementioned be added to the\r\ndouble Expence to what is necessary) then the natural price will\r\nappear quadrupled; and this quadruple Price is the true Political\r\nPrice computed upon naturall grounds.\r\n\r\nAnd this again proportioned to the common artificiall Standard\r\nSilver gives what was sought; that is, the true Price Currant.\r\n\r\n18. But forasmuch as almost all Commodities have their Substitutes\r\nor Succedanea, and that almost all uses may be answered several\r\nwayes; and for that novelty, surprize, example of Superiours, and\r\nopinion of unexaminable effects do adde or take away from the price\r\nof things, we must adde these contingent Causes to the permanent\r\nCauses abovementioned, in the judicious foresight and computation\r\nwhereof lies the excellency of a Merchant.\r\n\r\nNow to apply this Digression, I say, that to encrease Money, it\r\nis as well necessary to know how to abate as raise, the price of\r\nCommodities, and that of Money, which was the scope of the said\r\nDigression.\r\n\r\n19. To conclude this whole Chapter, we say, that raising or\r\nembasing of Moneys is a very pittiful and unequal way of Taxing the\r\npeople; and ’tis a sign that the State sinketh, which catcheth hold\r\non such Weeds as are accompanied with the dishonour of impressing a\r\nPrinces Effigies to justifie Adulterate Commodities, and the breach\r\nof Publick Faith, such as is the calling a thing what it really is\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XV.\r\n\r\n_Of Excize._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is generally allowed by all, that men should contribute to the\r\nPublick Charge but according to the share and interest they have in\r\nthe Publick Peace; that is, according to their Estates or Riches:\r\nnow there are two sorts of Riches, one actual, and the other\r\npotential. A man is actually and truly rich according to what he\r\neateth, drinketh, weareth, or any other way really and actually\r\nenjoyeth; others are but potentially or imaginatively rich, who\r\nthough they have power overmuch, make little use of it; these being\r\nrather Stewards and Exchangers for the other sort, then owners for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n2. Concluding therefore that every man ought to contribute\r\naccording to what he taketh to himself, and actually enjoyeth. The\r\nfirst thing to be done is, to compute what the Total of the Expence\r\nof this Nation is by particular men upon themselves, and then what\r\npart thereof is necessary for the Publick; both which (no not the\r\nformer) are so difficult as most men imagine.\r\n\r\n3. In the next place we must conceive, that the very perfect Idea\r\nof making a Leavy upon Consumptions, is to rate every particular\r\nNecessary, just when it is ripe for Consumption; that is to say,\r\nnot to rate Corn until it be Bread, nor Wool until it be Cloth,\r\nor rather until it be a very Garment; so as the value of Wool,\r\nCloathing, and Tayloring, even to the Thread and Needles might be\r\ncomprehended; But this being perhaps too laborious to be performed,\r\nwe ought to enumerate a Catalogue of Commodities both native and\r\nartificial, such whereof accompts may be most easily taken, and can\r\nbear the Office marks either on themselves, or on what contains\r\nthem; being withall such, as are to be as near Consumption as\r\npossible: And then we are to compute what further labour or charge\r\nis to be bestowed on each of them, before consumption, that so\r\nan allowance be given accordingly. As for example, suppose there\r\nbe an hundred pounds worth of Stript Stuff for Hangings, and an\r\nhundred pounds worth of Cloth or Stuff for the best mens Cloathes;\r\nI conceive, that the Cloth should bear a greater Excize then the\r\nsaid stript stuff, the one wanting nothing but tacking up, to be\r\nat its wayes end; and the other Tayloring, Thread, Silk, Needles,\r\nThimbles, Buttons, and several other particulars: The Excise of\r\nall which must be accumulated upon the Excize of the Cloth, unless\r\nthey be so great (as perhaps Buttons, Lace, or Ribbons may be) to\r\nbe taxed apart, and inserted into the Catalogue abovementioned.\r\n\r\n4. Now the things to be accumulated upon Cloth are, as near as\r\npossible, to be such particulars as are used onely to Cloth, or\r\nvery rarely to any other particular, as the several sorts of\r\npeculiar trimmings; so on Corn should be accumulated the charge\r\nof grinding, bolting, yeast, &c. for the baking of it into Bread,\r\nunless, as was said before, any of these particulars can be better\r\nrated apart.\r\n\r\n5. A Question ariseth hence, whether any Native Commodities\r\nexported ought to pay the Excize, or that what is imported in lieu\r\nof it should pay none? I answer no, because they are not spent here\r\n_in specie_; but I conceive that the Goods returned from abroad for\r\nthem and spent here should pay, if the exported have not already,\r\nfor so shall what we spend pay once, but not oftner. Now if Bullion\r\nbe returned, then if it be coyned into Money it ought not to pay,\r\nbecause Money will beget other commodities which shall pay; but if\r\nthe said Bullion be wrought into Plate and Utensils, or disgrost\r\ninto Wire or Lace, or beaten into Fueilles, then it also ought to\r\npay, because it is consumed and absolutely spent, as in Lace and\r\nGilding is too notorious; and this is the reason why I think the\r\nLeavy we commonly call Customs to be unseasonable and preposterous,\r\nthe same being a payment before consumption.\r\n\r\n6. We have several times spoken of Accumulative Excize, by which we\r\nmean Taxing many things together as one: As for example, suppose\r\nthe many Drugs used in Treacle or Mithridate were used onely in\r\nthose Compositions, in such case by taxing any one of them, the\r\nwhole number will be taxed as certainly as that one, because\r\nthey all bear a certain proportion one to another: In Cloth, the\r\nWorkmanship and Tools as well as the Wool may be well enough taxed,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n7. But some have strained this Accumulation so, as they would have\r\nall things together taxed upon some one single particular, such as\r\nthey think to be nearest the Common Standard of all Expence, the\r\nprincipal ends of their proposition being these, _viz._\r\n\r\nFirst, To disguise the name of Excize, as odious to them, that do\r\nneither know the payment of Taxes to be as indispensable as eating,\r\nand as have not considered the natural justice of this way of\r\nExcizing or proportionating.\r\n\r\nSecondly, To avoid the trouble and charge of Collecting.\r\n\r\nThirdly, To bring the business _ad firmum_, and to a certainty of\r\nall which we shall speak hereafter, when we examine the several\r\nreasons for and against the way of Excize, proceeding now to the\r\nseveral _species_ of Accumulative Excizes propounded in the world.\r\n\r\n8. Some propound Beer to be the only Excizable Commodity, supposing\r\nthat in the proportion that men drink, they make all other\r\nExpences; which certainly will not hold, especially if Strong Beer\r\npay quintuple unto, (as now) or any more Excize then the small:\r\nFor poor Carpenters, Smiths, Feltmakers, &c. drinking twice as\r\nmuch Strong Beer as Gentlemen do of Small, must consequently pay\r\nten times as much Excize. Moreover, upon the Artizans Beer is\r\naccumulated, onely a little Bread and Cheese, leathern Clothes,\r\nNeck-Beef, and Inwards twice a week, stale Fish, old Pease without\r\nButter, &c. Whereas on the other, beside Drink, is accumulated as\r\nmany more things as Nature and Art can produce; besides this way\r\nof Excizing, though it be never so well administred, is neither\r\nso equal nor so easie, nor so examinable as the simple Poll-money\r\nbefore spoken of, which is also but an Accumulative Excize.\r\n\r\n9. What hath been propounded for Beer may be of Salt, Fuel,\r\nBread, &c. and the Propositions would all labour under the\r\nsame Inconveniences; for some spend more, some less of these\r\nCommodities; and sometimes Families (each whereof are propounded\r\nto be farmed, without descending to individual heads) are more\r\nnumerous at sometimes then at others, according as their Estates or\r\nother Interests shall wax or wane.\r\n\r\n10. Of all the Accumulative Excizes, that of Harth-money or\r\nSmoak-money seems the best; and that onely because the easiest,\r\nand clearest, and fittest to ground a certain Revenue upon; it\r\nbeing easie to tell the number of Harths, which remove not as\r\nHeads or Polls do: Moreover, ’tis more easie to pay a small Tax,\r\nthen to alter or abrogate Harths, even though they are useless\r\nand supernumerary; nor is it possible to cover them, because most\r\nof the neighbours know them; nor in new Building will any man who\r\ngives forty shillings for making a Chimney be without it for two.\r\n\r\n11. Here is to be noted, that a Harth-money must be but small, or\r\nelse ’twill be intolerable; it being more easie for a Gentleman of\r\na thousand pound _per annum_ to pay for an hundred Chimneys (few of\r\ntheir Mansion-Houses having more) then for Labourers to pay for\r\ntwo. Moreover, if the Land-Lord onely pay this Tax, then is it not\r\nan Accumulative Excize for all, but a particular Excize upon but\r\none onely Commodity, namely Housing.\r\n\r\n12. Now the Reasons for Excize are these, _viz._\r\n\r\nFirst, The Natural Justice that every man should pay according to\r\nwhat he actually enjoyeth; upon which account this Tax is scarce\r\nforced upon any, and is very light to those, who please to be\r\ncontent with natural Necessaries.\r\n\r\nSecondly, This Tax if it be not farmed, but regularly collected,\r\nengages to thrift, the onely way to enrich a Nation, as by the\r\nDutch and Jews, and by all other men, who have come to vaste\r\nEstates by Trade, doth appear.\r\n\r\nThirdly, No man payes double or twice for the same thing, forasmuch\r\nas nothing can be spent but once; whereas it is frequently seen,\r\nthat otherwise men pay both by the Rent of their Lands, by their\r\nSmoaks, by their Titles, and by Customs, (which all men do, though\r\nMerchants chiefly talk of it) they also pay by Benevolence and by\r\nTythes; whereas in this way of Excize no man need pay but one way,\r\nnor but once, properly speaking.\r\n\r\nFifthly, By this way an excellent account may be taken of the\r\nWealth, Growth, Trade, and strength of the Nation at all times.\r\nAll which Reasons do make not for particular compoundings with\r\nFamilies, nor for letting the whole to farm, but for collecting it\r\nby special Officers, who having a full employment, will not be a\r\nfourth of the charge of our present many multiform Levies; for to\r\nput extraordinary trouble and hazzard upon the Countrey Officers,\r\nis a sorer Taxing of them, then to make them pay a small Reward\r\nunto practised Persons to be their Substitutes. All which are the\r\ncommon Objections against Excize.\r\n\r\n13. I should here adde the manner of Collecting it, but I refer\r\nthis to the practice of _Holland_; and I might also offer how men\r\nmay be framed to be fit for this and other Publick Trusts, as to be\r\nCashiers, Store-keepers, Collectors, &c. but I refer this Enquiry\r\nunto a more ample and fit occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (decorative header)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nErrata.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pag.  line.\r\n  1      14    between [_who_ and _spent_] interline [_have_]\r\n  5      13    after [_want_] read [_general_] instead of [_more_]\r\n  6      19    before [_starve_] interline [_needlesly_]\r\n  6      29    before [_cause_] read [_one_] instead of [_the_]\r\n  6      30    read [_is_] instead of [_are_]\r\n  8      7     read [_them_] for [_him_]\r\n  8      8     read [_their_] for [_his_]\r\n  17     19    read [_viz._] for [_that is_]\r\n  18     3     read [τἁ χρἠϛα] instead of [τἁ χρἠσα]\r\n  20     17    read [_Excisum_] not [_Excisium_]\r\n  21     7     read [_obligees_] not [_obliges_]\r\n  22     12    read [_enhansing_] not [_exhausting_]\r\n  22     23    between [_way_ and _Land-Tax_] interline [_of a_]\r\n  22     25    deleatur [_sometimes_]\r\n  24     25    between [_Rents_ and _we_] interline [_in order to Taxes_]\r\n  28     24    between [_seldom_ and _enough_] interline [_rich_]\r\n  28     28    deleatur [_with_]\r\n  30     11    after [_hazards_] interline [_and_]\r\n         14    read [_omitted_]\r\n         27    read [_apparatus_] instead of [_appurtenances_]\r\n  32     10    after [_the_] interline [_former_]\r\n         11    after [_Land_] read [_this latter_] instead [_of the_]\r\n  33     26    deleatur [_by_]\r\n         31    between [_&c._ and _then_] interline [_could be\r\n                   fertilized_]\r\n  34     36    read [_worth_] not [_work_]\r\n  36     16    after [_market_] interline [_abroad_]\r\n  37     12    read [_paribus_] not [_talibus_]\r\n  39     6     read [_conniving_] not [_coyning_]\r\n  39     32    deleatur [_as much harm_]\r\n        ibid.  between [_of_ and _one_] interline [_the_]\r\n       penult. after [_Coffee_] inter [_and_]\r\n  40     2     read [_meerly_] for [_merrily_]\r\n        ult.   before [_certainly_] interline [_case_]\r\n  41     13    dele [_out_]\r\n         24    read [_so or not_] instead of [_use_]\r\n  47     26    read [_on_] for [_of_]\r\n  51     3     read [_their_] for [_the_]\r\n         15    after [_Heterodox_] interline [_Believer_]\r\n         29    read [_wearing_] for [_weaving_]\r\n  53     14    read [_defect_] for [_dissent_]\r\n  54     36    between [_then_ and _is_] interline [_it_]\r\n  56    ult.   after [_yet the_] interline [_said_]\r\n  57     3     read [_offices_] for [_officers_]\r\n  60     2     read [_shared_] for [_shred_]\r\n  61     15    read [_consequences_] for [_calamities_]\r\n         32    read [_an_] for [_no_]\r\n  62     1     after [_plentiful_] interline [_year_]\r\n  65     21    read [_medalls_] instead of [_a medall_]\r\n  66     10    between [_consisting_ and _great_] interline [_of_]\r\n  67     29    read [_d’ Ecus_] instead of [_d’ Esens_]\r\n  68     36    read [_abating_] for [_abasing_]\r\n  69     11    after [_former_] interline [_better_]\r\n  70     12    read [_prices_] for [_proceed_]\r\n  71     5     read [_as_] for [_the_]\r\n  75     25    read [_families_] for [_faculties_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_FINIS._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE\r\n\r\n  All changes listed above in the Errata have been applied to the\r\n  etext.\r\n    --the change listed for page 18 line 3, changing “τἁ χρἠσα”\r\n      to “τἁ χρἠϛα”, has also been applied to the three other\r\n      occurrences in the text.\r\n    --the change listed for page 20 line 17, changing “Excisium”\r\n      to “Excisum”, has also been applied to the three other\r\n      occurrences in the text.\r\n    --the change listed for page 67 line 29, changing “d’ Esens”\r\n      to “d’ Escu” has been modified to change to “d’ Ecus”.
