It is obvious indeed that for the\r\nfuture student of American politics and history their preservation in\r\nconvenient and authentic form is not merely an important service, but\r\nan indispensable one; for it would have been impossible to collate\r\nthem in any accurate or complete way from the scattered files of\r\nnewspapers, especially since many of the addresses were delivered\r\nat points remote from news centers, and some of these were very\r\ninadequately reported by the press. This observation, it is needless\r\nto say, does not apply to the formal State Papers—chiefly messages\r\nto Congress—for such official deliverances are duly preserved and\r\npublished by the Government itself. It is, however, suitable as well\r\nas convenient to include these State Papers in a collection of the\r\nrecent utterances of President Roosevelt, for reasons so obvious as to\r\nneed little comment.\r\n\r\nThe palpable fact is that President Roosevelt’s messages to Congress\r\nand a large number of his speeches, delivered in various parts of\r\nthe country in his capacity as President, pertain to the same topics\r\nand serve a like public purpose. The messages must, of course, deal\r\nwith matters affecting the welfare of the nation, and with various\r\nquestions of public business or policy, in those aspects that bear\r\nupon the work of Congress. It is the President’s Constitutional right\r\nand duty to present information upon such topics, or to expound\r\nthem from the standpoint of the Administration. In the long series\r\nof Presidential messages one may, indeed, read the history of this\r\ncountry for more than a hundred years. To that official narrative\r\nthese messages by Mr. Roosevelt add some of the most fascinating\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nThe speeches here collected, on the other hand, have a much wider\r\nrange. Nevertheless, a great number of the addresses and speeches do\r\nin fact deal with precisely the same topics as those presented in the\r\nmessages to Congress, and were intended not merely for a particular\r\naudience but for the whole country through the medium of the press.\r\nAnd for Mr. Roosevelt’s full disclosure of his views and policies\r\ntouching some questions of large public concern, it is necessary to\r\nread his speeches in connection with his general or special messages\r\nto Congress. Since a number of his speeches here printed, like his\r\ngeneral messages, deal with a variety of matters, the reader who\r\nwishes to compare and collate his utterances upon a given subject—as,\r\nfor example, the regulation of the trusts, the reorganization of the\r\narmy, the relations of the United States to Cuba, or our methods and\r\npolicies of administration in the Philippines—will find it desirable\r\nto consult the index, which is intended to make these volumes\r\navailable for ready reference.\r\n\r\nQuite apart from their obvious value for reference purposes to the\r\nstudent of our contemporary history and politics, or to the campaign\r\nspeaker of one party or another—who may wish to know authoritatively\r\nwhat Mr. Roosevelt said about various public issues—this collection of\r\naddresses has several distinct merits and advantages that must give it\r\na place among works relating to the national life and character. Mr.\r\nRoosevelt, as an exponent of the aims and ideals of a great portion\r\nof his own generation of men and women in the United States, stands\r\nunquestionably first. In two volumes of his previously collected\r\nessays and papers, one entitled _American Ideals_ and the other _The\r\nStrenuous Life_, both of which are included in the present edition\r\nof his works, Mr. Roosevelt has expressed with remarkable vigor,—as\r\nwell as with an unwavering conviction and a wholesome philosophy\r\nof work and courage,—those views of politics, citizenship, and\r\norganized social and economic life to which the best conscience and\r\nintelligence of his fellow-countrymen have made sympathetic response.\r\nThese essays, it is true, set forth no abstract scheme of political or\r\nsocial philosophy. Yet out of them there might be evolved a systematic\r\nbody of doctrine relating to the duties of citizenship in a democracy,\r\nand to the ethics of administration and government. The explanation\r\nis that the doctrines and principles have come to be embodied in the\r\ncharacter and convictions of the man himself; and thus the essays\r\nand addresses have not been the mere intellectual products of a man\r\naddicted to the use of the pen or to the phrasing of sentences, but\r\nrather the direct and wellnigh spontaneous expression of Mr. Roosevelt\r\nin relation to topics rendered timely by events and occasions.\r\n\r\nIn like manner and in an even higher sense, these later speeches,\r\nmade under the sobering sense of responsibility that must come with\r\nthe holding of so great an office as the Presidency, express Mr.\r\nRoosevelt’s convictions respecting our American life and citizenship\r\nin such manner as to form a sort of record for the study of the\r\npsychology of the nation at the beginning of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, these addresses and public papers, while to some extent\r\nhomely, unstudied and unconventional in their phraseology, have the\r\nquality of permanent literature in a much higher measure than the\r\nutterances of almost any other American public man of our time.\r\nThe traditional American political oratory is highly stilted and\r\nartificial—overloaded with rhetoric and figures of speech, lacking\r\nvernacular force and directness. While the orotund and rhetorical\r\nmethod of the past has largely disappeared, there has followed it\r\nanother method almost equally artificial, in which the stately periods\r\nof the old-fashioned orator have been succeeded by the illustrative\r\namusing anecdote, the highly burnished witticism, and the pointed\r\nphrase or apothegm.\r\n\r\nMr. Roosevelt’s method is wholly different from either of these.\r\nExcept for being at times a trifle more earnest and hortatory, it is\r\nthe method of some of the best contemporary English speakers. They do\r\nnot posture, and do not attempt to be either orators or mere platform\r\nentertainers. Rather, they prefer to state in a direct, conversational\r\nmanner certain things that they wish to say. Their language is that\r\nwhich naturally, and without conscious effort, clothes their thoughts\r\nas men of culture and mature intellectual life. Mr. Roosevelt being a\r\nman of trained mind, strong conviction, historical knowledge, and wide\r\npublic experience, combined with great practical energy and executive\r\nforce, and buoyant physical health, has both his own opinions and his\r\nown ready and forcible way of expressing them.\r\n\r\nThus many of the speeches contained in this collection are as nearly\r\nextemporaneous utterances as any which have ever been put into\r\nsimilarly permanent form. Here are addresses made in almost every\r\nState and Territory of the Union; and they were prepared and delivered\r\nwithin a very short range of time, during which a far greater number\r\nof briefer and more casual speeches have been made, thousands of\r\nletters written, and innumerable statements upon matters of a public\r\ncharacter addressed to the Cabinet (collectively and individually), to\r\nSenators and members of Congress, to various executive officials, to\r\npublic men and citizens from every part of every State of the Union,\r\nto committees and deputations representing all classes and interests,\r\nand to representatives and visitors from all countries—whether a royal\r\nprince from Germany or a defeated Boer general from South Africa.\r\nAnd when one considers all these demands upon a President’s time,\r\nand knows something of the prodigious industry with which the Chief\r\nExecutive must devote himself to the almost innumerable duties that\r\npresent themselves daily in connection with his executive work, it\r\nbecomes plain that these speeches and addresses have been in the main\r\nthe spontaneous utterances of a richly stored mind inspired by firm\r\nconviction and resolute will, and supported by extraordinary physical\r\nstrength and vigor.\r\n\r\nYet Mr. Roosevelt’s speeches have not been carelessly prepared. Nor\r\nhave they ever been left—as some speakers profess to leave theirs—to\r\nthe “inspiration of the moment.” Mr. Roosevelt has unusual powers\r\nof concentration; and his achievement of so much work is due to his\r\nability to turn promptly from one thing to another and to give each\r\nsuccessive task his whole undivided attention. With an excellent\r\nmemory and a disciplined mind, he is able to summon to his aid at a\r\ngiven moment all his past resources of reading, study, and thought\r\nupon a given topic. Thus, before going on several of the long trips\r\nin connection with which a great number of addresses in these volumes\r\nwere made, the more important of the speeches for which dates had been\r\nfixed were dictated one after another to his stenographers late in\r\nthe evening when the day’s work was cleared away, social or official\r\nguests had departed, and an hour or two of uninterrupted time was at\r\nhis disposal.\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, is the same method by which a number of the essays and\r\naddresses which have become familiar in the collected volumes entitled\r\n_American Ideals_, and _The Strenuous Life_, had been prepared at\r\nformer periods when Mr. Roosevelt was under stress of much occupation.\r\nThere has been no attempt to polish sentences or to make fine phrases,\r\nyet there is the orderly and the deliberate expression that results\r\nfrom orderly processes of thinking. And there is the assured and\r\nconfident tone that reveals a steadfast mind seldom tormented by\r\ndoubts or misgivings.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is to be noted that these addresses are patriotic rather\r\nthan partisan, and that where they deal with matters of controversy\r\nthey show a spirit as little contentious or polemic as possible. While\r\nbelieving in the utility of the party system, Mr. Roosevelt spoke as\r\nPresident of the whole country and not merely as the chief of a party.\r\nHis speeches, in short, are the utterances of a man who embodies the\r\nnational spirit more broadly and fully than almost any other man of\r\nhis day. He expresses himself upon a wide range of topics with a\r\nlarger fund of experience and direct knowledge than is possessed by\r\nany other conspicuous public man of either party.\r\n\r\nIt is only through some understanding of the career that led up to\r\nhis assumption of the Presidency that the richness, the fulness, and\r\nthe authoritative quality of his observations on many varied themes\r\ncan be appreciated. Mr. Roosevelt’s life has, amid much variety,\r\npossessed great unity. While still in college at Harvard, his mind\r\nbecame centered upon the study of American life, American history, and\r\nAmerican government and policy. Whatever he undertook after leaving\r\ncollege added steadily to his understanding of the people of his own\r\ncountry and their institutions. Almost at once he threw himself into\r\nthe politics of the great State of New York, served several terms in\r\nthe Legislature, and made himself known throughout the country by the\r\nvigor and courage with which he applied himself to current problems\r\nof State and municipal reform. At a time when the so-called “spoils\r\nsystem” was powerfully rooted in the practical government of nation,\r\nState, and city, he became a civil service reformer.\r\n\r\nEverything that was worth while was of interest to him and everything\r\nthat he undertook to do was done whole-heartedly and thus made its\r\ncontribution to his own development. He was an officer in the militia,\r\nand learned lessons which became, years afterward, valuable to him as\r\na colonel in the Spanish-American war and later as commander-in-chief\r\nof the army by virtue of the Presidential office.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his first literary undertaking was the history of the\r\nnaval war of 1812, which appeared in 1882, and which will always\r\nremain a vital and standard account of our last war with Great\r\nBritain, especially from the standpoint of naval strategy and actual\r\noperations. Whether taking part himself in the current life of his\r\ncountry and in the making of its history, or whether studying or\r\nwriting about the part that others have taken in the development of\r\nthe nation, there has been on Mr. Roosevelt’s part always a singleness\r\nof purpose and a harmony of effort. Thus, when he wrote about the War\r\nof 1812, as when in later years he wrote the graphic yet accurate\r\nand well-poised studies of those Western movements, military and\r\ncivil, that created the Mississippi Valley (comprised in the series\r\nof volumes entitled _The Winning of the West_), there was on his\r\npart just as much a sense of dealing with realities as when in 1899\r\nhe wrote out the story of the part played by his regiment of Rough\r\nRiders in the Spanish-American war of the year before. This single\r\nwork, on _The Winning of the West_, in the opinion of the authorities,\r\njustified the honorary degree conferred upon Colonel Roosevelt by the\r\nUniversity of Norway on May 6, 1910.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which took him to the West in 1884 to become for\r\nsome years a cattle ranchman, a resident of the great plains, and\r\nan exponent of hunting and frontier life, involved in no manner an\r\ninterruption of the career upon which he had made so propitious an\r\nentrance. On the contrary, this was the best possible step that could\r\nhave been taken for the rounding out and development of the career of\r\na man destined, either in letters or in action, to spend his life in\r\ndealing with American affairs from a broad standpoint.\r\n\r\nMany of the most marked traits of the American people have been\r\nevolved through the process of pioneering. For three centuries our\r\npeople have been engaged in subduing a continent that they had found a\r\npathless wilderness. No man who has lacked contact with some concrete\r\nphases of our pioneering life can ever wholly enter into the spirit\r\nof the nation’s historical development, or perfectly understand the\r\ninherited qualities of our present day citizenship. Mr. Roosevelt’s\r\nWestern life supplied that needful element of understanding, while it\r\ngave him physical hardihood and a continental breadth of view. It gave\r\nhim, furthermore, that traditional American readiness with a horse and\r\na gun, and that adaptability to the free life of field and of woods\r\nwhich is the heritage of the average young American, and which made\r\nthe greater part of the Northern and Southern armies in the Civil War\r\nso unequaled, for effectiveness, in all military history.\r\n\r\nThrough these years of practical life in the West Mr. Roosevelt\r\nnever lost the studious and literary habit, nor did he lose any\r\nof his zest for the public affairs of the country. In due time he\r\nreturned to the East, took an active part in New York politics again,\r\nand was nominated for Mayor. Then he went to Washington, where\r\nfor a number of years he served as Chairman of the Board of Civil\r\nService Commissioners and became an expert in the field of national\r\nadministration. After that came his two years as President of the\r\nPolice Commissioners of New York City—a truly strenuous period that\r\ntested every quality of his mind and character. The navy had been at\r\nlow ebb when Mr. Roosevelt in 1882 wrote his _Naval War of 1812_, and\r\nthat book fairly contributed toward the revival of interest which\r\nsoon set on foot the movement for the creation of our modern fleet.\r\nThe author of that book had ever afterward been regarded both at home\r\nand abroad as an expert student of naval history and of sea power,\r\nand he had retained an enthusiastic interest in the whole subject. He\r\nwas well fitted, therefore, for the post of Assistant Secretary of the\r\nNavy, to which President McKinley appointed him at the very time when,\r\nmore clearly than most others, he foresaw the probability of a war\r\nwith Spain.\r\n\r\nHe threw his whole intense energy into the work of fitting our navy\r\nfor such a test, devoting himself especially to the questions of\r\nreadiness and efficiency in practical detail. And then came the\r\noutbreak of war. With the feeling that he was no longer needed in the\r\nnaval department, and that it was his duty to respond to the call for\r\nvolunteer soldiers, he entered the army. The history of that service\r\nhe has himself told in a fascinating way in the volume entitled _The\r\nRough Riders_, included in this edition of his works.\r\n\r\nThe war being ended, he returned to his own State of New York at a\r\nmoment when his party was casting about for a candidate for Governor.\r\nThe outlook was not propitious; but Mr. Roosevelt’s recent career\r\nhad given him a great personal popularity, and he was accordingly\r\nnominated and elected. Great questions of administration are always\r\npending in the State of New York, and there are few governmental\r\noffices in any country better adapted to train the incumbent for the\r\ntasks of practical statesmanship. Mr. Roosevelt took up the work\r\nof the Governorship with characteristic industry, and with results\r\nthat were successful and valuable in many directions. So well had he\r\nsatisfied the expectations of his party and of the State that his\r\nrenomination as Governor was assured; and the whole country had its\r\nattention fixed upon him as the probable nominee of his party for the\r\nPresidency in the year 1904.\r\n\r\nA variety of circumstances, however, most of them unexpected and some\r\nof them dramatic, led to an overwhelming demand by the Republican\r\nNational Convention at Philadelphia in 1900 that he forego his\r\nprospect of a second term as Governor of New York in order to take the\r\nnomination for the Vice-Presidency on the ticket with Mr. McKinley.\r\nHe was put forward by his party in that summer of 1900 as its most\r\neffective campaigner. But it has not been thought by him desirable\r\nthat any of the speeches made in a hotly contested Presidential\r\nelectoral campaign should be included in a collection of his public\r\naddresses. The tragic death of President McKinley, in September, 1901,\r\noccurred only six months after his entrance upon a second term, and\r\nthus it happened that Mr. Roosevelt had only a short time to serve in\r\nthe office of Vice-President.\r\n\r\nSo remarkable and so rapid a succession of valuable public\r\nexperiences, all of a kind to give training for the duties of the\r\nPresidency, is probably unparalleled in our history, unless in the\r\ncase of his successor, President Taft. Mr. Roosevelt had been the\r\nchief Civil Service Commissioner of this great nation, the head of\r\nthe police administration of our metropolis, the active official of\r\nthe naval department, the most energetic volunteer officer in the\r\nSpanish-American war, the Governor of New York, and the Vice-President\r\nof the United States. The man who had succeeded brilliantly in all\r\nthese positions, and who had treated every one of them in turn as if\r\nit furnished the one great opportunity for rendering public service,\r\ncould but bring to the Presidency an accumulated knowledge and\r\nexperience that must make itself felt in every part of the work of\r\nthat supreme office.\r\n\r\nIt is this wide range of experience and knowledge that has given Mr.\r\nRoosevelt the easy mastery of many subjects exhibited in the addresses\r\nand public papers that make up these volumes. Further, it is these\r\nspeeches and messages, far more than anything else contained in his\r\nwritings, that show him in his capacity as a practical statesman. They\r\nafford the unconscious but inevitable expression of the man in his\r\nrelation to public affairs.\r\n\r\nTo sum up and to conclude: These addresses reveal the unity and\r\nconsistency of Mr. Roosevelt’s character and career. He is indeed\r\na many-sided and versatile man, but there is nothing mutually\r\ncontradictory about the different phases of his nature or of his past\r\nundertakings. His vital Americanism is shown equally in his historical\r\nstudies of the pioneer movement that built up our great West and in\r\nhis accounts of ranching life and his studies of the big game of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIn his varied literary work, as in his other efforts and activities,\r\nthere is little or nothing of an incidental or _dilettante_ nature;\r\nall of it is the frank expression of the man himself. The book on the\r\nWar of 1812 was written when he was still very young. It might well\r\nhave proved to be the merely boyish effort of a young man who had\r\nsaid to himself, “Lo, I will go to work and write a book!” But, on\r\nthe contrary, it was in fact the outgrowth of vital interest and of\r\nstrong conviction regarding his subject; and so the book lives and\r\nwill continue to live. Thus all of his work, whether literary in its\r\ncharacter or active and official, has been done in the same direct,\r\nstraightforward way as simply pertaining to the task in hand; and the\r\ntask, whether great or small, has always been deemed worthy of the\r\nwhole vital energy of the man.\r\n\r\nThe great assemblage of public papers and addresses which we are\r\npresenting in the eight volumes that follow, herewith, belong for\r\nthe most part to the period of Mr. Roosevelt’s Presidential service,\r\nwhich ended March 4, 1909. Upon his reelection to the Presidency in\r\n1904, Mr. Roosevelt had declared that he would not be a candidate in\r\n1908 for another term. Although great pressure was brought to bear\r\nupon him in 1907 and in the first half of 1908 to permit the party\r\nto place his name again at the head of the Presidential ticket, he\r\nremained firm in the view that no President should serve for more than\r\ntwo consecutive terms. One of the last, as it is also one of the best,\r\naddresses of his memorable Presidential period is the one delivered\r\nat the celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of\r\nAbraham Lincoln, on February 12, 1909, and contained in the last of\r\nthese volumes. For a period of more than a year there is no speech or\r\npaper of Mr. Roosevelt that finds record in this collection. Almost at\r\nonce after retiring from the White House, Mr. Roosevelt, in pursuance\r\nof a long-cherished plan, accompanied by his son Kermit and several\r\nscientific experts, departed for Africa. He had been commissioned\r\nby the Smithsonian Institution to obtain a collection of African\r\nfauna, particularly the larger animals, for the Government’s museum\r\nat Washington. Mr. Roosevelt’s carrying out of this great project was\r\nwith all his familiar vitality and enthusiasm, and with results as\r\nsuccessful as could have been desired. His return by way of Egypt, and\r\nhis experiences as traveler and lecturer in Europe, preliminary to his\r\nreturn to America in June, 1910, were matters of interest everywhere.\r\nMr. Roosevelt, throughout Europe as well as in his own country, had\r\nbeen fully recognized for those qualities which these introductory\r\npages have tried to set forth. His European travels, as originally\r\nplanned, were to have been those of a private citizen seeking no\r\nhonors or publicity. But wherever he went governments and rulers, as\r\nwell as the masses of plain people, accorded him so great a welcome\r\nthat it can fairly be said that few men have ever received such\r\novations at any time in history. The death of King Edward led to the\r\nappointment of Mr. Roosevelt as special ambassador to represent the\r\nAmerican government in the formalities of the funeral. The diplomatic\r\ncharacter thus given to his presence in England added a final touch\r\nto the varied experiences of this remarkable foreign journey. Our\r\nconcluding volume contains the chief addresses delivered by him in\r\nEurope, notably those at the Sorbonne in Paris, the University of\r\nBerlin, and the University of Oxford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ADDRESSES AND STATE PAPERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENCY\r\n\r\n  EDITOR’S NOTE.—Although this volume is devoted almost entirely to\r\n  addresses made after Mr. Roosevelt became President, it is believed\r\n  that this essay on the office of the President, which has not\r\n  elsewhere appeared in book form, has a fitting place as introductory\r\n  to the materials which follow herewith. The article was written\r\n  by Mr. Roosevelt in 1900, while he was Governor of New York, and\r\n  previous to the Republican National Convention, which nominated\r\n  him for Vice-President. The views expressed in the article are,\r\n  therefore, those of an outside observer, and are not to be regarded\r\n  as those of an incumbent of the office. It will be clear to all\r\n  readers that the writer of the article could not at the time of its\r\n  publication have foreseen the place he was destined to occupy.\r\n\r\n  This article was written expressly for “The Youth’s Companion,” and\r\n  is reprinted by courtesy of that publication. Copyright, 1902, by\r\n  Perry Mason Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States occupies a position of peculiar\r\nimportance. In the whole world there is probably no other ruler,\r\ncertainly no other ruler under free institutions, whose power\r\ncompares with his. Of course a despotic king has even more, but no\r\nconstitutional monarch has as much.\r\n\r\nIn the republics of France and Switzerland the President is not a very\r\nimportant officer, at least, compared with the President of the United\r\nStates. In England the sovereign has much less control in shaping\r\nthe policy of the nation, the Prime Minister occupying a position\r\nmore nearly analogous to that of our President. The Prime Minister,\r\nhowever, can at any time be thrown out of office by an adverse vote,\r\nwhile the President can only be removed before his term is out for\r\nsome extraordinary crime or misdemeanor against the nation.\r\n\r\nOf course, in the case of each there is the enormous personal factor\r\nof the incumbent himself to be considered, entirely apart from the\r\npower of the office itself. The power wielded by Andrew Jackson was\r\nout of all proportion to that wielded by Buchanan, although in theory\r\neach was alike. So a strong President may exert infinitely more\r\ninfluence than a weak Prime Minister, or _vice versâ_. But this is\r\nmerely another way of stating that in any office the personal equation\r\nis always of vital consequence.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to speak of the framers of our Constitution as\r\nhaving separated the judicial, the legislative and the executive\r\nfunctions of the government. The separation, however, is not in\r\nall respects sharply defined. The President has certainly most\r\nimportant legislative functions, and the upper branch of the national\r\nlegislature shares with the President one of the most important of his\r\nexecutive functions; that is, the President can either sign or veto\r\nthe bills passed by Congress, while, on the other hand, the Senate\r\nconfirms or rejects his nominations. Of course the President can\r\nnot initiate legislation, although he can recommend it. But unless\r\ntwo-thirds of Congress in both branches are hostile to him, he can\r\nstop any measure from becoming a law. This power is varyingly used\r\nby different Presidents, but it always exists, and must always be\r\nreckoned with by Congress.\r\n\r\nWhile Congress is in session, if the President neither signs nor\r\nvetoes the bill which is passed, the bill becomes a law without his\r\nsignature. The effect is precisely the same as if he had signed it.\r\nPresidents who disapproved of details in a bill, but felt that on the\r\nwhole it was advisable it should become a law, have at times used this\r\nmethod to emphasize the fact that they were not satisfied with the\r\nmeasure which they were yet unwilling to veto. A notable instance was\r\nafforded in President Cleveland’s second term, when he thus treated\r\nthe Wilson-Gorman tariff bill.\r\n\r\nThe immense federal service, including all the postal employees, all\r\nthe customs employees, all the Indian agents, marshals, district\r\nattorneys, navy-yard employees, and so forth, is under the President.\r\nIt would of course be a physical impossibility for him to appoint all\r\nthe individuals in the service. His direct power lies over the heads\r\nof the departments, bureaus and more important offices. But he does\r\nnot appoint these by himself. His is only the nominating power. It\r\nrests with the Senate to confirm or reject the nominations.\r\n\r\nThe Senators are the constitutional advisers of the President, for\r\nit must be remembered that his Cabinet is not in the least like\r\nthe Cabinet of which the Prime Minister is head in the English\r\nParliament. Under our government the Secretaries who form the Cabinet\r\nare in the strictest sense the President’s own ministerial appointees;\r\nthe men, chosen out of all the nation, to whom he thinks he can best\r\ndepute the most important and laborious of his executive duties. Of\r\ncourse they all advise him on matters of general policy when he so\r\ndesires it, and in practice each Cabinet officer has a very free\r\nhand in managing his own department, and must have it if he is to do\r\ngood work. But all this advice and consultation is at the will of\r\nthe President. With the Senate, on the other hand, the advice and\r\nconsultation are obligatory under the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe President and Congress are mutually necessary to one another in\r\nmatters of legislation, and the President and the Senate are mutually\r\nnecessary in matters of appointment. Every now and then men who\r\nunderstand our Constitution but imperfectly raise an outcry against\r\nthe President for consulting the Senators in matters of appointment,\r\nand even talk about the Senators “usurping” his functions. These men\r\nlabor under a misapprehension. The Senate has no right to dictate to\r\nthe President who shall be appointed, but they have an entire right to\r\nsay who shall not be appointed, for under the Constitution this has\r\nbeen made their duty.\r\n\r\nIn practice, under our party system, it has come to be recognized\r\nthat each Senator has a special right to be consulted about the\r\nappointments in his own State, if he is of the President’s political\r\nparty. Often the opponents of the Senator in his State do not agree\r\nwith him in the matter of appointments, and sometimes the President,\r\nin the exercise of his judgment, finds it right and desirable to\r\ndisregard the Senator. But the President and the Senators must work\r\ntogether, if they desire to secure the best results.\r\n\r\nBut although many men must share with the President the responsibility\r\nfor different individual actions, and although Congress must of course\r\nalso very largely condition his usefulness, yet the fact remains that\r\nin his hands is infinitely more power than in the hands of any other\r\nman in our country during the time that he holds the office; that\r\nthere is upon him always a heavy burden of responsibility; and that in\r\ncertain crises this burden may become so great as to bear down any but\r\nthe strongest and bravest man.\r\n\r\nIt is easy enough to give a bad administration; but to give a good\r\nadministration demands the most anxious thought, the most wearing\r\nendeavor, no less than very unusual powers of mind. The chances for\r\nerror are limitless, and in minor matters, where from the nature\r\nof the case it is absolutely inevitable that the President should\r\nrely upon the judgment of others, it is certain that under the best\r\nPresidents some errors will be committed. The severest critics of a\r\nPresident’s policy are apt to be, not those who know most about what\r\nis to be done and of the limitations under which it must be done, but\r\nthose who know least.\r\n\r\nIn the aggregate, quite as much wrong is committed by improper\r\ndenunciation of public servants who do well as by failure to attack\r\nthose who do ill. There is every reason why the President, whoever he\r\nmay be and to whatever party he may belong, should be held to a sharp\r\naccountability alike for what he does and for what he leaves undone.\r\nBut we injure ourselves and the nation if we fail to treat with proper\r\nrespect the man, whether he is politically opposed to us or not, who\r\nin the highest office in our land is striving to do his duty according\r\nto the strength that is in him.\r\n\r\nWe have had Presidents who have acted very weakly or unwisely in\r\nparticular crises. We have had Presidents the sum of whose work has\r\nnot been to the advantage of the Republic. But we have never had one\r\nconcerning whose personal integrity there was so much as a shadow of\r\na suspicion, or who has not been animated by an earnest desire to\r\ndo the best possible work that he could for the people at large. Of\r\ncourse infirmity of purpose or wrong-headedness may mar this integrity\r\nand sincerity of intention; but the integrity and the good intentions\r\nhave always existed. We have never had in the Presidential chair any\r\nman who did not sincerely desire to benefit the people and whose own\r\npersonal ambitions were not entirely honorable, although as much can\r\nnot be said for certain aspirants for the place, such as Aaron Burr.\r\n\r\nCorruption, in the gross sense in which the word is used in ordinary\r\nconversation, has been absolutely unknown among our Presidents, and it\r\nhas been exceedingly rare in our President’s Cabinets. Inefficiency,\r\nwhether due to lack of will-power, sheer deficiency in wisdom, or\r\nimproper yielding either to the pressure of politicians or to the\r\nother kinds of pressure which must often be found even in a free\r\ndemocracy, has been far less uncommon. Of deliberate moral obliquity\r\nthere has been but very little indeed.\r\n\r\nIn the easiest, quietest, most peaceful times the President is sure\r\nto have great tasks before him. The simple question of revenue and\r\nexpenditure is as important to the nation as it is to the average\r\nhousehold, and the President is the man to whom the nation looks and\r\nwhom it holds accountable in the matter both of expenditure and of\r\nrevenue. It is an entirely mistaken belief that the expenditure of\r\nmoney is simply due to a taste for recklessness and extravagance on\r\nthe part of the people’s representatives.\r\n\r\nThe representatives in the long run are sure to try to do what the\r\npeople effectively want. The trouble is that although each group\r\nhas, and all the groups taken together still more strongly have,\r\nan interest in keeping the expenditures down, each group has also\r\na direct interest in keeping some particular expenditure up. This\r\nexpenditure is usually entirely proper and desirable, save only that\r\nthe aggregate of all such expenditures may be so great as to make it\r\nimpossible for the nation to go into them.\r\n\r\nIt is a good deal the same thing in the nation as it is in a State.\r\nThe demand may be for a consumptive hospital, or for pensions to\r\nveterans, or for a public building, or for an armory, or for cleaning\r\nout a harbor, or for starting irrigation. In each case the demand\r\nmay be in itself entirely proper, and those interested in it, from\r\nwhatever motives, may be both sincere and strenuous in their advocacy.\r\nBut the President has to do on a large scale what every Governor of a\r\nState has to do on a small scale, that is, balance the demands on the\r\nTreasury with the capacities of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nWhichever way he decides, some people are sure to think that he has\r\ntipped the scale the wrong way, and from their point of view they may\r\nconscientiously think it; whereas from his point of view he may know\r\nwith equal conscientiousness that he has done his best to strike an\r\naverage which would on the one hand not be niggardly toward worthy\r\nobjects, and on the other would not lay too heavy a burden of taxation\r\nupon the people.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as these particular questions have to be met every year\r\nin connection with every session of Congress and with the work of\r\nevery department, it may readily be seen that even the President’s\r\nevery-day responsibilities are of no light order. So it is with his\r\nappointments. Entirely apart from the fact that there is a great\r\npressure for place, it is also the fact that in all the higher and\r\nmore important appointments there are usually conflicting interests\r\nwhich must somehow be reconciled to the best of the President’s\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nHere again it must be remembered that the matter is not always by any\r\nmeans one of merely what we call politics. Where there is a really\r\nserious conflict in reference to an appointment, while it may be\r\nmerely a factional fight, it is more apt to be because two groups\r\nof the President’s supporters differ radically and honestly on some\r\nquestion of policy; so that whatever the President’s decision may be,\r\nhe can not help arousing dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nOne thing to be remembered is that appointments and policies which are\r\nnormally routine and unimportant may suddenly become of absolutely\r\nvital consequence. For instance, the War Department was utterly\r\nneglected for over thirty years after the Civil War. This neglect\r\nwas due less to the successive Presidents than to Congress, and\r\nin Congress it was due to the fact that the people themselves did\r\nnot take an interest in the army. Neither the regular officer nor\r\nthe regular soldier takes any part in politics as a rule, so that\r\nthe demagogue and the bread-and-butter politician have no fear of\r\nhis vote; and to both of them, and also to the cheap sensational\r\nnewspaper, the army offers a favorite subject for attack. So it\r\noften happens that some amiable people really get a little afraid of\r\nthe army, and have some idea that it may be used some time or other\r\nagainst our liberties.\r\n\r\nThe army never has been and, I am sure, it never will be or can be a\r\nmenace to anybody save America’s foes, or aught but a source of pride\r\nto every good and far-sighted American. But it is only in time of\r\nactual danger that such facts are brought home vividly to the minds\r\nof our people, and so the army is apt to receive far less than its\r\nproper share of attention. But when an emergency like that caused by\r\nthe Spanish War arises, then the Secretary of War becomes the most\r\nimportant officer in the Cabinet, and the army steps into the place of\r\nforemost interest in all the country.\r\n\r\nIt is only once in a generation that such a crisis as the Spanish\r\nWar or the Mexican War or the War of 1812 has to be confronted, but\r\nin almost every administration lesser crises do arise. They may be\r\nin connection with foreign affairs, as was the case with the Chilean\r\ntrouble under President Harrison’s administration, the Venezuelan\r\nmatter in President Cleveland’s second term, or the Boxer uprising in\r\nChina last year. Much more often they relate to domestic affairs, as\r\nin the case of a disastrous panic, which produces terrible social and\r\nindustrial convulsions. Whatever the problem may be, the President has\r\ngot to meet it and to work out some kind of a solution. In midwinter\r\nor midsummer, with Congress sitting or absent, the President has\r\nalways to be ready to devote every waking hour to some anxious,\r\nworrying, harassing matter, most difficult to decide, and yet which it\r\nis imperative immediately to decide.\r\n\r\nAn immense addition to the President’s burden is caused by the\r\nentirely well-meaning people who ask him to do what he can not\r\npossibly do. For the first few weeks after the inauguration a new\r\nPresident may receive on an average fifteen hundred letters a day.\r\nHis mail is so enormous that often he can not read one letter in a\r\nhundred, and rarely can he read one letter in ten. Even his private\r\nsecretary can read only a small fraction of the mail. Often there are\r\nletters which the President would really be glad to see, but which are\r\nswamped in the great mass of demands for office, demands for pensions,\r\nnotes of warning or advice, demands for charity, and requests of every\r\nconceivable character, not to speak of the letters from “cranks,”\r\nwhich are always numerous in the President’s mail.\r\n\r\nOne President, who was very anxious to help people whenever he could,\r\nmade the statement that the requests for pecuniary aid received in a\r\nsingle fortnight would, if complied with, have eaten up considerably\r\nmore than his entire year’s salary. The requests themselves are\r\nfrequently such as the President would like to comply with if there\r\nwas any way of making a discrimination; but there is none.\r\n\r\nOne rather sad feature of the life of a President is the difficulty\r\nof making friends, because almost inevitably after a while the friend\r\nthinks there is some office he would like, applies for it, and when\r\nthe President is obliged to refuse, feels that he has been injured.\r\nThose who were closest to Abraham Lincoln have said that this was\r\none of the things which concerned him most in connection with his\r\nadministration. It is hardly necessary to allude to the well-known\r\nfact that no President can gratify a hundredth part of the requests\r\nand demands made upon him for office, often by men who have rendered\r\nhim real services and who are fit to fill the position they seek, but\r\nnot so fit as somebody else. Of course the man does not realize that\r\nhis successful rival was appointed because he really was more fit, and\r\nhe goes away sour and embittered because of what he feels to be the\r\nPresident’s ingratitude.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the two most striking things in the Presidency are the immense\r\npower of the President, in the first place; and in the second place,\r\nthe fact that as soon as he has ceased being President he goes right\r\nback into the body of the people and becomes just like any other\r\nAmerican citizen. While he is in office he is one of the half-dozen\r\npersons throughout the whole world who have most power to affect the\r\ndestinies of the world.\r\n\r\nHe can set fleets and armies in motion; he can do more than any save\r\none or two absolute sovereigns to affect the domestic welfare and\r\nhappiness of scores of millions of people. Then when he goes out of\r\noffice he takes up his regular round of duties like any other citizen,\r\nor if he is of advanced age retires from active life to rest, like any\r\nother man who has worked hard to earn his rest.\r\n\r\nOne President, John Quincy Adams, after leaving the Presidency,\r\nagain entered public life as a Congressman, and achieved conspicuous\r\nsuccesses in the Lower House. This, however, is a unique case. Many\r\nPresidents have followed the examples of Jefferson and Jackson, and\r\nretired, as these two men retired to Monticello and The Hermitage.\r\nOthers have gone into more or less active work, as practicing\r\nlawyers or as lecturers on law, or in business, or in some form of\r\nphilanthropy.\r\n\r\nDuring the President’s actual incumbency of his office the tendency\r\nis perhaps to exaggerate not only his virtues but his faults. When he\r\ngoes out he is simply one of the ordinary citizens, and perhaps for a\r\ntime the importance of the rôle he has played is not recognized. True\r\nperspective is rarely gained until years have gone by.\r\n\r\nAltogether, there are few harder tasks than that of filling well\r\nand ably the office of President of the United States. The labor\r\nis immense, the ceaseless worry and harassing anxiety are beyond\r\ndescription. But if the man at the close of his term is able to feel\r\nthat he has done his duty well; that he has solved after the best\r\nfashion of which they were capable the great problems with which he\r\nwas confronted, and has kept clean and in good running order the\r\ngovernmental machinery of the mighty Republic, he has the satisfaction\r\nof feeling that he has performed one of the great world-tasks, and\r\nthat the mere performance is in itself the greatest of all possible\r\nrewards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSES AND STATE PAPERS\r\n\r\n\r\n  SPEECH OF PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT AT THE REUNION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF\r\n  THE POTOMAC, G. A. R., AT THE NEW WILLARD HOTEL, WASHINGTON, D. C.,\r\n  FEB. 19, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman, Commander-in-Chief, and you, my Comrades_:\r\n\r\nI can say that there is nothing else of which I am quite so proud\r\nas having won, in a sense, the right to claim comradeship with you.\r\nAnd, gentlemen, I recollect speaking with a friend at the time of the\r\nSpanish War as to why we went, and it was agreed that it was simply\r\nbecause we could not stay away. We had taken to heart the great\r\nobject-lesson that you gave. I am very glad to have the chance of\r\nseeing you this evening and of being with you. I would be but a poor\r\nAmerican if I did not appreciate to the full the debt under which\r\nAmerica rests to you, not alone for the lesson in war that you have\r\ngiven, but for what that lesson teaches as to peace. I meet you here\r\nand I see the general and the man from the ranks honor one another by\r\nthe highest title either knows—comrade. I see you applying the great\r\nlesson of brotherhood—the lesson that must be applied in civil life\r\nno less than in military life if we are to work out, as we shall work\r\nout, aright the problems that face the Republic. The war in which I\r\nwas engaged was a small affair; but it gave us an understanding of\r\nwhat you had done and of what you had been through. I know pretty\r\nwell what kind of memories you have. I know what you did, what you\r\nrisked, what you sacrificed. I know what it meant to you, and I know\r\nwhy you did it. There are two or three lessons that you taught that\r\nI hope this country will not only never forget, but will never cease\r\napplying. In the first place the motive—the tissue of motives that\r\nspurred you on—the love for liberty, love for union, and the love for\r\nthe stable and ordered freedom of a great people. You braved nights\r\nin the freezing mud of the trenches in winter, and the marches under\r\nscorching midsummer suns; fever cots, wounds, insufficient food,\r\nexhausting fatigue of a type that those that have not tried it can\r\nnot even understand. You did it without one thought of the trivial\r\nmonetary reward at the moment; you did it because your souls spurred\r\nyou on. And that is the reason why to this day, when any man speaks\r\nto a body of veterans he speaks to a body of men who are instant to\r\nrespond to any call for adherence to a lofty ideal. In other words,\r\nyou practiced, and by practicing preached, in the strongest manner,\r\nthe ideal of doing your duty, of doing duty when duty calls, without\r\nthought of what the reward might be. In the days when the sad, kindly,\r\npatient Lincoln—mighty Lincoln—stood in the White House like a high\r\npriest of the people, between the horns of the altar, and poured\r\nout the blood of the bravest and best, it was because only by that\r\nsacrifice could the flag that had been rent in sunder once again be\r\nmade without a seam. You taught the ideal of duty—duty, a word that\r\nstands above glory, or any other word. Glory is a good word, too, but\r\nduty is a better one.\r\n\r\nYou taught, in addition to that, brotherhood. In the ranks, as you\r\nstood there shoulder to shoulder, little any one of you cared what the\r\nman next to you was as regarded wealth, trade, or education, if he was\r\nin very truth a man. And, friends, short would have been our shrift\r\nif in our army as a whole there had been any failure to exercise just\r\nthat type of judgment—to exercise the judgment on the man as a man;\r\nshort would have been our shrift if we had failed to do justice to the\r\nbricklayer on the one hand, or to the banker on the other; if we had\r\nshown either contempt of the one, or the no less mean emotion of envy\r\nfor the other. If we are to go on, as we shall and must go on in our\r\nnational career, we must apply in the civic life of our nation exactly\r\nthe principles which obtained in the Grand Army of the Republic.\r\nThere are plenty of foes to fight and we can not afford to have\r\nhonest men betrayed into hostility toward one another; betrayed into\r\nacting toward one another in a way that will permanently deteriorate\r\nthe standard of our national character. We can afford to disagree\r\non questions of proper political difference. There are plenty such.\r\nBut we can not afford, if we are to remain true to the ideals of the\r\npast, to differ about those ideals. We can not afford to do less than\r\njustice to any man. We can not afford to shrink from seeing that the\r\nright obtains; nor, on the other hand, to rebuke any effort to stir up\r\nthose dark and evil forces which lurk in each man’s breast, and which\r\nneed to be kept down, not excited.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief spoke of the great and good President—of\r\nPresident McKinley—who died for the people exactly as Abraham Lincoln\r\ndied. You who wore the blue in the early sixties warred against that\r\nspirit of disunion which, if successful, would have meant widespread\r\ngovernmental anarchy throughout this land. You warred for orderly\r\nliberty. So now it behooves each of us so to conduct his civil life,\r\nso to do his duty as a citizen, that we shall in the most effective\r\nway war against the spirit of anarchy in all its forms. You did mighty\r\ndeeds, and you leave us more than mighty deeds, for you leave us the\r\nmemory of how you did them. You leave us not only the victory, but\r\nthe spirit that lay behind it and shone through it. You leave us not\r\nonly the triumph, but the memory of the patient resolution, of the\r\nsuffering, of the dogged endurance and heroic daring through which\r\nthat triumph came to pass. You in your youth and early manhood took\r\nup the greatest task which fell to the lot of any generation of our\r\npeople to perform. You did it well. We have lesser tasks, and yet\r\ntasks of great and vital importance. Woe to us if we do not show\r\nourselves worthy to be your successors, by doing our lesser tasks with\r\nthe same firm determination for right that you displayed when you\r\nfought to a finish the great Civil War, when you upheld the arms of\r\nAbraham Lincoln, and followed to victory the flag of Ulysses S. Grant.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE CHARLESTON EXPOSITION, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 9, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President, Mr. Mayor, and you, the Men and Women of the\r\n  Palmetto State, Men and Women of the South; my Fellow-citizens of\r\n  the Union_:\r\n\r\nIt is indeed to me a peculiar pleasure to have the chance of coming\r\nhere to this Exposition held in your old, your beautiful, your\r\nhistoric city.\r\n\r\nMy mother’s people were from Georgia; but before they came to Georgia,\r\nbefore the Revolution, in the days of Colonial rule, they dwelt for\r\nnearly a century in South Carolina; and therefore I can claim your\r\nState as mine by inheritance no less than by the stronger and nobler\r\nright which makes each foot of American soil in a sense the property\r\nof all Americans.\r\n\r\nCharleston is not only a typical Southern city; it is also a city\r\nwhose history teems with events which link themselves to American\r\nhistory as a whole. In the early Colonial days Charleston was the\r\noutpost of our people against the Spaniard in the South. In the days\r\nof the Revolution there occurred here some of the events which vitally\r\naffected the outcome of the struggle for Independence, and which\r\nimpressed themselves most deeply upon the popular mind. It was here\r\nthat the tremendous, terrible drama of the Civil War opened.\r\n\r\nWith delicate and thoughtful courtesy you originally asked me to come\r\nto this Exposition on the birthday of Abraham Lincoln. The invitation\r\nnot only showed a fine generosity and manliness in you, my hosts,\r\nbut it also emphasized as hardly anything else could have emphasized\r\nhow completely we are now a united people. The wounds left by the\r\ngreat Civil War, incomparably the greatest war of modern times, have\r\nhealed; and its memories are now priceless heritages of honor alike\r\nto the North and to the South. The devotion, the self-sacrifice,\r\nthe steadfast resolution and lofty daring, the high devotion to the\r\nright as each man saw it, whether Northerner or Southerner—all these\r\nqualities of the men and women of the early sixties now shine luminous\r\nand brilliant before our eyes, while the mists of anger and hatred\r\nthat once dimmed them have passed away forever.\r\n\r\nAll of us, North and South, can glory alike in the valor of the men\r\nwho wore the blue and of the men who wore the gray. Those were iron\r\ntimes, and only iron men could fight to its terrible finish the giant\r\nstruggle between the hosts of Grant and Lee, the struggle that came to\r\nan end thirty-seven years ago this very day. To us of the present day,\r\nand to our children and children’s children, the valiant deeds, the\r\nhigh endeavor, and abnegation of self shown in that struggle by those\r\nwho took part therein will remain for evermore to mark the level to\r\nwhich we in our turn must rise whenever the hour of the Nation’s need\r\nmay come.\r\n\r\nWhen four years ago this Nation was compelled to face a foreign foe,\r\nthe completeness of the reunion became instantly and strikingly\r\nevident. The war was not one which called for the exercise of more\r\nthan an insignificant fraction of our strength, and the strain put\r\nupon us was slight indeed compared with the results. But it was a\r\nsatisfactory thing to see the way in which the sons of the soldier of\r\nthe Union and the soldier of the Confederacy leaped eagerly forward,\r\nemulous to show in brotherly rivalry the qualities which had won\r\nrenown for their fathers, the men of the great war. It was my good\r\nfortune to serve under an ex-Confederate general, gallant old Joe\r\nWheeler, who commanded the cavalry division at Santiago.\r\n\r\nIn my regiment there were certainly as many men whose fathers had\r\nserved in the Southern, as there were men whose fathers had served\r\nin the Northern, army. Among the captains there was opportunity to\r\npromote but one to field rank. The man who was singled out for this\r\npromotion because of conspicuous gallantry in the field was the son of\r\na Confederate general and was himself a citizen of this, the Palmetto\r\nState; and no American officer could wish to march to battle beside a\r\nmore loyal, gallant, and absolutely fearless comrade than my former\r\ncaptain and major, your fellow-citizen, Micah Jenkins.\r\n\r\nA few months ago, owing to the enforced absence of the Governor of\r\nthe Philippines, it became necessary to nominate a Vice-Governor to\r\ntake his place—one of the most important places in our Government at\r\nthis time. I nominated as Vice-Governor an ex-Confederate, General\r\nLuke Wright, of Tennessee. It is therefore an ex-Confederate who now\r\nstands as the exponent of this Government and this people in that\r\ngreat group of islands in the eastern seas over which the American\r\nflag floats. General Wright has taken a leading part in the work of\r\nsteadily bringing order and peace out of the bloody chaos in which\r\nwe found the islands. He is now taking a leading part not merely in\r\nupholding the honor of the flag by making it respected as the symbol\r\nof our power, but still more in upholding its honor by unwearied labor\r\nfor the establishment of ordered liberty—of law-creating, law-abiding\r\ncivil government—under its folds.\r\n\r\nThe progress which has been made under General Wright and those like\r\nhim has been indeed marvelous. In fact, a letter of the General’s the\r\nother day seemed to show that he considered there was far more warfare\r\nabout the Philippines in this country than there was warfare in the\r\nPhilippines themselves! It is an added proof of the completeness of\r\nthe reunion of our country that one of the foremost men who have been\r\ninstrumental in driving forward the great work for civilization and\r\nhumanity in the Philippines has been a man who in the Civil War fought\r\nwith distinction in a uniform of Confederate gray.\r\n\r\nIf ever the need comes in the future the past has made abundantly\r\nevident the fact that from this time on Northerner and Southerner\r\nwill in war know only the generous desire to strive how each can do\r\nthe more effective service for the flag of our common country. The\r\nsame thing is true in the endless work of peace, the never-ending\r\nwork of building and keeping the marvelous fabric of our industrial\r\nprosperity. The upbuilding of any part of our country is a benefit to\r\nthe whole, and every such effort as this to stimulate the resources\r\nand industry of a particular section is entitled to the heartiest\r\nsupport from every quarter of the Union. Thoroughly good national work\r\ncan be done only if each of us works hard for himself, and at the same\r\ntime keeps constantly in mind that he must work in conjunction with\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nYou have made a particular effort in your Exhibition to get into touch\r\nwith the West Indies. This is wise. The events of the last four years\r\nhave shown us that the West Indies and the Isthmus must in the future\r\noccupy a far larger place in our national policy than in the past.\r\nThis is proved by the negotiations for the purchase of the Danish\r\nIslands, the acquisition of Porto Rico, the preparation for building\r\nan Isthmian canal, and, finally, by the changed relations which these\r\nyears have produced between us and Cuba. As a Nation we have especial\r\nright to take honest pride in what we have done for Cuba. Our critics\r\nabroad and at home have insisted that we never intended to leave the\r\nisland. But on the 20th of next month Cuba becomes a free republic,\r\nand we turn over to the islanders the control of their own government.\r\nIt would be very difficult to find a parallel in the conduct of any\r\nother great State that has occupied such a position as ours. We have\r\nkept our word and done our duty, just as an honest individual in\r\nprivate life keeps his word and does his duty.\r\n\r\nBe it remembered, moreover, that after our four years’ occupation of\r\nthe island we turn it over to the Cubans in a better condition than it\r\never has been in all the centuries of Spanish rule. This has a direct\r\nbearing upon our own welfare. Cuba is so near to us that we can never\r\nbe indifferent to misgovernment and disaster within its limits. The\r\nmere fact that our administration in the island has minimized the\r\ndanger from the dreadful scourge of yellow fever, alike to Cuba and\r\nto ourselves, is sufficient to emphasize the community of interest\r\nbetween us. But there are other interests which bind us together.\r\nCuba’s position makes it necessary that her political relations with\r\nus should differ from her political relations with other powers. This\r\nfact has been formulated by us and accepted by the Cubans in the Platt\r\namendments. It follows as a corollary that where the Cubans have thus\r\nassumed a position of peculiar relationship to our political system\r\nthey must similarly stand in a peculiar relationship to our economic\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nWe have rightfully insisted upon Cuba adopting toward us an attitude\r\ndiffering politically from that she adopts toward any other\r\npower; and in return, as a matter of right, we must give to Cuba a\r\ndifferent—that is, a better—position economically in her relations\r\nwith us than we give to other powers. This is the course dictated by\r\nsound policy, by a wise and far-sighted view of our own interest, and\r\nby the position we have taken during the past four years. We are a\r\nwealthy and powerful country, dealing with a much weaker one; and the\r\ncontrast in wealth and strength makes it all the more our duty to deal\r\nwith Cuba, as we have already dealt with her, in a spirit of large\r\ngenerosity.\r\n\r\nThis Exposition is rendered possible because of the period of\r\nindustrial prosperity through which we are passing. While material\r\nwell-being is never all-sufficient to the life of a nation, yet it\r\nis the merest truism to say that its absence means ruin. We need to\r\nbuild a higher life upon it as a foundation; but we can build little\r\nindeed unless this foundation of prosperity is deep and broad. The\r\nwell-being which we are now enjoying can be secured only through\r\ngeneral business prosperity, and such prosperity is conditioned upon\r\nthe energy and hard work, the sanity and the mutual respect, of all\r\nclasses of capitalists, large and small, of wage-workers of every\r\ndegree. As is inevitable in a time of business prosperity, some men\r\nsucceed more than others, and it is unfortunately also inevitable that\r\nwhen this is the case some unwise people are sure to try to appeal to\r\nthe envy and jealousy of those who succeed least. It is a good thing\r\nwhen these appeals are made to remember that while it is difficult\r\nto increase prosperity by law, it is easy enough to ruin it, and that\r\nthere is small satisfaction to the less prosperous if they succeed in\r\noverthrowing both the more prosperous and themselves in the crash of a\r\ncommon disaster.\r\n\r\nEvery industrial exposition of this type necessarily calls up the\r\nthought of the complex social and economic questions which are\r\ninvolved in our present industrial system. Our astounding material\r\nprosperity, the sweep and rush rather than the mere march of our\r\nprogressive material development, have brought grave troubles in\r\ntheir train. We can not afford to blink these troubles, any more than\r\nbecause of them we can afford to accept as true the gloomy forebodings\r\nof the prophets of evil. There are great problems before us. They\r\nare not insoluble, but they can be solved only if we approach them\r\nin a spirit of resolute fearlessness, of common-sense, and of honest\r\nintention to do fair and equal justice to all men alike. We are\r\ncertain to fail if we adopt the policy of the demagogue who raves\r\nagainst the wealth which is simply the form of embodied thrift,\r\nforesight, and intelligence; who would shut the door of opportunity\r\nagainst those whose energy we should especially foster, by penalizing\r\nthe qualities which tell for success. Just as little can we afford to\r\nfollow those who fear to recognize injustice and to endeavor to cut it\r\nout because the task is difficult or even—if performed by unskilful\r\nhands—dangerous.\r\n\r\nThis is an era of great combinations both of labor and of capital. In\r\nmany ways these combinations have worked for good; but they must work\r\nunder the law, and the laws concerning them must be just and wise, or\r\nthey will inevitably do evil; and this applies as much to the richest\r\ncorporation as to the most powerful labor union. Our laws must be\r\nwise, sane, healthy, conceived in the spirit of those who scorn the\r\nmere agitator, the mere inciter of class or sectional hatred; who wish\r\njustice for all men; who recognize the need of adhering so far as\r\npossible to the old American doctrine of giving the widest possible\r\nscope for the free exercise of individual initiative, and yet who\r\nrecognize also that after combinations have reached a certain stage\r\nit is indispensable to the general welfare that the Nation should\r\nexercise over them, cautiously and with self-restraint, but firmly,\r\nthe power of supervision and regulation.\r\n\r\nAbove all, the administration of the government, the enforcement of\r\nthe laws, must be fair and honest. The laws are not to be administered\r\neither in the interest of the poor man or the interest of the rich\r\nman. They are simply to be administered justly; in the interest of\r\njustice to each man be he rich or be he poor—giving immunity to\r\nno violator, whatever form the violation may assume. Such is the\r\nobligation which every public servant takes, and to it he must be true\r\nunder penalty of forfeiting the respect both of himself and of his\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my fellow-countrymen, in closing I am going to paraphrase\r\nsomething said by Governor Aycock last night. I have dwelt to-day upon\r\nthe fact that we are indeed a reunited people; that we are indeed and\r\nforever one people. The time was when one could not have made that\r\nstatement with truth; now it can be truthfully said. There was a time\r\nwhen it was necessary to keep saying it, because it was already true,\r\nand because the assertion made it more true; but the time is at hand,\r\nI think the time has come, when it is not necessary to say it again.\r\nProud of the South? Of course we are proud of the South; not only\r\nSoutherners, but Northerners are proud of the South. Proud of your\r\ngreat deeds? Of course I am proud of your great deeds, for you are\r\nmy people. I thank you from my heart for the welcome you have given\r\nme, and I assure you that few experiences in my life have been more\r\npleasant than the experiences of these two days that I have spent\r\namong you.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT NEW YORK AT THE BANQUET AT SHERRY’S IN HONOR OF DR. NICHOLAS\r\n  MURRAY BUTLER, PRESIDENT OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, APRIL 19, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman, and you, my hosts, and my Fellow-Guests_:\r\n\r\nWhat I am going to say to-night will be based upon the altogether\r\nadmirable address made this afternoon by my old and valued friend,\r\nthe new president of your great university, in the course of which\r\nhe spoke of what the university can contribute to the state as being\r\nscholarship and service. There are only a limited number of men of any\r\nuniversity who can add to what has been so well called by Professor\r\nMunsterberg “productive scholarship.” Of course each university should\r\nbend its energies toward developing the few men who are thus able\r\nto add to the sum of the nation’s work in scholarly achievement. To\r\nthose men the all-important doctrine to preach is that one piece of\r\nfirst-rate work is worth a thousand pieces of second-rate work; and\r\nthat after a generation has passed each university will be remembered\r\nby what its sons have produced, not in the line of a mass of pretty\r\ngood work, but in the way of the few masterpieces. I do not intend,\r\nhowever, to dwell upon this side of the university’s work, the work of\r\nscholarship, the work of the intellect trained to its highest point\r\nof productiveness. I want to speak of the other side, the side that\r\nproduces service to the public, service to the nation. Not one in a\r\nhundred of us is fit to be in the highest sense a productive scholar,\r\nbut all of us are entirely fit to do decent service if we care to take\r\nthe pains. If we think we can render it without taking the pains, if\r\nwe think we can render it by feeling how nice it would be to render\r\nit—why, the value of that service will be but little.\r\n\r\nFortunately to-day those who addressed you had a right to appeal not\r\nmerely to what they had spoken, but to what they had done. When we\r\nare inclined to be pessimistic over affairs, and especially public\r\naffairs here in the United States, it is a pleasant thing to be able\r\nto look back to the last twenty years of the life of Columbia’s late\r\nPresident, Mayor Low. And now, for a moment, look at things in their\r\npure historic perspective. Think what it means in the way of an\r\nobject-lesson to have a man who, after serving two terms as Mayor of\r\nwhat is now one of the great boroughs of this great city, then became\r\nfor twelve years the President of one of the foremost institutions\r\nof learning in the entire land, and then again became the chief\r\nofficer of the city. That was not merely creditable to Mr. Low; it was\r\ncreditable to us. It spoke well for the city. It is a big mark on the\r\ncredit side. We have plenty of marks on the debit side; but we feel\r\nthat this goes a long way toward making the balance even.\r\n\r\nAs for the Dean—why, I sat at the feet of that Gamaliel when I first\r\nwent into politics. He and I took part in the affairs of the old\r\nTwenty-first Assembly District in the days when I was just out of\r\ncollege. My very first experiences in practical politics were gained\r\nin connection with the Dean. And, gentlemen, as I gradually passed out\r\nof the sphere of the Dean, I passed into the sphere of your present\r\nPresident, and he has been my close friend, my valued adviser, ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to rendering service, that which counts chiefly with a\r\ncollege graduate, as with any other American citizen, is not intellect\r\nso much as what stands above mere power of body, or mere power of\r\nmind, but must in a sense include them, and that is character. It\r\nis a good thing to have a sound body, and a better thing to have a\r\nsound mind; and better still to have that aggregate of virile and\r\ndecent qualities which we group together under the name of character.\r\nI said both decent and virile qualities—it is not enough to have one\r\nor the other alone. If a man is strong in mind and body and misuses\r\nhis strength then he becomes simply a foe to the body politic, to\r\nbe hunted down by all decent men; and if, on the other hand, he has\r\nthoroughly decent impulses but lacks strength he is a nice man, but\r\ndoes not count. You can do but little with him.\r\n\r\nIn the unending strife for civic betterment, small is the use of\r\nthese people who mean well, but who mean well feebly. The man who\r\ncounts is the man who is decent and who makes himself felt as a force\r\nfor decency, for cleanliness, for civic righteousness. He must have\r\nseveral qualities; first and foremost, of course, he must be honest,\r\nhe must have the root of right thinking in him. That is not enough.\r\nIn the next place he must have courage; the timid good man counts\r\nbut little in the rough business of trying to do well the world’s\r\nwork. And finally, in addition to being honest and brave he must have\r\ncommon-sense. If he does not have it, no matter what other qualities\r\nhe may have he will find himself at the mercy of those who, without\r\npossessing his desire to do right, know only too well how to make the\r\nwrong effective.\r\n\r\nTo you, the men of Columbia here, the men of this great city, and the\r\nmen who, when they graduate, go to other parts of the country, we have\r\nthe right to look in an especial degree for service to the public.\r\nTo you much has been given, and woe and shame to you if we can not\r\nrightfully expect much from you in return.\r\n\r\nWe can pardon the man who has no chance in life if he does but little\r\nfor the State, and we can count it greatly to his credit if he does\r\nmuch for the State. But upon you who have had so much rests a heavy\r\nburden to show that you are worthy of what you have received. A double\r\nresponsibility is upon you to use aright, not merely the talents that\r\nhave been given to you, but the chances you have to make much of these\r\ntalents. We have a right to expect service to the State from you in\r\nmany different lines: In the line of what, for lack of a better word,\r\nwe will call philanthropy; in all lines of effort for public decency.\r\n\r\nRemember always that the man who does a thing so that it is worth\r\ndoing is always a man who does his work for the work’s sake. Somewhere\r\nin Ruskin there is a sentence to the effect that the man who does a\r\npiece of work for the fee, normally does it in a second-rate way,\r\nand that the only first-rate work is the work done by the man who\r\ndoes it for the sake of doing it well, who counts the deed as itself\r\nhis reward. In no kind of work done for the public do you ever find\r\nthe really best, except where you find the man who takes hold of it\r\nbecause he is irresistibly impelled to do it, because he wishes to do\r\nit for the sake of doing it well, not for the sake of any reward that\r\ncomes afterward or in connection with it. Of course, gentlemen, that\r\nis true of almost every other walk of life, just exactly as true as it\r\nis in politics. A clergyman is not worth his salt if he finds himself\r\nbound to be a clergyman for the material reward of that profession.\r\nEvery doctor who has ever succeeded has been a man incapable of\r\nthinking of his fee when he did a noteworthy surgical operation. A\r\nscientific man, a writer, a historian, an artist, can only be a good\r\nman of science, a first-class artist, a first-class writer, if he does\r\nhis work for the sake of doing it well; and this is exactly as true\r\nin political life, exactly as true in every form of social effort, in\r\nevery kind of work done for the public at large. The man who does work\r\nworth doing is the man who does it because he can not refrain from\r\ndoing it, the man who feels it borne in on him to try that particular\r\njob and see if he can not do it well. And so it is with a general in\r\nthe field. The man in the Civil War who thought of any material reward\r\nfor what he did was not among the men whose names you read now on the\r\nhonor roll of American history.\r\n\r\nSo the work that our colleges can do is to fit their graduates to do\r\nservice—to fit the bulk of them, the men who can not go in for the\r\nhighest type of scholarship, to do the ordinary citizen’s service for\r\nthe country; and they can fit them to do this service only by training\r\nthem in character. To train them in character means to train them not\r\nonly to possess, as they must possess, the softer and gentler virtues,\r\nbut also the virile powers of a race of vigorous men, the virtues of\r\ncourage, of honesty—not merely the honesty that refrains from doing\r\nwrong, but the honesty that wars aggressively for the right—the\r\nvirtues of courage, honesty, and, finally, hard common-sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GRADUATING CLASS, NAVAL ACADEMY, ANNAPOLIS, MD., MAY 2, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen of the Graduating Class_:\r\n\r\nIn receiving these diplomas you become men who above almost any\r\nothers of the entire Union are to carry henceforth ever-present with\r\nyou the sense of responsibility which must come if you are worthy of\r\nwearing the uniform; which must come with the knowledge that on some\r\ntremendous day it may depend upon your courage, your preparedness,\r\nyour skill in your profession, whether or not the nation is again to\r\nwrite her name on the world’s roll of honor or is to know the black\r\nshame of defeat. We all of us earnestly hope that the occasion for war\r\nmay not arise, but if it has to come then this nation must win; and\r\nas Dr. Winston has pointed out, in winning the prime factor must of\r\nnecessity be the United States Navy. If the navy fails us then we are\r\ndoomed to defeat. It should therefore be an object of prime importance\r\nfor every patriotic American to see that the navy is built up; and\r\nthat it is kept to the highest point of efficiency both in personnel\r\nand material. Above all, it can not be too often repeated to those\r\nrepresentatives of the nation in whose hands the practical application\r\nof the principle lies, that in modern naval war the chief factor\r\nin achieving triumph is what has been done in the way of thorough\r\npreparation and training before the beginning of the war. It is what\r\nhas been done before the outbreak of war that counts most. After the\r\noutbreak, all that can be done is to use to best advantage the great\r\nwar engines, and the seamanship, marksmanship, and general practical\r\nefficiency which have already been provided by the forethought of\r\nthe national legislature and by the administrative ability, through\r\na course of years, of the Navy Department. A battleship can not be\r\nimprovised. It takes years to build. And we must learn that it is\r\nexactly as true that the skill of the officers and men in handling\r\na battleship aright can likewise never be improvised; that it must\r\nspring from use and actual sea service, and from the most careful,\r\nzealous, and systematic training. You to whom I am about to give these\r\ndiplomas now join the ranks of the officers of the United States Navy.\r\nYou enter a glorious service, proud of its memories of renown. You\r\nmust keep ever in your minds the thought of the supreme hour which\r\nmay come when what you do will forever add to or detract from that\r\nrenown. Some of you will have to do your part in helping construct the\r\nships and the guns which you use. You need to bend every energy toward\r\nmaking these ships and guns in all their details the most perfect\r\nof their kind throughout the world. The ship must be seaworthy, the\r\narmament fitted for best protection to the guns and men, the guns in\r\nall their mechanism fit to do the greatest possible execution in the\r\nshortest possible time. Every detail, whether of protection to the\r\ngun-crews, of rapidity and sureness in handling the ammunition and\r\nworking the elevating and revolving gear, or of quickness and accuracy\r\nin sighting, must be thought out far in advance, and the thought\r\ncarefully executed in the actual work. But after that has been done it\r\nremains true that the best ships and guns, the most costly mechanism,\r\nare utterly valueless if the men have not been trained to use them to\r\nthe best possible advantage. From now on throughout your lives there\r\ncan be no slackness in the performance of duty on your part. Much\r\nhas been given you, and much will be expected from you. Your duty\r\nmust be ever present with you, waking and sleeping. You must train\r\nyourselves, and you must train those under you, in the actual work of\r\nseamanship, in the actual work of gunnery. If the day for battle comes\r\nyou will need all that you possess of boldness, skill, determination,\r\nability to bear punishment, and instant readiness in an emergency.\r\nWithout these qualities you can do nothing, yet even with them you\r\ncan do but little if you have not had the forethought and set purpose\r\nto train yourselves and the enlisted men under you aright. Officers\r\nand men alike must have the sea habit; officers and men alike must\r\nrealize that in battle the only shots that count are the shots that\r\nhit, and that normally the victory will lie with the side whose shots\r\nhit oftenest. Of course you must have the ability to stand up to the\r\nhammering; the courage, the daring, the resolution to endure; but I\r\ntake it for granted you will have those qualities. It is less to be\r\nthought to your credit to have them than it would be eternally to\r\nyour discredit to lack them. I take it for granted you will have the\r\ncourage we have a right to expect to go with American seamanship; that\r\nyou will have the daring and the resolution. And I ask that you make\r\nit from now on your object to see that if ever the day should arise,\r\nyour courage, your readiness, your eager desire to win fresh renown\r\nfor the flag be made good by the training you have given yourselves\r\nand those under you in the practical work of your profession in\r\nseamanship and gunnery.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE BANQUET OF THE SOCIETY OF THE SONS OF THE AMERICAN\r\n  REVOLUTION, WASHINGTON, D. C., MAY 2, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Toastmaster; Mr. President; Compatriots; and Fellow-Americans_:\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to take part in greeting you this evening. Societies\r\nthat cultivate patriotism in the present by keeping alive the memory\r\nof what we owe to the patriotism of the past, fill an indispensable\r\nfunction in this Republic. You come here to-night from every\r\nquarter—from every State of the Republic and from the islands of the\r\nEastern Seas. The Republic has put up its flag in those islands, and\r\nthe flag will stay there.\r\n\r\nI am glad to meet you here to-night—you, the descendants of the\r\nstatesmen and soldiers who fought to establish this country in 1776,\r\nsome of the older among whom, and the fathers of the others, fought\r\nwith no less valor wearing the blue or the gray in the Civil War. May\r\nwe now show our fealty to the great men who did the great deeds of the\r\npast, not alone by word but by deed! May we prove ourselves true to\r\nthem, not merely by paying homage to their memory, but by so shaping\r\nthe policy of this great Republic as to make it evident that we are\r\nnot unworthy of our sires. They did justice, and we will do justice.\r\nThey did justice as strong men, not as weaklings; and we will show\r\nourselves strong men and not weaklings.\r\n\r\nBefore me I see men who lived in iron times, men who did great\r\ndeeds. I see here a delegate from Kentucky who served under Farragut\r\nin the great days of the Civil War. I see a descendant of a man\r\nfrom Connecticut who was called Brother Jonathan. All around these\r\ntables are gathered men the names of whose ancestors stand not\r\nonly for righteousness but also for strength—for both qualities,\r\ngentlemen. Righteousness finds weakness but a poor yoke-fellow. With\r\nrighteousness must go strength to make that righteousness of avail.\r\nAnd in the names of the mighty men of the past I ask each man here to\r\ndo his part in seeing that this nation remains true in deed as well\r\nas in word to the ideals of the past; to remember that we can no more\r\nafford to show weakness than we can afford to do wrong. Where wrong\r\nhas been done by any one the wrongdoer shall be punished; but we shall\r\nnot halt in our great work because some man has happened to do wrong.\r\nHonor to the statesmen of the past, and may the statesmen of the\r\npresent strive to live up to the example they set! Honor to the army\r\nand navy of the past! And honor to those gallant Americans wearing the\r\nuniform of the American Republic who in the army and the navy of the\r\npresent day uphold gloriously the most glorious traditions of the past!\r\n\r\nAnother thing, compatriots of the Society of the Sons of the American\r\nRevolution: We are Americans, and that means that we treat Americanism\r\nprimarily as a matter of spirit and purpose, and in the broadest sense\r\nwe regard every man as a good American, whatever his creed, whatever\r\nhis birthplace, if he is true to the ideals of this Republic.\r\n\r\nTo-day I have been down to Annapolis to see the graduating class of\r\nthe Naval Academy; and it would have done your hearts good to have\r\nseen those fine, manly, upstanding young fellows who looked every man\r\nstraight in the face without flinching. We may be sure that the honor\r\nof the Republic is safe in their hands.\r\n\r\nI was glad to meet those young fellows to-day. I am glad to meet\r\nrepresentatives of the navy like you, Admiral Watson, and of the army\r\nlike you, General Breckenridge. I am glad that we as Americans have\r\ncause to be proud of the army and the navy of the United States—of the\r\nmen who in the past have upheld the honor of the flag, and of their\r\nsuccessors, the soldiers and sailors of the present day, who during\r\nthe last three years have done such splendid work in the inconceivably\r\ndangerous and harassing warfare of the eastern tropics.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE LAYING OF THE CORNERSTONE OF THE McKINLEY MEMORIAL OHIO\r\n  COLLEGE OF GOVERNMENT OF THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY, WASHINGTON, D. C.,\r\n  MAY 14, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Ladies and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nI am to say but one word. Nothing more need be said than has been said\r\nalready by those who have addressed you this afternoon—the statesmen\r\nwho worked with McKinley and the pastor under whose ministrations he\r\nsat.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed appropriate that the Methodists of America—the men\r\nbelonging to that religious organization which furnished the pioneers\r\nin carving out of the West what is now the heart of the great\r\nAmerican Republic—should found this great university in the city of\r\nWashington and should build the college that is to teach the science\r\nof government in the name of the great exponent of good and strong\r\ngovernment who died last fall, who died as truly for this country as\r\nAbraham Lincoln himself.\r\n\r\nI thank you for having given me the opportunity this afternoon to come\r\nbefore you and to lay the cornerstone of this building.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE EXERCISES OF THE SOCIETY OF THE ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND,\r\n  ATTENDING THE REBURIAL OF MAJOR-GENERAL WILLIAM STARK ROSECRANS,\r\n  ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY, WASHINGTON, D. C., MAY 17, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Speaker Henderson; and you, the Comrades of the Great Chief whose\r\n  reburial in the National Cemetery here at Arlington we have met\r\n  together to commemorate_:\r\n\r\nSpeaker Henderson in his address has well said that the builder rather\r\nthan the destroyer is the man most entitled to honor among us; that\r\nthe man who builds up is greater than he who tears down; and that our\r\nhomage should be for the fighting man who not only fought worthily\r\nbut fought in a worthy cause. Therefore for all time, not merely the\r\npeople of this great reunited country but the nations of mankind\r\nwho see the hope for ordered liberty in what this country has done,\r\nwill hold you, the men of the great Civil War, and the leaders like\r\nhim whose mortal remains are to be put to-day in their final resting\r\nplace, in peculiar honor because you were soldiers who fought to\r\nbuild; you were upbuilders; you were the men to whose lot it fell to\r\nsave, to perpetuate, to make stronger the great national fabric, the\r\nfoundations of which had been laid by the men who fought under him\r\nwhose home at Mount Vernon stands as an equally prized memorial of\r\nthe past with Arlington. It is no chance that has made Mount Vernon\r\nand Arlington, here in the neighborhood of Washington, the two great\r\nmemorials of the nation’s past. One commemorates the founding and the\r\nother the saving of the nation. If it were not for what Arlington\r\nsymbolizes, Mount Vernon would mean little or nothing. If it were not\r\nfor what was done by Rosecrans and his fellows, the work of Washington\r\nwould have crumbled into bloody chaos and the deeds of the founders\r\nof this Republic be remembered only because they had begun another\r\nof the many failures to make practical the spirit of liberty in this\r\nworld. Without the work that you did the work of the men who fought\r\nthe Revolution to a successful close would have meant nothing. To\r\nyou it was given to do the one great work which if left undone would\r\nhave meant that all else done by our people would have counted for\r\nnothing. And you left us a reunited country, and therefore the right\r\nof brotherhood with and of pride in the gallantry and self-devotion\r\nof those who wore the gray, who were pitted against you in the great\r\nstruggle. The very fact that we appreciate more and more as the years\r\ngo on the all-importance to this country and to mankind of your\r\nvictory, makes it more and more possible for us to recognize in the\r\nheartiest and frankest manner the sincerity, the self-devotion, the\r\nfealty to the right as it was given to them to see the right, of our\r\nfellow Americans against whom you fought—and now the reunion is so\r\ncomplete that it is useless to allude to the fact that it is complete.\r\nAnd you left us another lesson in brotherhood. To-day you come here,\r\ncomrades of the Army of the Cumberland—the man who had a commission\r\nand the man who fought in the ranks—brothers, because each did what\r\nthere was in him to do for the right. Each did what he could and all\r\nalike shared equally in the glory of the deed that was done. Officer\r\nand enlisted man stand at the bar of history to be judged not by the\r\ndifference of rank, but by whether they did their duties in their\r\nrespective ranks. And oh, of how little count, looking back, the\r\ndifference of rank compared with the doing of the duty! What was true\r\nthen is true now. Doing the duty well is what counts. In any audience\r\nof this kind one sees in the highest official and social position men\r\nwho fought as enlisted men in the armies of the Union or in the armies\r\nof the Confederacy. All we ask is, did they do their duty? If they\r\ndid, honor to them! Little we care what particular position they held,\r\nsave insofar as the holding of exalted position gave the men a chance\r\nto do great and peculiar service.\r\n\r\nI shall not try to eulogize the dead General in the presence of his\r\ncomrades, in the presence of his countrymen who have come to honor\r\nthe memory of the man against whom they were pitted in the past—who\r\ncome here because they now, like us, are Americans and nothing else,\r\ndevoted to the Union and to one flag. I shall not try to speak of his\r\nservices in the presence of those who fought through the Civil War,\r\nwho risked the loss of life, who endured the loss of limb, who fought\r\nas enlisted men or came out boys not yet ready to enter college but\r\nable to bear commissions in the army of the United States, as the\r\nresult of three or four years of service with the colors. There are\r\nthose of each class of whom I have spoken who have addressed or will\r\naddress you to-day. They are entitled to speak as comrades of the\r\ngreat dead. But the younger among us are only entitled to pay to the\r\ngreat dead the homage of those to whom ordered liberty has been handed\r\ndown as a heritage because of the blood, and of the sweat, and of the\r\ntoil of the men who fought to a finish the great Civil War. Great were\r\nthe lessons you taught us in war. Great have been the lessons you have\r\ntaught us in peace since the war. Sincerely and humbly the men who\r\ncame after you hasten to acknowledge the debt that is owing to you.\r\nYou were the men of the mighty days who showed yourselves equal to\r\nthe days. We have to-day lesser tasks; and shame to us if we flinch\r\nfrom doing or fail to do well these lesser tasks, when you carried to\r\ntriumphant victory a task as difficult as that which was set you! Here\r\nin the presence of one of the illustrious dead whose names will remain\r\nforever on the honor roll of the greatest Republic upon which the sun\r\nhas ever shone, it behooves all of us, young and old, solemnly and\r\nreverently to pledge ourselves to continue undimmed the traditions you\r\nhave left us; to do the work, whatever that work may be, necessary\r\nto make good the work that you did; to acknowledge the inspiration\r\nof your careers in war and in peace; and to remind ourselves once\r\nfor all that lip loyalty is not the loyalty that counts. The loyalty\r\nthat counts is the loyalty which shows itself in deeds rather than in\r\nwords; and therefore we pledge ourselves to make good by our lives\r\nwhat you risked your lives to gain and keep for the nation as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE CENTENNIAL MEETING OF THE BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS OF THE\r\n  PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, CARNEGIE HALL, NEW YORK, N. Y., ON THE EVENING\r\n  OF MAY 20, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman; and you, my friends—for if this meeting means\r\n  anything, it means a commemoration of the embodied spirit of\r\n  friendship and righteousness working through the Church through\r\n  generations—_\r\n\r\nI am glad to have the chance of greeting you to-night. I belong to a\r\nclosely allied Church—the Dutch Reformed. I want to tell you a curious\r\nincident which was mentioned to me by one of the two gentlemen who,\r\non your behalf, met me this evening and brought me up here. Mr. Ogden\r\nmentioned to me that two hundred and sixty or seventy years ago, the\r\nfirst church of my denomination here in this city was put up under\r\ncontract by his ancestors, who then dwelt in Connecticut. It is, I\r\nthink, in a sense symbolical of how much the Church has counted in\r\nthe life of our people that the descendants of those who worshiped\r\nin that church and of those who under contract put it up, should be\r\nmeeting here this evening. I have another bond with you. There are not\r\nvery many Dutch Reformed churches in this city; not quite as many as\r\nthere should be; and during a considerable portion of my life I have\r\nhad to go to a Presbyterian church, because there was not a Reformed\r\nchurch to attend. All of my early years I went to the Madison Square\r\nPresbyterian Church, which then had as its pastor Dr. Adams. Those of\r\nyou who remember him will agree with me that he was one of the very\r\nfew men concerning whom it was not inappropriate to use the adjective\r\nby which I shall describe him, for he was in very truth a saintly man.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure on behalf of the people of the United States to greet\r\nyou and bid you welcome on this hundredth anniversary of the beginning\r\nof organized home missionary work by the Presbyterian Church. In one\r\nsense of course all earnest and fervent church work is a part of home\r\nmissionary work. Every earnest and zealous believer, every man or\r\nwoman who is a doer of the word and not a hearer only, is a lifelong\r\nmissionary in his or her field of labor—a missionary by precept,\r\nand, by what counts a thousandfold more than precept, by practice.\r\nEvery such believer exerts influence on those within reach, somewhat\r\nby word and infinitely more through the ceaseless, wellnigh unfelt\r\npressure—all the stronger where its exercise is unconscious—the\r\npressure of example, broad charity, and neighborly kindness.\r\n\r\nBut to-night we celebrate one hundred years of missionary work done\r\nnot incidentally, but with set purpose; a hundred years of effort\r\nto spread abroad the Gospel and lay the moral foundation upon which\r\nall true national greatness must rest. The century that has closed\r\nhas seen the conquest of this continent by our people. To conquer a\r\ncontinent is rough work. All really great work is rough in the doing,\r\nthough it seems smooth enough to those who look back upon it, or to\r\nthe contemporaries who overlook it from afar. We need display but\r\nscant patience with those who, sitting at ease in their own homes,\r\ndelight to exercise a querulous and censorious spirit of judgment\r\nupon their brethren who, whatever their shortcomings, are doing\r\nstrong men’s work as they bring the light of civilization into the\r\nworld’s dark places. The criticism of those who live softly, remote\r\nfrom the strife, is of little value; but it would be difficult to\r\noverestimate the value of the missionary work of those who go out to\r\nshare the hardship, and, while sharing it, not to talk, but to wage\r\nwar against the myriad forms of brutality. It is such missionary work\r\nthat prevents the pioneers from sinking perilously near the level of\r\nthe savage race against which they war. Without it the conquest of\r\nthis continent would have had little but an animal side. Without it\r\nthe pioneers’ fierce and rude virtues and sombre faults would have\r\nremained unlit by the flame of pure and loving aspiration. Without it\r\nthe life of this country would have been a life of inconceivably hard\r\nand barren materialism. Because of it, because of the spirit that lay\r\nunder those missionaries’ work, deep beneath and through the national\r\ncharacter runs that power of firm adherence to a lofty ideal upon\r\nwhich the safety of the nation will ultimately depend.\r\n\r\nHonor, thrice honor to those who for three generations, during the\r\nperiod of this people’s great expansion, have seen that the force of\r\nthe living truth expanded as the nation expanded! They bore the burden\r\nand heat of the day, they toiled obscurely and died unknown, that we\r\nmight come into a glorious heritage. Let us prove the sincerity of our\r\nhomage to their faith and their works by the way in which we manfully\r\ncarry toward completion the work they so well began.\r\n\r\nFriends, I made up my mind coming up here that I would speak to you\r\nof something that has taken place to-day and of something else that\r\nhas taken place within the last ten days. First of the action of\r\nthis nation which has culminated on this Tuesday, the twentieth of\r\nMay, nineteen hundred and two, in starting a free Republic on its\r\ncourse. That represented four years’ work. There were blunders and\r\nshortcomings in the work, of course; and there were men of little\r\nfaith who could only see the blunders and shortcomings. But it\r\nrepresents work triumphantly done. And I think that we as citizens\r\nof this Republic have a right to feel proud that we kept our pledge\r\nto the letter, and that we have established a new international\r\nprecedent. I do not remember (and I have thought a good deal about\r\nit, ladies and gentlemen) another case in modern times where, as a\r\nresult of such a war, the victorious nation has contented itself\r\nwith setting a new nation free and fitting it as well as could be\r\ndone to start well in the difficult path of self-government. Mere\r\nanarchy and ruin would have fallen upon the island if we had contented\r\nourselves with simple victory in the war and then had turned the\r\nisland loose to shift for itself. For over three years the harder\r\nwork of peace has supplemented the hard work of war; for over three\r\nyears our representatives in the island (representatives largely of\r\nthe army, remember—I sometimes hear the army attacked; gentlemen, I\r\nhave even heard missionaries attacked. But it is well for us that when\r\nthere comes a great work in peace or in war we have the army as an\r\ninstrument for it), our representatives in Cuba have steadily worked\r\nto build up a school system, to see to sanitation, to preserve order\r\nand secure the chance for the starting of industries; to do everything\r\nin our power so that the new government might begin with the chances\r\nin its favor. And now as a nation we bid it Godspeed. We intend to see\r\nthat it has all the aid we can give it, and I trust and believe that\r\nour people will, through their national legislature, see to it very\r\nshortly that Cuba has the advantage of entering into peculiarly close\r\nrelations with us in our economic system.\r\n\r\nThat is the deed that was consummated to-day; now for the other.\r\n\r\nTen days or a fortnight ago an appalling calamity befell another\r\nportion of the West Indies; befell islands not in any way under our\r\nflag—islands owning allegiance to two European powers. But their\r\nneed was great and our people met that need as speedily as possible.\r\nCongress at once appropriated a large sum of money and through private\r\ngifts great additions were made to that appropriation; and I found, as\r\nusual, the army and navy the instruments through which the work could\r\nbe done. I wanted to get men whom I could call on instantly to drop\r\nwhatever their work was and go down, with the certainty that neither\r\npestilence nor the danger from volcanoes or anything else would make\r\nthem swerve a half inch—men upon whose absolute integrity and capacity\r\nI could count, as well as on their courage. When I wanted these men\r\nand wanted them at once I turned to the army and the navy. I am sure\r\nthat we all feel proud that ships bearing the American flag should\r\nhave been the first to carry relief to those who had been stricken\r\ndown by so appalling a disaster.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that while there is much evil against which we need to\r\nwar with all the strength there is in us, and while there are many\r\ntendencies in the complex forces about us which are fraught with\r\nperil to the future welfare of the Republic and of mankind, yet it\r\nis a fine thing to see at the opening of this century such omens of\r\ninternational brotherhood, of a future when the sense of duty to\r\none’s neighbor will extend beyond national lines. They are good omens\r\nfor the future, these actions: that action which culminated to-day in\r\nestablishing the free Republic of Cuba; that action which made our\r\ncountry the first to reach out a generous and helping hand to those\r\nupon whom calamity had fallen, without regard to what the flag was to\r\nwhich they paid allegiance.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE OVERFLOW MEETING OF THE CENTENNIAL OF PRESBYTERIAN HOME\r\n  MISSIONS, CENTRAL PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, NEW YORK, N. Y., MAY 20, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman; Ladies and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nI am glad to have the chance of saying a word to you this evening,\r\nand I know you will pardon me if it is but a word, for I did not\r\nanticipate that there would be another meeting at which to speak.\r\n\r\nOf course, the very first thing that any nation has to do is to keep\r\nin order the affairs of its own household; to do that which is best\r\nfor its own life. And as has been so well and truthfully said, Dr.\r\nVan Dyke, by you this evening, the vital thing to a nation is the\r\nspiritual, not the material. Napoleon said that in war the moral was\r\nto the material as ten to one; and it is just exactly as true in\r\ncivil and social life. I do not mean for one moment to undervalue the\r\nmaterial. We must have thrift, business energy, business enterprise\r\nand all that spring from them, as the foundation upon which we are\r\nto build the great national superstructure. But it is a pretty poor\r\nbuilding if you have nothing but the basement. It is an admirable\r\nthing to have material development, great material riches, if we do\r\nnot misestimate the position that that material well-being should\r\noccupy in the nation. It is an admirable thing to have wealth if we\r\nuse it aright and understand its relative value compared to the things\r\nof the spirit. Now that sounds like preaching. But it is only an\r\nexpression of a political truism if you look at it in the right way.\r\nWe have spread during the last century over this whole continent. One\r\nhundred years ago the home missionary work was begun. Do you realize\r\nthat at that time any one who went west of the Mississippi went into\r\na foreign land? He did; and as late as 1846 any one who went, in this\r\nlatitude, to the Pacific Coast, went into a foreign land. But as we\r\nexpanded nationally, so it was our good fortune that there should go\r\nhand in hand with such expansion the expansion of the church work,\r\nand of all that goes with church work. I do not think we can realize\r\nthe all-importance of the way in which the vital need was met by the\r\nmen who went out as missionaries, and pastors, and workers in the\r\nlittle raw, struggling communities whose people were laying deep the\r\nfoundations of the great States that to-day fill the valley of the\r\nMississippi and stud the Pacific Coast. The men who went out have\r\nby their efforts given to what would otherwise have been the merely\r\nmaterial development of our people the spiritual lift that was vital\r\nto it—the spiritual lift that made in the end a great nation instead\r\nof merely a nation of well-to-do people. We want well-to-do people,\r\nbut if they are _only_ well-to-do people, they have come far short\r\nof what we have a right to demand. A giant work looms up before the\r\nchurches in this country, and it is work which the churches must\r\ndo. Our civilization has progressed in many ways for the right; in\r\nsome ways it has gone wrong. The tremendous sweep of our industrial\r\ndevelopment has already brought us face to face on this continent with\r\nmany a problem which has puzzled for generations the wisest people of\r\nthe old world. With that growth in the complexity of our civilization,\r\nof our industrialism, has grown an increase in the effective power\r\nalike of the forces that tell for good and of the forces that tell\r\nfor evil. The forces for evil, as our great cities grow, become more\r\nconcentrated, more menacing to the community, and if the community is\r\nto go forward and not back they must be met and overcome by forces for\r\ngood that have grown in corresponding degree. More and more in the\r\nfuture our churches must realize that we have a right to expect that\r\nthey shall take the lead in shaping those forces for good.\r\n\r\nI am not going to verge on the domain of theology, and still less\r\nof dogma. I do not think that at the present time there will be any\r\ndissent from the proposition that after all in this work-a-day world\r\nwe must largely judge men by their fruits; that we can not accept a\r\nlong succession of thistle crops as indicating fig trees; and that we\r\nhave a right to look to the churches for setting the highest possible\r\nstandard of conduct and of service, public and private, for the whole\r\nland; that the church must make itself felt by finding its expression\r\nthrough the life work of its members; not merely on Sunday, but on\r\nweek days; not merely within these walls, but at home and in business.\r\nWe have a right to expect that you will show your faith by your works;\r\nthat the people who have the inestimable advantages of the church-life\r\nand the home-life should be made to remember that as much has been\r\ngiven them, much will be expected of them; that they must lead upright\r\nlives themselves and be living forces in the war for decency among\r\ntheir surroundings; that we have a right to expect of you and those\r\nlike you that you shall not merely speak for righteousness, but do\r\nrighteousness in your own homes and in the world at large.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE OCCASION OF THE UNVEILING OF THE SOLDIERS’ AND SAILORS’\r\n  MONUMENT AT ARLINGTON, UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE NATIONAL SOCIETY OF\r\n  THE COLONIAL DAMES OF AMERICA, MAY 21, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mrs. President, and members of the Society, and you, my comrades,\r\n  and, finally, officers and men of the Regular Army, whom we took as\r\n  our models in the war four years ago_:\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to be here this afternoon to accept in the name of\r\nthe nation the monument put up by your society to the memory of those\r\nwho fell in the war with Spain; a short war; a war that called for\r\nthe exertion of only the merest fraction of the giant strength of\r\nthis nation; but a war, the effects of which will be felt through the\r\ncenturies to come, because of the changes it wrought. It is eminently\r\nappropriate that the monument should be unveiled to-day, the day\r\nsucceeding that on which the free republic of Cuba took its place\r\namong the nations of the world as a sequel to what was done by those\r\nmen who fell and by their comrades in ’98.\r\n\r\nAnd here, where we meet to honor the memory of those who drew the\r\ngreat prize of death in battle, a word in reference to the survivors:\r\nI think that one lesson every one who was capable of learning anything\r\nlearned from his experience in that war was the old, old lesson that\r\nwe need to apply in peace quite as much—the lesson that the man\r\nwho does not care to do any act until the time for heroic action\r\ncomes, does not do the heroic act when the time does come. You all\r\nof you remember, comrades, some man—it is barely possible some of\r\nyou remember being the man—who, when you enlisted, had a theory that\r\nthere was nothing but splendor and fighting and bloodshed in the war,\r\nand then had the experience of learning that the first thing you had\r\nto do was to perform commonplace duties, and perform them well. The\r\nwork of any man in the campaign depended upon the resolution and\r\neffective intelligence with which he started about doing each duty as\r\nit arose; not waiting until he could choose the duty that he thought\r\nsufficiently spectacular to do, but doing the duty that came to hand.\r\nThat is exactly the lesson that all of us need to learn in times of\r\npeace. It is not merely a great thing, but an indispensable thing that\r\nthe nation’s citizens should be ready and willing to die for it in\r\ntime of need; and the presence of no other quality could atone for the\r\nlack of such readiness to lay down life if the nation calls. But in\r\naddition to dying for the nation you must be willing and anxious to\r\nlive for the nation, or the nation will be badly off. If you want to\r\ndo your duty only when the time comes for you to die, the nation will\r\nbe deprived of valuable services during your lives.\r\n\r\nI never see a gathering of this kind; I never see a gathering\r\nunder the auspices of any of the societies which are organized to\r\ncommemorate the valor and patriotism of the founders of this nation;\r\nI never see a gathering composed of the men who fought in the great\r\nCivil War or in any of the lesser contests in which this country has\r\nbeen engaged, without feeling the anxiety to make such a gathering\r\nfeel, each in his or her heart, the all-importance of doing the\r\nordinary, humdrum, commonplace duties of each day as those duties\r\narise. A large part of the success on the day of battle is always due\r\nto the aggregate of the individual performance of duty during the\r\nlong months that have preceded the day of battle. The way in which\r\na nation arises to a great crisis is largely conditioned upon the\r\nway in which its citizens have habituated themselves to act in the\r\nordinary affairs of the national life. You can not expect that much\r\nwill be done in the supreme hour of peril by soldiers who have not\r\nfitted themselves to meet the need when the need comes, and you can\r\nnot expect the highest type of citizenship in the periods when it\r\nis needed if that citizenship has not been trained by the faithful\r\nperformance of ordinary duty. What we need most in this Republic\r\nis not special genius, not unusual brilliancy, but the honest and\r\nupright adherence on the part of the mass of the citizens and of\r\ntheir representatives to the fundamental laws of private and public\r\nmorality—which are now what they have been during recorded history. We\r\nshall succeed or fail in making this Republic what it should be made—I\r\nwill go a little further than that—what it shall and must be made,\r\naccordingly as we do or do not seriously and resolutely set ourselves\r\nto do the tasks of citizenship—and good citizenship consists in doing\r\nthe many small duties, private and public, which in the aggregate make\r\nit up.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT ARLINGTON, MEMORIAL DAY, MAY 30, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Commander; Comrades; and you, the men and women of the United\r\n  States who owe your being here to what was done by the men of the\r\n  great Civil War_:\r\n\r\nI greet you, and thank you for the honor done me in asking me to\r\nbe present this day. It is a good custom for our country to have\r\ncertain solemn holidays in commemoration of our greatest men and\r\nof the greatest crises in our history. There should be but few such\r\nholidays. To increase their number is to cheapen them. Washington\r\nand Lincoln—the man who did most to found the Union, and the man\r\nwho did most to preserve it—stand head and shoulders above all our\r\nother public men, and have by common consent won the right to this\r\npreëminence. Among the holidays which commemorate the turning points\r\nin American history, Thanksgiving has a significance peculiarly its\r\nown. On July 4 we celebrate the birth of the nation; on this day,\r\nthe 30th of May, we call to mind the deaths of those who died that\r\nthe nation might live, who wagered all that life holds dear for the\r\ngreat prize of death in battle, who poured out their blood like water\r\nin order that the mighty national structure raised by the far-seeing\r\ngenius of Washington, Franklin, Marshall, Hamilton, and the other\r\ngreat leaders of the Revolution, great framers of the Constitution,\r\nshould not crumble into meaningless ruins.\r\n\r\nYou whom I address to-day and your comrades who wore the blue beside\r\nyou in the perilous years during which strong, sad, patient Lincoln\r\nbore the crushing load of national leadership, performed the one\r\nfeat the failure to perform which would have meant destruction to\r\neverything which makes the name America a symbol of hope among the\r\nnations of mankind. You did the greatest and most necessary task which\r\nhas ever fallen to the lot of any men on this Western Hemisphere.\r\nNearly three centuries have passed since the waters of our coasts were\r\nfirst furrowed by the keels of those whose children’s children were to\r\ninherit this fair land. Over a century and a half of colonial growth\r\nfollowed the settlement; and now for over a century and a quarter we\r\nhave been a nation.\r\n\r\nDuring our four generations of national life we have had to do many\r\ntasks, and some of them of far-reaching importance; but the only\r\nreally vital task was the one you did, the task of saving the Union.\r\nThere were other crises in which to have gone wrong would have meant\r\ndisaster; but this was the one crisis in which to have gone wrong\r\nwould have meant not merely disaster but annihilation. For failure at\r\nany other point atonement could have been made; but had you failed\r\nin the iron days the loss would have been irreparable, the defeat\r\nirretrievable. Upon your success depended all the future of the people\r\non this continent, and much of the future of mankind as a whole.\r\n\r\nYou left us a reunited country. You left us the right of brotherhood\r\nwith the men in gray, who with such courage, and such devotion for\r\nwhat they deemed the right, fought against you. But you left us much\r\nmore even than your achievement, for you left us the memory of how\r\nit was achieved. You, who made good by your valor and patriotism the\r\nstatesmanship of Lincoln and the soldiership of Grant, have set as\r\nthe standards for our efforts in the future both the way you did your\r\nwork in war and the way in which, when the war was over, you turned\r\nagain to the work of peace. In war and in peace alike your example\r\nwill stand as the wisest of lessons to us and our children and our\r\nchildren’s children.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment the Army of the United States, led by men who\r\nserved among you in the great war, is carrying to completion a small\r\nbut peculiarly trying and difficult war in which is involved not only\r\nthe honor of the flag but the triumph of civilization over forces\r\nwhich stand for the black chaos of savagery and barbarism. The task\r\nhas not been as difficult or as important as yours, but, oh, my\r\ncomrades, the men in the uniform of the United States, who have for\r\nthe last three years patiently and uncomplainingly championed the\r\nAmerican cause in the Philippine Islands, are your younger brothers,\r\nyour sons. They have shown themselves not unworthy of you, and they\r\nare entitled to the support of all men who are proud of what you did.\r\n\r\nThese younger comrades of yours have fought under terrible\r\ndifficulties and have received terrible provocation from a very cruel\r\nand very treacherous enemy. Under the strain of these provocations\r\nI deeply deplore to say that some among them have so far forgotten\r\nthemselves as to counsel and commit, in retaliation, acts of\r\ncruelty. The fact that for every guilty act committed by one of our\r\ntroops a hundred acts of far greater atrocity have been committed\r\nby the hostile natives upon our troops, or upon the peaceable and\r\nlaw-abiding natives who are friendly to us, can not be held to excuse\r\nany wrongdoers on our side. Determined and unswerving effort must be\r\nmade, and has been and is being made, to find out every instance of\r\nbarbarity on the part of our troops, to punish those guilty of it, and\r\nto take, if possible, even stronger measures than have already been\r\ntaken to minimize or prevent the occurrence of all such acts in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nIs it only in the army in the Philippines that Americans sometimes\r\ncommit deeds that cause all other Americans to regret? No! From time\r\nto time there occur in our country, to the deep and lasting shame\r\nof our people, lynchings carried on under circumstances of inhuman\r\ncruelty and barbarity—cruelty infinitely worse than any that has ever\r\nbeen committed by our troops in the Philippines; worse to the victims,\r\nand far more brutalizing to those guilty of it. The men who fail to\r\ncondemn these lynchings, and yet clamor about what has been done in\r\nthe Philippines, are indeed guilty of neglecting the beam in their own\r\neye while taunting their brother about the mote in his. Understand me.\r\nThese lynchings afford us no excuse for failure to stop cruelty in the\r\nPhilippines. But keep in mind that these cruelties in the Philippines\r\nhave been wholly exceptional, and have been shamelessly exaggerated.\r\nWe deeply and bitterly regret that they should have been committed,\r\nno matter how rarely, no matter under what provocation, by American\r\ntroops. But they afford far less ground for a general condemnation\r\nof our army than these lynchings afford for the condemnation of the\r\ncommunities in which they occur. In each case it is well to condemn\r\nthe deed, and it is well also to refrain from including both guilty\r\nand innocent in the same sweeping condemnation.\r\n\r\nIn every community there are people who commit acts of wellnigh\r\ninconceivable horror and baseness. If we fix our eyes only upon\r\nthese individuals and upon their acts, and if we forget the far more\r\nnumerous citizens of upright and honest life and blind ourselves to\r\ntheir countless deeds of wisdom and justice and philanthropy, it is\r\neasy enough to condemn the community. There is not a city in this\r\nland which we could not thus condemn if we fixed our eyes solely upon\r\nits police record and refused to look at what it had accomplished for\r\ndecency and justice and charity. Yet this is exactly the attitude\r\nwhich has been taken by too many men with reference to our army in the\r\nPhilippines; and it is an attitude iniquitous in its absurdity and its\r\ninjustice.\r\n\r\nThe rules of warfare which have been promulgated by the War Department\r\nand accepted as the basis of conduct by our troops in the field are\r\nthe rules laid down by Abraham Lincoln when you, my hearers, were\r\nfighting for the Union. These rules provide, of course, for the\r\njust severity necessary in war. The most destructive of all forms\r\nof cruelty would be to show weakness where sternness is demanded by\r\niron need. But all cruelty is forbidden, and all harshness beyond\r\nwhat is called for by need. Our enemies in the Philippines have not\r\nmerely violated every rule of war, but have made of these violations\r\ntheir only method of carrying on the war. Think over that! It is not a\r\nrhetorical statement—it is a bald statement of contemporary history.\r\nThey have been able to prolong the war at all only by recourse to\r\nacts each one of which put them beyond the pale of civilized warfare.\r\nWe would have been justified by Abraham Lincoln’s rules of war in\r\ninfinitely greater severity than has been shown.\r\n\r\nThe fact really is that our warfare in the Philippines has been\r\ncarried on with singular humanity. For every act of cruelty by our\r\nmen there have been innumerable acts of forbearance, magnanimity, and\r\ngenerous kindness. These are the qualities which have characterized\r\nthe war as a whole. The cruelties on our part have been wholly\r\nexceptional.\r\n\r\nThe guilty are to be punished; but in punishing them, let those who\r\nsit at ease at home, who walk delicately and live in the soft places\r\nof the earth, remember also to do them common justice. Let not the\r\neffortless and the untempted rail overmuch at strong men who with\r\nblood and sweat face years of toil and days of agony, and at need\r\nlay down their lives in remote tropic jungles to bring the light\r\nof civilization into the world’s dark places. The warfare that has\r\nextended the boundaries of civilization at the expense of barbarism\r\nand savagery has been for centuries one of the most potent factors in\r\nthe progress of humanity. Yet from its very nature it has always and\r\neverywhere been liable to dark abuses.\r\n\r\nIt behooves us to keep a vigilant watch to prevent these abuses and to\r\npunish those who commit them; but if because of them we flinch from\r\nfinishing the task on which we have entered, we show ourselves cravens\r\nand weaklings, unworthy of the sires from whose loins we sprang. Oh,\r\nmy comrades, how the men of the present tend to forget not merely\r\nwhat was done but what was spoken in the past! There were abuses and\r\nto spare in the Civil War; and slander enough, too, by each side\r\nagainst the other. Your false friends then called Grant a “butcher”\r\nand spoke of you who are listening to me as mercenaries, as “Lincoln’s\r\nhirelings.” Your open foes—as in the resolution passed by the\r\nConfederate Congress in October, 1862—accused you, at great length,\r\nand with much particularity, of “contemptuous disregard of the usages\r\nof civilized war;” of subjecting women and children to “banishment,\r\nimprisonment, and death;” of “murder,” of “rapine,” of “outrages on\r\nwomen,” of “lawless cruelty,” of “perpetrating atrocities which would\r\nbe disgraceful in savages;” and Abraham Lincoln was singled out for\r\nespecial attack because of his “spirit of barbarous ferocity.” Verily,\r\nthese men who thus foully slandered you have their heirs to-day in\r\nthose who traduce our armies in the Philippines, who fix their eyes on\r\nindividual deeds of wrong so keenly that at last they become blind to\r\nthe great work of peace and freedom that has already been accomplished.\r\n\r\nPeace and freedom—are there two better objects for which a soldier can\r\nfight? Well, these are precisely the objects for which our soldiers\r\nare fighting in the Philippines. When there is talk of the cruelties\r\ncommitted in the Philippines, remember always that by far the greater\r\nproportion of these cruelties have been committed by the insurgents\r\nagainst their own people—as well as against our soldiers—and that not\r\nonly the surest but the only effectual way of stopping them is by the\r\nprogress of the American arms. The victories of the American Army have\r\nbeen the really effective means of putting a stop to cruelty in the\r\nPhilippines. Wherever these victories have been complete—and such is\r\nnow the case throughout the greater part of the islands—all cruelties\r\nhave ceased, and the native is secure in his life, his liberty, and\r\nhis pursuit of happiness. Where the insurrection still smoulders there\r\nis always a chance for cruelty to show itself.\r\n\r\nOur soldiers conquer; and what is the object for which they\r\nconquer? To establish a military government? No. The laws we are\r\nnow endeavoring to enact for the government of the Philippines are\r\nto increase the power and domain of the civil at the expense of the\r\nmilitary authorities, and to render even more difficult than in the\r\npast the chance of oppression. The military power is used to secure\r\npeace, in order that it may itself be supplanted by the civil power.\r\nThe progress of the American arms means the abolition of cruelty,\r\nthe bringing of peace, and the rule of law and order under the civil\r\ngovernment. Other nations have conquered to create irresponsible\r\nmilitary rule. We conquer to bring just and responsible civil\r\ngovernment to the conquered.\r\n\r\nBut our armies do more than bring peace, do more than bring order.\r\nThey bring freedom. Remember always that the independence of a tribe\r\nor a community may, and often does, have nothing whatever to do with\r\nthe freedom of the individual in that tribe or community. There are\r\nnow in Asia and Africa scores of despotic monarchies, each of which is\r\nindependent, and in no one of which is there the slightest vestige of\r\nfreedom for the individual man. Scant indeed is the gain to mankind\r\nfrom the “independence” of a blood-stained tyrant who rules over\r\nabject and brutalized slaves. But great is the gain to humanity which\r\nfollows the steady though slow introduction of the orderly liberty,\r\nthe law-abiding freedom of the individual, which is the only sure\r\nfoundation upon which national independence can be built. Wherever in\r\nthe Philippines the insurrection has been definitely and finally put\r\ndown, there the individual Filipino already enjoys such freedom, such\r\npersonal liberty under our rule, as he could never even have dreamed\r\nof under the rule of an “independent” Aguinaldian oligarchy.\r\n\r\nThe slowly-learned and difficult art of self-government, an art\r\nwhich our people have taught themselves by the labor of a thousand\r\nyears, can not be grasped in a day by a people only just emerging\r\nfrom conditions of life which our ancestors left behind them in the\r\ndim years before history dawned. We believe that we can rapidly teach\r\nthe people of the Philippine Islands not only how to enjoy but how\r\nto make good use of their freedom; and with their growing knowledge\r\ntheir growth in self-government shall keep steady pace. When they\r\nhave thus shown their capacity for real freedom by their power of\r\nself-government, then, and not till then, will it be possible to\r\ndecide whether they are to exist independently of us or be knit to us\r\nby ties of common friendship and interest. When that day will come\r\nit is not in human wisdom now to foretell. All that we can say with\r\ncertainty is that it would be put back an immeasurable distance if we\r\nshould yield to the counsels of unmanly weakness and turn loose the\r\nislands, to see our victorious foes butcher with revolting cruelty\r\nour betrayed friends, and shed the blood of the most humane, the most\r\nenlightened, the most peaceful, the wisest and the best of their own\r\nnumber—for these are the classes who have already learned to welcome\r\nour rule.\r\n\r\nNor, while fully acknowledging our duties to others, need we wholly\r\nforget our duty to ourselves. The Pacific seaboard is as much to us as\r\nthe Atlantic; as we grow in power and prosperity so our interests will\r\ngrow in that furthest west which is the immemorial east. The shadow\r\nof our destiny has already reached to the shores of Asia. The might\r\nof our people already looms large against the world-horizon; and it\r\nwill loom ever larger as the years go by. No statesman has a right to\r\nneglect the interests of our people in the Pacific; interests which\r\nare important to all our people, but of most importance to those of\r\nour people who have built populous and thriving States to the west of\r\nthe great watershed of this continent.\r\n\r\nThis should no more be a party question than the war for the Union\r\nshould have been a party question. At this moment the man in highest\r\noffice in the Philippine Islands is the Vice-Governor, General Luke\r\nWright, of Tennessee, who gallantly wore the gray in the Civil War\r\nand who is now working hand in hand with the head of our army in\r\nthe Philippines, Adna Chaffee, who in the Civil War gallantly wore\r\nthe blue. Those two, and the men under them, from the North and\r\nfrom the South, in civil life and in military life, as teachers, as\r\nadministrators, as soldiers, are laboring mightily for us who live at\r\nhome. Here and there black sheep are to be found among them; but taken\r\nas a whole they represent as high a standard of public service as this\r\ncountry has ever seen. They are doing a great work for civilization,\r\na great work for the honor and the interest of this nation, and above\r\nall for the welfare of the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands. All\r\nhonor to them; and shame, thrice shame, to us if we fail to uphold\r\ntheir hands!\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE OPENING SESSION OF THE MILITARY SURGEONS’ ASSOCIATION,\r\n  WASHINGTON, D. C., JUNE 5, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President; Ladies and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nI am glad to have the opportunity to bid welcome to the members of\r\nthis Association and their friends to-day. The men of your Association\r\ncombine two professions each of which is rightfully held in high honor\r\nby all capable of appreciating the real work of men—the profession of\r\nthe soldier and the profession of the doctor. Conditions in modern\r\ncivilization tend more and more to make the average life of the\r\ncommunity one of great ease, compared to what has been the case in\r\nthe past. Together with what advantages have come from this softening\r\nof life and rendering it more easy there are certain attendant\r\ndisadvantages. It is a very necessary thing that there should be some\r\nprofessions, some trades, where the same demands are made now as ever\r\nin the past upon the heroic qualities. Those demands are made alike\r\nupon the soldier and upon the doctor; and more upon those who are\r\nboth soldiers and doctors, upon the men who have continually to face\r\nall the responsibility, all the risk, faced by their brothers in the\r\ncivilian branch of the profession, and who also, in time of war, must\r\nface much the same risks, often exactly the same risks, that are faced\r\nby their brothers in arms whose trade is to kill and not to cure! It\r\nhas been my good fortune, gentlemen, to see some of your body at work\r\nin the field, to see them carrying the wounded and the dying from the\r\nfiring-line, themselves as much exposed to danger as those they were\r\nrescuing, and to see them working day and night in the field hospital\r\nafterward when even the intensity of the strain could hardly keep them\r\nawake, so fagged out were they by having each to do the work of ten.\r\n\r\nI welcome you here, and I am glad to have the chance of seeing\r\nyou, and I wish to say a word of congratulation to you upon this\r\nAssociation. In all our modern life we have found it absolutely\r\nindispensable to supplement the work of the individual by the work of\r\nthe individuals gathered into an association. Without this work of\r\nthe association you can not give the highest expression to individual\r\nendeavor, and it would be a great misfortune if the military members\r\nof the surgical and medical profession did not take every advantage\r\nof their opportunities in the same way that is taken by the members\r\nof the medical and the surgical professions who are not in the army\r\nor the navy or the marine hospital service—who are in civilian life\r\noutside. I am glad to see you gathered in this association. Just\r\none word of warning: Pay all possible heed to the scientific side\r\nof your work; perfect yourselves as scientific men able to work\r\nwith the best and most delicate apparatus; and never for one moment\r\nforget—especially the higher officers among you—that in time of need\r\nyou will have to do your work with the scantiest possible apparatus!\r\nand that then your usefulness will be conditioned not upon the\r\nadequacy of the complaint that you did not have apparatus enough,\r\nbut upon what you have done with the insufficient apparatus you had.\r\nRemember that and remember also—and this especially applies to the\r\nhigher officers—that you must supplement in your calling the work of\r\nthe surgeon with the work of the administrator. You must be doctors\r\nand military men and able administrators.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UNITED\r\n  STATES MILITARY ACADEMY, WEST POINT, JUNE 11, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Colonel Mills, graduates of West Point, and you, the Men and Women\r\n  who are drawn to them by ties of kinship, or by the simple fact that\r\n  you are Americans, and therefore of necessity drawn to them_:\r\n\r\nI am glad to have the chance of saying a word to you to-day. There\r\nis little need for me to say how well your performance has squared\r\nwith the prophetic promise made on your behalf by the greatest of\r\nAmericans, Washington. This institution has completed its first\r\nhundred years of life. During that century no other educational\r\ninstitution in the land has contributed as many names as West Point to\r\nthe honor roll of the nation’s greatest citizens.\r\n\r\nColonel Mills, I claim to be a historian, and I speak simply in the\r\nspirit of one, simply as a reciter of facts, when I say what I have\r\nsaid. And more than that; not merely has West Point contributed a\r\ngreater number of the men who stand highest on the nation’s honor\r\nroll, but I think beyond question that, taken as a whole, the average\r\ngraduate of West Point, during this hundred years, has given a greater\r\nsum of service to the country through his life than has the average\r\ngraduate of any other institution in this broad land. Now, gentlemen,\r\nthat is not surprising. It is what we had a right to expect from this\r\nMilitary University, founded by the nation. It is what we had a right\r\nto expect, but I am glad that the expectation has been made good.\r\nAnd of all the institutions in this country, none is more absolutely\r\nAmerican, none, in the proper sense of the word, more absolutely\r\ndemocratic than this.\r\n\r\nHere we care nothing for the boy’s birthplace, nor his creed, nor his\r\nsocial standing; here we care nothing save for his worth as he is able\r\nto show it. Here you represent with almost mathematical exactness all\r\nthe country geographically. You are drawn from every walk of life by\r\na method of choice made to ensure, and which in the great majority\r\nof cases does ensure, that heed shall be paid to nothing save the\r\nboy’s aptitude for the profession into which he seeks entrance. Here\r\nyou come together as representatives of America in a higher and more\r\npeculiar sense than can possibly be true of any other institution in\r\nthe land, save your sister college that makes similar preparation for\r\nthe service of the country on the seas.\r\n\r\nThis morning I have shaken hands with many of you; and I have met the\r\nmen who stand as representatives of every great struggle, every great\r\nforward movement this nation has made for the last fifty-five or sixty\r\nyears. There are some still left who took part in the Mexican War,\r\na struggle which added to this country a territory vaster than has\r\nchanged hands in Europe as the result of all the wars of the last two\r\ncenturies. I meet, when I see any of the older men among you, men who\r\ntook part in the great Civil War, when this nation was tried as in a\r\nfurnace; the men who were called upon to do the one deed which had to\r\nbe done under penalty of making the memory of Washington himself of\r\nlittle account, because if you had failed, then failure would also\r\nhave been written across the record of his work. Finally, I see the\r\nyounger men as well as the older ones, the men whom I myself have\r\nseen taking part in a little war—a war that was the merest skirmish\r\ncompared with the struggle in which you fought from ’61 to ’65, and\r\nyet a war that has had most far-reaching effects, not merely upon\r\nthe destiny of this nation, but, therefore, upon the destiny of the\r\nworld—the war with Spain.\r\n\r\nIt was my good fortune to see in the campaign in Cuba how the\r\ngraduates of West Point handled themselves; to see and to endeavor\r\nto profit by their example. It is a peculiar pleasure to come here\r\nto-day, because I was at that time intimately associated with many of\r\nthese, your graduates, who are here. On the day before the San Juan\r\nfight, when we were marched up into position, the officers with whom\r\nI was, lost connection with the baggage and food, and I, for supper\r\nthat night, had what Colonel Mills gave me. And the next morning\r\nColonel Mills was with another West Pointer, gallant Shipp, of North\r\nCarolina. The next morning we breakfasted together. I remember well\r\ncongratulating myself that my regiment, a raw volunteer regiment,\r\ncould have, to set it an example, men like Mills and Shipp, whose very\r\npresence made the men cool, made them feel collected and at ease.\r\nMills and Shipp went with our regiment into action. Shortly after it\r\nbegan Shipp was killed and Colonel Mills received a wound from which\r\nno one of us at the time dreamed that he would recover. I had at that\r\ntime in my regiment, as acting second lieutenant, a cadet from West\r\nPoint. He was having his holiday; he took his holiday coming down\r\nwith us, and just before the assault he was shot, the bullet going, I\r\nthink, into the stomach, and coming out the other side. He fell, and\r\nas we came up I leaned over him, and he said, “All right, Colonel, I\r\nam going to get well.” I did not think he was, but I said, “All right,\r\nI am sure you will,” and he did; he is all right now. There was never\r\na moment during that time, by day or by night, that I was not an\r\neyewitness to some performance of duty, some bit of duty well done, by\r\na West Pointer, and I never saw a West Pointer failing in his duty.\r\nI want to be perfectly frank, gentlemen; I _heard_ of two or three\r\ninstances; you can not get in any body of men absolute uniformity of\r\ngood conduct; but I am happy to say that I never was an eyewitness to\r\nsuch misconduct. It was my good fortune to see what is the rule, what\r\nis the rule with only the rarest exception; the rule of duty done in\r\na way that makes a man proud to be an American, the fellow-citizen of\r\nsuch Americans.\r\n\r\nYour duty here at West Point has been to fit men to do well in war.\r\nBut it is a noteworthy fact that you also have fitted them to do\r\nsingularly well in peace. The highest positions in the land have been\r\nheld, not exceptionally, but again and again by West Pointers. West\r\nPointers have risen to the first rank in all the occupations of civil\r\nlife. Colonel Mills, I make the answer that a man who answers the\r\nquestion must make when I say that, while we had a right to expect\r\nthat West Point would do well, we could not have expected that she\r\nwould do so well as she has done.\r\n\r\nI want to say one word to those who are graduating here, and to the\r\nundergraduates as well. I was greatly impressed the other day by an\r\narticle of one of your instructors, himself a West Pointer, in which\r\nhe dwelt upon the changed conditions of warfare, and the absolute need\r\nthat the man who was to be a good officer should meet those changed\r\nconditions. I think it is going to be a great deal harder to be a\r\nfirst-class officer in the future than it has been in the past. In\r\naddition to the courage and steadfastness that have always been the\r\nprime requirements in a soldier, you have got to show far greater\r\nfertility of resource and far greater power of individual initiative\r\nthan has ever been necessary before if you are to come up to the\r\nhighest level of officer-like performance of duty.\r\n\r\nAs has been well said, the developments of warfare during the last\r\nfew years have shown that in the future the unit will not be the\r\nregiment nor the company nor troop; the unit will be the individual\r\nman. The army is to a very great extent going to do well or ill\r\naccording to the average of that individual man. If he does not know\r\nhow to shoot, how to shift for himself, how both to obey orders and to\r\naccept responsibility when the emergency comes where he will not have\r\nany orders to obey, if he is not able to do all of that, and if in\r\naddition he has not got the fighting edge, you had better have him out\r\nof the army; he will be a damage in it.\r\n\r\nIn a battle hereafter each man is going to be to a considerable extent\r\nalone. The formation will be so open that the youngest officer will\r\nhave to take much of the responsibility that in former wars fell\r\non his seniors; and many of the enlisted men will have to do most\r\nof their work without supervision from any officer whatsoever. The\r\nman will have to act largely alone, and if he shows a tendency to\r\nhuddle up to somebody else his usefulness will be pretty near at an\r\nend. He must draw on his own courage and resourcefulness to meet the\r\nemergencies as they come up. It will be more difficult in the future\r\nthan ever before to know your profession, and more essential also; and\r\nyou officers, and you who are about to become officers, if you are\r\ngoing to do well, have got to learn how to perform the duty which,\r\nwhile become more essential, has become harder to perform.\r\n\r\nYou want to face the fact and realize more than ever before that the\r\nhonor or the shame of the country may depend upon the high average\r\nof character and capacity of the officers and enlisted men, and that\r\na high average of character and capacity in the enlisted men can to\r\na large degree be obtained only through you, the officers; that you\r\nmust devote your time in peace to bringing up the standard of fighting\r\nefficiency of the men under you, not merely in doing your duty so that\r\nyou can not be called to account for failure to perform it, but doing\r\nit in a way that will make any man under you abler to perform his.\r\n\r\nI noticed throughout the time that we were in Cuba that the orders\r\ngiven and executed were of the simplest kind, and that there was\r\nvery little manœuvring, practically none of the manœuvring of the\r\nparade-ground. Now, I want you to weigh what I say, for if you take\r\nonly half of it, you will invert it. I found out very soon in my\r\nregiment that the best man was the man who had been in the Regular\r\nArmy in actual service, out in the West, campaigning on the plains; if\r\nhe had been a good man in the Regular Army in actual service on the\r\nplains he was the best man that I could get hold of. On the other\r\nhand, if he had merely served in time of peace a couple of years in\r\nan Eastern garrison, where he did practically nothing outside of\r\nparade grounds and barracks, or if he had been in an ordinary National\r\nGuard regiment, then one of two things was true; if he understood\r\nthat he had only learned five per cent of war, he was five per cent\r\nbetter than any one who had learned none of it, and that was a big\r\nadvance; but if he thought he had also learned the other ninety-five\r\nper cent he was worse than any one else. I recollect perfectly one\r\nman who had been a corporal in the Regular Army; this young fellow\r\njoined us sure that he knew everything, confident that war consisted\r\nin nice parade-ground manœuvres. It was almost impossible to turn his\r\nattention from trying the very difficult task of making my cowpunchers\r\nkeep in a straight line, to the easier task of training them so that\r\nthey could do the most efficient fighting when the occasion arose. He\r\nconfused the essentials and the non-essentials. The non-essentials\r\nare so pretty and so easy that it is a great temptation to think that\r\nyour duty lies in perfecting yourself and the men under you in them.\r\nYou have got to do that, too; but if you only do that you will not be\r\nworth your salt when the day of trial comes.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I do not intend to try here to preach to you upon the\r\nperformance of your duties. It has been your special business to\r\nlearn to do that. I do ask you to remember the difference there is\r\nin the military profession now from what it has been in past time;\r\nto remember that the final test of soldiership is not excellence in\r\nparade-ground formation, but efficiency in actual service in the\r\nfield, and that the usefulness, the real and great usefulness in the\r\nparade-ground and barracks work comes from its being used not as an\r\nend, but as one of the means to an end. I ask you to remember that.\r\nI do not have to ask you to remember what you can not forget—the\r\nlessons of loyalty, of courage, of steadfast adherence to the highest\r\nstandards of honor and uprightness which all men draw in when they\r\nbreathe the atmosphere of this great institution.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE HARVARD COMMENCEMENT DINNER, CAMBRIDGE, MASS., JUNE 25, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President; President Eliot; and you, my Fellow Harvard Men_:\r\n\r\nI am speaking for all of you I am sure—I speak for all Americans\r\nto-day, when I say that we watch with the deepest concern the sick-bed\r\nof the English king, and that all Americans in tendering their hearty\r\nsympathy to the people of Great Britain remember keenly the outburst\r\nof genuine grief with which England last fall greeted the calamity\r\nthat befell us in the death of President McKinley.\r\n\r\nPresident Eliot spoke of the service due and performed by the college\r\ngraduate to the State. It was my great good fortune five years ago\r\nto serve under your President, the then Secretary of the Navy,\r\nex-Governor Long, and by a strange turn of the wheel of fate he served\r\nin my Cabinet as long as he would consent to serve, and then I had to\r\nreplace him by another Harvard man!\r\n\r\nI have been fortunate in being associated with Senator Hoar, and I\r\nshould indeed think ill of myself if I had not learned something from\r\nassociation with a man who possesses that fine and noble belief in\r\nmankind, the lack of which forbids healthy effort to do good in a\r\ndemocracy like ours. I shall not speak of his associate, the junior\r\nsenator, another Harvard man—Cabot Lodge—because it would be difficult\r\nfor me to discuss in public one who is my closest, stanchest, and most\r\nloyal personal friend. I have another fellow Harvard man to speak\r\nof to-day, and it is necessary to paraphrase an old saying in order\r\nto state the bald truth, that it is indeed a liberal education in\r\nhigh-minded statesmanship to sit at the same council table with John\r\nHay.\r\n\r\nIn addressing you this afternoon, I want to speak of three other\r\ncollege graduates, because of the service they have done the public.\r\nIf a college education means anything, it means fitting a man to do\r\nbetter service than he could do without it; if it does not mean that\r\nit means nothing, and if a man does not get that out of it, he gets\r\nless than nothing out of it. No man has a right to arrogate to himself\r\none particle of superiority or consideration because he has had a\r\ncollege education, but he is bound, if he is in truth a man, to feel\r\nthat the fact of his having had a college education imposes upon him\r\na heavier burden of responsibility, that it makes it doubly incumbent\r\nupon him to do well and nobly in his life, private and public. I wish\r\nto speak of three men, who, during the past three or four years have\r\nmet these requirements—of a graduate of Hamilton College, Elihu Root,\r\nof a graduate of Yale, Governor Taft, and of a fellow Harvard man,\r\nLeonard Wood—men who did things; did not merely say how they ought\r\nto be done, but did them themselves; men who have met that greatest\r\nof our national needs, the need for service that can not be bought,\r\nthe need for service that can only be rendered by the man willing to\r\nforego material advantages because it has to be given at the man’s own\r\nmaterial cost.\r\n\r\nWhen in England they get a man to do what Lord Cromer did in Egypt,\r\nwhen a man returns as Lord Kitchener will return from South Africa,\r\nthey give him a peerage, and he receives large and tangible reward.\r\nBut our Cromers, our men of that stamp, come back to this country, and\r\nif they are fortunate, they go back to private life with the privilege\r\nof taking up as best they can the strings left loose when they severed\r\ntheir old connections; and if fortune does not favor them they are\r\naccused of maladversion in office—not an accusation that hurts them,\r\nbut an accusation that brands with infamy every man who makes it, and\r\nthat reflects but ill on the country in which it is made.\r\n\r\nLeonard Wood four years ago went down to Cuba, has served there ever\r\nsince, has rendered her literally invaluable service; a man who\r\nthrough those four years thought of nothing else, did nothing else,\r\nsave to try to bring up the standard of political and social life in\r\nthat island, to clean it physically and morally, to make justice even\r\nand fair in it, to found a school system which should be akin to our\r\nown, to teach the people after four centuries of misrule that there\r\nwere such things as governmental righteousness and honesty and fair\r\nplay for all men on their merits as men. He did all this. He is a\r\nman of slender means. He did this on his pay as an army officer. As\r\nGovernor of the island sixty millions of dollars passed through his\r\nhands, and he came out having been obliged to draw on his slender\r\ncapital in order that he might come out even when he left the island.\r\nCredit to him? Yes, in a way. In another, no particular credit,\r\nbecause he was built so that he could do nothing else. He devoted\r\nhimself as disinterestedly to the good of the Cuban people in all\r\ntheir relations as man could. He has come back here, and has been\r\nattacked, forsooth, by people who are not merely unworthy of having\r\ntheir names coupled with his but who are incapable of understanding\r\nthe motives that have spurred him on to bring honor to this republic.\r\n\r\nAnd Taft, Judge Taft, Governor Taft, who has been the head of the\r\nPhilippine Commission, and who has gone back there—Taft, the most\r\nbrilliant graduate of his year at Yale, the youngest Yale man upon\r\nwhom Yale ever conferred a degree of LL.D., a man who, having won\r\nhigh position at the bar, and then served as Solicitor-General at\r\nWashington, was appointed to the United States bench. He was then\r\nasked to sacrifice himself, to give up his position in order to go\r\nto the other side of the world to take up an infinitely difficult,\r\nan infinitely dangerous problem, and do his best to solve it. He has\r\ndone his best. He came back here the other day. The man has always\r\nhad the honorable ambition to get upon the Supreme Court, and he knew\r\nthat I had always hoped that he would be put on the Supreme Court,\r\nand when he was back here a few months ago, and there was a question\r\nof a vacancy arising, I said to him: “Governor, I think I ought to\r\ntell you that if a vacancy comes in the Supreme Court” (which I knew\r\nwould put him for life in a position which he would especially like\r\nto have), “I do not see how I could possibly give it to you, for I\r\nneed you where you are.” He said to me: “Mr. President, it has always\r\nbeen my ambition to be on the Supreme Court, but if you should offer\r\nme a justiceship now, and at the same time Congress should take away\r\nentirely my salary as Governor, I should go straight back to the\r\nPhilippines, nevertheless, for those people need me, and expect me\r\nback, and believe I will not desert them.” He has gone back, gone back\r\nas a strong friend among weaker friends to help that people upward\r\nalong the difficult path of self-government. He has gone to do his\r\npart—and a great part—in making the American name a symbol of honor\r\nand good faith in the Philippine Islands; to govern with justice, and\r\nwith that firmness, that absence of weakness, which is only another\r\nside of justice. He has gone back to do all of that because it is his\r\nduty as he sees it. We are to be congratulated, we Americans, that we\r\nhave a fellow-American like Taft.\r\n\r\nAnd now Elihu Root, who, unlike myself, Mr. President Eliot, but\r\nlike most of you present, comes of the old New England stock, whose\r\ngreat-grandfather stood beside Leonard Wood’s great-grandfather\r\namong the “embattled farmers” at Concord Bridge; Elihu Root, who had\r\nworked his way up from being a poor and unknown country boy in New\r\nYork, to the leadership of the bar of the great city—he gave it up,\r\nmade the very great pecuniary sacrifice implied in giving it up, and\r\naccepted the position of Secretary of War, a position which, for\r\nthe last three years and at present amounts to being not only the\r\nSecretary of War, but the Secretary for the islands, the Secretary\r\nfor the colonies at the same time. He has done the most exhausting\r\nand the most responsible work of any man in the administration, more\r\nexhausting and more responsible work than the work of the President,\r\nbecause circumstances have been such that with a man of Root’s\r\nwonderful ability, wonderful industry and wonderful conscientiousness,\r\nthe President could not help but devolve upon him work that made\r\nhis task one under which almost any other man would have staggered.\r\nHe has done all this absolutely, disinterestedly. Nothing can come\r\nto Root in the way of reward save the reward that is implied in the\r\nknowledge that he has done something of incalculable importance which\r\nhardly another man in the Union—no other man that I know of—could\r\nhave done as well as he has done it. He has before him continually\r\nquestions of the utmost intricacy to decide, questions upon which\r\nlife and death hang, questions the decision of which will affect our\r\nwhole future world policy, questions which affect the welfare of the\r\nmillions of people with whom we have been brought into such intimate\r\ncontact by the events of the Spanish War, whose welfare must be a\r\nprime consideration from now on with every American public man worthy\r\nto serve his country. Root has done this work with the certainty of\r\nattack, with the certainty of misunderstanding, with the certainty of\r\nbeing hampered by ignorance (and worse than ignorance). And yet he has\r\ncreated, not for himself but for the nation also, a wonderful triumph\r\nfrom all these adverse forces.\r\n\r\nThose three men have rendered inestimable service to the American\r\npeople. I can do nothing for them. I can show my appreciation of them\r\nin no way save the wholly insufficient one of standing up for them,\r\nand for their work; and that I will do as long as I have tongue to\r\nspeak!\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE COLISEUM, HARTFORD, CONN., AUGUST 22, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman, and you, my Fellow-Americans, men and women of\r\n  Hartford_:\r\n\r\nI thank you, Senator Platt; through you I thank the State of\r\nConnecticut; Mayor Sullivan, through you I thank the city of Hartford\r\nfor the greeting extended to me.\r\n\r\nBefore beginning the speech that I had intended, and still intend,\r\nto make to you to-night, I wish to allude to an incident that\r\nhappened this afternoon. In being driven around your beautiful city,\r\nI was taken through Pope Park, and stopped at a platform where I\r\nwas presented with a great horseshoe of flowers, the gift of the\r\nworkingmen of Hartford to the President of the United States. In\r\nFather Sullivan’s speech he laid primary stress upon the fact that it\r\nwas a gift of welcome from the wage-workers, upon whom ultimately this\r\ngovernment depends. And he coupled the words of giving with certain\r\nsentences in which he expressed his belief that I would do all that\r\nI could to show myself a good representative of the wage-workers. I\r\nshould be utterly unfit for the position that I occupy if I failed\r\nto do all that in me lies to act, as light is given me to act, so as\r\nto represent the best thought and purpose of the wage-worker of the\r\nUnited States. At the outset of the twentieth century we are facing\r\ndifficult and complex problems—problems social and economic—which\r\nwill tax the best energies of all of us to solve aright, and which\r\nwe can only solve at all if we approach them in a spirit not merely\r\nof common-sense, but of generous desire to act each for all and all\r\nfor each. While there are occasions when through legislative or\r\nadministrative action the governmental representatives of the people\r\ncan do especial service to one set of our citizens, yet I think you\r\nwill agree with me that in the long run the best way in which to\r\nserve any one set of our citizens is to try to serve all alike well,\r\nto try to act in a spirit of fairness and justice to all—to give to\r\neach man his rights—to safeguard each man in his rights; and so far as\r\nin me lies, while I hold my present position I will be true to that\r\nconception of my duty.\r\n\r\nI want to speak to you to-night, not on our internal problems as a\r\nnation, but on some of the external problems which we have had to\r\nface during the last four years. The internal problems are the most\r\nimportant. Keeping our own household straight is our first duty; but\r\nwe have other duties. Just exactly as each man who is worth his salt\r\nmust first of all be a good husband, a good father, a good bread\r\nwinner, a good man of business, and yet must in addition to that be\r\na good citizen for the State at large—so a nation must first take\r\ncare to do well its duties within its own borders, but must not make\r\nof that fact an excuse for failing to do those of its duties the\r\nperformance of which lies without its own borders.\r\n\r\nThe events of the last few years have forced the American Republic to\r\ntake a larger position in the world than ever before, and therefore\r\nmore than ever to concern itself with questions of policy coming\r\nwithout its own borders. As a people we have new duties and new\r\nopportunities both in the tropical seas and islands south of us and in\r\nthe furthest Orient. Much depends upon the way in which we meet those\r\nduties, the way in which we take advantage of those opportunities. And\r\nremember this, you never can meet any duty, and after you have met it\r\nsay that your action only affected that duty. If you meet it well you\r\nface the next duty a stronger man, and if you meet it ill you face\r\nyour next duty a weaker man.\r\n\r\nFrom the days of Monroe, Clay and the younger Adams, we as a people\r\nhave always looked with peculiar interest upon the West Indies and\r\nthe isthmus connecting North and South America, feeling that whatever\r\nhappened there was of particular moment to this nation; and there\r\nis better reason for that feeling now than ever before. The outcome\r\nof the Spanish War put us in possession of Porto Rico, and brought\r\nus into peculiarly close touch with Cuba; while the successful\r\nnegotiation of the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty, and the legislation\r\nfollowing it, at last cleared the way for the construction of the\r\nIsthmian Canal. Porto Rico, it is a pleasure to say, may now serve\r\nas an example of the best methods of administering our insular\r\npossessions. Sometimes we have to learn by experience what to avoid.\r\nIt is much pleasanter when one can turn to an experience for the\r\npurpose of learning what to follow; and the last is true of our\r\nexperience in Porto Rico. So excellent has been the administration\r\nof the island, so excellent the effect of the legislation concerning\r\nit, that their very excellence has caused most of us to forget all\r\nabout it. There is no opportunity for headlines about Porto Rico.\r\nYou don’t need to use large letters in order to say that Porto Rico\r\ncontinues quiet and prosperous. There is hardly a ripple of failure\r\nupon the stream of our success there; and as we don’t have to think of\r\nremedies, we follow our usual custom in these matters, and don’t think\r\nof it at all.\r\n\r\nHow have we brought that about? First and foremost, in Porto Rico\r\nwe have consistently striven to get the very best men to administer\r\nthe affairs of the island. It is desirable throughout our public\r\nservice to secure a high standard of efficiency and integrity. But\r\nafter all, here at home we ourselves always have in our own hands\r\nthe remedy whereby to supply any deficiency in integrity or capacity\r\namong those that govern us. That is a fact that seems to have been\r\nforgotten, but it is a fact. In a far-off island things are different.\r\nThere wrongdoing is more easy and those that suffer from it are more\r\nhelpless; while there is less efficient check in the way of that\r\npublic opinion to which public men are sensitive. In consequence,\r\nthe administration of those islands is beyond all other kinds of\r\nadministration under our government the one in which the highest\r\nstandard must be demanded. In making appointments to the insular\r\nservice, the appointing power must feel all the time that he is\r\nacting for the country as a whole, in the interest of the good name\r\nof our people as a whole, and any question of mere party expediency\r\nmust be wholly swept aside, and the matter looked at solely from the\r\nstandpoint of the honor of our own nation and the welfare of the\r\nislands. We have gotten along so well in Porto Rico because we have\r\nacted up to that theory in choosing our men down there—governor,\r\ntreasurer, attorney-general, judges, superintendent of education—every\r\none. You will find among those men all the shades of different\r\npolitical opinion that we have here at home; but you will find them\r\nknit together by the purpose of administering the affairs of that\r\nisland on the highest plane of decency and efficiency.\r\n\r\nBesides acting in good faith, we have acted with good sense, and that\r\nis also important. We have not been frightened or misled into giving\r\nto the people of the island a form of government unsuitable to them.\r\nWhile providing that the people should govern themselves as far as\r\npossible, we have not hesitated in their own interests to keep the\r\npower of shaping their destiny.\r\n\r\nIn Cuba the problem was larger, more complicated, more difficult.\r\nHere again we kept our promise absolutely. After having delivered the\r\nisland from its oppressors, we refused to turn it loose offhand, with\r\nthe certainty that it would sink back into chaos and savagery. For\r\nover three years we administered it on a plane higher than it had\r\never reached before during the four hundred years that had elapsed\r\nsince the Spaniards first landed upon its shores. We brought moral\r\nand physical cleanliness into the government. We cleaned the cities\r\nfor the first time in their existence. We stamped out yellow fever—an\r\ninestimable boon not merely to Cuba, but to the people of the Southern\r\nStates as well. We established a school system. We made life and\r\nproperty secure, so that industry could again begin to thrive. Then\r\nwhen we had laid deep and broad the foundations upon which civil\r\nliberty and national independence must rest, we turned the island\r\nover to the hands of those whom its people had chosen as the founders\r\nof the new republic. It is a republic with which our own great\r\nRepublic must ever be closely knit by the ties of common interests\r\nand common inspirations. Cuba must always be peculiarly related to\r\nus in international politics. She must in international affairs be\r\nto a degree a part of our political system. In return she must have\r\npeculiar relations with us economically. She must be in a sense part\r\nof our economic system. We expect her to accept a political attitude\r\ntoward us which we think wisest both for her and for us. In return we\r\nmust be prepared to put her in an economic position as regards our\r\ntariff system which will give her some measure of the prosperity which\r\nwe enjoy. We can not, in my judgment, avoid taking this attitude if we\r\nare to persevere in the course which we have outlined for ourselves\r\nas a nation during the past four years; and therefore I believe that\r\nit is only a matter of time—and I trust only a matter of a very short\r\ntime—before we enter into reciprocal trade relations with Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe Isthmian Canal is to be one of the greatest, probably the\r\ngreatest, engineering feat of the 20th century; and I am glad it\r\nis to be done by America. We must take care that it is done under\r\nthe best conditions and by the best Americans. There are certain\r\npreliminary matters to settle. When this has been done, the first\r\nquestion will come upon choosing the commission which is to supervise\r\nthe building of the canal. And but one thought here is permissible—how\r\nto get the very best men of the highest engineering and business\r\nand administrative skill, who will consent to undertake the work.\r\nIf possible, I wish to see those men represent different sections\r\nand different political parties. But those questions are secondary.\r\nThe primary aim must be to get men who, though able to control much\r\ngreater salaries than the nation is able to pay, nevertheless possess\r\nthe patriotism and the healthy ambition which will make them put their\r\ntalents at the government’s service.\r\n\r\nSo much for what has been done in the Occident. In the Orient the\r\nlabor was more difficult.\r\n\r\nIt is rare indeed that a great work, a work supremely worth doing,\r\ncan be done save at the cost not only of labor and toil, but of much\r\npuzzling worry during the time of the performance. Normally, the\r\nnation that achieves greatness, like the individual who achieves\r\ngreatness, can do so only at the cost of anxiety and bewilderment and\r\nheart-wearing effort. Timid people, people scant of faith and hope,\r\nand good people who are not accustomed to the roughness of the life\r\nof effort—are almost sure to be disheartened and dismayed by the work\r\nand the worry, and overmuch cast down by the shortcomings, actual or\r\nseeming, which in real life always accompany the first stages even of\r\nwhat eventually turn out to be the most brilliant victories.\r\n\r\nAll this is true of what has happened during the last four years in\r\nthe Philippine Islands. The Spanish War itself was an easy task, but\r\nit left us certain other tasks which were much more difficult. One of\r\nthese tasks was that of dealing with the Philippines. The easy thing\r\nto do—the thing which appealed not only to lazy and selfish men, but\r\nto very many good men whose thought did not drive down to the root of\r\nthings—was to leave the islands. Had we done this, a period of wild\r\nchaos would have supervened, and then some stronger power would have\r\nstepped in and seized the islands and have taken up the task which we\r\nin such a case would have flinched from performing. A less easy, but\r\ninfinitely more absurd course, would have been to leave the islands\r\nourselves, and at the same time to assert that we would not permit any\r\none else to interfere with them. This particular course would have\r\ncombined all the possible disadvantages of every other course which\r\nwas advocated. It would have placed us in a humiliating position,\r\nbecause when the actual test came it would have been quite out of the\r\nquestion for us, after some striking deed of savagery had occurred in\r\nthe islands, to stand by and prevent the re-entry of civilization into\r\nthem. While the mere fact of our having threatened thus to guarantee\r\nthe local tyrants and wrongdoers against outside interference by\r\nourselves or others, would have put a premium upon every species of\r\ntyranny and anarchy within the islands.\r\n\r\nFinally, there was the course which we adopted—not an easy course,\r\nand one fraught with danger and difficulty, as is generally the\r\ncase in this world when some great feat is to be accomplished as\r\nan incident to working out national destiny. We made up our minds\r\nto stay in the islands—to put down violence—to establish peace and\r\norder—and then to introduce a just and wise civil rule accompanied\r\nby a measure of self-government which should increase as rapidly\r\nas the islanders showed themselves fit for it. It was certainly a\r\nformidable task; but think of the marvelously successful way in which\r\nit has been accomplished! The first and vitally important feat was\r\nthe establishment of the supremacy of the American flag; and this\r\nhad to be done by the effort of these gallant fellow-Americans of\r\nours to whom so great a debt is due—the officers and enlisted men of\r\nthe United States regular and volunteer forces. In a succession of\r\ncampaigns, carried on in unknown tropic jungles against an elusive\r\nand treacherous foe vastly outnumbering them, under the most adverse\r\nconditions of climate, weather, and country, our troops completely\r\nbroke the power of the insurgents, smashed their armies, and harried\r\nthe broken robber bands into submission. In its last stages, the war\r\nagainst our rule sank into mere brigandage; and what our troops had\r\nto do was to hunt down the parties of ladrones. It was not an easy\r\ntask which it was humanly possible to accomplish in a month or a year;\r\nand therefore after the first month and the first year had elapsed,\r\nsome excellent people said that it couldn’t be done; but it was done.\r\nMonth by month, year by year, with unwearied and patient resolution,\r\nour army in the Philippines did the task which it found ready at hand\r\nuntil the last vestige of organized insurrection was stamped out. I\r\ndo not refer to the Moros, with whom we have exercised the utmost\r\nforbearance, but who may force us to chastise them if they persist in\r\nattacking our troops. We will do everything possible to avoid having\r\ntrouble with them, but if they insist upon it it will come. Among the\r\nFilipinos proper, however, peace has come. Doubtless here and there\r\nsporadic outbreaks of brigandage will occur from time to time, but\r\norganized warfare against the American flag has ceased, and there is\r\nno reason to apprehend its recurrence. Our army in the islands has\r\nbeen reduced until it is not a fourth of what it was at the time the\r\noutbreak was at its height.\r\n\r\nStep by step as the army conquered, the rule of the military was\r\nsupplanted by the rule of the civil authorities—the soldier was\r\nsucceeded by the civilian magistrate. The utmost care has been\r\nexercised in choosing the best type of Americans for the high civil\r\npositions, and the actual work of administration has been done, so\r\nfar as possible, by native Filipino officials serving under these\r\nAmericans. The success of the effort has been wonderful. Never\r\nhas this country had a more upright or an abler body of public\r\nrepresentatives than Governor Taft, Vice-Governor Wright, and their\r\nassociates and subordinates in the Philippine Islands. It is a very\r\ndifficult matter, practically, to apply the principles of an orderly\r\nfree government to an Oriental people struggling upward out of\r\nbarbarism and subjection. It is a task requiring infinite firmness,\r\npatience, tact, broadmindedness. All these qualities, and the\r\ncountless others necessary, have been found in the civil and military\r\nofficials who have been sent over to administer the islands. It was,\r\nof course, inevitable that there should be occasional failures;\r\nbut it is astonishing how few these have been. Here and there the\r\ncivil government which had been established in a given district had\r\nto be temporarily withdrawn because of some outbreak. Let me give\r\nyou an idea of some of the difficulties. We have been trying to put\r\ninto effect the principle of a popular choice of representative. In\r\none district it proved to be wholly impossible to make the people\r\nunderstand how to vote. Finally they took a little hill, and put two\r\ncandidates, one on one side and one on the other, and made the people\r\nwalk up and stand by the candidate they wanted.\r\n\r\nBut at last, on the July 4th that has just passed—on the 126th\r\nanniversary of our independence—it was possible at the same time to\r\ndeclare amnesty throughout the islands and definitely to establish\r\ncivil rule over all of them, excepting the country of the Mohammedan\r\nMoros, where the conditions were wholly different. Each inhabitant\r\nof the Philippines is now guaranteed his civil and religious rights,\r\nhis rights to life, personal liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\r\nsubject only to not infringing the rights of others. It is worth\r\nnoting that during these three or four years under us the Philippine\r\npeople have attained to a greater degree of self-government, that they\r\nnow have more to say as to how they shall be governed, than is the\r\ncase with any people in the Orient which is under European rule. Nor\r\nis this all. Congress has, with far-seeing wisdom, heartily supported\r\nall that has been done by the Executive. Wise laws for the government\r\nof the Philippine Islands have been placed upon the statute books,\r\nand under those laws provision is made for the introduction into\r\nthe Philippines of representative government, with only the delay\r\nabsolutely necessary to allow for the establishment of definite peace,\r\nfor the taking of a census, and the settling down of the country. In\r\nshort, we are governing the Filipinos primarily in their interest,\r\nand for their very great benefit. And we have acted in practical\r\nfashion—not trying to lay down rules as to what should be done in the\r\nremote and uncertain future, but turning our attention to the instant\r\nneed of things and meeting that need in the fullest and amplest way.\r\nIt would be hard to say whether we owe most to our military or our\r\ncivil representatives in the Philippines. The soldiers have shown\r\nsplendid gallantry in the field; and they have done no less admirable\r\nwork in preparing the provinces for civil government. The civil\r\nauthorities have shown the utmost wisdom in doing a very difficult and\r\nimportant work, of vast extent. It would be hard to find in modern\r\ntimes a better example of successful constructive statesmanship than\r\nthe American representatives have given to the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, as in Cuba, the instances of wrongdoing among\r\neither our civil or military representatives have been astonishingly\r\nfew; and punishment has been meted with even-handed justice to all\r\noffenders.\r\n\r\nNor should it be forgotten that while we have thus acted in the\r\ninterest of the islanders themselves, we have also helped our own\r\npeople. Our interests are as great in the Pacific as in the Atlantic.\r\nThe welfare of California, Oregon, and Washington is as vital to\r\nthe nation as the welfare of New England, New York, and the South\r\nAtlantic States. The awakening of the Orient means very much to all\r\nthe nations of Christendom, commercially no less than politically;\r\nand it would be short-sighted statesmanship on our part to refuse to\r\ntake the necessary steps for securing a proper share to our people of\r\nthis commercial future. The possession of the Philippines has helped\r\nus, as the securing of the open door in China has helped us. Already\r\nthe government has taken the necessary steps to provide for the\r\nlaying of a Pacific cable under conditions which safeguard absolutely\r\nthe interests of the American public. Our commerce with the East is\r\ngrowing rapidly. Events have abundantly justified, alike from the\r\nmoral and material standpoint, all that we have done in the Far East\r\nas a sequel to our war with Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT PROVIDENCE, R. I., AUGUST 23, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Governor, and you, my Fellow-citizens_:\r\n\r\nWe are passing through a period of great commercial prosperity, and\r\nsuch a period is as sure as adversity itself to bring mutterings of\r\ndiscontent. At a time when most men prosper somewhat some men always\r\nprosper greatly; and it is as true now as when the tower of Siloam\r\nfell upon all alike, that good fortune does not come solely to the\r\njust, nor bad fortune solely to the unjust. When the weather is good\r\nfor crops it is good for weeds. Moreover, not only do the wicked\r\nflourish when the times are such that most men flourish, but, what is\r\nworse, the spirit of envy and jealousy springs up in the breasts of\r\nthose who, though they may be doing fairly well themselves, see others\r\nno more deserving who do better.\r\n\r\nWise laws and fearless and upright administration of the laws can\r\ngive the opportunity for such prosperity as we see about us. But that\r\nis all that they can do. When the conditions have been created which\r\nmake prosperity possible, then each individual man must achieve it for\r\nhimself by his own energy and thrift and business intelligence. If\r\nwhen people wax fat they kick, as they have kicked since the days of\r\nJeshurun, they will speedily destroy their own prosperity. If they go\r\ninto wild speculation and lose their heads they have lost that which\r\nno laws can supply. If in a spirit of sullen envy they insist upon\r\npulling down those who have profited most in the years of fatness,\r\nthey will bury themselves in the crash of the common disaster. It is\r\ndifficult to make our material condition better by the best laws, but\r\nit is easy enough to ruin it by bad laws.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of all this is that it is peculiarly incumbent upon us in\r\na time of such material well-being, both collectively as a nation and\r\nindividually as citizens, to show, each on his own account, that we\r\npossess the qualities of prudence, self-knowledge, and self-restraint.\r\nIn our government we need above all things stability, fixity of\r\neconomic policy; while remembering that this fixity must not be\r\nfossilization, that there must not be inability to shift our laws so\r\nas to meet our shifting national needs. There are real and great evils\r\nin our social and economic life, and these evils stand out in all\r\ntheir ugly baldness in time of prosperity; for the wicked who prosper\r\nare never a pleasant sight. There is every need of striving in all\r\npossible ways, individually and collectively, by combinations among\r\nourselves and through the recognized governmental agencies, to cut out\r\nthose evils. All I ask is to be sure that we do not use the knife with\r\nan ignorant zeal which would make it more dangerous to the patient\r\nthan to the disease.\r\n\r\nOne of the features of the tremendous industrial development of the\r\nlast generation has been the very great increase in private, and\r\nespecially in corporate, fortunes. We may like this or not, just as\r\nwe choose, but it is a fact nevertheless; and as far as we can see\r\nit is an inevitable result of the working of the various causes,\r\nprominent among them steam and electricity. Urban population has grown\r\nin this country, as in all civilized countries, much faster than the\r\npopulation as a whole during the last century. If it were not for\r\nthat Rhode Island could not to-day be the State she is. Rhode Island\r\nhas flourished as she has flourished because of the conditions which\r\nhave brought about the great increase in urban life. There is evil\r\nin these conditions, but you can’t destroy it unless you destroy the\r\ncivilization they have brought about. Where men are gathered together\r\nin great masses it inevitably results that they must work far more\r\nlargely through combinations than where they live scattered and remote\r\nfrom one another. Many of us prefer the old conditions of life, under\r\nwhich the average man lived more to himself and by himself, where the\r\naverage community was more self-dependent, and where even though the\r\nstandard of comfort was lower on the average, yet there was less of\r\nthe glaring inequality in worldly conditions which we now see about us\r\nin our great cities. It is not true that the poor have grown poorer;\r\nbut some of the rich have grown so very much richer that, where\r\nmultitudes of men are herded together in a limited space, the contrast\r\nstrikes the onlooker as more violent than formerly. On the whole, our\r\npeople earn more and live better than ever before, and the progress\r\nof which we are so proud could not have taken place had it not been\r\nfor the upbuilding of industrial centres, such as this in which I am\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\nBut together with the good there has come a measure of evil. Life is\r\nnot so simple as it was; and surely, both for the individual and the\r\ncommunity, the simple life is normally the healthy life. There is not\r\nin the great cities the feeling of brotherhood which there is still\r\nin country localities; and the lines of social cleavage are far more\r\ndeeply marked.\r\n\r\nFor some of the evils which have attended upon the good of the\r\nchanged conditions we can at present see no complete remedy. For\r\nothers the remedy must come by the action of men themselves in their\r\nprivate capacity, whether merely as individuals or by combination.\r\nFor yet others some remedy can be found in legislative and executive\r\naction—national, State, or municipal. Much of the complaint against\r\ncombinations is entirely unwarranted. Under present day conditions it\r\nis as necessary to have corporations in the business world as it is\r\nto have organizations, unions, among wage-workers. We have a right to\r\nask in each case only this: that good, and not harm, shall follow.\r\nExactly as labor organizations, when managed intelligently and in a\r\nspirit of justice and fair play, are of very great service not only\r\nto the wage-workers, but to the whole community, as has been shown\r\nagain and again in the history of many such organizations; so wealth,\r\nnot merely individual, but corporate, when used aright is not merely\r\nbeneficial to the community as a whole, but is absolutely essential to\r\nthe upbuilding of such a series of communities as those whose citizens\r\nI am now addressing. This is so obvious that it ought to be too trite\r\nto mention, and yet it is necessary to mention it when we see some of\r\nthe attacks made upon wealth, as such.\r\n\r\nOf course a great fortune if used wrongly is a menace to the\r\ncommunity. A man of great wealth who does not use that wealth decently\r\nis, in a peculiar sense, a menace to the community, and so is the man\r\nwho does not use his intellect aright. Each talent—the talent for\r\nmaking money, the talent for showing intellect at the bar, or in any\r\nother way—if unaccompanied by character, makes the possessor a menace\r\nto the community. But such a fact no more warrants us in attacking\r\nwealth than it does in attacking intellect. Every man of power, by the\r\nvery fact of that power, is capable of doing damage to his neighbors;\r\nbut we can not afford to discourage the development of such men merely\r\nbecause it is possible they may use their power for wrong ends. If\r\nwe did so we should leave our history a blank, for we should have\r\nno great statesmen, soldiers, merchants, no great men of arts, of\r\nletters, of science. Doubtless on the average the most useful citizen\r\nto the community as a whole is the man to whom has been granted what\r\nthe Psalmist asked for—neither poverty nor riches. But the great\r\ncaptain of industry, the man of wealth, who, alone or in combination\r\nwith his fellows, drives through our great business enterprises, is a\r\nfactor without whom the civilization that we see round about us here\r\ncould not have been built up. Good, not harm, normally comes from the\r\nupbuilding of such wealth. Probably the greatest harm done by vast\r\nwealth is the harm that we of moderate means do ourselves when we let\r\nthe vices of envy and hatred enter deep into our own natures.\r\n\r\nBut there is other harm; and it is evident that we should try to do\r\naway with that. The great corporations which we have grown to speak\r\nof rather loosely as trusts are the creatures of the State, and the\r\nState not only has the right to control them, but it is in duty bound\r\nto control them wherever the need of such control is shown. There is\r\nclearly need of supervision—need to possess the power of regulation\r\nof these great corporations through the representatives of the\r\npublic—wherever, as in our own country at the present time, business\r\ncorporations become so very powerful alike for beneficent work and for\r\nwork that is not always beneficent. It is idle to say that there is no\r\nneed for such supervision. There is, and a sufficient warrant for it\r\nis to be found in any one of the admitted evils appertaining to them.\r\n\r\nWe meet a peculiar difficulty under our system of government, because\r\nof the division of governmental power between the Nation and the\r\nStates. When the industrial conditions were simple, very little\r\ncontrol was needed, and the difficulties of exercising such control\r\nunder our Constitution were not evident. Now the conditions are\r\ncomplicated and we find it hard to frame national legislation which\r\nshall be adequate; while as a matter of practical experience it has\r\nbeen shown that the States either can not or will not exercise a\r\nsufficient control to meet the needs of the case. Some of our States\r\nhave excellent laws—laws which it would be well indeed to have enacted\r\nby the National Legislature. But the widespread differences in these\r\nlaws, even between adjacent States, and the uncertainty of the power\r\nof enforcement, result practically in altogether insufficient control.\r\nI believe that the nation must assume this power of control by\r\nlegislation; if necessary by constitutional amendment. The immediate\r\nnecessity in dealing with trusts is to place them under the real, not\r\nthe nominal, control of some sovereign to which, as its creatures,\r\nthe trusts shall owe allegiance, and in whose courts the sovereign’s\r\norders may be enforced.\r\n\r\nThis is not the case with the ordinary so-called “trust” to-day; for\r\nthe trust nowadays is a large State corporation, which generally does\r\nbusiness in other States, often with a tendency toward monopoly.\r\nSuch a trust is an artificial creature not wholly responsible to\r\nor controllable by any legislation, either by State or nation, and\r\nnot subject to the jurisdiction of any one court. Some governmental\r\nsovereign must be given full power over these artificial, and very\r\npowerful, corporate beings. In my judgment this sovereign must be the\r\nnational government. When it has been given full power, then this\r\nfull power can be used to control any evil influence, exactly as the\r\ngovernment is now using the power conferred upon it by the Sherman\r\nanti-trust law.\r\n\r\nEven when the power has been granted it would be most unwise to\r\nexercise it too much, to begin by too stringent legislation. The\r\nmechanism of modern business is as delicate and complicated as it\r\nis vast, and nothing would be more productive of evil to all of us,\r\nand especially to those least well off in this world’s goods, than\r\nignorant meddling with this mechanism—above all, meddling in a spirit\r\nof class legislation or hatred or rancor. It is eminently necessary\r\nthat the power should be had, but it is just as necessary that it\r\nshould be exercised with wisdom and self-restraint. The first exercise\r\nof that power should be the securing of publicity among all great\r\ncorporations doing an interstate business. The publicity, though\r\nnon-inquisitorial, should be real and thorough as to all important\r\nfacts with which the public has concern. Daylight is a powerful\r\ndiscourager of evil. Such publicity would by itself tend to cure the\r\nevils of which there is just complaint; it would show us if evils\r\nexisted, and where the evils are imaginary, and it would show us what\r\nnext ought to be done.\r\n\r\nAbove all, let us remember that our success in accomplishing anything\r\ndepends very much upon our not trying to accomplish everything.\r\nDistrust whoever pretends to offer you a patent cure-all for every ill\r\nof the body politic, just as you would a man who offers a medicine\r\nwhich would cure every evil of your individual body. A medicine that\r\nis recommended to cure both asthma and a broken leg is not good for\r\neither. Mankind has moved slowly upward through the ages, sometimes a\r\nlittle faster, sometimes a little slower, but rarely indeed by leaps\r\nand bounds. At times a great crisis comes in which a great people,\r\nperchance led by a great man, can at white heat strike some mighty\r\nblow for the right—make a long stride in advance along the path of\r\njustice and of orderly liberty. But normally we must be content if\r\neach of us can do something—not all that we wish, but something—for\r\nthe advancement of those principles of righteousness which underlie\r\nall real national greatness, all true civilization and freedom. I see\r\nno promise of any immediate and complete solution of all the problems\r\nwe group together when we speak of the trust question. But we can\r\nmake a beginning in solving these problems, and a good beginning,\r\nif only we approach the subject with a sufficiency of resolution,\r\nof honesty, and of that hard common-sense which is one of the most\r\nvaluable, and not always one of the most common, assets in any\r\nnation’s greatness. The existing laws will be fully enforced as they\r\nstand on the statute books without regard to persons, and I think good\r\nhas already come from their enforcement. I think, furthermore, that\r\nadditional legislation should be had and can be had, which will enable\r\nus to accomplish much more along the same lines. No man can promise a\r\nperfect solution, at least in the immediate future. But something has\r\nalready been done, and much more can be done if our people temperately\r\nand determinedly will that it shall be done.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion let me add one word. While we are not to be excused if\r\nwe fail to do whatever is possible through the agency of government,\r\nwe must keep ever in mind that no action of the government, no action\r\nby combination among ourselves, can take the place of the individual\r\nqualities to which in the long run every man must owe the success he\r\ncan make of life. There never has been devised, and there never will\r\nbe devised, any law which will enable a man to succeed save by the\r\nexercise of those qualities which have always been the prerequisites\r\nof success—the qualities of hard work, of keen intelligence, of\r\nunflinching will. Such action can supplement those qualities but it\r\ncan not take their place. No action by the State can do more than\r\nsupplement the initiative of the individual; and ordinarily the action\r\nof the State can do no more than to secure to each individual the\r\nchance to show under as favorable conditions as possible the stuff\r\nthat there is in him.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT SYMPHONY HALL, BOSTON, AUGUST 25, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Governor Crane, Mayor Collins, men and women of Boston_:\r\n\r\nI want to take up this evening the general question of our economic\r\nand social relations, with specific reference to that problem with\r\nwhich I think our people are now greatly concerning themselves—the\r\nproblem of our complex social condition as intensified by the\r\nexistence of the great corporations which we rather loosely designate\r\nas trusts. I have not come here to say that I have discovered a patent\r\ncure-all for any evils. When people’s minds are greatly agitated on\r\nany subject, and especially when they feel deeply but rather vaguely\r\nthat conditions are not right, it is far pleasanter in addressing them\r\nto be indifferent as to what you promise; but it is much less pleasant\r\nafterward when you come to try to carry out what has been promised. Of\r\ncourse the worth of a promise consists purely in the way in which the\r\nperformance squares with it. That has two sides. In the first place,\r\nif a man is an honest man he will try just as hard to keep a promise\r\nmade on the stump as one made off the stump. In the second place, if\r\nthe people keep their heads they won’t wish promises to be made which\r\nare impossible of performance. You see, one side of that question\r\nrepresents my duty, and the other side yours.\r\n\r\nMankind goes ahead but slowly, and it goes ahead mainly through each\r\nof us trying to do the best that is in him and to do it in the sanest\r\nway. We have founded our Republic upon the theory that the average\r\nman will as a rule do the right thing, that in the long run the\r\nmajority will decide for what is sane and wholesome. If our fathers\r\nwere mistaken in that theory, if ever the times become such—not\r\noccasionally but persistently—that the mass of the people do what\r\nis unwholesome, what is wrong, then the Republic can not stand, I\r\ncare not how good its laws, I care not what marvelous mechanism its\r\nConstitution may embody. Back of the laws, back of the administration,\r\nback of the system of government lies the man, lies the average\r\nmanhood of our people, and in the long run we are going to go up or go\r\ndown accordingly as the average standard of our citizenship does or\r\ndoes not wax in growth and grace.\r\n\r\nThe first requisite of good citizenship is that the man shall do the\r\nhomely, every-day, humdrum duties well. A man is not a good citizen,\r\nI do not care how lofty his thoughts are about citizenship in the\r\nabstract, if in the concrete his actions do not bear them out; and it\r\ndoes not make much difference how high his aspirations for mankind\r\nat large may be, if he does not behave well in his own family those\r\naspirations do not bear visible fruit. He must be a good bread-winner,\r\nhe must take care of his wife and his children, he must be a neighbor\r\nwhom his neighbors can trust, he must act squarely in his business\r\nrelations,—he must do all those every-day ordinary duties first,\r\nor he is not a good citizen. But he must do more. In this country\r\nof ours the average citizen must devote a good deal of thought and\r\ntime to the affairs of the State as a whole or those affairs will go\r\nbackward; and he must devote that thought and that time steadily and\r\nintelligently. If there is any one quality that is not admirable,\r\nwhether in a nation or in an individual, it is hysterics, either in\r\nreligion or in anything else. The man or woman who makes up for ten\r\ndays’ indifference to duty by an eleventh-day morbid repentance about\r\nthat duty is of scant use in the world. Now in the same way it is of\r\nno possible use to decline to go through all the ordinary duties of\r\ncitizenship for a long space of time and then suddenly to get up and\r\nfeel very angry about something or somebody, not clearly defined, and\r\ndemand reform, as if it were a concrete substance to be handed out\r\nforthwith.\r\n\r\nThis is preliminary to what I want to say to you about the whole\r\nquestion of great corporations as affecting the public. There are\r\nvery many and very difficult problems with which we are faced as\r\nthe results of the forces which have been in play for more than the\r\nlifetime of a generation. It is worse than useless for any of us to\r\nrail at or regret the great growth of our industrial civilization\r\nduring the last half century. Speaking academically, we can,\r\naccording to our several temperaments, regret that the old days with\r\nthe old life have vanished, or not, just as we choose; but we are here\r\nto-night only because of the play of those great forces. There is but\r\nlittle use in regretting that things have been shaping themselves\r\ndifferently from what we might have preferred. The practical thing to\r\ndo is to face the conditions as they are and see if we can not get the\r\nbest there is in them out of them. Now we shall not get a complete or\r\nperfect solution for all of the evils attendant upon the development\r\nof the trusts by any single action on our part. A good many actions\r\nin a good many different ways will be required before we get many\r\nof those evils even partially remedied. We must first of all think\r\nclearly; we must probably experiment somewhat; we must above all show\r\nby our actions that our interest is permanent and not spasmodic; and\r\nwe must see that all proper steps are taken toward the solution. Now\r\nof course all this is perfectly trite. Every one who thinks knows\r\nthat the only way in which any problem of great importance was ever\r\nsuccessfully solved was by consistent and persistent effort toward a\r\ngiven end—effort that did not cease with any one election or with any\r\none year, but was continued steadily, temperately, but resolutely,\r\ntoward a given end. It is a little difficult to set clearly before\r\nus all of the evils attendant upon the working of some of our great\r\ncorporations, but I think that those gentlemen, and especially those\r\ngentlemen of large means, who deny that the evils exist are acting\r\nwith great folly. So far from being against property when I ask\r\nthat the question of the trusts be taken up, I am acting in the most\r\nconservative sense in property’s interest. When a great corporation\r\nis sued for violating the anti-trust law, it is not a move against\r\nproperty, it is a move in favor of property, because when we make it\r\nevident that all men, great and small alike, have to obey the law, we\r\nput the safeguard of the law around all men. When we make it evident\r\nthat no man shall be excused for violating the law, we make it evident\r\nthat every man will be protected from violations of the law.\r\n\r\nNow one of the great troubles—I am inclined to think much the greatest\r\ntrouble—in any immediate handling of the question of the trusts comes\r\nfrom our system of government. Under this system it is difficult to\r\nsay where the power is lodged to deal with these evils. Remember that\r\nI am not saying that even if we had all the power we could completely\r\nsolve the trust question. If what we read in the papers is true,\r\ninternational trusts are now being planned. It is going to be very\r\ndifficult for any set of laws on our part to deal completely with a\r\nproblem which becomes international in its bearings. But a great deal\r\ncan be done in various ways even now—a great deal is being done—and\r\na great deal more can be done, if we see that the power is lodged\r\nsomewhere to do it. On the whole, our system of government has worked\r\nmarvelously well—the system of divided functions of government, of\r\na scheme under which Maine, Louisiana, Oregon, Idaho, New York,\r\nIllinois, South Carolina, can all come together for certain purposes,\r\nand yet each be allowed to work out its salvation as it desires along\r\ncertain other lines. On the whole, this has worked well; but in some\r\nrespects it has worked ill. While I most firmly believe in fixity\r\nof policy, I do not believe that that policy should be fossilized,\r\nand when conditions change we must change our governmental methods\r\nto meet them. I believe with all my heart in the New England town\r\nmeeting, but you can’t work the New England town meeting in Boston—it\r\nis too big. You must devise something else. If you look back in the\r\nhistory of Boston you will find that Boston was very reluctant to\r\nadmit this particular truth for some time in the first decades of\r\nthe nineteenth century. When this government was founded there were\r\nno great individual or corporate fortunes, and commerce and industry\r\nwere being carried on very much as they had been carried on in the\r\ndays when Nineveh and Babylon stood in the Mesopotamian Valley.\r\nSails, oars, wheels—these were the instruments of commerce. The pack\r\ntrain, the wagon train, the rowboat, the sailing craft—these were\r\nthe methods of commerce. Everything has been revolutionized in the\r\nbusiness world since then, and the progress of civilization from\r\nbeing a dribble has become a torrent. There was no particular need\r\nat that time of bothering as to whether the nation or the State had\r\ncontrol of corporations. They were easy to control. Now, however, the\r\nexact reverse is the case. And remember when I say corporations I\r\ndo not mean merely trusts technically so-called, merely combinations\r\nof corporations, or corporations under certain peculiar conditions.\r\nFor instance, some time ago the Attorney-General took action against\r\na certain trust. There was considerable discussion as to whether\r\nthe trust aimed at would not seek to get out from under the law by\r\nbecoming a single corporation. Now, I want laws that will enable us to\r\ndeal with any evil no matter what shape it takes. I want to see the\r\ngovernment able to get at it definitely, so that the action of the\r\ngovernment can not be evaded by any turning within or without Federal\r\nor State statutes. At present we have really no efficient control\r\nover a big corporation which does business in more than one State.\r\nFrequently the corporation has nothing whatever to do with the State\r\nin which it is incorporated except to get incorporated; and all its\r\nbusiness may be done in entirely different communities—communities\r\nwhich may object very much to the methods of incorporation in the\r\nState named. I do not believe that you can get any action by any\r\nState, I do not believe it practicable to get action by all the\r\nStates that will give us satisfactory control of the trusts, of big\r\ncorporations; and the result is at present that we have a great,\r\npowerful, artificial creation which has no creator to which it is\r\nresponsible. The creator creates it and then it goes and operates\r\nsomewhere else; and there is no interest on the part of the creator to\r\ndeal with it. It does not do anything where the creator has power; it\r\noperates entirely outside of the creator’s jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIt is of course a mere truism to say that the corporation is the\r\ncreature of the State, that the State is sovereign. There should be\r\na real and not a nominal sovereign, some one sovereign to which the\r\ncorporation shall be really and not nominally responsible. At present\r\nif we pass laws nobody can tell whether they will amount to anything.\r\nThat has two bad effects. In the first place, the corporation becomes\r\nindifferent to the law-making body; and in the next place, the\r\nlaw-making body gets into that most pernicious custom of passing a law\r\nnot with reference to what will be done under it, but with reference\r\nto its effects upon the opinions of the voters. That is a bad thing.\r\nWhen any body of law-makers passes a law, not simply with reference\r\nto whether that law will do good or ill, but with the knowledge that\r\nnot much will come of it, and yet that perhaps the people as a whole\r\nwill like to see it on the statute books—it does not speak well for\r\nthe law-makers, and it does not speak well for the people, either.\r\nWhat I hope to see is power given to the National Legislature which\r\nshall make the control real. It would be an excellent thing if you\r\ncould have all the States act on somewhat similar lines so that\r\nyou would make it unnecessary for the national government to act;\r\nbut all of you know perfectly well that the States will not act on\r\nsimilar lines. No advance whatever has been made in the direction of\r\nintelligent dealing by the States as a collective body with these\r\ngreat corporations. Here in Massachusetts you have what I regard as,\r\non the whole, excellent corporation laws. Most of our difficulties\r\nwould be in a fair way of solution if we had the power to put upon the\r\nnational statute books, and did put upon them, laws for the nation\r\nmuch like those you have here on the subject of corporations in\r\nMassachusetts. So you can see, gentlemen, I am not advocating anything\r\nvery revolutionary. I am advocating action to prevent anything\r\nrevolutionary. Now, if we can get adequate control by the nation of\r\nthese great corporations, then we can pass legislation which will\r\ngive us the power of regulation and supervision over them. If the\r\nnation had that power, mind you, I should advocate as strenuously as\r\nI know how that the power should be exercised with extreme caution\r\nand self-restraint. No good will come from plunging in without having\r\nlooked carefully ahead. The first thing we want is publicity; and I\r\ndo not mean publicity as a favor by some corporations—I mean it as a\r\nright from all corporations affected by the law. I want publicity as\r\nto the essential facts in which the public has an interest. I want the\r\nknowledge given to the accredited representatives of the people of\r\nfacts upon which those representatives can if they see fit base their\r\nactions later. The publicity itself would cure many evils. The light\r\nof day is a great deterrer of wrongdoing. The mere fact of being able\r\nto put out nakedly, and with the certainty that the statements were\r\ntrue, a given condition of things that was wrong, would go a long\r\ndistance toward curing that wrong; and, even where it did not cure\r\nit, would make the path evident by which to cure it. We would not be\r\nleaping in the dark; we would not be striving blindly to see what was\r\ngood and what bad. We would know what the facts were and be able to\r\nshape our course accordingly.\r\n\r\nA good deal can be done now, a good deal is being done now. As far\r\nas the anti-trust laws go they will be enforced. No suit will be\r\nundertaken for the sake of seeming to undertake it. Every suit that\r\nis undertaken will be begun because the great lawyer and upright man\r\nwhom we are fortunate enough to have as Attorney-General, Mr. Knox,\r\nbelieves that there is a violation of the law which we can get at; and\r\nwhen the suit is undertaken it will not be compromised except upon the\r\nbasis that the government wins. Of course, gentleman, no laws amount\r\nto anything unless they are administered honestly and fearlessly. We\r\nmust have such administration or the law will amount to nothing. I\r\nbelieve that it is possible to frame national legislation which shall\r\ngive us far more power than we now have, at any rate over corporations\r\ndoing an interstate business. I can not guarantee that, because in\r\nthe past it has more than once happened that we have put laws on the\r\nstatute books which those who made them intended to mean one thing,\r\nand when they came up for decision by the courts, it was found that\r\nthe intention had not been successfully put into effect. But I\r\nbelieve that additional legislation can be had. If my belief is wrong,\r\nif it proves evident that we can not, under the Constitution as it is,\r\ngive the national administration sufficient power to deal with these\r\ngreat corporations, then no matter what our reverence for the past,\r\nour duty to the present and the future will force us to see that some\r\npower is conferred upon the national government. And when that power\r\nhas been conferred, then it will rest with the national government to\r\nexercise it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT HAVERHILL, MASS., AUGUST 26, 1902\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nNaturally at the home of Secretary Moody I should like to say a word\r\nor two about the navy. I think that whenever we touch on the navy we\r\nare sure of a hearty response from any American audience; we are just\r\nas sure of such a response in the mountains and great plains of the\r\nWest as upon the Atlantic or Pacific seaboards. The entire country is\r\nvitally interested in the navy, because an efficient navy of adequate\r\nsize is not only the best guarantee of peace, but is also the surest\r\nmeans for seeing that if war does come the result shall be honorable\r\nto our good name and favorable to our national interests.\r\n\r\nAny really great nation must be peculiarly sensitive to two things:\r\nStain on the national honor at home, and disgrace to the national\r\narms abroad. Our honor at home, our honor in domestic and internal\r\naffairs, is at all times in our own keeping, and depends simply upon\r\nthe possession of an awakened public conscience. But the only way to\r\nmake safe our honor, as affected not by our own deeds but by the deeds\r\nof others, is by readiness in advance. In three great crises in our\r\nhistory during the nineteenth century—in the War of 1812, in the Civil\r\nWar, and again in the Spanish War—the navy rendered to the nation\r\nservices of literally incalculable worth. In the Civil War we had to\r\nmeet antagonists even more unprepared at sea than we were. On both the\r\nother occasions we encountered foreign foes, and the fighting was done\r\nentirely by ships built long in advance, and by officers and crews\r\nwho had been trained during years of sea service for the supreme day\r\nwhen their qualities were put to the final test. The ships which won\r\nat Manila and Santiago under the Administration of President McKinley\r\nhad been built years before under Presidents Arthur, Cleveland, and\r\nHarrison. The officers in those ships had been trained from their\r\nearliest youth to their profession, and the enlisted men, in addition\r\nto their natural aptitude, their intelligence, and their courage, had\r\nbeen drilled as marksmen with the great guns and as machinists in the\r\nengine rooms, and perfected in all the details of their work during\r\nyears of cruising on the high seas and of incessant target practice.\r\nIt was this preparedness which was the true secret of the enormous\r\ndifference in efficiency between our navy and the Spanish navy. There\r\nwas no lack of courage and self-devotion among the Spaniards, but\r\non our side, in addition to the courage and devotion, for the lack\r\nof which no training could atone, there was also that training—the\r\ntraining which comes only as the result of years of thorough and\r\npainstaking practice.\r\n\r\nAnnapolis is, with the sole exception of its sister academy at West\r\nPoint, the most typically democratic and American school of learning\r\nand preparation that there is in the entire country. Men go there\r\nfrom every State, from every walk of life, professing every creed—the\r\nchance of entry being open to all who perfect themselves in the\r\nnecessary studies and who possess the necessary moral and physical\r\nqualities. There each man enters on his merits, stands on his merits,\r\nand graduates into a service where only his merit will enable him to\r\nbe of value.\r\n\r\nThe enlisted men are of fine type, as they needs must be to do their\r\nwork well, whether in the gun turret or in the engine room; and out\r\nof the fine material thus provided the finished man-of-war’s man is\r\nevolved by years of sea service.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible after the outbreak of war to improvise either the\r\nships or the men of a navy. A war vessel is a bit of mechanism as\r\ndelicate and complicated as it is formidable. You might just as well\r\nexpect to turn an unskilled laborer offhand into a skilled machinist\r\nor into the engineer of a flyer on one of our big railroad systems as\r\nto put men aboard a battleship with the expectation that they will\r\ndo anything but discredit themselves until they have had months and\r\nyears in which thoroughly to learn their duties. Our shipbuilders\r\nand gunmakers must keep ever on the alert so that no rivals pass\r\nthem by; and the officers and enlisted men on board the ships must\r\nin their turn, by the exercise of unflagging and intelligent zeal,\r\nkeep themselves fit to get the best use out of the weapons of war\r\nintrusted to their care. The instrument is always important, but the\r\nman who uses it is more important still. We must constantly endeavor\r\nto perfect our navy in all its duties in time of peace, and above all\r\nin manœuvring in a seaway and in marksmanship with the great guns. In\r\nbattle the only shots that count are those that hit, and marksmanship\r\nis a matter of long practice and of intelligent reasoning. A navy’s\r\nefficiency in a war depends mainly upon its preparedness at the\r\noutset of that war. We are not to be excused as a nation if there is\r\nnot such preparedness of our navy. This is especially so in view of\r\nwhat we have done during the last four years. No nation has a right\r\nto undertake a big task unless it is prepared to do it in masterful\r\nand effective style. It would be an intolerable humiliation for us to\r\nembark on such a course of action as followed from our declaration\r\nof war with Spain, and not make good our words by deeds—not be ready\r\nto prove our truth by our endeavor whenever the need calls. The\r\ngood work of building up the navy must go on without ceasing. The\r\nmodern warship can not with advantage be allowed to rust in disuse.\r\nIt must be used up in active service even in time of peace. This\r\nmeans that there must be a constant replacement of the ineffective\r\nby the effective. The work of building up and keeping up our navy is\r\ntherefore one which needs our constant and unflagging vigilance. Our\r\nnavy is now efficient; but we must be content with no ordinary degree\r\nof efficiency. Every effort must be made to bring it ever nearer to\r\nperfection. In making such effort the prime factor is to have at the\r\nhead of the navy such an official as your fellow-townsman, Mr. Moody;\r\nand the next is to bring home to our people as a whole the need of\r\nthorough and ample preparation in advance; this preparation to take\r\nthe form not only of continually building ships, but of keeping these\r\nships in commission under conditions which will develop the highest\r\ndegree of efficiency in the officers and enlisted men aboard them.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT PORTLAND, MAINE, AUGUST 26, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor, and you, my fellow-citizens, men and women of Maine_:\r\n\r\nI wish to say a word to you in recognition of great service rendered\r\nnot only to all our country but to the entire principle of democratic\r\ngovernment throughout the world, by one of your citizens. The best\r\ninstitutions are of no good if they won’t work. I do not care how\r\nbeautiful a theory is, if it won’t fit in with the facts it is of no\r\ngood. If you built the handsomest engine that ever had been built and\r\nit did not go, its usefulness would be limited. Well, that was just\r\nabout the condition that Congress had reached at the time when Thomas\r\nB. Reed was elected Speaker. We had all the machinery, but it didn’t\r\nwork,—that was the trouble,—and you had to find some one powerful man\r\nwho would disregard the storm of obloquy sure to be raised by what\r\nhe did in order to get it to work. Such a man was found when Reed\r\nwas made Speaker. We may differ among ourselves as to policy. We may\r\ndiffer among ourselves as to what course government should follow;\r\nbut if we possess any intelligence we must be a unit that it shall\r\nbe able to follow some course. If government can not go on it is not\r\ngovernment. If the legislative body can not enact laws, then there is\r\nno use of misnaming it a legislative body; and if the majority is to\r\nrule some method by which it can rule must be provided. Government by\r\nthe majority in Congress had practically come to a stop when Mr. Reed\r\nbecame Speaker. Mr. Reed, at the cost of infinite labor, at the cost\r\nof the fiercest attacks, succeeded in restoring that old principle;\r\nand now through Congress we can do well or ill, accordingly as the\r\npeople demand, but at any rate, we can do something—and we owe it more\r\nthan to any other one man to your fellow-citizen, Mr. Reed. It is a\r\ngreat thing for any man to be able to feel that in some one crisis he\r\nleft his mark deeply scored for good in the history of his country,\r\nand Tom Reed has the right to that feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT AUGUSTA, MAINE, AUGUST 26, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Governor Burleigh, my fellow-citizens, men and women of Maine_:\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult for any man speaking to this audience and from\r\nin front of the house in which Blaine once lived to fail to feel\r\nwhatever of Americanism there was in him stirred to the depths. For\r\nmy good fortune I knew Mr. Blaine quite well when he was Secretary of\r\nState, and I have thought again and again during the past few years\r\nhow pleased he would have been to see so many of the principles for\r\nwhich he had stood approach fruition.\r\n\r\nOne secret, perhaps I might say the chief secret, of Mr. Blaine’s\r\nextraordinary hold upon the affections of his countrymen was his\r\nentirely genuine and unaffected Americanism. When I speak of\r\nAmericanism I do not for a minute mean to say, gentlemen, that\r\nall the things we do are all right. I think there are plenty of\r\nevils to correct and that often a man shows himself all the more\r\na good American because he wants to cut out any evil of the body\r\npolitic which may interfere with our approaching the ideal of true\r\nAmericanism. But not only admitting but also emphasizing this, it\r\nyet remains true that throughout our history no one has been able to\r\nrender really great service to the country if he did not believe in\r\nthe country. Mr. Blaine possessed to an eminent degree the confident\r\nhope in the nation’s future which made him feel that she must ever\r\nstrive to fit herself for a great destiny. He felt that this Republic\r\nmust in every way take the lead in the Western Hemisphere. He felt\r\nthat this Republic must play a great part among the nations of the\r\nearth. The last four years have shown how true that feeling of his was.\r\n\r\nHe had always hoped that we would have a peculiarly intimate relation\r\nwith the countries south of us. He could hardly have anticipated—no\r\none could have—the Spanish War and its effects. In consequence of that\r\nwar America’s interest in the tropic islands to our south and the\r\nseas and coasts surrounding those islands is far greater than ever\r\nbefore. Our interest in the Monroe Doctrine is more complicated than\r\never before. The Monroe Doctrine is simply a statement of our very\r\nfirm belief that on this continent the nations now existing here must\r\nbe left to work out their own destinies among themselves and that the\r\ncontinent is not longer to be regarded as colonizing ground for any\r\nEuropean power. The one power on the continent that can make that\r\ndoctrine effective is, of course, ourselves; for in the world as it\r\nis, gentlemen, the nation which advances a given doctrine likely to\r\ninterfere in any way with other nations must possess power to back it\r\nup if she wishes the doctrine to be respected. We stand firmly on the\r\nMonroe Doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe events of the last nine months have rendered it evident that we\r\nshall soon embark on the work of excavating the Isthmian Canal to\r\nconnect the two great oceans—a work destined to be, probably, the\r\ngreatest engineering feat of the twentieth century, certainly a\r\ngreater engineering feat than has ever yet been successfully attempted\r\namong the nations of mankind; and as it is the biggest thing of its\r\nkind to be done I am glad it is the United States that is to do it.\r\nWhenever a nation undertakes to carry out a great destiny it must make\r\nup its mind that there will be work and worry, labor and risk, in\r\ndoing the work. It is with a nation as it is with an individual; if\r\nyou are content to attempt but little in private life you may be able\r\nto escape a good deal of worry, but you won’t achieve very much. The\r\nman who attempts much must make up his mind that there will now and\r\nthen come days and nights of worry; there will come even moments of\r\nseeming defeat. But out of the difficulties we wrest success. So it is\r\nwith the nation. It is not the easy task that is necessarily the best.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT BANGOR, MAINE, AUGUST 27, 1902\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nI am glad to greet the farmers of Maine. During the century that has\r\nclosed, the growth of industrialism has necessarily meant that cities\r\nand towns have increased in population more rapidly than the country\r\ndistricts. And yet, it remains true now as it always has been, that in\r\nthe last resort the country districts are those in which we are surest\r\nto find the old American spirit, the old American habits of thought\r\nand ways of living. Conditions have changed in the country far less\r\nthan they have changed in the cities, and in consequence there has\r\nbeen little breaking away from the methods of life which have produced\r\nthe great majority of the leaders of the Republic in the past. Almost\r\nall of our great Presidents have been brought up in the country, and\r\nmost of them worked hard on the farms in their youth and got their\r\nearly mental training in the healthy democracy of farm life.\r\n\r\nThe forces which made these farm-bred boys leaders of men when they\r\nhad come to their full manhood are still at work in our country\r\ndistricts. Self-help and individual initiative remain to a peculiar\r\ndegree typical of life in the country, life on a farm, in the\r\nlumbering camp, on a ranch. Neither the farmers nor their hired\r\nhands can work through combinations as readily as the capitalists or\r\nwage-workers of cities can work.\r\n\r\nIt must not be understood from this that there has been no change in\r\nfarming and farm life. The contrary is the case. There has been much\r\nchange, much progress. The granges and similar organizations, the\r\nfarmers’ institutes, and all the agencies which promote intelligent\r\nco-operation and give opportunity for social and intellectual\r\nintercourse among the farmers, have played a large part in raising\r\nthe level of life and work in the country districts. In the domain of\r\ngovernment, the Department of Agriculture since its foundation has\r\naccomplished results as striking as those obtained under any other\r\nbranch of the national administration. By scientific study of all\r\nmatters connected with the advancement of farm life; by experimental\r\nstations; by the use of trained agents, sent to the uttermost\r\ncountries of the globe; by the practical application of anything which\r\nin theory has been demonstrated to be efficient; in these ways, and in\r\nmany others, great good has been accomplished in raising the standard\r\nof productiveness in farm work throughout the country. We live in\r\nan era when the best results can only be achieved, if to individual\r\nself-help we add the mutual self-help which comes by combination,\r\nboth of citizens in their individual capacity and of citizens working\r\nthrough the State as an instrument. The farmers of the country have\r\ngrown more and more to realize this, and farming has tended more\r\nand more to take its place as an applied science—though, as with\r\neverything else, the theory must be tested in practical work, and can\r\navail only when applied in practical fashion.\r\n\r\nBut after all this has been said, it remains true that the\r\ncountryman—the man on the farm, more than any other of our citizens\r\nto-day, is called upon continually to exercise the qualities which\r\nwe like to think of as typical of the United States throughout its\r\nhistory—the qualities of rugged independence, masterful resolution,\r\nand individual energy and resourcefulness. He works hard (for\r\nwhich no man is to be pitied), and often he lives hard (which may\r\nnot be pleasant); but his life is passed in healthy surroundings,\r\nsurroundings which tend to develop a fine type of citizenship. In the\r\ncountry, moreover, the conditions are fortunately such as to allow\r\na closer touch between man and man, than, too often, we find to be\r\nthe case in the city. Men feel more vividly the underlying sense of\r\nbrotherhood, of community of interest. I do not mean by this that\r\nthere are not plenty of problems connected with life in our rural\r\ndistricts. There are many problems; and great wisdom and earnest\r\ndisinterestedness in effort are needed for their solution.\r\n\r\nAfter all, we are one people, with the same fundamental\r\ncharacteristics, whether we live in the city or in the country, in the\r\nEast or in the West, in the North or the South. Each of us, unless\r\nhe is contented to be a cumberer of the earth’s surface, must strive\r\nto do his life-work with his whole heart. Each must remember that,\r\nwhile he will be noxious to every one unless he first do his duty by\r\nhimself, he must also strive ever to do his duty by his fellow. The\r\nproblem of how to do these duties is acute everywhere. It is most\r\nacute in great cities, but it exists in the country, too. A man, to\r\nbe a good citizen, must first be a good bread-winner, a good husband,\r\na good father—I hope the father of many healthy children; just as a\r\nwoman’s first duty is to be a good housewife and mother. The business\r\nduties, the home duties, the duties to one’s family, come first. The\r\ncouple who bring up plenty of healthy children, who leave behind them\r\nmany sons and daughters fitted in their turn to be good citizens,\r\nemphatically deserve well of the State.\r\n\r\nBut duty to one’s self and one’s family does not exclude duty to\r\none’s neighbor. Each of us, rich or poor, can help his neighbor at\r\ntimes; and to do this he must be brought into touch with him, into\r\nsympathy with him. Any effort is to be welcomed that brings people\r\ncloser together, so as to secure a better understanding among those\r\nwhose walks of life are in ordinary circumstances far apart. Probably\r\nthe good done is almost equally great on both sides, no matter which\r\none may seem to be helping the other. But it must be kept in mind\r\nthat no good will be accomplished at all by any philanthropic or\r\ncharitable work, unless it is done along certain definite lines. In\r\nthe first place, if the work is done in a spirit of condescension, it\r\nwould be better never to attempt it. It is almost as irritating to be\r\npatronized as to be wronged. The only safe way of working is to try to\r\nfind out some scheme by which it is possible to make a common effort\r\nfor the common good. Each of us needs at times to have a helping hand\r\nstretched out to him or her. Every one of us slips on some occasion,\r\nand shame to his fellow who then refuses to stretch out the hand that\r\nshould always be ready to help the man who stumbles. It is our duty\r\nto lift him up; but it is also our duty to remember that there is no\r\nearthly use in trying to carry him. If a man will submit to being\r\ncarried, that is sufficient to show that he is not worth carrying. In\r\nthe long run, the only kind of help that really avails is the help\r\nwhich teaches a man to help himself. Such help every man who has been\r\nblessed in life should try to give to those who are less fortunate,\r\nand such help can be accepted with entire self-respect.\r\n\r\nThe aim to set before ourselves in trying to aid one another is to\r\ngive that aid under conditions which will harm no man’s self-respect,\r\nand which will teach the less fortunate how to help themselves as\r\ntheir stronger brothers do. To give such aid it is necessary not only\r\nto possess the right kind of heart, but also the right kind of head.\r\nHardness of heart is a dreadful quality, but it is doubtful whether,\r\nin the long run, it works more damage than softness of head. At any\r\nrate, both are undesirable. The prerequisite to doing good work in the\r\nfield of philanthropy—in the field of social effort, undertaken with\r\none’s fellows for the common good—is that it shall be undertaken in a\r\nspirit of broad sanity no less than of broad and loving charity.\r\n\r\nThe other day I picked up a little book called “The Simple Life,”\r\nwritten by an Alsatian, Charles Wagner, and he preaches such\r\nwholesome, sound doctrine that I wish it could be used as a tract\r\nthroughout our country. To him the whole problem of our complex,\r\nsomewhat feverish modern life can be solved only by getting men and\r\nwomen to lead better lives. He sees that the permanence of liberty and\r\ndemocracy depends upon a majority of the people being steadfast in\r\nmorality and in that good plain sense which, as a national attribute,\r\ncomes only as the result of the slow and painful labor of centuries,\r\nand which can be squandered in a generation by the thoughtless and\r\nvicious. He preaches the doctrine of the superiority of the moral to\r\nthe material. He does not undervalue the material, but he insists, as\r\nwe of this nation should always insist, upon the infinite superiority\r\nof the moral, and the sordid destruction which comes upon either the\r\nnation or the individual if it or he becomes absorbed only in the\r\ndesire to get wealth. The true line of cleavage lies between good\r\ncitizen and bad citizen; and the line of cleavage may, and often\r\ndoes, run at right angles to that which divides the rich and the\r\npoor. The sinews of virtue lie in man’s capacity to care for what\r\nis outside himself. The man who gives himself up to the service of\r\nhis appetites, the man who the more goods he has the more wants, has\r\nsurrendered himself to destruction. It makes little difference whether\r\nhe achieves his purpose or not. If his point of view is all wrong,\r\nhe is a bad citizen whether he be rich or poor. It is a small matter\r\nto the community whether in arrogance and insolence he has misused\r\ngreat wealth, or whether, though poor, he is possessed by the mean\r\nand fierce desire to seize a morsel, the biggest possible, of that\r\nprey which the fortunate of earth consume. The man who lives simply,\r\nand justly, and honorably, whether rich or poor, is a good citizen.\r\nThose who dream only of idleness and pleasure, who hate others, and\r\nfail to recognize the duty of each man to his brother, these, be they\r\nrich or poor, are the enemies of the State. The misuse of property\r\nis one manifestation of the same evil spirit which, under changed\r\ncircumstances, denies the right of property because this right is in\r\nthe hands of others. In a purely material civilization the bitterness\r\nof attack on another’s possession is only additional proof of the\r\nextraordinary importance attached to possession itself. When outward\r\nwell-being, instead of being regarded as a valuable foundation on\r\nwhich happiness may with wisdom be built, is mistaken for happiness\r\nitself, so that material prosperity becomes the one standard, then,\r\nalike by those who enjoy such prosperity in slothful or criminal ease,\r\nand by those who in no less evil manner rail at, envy, and long for\r\nit, poverty is held to be shameful, and money, whether well or ill\r\ngotten, to stand for merit.\r\n\r\nAll this does not mean condemnation of progress. It is mere folly to\r\ntry to dig up the dead past, and scant is the good that comes from\r\nasceticism and retirement from the world. But let us make sure that\r\nour progress is in the essentials as well as in the incidentals.\r\nMaterial prosperity without the moral lift toward righteousness means\r\na diminished capacity for happiness and a debased character. The worth\r\nof a civilization is the worth of the man at its centre. When this man\r\nlacks moral rectitude, material progress only makes bad worse, and\r\nsocial problems still darker and more complex.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT NORTHFIELD, MASS., SEPTEMBER 1, 1902\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nHere near the seat of the summer school for young men founded by\r\nDwight L. Moody, I naturally speak on a subject suggested to me by the\r\nlife of Mr. Moody and by the aims sought for through the establishment\r\nof the summer school.\r\n\r\nIn such a school—a school which is to equip young men to do good in\r\nthe world—to show both the desire for the rule of righteousness and\r\nthe practical power to give actual effect to that desire—it seems\r\nto me there are two texts specially worthy of emphasis: One is, “Be\r\nye doers of the word and not hearers only”; and the other is, “Not\r\nslothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.” A republic\r\nof freemen is pre-eminently a community in which there is need for\r\nthe actual exercise and practical application of both the milder\r\nand the stronger virtues. Every good quality—every virtue and every\r\ngrace—has its place and is of use in the great scheme of creation;\r\nbut it is of course a mere truism to say that at certain times and in\r\ncertain places there is pre-eminent need for a given set of virtues.\r\nIn our own country, with its many-sided, hurrying, practical life, the\r\nplace for cloistered virtue is far smaller than is the place for that\r\nessential manliness which, without losing its fine and lofty side, can\r\nyet hold its own in the rough struggle with the forces of the world\r\nround about us. It would be a very bad thing for this country if it\r\nhappened that the men of righteous living tended to lose the robust,\r\nvirile qualities of heart, mind and body, and if, on the other hand,\r\nthe men best fitted practically to achieve results lost the guidance\r\nof the moral law. No one-sided development can produce really good\r\ncitizenship—as good citizenship is needed in the America of to-day. If\r\na man has not in him the root of righteousness—if he does not believe\r\nin, and practice, honesty—if he is not truthful and upright, clean and\r\nhigh-minded, fair in his dealings both at home and abroad—then the\r\nstronger he is, the abler and more energetic he is, the more dangerous\r\nhe is to the body politic. Wisdom untempered by devotion to an ideal\r\nusually means only that dangerous cunning which is far more fatal in\r\nits ultimate effects to the community than open violence itself. It is\r\ninexcusable in an honest people to deify mere success without regard\r\nto the qualities by which that success is achieved. Indeed there is a\r\nrevolting injustice, intolerable to just minds, in punishing the weak\r\nscoundrel who fails, and bowing down to and making life easy for the\r\nfar more dangerous scoundrel who succeeds. A wicked man who is wicked\r\non a large scale, whether in business or in politics, of course does\r\nmany times more evil to the community than the man who only ventures\r\nto be wicked furtively and in lesser ways. If possible, the success\r\nof such a man should be prevented by law, and in any event he ought\r\nto be made to feel that there is no condonation of his offences by\r\nthe public. There is no more unpleasant manifestation of public\r\nfeeling than the deification of mere “smartness,” as it is termed—of\r\nmere successful cunning unhampered by scruple or generosity or right\r\nfeeling. If a man is not decent, is not square and honest, then the\r\npossession of ability only serves to render him more dangerous to\r\nthe community; as a wild beast grows more dangerous the stronger and\r\nfiercer he is.\r\n\r\nBut virtue by itself is not enough, or anything like enough. Strength\r\nmust be added to it, and the determination to use that strength. The\r\ngood man who is ineffective is not able to make his goodness of much\r\naccount to the people as a whole. No matter how much a man hears\r\nthe word, small is the credit attached to him if he fails to be a\r\ndoer also; and in serving the Lord he must remember that he needs\r\nto avoid sloth in his business as well as to cultivate fervency of\r\nspirit. All around us there are great evils to combat, and they are\r\nnot to be combated with success by men who pride themselves on their\r\nsuperiority in taste and in virtue, and draw aside from the world’s\r\nlife. It matters not whether they thus draw aside because they fear\r\ntheir fellows or because they despise them. Each feeling—the fear no\r\nless than the contempt—is shameful and unworthy. A man to be a good\r\nAmerican must be straight, and he must also be strong. He must have\r\nin him the conscience which will teach him to see the right, and he\r\nmust also have the vigor, the courage, and the practical, hard-headed\r\ncommon-sense which will enable him to make his seeing right result in\r\nsome benefit to his fellows.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT FITCHBURG, MASS., SEPTEMBER 2, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor, and you, my Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nThere are two or three things that I should like to say to this\r\naudience, but before beginning what I have to say on some of the\r\nproblems of the day, I wish to thank for their greeting, not only all\r\nof you, my fellow-citizens here, but particularly the men of the great\r\nwar, and second only to them my comrades of a lesser war, where, I\r\nhope, we showed that we were anxious to do our duty, as you had done\r\nyours, only the need did not come to us.\r\n\r\nWe have great problems before us as a nation. I will not try to\r\ndiscuss them at length with you to-day, but I can speak a word\r\nas to the manner in which they must be met if they are to be met\r\nsuccessfully. All great works, though they differ in the method of\r\ndoing them, must be solved by substantially the same qualities. You\r\nwho upheld the arms of Lincoln, who followed the sword of Grant, were\r\nable to do your duty not because you found some patent device for\r\ndoing it, but by going down to the bedrock principles which had made\r\ngood soldiers since the world began.\r\n\r\nThere was no method possible to devise which would have spared you\r\nfrom heart-breaking fatigue on the marches, from hardships at night,\r\nfrom danger in battle. The only way to overcome those difficulties and\r\ndangers was by drawing on every ounce of hardihood, of courage, of\r\nloyalty, and of iron resolution. That is how you had to win out. You\r\nhad to win as the soldiers of Washington had won before you, as we of\r\nthe younger generation must win if ever the call should be made upon\r\nus to face a serious foe. Arms change, tactics change, but the spirit\r\nthat makes the real soldier does not change. The spirit that makes for\r\nvictory does not change.\r\n\r\nIt is just so in civic life. The problems change, but fundamentally\r\nthe qualities needed to face them in the average citizen are the same.\r\nOur new and highly complex industrial civilization has produced a new\r\nand complicated series of problems. We need to face those problems and\r\nnot to run away from them. We need to exercise all our ingenuity in\r\ntrying to devise some effective solution, but the only way in which\r\nthat solution can be applied is the old way of bringing honesty,\r\ncourage, and common-sense to bear upon it. One feature of honesty and\r\ncommon-sense combined is never to promise what you do not think you\r\ncan perform, and then never fail to perform what you have promised.\r\nAnd that applies in public life just as much as in private life.\r\n\r\nIf some of those who have seen cause for wonder in what I have said\r\nthis summer on the subject of the great corporations, which are\r\npopularly, although with technical inaccuracy, known as trusts, would\r\ntake the trouble to read my messages when I was Governor, what I said\r\non the stump two years ago, and what I put into my first message\r\nto Congress, I think they would have been less astonished. I said\r\nnothing on the stump that I did not think I could make good, and I\r\nshall not hesitate now to take the position which I then advocated.\r\n\r\nI am even more anxious that you who hear what I say should think of it\r\nthan that you should applaud it. I am not going to try to define with\r\ntechnical accuracy what ought to be meant when we speak of a trust.\r\nBut if by trust we mean merely a big corporation, then I ask you to\r\nponder the utter folly of the man who either in a spirit of rancor or\r\nin a spirit of folly says “destroy the trusts,” without giving you\r\nan idea of what he means really to do. I will go with him if he says\r\ndestroy the evil in the trusts, gladly. I will try to find out that\r\nevil, I will seek to apply remedies, which I have already outlined\r\nin other speeches; but if his policy, from whatever motive, whether\r\nhatred, fear, panic or just sheer ignorance, is to destroy the trusts\r\nin a way that will destroy all our property—no. Those men who advocate\r\nwild and foolish remedies which would be worse than the disease are\r\ndoing all in their power to perpetuate the evils against which they\r\nnominally war, because, if we are brought face to face with the naked\r\nissue of either keeping or totally destroying a prosperity in which\r\nthe majority share, but in which some share improperly, why, as\r\nsensible men, we must decide that it is a great deal better that some\r\npeople should prosper too much than that no one should prosper enough.\r\nSo that the man who advocates destroying the trusts by measures which\r\nwould paralyze the industries of the country is at least a quack, and\r\nat worst an enemy to the Republic.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 there was no trouble about anybody making too much money. The\r\ntrusts were down, but the trouble was that we were all of us down.\r\nNothing but harm to the whole body politic can come from ignorant\r\nagitation, carried on partially against real evils, partially against\r\nimaginary evils, but in a spirit which would substitute for the real\r\nevils evils just as real and infinitely greater. Those men, if they\r\nshould succeed, could do nothing to bring about a solution of the\r\ngreat problems with which we are concerned. If they could destroy\r\ncertain of the evils at the cost of overthrowing the well-being of the\r\nentire country, it would mean merely that there would come a reaction\r\nin which they and their remedies would be hopelessly discredited.\r\n\r\nNow, it does not do anybody any good, and it will do most of us a\r\ngreat deal of harm, to take steps which will check any proper growth\r\nin a corporation. We wish not to penalize but to reward a great\r\ncaptain of industry or the men banded together in a corporation who\r\nhave the business forethought and energy necessary to build up a great\r\nindustrial enterprise. Keep that in mind. A big corporation may be\r\ndoing excellent work for the whole country, and you want, above all\r\nthings, when striving to get a plan which will prevent wrongdoing\r\nby a corporation which desires to do wrong, not at the same time to\r\nhave a scheme which will interfere with a corporation doing well, if\r\nthat corporation is handling itself honestly and squarely. What I\r\nam saying ought to be treated as simple, elementary truths. The only\r\nreason it is necessary to say them at all is that apparently some\r\npeople forget them.\r\n\r\nI believe something can be done by national legislation. When I state\r\nthat I ask you to note my words. I say I believe. It is not in my\r\npower to say I know. When I talk to you of my own executive duties I\r\ncan tell you definitely what will and what will not be done. When I\r\nspeak of the actions of any one else I can only say that I believe\r\nsomething more can be done by national legislation. I believe it\r\nwill be done. I think we can get laws which will increase the power\r\nof the Federal Government over corporations; if we can not, then\r\nthere will have to be an amendment to the Constitution of the nation\r\nconferring additional power upon the Federal Government to deal with\r\ncorporations. To get that will be a matter of difficulty, and a matter\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nLet me interrupt here by way of illustration. You of the great war\r\nrecollect that about six weeks after Sumter had been fired on there\r\nbegan to be loud clamor in the North among people who were not at the\r\nfront that you should go to Richmond; and there were any number of\r\npeople who told you how to go there. Then came Bull Run, and a lot\r\nof those same people who a fortnight before had been yelling “On to\r\nRichmond at once,” turned around and said the war was over. All the\r\nhysteric brotherhood said so. But you didn’t think so. The war was\r\nnot over. It was not over for three years and nine months, and then\r\nit was over the other way. And you got it over by setting your faces\r\nsteadily toward the goal, by not relying upon anything impossible,\r\nbut by each doing everything possible that came in his line to do, by\r\neach man doing his duty. You did not win by any patent device; you won\r\nby the generalship of Grant and Sherman and Thomas and Sheridan, and,\r\nabove all, by the soldiership of the men who carried the muskets and\r\nthe sabres. It did not come as soon as you wanted, and the men who\r\nsaid it would come at once did not help you much either.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with any great problem in civil life, be it the trusts\r\nor anything else, you are going to get along in just about the same\r\nfashion. There is not any patent remedy for all the ills. All we can\r\ndo is to make up our minds definitely that we intend to find some\r\nmethod by which we shall be able to tell, in the first place, what\r\nare the real evils and what of the alleged evils are imaginary; in\r\nthe next place, what of those real evils it is possible to cure by\r\nlegislation; and then to cure them by legislation and by an honest\r\nadministration of the laws after they have been enacted. That\r\nstatement of the problem will never be attractive to the man who\r\nthinks that somehow, by turning your hand, you are going to get a\r\ncomplete solution at once.\r\n\r\nGrant’s plan of fighting it out on that line, if it took all summer,\r\nwas not attractive to the men who wanted it done in a week. But it\r\nwas the only plan that won. The only way we can ever work out even\r\nan approximately satisfactory solution of these great industrial\r\nproblems, of which this so-called problem of the trusts is but one, is\r\nby approaching them in a spirit which shall combine equally sanity and\r\nself-restraint on the one hand and resolute purpose on the other.\r\n\r\nIt is not given to me or to any one else to promise a perfect\r\nsolution. It is not given to me or to any one else to promise you even\r\nan approximately perfect solution in a short time. But I think that\r\nwe can work out a very great improvement over the present conditions,\r\nand the steps taken must, I am sure, be along these lines—along the\r\nlines, in the first place, of getting power somewhere so that we shall\r\nbe able to say, the nation has power, let it use that power—and not as\r\nit is at present, where it is out of the question to say exactly where\r\nthe power is.\r\n\r\nWe must get power first, then use that power fearlessly, but with\r\nmoderation. Let me say that again—with moderation, with sanity, with\r\nself-restraint. The mechanism of modern business is altogether too\r\ndelicate and too complicated for us to sanction for one moment any\r\nintermeddling with it in a spirit of ignorance, above all in a spirit\r\nof rancor. Something can be done, something is being done now. Much\r\nmore can be done if our people resolutely but temperately will that\r\nit shall be done. But the certain way of bringing great harm upon\r\nourselves, without in any way furthering the solution of the problem,\r\nbut, on the contrary, deferring indefinitely its proper solution,\r\nwould be to act in a spirit of ignorance, of violence, of rancor, in a\r\nspirit which would make us tear down the temple of industry in which\r\nwe live because we are not satisfied with some of the details of its\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nI want you to think of what I have said, because it represents all of\r\nthe sincerity and earnestness that I have, and I say to you here, from\r\nthis platform, nothing that I have not already stated in effect, and\r\nnothing I would not say at a private table with any of the biggest\r\ncorporation managers in the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT DALTON, MASS., SEPTEMBER 3, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Governor Crane, and you, my Friends and Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that in a town like this we not only have but ought\r\nto have a better standard of citizenship and a more thorough\r\nappreciation of the rights and duties of the individual citizen and of\r\nthe possibilities of government than in almost any other community.\r\nHere is a town where you have both farming and manufacturing,\r\nwhere you have on a small scale all the elements that go to make\r\nup the industrial life of the nation as a whole—the capitalist\r\nand wage-earner, the farmer and hired man, merchant, men of the\r\nprofessions, you have them all; you see the forces that have built up\r\nthe nation and that are at work in the nation, in play round about\r\nyou in the farms, in the factories, in the houses, right among\r\nyour neighbors and friends. When men live in a big city they lose\r\ntouch with one another; they tend to lose intimate touch with the\r\ngovernment, and they get to speak of the state, of the government, as\r\nsomething entirely apart from them. Now the government is us, here,\r\nyou and me, and that ought to make us understand on the one hand what\r\nwe have a right to expect from the government, and on the other hand\r\nwhat it is foolish to expect from the government. We have a right to\r\nexpect from it that it will secure us against injustice; that so far\r\nas is humanly possible it will secure for each man a fair chance;\r\nthat it will do justice as between man and man, and that it will not\r\nrespect persons; that in that division of the government dealing with\r\njustice each man shall stand absolutely on his merits, not being\r\ndiscriminated for or against because of his wealth or his poverty,\r\nbecause of anything but his own conduct.\r\n\r\nThe government can take hold of certain functions which are in the\r\ninterest of the people as a whole. More than this the government can\r\nnot do or else does at the risk of doing it badly. The government\r\ncan not supply the lack in any man of the qualities which must\r\ndetermine in the last resort the man’s success or failure. Instead\r\nof “government” say “the town.” Now what can the town do for you? A\r\ngood deal; but not nearly as much as you can do for it, not nearly as\r\nmuch as you must do for yourself. The government can not make a man\r\na success in life. If we would remember that and remember that when\r\nwe use the large terms of the government and nation, we only mean\r\nthe town on a large scale, there would be much less danger in our\r\nthinking that perhaps by some queer patent device or some scheme, the\r\nstate, the government, the town, can supply the lack of individual\r\nthrift, energy, enterprise, resolution. It can not supply such lack.\r\nSomething can be done by government, that is, by all of us acting\r\ntogether to protect the rights of all, to accomplish certain things\r\nfor all. Something can be accomplished by helping one another. He is\r\na poor creature who does not give help generously when the chance\r\ncomes. But finally in the last resort the man who wins now will be the\r\nman of the type who has won always, the man who can win for himself.\r\nDo not make the mistake of thinking that it is possible ever to call\r\nin any outside force to take the place of the man’s own individual\r\ninitiative, the man’s individual capacity to do work worth doing.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT WHEELING, W. VA., SEPTEMBER 6, 1902\r\n\r\n  _My Friends and Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to come here to your city. I wish to thank the Mayor,\r\nand through the Mayor all of your citizens, for the way in which,\r\nupon your behalf, he has greeted me; and I wish to state that it is a\r\nspecial pleasure to be introduced by my friend, Senator Scott. I have\r\nknown the Senator for some time, and I like him, because when he gives\r\nyou his word you don’t have to think about it again.\r\n\r\nI am glad to have the chance of saying a few words here in this great\r\nindustrial centre in one of those regions which have felt to a notable\r\ndegree the effects of the period of prosperity through which we are\r\nnow passing. Probably never before in our history has the country been\r\nmore prosperous than it is at this moment; and it is a prosperity\r\nwhich has come alike to the tillers of the soil and to those connected\r\nwith our great industrial enterprises.\r\n\r\nEvery period has its own troubles and difficulties. A period of\r\nadversity, of course, troubles us all; but there are troubles in\r\nconnection with a period of prosperity also. When all things flourish\r\nit means that there is a good chance for things that we don’t like to\r\nflourish also, just exactly as things that we do like. A period of\r\ngreat national material well-being is inevitably one in which men’s\r\nminds are turned to the way in which those flourish who are interested\r\nin the management of the gigantic capitalistic corporations, whose\r\ngrowth has been so noted a feature of the last half century—the\r\ncorporations which we have grown to speak of rather loosely as\r\ntrusts—accepting the word in its usual and common significance as a\r\nbig corporation usually doing business in several States at least,\r\nbesides the State in which it is incorporated, and often, though not\r\nalways, with some element of monopoly in it.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that in dealing with this problem of the trusts—perhaps\r\nit would be more accurate to say the group of problems which come\r\ninto our minds when we think of the trusts—we have two classes of our\r\nfellow-citizens whom we have to convert or override. One is composed\r\nof those men who refuse to admit that there is any action necessary at\r\nall. The other is composed of those men who advocate some action so\r\nextreme, so foolish, that it would either be entirely non-effective,\r\nor, if effective, would be so only by destroying everything, good and\r\nbad, connected with our industrial development.\r\n\r\nIn every governmental process the aim that a people capable of\r\nself-government should steadfastly keep in mind is to proceed by\r\nevolution rather than revolution. On the other hand, every people\r\nfit for self-government must beware of that fossilization of mind\r\nwhich refuses to allow of any change as conditions change. Now, in\r\ndealing with the whole problem of the change in our great industrial\r\ncivilization—in dealing with the tendencies which have been\r\naccentuated in so extraordinary a degree by steam and electricity,\r\nand by the tremendous upbuilding of industrial centres which steam\r\nand electricity have been the main factors in bringing about—I think\r\nwe must set before ourselves the desire not to accept less than the\r\npossible, and at the same time not to bring ourselves to a complete\r\nstandstill by attempting the impossible. It is a good deal as it is in\r\ntaking care, through the engineers, of the lower Mississippi River.\r\nNo one can dam the Mississippi. If the nation started to dam it, the\r\nnation would waste its time. It would not hurt the Mississippi, but\r\nit would not only throw away its own means, but would incidentally\r\ndamage the population along the banks. You can’t dam the current.\r\nYou can build levees to keep the current within bounds and to shape\r\nits direction. I think that is exactly what we can do in connection\r\nwith these great corporations known as trusts. We can not reverse the\r\nindustrial tendency of the age. If you succeed in doing it, then all\r\ncities like Wheeling will have to go out of business. Remember that.\r\nYou can not put a stop to or reverse the industrial tendencies of the\r\nage, but you can control and regulate them and see that they do no\r\nharm.\r\n\r\nA flood comes down the Mississippi—you can’t stop it. If you tried\r\nto build a dam across it, it would not hurt the flood, and it would\r\nnot benefit you. You can guide it between levees so as to prevent its\r\ndoing injury, and so as to ensure its doing good. Another thing: you\r\ndon’t build those levees in a day or in a month. A man who told you\r\nthat he had a patent device by which in sixty days he would solve the\r\nwhole question of the floods along the lower Mississippi would not be\r\na wise man; but he would be a perfect miracle of wisdom compared to\r\nthe man who tells you that by any one patent remedy he can bring the\r\nmillennium in our industrial and social affairs.\r\n\r\nWe can do something; I believe we can do a good deal, but our\r\naccomplishing what I expect to see accomplished is conditioned upon\r\nour setting to work in a spirit as far removed as possible from\r\nhysteria—a spirit of sober, steadfast, kindly—I want to emphasize\r\nthat—kindly determination not to submit to wrong ourselves and not to\r\nwrong others, not to interfere with the great business development\r\nof the country, and at the same time so to shape our legislation and\r\nadministration as to minimize, if we can not eradicate, the unpleasant\r\nand vicious features connected with that industrial development. I\r\nhave said that there can be no patent remedy. There is not any one\r\nthing which can be done to remove all of the existing evils. There are\r\na good many things which, if we do them all, will, I believe, make a\r\nvery appreciable betterment in the existing conditions. To do that is\r\nnot to make a promise that will evoke wild enthusiasm, but a promise\r\nthat can be kept; and in the long run it is much more comfortable only\r\nto make promises that can be kept than to make promises which are\r\nsure of an immense reception when made, but which entail intolerable\r\nhumiliation when it is attempted to carry them out.\r\n\r\nI am sufficiently fortunate to be advocating now, as President,\r\nprecisely the remedies that I advocated two years ago—advocating them\r\nnot in any partisan spirit, because, gentlemen, this problem is one\r\nwhich affects the life of the nation as a whole—but advocating them\r\nsimply as the American citizen who, for the time being, stands as the\r\nChief Executive and, therefore, the special representative of his\r\nfellow-American citizens of all parties.\r\n\r\nA century and a quarter ago there had been no development of industry\r\nsuch as to make it a matter of the least importance whether the nation\r\nor the State had charge of the great corporations or supervised the\r\ngreat business and industrial organizations. A century and a quarter\r\nago, here at Wheeling, commerce was carried on by pack train, by wagon\r\ntrain, by boat. That was the way it was carried on throughout the\r\nwhole civilized world—oars and sails, wheeled vehicles and beasts of\r\nburden—those were the means of carrying on commerce at the end of the\r\neighteenth century, when this country became a nation.\r\n\r\nThere had been no radical change, no essential change, in the means\r\nof carrying on commerce from the days when the Phœnician galleys\r\nplowed the waters of the Mediterranean. For four or five thousand\r\nyears, perhaps longer, from the immemorial past when Babylon and\r\nNineveh stood in Mesopotamia, when Thebes and Memphis were mighty\r\nin the valley of the Nile—from that time on through the supremacy\r\nof Greece and of Rome, through the upbuilding of the great trading\r\ncities like Venice and Genoa in Italy; like the cities of the Rhine\r\nand the Netherlands in Northern Europe—on through the period of the\r\ngreat expansion of European civilization which followed the voyages of\r\nColumbus and Vasco da Gama, down to the time when this country became\r\na nation—the means of commercial intercourse remained substantially\r\nunchanged. Those means, therefore, limited narrowly what could be\r\ndone by any corporation, the growth that could take place in any\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, during our own lifetime as a nation—a lifetime trivial\r\nin duration compared to the period of recorded history—there came\r\na revolution in the means of intercourse which made a change in\r\ncommerce, and in all that springs from commerce, in industrial\r\ndevelopment, greater than all the changes of the preceding thousands\r\nof years. A greater change in the means of commerce of mankind has\r\ntaken place since Wheeling was founded, since the first settlers built\r\ntheir log huts in the great forests on the banks of this river, than\r\nin all the previous period during which man had led an existence that\r\ncan be called civilized.\r\n\r\nThrough the railway, the electric telegraph, and other developments,\r\nsteam and electricity worked a complete revolution. This has meant,\r\nof course, that entirely new problems have sprung up. You have right\r\nin this immediate neighborhood a very much larger population than any\r\nsimilar region in all the United States held when the Continental\r\nCongress began its sessions; and the change in industrial conditions\r\nhas been literally immeasurable. Those changed conditions need a\r\ncorresponding change in the governmental agencies necessary for their\r\nregulation and supervision.\r\n\r\nSuch agencies were not provided, and could not have been provided,\r\nin default of a knowledge of prophecy by the men who founded the\r\nRepublic. In those days each State could take care perfectly well\r\nof any corporations within its limits, and all it had to do was to\r\ntry to encourage their upbuilding. Now the big corporations, although\r\nnominally the creatures of one State, usually do business in other\r\nStates, and in a very large number of cases the wide variety of State\r\nlaws on the subject of corporations has brought about the fact that\r\nthe corporation is made in one State, but does almost all its work in\r\nentirely different States.\r\n\r\nIt has proved utterly impossible to get anything like uniformity of\r\nlegislation among the States. Some States have passed laws about\r\ncorporations which, if they had not been ineffective, would have\r\ntotally prevented any important corporate work being done within their\r\nlimits. Other States have such lax laws that there is no effective\r\neffort made to control any of the abuses. As a result we have a system\r\nof divided control—where the nation has something to say, but it is\r\na little difficult to know exactly how much, and where the different\r\nStates have each something to say, but where there is no supreme power\r\nthat can speak with authority. It is, of course, a mere truism to say\r\nthat every corporation, the smallest as well as the largest, is the\r\ncreature of the State. Where the corporation is small there is very\r\nlittle need of exercising much supervision over it, but the stupendous\r\ncorporations of the present day certainly should be under governmental\r\nsupervision and regulation. The first effort to make is to give\r\nsomebody the power to exercise that supervision, that regulation.\r\nWe have already laws on the statute books. Those laws will be\r\nenforced, and are being enforced, with all the power of the National\r\nGovernment, and wholly without regard to persons. But the power is\r\nvery limited. Now I want you to take my words at their exact value. I\r\nthink—I can not say I am sure, because it has often happened in the\r\npast that Congress has passed a law with a given purpose in view, and\r\nwhen that law has been judicially interpreted it has proved that the\r\npurpose was not achieved—but I think that by legislation additional\r\npower in the way of regulation of at least a number of these great\r\ncorporations can be conferred. But, gentlemen, I firmly believe that\r\nin the end power must be given to the National Government to exercise\r\nin full supervision and regulation of these great enterprises, and,\r\nif necessary, a Constitutional amendment must be resorted to for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThat is not new doctrine for me. That is the doctrine that I advocated\r\non the stump two years ago. Some of my ultra-conservative friends\r\nhave professed to be greatly shocked at my advocating it now. I would\r\nexplain to those gentlemen, once for all, that they err whenever they\r\nthink that I advocate on the stump anything that I will not try to\r\nput into effect after election. The objection is made that working\r\nalong these lines will take time. So it will. Let me go back to my\r\nillustration of the Mississippi River. It took time to build the\r\nlevees, but we built them. And if we have the proper intelligence, the\r\nproper resolution, and the proper self-restraint, we can work out the\r\nsolution along the lines that I have indicated. Thus, the first thing\r\nis to give the National Government the power. All the power that is\r\ngiven, I can assure you, will be used in a spirit as free as possible\r\nfrom rancor of any kind, but with the firmest determination to make\r\nbig man and little man alike obey the law.\r\n\r\nWhat we need first is power. Having gotten the power, remember the\r\nwork won’t be ended—it will be only fairly begun. And let me say\r\nagain and again and again that you will not get the millennium—the\r\nmillennium is some way off yet. But you will be in a position to make\r\nlong strides in advance in the direction of securing a juster, fairer,\r\nwiser management of many of these corporations, both as regards the\r\ngeneral public and as regards their relationship among themselves and\r\nto the investing public. When we have the power I most earnestly hope,\r\nand should most earnestly advocate, that it be used with the greatest\r\nwisdom and self-restraint.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do would be to find out the facts. For that\r\npurpose I am absolutely clear that we need publicity—that we need it\r\nnot as a matter of favor from any one corporation, but as a matter\r\nof right, secured through the agents of the Government, from all\r\nthe corporations concerned. The mere fact of the publicity itself\r\nwill tend to stop many of the evils, and it will show that some\r\nother alleged evils are imaginary, and finally in making evident the\r\nremaining evils—those that are not imaginary and that are not cured\r\nby the simple light of day—it will give us an intelligent appreciation\r\nof the methods to take in getting at them. We should have, under such\r\ncircumstances, one sovereign to whom the big corporations should be\r\nresponsible—a sovereign in whose courts a corporation could be held\r\naccountable for any failure to comply with the laws of the legislature\r\nof that sovereign. I do not think you can accomplish that among the\r\nforty-six sovereigns of the States. I think that it will have to be\r\nthrough the National Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE BROTHERHOOD OF LOCOMOTIVE FIREMEN, CHATTANOOGA, TENN.,\r\nSEPTEMBER 8, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Grand Master, Governor McMillan, Mr. Mayor, my Brothers, my\r\n  Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nI am glad to be here to-day. I am glad to come as the guest of the\r\nBrotherhood. Let me join with you, the members of the Brotherhood\r\nof this country, in extending a most cordial welcome to our fellows\r\nfrom Canada and Mexico. The fact that we are good Americans only\r\nmakes us all the better men, all the more desirous of seeing good\r\nfortune to all mankind. I needed no pressing to accept the invitation\r\ntendered through you, Mr. Hannahan, and through Mr. Arnold, to come to\r\nthis meeting. I have always admired greatly the railroad men of the\r\ncountry, and I do not see how any one who believes in what I regard\r\nas the fundamental virtues of citizenship can fail to do so. I want\r\nto see the average American a good man, an honest man, and a man who\r\ncan handle himself, and does handle himself, well under difficulties.\r\nThe last time I ever saw General Sherman, I dined at his house, and\r\nwe got to talking over the capacity of different types of soldiers,\r\nand the General happened to say that if ever there were another war,\r\nand he were to have a command, he should endeavor to get as many\r\nrailway men as possible under him. I asked him why, and he said,\r\n“Because on account of their profession they have developed certain\r\nqualities which are essential in a soldier.” In the first place, they\r\nare accustomed to taking risks. There are a great many men who are\r\nnaturally brave, but who, being entirely unaccustomed to risks, are\r\nat first appalled by them. Railroad men are accustomed to enduring\r\nhardship; they are accustomed to irregular hours; they are accustomed\r\nto act on their own responsibility, on their own initiative, and yet\r\nthey are accustomed to obeying orders quickly. There is not anything\r\nmore soul-harrowing for a man in time of war, or for a man engaged in\r\na difficult job in time of peace, than to give an order and have the\r\ngentleman addressed say “What?” The railroad man has to learn that\r\nwhen an order is issued there may be but a fraction of a second in\r\nwhich to obey it. He has to learn that orders are to be obeyed, and,\r\non the other hand, that there will come plenty of crises in which\r\nthere will be no orders to be obeyed, and he will have to act for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThose are all qualities that go to the very essence of good\r\nsoldiership, and I am not surprised at what General Sherman said. In\r\nraising my own regiment, which was raised mainly in the Southwest,\r\npartly in the Territory in which Mr. Sargent himself served as a\r\nsoldier at one time—in Arizona—I got a number of railroad men. Of\r\ncourse, the first requisite was that a man should know how to shoot\r\nand how to ride. We were raising the regiment in a hurry, and we\r\ndid not have time to teach him either. He had to know how to handle\r\na horse and how to handle a rifle, to start with. But given the\r\npossession of those two qualities, I found that there was no group of\r\nour citizens from whom better men could be drawn to do a soldier’s\r\nwork in a tight place and at all times than the railroad men.\r\n\r\nBut, gentlemen, the period of war is but a fractional part of the life\r\nof our Republic, and I earnestly hope and believe that it will be an\r\neven smaller part in the future than it has been in the past. It was\r\nthe work that you have done in time of peace that especially attracted\r\nme to you, that made me anxious to come down here and see you, and\r\nthat made me glad to speak to you, not for what I can tell you, but\r\nfor the lesson it seems to me can be gained by all of our people from\r\nwhat you have done.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the twentieth century we face conditions vastly\r\nchanged from what they were in this country and throughout the world a\r\ncentury ago. Our complex industrial civilization under which progress\r\nhas been so rapid, and in which the changes for good have been so\r\ngreat, has also inevitably seen the growth of certain tendencies that\r\nare not for good, or at least that are not wholly for good; and we in\r\nconsequence, as a people, like the rest of civilized mankind, find\r\nset before us for solution during the coming century problems which\r\nneed the best thought of all of us, and the most earnest desire of all\r\nto solve them well if we expect to work out a solution satisfactory\r\nto our people, a solution for the advantage of the nation. In facing\r\nthese problems, it must be a comfort to every well-wisher of the\r\nnation to see what has been done by your organization. I believe\r\nemphatically in organized labor. I believe in organizations of\r\nwage-workers. Organization is one of the laws of our social and\r\neconomic development at this time. But I feel that we must always keep\r\nbefore our minds the fact that there is nothing sacred in the name\r\nitself. To call an organization an organization does not make it a\r\ngood one. The worth of an organization depends upon its being handled\r\nwith the courage, the skill, the wisdom, the spirit of fair dealing as\r\nbetween man and man, and the wise self-restraint which, I am glad to\r\nbe able to say, your Brotherhood has shown. You now number close upon\r\n44,000 members. During the two years ending June 30 last you paid in\r\nto the general and beneficiary funds close upon a million and a half\r\ndollars. More than six and one-half millions have been paid in since\r\nthe starting of the insurance clause in the constitution—have been\r\npaid to disabled members and their beneficiaries. Over fifty per cent\r\nof the amount paid was paid on account of accidents. Gentlemen, that\r\nis a sufficient commentary upon the kind of profession which is yours.\r\nYou face death and danger in time of peace, as in time of war the men\r\nwearing Uncle Sam’s uniform must face them.\r\n\r\nYour work is hard. Do you suppose I mention that because I pity you?\r\nNo; not a bit. I don’t pity any man who does hard work worth doing.\r\nI admire him. I pity the creature who doesn’t work, at whichever end\r\nof the social scale he may regard himself as being. The law of worthy\r\nwork well done is the law of successful American life. I believe in\r\nplay, too—play, and play hard while you play; but don’t make the\r\nmistake of thinking that that is the main thing. The work is what\r\ncounts, and if a man does his work well and it is worth doing, then it\r\nmatters but little in which line that work is done; the man is a good\r\nAmerican citizen. If he does his work in slip-shod fashion, then no\r\nmatter what kind of work it is, he is a poor American citizen.\r\n\r\nI speak to the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, but what I say\r\napplies to all railroad men—not only to the engineers who have served\r\nan apprenticeship as firemen, to the conductors, who, as a rule,\r\nhave served an apprenticeship as brakemen, but to all the men of all\r\nthe organizations connected with railroad work. I know you do not\r\ngrudge my saying that, through you, I am talking to all the railroad\r\nmen of the country. You, in your organization as railroad men, have\r\ntaught two lessons: the lesson of how much can be accomplished by\r\norganization, by mutual self-help of the type that helps another in\r\nthe only way by which, in the long run,—that is, by teaching him to\r\nhelp himself. You teach the benefits of organization, and you also\r\nteach the indispensable need of keeping absolutely unimpaired the\r\nfaculty of individual initiative, the faculty by which each man brings\r\nhimself to the highest point of perfection by exercising the special\r\nqualities with which he is himself endowed. The Brotherhood has\r\ndeveloped to this enormous extent since the days, now many years ago,\r\nwhen the first little band came together; and it has developed, not by\r\ncrushing out individual initiative, but by developing it, by combining\r\nmany individual initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe Brotherhood of Firemen does much for all firemen, but I firmly\r\nbelieve that the individual fireman since the growth of the\r\nBrotherhood has been more, not less, efficient than he was twenty\r\nyears ago. Membership in the Brotherhood comes, as I understand it,\r\nafter a nine months’ probationary period; after a man has shown his\r\nworth, he is then admitted and stands on his footing as a brother.\r\nNow, any man who enters with the purpose of letting the Brotherhood\r\ncarry him is not worth much. The man who counts in the Brotherhood\r\nis the man who pulls his own weight and a little more. Much can be\r\ndone by the Brotherhood. I have just hinted in the general figures I\r\ngave you, at how much has been done, but it still remains true in the\r\nBrotherhood, and everywhere else throughout American life, that in the\r\nlast resort nothing can supply the place of the man’s own individual\r\nqualities. We need those, no matter how perfect the organization is\r\noutside. There is just as much need of nerve, hardihood, power to face\r\nrisks and accept responsibilities, in the engineer and the fireman,\r\nwhether on a flyer or a freight train, now as there ever was. Much\r\ncan be done by the Association. A great deal can be accomplished by\r\nworking each for all and all for each; but we must not forget that the\r\nfirst requisite in accomplishing that is that each man should work for\r\nothers by working for himself, by developing his own capacity.\r\n\r\nThe steady way in which a man can rise is illustrated by a little\r\nthing that happened yesterday. I came down here over the Queen and\r\nCrescent Railroad, and the General Manager, who handled my train and\r\nwho handled yours, was Mr. Maguire. I used to know him in the old days\r\nwhen he was on his way up, and he began right at the bottom. He was\r\na fireman at one time. He worked his way straight up, and now he is\r\nGeneral Manager.\r\n\r\nI believe so emphatically in your organization because, while it\r\nteaches the need of working in union, of working in association, of\r\nworking with deep in our hearts, not merely on our lips, the sense of\r\nBrotherhood, yet of necessity it still keeps, as your organization\r\nalways must keep, to the forefront the worth of the individual\r\nqualities of a man. I said to you that I came here in a sense not to\r\nspeak to you, but to use your experience as an object-lesson for all\r\nof us, an object-lesson in good American citizenship. All professions,\r\nof course, do not call for the exercise to the same degree of the\r\nqualities of which I have spoken. Your profession is one of those\r\nwhich I am inclined to feel play in modern life a greater part from\r\nthe standpoint of character than we entirely realize. There is in\r\nmodern life, with the growth of civilization and luxury, a certain\r\ntendency to softening of the national fibre. There is a certain\r\ntendency to forget, in consequence of their disuse, the rugged virtues\r\nwhich lie at the back of manhood; and I feel that professions like\r\nyours, like the profession of the railroad men of the country, have a\r\ntonic effect upon the whole body politic.\r\n\r\nIt is a good thing that there should be a large body of our\r\nfellow-citizens—that there should be a profession—whose members must,\r\nyear in and year out, display those old, old qualities of courage,\r\ndaring, resolution, unflinching willingness to meet danger at need. I\r\nhope to see all our people develop the softer, gentler virtues to an\r\never increasing degree, but I hope never to see them lose the sterner\r\nvirtues that make men men.\r\n\r\nA man is not going to be a fireman or an engineer, or serve well in\r\nany other capacity on a railroad long if he has a “streak of yellow”\r\nin him. You are going to find it out, and he is going to be painfully\r\nconscious of it, very soon. It is a fine thing for our people that we\r\nshould have those qualities in evidence before us in the life-work of\r\na big group of our citizens.\r\n\r\nIn American citizenship, we can succeed permanently only upon the\r\nbasis of standing shoulder to shoulder, working in association, by\r\norganization, each working for all, and yet remembering that we need\r\neach so to shape things that each man can develop to best advantage\r\nall the forces and powers at his command. In your organization you\r\naccomplish much by means of the Brotherhood, but you accomplish it\r\nbecause of the men who go to make up that brotherhood.\r\n\r\nIf you had exactly the organization, exactly the laws, exactly the\r\nsystem, and yet were yourselves a poor set of men, the system would\r\nnot save you. I will guarantee that, from time to time, you have men\r\ngo in to try to serve for the nine months who prove that they do not\r\nhave the stuff in them out of which you can make good men. You have to\r\nhave the stuff in you, and, if you have the stuff, you can make out of\r\nit a much finer man by means of the association—but you must have the\r\nmaterial out of which to make it. So it is in citizenship.\r\n\r\nAnd now let me say a word, speaking not merely especially to the\r\nBrotherhood, but to all our citizens. Governor McMillan, Mr. Mayor: I\r\nfail to see how any American can come to Chattanooga and go over the\r\ngreat battle-fields in the neighborhood—the battle-fields here in this\r\nState and just across the border in my mother’s State of Georgia—how\r\nany American can come here and see evidences of the mighty deeds done\r\nby the men who wore the blue and the men who wore the gray, and not\r\ngo away a better American, prouder of the country, prouder because\r\nof the valor displayed on both sides in the contest—the valor, the\r\nself-devotion, the loyalty to the right as each side saw the right.\r\nYesterday I was presented with a cane cut from the Chickamauga\r\nbattle-field by some young men of Northern Georgia. On the cane were\r\nengraved the names of three Union generals and three Confederate\r\ngenerals. One of those Union generals was at that time showing me\r\nover the battle-field—General Boynton. Under one of the Confederate\r\ngenerals—General Wheeler—I myself served. In my regiment there served\r\nunder me in the ranks a son of General Hood, who commanded at one time\r\nthe Confederate army against General Sherman. The only captain whom\r\nI had the opportunity of promoting to field rank, and to whom the\r\npromotion was given for gallantry on the field, was Micah Jenkins, of\r\nSouth Carolina, the son of a Confederate general, whose name you will\r\nfind recorded among those who fought at Chickamauga.\r\n\r\nTwo of my best captains were killed at Santiago—one was Allyn Capron,\r\nthe fifth in line who, from father to son, had served in the regular\r\narmy of the United States, who had served in every war in which our\r\ncountry had been engaged; the other, Bucky O’Neill. His father had\r\nfought under Meagher when, on the day at Fredericksburg, his brigade\r\nleft more men under the stone wall than did any other brigade. I had\r\nin my regiment men from the North and the South; men from the East\r\nand the West; men whose fathers had fought under Grant, and whose\r\nfathers had fought under Lee; college graduates, capitalists’ sons,\r\nwage-workers, the man of means and the man who all his life had owed\r\neach day’s bread to the day’s toil. I had Catholic, Protestant, Jew,\r\nand Gentile under me. Among my captains were men whose forefathers\r\nhad been among the first white men to settle on Massachusetts Bay\r\nand on the banks of the James, and others whose parents had come\r\nfrom Germany, from Ireland, from England, from France. They were all\r\nAmericans, and nothing else, and each man stood on his worth as a man,\r\nto be judged by it, and to succeed or fail accordingly as he did well\r\nor ill. Compared to the giant death-wrestles that reeled over the\r\nmountains round about this city the fight at Santiago was the merest\r\nskirmish; but the spirit in which we handled ourselves there, I hope\r\nwas the spirit in which we have to face our duties as citizens if we\r\nare to make this Republic what it must be made.\r\n\r\nYesterday, in passing over the Chickamauga battle-field, I was\r\nimmensely struck by the monument raised by Kentucky to the Union and\r\nConfederate soldiers from Kentucky who fell on that battle-field.\r\nThe inscription reads as follows: “As we are united in life, and\r\nthey united in death, let one monument perpetuate their deeds, and\r\none people, forgetful of all asperities, forever hold in grateful\r\nremembrance all the glories of that terrible conflict which made all\r\nmen free and retained every star on the nation’s flag.” That is a good\r\nsentiment. That is a sentiment by which we can all stand. And oh, my\r\nfriends! what does that sentiment have as its underlying spirit? The\r\nspirit of brotherhood!\r\n\r\nI firmly believe in my countrymen, and therefore I believe that the\r\nchief thing necessary in order that they shall work together is\r\nthat they shall know one another—that the Northerner shall know the\r\nSoutherner, and the man of one occupation know the man of another\r\noccupation; the man who works in one walk of life know the man who\r\nworks in another walk of life, so that we may realize that the things\r\nwhich divide us are superficial, are unimportant, and that we are, and\r\nmust ever be, knit together into one indissoluble mass by our common\r\nAmerican brotherhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT DANVILLE, VA., SEPTEMBER 9, 1902\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nI did not expect to have the chance of speaking to any of you of\r\nVirginia on this trip. I only wish it had been my good fortune to\r\nbe able to go through your grand and beautiful historic State by\r\ndaylight. But you have not escaped me, gentlemen; I am going to come\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nYesterday and to-day I spent in Tennessee and North Carolina. I have\r\nenjoyed much those two days. It is a good thing for any American,\r\nand it is an especially good thing for the American who happens to\r\nbe President at any time, to go around in the country and meet his\r\nfellow-Americans of different sections and different States. The more\r\nhe sees of his fellow-Americans the more he will realize that the\r\ndifferences which divide them are trivial and that the likenesses\r\nwhich unite them are fundamental. A good American is a good American\r\nwherever he is, and a bad American is a poor one wherever he is. If\r\na man is a decent citizen, if he does his duty to his family, to his\r\nneighbors, to the State and the nation, as a decent man ought to, then\r\nhe is a man who has a right to claim kinship and comradeship with\r\nevery other decent American from one end of this country to the other.\r\nIf he is a straight man he is a credit to all of us, and if he is a\r\ncrooked man he is a disgrace to all of us. Fundamentally, for weal or\r\nfor woe, we are knit together; we shall go up or go down together. If\r\nhard times come they come without much regard to State lines. If good\r\ntimes come they come without regard to State lines. Wherever a deed is\r\ndone by an American which reflects credit upon our country, each of us\r\ncan walk with his head a little higher in consequence; and wherever\r\nanything happens through the fault of any of us that is discreditable\r\nit discredits all of us more or less.\r\n\r\nGentlemen and ladies, I thank you greatly for having come down here to\r\ngreet me. It is a genuine pleasure to see you. No man of the United\r\nStates, proud of the history of the United States, can fail to feel\r\ncertain associations of reverence and regard awakened when he treads\r\nthe soil of Virginia, which has taken so leading a part in peace and\r\nin war throughout our history.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT MUSIC HALL, CINCINNATI, OHIO, ON THE EVENING OF SEPTEMBER 20, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor, and you, my Fellow-Americans_:\r\n\r\nI shall ask your attention to what I say to-night, because I intend\r\nto make a perfectly serious argument to you, and I shall be obliged\r\nif you will remain as still as possible; and I ask that those at\r\nthe very back will remember that if they talk or make a noise it\r\ninterferes with the hearing of the rest. I intend to speak to you\r\non a serious subject and to make an argument as the Chief Executive\r\nof a nation, who is the President of all the people, without regard\r\nto party, without regard to section. I intend to make to you an\r\nargument from the standpoint simply of one American talking to his\r\nfellow-Americans upon one of the great subjects of interest to all\r\nalike; and that subject is what are commonly known as trusts. The word\r\nis used very loosely and almost always with technical inaccuracy.\r\nThe average man, however, when he speaks of the trusts means rather\r\nvaguely all of the very big corporations, the growth of which has been\r\nso signal a feature of our modern civilization, and especially those\r\nbig corporations which, though organized in one State, do business in\r\nseveral States, and often have a tendency to monopoly.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject of the trusts is of vital concern to us, because it\r\npresents one, and perhaps the most conspicuous, of the many problems\r\nforced upon our attention by the tremendous industrial development\r\nwhich has taken place during the last century, a development which\r\nis occurring in all civilized countries, notably in our own. There\r\nhave been many factors responsible for bringing about these changed\r\nconditions. Of these, steam and electricity are the chief. The\r\nextraordinary changes in the methods of transportation of merchandise\r\nand of transmission of news have rendered not only possible, but\r\ninevitable, the immense increase in the rate of growth of our great\r\nindustrial centres—that is, of our great cities. I want you to bring\r\nhome to yourselves that fact. When Cincinnati was founded news could\r\nbe transmitted and merchandise carried exactly as has been the\r\ncase in the days of the Roman Empire. You had here on your river\r\nthe flat-boat, you had on the ocean the sailing-ship, you had the\r\npack-train, you had the wagon, and every one of the four was known\r\nwhen Babylon fell. The change in the last hundred years has been\r\ngreater by far than the changes in all the preceding three thousand.\r\nThose are the facts. Because of them have resulted the specialization\r\nof industries, and the unexampled opportunities offered for the\r\nemployment of huge amounts of capital, and therefore for the rise\r\nin the business world of those master-minds through whom alone it\r\nis possible for such vast amounts of capital to be employed with\r\nprofit. It matters very little whether we like these new conditions\r\nor whether we dislike them; whether we like the creation of these new\r\nopportunities or not. Many admirable qualities which were developed\r\nin the older, simpler, less progressive life have tended to atrophy\r\nunder our rather feverish, high-pressure, complex life of to-day.\r\nBut our likes and dislikes have nothing to do with the matter. The\r\nnew conditions are here. You can’t bring back the old days of the\r\ncanalboat and stagecoach if you wish. The steamboat and the railroad\r\nare here. The new forces have produced both good and evil. We can not\r\nget rid of them—even if it were not undesirable to get rid of them;\r\nand our instant duty is to try to accommodate our social, economic and\r\nlegislative life to them, and to frame a system of law and conduct\r\nunder which we shall get out of them the utmost possible benefit and\r\nthe least possible amount of harm. It is foolish to pride ourselves\r\nupon our progress and prosperity, upon our commanding position in the\r\ninternational industrial world, and at the same time have nothing but\r\ndenunciation for the men to whose commanding position we in part owe\r\nthis very progress and prosperity, this commanding position.\r\n\r\nWhenever great social or industrial changes take place, no matter\r\nhow much good there may be to them, there is sure to be some evil;\r\nand it usually takes mankind a number of years and a good deal of\r\nexperimenting before they find the right ways in which so far as\r\npossible to control the new evil, without at the same time nullifying\r\nthe new good. I am stating facts so obvious that if each one of\r\nyou will think them over you will think them trite, but if you read\r\nor listen to some of the arguments advanced, you will come to the\r\nconclusion that there is need of learning these trite truths. In these\r\ncircumstances the effort to bring the new tendencies to a standstill\r\nis always futile and generally mischievous; but it is possible\r\nsomewhat to develop them aright. Law can to a degree guide, protect\r\nand control industrial development, but it can never cause it, or play\r\nmore than a subordinate part in its healthy development—unfortunately\r\nit is easy enough by bad laws to bring it to an almost complete stop.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the big corporations which we call trusts, we must\r\nresolutely purpose to proceed by evolution and not revolution. We\r\nwish to face the facts, declining to have our vision blinded either\r\nby the folly of those who say there are no evils, or by the more\r\ndangerous folly of those who either see, or make believe that they\r\nsee, nothing but evil in all the existing system, and who if given\r\ntheir way would destroy the evil by the simple process of bringing\r\nruin and disaster to the entire country. The evils attendant upon\r\nover-capitalization alone are, in my judgment, sufficient to warrant\r\na far closer supervision and control than now exists over the great\r\ncorporations. Wherever a substantial monopoly can be shown to exist\r\nwe should certainly try our utmost to devise an expedient by which it\r\ncan be controlled. Doubtless some of the evils existing in or because\r\nof the great corporations can not be cured by any legislation which\r\nhas yet been proposed, and doubtless others, which have really been\r\nincident to the sudden development in the formation of corporations\r\nof all kinds, will in the end cure themselves. But there will remain\r\na certain number which can be cured if we decide that by the power of\r\nthe Government they are to be cured. The surest way to prevent the\r\npossibility of curing any of them is to approach the subject in a\r\nspirit of violent rancor, complicated with total ignorance of business\r\ninterests and fundamental incapacity or unwillingness to understand\r\nthe limitations upon all law-making bodies. No problem, and least of\r\nall so difficult a problem as this, can be solved if the qualities\r\nbrought to its solution are panic, fear, envy, hatred, and ignorance.\r\nThere can exist in a free republic no man more wicked, no man more\r\ndangerous to the people, than he who would arouse these feelings in\r\nthe hope that they would redound to his own political advantage.\r\nCorporations that are handled honestly and fairly, so far from being\r\nan evil, are a natural business evolution and make for the general\r\nprosperity of our land. We do not wish to destroy corporations, but we\r\ndo wish to make them subserve the public good. All individuals, rich\r\nor poor, private or corporate, must be subject to the law of the land;\r\nand the government will hold them to a rigid obedience thereof. The\r\nbiggest corporation, like the humblest private citizen, must be held\r\nto strict compliance with the will of the people as expressed in the\r\nfundamental law. The rich man who does not see that this is in his\r\ninterest is indeed short-sighted. When we make him obey the law we\r\nensure for him the absolute protection of the law.\r\n\r\nThe savings banks show what can be done in the way of genuinely\r\nbeneficent work by large corporations when intelligently administered\r\nand supervised. They now hold over twenty-six hundred millions of the\r\npeople’s money and pay annually about one hundred millions of interest\r\nor profit to their depositors. There is no talk of danger from these\r\ncorporations; yet they possess great power, holding over three times\r\nthe amount of our present national debt, more than all the currency,\r\ngold, silver, greenbacks, etc., in circulation in the United States.\r\nThe chief reason for there being no talk of danger from them is that\r\nthey are on the whole faithfully administered for the benefit of all,\r\nunder wise laws which require frequent and full publication of their\r\ncondition, and which prescribe certain needful regulations with which\r\nthey have to comply, while at the same time giving full scope for the\r\nbusiness enterprise of their managers within these limits.\r\n\r\nNow of course savings banks are as highly specialized a class of\r\ncorporations as railroads, and we can not force too far the analogy\r\nwith other corporations; but there are certain conditions which I\r\nthink we can lay down as indispensable to the proper treatment of all\r\ncorporations which from their size have become important factors in\r\nthe social development of the community.\r\n\r\nBefore speaking, however, of what can be done by way of remedy let\r\nme say a word or two as to certain proposed remedies which, in my\r\njudgment, would be ineffective or mischievous. The first thing to\r\nremember is that if we are to accomplish any good at all it must be\r\nby resolutely keeping in mind the intention to do away with any evils\r\nin the conduct of big corporations, while steadfastly refusing to\r\nassent to indiscriminate assault upon all forms of corporate capital\r\nas such. The line of demarcation we draw must always be on conduct,\r\nnot upon wealth; our objection to any given corporation must be, not\r\nthat it is big, but that it behaves badly. Perfectly simple again, my\r\nfriends, but not always heeded by some of those who would strive to\r\nteach us how to act toward big corporations. Treat the head of the\r\ncorporation as you would treat all other men. If he does well stand\r\nby him. You will occasionally find the head of a big corporation who\r\nobjects to that treatment; very good, apply it all the more carefully.\r\nRemember, after all, that he who objects because he is the head of a\r\nbig corporation to being treated like any one else is only guilty of\r\nthe same sin as the man who wishes him treated worse than any one else\r\nbecause he is the head of a big corporation. Demagogic denunciation of\r\nwealth is never wholesome and is generally dangerous; and not a few\r\nof the proposed methods of curbing the trusts are dangerous chiefly\r\nbecause all insincere advocacy of the impossible is dangerous. It is\r\nan unhealthy thing for a community when the appeal is made to follow\r\na course which those who make the appeal either do know, or ought to\r\nknow, can not be followed; and which, if followed, would result in\r\ndisaster to everybody. Loose talk about destroying monopoly out of\r\nhand without a hint as to how the monopoly should even be defined\r\noffers a case in point.\r\n\r\nNor can we afford to tolerate any proposal which will strike at the\r\nso-called trusts only by striking at the general well-being. We are\r\nnow enjoying a period of great prosperity. The prosperity is generally\r\ndiffused through all sections and through all classes. Doubtless there\r\nare some individuals who do not get enough of it, and there are others\r\nwho get too much. That is simply another way of saying that the wisdom\r\nof mankind is finite; and that even the best human system does not\r\nwork perfectly. You don’t have to take my word for that. Look back\r\njust nine years. In 1893 nobody was concerned in downing the trusts.\r\nEverybody was concerned in trying to get up himself. The men who\r\npropose to get rid of the evils of the trusts by measures which would\r\ndo away with the general well-being, advocate a policy which would\r\nnot only be a damage to the community as a whole, but which would\r\ndefeat its own professed object. If we are forced to the alternative\r\nof choosing either a system under which most of us prosper somewhat,\r\nthough a few of us prosper too much, or else a system under which\r\nno one prospers enough, of course we will choose the former. If the\r\npolicy advocated is so revolutionary and destructive as to involve\r\nthe whole community in the crash of common disaster, it is as certain\r\nas anything can be that when the disaster has occurred all efforts\r\nto regulate the trusts will cease, and that the one aim will be to\r\nrestore prosperity.\r\n\r\nA remedy much advocated at the moment is to take off the tariff\r\nfrom all articles which are made by trusts. To do this it will be\r\nnecessary first to define trusts. The language commonly used by the\r\nadvocates of the method implies that they mean all articles made by\r\nlarge corporations, and that the changes in tariff are to be made\r\nwith punitive intent toward these large corporations. Of course if\r\nthe tariff is to be changed in order to punish them, it should be\r\nchanged so as to punish those that do ill, not merely those that are\r\nprosperous. It would be neither just nor expedient to punish the big\r\ncorporations as big corporations; what we wish to do is to protect\r\nthe people from any evil that may grow out of their existence or\r\nmaladministration. Some of those corporations do well and others do\r\nill. If in any case the tariff is found to foster a monopoly which\r\ndoes ill, of course no protectionist would object to a modification\r\nof the tariff sufficient to remedy the evil. But in very few cases\r\ndoes the so-called trust really monopolize the market. Take any very\r\nbig corporation—I could mention them by the score—which controls,\r\nsay, something in the neighborhood of half of the products of a given\r\nindustry. It is the kind of corporation that is always spoken of\r\nas a trust. Surely in rearranging the schedules affecting such a\r\ncorporation it would be necessary to consider the interests of its\r\nsmaller competitors which control the remaining part, and which,\r\nbeing weaker, would suffer most from any tariff designed to punish\r\nall the producers; for, of course, the tariff must be made light or\r\nheavy for big and little producers alike. Moreover, such a corporation\r\nnecessarily employs very many thousands, often very many tens of\r\nthousands of workmen, and the minute we proceeded from denunciation\r\nto action it would be necessary to consider the interests of these\r\nworkmen. Furthermore, the products of many trusts are unprotected, and\r\nwould be entirely unaffected by any change in the tariff, or at most\r\nvery slightly so. The Standard Oil Company offers a case in point;\r\nand the corporations which control the anthracite coal output offer\r\nanother—for there is no duty whatever on anthracite coal.\r\n\r\nI am not now discussing the question of the tariff as such; whether\r\nfrom the standpoint of the fundamental difference between those who\r\nbelieve in a protective tariff and those who believe in free trade; or\r\nfrom the standpoint of those who, while they believe in a protective\r\ntariff, feel that there could be a rearrangement of our schedules,\r\neither by direct legislation or by reciprocity treaties, which would\r\nresult in enlarging our markets; nor yet from the standpoint of those\r\nwho feel that stability of economic policy is at the moment our prime\r\neconomic need, and that the benefits to be derived from any change\r\nin schedules would not compensate for the damage to business caused\r\nby the widespread agitation which would follow any attempted general\r\nrevision of the tariff at this moment. Without regard to the wisdom\r\nof any one of those three positions it remains true that the real\r\nevils connected with the trusts can not be remedied by any change\r\nin the tariff laws. The trusts can be damaged by depriving them of\r\nthe benefits of a protective tariff, only on condition of damaging\r\nall their smaller competitors, and all the wage-workers employed in\r\nthe industry. This point is very important, and it is desirable to\r\navoid any misunderstanding concerning it. I am not now considering\r\nwhether or not, on grounds totally unconnected with the trusts, it\r\nwould be well to lower the duties on various schedules, either by\r\ndirect legislation or by legislation or treaties designed to secure\r\nas an offset reciprocal advantages from the nations with which we\r\ntrade. My point is that changes in the tariff would have little\r\nappreciable effect on the trusts save as they shared in the general\r\nharm or good proceeding from such changes. No tariff change would help\r\none of our smaller corporations, or one of our private individuals\r\nin business, still less one of our wage-workers, as against a large\r\ncorporation in the same business; on the contrary, if it bore heavily\r\non the large corporation it would inevitably be felt still more by\r\nthat corporation’s weaker rivals, while any injurious result would\r\nof necessity be shared by both the employer and the employed in the\r\nbusiness concerned. The immediate introduction of substantial free\r\ntrade in all articles manufactured by trusts, that is, by the largest\r\nand most successful corporations, would not affect some of the most\r\npowerful of our business combinations in the least, save by the damage\r\ndone to the general business welfare of the country; others would\r\nundoubtedly be seriously affected, but much less so than their weaker\r\nrivals, while the loss would be divided between the capitalists and\r\nthe laborers; and after the years of panic and distress had been\r\nlived through, and some return to prosperity had occurred, even\r\nthough all were on a lower plane of prosperity than before, the\r\nrelative difference between the trusts and their rivals would remain\r\nas marked as ever. In other words, the trust, or big corporation,\r\nwould have suffered relatively to, and in the interest of, its foreign\r\ncompetitor; but its relative position toward its American competitors\r\nwould probably be improved; little would have been done toward cutting\r\nout or minimizing the evils in the trusts; nothing toward securing\r\nadequate control and regulation of the large modern corporations. In\r\nother words, the question of regulating the trusts with a view to\r\nminimizing or abolishing the evils existent in them is separate and\r\napart from the question of tariff revision.\r\n\r\nYou must face the fact that only harm will come from a proposition\r\nto attack the so-called trusts in a vindictive spirit by measures\r\nconceived solely with a desire of hurting them, without regard as to\r\nwhether or not discrimination should be made between the good and\r\nevil in them, and without even any regard as to whether a necessary\r\nsequence of the action would be the hurting of other interests.\r\nThe adoption of such a policy would mean temporary damage to the\r\ntrusts, because it would mean temporary damage to all of our business\r\ninterests; but the effect would be only temporary, for exactly as the\r\ndamage affected all alike, good and bad, so the reaction would affect\r\nall alike, good and bad. The necessary supervision and control, in\r\nwhich I firmly believe as the only method of eliminating the real\r\nevils of the trusts, must come through wisely and cautiously framed\r\nlegislation, which shall aim in the first place to give definite\r\ncontrol to some sovereign over the great corporations, and which shall\r\nbe followed, when once this power has been conferred, by a system\r\ngiving to the Government the full knowledge which is the essential for\r\nsatisfactory action. Then when this knowledge—one of the essential\r\nfeatures of which is proper publicity—has been gained, what further\r\nsteps of any kind are necessary can be taken with the confidence born\r\nof the possession of power to deal with the subject, and of a thorough\r\nknowledge of what should and can be done in the matter.\r\n\r\nWe need additional power; and we need knowledge. Our Constitution was\r\nframed when the economic conditions were so different that each State\r\ncould wisely be left to handle the corporations within its limits\r\nas it saw fit. Nowadays all the corporations which I am considering\r\ndo what is really an interstate business, and as the States have\r\nproceeded on very different lines in regulating them, at present a\r\ncorporation will be organized in one State, not because it intends to\r\ndo business in that State, but because it does not, and therefore that\r\nState can give it better privileges, and then it will do business in\r\nsome other States, and will claim not to be under the control of the\r\nStates in which it does business; and of course it is not the object\r\nof the State creating it to exercise any control over it, as it does\r\nnot do any business in that State. Such a system can not obtain. There\r\nmust be some sovereign. It might be better if all the States could\r\nagree along the same lines in dealing with these corporations, but\r\nI see not the slightest prospect of such an agreement. Therefore, I\r\npersonally feel that ultimately the nation will have to assume the\r\nresponsibility of regulating these very large corporations which do an\r\ninterstate business. The States must combine to meet the way in which\r\ncapital has combined; and the way in which the States can combine is\r\nthrough the National Government. But I firmly believe that all these\r\nobstacles can be met if only we face them, both with the determination\r\nto overcome them, and with the further determination to overcome them\r\nin ways which shall not do damage to the country as a whole; which on\r\nthe contrary shall further our industrial development, and shall help\r\ninstead of hindering all corporations which work out their success by\r\nmeans that are just and fair toward all men.\r\n\r\nWithout the adoption of a constitutional amendment, my belief is that\r\na good deal can be done by law. It is difficult to say exactly how\r\nmuch, because experience has taught us that in dealing with these\r\nsubjects, where the lines dividing the rights and duties of the States\r\nand of the Nation are in doubt, it has sometimes been difficult for\r\nCongress to forecast the action of the courts upon its legislation.\r\nSuch legislation (whether obtainable now, or obtainable only after a\r\nconstitutional amendment) should provide for a reasonable supervision,\r\nthe most prominent feature of which at first should be publicity; that\r\nis, the making public, both to the governmental authorities and to the\r\npeople at large, the essential facts in which the public is concerned.\r\nThis would give us exact knowledge of many points which are now not\r\nonly in doubt, but the subject of fierce controversy. Moreover, the\r\nmere fact of the publication would cure some very grave evils, for the\r\nlight of day is a deterrent to wrongdoing. It would doubtless disclose\r\nother evils with which, for the time being, we could devise no way to\r\ngrapple. Finally, it would disclose others which could be grappled\r\nwith and cured by further legislative action.\r\n\r\nRemember, I advocate the action which the President can only advise,\r\nand which he has no power himself to take. Under our present\r\nlegislative and constitutional limitations the national executive\r\ncan work only between narrow lines in the field of action concerning\r\ngreat corporations. Between those lines, I assure you that exact and\r\neven-handed justice will be dealt, and is being dealt, to all men,\r\nwithout regard to persons.\r\n\r\nI wish to repeat with all emphasis that desirable though it is that\r\nthe nation should have the power I suggest, it is equally desirable\r\nthat it should be used with wisdom and self-restraint. The mechanism\r\nof modern business is tremendous in its size and complexity, and\r\nignorant intermeddling with it would be disastrous. We should not be\r\nmade timid or daunted by the size of the problem; we should not fear\r\nto undertake it; but we should undertake it with ever-present in our\r\nminds dread of the sinister spirits of rancor, ignorance, and vanity.\r\nWe need to keep steadily in mind the fact that besides the tangible\r\nproperty in each corporation there lies behind the spirit which brings\r\nit success, and in the case of each very successful corporation this\r\nis usually the spirit of some one man or set of men. Under exactly\r\nsimilar conditions one corporation will make a stupendous success\r\nwhere another makes a stupendous failure, simply because one is well\r\nmanaged and the other is not. While making it clear that we do not\r\nintend to allow wrongdoing by one of the captains of industry any more\r\nthan by the humblest private in the industrial ranks, we must also\r\nin the interests of all of us avoid cramping a strength which, if\r\nbeneficently used, will be for the good of all of us. The marvelous\r\nprosperity we have been enjoying for the past few years has been\r\ndue primarily to the high average of honesty, thrift, and business\r\ncapacity among our people as a whole; but some of it has also been\r\ndue to the ability of the men who are the industrial leaders of the\r\nnation. In securing just and fair dealing by these men let us remember\r\nto do them justice in return, and this not only because it is our\r\nduty, but because it is our interest; not only for their sakes, but\r\nfor ours. We are neither the friend of the rich man as such, nor the\r\nfriend of the poor man as such; we are the friend of the honest man,\r\nrich or poor; and we intend that all men, rich and poor alike, shall\r\nobey the law alike and receive its protection alike.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE BANQUET OF THE SPANISH WAR VETERANS, DETROIT, MICH., SEPTEMBER\r\n22, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor, and you, my Comrades, and all of you, my\r\n  Fellow-Americans, Men and Women of Detroit_:\r\n\r\nWhile the war with Spain was easy enough, the tasks left behind,\r\nthough glorious, have been hard. You, the men of the Spanish War, and\r\nyour comrades in arms who fought in Cuba and Porto Rico and in the\r\nPhilippines, won renown for the country, added to its moral grandeur\r\nand to its material prosperity; but you also left duties to be done\r\nby those who came after you. In Porto Rico the duty has been merely\r\nadministrative, and it has been so well done that very little need be\r\nsaid about it.\r\n\r\nI speak in the presence not only of the men who fought in the Spanish\r\nWar and in the Philippine War, which was its aftermath, but in the\r\npresence of those who fought in the great Civil War; and more than\r\nthat, I speak here in a typical city of the old Northwest, what is now\r\nthe Middle West, in a typical State of our Union. You men of Michigan\r\nhave been mighty in war and mighty in peace. You belong to a country\r\nmighty in war and mighty in peace—a country of a great past, whose\r\ngreat present is but an earnest of an even greater future. The world\r\nhas never seen more marvelous prosperity than that which we now enjoy,\r\nand this prosperity is not ephemeral. We shall have our ups and downs.\r\nThe waves at times will recede, but the tide will go steadily higher.\r\nThis country has never yet been called upon to meet a crisis in war\r\nor a crisis in peace to which it did not eventually prove equal. I\r\npreach the gospel of hope to you men of the West who in thought and\r\nlife embody this gospel of hope, this gospel of resolute and confident\r\nbelief in your own powers and in the destiny of this mighty Republic.\r\nI believe in the future—not in a spirit which will sit down and look\r\nfor the future to work itself out—but with a determination to do\r\nits part in making the future what it can and shall be made. We are\r\noptimists. We spurn the teachings of despair and distrust. We have\r\nan abiding faith in the growing strength, the growing future of the\r\nmighty young nation, still in the flush of its youth, and yet with the\r\nmight of a giant, which stands on a continent and grasps an ocean with\r\neither hand.\r\n\r\nSucceed? Of course we shall succeed! How can success fail to come to\r\na race of masterful energy and resoluteness, which has a continent\r\nfor the base of its domain, and which feels within its veins the\r\nthrill that comes to generous souls when their strength stirs in\r\nthem, and they know that the future is theirs? No great destiny\r\never yet came to a people walking with their eyes on the ground and\r\ntheir faces shrouded in gloom. No great destiny ever yet came to a\r\npeople who feared the future, who feared failure more than they hoped\r\nfor success. With such as these we have no part. We know there are\r\ndangers ahead, as we know there are evils to fight and overcome,\r\nbut we feel to the full the pulse of the prosperity which we enjoy.\r\nStout of heart, we see across the dangers the great future that lies\r\nbeyond, and we rejoice as a giant refreshed, as a strong man girt\r\nfor the race; and we go down into the arena where the nations strive\r\nfor mastery, our hearts lifted with the faith that to us and to our\r\nchildren and our children’s children it shall be given to make this\r\nRepublic the mightiest among the peoples of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT LOGANSPORT, IND., SEPTEMBER 23, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nI am going to ask you to take what I say at its exact face value, as\r\nI like whatever I say to be taken. It is suggested by coming to this\r\ngreat Western State and speaking to one of its thriving cities. We\r\nbelieve that the American business man is of a peculiar type; and\r\nprobably the qualities of energy, daring, and resourcefulness which\r\nhave given him his prominence in the international industrial world\r\nfind their highest development here in the West. It is the merest\r\ntruism to say that in the modern world industrialism is the great\r\nfactor in the growth of nations. Material prosperity is the foundation\r\nupon which every mighty national structure must be built. Of course\r\nthere must be more than this. There must be a high moral purpose,\r\na life of the spirit which finds its expression in many different\r\nways; but unless material prosperity exists also there is scant room\r\nin which to develop the higher life. The productive activity of our\r\nvast army of workers, of those who work with head or hands, is the\r\nprime cause of the giant growth of this nation. We have great natural\r\nresources, but such resources are never more than opportunities, and\r\nthey count for nothing if the men in possession have not the power to\r\ntake advantage of them. You have built up in the West these cities of\r\nthe Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes; as all the region round\r\nabout them has been built up—that is, because you had the qualities\r\nof heart and brain, the qualities of moral and physical fibre, which\r\nenabled you to use to the utmost advantage whatever you found ready to\r\nyour hands. You win, not by shirking difficulties, but by facing and\r\novercoming them.\r\n\r\nIn such development laws play a certain part, but individual\r\ncharacteristics a still greater part. A great and successful\r\ncommonwealth like ours in the long run works under good laws, because\r\na people endowed with honest and practical common-sense ultimately\r\ndemands good laws. But no law can create industrial well-being,\r\nalthough it may foster and safeguard it, and although a bad law may\r\ndestroy it. The prime factor in securing industrial well-being is the\r\nhigh average of citizenship found in the community. The best laws that\r\nthe wit of man can devise would not make a community of thriftless and\r\nidle men prosperous. No scheme of legislation or of social reform will\r\never work good to the community unless it recognizes as fundamental\r\nthe fact that each man’s own individual qualities must be the prime\r\nfactors in his success. Work in combination may help and the State\r\ncan do a good deal in its own sphere, but in the long run each man\r\nmust rise or fall on his own merits; each man must owe his success in\r\nlife to whatever of hardihood, of resolution, of common-sense and of\r\ncapacity for lofty endeavor he has within his own soul. It is a good\r\nthing to act in combination for the common good, but it is a very\r\nunhealthy thing to let ourselves think for one moment that anything\r\ncan ever supply the want of our own individual watchfulness and\r\nexertion.\r\n\r\nYet given this high average of individual ability and invention, we\r\nmust ever keep in mind that it may be nullified by bad legislation,\r\nand that it can be given a chance to develop under the most favorable\r\nconditions by good legislation. Probably the most important aid\r\nwhich can be contributed by the National Government to the material\r\nwell-being of the country is to ensure its financial stability. An\r\nhonest currency is the strongest symbol and expression of honest\r\nbusiness life. The business world must exist largely on credit, and\r\nto credit confidence is essential. Any tampering with the currency,\r\nno matter with what purpose, if fraught with the suspicion of\r\ndishonesty, in result is fatal in its effects on business prosperity.\r\nVery ignorant and primitive communities are continually obliged to\r\nlearn the elementary truth that the repudiation of debts is in the end\r\nruinous to the debtors as a class; and when communities have moved\r\nsomewhat higher in the scale of civilization they also learn that\r\nanything in the nature of a debased currency works similar damage. A\r\nfinancial system of assured honesty is the first essential.\r\n\r\nAnother essential for any community is perseverance in the economic\r\npolicy which for a course of years is found best fitted to its\r\npeculiar needs. The question of combining such fixedness of economic\r\npolicy as regards the tariff, while at the same time allowing for a\r\nnecessary and proper readjustment of duties in particular schedules,\r\nas such readjustment becomes a matter of pressing importance, is not\r\nan easy one. It is perhaps too much to expect that from the discussion\r\nof such a question it would be possible wholly to eliminate political\r\npartisanship. Yet those who believe, as we all must when we think\r\nseriously of the subject, that the proper aim of the party system\r\nis after all simply to subserve the public good, can not but hope\r\nthat where such partisanship on a matter of this kind conflicts with\r\nthe public good it shall at least be minimized. It is all right and\r\ninevitable that we should divide on party lines, but woe to us if we\r\nare not Americans first, and party men second. What we really need\r\nin this country is to treat the tariff as a business proposition\r\nfrom the standpoint of the interests of the country as a whole, and\r\nnot from the standpoint of the temporary needs of any political\r\nparty. It surely ought not to be necessary to dwell upon the extreme\r\nunwisdom, from a business standpoint, from the standpoint of national\r\nprosperity, of violent and radical changes amounting to the direct\r\nupsetting of tariff policies at intervals of every few years. A nation\r\nlike ours can adjust its business after a fashion to any kind of\r\ntariff. But neither our nation nor any other can stand the ruinous\r\npolicy of readjusting its business to radical changes in the tariff at\r\nshort intervals. This is more true now than ever it was before, for\r\nowing to the immense extent and variety of our products, the tariff\r\nschedules of to-day carry rates of duty on more than four thousand\r\narticles. Continual sweeping changes in such a tariff, touching so\r\nintimately the commercial interests of the nation which stands as one\r\nof the two or three greatest in the whole industrial world, can not\r\nbut be disastrous. Yet on the other hand where the industrial needs\r\nof the nation shift as rapidly as they do with us, it is a matter\r\nof prime importance that we should be able to readjust our economic\r\npolicy as rapidly as possible and with as little friction as possible\r\nto these needs.\r\n\r\nWe need a scheme which will enable us to provide a reapplication of\r\nthe principle to the changed conditions. The problem therefore is to\r\ndevise some method by which these shifting needs can be recognized\r\nand the necessary readjustments of duties provided without forcing\r\nthe entire business community, and therefore the entire nation, to\r\nsubmit to a violent surgical operation, the mere threat of which, and\r\nstill more the accomplished fact of which, would probably paralyze\r\nfor a considerable time all the industries of the country. Such a\r\nradical action might very readily reproduce the conditions from\r\nwhich we suffered nine years ago, in 1893. It is on every account\r\nmost earnestly to be hoped that this problem can be solved in some\r\nmanner into which partisanship shall enter as a purely secondary\r\nconsideration, if at all; that is, in some manner which shall provide\r\nfor an earnest effort by non-partisan inquiry and action to secure any\r\nchanges the need of which is indicated by the effect found to proceed\r\nfrom a given rate of duty on a given article; its effect, if any,\r\nas regards the creation of a substantial monopoly; its effect upon\r\ndomestic prices, upon the revenue of the government, upon importations\r\nfrom abroad, upon home productions, and upon consumption. In other\r\nwords, we need to devise some machinery by which, while persevering\r\nin the policy of a protective tariff, in which I think the nation\r\nas a whole has now generally acquiesced, we would be able to correct\r\nthe irregularities and remove the incongruities produced by changing\r\nconditions, without destroying the whole structure. Such machinery\r\nwould permit us to continue our definitely settled tariff policy,\r\nwhile providing for the changes in duties upon particular schedules\r\nwhich must inevitably and necessarily take place from time to time as\r\nmatters of legislative and administrative detail. This would secure\r\nthe needed stability of economic policy which is a prime factor\r\nin our industrial success, while doing away with any tendency to\r\nfossilization. It would recognize the fact that, as our needs shift,\r\nit may be found advisable to alter rates and schedules, adapting them\r\nto the changed conditions and necessities of the whole people; and\r\nthis would be in no wise incompatible with preserving the principle of\r\nprotection, for belief in the wisdom of a protective tariff is in no\r\nway inconsistent with frankly admitting the desirability of changing a\r\nset of schedules, when from any cause such change is in the interests\r\nof the nation as a whole—and our tariff policy is designed to favor\r\nthe interests of the nation as a whole and not those of any particular\r\nset of individuals save as an incident to this building up of national\r\nwell-being. There are two or three different methods by which it\r\nwill be possible to provide such readjustment without any shock\r\nto the business world. My personal preference would be for action\r\nwhich should be taken only after preliminary inquiry by and upon\r\nthe findings of a body of experts of such high character and ability\r\nthat they could be trusted to deal with the subject purely from the\r\nstandpoint of our business and industrial needs; but, of course,\r\nCongress would have to determine for itself the exact method to be\r\nfollowed. The Executive has at its command the means for gathering\r\nmost of the necessary data, and can act whenever it is the desire\r\nof Congress that it should act. That the machinery for carrying out\r\nthe policy above outlined can be provided I am very certain, if only\r\nour people will make up their minds that the health of the community\r\nwill be subserved by treating the whole question primarily from the\r\nstandpoint of the business interests of the entire country, rather\r\nthan from the standpoint of the fancied interests of any group of\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nOf course in making any changes we should have to proceed in\r\naccordance with certain fixed and definite principles, and the most\r\nimportant of these is an avowed determination to protect the interests\r\nof the American producer, be he business man, wage-worker, or farmer.\r\nThe one consideration which must never be omitted in a tariff change\r\nis the imperative need of preserving the American standard of living\r\nfor the American workingman. The tariff rate must never fall below\r\nthat which will protect the American workingman by allowing for the\r\ndifference between the general labor cost here and abroad, so as at\r\nleast to equalize the conditions arising from the difference in the\r\nstandard of labor here and abroad—a difference which it should be our\r\naim to foster in so far as it represents the needs of better educated,\r\nbetter paid, better fed, and better clothed workingmen of a higher\r\ntype than any to be found in a foreign country. At all hazards, and\r\nno matter what else is sought for or accomplished by changes of the\r\ntariff, the American workingman must be protected in his standard of\r\nwages, that is, in his standard of living, and must be secured the\r\nfullest opportunity of employment. Our laws should in no event afford\r\nadvantage to foreign industries over American industries. They should\r\nin no event do less than equalize the difference in conditions at home\r\nand abroad. The general tariff policy to which, without regard to\r\nchanges in detail, I believe this country to be irrevocably committed,\r\nis fundamentally based upon ample recognition of the difference in\r\nlabor cost here and abroad; in other words, the recognition of the\r\nneed for full development of the intelligence, the comfort, the high\r\nstandard of civilized living and the inventive genius of the American\r\nworkingman as compared to the workingman of any other country in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE BANQUET OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AT\r\nNEW YORK, NOVEMBER 11, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President, Gentlemen, and you, the Guests, whom we welcome here\r\n  this evening_:\r\n\r\nI do not wish to speak to you in the language of idle compliment,\r\nand yet it is but a bare statement of fact to say that nowhere in\r\nour country could there be gathered an audience which would stand as\r\nmore typically characteristic than this of all those qualities and\r\nattributes which have given us of the United States our commanding\r\nposition in the industrial world. There is no need of my preaching to\r\nthis gathering the need of combining efficiency with upright dealing,\r\nfor as an American and as a citizen of New York I am proud to feel\r\nthat the name of your organization carries with it a guarantee of\r\nboth; and your practice counts for more than any preaching could\r\npossibly count. New York is a city of national importance, because its\r\nposition toward the Nation is unique, and the Chamber of Commerce of\r\nNew York must of necessity be an element of weight in the commercial\r\nand industrial welfare of the entire people. New York is the great\r\nport of entry for our country—the port in which centres the bulk of\r\nthe foreign commerce of the country—and her welfare is therefore no\r\nmatter of mere local or municipal, but of national, concern. The\r\nconduct of the Government in dealing with all matters affecting the\r\nfinancial and commercial relations of New York must continually\r\ntake into account this fact; and it must be taken into account in\r\nappreciating the importance of the part played by the New York Chamber\r\nof Commerce.\r\n\r\nThis body stands for the triumphs of peace both abroad and at home.\r\nWe have passed that stage of national development when depreciation\r\nof other peoples is felt as a tribute to our own. We watch the growth\r\nand prosperity of other nations, not with hatred or jealousy, but\r\nwith sincere and friendly good-will. I think I can say safely that we\r\nhave shown by our attitude toward Cuba, by our attitude toward China,\r\nthat as regards weaker powers our desire is that they may be able to\r\nstand alone, and that if they will only show themselves willing to\r\ndeal honestly and fairly with the rest of mankind we on our side will\r\ndo all we can to help, not to hinder, them. With the great powers of\r\nthe world we desire no rivalry that is not honorable to both parties.\r\nWe wish them well. We believe that the trend of the modern spirit is\r\never stronger toward peace, not war; toward friendship, not hostility,\r\nas the normal international attitude. We are glad indeed that we are\r\non good terms with all the other peoples of mankind, and no effort on\r\nour part shall be spared to secure a continuance of these relations.\r\nAnd remember, gentlemen, that we shall be a potent factor for peace\r\nlargely in proportion to the way in which we make it evident that\r\nour attitude is due, not to weakness, not to inability to defend\r\nourselves, but to a genuine repugnance to wrongdoing, a genuine\r\ndesire for self-respecting friendship with our neighbors. The voice\r\nof the weakling or the craven counts for nothing when he clamors for\r\npeace; but the voice of the just man armed is potent. We need to keep\r\nin a condition of preparedness, especially as regards our navy, not\r\nbecause we want war, but because we desire to stand with those whose\r\nplea for peace is listened to with respectful attention.\r\n\r\nImportant though it is that we should have peace abroad, it is even\r\nmore important that we should have peace at home. You, men of the\r\nChamber of Commerce, to whose efforts we owe so much of our industrial\r\nwell-being, can, and I believe surely will, be influential in helping\r\ntoward that industrial peace which can obtain in society only when in\r\ntheir various relations employer and employed alike show not merely\r\ninsistence each upon his own rights, but also regard for the rights\r\nof others, and a full acknowledgment of the interests of the third\r\nparty—the public. It is no easy matter to work out a system or rule of\r\nconduct, whether with or without the help of the lawgiver, which shall\r\nminimize that jarring and clashing of interests in the industrial\r\nworld which causes so much individual irritation and suffering at the\r\npresent day, and which at times threatens baleful consequences to\r\nlarge portions of the body politic. But the importance of the problem\r\ncan not be overestimated, and it deserves to receive the careful\r\nthought of all men such as those whom I am addressing to-night. There\r\nshould be no yielding to wrong; but there should most certainly\r\nbe not only desire to do right but a willingness each to try to\r\nunderstand the viewpoint of his fellow, with whom, for weal or for\r\nwoe, his own fortunes are indissolubly bound.\r\n\r\nNo patent remedy can be devised for the solution of these grave\r\nproblems in the industrial world; but we may rest assured that they\r\ncan be solved at all only if we bring to the solution certain old-time\r\nvirtues, and if we strive to keep out of the solution some of the\r\nmost familiar and most undesirable of the traits to which mankind has\r\nowed untold degradation and suffering throughout the ages. Arrogance,\r\nsuspicion, brutal envy of the well-to-do, brutal indifference toward\r\nthose who are not well-to-do, the hard refusal to consider the rights\r\nof others, the foolish refusal to consider the limits of beneficent\r\naction, the base appeal to the spirit of selfish greed, whether it\r\ntake the form of plunder of the fortunate or of oppression of the\r\nunfortunate—from these and from all kindred vices this Nation must be\r\nkept free if it is to remain in its present position in the forefront\r\nof the peoples of mankind. On the other hand, good will come, even\r\nout of the present evils, if we face them armed with the old homely\r\nvirtues; if we show that we are fearless of soul, cool of head, and\r\nkindly of heart; if, without betraying the weakness that cringes\r\nbefore wrongdoing, we yet show by deeds and words our knowledge that\r\nin such a government as ours each of us must be in very truth his\r\nbrother’s keeper.\r\n\r\nAt a time when the growing complexity of our social and industrial\r\nlife has rendered inevitable the intrusion of the State into spheres\r\nof work wherein it formerly took no part, and when there is also a\r\ngrowing tendency to demand the illegitimate and unwise transfer to\r\nthe government of much of the work that should be done by private\r\npersons, singly or associated together, it is a pleasure to address\r\na body whose members possess to an eminent degree the traditional\r\nAmerican self-reliance of spirit which makes them scorn to ask from\r\nthe government, whether of State or of Nation, anything but a fair\r\nfield and no favor; who confide not in being helped by others, but in\r\ntheir own skill, energy, and business capacity to achieve success.\r\nThe first requisite of a good citizen in this Republic of ours is\r\nthat he shall be able and willing to pull his weight—that he shall\r\nnot be a mere passenger, but shall do his share in the work that each\r\ngeneration of us finds ready to hand; and, furthermore, that in doing\r\nhis work he shall show not only the capacity for sturdy self-help but\r\nalso self-respecting regard for the rights of others.\r\n\r\nThe Chamber of Commerce, it is no idle boast to say, stands in a\r\npreëminent degree for those qualities which make the successful\r\nmerchant, the successful business man, whose success is won in ways\r\nhonorable to himself and beneficial to his fellows. There are very\r\ndifferent kinds of success. There is the success that brings with\r\nit the seared soul—the success which is achieved by wolfish greed\r\nand vulpine cunning—the success which makes honest men uneasy or\r\nindignant in its presence. Then there is the other kind of success—the\r\nsuccess which comes as the reward of keen insight, of sagacity,\r\nof resolution, of address, combined with unflinching rectitude of\r\nbehavior, public and private. The first kind of success may, in a\r\nsense—and a poor sense at that—benefit the individual, but it is\r\nalways and necessarily a curse to the community; whereas the man\r\nwho wins the second kind, as an incident of its winning becomes a\r\nbeneficiary to the whole commonwealth. Throughout its history the\r\nChamber of Commerce has stood for this second and higher kind of\r\nsuccess. It is therefore fitting that I should come on here as the\r\nChief Executive of the Nation to wish you well in your new home; for\r\nyou belong not merely to the city, not merely to the State, but to all\r\nthe country, and you stand high among the great factors in building\r\nup that marvelous prosperity which the entire country now enjoys. The\r\ncontinuance of this prosperity depends in no small measure upon your\r\nsanity and common-sense, upon the way in which you combine energy in\r\naction with conservative refusal to take part in the reckless gambling\r\nwhich is so often bred by, and which so inevitably puts an end to,\r\nprosperity. You are men of might in the world of American effort;\r\nyou are men whose names stand high in the esteem of our people; you\r\nare spoken of in terms like those used in the long-gone ages when it\r\nwas said of the Phœnician cities that their merchants were princes.\r\nGreat is your power and great, therefore, your responsibility. Well\r\nand faithfully have you met this responsibility in the past. We look\r\nforward with confident hope to what you will do in the future, and it\r\nis therefore with sincerity that I bid you Godspeed this evening and\r\nwish for you, in the name of the Nation, a career of ever increasing\r\nhonor and usefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE BANQUET TENDERED GENERAL LUKE E. WRIGHT, AT MEMPHIS, TENN.,\r\nNOVEMBER 19, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Toastmaster, General Wright, and you, my friends, whose\r\n  greeting to-night I shall ever remember_:\r\n\r\nIt is a real and great pleasure to come to this typical city of the\r\nsouthern Mississippi Valley in order to greet a typical American, a\r\ncitizen of Tennessee, who deserves honor not only from his State, but\r\nfrom the entire country—General Luke E. Wright. We have a right to\r\nexpect a high standard of manhood from Tennessee. It was one of the\r\nfirst two States created west of the Alleghany Mountains, and it was\r\nin this State that the first self-governing community of American\r\nfreemen was established upon waters flowing into the Gulf. The\r\npioneers of Tennessee were among the earliest in that great westward\r\nmarch which thrust the nation’s border across the continent to the\r\nPacific, and it is eminently fitting that a son of Tennessee should\r\nnow play so prominent a part in the further movement of expansion\r\nbeyond the Pacific. There have been Presidents of the United States\r\nfor but one hundred and thirteen years, and during sixteen of those\r\nyears Tennesseeans sat in the White House. Hardihood, and daring, and\r\niron resolution are of right to be expected among the sons of a State\r\nwhich nurtured Andrew Jackson and Sam Houston; which sent into the\r\nAmerican Navy one of the most famous fighting admirals of all time,\r\nFarragut.\r\n\r\nThere is another reason why our country should be glad that it was\r\nGeneral Wright who rendered this service. General Wright fought with\r\ndistinguished gallantry among the gallant men who served in the armies\r\nof the Confederacy during the Civil War. We need no proof of the\r\ncompleteness of our reunion as a people. When the war with Spain came\r\nthe sons of the men who wore the blue and the sons of the men who wore\r\nthe gray vied with one another in the effort to get into the ranks\r\nand face a foreign foe under the old flag that had been carried in\r\ntriumph under Winfield Scott and Zachary Taylor and Andrew Jackson.\r\nIt was my own good fortune to serve under that fearless fighter, old\r\nJoe Wheeler, a memory of which I shall always be proud. But if we\r\nneeded any proof of the unity of our interests it would have been\r\nafforded this very year by General Wright, the ex-Confederate, in his\r\nadministration as Acting Governor of the Philippine Islands. Upon him\r\nduring the months of summer rested a heavier burden of responsibility\r\nthan upon any other public servant at that particular time; and not\r\nthe least of his titles to our regard is the way in which he was able\r\nto work on terms of cordial good-will with the head of the army,\r\nhimself a man who had honored the blue uniform as Wright had honored\r\nthe gray.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wright’s work has been as difficult as it was important. The\r\nevents of the last four years have definitely decided that whether we\r\nwish to or not we must hereafter play a great part in the world. We\r\ncan not escape facing the duties. We may shirk them if we are built\r\nof poor stuff, or we may take hold and do them if we are fit sons of\r\nour sires—but face them we must, whether we will or not. Our duty in\r\nthe Philippine Islands has simply been one of the duties that thus\r\nhave come upon us. We are there, and we can no more haul down our flag\r\nand abandon the islands than we could now abandon Alaska. Whether we\r\nare glad or sorry that events forced us to go there is aside from the\r\nquestion; the point is that, as the inevitable result of the war with\r\nSpain, we found ourselves in the Philippines and that we could not\r\nleave the islands without discredit. The islanders were wholly unfit\r\nto govern themselves, and if we had left there would have been a brief\r\nperiod of bloody chaos, and then some other nation would have stepped\r\nin to do the work which we had shirked. It can not be too often\r\nrepeated that there was no question that the work had to be done. All\r\nthe question was, whether we would do it well or ill; and, thanks to\r\nthe choice of men like Governor Wright, it has been done well. The\r\nfirst and absolutely indispensable requisite was order—peace. The\r\nreign of lawless violence, of resistance to legitimate authority, the\r\nreign of anarchy, could no more be tolerated abroad than it could be\r\ntolerated here in our own land.\r\n\r\nThe American flag stands for orderly liberty, and it stands for it\r\nabroad as it stands for it at home. The task of our soldiers was to\r\nrestore and maintain order in the islands. The army had the task to\r\ndo, and it did it well and thoroughly. The fullest and heartiest\r\npraise belongs to our soldiers who in the Philippines brought to a\r\ntriumphant conclusion a war, small indeed compared to the gigantic\r\nstruggle in which the older men whom I am addressing took part in the\r\nearly sixties, but inconceivably harassing and difficult, because\r\nit was waged amid the pathless jungles of great tropic islands and\r\nagainst a foe very elusive, very treacherous, and often inconceivably\r\ncruel both toward our men and toward the great numbers of peace-loving\r\nFilipinos who gladly welcomed our advent. The soldiers included both\r\nregulars and volunteers, men from the North, the South, the East,\r\nand the West, men from Pennsylvania and from Tennessee, no less than\r\nmen from the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Slope—and to all alike\r\nwe give honor, for they acted as American soldiers should. Cruelties\r\nwere committed here and there. The fact that they were committed under\r\nwellnigh intolerable provocation affords no excuse for such cruelties,\r\nnor can we admit as justification that they were retaliatory in kind.\r\nEvery effort has been made to detect and punish the wrongdoers and\r\nthe wrongdoing itself has been completely stopped. But these misdeeds\r\nwere exceptional, and their occurrence in no wise alters the fact\r\nthat the American army in the Philippines showed as a whole not\r\nonly splendid soldierly qualities but a high order of humanity in\r\ndealing with their foes. A hundred thousand of our troops went to the\r\nPhilippines. Among them were some who offended against the right.\r\nWell, are we altogether immaculate at home? I think not. I ask for no\r\nspecial consideration to be shown our friends and kinsmen, our sons\r\nand brothers, who during three years so well upheld the national honor\r\nin the Philippines. I ask merely that we do the same equal justice to\r\nthe soldier who went abroad and faced death and lived hard as we show\r\nto his fellow who stayed at home and lived easily and in comfort; and\r\nif we show that equal justice we will doff our hats to the man who has\r\nput the whole country under obligations by the victory he helped to\r\nwin in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nBut the soldier’s work as a soldier was not the larger part of what\r\nhe did. When once the outbreak was over in any place, then began the\r\nwork of establishing civil administration. Here, too, the soldier\r\ndid his part, for the work of preparing for the civil authority was\r\noften done by the officers and men of the regular army, and well done,\r\ntoo. Then the real work of building up a system of self-government\r\nfor the people who had become our wards was begun, under the auspices\r\nof the Philippine Commission, Judge Taft being made Governor,\r\nand I having had the honor myself to appoint General Wright as\r\nVice-Governor. During the critical period when the insurrection was\r\nending and the time was one of transition between a state of war and\r\na state of peace, at the time that I issued a proclamation declaring\r\nthat the state of war was over and that the civil government was\r\nnow in complete command, General Wright served as Governor of the\r\narchipelago. The progress of the islands both in material well-being\r\nand as regards order and justice under the administration of Governor\r\nWright and his colleagues has been astounding.\r\n\r\nThere is no question as to our not having gone far enough and fast\r\nenough in granting self-government to the Filipinos; the only possible\r\ndanger has been lest we should go faster and further than was in the\r\ninterest of the Filipinos themselves. Each Filipino at the present\r\nday is guaranteed his life, his liberty, and the chance to pursue\r\nhappiness as he wishes, so long as he does not harm his fellows, in\r\na way which the islands have never known before during all their\r\nrecorded history. There are bands of ladrones, of brigands, still in\r\nexistence. Now and then they may show sporadic increase. This will\r\nbe due occasionally to disaffection with some of the things that our\r\ngovernment does which are best—for example, the effort to quarantine\r\nagainst the plague and to enforce necessary sanitary precautions,\r\ngently and tactfully though it was made, produced violent hostility\r\namong some of the more ignorant natives. Again, a disease like the\r\ncattle plague may cause in some given province such want that a part\r\nof the inhabitants revert to their ancient habit of brigandage. But\r\nthe islands have never been as orderly, as peaceful, or as prosperous\r\nas now; and in no other Oriental country, whether ruled by Asiatics or\r\nEuropeans, is there anything approaching to the amount of individual\r\nliberty and of self-government which our rule has brought to the\r\nFilipinos. The Nation owes a great debt to the people through whom\r\nthis splendid work for civilization has been achieved, and therefore\r\non behalf of the Nation I have come here to-night to thank in your\r\npresence your fellow-townsman, because he has helped us materially to\r\nadd a new page to the honor roll of American history. General Wright,\r\nI greet you, I thank you, and I wish you well.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE RECEPTION TO GENERAL WRIGHT AT MEMPHIS, TENN., NOVEMBER 19, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman, and you, my Fellow-Americans_:\r\n\r\nI am glad indeed to have the honor of coming to-day to your beautiful\r\ncity in your beautiful State to greet, on behalf of the whole country,\r\na Tennesseean who has rendered high and honorable service to the whole\r\ncountry—a Tennesseean of whom it can be said, as it has been said of\r\nthe Greek hero:\r\n\r\n      “Much has he seen and known, cities of men,\r\n      And manners, climates, councils, governments,\r\n      Himself not least, but honored of them all;\r\n      Has drunk delight of battle with his peers,\r\n      Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.”\r\n\r\nWe are one people absolutely. The memories of the Civil War are now\r\nheritages of honor alike for those whose fathers wore the blue and\r\nfor those whose fathers wore the gray. There is one curious and not\r\ninappropriate coincidence to-day—my mother’s brother served under Mrs.\r\nWright’s father in the Confederate Navy. I am proud of his valor; and\r\nI can say this freely, for if I had been old enough I would myself\r\nhave surely worn the blue uniform.\r\n\r\nI come here to-day to greet General Wright because it has been given\r\nto him to render a peculiar service to the whole country. A man can\r\nrender service of the very highest character at home, but owing to\r\nthe very nature of our system of government, he must, in his election\r\nat least, represent particularly a given party. I say in his election\r\nat least, for after election, if he is worth anything, he must be a\r\nrepresentative of the whole country. But there are certain branches\r\nof the public service in which if we are wise and far-seeing we will\r\nnever allow partisan politics to enter. There must be no partisan\r\npolitics in the army or the navy of the United States. All that\r\nconcerns us to know about any general or admiral, about a mighty\r\ncaptain by sea or by land, is whether he is a thoroughly fit commander\r\nof men and loyal to the country as a whole. In the same way if we are\r\nwise, if we care for our reputation abroad, if we are sensitive of our\r\nhonor at home, we will allow no question of partisan politics ever to\r\nenter into the administration of the great islands which came under\r\nour flag as a result of the war with Spain.\r\n\r\nHence I say that General Wright, like Governor Taft and his\r\nassociates, has rendered a peculiar service to every man jealous of\r\nthe honor of the American name in what he has done in administering\r\nthe Philippine Islands. For fourteen months it has been part of\r\nmy business to see how the work there was done. I am not speaking\r\nexaggeratedly, I am speaking literally, telling the naked truth, when\r\nI say that never during that time has a question of party politics\r\nentered into even the smallest action of those in control of the\r\nPhilippine Islands.\r\n\r\nMy fellow-Americans, we can not afford to have the honor of the Nation\r\nin any way smirched in connection with our dependencies. We can not\r\nafford to have it smirched anywhere; but if we wrong ourselves here at\r\nhome we are to blame and we pay the penalty, while if we allow wrong\r\nin connection with the islands not only the islands suffer, but an\r\nindelible stigma of shame comes to the American name. I am earnestly\r\ndesirous that the administration of the Philippine Islands shall be\r\nput and kept upon such a plane of patriotic efficiency that no change\r\nwill be made in it owing to any change of party here at home. Party\r\nfeeling should of course stop at the water-line. The inestimable\r\nservice rendered by Governor Wright in the Philippine Islands has been\r\nbecause he has so conducted the government of those islands as to make\r\nit not only of signal benefit to them, but of signal honor to every\r\ncitizen of our country; that he has so handled the administration of\r\naffairs as to make us feel a justifiable confidence that hereafter\r\nthe storms of party politics in the United States shall never touch\r\nthe government of the Philippine Islands, and that whatever changes\r\nof administration there are here in the Union, there shall not be a\r\nripple of change in the course of conduct in the Philippines marked\r\nout by Governor Wright and his associates. The man of whom that can be\r\ntruthfully said is a man entitled to honor from his fellow-countrymen;\r\nand of Governor Wright it can be truthfully said.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE FOUNDERS’ DAY BANQUET OF THE UNION LEAGUE, PHILADELPHIA, PA.,\r\nNOVEMBER 22, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President, Gentlemen of the Union League_:\r\n\r\nForty years ago this club was founded, in the dark days of the Civil\r\nWar, to uphold the hands of Abraham Lincoln and give aid to those\r\nwho battled for the Union and for human liberty. Two years ago\r\nPresident McKinley came here as your guest to thank you, and through\r\nyou all those far-sighted and loyal men who had supported him in his\r\nsuccessful effort to keep untarnished the national good faith at home\r\nand the national honor abroad, and to bring back to this country\r\nthe material well-being which we now so abundantly enjoy. It was no\r\naccident which made the men of this club who stood as in a peculiar\r\nsense the champions and upholders of the principles of Lincoln in the\r\nearly sixties stand no less stoutly for those typified in the person\r\nof McKinley during the closing years of the century. The qualities\r\napt to make men respond to the call of duty in one crisis are also\r\napt to make them respond to a similar call in a crisis of a different\r\ncharacter. The traits which enabled our people to pass unscathed\r\nthrough the fiery ordeal of the Civil War were the traits upon which\r\nwe had to rely in the less serious, but yet serious, dangers by which\r\nwe were menaced in 1896, 1898, and 1900.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning our people have markedly combined practical\r\ncapacity for affairs with power of devotion to an ideal. The lack of\r\neither quality would have rendered the possession of the other of\r\nsmall value. Mere ability to achieve success in things concerning\r\nthe body would not have atoned for the failure to live the life of\r\nhigh endeavor; and, on the other hand, without a foundation of those\r\nqualities which bring material prosperity there would be nothing on\r\nwhich the higher life could be built. The men of the Revolution would\r\nhave failed if they had not possessed alike devotion to liberty and\r\nability (once liberty had been achieved) to show common-sense and\r\nself-restraint in its use. The men of the great Civil War would have\r\nfailed had they not possessed the business capacity which developed\r\nand organized their resources in addition to the stern resolution\r\nto expend these resources as freely as they expended their blood in\r\nfurtherance of the great cause for which their hearts leaped. It\r\nis this combination of qualities that has made our people succeed.\r\nOther peoples have been as devoted to liberty, and yet, because of\r\nlack of hard-headed common-sense and of ability to show restraint and\r\nsubordinate individual passions for the general good, have failed\r\nso signally in the struggle of life as to become a byword among\r\nthe nations. Yet other peoples, again, have possessed all possible\r\nthrift and business capacity, but have been trampled under foot, or\r\nhave played a sordid and ignoble part in the world, because their\r\nbusiness capacity was unaccompanied by any of the lift toward nobler\r\nthings which marks a great and generous nation. The stern but just\r\nrule of judgment for humanity is that each nation shall be known by\r\nits fruits; and if there are no fruits, if the nation has failed, it\r\nmatters but little whether it has failed through meanness of soul or\r\nthrough lack of robustness of character. We must judge a nation by the\r\nnet result of its life and activity. And so we must judge the policies\r\nof those who at any time control the destinies of a nation.\r\n\r\nTherefore I ask you to-night to look at the results of the policies\r\nchampioned by President McKinley on both the occasions when he\r\nappealed to the people for their suffrages, and to see how well that\r\nappeal has been justified by the event. Most certainly I do not\r\nclaim all the good that has befallen us during the past six years\r\nas due solely to any human policy. No legislation, however wise, no\r\nAdministration, however efficient, can secure prosperity to a people\r\nor greatness to a nation. All that can be done by the law-maker and\r\nthe administrator is to give the best chance possible for the people\r\nof the country themselves to show the stuff that is in them. President\r\nMcKinley was elected in 1896 on the specific pledge that he would\r\nkeep the financial honor of the Nation untarnished and would put our\r\neconomic system on a stable basis, so that our people might be given\r\na chance to secure the return of prosperity. Both pledges have been\r\nso well kept that, as is but too often the case, men are beginning\r\nto forget how much the keeping of them has meant. When people have\r\nbecome very prosperous they tend to become sluggishly indifferent to\r\nthe continuation of the policies that brought about their prosperity.\r\nAt such times as these it is of course a mere law of nature that some\r\nmen prosper more than others, and too often those who prosper less, in\r\ntheir jealousy of their more fortunate brethren, forget that all have\r\nprospered somewhat. I ask you soberly to remember that the complaint\r\nmade at the present day of our industrial or economic conditions never\r\ntakes the form of stating that any of our people are less well off\r\nthan they were seven or eight years back, before President McKinley\r\ncame in and his policies had a chance to be applied; but that the\r\ncomplaint is that some people have received more than their share\r\nof the good things of the world. There was no such complaint eight\r\nyears ago, in the summer of 1894. Complaint was not then that any one\r\nhad prospered too much; it was that no one had prospered enough. Let\r\neach one of us think of the affairs of his own household and his own\r\nbusiness, let each of us compare his standing now with his standing\r\neight years back, and then let him answer for himself whether it is\r\nnot true that the policies for which William McKinley stood in 1896\r\nhave justified themselves thrice over by the results they have brought\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 the issues were in part the same, but new ones had been added.\r\nProsperity had returned; the gold standard was assured; our tariff\r\nwas remodeled on the lines that have marked it at all periods when\r\nour well-being was greatest. But as must often happen, the President\r\nelected on certain issues was obliged to face others entirely\r\nunforeseen. Rarely indeed have our greatest men made issues—they\r\nhave shown their greatness by meeting them as they arose. President\r\nMcKinley faced the problems of the Spanish War and those that followed\r\nit exactly as he had faced the problems of our economic and financial\r\nneeds. As a sequel to the war with Spain we found ourselves in\r\npossession of the Philippines under circumstances which rendered it\r\nnecessary to subdue a formidable insurrection which made it impossible\r\nfor us with honor or with regard to the welfare of the island to\r\nwithdraw therefrom. The occasion was seized by the opponents of the\r\nPresident for trying to raise a new issue, on which they hoped they\r\nmight be more successful than on the old. The clamor raised against\r\nhim was joined in not only by many honest men who were led astray\r\nby a mistaken view or imperfect knowledge of the facts, but by all\r\nwho feared effort, who shrank from the rough work of endeavor. The\r\ncampaign of 1900 had to be fought largely upon the new issue thus\r\nraised. President McKinley met it squarely. Two years and eight months\r\nago, before his second nomination, he spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“We believe that the century of free government which the American\r\npeople have enjoyed has not rendered them irresolute and faithless,\r\nbut has fitted them for the great task of lifting up and assisting\r\nto better conditions and larger liberty those distant peoples who\r\nthrough the issue of battle have become our wards. Let us fear not.\r\nThere is no occasion for faint hearts, no excuse for regrets. Nations\r\ndo not grow in strength, the cause of liberty and law is not advanced\r\nby the doing of easy things. The harder the task the greater will\r\nbe the result, the benefit, and the honor. To doubt our power to\r\naccomplish it is to lose faith in the soundness and strength of our\r\npopular institutions.... We have the new care and can not shift it.\r\nAnd, breaking up the camp of ease and isolation, let us bravely and\r\nhopefully and soberly continue the march of faithful service, and\r\nfalter not until the work is done.... The burden is our opportunity.\r\nThe opportunity is greater than the burden.”\r\n\r\nThere spoke the man who preached the gospel of hope as well as the\r\ngospel of duty, and on the issue thus fairly drawn between those who\r\nsaid we would do our new work well and triumphantly and those who\r\nsaid we would fail lamentably in the effort, the contest was joined.\r\nWe won. And now I ask you, two years after the victory, to look across\r\nthe seas and judge for yourselves whether or not the promise has\r\nbeen kept. The prophets of disaster have seen their predictions so\r\ncompletely falsified by the event that it is actually difficult to\r\narouse even a passing interest in their failure. To answer them now,\r\nto review their attack on our army, is of merely academic interest.\r\nThey played their brief part of obstruction and clamor; they said\r\ntheir say; and the current of our life went over them and they sank\r\nunder it as did their predecessors who, thirty-six years before, had\r\ndeclared that another and greater war was a failure, that another and\r\ngreater struggle for true liberty was only a contest for subjugation\r\nin which the United States could never succeed. The insurrection among\r\nthe Filipinos has been absolutely quelled. The war has been brought\r\nto an end sooner than even the most sanguine of us dared to hope. The\r\nworld has not in recent years seen any military task done with more\r\nsoldierly energy and ability; and done, moreover, in a spirit of great\r\nhumanity. The strain on the army was terrible, for the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil made their work harassing to an extraordinary degree,\r\nand the foes in the field were treacherous and cruel, not merely\r\ntoward our men, but toward the great multitude of peaceful islanders\r\nwho welcomed our rule. Under the strain of wellnigh intolerable\r\nprovocation there were shameful instances, as must happen in all\r\nwars, where the soldiers forgot themselves, and retaliated evil for\r\nevil. There were one hundred thousand of our men in the Philippines,\r\na hundred thousand hired for a small sum a month apiece, put there\r\nunder conditions that strained their nerves to the breaking point, and\r\nsome of the hundred thousand did what they ought not to have done.\r\nBut out of a hundred thousand men at home, have all been faultless?\r\nEvery effort has been made to detect such cases, to punish the\r\noffenders, and to prevent any recurrence of the deed. It is a cruel\r\ninjustice to the gallant men who fought so well in the Philippines\r\nnot to recognize that these instances were exceptional, and that the\r\nAmerican troops who served in the far-off tropic islands deserve\r\npraise the same in kind that has always been given to those who have\r\nwell and valiantly fought for the honor of our common flag and common\r\ncountry. The work of civil administration has kept pace with the work\r\nof military administration, and when on July 4 last amnesty and peace\r\nwere declared throughout the islands the civil government assumed the\r\ncomplete control. Peace and order now prevail and a greater measure\r\nof prosperity and of happiness than the Filipinos have ever hitherto\r\nknown in all their dark and checkered history; and each one of them\r\nhas a greater measure of liberty, a greater chance of happiness, and\r\ngreater safety for his life and property than he or his forefathers\r\nhave ever before known.\r\n\r\nThus we have met each task that has confronted us during the past\r\nsix years. Thus we have kept every promise made in 1896 and 1900. We\r\nhave a right to be proud of the memories of the last six years. But\r\nwe must remember that each victory only opens the chance for a new\r\nstruggle; that the remembrance of triumphs achieved in the past is of\r\nuse chiefly if it spurs us to fresh effort in the present. No nation\r\nhas ever prospered as we are prospering now, and we must see to it\r\nthat by our own folly we do not mar this prosperity. Yet we must see\r\nto it also that wherever wrong flourishes it be repressed. It is not\r\nthe habit of our people to shirk issues, but squarely to face them.\r\nIt is not the habit of our people to treat a good record in the past\r\nas anything but a reason for expecting an even better record in the\r\npresent; and no Administration, gentlemen, should ask to be judged\r\nsave on those lines. The tremendous growth of our industrialism has\r\nbrought to the front many problems with which we must deal; and I\r\ntrust that we shall deal with them along the lines indicated in speech\r\nand in action by that profound jurist and upright and fearless public\r\nservant who represents Pennsylvania in the Cabinet—Attorney-General\r\nKnox. The question of the so-called trusts is but one of the questions\r\nwe must meet in connection with our industrial system. There are many\r\nof them and they are serious; but they can and will be met. Time may\r\nbe needed for making the solution perfect; but it is idle to tell\r\nthis people that we have not the power to solve such a problem as\r\nthat of exercising adequate supervision over the great industrial\r\ncombinations of to-day. We have the power and we shall find out the\r\nway. We shall not act hastily or recklessly; but we have firmly made\r\nup our minds that a solution, and a right solution, shall be found,\r\nand found it will be.\r\n\r\nNo nation as great as ours can expect to escape the penalty of\r\ngreatness, for greatness does not come without trouble and labor.\r\nThere are problems ahead of us at home and problems abroad, because\r\nsuch problems are incident to the working out of a great national\r\ncareer. We do not shrink from them. Scant is our patience with those\r\nwho preach the gospel of craven weakness. No nation under the sun ever\r\nyet played a part worth playing if it feared its fate overmuch—if it\r\ndid not have the courage to be great. We of America, we, the sons of\r\na nation yet in the pride of its lusty youth, spurn the teachings of\r\ndistrust, spurn the creed of failure and despair. We know that the\r\nfuture is ours if we have in us the manhood to grasp it, and we enter\r\nthe new century girding our loins for the contest before us, rejoicing\r\nin the struggle, and resolute so to bear ourselves that the Nation’s\r\nfuture shall even surpass her glorious past.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE BANQUET TO JUSTICE HARLAN, THE NEW WILLARD HOTEL, WASHINGTON,\r\nD. C., DECEMBER 9, 1902\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiar privilege to be here to-night as one of those\r\ngathered to do homage to a career which has honored America. It is\r\ndifficult to say certain of the truths which must need be said without\r\nbeing guilty of truisms in saying them. It is not an idle boast of\r\nthis country when we speak of the court upon which Mr. Justice Harlan\r\nsits as the most illustrious and important court in all the civilized\r\nworld. It is not merely our own people who say that—it is the verdict\r\nof other nations as well.\r\n\r\nMr. Justice Harlan has served for a quarter of a century on that\r\ncourt. During that time he has exercised an influence over the\r\njudicial statesmanship of the country of a kind such as is possible\r\nonly under our own form of government. For the judges of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the land must be not only great jurists, but they must\r\nbe great constructive statesmen. And the truth of what I say is\r\nillustrated by every study of American statesmanship, for in not one\r\nserious study of American political life will it be possible to omit\r\nthe immense part played by the Supreme Court in the creation, not\r\nmerely the modification, of the great policies through and by means of\r\nwhich the country has moved on to its present position.\r\n\r\nThrice fortunate is the court when it has as one of its members a man\r\nwho has played a great part in other spheres of our composite national\r\nlife. Mr. Justice Harlan came from Kentucky, a State in which the\r\npatriotism of the people was put to so peculiarly a severe test in\r\nthe Civil War. In the States of the further North it was easy for the\r\nman to make up his mind on which side he would unsheathe his sword.\r\nIn the States of the further South it was equally easy. In Kentucky\r\nthe task was a difficult one. I remember, Mr. Justice, being told by a\r\nKentuckian, who was a stanch friend of yours and one of the greatest\r\nlawyers and most patriotic citizens whom this country had—John Mason\r\nBrown—that he came back from a trip from the West as a young man of\r\ntwenty-one, just at the time of the outbreak of the Civil War, just\r\nafter Sumter had been fired upon, and his mother brought down to him\r\nthe sword that his father had carried in the Mexican War, and said to\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n“My son, this is the sword your father carried. I hope you will draw\r\nit on the side that defends the flag for which your father fought,\r\nbut, for one side or the other, draw it you must.”\r\n\r\nIn any audience in any State of the Union, take it as far north as\r\nyou wish, I can appeal with confidence to the people I address when I\r\nsay that next to the homage we pay to the men who proved the truth of\r\ntheir endeavor as they battled in the blue uniform is the homage we\r\npay to the men who, with equal sincerity, with equal devotion to the\r\nright as it was given them to see the right, wore the gray. And none\r\npay that tribute of regard so frankly as those who themselves wore the\r\nblue in battle.\r\n\r\nAnd having said that, I am sure that none of my friends who fought in\r\nthe Confederate service will misunderstand me or will grudge what I am\r\nabout to say when I say that the greatest debt owed by this country\r\nto any set of men is owed by it to those men of the so-called border\r\nStates—the men who in statesmanship followed Clay and the Crittendens\r\nand the Blairs; the men who as soldiers fought on the same side with\r\nThomas and Farragut, the men who were for the Union, without regard\r\nto whether their immediate associates were for it or not. In New\r\nYork, in Massachusetts, in Illinois, in Iowa, the men who stood for\r\nthe Union went with the stream. In parts of Kentucky, of Virginia,\r\nof Missouri, they stemmed the torrent. And, gentlemen, I am half a\r\nSoutherner myself. Two of my uncles fought in the Confederate Navy.\r\nOne of them served under the father-in-law of Vice-Governor Luke\r\nWright, of the Philippine Islands. And so I think I have the right\r\nto say that, knowing the Southern people as I do, I would heartily\r\nadvocate fighting twice as hard as you fought from 1861 to 1865 for\r\nthe privilege of staying in the same Union with them.\r\n\r\nThe man to be a great statesman on the bench of the Supreme Court\r\nmust have many qualities, and fortunate are we that this evening we\r\ncan point to Justice Harlan as embodying them. A good citizen must\r\nbe a good citizen in peace and in war. He must have the decent and\r\norderly virtues, and he must have the essential manliness for the lack\r\nof which no good intention can atone. It will be a bad thing for the\r\nnation if ever we grow as a nation to submit to the suppression of\r\nefficiency and morality, if we ever grow to accept the belief that we\r\nare to have two camps, in one of which will be grouped the men who\r\nmean well, but who don’t do things, and in the other the men who do\r\nthings, but who do not mean well.\r\n\r\nThe art of successful self-government is not an easy art for people\r\nor for individuals. It comes to our people here as the inheritance\r\nof ages of effort. It can be thrown away; it can be unlearned very\r\neasily, and it surely will be unlearned if we forget the vital need\r\nnot merely of preaching, but of practicing both sets of virtues—if we\r\nforget the vital need of having the average citizen not only a good\r\nman, but a man.\r\n\r\nIt is a fine thing to have on the Supreme Court a man who dared\r\nventure all for the great prize of death in battle when the country\r\ncalled for him, and a man who, after the war was closed, did not\r\ncontent himself with living an ignoble life on the plea that he had\r\ndone so well it was not necessary to do more, but who continued to\r\ndo his duty as a citizen all the better because he had done it as a\r\nsoldier; the man who remembered that duty done, to be of practical\r\nuse, must serve not as an excuse for not doing further duty, but as an\r\nincentive, as a spur, to make him feel ashamed that his present or\r\nhis future should fall short of his past.\r\n\r\nSo, Judge Harlan, I greet you personally, sir. I wish to express my\r\nown personal debt to you for your influence, for your example, but I\r\nwish far more, speaking as the representative of all our people, to\r\nexpress the infinite sense of obligation we have to you for having\r\nshown by your life what the type of fearless American citizenship\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEPTION OF A DELEGATION FROM THE NATIONAL BOARD OF TRADE,\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., JANUARY 15, 1903\r\n\r\nMr. Randall, speaking for the delegation, said: Mr. President, we have\r\ncome here merely to present ourselves and to make our annual call on\r\nthe President of the United States. We thank you for meeting us.\r\n\r\nThe President responded: I shall not try to make you any speech.\r\nI wish simply to say what a very real pleasure it is to see you,\r\nand also to say this—that I am glad to see the meetings of the big\r\nbusiness interests take place sometimes in Washington. Nothing can be\r\nbetter both for the business interests and for legislation than to\r\nhave as close a touch as possible between the elective representatives\r\nhere and the men whose welfare is so interwoven with what is done in\r\nthe halls of Congress. It is a very great help to all of us to have\r\nyou come here. I thank you for coming.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE BANQUET OF THE YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION, NEW WILLARD\r\nHOTEL, WASHINGTON, D. C., JAN. 19, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nIt is no accident that we should meet here to celebrate a record\r\nof fifty years—that period which covers the half century which has\r\nseen the gigantic industrial change of the world, which has seen the\r\nfruition of the forces that have brought about a revolution, socially\r\nand industrially, within the fifty years such as was hardly seen\r\nwithin any preceding five centuries. Life has been very intense, has\r\nbeen carried on at a very high pressure, during that half century;\r\nmore intense, carried on at a higher pressure, than ever before. That\r\nmeans of course that all the forces have been raised to a higher\r\ndegree of power—the forces of evil, and, thank heaven, also the\r\nforces of good. If it had not been for the work of such organizations\r\nas this, for such organized effort as that represented by you here\r\nto-night, the immense material progress of the world during the past\r\nhalf century would have been a progress that would have told for ill\r\nfor the nations, not for good. We can say with truth that we are\r\nbetter off than we were. We can say that the creed of those who have\r\nfaith is the right creed as justified in present history, because\r\nside by side with this great material development, and with an even\r\nstronger rate of growth than the forces of evil, have grown the forces\r\nof good. If it had not been for the work done by those who founded\r\nthis movement, and of course by all those who have taken part in\r\nsimilar movements, in all movements for good, in every movement for\r\nsocial betterment, for civic betterment, in every movement to make men\r\ndecent and manly and strong—if it had not been for the work done by\r\nthem, if they had sat supine and thought things would make themselves\r\nbetter, things would have become steadily worse. We see all around us\r\npeople who say, “Oh, well, things will come out all right.” So they\r\nwill; but not because there are men who are content to _say_ that they\r\nwill come out all right; but because there is a sufficient number of\r\nearnest men with the root of righteousness in them who are bound to\r\n_do_ what will make them come out right.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable concentration of our lives during the last half century\r\nhas rendered it possible for anything that is evil to manifest itself\r\nmore strongly than ever before, and therefore made it necessary for us\r\nto see that the good has a corresponding development. A hundred years\r\nago there was no such need for the Young Men’s Christian Associations,\r\nfor the invaluable Young Women’s Christian Associations. Life was\r\nsimpler. The temptation would come surely to every man, but it would\r\nnot come so frequently and in so intense a form. As the forces of\r\nevil manifested themselves in stronger and stronger form they had to\r\nbe met, if they were to be successfully grappled with, by organized\r\neffort, by the effort of the many, which must always be stronger than\r\nthe effort of one; and the successful effort to combat the forces\r\nof evil had to take just such shape as has been given to the growth\r\nof the Young Men’s Christian Associations. It had to take the shape\r\nof combining decency and efficiency. There are many things that are\r\nso true that it seems almost trite to speak of them, and yet it is\r\ncontinually necessary to speak of them. There have been philanthropic\r\nmovements led and supported by most excellent people, which,\r\nnevertheless, have produced results altogether incommensurable with\r\nthe efforts spent, because they failed to combine as this movement has\r\ncombined a recognition of the needs of human nature with a resolute\r\neffort to make that human nature better.\r\n\r\nI have been acquainted especially with three types of your work:\r\nthe work in the army and navy, the work among railroad men, and the\r\nwork among college students. These three classes are not going to\r\nbe effectively reached as classes by any effort which fails to take\r\naccount of the fact that they demand manliness as well as virtue;\r\nand you can make them straight only on condition that in making them\r\nstraight you also keep in mind that it is necessary for them to be\r\nstrong. Remember Wesley’s remark when some one criticised him because\r\nhis hymn tunes were so good. He answered that he was not going to\r\nleave all the good tunes to the devil. We want to be exceedingly\r\ncareful that the impression shall not get about that good men intend\r\nto leave strength to those who serve the devil. I was very much\r\ninterested in what was said by Mr. Mott as to the meeting at Yale a\r\nfew nights ago, where the captain of the football team and the captain\r\nof the crew of next season both were present. I think that is typical\r\nof the whole movement. I am certain that those who have had experience\r\nin the army and navy have seen that in the long run the man who is\r\na decent man is apt to be the man who is the best soldier. The work\r\namong the railroad men always particularly appealed to me because the\r\nrailroad men are those who follow that modern industry which more than\r\nany other modern industry makes demand upon its followers for the\r\nheroic virtues, for the willingness to take risks, the willingness to\r\naccept responsibilities, the readiness to adopt a standard of duty\r\nwhich will require at need the sacrifice of life; those who follow it\r\nmust possess both the power to obey and the power to act on individual\r\ninitiative—the power to take responsibility. You can make men like\r\nthat accept morality if you can make them understand that it is not\r\nonly compatible with but is demanded by essential manliness. The work\r\nof the Y. M. C. A. has grown so among college students, for instance,\r\nbecause (I think I am right in saying) it has tried, not to dwarf any\r\nof the impulses of the young, vigorous men but to guide them aright.\r\nIt has sought not to make a man’s development one-sided, not to\r\nprevent his being a man, but to see that he is in the fullest sense\r\na man, and a good man. We greet to-night with peculiar pleasure the\r\nmen who served in the great war. Those men won in the day of trial\r\nbecause they and their fellows had in them, in the first place, the\r\npower of devotion to an ideal, and, in the next place, the strength\r\nto realize that power in effective fashion. If the men of ’61 had\r\nnot been driven forward by a spirit which made them anxious to lay\r\ndown their lives if need should be rather than to see the flag of\r\nthe Union torn in twain, if they had not had in them the lift toward\r\nloftier things which comes to those who value life as of small account\r\ncompared to devotion to country and to the flag, if they had not in\r\nthe truest and greatest and deepest sense of the word been patriotic,\r\nthen no amount of fighting capacity would have saved them. I don’t\r\ncare how good natural soldiers or sailors they had been, if their\r\nambitions had been personal, if they had been fundamentally disloyal,\r\nif each had been striving to build up himself and had viewed his\r\nfellows as rivals to be trampled down for his own advantage, then\r\nfailure would have come upon them. If Grant and Sherman and Thomas\r\nand Farragut had not all felt that they were fighting for one end,\r\nthat they were holding up the arms of mighty Lincoln as he toiled\r\nand wrought and suffered for the people, then their prowess would\r\nhave availed naught, and this Nation would have gone down into bloody\r\nanarchy, would have crumbled into dust as so many republics had\r\ncrumbled of old. They needed fervent devotion to country, devotion to\r\nthe right, and power to fight.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the lofty ideal—in no way as a substitute for it,\r\nbut in addition to this power of devotion to an ideal—the man must\r\nhave the fibre of heart, the fibre of body, to make his devotion take\r\neffective shape for the Nation’s welfare. And nowadays we shall win\r\nout, in the fight for a loftier life—we shall make this twentieth\r\ncentury better and not worse than any century that has gone before\r\nit—in proportion as we approach the problems that face us as this\r\nsociety has approached those problems, with a firm resolution to\r\nneglect neither side of the development of our people, to strive to\r\nmake the young men decent, God-fearing, law-abiding, honor-loving,\r\njustice-doing; and also fearless and strong, able to hold their own in\r\nthe hurly-burly of the world’s work, able to strive mightily that the\r\nforces of right may be in the end triumphant.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE BANQUET AT CANTON, OHIO, JANUARY 27, 1903, IN HONOR OF THE\r\nBIRTHDAY OF THE LATE PRESIDENT McKINLEY\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies, and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nThroughout our history, and indeed throughout history generally,\r\nit has been given to only a very few thrice-favored men to take so\r\nmarked a lead in the crises faced by their several generations that\r\nthereafter each stands as the embodiment of the triumphant effort of\r\nhis generation. President McKinley was one of these men.\r\n\r\nIf during the lifetime of a generation no crisis occurs sufficient\r\nto call out in marked manner the energies of the strongest leader,\r\nthen of course the world does not and can not know of the existence\r\nof such a leader; and in consequence there are long periods in the\r\nhistory of every nation during which no man appears who leaves an\r\nindelible mark in history. If, on the other hand, the crisis is one\r\nso many-sided as to call for the development and exercise of many\r\ndistinct attributes, it may be that more than one man will appear in\r\norder that the requirements shall be fully met. In the Revolution and\r\nin the period of constructive statesmanship immediately following it,\r\nfor our good fortune it befell us that the highest military and the\r\nhighest civic attributes were embodied in Washington, and so in him we\r\nhave one of the undying men of history—a great soldier, if possible\r\nan even greater statesman, and above all a public servant whose lofty\r\nand disinterested patriotism rendered his power and ability—alike on\r\nfought fields and in council chambers—of the most far-reaching service\r\nto the Republic. In the Civil War the two functions were divided, and\r\nLincoln and Grant will stand for evermore with their names inscribed\r\non the honor roll of those who have deserved well of mankind by saving\r\nto humanity a precious heritage. In similar fashion Thomas Jefferson\r\nand Andrew Jackson stand each as the foremost representative of the\r\ngreat movement of his generation, and their names symbolize to us\r\ntheir times and the hopes and aspirations of their times.\r\n\r\nIt was given to President McKinley to take the foremost place in our\r\npolitical life at a time when our country was brought face to face\r\nwith problems more momentous than any whose solution we have ever\r\nattempted, save only in the Revolution and in the Civil War; and it\r\nwas under his leadership that the Nation solved these mighty problems\r\naright. Therefore he shall stand in the eyes of history not merely as\r\nthe first man of his generation, but as among the greatest figures\r\nin our national life, coming second only to the men of the two great\r\ncrises in which the Union was founded and preserved.\r\n\r\nNo man could carry through successfully such a task as President\r\nMcKinley undertook, unless trained by long years of effort for its\r\nperformance. Knowledge of his fellow-citizens, ability to understand\r\nthem, keen sympathy with even their innermost feelings, and yet power\r\nto lead them, together with far-sighted sagacity and resolute belief\r\nboth in the people and in their future—all these were needed in the\r\nman who headed the march of our people during the eventful years from\r\n1896 to 1901. These were the qualities possessed by McKinley and\r\ndeveloped by him throughout his whole history previous to assuming\r\nthe Presidency. As a lad he had the inestimable privilege of serving,\r\nfirst in the ranks, and then as a commissioned officer, in the great\r\nwar for national union, righteousness, and grandeur; he was one of\r\nthose whom a kindly Providence permitted to take part in a struggle\r\nwhich ennobled every man who fought therein. He who when little more\r\nthan a boy had seen the grim steadfastness which after four years\r\nof giant struggle restored the Union and freed the slaves was not\r\nthereafter to be daunted by danger or frightened out of his belief in\r\nthe great destiny of our people.\r\n\r\nSome years after the war closed McKinley came to Congress, and rose,\r\nduring a succession of terms, to leadership in his party in the lower\r\nHouse. He also became Governor of his native State, Ohio. During\r\nthis varied service he received practical training of the kind most\r\nvaluable to him when he became Chief Executive of the Nation. To the\r\nhigh faith of his early years was added the capacity to realize his\r\nideals, to work with his fellow-men at the same time that he led them.\r\n\r\nPresident McKinley’s rise to greatness had in it nothing of the\r\nsudden, nothing of the unexpected or seemingly accidental. Throughout\r\nhis long term of service in Congress there was a steady increase\r\nalike in his power of leadership and in the recognition of that power\r\nboth by his associates in public life and by the public itself.\r\nSession after session his influence in the House grew greater; his\r\nparty antagonists grew to look upon him with constantly increasing\r\nrespect, his party friends with constantly increasing faith and\r\nadmiration. Eight years before he was nominated for President he was\r\nalready considered a Presidential possibility. Four years before he\r\nwas nominated only his own high sense of honor prevented his being\r\nmade a formidable competitor of the chief upon whom the choice of\r\nthe convention then actually fell. In 1896, he was chosen because the\r\ngreat mass of his party knew him and believed in him and regarded him\r\nas symbolizing their ideals, as representing their aspirations. In\r\nestimating the forces which brought about this nomination and election\r\nI do not undervalue that devoted personal friendship which he had the\r\nfaculty to inspire in so marked a degree among the ablest and most\r\ninfluential leaders; this leadership was of immense consequence in\r\nbringing about the result; but, after all, the prime factor was the\r\ntrust in and devotion to him felt by the great mass of men who had\r\ncome to accept him as their recognized spokesman. In his nomination\r\nthe national convention of a great party carried into effect in good\r\nfaith the deliberate judgment of that party as to whom its candidate\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\nBut even as a candidate President McKinley was far more than the\r\ncandidate of a party, and as President he was in the broadest and\r\nfullest sense the President of all the people of all sections of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nHis first nomination came to him because of the qualities he had shown\r\nin healthy and open political leadership, the leadership which by\r\nword and deed impresses itself as a virile force for good upon the\r\npeople at large and which has nothing in common with mere intrigue\r\nor manipulation. But, in 1896, the issue was fairly joined, chiefly\r\nupon a question which as a party question was entirely new, so that\r\nthe old lines of political cleavage were, in large part, abandoned.\r\nAll other issues sank in importance when compared with the vital\r\nneed of keeping our financial system on the high and honorable plane\r\nimperatively demanded by our position as a great civilized power.\r\nAs the champion of such a principle President McKinley received the\r\nsupport not only of his own party, but of hundreds of thousands of\r\nthose to whom he had been politically opposed. He triumphed, and\r\nhe made good with scrupulous fidelity the promises upon which the\r\ncampaign was won. We were at the time in a period of great industrial\r\ndepression, and it was promised for and on behalf of McKinley that\r\nif he were elected our financial system should not only be preserved\r\nunharmed but improved and our economic system shaped in accordance\r\nwith those theories which have always marked our periods of greatest\r\nprosperity. The promises were kept and following their keeping came\r\nthe prosperity which we now enjoy. All that was foretold concerning\r\nthe well-being which would follow the election of McKinley has been\r\njustified by the event. But as so often happens in our history, the\r\nPresident was forced to face questions other than those at issue at\r\nthe time of his election. Within a year the situation in Cuba had\r\nbecome literally intolerable. President McKinley had fought too well\r\nin his youth, he knew too well at first hand what war really was,\r\nlightly to enter into a struggle. He sought by every honorable means\r\nto preserve peace, to avert war. He made every effort consistent\r\nwith the national honor to bring about an amicable settlement of the\r\nCuban difficulty. Then, when it became evident that these efforts were\r\nuseless, that peace could not be honorably entertained, he devoted his\r\nstrength to making the war as short and as decisive as possible. It is\r\nneedless to tell the result in detail. Suffice it to say that rarely\r\nindeed in history has a contest so far-reaching in the importance of\r\nits outcome been achieved with such ease. There followed a harder\r\ntask. As a result of the war we came into possession of Cuba, Porto\r\nRico, and the Philippines. In each island the conditions were such\r\nthat we had to face problems entirely new to our national experience,\r\nand, moreover, in each island or group of islands the problems\r\ndiffered radically from those presented in the others. In Porto Rico\r\nthe task was simple. The island could not be independent. It became in\r\nall essentials a part of the Union. It has been given all the benefits\r\nof our economic and financial system. Its inhabitants have been given\r\nthe highest individual liberty, while yet their government has been\r\nkept under the supervision of officials so well chosen that the island\r\ncan be appealed to as affording a model for all such experiments in\r\nthe future; and this result was mainly owing to the admirable choice\r\nof instruments by President McKinley when he selected the governing\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\nIn Cuba, where we were pledged to give the island independence, the\r\npledge was kept not merely in letter but in spirit. It would have\r\nbeen a betrayal of our duty to have given Cuba independence out of\r\nhand. President McKinley, with his usual singular sagacity in the\r\nchoice of agents, selected in General Leonard Wood the man of all\r\nothers best fit to bring the island through its uncertain period\r\nof preparation for independence, and the result of his wisdom was\r\nshown when last May the island became in name and in fact a free\r\nRepublic, for it started with a better equipment and under more\r\nfavorable conditions than had ever previously been the case with any\r\nSpanish-American commonwealth.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the Philippines, the problem was one of great complexity.\r\nThere was an insurrectionary party claiming to represent the\r\npeople of the islands and putting forth their claim with a certain\r\nspeciousness which deceived no small number of excellent men here\r\nat home, and which afforded to yet others a chance to arouse a\r\nfactious party spirit against the President. Of course, looking\r\nback, it is now easy to see that it would have been both absurd and\r\nwicked to abandon the Philippine Archipelago and let the scores of\r\ndifferent tribes—Christian, Mohammedan, and pagan, in every stage of\r\nsemi-civilization and Asiatic barbarism—turn the islands into a welter\r\nof bloody savagery, with the absolute certainty that some strong\r\npower would have to step in and take possession. But though now it\r\nis easy enough to see that our duty was to stay in the islands, to\r\nput down the insurrection by force of arms, and then to establish\r\nfreedom-giving civil government, it needed genuine statesmanship to\r\nsee this and to act accordingly at the time of the first revolt. A\r\nweaker and less far-sighted man than President McKinley would have\r\nshrunk from a task very difficult in itself, and certain to furnish\r\noccasion for attack and misrepresentation no less than for honest\r\nmisunderstanding. But President McKinley never flinched. He refused to\r\nconsider the thought of abandoning our duty in our new possessions.\r\nWhile sedulously endeavoring to act with the utmost humanity toward\r\nthe insurrectionists, he never faltered in the determination to put\r\nthem down by force of arms, alike for the sake of our own interest\r\nand honor, and for the sake of the interest of the islanders, and\r\nparticularly of the great numbers of friendly natives, including those\r\nmost highly civilized, for whom abandonment by us would have meant\r\nruin and death. Again his policy was most amply vindicated. Peace has\r\ncome to the islands, together with a greater measure of individual\r\nliberty and self-government than they have ever before known. All the\r\ntasks set us as a result of the war with Spain have so far been well\r\nand honorably accomplished, and as a result this Nation stands higher\r\nthan ever before among the nations of mankind.\r\n\r\nPresident McKinley’s second campaign was fought mainly on the issue\r\nof approving what he had done in his first administration, and\r\nspecifically what he had done as regards these problems springing out\r\nof the war with Spain. The result was that the popular verdict in his\r\nfavor was more overwhelming than it had been before.\r\n\r\nNo other President in our history has seen high and honorable effort\r\ncrowned with more conspicuous personal success. No other President\r\nentered upon his second term feeling such right to a profound and\r\npeaceful satisfaction. Then by a stroke of horror, so strange in its\r\nfantastic iniquity as to stand unique in the black annals of crime,\r\nhe was struck down. The brave, strong, gentle heart was stilled\r\nforever, and word was brought to the woman who wept that she was to\r\nwalk thenceforth alone in the shadow. The hideous infamy of the deed\r\nshocked the Nation to its depths, for the man thus struck at was in a\r\npeculiar sense the champion of the plain people, in a peculiar sense\r\nthe representative and the exponent of those ideals which, if we\r\nlive up to them, will make, as they have largely made, our country a\r\nblessed refuge for all who strive to do right and to live their lives\r\nsimply and well as light is given them. The Nation was stunned, and\r\nthe people mourned with a sense of bitter bereavement because they\r\nhad lost a man whose heart beat for them as the heart of Lincoln once\r\nhad beaten. We did right to mourn; for the loss was ours, not his. He\r\ndied in the golden fulness of his triumph. He died victorious in that\r\nhighest of all kinds of strife—the strife for an ampler, juster, and\r\nmore generous national life. For him the laurel; but woe for those\r\nwhom he left behind; woe to the Nation that lost him; and woe to\r\nmankind that there should exist creatures so foul that one among them\r\nshould strike at so noble a life.\r\n\r\nWe are gathered together to-night to recall his memory, to pay our\r\ntribute of respect to the great chief and leader who fell in the\r\nharness, who was stricken down while his eyes were bright with “the\r\nlight that tells of triumph tasted.” We can honor him best by the\r\nway we show in actual deed that we have taken to heart the lessons\r\nof his life. We must strive to achieve, each in the measure that\r\nhe can, something of the qualities which made President McKinley a\r\nleader of men, a mighty power for good—his strength, his courage,\r\nhis courtesy and dignity, his sense of justice, his ever-present\r\nkindliness and regard for the rights of others. He won greatness\r\nby meeting and solving the issues as they arose—not by shirking\r\nthem—meeting them with wisdom, with the exercise of the most skilful\r\nand cautious judgment, but with fearless resolution when the time of\r\ncrisis came. He met each crisis on its own merits; he never sought\r\nexcuse for shirking a task in the fact that it was different from the\r\none he had expected to face. The long public career, which opened\r\nwhen as a boy he carried a musket in the ranks and closed when as\r\na man in the prime of his intellectual strength he stood among the\r\nworld’s chief statesmen, came to what it was because he treated\r\neach triumph as opening the road to fresh effort, not as an excuse\r\nfor ceasing from effort. He undertook mighty tasks. Some of them\r\nhe finished completely; others we must finish; and there remain yet\r\nothers which he did not have to face, but which, if we are worthy to\r\nbe the inheritors of his principles, we will in our turn face with the\r\nsame resolution, the same sanity, the same unfaltering belief in the\r\ngreatness of this country, and unfaltering championship of the rights\r\nof each and all of our people, which marked his high and splendid\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT CARNEGIE HALL, NEW YORK, N. Y., FEBRUARY 26, 1903, UPON THE\r\nOCCASION OF THE BI-CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF THE BIRTH OF JOHN WESLEY\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nI am glad to have the chance of addressing this representative body\r\nof the great Church which Wesley founded, on the occasion of the\r\ncommemoration of the two hundredth anniversary of his birth. America,\r\nmoreover, has a peculiar proprietary claim on Wesley’s memory, for\r\nit is on our continent that the Methodist Church has received its\r\ngreatest development. In the days of our Colonial life Methodism was\r\nnot on the whole a great factor in the religious and social life of\r\nthe people. The Congregationalists were supreme throughout most of New\r\nEngland; the Episcopalians on the seaboard from New York southward;\r\nwhile the Presbyterian congregations were most numerous along what was\r\nthen the entire Western frontier; and the Quaker, Catholic, and Dutch\r\nReformed Churches each had developments in special places. The great\r\ngrowth of the Methodist Church, like the great growth of the Baptist\r\nChurch, began at about the time of the Revolutionary War. To-day my\r\ntheme is purely Methodism.\r\n\r\nSince the days of the Revolution not only has the Methodist Church\r\nincreased greatly in the old communities of the thirteen original\r\nStates, but it has played a peculiar and prominent part in the pioneer\r\ngrowth of our country, and has in consequence assumed a position of\r\nimmense importance throughout the vast region west of the Alleghanies\r\nwhich has been added to our Nation since the days when the Continental\r\nCongress first met.\r\n\r\nFor a century after the Declaration of Independence the greatest\r\nwork of our people, with the exception only of the work of\r\nself-preservation under Lincoln, was the work of the pioneers as they\r\ntook possession of this continent. During that century we pushed\r\nwestward from the Alleghanies to the Pacific, southward to the Gulf\r\nand the Rio Grande, and also took possession of Alaska. The work\r\nof advancing our boundary, of pushing the frontier across forest\r\nand desert and mountain chain, was the great typical work of our\r\nNation; and the men who did it—the frontiersmen, the pioneers, the\r\nbackwoodsmen, plainsmen, mountain men—formed a class by themselves.\r\nIt was an iron task, which none but men of iron soul and iron body\r\ncould do. The men who carried it to a successful conclusion had\r\ncharacters strong alike for good and for evil. Their rugged natures\r\nmade them powers who served light or darkness with fierce intensity;\r\nand together with heroic traits they had those evil and dreadful\r\ntendencies which are but too apt to be found in characters of heroic\r\npossibilities. Such men make the most efficient servants of the Lord\r\nif their abounding vitality and energy are directed aright; and if\r\nmisdirected their influence is equally potent against the cause of\r\nChristianity and true civilization. In the hard and cruel life of\r\nthe border, with its grim struggle against the forbidding forces of\r\nwild nature and wilder men, there was much to pull the frontiersman\r\ndown. If left to himself, without moral teaching and moral guidance,\r\nwithout any of the influences that tend toward the uplifting of man\r\nand the subduing of the brute within him, sad would have been his, and\r\ntherefore our, fate. From this fate we have been largely rescued by\r\nthe fact that together with the rest of the pioneers went the pioneer\r\npreachers; and all honor be given to the Methodists for the great\r\nproportion of these pioneer preachers whom they furnished.\r\n\r\nThese preachers were of the stamp of old Peter Cartwright—men who\r\nsuffered and overcame every hardship in common with their flock,\r\nand who in addition tamed the wild and fierce spirits of their\r\nfellow-pioneers. It was not a task that could have been accomplished\r\nby men desirous to live in the soft places of the earth and to walk\r\neasily on life’s journey. They had to possess the spirit of the\r\nmartyrs; but not of martyrs who could merely suffer, not of martyrs\r\nwho could oppose only passive endurance to wrong. The pioneer\r\npreachers warred against the forces of spiritual evil with the same\r\nfiery zeal and energy that they and their fellows showed in the\r\nconquest of the rugged continent. They had in them the heroic spirit,\r\nthe spirit that scorns ease if it must be purchased by failure to\r\ndo duty, the spirit that courts risk and a life of hard endeavor\r\nif the goal to be reached is really worth attaining. Great is our\r\ndebt to these men and scant the patience we need show toward their\r\ncritics. At times they seemed hard and narrow to those whose training\r\nand surroundings had saved them from similar temptations; and they\r\nhave been criticised, as all men, whether missionaries, soldiers,\r\nexplorers, or frontier settlers, are criticised when they go forth\r\nto do the rough work that must inevitably be done by those who act\r\nas the first harbingers, the first heralds, of civilization in the\r\nworld’s dark places. It is easy for those who stay at home in comfort,\r\nwho never have to see humanity in the raw, or to strive against the\r\ndreadful naked forces which appear clothed, hidden, and subdued in\r\ncivilized life—it is easy for such to criticise the men who, in rough\r\nfashion, and amid grim surroundings, make ready the way for the higher\r\nlife that is to come afterward; but let us all remember that the\r\nuntempted and the effortless should be cautious in passing too heavy\r\njudgment upon their brethren who may show hardness, who may be guilty\r\nof shortcomings, but who nevertheless do the great deeds by which\r\nmankind advances. These pioneers of Methodism had the strong, militant\r\nvirtues which go to the accomplishment of such great deeds. Now and\r\nthen they betrayed the shortcomings natural to men of their type; but\r\ntheir shortcomings seem small indeed when we place beside them the\r\nmagnitude of the work they achieved.\r\n\r\nAnd now, friends, in celebrating the wonderful growth of Methodism,\r\nin rejoicing at the good it has done to the country and to mankind,\r\nI need hardly ask a body like this to remember that the greatness of\r\nthe fathers becomes to the children a shameful thing if they use it\r\nonly as an excuse for inaction instead of as a spur to effort for\r\nnoble aims. I speak to you not only as Methodists—I speak to you as\r\nAmerican citizens. The pioneer days are over. We now all of us form\r\nparts of a great civilized nation, with a complex industrial and\r\nsocial life and infinite possibilities both for good and for evil.\r\nThe instruments with which, and the surroundings in which, we work,\r\nhave changed immeasurably from what they were in the days when the\r\nrough backwoods preachers ministered to the moral and spiritual needs\r\nof their rough backwoods congregations. But if we are to succeed, the\r\nspirit in which we do our work must be the same as the spirit in which\r\nthey did theirs. These men drove forward, and fought their way upward,\r\nto success, because their sense of duty was in their hearts, in the\r\nvery marrow of their bones. It was not with them something to be\r\nconsidered as a mere adjunct to their theology, standing separate and\r\napart from their daily life. They had it with them week days as well\r\nas Sundays. They did not divorce the spiritual from the secular. They\r\ndid not have one kind of conscience for one side of their lives and\r\nanother for another.\r\n\r\nIf we are to succeed as a nation we must have the same spirit in us.\r\nWe must be absolutely practical, of course, and must face facts as\r\nthey are. The pioneer preachers of Methodism could not have held their\r\nown for a fortnight if they had not shown an intense practicability of\r\nspirit, if they had not possessed the broadest and deepest sympathy\r\nfor, and understanding of, their fellowmen. But in addition to the\r\nhard, practical common-sense needed by each of us in life, we must\r\nhave a lift toward lofty things or we shall be lost, individually\r\nand collectively, as a nation. Life is not easy, and least of all is\r\nit easy for either the man or the nation that aspires to do great\r\ndeeds. In the century opening, the play of the infinitely far-reaching\r\nforces and tendencies which go to make up our social system bids fair\r\nto be even fiercer in its activity than in the century which has\r\njust closed. If during this century the men of high and fine moral\r\nsense show themselves weaklings; if they possess only that cloistered\r\nvirtue which shrinks shuddering from contact with the raw facts of\r\nactual life; if they dare not go down into the hurly-burly where the\r\nmen of might contend for the mastery; if they stand aside from the\r\npressure and conflict; then as surely as the sun rises and sets all\r\nof our great material progress, all the multiplication of the physical\r\nagencies which tend for our comfort and enjoyment, will go for naught\r\nand our civilization will become a brutal sham and mockery. If we are\r\nto do as I believe we shall and will do, if we are to advance in broad\r\nhumanity, in kindliness, in the spirit of brotherhood, exactly as we\r\nadvance in our conquest over the hidden forces of nature, it must be\r\nby developing strength in virtue and virtue in strength, by breeding\r\nand training men who shall be both good and strong, both gentle and\r\nvaliant—men who scorn wrongdoing, and who at the same time have both\r\nthe courage and the strength to strive mightily for the right. Wesley\r\naccomplished so much for mankind because he refused to leave the\r\nstronger, manlier qualities to be availed of only in the interest\r\nof evil. The Church he founded has through its career been a Church\r\nfor the poor as well as for the rich and has known no distinction of\r\npersons. It has been a Church whose members, if true to the teachings\r\nof its founder, have sought for no greater privilege than to spend\r\nand be spent in the interest of the higher life, who have prided\r\nthemselves, not on shirking rough duty, but on undertaking it and\r\ncarrying it to a successful conclusion.\r\n\r\nI come here to-night to greet you and to pay my tribute to your past\r\nbecause you have deserved well of mankind, because you have striven\r\nwith strength and courage to bring nearer the day when peace and\r\njustice shall obtain among the peoples of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT A MEETING OF THE SOCIETY OF AMERICAN FORESTERS, HELD AT THE\r\nRESIDENCE OF MR. GIFFORD PINCHOT, WASHINGTON, D. C., MARCH 26, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Pinchot, Mr. Secretary, and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nI have felt that this evening the meeting was of such a character\r\nas not merely to warrant but in a sense require that I should break\r\nthrough my custom of not coming out to make speeches of this sort. For\r\nI believe there are few bodies of men who have it in their power to do\r\na greater service to the country than those engaged in the scientific\r\nstudy and practical application of improved methods of forestry for\r\nthe preservation of our woods in the United States. I am glad to see\r\nhere this evening not only the officials, including the head, of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, but those, like Governor Richards, most\r\nconcerned in carrying out the policy of the Department of the Interior.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, you can never afford to forget for one moment what\r\nis the object of the forest policy. Primarily that object is not to\r\npreserve forests because they are beautiful—though that is good in\r\nitself;—not to preserve them because they are refuges for the wild\r\ncreatures of the wilderness—though that too is good in itself—but\r\nthe primary object of the forest policy as of the land policy of\r\nthe United States, is the making of prosperous homes, is part of\r\nthe traditional policy of home-making of our country. Every other\r\nconsideration comes as secondary. The whole effort of the government\r\nin dealing with the forests must be directed to this end, keeping in\r\nview the fact that it is not only necessary to start the homes as\r\nprosperous, but to keep them so. That is the way the forests have\r\nneed to be kept. You can start a prosperous home by destroying the\r\nforest, but you do not keep it. You will be able to make that policy\r\npermanently the policy of the country only in so far as you are able\r\nto make the people at large, and then all the people concretely,\r\ninterested in the results in the different localities, appreciative\r\nof what it means; give them a full recognition of its value, and make\r\nthem earnest and zealous adherents of it. Keep that in mind too. In a\r\ngovernment such as ours it is out of the question to impose a policy\r\nlike this upon the people from without. A permanent policy can come\r\nonly from the intelligent conviction of the people themselves that it\r\nis wise, and useful; nay, indispensable. We shall decide in the long\r\nrun whether we will or will not preserve the forests of the Rocky\r\nMountains accordingly as we are or are not able to make the people\r\nof the States around the mountains, in their neighborhood, hearty\r\nbelievers in the policy of forest preservation. This is the only way\r\nin which this policy can be made a permanent success. In other words,\r\nyou must convince the people of the truth—and it is the truth—that\r\nthe success of home-makers depends in the long run upon the wisdom\r\nwith which the Nation takes care of its forests. That seems a strong\r\nstatement. It is none too strong. There are small sections of this\r\ncountry where what is done with the woodlands makes no difference;\r\nbut over the great extent of the country the ultimate well-being of\r\nthe home-maker will depend in very large part upon the intelligent\r\nuse made of the forests. In other words, you, yourselves, must keep\r\nthis practical object before your mind. You must remember that the\r\nforest which contributes nothing to the wealth, progress, or safety\r\nof the country is of no interest to the government, and it should be\r\nof little to the forester. Your attention should be directed not to\r\nthe preservation of the forests as an end in itself, but as the means\r\nfor preserving and increasing the prosperity of the Nation. Forestry\r\nis the preservation of forests by wise use. We shall succeed, not by\r\npreventing the use, but by making the forests of use to the settler,\r\nthe rancher, the miner, the man who lives in the neighborhood, and\r\nindirectly the man who may live hundreds of miles off, down the course\r\nof some great river which has its rise among the forests.\r\n\r\nThe forest problem is in many ways the most vital internal problem\r\nof the United States. The more closely this statement is examined\r\nthe more evident its truth becomes. In the arid regions of the West\r\nagricultural prosperity depends first of all upon the available\r\nwater supply. Forest protection alone can maintain the streamflow\r\nnecessary for irrigation in the West and prevent floods destructive\r\nto agriculture and manufactures in the East. The relation between\r\nforests and the whole mineral industry is an extremely intimate one,\r\nfor mines can not be developed without timber, and usually not without\r\ntimber close at hand. In many regions of the West ore is more abundant\r\nthan wood, and where the ore is of low grade, transportation of the\r\nnecessary mine timbers from a distance is out of the question. The use\r\nof the mine is strictly limited to the man who has timber available\r\nclose at hand. The very existence of lumbering, the fourth great\r\nindustry of the United States, depends upon the success of your work\r\nand our work as a Nation in putting practical forestry into effective\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nAs it is with mining and lumbering, so it is in only less degree with\r\ntransportation, manufacture, and commerce in general. The relation\r\nof all these industries to the forests is of the most intimate and\r\ndependent kind. It is a matter for congratulation that so many of\r\nthese great interests are waking up to this fact. The railroads,\r\nespecially, managed as they are by men who are obliged by the very\r\nnature of their profession to possess insight into the future, have\r\nawakened to a clearer realization of the vast importance of economical\r\nuse both of timber and of forests. Even the grazing industry, as it\r\nis carried out in the great West, which might at first sight appear\r\nto have little relation to forestry, is nevertheless closely related\r\nto it, because great areas of winter range would be entirely useless\r\nwithout the summer range in the mountains, where the forest reserves\r\nlie.\r\n\r\nThe forest resources of our country are already seriously depleted.\r\nThey can be renewed and maintained only by the co-operation of the\r\nforester and the lumberman. The most striking and encouraging fact in\r\nthe forest situation is that lumbermen are realizing that practical\r\nlumbering and practical forestry are allies and not enemies, and that\r\nthe future of each depends upon the other. The resolutions passed\r\nat the last great meeting of the representative lumber interests\r\nheld here in Washington are strong proof of this fact and the most\r\nencouraging feature of the present situation. As long as we could not\r\nmake the men concerned in the great lumbering industry realize that\r\nthe foresters were endeavoring to work in their interests and not\r\nagainst them, the headway that could be made was but small. And we\r\nwill be able to work effectively to bring about immediate results of\r\npermanent importance largely in proportion as we are able to convince\r\nthe men at the head of that great business of the practical wisdom of\r\nwhat the foresters of the United States are seeking to accomplish. In\r\nthe last analysis, the attitude of the lumbermen toward your work will\r\nbe the chief factor of the success or failure of that work. In other\r\nwords, gentlemen, I can not too often say to you, as indeed it can not\r\nbe too often said to any body of men of high ideals and of scientific\r\ntraining who are endeavoring to accomplish work of real worth for the\r\ncountry, you must keep your ideals, and yet seek to realize them in\r\npractical ways.\r\n\r\nThe United States is exhausting its forest supplies far more\r\nrapidly than they are being produced. The situation is a grave one,\r\nand there is but one remedy. That remedy is the introduction of\r\npractical forestry on a large scale, and of course that is impossible\r\nwithout trained men; men trained in the closet and trained by actual\r\nfield work, under practical conditions. You will have created a new\r\nprofession; a profession of the highest importance; a profession of\r\nthe highest usefulness toward the State; and you are in honor bound\r\nto yourselves and to the people to make your profession stand as\r\nhigh as the profession of law, as the profession of medicine, as\r\nany other profession most intimately connected with our highest and\r\nfinest development as a nation. You are engaged in pioneer work in a\r\ncalling whose opportunities for public service are very great. Treat\r\nthe calling seriously; remember how much it means for the country as a\r\nwhole; remember that if you do your work in crude fashion, if you only\r\nhalf learn your profession, you discredit it as well as yourselves.\r\nGive yourselves every chance by thorough and generous preparation and\r\nby acquiring not only a thorough knowledge, but a wide outlook over\r\nall the questions on which you have to touch. The profession which you\r\nhave adopted is one which touches the Republic on almost every side,\r\npolitical, social, industrial, commercial; and to rise to its level\r\nyou will need a wide acquaintance with the general life of the Nation,\r\nand a viewpoint both broad and high. Any profession which makes you\r\ndeal with your fellowmen at large makes it necessary that, if you\r\nare to succeed, you should understand what these fellowmen are, and\r\nnot merely what they are thought to be by people who live in the\r\ncloset and the parlor. You must know who the men are with whom you are\r\nacting; how they feel; how far you can go; when you have to stop; when\r\nit is necessary to push on; you must know all of these things if you\r\nare going to do work of the highest value.\r\n\r\nI believe that the foresters of the United States will create and\r\napply a more effective system of forestry than we have yet seen. If\r\nyou don’t, gentlemen, I will feel that you have fallen behind your\r\nbrethren of other callings; and I don’t believe you will fall behind\r\nthem. Nowhere else is the development of a country more closely bound\r\nup with the creation and execution of a judicious forest policy. This\r\nis of course especially true of the West; but it is true of the East\r\nalso. Fortunately in the West we have been able relatively to the\r\ngrowth of the country to begin at an earlier day; so that we have been\r\nable to provide great forest reserves in the Rocky Mountains, instead\r\nof waiting and attempting to get Congress to pay a very large sum\r\nfor their creation, as we are now endeavoring to do in the Southern\r\nAppalachians. In the administration of the national forest reserves,\r\nthe introduction of conservative lumbering on the timber tract of the\r\nlumberman and the woodlot of the farmer, in the practical solution of\r\nforest problems which affect every industry and every activity of the\r\nnation, the members of this society have an unexampled field before\r\nthem. You have heavy responsibilities—every man that does any work\r\nthat is worth doing has a heavy responsibility—for upon the quality\r\nof your work the development of forestry in the United States and\r\nthe protection of the industries which depend upon it will largely\r\nrest. You have made a good beginning, and I congratulate you upon\r\nit. Not only is a sound national forest policy coming rapidly into\r\nbeing, but the lumbermen of the country are proving their interest\r\nin forestry by practicing it. Twenty years ago a meeting such as\r\nthis to-night would have been impossible, and the desires we hear\r\nexpressed would have been treated as having no possible relation to\r\npractical life. I think, Mr. Secretary, that since you first came into\r\nCongress here there has been a complete revolution in the attitude\r\nof public men toward this question. We have reached a point where\r\nAmerican foresters, trained in American forest schools, are attacking\r\nAmerican forest problems with success. That is the way to meet the\r\nlarger work you have before you. It is a work of peculiar difficulty,\r\nbecause precedents are lacking. It will demand training, steadiness,\r\ndevotion, and above all _esprit de corps_, fealty to the body of which\r\nyou are members, zeal to keep the practice as well as the ideals of\r\nthat body high. The more harmoniously you work with each other, the\r\nbetter your work will be. And above all a condition precedent upon\r\nyour usefulness to the body politic as a whole is the way in which\r\nyou are able both to instil your own ideals into the mass of your\r\nfellowmen with whom you come in contact, and at the same time to show\r\nyour ability to work in practical fashion with them; to convince them\r\nthat as a business matter it will pay for them to co-operate with\r\nyou; to convince the public of that, and then also so to convince the\r\npeople of the localities, of the neighborhoods in which you work, and\r\nespecially the lumbermen and all others who make their life trades\r\ndealing with the forests.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT CHICAGO, ILL., APRIL 2, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman, Ladies, and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nTo-day I wish to speak to you, not merely about the Monroe Doctrine,\r\nbut about our entire position in the Western Hemisphere—a position\r\nso peculiar and predominant that out of it has grown the acceptance\r\nof the Monroe Doctrine as a cardinal feature of our foreign policy;\r\nand in particular I wish to point out what has been done during the\r\nlifetime of the last Congress to make good our position in accordance\r\nwith this historic policy.\r\n\r\nEver since the time when we definitely extended our boundaries\r\nwestward to the Pacific and southward to the Gulf, since the time\r\nwhen the old Spanish and Portuguese colonies to the south of us\r\nasserted their independence, our Nation has insisted that because of\r\nits primacy in strength among the nations of the Western Hemisphere\r\nit has certain duties and responsibilities which oblige it to take a\r\nleading part thereon. We hold that our interests in this hemisphere\r\nare greater than those of any European power possibly can be, and\r\nthat our duty to ourselves and to the weaker republics who are our\r\nneighbors requires us to see that none of the great military powers\r\nfrom across the seas shall encroach upon the territory of the American\r\nrepublics or acquire control thereover.\r\n\r\nThis policy, therefore, not only forbids us to acquiesce in such\r\nterritorial acquisition, but also causes us to object to the\r\nacquirement of a control which would in its effect be equal to\r\nterritorial aggrandizement. This is why the United States has steadily\r\nbelieved that the construction of the great Isthmian Canal, the\r\nbuilding of which is to stand as the greatest material feat of the\r\ntwentieth century—greater than any similar feat in any preceding\r\ncentury—should be done by no foreign nation but by ourselves. The\r\ncanal must of necessity go through the territory of one of our smaller\r\nsister republics. We have been scrupulously careful to abstain from\r\nperpetrating any wrong upon any of these republics in this matter.\r\nWe do not wish to interfere with their rights in the least, but,\r\nwhile carefully safeguarding them, to build the canal ourselves under\r\nprovisions which will enable us, if necessary, to police and protect\r\nit, and to guarantee its neutrality, we being the sole guarantor. Our\r\nintention was steadfast; we desired action taken so that the canal\r\ncould always be used by us in time of peace and war alike, and in\r\ntime of war could never be used to our detriment by any nation which\r\nwas hostile to us. Such action, by the circumstances surrounding it,\r\nwas necessarily for the benefit and not the detriment of the adjacent\r\nAmerican republics.\r\n\r\nAfter considerably more than half of a century these objects have\r\nbeen exactly fulfilled by the legislation and treaties of the last\r\ntwo years. Two years ago we were no further advanced toward the\r\nconstruction of the Isthmian Canal on our terms than we had been\r\nduring the preceding eighty years. By the Hay-Pauncefote treaty,\r\nratified in December, 1901, an old treaty with Great Britain, which\r\nhad been held to stand in the way, was abrogated and it was agreed\r\nthat the canal should be constructed under the auspices of the\r\nGovernment of the United States, and that this Government should have\r\nthe exclusive right to regulate and manage it, becoming the sole\r\nguarantor of its neutrality.\r\n\r\nIt was expressly stipulated, furthermore, that this guaranty of\r\nneutrality should not prevent the United States from taking any\r\nmeasures which it found necessary in order to secure by its own\r\nforces the defence of the United States and the maintenance of\r\npublic order. Immediately following this treaty Congress passed a\r\nlaw under which the President was authorized to endeavor to secure\r\na treaty for acquiring the right to finish the construction of, and\r\nto operate, the Panama Canal, which had already been begun in the\r\nterritory of Colombia by a French company. The rights of this company\r\nwere accordingly obtained and a treaty negotiated with the Republic\r\nof Colombia. This treaty has just been ratified by the Senate. It\r\nreserves all of Colombia’s rights, while guaranteeing all of our\r\nown and those of neutral nations, and specifically permits us to\r\ntake any and all measures for the defence of the canal, and for the\r\npreservation of our interests, whenever in our judgment an exigency\r\nmay arise which calls for action on our part. In other words, these\r\ntwo treaties, and the legislation to carry them out, have resulted\r\nin our obtaining on exactly the terms we desired the rights and\r\nprivileges which we had so long sought in vain. These treaties are\r\namong the most important that we have ever negotiated in their effects\r\nupon the future welfare of this country, and mark a memorable triumph\r\nof American diplomacy—one of those fortunate triumphs, moreover, which\r\nredound to the benefit of the entire world.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time trouble arose in connection with the Republic of\r\nVenezuela because of certain wrongs alleged to have been committed,\r\nand debts overdue, by this Republic to citizens of various foreign\r\npowers, notably England, Germany, and Italy. After failure to reach an\r\nagreement these powers began a blockade of the Venezuelan coast and a\r\ncondition of quasi-war ensued. The concern of our Government was of\r\ncourse not to interfere needlessly in any quarrel so far as it did\r\nnot touch our interests or our honor, and not to take the attitude\r\nof protecting from coercion any power unless we were willing to\r\nespouse the quarrel of that power, but to keep an attitude of watchful\r\nvigilance and see that there was no infringement of the Monroe\r\nDoctrine—no acquirement of territorial rights by a European power at\r\nthe expense of a weak sister republic—whether this acquisition might\r\ntake the shape of an outright and avowed seizure of territory or of\r\nthe exercise of control which would in effect be equivalent to such\r\nseizure. This attitude was expressed in the two following published\r\nmemoranda, the first being the letter addressed by the Secretary of\r\nState to the German Ambassador, the second the conversation with the\r\nSecretary of State reported by the British Ambassador:\r\n\r\n                          “DEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n                    “WASHINGTON, _December 16, 1901_.\r\n\r\n                 “HIS EXCELLENCY DR. VON HOLLEBEN, etc.:\r\n\r\n  “_Dear Excellency_: I inclose a memorandum by way of reply to that\r\n  which you did me the honor to leave with me on Saturday, and am, as\r\n  ever,\r\n\r\n                                                  “Faithfully yours,\r\n                                                             “JOHN HAY.\r\n\r\n                             “_Memorandum._\r\n\r\n  “The President in his message of the 3d of December, 1901, used the\r\n  following language:\r\n\r\n  “The Monroe Doctrine is a declaration that there must be no\r\n  territorial aggrandizement by any non-American power at the expense\r\n  of any American power on American soil. It is in no wise intended as\r\n  hostile to any nation in the Old World.’”\r\n\r\n  “The President further said:\r\n\r\n  “‘This doctrine has nothing to do with the commercial relations of\r\n  any American power, save that it in truth allows each of them to\r\n  form such as it desires.... We do not guarantee any State against\r\n  punishment if it misconducts itself, provided that punishment\r\n  does not take the form of the acquisition of territory by any\r\n  non-American power.’\r\n\r\n  “His Excellency the German Ambassador, on his recent return from\r\n  Berlin, conveyed personally to the President the assurance of the\r\n  German Emperor that His Majesty’s Government had no purpose or\r\n  intention to make even the smallest acquisition of territory on the\r\n  South American continent or the islands adjacent. This voluntary\r\n  and friendly declaration was afterward repeated to the Secretary\r\n  of State, and was received by the President and the people of the\r\n  United States in the frank and cordial spirit in which it was\r\n  offered. In the memorandum of the 11th of December, His Excellency\r\n  the German Ambassador repeats these assurances as follows: ‘We\r\n  declare especially that under no circumstances do we consider in\r\n  our proceedings the acquisition or the permanent occupation of\r\n  Venezuelan territory.’\r\n\r\n  “In the said memorandum of the 11th of December, the German\r\n  Government informs that of the United States that it has certain\r\n  just claims for money and for damages wrongfully withheld from\r\n  German subjects by the Government of Venezuela, and that it proposes\r\n  to take certain coercive measures described in the memorandum to\r\n  enforce the payment of these just claims.\r\n\r\n  “The President of the United States, appreciating the courtesy of\r\n  the German Government in making him acquainted with the state of\r\n  affairs referred to, and not regarding himself as called upon to\r\n  enter into the consideration of the claims in question, believes\r\n  that no measures will be taken in this matter by the agents of the\r\n  German Government which are not in accordance with the well-known\r\n  purpose, above set forth, of His Majesty the German Emperor.”\r\n\r\n                  SIR MICHAEL HERBERT TO THE MARQUIS OF\r\n                               LANSDOWNE.\r\n\r\n                    “WASHINGTON, _November 13, 1902_.\r\n\r\n  “I communicated to Mr. Hay this morning the substance of Your\r\n  Lordship’s telegram of the 11th instant.\r\n\r\n  “His Excellency stated in reply, that the United States Government,\r\n  although they regretted that European powers should use force\r\n  against Central and South American countries, could not object\r\n  to their taking steps to obtain redress for injuries suffered by\r\n  their subjects, provided that no acquisition of territory was\r\n  contemplated.”\r\n\r\nBoth powers assured us in explicit terms that there was not the\r\nslightest intention on their part to violate the principles of the\r\nMonroe Doctrine, and this assurance was kept with an honorable good\r\nfaith which merits full acknowledgment on our part. At the same time,\r\nthe existence of hostilities in a region so near our own borders was\r\nfraught with such possibilities of danger in the future that it was\r\nobviously no less our duty to ourselves than our duty to humanity\r\nto endeavor to put an end to that. Accordingly, by an offer of our\r\ngood services in a spirit of frank friendliness to all the parties\r\nconcerned, a spirit in which they quickly and cordially responded, we\r\nsecured a resumption of peace—the contending parties agreeing that\r\nthe matters which they could not settle among themselves should be\r\nreferred to The Hague Tribunal for settlement. The United States had\r\nmost fortunately already been able to set an example to other nations\r\nby utilizing the great possibilities for good contained in The Hague\r\nTribunal, a question at issue between ourselves and the Republic\r\nof Mexico being the first submitted to this international court of\r\narbitration.\r\n\r\nThe terms which we have secured as those under which the Isthmian\r\nCanal is to be built, and the course of events in the Venezuela\r\nmatter, have shown not merely the ever growing influence of the United\r\nStates in the Western Hemisphere, but also, I think I may safely say,\r\nhave exemplified the firm purpose of the United States that its growth\r\nand influence and power shall redound not to the harm but to the\r\nbenefit of our sister republics whose strength is less. Our growth,\r\ntherefore, is beneficial to humankind in general. We do not intend\r\nto assume any position which can give just offence to our neighbors.\r\nOur adherence to the rule of human right is not merely profession.\r\nThe history of our dealings with Cuba shows that we reduce it to\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nThe Monroe Doctrine is not international law, and though I think one\r\nday it may become such, this is not necessary as long as it remains a\r\ncardinal feature of our foreign policy and as long as we possess both\r\nthe will and the strength to make it effective. This last point, my\r\nfellow-citizens, is all important, and is one which as a people we\r\ncan never afford to forget. I believe in the Monroe Doctrine with all\r\nmy heart and soul; I am convinced that the immense majority of our\r\nfellow-countrymen so believe in it; but I would infinitely prefer to\r\nsee us abandon it than to see us put it forward and bluster about it,\r\nand yet fail to build up the efficient fighting strength which in the\r\nlast resort can alone make it respected by any strong foreign power\r\nwhose interest it may ever happen to be to violate it.\r\n\r\nBoasting and blustering are as objectionable among nations as among\r\nindividuals, and the public men of a great nation owe it to their\r\nsense of national self-respect to speak courteously of foreign\r\npowers, just as a brave and self-respecting man treats all around him\r\ncourteously. But though to boast is bad, and causelessly to insult\r\nanother, worse, yet worse than all is it to be guilty of boasting,\r\neven without insult, and when called to the proof to be unable to\r\nmake such boasting good. There is a homely old adage which runs:\r\n“Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.” If the American\r\nNation will speak softly, and yet build, and keep at a pitch of the\r\nhighest training, a thoroughly efficient navy, the Monroe Doctrine\r\nwill go far. I ask you to think over this. If you do, you will come to\r\nthe conclusion that it is mere plain common-sense, so obviously sound\r\nthat only the blind can fail to see its truth and only the weakest and\r\nmost irresolute can fail to desire to put it into force.\r\n\r\nIn the last two years I am happy to say we have taken long strides\r\nin advance as regards our navy. The last Congress, in addition to\r\nsmaller vessels, provided nine of those formidable fighting ships\r\nupon which the real efficiency of any navy in war ultimately depends.\r\nIt provided, moreover, for the necessary addition of officers and\r\nenlisted men to make the ships worth having. Meanwhile the Navy\r\nDepartment has seen to it that our ships have been constantly\r\nexercised at sea, with the great guns, and in manœuvres, so that\r\ntheir efficiency as fighting units, both individually and when acting\r\ntogether, has been steadily improved. Remember that all of this is\r\nnecessary. A warship is a huge bit of mechanism, wellnigh as delicate\r\nand complicated as it is formidable. It takes years to build it. It\r\ntakes years to teach the officers and men how to handle it to good\r\nadvantage. It is an absolute impossibility to improvise a navy at the\r\noutset of war. No recent war between any two nations has lasted as\r\nlong as it takes to build a battleship; and it is just as impossible\r\nto improvise the officers or the crews as to improvise the navy.\r\n\r\nTo lay up a battleship and only send it afloat at the outset of a war,\r\nwith a raw crew and untried officers, would be not merely a folly but\r\na crime, for it would invite both disaster and disgrace. The navy\r\nwhich so quickly decided in our favor in the war in 1898 had been\r\nbuilt and made efficient during the preceding fifteen years. The ships\r\nthat triumphed off Manila and Santiago had been built under previous\r\nAdministrations with money appropriated by previous Congresses. The\r\nofficers and the men did their duty so well because they had already\r\nbeen trained to it by long sea service. All honor to the gallant\r\nofficers and gallant men who actually did the fighting; but remember,\r\ntoo, to honor the public men, the shipwrights and steel workers, the\r\nowners of the shipyards and armor plants, to whose united foresight\r\nand exertion we owe it that in 1898 we had craft so good, guns so\r\nexcellent, and American seamen of so high a type in the conning\r\ntowers, in the gun-turrets, and in the engine rooms. It is too late to\r\nprepare for war when war has come; and if we only prepare sufficiently\r\nno war will ever come. We wish a powerful and efficient navy, not for\r\npurposes of war, but as the surest guarantee of peace. If we have such\r\na navy—if we keep on building it up—we may rest assured that there is\r\nbut the smallest chance that trouble will ever come to this Nation;\r\nand we may likewise rest assured that no foreign power will ever\r\nquarrel with us about the Monroe Doctrine.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT WAUKESHA, WIS., APRIL 3, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen and Ladies; my Fellow-Citizens of Wisconsin_:\r\n\r\nYou are men and women of Wisconsin, but you are men and women of\r\nAmerica first. I am glad of having the chance of saying a few words\r\nto you to-day. I believe with all my heart in this Nation playing its\r\npart manfully and well. I believe that we are now, at the outset of\r\nthe twentieth century, face to face with great world problems; that\r\nwe can not help playing the part of a great world power; that all\r\nwe can decide is whether we will play it well or ill. I do not want\r\nto see us shrink from any least bit of duty. We have not only taken\r\nduring the past five years a position of even greater importance\r\nin this Western Hemisphere than ever before, but we have taken a\r\nposition of great importance even in the furthest Orient, in that\r\nfurthest West, which is the immemorial East. We must hold our own.\r\nIf we show ourselves weaklings we will earn the contempt of mankind,\r\nand—what is of far more consequence—our own contempt; but I would like\r\nto impress upon every public man, upon every writer in the press,\r\nthe fact that strength should go hand in hand with courtesy, with\r\nscrupulous regard in word and deed, not only for the rights, but for\r\nthe feelings, of other nations. I want to see a man able to hold his\r\nown. I have no respect for the man who will put up with injustice.\r\nIf a man will not take his part, the part is not worth taking. That\r\nis true. On the other hand, I have a hearty contempt for the man who\r\nis always walking about wanting to pick a quarrel, and above all,\r\nwanting to say something unpleasant about some one else. He is not an\r\nagreeable character anywhere; and the fact that he talks loud does\r\nnot necessarily mean that he fights hard either. Sometimes you will\r\nsee a man who will talk loud and fight hard; but he does not fight\r\nhard because he talks loud, but in spite of it. I want the same thing\r\nto be true of us as a nation. I am always sorry whenever I see any\r\nreflection that seems to come from America upon any friendly nation.\r\nTo write or say anything unkind, unjust, or inconsiderate about any\r\nforeign nation does not do us any good, and does not help us toward\r\nholding our own if ever the need should arise to hold our own. I am\r\nsure you will not misunderstand me; I am sure that it is needless\r\nfor me to say that I do not believe the United States should ever\r\nsuffer a wrong. I should be the first to ask that we resent a wrong\r\nfrom the strong, just as I should be the first to insist that we do\r\nnot wrong the weak. As a nation, if we are to be true to our past,\r\nwe must steadfastly keep these two positions—to submit to no injury\r\nby the strong and to inflict no injury on the weak. It is not at all\r\nnecessary to say disagreeable things about the strong in order to\r\nimpress them with the fact that we do not intend to submit to injury.\r\nKeep our navy up to the highest point of efficiency; have good ships,\r\nand enough of them; have the officers and the enlisted men on them\r\ntrained to handle them, so that in the future the American navy shall\r\nrise level, whenever the need comes, to the standard it has set in\r\nthe past. Keep in our own hearts the rugged, manly virtues, which\r\nhave made our people formidable as foes, and valuable as friends\r\nthroughout the century and a quarter of our national life. Do all\r\nthat; and having done it, remember that it is a sensible thing to\r\nspeak courteously of others.\r\n\r\nI believe in the Monroe Doctrine. I shall try to see that this Nation\r\nlives up to it; and as long as I am President it will be lived up to.\r\nBut I do not intend to make the doctrine an excuse or a justification\r\nfor being unpleasant to other powers, for speaking ill of other\r\npowers. We want the friendship of mankind. We want to get on well\r\nwith the other nations of mankind, with the small nations and with\r\nthe big nations. We want so to carry ourselves that if (which I think\r\nmost unlikely) any quarrel should arise, it would be evident that it\r\nwas not a quarrel of our own seeking, but one that was forced on us.\r\nIf it is forced on us, I know you too well not to know that you will\r\nstand up to it if the need comes; but you will stand up to it all\r\nthe better if you have not blustered or spoken ill of other nations\r\nin advance. We want friendship; we want peace. We wish well to the\r\nnations of mankind. We look with joy at any prosperity of theirs; we\r\nwish them success, not failure. We rejoice as mankind moves forward\r\nover the whole earth. Each nation has its own difficulties. We have\r\ndifficulties enough at home. Let us improve ourselves, lifting what\r\nneeds to be lifted here, and let others do their own work; let us\r\nattend to our own business; keep our own hearthstone swept and in\r\norder. Do not shirk any duty; do not shirk any difficulty that is\r\nforced upon us, but do not invite it by foolish language. Do not\r\nassume a quarrelsome and unpleasant attitude toward other people. Let\r\nthe friendly expressions of foreign powers be accepted as tokens of\r\ntheir sincere good will, and reflecting their real sentiments; and\r\nlet us avoid any language on our part which might tend to turn their\r\ngood will into ill will. All that is mere common-sense; the kind of\r\ncommon-sense that we apply in our own lives, man to man, neighbor to\r\nneighbor; and remember that substantially what is true among nations\r\nis true on a small scale among ourselves. The man who is a weakling,\r\nwho is a coward, we all despise, and we ought to despise him. If a man\r\ncan not do his own work and take his own part, he does not count; and\r\nI have no patience with those who would have the United States unable\r\nto take its own part, to do its work in the world. But remember that a\r\nloose tongue is just as unfortunate an accompaniment for a nation as\r\nfor an individual. The man who talks ill of his neighbors, the man\r\nwho invites trouble for himself and them, is a nuisance. The stronger,\r\nthe more self-confident the nation is, the more carefully it should\r\nguard its speech as well as its action, and should make it a point, in\r\nthe interest of its own self-respect, to see that it does not say what\r\nit can not make good, that it avoids giving needless offence, that it\r\nshows genuinely and sincerely its desire for friendship with the rest\r\nof mankind, but that it keeps itself in shape to make its weight felt\r\nshould the need arise.\r\n\r\nThat is in substance my theory of what our foreign policy should be.\r\nLet us not boast, not insult any one, but make up our minds coolly\r\nwhat is necessary to say, say it, and then stand to it, whatever the\r\nconsequences may be.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT MILWAUKEE, WIS., APRIL 3, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Toastmaster, Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nTo-day I wish to speak to you on the question of the control and\r\nregulation of those great corporations which are popularly, although\r\nrather vaguely, known as trusts; dealing mostly with what has actually\r\nbeen accomplished in the way of legislation and in the way of\r\nenforcement of legislation during the past eighteen months, the period\r\ncovering the two sessions of the Fifty-seventh Congress. At the outset\r\nI shall ask you to remember that I do not approach the subject either\r\nfrom the standpoint of those who speak of themselves as anti-trust\r\nor anti-corporation people, nor yet from the standpoint of those\r\nwho are fond of denying the existence of evils in the trusts, or who\r\napparently proceed upon the assumption that if a corporation is large\r\nenough it can do no wrong.\r\n\r\nI think I speak for the great majority of the American people when\r\nI say that we are not in the least against wealth as such, whether\r\nindividual or corporate; that we merely desire to see any abuse of\r\ncorporate or combined wealth corrected and remedied; that we do not\r\ndesire the abolition or destruction of big corporations, but, on the\r\ncontrary, recognize them as being in many cases efficient economic\r\ninstruments, the results of an inevitable process of economic\r\nevolution, and only desire to see them regulated and controlled so far\r\nas may be necessary to subserve the public good. We should be false\r\nto the historic principles of our government if we discriminated,\r\neither by legislation or administration, either for or against a man\r\nbecause of either his wealth or his poverty. There is no proper place\r\nin our society either for the rich man who uses the power conferred\r\nby his riches to enable him to oppress and wrong his neighbors, nor\r\nyet for the demagogic agitator who, instead of attacking abuses as all\r\nabuses should be attacked wherever found, attacks property, attacks\r\nprosperity, attacks men of wealth, as such, whether they be good or\r\nbad, attacks corporations whether they do well or ill, and seeks, in\r\na spirit of ignorant rancor, to overthrow the very foundations upon\r\nwhich rests our national well-being.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the extraordinary industrial changes of the last\r\nhalf century, and notably of the last two or three decades, changes\r\ndue mainly to the rapidity and complexity of our industrial growth, we\r\nare confronted with problems which in their present shape were unknown\r\nto our forefathers. Our great prosperity, with its accompanying\r\nconcentration of population and of wealth, its extreme specialization\r\nof faculties, and its development of giant industrial leaders, has\r\nbrought much good and some evil, and it is as foolish to ignore the\r\ngood as wilfully to blind ourselves to the evil.\r\n\r\nThe evil has been partly the inevitable accompaniment of the social\r\nchanges, and where this is the case it can be cured neither by law nor\r\nby the administration of the law, the only remedy lying in the slow\r\nchange of character and of economic environment. But for a portion\r\nof the evil, at least, we think that remedies can be found. We know\r\nwell the danger of false remedies, and we are against all violent,\r\nradical, and unwise change. But we believe that by proceeding slowly,\r\nyet resolutely, with good sense and moderation, and also with a firm\r\ndetermination not to be swerved from our course either by foolish\r\nclamor or by any base or sinister influence, we can accomplish much\r\nfor the betterment of conditions.\r\n\r\nNearly two years ago, speaking at the State Fair in Minnesota, I said:\r\n\r\n“It is probably true that the large majority of the fortunes that\r\nnow exist in this country have been amassed, not by injuring our\r\npeople, but as an incident to the conferring of great benefits\r\nupon the community, and this no matter what may have been the\r\nconscious purpose of those amassing them. There is but the scantiest\r\njustification for most of the outcry against the men of wealth _as\r\nsuch_; and it ought to be unnecessary to state that any appeal which\r\ndirectly or indirectly leads to suspicion and hatred among ourselves,\r\nwhich tends to limit opportunity, and therefore to shut the door\r\nof success against poor men of talent, and, finally, which entails\r\nthe possibility of lawlessness and violence, is an attack upon the\r\nfundamental properties of American citizenship. Our interests are at\r\nbottom common; in the long run we go up or go down together. Yet more\r\nand more it is evident that the State, and if necessary the Nation,\r\nhas got to possess the right of supervision and control as regards the\r\ngreat corporations which are its creatures; particularly as regards\r\nthe great business combinations which derive a portion of their\r\nimportance from the existence of some monopolistic tendency. The right\r\nshould be exercised with caution and self-restraint; but it should\r\nexist, so that it may be invoked if the need arises.”\r\n\r\nLast fall in speaking at Cincinnati I said:\r\n\r\n“The necessary supervision and control, in which I firmly believe as\r\nthe only method of eliminating the real evils of the trusts, must\r\ncome through wisely and cautiously framed legislation, which shall\r\naim in the first place to give definite control to some sovereign\r\nover the great corporations, and which shall be followed, when once\r\nthis power has been conferred, by a system giving to the government\r\nthe full knowledge which is the essential for satisfactory action.\r\nThen, when this knowledge—one of the essential features of which is\r\nproper publicity—has been gained, what further steps of any kind are\r\nnecessary can be taken with the confidence born of the possession\r\nof power to deal with the subject, and of a thorough knowledge of\r\nwhat should and can be done in the matter. We need additional power,\r\nand we need knowledge.... Such legislation—whether obtainable now\r\nor obtainable only after a Constitutional amendment—should provide\r\nfor a reasonable supervision, the most prominent feature of which at\r\nfirst should be publicity; that is, the making public, both to the\r\ngovernment authorities and to the people at large, the essential facts\r\nin which the public is concerned. This would give us exact knowledge\r\nof many points which are now not only in doubt but the subject of\r\nfierce controversy. Moreover, the mere fact of the publication would\r\ncure some very grave evils, for the light of day is a deterrent to\r\nwrongdoing. It would doubtless disclose other evils with which, for\r\nthe time being, we could devise no way to grapple. Finally, it would\r\ndisclose others which could be grappled with and cured by further\r\nlegislative action.”\r\n\r\nIn my Message to Congress for 1901 I said:\r\n\r\n“In the interest of the whole people the Nation should, without\r\ninterfering with the power of the States in the matter, itself also\r\nassume power of supervision and regulation over all corporations\r\ndoing an interstate business.”\r\n\r\nThe views thus expressed have now received effect by the wise,\r\nconservative, and yet far-reaching legislation enacted by Congress at\r\nits last session. In its wisdom Congress enacted the very important\r\nlaw providing a Department of Commerce and Labor, and further\r\nproviding therein under the Secretary of Commerce and Labor for a\r\nCommissioner of Corporations, charged with the duty of supervision\r\nof and of making intelligent investigation into the organization and\r\nconduct of corporations engaged in interstate commerce. His powers\r\nto expose illegal or hurtful practices and to obtain all information\r\nneedful for the purposes of further intelligent legislation seem\r\nadequate; and the publicity justifiable and proper for public purposes\r\nis satisfactory guaranteed. The law was passed at the very end of the\r\nsession of Congress. Owing to the lateness of its passage Congress\r\nwas not able to provide proper equipment for the new Department;\r\nand the first few months must necessarily be spent in the work of\r\norganization, and the first investigations must necessarily be of a\r\ntentative character. The satisfactory development of such a system\r\nrequires time and great labor. Those who are intrusted with the\r\nadministration of the new law will assuredly administer it in a\r\nspirit of absolute fairness and justice and of entire fearlessness,\r\nwith the firm purpose not to hurt any corporation doing a legitimate\r\nbusiness—on the contrary to help it—and, on the other hand, not to\r\nspare any corporation which may be guilty of illegal practices, or\r\nthe methods of which may make it a menace to the public welfare. Some\r\nsubstantial good will be done in the immediate future; and as the\r\nDepartment gets fairly to work under the law an ever larger vista for\r\ngood work will be opened along the lines indicated. The enactment\r\nof this law is one of the most significant contributions which have\r\nbeen made in our time toward the proper solution of the problem of\r\nthe relations to the people of the great corporations and corporate\r\ncombinations.\r\n\r\nBut much though this is, it is only a part of what has been done in\r\nthe effort to ascertain and correct improper trust or monopolistic\r\npractices. Some eighteen months ago the Industrial Commission, an\r\nable and non-partisan body, reported to Congress the result of\r\ntheir investigation of trusts and industrial combinations. One of\r\nthe most important of their conclusions was that discriminations in\r\nfreight rates and facilities were granted favored shippers by the\r\nrailroads and that these discriminations clearly tended toward the\r\ncontrol of production and prices in many fields of business by large\r\ncombinations. That this conclusion was justifiable was shown by the\r\ndisclosures in the investigation of railroad methods pursued in the\r\nfall and winter of 1901-1902. It was then shown that certain trunk\r\nlines had entered into unlawful agreements as to the transportation\r\nof food products from the West to the Atlantic seaboard, giving a few\r\nfavored shippers rates much below the tariff charges imposed upon the\r\nsmaller dealers and the general public. These unjust practices had\r\nprevailed to such an extent and for so long a time that many of the\r\nsmaller shippers had been driven out of business, until practically\r\none buyer of grain on each railway system had been able by his illegal\r\nadvantages to secure a monopoly on the line with which his secret\r\ncompact was made; this monopoly enabling him to fix the price to\r\nboth producer and consumer. Many of the great packing house concerns\r\nwere shown to be in combination with each other and with most of the\r\ngreat railway lines, whereby they enjoyed large secret concessions\r\nin rates and thus obtained a practical monopoly of the fresh and\r\ncured meat industry of the country. These fusions, though violative\r\nof the statute, had prevailed unchecked for so many years that they\r\nhad become intrenched in and interwoven with the commercial life of\r\ncertain large distributing localities; although this was of course at\r\nthe expense of the vast body of law-abiding merchants, the general\r\npublic, and particularly of unfavored localities.\r\n\r\nUnder those circumstances it was a serious problem to determine\r\nthe wise course to follow in vitalizing a law which had in part\r\nbecome obsolete or proved incapable of enforcement. Of what the\r\nAttorney-General did in enforcing it I shall speak later. The\r\ndecisions of the courts upon the law had betrayed weaknesses and\r\nimperfections, some of them so serious as to render abortive efforts\r\nto apply any effective remedy for the existing evils.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that corporations created for quasi public purposes,\r\nclothed for that reason with the ultimate power of the state to take\r\nprivate property against the will of the owner, hold their corporate\r\npowers as carriers in trust for the fairly impartial service of all\r\nthe public. Favoritism in the use of such powers, unjustly enriching\r\nsome and unjustly impoverishing others, discriminating in favor\r\nof some places and against others, is palpably violative of plain\r\nprinciples of justice. Such a practice unchecked is hurtful in\r\nmany ways. Congress, having had its attention drawn to the matter,\r\nenacted a most important anti-rebate law, which greatly strengthens\r\nthe interstate commerce law. This new law prohibits under adequate\r\npenalties the giving and as well the demanding or receiving of such\r\npreferences, and provides the preventive remedy of injunction. The\r\nvigorous administration of this law—and it will be enforced—will, it\r\nis hoped, afford a substantial remedy for certain trust evils which\r\nhave attracted public attention and have created public unrest.\r\n\r\nThis law represents a noteworthy and important advance toward just\r\nand effective regulation of transportation. Moreover, its passage\r\nhas been supplemented by the enactment of a law to expedite the\r\nhearing of actions of public moment under the anti-trust act, known\r\nas the Sherman law, and under the act to regulate commerce, at the\r\nrequest of the Attorney-General; and furthermore, additional funds\r\nhave been appropriated to be expended under the direction of the\r\nAttorney-General in the enforcement of these laws.\r\n\r\nAll of this represents a great and substantial advance in legislation.\r\nBut more important even than legislation is the administration of the\r\nlaw, and I ask your attention for a moment to the way in which the\r\nlaw has been administered by the profound jurist and fearless public\r\nservant who now occupies the position of Attorney-General, Mr. Knox.\r\nThe Constitution enjoins upon the President that he shall take care\r\nthat the laws be faithfully executed, and under this provision the\r\nAttorney-General formulated a policy which was in effect nothing but\r\nthe rigid enforcement, by suits managed with consummate skill and\r\nability, both of the anti-trust law and of the imperfect provisions of\r\nthe act to regulate commerce. The first step taken was the prosecution\r\nof fourteen suits against the principal railroads of the Middle West,\r\nrestraining them by injunction from further violations of either of\r\nthe laws in question.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the case against the Northern Securities Company\r\nwas initiated. This was a corporation organized under the laws of\r\nthe State of New Jersey with a capital of four hundred million\r\ndollars, the alleged purpose being to control the Great Northern\r\nand the Northern Pacific railroad companies, two parallel and\r\ncompeting lines extending across the northern tier of States from\r\nthe Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean. Whatever the purpose,\r\nits consummation would have resulted in the control of the two great\r\nrailway systems—upon which the people of the Northwestern States were\r\nso largely dependent for their supplies and to get their products\r\nto market—being practically merged into the New Jersey corporation.\r\nThe proposition that these independent systems of railroads should\r\nbe merged under a single control alarmed the people of the States\r\nconcerned, lest they be subjected to what they deemed a monopoly\r\nof interstate transportation and the suppression of competition.\r\nThe Governors of the States most deeply affected held a meeting\r\nto consider how to prevent the merger becoming effective and\r\npassed resolutions calling upon the National Government to enforce\r\nthe anti-trust laws against the alleged combination. When these\r\nresolutions were referred to the Attorney-General for consideration\r\nand advice, he reported that in his opinion the Northern Securities\r\nCompany and its control of the railroads mentioned was a combination\r\nin restraint of trade, and was attempting a monopoly in violation of\r\nthe national anti-trust law. Thereupon a suit in equity, which is now\r\npending, was begun by the Government to test the validity of this\r\ntransaction under the Sherman law.\r\n\r\nAt nearly the same time the disclosures respecting the secret\r\nrebates enjoyed by the great packing house companies, coupled with\r\nthe very high price of meats, led the Attorney-General to direct an\r\ninvestigation into the methods of the so-called beef trust. The\r\nresult was that he filed bills for injunction against six of the\r\nprincipal packing house companies, and restrained them from combining\r\nand agreeing upon prices at which they would sell their products in\r\nStates other than those in which their meats were prepared for market.\r\nWrits of injunction were issued accordingly, and since then, after\r\nfull argument, the United States Circuit Court has made the injunction\r\nperpetual.\r\n\r\nThe cotton interests of the South, including growers, buyers, and\r\nshippers, made complaint that they were suffering great injury in\r\ntheir business from the methods of the Southern railroads in the\r\nhandling and transportation of cotton. They alleged that these\r\nrailroads, by combined action under a pooling arrangement to support\r\ntheir rate schedules, had denied to the shippers the right to elect\r\nover what roads their commodities should be shipped, and that\r\nby dividing upon a fixed basis the cotton crop of the South all\r\ninducement to compete in rates for the transportation thereof was\r\neliminated. Proceedings were instituted by the Attorney-General under\r\nthe anti-trust law, which resulted in the destruction of the pool\r\nand in restoring to the growers and shippers of the South the right\r\nto ship their products over any road they elected, thus removing the\r\nrestraint upon the freedom of commerce.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1902, the Attorney-General directed that a bill for\r\nan injunction be filed in the United States Circuit Court at San\r\nFrancisco against the Federal Salt Company—a corporation which had\r\nbeen organized under the laws of an Eastern State, but had its main\r\noffice and principal place of business in California—and against a\r\nnumber of other companies and persons constituting what was known\r\nas the salt trust. These injunctions were to restrain the execution\r\nof certain contracts between the Federal Salt Company and the other\r\ndefendants, by which the latter agreed neither to import nor buy or\r\nsell salt, except from and to the Federal Salt Company, and not to\r\nengage or assist in the production of salt west of the Mississippi\r\nRiver during the continuance of such contracts. As the result of these\r\nagreements the price of salt had been advanced about four hundred per\r\ncent. A temporary injunction order was obtained, which the defendants\r\nasked the court to modify on the ground that the anti-trust law had no\r\napplication to contracts for purchases and sales within a State. The\r\nCircuit Court overruled this contention and sustained the Government’s\r\nposition. This practically concluded the case, and it is understood\r\nthat in consequence the Federal Salt Company is about to be dissolved\r\nand that no further contest will be made.\r\n\r\nThe above is a brief outline of the most important steps, legislative\r\nand administrative, taken during the past eighteen months in the\r\ndirection of solving, so far as at present it seems practicable by\r\nnational legislation or administration to solve, what we call the\r\ntrust problem. They represent a sum of very substantial achievement.\r\nThey represent a successful effort to devise and apply real remedies;\r\nan effort which so far succeeded because it was made not only\r\nwith resolute purpose and determination, but also in a spirit of\r\ncommon-sense and justice, as far removed as possible from rancor,\r\nhysteria, and unworthy demagogic appeal. In the same spirit the laws\r\nwill continue to be enforced. Not only is the legislation recently\r\nenacted effective, but in my judgment it was impracticable to attempt\r\nmore. Nothing of value is to be expected from ceaseless agitation\r\nfor radical and extreme legislation. The people may wisely, and with\r\nconfidence, await the results which are reasonably to be expected from\r\nthe impartial enforcement of the laws which have recently been placed\r\nupon the statute books. Legislation of a general and indiscriminate\r\ncharacter would be sure to fail, either because it would involve all\r\ninterests in a common ruin, or because it would not really reach any\r\nevil. We have endeavored to provide a discriminating adaptation of the\r\nremedy to the real mischief.\r\n\r\nMany of the alleged remedies advocated are of the unpleasantly drastic\r\ntype which seeks to destroy the disease by killing the patient. Others\r\nare so obviously futile that it is somewhat difficult to treat them\r\nseriously or as being advanced in good faith. High among the latter I\r\nplace the effort to reach the trust question by means of the tariff.\r\nYou can, of course, put an end to the prosperity of the trusts by\r\nputting an end to the prosperity of the Nation; but the price for\r\nsuch action seems high. The alternative is to do exactly what has been\r\ndone during the life of the Congress which has just closed—that is,\r\nto endeavor, not to destroy corporations, but to regulate them with\r\na view of doing away with whatever is of evil in them and of making\r\nthem subserve the public use. The law is not to be administered in\r\nthe interest of the poor man as such, nor yet in the interest of the\r\nrich man as such, but in the interest of the law-abiding man, rich or\r\npoor. We are no more against organizations of capital than against\r\norganizations of labor. We welcome both, demanding only that each\r\nshall do right and shall remember its duty to the Republic. Such a\r\ncourse we consider not merely a benefit to the poor man, but a benefit\r\nto the rich man. We do no man an injustice when we require him to obey\r\nthe law. On the contrary, if he is a man whose safety and well-being\r\ndepend in a peculiar degree upon the existence of the spirit of law\r\nand order, we are rendering him the greatest service when we require\r\nhim to be himself an exemplar of that spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE THE MINNESOTA LEGISLATURE, ST. PAUL, MINN., APRIL 4, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Governor, Mr. Lieutenant-Governor, Mr. Speaker, Members of the\r\n  Legislative Body, Men and Women of Minnesota_:\r\n\r\nI thank you for greeting me and for giving me the chance to say a word\r\nor two in welcome and in acknowledgment of your greeting.\r\n\r\nTo any American capable of any depth of reflection whatever, it\r\nshould always be a somewhat solemn thing to come into the presence\r\nof two bodies—one a legislative body; the other an educational\r\nbody; the legislative body, which is not only the method but the\r\nsymbol of our free government; the educational body, which, using\r\neducational in its broadest and truest sense, means the body that\r\nfits us for self-government. Self-government is not an easy thing.\r\nThe nations of antiquity, the nations of the middle ages, that tried\r\nthe experiment of independent self-government which should guarantee\r\nfreedom to the individual, and yet safety from without and within to\r\nthe body politic itself, rarely lasted long, never rose to a pitch of\r\ngreatness such as ours without having suffered some radical and, as it\r\nproved ultimately, fatal change of structure. Until our Republic was\r\nfounded it had proved impossible in the long run to combine freedom\r\nfor the individual and greatness for the nation. The republics of\r\nantiquity and of the middle ages went one of two lines; either proved\r\nfatal. Either the individual’s interests were sacrificed, and, while\r\nretaining the forms of freedom, the republic became in effect a\r\ndespotism, or else the freedom of the individual was kept at the cost\r\nof utter impotence either to put down disorder at home or to repel\r\naggression from abroad.\r\n\r\nIt has been given to us during the century and a quarter of our\r\nnational life so to handle ourselves as a people that we have escaped\r\nboth dangers. We have been able to escape the leadership of those who\r\nfeared Scylla so much that they would plunge us into Charybdis, and\r\nof those who feared Charybdis so much that they would plunge us into\r\nScylla. We have been able to preserve orderly liberty and strength\r\nto grow in greatness among the nations of the earth, while becoming\r\nsteadily more and more democratic in the truest and broadest sense\r\nof the word. I believe with all my heart that we shall continue on\r\nthe path thus marked out for us; but we shall so continue only if we\r\nremember that in the last analysis the safety of the Republic depends\r\nupon the high average of individual citizenship.\r\n\r\nWe can keep all the forms of free government; and every Fourth of\r\nJuly we can talk possibly a little too boastfully of both the past\r\nand the present; and yet it shall not avail us if we do not have\r\nin our hearts the spirit that makes for decent citizenship, the\r\nspirit that alone counts in the formation of a true republic. And\r\nthat spirit is essentially the same in public life as in private\r\nlife. The manifestations of it differ, but the spirit is the same.\r\nA public man is as much bound to tell the truth on the stump as off\r\nthe stump. On the other hand, his critics will do well to remember\r\nthat truth-telling is a virtue for them to practice also. What we\r\nneed in public life and in private life is not genius so much as the\r\nmany-sided development of the qualities which in their sum make good\r\ncitizenship. In a great crisis we shall need a genius; thrice and\r\nthrice over fortunate is the nation which then develops a Lincoln to\r\nlead it in peace; a Grant to lead it in war; a Washington to lead it\r\nin war and peace.\r\n\r\nBut what we need as a nation, as an individual, at the ordinary times\r\nwhich are so much larger in the aggregate than the extraordinary\r\ntimes, and upon our conduct in which really depends our conduct\r\nin extraordinary times, are the commonplace virtues which we all\r\nrecognize, and which when we were young we wrote about in copybooks,\r\nand which, if we practice, will count for a thousand times more in the\r\nlong run than any brilliance and genius of any kind or sort whatsoever.\r\n\r\nI want to say just a word on the other side of the two great\r\nquestions, the legislative and educational questions. Education must\r\nbe twofold. Of course if we do not have education in the school,\r\nthe academy, the college, the university, and have it developed in\r\nthe highest and wisest manner, we shall make but a poor fist of\r\nAmerican citizenship. One of the things that is most hopeful in our\r\nRepublic is the way in which the State has taken charge of elementary\r\neducation; and the way in which, in the East through private gift,\r\nhere in the West through the wise liberality of the several States,\r\nthe higher education has been taken care of, as in your own University\r\nof Minnesota. But such education can never be all. It can never be\r\nmore than half, and sometimes not that. Nothing can take the place\r\nof the education of the home; and that education must be largely the\r\nunconscious influence of character upon character. There is no use\r\nin the father trying to instil wise saws and precepts into the son,\r\nif his own character gives the lie to his advice. And unfortunately\r\nit is just as true in the education of children as in everything\r\nelse, that it is almost as harmful to be a virtuous fool as a knave.\r\nSo often throughout our social structure from the wealthiest down\r\nto the poorest you see the queer fatuity of the man or the woman\r\nwhich makes them save their children temporary discomfort, temporary\r\nunpleasantness, at the cost of future destruction; you see a great\r\nmany men, and I am sorry to say a great many women, who say, “I have\r\nhad to work hard; my boy or my girl shall not do anything.” I have\r\nseen it in every rank. I have heard the millionaire say, “I have had\r\nto work all my life to make money, let my boy spend it.” It would be\r\nbetter for the boy never to have been born than to be brought up on\r\nthat principle. On the other hand, I have seen the overworked drudge,\r\nthe laborer’s wife, who said, “Well, I have had to work my heart out\r\nall my days; my daughters shall be ladies”; and her conception of\r\nher daughters being ladies was to have them sit around useless and\r\nincompetent, unable to do anything, brought up to be discontented\r\ncumberers of the earth’s surface. As Abraham Lincoln said: “There is\r\na deal of human nature in mankind.” Fundamentally, virtues and faults\r\nare just the same in the millionaire and the day laborer. The man or\r\nthe woman who seeks to bring up his or her children with the idea that\r\ntheir happiness is secured by teaching them to avoid difficulties is\r\ndoing them a cruel wrong. To bring up the boy and girl so sheltered\r\nthat they can not stand any rough knocks, that they shrink from toil,\r\nthat when they meet an obstacle they feel they ought to go around or\r\nback instead of going on over it—the man or the woman who does that is\r\nwronging the children to a degree that no other human being can wrong\r\nthem. If you are worth your salt and want your children to be worth\r\ntheir salt, teach them that the life that is not a life of work and\r\neffort is worthless, a curse to the man or woman leading it, a curse\r\nto those around him or her. Teach the boys that if they are ever to\r\ncount in the world they will count not by flinching from difficulties,\r\nbut by warring with and overcoming them. What utter scorn one feels\r\nfor those who seek only the life of ease; the life passed in dexterous\r\neffort to avoid all angular corners, to avoid being put in the places\r\nwhere a strong man by blood and sweat and toil and risk wins triumph!\r\nWhat a wretched life is the life of the man passed in endeavoring to\r\nshirk his share of the burden laid upon him in this world! And it\r\nmakes no difference whether that man is a man of inherited wealth or\r\none who has to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow; it is equally\r\nignoble in either case. What is true of the individual is true of the\r\nnation. The man who counts is not the man who dodges work, but he who\r\ngoes out into life rejoicing as a strong man to run a race, girding\r\nhimself for the effort, bound to win and wrest triumph from difficulty\r\nand disaster.\r\n\r\nSo it is with our Nation. No nation which has bound itself only\r\nto do easy things ever yet amounted to anything, ever yet came to\r\nanything throughout the ages. We have become a great people. At the\r\nthreshold of this twentieth century we stand with the future looming\r\nlarge before us. We face great problems within and great problems\r\nwithout. We can not if we would refuse to face those problems. All we\r\ncan decide is whether we will do them well or ill; for the refusal to\r\nface them would itself mean that we were doing them ill. We are in\r\nthe arena into which great nations must come. We must play our part.\r\nIt rests with us to decide that we shall not play it ignobly; that we\r\nshall not flinch from the great problems that there are to do, but\r\nthat we shall take our place in the forefront of the great nations and\r\nface each problem of the day with confident and resolute hope.\r\n\r\nIN THE CHAPEL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA, MINNEAPOLIS, MINN.,\r\nAPRIL 4, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President; Ladies and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nI am glad to have the chance of greeting you this evening, but I\r\nregret that the engagements for me have been so numerous that it will\r\nbe only a greeting. I wish I could be here to see your beautiful\r\ngrounds and buildings by daylight, and to see a little of the life of\r\nthe university.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of tendencies for good, and, I am sorry to say,\r\nplenty of tendencies for evil in our modern life, and high among the\r\nformer must be placed the rapid growth of the great institutions of\r\nlearning in this country. There is a twofold side to the work done in\r\nany institution of this kind. In the first place the institution is\r\nto turn out scholars and men proficient in the different technical\r\nbranches for which it trains them. It should be the aim of every\r\nuniversity which seeks to develop the liberal side of education\r\nto turn out men and women who will add to the sum of productive\r\nachievement in scholarship; who will not merely be content to work in\r\nthe fields that have already been harrowed a thousand times by other\r\nworkers, but who will strike out for themselves and try to do new work\r\nthat counts; so in each technical school if the institution is worthy\r\nof standing in the front rank, it will turn out those who in that\r\nparticular specialty stand at the head. But in addition to this merely\r\ntechnical work, to the turning out of the scholar, the professional\r\nman, the man or woman trained on some special line, each university\r\nworthy the name must endeavor to turn out men and women in the fullest\r\nsense of the word, good citizens, men and women who will add by what\r\nthey do to the sum of noble work in the whole community.\r\n\r\nIt is a good thing that so much attention should be given to physical\r\ndevelopment. I believe in rough games and in rough, manly sports. I\r\ndo not feel any particular sympathy for the person who gets battered\r\nabout a good deal so long as it is not fatal, and if he feels any\r\nsympathy for himself I do not like him. I believe thoroughly in the\r\nsound and vigorous body. I believe still more in the vigorous mind.\r\nAnd I believe most of all in what count for more than body, for more\r\nthan mind, and that is character. That is the sum of the forces\r\nthat make the man or the woman worth knowing, worth revering, worth\r\nholding to. Play hard while you play, but do not mistake it for work.\r\nIf a young fellow is twenty it is a good thing that he should be a\r\ncrack half-back; but when he is forty I am sorry if he has never been\r\nanything else except once at twenty a good half-back. Keep the sense\r\nof proportion. Play hard; it will do you good in your work. But work\r\nhard and remember that this is the main thing.\r\n\r\nFinally, in closing, I think it is a safe thing to take a motto that\r\nI heard from the lips of an old football player once: “Don’t flinch,\r\ndon’t foul, and hit the line hard.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAT MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., APRIL 4, 1903\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nAt the special session of the Senate held in March the Cuban\r\nreciprocity treaty was ratified. When this treaty goes into effect,\r\nit will confer substantial economic benefits alike upon Cuba, because\r\nof the widening of her market in the United States, and upon the\r\nUnited States, because of the equal widening and the progressive\r\ncontrol it will give to our people in the Cuban market. This treaty is\r\nbeneficial to both parties and justifies itself on several grounds.\r\nIn the first place we offer to Cuba her natural market. We can confer\r\nupon her a benefit which no other nation can confer; and for the very\r\nreason that we have started her as an independent republic and that\r\nwe are rich, prosperous, and powerful, it behooves us to stretch out\r\na helping hand to our feebler younger sister. In the next place, it\r\nwidens the market for our products, both the products of the farm and\r\ncertain of our manufactures; and it is therefore in the interests of\r\nour farmers, manufacturers, merchants, and wage-workers. Finally,\r\nthe treaty was not merely warranted but demanded, apart from all\r\nother considerations, by the enlightened consideration of our foreign\r\npolicy. More and more in the future we must occupy a preponderant\r\nposition in the waters and along the coasts in the region south of\r\nus; not a position of control over the republics of the south, but\r\nof control of the military situation so as to avoid any possible\r\ncomplications in the future. Under the Platt amendment Cuba agreed\r\nto give us certain naval stations on her coast. The Navy Department\r\ndecided that we needed but two, and we have specified where these two\r\nare to be. President Palma has concluded an agreement giving them to\r\nus—an agreement which the Cuban legislative body will doubtless soon\r\nratify. In other words, the Republic of Cuba has assumed a special\r\nrelation to our international political system, under which she gives\r\nus outposts of defence, and we are morally bound to extend to her in a\r\ndegree the benefit of our own economic system. From every standpoint\r\nof wise and enlightened home and foreign policy the ratification of\r\nthe Cuban treaty marked a step of substantial progress in the growth\r\nof our nation toward greatness at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nEqually important was the action on the tariff upon products of the\r\nPhilippines. We gave them a reduction of twenty-five per cent, and\r\nwould have given them a reduction of twenty-five per cent more had it\r\nnot been for the opposition, in the hurried closing days of the last\r\nsession, of certain gentlemen who, by the way, have been representing\r\nthemselves both as peculiarly solicitous for the interests of the\r\nPhilippine people and as special champions of the lowering of tariff\r\nduties. There is a distinctly humorous side to the fact that the\r\nreduction of duties which would benefit Cuba and the Philippines as\r\nwell as ourselves was antagonized chiefly by those who in theory\r\nhave been fond of proclaiming themselves the advanced guardians of\r\nthe oppressed nationalities in the islands affected and the ardent\r\nadvocates of the reduction of duties generally, but who instantly\r\ntook violent ground against the practical steps to accomplish either\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a law was enacted putting anthracite on the free list and\r\ncompletely removing the duties on all other kinds of coal for one year.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a condition of prosperity unparalleled not merely in our\r\nown history but in the history of any other nation. This prosperity is\r\ndeep rooted and stands on a firm basis because it is due to the fact\r\nthat the average American has in him the stuff out of which victors\r\nare made in the great industrial contests of the present day, just\r\nas in the great military contests of the past; and because he is now\r\nable to use and develop his qualities to best advantage under our\r\nwell-established economic system. We are winning headship among the\r\nnations of the world because our people are able to keep their high\r\naverage of individual citizenship and to show their mastery in the\r\nhard, complex, pushing life of the age. There will be fluctuations\r\nfrom time to time in our prosperity, but it will continue to grow just\r\nso long as we keep up this high average of individual citizenship\r\nand permit it to work out its own salvation under proper economic\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThe present phenomenal prosperity has been won under a tariff which\r\nwas made in accordance with certain fixed and definite principles,\r\nthe most important of which is an avowed determination to protect the\r\ninterests of the American producer, business man, wage-worker, and\r\nfarmer alike. The general tariff policy, to which, without regard to\r\nchanges in detail, I believe this country is irrevocably committed,\r\nis fundamentally based upon ample recognition of the difference\r\nbetween the cost of production—that is, the cost of labor—here and\r\nabroad, and of the need to see to it that our laws shall in no\r\nevent afford advantage in our own market to foreign industries over\r\nAmerican industries, to foreign capital over American capital, to\r\nforeign labor over our own labor. This country has and this country\r\nneeds better-paid, better-educated, better-fed, and better-clothed\r\nworkingmen, of a higher type, than are to be found in any foreign\r\ncountry. It has and it needs a higher, more vigorous, and more\r\nprosperous type of tillers of the soil than is possessed by any other\r\ncountry. The business men, the merchants and manufacturers, and the\r\nmanagers of the transportation interests show the same superiority\r\nwhen compared with men of their type abroad. The events of the last\r\nfew years have shown how skilfully the leaders of American industry\r\nuse in international business competition the mighty industrial\r\nweapons forged for them by the resources of our country, the wisdom of\r\nour laws, and the skill, the inventive genius, and the administrative\r\ncapacity of our people.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, a mere truism to say that we want to use everything\r\nin our power to foster the welfare of our entire body politic. In\r\nother words, we need to treat the tariff as a business proposition,\r\nfrom the standpoint of the interests of the country as a whole, and\r\nnot with reference to the temporary needs of any political party. It\r\nis almost as necessary that our policy should be stable as that it\r\nshould be wise. A nation like ours could not long stand the ruinous\r\npolicy of readjusting its business to radical changes in the tariff\r\nat short intervals, especially when, as now, owing to the immense\r\nextent and variety of our products, the tariff schedules carry rates\r\nof duty on thousands of different articles. Sweeping and violent\r\nchanges in such a tariff, touching so vitally the interests of all of\r\nus, embracing agriculture, labor, manufactures, and commerce, would\r\nbe disastrous in any event, and they would be fatal to our present\r\nwell-being if approached on the theory that the principle of the\r\nprotective tariff was to be abandoned. The business world, that is,\r\nthe entire American world, can not afford, if it has any regard for\r\nits own welfare, even to consider the advisability of abandoning the\r\npresent system.\r\n\r\nYet, on the other hand, where the industrial conditions so frequently\r\nchange, as with us must of necessity be the case, it is a matter of\r\nprime importance that we should be able from time to time to adapt\r\nour economic policy to the changed conditions. Our aim should be to\r\npreserve the policy of a protective tariff, in which the Nation as\r\na whole has acquiesced, and yet wherever and whenever necessary to\r\nchange the duties in particular paragraphs or schedules as matters of\r\nlegislative detail, if such change is demanded by the interests of the\r\nNation as a whole.\r\n\r\nIn making any readjustment there are certain important considerations\r\nwhich can not be disregarded. If a tariff law has on the whole worked\r\nwell, and if business has prospered under it and is prospering, it\r\nmay be better to endure some inconveniences and inequalities for a\r\ntime than by making changes to risk causing disturbance and perhaps\r\nparalysis in the industries and business of the country. The fact\r\nthat the change in a given rate of duty may be thought desirable does\r\nnot settle the question whether it is advisable to make the change\r\nimmediately. Every tariff deals with duties on thousands of articles\r\narranged in hundreds of paragraphs and in many schedules. These duties\r\naffect a vast number of interests which are often conflicting. If\r\nnecessary for our welfare, then of course Congress must consider the\r\nquestion of changing the law as a whole or changing any given rates\r\nof duty, but we must remember that whenever even a single schedule\r\nis considered some interests will appear to demand a change in\r\nalmost every schedule in the law; and when it comes to upsetting the\r\nschedules generally the effect upon the business interests of the\r\ncountry would be ruinous.\r\n\r\nOne point we must steadily keep in mind. The question of tariff\r\nrevision, speaking broadly, stands wholly apart from the question\r\nof dealing with the trusts. No change in tariff duties can have any\r\nsubstantial effect in solving the so-called trust problem. Certain\r\ngreat trusts or great corporations are wholly unaffected by the\r\ntariff. Practically all the others that are of any importance have\r\nas a matter of fact numbers of smaller American competitors; and of\r\ncourse a change in the tariff which would work injury to the large\r\ncorporation would work not merely injury but destruction to its\r\nsmaller competitors; and equally of course such a change would mean\r\ndisaster to all the wage-workers connected with either the large or\r\nthe small corporations. From the standpoint of those interested in the\r\nsolution of the trust problem such a change would therefore merely\r\nmean that the trust was relieved of the competition of its weaker\r\nAmerican competitors, and thrown only into competition with foreign\r\ncompetitors; and that the first effort to meet this new competition\r\nwould be made by cutting down wages, and would therefore be primarily\r\nat the cost of labor. In the case of some of our greatest trusts such\r\na change might confer upon them a positive benefit. Speaking broadly,\r\nit is evident that the changes in the tariff will affect the trusts\r\nfor weal or for woe simply as they affect the whole country. The\r\ntariff affects trusts only as it affects all other interests. It makes\r\nall these interests, large or small, profitable; and its benefits can\r\nbe taken from the large only under penalty of taking them from the\r\nsmall also.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, we must as a people approach a matter of such prime\r\neconomic importance as the tariff from the standpoint of our business\r\nneeds. We can not afford to become fossilized or to fail to recognize\r\nthe fact that as the needs of the country change it may be necessary\r\nto meet these new needs by changing certain features of our tariff\r\nlaws. Still less can we afford to fail to recognize the further fact\r\nthat these changes must not be made until the need for them outweighs\r\nthe disadvantages which may result; and when it becomes necessary\r\nto make them they should be made with full recognition of the need\r\nof stability in our economic system and of keeping unchanged the\r\nprinciple of that system which has now become a settled policy in our\r\nnational life. We have prospered marvelously at home. As a nation we\r\nstand in the very forefront in the giant international industrial\r\ncompetition of the day. We can not afford by any freak or folly to\r\nforfeit the position to which we have thus triumphantly attained.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT SIOUX FALLS, S. D., APRIL 6, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nThere are many, many lesser problems which go to make up in their\r\nentirety the huge and complex problems of our modern industrial life.\r\nEach of these problems is, moreover, connected with many of the\r\nothers. Few indeed are simple or stand only by themselves. The most\r\nimportant are those connected with the relation of the farmers, the\r\nstock growers and soil tillers, to the community at large, and those\r\naffecting the relations between employer and employed. In a country\r\nlike ours it is fundamentally true that the well-being of the tiller\r\nof the soil and the wage-worker is the well-being of the State. If\r\nthey are well off, then we need concern ourselves but little as to how\r\nother classes stand, for they will inevitably be well off too; and, on\r\nthe other hand, there can be no real general prosperity unless based\r\non the foundation of the prosperity of the wage-worker and the tiller\r\nof the soil.\r\n\r\nBut the needs of these two classes are often not the same. The tiller\r\nof the soil has been of all our citizens the one on the whole the\r\nleast affected in his ways of life and methods of industry by the\r\ngiant industrial changes of the last half century. There has been\r\nchange with him, too, of course. He also can work to best advantage\r\nif he keeps in close touch with his fellows; and the success of the\r\nnational Department of Agriculture has shown how much can be done for\r\nhim by rational action of the Government. Nor is it only through the\r\nDepartment that the Government can act. One of the greatest and most\r\nbeneficent measures passed by the last Congress, or indeed by any\r\nCongress in recent years, is the Irrigation Act, which will do for the\r\nStates of the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountain region at least as\r\nmuch as ever has been done for the States of the humid region by river\r\nand harbor improvements. Few measures that have been put upon the\r\nstatute books of the Nation have done more for the people than this\r\nlaw will, I firmly believe, directly and indirectly accomplish for the\r\nStates in question.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture devotes its whole energy to working\r\nfor the welfare of farmers and stock growers. In every section of\r\nour country it aids them in their constantly increasing search for\r\na better agricultural education. It helps not only them, but all\r\nthe nation, in seeing that our exports of meats have clean bills\r\nof health, and that there is rigid inspection of all meats that\r\nenter into interstate commerce. Thirty-eight million carcasses\r\nwere inspected during the last fiscal year. Our stock growers sell\r\nforty-five million dollars’ worth of live stock annually, and these\r\nanimals must be kept healthy or else our people will lose their trade.\r\nOur export of plant products to foreign countries amounts to over six\r\nhundred million dollars a year, and there is no branch of its work\r\nto which the Department of Agriculture devotes more care. Thus the\r\nDepartment has been successfully introducing a macaroni wheat from\r\nthe headwaters of the Volga, which grows successfully in ten inches\r\nof rainfall, and by this means wheat growing has been successfully\r\nextended westward into the semi-arid region. Two million bushels of\r\nthis wheat were grown last year; and being suited to dry conditions it\r\ncan be used for forage as well as for food for man.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture has been helping our fruit men to\r\nestablish markets abroad by studying methods of fruit preservation\r\nthrough refrigeration and through methods of handling and packing.\r\nOn the Gulf coasts of Louisiana and Texas, thanks to the Department\r\nof Agriculture, a rice suitable to the region was imported from the\r\nOrient and the rice crop is now practically equal to our needs in this\r\ncountry, whereas a few years ago it supplied but one-fourth of them.\r\nThe most important of our farm products is the grass crop; and to show\r\nwhat has been done with grasses, I need only allude to the striking\r\nchange made in the entire West by the extended use of alfalfa.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Department has taken the lead in the effort to prevent\r\nthe deforestation of the country. Where there are forests we seek to\r\npreserve them; and on the once treeless plains and the prairies we are\r\ndoing our best to foster the habit of tree planting among our people.\r\nIn my own lifetime I have seen wonderful changes brought about by this\r\ntree planting here in your own State and in the States immediately\r\naround it.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of very important questions, such as that of good\r\nroads, with which the States alone can deal, and where all that the\r\nNational Government can do is to co-operate with them. The same is\r\ntrue of the education of the American farmer. A number of the States\r\nhave themselves started to help in this work and the Department of\r\nAgriculture does an immense amount which is in the proper sense of the\r\nword educational, and educational in the most practical way.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore clearly true that a great advance has been made in the\r\ndirection of finding ways by which the Government can help the farmer\r\nto help himself—the only kind of help which a self-respecting man will\r\naccept, or, I may add, which will in the end do him any good. Much has\r\nbeen done in these ways, and farm life and farm processes continually\r\nchange for the better. The farmer himself still retains, because of\r\nhis surroundings and the nature of his work, to a pre-eminent degree\r\nthe qualities which we like to think of as distinctly American in\r\nconsidering our early history. The man who tills his own farm, whether\r\non the prairie or in the woodland, the man who grows what we eat and\r\nthe raw material which is worked up into what we wear, still exists\r\nmore nearly under the conditions which obtained when the “embattled\r\nfarmers” of ’76 made this country a nation than is true of any others\r\nof our people.\r\n\r\nBut the wage-workers in our cities, like the capitalists in our\r\ncities, face totally changed conditions. The development of machinery\r\nand the extraordinary change in business conditions have rendered the\r\nemployment of capital and of persons in large aggregations not merely\r\nprofitable but often necessary for success, and have specialized the\r\nlabor of the wage-worker at the same time that they have brought\r\ngreat aggregations of wage-workers together. More and more in our\r\ngreat industrial centres men have come to realize that they can not\r\nlive as independently of one another as in the old days was the case\r\neverywhere, and as is now the case in the country districts.\r\n\r\nOf course, fundamentally each man will yet find that the chief factor\r\nin determining his success or failure in life is the sum of his\r\nown individual qualities. He can not afford to lose his individual\r\ninitiative, his individual will and power; but he can best use that\r\npower if for certain objects he unites with his fellows. Much can be\r\ndone by organization, combination, union among the wage-workers;\r\nfinally something can be done by the direct action of the State. It is\r\nnot possible empirically to declare when the interference of the State\r\nshould be deemed legitimate and when illegitimate.\r\n\r\nThe line of demarcation between unhealthy over-interference and\r\nunhealthy lack of regulation is not always well defined, and shifts\r\nwith the change in our industrial needs. Most certainly we should\r\nnever invoke the interference of the State or Nation unless it is\r\nabsolutely necessary; but it is equally true that when confident\r\nof its necessity we should not on academic grounds refuse it. Wise\r\nfactory laws, laws to forbid the employment of child labor and to\r\nsafeguard the employees against the effects of culpable negligence\r\nby the employer, are necessary, not merely in the interest of the\r\nwage-worker, but in the interest of the honest and humane employer,\r\nwho should not be penalized for his honesty and humanity by being\r\nexposed to unchecked competition with an unscrupulous rival. It is far\r\nmore difficult to deal with the greed that works through cunning than\r\nwith the greed that works through violence. But the effort to deal\r\nwith it must be steadily made.\r\n\r\nVery much of our effort in reference to labor matters should be by\r\nevery device and expedient to try to secure a constantly better\r\nunderstanding between employer and employee. Everything possible\r\nshould be done to increase the sympathy and fellow-feeling between\r\nthem, and every chance taken to allow each to look at all questions,\r\nespecially at questions in dispute, somewhat through the other’s\r\neyes. If met with a sincere desire to act fairly by one another, and\r\nif there is, furthermore, power by each to appreciate the other’s\r\nstandpoint, the chance for trouble is minimized. I suppose every\r\nthinking man rejoices when by mediation or arbitration it proves\r\npossible to settle troubles in time to avert the suffering and\r\nbitterness caused by strikes. Moreover, a conciliation committee can\r\ndo best work when the trouble is in its beginning, or at least has\r\nnot come to a head. When the break has actually occurred, damage has\r\nbeen done, and each side feels sore and angry; and it is difficult\r\nto get them together—difficult to make either forget its own wrongs\r\nand remember the rights of the other. If possible the effort at\r\nconciliation or mediation or arbitration should be made in the earlier\r\nstages, and should be marked by the wish on the part of both sides\r\nto try to come to a common agreement which each shall think in the\r\ninterests of the other as well as of itself.\r\n\r\nWhen we deal with such a subject we are fortunate in having before\r\nus an admirable object-lesson in the work that has just been closed\r\nby the Anthracite Coal Strike Commission. This was the Commission\r\nwhich was appointed last fall at the time when the coal strike in\r\nthe anthracite regions threatened our Nation with a disaster second\r\nto none which has befallen us since the days of the Civil War. Their\r\nreport was made just before the Senate adjourned at the special\r\nsession; and no Government document of recent years marks a more\r\nimportant piece of work better done, and there is none which teaches\r\nsounder social morality to our people. The commission consisted of\r\nseven as good men as were to be found in the country, representing the\r\nbench, the church, the army, the professions, the employers, and the\r\nemployed. They acted as a unit, and the report which they unanimously\r\nsigned is a masterpiece of sound common-sense and of sound doctrine on\r\nthe very questions with which our people should most deeply concern\r\nthemselves. The immediate effect of this commission’s appointment and\r\naction was of vast and incalculable benefit to the Nation; but the\r\nultimate effect will be even better, if capitalist, wage-worker, and\r\nlaw-maker alike will take to heart and act upon the lessons set forth\r\nin the report they have made.\r\n\r\nOf course the National Government has but a small field in which it\r\ncan work in labor matters. Something it can do, however, and that\r\nsomething ought to be done. Among other things I should like to see\r\nthe District of Columbia, which is completely under the control of the\r\nNational Government, receive a set of model labor laws. Washington\r\nis not a city of very large industries, but still it has some. Wise\r\nlabor legislation for the city of Washington would be a good thing in\r\nitself, and it would be a far better thing, because a standard would\r\nthereby be set for the country as a whole.\r\n\r\nIn the field of general legislation relating to these subjects the\r\naction of Congress is necessarily very limited. Still there are\r\ncertain ways in which we can act. Thus the Secretary of the Navy has\r\nrecommended, with my cordial and hearty approval, the enactment of\r\na strong employers’-liability law in the navy yards of the Nation.\r\nIt should be extended to similar branches of the Government work.\r\nAgain, sometimes such laws can be enacted as an incident to the\r\nNation’s control over interstate commerce. In my last annual Message\r\nto Congress I advocated the passage of a law in reference to car\r\ncouplings—to strengthen the features of the one already on the statute\r\nbooks so as to minimize the exposure to death and maiming of railway\r\nemployees. Much opposition had to be overcome. In the end an admirable\r\nlaw was passed “to promote the safety of employees and travelers upon\r\nrailroads by compelling common carriers engaged in interstate commerce\r\nto equip their cars with automatic couplers and continuous brakes and\r\ntheir locomotives with driving-wheel brakes.” This law received my\r\nsignature a couple of days before Congress adjourned. It represents a\r\nreal and substantial advance in an admirable kind of legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA, APRIL 7, 1903\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nThe Northwest, whose sons in the Civil War added such brilliant pages\r\nto the honor roll of the Republic, likewise bore a full share in the\r\nstruggle of which the war with Spain was the beginning; a struggle\r\nslight indeed when compared with the gigantic death wrestle which\r\nfor four years stamped to and fro across the Southern States in the\r\nCivil War; but a struggle fraught with consequences to the Nation, and\r\nindeed to the world, out of all proportion to the smallness of the\r\neffort upon our part.\r\n\r\nThree and a half years ago President McKinley spoke in the adjoining\r\nState of Minnesota on the occasion of the return of the Thirteenth\r\nMinnesota Volunteers from the Philippine Islands, where they had\r\nserved with your own gallant sons of the North Dakota regiment.\r\nAfter heartily thanking the returned soldiers for their valor and\r\npatriotism, and their contemptuous refusal to be daunted or misled by\r\nthe outcry raised at home by the men of little faith who wished us to\r\nabandon the islands, he spoke of the islands themselves as follows:\r\n\r\n“That Congress will provide for them a government which will bring\r\nthem blessings, which will promote their material interests as well\r\nas advance their people in the path of civilization and intelligence,\r\nI confidently believe. They will not be governed as vassals or serfs\r\nor slaves. They will be given a government of liberty, regulated by\r\nlaw, honestly administered, without oppressing exactions, taxation\r\nwithout tyranny, justice without bribe, education without distinction\r\nof social condition, freedom of religious worship, and protection in\r\n‘life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.’”\r\n\r\nWhat he said then lay in the realm of promise. Now it lies in the\r\nrealm of positive performance.\r\n\r\nIt is a good thing to look back upon what has been said and compare\r\nit with the record of what has actually been done. If promises are\r\nviolated, if plighted word is not kept, then those who have failed in\r\ntheir duty should be held up to reprobation. If, on the other hand,\r\nthe promises have been substantially made good; if the achievement has\r\nkept pace and more than kept pace with the prophecy, then they who\r\nmade the one and are responsible for the other are entitled of just\r\nright to claim the credit which attaches to those who serve the Nation\r\nwell. This credit I claim for the men who have managed so admirably\r\nthe military and the civil affairs of the Philippine Islands, and\r\nfor those other men who have so heartily backed them in Congress,\r\nand without whose aid and support not one thing could have been\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nWhen President McKinley spoke, the first duty was the restoration of\r\norder; and to this end the use of the Army of the United States—an\r\nArmy composed of regulars and volunteers alike—was necessary. To put\r\ndown the insurrection and restore peace to the islands was a duty\r\nnot only to ourselves but to the islanders also. We could not have\r\nabandoned the conflict without shirking this duty, without proving\r\nourselves recreants to the memory of our forefathers. Moreover, if\r\nwe had abandoned it we would have inflicted upon the Filipinos the\r\nmost cruel wrong and would have doomed them to a bloody jumble of\r\nanarchy and tyranny. It seems strange, looking back, that any of our\r\npeople should have failed to recognize a duty so obvious; but there\r\nwas such failure, and the Government at home, the civil authorities\r\nin the Philippines, and above all our gallant Army, had to do their\r\nwork amid a storm of detraction. The Army in especial was attacked in\r\na way which finally did good, for in the end it aroused the hearty\r\nresentment of the great body of the American people, not against the\r\nArmy, but against the Army’s traducers. The circumstances of the war\r\nmade it one of peculiar difficulty, and our soldiers were exposed\r\nto peculiar wrongs from their foes. They fought in dense tropical\r\njungles against enemies who were very treacherous and very cruel, not\r\nonly toward our own men, but toward the great numbers of friendly\r\nnatives, the most peaceable and most civilized among whom eagerly\r\nwelcomed our rule. Under such circumstances, among a hundred thousand\r\nhot-blooded and powerful young men serving in small detachments\r\non the other side of the globe, it was impossible that occasional\r\ninstances of wrongdoing should not occur. The fact that they occurred\r\nin retaliation for wellnigh intolerable provocation can not for one\r\nmoment be admitted in the way of excuse or justification. All good\r\nAmericans regret and deplore them, and the War Department has taken\r\nevery step in its power to punish the offenders and to prevent or\r\nminimize the chance of repetition of the offence. But these offences\r\nwere the exception and not the rule. As a whole our troops showed not\r\nonly signal courage and efficiency, but great humanity and the most\r\nsincere desire to promote the welfare and liberties of the islanders.\r\nIn a series of exceedingly harassing and difficult campaigns they\r\ncompletely overthrew the enemy, reducing them finally to a condition\r\nof mere brigandage; and wherever they conquered they conquered only to\r\nmake way for the rule of the civil government, for the introduction\r\nof law, and of liberty under the law. When, by last July, the last\r\nvestige of organized insurrection had disappeared, peace and amnesty\r\nwere proclaimed.\r\n\r\nAs rapidly as the military rule was extended over the islands by\r\nthe defeat of the insurgents, just so rapidly was it replaced by\r\nthe civil government. At the present time the civil government is\r\nsupreme and the army in the Philippines has been reduced until it is\r\nsufficient merely to provide against the recurrence of trouble. In\r\nGovernor Taft and his associates we sent to the Filipinos as upright,\r\nas conscientious, and as able a group of administrators as ever any\r\ncountry has been blessed with having. With them and under them we\r\nhave associated the best men among the Filipinos, so that the great\r\nmajority of the officials, including many of the highest rank, are\r\nthemselves natives of the islands. The administration is incorruptibly\r\nhonest; justice is as jealously safeguarded as here at home. The\r\ngovernment is conducted purely in the interests of the people of the\r\nislands; they are protected in their religious and civil rights; they\r\nhave been given an excellent and well administered school system, and\r\neach of them now enjoys rights to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness” such as were never before known in all the history of the\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nThe Congress which has just adjourned has passed legislation of high\r\nimportance and great wisdom in the interests of the Filipino people.\r\nFirst and foremost, they conferred upon them by law the present\r\nadmirable civil government; in addition they gave them an excellent\r\ncurrency; they passed a measure allowing the organization of a native\r\nconstabulary; and they provided, in the interests of the islands, for\r\na reduction of twenty-five per cent in the tariff on Filipino articles\r\nbrought to this country. I asked that a still further reduction should\r\nbe made. It was not granted by the last Congress, but I think that in\r\nsome shape it will be granted by the next. And even without it, the\r\nrecord of legislation in the interests of the Filipinos is one with\r\nwhich we have a right to feel great satisfaction.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Congress appropriated three million dollars, following the\r\nprecedent it set when the people of Porto Rico were afflicted by\r\nsudden disaster; this money to be used by the Philippine government\r\nin order to meet the distress occasioned primarily by the terrible\r\ncattle disease which almost annihilated the carabao or water-buffalo,\r\nthe chief and most important domestic animal in the islands. Coming\r\nas this disaster did upon the heels of the havoc wrought by the\r\ninsurrectionary war, great suffering has been caused; and this misery,\r\nfor which this Government is in no way responsible, will doubtless in\r\nturn increase the difficulties of the Philippine government for the\r\nnext year or so. In consequence there will doubtless here and there\r\noccur sporadic increases of the armed brigandage to which the islands\r\nhave been habituated from time immemorial, and here and there for\r\ntheir own purposes the bandits may choose to style themselves patriots\r\nor insurrectionists; but these local difficulties will be of little\r\nconsequence save as they give occasion to a few men here at home again\r\nto try to mislead our people. Not only has the military problem in the\r\nPhilippines been worked out quicker and better than we had dared to\r\nexpect, but the progress socially and in civil government has likewise\r\nexceeded our fondest hopes.\r\n\r\nThe best thing that can be done in handling such a problem as that in\r\nthe Philippine Islands, so peculiar, so delicate, so difficult and so\r\nremote, is to put the best man possible in charge and then give him\r\nthe heartiest possible support, and the freest possible hand. This is\r\nwhat has been done with Governor Taft. There is not in this Nation\r\na higher or finer type of public servant than Governor Taft. He has\r\nrendered literally inestimable service, not only to the people of\r\nthe Philippine Islands but also to the people of the United States,\r\nby what he has done in those islands. He has been able to do it,\r\nbecause from the beginning he has been given absolute support by the\r\nWar Department, under Secretary Root. With the cessation of organized\r\nresistance the civil government assumed its proper position of\r\nheadship. The army in the Philippines is now one of the instruments\r\nthrough which Governor Taft does his admirable work. The civil\r\ngovernment, of which Governor Taft is the head, is supreme, and will\r\ndo well in the future as it has in the past, because it will be backed\r\nup in the future as it has been in the past.\r\n\r\nRemember always that in the Philippines the American Government has\r\ntried and is trying to carry out exactly what the greatest genius\r\nand most revered patriot ever known in the Philippine Islands—José\r\nRizal—steadfastly advocated. This man shortly before his death,\r\nin a message to his countrymen, under date of December 16, 1896,\r\ncondemned unsparingly the insurrection of Aguinaldo, terminated just\r\nbefore our navy appeared upon the scene, and pointed out the path\r\nhis people should follow to liberty and enlightenment. Speaking of\r\nthe insurrection and of the pretence that Filipino independence of a\r\nwholesome character could thereby be obtained, he wrote:\r\n\r\n“When, in spite of my advice, a movement was begun, I offered of my\r\nown accord, not only my services, but my life and even my good name\r\nto be used in any way they might believe effective in stifling the\r\nrebellion. I thought of the disaster which would follow the success of\r\nthe revolution, and I deemed myself fortunate if by any sacrifice I\r\ncould block the progress of such a useless calamity.\r\n\r\n“My countrymen, I have given proof that I was one who sought liberty\r\nfor our country and I still seek it. But as a first step I insisted\r\nupon the development of the people in order that, by means of\r\neducation and of labor, they might acquire the proper individual\r\ncharacter and force which would make them worthy of it. In my writings\r\nI have commended to you study and civic virtue, without which our\r\nredemption does not exist.... I can not do less than condemn, and I do\r\ncondemn, this absurd and savage insurrection planned behind my back,\r\nwhich dishonors us before the Filipinos and discredits us with those\r\nwho otherwise would argue in our behalf. I abominate its cruelties\r\nand disavow any kind of connection with it, regretting with all the\r\nsorrow of my soul that these reckless men have allowed themselves to\r\nbe deceived. Let them return, then, to their homes, and may God pardon\r\nthose who have acted in bad faith.”\r\n\r\nThis message embodied precisely and exactly the avowed policy upon\r\nwhich the American Government has acted in the Philippines. What the\r\npatriot Rizal said with such force in speaking of the insurrection\r\nbefore we came to the islands applies with tenfold greater force\r\nto those who foolishly or wickedly opposed the mild and beneficent\r\ngovernment we were instituting in the islands. The judgment of the\r\nmartyred public servant, Rizal, whose birthday the Philippine people\r\ncelebrate, and whom they worship as their hero and ideal, sets forth\r\nthe duty of American sovereignty; a duty from which the American\r\npeople will never flinch.\r\n\r\nWhile we have been doing these great and beneficent works in the\r\nislands, we have yet been steadily reducing the cost at which they\r\nare done. The last Congress repealed the law for the war taxes, and\r\nthe War Department has reduced the Army from the maximum number of one\r\nhundred thousand allowed under the law to very nearly the minimum of\r\nsixty thousand.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the last Congress enacted some admirable legislation\r\naffecting the Army, passing first of all the militia bill and then\r\nthe bill to create a general staff. The militia bill represents the\r\nrealization of a reform which had been championed ineffectively by\r\nWashington, and had been fruitlessly agitated ever since. At last we\r\nhave taken from the statute books the obsolete militia law of the\r\nRevolutionary days and have provided for efficient aid to the National\r\nGuard of the States. I believe that no other great country has such\r\nfine natural material for volunteer soldiers as we have, and it is the\r\nobvious duty of the nation and of the States to make such provision as\r\nwill enable this volunteer soldiery to be organized with all possible\r\nrapidity and efficiency in time of war; and, furthermore, to help in\r\nevery way the National Guard in time of peace. The militia law enacted\r\nby the Congress marks the first long step ever taken in this direction\r\nby the National Government. The general-staff law is of immense\r\nimportance and benefit to the Regular Army. Individually, I would not\r\nadmit that the American regular, either officer or enlisted man, is\r\ninferior to any other regular soldier in the world. In fact, if it\r\nwere worth while to boast, I should be tempted to say that he was\r\nthe best. But there must be proper training, proper organization and\r\nadministration, in order to get the best service out of even the best\r\ntroops. This is particularly the case with such a small army as ours,\r\nscattered over so vast a country. We do not need a large Regular Army,\r\nbut we do need to have our small Regular Army the very best that can\r\npossibly be produced. Under the worn-out and ineffective organization\r\nwhich has hitherto existed, a sudden strain is absolutely certain to\r\nproduce the dislocation and confusion we saw at the outbreak of the\r\nwar with Spain; and when such dislocation and confusion occurs it is\r\neasy and natural, but entirely improper, to blame the men who happen\r\nto be in office, instead of the system which is really responsible.\r\nUnder the law just enacted by Congress this system will be changed\r\nimmensely for the better, and every patriotic American ought to\r\nrejoice; for when we come to the Army and the Navy we deal with the\r\nhonor and interests of all our people; and when such is the case\r\nparty lines are as nothing, and we all stand shoulder to shoulder as\r\nAmericans, moved only by pride in and love for our common country.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT MEDORA, NORTH DAKOTA, APRIL 7, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\n  _My Friends and Neighbors_:\r\n\r\nI am very glad to see you all. I made up my mind that come what would\r\nI would stop at Medora. I first came to Medora twenty years ago, so\r\nI am a middling old settler. I meet boys, great big strapping men,\r\nand mothers of families who were children about three feet high when\r\nI knew them here. It is a very pleasant thing for me to see you. I\r\nshall not try to make you more than a very short talk, because I want\r\nto have the chance to shake hands with you. Most all of you are old\r\nfriends. I have stopped at your houses and shared your hospitality.\r\nWith some of the men I have ridden guard around the cattle at night,\r\nworked with them in the round-up, and hunted with them, so that I know\r\nthem pretty well. It is the greatest possible pleasure to me to come\r\nback and see how you are getting along, to see the progress made by\r\nthe State, to see the progress made up at this end in the place that I\r\nknow so well, and it does me good to come here and see you. There is\r\nnot a human being who is more proud of what you have done, and more\r\npleased with your welfare and progress, than I am.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT JAMESTOWN, N. D., APRIL 7, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman and my Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nI have only time to develop one thought to you to-day, and that is\r\nsuggested to me by a letter sent me by a labor organization here in\r\nyour city thanking me for some of the work that has been done in\r\nCongress this year, in connection with labor matters, in connection\r\nwith what is called trust legislation. All that we have been trying\r\nto do, with a certain fair amount of success, through legislation\r\nand through administration, has been to do square and equal justice\r\nbetween man and man; to try to give every man a fair chance, to try\r\nto secure good treatment for him, if he deserves it, be he rich or\r\npoor, and to try to see that he does not wrong his fellow. After all,\r\nthat is about what must be the essence of legislation, if it is to\r\nbe really good legislation. Take such a matter as these so-called\r\nanti-trust laws—I always hate to have them called anti-trust laws\r\nor anti-corporation laws because they are not designed to hurt any\r\ncorporation, they are simply designed for such regulations and control\r\nas will prevent the doing of ill. Take the anti-rebate law passed by\r\nthe last Congress. It was merely designed to make effective previous\r\nlegislation, to prevent any discrimination by any railroad in favor of\r\nor against any particular shipper—not trying to favor the big shipper\r\nor the little shipper; only trying to secure a fair deal for each, get\r\nfair play for each, so that each man shall have the chance to which\r\nhe is entitled. That is not a bill aimed at the railroads, it is only\r\naimed at any railroad that does anything wrong, in the same way that\r\nit is aimed at a shipper that does anything wrong—no more against the\r\nbig shipper than the little shipper. It is meant to do square justice\r\nto each man, big or little, and to ensure, as far as by legislation we\r\ncan secure, that he will do fair justice in return.\r\n\r\nTake the report of the Anthracite Coal Strike Commission and the\r\nspirit in which that commission went to work. They were not trying to\r\ndecide for the operators or for the miners. They were trying to do\r\njustice to both the operator and the miner, and to secure justice for\r\nthe general public.\r\n\r\nLegislation to be thoroughly effective for good must proceed upon the\r\nprinciple of aiming to get for each man a fair chance to allow him\r\nto show the stuff there is in him. No legislation can make some men\r\nprosperous; no legislation can give wisdom to the foolish, courage to\r\nthe timid, strength to the shiftless. All that legislation can do, and\r\nall that honest and fearless administration of the laws can do is to\r\ngive each man as good a chance as possible to develop the qualities\r\nhe has in him, and to protect him so far as is humanly possible\r\nagainst wrong of any kind at the hands of his fellows. That is what\r\nlegislation can do, and that I think I may say we have successfully\r\ntried to do both by legislation and by the administration of the law.\r\n\r\nI have seen you grow up. I am proud of you. I can assure you that so\r\nfar as in me lies the efforts of the National Government, legislative\r\nand administrative, will be to help you and all others of our people\r\nin the only way in which they can be helped—to help them to help\r\nthemselves, to help them so that each man shall have the fairest field\r\nto show the stuff that there is in him, the qualities that he has at\r\nhis command.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT LAYING OF CORNERSTONE OF GATEWAY TO YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK,\r\nGARDINER, MONTANA, APRIL 24, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor, Mr. Superintendent, and my Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nI wish to thank the people of Montana generally, those of Gardiner and\r\nCinnabar especially, and more especially still all those employed in\r\nthe Park, whether in civil or military capacity, for my very enjoyable\r\ntwo weeks’ holiday.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure now to say a few words to you at the laying of the\r\ncornerstone of the beautiful road which is to mark the entrance to\r\nthis Park. The Yellowstone Park is something absolutely unique in the\r\nworld, so far as I know. Nowhere else in any civilized country is\r\nthere to be found such a tract of veritable wonderland made accessible\r\nto all visitors, where at the same time not only the scenery of the\r\nwilderness, but the wild creatures of the Park are scrupulously\r\npreserved; the only change being that these same wild creatures\r\nhave been so carefully protected as to show a literally astounding\r\ntameness. The creation and preservation of such a great natural\r\nplayground in the interest of our people as a whole is a credit to the\r\nnation; but above all a credit to Montana, Wyoming and Idaho. It has\r\nbeen preserved with wise foresight. The scheme of its preservation\r\nis noteworthy in its essential democracy. Private game preserves,\r\nthough they may be handled in such a way as to be not only good things\r\nfor themselves, but good things for the surrounding community, can\r\nyet never be more than poor substitutes, from the standpoint of the\r\npublic, for great national playgrounds such as this Yellowstone Park.\r\nThis Park was created, and is now administered, for the benefit and\r\nenjoyment of the people. The government must continue to appropriate\r\nfor it especially in the direction of completing and perfecting an\r\nexcellent system of driveways. But already its beauties can be seen\r\nwith great comfort in a short space of time and at an astoundingly\r\nsmall cost, and with the sense on the part of every visitor that it\r\nis in part his property, that it is the property of Uncle Sam and\r\ntherefore of all of us. The only way that the people as a whole can\r\nsecure to themselves and their children the enjoyment in perpetuity of\r\nwhat the Yellowstone Park has to give is by assuming the ownership in\r\nthe name of the nation and by jealously safeguarding and preserving\r\nthe scenery, the forests, and the wild creatures. When we have a\r\ngood system of carriage roads throughout the Park—for of course it\r\nwould be very unwise to allow either steam or electric roads in the\r\nPark—we shall have a region as easy and accessible to travel in as\r\nit is already every whit as interesting as any similar territory of\r\nthe Alps or the Italian Riviera. The geysers, the extraordinary hot\r\nsprings, the lakes, the mountains, the canyons, and cataracts unite to\r\nmake this region something not wholly to be paralleled elsewhere on\r\nthe globe. It must be kept for the benefit and enjoyment of all of\r\nus; and I hope to see a steadily increasing number of our people take\r\nadvantage of its attractions. At present it is rather singular that\r\na greater number of people come from Europe to see it than come from\r\nour own Eastern States. The people near by seem awake to its beauties;\r\nand I hope that more and more of our people who dwell far off will\r\nappreciate its really marvelous character. Incidentally, I should like\r\nto point out that some time people will surely awake to the fact that\r\nthe Park has special beauties to be seen in winter; and any hardy man\r\nwho can go through it in that season on skis will enjoy himself as he\r\nscarcely could elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI wish especially to congratulate the people of Montana, Wyoming, and\r\nIdaho, and notably you of Gardiner and Cinnabar and the immediate\r\noutskirts of the Park, for the way in which you heartily co-operate\r\nwith the superintendent to prevent acts of vandalism and destruction.\r\nMajor Pitcher has explained to me how much he owes to your\r\nco-operation and your lively appreciation of the fact that the Park\r\nis simply being kept in the interest of all of us, so that every one\r\nmay have the chance to see its wonders with ease and comfort at the\r\nminimum of expense. I have always thought it was a liberal education\r\nto any man of the East to come West, and he can combine profit\r\nwith pleasure if he will incidentally visit this Park, the Grand\r\nCanyon of the Colorado, and the Yosemite, and take the sea voyage to\r\nAlaska. Major Pitcher reports to me, by the way, that he has received\r\ninvaluable assistance from the game wardens of Montana and Wyoming,\r\nand that the present game warden of Idaho has also promised his hearty\r\naid.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of the forests is of course the matter of prime\r\nimportance in every public reserve of this character. In this region\r\nof the Rocky Mountains and the great plains the problem of the water\r\nsupply is the most important which the home-maker has to face.\r\nCongress has not of recent years done anything wiser than in passing\r\nthe irrigation bill; and nothing is more essential to the preservation\r\nof the water supply than the preservation of the forests. Montana\r\nhas in its water power a source of development which has hardly yet\r\nbeen touched. This water power will be seriously impaired if ample\r\nprotection is not given the forests. Therefore this Park, like the\r\nforest reserves generally, is of the utmost advantage to the country\r\naround from the merely utilitarian side. But of course this Park, also\r\nbecause of its peculiar features, is to be preserved as a beautiful\r\nnatural playground. Here all the wild creatures of the old days are\r\nbeing preserved, and their overflow into the surrounding country\r\nmeans that the people of the surrounding country, so long as they\r\nsee that the laws are observed by all, will be able to ensure to\r\nthemselves and to their children and to their children’s children\r\nmuch of the old-time pleasure of the hardy life of the wilderness and\r\nof the hunter in the wilderness. This pleasure, moreover, can under\r\nsuch conditions be kept for all who have the love of adventure and\r\nthe hardihood to take advantage of it, with small regard for what\r\ntheir fortune may be. I can not too often repeat that the essential\r\nfeature in the present management of the Yellowstone Park, as in all\r\nsimilar places, is its essential democracy—it is the preservation\r\nof the scenery, of the forests, of the wilderness life and the\r\nwilderness game for the people as a whole, instead of leaving the\r\nenjoyment thereof to be confined to the very rich who can control\r\nprivate reserves. I have been literally astounded at the enormous\r\nquantities of elk and at the number of deer, antelope and mountain\r\nsheep which I have seen on their wintering grounds; and the deer and\r\nsheep in particular are quite as tame as range stock. A few buffalo\r\nare being preserved. I wish very much that the government could\r\nsomewhere provide for an experimental breeding station of cross-breeds\r\nbetween buffalo and the common cattle. If these cross-breeds could be\r\nsuccessfully perpetuated we should have animals which would produce\r\na robe quite as good as the old buffalo robe with which twenty years\r\nago every one was familiar, and animals moreover which would be so\r\nhardy that I think they would have a distinct commercial importance.\r\nThey would, for instance, be admirably suited for Alaska, a territory\r\nwhich I look to see develop astoundingly within the next decade or\r\ntwo, not only because of its furs and fisheries, but because of its\r\nagricultural and pastoral possibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT OMAHA, NEB., APRIL 27, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman, and you, my Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nIt is a great pleasure to come before you this evening. Since Saturday\r\nI have been traveling through your great and beautiful State. I know\r\nyour people; I have been with them; I have worked with them; and it\r\nis indeed a joy to come here now and see from one end of your State\r\nto the other the signs of your abounding prosperity. I feel that the\r\nfuture of Nebraska is secure. There will be temporary ups and downs,\r\nand of course if any of you are guilty of folly, from your own folly\r\nnothing can save you but yourselves. But if you act as I believe and\r\ntrust that you will act, this State has a future before it second to\r\nthat of no other State in this great Nation.\r\n\r\nI address you to-night on the anniversary of the birth of the great\r\nsilent soldier—Ulysses Grant, and I am glad to have the chance of\r\nsaying a few words to an audience such as this in this great typical\r\ncity of the West on the occasion of the birthday of the great Western\r\ngeneral, the great American general. It is a good thing to pay homage\r\nwith our lips to the illustrious dead. It is a good thing to keep in\r\nmind what we owe to the memories of Washington and his fellows, who\r\nfounded this mighty Republic; to Abraham Lincoln and Grant and their\r\nfellows, who saved it. It is a far better thing to pay the homage that\r\ncounts—the homage of our lives and our deeds. Illustrious memories of\r\nthe Nation’s past are but curses if they serve the men of the Nation\r\nat present as excuses for shirking the problems of the day. They are\r\nblessings if they serve to spur on the men of now to see that they act\r\nas well in their time as the men of yesterday did in theirs.\r\n\r\nEach generation has its peculiar problems; each generation has certain\r\ntasks allotted to it to do. Shame to it if it treats the glorious\r\ndeeds of a generation that went before as an excuse for its own\r\nfailure to do the peculiar task it finds ready to hand. Upon the way\r\nin which we solve our problems will depend whether our children and\r\nour children’s children shall look back or shall not look back to us\r\nwith the veneration which we feel for the men of the mighty years\r\nof the Civil War. Our task is a lighter one than theirs, but it is\r\nan important one, and do it we must, if we wish to rise level to\r\nthe standard set us by our forefathers. You in Nebraska have passed\r\nthrough periods of terrible privation, of misery and hardship. They\r\nwere evil times. And yet, there is no experience, no evil, that out\r\nof it good can not come, if only we look at it right. Things are\r\nbetter now. Things can be kept better, but only on condition that\r\nwe face facts with coolness and sanity, with clear-eyed vision that\r\ntells us what is true and what is false. When things go wrong there\r\nis a tendency in humanity to wish to blame some of its fellows. It\r\nis a natural tendency, and by no means always a wholesome tendency.\r\nThere is always a tendency to feel that somehow by legislation, by\r\nthe enactment of some law, by the trying of some patent scheme\r\nthings can be made permanently better. Now, something can be done\r\nby law. A good deal can be done by law. Even more can be done by\r\nthe honest administration of the law; an administration which knows\r\nneither fear nor favor, which treats each man exactly as that man’s\r\nrecord entitles him to be treated; the kind of enforcement of the\r\nlaw which I think I may promise that you will have while Mr. Knox\r\nremains Attorney-General. But more than the law, far more than the\r\nadministration of the law, depends upon the individual quality of the\r\naverage citizen. The chief factor in winning success for your State,\r\nfor the people in the State, must be what the chief factor in winning\r\nthe success of a people has been from the beginning of time—the\r\ncharacter of the individual man, of the individual woman.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the homage we should pay to the memory of Grant.\r\nIt is the homage we should pay to the memory of Lincoln, the homage\r\nwe should pay to all of our fellow-countrymen who have at any time\r\nrendered great service to the Republic, and it can be rendered in\r\nmost efficient form not by merely praising them for having dealt\r\nwith problems which now we do not have to face, but by facing our\r\nproblems in the same spirit in which they faced theirs. Nothing was\r\nmore noteworthy in all of Lincoln’s character than the way in which\r\nhe combined fealty to the loftiest ideal with a thoroughly practical\r\ncapacity to achieve that ideal by practical methods. He did not war\r\nwith phantoms; he did not struggle among the clouds; he faced facts;\r\nhe endeavored to get the best results he could out of the warring\r\nforces with which he had to deal. When he could not get the best he\r\nwas forced to content himself, and did content himself, with the\r\nbest possible. What he did in his day we must do in ours. It is not\r\npossible to lay down any rule of conduct so specific that it will\r\nenable us to meet each particular issue as it arises. All that can be\r\ndone is to lay down certain general rules, and then to try, each man\r\nfor himself, to apply those general rules to the specific cases that\r\ncome up.\r\n\r\nOur complex industrial civilization has not only been productive of\r\nmuch benefit, but has also brought us face to face with many puzzling\r\nproblems; problems that are puzzling, partly because there are men\r\nthat are wicked, partly because there are good men who are foolish\r\nor short-sighted. There are many such to-day—the problems of labor\r\nand capital, the problems which we group together rather vaguely when\r\nwe speak of the problems of the trusts, the problems affecting the\r\nfarmers on the one hand, the railroads on the other. It would not be\r\npossible in any one place to deal with the particular shapes which\r\nthese problems take at that time and in that place. And yet, there are\r\ncertain general rules which can be laid down for dealing with them,\r\nand those rules are the immutable rules of justice, of sanity, of\r\ncourage, of common-sense. Six months ago it fell to my lot to appoint\r\na commission to investigate into and conclude about matters connected\r\nwith the great and menacing strike in the anthracite coal fields of\r\nPennsylvania. On that commission I appointed representatives of the\r\nchurch, of the bench, of the army, a representative of the capitalists\r\nof the region, and a representative of organized labor. They published\r\na report which was not only of the utmost moment because of dealing\r\nwith the great and vital problem with which they were appointed to\r\ndeal, but also because in its conclusions it initiated certain general\r\nrules in so clear and masterful a fashion that I wish most earnestly\r\nit could receive the broadest circulation as a tract wherever there\r\nexists or threatens to exist trouble in any way akin to that with\r\nwhich those commissioners dealt.\r\n\r\nIf I might give a word of advice to Omaha, I should like to see your\r\ndaily press publish in full the concluding portion of that report\r\nof the Anthracite Coal Strike Commission, signed by all the members\r\nthereof, by those in a special sense the champion of the wage-worker,\r\nand by those in a special sense identified with capital, organized\r\nor unorganized; because, men and women of Omaha, those people did\r\nnot speak first as capitalist or as laborer, did not speak first as\r\njudge, as army man, as church man, but all of them signed that report\r\nas American citizens anxious to see right and justice prevail. No one\r\nquality will get us out of any difficulty. We need more than one; we\r\nneed a good many. We need, as I said, the power first of each man’s\r\nhonestly trying to look at the problem from his fellow’s standpoint.\r\nCapitalist and wage-worker alike should honestly endeavor each to look\r\nat any matter from the other’s standpoint, with a freedom on the one\r\nhand from the contemptible arrogance which looks down upon the man\r\nof less means, and on the other, from the no less contemptible envy,\r\njealousy and rancor, which hates another because he is better off.\r\nEach quality is the supplement of the other, and in point of baseness\r\nthere is not the weight of a finger to choose between them. Look at\r\nthe report signed by those men; look at it in the spirit in which they\r\nwrote it, and if you can only make yourselves, make this community,\r\napproach the problems of to-day in the spirit that those men, your\r\nfellows, showed in approaching the problem of yesterday, your problems\r\nwill be solved.\r\n\r\nAny man who tries to excite class hatred, sectional hate, hate of\r\ncreeds, any kind of hatred in our community, though he may affect to\r\ndo it in the interest of the class he is addressing, is in the long\r\nrun with absolute certainty that class’s own worst enemy. In the long\r\nrun, and as a whole, we are going to go up or go down together. Of\r\ncourse there will be individual exceptions, small, local exceptions,\r\nexceptions in kind, exceptions in place; but as a whole, if the\r\ncommonwealth prospers some measure of prosperity comes to all of\r\nus. If it is not prosperous, then the adversity, though it may fall\r\nunequally upon us, will weigh more or less upon all. It lies with us\r\nourselves to determine our own fate. I can not too often say that the\r\nwisest law, the best administration of the law, can do naught more\r\nthan give us a fair field in which to work out that fate aright. If as\r\nindividuals, or as a community, we mar our future by our own folly,\r\nlet us remember that it is upon ourselves that the responsibility must\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM ADDRESS AT QUINCY, ILL., APRIL 29, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman and my Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nThere is one matter which I think presses for national legislative\r\nattention—the matter of the currency. From your sister State of Iowa\r\nI have a Secretary of the Treasury, who, as he showed last fall,\r\ncan be counted on to act with courage and with wisdom whenever the\r\nneed arises, and to use fearlessly and coolly whatever the law now\r\nallows him to use. Our currency laws have been recently improved\r\nby specific declarations intended to secure permanency of values;\r\nbut this does not imply that these laws may not be further improved\r\nand strengthened. It is wellnigh universally admitted, certainly in\r\nany business community such as this, that our currency system is\r\nwanting in elasticity; that is, the volume does not respond to the\r\nvarying needs of the country as a whole, nor to the varying needs of\r\nthe different localities as well as of different times. Our people\r\nscarcely need to be reminded that grain-raising communities require\r\na larger volume of currency at harvest time than during the summer\r\nmonths; and the same principle in greater or less extent applies to\r\nevery community. Our currency laws need such modification as will\r\nensure definitely the parity of every dollar coined or issued by the\r\ngovernment, and such expansion or contraction of the currency as will\r\npromptly and automatically respond to the varying needs of commerce.\r\nPermanent increase would be dangerous, permanent contraction ruinous,\r\nbut the needed elasticity must be brought about by provisions which\r\nwill permit both contraction and expansion as the varying needs of the\r\nseveral communities and business interests at different times and in\r\ndifferent localities require.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT ODEON HALL, ST. LOUIS, MO., BEFORE THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL\r\nGOOD ROADS CONVENTION, APRIL 29, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nWhen we wish to use descriptive terms fit to characterize great\r\nempires and the men who made those empires great, invariably one of\r\nthe terms used is to signify that that empire built good roads. When\r\nwe speak of the Romans, we speak of them as rulers, as conquerors, as\r\nadministrators, as road builders. There were empires that rose over\r\nnight and fell over night, empires whose influence was absolutely\r\nevanescent, which have passed away without leaving a trace of their\r\nformer existence; but wherever the Roman established his rule the\r\ntraces of that rule remain deep to-day, stamped on the language and\r\ncustoms of the people, or stamped in tangible form upon the soil\r\nitself. And so passing through Britain fifteen centuries and over\r\nafter the dominion of Rome passed away, the Roman roads as features\r\nstill remain; going through Italy, where power after power has\r\nrisen, and flourished, and vanished since the days when the temporal\r\ndominion of the Roman emperors transferred its seat from Rome to\r\nByzantium—going through Italy after the Lombard, the Goth, the\r\nByzantine, and all the people of the Middle Ages that have ruled that\r\ncountry—it is the imperishable Roman road that reappears.\r\n\r\nThe faculty, the art, the habit of road building marks in a nation\r\nthose solid, stable qualities which tell for permanent greatness.\r\nMerely from the standpoint of historic analogy we should have a right\r\nto ask that this people which has tamed a continent, which has built\r\nup a country with a continent for its base, which boasts itself,\r\nwith truth, as the mightiest republic that the world has ever seen,\r\nwhich I firmly believe will in the century now opening rise to a\r\nposition of headship and leadership such as no other nation has ever\r\nyet attained—merely from historic analogy, I say, we should have\r\na right to demand that such a nation build good roads. Much more\r\nhave we the right to demand it from the practical standpoint. The\r\ngreat difference between the semi-barbarism of the Middle Ages and\r\nthe civilization which succeeded it was the difference between poor\r\nand good means of communication. And we to whom space is less of an\r\nobstacle than ever it was in the history of any other nation, we who\r\nhave spanned a continent, who have thrust our border westward in the\r\ncourse of a century and a quarter until it has gone from the Atlantic\r\nto the Alleghanies, from the Alleghanies down into the valley of the\r\nMississippi, across the great plains, over the Rockies to where the\r\nGolden Gate lets through the long heaving waters of the Pacific, and\r\nfinally to Alaska, to the Arctic regions, to the tropic islands of the\r\nsea—we who take so little account of mere space must see to it that\r\nthe best means of nullifying the existence of space are at our command.\r\n\r\nOf course, during the last century there has been an altogether\r\nphenomenal growth of one kind of road wholly unknown to the people of\r\nan earlier period—the iron road. The railroad is, of course, something\r\npurely modern. A great many excellent people have proceeded upon\r\nthe assumption that somehow or other having good railways should be\r\na substitute for having good highways, good ordinary roads. A more\r\nuntenable position can not be imagined. What the railway does is to\r\ndevelop the country; and of course its development implies that the\r\ndeveloped country will need more and better roads.\r\n\r\nA few years ago it was a matter of humiliation that there should\r\nbe so little attention paid to our roads; that there should be a\r\nwillingness not merely to refrain from making good roads, but to let\r\nthe roads that were in existence become worse. I can not too heartily\r\ncongratulate our people upon the existence of a body such as this,\r\nramifying into every section of the country, having its connections\r\nin every State of the country, and bent upon that eminently proper\r\nwork of making the conditions of life easier and better for the people\r\nwhom of all others we can least afford to see grow discontented with\r\ntheir lot in life—the people who live in the country districts.\r\nThe extraordinary, the wholly unheard-of, rate of our industrial\r\ndevelopment during the past seventy-five years, together with the\r\ngood sides has had some evil sides. It is a fine thing to see our\r\ncities built up, but not at the expense of the country districts.\r\nThe healthy thing to see is the building up of both the country and\r\ncity go hand in hand. But we can not expect the ablest, the most\r\neager, the most ambitious young men to stay in the country, to stay\r\non the farm, unless they have certain advantages. If the farm life\r\nis a life of isolation, a life in which it is a matter of great and\r\nreal difficulty for one man to communicate with his neighbor, you can\r\nrest assured that there will be a tendency to leave it on the part\r\nof those very people whom we should most wish to see stay in it. It\r\nis a good thing to encourage in every way any tendency which will\r\ntend to check an unhealthy flow from the country to the city. There\r\nare several such tendencies in evidence at present. The growth of\r\nelectricity as a means of transportation tends to a certain degree\r\nto exercise a centrifugal force to offset the centripetal force of\r\nsteam. Exactly as steam and electricity have tended to gather men in\r\nmasses, so now electricity, as applied to the purposes which steam\r\nhas so long claimed as exclusively its own, tends again to scatter\r\nout the masses. The trolley lines that go out into the country are\r\ndoing a great deal to render it more possible to live in the country\r\nand yet not to lose wholly the advantages of the town. The telephone\r\nis not to be minimized as an instrument with a tendency in the same\r\ndirection; and rural free delivery is playing its part along the same\r\nlines. But no one thing can do more to offset the tendency toward\r\nan unhealthy growth from the country into the city than the making\r\nand keeping of good roads. They are needed for the sake of their\r\neffect upon the industrial conditions of the country districts; and\r\nI am almost tempted to say they are needed for the sake of social\r\nconditions in the country districts. If winter means to the average\r\nfarmer the existence of a long line of liquid morasses through which\r\nhe is to move his goods if bent on business, or to wade and swim if\r\nbent on pleasure; if winter means that after an ordinary rain the\r\nfarmer boy or girl can not use his or her bicycle; if a little heavy\r\nweather means a stoppage of all communication not only with industrial\r\ncentres but with the neighbors, you must expect that there will be\r\na great many young people of both sexes who will not find farm life\r\nattractive. It is for this reason that I feel the work you are doing\r\nis so pre-eminently one in the interest of the Nation as a whole. I\r\ncongratulate you upon the fact that you are doing it. In our American\r\nlife it would be hard to overestimate the amount of good that has\r\nbeen accomplished by associations of individuals who have gathered\r\ntogether to work for a common object which was to be of benefit to\r\nthe community as a whole; and among all the excellent objects for\r\nwhich men and women combine to work to-day, there are few indeed which\r\nhave a better right to command the energies of those engaged in the\r\nmovement, and the hearty sympathy and support of those outside, than\r\nthis movement in which you are engaged.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT ST. LOUIS UNIVERSITY, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI, APRIL 29, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Cardinal Gibbons, Ladies and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a pleasure to be received here as a guest of the first\r\nand oldest university founded in our country west of the Mississippi\r\nRiver in the Louisiana Purchase. I know your work. I have myself been\r\nmuch in the West, and I have come across the traces of your work, both\r\namong the communities of our own people and among the Indian tribes.\r\n\r\nI thank you personally for your kind allusions to me, and would hold\r\nmyself recreant to the principles upon which this government was\r\nfounded did I not strive as Chief Executive to do fair and equal\r\njustice to all men without regard to the way in which any man chooses\r\nto worship his Maker.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE DEDICATION CEREMONIES OF THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE EXPOSITION, ST.\r\nLOUIS, APRIL 30, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President, Ladies, and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nAt the outset of my address let me recall to the minds of my\r\nhearers that the soil upon which we stand, before it was ours, was\r\nsuccessively the possession of two mighty empires, Spain and France,\r\nwhose sons made a deathless record of heroism in the early annals\r\nof the New World. No history of the Western country can be written\r\nwithout paying heed to the wonderful part played therein in the early\r\ndays by the soldiers, missionaries, explorers, and traders, who did\r\ntheir work for the honor of the proud banners of France and Castile.\r\nWhile the settlers of English-speaking stock, and those of Dutch,\r\nGerman, and Scandinavian origin who were associated with them, were\r\nstill clinging close to the Eastern seaboard, the pioneers of Spain\r\nand of France had penetrated deep into the hitherto unknown wilderness\r\nof the West, had wandered far and wide within the boundaries of what\r\nis now our mighty country. The very cities themselves—St. Louis, New\r\nOrleans, Santa Fe—bear witness by their titles to the nationalities\r\nof their founders. It was not until the Revolution had begun that the\r\nEnglish-speaking settlers pushed west across the Alleghanies, and not\r\nuntil a century ago that they entered in to possess the land upon\r\nwhich we now stand.\r\n\r\nWe have met here to-day to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of\r\nthe event which more than any other, after the foundation of the\r\nGovernment and always excepting its preservation, determined the\r\ncharacter of our national life—determined that we should be a great\r\nexpanding Nation instead of relatively a small and stationary one.\r\n\r\nOf course it was not with the Louisiana Purchase that our career of\r\nexpansion began. In the middle of the Revolutionary War the Illinois\r\nregion, including the present States of Illinois and Indiana, was\r\nadded to our domain by force of arms, as a sequel to the adventurous\r\nexpedition of George Rogers Clark and his frontier riflemen. Later\r\nthe treaties of Jay and Pinckney materially extended our real\r\nboundaries to the West. But none of these events was of so striking\r\na character as to fix the popular imagination. The old thirteen\r\ncolonies had always claimed that their rights stretched westward to\r\nthe Mississippi, and vague and unreal though these claims were until\r\nmade good by conquest, settlement, and diplomacy, they still served to\r\ngive the impression that the earliest westward movements of our people\r\nwere little more than the filling in of already existing national\r\nboundaries.\r\n\r\nBut there could be no illusion about the acquisition of the vast\r\nterritory beyond the Mississippi, stretching westward to the Pacific,\r\nwhich in that day was known as Louisiana. This immense region\r\nwas admittedly the territory of a foreign power, of a European\r\nkingdom. None of our people had ever laid claim to a foot of it.\r\nIts acquisition could in no sense be treated as rounding out any\r\nexisting claims. When we acquired it we made evident once for all\r\nthat consciously and of set purpose we had embarked on a career\r\nof expansion, that we had taken our place among those daring and\r\nhardy nations who risk much with the hope and desire of winning high\r\nposition among the great powers of the earth. As is so often the case\r\nin nature, the law of development of a living organism showed itself\r\nin its actual workings to be wiser than the wisdom of the wisest.\r\n\r\nThis work of expansion was by far the greatest work of our people\r\nduring the years that intervened between the adoption of the\r\nConstitution and the outbreak of the Civil War. There were other\r\nquestions of real moment and importance, and there were many which\r\nat the time seemed such to those engaged in answering them; but the\r\ngreatest feat of our forefathers of those generations was the deed of\r\nthe men who, with pack train or wagon train, on horseback, on foot, or\r\nby boat, pushed the frontier ever westward across the continent.\r\n\r\nNever before had the world seen the kind of national expansion which\r\ngave our people all that part of the American continent lying west\r\nof the thirteen original States; the greatest landmark in which was\r\nthe Louisiana Purchase. Our triumph in this process of expansion was\r\nindissolubly bound up with the success of our peculiar kind of federal\r\ngovernment; and this success has been so complete that because of its\r\nvery completeness we now sometimes fail to appreciate not only the\r\nall-importance but the tremendous difficulty of the problem with which\r\nour Nation was originally faced.\r\n\r\nWhen our forefathers joined to call into being this Nation, they\r\nundertook a task for which there was but little encouraging precedent.\r\nThe development of civilization from the earliest period seemed to\r\nshow the truth of two propositions: In the first place, it had always\r\nproved exceedingly difficult to secure both freedom and strength\r\nin any government; and in the second place, it had always proved\r\nwellnigh impossible for a nation to expand without either breaking\r\nup or becoming a centralized tyranny. With the success of our effort\r\nto combine a strong and efficient national union, able to put down\r\ndisorder at home and to maintain our honor and interest abroad, I have\r\nnot now to deal. This success was signal and all-important, but it was\r\nby no means unprecedented in the same sense that our type of expansion\r\nwas unprecedented. The history of Rome and of Greece illustrates very\r\nwell the two types of expansion which had taken place in ancient time\r\nand which had been universally accepted as the only possible types up\r\nto the period when as a Nation we ourselves began to take possession\r\nof this continent. The Grecian States performed remarkable feats of\r\ncolonization, but each colony as soon as created became entirely\r\nindependent of the mother State, and in after years was almost as\r\napt to prove its enemy as its friend. Local self-government, local\r\nindependence, was secured, but only by the absolute sacrifice of\r\nanything resembling national unity. In consequence, the Greek world,\r\nfor all its wonderful brilliancy and the extraordinary artistic,\r\nliterary, and philosophical development which has made all mankind its\r\ndebtors for the ages, was yet wholly unable to withstand a formidable\r\nforeign foe, save spasmodically. As soon as powerful, permanent\r\nempires arose on its outskirts, the Greek states in the neighborhood\r\nof such empires fell under their sway. National power and greatness\r\nwere completely sacrificed to local liberty.\r\n\r\nWith Rome the exact opposite occurred. The imperial city rose to\r\nabsolute dominion over all the peoples of Italy and then expanded\r\nher rule over the entire civilized world by a process which kept\r\nthe nation strong and united, but gave no room whatever for local\r\nliberty and self-government. All other cities and countries were\r\nsubject to Rome. In consequence this great and masterful race of\r\nwarriors, rulers, road-builders, and administrators stamped their\r\nindelible impress upon all the after life of our race, and yet let an\r\nover-centralization eat out the vitals of their empire until it became\r\nan empty shell; so that when the barbarians came they destroyed only\r\nwhat had already become worthless to the world.\r\n\r\nThe underlying viciousness of each type of expansion was plain enough\r\nand the remedy now seems simple enough. But when the fathers of the\r\nRepublic first formulated the Constitution under which we live this\r\nremedy was untried and no one could foretell how it would work. They\r\nthemselves began the experiment almost immediately by adding new\r\nStates to the original thirteen. Excellent people in the East viewed\r\nthis initial expansion of the country with great alarm. Exactly as\r\nduring the colonial period many good people in the mother-country\r\nthought it highly important that settlers should be kept out of the\r\nOhio Valley in the interest of the fur companies, so after we had\r\nbecome a Nation many good people on the Atlantic Coast felt grave\r\napprehension lest they might somehow be hurt by the westward growth of\r\nthe Nation. These good people shook their heads over the formation of\r\nStates in the fertile Ohio Valley which now forms part of the heart\r\nof our Nation; and they declared that the destruction of the Republic\r\nhad been accomplished when through the Louisiana Purchase we acquired\r\nnearly half of what is now that same Republic’s present territory. Nor\r\nwas their feeling unnatural. Only the adventurous and the far-seeing\r\ncan be expected heartily to welcome the process of expansion, for the\r\nnation that expands is a nation which is entering upon a great career,\r\nand with greatness there must of necessity come perils which daunt all\r\nsave the most stout-hearted.\r\n\r\nWe expanded by carving the wilderness into Territories and out of\r\nthese Territories building new States when once they had received\r\nas permanent settlers a sufficient number of our own people. Being\r\na practical Nation we have never tried to force on any section of\r\nour new territory an unsuitable form of government merely because\r\nit was suitable for another section under different conditions. Of\r\nthe territory covered by the Louisiana Purchase a portion was given\r\nStatehood within a few years. Another portion has not been admitted\r\nto Statehood, although a century has elapsed—although doubtless it\r\nsoon will be. In each case we showed the practical governmental\r\ngenius of our race by devising methods suitable to meet the actual\r\nexisting needs; not by insisting upon the application of some abstract\r\nshibboleth to all our new possessions alike, no matter how incongruous\r\nthis application might sometimes be.\r\n\r\nOver by far the major part of the territory, however, our people\r\nspread in such numbers during the course of the nineteenth century\r\nthat we were able to build up State after State, each with exactly the\r\nsame complete local independence in all matters affecting purely its\r\nown domestic interests as in any of the original thirteen States—each\r\nowing the same absolute fealty to the Union of all the States which\r\neach of the original thirteen States also owes—and finally each having\r\nthe same proportional right to its share in shaping and directing the\r\ncommon policy of the Union which is possessed by any other State,\r\nwhether of the original thirteen or not.\r\n\r\nThis process now seems to us part of the natural order of things, but\r\nit was wholly unknown until our own people devised it. It seems to us\r\na mere matter of course, a matter of elementary right and justice,\r\nthat in the deliberations of the national representative bodies the\r\nrepresentatives of a State which came into the Union but yesterday\r\nstand on a footing of exact and entire equality with those of the\r\nCommonwealths whose sons once signed the Declaration of Independence.\r\nBut this way of looking at the matter is purely modern, and in its\r\norigin purely American. When Washington during his Presidency saw new\r\nStates come into the Union on a footing of complete equality with the\r\nold, every European nation which had colonies still administered them\r\nas dependencies, and every other mother-country treated the colonist\r\nnot as a self-governing equal but as a subject.\r\n\r\nThe process which we began has since been followed by all the great\r\npeoples who were capable both of expansion and self-government, and\r\nnow the world accepts it as the natural process, as the rule; but\r\na century and a quarter ago it was not merely exceptional; it was\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the great historical significance of the movement of\r\ncontinental expansion in which the Louisiana Purchase was the most\r\nstriking single achievement. It stands out in marked relief even among\r\nthe feats of a nation of pioneers, a nation whose people have from\r\nthe beginning been picked out by process of natural selection from\r\namong the most enterprising individuals of the nations of western\r\nEurope. The acquisition of the territory is a credit to the broad\r\nand far-sighted statesmanship of the great statesmen to whom it was\r\nimmediately due, and above all to the aggressive and the masterful\r\ncharacter of the hardy pioneer folk to whose restless energy these\r\nstatesmen gave expression and direction, whom they followed rather\r\nthan led. The history of the land comprised within the limits of the\r\nPurchase is the epitome of the entire history of our people. Within\r\nthese limits we have gradually built up State after State until now\r\nthey many times surpass in wealth, in population, and in many-sided\r\ndevelopment, the original thirteen States as they were when their\r\ndelegates met in the Continental Congress. The people of these States\r\nhave shown themselves mighty in war with their fellow-man, and mighty\r\nin strength to tame the rugged wilderness. They could not thus have\r\nconquered the forest and the prairie, the mountain and the desert,\r\nhad they not possessed the great fighting virtues, the qualities\r\nwhich enable a people to overcome the forces of hostile men and\r\nhostile nature. On the other hand, they could not have used aright\r\ntheir conquest had they not in addition possessed the qualities of\r\nself-mastery and self-restraint, the power of acting in combination\r\nwith their fellows, the power of yielding obedience to the law and\r\nof building up an orderly civilization. Courage and hardihood are\r\nindispensable virtues in a people; but the people which possesses no\r\nothers can never rise high in the scale either of power or of culture.\r\nGreat peoples must have in addition the governmental capacity which\r\ncomes only when individuals fully recognize their duties to one\r\nanother and to the whole body politic, and are able to join together\r\nin feats of constructive statesmanship and of honest and effective\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThe old pioneer days are gone, with their roughness and their\r\nhardship, their incredible toil and their wild half-savage romance.\r\nBut the need for the pioneer virtues remains the same as ever. The\r\npeculiar frontier conditions have vanished; but the manliness and\r\nstalwart hardihood of the frontiersmen can be given even freer scope\r\nunder the conditions surrounding the complex industrialism of the\r\npresent day. In this great region acquired for our people under the\r\nPresidency of Jefferson, this region stretching from the Gulf to the\r\nCanadian border, from the Mississippi to the Rockies, the material and\r\nsocial progress has been so vast that alike for weal and for woe its\r\npeople now share the opportunities and bear the burdens common to the\r\nentire civilized world. The problems before us are fundamentally the\r\nsame east and west of the Mississippi, in the new States and in the\r\nold, and exactly the same qualities are required for their successful\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nWe meet here to-day to commemorate a great event, an event which marks\r\nan era in statesmanship no less than in pioneering. It is fitting that\r\nwe should pay our homage in words; but we must in honor make our words\r\ngood by deeds. We have every right to take a just pride in the great\r\ndeeds of our forefathers; but we show ourselves unworthy to be their\r\ndescendants if we make what they did an excuse for our lying supine\r\ninstead of an incentive to the effort to show ourselves by our acts\r\nworthy of them. In the administration of city, State, and Nation,\r\nin the management of our home life and the conduct of our business\r\nand social relations, we are bound to show certain high and fine\r\nqualities of character under penalty of seeing the whole heart of our\r\ncivilization eaten out while the body still lives.\r\n\r\nWe justly pride ourselves on our marvelous material prosperity, and\r\nsuch prosperity must exist in order to establish a foundation upon\r\nwhich a higher life can be built; but unless we do in very fact build\r\nthis higher life thereon, the material prosperity itself will go for\r\nbut very little. Now, in 1903, in the altered conditions, we must meet\r\nthe changed and changing problems with the spirit shown by the men who\r\nin 1803 and in the subsequent years gained, explored, conquered, and\r\nsettled this vast territory, then a desert, now filled with thriving\r\nand populous States.\r\n\r\nThe old days were great because the men who lived in them had mighty\r\nqualities; and we must make the new days great by showing these same\r\nqualities. We must insist upon courage and resolution, upon hardihood,\r\ntenacity, and fertility in resource; we must insist upon the strong,\r\nvirile virtues; and we must insist no less upon the virtues of\r\nself-restraint, self-mastery, regard for the rights of others; we must\r\nshow our abhorrence of cruelty, brutality, and corruption, in public\r\nand in private life alike. If we come short in any of these qualities\r\nwe shall measurably fail; and if, as I believe we surely shall, we\r\ndevelop these qualities in the future to an even greater degree than\r\nin the past, then in the century now beginning we shall make of this\r\nRepublic the freest and most orderly, the most just and most mighty,\r\nnation which has ever come forth from the womb of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT TOPEKA, KANSAS, MAY 1, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Colonel McCook, Gentlemen, and Ladies_:\r\n\r\nIt needed no urging to get me to accept your invitation. I hailed\r\nthe chance of speaking a few words to you on this occasion, because\r\nit seems to me that the railroad branch of the Young Men’s Christian\r\nAssociation exemplifies in practice just exactly what I like to\r\npreach; that is, the combination of efficiency with decent living and\r\nhigh ideals.\r\n\r\nIn our present advanced civilization we have to pay certain penalties\r\nfor what we have obtained. Among the penalties is the fact that in\r\nvery many occupations there is so little demand upon nerve, hardihood,\r\nand endurance, that there is a tendency to unhealthy softening of\r\nfibre and relaxation of fibre; and such being the case I think it is a\r\nfortunate thing for our people as a whole that there should be certain\r\noccupations, prominent among them railroading, in which the man has to\r\nshow the very qualities of courage, of hardihood, or willingness to\r\nface danger, the cultivation of the power of an instantaneous decision\r\nunder difficulties, and the other qualities which go to make up the\r\nvirile side of a man’s character—the qualities, Colonel McCook, which\r\nyou and those like you showed when as boys, as young men, they fought\r\nto a finish the great Civil War.\r\n\r\nSo much for the manliness, so much for the strength, so much for the\r\ncourage developed by your profession, all of which you show, and have\r\nto show, or you could not succeed in doing the work you are doing as\r\nyour life work. These qualities are all-important, but they are not\r\nall-sufficient. It is necessary absolutely to have them. No nation\r\ncan rise to greatness without them; but by them alone no nation will\r\never become great. Reading through the pages of history you come\r\nupon nation after nation in which there has been a high average of\r\nindividual strength, bravery, and hardihood, and yet in which there\r\nhas been nothing approaching to national greatness, because those\r\nqualities were not supplemented by others just as necessary. With the\r\ncourage, with the hardihood, with the strength, must come the power\r\nof self-restraint, the power of self-mastery, the capacity to work\r\nfor and with others as well as for one’s self, the power of giving to\r\nothers the love which each of us must bear for his neighbor, if we are\r\nto make our civilization really great. And these are the qualities\r\nwhich are fostered and developed, which are given full play, by\r\ninstitutions such as the Young Men’s Christian Association.\r\n\r\nThe other day in a little Lutheran church at Sioux Falls I listened\r\nto a most interesting and most stimulating sermon, which struck me\r\nparticularly because of the translation of a word which, I am ashamed\r\nto say, I had myself always before mistranslated. It was on the old\r\ntext of faith, hope, and charity. The sermon was delivered in German,\r\nand the word that the preacher used for charity was not charity, but\r\nlove; preaching that the greatest of all the forces with which we\r\ndeal for betterment is love. Looking it up I found, of course, what\r\nI ought to have known but did not, that the Greek word which we have\r\ntranslated into the word charity, should be more properly translated\r\nlove. That is, we use the word charity at present in a sense which\r\ndoes not make it correspond entirely to the word used in the original\r\nGreek. This Lutheran preacher developed in a very striking but very\r\nhappy fashion the absolute need of love in the broadest sense of the\r\nword, in order to make mankind even approximately perfect.\r\n\r\nWe need then the two qualities—the quality of which I first spoke to\r\nyou which has many shapes, the quality which rests upon courage, upon\r\nbodily and mental strength, upon will, upon daring, upon resolution,\r\nthe quality which makes a man work; and then we need the quality of\r\nwhich the preacher spoke when he spoke of love as being the great\r\nfactor, the ultimate factor, in bringing about the kind of human\r\nfellowship which will even approximately enable us to come up toward\r\nthe standard after which I think all of us with many shortcomings\r\nstrive. Work, the quality which makes a man ashamed not to be able to\r\npull his own weight, not to be able to do for himself as well as for\r\nothers without being beholden to any one for what he is doing. No man\r\nis happy if he does not work. Of all miserable creatures the idler, in\r\nwhatever rank of society, is in the long run the most miserable. If a\r\nman does not work, if he has not in him not merely the capacity for\r\nwork but the desire for work, then nothing can be done with him. He is\r\nout of place in our community. We have in our scheme of government no\r\nroom for the man who does not wish to pay his way through life by what\r\nhe does for himself and for the community. If he has leisure which\r\nmakes it unnecessary for him to devote his time to earning his daily\r\nbread, then all the more he is bound to work just as hard in some way\r\nthat will make the community the better off for his existence. If he\r\nfails in that, he fails to justify his existence. Work, the capacity\r\nfor work, is absolutely necessary; and no man’s life is full, no man\r\ncan be said to live in the true sense of the word, if he does not\r\nwork. This is necessary, and yet it is not enough. If a man is utterly\r\nselfish, if utterly disregardful of the rights of others, if he has no\r\nideals, if he works simply for the sake of ministering to his own base\r\npassions, if he works simply to gratify himself, small is his good in\r\nthe community. I think even then he is probably better off than if he\r\nis an idler, but he is of no real use unless together with the quality\r\nwhich enables him to work he has the quality which enables him to\r\nlove his fellows, to work with them and for them for the common good\r\nof all.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that these Young Men’s Christian Associations play a\r\npart of the greatest consequence, not merely because of the great\r\ngood they do in themselves, but because of the lesson of brotherhood\r\nthat they teach all of us. All of us here are knit together by bonds\r\nwhich we can not sever. For weal or for woe our fates are inextricably\r\nintermingled. All of us in our present civilization are dependent upon\r\none another to a degree never before known in the history of mankind,\r\nand in the long run we are going to go up or go down together. For a\r\nmoment some man may rise by trampling on his fellows; for a moment,\r\nand much more commonly, some men may think they will rise or gratify\r\ntheir envy and hatred by pulling down others. But any such movement\r\nupward is probably illusory, and is certainly short-lived. Any\r\npermanent movement upward must come in such a shape that all of us\r\nfeel the lift a little, and if there is a tendency down ward all of us\r\nwill feel that tendency, too. We must, if we are to raise ourselves,\r\nrealize that each of us in the long run can with certainty be raised\r\nonly if the conditions are such that all of us are somewhat raised. In\r\norder to bring about these conditions the first essential is that each\r\nshall have a genuine spirit of regard and friendship for the others,\r\nand that each of us shall try to look at the problems of life somewhat\r\nfrom his neighbor’s standpoint—that we shall have the capacity to\r\nunderstand one another’s position, one another’s needs, and also\r\nthe desire each to help his brother as well as to help himself. To\r\ndo that wisely, wisely to strive with that as the aim, is not very\r\neasy. Many qualities are needed in order that we can contribute our\r\nmite toward the upward movement of the world—among them the quality\r\nof self-abnegation, and yet combined with it the quality which will\r\nrefuse to submit to injustice. I want to preach the two qualities\r\ngoing hand in hand. I do not want a man to fail to try to strive\r\nfor his own betterment, I do not want him to be quick to yield to\r\ninjustice; I want him to stand for his rights; but I want him to be\r\nvery certain that he knows what his rights are, and that he does not\r\nmake them the wrongs of some one else.\r\n\r\nI have a great deal of faith in the average American citizen. I think\r\nhe is a pretty good fellow, and I think he can generally get on with\r\nthe other average American citizen if he will only know him. If he\r\ndoes not know him, but makes him a monster in his mind, then he will\r\nnot get on with him. But if he will take the trouble to know him and\r\nrealize that he is a being just like himself, with the same instincts,\r\nnot all of them good, the same desire to overcome those that are not\r\ngood, the same purposes, the same tendencies, the same shortcomings,\r\nthe same desires for good, the same need of striving against evil; if\r\nhe will realize all this, then if you can get the two together with\r\nan honest desire each to try not only to help himself but to help the\r\nother, most of our problems will be solved. And I can imagine no\r\nway more likely to hurry forward such a favorable solution than to\r\nencourage the building up of just such institutions as this.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I congratulate you with all my heart upon this meeting\r\nto-day. Therefore I esteem myself most fortunate in having the chance\r\nof addressing you. It is a very good thing to attend to the material\r\nside of life. We must in the first instance attend to our material\r\nprosperity. Unless we have that as a foundation we can not build up\r\nany higher kind of life. But we shall lead a miserable and sordid\r\nlife if we spend our whole time in doing nothing but attending to our\r\nmaterial needs. If the building up of the railroads, of the farms,\r\nof the factories, of the industrial centres, means nothing whatever\r\nbut an increase in the instruments of production and an increase in\r\nthe fevered haste with which those instruments are used, progress\r\namounts to but a little thing. If, however, the developing of our\r\nmaterial prosperity is to serve as a foundation upon which we raise\r\na higher, a purer, a fuller, a better life, then indeed things are\r\nwell with the Republic. If as our wealth increases the wisdom of\r\nour use of the wealth increases in even greater proportion, then\r\nthe wealth has justified its existence many times over. If with the\r\nindustry, the skill, the hardihood, of those whom I am addressing and\r\ntheir fellows, nothing comes beyond a selfish desire each to grasp\r\nfor himself whatever he can of material enjoyment, then the outlook\r\nfor the future is indeed grave, then the advantages of living in\r\nthe twentieth century surrounded by all our modern improvements, our\r\nmodern symbols of progress, is indeed small. But if we mean to make of\r\neach fresh development in the way of material betterment a step toward\r\na fresh development in moral and spiritual betterment, then we are to\r\nbe congratulated.\r\n\r\nTo me the future seems full of hope because, although there are many\r\nconflicting tendencies, and although some of these tendencies of our\r\npresent life are for evil, yet, on the whole the tendencies for good\r\nare in the ascendency. And I greet this audience, this great body of\r\ndelegates, with peculiar pleasure because they are men who embody, and\r\nembody by the very fact of their presence here, the two essential sets\r\nof qualities of which I have been speaking. They embody the capacity\r\nfor self-help with the desire mutually to help one the other. You\r\nhave several qualities I like. You have sound bodies. Your profession\r\nis not one that can be carried on, at least in some of its branches,\r\nwithout the sound body. You have sound minds, and that is better than\r\nsound bodies; and finally, the fact that you are here, the fact that\r\nyou have done what you have done, shows that you have that which\r\ncounts for more than body, for more than mind—character.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you upon what you are doing for yourselves, and I\r\ncongratulate you even more upon what you are doing for all men who\r\nhope to see the day brought nearer when the people of all nations,\r\nshall realize—not merely talk of, but realize—what the essence of\r\nbrotherhood is. I congratulate you, as I say, not only because you\r\nare bettering yourselves, but because to you, for your good fortune,\r\nit is given to better others, to teach, in the way in which teaching\r\nis most effective, not merely by precept but by action. The railroad\r\nmen of this country are a body entitled to the well wishes of their\r\nfellow-men in any event, but peculiarly is this true of the railroad\r\nmen of the country who join in such work as that of the Young Men’s\r\nChristian Associations, because they are showing by their actions—and\r\noh, how much louder actions speak than words!—that it is not only\r\npossible, but very, very possible and easy to combine the manliness\r\nwhich makes a man able to do his own share of the world’s work, with\r\nthat fine and lofty love of one’s fellow-men which makes you able to\r\ncome together with your fellows and work hand in hand with them for\r\nthe common good of mankind in general.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM ADDRESS AT DENVER, COL., MAY 4, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Governor, Mr. Mayor, and you, my Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nColorado has certain special interests which it shares with the group\r\nof States immediately around it. To my mind one of the best pieces of\r\nlegislation put upon the statute books of the National Government of\r\nrecent years was the irrigation act; an act under which we declare it\r\nto be the national policy that exactly as care is to be taken of the\r\nharbors and along the lower courses of the rivers, so in their upper\r\ncourses care is to be taken by the Nation of the irrigation work to be\r\ndone in connection with them.\r\n\r\nUnder that act a beginning has been made in Colorado, Montana,\r\nWyoming, Nevada, and the Territory of Arizona. There is bound to be\r\ndisappointment here and there where people have built hopes without a\r\nquite sufficient warranty of fact behind. But good will surely come\r\nat once and wellnigh immeasurable good in the future from the policy\r\nwhich has thus been begun. In Colorado two-thirds of your products\r\ncome from irrigated farms, and four years ago those products already\r\nsurpassed fifteen million dollars. With the aid of the government far\r\nmore can be done in the future even than has been done in the past.\r\nThe object of the law is to provide small irrigated farms to actual\r\nsettlers, to actual home-makers; the land is given away ultimately\r\nin small tracts under the terms of the homestead act, the settlers\r\nrepaying the cost of bringing water to their lands in ten annual\r\npayments; and lands now in private ownership can be watered in small\r\ntracts by similar payments, but the law forbids the furnishing of\r\nwater to large tracts, and the aim of the government is rigidly to\r\nprevent the acquisition of large rights for speculative purposes.\r\nThe purpose of the law was, and that purpose is being absolutely\r\ncarried out, to promote settlement and cultivation of small farms\r\ncarefully tilled. Water made available under the terms of this law\r\nbecomes appurtenant under the law to the land, and can not be disposed\r\nof without it, and thus monopoly and speculation in this vitally\r\nimportant commodity are prevented, or at least their evil effects\r\nminimized so far as the law or the administration of the law can bring\r\nthat end about. This is the great factor in future success. The policy\r\nis a policy of encouragement to the home-maker, to the man who comes\r\nto establish his home, to bring up his children here as a citizen of\r\nthe commonwealth, and his welfare is guarded by the union of the water\r\nand the land.\r\n\r\nThe government can not deal with large numbers individually. We\r\nhave encouraged the formation of associations of water users, of\r\ncultivators of the soil in small tracts. The ultimate ownership and\r\ncontrol of the irrigation works will pass away from the government\r\ninto the hands of those users, those home-makers, who through their\r\nofficers do the necessary business of their associations. The\r\naim of the government is to give locally the ultimate control of\r\nwater distributed and to leave neighborhood disputes to be settled\r\nlocally; and that should be so as far as it is possible. The law\r\nprotects vested rights; it prevents conflict with established laws\r\nor institutions; but of course it is important that the legislatures\r\nof the States should co-operate with the National Government. When\r\nthe works are constructed to utilize the waters now wasted happy\r\nand prosperous homes will flourish where twenty years ago it would\r\nhave seemed impossible that a man could live. It is a great national\r\nmeasure of benefit, and while, as I say, it is primarily to benefit\r\nthe people of the mountain States and of the great plains, yet it will\r\nultimately benefit the whole community. For, my fellow-countrymen,\r\nyou can never afford to forget for one moment that in the long\r\nrun anything that is of benefit to one part of our Republic is of\r\nnecessity of benefit to all the Republic. The creation of new homes\r\nupon desert lands means greater prosperity for Colorado and the Rocky\r\nMountain States, and inevitably their greater prosperity means greater\r\nprosperity for Eastern manufacturers, for Southern cotton growers, for\r\nall our people throughout the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO, MAY 5, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Governor, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nIt is of course with a peculiar feeling of pleasure that I come here\r\nto New Mexico, from which Territory half (and if my memory serves me\r\ncorrectly a little over half) of the men of my regiment came. The man\r\nis but a poor man wherever he may be born to whom one part of this\r\ncountry is not exactly as dear as any other part. And I should count\r\nmyself wholly unworthy of the position I hold if I did not strive to\r\nrepresent the people of the mountains and the plains exactly as much\r\nas those of the Mississippi Valley or of either coast, the Atlantic\r\nor the Pacific. I know your people, Mr. Governor, and I need not say\r\nhow fond I am of them, for that you know yourself. How could I help\r\nbeing fond of people with whom I have worked, with whom I marched to\r\nbattle? The only men here to whom I would doff my hat quicker than to\r\nthe men of my own regiment are the men of the great war. You know well\r\nthe claim that comradeship in war makes between man and man; and it\r\nhas always seemed to me, Mr. Governor, that in a sense my regiment in\r\nits composition was a typical American regiment. Its people came from\r\nthe West chiefly, but some from the East, from the South chiefly, but\r\nsome from the North, so that every section was represented in it. They\r\nvaried in birthplace as in creed; some were born on this side of the\r\nwater, some on the other side; some of their ancestors had come to New\r\nMexico, as did your ancestors, Mr. Governor, when this was already a\r\ncity and at a time when not one English-speaking community existed on\r\nthe Atlantic seaboard; some were men whose forefathers were among the\r\nearly Puritans and Pilgrims; some were of those whose forefathers had\r\nsettled by the banks of the James even before the Puritan and Pilgrim\r\ncame to this country, but after your people came. There were men in\r\nthat regiment who themselves were born, or whose parents were born, in\r\nEngland, Ireland, Germany, or Scandinavia, but there was not a man,\r\nno matter what his creed, what his birthplace, what his ancestry, who\r\nwas not an American and nothing else. We had representatives of the\r\nreal, original, native Americans, because we had no inconsiderable\r\nnumber who were in whole or in part of Indian blood. There was in the\r\nregiment but one kind of rivalry among those men, and but one would\r\nhave been tolerated. That was the rivalry of each man to see if he\r\ncould not do his duty a little better than any one else. Short would\r\nhave been the shrift of any man who tried to introduce division along\r\nlines of section, or creed, or class. We had serving in the ranks\r\nmen of inherited wealth and men who all their lives had earned each\r\nday’s bread by that day’s labor, and they stood on a footing of exact\r\nequality. It would not have been any more possible for a feeling of\r\narrogance to exist on one side than for a feeling of rancor and envy\r\nto exist on the other.\r\n\r\nI appreciate to the full all the difficulties under which you labor,\r\nand I think that your progress has been astonishing. I congratulate\r\nyou upon all that has been done, and I am certain that the future will\r\nfar more than make good the past. I believe that we have come upon\r\nan era of fuller development for New Mexico. That development must\r\nof course take place principally through the average of foresight,\r\nthrift, industry, energy and will of the citizens of New Mexico; but\r\nthe government can and will help somewhat. This is a great grazing\r\nState. Because of the importance of the grazing industry I wish to\r\nbespeak your support for the preservation in proper shape of the\r\nforest reserves of the State. These forest reserves are created\r\nand are kept up in the interest of the home-maker. In many of them\r\nthere is much natural pasturage. Where that is the case the object\r\nis to have that pasturage used by the settlers, by the people of the\r\nTerritory, not eaten out so that nobody will have the benefit after\r\nthree years. I want the land preserved so that the pasturage will do,\r\nnot merely for a man who wants to make a good thing out of it for two\r\nor three years, but for the man who wishes to see it preserved for the\r\nuse of his children and his children’s children. That is the way to\r\nuse the resources of the land. I build no small hope upon the aid that\r\nunder the wise law of Congress will ultimately be extended to this\r\nas to other States and Territories in the way of governmental aid to\r\nirrigation. Irrigation is of course to be in the future wellnigh the\r\nmost potent factor in the agricultural development of this Territory\r\nand one of the factors which will do most toward bringing it up to\r\nStatehood. Nothing will count more than development of that kind in\r\nbringing the Territory in as a State. That is the kind of development\r\nwhich I am most anxious to see here—the development that means\r\npermanent growth in the capacity of the land, not temporary, not the\r\nexploiting of the land for a year or two at the cost of its future\r\nimpoverishment, but the building up of farm and ranch in such shape as\r\nto benefit the home-maker whose intention it is that this Territory of\r\nthe present, this State of the future, shall be a great State in the\r\nAmerican Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE CATHOLIC SCHOOL, ALBUQUERQUE, N. M., MAY 5, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Bishop_:\r\n\r\nPermit me to thank you and to say how much I appreciate the courtesy\r\nyou showed in putting yourself to such inconvenience to come here to\r\ngreet me. I had hoped to meet you at Santa Fe in the cathedral, where\r\nI participated in the baptism of the son of one of the men of my\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\nI greet the school children and the sisters. There can be no greater\r\nprivilege than to meet a missionary who has done good work. Of all the\r\nwork that is done or that can be done for our country, the greatest\r\nis that of educating the body, the mind, and above all the character,\r\ngiving spiritual and moral training to those who in a few years are\r\nthemselves to decide the destinies of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE INDIAN SCHOOL, ALBUQUERQUE, N. M., MAY 5, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Superintendent_:\r\n\r\nI wish to express the peculiar pleasure it is to have seen the\r\nIndian schools to-day, and through you, Mr. Superintendent, I want\r\nto say to the Indians that are right behind you, what a fine thing\r\nit is to see the industry and thrift of their people. I was struck\r\nby their orchards, the irrigated fields, and by seeing them working\r\nin the fields and along the road. The Indian who will work and do\r\nhis duty will stand on a par with any other American citizen. Of\r\ncourse I will do as every President must do, I will stand for his\r\nrights with the same jealous eagerness that I would for the rights of\r\nany white man. I am glad to see the Indian children being educated\r\nas these are educated so as to come more and more into the body of\r\nAmerican citizenship, to fit themselves for work in the home, work in\r\nthe fields, for leading decent, clean lives, for making themselves\r\nself-supporting, for being good providers and good housekeepers; in\r\nother words, for becoming American citizens just like other American\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT GRAND CANYON, ARIZONA, MAY 6, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Governor, and you, my Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nI am glad to be in Arizona to-day. From Arizona many gallant men came\r\ninto the regiment which I had the honor to command. Arizona sent men\r\nwho won glory on fought fields, and men to whom came a glorious and\r\nan honorable death fighting for the flag of their country. As long\r\nas I live it will be to me an inspiration to have served with Bucky\r\nO’Neill. I have met so many comrades whom I prize, for whom I feel\r\nrespect and admiration and affection, that I shall not particularize\r\namong them except to say that there is none for whom I feel all of\r\nrespect and admiration and affection more than for your Governor.\r\n\r\nI have never been in Arizona before. It is one of the regions from\r\nwhich I expect most development through the wise action of the\r\nNational Congress in passing the irrigation act. The first and\r\nbiggest experiment now in view under that act is the one that we are\r\ntrying in Arizona. I look forward to the effects of irrigation partly\r\nas applied by and through the government, still more as applied by\r\nindividuals, and especially by associations of individuals, profiting\r\nby the example of the government, and possibly by help from it—I look\r\nforward to the effects of irrigation as being of greater consequence\r\nto all this region of country in the next fifty years than any other\r\nmaterial movement whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIn the Grand Canyon, Arizona has a natural wonder which, so far as I\r\nknow, is in kind absolutely unparalleled throughout the rest of the\r\nworld. I want to ask you to do one thing in connection with it in your\r\nown interest and in the interest of the country—to keep this great\r\nwonder of nature as it now is. I was delighted to learn of the wisdom\r\nof the Santa Fe railroad people in deciding not to build their hotel\r\non the brink of the canyon. I hope you will not have a building of\r\nany kind, not a summer cottage, a hotel, or anything else, to mar the\r\nwonderful grandeur, the sublimity, the great loneliness and beauty of\r\nthe canyon. Leave it as it is. You can not improve on it. The ages\r\nhave been at work on it, and man can only mar it. What you can do is\r\nto keep it for your children, your children’s children, and for all\r\nwho come after you, as one of the great sights which every American\r\nif he can travel at all should see. We have gotten past the stage,\r\nmy fellow-citizens, when we are to be pardoned if we treat any part\r\nof our country as something to be skinned for two or three years for\r\nthe use of the present generation, whether it is the forest, the\r\nwater, the scenery. Whatever it is, handle it so that your children’s\r\nchildren will get the benefit of it. If you deal with irrigation,\r\napply it under circumstances that will make it of benefit, not to\r\nthe speculator who hopes to get profit out of it for two or three\r\nyears, but handle it so that it will be of use to the home-maker, to\r\nthe man who comes to live here, and to have his children stay after\r\nhim. Keep the forests in the same way. Preserve the forests by use;\r\npreserve them for the ranchman and the stockman, for the people of the\r\nTerritory, for the people of the region round about. Preserve them for\r\nthat use, but use them so that they will not be squandered, that they\r\nwill not be wasted, so that they will be of benefit to the Arizona of\r\n1953 as well as the Arizona of 1903.\r\n\r\nTo the Indians here I want to say a word of welcome. In my regiment I\r\nhad a good many Indians. They were good enough to fight and to die,\r\nand they are good enough to have me treat them exactly as squarely as\r\nany white man. There are many problems in connection with them. We\r\nmust save them from corruption and from brutality; and I regret to say\r\nthat at times we must save them from unregulated Eastern philanthropy.\r\nAll I ask is a square deal for every man. Give him a fair chance. Do\r\nnot let him wrong any one, and do not let him be wronged.\r\n\r\nI believe in you. I am glad to see you. I wish you well with all my\r\nheart, and I know that your future will justify all the hopes we have.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT BARSTOW, CALIFORNIA, MAY 7, 1903\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nThis is the first time I have ever been to California, and I can not\r\nsay to you how much I have looked forward to making the trip. I can\r\ntell you now with absolute certainty that I will have enjoyed it to\r\nthe full when I get through.\r\n\r\nI have felt that the events of the last five or six years have been\r\nsteadily hastening the day when the Pacific will loom in the world’s\r\ncommerce as the Atlantic now looms, and I have wished greatly to see\r\nthese marvelous communities growing up on the Pacific Slope. There are\r\nplenty of things that to you seem matters of course, that I have read\r\nabout and know about from reading, and yet when I see them they strike\r\nme as very wonderful.\r\n\r\nOne thing that impresses me more than anything else as I go through\r\nthe country—as I said I have never been on the Pacific Slope; the\r\nRocky Mountain States and the States of the great plains I know quite\r\nas well as I know the Eastern seaboard; I have worked with the men,\r\nplayed with them, fought with them; I know them all through—the thing\r\nthat impresses me most as I go through this country and meet the men\r\nand women of the country, is the essential unity of all Americans.\r\nDown at bottom we are the same people all through. That is not merely\r\na unity of section, it is a unity of class. For my good fortune I\r\nhave been thrown into intimate relationship, into intimate personal\r\nfriendship, with many men of many different occupations, and my faith\r\nis firm that we shall come unscathed out of all our difficulties here\r\nin America, because I think that the average American is a decent\r\nfellow, and that the prime thing in getting him to get on well with\r\nthe other average American is to have each remember that the other is\r\na decent fellow, and try to look at the problems a little from the\r\nother’s standpoint.\r\n\r\nI thank you for coming out here to greet me. I wish you well with all\r\nmy heart for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT SAN BERNARDINO, CAL., MAY 7, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman, Mr. Governor, and you, my Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nIt is half a century since the early pioneers founded this place, and\r\nwhile time goes fast in America anywhere, it has gone fastest here on\r\nthe Pacific Slope and in the regions of the Rocky Mountains directly\r\nto the eastward. If you live in the presence of miracles you gradually\r\nget accustomed to them. So it is difficult for any of us, and it is\r\nespecially difficult for those who have themselves been doing the\r\nthings, to realize the absolute wonder of the things that have been\r\ndone. California and the region round about have in the past fifty or\r\nsixty years traversed the distance that separates the founders of\r\nthe civilization of Mesopotamia and Egypt from those who enjoy the\r\ncivilization of to-day. They have gone further than that. They have\r\nseen this country change from a wilderness into one of the most highly\r\ncivilized regions of the world’s surface. They have seen cities,\r\nfarms, ranches, railroads grow up and transform the very face of\r\nnature. The changes have been so stupendous that in our eyes they have\r\nbecome commonplace. We fail to realize their immense, their tremendous\r\nimportance. We fail entirely to realize what they mean. Only the older\r\namong you can remember the early pioneer days, and yet to-day I have\r\nspoken to man after man yet in his prime who, when he first came to\r\nthis country warred against wild man and wild nature in the way in\r\nwhich that warfare was waged in the prehistoric days of the old world.\r\nWe have spanned in a single lifetime—in less than the lifetime of any\r\nman who reaches the age limit prescribed by the psalmist—the whole\r\nspace from savagery through barbarism, through semi-civilization, to\r\nthe civilization that stands two thousand years ahead of that of Rome\r\nand Greece in the days of their prime.\r\n\r\nThe old pioneer days have gone, but if we are to prove ourselves\r\nworthy sons of our sires we can not afford to let the old pioneer\r\nvirtues lapse. There is just the same need now that there was in\r\n’49 for the qualities that mark a mighty and masterful people. East\r\nand west we now face substantially the same problems. No people can\r\nadvance as far and as fast as we have advanced, no people can make\r\nsuch progress as we have made, and expect to escape the penalties that\r\ngo with such speed and progress. The growth and complexity of our\r\ncivilization, the intensity of the movement of modern life, have meant\r\nthat with the benefits have come certain disadvantages and certain\r\nperils. A great industrial civilization can not be built up without a\r\ncertain dislocation, a certain disarrangement of the old conditions,\r\nand therefore the springing up of new problems. The problems are new,\r\nbut the qualities needed to solve them are as old as history itself,\r\nand we shall solve them aright only on condition that we bring to the\r\nsolution the same qualities of head and heart that have been brought\r\nto the solution of similar problems by every race that has ever\r\nconquered for itself a space in the annals of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE BIG TREE GROVE, SANTA CRUZ, CAL., MAY 11, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nI want to thank you very much for your courtesy in receiving me, and\r\nto say how much I have enjoyed being here. This is the first glimpse\r\nI have ever had of the big trees, and I wish to pay the highest\r\ntribute I can to the State of California, to those private citizens\r\nand associations of citizens who have co-operated with the State in\r\npreserving these wonderful trees for the whole nation, in preserving\r\nthem in whatever part of the State they may be found. All of us ought\r\nto want to see nature preserved. Take a big tree whose architect has\r\nbeen the ages—anything that man does toward it may hurt it and can not\r\nhelp it. Above all, the rash creature who wishes to leave his name\r\nto mar the beauties of nature should be sternly discouraged. Those\r\ncards pinned up on that tree give an air of the ridiculous to this\r\nsolemn and majestic grove. To pin those cards up there is as much\r\nout of place as if you tacked so many tin cans up there. I mean that\r\nliterally. You should save the people whose names are there from the\r\nreprobation of every one by taking down the cards at the earliest\r\npossible moment; and do keep these trees, keep all the wonderful\r\nscenery of this wonderful State unmarred by the vandalism or the folly\r\nof man. Remember that we have to contend not merely with knavery, but\r\nwith folly; and see to it that you by your actions create the kind\r\nof public opinion which will put a stop to any destruction of or any\r\nmarring of the wonderful and beautiful gifts that you have received\r\nfrom nature, that you ought to hand on as a precious heritage to your\r\nchildren and your children’s children.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR UNIVERSITY, PALO ALTO, CAL., MAY 12, 1903\r\n\r\n  _President Jordan, and you, my Fellow-Citizens, and especially you,\r\n  my Fellow-college Men and Women_:\r\n\r\nI thank you for your greeting, and I know you will not grudge my\r\nsaying, first of all, a special word of thanks to the men of the Grand\r\nArmy. It is a fine thing to have before a body of students men who by\r\ntheir practice have rendered it unnecessary that they should preach;\r\nfor what we have to teach by precept, you, the men of ’61 to ’65,\r\nhave taught by deed, by action. I am proud as an American college man\r\nmyself to have seen the tablet outside within the court which shows\r\nthat this young university sent eighty-five of her sons to war when\r\nthe country called for them. I come from a college which boasts as its\r\nproudest building that which stands to the memory of Harvard’s sons\r\nwho responded to the call of Lincoln when the hour of the Nation’s\r\ndanger was at hand. It will be a bad day for this country and a worse\r\nday for all educative institutions in this country if ever such a call\r\nis made, and the men of college training do not feel it peculiarly\r\nincumbent upon them to respond.\r\n\r\nPresident Jordan has been kind enough to allude to me as an old\r\nfriend. Mr. Jordan is too modest to say that he has long been not\r\nonly a friend, but a man to whom I have turned for advice and help,\r\nbefore and since I became President. I am glad to have the chance of\r\nacknowledging my obligations to him, and I am also glad that when I\r\nask you to strive toward productive scholarship, toward productive\r\ncitizenship, I can use the president of the university as an example.\r\nOf course, in any of our American institutions of learning, even more\r\nimportant than the production of scholarship is the production of\r\ncitizenship. That is the most important thing that any institution\r\nof learning can produce. There are a great number of students who\r\ncan not and should not try, in after life, to lead a career of\r\nscholarship, but no university can take high rank if it does not aim\r\nat the production of, and succeed in producing, a certain number of\r\ndeep and thorough scholars—not scholars whose scholarship is of the\r\nbarren kind, but men of productive scholarship, men who do good work,\r\nI trust great work, in the fields of literature, of art, of science,\r\nin all their manifold activities. Here in California this Nation,\r\ncomposite in its race stocks, speaking an Old World tongue, and with\r\nan inherited Old World culture, has acquired an absolutely new domain.\r\nI do not mean new only in the sense of additional territory like that\r\nalready possessed, I mean new in the sense of new surroundings, to\r\nuse the scientific phrase, of a new environment. Being new, I think\r\nwe have a right to look for a substantial achievement on the part\r\nof your people along new lines. I do not mean the self-conscious\r\nstriving after newness, which is only too apt to breed eccentricity,\r\nbut I mean that those among you whose bent is toward scholarship as\r\na career should keep in mind the fact that such scholarship should\r\nbe productive, and should therefore aim at giving to the world some\r\naddition to the world’s stock of what is useful or beautiful; and if\r\nyou work simply and naturally, taking advantage of your surroundings\r\nas you find them, then in my belief a new mark will be made in\r\nthe history of intellectual achievement by our race. You of this\r\ninstitution are blessed in its extraordinary physical beauty and\r\nappropriateness of architecture and surroundings, with a suggestion of\r\nwhat I might call the Americanized Greek. Such is your institution,\r\nsituated on the shores of this great ocean, built by a race which\r\nhas come steadily westward, which has come to where the Occident\r\nlooks west to the Orient, a race whose members here, fresh, vigorous,\r\nhave the boundless possibilities of the future brought to their very\r\ndoors in a sense that can not be possible for the members of the race\r\nsituated further east. Surely there will be some great outcome in the\r\nway not merely of physical, but of moral and intellectual work worth\r\ndoing. I do not want you to turn out prigs; I do not want you to turn\r\nout the self-conscious. I believe, with all my heart, in play. I want\r\nyou to play hard without encroaching on your work. I do, nevertheless,\r\nthink you ought to have at least the consciousness of the serious side\r\nof what all this means, and of the necessity of effort, thrust upon\r\nyou, so that you may justify by your deeds in the future your training\r\nand the extraordinary advantages under which that training has been\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nAmerica, the Republic of the United States, is of course in a\r\npeculiar sense typical of the present age. We represent the fullest\r\ndevelopment of the democratic spirit acting on the extraordinary\r\nand highly complex industrial growth of the last half century. It\r\nbehooves us to justify by our acts the claims made for that political\r\nand economic progress. We will never justify the existence of the\r\nRepublic by merely talking each Fourth of July about what the Republic\r\nhas done. If our homage is lip loyalty merely, the great deeds of\r\nthose who went before us, the great deeds of the times of Washington\r\nand of the times of Lincoln, the great deeds of the men who won the\r\nRevolution and founded the Nation, and of the men who preserved\r\nit, who made it a Union and a free Republic, will simply arise to\r\nshame us. We can honor our fathers and our fathers’ fathers only by\r\nourselves striving to rise level to their standard. There are plenty\r\nof tendencies for evil in what we see round about us. Thank heaven,\r\nthere are an even greater number of tendencies for good, and one of\r\nthe things, Mr. Jordan, which it seems to me give this Nation cause\r\nfor hope is the national standard of ambition which makes it possible\r\nto recognize with admiration and regard such work as the founding of\r\na university of this character. It speaks well for our Nation that\r\nmen and women should desire during their lives to devote the fortunes\r\nwhich they were able to acquire or to inherit because of our system\r\nof government, because of our social system, to objects so entirely\r\nworthy and so entirely admirable as the foundation of a great seat\r\nof learning such as this. All that we outsiders can do is to pay our\r\ntribute of respect to the dead and to the living who have done such\r\ngood, and at least to make it evident that we appreciate to the full\r\nwhat has been done.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of scholarship; I want to go back to the question of\r\ncitizenship, a question affecting not merely the scholars among you,\r\nnot merely those who are hereafter to lead lives devoted to science,\r\nto art, to productivity in literature. And when you take up science,\r\nart, and literature, remember that one first-class bit of work is\r\nbetter than one thousand fairly good bits of work; that as the years\r\nroll on the man or the woman who has been able to make a masterpiece\r\nwith the pen, the brush, the pencil, in any way, has rendered a\r\nservice to the country such as not all his or her compeers who merely\r\ndo fairly good second-rate work can ever accomplish. Only a limited\r\nnumber of us can ever become scholars or work successfully along the\r\nlines I have spoken of, but we can all be good citizens. We can all\r\nlead a life of action, a life of endeavor, a life that is to be judged\r\nprimarily by the effort, somewhat by the result, along the lines of\r\nhelping the growth of what is right and decent and generous and lofty\r\nin our several communities, in the State, in the Nation.\r\n\r\nYou men and women who have had the advantages of a college training\r\nare not to be excused if you fail to do, not as well as, but more than\r\nthe average man outside who has not had your advantages. Every now and\r\nthen I meet (at least I meet him in the East, and I dare say he is to\r\nbe found here) the man who, having gone through college, feels that\r\nsomehow that confers upon him a special distinction which relieves\r\nhim from the necessity of showing himself as good as his fellows.\r\nI see you recognize the type. That man is not only a curse to the\r\ncommunity, and incidentally to himself, but he is a curse to the cause\r\nof academic education, the college and university training, because by\r\nhis existence he serves as an excuse for those who like to denounce\r\nsuch education. Your education, your training, will not confer on you\r\none privilege in the way of excusing you from effort or from work.\r\nAll it can do and what it should do, is to make you a little better\r\nfitted for such effort, for such work; and I do not care whether that\r\nis in business, politics, in no matter what branch of endeavor, all\r\nit can do is by the training you have received, by the advantages you\r\nhave received, to fit you to do a little better than the average man\r\nthat you meet. It is incumbent upon you to show that the training\r\nhas had that effect. It ought to enable you to do a little better\r\nfor yourselves, and if you have in you souls capable of a thrill of\r\ngenerous emotion, souls capable of understanding what you owe to your\r\ntraining, to your alma mater, to the past and the present that have\r\ngiven you all that you have—if you have such souls, it ought to make\r\nyou doubly bent upon disinterested work for the State and the Nation.\r\n\r\nSuch work can be done along many different lines. I want to-day,\r\nhere in California, to make a special appeal to all of you, and to\r\nCalifornia as a whole, for work along a certain line—the line of\r\npreserving your great natural advantages alike from the standpoint\r\nof use and from the standpoint of beauty. If the students of this\r\ninstitution have not by the mere fact of their surroundings learned\r\nto appreciate beauty, then the fault is in you and not in the\r\nsurroundings. Here in California you have some of the great wonders\r\nof the world. You have a singularly beautiful landscape, singularly\r\nbeautiful and singularly majestic scenery, and it should certainly be\r\nyour aim to try to preserve for those who are to come after you that\r\nbeauty, to try to keep unmarred that majesty. Closely entwined with\r\nkeeping unmarred the beauty of your scenery, of your great natural\r\nattractions, is the question of making use of, not for the moment\r\nmerely, but for future time, of your great natural products. Yesterday\r\nI saw for the first time a grove of your great trees, a grove which\r\nit has taken the ages several thousands of years to build up; and\r\nI feel most emphatically that we should not turn into shingles a\r\ntree which was old when the first Egyptian conqueror penetrated to\r\nthe valley of the Euphrates, which it has taken so many thousands\r\nof years to build up, and which can be put to better use. That, you\r\nmay say, is not looking at the matter from the practical standpoint.\r\nThere is nothing more practical in the end than the preservation\r\nof beauty, than the preservation of anything that appeals to the\r\nhigher emotions in mankind. But, furthermore, I appeal to you from\r\nthe standpoint of use. A few big trees, of unusual size and beauty,\r\nshould be preserved for their own sake; but the forests as a whole\r\nshould be used for business purposes, only they should be used in a\r\nway that will preserve them as permanent sources of national wealth.\r\nIn many parts of California the whole future welfare of the State\r\ndepends upon the way in which you are able to use your water supply;\r\nand the preservation of the forests and the preservation of the use\r\nof the water are inseparably connected. I believe we are past the\r\nstage of national existence when we could look on complacently at the\r\nindividual who skinned the land and was content for the sake of three\r\nyears’ profit for himself to leave a desert for the children of those\r\nwho were to inherit the soil. I think we have passed that stage. We\r\nshould handle, and I think we now do handle, all problems such as\r\nthose of forestry and of the preservation and use of our waters from\r\nthe standpoint of the permanent interests of the home-maker in any\r\nregion—the man who comes in not to take what he can out of the soil\r\nand leave, having exploited the country, but who comes to dwell\r\ntherein, to bring up his children, and to leave them a heritage in\r\nthe country not merely unimpaired, but if possible even improved.\r\nThat is the sensible view of civic obligation, and the policy of the\r\nState and of the Nation should be shaped in that direction. It should\r\nbe shaped in the interest of the home-maker, the actual resident,\r\nthe man who is not only to be benefited himself, but whose children\r\nand children’s children are to be benefited by what he has done.\r\nCalifornia has for years, I am happy to say, taken a more sensible,\r\na more intelligent interest in forest preservation than any other\r\nState. It early appointed a forest commission; later on some of the\r\nfunctions of that commission were replaced by the Sierra Club, a club\r\nwhich has done much on the Pacific Coast to perpetuate the spirit\r\nof the explorer and the pioneer. Then I am happy to say a great\r\nbusiness interest showed an intelligent and far-sighted spirit which\r\nis of happy augury, for the Redwood Manufacturers of San Francisco\r\nwere first among lumbermen’s associations to give assistance to the\r\ncause of practical forestry. The study of the redwood which the\r\naction of this association made possible was the pioneer study in the\r\nco-operative work which is now being carried out between lumbermen\r\nall over the United States and the Federal Bureau of Forestry. All of\r\nthis kind of work is peculiarly the kind of work in which we have a\r\nright to expect not merely hearty co-operation from, but leadership in\r\ncollege men trained in the universities of this Pacific Coast State;\r\nfor the forests of this State stand alone in the world. There are\r\nnone others like them anywhere. There are no other trees anywhere like\r\nthe giant Sequoias; nowhere else is there a more beautiful forest than\r\nthat which clothes the western slope of the Sierra. Very early your\r\nforests attracted lumbermen from other States, and by the course of\r\ntimber land investments some of the best of the big tree groves were\r\nthreatened with destruction. Destruction came upon some of them, but\r\nthe women of California rose to the emergency through the California\r\nClub, and later the Sempervirens Club took vigorous action. But the\r\nCalaveras grove is not yet safe, and there should be no rest until\r\nthat safety is secured, by the action of private individuals, by the\r\naction of the State, by the action of the Nation. The interest of\r\nCalifornia in forest protection was shown even more effectively by the\r\npurchase of the Big Basin Redwood Park, a superb forest property the\r\npossession of which should be a source of just pride to all citizens\r\njealous of California’s good name.\r\n\r\nI appeal to you, as I say, to protect these mighty trees, these\r\nwonderful monuments of beauty. I appeal to you to protect them for\r\nthe sake of their beauty, but I also make the appeal just as strongly\r\non economic grounds; as I am well aware that in dealing with such\r\nquestions a far-sighted economic policy must be that to which alone\r\nin the long run one can safely appeal. The interests of California\r\nin forests depend directly of course upon the handling of her wood\r\nand water supplies and the supply of material from the lumber woods\r\nand the production of agricultural products on irrigated farms. The\r\ngreat valleys which stretch through the State between the Sierra\r\nNevada and Coast Ranges must owe their future development as they owe\r\ntheir present prosperity to irrigation. Whatever tends to destroy\r\nthe water supply of the Sacramento, the San Gabriel, and the other\r\nvalleys strikes vitally at the welfare of California. The welfare of\r\nCalifornia depends in no small measure upon the preservation of water\r\nfor the purposes of irrigation in those beautiful and fertile valleys\r\nwhich can not grow crops by rainfall alone. The forest cover upon the\r\ndrainage basins of streams used for irrigation purposes is of prime\r\nimportance to the interests of the entire State. Now keep in mind\r\nthat the whole object of forest protection is, as I have said again\r\nand again, the making and maintaining of prosperous homes. I am not\r\nadvocating forest protection from the æsthetic standpoint only. I do\r\nadvocate the keeping of big trees, the great monarchs of the woods,\r\nfor the sake of their beauty, but I advocate the preservation and\r\nwise use of the forests because I feel it essential to the interests\r\nof the actual settlers. I am asking that the forests be used wisely\r\nfor the sake of the successors of the pioneers, for the sake of the\r\nsettlers who dwell on the land and by doing so extend the borders\r\nof our civilization. I ask it for the sake of the man who makes his\r\nfarm in the woods, or lower down along the sides of the streams which\r\nhave their rise in the mountains. Every phase of the land policy of\r\nthe United States is, as it by right ought to be, directed to the\r\nupbuilding of the home-maker. The one sure test of all public land\r\nlegislation should be: does it help to make and to keep prosperous\r\nhomes? If it does, the legislation is good. If it does not, the\r\nlegislation is bad. Any legislation which has a tendency to give\r\nland in large tracts to people who will lease it out to tenants is\r\nundesirable. We do not want ever to let our land policy be shaped so\r\nas to create a big class of proprietors who rent to others. We want\r\nto make the smaller men who, under such conditions would rent, actual\r\nproprietors. We must shape our policy so that these men themselves\r\nshall be the land owners, the makers of homes, the keepers of homes.\r\n\r\nCertain of our land laws, however beneficent their purposes, have been\r\ntwisted into an improper use, so that there have grown up abuses under\r\nthem by which they tend to create a class of men who, under one color\r\nand another, obtain large tracts of soil for speculative purposes, or\r\nto rent out to others; and there should be now a thorough scrutiny\r\nof our land laws with the object of so amending them as to do away\r\nwith the possibility of such abuses. If it was not for the national\r\nirrigation act we would be about past the time when Uncle Sam could\r\ngive every man a farm. Comparatively little of our land is left which\r\nis adapted to farming without irrigation. The home-maker on the public\r\nland must hereafter, in the great majority of cases, have water for\r\nirrigation, or the making of his home will fail. Let us keep that\r\nfact before our minds. Do not misunderstand me when I have spoken\r\nof the defects of our land laws. Our land laws have served a noble\r\npurpose in the past and have become the models for other governments.\r\nThe homestead law has been a notable instrument for good. To establish\r\na family permanently upon a quarter section of land, or of course upon\r\na less quantity if it is irrigated land, is the best use to which it\r\ncan be put. The first need of any nation is intelligent and honest\r\ncitizens. Such can come only from honest and intelligent homes, and to\r\nget the good citizenship we must get the good homes. It is absolutely\r\nnecessary that the remainder of our public land should be reserved for\r\nthe home-maker, and it is necessary in my judgment that there should\r\nbe a revision of the land laws and a cutting out of such provisions\r\nfrom them as in actual practice under present conditions tend to make\r\npossible the acquisition of large tracts for speculative purposes or\r\nfor the purpose of leasing to others.\r\n\r\nCitizenship is the prime test in the welfare of the Nation; but we\r\nneed good laws; and above all we need good land laws throughout the\r\nWest. We want to see the free farmer own his home. The best of the\r\npublic lands are already in private hands, and yet the rate of their\r\ndisposal is steadily increasing. More than six million acres were\r\npatented during the first three months of the present year. It is\r\ntime for us to see that our remaining public lands are saved for\r\nthe home-maker to the utmost limit of his possible use. I say this\r\nto you of this university because we have a right to expect that\r\nthe best trained, the best educated men on the Pacific Slope, the\r\nRocky Mountains and great plains States will take the lead in the\r\npreservation and right use of the forests, in securing the right use\r\nof the waters, and in seeing to it that our land policy is not twisted\r\nfrom its original purpose, but is perpetuated by amendment, by change\r\nwhen such change is necessary in the line of that purpose, the purpose\r\nbeing to turn the public domain into farms each to be the property of\r\nthe man who actually tills it and makes his home on it.\r\n\r\nInfinite are the possibilities for usefulness that lie before such a\r\nbody as that I am addressing. Work? Of course you will have to work.\r\nI should be sorry for you if you did not have to work. Of course you\r\nwill have to work, and I envy you the fact that before you, before the\r\ngraduates of this university, lies the chance of lives to be spent in\r\nhard labor for great and glorious and useful causes, hard labor for\r\nthe uplifting of your States of the Union, of all mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT MECHANICS’ PAVILION, SAN FRANCISCO, CAL., MAY 13, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman, and you, Men and Women of San Francisco_:\r\n\r\nBefore I came to the Pacific Slope I was an expansionist, and after\r\nhaving been here I fail to understand how any man, convinced of his\r\ncountry’s greatness and glad that his country should challenge\r\nwith proud confidence its mighty future, can be anything but an\r\nexpansionist. In the century that is opening the commerce and the\r\ncommand of the Pacific will be factors of incalculable moment in the\r\nworld’s history.\r\n\r\nThe seat of power ever shifts from land to land, from sea to sea. The\r\nearliest civilizations, those seated beside the Nile, the Tigris,\r\nand the Euphrates, had little to do with sea traffic. But with the\r\nrise of those people who went down to the sea in ships, with the\r\nrise of the Phœnicians, the men of Tyre and Sidon, the Mediterranean\r\nbecame the central sea on whose borders lay the great wealthy and\r\ncultivated powers of antiquity. The war navies and the merchant\r\nmarines of Carthage, Greece, and Rome strove thereon for military and\r\nindustrial supremacy. Its control was the prerequisite to greatness,\r\nand the Roman became lord of the western world only when his fleet\r\nrode unchallenged from the Ægean to the Pillars of Hercules. Then\r\nRome fell. But for centuries thereafter the wealth and the culture of\r\nEurope were centred on its southern shores, and the control of the\r\nMediterranean was vital in favoring or checking their growth. It was\r\nat this time that Venice and Genoa flourished in their grandeur and\r\ntheir might.\r\n\r\nBut gradually the nations of the north grew beyond barbarism and\r\ndeveloped fleets and commerce of their own. The North Sea, the Baltic,\r\nthe Bay of Biscay, saw trading cities rise to become independent\r\nor else to become props of mighty civilized nations. The sea-faring\r\nmerchants ventured with ever greater boldness into the Atlantic. The\r\ncities of the Netherlands, the ports of the Hansa, grew and flourished\r\nas once the Italian cities had grown. Holland and England, Spain,\r\nPortugal, and France sent forth mercantile adventurers to strive for\r\nfame and profit on the high seas. The Cape of Good Hope was doubled,\r\nAmerica was discovered, and the Atlantic Ocean became to the greater\r\nmodern world what the Mediterranean had been to the lesser world of\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\nNow, men and women of California, in our own day, the greatest of all\r\nthe seas and the last to be used on a large scale by civilized man\r\nbids fair to become in its turn the first in point of importance.\r\nThe empire that shifted from the Mediterranean will in the lifetime\r\nof those now children bid fair to shift once more westward to the\r\nPacific. When the 19th century opened the lonely keels of a few\r\nwhale ships, a few merchantmen, had begun to furrow the vast expanse\r\nof the Pacific; but as a whole its islands and its shores were not\r\nmaterially changed from what they had been in the long past ages when\r\nthe Phœnician galleys traded in the purple of Tyre, the ivory of\r\nLibya, the gold of Cyprus. The junks of the Orient still crept between\r\nChina and Japan and Farther India; and from the woody wilderness\r\nwhich shrouded the western shores of our own continent the red lords\r\nof the land looked forth upon a waste of waters which only their\r\nown canoes traversed. That was but a century ago; and now at the\r\nopening of the 20th century the change is so vast that it is wellnigh\r\nimpossible for us to estimate its importance. In the South Seas the\r\ngreat commonwealth of Australia has sprung into being. Japan, shaking\r\noff the lethargy of centuries, has taken her rank among civilized,\r\nmodern powers. European nations have seated themselves along the\r\neastern coast of Asia, while China by her misfortunes has given us an\r\nobject-lesson in the utter folly of attempting to exist as a nation at\r\nall if both rich and defenceless.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile our own mighty Republic has stretched from the Atlantic\r\nto the Pacific, and now in California, Oregon, and Washington,\r\nin Alaska, Hawaii and the Philippines, holds an extent of coast\r\nline which makes it of necessity a power of the first class in the\r\nPacific. The extension in the area of our domain has been immense,\r\nthe extension in the area of our influence even greater. America’s\r\ngeographical position on the Pacific is such as to ensure our\r\npeaceful domination of its waters in the future if only we grasp with\r\nsufficient resolution the advantages of that position. We are taking\r\nlong strides in that direction; witness the cables we are laying down,\r\nthe steamship lines we are starting—some of them already containing\r\nsteamships larger than any freight carriers that have previously\r\nexisted. We have taken the first steps toward digging an Isthmian\r\ncanal, to be under our own control, a canal which will make our\r\nAtlantic and Pacific coast lines in effect continuous, which will be\r\nof incalculable benefit to our mercantile navy, and above all to our\r\nmilitary navy in the event of war.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable march of events gave us the control of the Philippine\r\nIslands at a time so opportune that it may without irreverence be\r\ncalled Providential. Unless we show ourselves weak, unless we show\r\nourselves degenerate sons of the sires from whose loins we sprang, we\r\nmust go on with the work we have undertaken. I most earnestly hope\r\nthat this work will ever be of a peaceful character. We infinitely\r\ndesire peace, and the surest way of obtaining it is to show that we\r\nare not afraid of war. We should deal in a spirit of justice and\r\nfairness with weaker nations, and we should show to the strongest\r\nthat we are able to maintain our rights. Such showing can not be\r\nmade by bluster; for bluster merely invites contempt. Let us speak\r\ncourteously, deal fairly, and keep ourselves armed and ready. If we\r\ndo these things we can count on the peace that comes to the just man\r\narmed, to the just man who neither fears nor inflicts wrong. We must\r\nkeep on building and maintaining a thoroughly efficient navy, with\r\nplenty of the best and most formidable ships, with an ample supply of\r\nofficers and men, and with those officers and men trained in the most\r\nefficient fashion to perform their duties. Only thus can we assure\r\nour position in the world at large. It behooves all men of lofty soul\r\nfit and proud to belong to a mighty nation to see to it that we keep\r\nour position in the world; for our proper place is with the great\r\nexpanding peoples, with the peoples that dare to be great, that\r\naccept with confidence a place of leadership in the world. All our\r\npeople should take that position, but especially of California, you\r\nof the Pacific Slope, for much of our expansion must go through the\r\nGolden Gate, and inevitably you who are seated by the Pacific must\r\ntake the lead in and must profit by the growth of American influence\r\nalong the coasts and among the islands of that mighty ocean, where\r\neast and west finally become one.\r\n\r\nThe citizen that counts, the man that counts in our life, is the man\r\nwho endeavors not to shirk difficulties but to meet and overcome them,\r\nis the man who endeavors not to lead his life in the world’s soft\r\nplaces, not to walk easily and take his comfort, but the man who goes\r\nout to tread the rugged ways that lead to honor and success, the ways\r\nthe treading of which means good work worthily done.\r\n\r\nWhat father or what mother here, if capable of taking the right view,\r\ndoes not wish to see his or her children grow up trained, not to\r\nflinch but to overcome, trained not to avoid whatever is hard and\r\nrough and difficult, but to go down into the hurly-burly of actual\r\nlife and win glory in the arena, heedless of the dust and the sweat\r\nand blood of the contest?\r\n\r\nYou men of the West, the older among you, came here and hewed out\r\nyour own fates for yourselves. The younger among you are the heirs\r\nof the men who did this, and you can not, unless you are false to\r\nyour blood, desire to see the Nation, which is but the aggregate of\r\nthe individuals, act otherwise than in the way which you esteem as\r\nhonorable for the individual.\r\n\r\nOur place as a Nation is and must be with the nations that have left\r\nindelibly their impress on the centuries. Men will tell you that the\r\ngreat expanding nations of antiquity have passed away. So they have;\r\nand so have all others. Those that did not expand passed away and\r\nleft not so much as a memory behind them. The Roman expanded, the\r\nRoman passed away, but the Roman has left the print of his law, of\r\nhis language, of his masterful ability in administration, deep in the\r\nworld’s history, deeply imprinted in the character of the races that\r\ncame after him. I ask that this people rise level to the greatness of\r\nits opportunities. I do not ask that it seek for the easiest path.\r\n\r\nIf our fathers had preferred ease to effort, if they had been content\r\nto say: “Go in peace; we would prefer that the Union were kept, but\r\nwe are not willing to pay the price in blood and effort of keeping\r\nit”; if they had done that there is not a man or woman in this hall\r\nwho would now walk with head erect, who would now have the right to\r\nfeel, as we have the right to feel, that we challenge equality with\r\nthe citizens of the proudest country that the world has yet seen. I\r\nask that this generation and future generations strive in the spirit\r\nof those who strove to found the Republic, of those who strove to\r\nsave and perpetuate it. I ask that this Nation shape its policy in\r\na spirit of justice toward all, a spirit of resolute endeavor to\r\naccept each duty as the duty comes, and to rest ill-content until that\r\nduty is done. I ask that we meet the many problems with which we are\r\nconfronted from without and from within, not in the spirit that seeks\r\nto purchase present peace by the certainty of future disaster, but\r\nwith a wise, a fearless, and a resolute desire to make of this Nation\r\nin the end, as the centuries go by, the example for all the nations\r\nof the earth, to make of it a nation in which we shall see the spirit\r\nof peace and of justice incarnate, but in which also we shall see\r\nincarnate the spirit of courage, of hardihood, the spirit which while\r\nrefusing to wrong the weak is incapable of flinching from the strong.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE CEREMONIES INCIDENT TO THE BREAKING OF SOD FOR THE ERECTION\r\nOF A MONUMENT IN MEMORY OF THE LATE PRESIDENT McKINLEY, SAN\r\nFRANCISCO, CAL., MAY 13, 1903\r\n\r\n  _Friends and Fellow-Americans_:\r\n\r\nIt is a befitting thing that the first sod turned to prepare for the\r\nmonument to commemorate President McKinley should be turned in the\r\npresence of his old comrades of the great war, and in the presence of\r\nthe men who in a lesser war strove to show that they were not wholly\r\nunworthy of those who in the dark years of ’61 to ’65 proved their\r\ntruth by their endeavor, and with their blood cemented the foundation\r\nof the American Republic. It is a solemn thing to speak in memory of\r\na man who when young went to war for the honor and the life of the\r\nNation, who for four years did his part in the camp, on the march,\r\nin battle, rising steadily upward from the ranks, and to whom it was\r\ngiven in after life to show himself exemplary in public and in private\r\nconduct, to become the ideal of the Nation in peace as he had been a\r\ntypical representative of the Nation’s young sons in war.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that no man since Lincoln was as widely and\r\nas universally beloved in this country as was President McKinley; for\r\nit was given to him not only to rise to the most exalted station but\r\nto typify in his character and conduct those virtues which any citizen\r\nworthy of the name likes to regard as typically American; to typify\r\nthe virtues of cleanly and upright living in all relations private and\r\npublic, in the most intimate family relations, in the relations of\r\nbusiness, in relations with his neighbors, and finally in his conduct\r\nof the great affairs of state. And exactly as it was given to him to\r\ndo his part in settling aright the greatest problem which it has ever\r\nbefallen this Nation to settle since it became a Nation—the problem\r\nof the preservation of the Union and the abolition of slavery—exactly\r\nas it was his good fortune to do his part as a man should in his\r\nyouth in settling that great problem, so it was his good fortune,\r\nwhen he became in fact and in name the Nation’s chief, to settle the\r\nproblems springing out of the Spanish War; problems less important\r\nonly than those which were dealt with by the men who under the lead\r\nof Washington founded our government and the men who, upholding the\r\nstatesmanship of Lincoln and following the sword of Grant, or Sherman,\r\nor Thomas, or Sheridan, saved and perpetuated the Republic.\r\n\r\nWhen 1898 came and the war which President McKinley in all honesty and\r\nin all sincerity sought to avoid became inevitable and was pressed\r\nupon him he met it as he and you had met the crisis of 1861. He did\r\nhis best to prevent the war coming; once it became evident that it\r\nhad to come then he did his best to see that it was ended as quickly\r\nand as thoroughly as possible. It is a good lesson for nations and\r\nindividuals to learn never to hit if it can be helped and then never\r\nto hit softly. I think it is getting to be fairly understood that that\r\nis our foreign policy. We do not want to threaten; certainly we do not\r\ndesire to wrong any man; we are going to keep out of trouble if we\r\npossibly can keep out; and if it becomes necessary for our honor and\r\nour interest to assert a given position we shall assert it with every\r\nintention of making the assertion good.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish War came. As its aftermath came trouble in the\r\nPhilippines, and it was natural that this State, within whose borders\r\nlive and have lived so many of the men who fought in the great war,\r\nshould find its sons eagerly volunteering for the chance to prove\r\ntheir truth in the war that came in their days; and it was to be\r\nexpected that California’s sons should do well, as they did do well,\r\nin the Philippines in the new contest.\r\n\r\nAnd now it is eminently fitting that the men of the great war and the\r\nmen of the lesser war claiming not only to have been good soldiers\r\nbut to be good citizens should come here to assist at laying the\r\nfoundation of the monument to him who typified in his career the\r\nvirtues of the soldier and exemplified in his high office our ideals\r\nof good citizenship. I am glad that such a monument should have been\r\nerected here in this wonderful State on the shores of the Pacific;\r\nin this city with a great past and with a future so great that the\r\nmost sanguine among us can not properly estimate it; this city of the\r\nOccident which looks west to the Orient across the Pacific, westward\r\nto the west that is the hoary east; this city situated upon that giant\r\nocean which will in a not distant future be commercially the most\r\nimportant body of water in the entire world.\r\n\r\nI thank you for coming here and for giving me the privilege of joining\r\nwith you to-day in these solemn ceremonies of commemoration, the\r\nceremonies of laying the foundation of a monument which is to keep\r\ngreen in mind the memory of McKinley as a lesson in war and a lesson\r\nin peace, as a lesson to all Americans of what can be done by the\r\nAmerican who in good faith strives to do his whole duty by the mighty\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\n  Illustrations without captions have had a description added, this is\r\n  denoted with parentheses.\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been\r\n  corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within the\r\n  text and consultation of external sources.\r\n\r\n  Some hyphens in words have been silently removed, some added, when a\r\n  predominant preference was found in the original book.\r\n\r\n  Except for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the text,\r\n  and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pg 12: “hundreth” replaced with “hundredth”\r\n  Pg 12: “thoroughout” replaced with “throughout”\r\n  Pg 345: “encouragaging” replaced with “encouraging”",
