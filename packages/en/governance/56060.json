often to the anticipation of new happenings than to a review\r\nof events which have already become a part of the nation’s history.\r\nThis condition is so naturally the result of an immense development\r\nof American enterprise that it should not occasion astonishment, and\r\nperhaps should not be greatly deprecated, so long as a mad rush for\r\nwealth and individual advantage does not stifle our good citizenship\r\nnor weaken the patriotic sentiment which values the integrity of our\r\nGovernment and the success of its mission immeasurably above all other\r\nworldly possessions.\r\n\r\nThe belief that, notwithstanding the overweening desire among our\r\npeople for personal and selfish rewards of effort, there still exists,\r\nunderneath it all, a sedate and unimpaired interest in the things\r\nthat illustrate the design, the traditions, and the power of our\r\nGovernment, has induced me to present in this volume the details of\r\ncertain incidents of national administration concerning which I have\r\nthe knowledge of a prominent participant.\r\n\r\nThese incidents brought as separate topics to the foreground of\r\nagitation and discussion the relations between the Chief Executive\r\nand the Senate in making appointments to office, the vindication and\r\nenforcement of the Monroe Doctrine, the protection of the soundness\r\nand integrity of our finances and currency, and the right of the\r\ngeneral Government to overcome all obstructions to the exercise of its\r\nfunctions in every part of our national domain.\r\n\r\nThose of our people whose interest in the general features of the\r\nincidents referred to was actively aroused at the time of their\r\noccurrence will perhaps find the following pages of some value for\r\nreference or as a means of more complete information.\r\n\r\nI shall do no more in advocacy of the merits of this book than to say\r\nthat as a narrative of facts it has been prepared with great care, and\r\nthat I believe it to be complete and accurate in every essential detail.\r\n\r\n  GROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDEPENDENCE OF THE EXECUTIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIn dealing with “The Independence of the Executive,” I shall refer\r\nfirst of all to the conditions in which the Presidency of the United\r\nStates had its origin, and shall afterward relate an incident within\r\nmy own experience involving the preservation and vindication of an\r\nindependent function of this high office.\r\n\r\nWhen our original thirteen States, actuated by “a decent respect for\r\nthe opinions of mankind,” presented to the world the causes which\r\nimpelled them to separate from the mother country and to cast off\r\nall allegiance to the Crown of England, they gave prominence to the\r\ndeclaration that “the history of the present King of Great Britain is\r\na history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct\r\nobject the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these States.”\r\nThis was followed by an indictment containing not less than eighteen\r\ncounts or accusations, all leveled at the King and the King alone.\r\nThese were closed or clenched by this asseveration: “A Prince whose\r\ncharacter is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is\r\nunfit to be the ruler of a free people.” In this arraignment the\r\nEnglish Parliament was barely mentioned, and then only as “others,”\r\nwith whom the King had conspired by “giving his assent to their act of\r\npretended legislation,” and thus giving operative force to some of the\r\noutrages which had been put upon the colonies.\r\n\r\nIt is thus apparent that in the indictment presented by the thirteen\r\ncolonies they charged the King, who in this connection may properly be\r\nconsidered as the Chief Executive of Great Britain, with the crimes and\r\noffenses which were their justification for the following solemn and\r\nimpressive decree:\r\n\r\n    We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of\r\n    America, in General Congress assembled, appealing to the\r\n    Supreme Judge of the World for the rectitude of our intentions,\r\n    do, in the name and by the authority of the good People of\r\n    these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare that these United\r\n    Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent\r\n    States; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the\r\n    British Crown, and that all political connection between them\r\n    and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally\r\n    dissolved; and that as free and independent States they have\r\n    full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances,\r\n    establish commerce, and do all other acts and things which\r\n    independent States may of right do. And for the support of this\r\n    Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine\r\n    Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our\r\n    fortunes, and our sacred honor.\r\n\r\nTo this irrevocable predicament had the thirteen States or colonies\r\nbeen brought by their resistance to the oppressive exercise of\r\nexecutive power.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances it should not surprise us to find that when,\r\non the footing of the Declaration of Independence, the first scheme\r\nof government was adopted for the revolted States, it contained\r\nno provision for an executive officer to whom should be intrusted\r\nadministrative power and duty. Those who had suffered and rebelled\r\non account of the tyranny of an English King were evidently chary of\r\nsubjecting themselves to the chance of a repetition of their woes\r\nthrough an abuse of the power that might necessarily devolve upon an\r\nAmerican President.\r\n\r\nThus, under the Articles of Confederation, “The United States of\r\nAmerica,” without an executive head as we understand the term, came to\r\nthe light; and in its charter of existence it was declared that “the\r\narticles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every\r\nState, and the Union shall be perpetual.”\r\n\r\nLet us not harbor too low an opinion of the Confederation. Under its\r\nguidance and direction the war of the Revolution was fought to a\r\nsuccessful result, and the people of the States which were parties\r\nto it became in fact free and independent. But the Articles of\r\nConfederation lacked the power to enforce the decree they contained of\r\ninviolable observance by every State; and the union, which under their\r\nsanction was to be permanent and lasting, early developed symptoms of\r\ninevitable decay.\r\n\r\nIt thus happened that within ten years after the date of the Articles\r\nof Confederation their deficiencies had become so manifest that\r\nrepresentatives of the people were again assembled in convention to\r\nconsider the situation and to devise a plan of government that would\r\nform “a more perfect union” in place of the crumbling structure which\r\nhad so lately been proclaimed as perpetual.\r\n\r\nThe pressing necessity for such action cannot be more forcibly\r\nportrayed than was done by Mr. Madison when, in a letter written a\r\nshort time before the convention, he declared:\r\n\r\n    Our situation is becoming every day more and more critical. No\r\n    money comes into the Federal treasury; no respect is paid to\r\n    the Federal authority; and people of reflection unanimously\r\n    agree that the existing Confederacy is tottering to its\r\n    foundation. Many individuals of weight, particularly in the\r\n    Eastern district, are suspected of leaning towards monarchy.\r\n    Other individuals predict a partition of the States into two or\r\n    more confederacies.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time universally conceded that if success was to\r\nfollow the experiment of popular government among the new States, the\r\ncreation of an Executive branch invested with power and responsibility\r\nwould be an absolutely essential factor. Madison, in referring to the\r\nprospective work of the convention, said:\r\n\r\n    A national executive will also be necessary. I have scarcely\r\n    ventured to form my own opinion yet, either of the manner in\r\n    which it ought to be constituted, or of the authorities with\r\n    which it ought to be clothed.\r\n\r\nWe know that every plan of government proposed or presented to\r\nthe convention embodied in some form as a prominent feature the\r\nestablishment of an effective Executive; and I think it can be safely\r\nsaid that no subject was submitted which proved more perplexing and\r\ntroublesome. We ought not to consider this as unnatural. Many members\r\nof the convention, while obliged to confess that the fears and\r\nprejudices that refused executive power to the Confederacy had led to\r\nthe most unfortunate results, were still confronted with a remnant of\r\nthose fears and prejudices, and were not yet altogether free from the\r\nsuspicion that the specter of monarchy might be concealed behind every\r\nsuggestion of executive force. Others less timid were nevertheless\r\ntremendously embarrassed by a lack of definite and clear conviction as\r\nto the manner of creating the new office and fixing its limitations.\r\nStill another difficulty, which seems to have been all-pervading and\r\nchronic in the convention, and which obstinately fastened itself\r\nto the discussion of the subject, was the jealousy and suspicion\r\nexisting between the large and small States. I am afraid, also, that\r\nan unwillingness to trust too much to the people had its influence\r\nin preventing an easy solution of the executive problem. The first\r\nproposal made in the convention that the President should be elected by\r\nthe people was accompanied by an apologetic statement by the member\r\nmaking the suggestion that he was almost unwilling to declare the mode\r\nof selection he preferred, “being apprehensive that it might appear\r\nchimerical.” Another favored the idea of popular election, but thought\r\nit “impracticable”; another was not clear that the people ought to act\r\ndirectly even in the choice of electors, being, as alleged, “too little\r\ninformed of personal characters in large districts, and liable to\r\ndeception”; and again, it was declared that “it would be as unnatural\r\nto refer the choice of a proper character for Chief Magistrate to the\r\npeople as it would to refer a trial of colors to a blind man.”\r\n\r\nA plan was first adopted by the convention which provided for the\r\nselection of the President by the Congress, or, as it was then called,\r\nby the National Legislature. Various other plans were proposed, but\r\nonly to be summarily rejected in favor of that which the convention\r\nhad apparently irrevocably decided upon. There were, however, among\r\nthe members, some who, notwithstanding the action taken, lost\r\nno opportunity to advocate, with energy and sound reasons, the\r\nsubstitution of a mode of electing the President more in keeping with\r\nthe character of the office and the genius of a popular government.\r\nThis fortunate persistence resulted in the reopening of the subject\r\nand its reference, very late in the sessions of the convention, to a\r\ncommittee who reported in favor of a procedure for the choice of the\r\nExecutive substantially identical with that now in force; and this was\r\nadopted by the convention almost unanimously.\r\n\r\nThis imperfect review of the incidents that led up to the establishment\r\nof the office of President, and its rescue from dangers which\r\nsurrounded its beginning, if not otherwise useful, ought certainly to\r\nsuggest congratulatory and grateful reflections. The proposition that\r\nthe selection of a President should rest entirely with the Congress,\r\nwhich came so near adoption, must, I think, appear to us as something\r\nabsolutely startling; and we may well be surprised that it was ever\r\nfavorably considered by the convention.\r\n\r\nIn the scheme of our national Government the Presidency is\r\npreëminently the people’s office. Of course, all offices created by\r\nthe Constitution, and all governmental agencies existing under its\r\nsanction, must be recognized, in a sense, as the offices and agencies\r\nof the people--considered either as an aggregation constituting the\r\nnational body politic, or some of its divisions. When, however, I now\r\nspeak of the Presidency as being preëminently the people’s office,\r\nI mean that it is especially the office related to the people as\r\nindividuals, in no general, local, or other combination, but standing\r\non the firm footing of manhood and American citizenship. The Congress\r\nmay enact laws; but they are inert and vain without executive impulse.\r\nThe Federal courts adjudicate upon the rights of the citizen when their\r\naid is invoked. But under the constitutional mandate that the President\r\n“shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” every citizen,\r\nin the day or in the night, at home or abroad, is constantly within the\r\nprotection and restraint of the Executive power--none so lowly as to be\r\nbeneath its scrupulous care, and none so great and powerful as to be\r\nbeyond its restraining force.\r\n\r\nIn view of this constant touch and the relationship thus existing\r\nbetween the citizen and the Executive, it would seem that these\r\nconsiderations alone supplied sufficient reason why his selection\r\nshould rest upon the direct and independent expression of the people’s\r\nchoice. This reason is reinforced by the fact that inasmuch as Senators\r\nare elected by the State legislatures, Representatives in Congress\r\nby the votes of districts or States, and judges are appointed by the\r\nPresident, it is only in the selection of the President that the body\r\nof the American people can by any possibility act together and directly\r\nin the equipment of their national Government. Without at least this\r\nmuch of participation in that equipment, we could hardly expect that a\r\nruinous discontent and revolt could be long suppressed among a people\r\nwho had been promised a popular and representative government.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to be understood as conceding that the selection of a\r\nPresident through electors chosen by the people of the several States,\r\naccording to our present plan, perfectly meets the case as I have\r\nstated it. On the contrary, it has always seemed to me that this plan\r\nis weakened by an unfortunate infirmity. Though the people in each\r\nState are permitted to vote directly for electors, who shall give voice\r\nto the popular preference of the State in the choice of President, the\r\nvoters throughout the nation may be so distributed, and the majorities\r\ngiven for electors in the different States may be such, that a minority\r\nof all the voters in the land can determine, and in some cases actually\r\nhave determined, who the President should be. I believe a way should be\r\ndevised to prevent such a result.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost ungracious, however, to find fault with our present\r\nmethod of electing a President when we recall the alternative from\r\nwhich we escaped, through the final action of the convention which\r\nframed the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is nevertheless a curious fact that the plan at first adopted,\r\nvesting in Congress the presidential election, was utterly inconsistent\r\nwith the opinion of those most prominent in the convention, as well\r\nas of all thoughtful and patriotic Americans who watched for a happy\r\nresult from its deliberations, that the corner-stone of the new\r\nGovernment should be a distinct division of powers and functions\r\namong the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches, with the\r\nindependence of each amply secured. Whatever may have been the real\r\nreasons for giving the choice of the President to Congress, I am sure\r\nthose which were announced in the convention do not satisfy us in this\r\nday and generation that such an arrangement would have secured either\r\nthe separateness or independence of the Executive department. I am glad\r\nto believe this to be so palpable as to make it unnecessary for me to\r\nsuggest other objections, which might subject me to the suspicion of\r\nquestioning the wisdom or invariably safe motives of Congress in this\r\nrelation. It is much more agreeable to acknowledge gratefully that a\r\ndanger was avoided, and a method finally adopted for the selection of\r\nthe Executive head of the Government which was undoubtedly the best\r\nwithin the reach of the convention.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution formed by this convention has been justly extolled by\r\ninformed and liberty-loving men throughout the world. The statesman\r\nwho, above all his contemporaries of the past century, was best able\r\nto pass judgment on its merits formulated an unchallenged verdict when\r\nhe declared that “the American Constitution is the most wonderful work\r\never struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man.”\r\n\r\nWe dwell with becoming pride upon the intellectual greatness of the\r\nmen who composed the convention which created this Constitution. They\r\nwere indeed great; but the happy result of their labor would not have\r\nbeen saved to us and to humanity if to intellectual greatness there had\r\nnot been added patriotism, patience, and, last but by no means least,\r\nforbearing tact. To these traits are we especially indebted for the\r\ncreation of an Executive department, limited against every possible\r\ndanger of usurpation or tyranny, but, at the same time, strong and\r\nindependent within its limitations.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution declares: “The executive power shall be vested in a\r\nPresident of the United States of America,” and this is followed by a\r\nrecital of the specific and distinctly declared duties with which he is\r\ncharged, and the powers with which he is invested. The members of the\r\nconvention were not willing, however, that the executive power which\r\nthey had vested in the President should be cramped and embarrassed by\r\nany implication that a specific statement of certain granted powers and\r\nduties excluded all other executive functions; nor were they apparently\r\nwilling that the claim of such exclusion should have countenance in the\r\nstrict meaning which might be given to the words “executive power.”\r\nTherefore we find that the Constitution supplements a recital of the\r\nspecific powers and duties of the President with this impressive and\r\nconclusive additional requirement: “He shall take care that the laws be\r\nfaithfully executed.” This I conceive to be equivalent to a grant of\r\nall the power necessary to the performance of his duty in the faithful\r\nexecution of the laws.\r\n\r\nThe form of Constitution first proposed to the convention provided that\r\nthe President elect, before entering upon the duties of his office,\r\nshould take an oath, simply declaring: “I will faithfully execute the\r\noffice of President of the United States.” To this brief and very\r\ngeneral obligation there were added by the convention the following\r\nwords: “and will to the best of my judgment and power preserve,\r\nprotect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.” Finally,\r\nthe “Committee on Style,” appointed by the convention, apparently to\r\narrange the order of the provisions agreed upon, and to suggest the\r\nlanguage in which they would be best expressed, reported in favor of an\r\noath in these terms: “I will faithfully execute the office of President\r\nof the United States, and will to the best of my ability preserve,\r\nprotect, and defend the Constitution of the United States”; and this\r\nform was adopted by the convention without discussion, and continues to\r\nthis day as the form of obligation which binds the conscience of every\r\nincumbent of our Chief Magistracy.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore apparent that as the Constitution, in addition to\r\nits specification of especial duties and powers devolving upon\r\nthe President, provides that “he shall take care that the laws be\r\nfaithfully executed,” and as this was evidently intended as a general\r\ndevolution of power and imposition of obligation in respect to any\r\ncondition that might arise relating to the execution of the laws, so\r\nit is likewise apparent that the convention was not content to rest\r\nthe sworn obligation of the President solely upon his covenant to\r\n“faithfully execute the office of President of the United States,” but\r\nadded thereto the mandate that he should preserve, protect, and defend\r\nthe Constitution, to the best of his judgment and power, or, as it was\r\nafterward expressed, to the best of his ability. Thus is our President\r\nsolemnly required not only to exercise every power attached to his\r\noffice, to the end that the laws may be faithfully executed, and not\r\nonly to render obedience to the demands of the fundamental law and\r\nexecutive duty, but to exert all his official strength and authority\r\nfor the preservation, protection, and defense of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have thus far presented considerations which while they have to do\r\nwith my topic are only preliminary to its more especial and distinct\r\ndiscussion. In furtherance of this discussion it now becomes necessary\r\nto quote from the Constitution the following clause found among its\r\nspecification of presidential duty and authority:\r\n\r\n    And he shall nominate, and by and with the advice of the Senate\r\n    shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls,\r\n    judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the\r\n    United States whose appointments are not herein otherwise\r\n    provided for, and which shall be established by law.\r\n\r\nThis clause was the subject of a prolonged and thorough debate in\r\nCongress which occurred in the year 1789 and during the first session\r\nof that body assembled under the new Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe question discussed involved distinctly and solely the independent\r\npower of the President under the Constitution to remove an officer\r\nappointed by him by and with the advice of the Senate. The discussion\r\narose upon a bill then before the Congress, providing for the\r\norganization of the State Department, which contained a provision that\r\nthe head of the department to be created should be removable from\r\noffice by the President. This was opposed by a considerable number on\r\nthe ground that as the Senate coöperated in the appointment, it should\r\nalso be consulted in the matter of removal; it was urged by others that\r\nthe power of removal in such cases was already vested in the President\r\nby the Constitution, and that the provision was therefore unnecessary;\r\nand it was also contended that the question whether the Constitution\r\npermitted such removal or not should be left untouched by legislative\r\naction, and be determined by the courts.\r\n\r\nThose insisting upon retaining in the bill the clause permitting\r\nremoval by the President alone, claimed that such legislation would\r\nremove all doubt on the subject, though they asserted that the absolute\r\ninvestiture of all executive power in the President, reinforced by\r\nthe constitutional command that he should take care that the laws be\r\nfaithfully executed, justified their position that the power already\r\nexisted, especially in the absence of any adverse expression in the\r\nConstitution. They also insisted that the removal of subordinate\r\nofficers was an act so executive in its character, and so intimately\r\nrelated to the faithful execution of the laws, that it was clearly\r\namong the President’s constitutional prerogatives, and that if it was\r\nnot sufficiently declared in the Constitution, the omission should be\r\nsupplied by the legislation proposed.\r\n\r\nIn support of these positions it was said that the participation of the\r\nSenate in the removal of executive officers would be a dangerous step\r\ntoward breaking down the partitions between the different departments\r\nof the Government which had been carefully erected, and were regarded\r\nby every statesman of that time as absolutely essential to our national\r\nexistence; and stress was laid upon the unhappy condition that would\r\narise in case a removal desired by the President should be refused\r\nby the Senate, and he thus should be left, still charged with the\r\nresponsibility of the faithful execution of the laws, while deprived\r\nof the loyalty and constancy of his subordinates and assistants, who,\r\nif resentful of his efforts for their removal, would lack devotion\r\nto his work, and who, having learned to rely upon another branch\r\nof the Government for their retention, would be invited to defiant\r\ninsubordination.\r\n\r\nAt the time of this discussion the proceedings of the Senate took\r\nplace behind closed doors, and its debates were not published, but its\r\ndeterminations upon such questions as came before it were made public.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the other branch of the Congress, however, were\r\nopen, and we are permitted through their publication to follow the very\r\ninteresting discussion of the question referred to in the House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nThe membership of that body included a number of those who had been\r\nmembers of the Constitutional Convention, and who, fresh from its\r\ndeliberations, were necessarily somewhat familiar with its purposes and\r\nintent. Mr. Madison was there, who had as much to do as any other man\r\nwith the inauguration of the convention and its successful conclusion.\r\nHe was not only especially prominent in its deliberations, but\r\nincreased his familiarity with its pervading spirit and disposition by\r\nkeeping a careful record of its proceedings. In speaking of his reasons\r\nfor keeping this record he says:\r\n\r\n    The curiosity I had felt during my researches into the history\r\n    of the most distinguished confederacies, particularly those\r\n    of antiquity, and the deficiency I found in the means of\r\n    satisfying it, more especially in what related to the process,\r\n    the principles, the reasons and the anticipations which\r\n    prevailed in the formation of them, determined me to preserve\r\n    as far as I could an exact account of what might pass in the\r\n    convention while executing its trust, with the magnitude of\r\n    which I was duly impressed, as I was by the gratification\r\n    promised to future curiosity, by an authentic exhibition of\r\n    the objects, the opinions and the reasonings from which a new\r\n    system of government was to receive its peculiar structure\r\n    and organization. Nor was I unaware of the value of such a\r\n    contribution to the fund of materials for the history of a\r\n    Constitution on which would be staked the happiness of a\r\n    people great in its infancy and possibly the cause of liberty\r\n    throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThis important debate also gains great significance from the fact that\r\nit occurred within two years after the completion of the Constitution,\r\nand before political rancor or the temptations of partizan zeal had\r\nintervened to vex our congressional counsels.\r\n\r\nIt must be conceded, I think, that all the accompanying circumstances\r\ngave tremendous weight and authority to this first legislative\r\nconstruction of the Constitution in the first session of the first\r\nHouse of Representatives, and that these circumstances fully warranted\r\nMr. Madison’s declaration during the debate:\r\n\r\n    I feel the importance of the question, and know that our\r\n    decision will involve the decision of all similar cases. The\r\n    decision that is at this time made will become the permanent\r\n    exposition of the Constitution, and on a permanent exposition\r\n    of the Constitution will depend the genius and character of the\r\n    whole Government.\r\n\r\nThe discussion developed the fact that from the first a decided\r\nmajority were of the opinion that the Executive should have power of\r\nindependent removal, whether already derived from the Constitution\r\nor to be conferred by supplementary legislation. It will be recalled\r\nthat the debate arose upon the clause in a pending bill providing that\r\nthe officer therein named should “be removable by the President,”\r\nand that some of the members of the House, holding that such power\r\nof removal was plainly granted to the Constitution, insisted that it\r\nwould be useless and improper to assume to confer it by legislative\r\nenactment. Though a motion to strike from the bill the clause objected\r\nto had been negatived by a large majority, it was afterward proposed,\r\nin deference to the opinions of those who suggested that the House\r\nshould go no further than to give a legislative construction to the\r\nConstitution in favor of executive removal, that in lieu of the words\r\ncontained in the bill, indicating a grant of the power, there should\r\nbe inserted a provision for a new appointment in case of a vacancy\r\noccurring in the following manner:\r\n\r\n    Whenever the said principal officer shall be removed from\r\n    office by the President of the United States, or in any other\r\n    case of vacancy.\r\n\r\nThis was universally acknowledged to be a distinct and unequivocal\r\ndeclaration that, under the Constitution, the right of removal was\r\nconferred upon the President; and those supporting that proposition\r\nvoted in favor of the change, which was adopted by a decisive majority.\r\nThe bill thus completed was sent to the Senate, where, if there was\r\nopposition to it on the ground that it contained a provision in\r\nderogation of senatorial right, it did not avail; for the bill was\r\npassed by that body, though grudgingly, and, as has been disclosed,\r\nonly by the vote of the Vice-President, upon an equal division of the\r\nSenate. It may not be amiss to mention, as adding significance to the\r\nconcurrence of the House and the Senate in the meaning and effect of\r\nthe clause pertaining to removal as embodied in this bill, that during\r\nthat same session two other bills creating the Treasury Department\r\nand the War Department, containing precisely the same provision, were\r\npassed by both Houses.\r\n\r\nI hope I shall be deemed fully justified in detailing at some length\r\nthe circumstances that led up to a legislative construction of the\r\nConstitution, as authoritative as any surroundings could possibly make\r\nit, in favor of the constitutional right of the President to remove\r\nFederal officials without the participation or interference of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nThis was in 1789. In 1886, ninety-seven years afterward, this question\r\nwas again raised in a sharp contention between the Senate and the\r\nPresident. In the meantime, as was quite natural perhaps, partizanship\r\nhad grown more pronounced and bitter, and it was at that particular\r\ntime by no means softened by the fact that the party that had become\r\nhabituated to power by twenty-four years of substantial control of the\r\nGovernment, was obliged, on the 4th of March, 1885, to make way in the\r\nexecutive office for a President elected by the opposite party. He\r\ncame into office fully pledged to the letter of Civil Service reform;\r\nand passing beyond the letter of the law on that subject, he had said:\r\n\r\n    There is a class of government positions which are not within\r\n    the letter of the Civil Service statute, but which are so\r\n    disconnected with the policy of an administration, that the\r\n    removal therefrom of present incumbents, in my opinion, should\r\n    not be made during the terms for which they were appointed,\r\n    solely on partizan grounds, and for the purpose of putting\r\n    in their places those who are in political accord with the\r\n    appointing power.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of this statement is, that while, among the officers not\r\naffected by the Civil Service law, there are those whose duties are so\r\nrelated to the enforcement of the political policy of an administration\r\nthat they should be in full accord with it, there are others whose\r\nduties are not so related, and who simply perform executive work; and\r\nthese, though beyond the protection of Civil Service legislation,\r\nshould not be removed merely for the purpose of rewarding the party\r\nfriends of the President, by putting them in the positions thus made\r\nvacant. An adherence to this rule, based upon the spirit instead of\r\nthe letter of Civil Service reform, I believe established a precedent,\r\nwhich has since operated to check wholesale removals solely for\r\npolitical reasons.\r\n\r\nThe declaration which I have quoted was, however, immediately followed\r\nby an important qualification, in these terms:\r\n\r\n    But many men holding such positions have forfeited all just\r\n    claim to retention, because they have used their places for\r\n    party purposes, in disregard of their duty to the people;\r\n    and because, instead of being decent public servants, they\r\n    have proved themselves offensive partizans and unscrupulous\r\n    manipulators of local party management.\r\n\r\nThese pledges were not made without a full appreciation of the\r\ndifficulties and perplexities that would follow in their train. It\r\nwas anticipated that party associates would expect, notwithstanding\r\nExecutive pledges made in advance, that there would be a speedy and\r\nliberal distribution among them of the offices from which they had been\r\ninexorably excluded for nearly a quarter of a century. It was plainly\r\nseen that many party friends would be disappointed, that personal\r\nfriends would be alienated, and that the charge of ingratitude, the\r\nmost distressing and painful of all accusations, would find abundant\r\nvoice. Nor were the difficulties overlooked that would sometimes\r\naccompany a consistent and just attempt to determine the cases in\r\nwhich incumbents in office had forfeited their claim to retention. That\r\nsuch cases were numerous, no one with the slightest claim to sincerity\r\ncould for a moment deny.\r\n\r\nWith all these things in full view, and with an alternative of escape\r\nin sight through an evasion of pledges, it was stubbornly determined\r\nby the new Executive that the practical enforcement of the principle\r\ninvolved was worth all the sacrifices which were anticipated. And while\r\nit was not expected that the Senate, which was the only stronghold left\r\nto the party politically opposed to the President, would contribute an\r\nugly dispute to a situation already sufficiently troublesome, I am in a\r\nposition to say that even such a contingency, if early made manifest,\r\nwould have been contemplated with all possible fortitude.\r\n\r\nThe Tenure of Office act, it will be remembered, was passed in 1867 for\r\nthe express purpose of preventing removals from office by President\r\nJohnson, between whom and the Congress a quarrel at that time raged, so\r\nbitter that it was regarded by sober and thoughtful men as a national\r\naffliction, if not a scandal.\r\n\r\nAn amusing story is told of a legislator who, endeavoring to persuade\r\na friend and colleague to aid him in the passage of a certain measure\r\nin which he was personally interested, met the remark that his bill\r\nwas unconstitutional with the exclamation, “What does the Constitution\r\namount to between friends?” It would be unseemly to suggest that in the\r\nheat of strife the majority in Congress had deliberately determined to\r\npass an unconstitutional law, but they evidently had reached the point\r\nwhere they considered that what seemed to them the public interest and\r\nsafety justified them, whatever the risk might be, in setting aside\r\nthe congressional construction given to the Constitution seventy-eight\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\nThe law passed in 1867 was exceedingly radical, and in effect\r\ndistinctly purported to confer upon the Senate the power of preventing\r\nthe removal of officers without the consent of that body. It was\r\nprovided that during a recess of the Senate an officer might be\r\nsuspended only in case it was shown by evidence satisfactory to the\r\nPresident, that the incumbent was guilty of misconduct in office or\r\ncrime, or when for any reason he should become incapable or legally\r\ndisqualified to perform his duties; and that within twenty days after\r\nthe beginning of the next session of the Senate, the President should\r\nreport to that body such suspension, with the evidence and reasons for\r\nhis action in the case, and the name of the person designated by the\r\nPresident to perform temporarily the duties of the office. Then follows\r\nthis provision:\r\n\r\n    And if the Senate shall concur in such suspension and advise\r\n    and consent to the removal of such officer, they shall so\r\n    certify to the President, who may thereupon remove said\r\n    officer, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate\r\n    appoint another person to such office. But if the Senate shall\r\n    refuse to concur in such suspension, such officer so suspended\r\n    shall forthwith resume the functions of his office.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of April, 1869, a month and a day after President Johnson\r\nwas succeeded in the Presidency by General Grant, that part of the\r\nact of 1867 above referred to, having answered the purpose for which\r\nit was passed, was repealed, and other legislation was enacted in its\r\nplace. It was provided in the new statute that the President might “in\r\nhis discretion,” during the recess of that body, suspend officials\r\nuntil the end of the next session of the Senate, and designate suitable\r\npersons to perform the duties of such suspended officer in the\r\nmeantime; and that such designated persons should be subject to removal\r\nin the discretion of the President by the designation of others. The\r\nfollowing, in regard to the effect of such suspension, was inserted in\r\nlieu of the provision on that subject in the law of 1867 which I have\r\nquoted:\r\n\r\n    And it shall be the duty of the President within thirty days\r\n    after the commencement of each session of the Senate, except\r\n    for any office which in his opinion ought not to be filled, to\r\n    nominate persons to fill all vacancies in office which existed\r\n    at the meeting of the Senate, whether temporarily filled or\r\n    not, and also in the place of all officers suspended; and\r\n    if the Senate, during such session, shall refuse to advise\r\n    and consent to an appointment in the place of any suspended\r\n    officer, then, and not otherwise, the President shall nominate\r\n    another person as soon as practicable to said session of the\r\n    Senate for said office.\r\n\r\nThis was the condition of the so-called tenure of office legislation\r\nwhen a Democratic President was inaugurated and placed in expected\r\ncoöperation with a Republican majority in the Senate--well drilled,\r\nwell organized, with partizanship enough at least to insure against\r\nindifference to party advantage, and perhaps with here and there a\r\ntrace of post-election irritation.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said as to the constitutionality of the Tenure of\r\nOffice laws of 1867 and 1869, certainly the latter statute did not\r\nseem, in outside appearance, to be charged with explosive material\r\nthat endangered Executive prerogative. It grew out of a bill for\r\nthe absolute and unconditional repeal of the law of 1867 relating\r\nto removals and suspensions. This bill originated in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and passed that body so nearly unanimously that\r\nonly sixteen votes were recorded against it. In the Senate, however,\r\namendments were proposed, which being rejected by the House, a\r\ncommittee of conference was appointed to adjust, by compromise if\r\npossible, the controversy between the two bodies. This resulted in an\r\nagreement by the committee upon the provisions of the law of 1869,\r\nas a settlement of the difficulty. In the debate in the House of\r\nRepresentatives on the report of the committee, great uncertainty and\r\ndifferences of opinion were developed as to its meaning and effect.\r\nEven the House conferees differed in their explanation of it. Members\r\nwere assured that the proposed modifications of the law of 1867, if\r\nadopted, would amount to its complete repeal; and it was also asserted\r\nwith equal confidence that some of its objectionable limitations upon\r\nexecutive authority would still remain in force. In this state of\r\nconfusion and doubt the House of Representatives, which a few days\r\nbefore had passed a measure for unconditional repeal, with only sixteen\r\nvotes against it, adopted the report of the conference committee with\r\nsixty-seven votes in the negative.\r\n\r\nSo far as removals following suspensions are concerned, the language of\r\nthe law of 1869 certainly seems to justify the understanding that in\r\nthis particular it virtually repealed the existing statute.\r\n\r\nThe provision permitting the President to suspend only on certain\r\nspecified grounds was so changed as to allow him to make such\r\nsuspensions “in his discretion.” The requirements that the President\r\nshould report to the Senate “the evidence and reasons for his action in\r\nthe case,” and making the advice and consent of the Senate necessary\r\nto the removal of a suspended officer, were entirely eliminated; and\r\nin lieu of the provision in the law of 1867 that “if the Senate shall\r\nrefuse to concur in such suspension, such officer so suspended shall\r\nforthwith resume the functions of his office,” the law of 1869, after\r\nrequiring the President to send to the Senate nominations to fill the\r\nplace of officers who had been “in his discretion” suspended, declared\r\n“that if the Senate, during such session, shall refuse to advise and\r\nconsent to an appointment in the place of any suspended officer,”--that\r\nis, shall refuse to confirm the person appointed by the President in\r\nplace of the officer suspended,--not that “such officer so suspended\r\nshall resume the functions of his office,” but that “then, and not\r\notherwise, the President shall nominate another person as soon as\r\npracticable to said session of the Senate for said office.”\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the gist of the whole matter is contained in a\r\ncomparison of these two provisions. Under the law of 1867 the incumbent\r\nis only conditionally suspended, still having the right to resume his\r\noffice in case the Senate refuses to concur in the suspension; but\r\nunder the law of 1869 the Senate had no concern with the suspension\r\nof the incumbent, nor with the discretion vested in the President in\r\nreference thereto by the express language of the statute; and the\r\nsuspended incumbent was beyond official resuscitation. Instead of the\r\nleast intimation that in any event he might “resume the functions of\r\nhis office,” as provided in the law of 1867, it is especially declared\r\nthat in case the Senate shall refuse to advise and consent to the\r\nappointment of the particular person nominated by the President in\r\nplace of the suspended official, he shall nominate another person\r\nto the Senate for such office. Thus the party suspended seems to\r\nbe eliminated from consideration, the Senate is relegated to its\r\nconstitutional rights of confirming or rejecting nominations as it sees\r\nfit, and the President is reinstated in his undoubted constitutional\r\npower of removal through the form of suspension.\r\n\r\nIn addition to what is apparent from a comparison of these two\r\nstatutes, it may not be improper to glance at certain phases of\r\nexecutive and senatorial action since the passage of the law of 1869\r\nas bearing upon the theory that, so far as it dealt with suspensions\r\nand their effect, if it did not amount to a repeal of the law of 1867,\r\nit at least extinguished all its harmful vitality as a limitation of\r\nexecutive prerogative. It has been stated, apparently by authority,\r\nthat President Grant within seven weeks after his inauguration on the\r\n4th of March, 1869, sent to the Senate six hundred and eighty cases of\r\nremovals or suspensions, all of which I assume were entirely proper and\r\njustifiable. I cannot tell how many of the cases thus submitted to the\r\nSenate were suspensions, nor how many of them purported to be removals;\r\nnor do I know how many nominations of new officers accompanying them\r\nwere confirmed. It appears that ninety-seven of them were withdrawn\r\nbefore they were acted upon by the Senate; and inasmuch as the law of\r\n1867 was in force during four of the seven weeks within which these\r\nremovals and suspensions were submitted, it is barely possible that\r\nthese withdrawals were made during the four weeks when the law of 1867\r\nwas operative, to await a more convenient season under the law of\r\n1869. Attention should be here called, however, to the dissatisfaction\r\nof President Grant, early in his incumbency, with the complexion of\r\nthe situation, even under the repealing and amendatory law of 1869.\r\nIn his first annual message to the Congress in December, 1869, he\r\ncomplained of that statute as “being inconsistent with a faithful\r\nand efficient administration of the Government,” and recommended its\r\nrepeal. Perhaps he was led to apprehend that the Senate would claim\r\nunder its provisions the power to prevent the President from putting\r\nout of office an undesirable official by suspension. This is indicated\r\nby the following sentence in his message: “What faith can an Executive\r\nput in officials forced upon him, and those, too, whom he has suspended\r\nfor reason?” Or it may be possible that he did not then appreciate\r\nhow accommodatingly the law might be construed or enforced when the\r\nPresident and Senate were in political accord. However these things may\r\nbe, it is important to observe, in considering the light in which the\r\nlaw of 1869 came to be regarded by both the Executive and the Senate,\r\nthat President Grant did not deem it necessary afterward to renew his\r\nrecommendation for its repeal, and that at no time since its enactment\r\nhas its existence been permitted to embarrass executive action prior to\r\nthe inauguration of a President politically opposed to the majority in\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nThe review which I have thus made of the creation of our national\r\nExecutive office, and of certain events and incidents which interpreted\r\nits powers and functions, leads me now to a detailed account of the\r\nincident mentioned by me at the beginning as related to the general\r\nsubject under discussion and in which I was personally concerned.\r\nBut before proceeding further, I desire to say that any allusion I\r\nmay have made, or may hereafter make, recognizing the existence of\r\npartizanship in certain quarters does not arise from a spirit of\r\ncomplaint or condemnation. I intend no more by such allusions than\r\nto explain and illustrate the matters with which I have to deal by\r\nsurrounding conditions and circumstances. I fully appreciate the fact\r\nthat partizanship follows party organization, that it is apt to be\r\nunduly developed in all parties, and that it often hampers the best\r\naspirations and purposes of public life; but I hope I have reached\r\na condition when I can recall such adverse partizanship as may have\r\nentered into past conflicts and perplexities, without misleading\r\nirritation or prejudice.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nImmediately after the change of administration in 1885, the pressure\r\nbegan for the ousting of Republican office-holders and the substitution\r\nof Democrats in their places. While I claim to have earned a position\r\nwhich entitles me to resent the accusation that I either openly or\r\ncovertly favor swift official decapitation for partizan purposes, I\r\nhave no sympathy with the intolerant people who, without the least\r\nappreciation of the meaning of party work and service, superciliously\r\naffect to despise all those who apply for office as they would those\r\nguilty of a flagrant misdemeanor. It will indeed be a happy day when\r\nthe ascendancy of party principles, and the attainment of wholesome\r\nadministration, will be universally regarded as sufficient rewards\r\nof individual and legitimate party service. Much has already been\r\naccomplished in the direction of closing the door of partizanship as\r\nan entrance to public employment; and though this branch of effort in\r\nthe public interest may well be still further extended, such extension\r\ncertainly should be supplemented by earnest and persuasive attempts to\r\ncorrect among our people long-cherished notions concerning the ends\r\nthat should be sought through political activity, and by efforts to\r\nuproot pernicious and office-rewarding political methods. I am not sure\r\nthat any satisfactory progress can be made toward these results, until\r\nour good men with unanimity cease regarding politics as necessarily\r\ndebasing, and by active participation shall displace the selfish and\r\nunworthy who, when uninterrupted, control party operations. In the\r\nmeantime, why should we indiscriminately hate those who seek office?\r\nThey may not have entirely emancipated themselves from the belief that\r\nthe offices should pass with party victory; but even if this is charged\r\nagainst them, it can surely be said that in all other respects they are\r\nin many instances as honest, as capable, and as intelligent as any of\r\nus. There may be reasons and considerations which properly defeat their\r\naspirations, but their applications are not always disgraceful. I have\r\nan idea that sometimes the greatest difference between them and those\r\nwho needlessly abuse them and gloat over their discomfiture, consists\r\nin the fact that the office-seekers desire office, and their critics,\r\nbeing more profitably employed, do not. I feel constrained to say\r\nthis much by way of defending, or at least excusing, many belonging\r\nto a numerous contingent of citizens, who, after the 4th of March,\r\n1885, made large drafts upon my time, vitality, and patience; and I\r\nfeel bound to say that in view of their frequent disappointments, and\r\nthe difficulty they found in appreciating the validity of the reasons\r\ngiven for refusing their applications, they accepted the situation\r\nwith as much good nature and contentment as could possibly have been\r\nanticipated. It must be remembered that they and their party associates\r\nhad been banished from Federal office-holding for twenty-four years.\r\n\r\nI have no disposition to evade the fact that suspensions of officials\r\nholding presidential commissions began promptly and were quite\r\nvigorously continued; but I confidently claim that every suspension\r\nmade was with honest intent and, I believe, in accordance with the\r\nrequirements of good administration and consistent with prior executive\r\npledges. Some of these officials held by tenures unlimited as to their\r\nduration. Among these were certain internal-revenue officers who, it\r\nseemed to me, in analogy with others doing similar work but having a\r\nlimited tenure, ought to consider a like limited period of incumbency\r\ntheir proper term of office; and there were also consular officials\r\nand others attached to the foreign service who, I believe it was\r\nthen generally understood, should be politically in accord with the\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater number of suspensions, however, were made on\r\naccount of gross and indecent partizan conduct on the part of the\r\nincumbents. The preceding presidential campaign, it will be recalled,\r\nwas exceedingly bitter, and governmental officials then in place were\r\napparently so confident of the continued supremacy of their party that\r\nsome of them made no pretense of decent behavior. In numerous instances\r\nthe post-offices were made headquarters for local party committees and\r\norganizations and the centers of partizan scheming. Party literature\r\nfavorable to the postmasters’ party, that never passed regularly\r\nthrough the mails, was distributed through the post-offices as an item\r\nof party service, and matter of a political character, passing through\r\nthe mails in the usual course and addressed to patrons belonging to\r\nthe opposite party, was withheld; disgusting and irritating placards\r\nwere prominently displayed in many post-offices, and the attention\r\nof Democratic inquirers for mail matter was tauntingly directed to\r\nthem by the postmaster; and in various other ways postmasters and\r\nsimilar officials annoyed and vexed those holding opposite political\r\nopinions, who, in common with all having business at public offices,\r\nwere entitled to considerate and obliging treatment. In some quarters\r\nofficial incumbents neglected public duty to do political work,\r\nand especially in Southern States they frequently were not only\r\ninordinately active in questionable political work, but sought to do\r\nparty service by secret and sinister manipulation of colored voters,\r\nand by other practices inviting avoidable and dangerous collisions\r\nbetween the white and colored population.\r\n\r\nI mention these things in order that what I shall say later may be\r\nbetter understood. I by no means attempt to describe all the wrongdoing\r\nwhich formed the basis of many of the suspensions of officials that\r\nfollowed the inauguration of the new administration. I merely mention\r\nsome of the accusations which I recall as having been frequently made,\r\nby way of illustrating in a general way certain phases of pernicious\r\npartizanship that seemed to me to deserve prompt and decisive\r\ntreatment. Some suspensions, however, were made on proof of downright\r\nofficial malfeasance. Complaints against office-holders based on\r\npersonal transgression or partizan misconduct were usually made to\r\nthe Executive and to the heads of departments by means of letters,\r\nordinarily personal and confidential, and also often by means of verbal\r\ncommunications. Whatever papers, letters, or documents were received\r\non the subject, either by the President or by any head of department,\r\nwere, for convenience of reference, placed together on department\r\nfiles. These complaints were carefully examined; many were cast aside\r\nas frivolous or lacking support, while others, deemed of sufficient\r\ngravity and adequately established, resulted in the suspension of the\r\naccused officials.\r\n\r\nSuspensions instead of immediate removals were resorted to, because\r\nunder the law then existing it appeared to be the only way that\r\nduring a recess of the Senate an offending official could be ousted\r\nfrom his office, and his successor installed pending his nomination\r\nto the Senate at its next session. Though, as we have already seen,\r\nthe law permitted suspensions by the President “in his discretion,” I\r\nconsidered myself restrained by the pledges I had made from availing\r\nmyself of the discretion thus granted without reasons, and felt bound\r\nto make suspensions of officials having a definite term to serve, only\r\nfor adequate cause.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed further on that no resistance was then made to the\r\nlaws pertaining to executive removals and suspensions, on the ground\r\nof their unconstitutionality; but I have never believed that either\r\nthe law of 1867 or the law of 1869, when construed as permitting\r\ninterference with the freedom of the President in making removals,\r\nwould survive a judicial test of its constitutionality.\r\n\r\nWithin thirty days after the Senate met in December, 1885, the\r\nnominations of the persons who had been designated to succeed officials\r\nsuspended during the vacation were sent to that body for confirmation,\r\npursuant to existing statutes.\r\n\r\nIt was charged against me by the leader of the majority in the Senate\r\nthat these nominations of every kind and description, representing\r\nthe suspensions made within ten months succeeding the 4th of March,\r\n1885, numbered six hundred and forty-three. I have not verified this\r\nstatement, but I shall assume that it is correct. Among the officials\r\nsuspended there were two hundred and seventy-eight postmasters,\r\ntwenty-eight district attorneys, and twenty-four marshals, and among\r\nthose who held offices with no specified term there were sixty-one\r\ninternal-revenue officers and sixty-five consuls and other persons\r\nattached to the foreign service.\r\n\r\nIt was stated on the floor of the Senate, after it had been in session\r\nfor three months, that of the nominations submitted to that body to\r\nfill the places of suspended officials fifteen had been confirmed and\r\ntwo rejected.\r\n\r\nQuite early in the session frequent requests in writing began to issue\r\nfrom the different committees of the Senate to which these nominations\r\nwere referred, directed to the heads of the several departments having\r\nsupervision of the offices to which the nominations related, asking the\r\nreasons for the suspension of officers whose places it was proposed to\r\nfill by means of the nominations submitted, and for all papers on file\r\nin their departments which showed the reasons for such suspensions.\r\nThese requests foreshadowed what the senatorial construction of the\r\nlaw of 1869 might be, and indicated that the Senate, notwithstanding\r\nconstitutional limitations, and even in the face of the repeal of the\r\nstatutory provision giving it the right to pass upon suspensions by the\r\nPresident, was still inclined to insist, directly or indirectly, upon\r\nthat right. These requests, as I have said, emanated from committees of\r\nthe Senate, and were addressed to the heads of departments. As long as\r\nsuch requests were made by committees I had no opportunity to discuss\r\nthe questions growing out of such requests with the Senate itself,\r\nor to make known directly to that body the position on this subject\r\nwhich I felt bound to assert. Therefore the replies made to committees\r\nby the different heads of departments stated that by direction of\r\nthe President they declined furnishing the reasons and papers so\r\nrequested, on the ground that the public interest would not be thereby\r\npromoted, or on the ground that such reasons and papers related to a\r\npurely executive act. Whatever language was used in these replies,\r\nthey conveyed the information that the President had directed a denial\r\nof the requests made, because in his opinion the Senate could have no\r\nproper concern with the information sought to be obtained.\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss to mention here that while this was the position\r\nassumed by the Executive in relation to suspensions, all the\r\ninformation of any description in the possession of the Executive or in\r\nany of the departments, which would aid in determining the character\r\nand fitness of those nominated in place of suspended officials, was\r\ncheerfully and promptly furnished to the Senate or its committees when\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\nIn considering the requests made for the transmission of the reasons\r\nfor suspensions, and the papers relating thereto, I could not avoid the\r\nconviction that a compliance with such requests would be to that extent\r\na failure to protect and defend the Constitution, as well as a wrong to\r\nthe great office I held in trust for the people, and which I was bound\r\nto transmit unimpaired to my successors; nor could I be unmindful of a\r\ntendency in some quarters to encroach upon executive functions, or of\r\nthe eagerness with which executive concession would be seized upon as\r\nestablishing precedent.\r\n\r\nThe nominations sent to the Senate remained neglected in the committees\r\nto which they had been referred; the requests of the committees for\r\nreasons and papers touching suspensions were still refused, and it\r\nbecame daily more apparent that a sharp contest was impending. In\r\nthis condition of affairs it was plainly intimated by members of the\r\nmajority in the Senate that if all charges against suspended officials\r\nwere abandoned and their suspensions based entirely upon the ground\r\nthat the spoils belonged to the victors, confirmations would follow.\r\nThis, of course, from my standpoint, would have been untruthful and\r\ndishonest; but the suggestion indicated that in the minds of some\r\nSenators, at least, there was a determination to gain a partizan\r\nadvantage by discrediting the professions of the President, who, for\r\nthe time, represented the party they opposed. This manifestly could be\r\nthoroughly done by inducing him to turn his back upon the pledges he\r\nhad made, and to admit, for the sake of peace, that his action arose\r\nsolely from a desire to put his party friends in place.\r\n\r\nUp to this stage of the controversy, not one of the many requests made\r\nfor the reasons of suspensions or for the papers relating to them had\r\nbeen sent from the Senate itself; nor had any of them been addressed\r\nto the President. It may seem not only strange that, in the existing\r\ncircumstances, the Senate should have so long kept in the background,\r\nbut more strange that the Executive, constituting a coördinate branch\r\nof the Government, and having such exclusive concern in the pending\r\ndifferences, should have been so completely ignored. I cannot think\r\nit uncharitable to suggest in explanation that as long as these\r\nrequests and refusals were confined to Senate committees and heads\r\nof departments, a public communication stating the position of the\r\nPresident in the controversy would probably be avoided; and that, as\r\nwas subsequently made more apparent, there was an intent, in addressing\r\nrequests to the heads of departments, to lay a foundation for the\r\ncontention that not only the Senate but its committees had a right to\r\ncontrol these heads of departments as against the President in matters\r\nrelating to executive duty.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of July, 1885, during the recess of the Senate, one George\r\nM. Duskin was suspended from the office of District Attorney for the\r\nSouthern District of Alabama, and John D. Burnett was designated as\r\nhis successor. The latter at once took possession of the office, and\r\nentered upon the discharge of its duties; and on the 14th of December,\r\n1885, the Senate having in the meantime convened in regular session,\r\nthe nomination of Burnett was sent to that body for confirmation.\r\nThis nomination, pursuant to the rules and customs of the Senate, was\r\nreferred to its Committee on the Judiciary. On the 26th of December,\r\nthat committee then having the nomination under consideration, one of\r\nits members addressed a communication to the Attorney-General of the\r\nUnited States, requesting him, “on behalf of the Committee on the\r\nJudiciary of the Senate and by its direction,” to send to such member\r\nof the committee all papers and information in the possession of the\r\nDepartment of Justice touching the nomination of Burnett, “also all\r\npapers and information touching the suspension and proposed removal\r\nfrom office of George M. Duskin.” On the 11th of January, 1886, the\r\nAttorney-General responded to this request in these terms:\r\n\r\n    The Attorney-General states that he sends herewith all papers,\r\n    etc., touching the nomination referred to; and in reference to\r\n    the papers touching the suspension of Duskin from office, he\r\n    has as yet received no direction from the President in relation\r\n    to their transmission.\r\n\r\nAt this point it seems to have been decided for the first time that\r\nthe Senate itself should enter upon the scene as interrogator. It\r\nwas not determined, however, to invite the President to answer this\r\nnew interrogator, either for the protection and defense of his high\r\noffice or in self-vindication. It appears to have been also decided at\r\nthis time to give another form to the effort the Senate itself was to\r\nundertake to secure the “papers and information” which its Committee\r\nhad been unable to secure. In pursuance of this plan the following\r\nresolution was adopted by the Senate in executive session on the 25th\r\nof January, 1886:\r\n\r\n    Resolved, That the Attorney-General of the United States be,\r\n    and he hereby is, directed to transmit to the Senate copies of\r\n    all documents and papers that have been filed in the Department\r\n    of Justice since the 1st day of January, a.d. 1885, in relation\r\n    to the conduct of the office of District Attorney of the United\r\n    States for the Southern District of Alabama.\r\n\r\nThe language of this resolution is more adroit than ingenuous. While\r\nappearing reasonable and fair upon its face, and presenting no\r\nindication that it in any way related to a case of suspension, it\r\nquickly assumes its real complexion when examined in the light of\r\nits surroundings. The requests previously made on behalf of Senate\r\ncommittees had ripened into a “demand” by the Senate itself. Herein is\r\nfound support for the suggestion I have made, that from the beginning\r\nthere might have been an intent on the part of the Senate to claim\r\nthat the heads of departments, who are members of the President’s\r\nCabinet and his trusted associates and advisers, owed greater obedience\r\nto the Senate than to their executive chief in affairs which he\r\nand they regarded as exclusively within executive functions. As to\r\nthe real meaning and purpose of the resolution, a glance at its\r\naccompanying conditions and the incidents preceding it makes manifest\r\nthe insufficiency of its disguise. This resolution was adopted by the\r\nSenate in executive session, where the entire senatorial business done\r\nis the consideration of treaties and the confirmation of nominations\r\nfor office. At the time of its adoption Duskin had been suspended for\r\nmore than six months, his successor had for that length of time been\r\nin actual possession of the office, and this successor’s nomination\r\nwas then before the Senate in executive session for confirmation.\r\nThe demand was for copies of documents and papers in relation to the\r\nconduct of the office filed since January 1, 1885, thus covering a\r\nperiod of incumbency almost equally divided between the suspended\r\nofficer and the person nominated to succeed him. The documents and\r\npapers demanded could not have been of any possible use to the Senate\r\nin executive session, except as they had a bearing either upon the\r\nsuspension of the one or the nomination of the other. But as we have\r\nalready seen, the Attorney-General had previously sent to a committee\r\nof the Senate all the papers he had in his custody in any way relating\r\nto the nomination and the fitness of the nominee, whether such papers\r\nhad reference to the conduct of the office or otherwise. Excluding,\r\ntherefore, such documents and papers embraced in the demand as related\r\nto the pending nomination, and which had already been transmitted, it\r\nwas plain that there was nothing left with the Attorney-General that\r\ncould be included in the demand of the Senate in its executive session\r\nexcept what had reference to the conduct of the previous incumbent\r\nand his suspension. It is important to recall in this connection the\r\nfact that this subtle demand of the Senate for papers relating “to the\r\nconduct of the office” followed closely upon a failure to obtain “all\r\npapers and information” touching said suspension, in response to a\r\nplain and blunt request specifying precisely what was desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nI have referred to these matters because it seems to me they indicate\r\nthe animus and intent which characterized the first stages of a\r\ndiscussion that involved the rights and functions of the Executive\r\nbranch of the Government. It was perfectly apparent that the issue\r\nwas between the President and the Senate, and that the question\r\nconstituting that issue was whether or not the Executive was invested\r\nwith the right and power to suspend officials without the interference\r\nof the Senate or any accountability to that body for the reasons of\r\nhis action. It was also manifest if it was desired to deal with this\r\nissue directly and fairly, disembarrassed by any finesse for position,\r\nit could at any time have been easily done, if only one of the many\r\nrequests for reasons for suspensions, which were sent by committees of\r\nthe Senate to heads of departments, had been sent by the Senate itself\r\nto the President.\r\n\r\nWithin three days after the passage by the Senate, in executive\r\nsession, of the resolution directing the Attorney-General to\r\ntransmit to that body the documents and papers on file relating\r\nto the management and conduct of the office from which Mr. Duskin\r\nhad been removed, and to which Mr. Burnett had been nominated, the\r\nAttorney-General replied thereto as follows:\r\n\r\n    In response to the said resolution, the President of the\r\n    United States directs me to say that the papers that were in\r\n    this department relating to the fitness of John D. Burnett,\r\n    recently nominated to said office, having already been sent\r\n    to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and the papers and\r\n    documents which are mentioned in the said resolution, and still\r\n    remaining in the custody of this department, having exclusive\r\n    reference to the suspension by the President of George M.\r\n    Duskin, the late incumbent of the office of District Attorney\r\n    for the Southern District of Alabama, it is not considered that\r\n    the public interests will be promoted by a compliance with said\r\n    resolution and the transmission of the papers and documents\r\n    therein mentioned to the Senate in executive session.\r\n\r\nThis response of the Attorney-General was referred to the Senate\r\nCommittee on the Judiciary. Early in February, 1886, a majority of\r\nthe committee made a report to the Senate, in which it seems to have\r\nbeen claimed that all papers--whatever may be their personal, private,\r\nor confidential character--if placed on file, or, in other words, if\r\ndeposited in the office of the head of a department, became thereupon\r\nofficial papers, and that the Senate had therefore a right to their\r\ntransmittal when they had reference to the conduct of a suspended\r\nofficial, and when that body had under advisement the confirmation of\r\nhis proposed successor. Much stress was laid upon the professions made\r\nby the President of his adherence to Civil Service reform methods, and\r\nit was broadly hinted that, in the face of six hundred and forty-three\r\nsuspensions from office, these professions could hardly be sincere.\r\nInstances were cited in which papers and information had been demanded\r\nand furnished in previous administrations, and these were claimed to\r\nbe precedents in favor of the position assumed by the majority of the\r\ncommittee. Almost at the outset of the report it was declared:\r\n\r\n    The important question, then, is whether it is within the\r\n    constitutional competence of either House of Congress to have\r\n    access to the official papers and documents in the various\r\n    public offices of the United States, created by laws enacted by\r\n    themselves.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the majority recommended the adoption by the Senate of\r\nthe following resolutions:\r\n\r\n    Resolved, That the Senate hereby expresses its condemnation of\r\n    the refusal of the Attorney-General, under whatever influence,\r\n    to send to the Senate copies of papers called for by its\r\n    resolution of the 25th of January and set forth in the report\r\n    of the Committee on the Judiciary, as in violation of his\r\n    official duty and subversive of the fundamental principles of\r\n    the Government, and of a good administration thereof.\r\n\r\n    Resolved, That it is under these circumstances the duty of the\r\n    Senate to refuse its advice and consent to proposed removals of\r\n    officers, the documents and papers in reference to the supposed\r\n    official or personal misconduct of whom are withheld by the\r\n    Executive or any head of a department when deemed necessary by\r\n    the Senate and called for in considering the matter.\r\n\r\n    Resolved, That the provision of Section 1754 of the Revised\r\n    Statutes, declaring that persons honorably discharged from the\r\n    military or naval service by reason of disability resulting\r\n    from wounds or sickness incurred in the line of duty shall be\r\n    preferred for appointment to civil offices provided they are\r\n    found to possess the business capacity necessary for the proper\r\n    discharge of the duties of such offices, ought to be faithfully\r\n    and fully put in execution, and that to remove or to propose\r\n    to remove any such soldier whose faithfulness, competency, and\r\n    character are above reproach, and to give place to another who\r\n    has not rendered such service, is a violation of the spirit\r\n    of the law and of the practical gratitude the people and\r\n    the Government of the United States owe to the defenders of\r\n    constitutional liberty and the integrity of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe first of these resolutions contains charges which, if true,\r\nshould clearly furnish grounds for the impeachment of the\r\nAttorney-General--if not the President under whose “influence” he\r\nconcededly refused to submit the papers demanded by the Senate. A\r\npublic officer whose acts are “in violation of his official duty\r\nand subversive of the fundamental principles of the Government, and\r\nof a good administration thereof,” can scarcely add anything to his\r\npredicament of guilt.\r\n\r\nThe second resolution has the merit of honesty in confessing that the\r\nintent and object of the demand upon the Attorney-General was to secure\r\nthe demanded papers and documents for the purpose of passing upon the\r\nPresident’s reasons for suspension. Beyond this, the declaration it\r\ncontains, that it was the “duty of the Senate to refuse its advice\r\nand consent to proposed removals of officers” when the papers and\r\ndocuments relating to their “supposed official or personal misconduct”\r\nwere withheld, certainly obliged the Senate, if the resolution should\r\nbe adopted, and if the good faith of that body in the controversy\r\nshould be assumed, to reject or ignore all nominations made to succeed\r\nsuspended officers unless the documents and papers upon which the\r\nsuspension was based were furnished and the Senate was thus given an\r\nopportunity to review and reverse or confirm the President’s executive\r\nact, resting, by the very terms of existing law, “in his discretion.”\r\n\r\nThe third resolution is grandly phrased, and its sentiment is\r\npatriotic, noble, and inspiriting. Inasmuch, however, as the removal of\r\nveteran soldiers from office did not seem to assume any considerable\r\nprominence in the arraignment of the administration, the object of the\r\nresolution is slightly obscure, unless, as was not unusual in those\r\ndays, the cause of the old soldier was impressed into the service of\r\nthe controversy for purposes of general utility.\r\n\r\nA minority report was subsequently submitted, signed by all the\r\nDemocratic members of the committee, in which the allegations of the\r\nmajority report were sharply controverted. It was therein positively\r\nasserted that no instance could be found in the practice of the\r\nGovernment whose similarity in its essential features entitled it\r\nto citation as an authoritative precedent; and that neither the\r\nConstitution nor the existing law afforded any justification for the\r\naction of the Senate in the promises.\r\n\r\nThese two reports, of course, furnished abundant points of controversy.\r\nAbout the time of their submission, moreover, another document was\r\naddressed to the Senate, which, whatever else may be said of it, seems\r\nto have contributed considerably to the spirit and animation of the\r\ndiscussion that ensued. This was a message from the President, in which\r\nhis position concerning the matter in dispute was defined. In this\r\ncommunication the complete and absolute responsibility of the President\r\nfor all suspensions and the fact that the Executive had been afforded\r\nno opportunity to speak for himself was stated in the following terms:\r\n\r\n    Though these suspensions are my executive acts based upon\r\n    considerations addressed to me alone, and for which I am wholly\r\n    responsible, I have had no invitation from the Senate to\r\n    state the position which I have felt constrained to assume in\r\n    relation to the same, or to interpret for myself my acts and\r\n    motives in the premises. In this condition of affairs I have\r\n    forborne addressing the Senate upon the subject, lest I might\r\n    be accused of thrusting myself unbidden upon the attention of\r\n    that body.\r\n\r\nThis statement was accompanied by the expression of a hope that the\r\nmisapprehension of the Executive position, indicated in the majority\r\nreport just presented and published, might excuse his then submitting\r\na communication. He commented upon the statement in the report\r\nthat “the important question, then, is whether it is within the\r\nconstitutional competence of either House of Congress to have access\r\nto the official papers and documents in the various public offices\r\nof the United States, created by laws enacted by themselves,” by\r\nsuggesting that though public officials of the United States might be\r\ncreated by laws enacted by the two Houses of Congress, this fact did\r\nnot necessarily subject their offices to congressional control, but,\r\non the contrary, that “these instrumentalities were created for the\r\nbenefit of the people, and to answer the general purposes of government\r\nunder the Constitution and the laws; and that they are unencumbered by\r\nany lien in favor of either branch of Congress growing out of their\r\nconstruction, and unembarrassed by any obligation to the Senate as the\r\nprice of their creation.” While not conceding that the Senate had in\r\nany case the right to review Executive action in suspending officials,\r\nthe President disclaimed any intention to withhold official papers\r\nand documents when requested; and as to such papers and documents, he\r\nexpressed his willingness, because they were official, to continue, as\r\nhe had theretofore done in all cases, to lay them before the Senate\r\nwithout inquiry as to the use to be made of them, and relying upon\r\nthe Senate for their legitimate utilization. The proposition was\r\nexpressly denied, however, that papers and documents inherently private\r\nor confidential, addressed to the President or a head of department,\r\nhaving reference to an act so entirely executive in its nature as the\r\nsuspension of an official, and which was by the Constitution as well\r\nas by existing law placed within the discretion of the President, were\r\nchanged in their nature and instantly became official when placed for\r\nconvenience or for other reasons in the custody of a public department.\r\nThe contention of the President was thus stated:\r\n\r\n    There is no mysterious power of transmutation in departmental\r\n    custody, nor is there magic in the undefined and sacred\r\n    solemnity of departmental files. If the presence of these\r\n    papers in the public office is a stumbling-block in the way of\r\n    the performance of senatorial duty, it can be easily removed.\r\n\r\nThe Senate’s purposes were characterized in the message as follows:\r\n\r\n    The requests and demands which by the score have for nearly\r\n    three months been presented to the different departments of\r\n    the Government, whatever may be their form, have but one\r\n    complexion. They assume the right of the Senate to sit in\r\n    judgment upon the exercise of my exclusive discretion and\r\n    Executive function, for which I am solely responsible to the\r\n    people from whom I have so lately received the sacred trust of\r\n    office. My oath to support and defend the Constitution, my duty\r\n    to the people who have chosen me to execute the powers of their\r\n    great office and not relinquish them, and my duty to the chief\r\n    magistracy which I must preserve unimpaired in all its dignity\r\n    and vigor, compel me to refuse compliance with these demands.\r\n\r\nThis was immediately supplemented by the following concession of\r\nthe independent and unlimited power of the Senate in the matter of\r\nconfirmation:\r\n\r\n    To the end that the service may be improved, the Senate is\r\n    invited to the fullest scrutiny of the persons submitted to\r\n    them for public office, in recognition of the constitutional\r\n    power of that body to advise and consent to their appointment.\r\n    I shall continue, as I have thus far done, to furnish, at the\r\n    request of the confirming body, all the information I possess\r\n    touching the fitness of the nominees placed before them for\r\n    their action, both when they are proposed to fill vacancies\r\n    and to take the place of suspended officials. Upon a refusal\r\n    to confirm, I shall not assume the right to ask the reasons\r\n    for the action of the Senate nor question its determination. I\r\n    cannot think that anything more is required to secure worthy\r\n    incumbents in public office than a careful and independent\r\n    discharge of our respective duties within their well-defined\r\n    limits.\r\n\r\nAs it was hardly concealed that by no means the least important\r\nsenatorial purpose in the pending controversy was to discredit the\r\nCivil Service reform pledges and professions of the Executive, this\r\nissue was thus distinctly invited at the close of the message:\r\n\r\n    Every pledge I have made by which I have placed a limitation\r\n    upon my exercise of executive power has been faithfully\r\n    redeemed. Of course the pretense is not put forth that no\r\n    mistakes have been committed; but not a suspension has been\r\n    made except it appeared to my satisfaction that the public\r\n    welfare would be promoted thereby. Many applications for\r\n    suspension have been denied, and an adherence to the rule laid\r\n    down to govern my action as to such suspensions has caused\r\n    much irritation and impatience on the part of those who have\r\n    insisted upon more changes in the offices.\r\n\r\n    The pledges I have made were made to the people, and to them I\r\n    am responsible for the manner in which they have been redeemed.\r\n    I am not responsible to the Senate, and I am unwilling to\r\n    submit my actions and official conduct to them for judgment.\r\n\r\n    There are no grounds for an allegation that the fear of being\r\n    found false to my professions influences me in declining to\r\n    submit to the demands of the Senate. I have not constantly\r\n    refused to suspend officials and thus incurred the displeasure\r\n    of political friends, and yet wilfully broken faith with the\r\n    people, for the sake of being false to them.\r\n\r\n    Neither the discontent of party friends nor the allurements,\r\n    constantly offered, of confirmation of appointees conditioned\r\n    upon the avowal that suspensions have been made on party\r\n    grounds alone, nor the threat proposed in the resolutions now\r\n    before the Senate that no confirmation will be made unless\r\n    the demands of that body be complied with, are sufficient to\r\n    discourage or deter me from following in the way which I am\r\n    convinced leads to better government for the people.\r\n\r\nThe temper and disposition of the Senate may be correctly judged, I\r\nthink, from the remarks made upon the presentation of this message by\r\nthe chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary and the acknowledged\r\nleader of the majority. On a formal motion that the message be printed\r\nand lie upon the table, he moved as an amendment that it be referred to\r\nthe committee of which he was chairman, and said:\r\n\r\n    I merely wish to remark, in moving to refer this document to\r\n    the Committee on the Judiciary, that it very vividly brought to\r\n    my mind the communications of King Charles I to the Parliament,\r\n    telling them what, in conducting their affairs, they ought to\r\n    do and ought not to do; and I think I am safe in saying that\r\n    it is the first time in the history of the republican United\r\n    States that any President of the United States has undertaken\r\n    to interfere with the deliberations of either House of Congress\r\n    on questions pending before them, otherwise than by messages\r\n    on the state of the Union which the Constitution commands him\r\n    to make from time to time. This message is devoted simply to\r\n    a question for the Senate itself, in regard to itself, that\r\n    it has under consideration. That is its singularity. I think\r\n    it will strike reflecting people in this country as somewhat\r\n    extraordinary--if in this day of reform anything at all can be\r\n    thought extraordinary.\r\n\r\nKing Charles I fared badly at the hands of the Parliament; but it was\r\nmost reassuring to know that, after all said and done, the Senate of\r\nthe United States was not a bloodthirsty body, and that the chairman\r\nof its Committee on the Judiciary was one of the most courteous and\r\namiable of men--at least when outside of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe debate upon the questions presented by the report and resolutions\r\nrecommended by the majority of the committee, and by the minority\r\nreport and the presidential message, occupied almost exclusively the\r\nsessions of the Senate for over two weeks. More than twenty-five\r\nSenators participated, and the discussion covered such a wide range of\r\nargument that all considerations relevant to the subject, and some not\r\nclearly related to it, seem to have been presented. At the close of the\r\ndebate, the resolution condemning the Attorney-General for withholding\r\nthe papers and documents which the Senate had demanded was passed by\r\nthirty-two votes in the affirmative and twenty-five in the negative;\r\nthe next resolution, declaring it to be the duty of the Senate to\r\nrefuse its advice and consent to proposed removals of officers when\r\npapers and documents in reference to their alleged misconduct were\r\nwithheld, was adopted by a majority of only a single vote; and the\r\nproclamation contained in the third resolution, setting forth the\r\nobligations of the Government and its people to the veterans of the\r\ncivil war, was unanimously approved, except for one dissenting voice.\r\n\r\nThe controversy thus closed arose from the professed anxiety of the\r\nmajority in the Senate to guard the interests of an official who was\r\nsuspended from office in July, 1885, and who was still claimed to be in\r\na condition of suspension. In point of fact, however, that official’s\r\nterm of office expired by limitation on the 20th of December,\r\n1885--before the demand for papers and documents relating to his\r\nconduct in office was made, before the resolutions and reports of the\r\nCommittee on the Judiciary were presented, and before the commencement\r\nof the long discussion in defense of the right of a suspended\r\nincumbent. This situation escaped notice in Executive quarters, because\r\nthe appointee to succeed the suspended officer having been actually\r\ninstalled and in the discharge of the duties of the position for more\r\nthan six months, and his nomination having been sent to the Senate\r\nvery soon after the beginning of its session, the situation or duration\r\nof the former incumbent’s term was not kept in mind. The expiration of\r\nhis term was, however, distinctly alleged in the Senate on the second\r\nday of the discussion, and by the first speaker in opposition to the\r\nmajority report. The question of suspension or removal was therefore\r\neliminated from the case and the discussion as related to the person\r\nsuspended continued as a sort of post-mortem proceeding. Shortly\r\nafter the resolutions of the committee were passed, the same person\r\nwho superseded the suspended and defunct officer was again nominated\r\nto succeed him by reason of the expiration of his term; and this\r\nnomination was confirmed.\r\n\r\nAt last, after stormy weather, Duskin, the suspended, and Burnett, his\r\nsuccessor, were at rest. The earnest contention that beat about their\r\nnames ceased, and no shout of triumph disturbed the supervening quiet.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nI have thus attempted, after fourteen years of absolute calm, to\r\nrecount the prominent details of the strife; and I hope that interest\r\nin the subject is still sufficient to justify me in a further brief\r\nreference to some features of the dispute and certain incidents that\r\nfollowed it, which may aid to a better appreciation of its true\r\ncharacter and motive.\r\n\r\nOf the elaborate speeches made in support of the resolutions and the\r\ncommittee’s majority report, seven dealt more or less prominently\r\nwith the President’s Civil Service reform professions and his pledges\r\nagainst the removal of officials on purely partizan grounds. It seems\r\nto have been assumed that these pledges had been violated. At any rate,\r\nwithout any evidence worthy of the name, charges of such violation\r\nranged all the way from genteel insinuation to savage accusation.\r\nSenators who would have stoutly refused to vote for the spoils system\r\nbroadly intimated or openly declared that if suspensions had been\r\nmade confessedly on partizan grounds they would have interposed no\r\nopposition. The majority seem to have especially admired and applauded\r\nthe antics of one of their number, who, in intervals of lurid and\r\nindiscriminate vituperation, gleefully mingled ridicule for Civil\r\nService reform with praise of the forbidding genius of partizan spoils.\r\nIn view of these deliverances and as bearing upon their relevancy,\r\nas well as indicating their purpose, let me again suggest that the\r\nissue involved in the discussion as selected by the majority of the\r\nCommittee on the Judiciary, and distinctly declared in their report,\r\nwas whether, as a matter of right, or, as the report expresses it, as\r\nwithin “constitutional competence,” either House of Congress should\r\n“have access to the official papers and documents in the various public\r\noffices of the United States, created by laws enacted by themselves.”\r\nIt will be readily seen that if the question was one of senatorial\r\nright, the President’s Civil Service reform pledges had no honest or\r\nlegitimate place in the discussion.\r\n\r\nThe debate and the adoption of the resolutions reported by the\r\ncommittee caused no surrender of the Executive position. Nevertheless,\r\nconfirmations of those nominated in place of suspended officers soon\r\nbegan, and I cannot recall any further embarrassment or difficulty\r\non that score. I ought to add, however, that in many cases, at least,\r\nthese confirmations were accompanied by reports from the committee\r\nto which they had been referred, stating that the late incumbent had\r\nbeen suspended for “political reasons,” or on account of “offensive\r\npartizanship,” or for a like reason, differently expressed, and that\r\nnothing was alleged against them affecting their personal character.\r\nIf the terms thus used by the committee in designating causes for\r\nsuspension mean that the persons suspended were guilty of offensive\r\npartizanship or political offenses, as distinguished from personal\r\noffenses and moral or official delinquencies, I am satisfied with the\r\nstatement. And here it occurs to me to suggest that if offenses and\r\nmoral or official delinquencies, not partizan in their nature, had\r\nexisted, they would have been subjects for official inspection and\r\nreport, and such reports, being official documents, would have been\r\nsubmitted to the committee or to the Senate, according to custom, and\r\nwould have told their own story and excluded committee comment.\r\n\r\nIt is worth recalling, when referring to committee reports on\r\nnomination, that they belong to the executive business of the Senate,\r\nand are, therefore, among the secrets of that body. Those I have\r\nmentioned, nevertheless, were by special order made public, and\r\npublished in the proceedings of the Senate in open session. This\r\nextraordinary, if not unprecedented, action, following long after\r\nthe conclusion of the dispute, easily interprets its own intent, and\r\nremoves all covering from a design to accomplish partizan advantage.\r\nThe declaration of the resolutions that it was the duty of the Senate\r\n“to refuse its advice and consent to the proposed removal of officers”\r\nwhen the papers and documents relating to their supposed misconduct\r\nwere withheld, was abandoned, and the irrevocable removal of such\r\nofficers by confirmation of their successors was entered upon, with or\r\nwithout the much-desired papers and documents, and was supplemented by\r\nthe publication of committee reports, from which the secrecy of the\r\nexecutive session had been removed, to the end that, pursuant to a\r\nfixed determination, an unfavorable senatorial interpretation might be\r\npublicly given to the President’s action in making suspensions.\r\n\r\nI desire to call attention to one other incident connected with the\r\noccurrences already narrated. On the 14th of December, 1885,--prior to\r\nthe first request or demand upon any executive department relating\r\nto suspensions, and of course before any controversy upon the subject\r\narose,--a bill was introduced in the Senate by one of the most\r\ndistinguished and able members of the majority in that body, and also\r\na member of its Committee on the Judiciary, for the total and complete\r\nrepeal of the law of 1869, which, it will be remembered, furnished the\r\nbasis for the contention we have considered. This repealing bill was\r\nreferred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, where it slumbered\r\nuntil the 21st of June, 1886,--nearly three months after the close of\r\nthe contention,--when it was returned to the Senate with a favorable\r\nreport, the chairman of the committee alone dissenting. When the bill\r\nwas presented for discussion, the Senator who introduced it explained\r\nits object as follows:\r\n\r\n    This bill repeals what is left of what is called the Tenure of\r\n    Office act, passed under the administration of Andrew Johnson,\r\n    and as a part of the contest with that President. It leaves\r\n    the law as it was from the beginning of the Government until\r\n    that time, and it repeals the provision which authorizes the\r\n    suspension of civil officers and requires the submission of\r\n    that suspension to the Senate.\r\n\r\nOn a later day, in discussing the bill, he said, after referring to the\r\nearly date of its introduction:\r\n\r\n    It did not seem to me to be quite becoming to ask the Senate to\r\n    deal with this general question while the question which arose\r\n    between the President and the Senate as to the interpretation\r\n    and administration of the existing law was pending. I thought\r\n    as a party man that I had hardly the right to interfere with\r\n    the matter which was under the special charge of my honorable\r\n    friend from Vermont, by challenging a debate upon the general\r\n    subject from a different point of view. This question has\r\n    subsided and is past, and it seems to me now proper to ask the\r\n    Senate to vote upon the question whether it will return to the\r\n    ancient policy of the Government, to the rule of public conduct\r\n    which existed from 1789 until 1867, and which has practically\r\n    existed, notwithstanding the condition of the statute-book,\r\n    since the accession to power of General Grant on the 4th of\r\n    March, 1869.\r\n\r\nThe personnel of the committee which reported favorably upon this\r\nrepealing bill had not been changed since all the members of it\r\npolitically affiliating with the majority in the Senate joined in\r\nrecommending the accusatory report and resolutions, which, when\r\nadopted, after sharp and irritating discussion, caused the question\r\nbetween the President and the Senate, in the language of the introducer\r\nof the repealing bill, to “subside.”\r\n\r\nThis repealing act passed the Senate on the 17th of December, 1886, by\r\nthirty affirmative votes against twenty-two in the negative. A short\r\ntime afterward it passed in the House of Representatives by a majority\r\nof one hundred and five.\r\n\r\nThus was an unpleasant controversy happily followed by an expurgation\r\nof the last pretense of statutory sanction to an encroachment upon\r\nconstitutional Executive prerogatives, and thus was a time-honored\r\ninterpretation of the Constitution restored to us. The President, freed\r\nfrom the Senate’s claim of tutelage, became again the independent agent\r\nof the people, representing a coördinate branch of their Government,\r\ncharged with responsibilities which, under his oath, he ought not\r\nto avoid or divide with others, and invested with powers, not to be\r\nsurrendered, but to be used, under the guidance of patriotic intention\r\nand an unclouded conscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNMENT IN THE CHICAGO STRIKE OF 1894\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe President inaugurated on the fourth day of March, 1893, and\r\nthose associated with him as Cabinet officials, encountered, during\r\ntheir term of executive duty, unusual and especially perplexing\r\ndifficulties. The members of that administration who still survive,\r\nin recalling the events of this laborious service, cannot fail to fix\r\nupon the years 1894 and 1895 as the most troublous and anxious of\r\ntheir incumbency. During those years unhappy currency complications\r\ncompelled executive resort to heroic treatment for the preservation of\r\nour nation’s financial integrity, and forced upon the administration a\r\nconstant, unrelenting struggle for sound money; a long and persistent\r\nexecutive effort to accomplish beneficent and satisfactory tariff\r\nreform so nearly miscarried as to bring depression and disappointment\r\nto the verge of discouragement; and it was at the close of the year\r\n1895 that executive insistence upon the Monroe Doctrine culminated\r\nin a situation that gave birth to solemn thoughts of war. Without\r\nattempting to complete the list of troubles and embarrassments that\r\nbeset the administration during these luckless years, I have reserved\r\nfor separate and more detailed treatment one of its incidents not yet\r\nmentioned, which immensely increased executive anxiety and foreboded\r\nthe most calamitous and far-reaching consequences.\r\n\r\nIn the last days of June, 1894, a very determined and ugly labor\r\ndisturbance broke out in the city of Chicago. Almost in a night it grew\r\nto full proportions of malevolence and danger. Rioting and violence\r\nwere its early accompaniments; and it spread so swiftly that within\r\na few days it had reached nearly the entire Western and Southwestern\r\nsections of our country. Railroad transportation was especially\r\ninvolved in its attacks. The carriage of United States mails was\r\ninterrupted, interstate commerce was obstructed, and railroad property\r\nwas riotously destroyed.\r\n\r\nThis disturbance is often called “The Chicago Strike.” It is true that\r\nits beginning was in that city; and the headquarters of those who\r\ninaugurated it and directed its operations were located there; but the\r\nname thus given to it is an entire misnomer so far as it applies to the\r\nscope and reach of the trouble. Railroad operations were more or less\r\naffected in twenty-seven States and Territories; and in all these the\r\ninterposition of the general Government was to a greater or less extent\r\ninvoked.\r\n\r\nThis wide-spread trouble had its inception in a strike by the employees\r\nof the Pullman Palace Car Company, a corporation located and doing\r\nbusiness at the town of Pullman, which is within the limits of the city\r\nof Chicago. This company was a manufacturing corporation--or at least\r\nit was not a railroad corporation. Its main object was the operation\r\nand running of sleeping- and parlor-cars upon railroads under written\r\ncontracts; but its charter contemplated the manufacture of cars as\r\nwell; and soon after its incorporation it began the manufacture of its\r\nown cars and, subsequently, the manufacture of cars for the general\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThe strike on the part of the employees of this company began on the\r\neleventh day of May, 1894, and was provoked by a reduction of wages.\r\n\r\nThe American Railway Union was organized in the summer of 1893.\r\nIt was professedly an association of all the different classes of\r\nrailway employees. In its scope and intent it was the most compact\r\nand effective organization of the kind ever attempted. Its purpose\r\nwas a thorough unification of defensive and offensive effort among\r\nrailway employees under one central direction, and the creation of\r\na combination embracing all such employees, which should make the\r\ngrievances of any section of its membership a common cause. Those\r\nprominent in this project estimated that various other organizations\r\nof railroad employees then existing had a membership of 102,000 in\r\nthe United States and neighboring countries; and they claimed that\r\nthese brotherhoods, because of divided councils and for other reasons,\r\nwere ineffective, and that nearly 1,000,000 railroad employees still\r\nremained unorganized.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful growth of this new combination is made apparent by the\r\nfact that between the month of August, 1893, and the time it became\r\ninvolved in the Pullman strike, in June, 1894, it had enrolled nearly\r\n150,000 members.\r\n\r\nThe employees of the Pullman Palace Car Company could not on any\r\nreasonable and consistent theory be regarded as eligible to membership\r\nin an organization devoted to the interests of railway employees; and\r\nyet, during the months of March, April, and May, 1894, it appears that\r\nnearly 4000 of these employees were enrolled in the American Railway\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThis, to say the least of it, was an exceedingly unfortunate\r\nproceeding, since it created a situation which implicated in a\r\ncomparatively insignificant quarrel between the managers of an\r\nindustrial establishment and their workmen the large army of the\r\nRailway Union. It was the membership of these workmen in the Railway\r\nUnion, and the union’s consequent assumption of their quarrel, that\r\ngave it the proportions of a tremendous disturbance, paralyzing the\r\nmost important business interests, obstructing the functions of the\r\nGovernment, and disturbing social peace and order....\r\n\r\nNo injury to the property of the Pullman Palace Car Company was done or\r\nattempted while the strike was confined to its employees; and during\r\nthat time very little disorder of any kind occurred.\r\n\r\nIt so happened, however, that in June, 1894, after the strike at\r\nPullman had continued for about one month, a regular stated convention\r\nof the American Railway Union was held in the city of Chicago, which\r\nwas attended by delegates from local branches of the organization in\r\ndifferent States, as well as by representatives of its members among\r\nthe employees of the Pullman Palace Car Company. At this convention the\r\ntrouble at Pullman was considered, and after earnest efforts on the\r\npart of the Railway Union to bring about a settlement, a resolution\r\nwas, on the twenty-second day of June, passed by the convention,\r\ndeclaring that unless the Pullman Palace Car Company should adjust the\r\ngrievances of its employees before noon of the twenty-sixth day of\r\nJune, the members of the American Railway Union would, after that date,\r\nrefuse to handle Pullman cars and equipment.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-sixth day of June arrived without any change in the attitude\r\nof the parties to the Pullman controversy; and thereupon the order made\r\nby the American Railway Union forbidding the handling of Pullman cars,\r\nbecame operative throughout its entire membership.\r\n\r\nAt this time the Pullman Palace Car Company was furnishing drawing-room\r\nand sleeping-car accommodations to the traveling public under contracts\r\nwith numerous railway companies, and was covering by this service\r\nabout one hundred and twenty-five thousand miles of railway, or\r\napproximately three fourths of all the railroad mileage of the country.\r\nThe same railroad companies which had contracted to use these Pullman\r\ncars upon their lines had contracts with the United States Government\r\nfor the carriage of mails, and were, of course, also largely engaged\r\nin interstate commerce. It need hardly be said that, of necessity, the\r\ntrains on which the mails were carried and which served the purpose of\r\ninterstate commerce were, very generally, those to which the Pullman\r\ncars were also attached.\r\n\r\nThe president of the Railway Union was one Eugene V. Debs. In a sworn\r\nstatement afterward made he gave the following description of the\r\nresults of the interference of the union in the Pullman dispute:\r\n\r\n    The employees, obedient to the order of the convention, at\r\n    once, on the 26th, refused to haul Pullman cars. The switchmen,\r\n    in the first place, refused to attach a Pullman car to a train,\r\n    and that is where the trouble began; and then, when a switchman\r\n    would be discharged for that, they would all simultaneously\r\n    quit, as they had agreed to do. One department after another\r\n    was involved until the Illinois Central was practically\r\n    paralyzed, and the Rock Island and other roads in their turn.\r\n    Up to the first day of July, or after the strike had been in\r\n    progress five days, the railway managers, as we believe, were\r\n    completely defeated. Their immediate resources were exhausted,\r\n    their properties were paralyzed, and they were unable to\r\n    operate their trains. Our men were intact at every point, firm,\r\n    quiet, and yet determined, and no sign of violence or disorder\r\n    anywhere. That was the condition on the thirtieth day of June\r\n    and the first day of July.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Railway Union from their headquarters in the city\r\nof Chicago gave directions for the maintenance and management of the\r\nstrike, which were quickly transmitted to distant railroad points and\r\nwere there promptly executed. As early as the 28th of June, two days\r\nafter the beginning of the strike ordered by the Railway Union at\r\nChicago, information was received at Washington from the Post-Office\r\nDepartment that on the Southern Pacific System, between Portland\r\nand San Francisco, Ogden and San Francisco, and Los Angeles and San\r\nFrancisco, the mails were completely obstructed, and that the strikers\r\nrefused to permit trains to which Pullman cars were attached to run\r\nover the lines mentioned. Thereupon Attorney-General Olney immediately\r\nsent the following telegraphic despatch to the United States district\r\nattorneys in the State of California:\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, D. C., June 28, 1894.\r\n\r\n    See that the passage of regular trains, carrying United States\r\n    mails in the usual and ordinary way, as contemplated by the\r\n    act of Congress and directed by the Postmaster-General, is not\r\n    obstructed. Procure warrants or any other available process\r\n    from United States courts against any and all persons engaged\r\n    in such obstructions, and direct the marshal to execute the\r\n    same by such number of deputies or such posse as may be\r\n    necessary.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, and during a number of days immediately following,\r\ncomplaints of a similar character, sometimes accompanied by charges\r\nof forcible seizure of trains and other violent disorders, poured in\r\nupon the Attorney-General from all parts of the West and Southwest.\r\nThese complaints came from post-office officials, from United States\r\nmarshals and district attorneys, from railroad managers, and from\r\nother officials and private citizens. In all cases of substantial\r\nrepresentation of interference with the carriage of mails, a despatch\r\nidentical with that already quoted was sent by the Attorney-General to\r\nthe United States district attorneys in the disturbed localities; and\r\nthis was supplemented, whenever necessary, by such other prompt action\r\nas the different emergencies required.\r\n\r\nI shall not enter upon an enumeration of all the disorders and\r\nviolence, the defiance of law and authority, and the obstructions of\r\nnational functions and duties, which occurred in many localities as\r\na consequence of this labor contention, thus tremendously reinforced\r\nand completely under way. It is my especial purpose to review the\r\naction taken by the Government for the maintenance of its own authority\r\nand the protection of the interests intrusted to its keeping, so far\r\nas they were endangered by this disturbance; and I do not intend to\r\nspecifically deal with the incidents of the strike except in so far as\r\na reference to them may be necessary to show conditions which not only\r\njustified but actually obliged the Government to resort to stern and\r\nunusual measures in the assertion of its prerogatives.\r\n\r\nInasmuch, therefore, as the city of Chicago was the birthplace of the\r\ndisturbance and the home of its activities, and because it was the\r\nfield of its most pronounced and malign manifestations, as well as the\r\nplace of its final extinction, I shall meet the needs of my subject\r\nif I supplement what has been already said by a recital of events\r\noccurring at this central point. In doing this, I shall liberally\r\nembody documents, orders, instructions, and reports which I hope will\r\nnot prove tiresome, since they supply the facts I desire to present,\r\nat first hand and more impressively than they could be presented by any\r\nwords of mine.\r\n\r\nOwing to the enforced relationship of Chicago to the strike which\r\nstarted within its borders, and because of its importance as a center\r\nof railway traffic, Government officials at Washington were not\r\nsurprised by the early and persistent complaints of mail and interstate\r\ncommerce obstructions which reached them from that city. It was from\r\nthe first anticipated that this would be the seat of the most serious\r\ncomplications, and the place where the strong arm of the law would\r\nbe most needed. In these circumstances it would have been a criminal\r\nneglect of duty if those charged with the protection of governmental\r\nagencies and the enforcement of orderly obedience and submission to\r\nFederal authority, had been remiss in preparations for any emergency in\r\nthat quarter.\r\n\r\nOn the thirtieth day of June the district attorney at Chicago reported\r\nby telegraph that mail trains in the suburbs of Chicago were, on the\r\nprevious night, stopped by strikers, that an engine had been cut off\r\nand disabled, and that conditions were growing more and more likely\r\nto culminate in the stoppage of all trains; and he recommended that\r\nthe marshal be authorized to employ a force of special deputies who\r\nshould be placed on trains to protect mails and detect the parties\r\nguilty of such interference. In reply to this despatch Attorney-General\r\nOlney on the same day authorized the marshal to employ additional\r\ndeputies as suggested, and designated Edwin Walker, an able and\r\nprominent attorney in Chicago, as special counsel for the Government,\r\nto assist the district attorney in any legal proceedings that might\r\nbe instituted. He also notified the district attorney of the steps\r\nthus taken, and enjoined upon him that “action ought to be prompt and\r\nvigorous,” and also directed him to confer with the special counsel\r\nwho had been employed. In a letter of the same date addressed to this\r\nspecial counsel, the Attorney-General, in making suggestions concerning\r\nlegal proceedings, wrote: “It has seemed to me that if the rights of\r\nthe United States were vigorously asserted in Chicago, the origin and\r\ncenter of the demonstration, the result would be to make it a failure\r\neverywhere else, and to prevent its spread over the entire country”;\r\nand in that connection he indicated that it might be advisable,\r\ninstead of relying entirely upon warrants issued under criminal\r\nstatutes against persons actually guilty of the offense of obstructing\r\nUnited States mails, to apply to the courts for injunctions which\r\nwould restrain and prevent any attempt to commit such offense. This\r\nsuggestion contemplated the inauguration of legal proceedings in a\r\nregular and usual way to restrain those prominently concerned in the\r\ninterference with the mails and the obstruction of interstate commerce,\r\nbasing such proceedings on the proposition that, under the Constitution\r\nand laws, these subjects were in the exclusive care of the Government\r\nof the United States, and that for their protection the Federal\r\ncourts were competent under general principles of law to intervene by\r\ninjunction; and on the further ground that under an act of Congress,\r\npassed July 2, 1890, conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce\r\namong the several States were declared to be illegal, and the circuit\r\ncourts of the United States were therein expressly given jurisdiction\r\nto prevent and restrain such conspiracies.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of July the district attorney reported to the\r\nAttorney-General that he was preparing a bill of complaint to be\r\npresented to the court the next day, on an application for an\r\ninjunction. He further reported that very little mail and no freight\r\nwas moving, that the marshal was using all his force to prevent\r\nriots and the obstruction of tracks, and that this force was clearly\r\ninadequate. On the same day the marshal reported that the situation was\r\ndesperate, that he had sworn in over four hundred deputies, that many\r\nmore would be required to protect mail trains, and that he expected\r\ngreat trouble the next day. He further expressed the opinion that one\r\nhundred riot guns were needed.\r\n\r\nUpon the receipt of these reports, and anticipating an attempt to serve\r\ninjunctions on the following day, the Attorney-General immediately sent\r\na despatch to the district attorney directing him to report at once\r\nif the process of the court should be resisted by such force as the\r\nmarshal could not overcome, and suggesting that the United States judge\r\nshould join in such report. He at the same time sent a despatch to the\r\nspecial counsel requesting him to report his view of the situation as\r\nearly as the forenoon of the next day.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of these two despatches it should here be said that\r\nthe desperate character of this disturbance was not in the least\r\nunderestimated by executive officials at Washington; and it must be\r\nborne in mind that while menacing conditions were moving swiftly and\r\naccumulating at Chicago, like conditions, inspired and supported from\r\nthat central point, existed in many other places within the area of the\r\nstrike’s contagion.\r\n\r\nOf course it was hoped by those charged with the responsibility of\r\ndealing with the situation, that a direct assertion of authority by the\r\nmarshal and a resort to the restraining power of the courts would prove\r\nsufficient for the emergency. Notwithstanding, however, an anxious\r\ndesire to avoid measures more radical, the fact had not been overlooked\r\nthat a contingency might occur which would compel a resort to military\r\nforce. The key to these despatches of the Attorney-General is found in\r\nthe determination of the Federal authorities to overcome by any lawful\r\nand constitutional means all resistance to governmental functions as\r\nrelated to the transportation of mails, the operation of interstate\r\ncommerce, and the preservation of the property of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution requires that the United States shall protect each of\r\nthe States against invasion, “and on application of the legislature,\r\nor of the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened), against\r\ndomestic violence.” There was plenty of domestic violence in the city\r\nof Chicago and in the State of Illinois during the early days of\r\nJuly, 1894; but no application was made to the Federal Government for\r\nassistance. It was probably a very fortunate circumstance that the\r\npresence of United States soldiers in Chicago at that time did not\r\ndepend upon the request or desire of Governor Altgeld.\r\n\r\nSection 5298 of the Revised Statutes of the United States provides:\r\n“Whenever, by reason of unlawful obstructions, combinations or\r\nassemblages of persons, or rebellion against the authority of the\r\nUnited States, it shall become impracticable in the judgment of the\r\nPresident to enforce, by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings,\r\nthe laws of the United States within any State or Territory, it\r\nshall be lawful for the President to call forth the militia of any\r\nor all of the States, and to employ such parts of the land or naval\r\nforces of the United States as he may deem necessary to enforce the\r\nfaithful execution of the laws of the United States, or to suppress\r\nsuch rebellion, in whatever State or Territory thereof the laws of\r\nthe United States may be forcibly opposed, or the execution thereof\r\nbe forcibly obstructed”; and Section 5299 provides: “Whenever any\r\ninsurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combinations or conspiracies\r\nin any State ... opposes or obstructs the laws of the United States,\r\nor the due execution thereof, or impedes or obstructs the due course\r\nof justice under the same, it shall be lawful for the President, and\r\nit shall be his duty, to take such measures, by the employment of the\r\nmilitia, or the land and naval forces of the United States, or of\r\neither, or by other means as he may deem necessary, for the suppression\r\nof such insurrection, domestic violence or combinations.”\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIt was the intention of the Attorney-General to suggest in these\r\ndespatches that immediate and authoritative information should be given\r\nto the Washington authorities if a time should arrive when, under the\r\nsanction of general executive authority, or the constitutional and\r\nstatutory provisions above quoted, a military force would be necessary\r\nat the scene of disturbance.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of July, the day after these despatches were sent,\r\ninformation was received from the district attorney and special counsel\r\nthat a sweeping injunction had been granted against Eugene V. Debs,\r\npresident of the American Railway Union, and other officials of that\r\norganization, together with parties whose names were unknown, and\r\nthat the writs would be served that afternoon. The special counsel\r\nalso expressed the opinion that it would require Government troops to\r\nenforce the orders of the court and protect the transportation of mails.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Schofield was then in command of the army; and, after a\r\nconsultation with him, in which the Attorney-General and the Secretary\r\nof War took part, I directed the issuance of the following order by\r\ntelegraph to General Nelson A. Miles, in command of the Military\r\nDepartment of Missouri, with headquarters at Chicago:\r\n\r\n  HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY.\r\n  WASHINGTON, July 2, 1894.\r\n\r\n  _To the Commanding-General,\r\n  Department of Missouri,\r\n  Chicago, Ill._\r\n\r\n    You will please make all necessary arrangements confidentially\r\n    for the transportation of the entire garrison at Fort\r\n    Sheridan--infantry, cavalry, and artillery--to the lake front\r\n    in the city of Chicago. To avoid possible interruption of the\r\n    movement by rail and by marching through a part of the city, it\r\n    may be advisable to bring them by steam-boat. Please consider\r\n    this matter and have the arrangements perfected without delay.\r\n    You may expect orders at any time for the movement. Acknowledge\r\n    receipt and report in what manner movement is to be made.\r\n\r\n  J. M. SCHOFIELD,\r\n  _Major-General Commanding_.\r\n\r\nIt should by no means be inferred from this despatch that it had been\r\ndefinitely determined that the use of a military force was inevitable.\r\nIt was still hoped that the effect of the injunction would be such that\r\nthis alternative might be avoided. A painful emergency is created\r\nwhen public duty forces the necessity of placing trained soldiers\r\nface to face with riotous opposition to the general Government, and\r\nan acute and determined defiance to law and order. This course, once\r\nentered upon, admits of no backward step; and an appreciation of the\r\nconsequences that may ensue cannot fail to oppress those responsible\r\nfor its adoption with sadly disturbing reflections. Nevertheless, it\r\nwas perfectly plain that, whatever the outcome might be, the situation\r\npositively demanded such precaution and preparation as would insure\r\nreadiness and promptness in case the presence of a military force\r\nshould finally be found necessary.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the next day, July 3, the Attorney-General received a\r\nletter from Mr. Walker, the special counsel, in which, after referring\r\nto the issuance of the injunctions and setting forth that the marshal\r\nwas engaged in serving them, he wrote:\r\n\r\n    I do not believe that the marshal and his deputies can protect\r\n    the railroad companies in moving their trains, either freight\r\n    or passenger, including, of course, the trains carrying United\r\n    States mails. Possibly, however, the service of the writ of\r\n    injunction will have a restraining influence upon Debs and\r\n    other officers of the association. If it does not, from\r\n    present appearances, I think it is the opinion of all that the\r\n    orders of the court cannot be enforced except by the aid of the\r\n    regular army.\r\n\r\nThereupon the Attorney-General immediately sent this despatch to the\r\ndistrict attorney:\r\n\r\n    I trust use of United States troops will not be necessary. If\r\n    it becomes necessary, they will be used promptly and decisively\r\n    upon the justifying facts being certified to me. In such case,\r\n    if practicable, let Walker and the marshal and United States\r\n    judge join in statement as to the exigency.\r\n\r\nA few hours afterward the following urgent and decisive despatch\r\nfrom the marshal, endorsed by a judge of the United States court\r\nand the district attorney and special counsel, was received by the\r\nAttorney-General.\r\n\r\n  CHICAGO, ILL., July 3, 1894.\r\n\r\n  Hon. RICHARD OLNEY, _Attorney-General_,\r\n  Washington, D. C.:\r\n\r\n    When the injunction was granted yesterday, a mob of from two\r\n    to three thousand held possession of a point in the city near\r\n    the crossing of the Rock Island by other roads, where they had\r\n    already ditched a mail-train, and prevented the passing of any\r\n    trains, whether mail or otherwise. I read the injunction writ\r\n    to this mob and commanded them to disperse. The reading of\r\n    the writ met with no response except jeers and hoots. Shortly\r\n    after, the mob threw a number of baggage-cars across the track,\r\n    since when no mail-train has been able to move. I am unable to\r\n    disperse the mob, clear the tracks, or arrest the men who were\r\n    engaged in the acts named, and believe that no force less than\r\n    the regular troops of the United States can procure the passage\r\n    of the mail-trains, or enforce the orders of the courts. I\r\n    believe people engaged in trades are quitting employment\r\n    to-day, and in my opinion will be joining the mob to-night and\r\n    especially to-morrow; and it is my judgment that the troops\r\n    should be here at the earliest moment. An emergency has arisen\r\n    for their presence in this city.\r\n\r\n  J. W. ARNOLD,\r\n  _United States Marshal_.\r\n\r\n    We have read the foregoing, and from that information, and\r\n    other information that has come to us, believe that an\r\n    emergency exists for the immediate presence of United States\r\n    troops.\r\n\r\n  P. S. GROSSCUP, _Judge_.\r\n  EDWIN WALKER,      }\r\n  THOMAS E. MILCHIST,} _Attys_.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the same day the following order was telegraphed\r\nfrom army headquarters in the city of Washington:\r\n\r\n  WAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n  HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY.\r\n  WASHINGTON, D. C., July 3, 1894,\r\n  4 o’clock P.M.\r\n\r\n  TO MARTIN, _Adjutant-General_,\r\n  Headquarters Department of Missouri,\r\n  Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\n    It having become impracticable in the judgment of the President\r\n    to enforce by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings the\r\n    laws of the United States, you will direct Colonel Crofton to\r\n    move his entire command at once to the city of Chicago (leaving\r\n    the necessary guard at Fort Sheridan), there to execute the\r\n    orders and processes of the United States court, to prevent\r\n    the obstruction of the United States mails, and generally\r\n    to enforce the faithful execution of the laws of the United\r\n    States. He will confer with the United States marshal, the\r\n    United States district attorney, and Edwin Walker, special\r\n    counsel. Acknowledge receipt and report action promptly. By\r\n    order of the President.\r\n\r\n  J. M. SCHOFIELD, _Major-General_.\r\n\r\nImmediately after this order was issued, the following despatch was\r\nsent to the district attorney by the Attorney-General:\r\n\r\n    Colonel Crofton’s command ordered to Chicago by the President.\r\n    As to disposition and movement of troops, yourself, Walker, and\r\n    the marshal should confer with Colonel Crofton and with Colonel\r\n    Martin, adjutant-general at Chicago. While action should\r\n    be prompt and decisive, it should of course be kept within\r\n    the limits provided by the Constitution and laws. Rely upon\r\n    yourself and Walker to see that this is done.\r\n\r\nColonel Martin, adjutant-general at Chicago, reported, the same night\r\nat half-past nine o’clock, that the order for the movement of troops\r\nwas, immediately on its receipt by him, transmitted to Fort Sheridan,\r\nand that Colonel Crofton’s command started for Chicago at nine o’clock.\r\n\r\nDuring the forenoon of the next day, July 4, Colonel Martin advised the\r\nWar Department that Colonel Crofton reported his command in the city of\r\nChicago at 10:15 that morning. After referring to the manner in which\r\nthe troops had been distributed, this officer added: “People seem to\r\nfeel easier since arrival of troops.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Miles, commanding the department, arrived in Chicago the same\r\nmorning, and at once assumed direction of military movements. In\r\nthe afternoon of that day he sent a report to the War Department at\r\nWashington, giving an account of the disposition of troops, recounting\r\nan unfavorable condition of affairs, and recommending an increase of\r\nthe garrison at Fort Sheridan sufficient to meet any emergency.\r\n\r\nIn response to this despatch General Miles was immediately authorized\r\nto order six companies of infantry from Fort Leavenworth, in Kansas,\r\nand two companies from Fort Brady, in Michigan, to Fort Sheridan.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day of July he reported that a mob of over two thousand\r\nhad gathered that morning at the stock-yards, crowded among the troops,\r\nobstructed the movement of trains, knocked down a railroad official,\r\nand overturned about twenty freight-cars, which obstructed all freight\r\nand passenger traffic in the vicinity of the stock-yards, and that the\r\nmob had also derailed a passenger-train on the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne\r\nand Chicago Railroad, and burned switches. To this recital of violent\r\ndemonstrations he added the following statement:\r\n\r\n    The injunction of the United States court is openly defied,\r\n    and unless the mobs are dispersed by the action of the police\r\n    or they are fired upon by United States troops, more serious\r\n    trouble may be expected, as the mob is increasing and becoming\r\n    more defiant.\r\n\r\nIn view of the situation as reported by General Miles, a despatch was\r\nsent to him by General Schofield directing him to concentrate his\r\ntroops in order that they might act more effectively in the execution\r\nof orders theretofore given, and in the protection of United States\r\nproperty. This despatch concluded as follows:\r\n\r\n    The mere preservation of peace and good order in the city is,\r\n    of course, the province of the city and state authorities.\r\n\r\nThe situation on the sixth day of July was thus described in a despatch\r\nsent in the afternoon of that day by General Miles to the Secretary of\r\nWar:\r\n\r\n    In answer to your telegram, I report the following: Mayor\r\n    Hopkins last night issued a proclamation prohibiting\r\n    riotous assemblies and directing the police to stop people\r\n    from molesting railway communication. Governor Altgeld has\r\n    ordered General Wheeler’s brigade on duty in Chicago to\r\n    support the Mayor’s authority. So far, there have been no\r\n    large mobs like the one of yesterday, which moved from 51st\r\n    Street to 18th Street before it dispersed. The lawlessness\r\n    has been along the line of the railways, destroying and\r\n    burning more than one hundred cars and railway buildings,\r\n    and obstructing transportation in various ways, even to the\r\n    extent of cutting telegraph lines. United States troops have\r\n    dispersed mobs at 51st Street, Kensington, and a company of\r\n    infantry is moving along the Rock Island to support a body of\r\n    United States marshals in making arrests for violating the\r\n    injunction of the United States court. Of the twenty-three\r\n    roads centering in Chicago, only six are unobstructed in\r\n    freight, passenger, and mail transportation. Thirteen are at\r\n    present entirely obstructed, and ten are running only mail-\r\n    and passenger-trains. Large numbers of trains moving in and\r\n    out of the city have been stoned and fired upon by mobs, and\r\n    one engineer killed. There was a secret meeting to-day of\r\n    Debs and the representatives of labor unions considering the\r\n    advisability of a general strike of all labor unions. About\r\n    one hundred men were present at that meeting. The result is\r\n    not yet known. United States troops are at the stock-yards,\r\n    Kensington, Blue Island, crossing of 51st Street, and have\r\n    been moving along some of the lines: the balance, eight\r\n    companies of infantry, battery of artillery, and one troop\r\n    of cavalry, are camped on Lake Front Park, ready for any\r\n    emergency and to protect Government buildings and property. It\r\n    is learned from the Fire Department, City Hall, that a party of\r\n    strikers has been going through the vicinity from 14th to 41st\r\n    streets and Stewart Avenue freight-yards, throwing gasoline on\r\n    freight-cars all through that section. Captain Ford, of the\r\n    Fire Department, was badly stoned this morning. Troops have\r\n    just dispersed a mob of incendiaries on Fort Wayne tracks, near\r\n    51st Street, and fires that were started have been suppressed.\r\n    Mob just captured mail-train at 47th Street, and troops sent to\r\n    disperse them.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth day of July, in view of the apparently near approach of\r\na crisis which the Government had attempted to avoid, the following\r\nExecutive Proclamation was issued and at once extensively published in\r\nthe city of Chicago:\r\n\r\n    Whereas, by reason of unlawful obstruction, combinations and\r\n    assemblages of persons, it has become impracticable, in the\r\n    judgment of the President, to enforce, by the ordinary course\r\n    of judicial proceedings, the laws of the United States within\r\n    the State of Illinois, and especially in the city of Chicago\r\n    within said State; and\r\n\r\n    Whereas, for the purpose of enforcing the faithful execution of\r\n    the laws of the United States and protecting its property and\r\n    removing obstructions to the United States mails in the State\r\n    and city aforesaid, the President has employed a part of the\r\n    military forces of the United States:--\r\n\r\n    Now, therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United\r\n    States, do hereby admonish all good citizens, and all persons\r\n    who may be or may come within the City and State aforesaid,\r\n    against aiding, countenancing, encouraging, or taking any part\r\n    in such unlawful obstructions, combinations, and assemblages;\r\n    and I hereby warn all persons engaged in or in any way\r\n    connected with such unlawful obstructions, combinations,\r\n    and assemblages to disperse and retire peaceably to their\r\n    respective abodes on or before twelve o’clock noon of the 9th\r\n    day of July instant.\r\n\r\n    Those who disregard this warning and persist in taking part\r\n    with a riotous mob in forcibly resisting and obstructing the\r\n    execution of the laws of the United States, or interfering with\r\n    the functions of the Government, or destroying or attempting to\r\n    destroy the property belonging to the United States or under\r\n    its protection, cannot be regarded otherwise than as public\r\n    enemies.\r\n\r\n    Troops employed against such a riotous mob will act\r\n    with all the moderation and forbearance consistent with\r\n    the accomplishment of the desired end; but the stern\r\n    necessities that confront them will not with certainty permit\r\n    discrimination between guilty participants and those who are\r\n    mingling with them from curiosity and without criminal intent.\r\n    The only safe course, therefore, for those not actually\r\n    participating, is to abide at their homes, or at least not to\r\n    be found in the neighborhood of riotous assemblages.\r\n\r\n    While there will be no vacillation in the decisive treatment\r\n    of the guilty, this warning is especially intended to protect\r\n    and save the innocent.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of July, Eugene V. Debs, the president of the American\r\nRailway Union, together with its vice-president, general secretary, and\r\none other who was an active director, were arrested upon indictments\r\nfound against them for complicity in the obstruction of mails and\r\ninterstate commerce. Three days afterward our special counsel expressed\r\nthe opinion that the strike was practically broken. This must not\r\nbe taken to mean, however, that peace and quiet had been completely\r\nrestored or that the transportation of mails and the activities of\r\ninterstate commerce were entirely free from interruption. It was only\r\nthe expression of a well-sustained and deliberate expectation that the\r\ncombination of measures already inaugurated, and others contemplated\r\nin the near future, would speedily bring about a termination of the\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth day of July an information was filed in the United\r\nStates Circuit Court at Chicago against Debs and the three other\r\nofficials of the Railway Union who had been arrested on indictment\r\na few days before, but were then at large on bail. This information\r\nalleged that these parties had been guilty of open, continued, and\r\ndefiant disobedience of the injunction which was served on them July\r\n3, forbidding them to do certain specified acts tending to incite and\r\naid the obstruction of the carriage of mails and the operation of\r\ninterstate commerce. On the footing of this information these parties\r\nwere brought before the court to show cause why they should not be\r\npunished for contempt in disobeying the injunction. Instead of giving\r\nbail for their freedom pending the investigation of this charge against\r\nthem, as they were invited to do, they preferred to be committed to\r\ncustody--perhaps intending by such an act of martyrdom either to revive\r\na waning cause, or to gain a plausible and justifying excuse for\r\nthe collapse of their already foredoomed movement. Debs himself, in\r\nspeaking of this event afterward, said: “As soon as the employees found\r\nthat we were arrested and taken from the scene of action they became\r\ndemoralized, and that ended the strike.”\r\n\r\nThat the strike ended about the time of this second arrest is\r\nundoubtedly true; for, during the few days immediately preceding and\r\nfollowing the seventeenth day of July, reports came from nearly all\r\nthe localities to which the strike had spread, indicating its defeat\r\nand the accomplishment of all the purposes of the Government’s\r\ninterference. The successful assertion of national authority was\r\nconclusively indicated when on the twentieth day of July the last of\r\nthe soldiers of the United States who had been ordered for duty at the\r\nvery center of opposition and disturbance, were withdrawn from Chicago\r\nand returned to the military posts to which they were attached.\r\n\r\nI hope I have been successful thus far in my effort satisfactorily to\r\nexhibit the extensive reach and perilous tendency of the convulsion\r\nunder consideration, the careful promptness which characterized the\r\ninterference of the Government, the constant desire of the national\r\nadministration to avoid extreme measures, the scrupulous limitation\r\nof its interference to purposes which were clearly within its\r\nconstitutional competency and duty, and the gratifying and important\r\nresults of its conservative but stern activity.\r\n\r\nI must not fail to mention here as part of the history of this\r\nperplexing affair, a contribution made by the governor of Illinois to\r\nits annoyances. This official not only refused to regard the riotous\r\ndisturbances within the borders of his State as a sufficient cause for\r\nan application to the Federal Government for its protection “against\r\ndomestic violence” under the mandate of the Constitution, but he\r\nactually protested against the presence of Federal troops sent into the\r\nState upon the general Government’s own initiative and for the purpose\r\nof defending itself in the exercise of its well-defined legitimate\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day of July, twenty-four hours after our soldiers had been\r\nbrought to the city of Chicago, pursuant to the order of July 3d, I\r\nreceived a long despatch from Governor Altgeld, beginning as follows:\r\n\r\n    I am advised that you have ordered Federal troops to go into\r\n    service in the State of Illinois. Surely the facts have not\r\n    been correctly presented to you in this case or you would not\r\n    have taken the step; for it is entirely unnecessary and, as it\r\n    seems to me, unjustifiable. Waiving all question of courtesy,\r\n    I will say that the State of Illinois is not only able to take\r\n    care of itself, but it stands ready to-day to furnish the\r\n    Federal Government any assistance it may need elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis opening sentence was followed by a lengthy statement which so far\r\nmissed actual conditions as to appear irrelevant and, in some parts,\r\nabsolutely frivolous.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable despatch closed with the following words:\r\n\r\n    As Governor of the State of Illinois, I protest against this\r\n    and ask the immediate withdrawal of Federal troops from active\r\n    duty in this State. Should the situation at any time get so\r\n    serious that we cannot control it with the State forces, we\r\n    will promptly and freely ask for Federal assistance; but\r\n    until such time I protest with all due deference against this\r\n    uncalled-for reflection upon our people, and again ask for the\r\n    immediate withdrawal of these troops.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the receipt of this communication, I sent to Governor\r\nAltgeld the following reply:\r\n\r\n    Federal troops were sent to Chicago in strict accordance with\r\n    the Constitution and the laws of the United States, upon the\r\n    demand of the Post-Office Department that obstructions of the\r\n    mails should be removed, and upon the representation of the\r\n    judicial officers of the United States that process of the\r\n    Federal courts could not be executed through the ordinary\r\n    means, and upon abundant proof that conspiracies existed\r\n    against commerce between the States. To meet these conditions,\r\n    which are clearly within the province of Federal authority, the\r\n    presence of Federal troops in the city of Chicago was deemed\r\n    not only proper but necessary; and there has been no intention\r\n    of thereby interfering with the plain duty of the local\r\n    authorities to preserve the peace of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIn response to this the governor, evidently unwilling to allow the\r\nmatter at issue between us to rest without a renewal of argument\r\nand protest, at once addressed to me another long telegraphic\r\ncommunication, evidently intended to be more severely accusatory and\r\ninsistent than its predecessor. Its general tenor may be inferred from\r\nthe opening words:\r\n\r\n    Your answer to my protest involves some startling conclusions,\r\n    and ignores and evades the question at issue--that is, that the\r\n    principle of local self-government is just as fundamental in\r\n    our institutions as is that of Federal supremacy. You calmly\r\n    assume that the Executive has the legal right to order Federal\r\n    troops into any community of the United States in the first\r\n    instance, whenever there is the slightest disturbance, and that\r\n    he can do this without any regard to the question as to whether\r\n    the community is able to and ready to enforce the law itself.\r\n\r\nAfter a rather dreary discussion of the importance of preserving\r\nthe rights of the States and a presentation of the dangers to\r\nconstitutional government that lurked in the course that had been\r\npursued by the general Government, this communication closed as follows:\r\n\r\n    Inasmuch as the Federal troops can do nothing but what the\r\n    State troops can do there, and believing that the State is\r\n    amply able to take care of the situation and to enforce the\r\n    law, and believing that the ordering out of the Federal troops\r\n    was unwarranted, I again ask their withdrawal.\r\n\r\nI confess that my patience was somewhat strained when I quickly sent\r\nthe following despatch in reply to this communication:\r\n\r\n  EXECUTIVE MANSION.\r\n  WASHINGTON, D. C., July 6, 1894.\r\n\r\n    While I am still persuaded that I have neither transcended\r\n    my authority nor duty in the emergency that confronts us, it\r\n    seems to me that in this hour of danger and public distress,\r\n    discussion may well give way to active efforts on the part of\r\n    all in authority to restore obedience to law and to protect\r\n    life and property.\r\n\r\n  GROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n  Hon. John P. Altgeld,\r\n  _Governor of Illinois_.\r\n\r\nThis closed a discussion which in its net results demonstrated how far\r\none’s disposition and inclination will lead him astray in the field of\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude the treatment of my subject by a brief reference to\r\nthe legal proceedings which grew out of this disturbance, and finally\r\nled to an adjudication by the highest court in our land, establishing\r\nin an absolutely authoritative manner and for all time the power of the\r\nnational Government to protect itself in the exercise of its functions.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that in the course of our narrative we left Mr.\r\nDebs, the president of the Railway Union, and his three associates\r\nin custody of the law, on the seventeenth day of July, awaiting an\r\ninvestigation of the charge of contempt of court made against them,\r\nbased upon their disobedience of the writs of injunction forbidding\r\nthem to do certain things in aid or encouragement of interference with\r\nmail transportation or interstate commerce.\r\n\r\nThis investigation was so long delayed that the decision of the Circuit\r\nCourt before which the proceedings were pending was not rendered until\r\nthe fourteenth day of December, 1894. On that date the court delivered\r\nan able and carefully considered decision finding Debs and his\r\nassociates guilty of contempt of court, basing its decision upon the\r\nprovisions of the law of Congress, passed in 1890, entitled: “An act to\r\nprotect trade and commerce against unlawful restraint and monopolies”;\r\nsometimes called the Sherman Anti-Trust Law. Thereupon the parties\r\nwere sentenced on said conviction to confinement in the county jail for\r\nterms varying from three to six months.\r\n\r\nAfterward, and on the 14th day of January, 1895, the prisoners applied\r\nto the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of habeas corpus\r\nto relieve them from imprisonment, on the ground that the facts found\r\nagainst them by the Circuit Court did not constitute disobedience of\r\nthe writs of injunction and that their commitment in the manner and\r\nfor the reasons alleged was without justification and not within the\r\nconstitutional power and jurisdiction of that tribunal.\r\n\r\nOn this application, the case was elaborately argued before the Supreme\r\nCourt in March, 1895; and on the twenty-seventh day of May, 1895, the\r\ncourt rendered its decision, upholding on the broadest grounds the\r\nproceedings of the Circuit Court and confirming its adjudication and\r\nthe commitment to jail of the petitioners thereupon.\r\n\r\nJustice Brewer, in delivering the unanimous opinion of the Supreme\r\nCourt, stated the case as follows:\r\n\r\n    The United States, finding that the interstate transportation\r\n    of persons and property, as well as the carriage of mails,\r\n    is forcibly obstructed, and that a combination and conspiracy\r\n    exists to subject the control of such transportation to the\r\n    will of the conspirators, applied to one of their courts\r\n    sitting as a court of equity, for an injunction to restrain\r\n    such obstructions and prevent carrying into effect such\r\n    conspiracy. Two questions of importance are presented: First,\r\n    are the relations of the general Government to interstate\r\n    commerce and the transportation of the mails such as to\r\n    authorize a direct interference to prevent a forcible\r\n    obstruction thereof? Second, if authority exists,--as authority\r\n    in governmental affairs implies both power and duty,--has a\r\n    court of equity jurisdiction to issue an injunction in aid of\r\n    the performance of such duty?\r\n\r\nBoth of these questions were answered by the court in the affirmative;\r\nand in the opinion read by the learned justice, the inherent power of\r\nthe Government to execute the powers and functions belonging to it\r\nby means of physical force through its official agents, and on every\r\nfoot of American soil, was amply vindicated by a process of reasoning\r\nsimple, logical, unhampered by fanciful distinctions, and absolutely\r\nconclusive; and the Government’s peaceful resort to the court, the\r\ninjunction issued in its aid, and all the proceedings thereon,\r\nincluding the imprisonment of Debs and his associates, were fully\r\napproved.\r\n\r\nThus the Supreme Court of the United States has written the closing\r\nwords of this history, tragical in many of its details, and in every\r\nline provoking sober reflection. As we gratefully turn its concluding\r\npage, those who were most nearly related by executive responsibility to\r\nthe troublous days whose story is told may well especially congratulate\r\nthemselves on the part which fell to them in marking out the way and\r\nclearing the path, now unchangeably established, which shall hereafter\r\nguide our nation safely and surely in the exercise of the important\r\nfunctions which represent the people’s trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOND ISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe sales of United States bonds in the years 1894, 1895, and 1896 for\r\nthe purpose of replenishing the stock of gold in the public Treasury\r\nhave been greatly misunderstood by many honest people, and often\r\ndeliberately misrepresented.\r\n\r\nMy conviction that a love of fairness still abides with the masses of\r\nour people has encouraged me to give a history of these transactions\r\nfor the benefit of those who are uninformed or have been misled\r\nconcerning them. In undertaking this task I shall attempt to avoid\r\nunprofitable and tiresome explanation; but I shall, nevertheless,\r\nindulge in the recital of details to such an extent as may appear\r\nnecessary to an easy understanding of the matter in hand. I desire,\r\nabove all things, to treat the subject in such a way that none who\r\nread my narrative will be confused by the use of obscure or technical\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThe Government’s gold reserve, as it is usually known, originated under\r\nthe provision of an act of Congress passed January 14, 1875, entitled,\r\n“An Act to provide for the resumption of specie payments.” This law\r\ncontemplated the redemption in gold and the retirement of the currency\r\nobligations legally known as United States notes, but commonly called\r\ngreenbacks; and it provided that such notes in excess of $300,000,000\r\nshould be redeemed and retired prior to January 1, 1879, and that after\r\nthat date all the remainder of such notes should be likewise redeemed\r\nand canceled. This law further provided that “to enable the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury to prepare and provide for such redemption” he should\r\nhave the authority “to issue, sell and dispose of” bonds of the United\r\nStates which were therein particularly specified. Of course this\r\nauthority was given to the Secretary of the Treasury in order that, by\r\nthe sale of Government bonds, he could accumulate a sufficient gold\r\nfund or reserve to meet the demands of the gold redemption provided\r\nfor, and accomplish the ultimate retirement of all the United States\r\nnotes in circulation.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with this act, the sum of about $92,000,000 in gold was\r\nrealized by the sale of bonds, and about $41,000,000, in addition,\r\nwas obtained from surplus revenue; and thereupon the contemplated\r\nredemption was entered upon. But after the retirement and cancelation\r\nof only about $30,000,000 of these notes, and on the thirty-first day\r\nof May, 1878, this process was interrupted by the passage of an act\r\nforbidding their further retirement or cancelation, and providing that\r\nany such notes thereafter redeemed should not be canceled or destroyed,\r\nbut should be “reissued and paid out again and kept in circulation.”\r\nAt the time this act was passed the United States notes uncanceled\r\nand still outstanding amounted to $346,681,016. It will be observed\r\nthat though the actual retirement of these notes was prohibited, their\r\nredemption in gold was still continued, coupled with the condition\r\nthat, though thus redeemed, they should be still kept on foot and again\r\nput in circulation as a continuing and never-ending obligation of the\r\nGovernment, calling for payment in gold--not once alone, but as often\r\nas their reissue permitted, and without the least regard to prior\r\nso-called redemptions. It will be also observed that this prohibition\r\nof cancelation intervened seven months prior to January 1, 1879, the\r\ndate when the general and unrestricted redemption and retirement of\r\nall these outstanding notes was, under the terms of the act of 1875,\r\nto commence. At the time when their further cancelation was thus\r\nterminated there remained of the gold which had been provided as a\r\nreserve for their redemption about $103,000,000. This is the fund which\r\nhas since then been called the “gold reserve.”\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, this reserve was thereafter made up of all the net\r\ngold held by the Government; and its amount at any particular date was\r\nascertained by deducting from the entire stock of gold in the Treasury\r\nthe amounts covered by outstanding gold certificates, which instruments\r\nresemble a bank’s certificate of deposit, and are issued by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury to those making with the Government specific\r\ndeposits of gold, to be returned to the holders of the certificates on\r\ndemand. Of course the gold thus held for certificate-holders is not\r\navailable for the redemption of United States notes.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1882 a law was passed by Congress which provided that\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury should suspend the issue of these gold\r\ncertificates “whenever the amount of gold coin and gold bullion in the\r\nTreasury, reserved for the redemption of United States notes, falls\r\nbelow $100,000,000.” Whatever may have been the actual relationship\r\nbetween gold certificates representing gold deposited for their\r\nredemption, and the gold kept on hand for the redemption of United\r\nStates notes, the provision of law just quoted seems to have been\r\naccepted as a statutory recognition of the fact that our gold reserve\r\nfor note redemption should have for its lowest limit this sum of\r\n$100,000,000. It is a singular circumstance that until very lately,\r\nwhen this reserve was increased and fixed at $150,000,000, no Act of\r\nCongress actually provided, or in any way expressly stated, what the\r\nlimits of this gold reserve for redemption purposes should be; and it\r\nis no less singular that this provision in the law of 1882 fixed its\r\nlowest safe limit as perfectly and authoritatively in the understanding\r\nof our people as it could have been done by a distinct legislative\r\nrequirement. At the time this reserve was created, as well as when\r\nthe actual cancelation of United States notes after redemption was\r\nprohibited, it evidently was thought by those directing our nation’s\r\nfinancial affairs that the sum of $100,000,000 in net gold actually in\r\nhand, especially with such additions as might naturally be expected to\r\nreach the fund by way of surplus revenue receipts, or otherwise, would\r\nconstitute a sufficient gold reserve to redeem such of these notes\r\nstill left outstanding as might be presented, and that the assurance\r\nof their gold redemption when presented would keep them largely in\r\ncirculation. This scheme seemed for a time to be abundantly vindicated\r\nby the people’s contentment with the sufficiency of the redemption\r\nreserve, and by their willingness to keep in circulating use these\r\nUnited States notes as currency more convenient than gold itself.\r\n\r\nAnother most important condition of mind among the people, however,\r\ngrew out of, or at least accompanied, their acceptance of the\r\nredemptive sufficiency of the gold reserve as constituted. The popular\r\nbelief became deep-seated and apparently immovable that the reduction\r\nof this gold reserve to an amount less than $100,000,000 would, in some\r\nway, cause a disastrous situation, and perhaps justify an apprehension\r\nconcerning our nation’s financial soundness. Thus a gold reserve\r\ncontaining at all times at least $100,000,000 came to be regarded by\r\nthe people with a sort of sentimental solicitude, which, whatever else\r\nmay be said of it, was certainly something to be reckoned with in\r\nmaking our national financial calculations.\r\n\r\nThat the plans thus set on foot for the so-called redemption of the\r\nUnited States notes outstanding promised to be adequate and effective\r\nis seen in the fact that the gold reserve, starting at the end of\r\nJune, 1878, with about $103,500,000, never afterward fell as low as\r\n$100,000,000 until April, 1893, and that sometimes in its fluctuations\r\nduring this interval of twenty-five years it amounted to upward of\r\n$200,000,000. Under conditions then existing popular confidence was\r\nwell established, the reserve satisfactorily endured the strain of\r\nall redemption demands, and United States notes were kept well in\r\ncirculation as money.\r\n\r\nIn an evil hour, however, a legislative concession was made to a\r\nmischievous and persistent demand for the free and unlimited coinage\r\nof silver. This concession was first exhibited in an act of Congress\r\npassed in 1878, directing the expenditure of not less than $2,000,000\r\nnor more than $4,000,000 each month by the Secretary of the Treasury in\r\nthe purchase of silver bullion, and the coinage of such bullion into\r\nsilver dollars. Though this act is not in itself so intimately related\r\nto my subject as to require detailed explanation, it was the forerunner\r\nof another law of Congress which had much to do with creating the\r\nfinancial conditions that necessitated the issuance of Government\r\nbonds for the reinforcement of the gold reserve.\r\n\r\nThis law was passed in 1890, and superseded the provision of the law\r\nof 1878 directing the purchase and coinage of silver. In lieu of\r\nthese provisions the Secretary of the Treasury was thereby directed\r\nto purchase silver bullion from time to time in each month to the\r\naggregate amount of 4,500,000 ounces, or as much as might be offered,\r\nat the market price, not to exceed, however, a limit therein fixed.\r\nIt was further provided that there should be issued, in payment of\r\nsuch purchases of silver bullion, Treasury notes of the United States\r\nin denominations not less than one dollar nor more than $1000; that\r\nsuch notes should be redeemable in coin, and should “be a legal tender\r\nin payment of all debts, public and private, except where otherwise\r\nexpressly stipulated in the contract, and should be receivable for\r\ncustoms, taxes and all public dues”; and that when they were redeemed\r\nor paid into the Treasury they might be reissued. The Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury was directed to coin into silver dollars in each month\r\nuntil the first day of July, 1891, 2,000,000 ounces of the silver so\r\npurchased, and thereafter so much as might be necessary to provide for\r\nthe redemption of the notes issued in payment for the silver from time\r\nto time purchased under the act.\r\n\r\nI have recited these provisions by way of leading up to the proposition\r\nthat, under the law of 1890, the burden upon the gold reserve was\r\ntremendously enlarged. It will be readily seen that it forced larger\r\nmonthly purchases of silver than were required under the prior act,\r\nand that, instead of providing for silver dollars, which as coins, or\r\ncertificates of deposit representing such coins, should circulate as\r\nsilver currency, unredeemable in gold as was done under the act of\r\n1878, it directed that in payment of such purchases a new obligation of\r\nthe Government, redeemable in coin, should be issued and added to our\r\ncirculating medium.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, only when we examine the specific provision for the\r\nredemption of these notes that we discover in its full extent the\r\nharmful relationship of this new device to the integrity of the gold\r\nreserve. At its outset the redemption clause of the act courageously\r\nand manfully gave to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to\r\nredeem such notes in gold or silver _at his discretion_; but in its\r\nending it fell down a pitiful victim of the silver craze. The entire\r\nclause is in these words: “That upon demand of the holder of any of\r\nthe Treasury notes herein provided for, the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nshall, under such regulations as he may provide, redeem such notes in\r\ngold or silver coin at his discretion, _it being the established policy\r\nof the United States to maintain the two metals at a parity with each\r\nother upon the present legal ratio, or such ratio as may be provided by\r\nlaw_.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the legal ratio then existing, which has never been\r\nchanged, the average intrinsic gold value of a silver dollar as\r\ncompared with a gold dollar was, during the year 1891, about\r\nseventy-six cents, during 1892 a trifle more than sixty-seven cents,\r\nand during 1893 about sixty cents.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that the assertion in the act of “the\r\nestablished policy of the United States to maintain the two metals at\r\na parity” had the effect of transferring the discretion of determining\r\nwhether these Treasury notes should be redeemed in gold or silver, from\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury to the holder of the notes. Manifestly,\r\nin the face of this assertion of the Government’s intention, a demand\r\nfor gold redemption on the part of the holders of such notes could not\r\nbe refused, and the acceptance of silver dollars insisted upon, without\r\neither subjecting to doubt the good faith and honest intention of the\r\nGovernment’s professions, or creating a suspicion of our country’s\r\nsolvency. The parity between the two metals could not be maintained,\r\nbut, on the contrary, would be distinctly denied, if the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury persisted in redeeming these notes, against the will of\r\nthe holders, in dollars of silver instead of gold.\r\n\r\nTherefore it came to pass that the Treasury notes issued for the\r\npurchase of silver under the law of 1890 took their place by the side\r\nof the United States notes, commonly called greenbacks, as demands\r\nagainst our very moderate and shifting gold reserve.\r\n\r\nIt should have been plainly apparent to all who had eyes to see that\r\nthe monetary scheme, thus additionally burdened, was adequate and safe\r\nonly in smooth financial weather, and was miserably calculated to\r\nresist any disturbances in public confidence, or the rough waves of\r\nbusiness emergencies. The proof of this was quickly forthcoming.\r\n\r\nThe new Treasury notes made their first appearance as part of our money\r\ncirculation in August, 1890; and at the close of that month the gold\r\nreserve amounted to $185,837,581. During the next month it fell off\r\nabout $38,000,000, reducing the amount on the last day of September\r\nto nearly $148,000,000; and with a few slight spasmodic rallies it\r\ncontinued to decrease until the sale of bonds for its replenishment.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of 1892 and the first months of 1893, these Treasury\r\nnotes having, in the meantime, very greatly multiplied, the withdrawals\r\nof gold from the Treasury through the redemption of these as well\r\nas the United States notes strikingly increased; and the fact that\r\nby far the larger part of the gold so withdrawn was shipped abroad\r\nplainly showed that foreign investors in American securities had grave\r\napprehensions as to our ability to continue to redeem all these notes\r\nin gold and thus maintain the integrity and soundness of our financial\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nI succeeded Mr. Harrison in the Presidency on the fourth day of\r\nMarch, 1893; and on the seventh of that month Mr. Carlisle became\r\nSecretary of the Treasury. The gold reserve on that day amounted to\r\n$100,982,410--only $982,410 in excess of the sum that had come to\r\nbe generally regarded as indicating the danger line. The retiring\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, appreciating the importance of preventing\r\nthe fall of the reserve below this limit, had just before his\r\nretirement directed the preparation of plates for the engraving of\r\nbonds so that he might by their sale obtain gold to reinforce the\r\nfund. I have heard him say within the last few years that he expected\r\nbefore the close of his term to resort to bond sales for the purpose\r\nof such reinforcement, unless prevented at the last moment by the\r\nPresident’s disapproval. Of course it is but natural that any one\r\ndirecting the affairs of the Treasury Department should be anxious to\r\navoid such an expedient; and Secretary Foster avoided it, and barely\r\nsaved the reserve from falling below the $100,000,000 mark during his\r\nterm, by effecting arrangements, in January and February, 1893, with\r\ncertain bankers in New York, by which he obtained from them in exchange\r\nfor United States notes, or on other considerations, something over\r\n$8,000,000 in gold, which enabled him to escape the sale of bonds in\r\naid of the reserve.\r\n\r\nWith the gold reserve lower than it had ever been since its creation\r\nin 1878, and showing an excess of less than $1,000,000 above the\r\nsupposed limit of disaster, and with the demand for gold redemption\r\nof Government currency obligations giving no sign of abatement,\r\nthe prospect that greeted the new administration was certainly not\r\nreassuring. In our effort to meet the emergency without an issue of\r\nbonds Secretary Carlisle immediately applied to banks in different\r\nlocalities for an exchange with the Government of a portion of their\r\nholdings of gold coin for other forms of currency. This effort was so\r\nfar successful that on the 25th of March the gold reserve amounted\r\nto over $107,000,000, notwithstanding the fact that considerable\r\nwithdrawals had been made in the interval. The slight betterment\r\nthus secured proved, however, to be only temporary; for under the\r\nstress of continued and augmented withdrawals, the gold reserve, on\r\nthe twenty-second day of April, 1893, for the first time since its\r\nestablishment, was reduced below the $100,000,000 limit--amounting on\r\nthat day to about $97,000,000.\r\n\r\nThough this fall below the minimum theretofore always maintained was\r\nnot followed by any sudden and distinctly new disaster, it had the\r\neffect of accelerating withdrawals of gold. It became apparent that\r\nthere had intervened a growing apprehension among the masses of our\r\nown people concerning the Government’s competency to continue gold\r\nredemption, with the result that a greatly increased proportion of the\r\namount withdrawn from the gold reserve, instead of going abroad to\r\nsatisfy the claims of foreigners or as a basis of commercial exchange,\r\nwas hoarded by our citizens at home as a precaution against possible\r\nfinancial distress. In the meantime, nearly the entire gold receipts\r\nin payment of customs and other revenue charges had ceased. To meet\r\nthis situation strenuous efforts were made by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury to improve the condition by resorting again to the plan of\r\nexchanging for gold other forms of currency, with some success, while\r\nin the month of August, 1893, gold revenue receipts were temporarily\r\nconsiderably stimulated. Thus a fleeting gleam of hope was given to the\r\ndark surroundings.\r\n\r\nIn these troublous times those charged with the administration of the\r\nGovernment’s financial affairs could not fail to recognize in the law\r\nof 1890, directing the monthly purchase of silver and the issuance in\r\npayment therefor of Treasury notes in effect redeemable in gold, a\r\nprolific cause of our financial trouble. Accordingly, a special session\r\nof Congress was called to meet on the seventh day of August, 1893, to\r\nrepeal this law, and thus terminate the creation of further demands\r\nupon our already overburdened and feeble gold reserve. The repealing\r\nact was quite promptly passed in the House of Representatives on the\r\ntwenty-eighth day of August; but, on account of vexatious opposition\r\nin the Senate, the repeal was not finally effected until the first day\r\nof November, 1893, and then only after there had been added to the act\r\nan inopportune repetition of the statement concerning the Government’s\r\nintention to maintain the parity of both gold and silver coins.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe effect of this repeal in its immediate results failed to quiet the\r\nfear of impending evil now thoroughly aroused; nor were all the efforts\r\nthus far made to augment the gold reserve effective as against the\r\nconstant process of its depletion.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth day of January, 1894, the Government was confronted\r\nby a disquieting emergency. The gold reserve had fallen to less than\r\n$70,000,000, notwithstanding the most diligent efforts to maintain it\r\nin sounder condition. Against this slender fund gold demands amounting\r\nto not less than $450,000,000 in United States notes and Treasury notes\r\nwere in actual circulation, and others amounting to about $50,000,000,\r\nin addition, were temporarily held in the Treasury subject to\r\nreissue--the entire volume, by peremptory requirement of law, remaining\r\nuncanceled even after repeated redemption; nor was there any promise\r\nof a cessation of the abnormal and exhausting drain of gold then fully\r\nunder way. Another factor in the situation, most perplexing and\r\ndangerous, was the distrust, which was growing enormously, regarding\r\nthe wisdom and stability of our scheme of finance. As a result of these\r\nconditions there loomed in sight the menace of the destruction of our\r\ngold reserve, the repudiation of our gold obligations, the humiliating\r\nfall of our nation’s finances to a silver basis, and the degradation of\r\nour Government’s high standing in the respect of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nThere was absolutely but one way to avert national calamity and our\r\ncountry’s disgrace; and this way was adopted when, on the seventeenth\r\nday of January, 1894, the Secretary of the Treasury issued a notice\r\nthat bids in gold would be received until the first day of February\r\nfollowing for $50,000,000 in bonds of the United States, redeemable in\r\ncoin at the pleasure of the Government after ten years from the date\r\nof their issue, and bearing interest at the rate of five per cent.\r\nper annum. It was further stated in the notice that no bid would be\r\nconsidered that did not offer a premium on said bonds of a fraction\r\nmore than seventeen per cent., which would secure to the purchaser an\r\ninvestment yielding three per cent. per annum.\r\n\r\nIt should here be mentioned that the only Government bonds which could\r\nbe sold in the manner and for the purpose contemplated were such as\r\nwere authorized and described in a law passed in 1870, and which were\r\ndesignated in the law of 1875 providing for the redemption of United\r\nStates notes as the kind of bonds which the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nwas permitted to sell to enable him “to prepare and provide for”\r\nsuch redemption. The issues of bonds thus authorized were of three\r\ndescriptions: one payable at the pleasure of the Government after\r\nten years from their date, and bearing interest at the rate of five\r\nper cent.; one so made payable after fifteen years from their date,\r\nbearing four and a half per cent. interest; and one in like manner\r\nmade payable after thirty years from their date, bearing interest at\r\nthe rate of four per cent. The five per cent. bonds were specified in\r\nthe Secretary’s offer of sale because on account of their high rate of\r\ninterest they would command a greater premium, and therefore a larger\r\nreturn of gold, and for the further reason that the option of the\r\nGovernment regarding their payment could be earlier exercised.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawals of gold did not cease with the offer to sell bonds\r\nfor the replenishment of the reserve, and on the day before the date\r\nlimited for the opening of bids the fund had decreased to less than\r\n$66,000,000. In the meantime, the perplexity of the situation, already\r\nintense, was made more so by the fact that the bids for bonds under\r\nthe offer of the Secretary came in so slowly that a few days before\r\nthe 1st of February, when the bids were to be opened, there were plain\r\nindications that the contemplated sale would fail unless prompt and\r\nenergetic measures were taken to avoid such a perilous result.\r\n\r\nThereupon the Secretary of the Treasury invited to a conference, in\r\nthe city of New York, a number of bankers and presidents of moneyed\r\ninstitutions, which resulted in so arousing their patriotism, as\r\nwell as their solicitude for the protection of the interests they\r\nrepresented, that they effectively exerted themselves, barely in time\r\nto prevent a disastrous failure of the sale. The proceeds of this\r\nsale, received from numerous bidders large and small, aggregated\r\n$58,660,917.63 in gold, which so increased the reserve that on the\r\nsixth day of March, 1894, it amounted to $107,440,802.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that this measure of restoration and this exhibition of\r\nthe nation’s ability to protect its financial integrity would allay\r\napprehension and restore confidence to such an extent as to render\r\nfurther bond sales unnecessary. It was soon discovered, however, that\r\nthe complications of our ill condition were so deep-seated and stubborn\r\nthat the treatment resorted to was only a palliative instead of a cure.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of May, 1894, less than three months after its\r\nreinforcement, as mentioned, the gold reserve had been again so\r\ndepleted by withdrawals that it amounted to only $78,693,267. An almost\r\nuninterrupted downward tendency followed, notwithstanding constant\r\nefforts on the part of the Government to check the fall, until, on the\r\nfourteenth day of November, 1894, the fund had fallen to $61,878,374.\r\nIn the meantime, the inclination of our timid citizens to take gold\r\nfrom the reserve for hoarding “had grown by what it fed on,” while\r\nlarge shipments abroad to meet foreign indebtedness or for profit still\r\ncontinued and increased in amount.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the inexorable alternative presented itself of\r\nagain selling Government bonds for the replenishment of its redemption\r\ngold, or assuming the tremendous risk of neglecting the safety and\r\npermanence of every interest dependent upon the soundness of our\r\nnational finances. An obedient regard for official duty made the right\r\npath exceedingly plain.\r\n\r\nOn the day last mentioned a public proposal was issued inviting bids\r\nin gold for the purchase of additional five per cent. bonds to the\r\namount of $50,000,000. Numerous bids were received under this proposal,\r\none of which, for “all or none” of the bonds, tendered on behalf of\r\nthirty-three banking institutions and financiers in the city of New\r\nYork, being considerably more advantageous to the Government than all\r\nother bids, was accepted, and the entire amount was awarded to these\r\nparties. This resulted in adding to the reserve the sum of $58,538,500.\r\n\r\nThe president at that time of the United States Trust Company, one\r\nof the strongest and largest financial institutions in the country,\r\nrendered most useful and patriotic service in making both this and the\r\nprevious offer of bonds successful; and his company was a prominent\r\npurchaser on both occasions. He afterward testified under oath that\r\nthe accepted bid for “all or none,” in which his company was a large\r\nparticipant, proved unprofitable to the bidders.\r\n\r\nThe payment of gold into the Treasury on account of this sale of\r\nbonds was not entirely completed until after the 1st of December,\r\n1894. Then followed a time of bitter disappointment and miserable\r\ndepression, greater than any that had before darkened the struggles of\r\nthe Executive branch of the Government to save our nation’s financial\r\nintegrity.\r\n\r\nThe addition made to the gold reserve by this completed transaction\r\nseemed to be of no substantial benefit, if, on the contrary, it did\r\nnot actually stimulate the disquieting factors of the situation. In\r\nDecember, 1894, during which month $58,538,500 in gold, realized from\r\nthis second sale of bonds, was fully paid in and added to the reserve,\r\nthe withdrawals from the fund amounted to nearly $32,000,000; and this\r\nwas followed in the next month, or during January, 1895, by a further\r\ndepletion in the sum of more than $45,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn view of the crisis which these suddenly increased withdrawals seemed\r\nto portend, the aid of Congress was earnestly invoked in a special\r\npresidential message to that body, dated on the 28th of January, 1895,\r\nin which the gravity and embarrassment of the situation were set forth\r\nin the following terms:\r\n\r\n    The real trouble which confronts us consists in a lack of\r\n    confidence, widespread and constantly increasing, in the\r\n    continuing ability or disposition of the Government to pay\r\n    its obligations in gold. This lack of confidence grows to\r\n    some extent out of the palpable and apparent embarrassment\r\n    attending the efforts of the Government under existing laws to\r\n    procure gold, and to a greater extent out of the impossibility\r\n    of either keeping it in the Treasury or canceling obligations\r\n    by its expenditure after it is obtained....\r\n\r\n    The most dangerous and irritating feature of the situation,\r\n    however, remains to be mentioned. It is found in the means\r\n    by which the Treasury is despoiled of the gold thus obtained\r\n    (by the sale of bonds) without canceling a single Government\r\n    obligation, and solely for the benefit of those who find profit\r\n    in shipping it abroad, or whose fears induce them to hoard it\r\n    at home. We have outstanding about $500,000,000 of currency\r\n    notes of the Government for which gold may be demanded, and,\r\n    curiously enough, the law requires that when presented, and, in\r\n    fact, redeemed and paid in gold, they shall be reissued. Thus\r\n    the same notes may do duty many times in drawing gold from the\r\n    Treasury; nor can the process be averted so long as private\r\n    parties, for profit or otherwise, see an advantage in repeating\r\n    the operation. More than $300,000,000 of these notes have been\r\n    redeemed in gold, and, notwithstanding such redemption, they\r\n    are still outstanding.\r\n\r\nAfter giving a history of the bond issues already made to replenish the\r\nreserve, and of their results, it was further stated:\r\n\r\n    The financial events of the past year suggest facts and\r\n    conditions which should certainly arrest attention. More than\r\n    $172,000,000 in gold have been drawn out of the Treasury\r\n    during the year for the purpose of shipment abroad or hoarding\r\n    at home.\r\n\r\n    While nearly $103,000,000 was drawn out during the first ten\r\n    months of the year, a sum aggregating more than two-thirds of\r\n    that amount, being about $69,000,000, was drawn out during the\r\n    following two months, thus indicating a marked acceleration of\r\n    the depleting process with the lapse of time.\r\n\r\nFollowing a reference to existing differences of opinion in regard to\r\nthe extent to which silver should be coined or used in our currency,\r\nand the irrelevancy of such differences to the matter in hand, the\r\nmessage continued:\r\n\r\n    While I am not unfriendly to silver, and while I desire to see\r\n    it recognized to such an extent as is consistent with financial\r\n    safety and the preservation of national honor and credit, I am\r\n    not willing to see gold entirely banished from our currency\r\n    and finances. To avert such a consequence I believe thorough\r\n    and radical remedial legislation should be promptly passed.\r\n    I therefore beg the Congress to give the subject immediate\r\n    attention.\r\n\r\nAfter recommending the passage of a law authorizing the issue of\r\nlong-term bonds, bearing a low rate of interest, to be used for the\r\nmaintenance of an adequate gold reserve and in exchange for outstanding\r\nUnited States notes and Treasury notes for the purpose of their\r\ncancelation, and after giving details of the proposed scheme, the\r\nmessage concluded as follows:\r\n\r\n    In conclusion, I desire to frankly confess my reluctance to\r\n    issue more bonds in present circumstances and with no better\r\n    results than have lately followed that course. I cannot,\r\n    however, refrain from adding to an assurance of my anxiety to\r\n    co-operate with the present Congress in any reasonable measure\r\n    of relief, an expression of my determination to leave nothing\r\n    undone which furnishes a hope for improving the situation, or\r\n    checking a suspicion of our disinclination or disability to\r\n    meet, with the strictest honor, every national obligation.\r\n\r\nThis appeal to Congress for legislative aid was absolutely fruitless.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth day of February, 1895, those who, under the mandate of\r\nExecutive duty, were striving, thus unaided, to avert the perils of the\r\nsituation, could count in the gold reserve only the frightfully low sum\r\nof $41,340,181; and it must be remembered that this was only two months\r\nafter the proceeds of the second sale of bonds had been added to the\r\nfund. In point of fact, the withdrawals of gold during the short period\r\nmentioned had exceeded by more than $18,000,000 the amount of such\r\nproceeds; and several million dollars more had been demanded, some of\r\nwhich, though actually taken out, was unexpectedly, and on account of\r\nthe transaction now to be detailed, returned to the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThis sudden fall in the reserve, and the apparent certainty of the\r\ncontinuance of its rapid depletion, seemed to justify the fear that\r\nbefore another bond sale by means of public notice and popular\r\nsubscription could be perfected the gold reserve might be entirely\r\nexhausted; nor could we keep out of mind the apprehension that in\r\nconsequence of repeated dispositions of bonds, with worse instead\r\nof better financial conditions impending, further sales by popular\r\nsubscription might fail of success, except upon terms that would give\r\nthe appearance of impaired national credit.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, no other way seemed to be open to us than\r\nanother public offer of bonds; and it was determined to move in that\r\ndirection immediately.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of this action it was important to obtain certain\r\ninformation and suggestions touching the feeling and disposition of\r\nthose actively prominent in financial and business circles.\r\n\r\nI think it may here be frankly confessed that it never occurred to\r\nany of us to consult, in this emergency, farmers, doctors, lawyers,\r\nshoe-makers, or even statesmen. We could not escape the belief that\r\nthe prospect of obtaining what we needed might be somewhat improved by\r\nmaking application to those whose business and surroundings qualified\r\nthem to intelligently respond.\r\n\r\nTherefore, on the evening of the seventh day of February, 1895, an\r\ninterview was held at the White House with Mr. J. P. Morgan of New\r\nYork; and I propose to give the details of that interview as gathered\r\nfrom a recollection which I do not believe can be at fault. Secretary\r\nCarlisle was present nearly or quite all the time, Attorney-General\r\nOlney was there a portion of the time, and Mr. Morgan and a young man\r\nfrom his office and myself all the time. At the outset Mr. Morgan was\r\ninclined to complain of the treatment he had received from Treasury\r\nofficials in the repudiation of an arrangement which he thought he had\r\nbeen encouraged to perfect in connection with the disposal of another\r\nissue of bonds. I said to Mr. Morgan, whatever there might be in all\r\nthis, another offer of bonds for popular subscription open to all\r\nbidders had been determined upon, and that there were two questions I\r\nwanted to ask him which he ought to be able to answer: one was whether\r\nthe bonds to be so offered would probably be taken at a good price\r\non short notice; and the other was whether, in case there should be\r\nimminent danger of the disappearance of what remained of the gold\r\nreserve, during the time that must elapse between published notice and\r\nthe opening of bids, a sufficient amount of gold could be temporarily\r\nobtained from financial institutions in the city of New York to bridge\r\nover the difficulty and save the reserve until the Government could\r\nrealize upon the sale of its bonds. Mr. Morgan replied that he had no\r\ndoubt bonds could be again sold on popular subscription at some price,\r\nbut he could not say what the price would be; and to the second inquiry\r\nhis answer was that, in his opinion, such an advance of gold as might\r\nbe required could be accomplished if the gold could be kept in this\r\ncountry, but that there might be reluctance to making such an advance\r\nif it was to be immediately withdrawn for shipment abroad, leaving\r\nour financial condition substantially unimproved. After a little\r\nfurther discussion of the situation he suddenly asked me why we did\r\nnot buy $100,000,000 in gold at a fixed price and pay for it in bonds,\r\nunder Section 3700 of the Revised Statutes. This was a proposition\r\nentirely new to me. I turned to the Statutes and read the section he\r\nhad mentioned. Secretary Carlisle confirmed me in the opinion that\r\nthis law abundantly authorized such a transaction, and agreed that it\r\nmight be expedient if favorable terms could be made. The section of the\r\nStatutes referred to reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    _Section 3700._ The Secretary of the Treasury may purchase coin\r\n    with any of the bonds or notes of the United States authorized\r\n    by law, at such rates and upon such terms as he may deem most\r\n    advantageous to the public interest.\r\n\r\nMr. Morgan strongly urged that, if we proceeded under this law, the\r\namount of gold purchased should not be less than $100,000,000; but he\r\nwas at once informed that in no event would more bonds be then issued\r\nthan would be sufficient to provide for adding to the reserve, about\r\n$60,000,000, the amount necessary to raise the fund to $100,000,000.\r\n\r\nNot many months afterward I became convinced that on this point Mr.\r\nMorgan made a wise suggestion; and I have always since regretted that\r\nit was not adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be necessary to state that any plan which would protect\r\nfrom immediate withdrawal the gold we might add to our reserve could\r\nnot fail to be of extreme value. Such of these withdrawals as were\r\nmade for hoarding gold could be prevented only by a restoration of\r\nconfidence among those of our people who had grown suspicious of\r\nthe Government’s financial ability; but the considerable drain from\r\nthe reserve for the purchase of the very bonds to be sold for its\r\nreinforcement, and the much larger drain made by those who profited by\r\nthe shipment of gold abroad, could be, measurably at least, directly\r\narrested. Thus to the extent that foreign gold might be brought here\r\nand used for the purchase of bonds, the use for that purpose of such\r\nas was held by our own people or as was already in the reserve subject\r\nto their withdrawal would not only be decreased, but the current of\r\nthe passage of gold would be changed and would flow toward us instead\r\nof away from us, making the prospect of profit in gold exportation\r\nless alluring. An influx of gold from abroad would also have a tendency\r\nto decrease the sentimental estimate of its desirability which its\r\nunrelieved scarcity was apt to create in timid minds. It was especially\r\nplain that so far as withdrawals from our reserve for speculative\r\nshipment abroad were concerned, they could be discouraged by the\r\nefforts of those whose financial connections in other countries enabled\r\nthem to sell gold exchange on foreign money centers at a price which\r\nwould make the actual transportation of the coin itself unprofitable.\r\n\r\nThe position of Mr. Morgan and the other parties in interest whom he\r\nrepresented was such in the business world that they were abundantly\r\nable, not only to furnish the gold we needed, but to protect us in\r\nthe manner indicated against its immediate loss. Their willingness to\r\nundertake both these services was developed during the discussion of\r\nthe plan proposed; and after careful consideration of every detail\r\nuntil a late hour of the night, an agreement was made by which J. P.\r\nMorgan & Co. of New York, for themselves and for J. S. Morgan & Co.\r\nof London; and August Belmont & Co. of New York, for themselves and\r\nfor N. M. Rothschild & Son of London, were to sell and deliver to the\r\nGovernment 3,500,000 ounces of standard gold coin of the United States,\r\nto be paid for in bonds bearing annual interest at the rate of four per\r\ncent. per annum, and payable at the pleasure of the Government after\r\nthirty years from their date, such bonds to be issued and delivered\r\nfrom time to time as the gold coin to be furnished was deposited by\r\nsaid parties in the subtreasuries or other legal depositories of the\r\nUnited States. At least one half of the coin so delivered was to be\r\nobtained in Europe, and shipped from there in amounts not less than\r\n300,000 ounces per month, at the expense and risk of the parties\r\nfurnishing the same; and so far as it was in their power they were\r\nto “exert all financial influence and make all legitimate efforts to\r\nprotect the Treasury of the United States against the withdrawals of\r\ngold pending the complete performance of the contract.”\r\n\r\nFour per cent. bonds were selected for use in this transaction instead\r\nof ten-year bonds bearing five per cent. interest, because their\r\nmaturity was extended to thirty years, thus offering a more permanent\r\nand inviting investment, and for the further reason that $100,000,000\r\nof shorter five per cent. bonds had already been issued, and it was,\r\ntherefore, deemed desirable to postpone these further bond obligations\r\nof the Government to a later date. The price agreed upon for the gold\r\ncoin to be delivered was such that the bonds given in payment therefor\r\nwould yield to the investor an annual income of three and three fourths\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that the only bonds which could be utilized\r\nin our efforts to maintain our gold reserve were those described in a\r\nlaw passed as early as 1870, and made available for our uses by an act\r\npassed in 1875. The terms of these bonds were ill suited to later ideas\r\nof investment, and they were made payable in coin and not specifically\r\nin gold. Nothing at any time induced the exchange of gold for these\r\ncoin bonds, except a reliance upon such a measure of good faith on the\r\npart of the Government, and honesty on the part of the people, as would\r\nassure their payment in gold coin and not in depreciated silver.\r\n\r\nIt was exceedingly fortunate that, at the time this agreement was under\r\nconsideration, certain political movements calculated to undermine this\r\nreliance upon the Government’s continued financial integrity were not\r\nin sight; but it was, nevertheless, very apparent that the difficulties\r\nof the situation would be greatly lessened if, in safeguarding our\r\nreserve, bonds could be used payable by their terms in gold, and\r\nbearing a rate of interest not exceeding three per cent. Accordingly,\r\nat the instance of Secretary Carlisle, a bill had been introduced in\r\nthe House of Representatives, some time before the Morgan-Belmont\r\nagreement was entered upon, which authorized the issue of bonds of that\r\ndescription. A few hours before the agreement was consummated this\r\nsane and sensible legislation was brought to a vote in the House and\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nWhen, in our interview with Mr. Morgan, the price for the gold to be\r\nfurnished was considered, he gave reasons which we could not well\r\nanswer in support of the terms finally agreed upon; but he said that\r\nthe parties offering to furnish the gold would be glad to accept at par\r\nthree per cent. bonds, payable by their terms in gold instead of in\r\ncoin, in case their issue could be authorized. He expressed not only a\r\nwillingness but a strong desire that a substitution might be made of\r\nsuch bonds in lieu of those already selected, and readily agreed to\r\nallow us time to procure the necessary legislation for that purpose.\r\nHe explained, however, that only a short time could be stipulated\r\nfor such a substitution, because in order to carry out successfully\r\nthe agreement contemplated, the bonds must be offered in advance to\r\ninvestors both here and abroad, and that after numerous subscriptions\r\nhad been received from outside parties the form and condition of the\r\nsecurities could not be changed; and he added that, but for this, there\r\nwould be no objection to the concession of all the time desired. It\r\nwas finally agreed that ten days should be allowed us to secure from\r\nCongress the legislation necessary to permit the desired substitution\r\nof bonds. A simple calculation demonstrated that by such a substitution\r\nthe Government would save on account of interest more than $16,000,000\r\nbefore the maturity of the bonds. It was further stipulated on the part\r\nof the Government that if the Secretary of the Treasury should desire\r\nto sell any further bonds on or before October 1, 1895, they should\r\nfirst be offered to the parties then represented by Mr. Morgan. This\r\nstipulation did not become operative.\r\n\r\nWhen our conference terminated it was understood that Secretary\r\nCarlisle and Attorney-General Olney should act for the Government at\r\na meeting between the parties early the following day, at which the\r\nagreement we had made was to be reduced to writing; and thereupon I\r\nprepared a message which was submitted to the Congress at the opening\r\nof its session on the following day, in which the details of our\r\nagreement were set forth and the amount which would be saved to the\r\nGovernment by the substitution of three per cent. gold bonds was\r\nplainly stated; but having no memorandum of the agreement before me,\r\nin my haste I carelessly omitted to mention the efforts agreed on by\r\nMr. Morgan and his associates to prevent gold shipments. The next\r\nmorning a contract embodying our agreement was drawn and signed, and a\r\ncopy at once given to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee of\r\nthe House, so that the delay of a demand for its inspection might be\r\navoided. A bill was also immediately introduced again giving authority\r\nto issue three per cent. bonds, payable by their terms in gold, to be\r\nsubstituted in place of the four per cent. bonds as provided in the\r\ncontract--to the end that $16,000,000 might be saved to the Government,\r\nand the public welfare in every way subserved.\r\n\r\nThe object of this message was twofold. It was deemed important,\r\nconsidering the critical condition of our gold reserve, that the public\r\nshould be speedily informed of the steps taken for its protection; and\r\nin addition, though previous efforts to obtain helpful legislation had\r\nresulted in discouragement, it was hoped that when the saving by the\r\nGovernment of $16,000,000 was seen to depend on the action of Congress\r\nthere might be a response that would accord with patriotic public duty.\r\n\r\nQuite in keeping with the congressional habit prevailing at that time,\r\nthe needed legislation was refused, and this money was not saved.\r\n\r\nThe contract was thereupon carried out as originally made. In its\r\nexecution four per cent. bonds were delivered amounting to $62,315,400,\r\nand the sum of $65,116,244.62 in gold received as their price. The\r\nlast deposit in completion of the contract was made in June, 1895, but\r\nadditional gold was obtained from the contracting parties in exchange\r\nfor United States notes and Treasury notes until in September, 1895,\r\nwhen the entire amount of gold received from them under the contract\r\nand through such exchanges had amounted to more than $81,000,000. The\r\nterms of the agreement were so well carried out, not only in the matter\r\nof furnishing gold, but in procuring it from abroad and protecting the\r\nreserve from withdrawals, that during its continuance the operation\r\nof the “endless chain” which had theretofore drained our gold was\r\ninterrupted. No gold was, during that period, taken from the Treasury\r\nto be used in the purchase of bonds, as had previously been the case,\r\nnor was any withdrawn for shipment abroad.\r\n\r\nIt became manifest, however, soon after this contract was fully\r\nperformed, that our financial ailments had reached a stage so nearly\r\nchronic that their cure by any treatment within Executive reach might\r\nwell be considered a matter of anxious doubt. In the latter months of\r\nthe year 1895 a scarcity of foreign exchange and its high rate, the\r\ntermination of the safeguards of the Morgan-Belmont contract, and, as\r\na result, the renewal of opportunity profitably to withdraw gold for\r\nexport with a newly stimulated popular apprehension, and perhaps other\r\ndisturbing incidents, brought about a recurrence of serious depletions\r\nof gold from the reserve.\r\n\r\nIn the annual Executive message sent to Congress on the second day\r\nof December, 1895, the situation of our finances and currency was\r\nset forth in detail, and another earnest plea was made for remedial\r\nlegislative action. After mentioning the immediately satisfactory\r\nresults of the contract for the purchase of gold, the message continued:\r\n\r\n    Though the contract mentioned stayed for a time the tide of\r\n    gold withdrawals, its good results could not be permanent.\r\n    Recent withdrawals have reduced the reserve from $107,571,230\r\n    on the eighth day of July, 1895, to $79,333,966. How long it\r\n    will remain large enough to render its increase unnecessary is\r\n    only a matter of conjecture, though quite large withdrawals for\r\n    shipment in the immediate future are predicted in well-informed\r\n    quarters. About $16,000,000 has been withdrawn during the month\r\n    of November.\r\n\r\nThe prediction of further withdrawals mentioned in this message was so\r\nfully verified that eighteen days after its transmission, and on the\r\ntwentieth day of December, 1895, another Executive communication was\r\nsent to Congress, in contemplation of its holiday recess, in which,\r\nafter referring to the details contained in the former message, it was\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    The contingency then feared has reached us, and the withdrawals\r\n    of gold since the communication referred to, and others\r\n    that appear inevitable, threaten such a depletion in our\r\n    Government’s gold reserve as brings us face to face with the\r\n    necessity of further action for its protection. This condition\r\n    is intensified by the prevalence in certain quarters of sudden\r\n    and unusual apprehension and timidity in business circles.\r\n\r\n    The real and sensible cure for our recurring troubles can only\r\n    be effected by a complete change in our financial scheme.\r\n    Pending that, the Executive branch of the Government will not\r\n    relax its efforts nor abandon its determination to use every\r\n    means within its reach to maintain before the world American\r\n    credit, nor will there be any hesitation in exhibiting its\r\n    confidence in the resources of our country and the constant\r\n    patriotism of our people.\r\n\r\n    In view, however, of the peculiar situation now confronting us,\r\n    I have ventured to herein express the earnest hope that the\r\n    Congress, in default of the inauguration of a better system\r\n    of finance, will not take a recess from its labors before it\r\n    has, by legislative enactment or declaration, done something,\r\n    not only to remind those apprehensive among our own people\r\n    that the resources of this Government and a scrupulous regard\r\n    for honest dealing afford a sure guarantee of unquestioned\r\n    safety and soundness, but to reassure the world that with these\r\n    factors, and the patriotism of our citizens, the ability and\r\n    determination of our nation to meet in any circumstances every\r\n    obligation it incurs do not admit of question.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it should not have been expected that members of Congress would\r\npermit troublesome thoughts of the Government’s financial difficulties\r\nto disturb the pleasant anticipations of their holiday recess; at\r\nany rate, these difficulties and the appeal of the President for at\r\nleast some manifestation of a disposition to aid in their remedy were\r\ncompletely ignored.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth day of January, 1896, the gold reserve having fallen\r\nto $61,251,710, its immediate repair became imperative. Though our\r\nresort to the expedient of purchasing gold with bonds under contract\r\nhad been productive of very satisfactory results, it by no means\r\nindicated our abandonment of the policy of inviting offerings of gold\r\nby public advertisement. It was rather an exceptional departure from\r\nthat policy, made necessary by the dangerously low state of the reserve\r\non account of extensive and sudden depletions, and the peril attending\r\nany delay in replenishing it. We had not lost faith in the loyalty\r\nand patriotism of the people, nor did we doubt their willingness to\r\nrespond to an appeal from their Government in any emergency. We also\r\nconfidently believed that if the bonds issued for the purpose of\r\nincreasing our stock of gold were widely distributed among our people,\r\nself-interest as well as patriotism would stimulate the solicitude of\r\nthe masses of our citizens for the welfare of the nation. No reason\r\nfor discouragement had been found in public offerings for bonds, so\r\nfar as obtaining a needed supply of gold and a fair price for our\r\nbonds were concerned. The failure of their wide distribution among\r\nthe people when so disposed of seemed to be largely owing to the fact\r\nthat the bonds themselves were so antiquated in form, and bore so high\r\na rate of interest, that it was difficult for an ordinary person to\r\nmake the rather confusing computation of premium and other factors\r\nnecessary to a safe and intelligent bid. In a transaction of this\r\nsort, where the smallest fraction of a cent may determine the success\r\nof an offer, those accustomed to the niceties of financial calculations\r\nare apt to hold the field to the exclusion of many who, unaided, dare\r\nnot trust themselves in the haze of such intricacies. If Congress had\r\nprovided for the issuance of bonds bearing a low rate of interest,\r\nwhich could have been offered to the public at par, I am convinced\r\nthat the plain people of the land would more generally have become\r\npurchasers. Another difficulty that had to some extent prevented a more\r\ncommon participation by the people in prior public sales arose, it was\r\nthought, from their lack of notice of the pendency of such sales, and\r\nwant of information as to the advantages of the investment offered, and\r\nthe procedure necessary to present their bids in proper form.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that the gold then in the reserve amounted to\r\n$20,000,000 more than it contained eleven months earlier, when the\r\nMorgan-Belmont contract was made, and because, for that reason, more\r\ntime could be allowed for its replenishment, there was no hesitation\r\nin deciding upon a return to our original plan of offering bonds in\r\nexchange for gold by public subscription.\r\n\r\nHaving determined upon a return to this method, it was deemed wise,\r\nupon consideration of all the circumstances, to make some modification\r\nof prior action in such cases. Instead of short-term five per cent.\r\nbonds, the longer-term bonds bearing four per cent. interest were\r\nsubstituted, as, on the whole, the best we could offer for popular\r\nsubscription. Since two offerings of $50,000,000 each had proved to\r\nbe of only very temporary benefit, it was determined to double the\r\namount and offer $100,000,000 for subscription. Nearly a month was to\r\nbe given instead of a shorter time, as theretofore, between the date\r\nof notice of the offer and the opening of the bids; and extraordinary\r\nefforts were to be made to give the most thorough publicity to the\r\nofferings--to the end that we might stimulate in every possible way the\r\ndesire of the masses of our people to invest in the bonds. Especial\r\ninformation and aid were to be furnished for the guidance of those\r\ninclined to subscribe; and successful bidders were to be allowed to pay\r\nfor the bonds awarded to them in instalments. The lowest denomination\r\nof the bonds was to be fifty dollars, and the larger ones were to be in\r\nmultiples of that sum. In point of fact, it was resolved that nothing\r\nshould be left undone which would in any way promote the success of\r\nthis additional and increased offer of bond subscription to the public.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the sixth day of January, 1896, a circular bearing\r\nthat date was issued, giving notice that proposals would be received\r\nuntil the fifth day of February following for gold coin purchases of\r\n$100,000,000 of the four per cent. bonds of the United States, upon\r\nthe terms above mentioned. These circulars were extensively published\r\nin the newspapers throughout the country. Copies, together with a\r\nletter of instruction to bidders, containing, among other things, a\r\ncomputation showing the income the bonds would yield to the investor\r\nupon their purchase at prices therein specified, and accompanied by\r\nblanks for subscription, were sent to the postmasters in every State\r\nand Territory with directions that they should be conspicuously\r\ndisplayed in their offices. The Comptroller of the Currency prepared\r\nand sent to all national banks a circular letter, urging them to call\r\nthe attention of their patrons to the desirability of obtaining the\r\nbonds as an investment, and to aid in stimulating subscriptions; and\r\nwith this was forwarded a complete set of papers similar to those sent\r\nto the postmasters. These papers were also sent to other banks and\r\nfinancial institutions and to bankers in all parts of the country,\r\nand, in addition, notice was given that they could be obtained upon\r\napplication to the Treasury Department or any of the subtreasuries\r\nof the United States. Soon afterward, in view of the large amount of\r\nthe bonds offered, and as a precaution against an undue strain upon\r\nthe general money market, as well as to permit the greatest possible\r\nopportunity for subscription, the terms of the original offer of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury were modified by reducing in amount the\r\ninstalments of the purchase price and extending the time for their\r\npayment.\r\n\r\nOn an examination of the bids at the expiration of the time limited\r\nfor their presentation, it was found that 4635 bids had been received,\r\nafter rejecting six which were palpably not genuine or not made in good\r\nfaith. The bidders were scattered through forty-seven of our States and\r\nTerritories, and the aggregate amount represented by their bids was\r\n$526,970,000. The number of accepted bids upon which bonds were awarded\r\nwas only 828, and of these ten were forfeited after acceptance, on\r\naccount of non-payment of the first instalment of the purchase price.\r\nSeveral of the bids accepted were for a single fifty-dollar bond, and\r\nthey varied in amount from that to one bid made by J. P. Morgan & Co.\r\nand several associates for the entire issue of $100,000,000, for which\r\nthey offered 110.6877 on the dollar. To all the other 827 accepted\r\nbidders who offered even the smallest fraction of a farthing more than\r\nthis the full number of bonds for which they bid were awarded.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate of the bonds awarded to these bidders, excluding the\r\nMorgan bid, amounted to $62,321,150. The remainder of the entire\r\noffering, including more than $4,700,000 of the awards which became\r\nforfeited for non-payment as above mentioned, were awarded to Mr.\r\nMorgan and his associates, their bid being the highest next to those on\r\nwhich bonds had been awarded in full, as already stated.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate of the prices received for these bonds represented, by\r\nreason of the premiums paid, an income to the investor of a trifle less\r\nthan three and four tenths per cent.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this large sale of bonds, the gold reserve, which, on\r\nthe last day of January, 1896, amounted to less than $50,000,000, was\r\nso increased that at the end of February, in spite of withdrawals in\r\nthe meantime, it stood at nearly $124,000,000.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that, notwithstanding all the efforts made to\r\ndistribute this issue of bonds among the people, but 827 bids out of\r\n4641 were entitled to awards as being above the Morgan bid; and that\r\nmore than one third of all the bonds sold were awarded on the single\r\nbid of Mr. Morgan and his associates.\r\n\r\nThe price received on this public sale was apparently somewhat better\r\nfor the Government than that secured by the Morgan-Belmont contract;\r\nbut their agreement required of them such labor, risk, and expense\r\nas perhaps entitled them to a favorable bargain. In any event, the\r\nadvantages the Government derived from this contract were certainly\r\nvery valuable and should not be overlooked. On every sale of bonds by\r\npublic offering, not excluding that just mentioned, large amounts of\r\ngold were withdrawn from the Treasury and used in paying for the bonds\r\noffered. In the execution of the contract of February, 1895, no gold\r\nwas withdrawn for the purchase of the bonds, and the reserve received\r\nthe full benefit of the transaction. Each sale by public advertisement\r\nmade prior to the time of the contract had been so quickly followed\r\nby extensive and wasting withdrawals of gold from the reserve, that\r\nscarcely a breathing-time was allowed before we were again overtaken\r\nby the necessity for its reinforcement. Even after the notice given\r\nfor the last sale on the eighth day of January, 1896, and between that\r\ndate and the 1st of June following, these withdrawals amounted to more\r\nthan $73,000,000, while during the six months or more of the existence\r\nof the Morgan-Belmont contract the withdrawals of gold for export\r\nwere entirely prevented and a season of financial quiet and peace was\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the comparative merits of the two plans for maintaining\r\nour gold reserve, both of them when utilized were abundantly and\r\nclearly justified.\r\n\r\nWhether from fatigue of malign conditions or other causes, ever since\r\nthe last large sale of bonds was made the gold reserve has been so free\r\nfrom depletion that its condition has caused no alarm.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and sixty-two millions of dollars in bonds were issued on\r\nits account during the critical time covered by this narrative; but the\r\ncredit and fair fame of our nation were saved.\r\n\r\nI have attempted to give a detailed history of the crime charged\r\nagainst an administration which “issued bonds of the Government in\r\ntime of peace.” Without shame and without repentance, I confess my\r\nshare of the guilt; and I refuse to shield my accomplices in this crime\r\nwho, with me, held high places in that administration. And though Mr.\r\nMorgan and Mr. Belmont and scores of other bankers and financiers who\r\nwere accessories in these transactions may be steeped in destructive\r\npropensities, and may be constantly busy in sinful schemes, I shall\r\nalways recall with satisfaction and self-congratulation my association\r\nwith them at a time when our country sorely needed their aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VENEZUELAN BOUNDARY CONTROVERSY\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThere is no better illustration of the truth that nations and\r\nindividuals are affected in the same manner by like causes than is\r\noften furnished by the beginning, progress, and results of a national\r\nboundary dispute. We all know that among individuals, when neighbors\r\nhave entered upon a quarrel concerning their division-line or the\r\nlocation of a line fence, they will litigate until all account of\r\ncost and all regard for the merits of the contention give place to\r\na ruthless and all-dominating determination, by fair means or foul,\r\nto win; and if fisticuffs and forcible possession are resorted to,\r\nthe big, strong neighbor rejoices in his strength as he mauls and\r\ndisfigures his small and weak antagonist.\r\n\r\nIt will be found that nations behave in like fashion. One or the other\r\nof two national neighbors claims that their dividing-line should be\r\ndefined or rectified in a certain manner. If this is questioned, a\r\nseason of diplomatic untruthfulness and finesse sometimes intervenes\r\nfor the sake of appearances. Developments soon follow, however, that\r\nexpose a grim determination behind fine phrases of diplomacy; and in\r\nthe end the weaker nation frequently awakens to the fact that it must\r\neither accede to an ultimatum dictated by its stronger adversary, or\r\nlook in the face of war and a spoliation of its territory; and if such\r\na stage is reached, superior strength and fighting ability, instead of\r\nsuggesting magnanimity, are graspingly used to enforce extreme demands\r\nif not to consummate extensive conquest or complete subjugation.\r\n\r\nI propose to call attention to one of these unhappy national boundary\r\ndisputes, between the kingdom of Great Britain and the South American\r\nrepublic of Venezuela, involving the boundary-line separating Venezuela\r\nfrom the English colony of British Guiana, which adjoins Venezuela on\r\nthe east.\r\n\r\nVenezuela, once a Spanish possession, declared her independence in\r\n1810, and a few years afterward united with two other of Spain’s\r\nrevolted colonies in forming the old Colombian federal union, which\r\nwas recognized by the United States in 1822. In 1836 this union was\r\ndissolved and Venezuela became again a separate and independent\r\nrepublic, being promptly recognized as such by our Government and by\r\nother powers. Spain, however, halted in her recognition until 1845,\r\nwhen she quite superfluously ceded to Venezuela by treaty the territory\r\nwhich as an independent republic she had actually owned and possessed\r\nsince 1810. But neither in this treaty nor in any other mention of\r\nthe area of the republic were its boundaries described with more\r\ndefiniteness than as being “the same as those which marked the ancient\r\nviceroyalty and captaincy-general of New Granada and Venezuela in the\r\nyear 1810.”\r\n\r\nEngland derived title to the colony of Guiana from Holland in 1814,\r\nby a treaty in which the territory was described as “the Cape of Good\r\nHope and the establishments of Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice.” No\r\nboundaries of those settlements or “establishments” were given in the\r\ntreaty, nor does it appear that any such boundaries had ever been\r\nparticularly defined.\r\n\r\nIt is quite apparent that the limits of these adjoining countries thus\r\nlacking any mention of definite metes and bounds, were in need of\r\nextraneous assistance before they could be exactly fixed, and that\r\ntheir proper location was quite likely to lead to serious disagreement.\r\nIn such circumstances threatening complications can frequently be\r\navoided if the adjoining neighbors agree upon a divisional line\r\npromptly, and before their demands are stimulated and their tenacity\r\nincreased by a real or fancied advance in the value of the possessions\r\nto be divided, or other incidents have intervened to render it more\r\ndifficult to make concessions.\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to sketch the facts and arguments that bear upon\r\nthe exact merits of this boundary controversy between Great Britain and\r\nVenezuela. They have been thoroughly examined by an arbitral tribunal\r\nto which the entire difficulty was referred, and by whose determination\r\nthe boundary between the two countries has been fixed--perhaps in\r\nstrict accord with justice, but at all events finally and irrevocably.\r\nInasmuch, however, as our own country became in a sense involved in the\r\ncontroversy, or at least deeply concerned in its settlement, I have\r\nthought there might be interest in an explanation of the manner and the\r\nprocesses by which the interposition of the United States Government\r\nwas brought about. I must not be expected to exclude from mention\r\nevery circumstance that may relate to the merits of the dispute as\r\nbetween the parties primarily concerned; but so far as I make use of\r\nsuch circumstances I intend to do so only in aid and simplification of\r\nthe explanation I have undertaken.\r\n\r\nThis dispute began in 1841. On October 5 of that year the Venezuelan\r\nminister to Great Britain, in a note to Lord Aberdeen, Principal\r\nSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, after reminding the secretary\r\nthat a proposal made by Venezuela on the 28th of January, 1841, for\r\njoint action in the matter of fixing a divisional boundary, still\r\nawaited the acceptance of Great Britain, wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n    The Honorable Earl of Aberdeen may now judge of the surprise of\r\n    the Government of Venezuela upon learning that in the territory\r\n    of the Republic a sentry-box has been erected upon which the\r\n    British flag has been raised. The Venezuelan Government is in\r\n    ignorance of the origin and purport of these proceedings, and\r\n    hopes that they may receive some satisfactory explanation of\r\n    this action. In the meantime the undersigned, in compliance\r\n    with the instructions communicated to him, urges upon the\r\n    Honorable Earl of Aberdeen the necessity of entering into a\r\n    treaty of boundaries as a previous step to the fixation of\r\n    limits, and begs to ask for an answer to the above-mentioned\r\n    communication of January 28.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen, in his reply, dated October 21, 1841, makes the\r\nfollowing statement:\r\n\r\n    Her Majesty’s Government has received from the Governor of\r\n    British Guiana, Mr. Schomburgk’s report of his proceedings in\r\n    execution of the commission with which he has been charged.\r\n    That report states that Mr. Schomburgk set out from Demerara in\r\n    April last and was on his return to the Essequibo River at the\r\n    end of June. It appears that Mr. Schomburgk planted boundary\r\n    posts at certain points of the country which he has surveyed,\r\n    and that he was fully aware that the demarcation so made was\r\n    merely a preliminary measure, open to further discussion\r\n    between the Governments of Great Britain and Venezuela. But\r\n    it does not appear that Mr. Schomburgk left behind him any\r\n    guard-house, sentry-box, or other building having the British\r\n    flag.\r\n\r\n    With respect to the proposal of the Venezuelan Government\r\n    that the Governments of Great Britain and Venezuela should\r\n    conclude a treaty as a preliminary step to the demarcation\r\n    of the boundaries between British Guiana and Venezuela, the\r\n    undersigned begs leave to observe that it appears to him that\r\n    if it should be necessary to make a treaty upon the subject of\r\n    the boundaries in question, such a measure should follow rather\r\n    than precede the operation of the survey.\r\n\r\nIn a communication dated the 18th of November, 1841, the Venezuelan\r\nminister, after again complaining of the acts of Schomburgk and\r\nalleging that he “has planted at a point on the mouth of the Orinoco\r\nseveral posts bearing Her Majesty’s initials, and raised at the\r\nsame place, with a show of armed forces, the British flag, and also\r\nperformed several other acts of dominion and government,” refers to\r\nthe great dissatisfaction aroused in Venezuela by what he calls “this\r\nundeserved offense,” and adds: “The undersigned therefore has no doubts\r\nbut that he will obtain from Her Majesty’s Government a reparation for\r\nthe wrong done to the dignity of the Republic, and that those signs\r\nwhich have so unpleasantly shaken public confidence will be ordered\r\nremoved.”\r\n\r\nNo early response having been made to this communication, another\r\nwas addressed to Lord Aberdeen, dated December 8, 1841, in which the\r\nrepresentative of Venezuela refers to his previous unanswered note and\r\nto a recent order received from his government, which he says directs\r\nhim “to insist not only upon the conclusion of a treaty fixing the\r\nboundaries between Venezuela and British Guiana, but also, and this\r\nvery particularly, to insist upon the removal of the signs set up,\r\ncontrary to all rights, by the surveyor R. H. Schomburgk in Barima\r\nand in other points of the Venezuelan territory”; and he continues:\r\n“In his afore-mentioned communication of the 18th of last month, the\r\nundersigned has already informed the Honorable Earl of Aberdeen of\r\nthe dissatisfaction prevailing among the Venezuelans on this account,\r\nand now adds that this dissatisfaction, far from diminishing, grows\r\nstronger--as is but natural--as time goes on and no reparation of the\r\nwrongs is made.”\r\n\r\nThese two notes of the Venezuelan minister were answered on the\r\neleventh day of December, 1841. In his reply Lord Aberdeen says:\r\n\r\n    The undersigned begs leave to refer to his note of the 21st\r\n    of October last, in which he explained that the proceeding of\r\n    Mr. Schomburgk in planting boundary posts at certain points\r\n    of the country which he has surveyed was merely a preliminary\r\n    measure open to future discussion between the two Governments,\r\n    and that it would be premature to make a boundary treaty before\r\n    the survey will be completed. The undersigned has only further\r\n    to state that much unnecessary inconvenience would result from\r\n    the removal of the posts fixed by Mr. Schomburgk, as they\r\n    will afford the only tangible means by which Her Majesty’s\r\n    Government can be prepared to discuss the question of the\r\n    boundaries with the Government of Venezuela. These posts were\r\n    erected for that express purpose, and not, as the Venezuelan\r\n    Government appears to apprehend, as indications of dominion and\r\n    empire on the part of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn a reply to this note, after referring to the explanation of the\r\npurpose of these posts or signs which Lord Aberdeen had given, it was\r\nsaid, in further urging their removal: “The undersigned regrets to be\r\nobliged to again insist upon this point; but the damages sustained by\r\nVenezuela on account of the permanence of said signs are so serious\r\nthat he hopes in view of those facts that the trouble resulting from\r\ntheir removal may not appear useless.” The minister followed this\r\ninsistence with such earnest argument that on the thirty-first day of\r\nJanuary, 1842, nearly four months after the matter was first agitated,\r\nLord Aberdeen informed the Venezuelan minister that instructions would\r\nbe sent to the governor of British Guiana directing him to remove the\r\nposts which had been placed by Mr. Schomburgk near the Orinoco. He,\r\nhowever, accompanied this assurance with the distinct declaration\r\n“that although, in order to put an end to the misapprehension which\r\nappears to prevail in Venezuela with regard to the object of Mr.\r\nSchomburgk’s survey, the undersigned has consented to comply with the\r\nrenewed representation of the Minister upon this affair, Her Majesty’s\r\nGovernment must not be understood to abandon any portion of the rights\r\nof Great Britain over the territory which was formerly held by the\r\nDutch in Guiana.”\r\n\r\nIt should be here stated that the work which Schomburgk performed\r\nat the instance of the British Government consisted not only in\r\nplacing monuments of some sort at the mouth of the Orinoco River,\r\nupon territory claimed by Venezuela, but also in locating from such\r\nmonuments a complete dividing-line running far inland and annexing to\r\nBritish Guiana on the west a large region which Venezuela also claimed.\r\nThis line, as originally located or as afterward still further extended\r\nto the west, came to be called “the Schomburgk line.”\r\n\r\nThe Orinoco River, flowing eastward to the sea, is a very broad\r\nand deep waterway, which, with its affluents, would in any event,\r\nand however the bounds of Venezuela might be limited, traverse a\r\nvery extensive portion of that country’s area; and its control and\r\nfree navigation are immensely important factors in the progress and\r\nprosperity of the republic. Substantially at the mouth of the Orinoco,\r\nand on its south side, two quite large rivers, the Barima and the\r\nAmacuro, flow into the sea. The region adjacent to the mouth of those\r\nrivers has, sometimes at least, been called Barima; and it was here\r\nthat the posts or signs complained of by Venezuela were placed.\r\n\r\nThe coast from the mouth of the Orinoco River slopes or drops to the\r\neast and south; and some distance from that river’s mouth, in the\r\ndirections mentioned, the Essequibo, a large river flowing for a long\r\ndistance from the south, empties into the sea.\r\n\r\nAfter the correspondence I have mentioned, which resulted in the\r\nremoval of the so-called initial monuments of the Schomburgk line\r\nfrom the Barima region, there seems to have been less activity in\r\nthe boundary discussion until January 31, 1844, when the Venezuelan\r\nminister to England again addressed Lord Aberdeen on the subject.\r\nHe referred to the erection of the Schomburgk monuments and the\r\ncomplaints of Venezuela on that account, and stated that since the\r\nremoval of those monuments he had not ceased to urge Lord Aberdeen “to\r\ncommence without delay negotiations for a treaty fixing definitely\r\nthe boundary-line that shall divide the two countries.” He adds the\r\nfollowing very sensible statement: “Although it was undoubtedly\r\nthe duty of the one who promoted this question to take the first\r\nstep toward the negotiation of the treaty, the undersigned being\r\nwell aware that other important matters claim the attention of Her\r\nMajesty’s Government, and as he ought not to wait indefinitely, hastens\r\nto propose an agreement which, if left for a later date, may be\r\ndifficult to conclude.” It is disappointing to observe that the good\r\nsense exhibited in this statement did not hold out to the end of the\r\nminister’s communication. After a labored presentation of historical\r\nincidents, beginning with the discovery of the American continent,\r\nhe concludes by putting forward the Essequibo River as the proper\r\nboundary-line between the two countries. This was a proposition of\r\nsuch extreme pretensions that the Venezuelan representative knew, or\r\nought to have known, it would not be considered for a moment by the\r\nGovernment of Great Britain; and it seems to me that a diplomatic error\r\nwas made when, failing to apprehend the fact that the exigencies of the\r\nsituation called for a show of concession, the Venezuelan minister,\r\ninstead of intimating a disposition to negotiate, gave Great Britain an\r\nopportunity to be first in making proposals apparently calculated to\r\nmeet the needs of conciliation and compromise.\r\n\r\nThus two months after the receipt of this communication,--on the\r\nthirtieth day of March, 1844,--Lord Aberdeen sent his reply. After\r\ncombating the allegations contained in the letter of the Venezuelan\r\nrepresentative, he remarked that if he were inclined to act upon the\r\nspirit of that letter, it was evident that he ought to claim on behalf\r\nof Great Britain, as the rightful successor to Holland, all the coast\r\nfrom the Orinoco to the Essequibo. Then follows this significant\r\ndeclaration:\r\n\r\n    But the undersigned believes that the negotiations would not\r\n    be free from difficulties if claims that cannot be sustained\r\n    are presented, and shall not therefore follow Señor Fortique’s\r\n    example, but state here the concessions that Great Britain\r\n    is disposed to make of her rights, prompted by a friendly\r\n    consideration for Venezuela and by her desire to avoid all\r\n    cause of serious controversies between the two countries. Being\r\n    convinced that the most important object for the interests\r\n    of Venezuela is the exclusive possession of the Orinoco, Her\r\n    Majesty’s Government is ready to yield to the Republic of\r\n    Venezuela a portion of the coast sufficient to insure her the\r\n    free control of the mouth of this her principal river, and to\r\n    prevent its being under the control of any foreign power.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen further declared that, “with this end in view, and\r\nbeing persuaded that a concession of the greatest importance has been\r\nmade to Venezuela,” he would consent on behalf of Great Britain to a\r\nboundary which he particularly defined, and in general terms may be\r\ndescribed as beginning in the mouth of the Moroco River, which is on\r\nthe coast southeast of the mouth of the Orinoco River and about two\r\nthirds of the distance between that point and the Essequibo River, said\r\nboundary running inland from that point until it included in its course\r\nconsiderably more territory than was embraced within the original\r\nSchomburgk line, though it excluded the region embraced within that\r\nline adjacent to the Barima and Amacuro rivers and the mouth of the\r\nOrinoco.\r\n\r\nThis boundary, as proposed by Lord Aberdeen, was not satisfactory to\r\nVenezuela; and soon after its submission her diplomatic representative\r\ndied. This interruption was quickly followed by a long period of\r\ndistressing internal strifes and revolutions, which so distracted and\r\ndisturbed her government that for more than thirty years she was not in\r\ncondition to renew negotiations for an adjustment of her territorial\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time Great Britain seemed not especially unwilling to\r\nallow these negotiations to remain in abeyance.\r\n\r\nThis interval was not, however, entirely devoid of boundary incidents.\r\nIn 1850 great excitement and indignation were aroused among the\r\nVenezuelans by a rumor that Great Britain intended to take possession\r\nof Venezuelan Guiana, a province adjoining British Guiana on the west,\r\nand a part of the territory claimed by Venezuela; and the feeling thus\r\nengendered became so extreme, both among the people and on the part of\r\nthe government of the republic, that all remaining friendliness between\r\nthe two countries was seriously menaced. Demonstrations indicating that\r\nVenezuela was determined to repel the rumored movement as an invasion\r\nof her rights, were met by instructions given by Great Britain to the\r\ncommander of her Majesty’s naval forces in the West Indies as to the\r\ncourse he was to pursue if the Venezuelan forces should construct\r\nfortifications within the territory in dispute. At the same time, Mr.\r\nBalford Hinton Wilson, England’s representative at Caracas, in a note\r\naddressed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs for Venezuela, indignantly\r\ncharacterized these disquieting rumors of Great Britain’s intention\r\nto occupy the lands mentioned, as mischievous, and maliciously false;\r\nbut he also declared that, on the other hand, her Majesty’s Government\r\nwould not see with indifference the aggressions of Venezuela upon the\r\ndisputed territory.\r\n\r\nThis note contained, in addition, a rather impressive pronouncement in\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n    The Venezuelan Government, in justice to Great Britain, cannot\r\n    mistrust for a moment the sincerity of the formal declaration,\r\n    which is now made in the name and by the express order of Her\r\n    Majesty’s Government, that Great Britain has no intention to\r\n    occupy or encroach upon the territory in dispute; therefore the\r\n    Venezuelan Government, in an equal spirit of good faith and\r\n    friendship, cannot refuse to make a similar declaration to Her\r\n    Majesty’s Government, namely, that Venezuela herself has no\r\n    intention to occupy or encroach upon the territory in dispute.\r\n\r\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs for Venezuela responded to this\r\ncommunication in the following terms:\r\n\r\n    The undersigned has been instructed by His Excellency the\r\n    President of the Republic to give the following answer: The\r\n    Government never could be persuaded that Great Britain, in\r\n    contempt of the negotiation opened on the subject and the\r\n    alleged rights in the question of limits pending between the\r\n    two countries, would want to use force in order to occupy\r\n    the land that each side claims--much less after Mr. Wilson’s\r\n    repeated assurance, which the Executive Power believes to have\r\n    been most sincere, that those imputations had no foundation\r\n    whatever, being, on the contrary, quite the reverse of the\r\n    truth. Fully confident of this, and fortified by the protest\r\n    embodied in the note referred to, the Government has no\r\n    difficulty in declaring, as they do declare, that Venezuela\r\n    has no intention of occupying or encroaching upon any portion\r\n    of the territory the possession of which is in controversy;\r\n    neither will she look with indifference on a contrary\r\n    proceeding on the part of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn furtherance of these declarations the English Government stipulated\r\nthat it would not “order or sanction such occupations or encroachments\r\non the part of the British authorities”; and Venezuela agreed on her\r\npart to “instruct the authorities of Venezuelan Guiana to refrain from\r\ntaking any step which might clash with the engagement hereby made by\r\nthe Government.”\r\n\r\nI suspect there was some justification on each side for the accusations\r\nafterward interchanged between the parties that this understanding or\r\nagreement, in its strict letter and spirit, had not been scrupulously\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nAs we now pass from this incident to a date more than twenty-five years\r\nafterward, when attempts to negotiate for a settlement of the boundary\r\ncontroversy were resumed, it may be profitable, before going further,\r\nto glance at some of the conditions existing at the time of such\r\nresumption.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn 1876--thirty-two years after the discontinuance of efforts on the\r\npart of Great Britain and Venezuela to fix by agreement a line which\r\nshould divide their possessions--Venezuela was confronted, upon the\r\nrenewal of negotiations for that purpose, by the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe claim by her, of a divisional line, founded upon her conception of\r\nstrict right, which her powerful opponent had insisted could not in any\r\nway be plausibly supported, and which therefore she would in no event\r\naccept.\r\n\r\nAn indefiniteness in the limits claimed by Great Britain--so great\r\nthat, of two boundary-lines indicated or suggested by her, one had\r\nbeen plainly declared to be “merely a preliminary measure open to\r\nfuture discussion between the Governments of Great Britain and\r\nVenezuela,” while the other was distinctly claimed to be based not on\r\nany acknowledgment of the republic’s rights, but simply upon generous\r\nconcessions and a “desire to avoid all cause of serious controversies\r\nbetween the two countries.”\r\n\r\nA controversy growing out of this situation impossible of friendly\r\nsettlement except by such arrangement and accommodation as would\r\nsatisfy Great Britain, or by a submission of the dispute to arbitration.\r\n\r\nA constant danger of such an extension of British settlements in the\r\ndisputed territory as would necessarily complicate the situation\r\nand furnish a convenient pretext for the refusal of any concession\r\nrespecting the lands containing such settlements.\r\n\r\nA continual profession on the part of Great Britain of her present\r\nreadiness to make benevolent concessions and of her willingness to\r\nco-operate in a speedy adjustment, while at the same time neither\r\nreducing her pretensions, nor attempting in a conspicuous manner to\r\nhasten negotiations to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nA tremendous disparity in power and strength between Venezuela and\r\nher adversary, which gave her no hope of defending her territory or\r\npreventing its annexation to the possessions of Great Britain in case\r\nthe extremity of force or war was reached.\r\n\r\nThe renewed negotiations began with a communication dated November\r\n14, 1876, addressed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs for Venezuela\r\nto Lord Derby, then Great Britain’s principal Secretary of State. In\r\nthis communication the efforts made between the years 1841 and 1844 to\r\nestablish by agreement a divisional line between the two countries,\r\nand their interruption, were referred to, and the earnest desire was\r\nexpressed that negotiations for that purpose might at once be resumed.\r\nThe minister suggested no other line than the Essequibo River, but in\r\nconclusion declared that the President of Venezuela was led to “hope\r\nthat the solution of this question, already for so many years delayed,\r\nwill be a work of very speedy and cordial agreement.”\r\n\r\nOn the same day that this note was written to Lord Derby, one was\r\nalso written by the same Venezuelan official to Mr. Fish, then our\r\nSecretary of State. After speaking of the United States as “the most\r\npowerful and the oldest of the Republics of the new continent, and\r\ncalled on to lend to others its powerful moral support in disputes\r\nwith European nations,” the minister directs attention to the boundary\r\ncontroversy between Venezuela and Great Britain and the great necessity\r\nof bringing it to a speedy termination. He concludes as follows: “But\r\nwhatever may be the result of the new steps of the Government, it has\r\ndesired that the American Government might at once take cognizance\r\nof them, convinced, as it is, that it will give the subject its kind\r\nconsideration and take an interest in having due justice done to\r\nVenezuela.” A memorandum was inclosed with the note, setting forth the\r\nclaims of Venezuela touching the boundary location.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be the first communication addressed to our Government\r\non the subject of a controversy in which we afterward became very\r\nseriously concerned.\r\n\r\nA short time after the date of these communications, a Venezuelan envoy\r\nto Great Britain was appointed; and, on the thirteenth day of February,\r\n1877, he addressed to Lord Derby a note in which, after asserting the\r\nright of Venezuela to insist upon the boundary previously claimed by\r\nher, he declared the willingness of his government “to settle this\r\nlong-pending question in the most amicable manner,” and suggested\r\neither the acceptance of a boundary-line such as would result from\r\na presentation by both parties of Spanish and Dutch titles, maps,\r\ndocuments, and proofs existing before the advent in South America of\r\neither Venezuela or British Guiana, or the adoption of “a conventional\r\nline fixed by mutual accord between the Governments of Venezuela and\r\nGreat Britain after a careful and friendly consideration of the case,\r\nkeeping in view the documents presented by both sides, solely with the\r\nobject of reconciling their mutual interests, and to fix a boundary as\r\nequitable as possible.” The suggestion is made that the adoption of\r\na divisional line is important “to prevent the occurrence of serious\r\ndifferences in the future, particularly as Guiana is attracting the\r\ngeneral attention of the world on account of the immense riches which\r\nare daily being discovered there.”\r\n\r\nLet us here note that this renewal by Venezuela of her efforts to\r\nsettle her boundary-line was accompanied by two new features. These,\r\nthough in themselves entirely independent, became so related to each\r\nother, and in their subsequent combination and development they so\r\nimperiously affected our Government, that their coincident appearance\r\nat this particular stage of the controversy may well strike us as\r\nsignificant. One of these features was the abandonment by Venezuela of\r\nher insistence upon a line representing her extreme claims, and which\r\nEngland would not in any contingency accept, thus clearing the field\r\nfor possible arbitration; and the other was her earnest appeal to us\r\nfor our friendly aid. Neither should we fail to notice the new and\r\nimportant reference of the Venezuelan envoy to the immense riches being\r\ndiscovered in the disputed territory. Gold beneath soil in controversy\r\ndoes not always hasten the adjustment of uncertain or disputed\r\nboundary-lines.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fourth day of March, 1877, Lord Derby informed the\r\nVenezuelan envoy that the governor of British Guiana was shortly\r\nexpected in London, and that he was anxious to await his arrival before\r\ntaking any steps in the boundary discussion.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting for more than two years for a further answer from the\r\nEnglish Government, the Venezuelan representative in London, on the\r\n19th of May, 1879, addressed a note on the subject to Lord Salisbury,\r\nwho, in the meantime, had succeeded Lord Derby. In this note reference\r\nwas made to the communication sent to Lord Derby in 1877, to the desire\r\nexpressed by him to await the arrival of the governor of British\r\nGuiana before making reply, and to the fact that the communication\r\nmentioned still remained unanswered; and on behalf of Venezuela her\r\nrepresentative repeated the alternative proposition made by him in\r\nFebruary, 1877, in these words: “The boundary treaty may be based\r\neither on the acceptance of the line of strict right as shown by the\r\nrecords, documents, and other authoritative proofs which each party may\r\nexhibit, or on the acceptance at once by both Governments of a frontier\r\nof accommodation which shall satisfy the respective interests of the\r\ntwo countries”; and he concluded his note as follows:\r\n\r\n    If Her Britannic Majesty’s Government should prefer the\r\n    frontier of accommodation or convenience, then it would be\r\n    desirable that it should vouchsafe to make a proposition of an\r\n    arrangement, on the understanding that, in order to obviate\r\n    future difficulties and to give Great Britain the fullest\r\n    proof of the consideration and friendship which Venezuela\r\n    professes for her, my Government would not hesitate to accept\r\n    a demarcation that should satisfy as far as possible the\r\n    interests of the Republic.\r\n\r\n    At all events, my Lord, something will have to be done to\r\n    prevent this question from pending any longer.\r\n\r\n    Thirty-eight years ago my Government wrote urging Her Majesty’s\r\n    Government to have the Boundary Treaty concluded, and now\r\n    this affair is in the same position as in 1841, without any\r\n    settlement; meanwhile Guiana has become of more importance than\r\n    it was then, by reason of the large deposits of gold which have\r\n    been and still are met with in that region.\r\n\r\nNow, at the date of this communication England’s most extreme claims\r\nwere indicated either by the Schomburgk line or by the line which\r\nLord Aberdeen suggested in 1844 as a concession. These were indeed the\r\nonly lines which Great Britain had thus far presented. When in such\r\ncircumstances, and with these lines distinctly in mind, the envoy of\r\nVenezuela offered to abandon for his country her most extreme claims,\r\nand asked that Great Britain should “vouchsafe to make a proposition\r\nof an arrangement” upon the basis of a “frontier of accommodation or\r\nconvenience,” what answer had he a right to expect? Most assuredly he\r\nhad a right to expect that if Great Britain should prefer to proceed\r\nupon the theory of “accommodation or convenience,” she would respond by\r\noffering such a reduction of the claims she had already made as would\r\nindicate a degree of concession or “accommodation” on her part that\r\nshould entitle her to expect similar concession from Venezuela.\r\n\r\nWhat was the answer actually made? After a delay of nearly eight\r\nmonths, on the tenth day of January, 1880, Lord Salisbury replied that\r\nher Majesty’s Government were of the opinion that to argue the matter\r\non the ground of strict right would involve so many intricate questions\r\nthat it would be very unlikely to lead to a satisfactory solution of\r\nthe question, and they would therefore prefer the alternative “of\r\nendeavoring to come to an agreement as to the acceptance by the two\r\nGovernments of a frontier of accommodation which shall satisfy the\r\nrespective interests of the two countries.”\r\n\r\nHe then gives a most startling statement of the English Government’s\r\nclaim, by specifying boundaries which overlap the Schomburgk line\r\nand every other line that had been thought of or dreamed of before,\r\ndeclaring that such claim is justified “by virtue of ancient treaties\r\nwith the aboriginal tribes and of subsequent cessions from Holland.” He\r\nsets against this claim, or “on the other hand,” as he says, the fact\r\nthat the President of Venezuela, in a message dated February 20, 1877,\r\n“put forward a claim on the part of Venezuela to the river Essequibo\r\nas the boundary to which the Republic was entitled”--thereby giving\r\nprejudicial importance to a claim of boundary made by the President\r\nof Venezuela three years before, notwithstanding his Lordship was\r\nanswering a communication in which Venezuela’s present diplomatic\r\nrepresentative distinctly proposed “a frontier of accommodation.” His\r\ndeclaration, therefore, that the boundary which was thus put forward by\r\nthe President of Venezuela would involve “the surrender of a province\r\nnow inhabited by forty thousand British subjects,” seems quite\r\nirrelevant, because such a boundary was not then under consideration;\r\nand in passing it may occur to us that the great delay in settling the\r\nboundaries between the two countries had given abundant opportunity for\r\nsuch inhabitation as Lord Salisbury suggests. His Lordship having thus\r\nbuilt up a contention in which he puts on one side a line which for the\r\nsake of pacific accommodation Venezuela no longer proposes to insist\r\nupon, and on the other a line for Great Britain so grotesquely extreme\r\nas to appear fanciful, soberly observes:\r\n\r\n    The difference, therefore, between these two claims is\r\n    so great that it is clear that, in order to arrive at a\r\n    satisfactory arrangement, each party must be prepared to\r\n    make considerable concessions to the other; and although the\r\n    claim of Venezuela to the Essequibo River boundary could not\r\n    under any circumstances be entertained, I beg leave to assure\r\n    you that Her Majesty’s Government are anxious to meet the\r\n    Venezuelan Government in a spirit of conciliation, and would\r\n    be willing, in the event of a renewal of negotiations for a\r\n    general settlement of boundaries, to waive a portion of what\r\n    they consider to be their strict right, if Venezuela is really\r\n    disposed to make corresponding concessions on her part.\r\n\r\nAnd ignoring entirely the humbly respectful request of the Venezuelan\r\nminister that Great Britain would “vouchsafe to make a proposition\r\nof an arrangement,” his Lordship thus concludes his communication:\r\n“Her Majesty’s Government will therefore be glad to receive, and will\r\nundertake to consider in the most friendly spirit, any proposal that\r\nthe Venezuelan Government may think fit to make for the establishment\r\nof a boundary satisfactory to both nations.”\r\n\r\nThis is diplomacy--of a certain sort. It is a deep and mysterious\r\nscience; and we probably cannot do better than to confess our inability\r\nto understand its intricacies and sinuosities; but at this point we can\r\nhardly keep out of mind the methods of the shrewd, sharp trader who\r\ndemands exorbitant terms, and at the same time invites negotiation,\r\nlooking for a result abundantly profitable in the large range for\r\ndicker which he has created.\r\n\r\nAn answer was made to Lord Salisbury’s note on the twelfth day of\r\nApril, 1880, in which the Venezuelan envoy stated in direct terms\r\nthat he had received specific instructions from his government for\r\nthe arrangement of the difficulty, by abandoning the ground of strict\r\nright and “concurring in the adoption for both countries of a frontier\r\nmutually convenient, and reconciling in the best possible manner their\r\nrespective interests--each party having to make concessions to the\r\nother for the purpose of attaining such an important result.”\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in 1844, when this boundary question was\r\nunder discussion, Lord Aberdeen proposed a line beginning in the mouth\r\nof the Moroco River, being a point on the coast south and east of the\r\nmouth of the Orinoco, thus giving to Venezuela the control of that\r\nriver, but running inland in such a manner as to include, in the whole,\r\nlittle if any less area than that included in the Schomburgk line;\r\nand it will also be recalled that this line was not then acceptable\r\nto Venezuela. It appears, however, that the delays and incidents of\r\nthirty-six years had impressed upon the government of the republic\r\nthe serious disadvantages of her situation in contention with Great\r\nBritain; for we find in this reply of the Venezuelan envoy the inquiry\r\n“whether Her Britannic Majesty’s Government is disposed now, as it\r\nwas in 1844, to accept the mouth of the river Moroco as the frontier\r\nat the coast.” To this Lord Salisbury promptly responded that the\r\nattorney-general for the colony of British Guiana was shortly expected\r\nin England, and that her Majesty’s Government would prefer to postpone\r\nthe boundary discussion until his arrival.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by a silence of five months, with no word or sign\r\nfrom England’s Foreign Office; and in the meantime Earl Granville had\r\nsucceeded Lord Salisbury as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.\r\nAfter waiting thus long, the representative of Venezuela, on the 23d\r\nof September, 1880, reminded Lord Granville that in the preceding\r\nApril his immediate predecessor had informed him that the arrival of\r\nthe attorney-general of British Guiana was awaited before deciding the\r\nquestion of boundaries between the two Guianas; and as he had not,\r\nafter the lapse of five months, been honored with a communication on\r\nthe subject, he was bound to suppose that the attorney-general had not\r\naccomplished his voyage, in which case it was useless longer to wait\r\nfor him. He further reminded his Lordship that on the 24th of March,\r\n1877, Lord Derby, then in charge of British foreign affairs, also\r\ndesired to postpone the consideration of the question until the arrival\r\nin London of the governor of British Guiana, who was then expected, but\r\nwho apparently never came. He then proceeds as follows:\r\n\r\n    Consequently it is best not to go on waiting either for the\r\n    Governor or for the Attorney-General of the Colony, but\r\n    to decide these questions ourselves, considering that my\r\n    Government is now engaged in preparing the official map of the\r\n    Republic and wishes of course to mark out the boundaries on the\r\n    East.\r\n\r\n    In my despatch of the 12th of April last, I informed your\r\n    Excellency [Excellency’s predecessor?] that as a basis of a\r\n    friendly demarcation my Government was disposed to accept the\r\n    mouth of the River Moroco as the frontier on the coast. If\r\n    Her Britannic Majesty’s Government should accept this point\r\n    of departure, it would be very easy to determine the general\r\n    course of the frontier, either by means of notes or in verbal\r\n    conferences, as your Excellency might prefer.\r\n\r\nOn the twelfth day of February, 1881, Lord Granville, replying to\r\nVenezuela’s two notes dated April 12 and September 23, 1880, informed\r\nher representative, without explanation, that her Majesty’s Government\r\nwould not accept the mouth of the Moroco as the divisional boundary on\r\nthe coast.\r\n\r\nA few days afterward, in an answer to this refusal, Venezuela’s\r\nrepresentative mentioned the extreme claims of the two countries and\r\nthe fact that it had been agreed between the parties that steps should\r\nbe taken to settle upon a frontier of accommodation; that in pursuance\r\nthereof he had proposed as the point of departure for such a frontier\r\nthe mouth of the Moroco River, which was in agreement thus far with\r\nthe proposition made by Lord Aberdeen on behalf of Great Britain in\r\n1844; and pertinently added: “Thus thirty-seven years ago Her Britannic\r\nMajesty’s Government spontaneously proposed the mouth of the Moroco\r\nRiver as the limit on the coast, a limit which your Excellency does\r\nnot accept now, for you are pleased to tell me so in the note which I\r\nhave the honor of answering.” He thereupon suggests another boundary,\r\nbeginning on the coast at a point one mile north of the mouth of\r\nthe Moroco River and thence extending inland in such manner as to\r\nconstitute a large concession on the part of Venezuela, but falling\r\nvery far short of meeting the claims of Great Britain. He declares,\r\nhowever, that this demarcation “is the maximum of all concessions which\r\nin this matter the Government of Venezuela can grant by way of friendly\r\narrangement.”\r\n\r\nApparently anticipating, as he well might, that the boundary he\r\nproposed would fail of acceptance, he suggests that in such case\r\nthe two governments would have no alternative but to determine the\r\nfrontier by strict right, and that on this basis they would find it\r\nimpossible to arrive at an agreement. Therefore he declares that he has\r\nreceived instructions from his government to urge upon Great Britain\r\nthe submission of the question to an arbitrator, to be chosen by both\r\nparties, to whose award both governments should submit.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal of arbitration by Venezuela we find an approach to a\r\nnew phase of the controversy. At first, the two countries had stood\r\nat arm’s-length, each asserting strict right of boundary, only to\r\nbe met by obstinate and unyielding resistance. Next, the field of\r\nmutual concession and accommodation had been traversed, with no result\r\nexcept damaging and dangerous delay. And now, after forty years of\r\ndelusive hope, the time seemed at hand when the feebler contestant must\r\ncontemplate ignominious submission to dictatorial exaction, or forcible\r\nresistance, futile and distressing, unless honorable rest and justice\r\ncould be found in arbitration--the refuge which civilization has\r\nbuilded among the nations of the earth for the protection of the weak\r\nagainst the strong, and the citadel from which the ministries of peace\r\nissue their decrees against the havoc and barbarism of war.\r\n\r\nThe reply of Lord Granville to the communication of the envoy of\r\nVenezuela proposing an alternative of arbitration was delayed for seven\r\nmonths; and when, in September, 1881, it was received, it contained a\r\nrejection of the boundary offered by Venezuela and a proposal of a\r\nnew line apparently lacking almost every feature of concession; and,\r\nsingularly enough, there was not in this reply the slightest allusion\r\nto Venezuela’s request for arbitration.\r\n\r\nI do not find that this communication of Great Britain was ever\r\nspecifically answered, though an answer was often requested. No further\r\nsteps appear to have been taken until September 7, 1883, when Lord\r\nGranville instructed the British minister to Venezuela to invite the\r\nserious attention of the Venezuelan Government to the questions pending\r\nbetween the two countries, with a view to their early settlement.\r\nThese questions are specified as relating to the boundary, to certain\r\ndifferential duties imposed on imports from British colonies, and\r\nto the claims of British creditors of the republic. His Lordship\r\ndeclared in those instructions that as a preliminary to entering upon\r\nnegotiations it was indispensable that an answer should be given to the\r\npending proposal which had been made by her Majesty’s Government in\r\nregard to the boundary.\r\n\r\nThe representations made to the Government of Venezuela by the British\r\nminister, in obedience to those instructions, elicited a reply, in\r\nwhich a provision of the Venezuelan constitution was cited prohibiting\r\nthe alienation or cession of any part of the territory of the republic;\r\nand it was suggested that, inasmuch as the Essequibo line seemed\r\nabundantly supported as the true boundary of Venezuela, a concession\r\nbeyond that line by treaty would be obnoxious to this constitutional\r\nprohibition, whereas any reduction of territory brought about by a\r\ndecree of an arbitral tribunal would obviate the difficulty. Therefore\r\nthe urgent necessity was submitted for the selection of an arbitrator,\r\n“who, freely and unanimously chosen by the two Governments, would judge\r\nand pronounce a sentence of a definitive character.”\r\n\r\nThe representative of her Majesty’s Government, in a response dated\r\nFebruary 29, 1884, commented upon the new difficulty introduced by the\r\nstatement concerning the prohibition contained in the constitution of\r\nthe republic, and expressed a fear that if arbitration was agreed to,\r\nthe same prohibition might be invoked as an excuse for not abiding by\r\nan award unfavorable to Venezuela; and it was declared that if, on the\r\nother hand, the arbitrator should decide in favor of the Venezuelan\r\nGovernment to the full extent of their claim, “a large and important\r\nterritory which has for a long period been inhabited and occupied by\r\nHer Majesty’s subjects and treated as a part of the Colony of British\r\nGuiana would be severed from the Queen’s dominions.” This declaration\r\nis immediately followed by a conclusion in these words:\r\n\r\n    For the above-mentioned reasons, therefore, the circumstances\r\n    of the case do not appear to Her Majesty’s Government to be\r\n    such as to render arbitration applicable for a solution of the\r\n    difficulty; and I have accordingly to request you, in making\r\n    this known to the Venezuelan Government, to express to them\r\n    the hope of Her Majesty’s Government that some other means may\r\n    be devised for bringing this long-standing matter to an issue\r\n    satisfactory to both powers.\r\n\r\nLet us pause here for a moment’s examination of the surprising refusal\r\nof Great Britain to submit this difficulty to arbitration, and the\r\nmore surprising reasons presented for its justification. The refusal\r\nwas surprising because the controversy had reached such a stage that\r\narbitration was evidently the only means by which it could be settled\r\nconsistently with harmonious relations between the two countries.\r\n\r\nIt was on this ground that Venezuela proposed arbitration; and\r\nshe strongly urged it on the further ground that inasmuch as the\r\nprohibition of her constitution prevented the relinquishment, by\r\ntreaty or voluntary act, of any part of the territory which her people\r\nand their government claimed to be indubitably Venezuelan, such a\r\nrelinquishment would present no difficulties if it was in obedience\r\nto a decree of a tribunal to which the question of ownership had been\r\nmutually submitted.\r\n\r\nIn giving her reasons for rejecting arbitration Great Britain says in\r\neffect: The plan you urge for the utter and complete elimination of\r\nthis constitutional prohibition--for its expurgation and destruction so\r\nfar as it is related to the pending dispute--is objectionable, because\r\nwe fear the prohibition thus eliminated, expunged, and destroyed will\r\nstill be used as a pretext for disobedience to an award which, for the\r\nexpress purpose of avoiding this constitutional restraint, you have\r\ninvited.\r\n\r\nThe remaining objection interposed by Great Britain to the arbitration\r\nrequested by Venezuela is based upon the fear that an award might be\r\nmade in favor of the Venezuelan claim, in which case “a large and\r\nimportant territory which has for a long period been inhabited and\r\noccupied by Her Majesty’s subjects and treated as a part of the Colony\r\nof British Guiana would be severed from the Queen’s dominions.”\r\n\r\nIt first occurs to us that a contention may well be suspected of\r\nweakness when its supporters are unwilling to subject it to the test\r\nof impartial arbitration. Certain inquiries are also pertinent in this\r\nconnection. Who were the British subjects who had long occupied the\r\nterritory that might through arbitration be severed from the Queen’s\r\ndominions? How many of them began this occupancy during the more than\r\nforty years that the territory had been steadily and notoriously\r\ndisputed? Did they enter upon this territory with knowledge of the\r\ndispute and against the warning of the government to which they owed\r\nallegiance, or were they encouraged and invited to such entry by\r\nagencies of that government who had full notice of the uncertainty of\r\nthe British title? In one case, being themselves in the wrong, they\r\nwere entitled to no consideration; in the other, the question of loss\r\nand indemnification should rest between them and their government,\r\nwhich had impliedly guaranteed them against disturbance. In any event,\r\nneither case presented a reason why Great Britain should take or\r\npossess the lands of Venezuela; nor did either case furnish an excuse\r\nfor denying to Venezuela a fair and impartial adjudication of her\r\ndisputed rights. By whom had this territory “been treated as a part\r\nof the Colony of British Guiana”? Surely not by Venezuela. On the\r\ncontrary, she had persistently claimed it as her own, and had “treated”\r\nit as her own as far as she could and dared. England alone had treated\r\nit as a part of British Guiana; her immense power had enabled her to do\r\nthis; and her decrees in her own favor as against her weak adversary\r\nundoubtedly promised greater advantages than arbitration could possibly\r\nassure.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State of Venezuela, soon after this refusal of Great\r\nBritain to submit the boundary dispute to arbitration, in a despatch\r\ndated the second day of April, 1884, still urged that method of\r\nsettlement, citing precedents and presenting arguments in its favor;\r\nand in conclusion he asked the minister of the English Government at\r\nCaracas “to have the goodness to think out and suggest any acceptable\r\ncourse for attaining a solution of the difficulty.” This was followed,\r\na few days afterward, by another communication from the Venezuelan\r\nSecretary of State, repeating his urgent request for arbitration. From\r\nthis communication it may not be amiss to make the following quotation:\r\n\r\n    Venezuela and Great Britain possess the same rights in the\r\n    question under discussion. If the Republic should yield up\r\n    any part of her pretensions, she would recognize the superior\r\n    right of Great Britain, would violate the above-quoted\r\n    article of the Constitution, and draw down the censure of\r\n    her fellow-citizens. But when both nations, putting aside\r\n    their independence of action in deference to peace and good\r\n    friendship, create by mutual consent a Tribunal which may\r\n    decide in the controversy, the same is able to pass sentence\r\n    that one of the two parties or both of them have been mistaken\r\n    in their opinions concerning the extent of their territory.\r\n    Thus the case would not be in opposition to the Constitution\r\n    of the Republic, there being no alienation of that which shall\r\n    have been determined not to be her property.\r\n\r\nOn the tenth day of June, 1884, arbitration was again refused in a curt\r\nnote from Lord Granville, declaring that “Her Majesty’s Government\r\nadhere to their objection to arbitration as a mode of dealing with this\r\nquestion.”\r\n\r\nAbout this time complaints and protests of the most vigorous character,\r\nbased upon alleged breaches of the agreement of 1850 concerning the\r\nnon-occupation of the disputed territory broke out on both sides of\r\nthe controversy, and accusations of aggression and occupation were\r\nconstantly made. I shall not attempt to follow them, as in detail they\r\nare not among the incidents which I consider especially relevant to the\r\npresentation of my theme.\r\n\r\nOn the thirteenth day of December, 1884, Venezuela, in reply to a\r\nproposition of the British Government that the boundary question and\r\ncertain other differences should be settled simultaneously, suggested,\r\nin view of the unwillingness of Great Britain to submit the boundary\r\ndispute to arbitration, that it should be presented for decision to\r\na court of law, the members of which should be chosen by the parties\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nThe British Government promptly declined this proposition, and stated\r\nthat they were not prepared to depart from the arrangement made in 1877\r\nto decide the question by adopting a conventional boundary fixed by\r\nmutual accord between the two governments. This was in the face of the\r\nefforts which had been made along that line and found utterly fruitless.\r\n\r\nImmediately following the last-mentioned proposition by Venezuela\r\nfor the presentation of the difficulty to a court of law mutually\r\nchosen, negotiations were entered upon for the conclusion of a treaty\r\nbetween Great Britain and Venezuela, which should quiet a difference\r\npending between the two countries relating to differential duties and\r\nwhich should also dispose of other unsettled questions. In a draft of\r\nsuch a treaty submitted by Venezuela there was inserted an article\r\nproviding for arbitration in case of all differences which could not\r\nbe adjusted by friendly negotiation. To this article Great Britain\r\nsuggested an amendment, making such arbitration applicable only to\r\nmatters arising out of the interpretation or execution of the treaty\r\nitself, and especially excluding those emanating from any other source;\r\nbut on further representation by Venezuela, Lord Granville, in behalf\r\nof the Government of Great Britain, expressly agreed with Venezuela\r\nthat the treaty article relating to arbitration should be unrestricted\r\nin its operation. This diplomatic agreement was in explicit terms,\r\nher Majesty’s Government agreeing “that the undertaking to refer\r\ndifferences to arbitration shall include all differences which may\r\narise between the High Contracting Parties, and not those only which\r\narise on the interpretation of the Treaty.”\r\n\r\nThis occurred on the fifteenth day of May, 1885. Whatever Lord\r\nGranville may have intended by the language used, the Government of\r\nVenezuela certainly understood his agreement to include the pending\r\nboundary dispute as among the questions that should be submitted to\r\narbitration; and all other matters which the treaty should embrace\r\nseemed so easy of adjustment that its early completion, embodying a\r\nstipulation for the final arbitration of the boundary controversy, was\r\nconfidently and gladly anticipated by the republic.\r\n\r\nThe high hopes and joyful anticipations of Venezuela born of this\r\napparently favorable situation were, however, but short-lived.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-seventh day of July, 1885, Lord Salisbury, who in the\r\nmeantime had succeeded the Earl of Granville in Great Britain’s\r\nForeign Office, in a note to Venezuela’s envoy, declared: “Her\r\nMajesty’s Government are unable to concur in the assent given by their\r\npredecessors in office to the general arbitration article proposed\r\nby Venezuela, and they are unable to agree to the inclusion in it of\r\nmatters other than those arising out of the interpretation or alleged\r\nviolation of this particular treaty.”\r\n\r\nNo assertion of the irrevocability of the agreement which Venezuela\r\nhad made with his predecessor, and no plea or argument of any kind,\r\navailed to save the enlarged terms of this arbitration clause from Lord\r\nSalisbury’s destructive insistence.\r\n\r\nOn the twentieth day of June, 1886, Lord Rosebery suggested for Great\r\nBritain, and as a solution of the difficulty, that the territory within\r\ntwo certain lines which had been already proposed as boundaries should\r\nbe equally divided between the contestants, either by arbitration or\r\nthe determination of a mixed commission.\r\n\r\nThis was declined by Venezuela on the twenty-ninth day of July, 1886,\r\nupon the same grounds that led to the declination of prior proposals\r\nthat apparently involved an absolute cession of a part of her\r\nterritory; and she still insisted upon an arbitration embracing the\r\nentire disputed territory as the only feasible method of adjustment.\r\n\r\nThis declination on the part of Venezuela of Lord Rosebery’s\r\nproposition terminated the second attempt in point of time, to settle\r\nthis vexed question. In the meantime the aggressive conduct which for\r\nsome time the officials of both countries had exhibited in and near\r\nthe contested region had grown in distinctness and significance, until\r\nGreat Britain had openly and with notorious assertion of ownership\r\ntaken possession of a valuable part of the territory in dispute. On\r\nthe 26th of October, 1886, an official document was published in the\r\nLondon “Gazette” giving notice that no grants of land made by the\r\nGovernment of Venezuela in the territory claimed by Great Britain would\r\nbe admitted or recognized by her Majesty; and this more significant\r\nstatement was added: “A map showing the boundary between British\r\nGuiana and Venezuela claimed by Her Majesty’s Government can be seen in\r\nthe library of the Colonial Office, Downing Street, or at the Office\r\nof the Government Secretary, Georgetown, British Guiana.” The boundary\r\nhere spoken of, as shown on the map to which attention is directed,\r\nfollows the Schomburgk line. Protests and demands in abundance on the\r\npart of Venezuela followed, which were utterly disregarded, until,\r\non the thirty-first day of January, 1887, the Venezuelan Secretary\r\nof State distinctly demanded of Great Britain the evacuation of the\r\ndisputed territory which she was occupying in violation of prior\r\nagreement and the rights of the republic, and gave formal notice\r\nthat unless such evacuation should be completed, and accompanied by\r\nacceptance of arbitration as a means of deciding the pending frontier\r\ndispute, by the twentieth day of February, 1887, diplomatic relations\r\nbetween the two countries would on that day cease.\r\n\r\nThese demands were absolutely unheeded; and thereupon, when the\r\ntwentieth day of February arrived, Venezuela exhibited a long list of\r\nspecific charges of aggression and wrongdoing against Great Britain,\r\nand made the following statement and final protest:\r\n\r\n    In consequence, Venezuela, not deeming it fitting to continue\r\n    friendly relations with a state which thus injures her,\r\n    suspends them from to-day.\r\n\r\n    And she protests before the Government of Her Britannic\r\n    Majesty, before all civilized nations, before the whole world,\r\n    against the acts of spoliation which the Government of Great\r\n    Britain has committed to her detriment, and which she will\r\n    never on any consideration recognize as capable of altering in\r\n    the slightest degree the rights which she has acquired from\r\n    Spain, and respecting which she will be always ready to submit\r\n    to a third power, as the only way to a solution compatible with\r\n    her constitutional principles.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, three years afterward, and on the tenth day\r\nof January, 1890, an agent of Venezuela, appointed for that purpose,\r\naddressed a note to Lord Salisbury, still in charge of Great Britain’s\r\nforeign relations, expressing the desire of Venezuela to renew\r\ndiplomatic relations with Great Britain, and requesting an interview to\r\nthat end.\r\n\r\nA short time thereafter the Government of Great Britain expressed its\r\nsatisfaction that a renewal of diplomatic relations was in prospect,\r\nand presented to the representative of Venezuela “a statement of the\r\nconditions which Her Majesty’s Government considered necessary for\r\na satisfactory settlement of the questions pending between the two\r\ncountries.”\r\n\r\nAs the first of these conditions it was declared that “Her Majesty’s\r\nGovernment could not accept as satisfactory any arrangement which did\r\nnot admit the British title to the territory comprised within the line\r\nlaid down by Sir R. Schomburgk in 1841; but they would be willing to\r\nrefer to arbitration the claims of Great Britain to certain territory\r\nto the west of that line.”\r\n\r\nNaturally enough, this statement was received by Venezuela with great\r\ndisappointment and surprise. Her representative promptly replied that\r\nhis government could not accept any single point of the arbitrary and\r\ncapricious line laid down by Sir R. Schomburgk in 1841, which had been\r\ndeclared null and void even by the Government of her Majesty; and that\r\nit was not possible for Venezuela to accept arbitration in respect to\r\nterritory west of that line. He further expressed his regret that the\r\nconditions then demanded by Lord Salisbury were more unfavorable to\r\nVenezuela than the proposals made to the former agent of the republic\r\nprior to the suspension of diplomatic relations.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of March, 1890, the British Government reiterated its\r\nposition more in detail. Its refusal to admit any question as to\r\nGreat Britain’s title to any of the territory within the Schomburgk\r\nline was emphatically repeated, and the British claim was defined to\r\nextend beyond any pretension which I believe had ever been previously\r\nmade except by Lord Salisbury himself in 1880. A map was presented\r\nindicating this extreme claim, the Schomburgk line, and a certain part\r\nof the territory between the boundary of this extreme claim on the\r\nwest and the Schomburgk line, which Great Britain proposed to submit\r\nto arbitration, abandoning all claim to the remainder of the territory\r\nbetween these last-named two lines. This scheme, if adopted, would give\r\nto England absolutely and without question the large territory between\r\nBritish Guiana’s conceded western boundary and the Schomburgk line,\r\nwith an opportunity to lay claim before a board of arbitration for\r\nextensive additional territory beyond the Schomburgk line.\r\n\r\nThis is pitiful. The Schomburgk line, which was declared by the British\r\nGovernment, at the time it was made, to be “merely a preliminary\r\nmeasure, open to further discussion between the Governments of Great\r\nBritain and Venezuela,” and which had been since largely extended in\r\nsome mysterious way, is now declared to be a line so well established,\r\nso infallible, and so sacred that only the territory that England\r\nexorbitantly claims beyond that line is enough in dispute to be\r\nsubmitted to impartial arbitration. The trader is again in evidence.\r\nOn this basis England could abundantly afford to lose entirely in the\r\narbitration she at length conceded.\r\n\r\nAnd yet Venezuela was not absolutely discouraged. Soon after the\r\nreceipt of Great Britain’s last depressing communication, she\r\nappointed still another agent who was to try his hand with England\r\nin the field of diplomacy. On the twenty-fourth day of June, 1890,\r\nthis new representative replied to the above proposal made to his\r\npredecessor by her Majesty’s Government, and expressed the great\r\nregret of Venezuela that its recent proposals for a settlement of the\r\nboundary difficulty by arbitration affecting all the disputed territory\r\nhad been peremptorily declined. He also declared that the emphatic\r\nstatement contained in Great Britain’s last communication in reference\r\nto this question created for his government “difficulties not formerly\r\ncontemplated,” and thereupon formally declined on behalf of Venezuela\r\nthe consideration of the proposals contained in said communication.\r\nThis statement of discouraging conditions was, however, supplemented by\r\na somewhat new suggestion to the effect that a preliminary agreement\r\nshould be made containing a declaration on the part of the Government\r\nof Venezuela that the river Essequibo, its banks, and the lands\r\ncovering it belong exclusively to British Guiana, and a declaration\r\non the part of her Majesty’s Government that the Orinoco River, its\r\nbanks, and the lands covering it belong exclusively to Venezuela, and\r\nproviding that a mixed commission of two chief engineers and their\r\nstaffs should be appointed to make, within one year, careful maps and\r\ncharts of the region to the west and northwest of the Essequibo River,\r\ntoward the Orinoco, in order to determine officially the exact course\r\nof its rivers and streams, and the precise position of its mountains\r\nand hills, and all other details that would permit both countries to\r\nhave reliable official knowledge of the territory which was actually\r\nin dispute, enabling them to determine with a mutual feeling of\r\nfriendship and good will a boundary with perfect knowledge of the case;\r\nbut in the event that a determination should not be thus reached,\r\nthe final decision of the boundary question should be submitted\r\nto two arbitrators, one selected by each government, and a third\r\nchosen by the other two, to act as umpire in case of disagreement,\r\nwho, in view of the original titles and documents presented, should\r\nfix a boundary-line which, being in accordance with the respective\r\nrights and titles, should have the advantage as far as possible of\r\nconstituting a natural boundary; and that, pending such determination,\r\nboth governments should remove or withdraw all posts and other\r\nindications and signs of possession or dominion on said territory, and\r\nrefrain from exercising any jurisdiction within the disputed region.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of July, 1890, Lord Salisbury declined to accept these\r\nsuggestions of the Venezuelan representative, and declared: “Her\r\nMajesty’s Government have more than once explained that they cannot\r\nconsent to submit to arbitration what they regard as their indisputable\r\ntitle to districts in the possession of the British Colony.”\r\n\r\nIs it uncharitable to see in this reference to “possession” a hint\r\nof the industrious manner in which Great Britain had attempted to\r\nimprove her position by permitting colonization, and by other acts of\r\npossession, during the half-century since the boundary dispute began?\r\n\r\nEfforts to settle this controversy seem to have languished after this\r\nrebuff until March, 1893, when still another agent was appointed by\r\nVenezuela for the purpose of reëstablishing diplomatic relations with\r\nGreat Britain, and settling, if possible, the boundary trouble and\r\nsuch other differences as might be pending between the two countries.\r\nAs a means to that end, this agent, on the twenty-sixth day of May,\r\n1893, presented a memorandum to the British Government containing\r\nsuggestions for such settlement. The suggestion relating to the\r\nadjustment of the boundary question rested upon the idea of arbitration\r\nand did not materially differ from that made by this agent’s immediate\r\npredecessor in 1890, except as to the _status quo_, pending final\r\nadjustment, which it was proposed should be the same as that existing\r\nafter the agreement of non-interference in the disputed territory made\r\nby the two governments in 1850.\r\n\r\nThe plan thus suggested was declined by the Government of Great\r\nBritain, because, in the first place, it involved an arbitration,\r\n“which had been repeatedly declined by Her Majesty’s Government,” and,\r\nfurther, because it was, in the language of the British reply, “quite\r\nimpossible that they should consent to revert to the _status quo_ of\r\n1850 and evacuate what has for some years constituted an integral\r\nportion of British Guiana.”\r\n\r\nA further communication from the agent of Venezuela, offering\r\nadditional arguments in support of his suggestions, brought forth\r\na reply informing him that the contents of his note did not “appear\r\nto Her Majesty’s Government to afford any opening for arriving at an\r\nunderstanding on this question which they could accept.”\r\n\r\nSix months afterward, on the twenty-ninth day of September, 1893, a\r\nfinal communication was addressed by the representative of Venezuela to\r\nthe British Government, reviewing the situation and the course of past\r\nefforts to arrive at a settlement, and concluding with the words:\r\n\r\n    I must now declare in the most solemn manner, and in the name\r\n    of the Government of Venezuela, that it is with the greatest\r\n    regret that that Government sees itself forced to leave the\r\n    situation produced in the disputed territory by the acts of\r\n    recent years unsettled, and subject to the serious disturbances\r\n    which acts of force cannot but produce; and to declare that\r\n    Venezuela will never consent to proceedings of that nature\r\n    being accepted as title-deeds to justify the arbitrary\r\n    occupation of territory which is within its jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nHere closed a period in this dispute, fifty-two years in duration,\r\nvexed with agitation, and perturbed by irritating and repeated failures\r\nto reach a peaceful adjustment. Instead of progress in the direction\r\nof a settlement of their boundaries, the results of their action were\r\nincreased obstacles to fair discussion, intensified feelings of injury,\r\nextended assertion of title, ruthless appropriation of the territory in\r\ncontroversy, and an unhealed breach in diplomatic relations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nI have thus far dealt with this dispute as one in which Great Britain\r\nand Venezuela, the parties primarily concerned, were sole participants.\r\nWe have now, however, reached a stage in the affair which requires\r\na recital of other facts which led up to the active and positive\r\ninterference of our own Government in the controversy. In discussing\r\nthis branch of our topic it will be necessary not only to deal with\r\ncircumstances following those already narrated, but to retrace our\r\nsteps sufficiently to exhibit among other things the appeals and\r\nrepresentations made to the Government of the United States by\r\nVenezuela, while she was still attempting to arrive at an adjustment\r\nwith Great Britain.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the first communication made to us by\r\nVenezuela on the subject. This, it will be remembered, was in 1876,\r\nwhen she sought to resume negotiations with Great Britain, after an\r\ninterruption of thirty-two years. I have also called attention to the\r\nfact that coincident with this communication Venezuela presented to\r\nGreat Britain a willingness to relax her insistence upon her extreme\r\nboundary claim, based upon alleged right, and suggested that a\r\nconventional line might be fixed by mutual concession.\r\n\r\nVenezuela’s first appeal to us for support and aid amounted to little\r\nmore than a vague and indefinite request for countenance and sympathy\r\nin her efforts to settle her differences with her contestant, with\r\nan expression of a desire that we would take cognizance of her new\r\nsteps in that direction. I do not find that any reply was made to this\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nFive years afterward, in 1881, the Venezuelan minister in Washington\r\npresented to Mr. Evarts, then our Secretary of State, information he\r\nhad received that British vessels had made their appearance in the\r\nmouth of the Orinoco River with materials to build a telegraph-line,\r\nand had begun to erect poles for that purpose at Barima: and he\r\nreferred to the immense importance to his country of the Orinoco;\r\nto the efforts of his government to adjust her difficulty with\r\nGreat Britain, and to the delays interposed; and finally expressed\r\nhis confident belief that the United States would not view with\r\nindifference what was being done in a matter of such capital importance.\r\n\r\nMr. Evarts promptly replied, and informed the Venezuelan representative\r\nthat “in view of the deep interest which the Government of the United\r\nStates takes in all transactions tending to attempted encroachments\r\nof foreign powers upon the territory of any of the republics of this\r\ncontinent, this Government could not look with indifference to the\r\nforcible acquisition of such territory by England, if the mission of\r\nthe vessels now at the mouth of the Orinoco should be found to be for\r\nthat end.”\r\n\r\nAgain, on the thirtieth day of November, 1881, our minister to\r\nVenezuela reported to Mr. Blaine, who had succeeded Mr. Evarts as\r\nSecretary of State, an interview with the President of Venezuela\r\nat his request, in which the subject of the boundary dispute was\r\ndiscussed. Our minister represented that the question was spoken of\r\nby the President as being of essential importance and a source of\r\ngreat anxiety to him, involving a large and fertile territory between\r\nthe Essequibo and Orinoco, and probably the control of the mouth\r\nand a considerable portion of the latter river; and he alleged that\r\nthe policy of Great Britain, in the treatment of this question, had\r\nbeen delay--the interval being utilized by gradually but steadily\r\nextending her interest and authority into the disputed territory; and\r\n“that, though the rights of Venezuela were clear and indisputable, he\r\nquestioned her ability, unaided by some friendly nation, to maintain\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nIn July, 1882, Mr. Frelinghuysen, successor to Mr. Blaine, sent to\r\nour representative at Venezuela a despatch to be communicated to the\r\ngovernment of the republic, in which he stated that, if Venezuela\r\ndesired it, the United States would propose to the Government of Great\r\nBritain that the boundary question be submitted to the arbitrament of a\r\nthird power.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that a proposition for arbitration had been made\r\nby Venezuela to Great Britain in February, 1881, and that Great Britain\r\nhad refused to accede to it.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1884, Mr. Frelinghuysen sent a confidential despatch to Mr.\r\nLowell, our minister to Great Britain, informing him that Guzman\r\nBlanco, ex-President of Venezuela, who had recently been accredited as\r\na special envoy from his country to Great Britain, had called on him\r\nrelative to the objects of his mission, in respect of which he desired\r\nto obtain the good offices of this Government, and that doubtless he\r\nwould seek to confer with Mr. Lowell in London. He further informed\r\nMr. Lowell that he had told the Venezuelan envoy that, “in view of our\r\ninterest in all that touches the independent life of the Republics of\r\nthe American Continent, the United States could not be indifferent to\r\nanything that might impair their normal self-control”; that “the moral\r\nposition of the United States in these matters was well known through\r\nthe enunciation of the Monroe Doctrine,” though formal action in the\r\ndirection of applying that doctrine to a speculative case affecting\r\nVenezuela seemed to him to be inopportune, and therefore he could not\r\nadvise Venezuela to arouse a discussion of that point. He instructed\r\nour minister to show proper consideration to the Venezuelan envoy, and\r\nto “take proper occasion to let Lord Granville know that we are not\r\nwithout concern as to whatever may affect the interest of a sister\r\nRepublic of the American Continent and its position in the family of\r\nnations.”\r\n\r\nIn July, 1885, the Venezuelan minister to the United States addressed\r\na communication to Secretary of State Bayard, setting forth the\r\ncorrespondence which had already taken place between our Government and\r\nthat of Venezuela touching the boundary dispute, and referring to the\r\nserious condition existing on account of the renewed aggressions of\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nMr. Bayard thereupon sent a despatch on the subject to Mr. Phelps,\r\nour diplomatic representative to England, in which, after stating\r\nthat the Venezuelan Government had never definitely declared what\r\ncourse she desired us to pursue, but, on the contrary, had expressed\r\na desire to be guided by our counsel, he said: “The good offices of\r\nthis Government have been tendered to Venezuela to suggest to Great\r\nBritain the submission of the boundary dispute to arbitration; but when\r\nshown that such action on our part would exclude us from acting as\r\narbitrator, Venezuela ceased to press the matter in that direction”;\r\nand the next day after writing this despatch Mr. Bayard informed the\r\nVenezuelan minister that the President of the United States could not\r\nentertain a request to act as umpire in any dispute unless it should\r\ncome concurrently from both contestants.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1886, our minister to Venezuela addressed a despatch\r\nto Mr. Bayard, in which he reported that matters looked very angry\r\nand threatening in Venezuela on account of fresh aggressions on the\r\npart of Great Britain in the disputed territory; and he expressed the\r\nfear that an open rupture might occur between the two countries.\r\nHe inclosed a statement made by the Venezuelan Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs, containing a list of grievances, followed by this declaration:\r\n“Venezuela, listening to the advice of the United States, has\r\nendeavored several times to obtain that the difference should be\r\nsubmitted to the award of a third power.... But such efforts have\r\nproven fruitless, and the possibility of that result, the only one\r\nprescribed by our constitution, being arrived at, becomes more and\r\nmore remote from day to day. Great Britain has been constant in her\r\nclandestine advances upon the Venezuelan territory, not taking into\r\nconsideration either the rights or the complaints of this Republic.”\r\nAnd he adds the following declaration: “Under such circumstances the\r\nGovernment has but two courses left open: either to employ force in\r\norder to recover places from which force has ejected the Republic,\r\nsince its amicable representations on the subject have failed to secure\r\nredress, or to present a solemn protest to the Government of the United\r\nStates against so great an abuse, which is an evident declaration of\r\nwar--a provocative aggression.”\r\n\r\nThereupon, and on the twentieth day of December, 1886, a despatch was\r\nsent by Mr. Bayard to Mr. Phelps, in which the secretary comments\r\non the fact that at no time theretofore had the good offices of our\r\nGovernment been actually tendered to avert a rupture between Great\r\nBritain and Venezuela, and that our inaction in this regard seemed\r\nto be due to the reluctance of Venezuela to have the Government of\r\nthe United States take any steps having relation to the action of the\r\nBritish Government which might, in appearance even, prejudice the\r\nresort to our arbitration or mediation which Venezuela desired; but\r\nthat the intelligence now received warranted him in tendering the good\r\noffices of the United States to promote an amicable settlement of the\r\ndifficulty between the two countries, and offering our arbitration if\r\nacceptable to both countries--as he supposed the dispute turned upon\r\nsimple and readily ascertainable historical facts.\r\n\r\nAdditional complaints against Great Britain on account of further\r\ntrespasses on Venezuelan territory were contained in a note from the\r\nVenezuelan minister to Mr. Bayard, dated January 4, 1887. I shall quote\r\nonly the following passage:\r\n\r\n    My Government has tried all possible means to induce that\r\n    of London to accept arbitration, as advised by the United\r\n    States; this, however, has resulted in nothing but fresh\r\n    attempts against the integrity of the territory by the colonial\r\n    authorities of Demerara. It remains to be seen how long my\r\n    Government will find it possible to exercise forbearance\r\n    transcending the limits of its positive official duty.\r\n\r\nPursuant to his instructions from Mr. Bayard, our minister to Great\r\nBritain formally tendered to the English Government, on the eighth day\r\nof February, 1887, the good offices of the United States to promote\r\nan amicable settlement of the pending controversy, and offered our\r\narbitration, if acceptable to both parties.\r\n\r\nA few days afterward Lord Salisbury, on behalf of Great Britain,\r\nreplied that the attitude which had been taken by the President of the\r\nVenezuelan republic precluded her Majesty’s Government from submitting\r\nthe question at that time to the arbitration of any third power.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Lord Salisbury had declined our offer of mediation and\r\narbitration, was promptly conveyed to the government of Venezuela;\r\nand thereupon, on the fourth day of May, 1887, her minister at\r\nWashington addressed another note to our Secretary of State indicating\r\nmuch depression on account of the failure of all efforts up to that\r\ntime made to induce Great Britain to agree to a settlement of the\r\ncontroversy by arbitration, and expressing the utmost gratitude for the\r\nsteps taken by our Government in aid of those efforts. He also referred\r\nto the desire his government once entertained that, in case arbitration\r\ncould be attained, the United States might be selected as arbitrator,\r\nand to the fact that this desire had been relinquished because the\r\nmaintenance of impartiality essential in an arbitrator would “seriously\r\nimpair the efficiency of action which for the furtherance of the common\r\ninterests of America, and in obedience to the doctrine of the immortal\r\nMonroe, should possess all the vitality that the alarming circumstances\r\ndemand”; and he begged the secretary to instruct our representative in\r\nLondon “to insist, in the name of the United States Government, upon\r\nthe necessity of submitting the boundary question between Venezuela and\r\nBritish Guiana to arbitration.”\r\n\r\nI have heretofore refrained from stating in detail the quite numerous\r\ninstances of quarrel and collision that occurred in and near the\r\ndisputed territory, with increasing frequency, during this controversy.\r\nOne of these, however, I think should be here mentioned. It seems\r\nthat in 1883 two vessels belonging to English subjects were seized\r\nand their crews taken into custody by Venezuelan officials in the\r\ndisputed region, for alleged violations of the laws of Venezuela within\r\nher jurisdiction, and that English officials had assumed, without any\r\njudicial determination and without any notice to Venezuela, to assess\r\ndamages against her on account of such seizure and arrests, in an\r\namount which, with interest, amounted in 1887 to about forty thousand\r\ndollars. On the seventh day of October in that year, the governor\r\nof Trinidad, an English island near the mouth of the Orinoco, in a\r\nletter to the Minister of Foreign Affairs for Venezuela, declared that\r\nher Majesty’s Government could not permit such injuries to remain\r\nunredressed, or their representations to be disregarded any longer,\r\nand thereupon it was demanded that the money claimed, with interest,\r\nbe paid within seven days from the delivery of said letter. The letter\r\nconcluded as follows:\r\n\r\n    Failing compliance with the above demands Her Majesty’s\r\n    Government will be reluctantly compelled to instruct the\r\n    Commander of Her Majesty’s naval forces in the West Indies\r\n    to take such measures as he may deem necessary to obtain\r\n    that reparation which has been vainly sought for by friendly\r\n    means; and in case of so doing they will hold the Venezuelan\r\n    Government responsible for any consequences that may arise.\r\n\r\nVenezuela did not fail to appreciate and frankly acknowledge that, in\r\nher defenseless condition, there was no escape from the payment of the\r\nsum which England, as a judge in its own cause, had decreed against\r\nher. The President of the republic, however, in a prompt reply to the\r\ngovernor’s note, characterized its terms as “offensive to the dignity\r\nof the nation and to the equality which, according to the principles\r\nof the rights of nations, all countries enjoy without any regard to\r\ntheir strength or weakness.” Thereupon he sought the good offices of\r\nour minister to Venezuela in an effort to procure a withdrawal of the\r\nobjectionable communication. This was attempted in a note sent by the\r\nAmerican minister to the governor of Trinidad, in which he said:\r\n\r\n    I hope your Excellency will permit me to suggest, as a mutual\r\n    friend of both parties, the suspension or withdrawal of your\r\n    note of the 7th instant, so that negotiations may at once\r\n    be opened for the immediate and final settlement of the\r\n    afore-mentioned claims without further resort to unpleasant\r\n    measures. From representations made to me, I am satisfied\r\n    that if the note of the 7th instant is withdrawn temporarily\r\n    even, Venezuela will do in the premises that which will prove\r\n    satisfactory to your Government.\r\n\r\nA few days after this note was sent, a reply was received in which the\r\ngovernor of Trinidad courteously expressed his thanks to our minister\r\nfor his good offices, and informed him that, as the Government of\r\nVenezuela regarded his note of October 7 “as offensive, and appeared\r\ndesirous of at last settling this long-pending question in a friendly\r\nspirit,” he promptly telegraphed to her Majesty’s Government asking\r\npermission to withdraw that note and substitute a less forcible one for\r\nit; and that he had just been informed by his home government in reply\r\nthat this arrangement could not be sanctioned.\r\n\r\nOur minister reported this transaction to his home government at\r\nWashington on the fourth day of November, 1887, and stated that the\r\nmoney demanded by Great Britain had been paid by Venezuela under\r\nprotest.\r\n\r\nVenezuela may have been altogether at fault in the transaction out\r\nof which this demand arose; the amount which England exacted may not\r\nhave been unreasonable; and the method of its assessment, though not\r\nthe most considerate possible, has support in precedent; and even\r\nthe threat of a naval force may sometimes be justified in enforcing\r\nunheeded demands. I have not adverted to this incident for the\r\npurpose of inviting judgment on any of its phases, but only to call\r\nattention to the fact that it was allowed to culminate with seemingly\r\nstudied accompaniments of ruthlessness and irritation, at a time when\r\na boundary question was pending between the two nations, when the\r\nweaker contestant was importuning the stronger for arbitration, and\r\nwhen a desire for reconciliation and peace in presence of strained\r\nrelations should have counseled considerateness and magnanimity--all\r\nthis in haughty disregard of the solicitous and expressed desire of\r\nthe Government of the United States to induce a peaceful adjustment\r\nof the boundary dispute, and in curt denial of our request that\r\nthis especially disturbing incident should be relieved of its most\r\nexasperating features.\r\n\r\nIn the trial of causes before our courts, evidence is frequently\r\nintroduced to show the animus or intent of litigating parties.\r\n\r\nPerhaps strict decorum hardly permits us to adopt the following\r\nlanguage, used by the Venezuelan minister when reporting to our\r\nSecretary of State the anticipated arrival of a British war-steamer to\r\nenforce the demand of Great Britain:\r\n\r\n    Such alarming news shows evidently that the Government of Her\r\n    Britannic Majesty, encouraged by the impunity on which it has\r\n    counted until now for the realization of its unjust designs\r\n    with regard to Venezuela, far from procuring a pacific and\r\n    satisfactory agreement on the different questions pending with\r\n    the latter, is especially eager to complicate in order to\r\n    render less possible every day that equitable solution which\r\n    has been so fully the endeavor of my people.\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth day of February, 1888, the Venezuelan minister, in\r\ncommunicating to our Government information he had received touching a\r\ndecree of the governor of Demerara denying the validity of a contract\r\nentered into by the Government of Venezuela for the construction of a\r\nrailway between certain points in the territory claimed by Venezuela,\r\ncommented on the affair as follows:\r\n\r\n    England has at last declared emphatically that her rights are\r\n    without limit, and embrace whatever regions may be suggested\r\n    to her by her insatiate thirst for conquest. She even goes\r\n    so far as to deny the validity of railway grants comprised\r\n    within territory where not even the wildest dream of fancy\r\n    had ever conceived that the day would come when Venezuela’s\r\n    right thereto could be disputed. The fact is that until now\r\n    England has relied upon impunity. She beholds in us a weak and\r\n    unfriended nation, and seeks to make the Venezuelan coast and\r\n    territories the base of a conquest which, if circumstances are\r\n    not altered, will have no other bounds than the dictates of her\r\n    own will.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nMr. Bayard, in a despatch transmitting this to our minister to England,\r\nsays that our Government has heretofore acted upon the assumption that\r\nthe boundary controversy between Great Britain and Venezuela was one\r\nbased on historical facts, which without difficulty could be determined\r\naccording to evidence, but that the British pretension now stated gives\r\nrise to grave disquietude, and creates the apprehension that their\r\nterritorial claim does not follow historical traditions or evidence,\r\nbut is apparently indefinite. He refers to the British Colonial Office\r\nlist of previous years, and calls attention to the wide detour to the\r\nwestward in the boundaries of British Guiana between the years 1877 and\r\n1887, as shown in that record. He suggests that our minister “express\r\nanew to Lord Salisbury the great gratification it would afford our\r\nGovernment to see the Venezuelan dispute amicably and honorably settled\r\nby arbitration or otherwise,” and adds: “If indeed it should appear\r\nthat there is no fixed limit to the British boundary claim, our good\r\ndisposition to aid in a settlement might not only be defeated, but be\r\nobliged to give place to a feeling of grave concern.”\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the Venezuelan minister, in a note\r\nexpressing his appreciation of our efforts to bring about a settlement\r\nof the dispute, made the following statement:\r\n\r\n    Disastrous and fatal consequences would ensue for the\r\n    independence of South America if, under the pretext of a\r\n    question of boundaries, Great Britain should succeed in\r\n    consummating the usurpation of a third part of our territory,\r\n    and therewith a river so important as the Orinoco. Under the\r\n    pretext of a mere question of boundaries which began on the\r\n    banks of the Essequibo, we now find ourselves on the verge of\r\n    losing regions lying more than five degrees away from that\r\n    river.\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1890, Mr. Blaine, Mr. Bayard’s successor as Secretary of\r\nState, instructed Mr. Robert T. Lincoln, our minister to England, “to\r\nuse his good offices with Lord Salisbury to bring about the resumption\r\nof diplomatic intercourse between Great Britain and Venezuela as a\r\npreliminary step toward the settlement of the boundary dispute by\r\narbitration.” He also requested him “to propose to Lord Salisbury,\r\nwith a view to an accommodation, that an informal conference be had in\r\nWashington or in London of representatives of the three powers.” The\r\nsecretary added: “In such conference the position of the United States\r\nis one solely of impartial friendship toward both litigants.”\r\n\r\nIn response to this instruction Mr. Lincoln had an interview with\r\nLord Salisbury. On this occasion his Lordship said that her Majesty’s\r\nGovernment had not for some time been keen in attempts to settle the\r\ndispute, in view of their feeling of uncertainty as to the stability\r\nof the present Venezuelan Government and the frequency of revolutions\r\nin that quarter; but that he would take pleasure in considering our\r\nsuggestion after consulting the Colonial Office, to which it would\r\nfirst have to be referred. Mr. Lincoln, in giving his impressions\r\nderived from the interview, says that “while Lord Salisbury did\r\nnot intimate what would probably be the nature of his reply, there\r\nwas certainly nothing unfavorable in his manner of receiving the\r\nsuggestion”; and he follows this with these significant words: “If the\r\nmatter had been entirely new and dissociated with its previous history,\r\nI should have felt from his tone that the idea of arbitration in some\r\nform, to put an end to the boundary dispute, was quite agreeable to\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of May, 1890, Lord Salisbury addressed a note to Mr.\r\nLincoln, in which his Lordship stated that her Majesty’s Government was\r\nat that moment in communication with the Venezuelan minister in Paris,\r\nwho had been authorized to express the desire of his Government for the\r\nrenewal of diplomatic relations, and to discuss the conditions on which\r\nit might be effected; that the terms on which her Majesty’s Government\r\nconsidered that a settlement of the question in issue between the\r\ntwo countries might be made, had been communicated to Venezuela’s\r\nrepresentative; that his reply was still awaited, and that the British\r\nGovernment “would wish to have the opportunity of examining that\r\nreply, and ascertaining what prospect it would afford of an adjustment\r\nof existing differences, before considering the expediency of having\r\nrecourse to the good offices of a third party.”\r\n\r\nNo mention was made, in this communication, nor at any time thereafter,\r\nso far as I can discover, of Mr. Blaine’s proposal of a conference\r\namong representatives of the three nations interested in an adjustment.\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury, in a despatch to the English representative at\r\nWashington, dated November 11, 1891, stated that our minister to\r\nEngland had, in conversation with him, renewed, on the part of our\r\nGovernment, the expression of a hope that the Government of Great\r\nBritain would refer the boundary dispute to arbitration; that his\r\nLordship had expressed his willingness to submit to arbitration all the\r\nquestions which seemed to his government to be fairly capable of being\r\ntreated as questions of controversy; that the principal obstacle was\r\nthe rupture of diplomatic relations caused by Venezuela’s act; and that\r\nbefore the Government of Great Britain could renew negotiations they\r\nmust be satisfied that those relations were about to be resumed with a\r\nprospect of their continuance.\r\n\r\nWhile our Government was endeavoring to influence Great Britain in the\r\ndirection of fair and just arbitration, and receiving for our pains\r\nonly barren assurances and procrastinating excuses, the appeals of\r\nVenezuela for help, stimulated by allegations of constantly increasing\r\nEnglish pretensions, were incessantly ringing in our ears.\r\n\r\nWithout mentioning a number of these appeals, and passing over a period\r\nof more than two years, I shall next refer to a representation made\r\nby the Venezuelan minister at Washington on March 31, 1894, to Mr.\r\nGresham, who was then our Secretary of State. In this communication\r\nthe course of the controversy and the alleged unauthorized acts\r\nof England from the beginning to that date were rehearsed with\r\ncircumstantial particularity. The conduct of Great Britain in refusing\r\narbitration was again reprobated, and pointed reference was made to\r\na principle which had been asserted by the United States, “that the\r\nnations of the American continent, after having acquired the liberty\r\nand independence which they enjoy and maintain, were not subject to\r\ncolonization by any European power.” The minister further declared that\r\n“Venezuela has been ready to adhere to the conciliatory counsel of the\r\nUnited States that a conference, consisting of its own Representative\r\nand those of the two parties, should meet at Washington or London\r\nfor the purpose of preparing an honorable reëstablishment of harmony\r\nbetween the litigants,” and that “Great Britain has disregarded the\r\nequitable proposition of the United States.”\r\n\r\nOn July 13, 1894, Mr. Gresham sent a despatch to Mr. Bayard, formerly\r\nSecretary of State, but then ambassador to England, inclosing the\r\ncommunication of the Venezuelan minister, calling particular attention\r\nto its contents, and at the same time briefly discussing the boundary\r\ndispute. In this despatch Mr. Gresham said:\r\n\r\n    The recourse to arbitration first proposed in 1881, having been\r\n    supported by your predecessors, was in turn advocated by you,\r\n    in a spirit of friendly regard for the two nations involved.\r\n    In the meantime successive advances of British settlers in the\r\n    region admittedly in dispute were followed by similar advances\r\n    of British Colonial administration, contesting and supplanting\r\n    Venezuelan claims to exercise authority therein.\r\n\r\nHe adds: “Toward the end of 1887, the British territorial claim, which\r\nhad, as it would seem, been silently increased by some twenty-three\r\nthousand square miles between 1885 and 1886, took another comprehensive\r\nsweep westward to embrace” a certain rich mining district. “Since\r\nthen,” the secretary further states, “repeated efforts have been made\r\nby Venezuela as a directly interested party, and by the United States\r\nas the impartial friend of both countries, to bring about a resumption\r\nof diplomatic relations, which had been suspended in consequence of the\r\ndispute now under consideration.”\r\n\r\nThis despatch concludes as follows:\r\n\r\n    The President is inspired by a desire for a peaceable and\r\n    honorable adjustment of the existing difficulties between an\r\n    American state and a powerful transatlantic nation, and would\r\n    be glad to see the reëstablishment of such diplomatic relations\r\n    between them as would promote that end. I can discover but\r\n    two equitable solutions to the present controversy. One is the\r\n    arbitral determination of the rights of the disputants as the\r\n    respective successors to the historical rights of Holland and\r\n    Spain over the region in question. The other is to create a\r\n    new boundary-line in accordance with the dictates of mutual\r\n    expediency and consideration. The two Governments having so far\r\n    been unable to agree on a conventional line, the consistent\r\n    and conspicuous advocacy by the United States and England of\r\n    the principle of arbitration, and their recourse thereto in\r\n    settlement of important questions arising between them, makes\r\n    such a mode of adjustment especially appropriate in the present\r\n    instance; and this Government will gladly do what it can to\r\n    further a determination in that sense.\r\n\r\nIn another despatch to Mr. Bayard, dated December 1, 1894, Mr. Gresham\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    I cannot believe Her Majesty’s Government will maintain that\r\n    the validity of their claim to territory long in dispute\r\n    between the two countries shall be conceded as a condition\r\n    precedent to the arbitration of the question whether Venezuela\r\n    is entitled to other territory, which until a recent period was\r\n    never in doubt. Our interest in the question has repeatedly\r\n    been shown by our friendly efforts to further a settlement\r\n    alike honorable to both countries, and the President is pleased\r\n    to know that Venezuela will soon renew her efforts to bring\r\n    about such an adjustment.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterward, on December 3, 1894, the President’s annual message\r\nwas sent to the Congress, containing the following reference to the\r\ncontroversy:\r\n\r\n    The boundary of British Guiana still remains in dispute\r\n    between Great Britain and Venezuela. Believing that its early\r\n    settlement on some just basis alike honorable to both parties\r\n    is in the line of our established policy to remove from this\r\n    hemisphere all causes of difference with powers beyond the\r\n    sea, I shall renew the efforts heretofore made to bring about\r\n    a restoration of diplomatic relations between the disputants\r\n    and to induce a reference to arbitration--a resort which Great\r\n    Britain so conspicuously favors in principle and respects in\r\n    practice, and which is earnestly sought by her weaker adversary.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-second day of February, 1895, a joint resolution was\r\npassed by the Congress, earnestly recommending to both parties in\r\ninterest the President’s suggestion “that Great Britain and Venezuela\r\nrefer their dispute as to boundaries to friendly arbitration.”\r\n\r\nA despatch dated February 23, 1895, from Great Britain’s Foreign\r\nOffice to the English ambassador at Washington, stated that on the\r\ntwenty-fifth day of January, 1895, our ambassador, Mr. Bayard, had, in\r\nan official interview, referred to the boundary controversy, and said\r\n“that his Government would gladly lend their good offices to bring\r\nabout a settlement by means of an arbitration.” The despatch further\r\nstated that Mr. Bayard had thereupon been informed that her Majesty’s\r\nGovernment had expressed their willingness to submit the question,\r\nwithin certain limits, to arbitration, but could not agree to the\r\nmore extensive reference on which the Venezuelan Government insisted;\r\nthat Mr. Bayard called again on the twentieth day of February, when a\r\nmemorandum was read to him concerning the situation and a map shown him\r\nof the territory in dispute; that at the same time he was informed that\r\nthe Venezuelans had recently made an aggression upon the territory of\r\nEnglish occupation, and, according to report, ill-treated some of the\r\ncolonial police stationed there, and that it was the boundary defined\r\nby the Schomburgk line which had thus been violated in a marked manner\r\nby the Venezuelans.\r\n\r\nThis despatch concludes as follows:\r\n\r\n    On Mr. Bayard’s observing that the United States Government\r\n    was anxious to do anything in their power to facilitate a\r\n    settlement of the difficulty by arbitration, I reminded his\r\n    Excellency that although Her Majesty’s Government were ready\r\n    to go to arbitration as to a certain portion of the territory\r\n    which I had pointed out to him, they could not consent to any\r\n    departure from the Schomburgk line.\r\n\r\nIt now became plainly apparent that a new stage had been reached in the\r\nprogress of our intervention, and that the ominous happenings embraced\r\nwithin a few months had hastened the day when we were challenged to\r\ntake our exact bearings, lest we should miss the course of honor\r\nand national duty. The more direct tone that had been given to our\r\ndespatches concerning the dispute, our more insistent and emphatic\r\nsuggestion of arbitration, the serious reference to the subject\r\nin the President’s message, the significant resolution passed by\r\nCongress earnestly recommending arbitration, all portended a growth of\r\nconviction on the part of our Government concerning this controversy,\r\nwhich gave birth to pronounced disappointment and anxiety when Great\r\nBritain, concurrently with these apprising incidents, repeated in\r\ndirect and positive terms her refusal to submit to arbitration except\r\non condition that a portion of the disputed territory which Venezuela\r\nhad always claimed to be hers should at the outset be irrevocably\r\nconceded to England.\r\n\r\nDuring a period of more than fourteen years our Government, assuming\r\nthe character of a mutual and disinterested friend of both countries,\r\nhad, with varying assiduity, tendered its good offices to bring about\r\na pacific and amicable settlement of this boundary controversy, only\r\nto be repelled with more or less civility by Great Britain. We had\r\nseen her pretensions in the disputed regions widen and extend in\r\nsuch manner and upon such pretexts as seemed to constitute an actual\r\nor threatened violation of a doctrine which our nation long ago\r\nestablished, declaring that the American continents are not to be\r\nconsidered subjects for future colonization by any European power; and\r\ndespite all this we had, nevertheless, hoped, during all these years,\r\nthat arrangement and accommodation between the principal parties would\r\njustify us in keeping an invocation of that doctrine in the background\r\nof the discussion. Notwithstanding, however, all our efforts to avoid\r\nit, we could not be unmindful of the conditions which the progress of\r\nevents had created, and whose meaning and whose exigencies inexorably\r\nconfronted us. England had finally and unmistakably declared that all\r\nthe territory embraced within the Schomburgk line was indisputably\r\nhers. Venezuela presented a claim to territory within the same\r\nlimits, which could not be said to lack strong support. England\r\nhad absolutely refused to permit Venezuela’s claim to be tested by\r\narbitration; and Venezuela was utterly powerless to resist by force\r\nEngland’s self-pronounced decree of ownership. If this decree was not\r\njustified by the facts, and it should be enforced against the protest\r\nand insistence of Venezuela and should result in the possession and\r\ncolonization of Venezuelan territory by Great Britain, it seemed quite\r\nplain that the American doctrine which denies to European powers the\r\ncolonization of any part of the American continent would be violated.\r\n\r\nIf the ultimatum of Great Britain as to her claim of territory had\r\nappeared to us so thoroughly supported upon the facts as to admit of\r\nsmall doubt, we might have escaped the responsibility of insisting\r\non an observance of the Monroe Doctrine in the premises, on our own\r\naccount, and have still remained the disinterested friend of both\r\ncountries, merely contenting ourselves with benevolent attempts to\r\nreconcile the disputants. We were, however, far from discovering\r\nsuch satisfactory support in the evidence within our reach. On the\r\ncontrary, we believed that the effects of our acquiescence in Great\r\nBritain’s pretensions would amount to a failure to uphold and maintain\r\na principle universally accepted by our Government and our people\r\nas vitally essential to our national integrity and welfare. The\r\narbitration, for which Venezuela pleaded, would have adjudged the exact\r\ncondition of the rival claims, would have forever silenced Venezuela’s\r\ncomplaints, and would have displaced by conclusive sentence our\r\nunwelcome doubts and suspicions; but this Great Britain had refused to\r\nVenezuela, and thus far had also denied to us.\r\n\r\nRecreancy to a principle so fundamentally American as the Monroe\r\nDoctrine, on the part of those charged with the administration of our\r\nGovernment, was of course out of the question. Inasmuch, therefore,\r\nas all our efforts to avoid its assertion had miscarried, there\r\nwas nothing left for us to do consistently with national honor but\r\nto take the place of Venezuela in the controversy, so far as that\r\nwas necessary, in vindication of our American doctrine. Our mild\r\nand amiable proffers of good offices, and the hopes we indulged\r\nthat at last they might be the means of securing to a weak sister\r\nrepublic peace and justice, and to ourselves immunity from sterner\r\ninterposition, were not suited to the new emergency. In the advanced\r\ncondition of the dispute, sympathy with Venezuela and solicitude for\r\nher distressed condition could no longer constitute the motive power of\r\nour conduct, but these were to give way to the duty and obligation of\r\nprotecting our own national rights.\r\n\r\nMr. Gresham, who since the fourth day of March, 1893, had been our\r\nSecretary of State, died in the latter days of May, 1895. His love\r\nof justice, his sympathy with every cause that deserved sympathy, his\r\nfearless and disinterested patriotism, and his rare mental endowments,\r\ncombined to make him a noble American and an able advocate of his\r\ncountry’s honor. To such a man every phase of the Venezuelan boundary\r\ndispute strongly appealed; and he had been conscientiously diligent\r\nin acquainting himself with its history and in considering the\r\ncontingencies that might arise in its future development. Though his\r\ndeath was most lamentable, I have always considered it a providential\r\ncircumstance that the Government then had among its Cabinet officers an\r\nexceptionally strong and able man, in every way especially qualified\r\nto fill the vacant place, and thoroughly familiar with the pending\r\ncontroversy--which seemed every day to bring us closer to momentous\r\nduty and responsibility.\r\n\r\nMr. Olney was appointed Secretary of State early in June, 1895; and\r\npromptly thereafter, at the suggestion of the President, he began, with\r\ncharacteristic energy and vigor, to make preparation for the decisive\r\nstep which it seemed should no longer be delayed.\r\n\r\nThe seriousness of the business we had in hand was fully understood,\r\nand the difficulty or impossibility of retracing the step we\r\ncontemplated was thoroughly appreciated. The absolute necessity of\r\ncertainty concerning the facts which should underlie our action was, of\r\ncourse, perfectly apparent. Whatever our beliefs or convictions might\r\nbe, as derived from the examination we had thus far given the case, and\r\nhowever strongly we might be persuaded that Great Britain’s pretensions\r\ncould not be conceded consistently with our maintenance of the Monroe\r\nDoctrine, it would, nevertheless, have been manifestly improper and\r\nheedless on our part to find conclusively against Great Britain, before\r\nsoliciting her again and in new circumstances to give us an opportunity\r\nto judge of the merits of her claims through the submission of them to\r\narbitration.\r\n\r\nIt was determined, therefore, that a communication should be prepared\r\nfor presentation to the British Government through our ambassador\r\nto England, detailing the progress and incidents of the controversy\r\nas we apprehended them, giving a thorough exposition of the origin\r\nof the Monroe Doctrine, and the reasons on which it was based,\r\ndemonstrating our interest in the controversy because of its relation\r\nto that doctrine, and from our new standpoint and on our own account\r\nrequesting Great Britain to join Venezuela in submitting to arbitration\r\ntheir contested claims to the entire territory in dispute.\r\n\r\nThis was accordingly done; and a despatch to this effect, dated July\r\n20, 1895, was sent by Mr. Olney to her Majesty’s Government through Mr.\r\nBayard, our ambassador.\r\n\r\nThe Monroe Doctrine may be abandoned; we may forfeit it by taking our\r\nlot with nations that expand by following un-American ways; we may\r\noutgrow it, as we seem to be outgrowing other things we once valued;\r\nor it may forever stand as a guaranty of protection and safety in our\r\nenjoyment of free institutions; but in no event will this American\r\nprinciple ever be better defined, better defended, or more bravely\r\nasserted than was done by Mr. Olney in this despatch.\r\n\r\nAfter referring to the various incidents of the controversy, and\r\nstating the conditions then existing, it was declared:\r\n\r\n    The accuracy of the foregoing analysis of the existing status\r\n    cannot, it is believed, be challenged. It shows that status to\r\n    be such, that those charged with the interests of the United\r\n    States are now forced to determine exactly what those interests\r\n    are and what course of action they require. It compels them\r\n    to decide to what extent, if any, the United States may and\r\n    should intervene in a controversy between, and primarily\r\n    concerning, only Great Britain and Venezuela, and to decide\r\n    how far it is bound to see that the integrity of Venezuelan\r\n    territory is not impaired by the pretensions of its powerful\r\n    antagonist.\r\n\r\nAfter an exhaustive explanation and vindication of the Monroe Doctrine,\r\nand after asserting that aggressions by Great Britain on Venezuelan\r\nsoil would fall within its purview, the despatch proceeded as follows:\r\n\r\n    While Venezuela charges such usurpation, Great Britain denies\r\n    it; and the United States, until the merits are authoritatively\r\n    ascertained, can take sides with neither. But while this\r\n    is so,--while the United States may not, under existing\r\n    circumstances at least, take upon itself to say which of the\r\n    two parties is right and which is wrong,--it is certainly\r\n    within its right to demand that the truth be ascertained.\r\n    Being entitled to resent and resist any sequestration of\r\n    Venezuelan soil by Great Britain, it is necessarily entitled to\r\n    know whether such sequestration has occurred or is now going\r\n    on.... It being clear, therefore, that the United States may\r\n    legitimately insist upon the merits of the boundary question\r\n    being determined, it is equally clear that there is but one\r\n    feasible mode of determining them, viz., peaceful arbitration.\r\n\r\nThe demand of Great Britain that her right to a portion of the disputed\r\nterritory should be acknowledged as a condition of her consent to\r\narbitration as to the remainder, was thus characterized:\r\n\r\n    It is not perceived how such an attitude can be defended, nor\r\n    how it is reconcilable with that love of justice and fair\r\n    play so eminently characteristic of the English race. It in\r\n    effect deprives Venezuela of her free agency and puts her under\r\n    virtual duress. Territory acquired by reason of it will be as\r\n    much wrested from her by the strong hand as if occupied by\r\n    British troops or covered by British fleets.\r\n\r\nThe despatch, after directing the presentation to Lord Salisbury of the\r\nviews it contained, concluded as follows:\r\n\r\n    They call for a definite decision upon the point whether Great\r\n    Britain will consent or decline to submit the Venezuelan\r\n    boundary question in its entirety to impartial arbitration. It\r\n    is the earnest hope of the President that the conclusion will\r\n    be on the side of arbitration, and that Great Britain will\r\n    add one more to the conspicuous precedents she has already\r\n    furnished in favor of that wise and just mode of settling\r\n    international disputes. If he is to be disappointed in that\r\n    hope, however,--a result not to be anticipated, and in his\r\n    judgment calculated to greatly embarrass the future relations\r\n    between this country and Great Britain,--it is his wish to be\r\n    made acquainted with the fact at such early date as will enable\r\n    him to lay the whole subject before Congress in his next annual\r\n    message.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThe reply of Great Britain to this communication consisted of two\r\ndespatches addressed by Lord Salisbury to the British ambassador\r\nat Washington for submission to our Government. Though dated the\r\ntwenty-sixth day of November, 1895, these despatches were not presented\r\nto our State Department until a number of days after the assemblage of\r\nthe Congress in the following month. In one of these communications\r\nLord Salisbury, in dealing with the Monroe Doctrine and the right or\r\npropriety of our appeal to it in the pending controversy, declared:\r\n“The dangers which were apprehended by President Monroe have no\r\nrelation to the state of things in which we live at the present day.”\r\nHe further declared:\r\n\r\n    But the circumstances with which President Monroe was\r\n    dealing and those to which the present American Government\r\n    is addressing itself have very few features in common. Great\r\n    Britain is imposing no “system” upon Venezuela and is not\r\n    concerning herself in any way with the nature of the political\r\n    institutions under which the Venezuelans may prefer to live.\r\n    But the British Empire and the Republic of Venezuela are\r\n    neighbors, and they have differed for some time past, and\r\n    continue to differ, as to the line by which their dominions are\r\n    separated. It is a controversy with which the United States\r\n    have no apparent practical concern.... The disputed frontier\r\n    of Venezuela has nothing to do with any of the questions dealt\r\n    with by President Monroe.\r\n\r\nHis Lordship, in commenting upon our position as developed in Mr.\r\nOlney’s despatch, defined it in these terms: “If any independent\r\nAmerican state advances a demand for territory of which its neighbor\r\nclaims to be the owner, and that neighbor is a colony of an European\r\nstate, the United States have a right to insist that the European state\r\nshall submit the demand and its own impugned rights to arbitration.”\r\n\r\nI confess I should be greatly disappointed if I believed that the\r\nhistory I have attempted to give of this controversy did not easily and\r\npromptly suggest that this definition of our contention fails to take\r\ninto account some of its most important and controlling features.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of arbitration as a method of terminating international\r\ndifferences, Lord Salisbury said:\r\n\r\n    It has proved itself valuable in many cases, but it is not free\r\n    from defects which often operate as a serious drawback on\r\n    its value. It is not always easy to find an arbitrator who is\r\n    competent and who, at the same time, is wholly free from bias;\r\n    and the task of insuring compliance with the award when it is\r\n    made is not exempt from difficulty. It is a mode of settlement\r\n    of which the value varies much according to the nature of the\r\n    controversy to which it is applied and the character of the\r\n    litigants who appeal to it. Whether in any particular case\r\n    it is a suitable method of procedure is generally a delicate\r\n    and difficult question. The only parties who are competent\r\n    to decide that question are the two parties whose rival\r\n    contentions are in issue. The claim of a third nation which\r\n    is unaffected by the controversy to impose this particular\r\n    procedure on either of the two others cannot be reasonably\r\n    justified and has no foundation in the law of nations.\r\n\r\nImmediately following this statement his Lordship again touched upon\r\nthe Monroe Doctrine for the purpose of specifically disclaiming its\r\nacceptance by her Majesty’s Government as a sound and valid principle.\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n    It must always be mentioned with respect, on account of the\r\n    distinguished statesman to whom it is due and the great nation\r\n    who have generally adopted it. But international law is founded\r\n    on the general consent of nations; and no statesman, however\r\n    eminent, and no nation, however powerful, are competent to\r\n    insert into the code of international law a novel principle\r\n    which was never recognized before, and which has not since been\r\n    accepted by the Government of any other country. The United\r\n    States have a right, like any other nation, to interpose in any\r\n    controversy by which their own interests are affected; and they\r\n    are the judge whether those interests are touched and in what\r\n    measure they should be sustained. But their rights are in no\r\n    way strengthened or extended by the fact that the controversy\r\n    affects some territory which is called American.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this despatch Lord Salisbury declared that her\r\nMajesty’s Government “fully concur with the view which President\r\nMonroe apparently entertained, that any disturbance of the existing\r\nterritorial distribution in that hemisphere by any fresh acquisitions\r\non the part of any European state would be a highly inexpedient change.\r\nBut they are not prepared to admit that the recognition of that\r\nexpediency is clothed with the sanction which belongs to a doctrine of\r\ninternational law. They are not prepared to admit that the interests\r\nof the United States are necessarily concerned in any frontier dispute\r\nwhich may arise between any two of the states who possess dominions in\r\nthe Western Hemisphere; and still less can they accept the doctrine\r\nthat the United States are entitled to claim that the process of\r\narbitration shall be applied to any demand for the surrender of\r\nterritory which one of those states may make against another.”\r\n\r\nThe other despatch of Lord Salisbury, which accompanied the one upon\r\nwhich I have commented, was mainly devoted to a statement of facts\r\nand evidence on Great Britain’s side in the boundary controversy; and\r\nin making such statement his Lordship in general terms designated the\r\nterritory to which her Majesty’s Government was entitled as being\r\nembraced within the lines of the most extreme claim which she had at\r\nany time presented. He added:\r\n\r\n    A portion of that claim, however, they have always been willing\r\n    to waive altogether; in regard to another portion they have\r\n    been and continue to be perfectly ready to submit the question\r\n    of their title to arbitration. As regards the rest, that which\r\n    lies within the so-called Schomburgk line, they do not consider\r\n    that the rights of Great Britain are open to question. Even\r\n    within that line they have on various occasions offered to\r\n    Venezuela considerable concessions as a matter of friendship\r\n    and conciliation and for the purpose of securing an amicable\r\n    settlement of the dispute. If, as time has gone on, the\r\n    concessions thus offered have been withdrawn, this has been the\r\n    necessary consequence of the gradual spread over the country of\r\n    British settlements, which Her Majesty’s Government cannot in\r\n    justice to the inhabitants offer to surrender to foreign rule.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion his Lordship asserts that his Government has\r\n\r\n    repeatedly expressed their readiness to submit to arbitration\r\n    the conflicting claims of Great Britain and Venezuela to large\r\n    tracts of territory which from their auriferous nature are\r\n    known to be of almost untold value. But they cannot consent\r\n    to entertain, or to submit to the arbitration of another\r\n    power or of foreign jurists however eminent, claims based on\r\n    the extravagant pretensions of Spanish officials in the last\r\n    century and involving the transfer of large numbers of British\r\n    subjects, who have for many years enjoyed the settled rule of\r\n    a British colony, to a nation of different race and language,\r\n    whose political system is subject to frequent disturbance, and\r\n    whose institutions as yet too often afford very inadequate\r\n    protection to life and property.\r\n\r\nThese despatches exhibit a refusal to admit such an interest in the\r\ncontroversy on our part as entitled us to insist upon an arbitration\r\nfor the purpose of having the line between Great Britain and Venezuela\r\nestablished; a denial of such force or meaning to the Monroe Doctrine\r\nas made it worthy of the regard of Great Britain in the premises;\r\nand a fixed and continued determination on the part of her Majesty’s\r\nGovernment to reject arbitration as to any territory included within\r\nthe extended Schomburgk line. They further indicate that the existence\r\nof gold within the disputed territory had not been overlooked; and\r\nthey distinctly put forward the colonization and settlement by English\r\nsubjects in such territory, during more than half a century of dispute,\r\nas creating a claim to dominion and sovereignty, if not strong enough\r\nto override all question of right and title, at least so clear and\r\nindisputable as to be properly considered as above and beyond the\r\ncontingencies of arbitration.\r\n\r\nIf we had been obliged to accept Lord Salisbury’s estimate of the\r\nMonroe Doctrine, and his ideas of our interest, or rather want of\r\ninterest, in the settlement of the boundary between Great Britain and\r\nVenezuela, his despatches would have certainly been very depressing.\r\nIt would have been unpleasant for us to know that a doctrine which we\r\nhad supposed for seventy years to be of great value and importance to\r\nus and our national safety was, after all, a mere plaything with which\r\nwe might amuse ourselves; and that our efforts to enforce it were to\r\nbe regarded by Great Britain and other European nations as meddlesome\r\ninterferences with affairs in which we could have no legitimate concern.\r\n\r\nThe reply of the English Government to Mr. Olney’s despatch, whatever\r\nelse it accomplished, seemed absolutely to destroy any hope we might\r\nhave entertained that, in our changed position in the controversy and\r\nupon our independent solicitation, arbitration might be conceded to us.\r\nSince, therefore, Great Britain was unwilling, on any consideration,\r\nto coöperate with Venezuela in setting on foot an investigation of\r\ntheir contested claim, and since prudence and care dictated that any\r\nfurther steps we might take should be proved to be as fully justified\r\nas was practicable in the circumstances, there seemed to be no better\r\nway open to us than to inaugurate a careful independent investigation\r\nof the merits of the controversy, on our own motion, with a view of\r\ndetermining as accurately as possible, for our own guidance, where the\r\ndivisional line between the two countries should be located.\r\n\r\nMr. Olney’s despatch and Lord Salisbury’s reply were submitted to the\r\nCongress on the seventeenth day of December, 1895, accompanied by a\r\nmessage from the President.\r\n\r\nIn this message the President, after stating Lord Salisbury’s positions\r\ntouching the Monroe Doctrine, declared:\r\n\r\n    Without attempting extended argument in reply to these\r\n    positions, it may not be amiss to suggest that the doctrine\r\n    upon which we stand is strong and sound, because its\r\n    enforcement is important to our peace and safety as a nation,\r\n    and is essential to the integrity of our free institutions and\r\n    the tranquil maintenance of our distinctive form of government.\r\n    It was intended to apply to every stage of our national life,\r\n    and cannot become obsolete while our Republic endures. If the\r\n    balance of power is justly a cause for jealous anxiety among\r\n    the governments of the Old World and a subject for our absolute\r\n    non-interference, none the less is the observance of the Monroe\r\n    Doctrine of vital concern to our people and their Government.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the claim made by Lord Salisbury that this doctrine had no\r\nplace in international law, it was said in the message: “The Monroe\r\nDoctrine finds its recognition in those principles of international law\r\nwhich are based upon the theory that every nation shall have its rights\r\nprotected and its just claims enforced.”\r\n\r\nReferring to the request contained in Mr. Olney’s despatch that the\r\nentire boundary controversy be submitted to arbitration, the following\r\nlanguage was used:\r\n\r\n    It will be seen from the correspondence herewith submitted that\r\n    this proposition has been declined by the British Government\r\n    upon grounds which in the circumstances seem to me to be far\r\n    from satisfactory. It is deeply disappointing that such an\r\n    appeal, actuated by the most friendly feelings toward both\r\n    nations directly concerned, addressed to the sense of justice\r\n    and to the magnanimity of one of the great powers of the world,\r\n    and touching its relations to one comparatively weak and small,\r\n    should have produced no better results.\r\n\r\n    The course to be pursued by this Government in view of the\r\n    present condition does not appear to admit of serious doubt.\r\n    Having labored faithfully for many years to induce Great\r\n    Britain to submit their dispute to impartial arbitration, and\r\n    having been finally apprised of her refusal to do so, nothing\r\n    remains but to accept the situation, to recognize its plain\r\n    requirements, and deal with it accordingly. Great Britain’s\r\n    present proposition has never thus far been regarded as\r\n    admissible by Venezuela, though any adjustment of the boundary\r\n    which that country may deem for her advantage and may enter\r\n    into of her own free will cannot, of course, be objected to\r\n    by the United States. Assuming, however, that the attitude of\r\n    Venezuela will remain unchanged, the dispute has reached such\r\n    a stage as to make it now incumbent upon the United States to\r\n    take measures to determine with sufficient certainty for its\r\n    justification what is the true divisional line between the\r\n    Republic of Venezuela and British Guiana. The inquiry to that\r\n    end should, of course, be conducted carefully and judicially;\r\n    and due weight should be given to all available evidence,\r\n    records, and facts in support of the claims of both parties.\r\n\r\nAfter recommending to the Congress an adequate appropriation to\r\nmeet the expense of a commission which should make the suggested\r\ninvestigation and report thereon with the least possible delay, the\r\nPresident concluded his message as follows:\r\n\r\n    When such report is made and accepted, it will, in my opinion,\r\n    be the duty of the United States to resist by every means\r\n    in its power, as a wilful aggression upon its rights and\r\n    interests, the appropriation by Great Britain of any lands or\r\n    the exercise of governmental jurisdiction over any territory\r\n    which after investigation we have determined of right belongs\r\n    to Venezuela.\r\n\r\n    In making these recommendations I am fully alive to the\r\n    responsibility incurred, and keenly realize all the\r\n    consequences that may follow.\r\n\r\n    I am, nevertheless, firm in my conviction that while it is a\r\n    grievous thing to contemplate the two great English-speaking\r\n    peoples of the world as being otherwise than friendly\r\n    competitors in the onward march of civilization, and strenuous\r\n    and worthy rivals in all the arts of peace, there is no\r\n    calamity which a great nation can invite which equals that\r\n    which follows a supine submission to wrong and injustice, and\r\n    the consequent loss of national self-respect and honor, beneath\r\n    which are shielded and defended a people’s safety and greatness.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations contained in this message were acted upon with\r\nsuch promptness and unanimity that on the twenty-first day of\r\nDecember, 1895, four days after they were submitted, a law was passed\r\nby the Congress authorizing the President to appoint a commission\r\n“to investigate and report upon the true divisional line between\r\nthe Republic of Venezuela and British Guiana,” and making an ample\r\nappropriation to meet the expenses of its work.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of January, 1896, five of our most able and\r\ndistinguished citizens were selected to constitute the commission; and\r\nthey immediately entered upon their investigation. At the outset of\r\ntheir labors, and on the fifteenth day of January, 1896, the president\r\nof the commission suggested to Mr. Olney the expediency of calling\r\nthe attention of the Governments of Great Britain and Venezuela to\r\nthe appointment of the commission, adding: “It may be that they would\r\nsee a way entirely consistent with their own sense of international\r\npropriety to give the Commission the aid that it is no doubt in\r\ntheir power to furnish in the way of documentary proof, historical\r\nnarrative, unpublished archives, or the like.” This suggestion, on its\r\npresentation to the Government of Great Britain, was met by a most\r\ncourteous and willing offer to supply to our commission every means\r\nof information touching the subject of their investigation which was\r\nwithin the reach of the English authorities; and at all times during\r\nthe labors of the commission this offer was cheerfully fulfilled.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, and as early as February, 1896, the question of\r\nsubmitting the Venezuelan boundary dispute to mutual arbitration was\r\nagain agitated between the United States and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nOur ambassador to England, in a note to Lord Salisbury, dated February\r\n27, 1896, after speaking of such arbitration as seeming to be “almost\r\nunanimously desired by both the United States and Great Britain,”\r\nproposed, in pursuance of instructions from his Government, “an\r\nentrance forthwith upon negotiations at Washington to effect this\r\npurpose, and that Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Washington should be\r\nempowered to discuss the question at that capital with the Secretary\r\nof State.” He also requested that a definition should be given of\r\n“settlements” in the disputed territory which it was understood her\r\nMajesty’s Government desired should be excluded from the proposed\r\nsubmission to arbitration.\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury, in his reply to this note, dated March 3, 1896, said:\r\n\r\n    The communications which have already passed between Her\r\n    Majesty’s Government and that of the United States have made\r\n    you acquainted with the desire of Her Majesty’s Government to\r\n    bring the difference between themselves and the Republic of\r\n    Venezuela to an equitable settlement. They therefore readily\r\n    concur in the suggestion that negotiations for this purpose\r\n    should be opened at Washington without unnecessary delay. I\r\n    have accordingly empowered Sir Julian Pauncefote to discuss the\r\n    question either with the representative of Venezuela or with\r\n    the Government of the United States acting as the friend of\r\n    Venezuela.\r\n\r\nWith this transfer of treaty negotiations to Washington, Mr. Olney\r\nand Sir Julian Pauncefote, the ambassador of Great Britain to this\r\ncountry, industriously addressed themselves to the subject. The\r\ninsistence of Great Britain that her title to the territory within\r\nthe Schomburgk line should not be questioned, was no longer placed by\r\nher in the way of submitting the rights of the parties in the entire\r\ndisputed territory to arbitration. She still insisted, however, that\r\nEnglish settlers long in the occupancy of any of the territory in\r\ncontroversy, supposing it to be under British dominion, should have\r\ntheir rights scrupulously considered. Any difference of view that\r\narose from this proposition was adjusted without serious difficulty,\r\nby agreeing that adverse holding or prescription during a period of\r\nfifty years should make a good title, and that the arbitrators might\r\ndeem exclusive political control of a district, as well as actual\r\nsettlement, sufficient to constitute adverse holding or to make title\r\nby prescription.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of November, 1896, Mr. Olney addressed a note to the\r\npresident of the commission which had been appointed to investigate\r\nthe boundary question on behalf of our Government, in which he said:\r\n“The United States and Great Britain are in entire accord as to the\r\nprovisions of a proposed treaty between Great Britain and Venezuela.\r\nThe treaty is so eminently just and fair as respects both parties--so\r\nthoroughly protects the rights and claims of Venezuela--that I cannot\r\nconceive of its not being approved by the Venezuelan President and\r\nCongress. It is thoroughly approved by the counsel of Venezuela here\r\nand by the Venezuelan Minister at this Capital.” In view of these\r\nconditions he suggested a suspension of the work of the commission.\r\n\r\nThe treaty was signed at Washington by the representatives of Great\r\nBritain and Venezuela on the second day of February, 1897. No part of\r\nthe territory in dispute was reserved from the arbitration it created.\r\nIt was distinctly made the duty of those appointed to carry out its\r\nprovisions, “to determine the boundary-line between the Colony of\r\nBritish Guiana and the United States of Venezuela.”\r\n\r\nThe fact must not be overlooked that, notwithstanding this treaty\r\nwas promoted and negotiated by the officers of our Government, the\r\nparties to it were Great Britain and Venezuela. This was a fortunate\r\ncircumstance, inasmuch as the work accomplished was thus saved from\r\nthe risk of customary disfigurement at the hands of the United States\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nThe arbitrators began their labors in the city of Paris in January,\r\n1899, and made their award on the third day of October in the same year.\r\n\r\nThe line they determined upon as the boundary-line between the two\r\ncountries begins in the coast at a point considerably south and east of\r\nthe mouth of the Orinoco River, thus giving to Venezuela the absolute\r\ncontrol of that important waterway, and awarding to her valuable\r\nterritory near it. Running inland, the line is so located as to give\r\nto Venezuela quite a considerable section of territory within the\r\nSchomburgk line. This results not only in the utter denial of Great\r\nBritain’s claim to any territory lying beyond the Schomburgk line, but\r\nalso in the award to Venezuela of a part of the territory which for a\r\nlong time England had claimed to be so clearly hers that she would not\r\nconsent to submit it to arbitration.\r\n\r\nThus, we have made a laborious and patient journey through the\r\nincidents of a long dispute, to find at last a peaceful rest. As\r\nwe look back over the road we have traversed, and view again the\r\nincidents we have passed on our way, some may be surprised that this\r\ncontroversy was so long chronic, and yet, in the end, yielded so easily\r\nto pronounced treatment. I know that occasionally some Americans\r\nof a certain sort, who were quite un-American when the difficulty\r\nwas pending, have been very fond of lauding the extreme forbearance\r\nand kindness of England toward us in our so-called belligerent and\r\nill-advised assertion of American principle. Those to whom this is a\r\nsatisfaction are quite welcome to it.\r\n\r\nMy own surprise and disappointment have arisen more from the honest\r\nmisunderstanding and the dishonest and insincere misrepresentation, on\r\nthe part of many of our people, regarding the motives and purposes of\r\nthe interference of the Government of the United States in this affair.\r\nSome conceited and doggedly mistaken critics have said that it was\r\ndreadful for us to invite war for the sake of a people unworthy of our\r\nconsideration, and for the purpose of protecting their possession of\r\nland not worth possessing. It is certainly strange that any intelligent\r\ncitizen, professing information on public affairs, could fail to see\r\nthat when we aggressively interposed in this controversy it was\r\nbecause it was necessary in order to assert and vindicate a principle\r\ndistinctively American, and in the maintenance of which the people\r\nand Government of the United States were profoundly concerned. It was\r\nbecause this principle was endangered, and because those charged with\r\nadministrative responsibility would not abandon or neglect it, that our\r\nGovernment interposed to prevent any further colonization of American\r\nsoil by a European nation. In these circumstances neither the character\r\nof the people claiming the soil as against Great Britain, nor the value\r\nof the lands in dispute, was of the least consequence to us; nor did\r\nit in the least concern us which of the two contestants had the best\r\ntitle to any part of the disputed territory, so long as England did not\r\npossess and colonize more than belonged to her--however much or however\r\nlittle that might be. But we needed proof of the limits of her rights\r\nin order to determine our duty in defense of our Monroe Doctrine;\r\nand we sought to obtain such proof, and to secure peace, through\r\narbitration.\r\n\r\nBut those among us who most loudly reprehended and bewailed our\r\nvigorous assertion of the Monroe Doctrine were the timid ones who\r\nfeared personal financial loss, or those engaged in speculation\r\nand stock-gambling, in buying much beyond their ability to pay, and\r\ngenerally in living by their wits. The patriotism of such people\r\ntraverses exclusively the pocket nerve. They are willing to tolerate\r\nthe Monroe Doctrine, or any other patriotic principle, so long as it\r\ndoes not interfere with their plans, and are just as willing to cast it\r\noff when it becomes troublesome.\r\n\r\nBut these things are as nothing when weighed against the sublime\r\npatriotism and devotion to their nation’s honor exhibited by the great\r\nmass of our countrymen--the plain people of the land. Though, in case\r\nof the last extremity, the chances and suffering of conflict would have\r\nfallen to their lot, nothing blinded them to the manner in which the\r\nintegrity of their country was involved. Not for a single moment did\r\ntheir Government know the lack of their strong and stalwart support.\r\n\r\nI hope there are but few of our fellow-citizens who, in retrospect,\r\ndo not now acknowledge the good that has come to our nation through\r\nthis episode in our history. It has established the Monroe Doctrine\r\non lasting foundations before the eyes of the world; it has given us\r\na better place in the respect and consideration of the people of all\r\nnations, and especially of Great Britain; it has again confirmed\r\nour confidence in the overwhelming prevalence among our citizens of\r\ndisinterested devotion to American honor; and last, but by no means\r\nleast, it has taught us where to look in the ranks of our countrymen\r\nfor the best patriotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note:\r\n\r\nPage 101, ‘yourself, Walker, and marshal should confer’ changed to read\r\n‘yourself, Walker, and the marshal should confer’.\r\n\r\nObvious printer errors corrected silently.\r\n\r\nInconsistent spelling and hyphenation are as in the original.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Presidential Problems, by Grover Cleveland",
