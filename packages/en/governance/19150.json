W. W.'ism, it will be of special value to the workingmen of\r\nAmerica, as it will enable them easily to understand the fallacies of\r\nthe Revolutionists and at the same time make them realize the serious\r\ndangers that would result from the adoption of any of the various\r\nradical programs.\r\n\r\nFriendship, indeed, the \"Knights of the Red Flag\" profess for the\r\nlaboring man. Such friendship, however, once it is understood will be\r\nspurned, for it is one which would plunge the sons of toil into a\r\nterrible abyss of injustice, deprivation and suffering--wrongs far\r\ngreater than those endured from abuses of capitalism and partial\r\ncorruption of some government officials.\r\n\r\nAt the very beginning of this work, the author wishes to express his\r\nheartfelt sympathy for poor men and women who are treated unjustly by\r\nemployers, as well as with all who receive too small a recompense for\r\ntheir wearisome labors. It is, indeed, a source of deep regret to us\r\nthat in consequence of injustice and uncharitableness, there are to be\r\nfound in this rich republic numbers of our fellow-countrymen, not merely\r\nmen and women but even innocent little children, who can scarcely\r\nrelieve the pangs of their hunger by the coarsest kinds of food and have\r\nnaught but rags for clothes and huts for homes. Feeling deep concern for\r\nthese poor people, and for all who suffer either from employers or from\r\ndefects of government, we trust that \"The Red Conspiracy\" will not only\r\nhelp toward remedying many of the evils that now weigh heavily upon the\r\nworking class, but help to avert the far more dreadful evils that would\r\nresult from the adoption of Socialism, Bolshevism, Communism, and I. W.\r\nW.'ism.\r\n\r\nFor many years the author has made a careful study of radicalism, and\r\nduring that time has read not only many thousands of Socialist and I. W.\r\nW. papers, leaflets, pamphlets and books, but also most of the leading\r\nworks against Socialism in the English language. We have sought to\r\ngather an illuminating collection of quotations, not merely from\r\nstandard Marxian publications, but from the speeches of Socialists of\r\nunquestioned authority in the international movement. These open\r\nconfessions of the Revolutionists cannot fail to interest the reader and\r\nwill certainly arouse the deep indignation of every fair-minded person\r\nagainst a propaganda of deception which is working fast to wreck modern\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the readers of \"The Red Conspiracy\" will be interested to learn\r\nthat many of the revelations made in this book are brought to light\r\nthrough purchase by the author himself of revolutionary papers and\r\npamphlets on sale in the spring and summer of 1919 at the National\r\nHeadquarters of the Socialist Party, the Chas. H. Kerr Socialist\r\nPublishing Company, and the National Headquarters of the I. W. W., all\r\nin Chicago, and also in leading Socialist bookstores of Chicago, New\r\nYork, and Philadelphia. The matter obtained in these centres of\r\nunderworld corruption and anarchy could not have been procured had the\r\nauthor ransacked every public library in the United States.\r\n\r\nThough loyalty and patriotism should always inspire us to defend our\r\ncountry against its foes, we must concede to the Socialists that human\r\ngovernment, whether national, state or municipal, is by no means free\r\nfrom serious defects; and we are bound to admit that representatives of\r\nthe American people, as well as men engaged in business and commerce,\r\nhave too often been guilty of dishonesty, injustice and cruelty to the\r\nsuffering poor.\r\n\r\nLaw-abiding citizens, while very much regretting that wrongs such as\r\nthese should exist, confidently hope to reduce them to a reasonable\r\nminimum by methods of social reform still more effective than those that\r\nhave already brought to an end not a few of the evils prevalent in days\r\ngone by. Prudence and charity suggest to true social reformers\r\nreasonable constitutional and lawful methods by which to correct abuses\r\ninstead of adding to their number by adopting Socialism. We have already\r\nseen too much of the work of the \"Reds\" in Europe and in parts of\r\nMexico, and we do not wish to behold our fellow-countrymen shedding more\r\nblood and suffering graver evils, under Socialism, than they did during\r\nthe terrible World War.\r\n\r\nLoyal and patriotic citizens of America, judging from the progress that\r\nhas been made in the past in matters of social reform, have every reason\r\nfor looking forward confidently to the success of their efforts--unless,\r\nindeed, the Revolutionists, by greatly increasing their numbers, should\r\ndivide the workingmen of our country into two big parties, comprising,\r\nrespectively, the Socialists and the anti-Socialists, whose main purpose\r\nit would then be to fight each other instead of joining forces against\r\nsocial abuses. If the Revolutionists should gain very large numbers of\r\nrecruits, there would be, on the one hand, a great party consisting of\r\nthose whose object it would be to destroy our present form of\r\ngovernment, as well as the entire industrial system, and, on the other,\r\nan opposition party, embracing good citizens and men of common sense and\r\nintelligence, who, because of their realization of the blessings which\r\nprivately-owned industries and our constitutional form of government\r\nhave bestowed upon the people of America, would be determined to shed\r\nthe last drop of their blood in defense of them.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists, however, are not satisfied with social reform, but are\r\nbent on the total destruction of our system of government and industry,\r\nholding the system itself, rather than the faults and shortcomings of\r\nmen, to be by its very nature responsible for all the economic evils of\r\nthe day. \"Down with the Stars and Stripes\" is their cry. \"Abolish\r\nreligion and the present form of marriage.\" \"Atheism and free-love must\r\nreign supreme.\" Then, trusting that workingmen will admire anything,\r\nprovided that it be adorned in sufficiently glowing colors, they paint\r\nsuch fabulous pictures of Socialism as the following:\r\n\r\n     \"Hundreds of thousands of former representatives of the state will\r\n     enter various professions, and by their intelligence and strength\r\n     will help to increase the wealth and comfort of society. Neither\r\n     political nor common crimes will be known in the future. Thieves\r\n     will have disappeared because private property will have\r\n     disappeared, and in the new society everybody will be able to\r\n     satisfy his wants easily and conveniently by work. Nor will there\r\n     be tramps and vagabonds, for they are the product of a society\r\n     founded on private property, and with the abolition of this\r\n     institution they will cease to exist. Murder? Why? No one can\r\n     enrich himself at the expense of others, and even murder for\r\n     hatred or revenge is directly or indirectly connected with the\r\n     social system. Perjury, false testimony, fraud, theft of\r\n     inheritance, fraudulent failures? There will be no private property\r\n     against which these crimes could be committed. Arson? Who should\r\n     find satisfaction in committing arson when society has removed all\r\n     cause for hatred? Counterfeiting? Money will be but a mere chimera,\r\n     it would be love's labor lost! Blasphemy? Nonsense! It will be left\r\n     to good Almighty God himself to punish whoever has offended him,\r\n     provided that the existence of God is still a matter of\r\n     controversy.\" (\"Woman Under Socialism,\" by Bebel, page 436 of the\r\n     1910 edition in English.)\r\n\r\nAs an immense number of American citizens would not be led astray by\r\nthese foolish promises, or by others equally absurd--recalling how\r\npolitical and common crimes, theft, murder, arson, perjury, worthless\r\ncurrency, blasphemy and political corruption have ruined Socialist\r\nRussia and made it a hell on earth--a dreadful revolution would be\r\nnecessary to compel our countrymen to surrender their cherished rights.\r\nThe Socialists, if victorious, after having set up a new form of\r\ngovernment, modeled on their own low ideas of morality, would not only\r\nsubstitute a free-love regime for the present form of marriage, but,\r\ngoing still further, would avail themselves of every opportunity for\r\ndestroying religion. The evils, however, would by no means end here, for\r\nthe new government, whose rapid decay would begin from the very day of\r\nits birth, would in a short time collapse and fall, and then the\r\ncitizens of America would have neither a government to protect them from\r\nthe ravages of criminals, whose number would be legion, nor yet any\r\nsuitable system of organized industries for the employment of men and\r\nthe production of the necessaries of life. Consequently, trials and\r\nsufferings incomparably greater than any of the present day would befall\r\nthe people in the reign of anarchy that would ensue.\r\n\r\nIt is to preserve our fellow-countrymen from ever having to endure such\r\ncalamities that we have undertaken this work, in which it is proven\r\nconclusively that the \"Reds,\" unless quickly thwarted, will overwhelm us\r\nwith unspeakable horrors of crime, rebellion, anarchy and destitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION iii\r\n\r\n     Scope of Book, iii; Value to Workingmen, iii; Sympathy for Labor,\r\n     iii; Quotations from Socialist Authorities, iv; Revolutionists Set\r\n     Back the Cause of Labor, v; Bebel's Fabulous Picture of Socialist\r\n     Possibilities, v; Socialism Means War, vi.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nSOCIALISM IN OTHER LANDS                                               1\r\n\r\n     Modern Socialism Dates from \"Communist Manifesto,\" 1848, 1; Karl\r\n     Marx, 1; Engels, 1; International Workingmen's Association, 1;\r\n     \"Capital\" by Marx, the Socialist Bible, 2; Socialism in Germany, 2;\r\n     in Bavaria, 4; in Russia, 4; Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, 5;\r\n     Socialism in Austria-Hungary, 5; in France, 5; in Great Britain, 8;\r\n     in Italy, 9; in Spain, 9; in Belgium, 10; in Holland, 10; in\r\n     Bohemia, 10; in Sweden, 11; in Norway, 11; in Argentina, 11; in\r\n     Canada, 12; in Bulgaria, 12; in Mexico, 12; in Other Foreign Lands,\r\n     12.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF SOCIALISM IN THE UNITED STATES                              13\r\n\r\n     Introduced from Europe, 13; Workingmen's Party, 13; Socialist Labor\r\n     Party, 13; Socialist Democracy of America, 13; Socialist Party of\r\n     America, 13; Socialist Periodicals, 14; Socialist Party Strife and\r\n     Bossism, 14; The Internatonal, 16; The First International, 16; The\r\n     Second International, 16; International Socialist Bureau, 17;\r\n     American Socialists and the International, 17; The Berne\r\n     Conference, 18; The Third (Moscow) International, 18; Debs and\r\n     American Socialists Recognized by Lenine, 20; American Socialists'\r\n     Straddle Resolution on Berne and Moscow, 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIALIST PARTY OF AMERICA DEVELOPS A LEFT WING                   23\r\n\r\n     Revolution Camouflaged as Evolution, 23; \"Yellows,\" \"Reds,\"\r\n     \"Rights\" and \"Lefts,\" 23; Origin of the Left Wing, 24;\r\n     Revolutionary Principles of the Left Wing, 24; Sympathy with\r\n     Russian Bolshevism, 25; Industrial Unionism Advocated, 26; Mass\r\n     Action and Strikes the Prelude to Armed Rebellion, 26; \"Moderate\"\r\n     Socialism Rejected by American Revolutionists, 28; To Overthrow the\r\n     United States Government, 30; Text of Call to Moscow International,\r\n     31; American Socialist Party for \"Industrial Unionism,\" 34.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE FREE-FOR-ALL FIGHT BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND LEFT WINGS               35\r\n\r\n     Rowdies at Socialist Meetings, 35; Revolution in America \"at Hand,\"\r\n     36; \"Existence of the Party at Stake,\" 37; \"The Steering\r\n     Committee,\" 38; Hillquit Says Left Wing is Not \"Too Radical,\" 40;\r\n     \"Friendly Separation,\" 41; The Left Wing Gets More \"Dictatorship\"\r\n     Than It Wants, 42; The Rights Expel and Suspend Tens of Thousands,\r\n     42; The Socialists' \"Immortal\" Executive Committee, 42; Manifesto\r\n     of the Third (Moscow) International, 45.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nBIRTH OF THE COMMUNIST AND COMMUNIST LABOR PARTIES                    52\r\n\r\n     Left Wing Conference, 52; Left Wingers Split, 52; Call for a\r\n     Communist Convention, 53; Too Many Would-Be Lenines and Trotzkys,\r\n     54; The \"Firing Squad,\" 55; National Emergency Convention, 55; Who\r\n     Called the \"Cops\"? 57; A Convention on Each Floor, 57; The\r\n     Communist and Communist Labor Parties Organize, 57; Their\r\n     Principles, 58; \"Reds\" No Worse Than \"Yellows,\" 58; Bolshevism of\r\n     the Socialist Party, 59; Utterances at the Emergency Conference,\r\n     60; Revolutionary Character of the Socialist Party, 65;\r\n     Trachtenberg on Affiliation with Moscow International, 68;\r\n     Glassberg Letter, 69; Victor L.

After studying at Jena, Bonn, and\r\nBerlin, he became a private professor in 1841, and about a year later\r\nassumed the editorship of the \"Rhenish Gazette,\" a democratic-liberal\r\norgan of Cologne, that was soon suppressed for its radical utterances.\r\nIn 1843 he moved to Paris where he became greatly interested in the\r\nstudy of political economy and of early Socialistic writings and where\r\nhe subsequently made the acquaintance of Frederick Engels, his\r\ninseparable companion and life-long friend.\r\n\r\nEngels was born at Barmen, Rhenish Prussia, in 1820. He remained in\r\nGermany until he had completed his military service, and then moved to\r\nManchester, England, where he engaged in the cotton business with his\r\nfather. In 1884, while traveling, he met Karl Marx, and was banished\r\nwith him from France in 1847, and expelled from Belgium in 1848, the\r\nvery year that witnessed the appearance of the \"Communist Manifesto.\"\r\nNot long after this, Marx and Engels returned to Germany, and were\r\ninstrumental in fomenting a revolution in the Rhine Province in 1849.\r\nThe revolt having been suppressed in the same year, both men sought\r\nrefuge in England. Here Engels was the author of numerous German books\r\non Socialism and became best known by editing, after Marx's death, the\r\nsecond and third volumes of the latter's works.\r\n\r\nWhile in England Marx took up his abode in London where he became the\r\nfirst president of the International Workingmen's Association, whose\r\ninfluence was not limited to England, but extended to France, Germany,\r\nAustria, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Switzerland,\r\nPoland, and even the United States of America. The active career of this\r\nassociation embraced a period of about eight years, from 1864 to 1872.\r\nIts six conventions were largely devoted to the discussion of social and\r\nlabor problems and it produced a lasting effect upon the Socialist\r\nMovement by impressing upon it a harmonious and world-wide character. By\r\n1876 the International Workingmen's Association was ruined by the\r\nquarrels that had taken place between the more moderate faction under\r\nthe leadership of Marx, and the anarchistic element under Bakunin. It\r\nhad, however, by this time contributed wonderfully towards the spread of\r\nSocialism, for it had taught the working classes of Europe the\r\ninternational nature both of their own grievances and of capitalism.\r\n\r\nClosely rivaling the success of the International Workingmen's\r\nAssociation in furthering the cause of Socialism was a book known as\r\n\"Capital,\" an economic work the first volume of which was published in\r\n1867 by Karl Marx. The author never lived to edit the second and third\r\nvolumes, though after his death in London, March 14, 1883, they were\r\npublished from his notes by Frederick Engels. This work, to which the\r\nFather of the Revolutionary Movement gave the German title \"Das\r\nKapital,\" has long been known as the Bible of Socialism. Its\r\nsystematized philosophic and economic doctrines besides having supplied\r\nthe various national branches of the party with a common theory and\r\nprogram, in the main still constitute the creed of the immense majority\r\nof the Socialists the world over. Though \"Capital\" has suffered severely\r\nfrom the criticism of economists of many schools, and though not a few\r\nof its doctrines have been rejected by present-day Socialists, its\r\npowerful influence still persists to a very marked degree.\r\n\r\nSupplementing this short historical sketch of the origin of the modern\r\nSocialist movement, short comments will be added concerning the\r\nRevolutionary organization in the different countries of the world.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the Socialist movement first took shape in 1862 under the\r\ninfluence of Ferdinand Lassalle. It made comparatively slow progress\r\nuntil 1874 when the 450,000 Socialist voters returned ten members to the\r\nReichstag. An attempt on the part of the German Government to suppress\r\nthe movement failed, and henceforth the party under the leadership of\r\nAugust Bebel, Karl Kautsky, George Von Vollmar, and Wilhelm Liebknecht\r\nsteadily continued to grow in strength. Shortly before the outbreak of\r\nthe World War the Socialists, besides occupying 110 seats in the\r\nReichstag out of a total of 397, polled about 4,252,000 votes and\r\npublished 158 papers, but a faction under the leadership of Bernstein\r\nhad made great progress in its endeavors to transform the Revolutionary\r\norganization into an opportunist party.\r\n\r\nMost of the German Socialists supported the war and the majority of\r\ntheir members in the Reichstag voted for the war credits. Some, however,\r\nlike Karl Liebknecht, the son of Wilhelm Liebknecht, opposed the\r\nimperial government and were imprisoned. Pressure, however, finally\r\nforced the government to release Liebknecht, who then delivered\r\nimpassioned speeches throughout the country, stirring up the people\r\nagainst Kaiserism and the war profiteers and urging the soldiers to turn\r\ntheir weapons against the imperial government itself. While Liebknecht\r\nwas defying the authorities, the naval forces mutinied at Kiel. The\r\nSocialists then called a general strike for November 11, 1918, as a\r\nprelude to the revolution. Scheidemann and Ebert had been supporting the\r\ngovernment of Prince Max of Baden, the successor of Von Hertling, as\r\nchancellor of the empire, and had deprecated the idea of a revolution.\r\nBut when Scheidemann saw that the revolution was certainly coming and\r\nthat he and his colleagues would probably be left stranded, he joined\r\nthe movement with his powerful organization, stepped in and grasped the\r\npower. A national council of soldiers, sailors and workmen was formed at\r\nBerlin, but the provisional government was shaped by Scheidemann, Ebert\r\nand others of the majority Socialists by virtue of their excellent\r\npolitical machinery. The Ebert-Scheidemann government fought many a\r\nbitter struggle with growing radicalism. Their government represented\r\nthe most moderate group of the Socialists and received the support of\r\nthe Centerists and others because these were far more opposed to the\r\nSocialists of the extreme left, such as the Spartacan Communists.\r\nSeveral revolts engineered by the Spartacans were put down with\r\nconsiderable bloodshed. In January, 1919, soon after the defeat of the\r\nSpartacides in Berlin, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, their\r\nleaders, were put to death, and their minority party seemed to diminish\r\nin strength. In the latter part of May, 1919, the majority Socialists of\r\nthe reactionary Ebert-Scheidemann group were at first opposed to the\r\nsigning of the Treaty of Paris, whereas the Spartacans, and also the\r\nIndependent Socialists under the leadership of Hugo Haase and Karl\r\nKautsky, tried to force their opponents to sign it, so that the people\r\nof Germany might soon blame the \"reactionaries\" for the humiliation,\r\nand rise in rebellion to overthrow them.\r\n\r\nIn Bavaria the anti-war sentiment spread rapidly, fostered by the\r\nefforts of Kurt Eisner. King Ludwig abdicated the throne on November 16,\r\n1918, and Eisner took up the reins of power, forming a Socialist\r\ngovernment. After a few weeks Eisner broke with the Ebert-Scheidemann\r\ngovernment of Berlin, and soon after was assassinated. Not long after\r\nthis the Bavarian communists imposed the Soviet form of government on\r\nthe country, much to the dislike of many of the inhabitants, especially\r\nthose living outside of Munich. The peasants of Bavaria rebelled against\r\nthe communist-soviet government of Munich, which finally fell, after the\r\nNoske-Ebert-Scheidemann forces had marched against the city.\r\n\r\nVery many years ago Socialists began to spread their doctrines as best\r\nthey could in the realms of the Czar. Many a Marxian was arrested for\r\nattempting to undermine the Russian government and sent into exile in\r\nSiberia. The World War having broken out, Russia suffered terribly, and\r\nthis suffering, especially of the masses, caused great discontentment\r\nand made the people an easy prey to the revolutionary forces of\r\nSocialism. The bureaucratic Czarist regime finally broke down in March,\r\n1917, as soon as the revolution started. Three main contending parties\r\nattempted to ride into power on the revolutionary tide; the Cadets, the\r\nModerate Socialists (i.e., the Mensheviki, and Social Revolutionists)\r\nand the Bolsheviki or revolutionary Socialists. The Cadets were the\r\nfirst to gain the upper hand, but were soon swept away, for they strove\r\nto satisfy the soldiers, workers and peasants with abstract, political\r\nideals. The Mensheviki and Social Revolutionists succeeded the Cadets.\r\n\r\nThe demand for a Constitutent Assembly was one of the main aspirations\r\nof the Russian Revolution. It was on the eve of its realization that\r\nBolsheviki, in November, 1917, by a _coup d'état_ seized the reins of\r\npower. The elections for the assembly took place after the Bolsheviki\r\nhad gained the upper hand and the Bolsheviki were defeated. The\r\nConstituent Assembly was actually convened in Petrograd in January,\r\n1918, but the Bolsheviki dispersed the parliament at the point of the\r\nbayonet. Russia was then ruled by Lenine, head of the soviet system of\r\ngovernment. The government was a \"dictatorship of the proletariat,\"\r\ncharacterized by injustice, violence, oppression, and bloodshed, the\r\nSoviets being little more than tribunals of punishment and execution,\r\ninstruments of terror in the hands of the Autocrat Lenine. The\r\nBolshevist government has met with continual opposition from the\r\nopposing groups of Socialists in Russia and has been attacked by the\r\nAllies, principally on the Archangel front and in the Gulf of Finland.\r\nThe Finns, Lithuanians, Poles, Czecho-Slovaks, Rumanians, Ukranians, and\r\nespecially Admiral Kolchak's Siberian forces waged a relentless warfare\r\nagainst the Bolsheviki tyranny either for political reasons or to rescue\r\nthe countless millions of Russians who suffered so terribly from the\r\nLenine system of dictatorship. By the latter part of February, 1920, the\r\nLenine government seemed to be overcoming all military opposition.[A]\r\n\r\nThe Socialists in Austria-Hungary as far back as 1907 could count\r\n1,121,948 votes and 58 newspapers. Shortly before the end of the World\r\nWar the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy fell. Austria and Hungary separated\r\nfrom each other and each became a republic. Count Karolyi was head of\r\nthe new Hungarian government, socialistic in tendency. In the early\r\nspring of 1919, when Hungary was being invaded by Czecho-Slovak troops,\r\nItalians and Rumanians, and was threatened with an invasion from the\r\nAllies Count Karolyi fled and the government fell into the hands of the\r\nradical Socialist, Bela Kun, who soon established intimate relations\r\nwith the Bolshevist government at Moscow. One difficulty after another,\r\nhowever, especially the attacks of the Rumanians, soon taxed the\r\nstrength of the crimson-red government; and in the summer of 1919 it\r\nsuccumbed to pressure brought to bear on it by the Allies.\r\nNotwithstanding the Bolshevist propaganda carried on in Vienna, the\r\nAustrian government down to February, 1920, has resisted all inducements\r\nto adapt Bolshevism.\r\n\r\nModern Socialism in France was rather inactive previous to the outbreak\r\nof the Commune in 1871. Then, after the victory of the government forces\r\nover the revolutionists, many leaders of the Commune declared for\r\nAnarchism, but subsequently abandoned it as impracticable and devoted\r\nthemselves to the propaganda of Marxian Socialism. After Jules Guesde\r\nand other communards were permitted to return to France, by the amnesty\r\nof 1879, the party at first developed considerable strength, but soon\r\nsplit up into several factions, with Guesde as the leader of the more\r\nradical wing and Jaurés and Millerand at the head of the moderate\r\nparliamentarian group. In the election of May, 1914, the United\r\nSocialists under Jaurés polled 1,357,192 votes, while the Radical\r\nSocialists and their allies in the Caillaux combination cast 2,227,176\r\nvotes. During the World War most of the Socialists, especially those in\r\nparliament, supported the government.\r\n\r\nAfter the War the Longuet faction of the Socialist Party became the\r\nmajority party, took over control of the great Paris Socialist daily\r\nL'Humanité and chose Cashin as editor. On April 6, 1919, a great\r\ndemonstration took place in Paris in honor of Jaurés, the Socialist\r\nleader of France, who had been assassinated at the beginning of the\r\nWorld War. This and the decisions taken at the Socialist party congress\r\nof the Federation of the Seine on March 13th, demonstrated the decided\r\nturn to the left that the Socialist Party had taken since its previous\r\ncongress in October, 1918. In the demonstration, consisting, perhaps, of\r\n50,000 Socialists, cries of \"Revolution!\" \"Down with the War!\" \"Down\r\nwith Clemenceau!\" \"Long live the Soviet!\" and \"Long live Russia!\" filled\r\nthe air for three hours.\r\n\r\n\"The Call,\" New York, May 19, 1919, thus comments:\r\n\r\n     \"The Socialist papers for several days appeared uncensored, though\r\n     every line breathed revolution. Most startling of all, there were\r\n     as many soldiers as civilians marching.\r\n\r\n     \"Seven days later the representatives of each Socialist local in\r\n     the Department of the Seine met in convention to decide upon which\r\n     of three resolutions they should recommend the coming national\r\n     congress of the Socialist Party to adopt. The discussion was hot,\r\n     and more or less revolved around the personalities of the three\r\n     leaders, Albert Thomas, Right Socialist, Jean Longuet, Left\r\n     Socialist, and F. Loriot, Communist or Bolshevist. Broadly\r\n     speaking, the Thomas resolution based its faith upon present\r\n     political action and future political power; the Longuet resolution\r\n     advocated a third International, without indorsing the third\r\n     International held in Moscow in March, and the Loriot resolution\r\n     indorsed the Zimmerwald resolutions (against all wars) and\r\n     recognized the existence of the Third International established by\r\n     the Russian Bolshevik party.\r\n\r\n     \"Most of the discussion hinged upon affairs in Russia with hoots of\r\n     derision at every uncomplimentary mention of Bolshevism, until the\r\n     speaker either had to take his seat or qualify his criticism of the\r\n     Soviet republic.\r\n\r\n     \"Both the Longuet and Loriot resolutions called the war the\r\n     consequence of imperialistic anarchy and bourgeois ambition, both\r\n     denounced the imposition upon Germany of an unjust, or Bismarckian,\r\n     peace, such as was imposed upon France in 1871, and both mourned\r\n     the assassination of Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, and Kurt\r\n     Eisner.\r\n\r\n     \"The Longuet resolution was as strong in its declaration of\r\n     solidarity with the Soviet republic of Russia as the Loriot\r\n     resolution was in opposition to all annexation of the Sarre Valley\r\n     by France.\"\r\n\r\nThe National Congress of the Socialist parties of France was held from\r\nApril 19 until April 22, 1919. A motion by M. Kienthaliens demanding the\r\nadhesion of French Socialists to the Internationale at Moscow, under the\r\nleadership of Premier Lenin of the Bolshevist government polled only 270\r\nvotes. This resolution failed to pass probably because the Longuet\r\nmajority faction desired the union of all the French Socialist parties.\r\nThe Congress adopted by a majority of 894 votes, a resolution offered by\r\nJean Longuet to the effect that the French Socialists are willing to\r\ncontinue to form a part of the Second Internationale, provided that all\r\nthose who are Socialists in name only shall be excluded.\r\n\r\nOn May Day, 1919, the Socialists manoeuvered a general strike of all\r\nlabor in Paris for twenty-four hours. The press dispatches informed us\r\nthat the shut-down was virtually complete. Not a wheel was turning on\r\nany of the transportation systems and taxicabs and omnibuses kept off\r\nthe streets. All restaurants and cafés were closed and guests in the\r\nhotels went hungry if they had not supplied themselves with food\r\nbeforehand. Even the drug stores closed.\r\n\r\nTheatres, music halls, and other resorts did not open. No newspapers\r\nwere published and periodic stoppages occurred in the postal and wire\r\nservices throughout the day. Industry on all sides was in a state of\r\ncomplete inactivity, work being suspended by every class of labor. There\r\nwas considerable disorder and very many policemen and civilians were\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\nIn the elections of November, 1919, the Socialist vote increased to\r\n1,750,000, a gain of 40 per cent over that of 1914. On the 1914 basis of\r\nrepresentation this would have given them 160 seats in the Chamber of\r\nDeputies; but their representation was actually reduced from 105 to 55,\r\ndue to a new basis of representation and a new formation of districts.\r\n\r\nThe French Syndicalists, of the Labor Confederation, had 600,000 members\r\nbefore the war and now claim 1,500,000. They were quiescent during the\r\nwar, but their congresses of July, 1918, and September, 1919, showed a\r\n\"tendency to return to the traditional revolutionary policy of French\r\nSyndicalism.\"\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain it was not until 1884, when the Social Democratic\r\nFederation was organized by Henry M. Hyndman, that the Marxian movement\r\ndisplayed any notable activity. Its progress at first was extremely\r\nslow, but after the Independent Labor Party was formed in 1893 under the\r\nleadership of J. Keir Hardie with a view to carrying Socialism into\r\npolitics, the revolutionary doctrines spread much more rapidly, \"The\r\nClarion\" and \"Labor Advocate,\" the two organs of the Independent Labor\r\nParty, helping wonderfully in the work. In 1883 the Fabian Society, an\r\norganization Socialistic in name and tendencies, was founded by a group\r\nof middle class students. It rejected the Marxian economies, and by\r\nmeans of lectures, pamphlets, and books advocated practical measures of\r\nsocial reform. Among the leading English Socialists of the more radical\r\ntype have been Hyndman, Aveling, Blatchford, Bax, Quelch, Leathan and\r\nMorris; while Shaw, Pease and Webb were the leading members of the\r\nmoderate Fabian Society.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of English Socialists supported the government in the\r\nWorld War, but the Labor Party, mostly Socialistic, during that time\r\nengineered great strikes of the coal miners, dock workers and railroad\r\nmen. A press despatch dated London, April 21, 1919, says:\r\n\r\n     \"The first gun in the long advertised campaign of Bolshevism in\r\n     Britain was fired at Sheffield, where the British Socialists'\r\n     annual convention, at its opening session passed a resolution\r\n     urging the establishment of a British soviet government.\r\n\r\n     \"The resolution expresses all admiration for the workings of the\r\n     soviet system in Hungary and Bavaria. It declares war on the\r\n     'capitalist' system in Britain, attacks the policy of the peace\r\n     conference toward Russia and favors the distribution of\r\n     revolutionary propaganda in the British army and navy.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the summer and fall of 1919, Socialist and Bolshevist principles\r\ncontinued to gain an ever-increasing and very serious hold on the people\r\nof England and proved a serious menace to the government in the general\r\nrailway strike in October.\r\n\r\nIn Italy Socialism has been making steady progress for many years and\r\nsince the end of the World War has increased wonderfully in strength.\r\nThe party has greatly profited by the suffering and discontent due to\r\nthe war and especially by the failure of Italy to secure coveted\r\nterritory after all her sacrifices and the victory of the Allies. On\r\nApril 10, 1919, the Italian Socialists manoeuvered a very successful\r\ngeneral strike in Rome, but were prevented by the government forces from\r\nmarching through the streets in any considerable numbers. About the same\r\ntime disturbances were also engineered in many cities and towns of the\r\ncountry, especially in Florence[3] and Milan. In the latter part of\r\nApril, 1919, the Executive Committee of the Socialist party of Italy\r\nresolved to sever its connection with the International Socialist Bureau\r\nand the Berne Conference, in which there were many reactionary\r\nSocialists, and to affiliate with the newly established Moscow\r\nInternational, consisting of the various National groups of Socialists\r\ngiving whole-hearted support to Lenine and the Bolsheviki.\r\n\r\nOn July 21, 1919, Italian Socialists conducted a general strike against\r\nthe Russian blockade. Industrial prostration resulted in whole provinces\r\nstopping all traffic and communication while Soviets were set up in 240\r\ntowns and cities, including Genoa and Florence. In the November, 1919,\r\nelections the Socialists secured 159 Deputies in the Chamber, having had\r\n44 previously. They cast over one-third of all votes cast, about\r\n3,000,000, as against 883,409 in 1913.\r\n\r\nThe membership of the Italian labor unions is now estimated at\r\n1,000,000, an increase of about 300,000 since 1917. At a national\r\nconference, in April, 1919, the labor unions demanded a change of the\r\nnational Parliament into a national Soviet.\r\n\r\nIn Spain, especially in the big cities and notably in Barcelona,\r\nSocialism has made steady progress and the Marxians have taken part in\r\nseveral upheavals. In the early part of 1919 the eleventh national\r\nCongress, which met at Madrid, elected Pablo Iglesias president of the\r\nExecutive Committee and adopted aggressive measures for extending\r\nSocialist propaganda, especially into the rural districts, and for\r\nestablishing Socialist day schools and women's evening schools. The\r\nofficial organ of the party, \"El Socialista,\" came in for a round of\r\ncriticism because of its espousal of the Allied cause to the detriment,\r\nit was charged, of the International principles to which it should have\r\nadhered.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of April, 1913, the Belgian Socialists, under the\r\nleadership of Emil Vandervelde attracted the attention of the world by\r\nattempting to paralyze the entire industrial system of the country by a\r\ngeneral strike. Shortly before the outbreak of the World War, Belgium,\r\nwith its comparatively small population, had about half a million\r\nSocialist voters, constituting approximately half of the electorate of\r\nthe country. During the war the Socialists supported the government and\r\nsince the war down to the early fall of 1919 have not caused any serious\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nOn November 16, 1919, the Socialist vote rose to 644,499, with election\r\nof 70 Deputies and 20 Senators, an increase of 21 Deputies and 5\r\nSenators.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1919, out of the 100 members of the Second Chamber of Holland,\r\nthere were four Communists or Socialists of the extreme left and 20 of\r\nmore moderate tendencies. The Communists published a newspaper called\r\n\"The Bolshevist\" and maintained relations with the Russian Soviet\r\nGovernment and the German Sparticides. David Wynkoop, the leader of the\r\nDutch Communists, is called \"Holland's Little Liebknecht\" and in a\r\nparliamentary speech openly threatened a general strike. There was a\r\nBolshevist crisis in January, 1919. An assembly of international\r\ncommunists met at the Hague and Spartacide success in Germany was the\r\nonly thing required to launch a revolutionary attempt, accompanied by a\r\ngeneral strike and terrorism. The government then adopted stern\r\nmeasures. Civil guards were formed, and banks, newspaper offices and\r\npolice bureaus were occupied by the military with machine guns, the\r\nbanks and newspapers having been previously equipped with wireless\r\nagainst the cutting of telephone wires.\r\n\r\nWynkoop, in the company of workingmen, visited soldiers in their\r\nbarracks asking them to join the movement, but the soldiers fired,\r\nkilling three and wounding several. Efforts to corrupt the cavalry and\r\nthe navy by similar means were not a success.\r\n\r\nShortly after the overthrow of the Austro-Hungarian Government, the\r\nthree Socialist parties of Czecho-Slovakia, which had been divided\r\nprincipally over questions of nationality, got together and their\r\nleaders of moderate tendencies were very sanguine over the outlook for a\r\ngeneral victory at the ballot box in the near future. It appears,\r\nhowever, that the party was afterwards split into pro and anti\r\nBolshevist factions, with a consequent decrease in political strength.\r\n\r\nIn speeches made by several leaders at the Bohemian Socialist conference\r\nat Prague in the early part of April, 1919, it was decided that the\r\nalliance with the Entente should be maintained because reconciliation\r\nwith Berlin, Budapest and Moscow would mean danger for the Czecho-Slovak\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\nBolshevism was described as the suicide of the proletariat, and it was\r\nurged that the working people of Bohemia should differentiate between\r\nexaggeration and methodic reform.\r\n\r\nIn Prague, Pressburg and other cities troops clashed with the Communists\r\nand Social Democrats. On March 7, 1919, at a mass meeting addressed by\r\nthree leading agitators from Prague, 40,000 workers, mostly miners,\r\ncheered assertions that the revolution of October 28, 1918, had not\r\nturned out well for the proletariat which was still being oppressed;\r\nthat the Government of Prague was as weak as under the old Austrian\r\nregime.\r\n\r\nSocialism, in recent years, has made considerable progress in Sweden.\r\nThe majority of the Marxians seems to be of the moderate group, though\r\nthe Left Socialist Party assisted the Lenine Government of Russia.\r\nHjalmar Branting, the leader of the Moderate Socialists, addressing the\r\nFrench Socialist Congress in the Spring of 1919, bitterly assailed\r\nBolshevism and issued a warning against it. Branting's Social-Democratic\r\nLabor Party has 86 seats in Parliament, while the radicals, who seceded\r\nto form the Socialist Party in 1917, have 12 seats. In this convention,\r\nin June, 1919, the Socialist Party voted to join the Third (Moscow)\r\nInternational, declared for the principle of the dictatorship of the\r\nproletariat, voted for \"mass action\" as the means of conquest and a\r\nSoviet organization of the workers.\r\n\r\nIn the Socialist party of Norway the Bolshevist faction appears to be in\r\ncontrol. After the revolution in Germany in the latter part of 1918, the\r\nNorwegian Socialists, in speeches and articles urged the laborers to\r\norganize revolutionary organizations similar to those in soviet Russia,\r\nprovide themselves with arms and be ready for a revolutionary uprising\r\nto overthrow the government. The party congress in 1919 joined the Third\r\n(Moscow) International and adopted \"mass action\" as tactics and\r\npreparation for a general strike.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists were very active in Argentina after the ending of the\r\nWorld War and were the back-bone of the serious and prolonged\r\ndisturbances in Buenos Aires. In the latter part of April, 1919, the\r\nPan-American Socialist Conference was held in the Argentine capital. Its\r\npurpose was to promote the amalgamation of all the Socialist and labor\r\norganizations of the Western Hemisphere into one body. In South America\r\nSocialism is best organized in Argentine, Chile and Peru, and weakest in\r\nBrazil and Colombia.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, at least till the summer of 1919, the Marxian forces were\r\ngaining in strength daily. This was especially true of the western part\r\nof the Dominion, where the radical industrial union, generally called in\r\nCanada the \"One Big Union,\" has become very influential. Serious strikes\r\nwith Bolshevist tendencies took place throughout the Dominion,\r\nespecially in Winnipeg in the spring of 1919.\r\n\r\nBulgaria has two Socialist parties, the Moderates and the Communist\r\nParty, the latter affiliated with the Third (Moscow) International. In\r\nthe August, 1919, election the Moderate Socialist members in the\r\n\"Sobranie\" or Chamber of Deputies decreased from 46 to 39, while the\r\nCommunists increased their Deputies from 10 to 47.\r\n\r\nMexico, on our southern border, has added \"industrial unionism\" to her\r\nSocialist movement. At the Socialist Party convention in the fall of\r\n1919 a part of the organization seceded and reorganized as the Communist\r\nParty.\r\n\r\nBesides the many millions of Socialists in the countries already\r\nreferred to, the Marxians are well organized and are making rapid\r\nstrides in Serbia, Denmark, Greece, Switzerland, the Balkan States,\r\nAustralia, New Zealand and even in South Africa and far distant Japan\r\nand China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF SOCIALISM IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSocialism was introduced into the United States about the year 1850 by\r\nimmigrants who landed on our shores from Europe. The Marxians, who came\r\nfrom Germany, were principally responsible for the foundation of the\r\nWorkingmen's Party in 1876, which in 1877 was called the Socialistic\r\nLabor Party, and, a few years later, the Socialist Labor Party, which\r\nwas reorganized at Chicago in 1889, after having lost two sections by\r\nsecession. One of these, called the Cincinnati Socialist Labor Party, in\r\n1897 united with the Social Democracy of America, a combination of\r\nrailroad men, followers of Eugene V. Debs, and of the populist followers\r\nof Victor L. Berger. The other seceders from the Socialist Labor Party,\r\ncalled the \"kangaroos,\" united with the Social Democracy of Debs and\r\nBerger in 1900, the new combination then calling itself the Socialist\r\nParty of America. The minority of the old Socialist Labor Party, which\r\nrefused to be amalgamated with the Social Democracy of America, is still\r\nknown as the Socialist Labor Party; hence, since the year 1900, there\r\nhave been two distinct revolutionary parties, the Socialist Party and\r\nthe Socialist Labor Party.\r\n\r\nThe former, under the leadership of Eugene V. Debs, Victor L. Berger and\r\nMorris Hillquit, with 109,586 dues-paying members in January, 1919, is\r\nby far the more powerful and influential, having steadily increased its\r\nvote to about 900,000 in the Presidential election of 1912, though in\r\nthe year 1916 the vote dropped to less than 600,000. The Socialist Labor\r\nParty, under the guidance of Daniel De Leon until his death, in May,\r\n1914, seems to be making little if any progress. Though both parties\r\nclaim to be genuinely Socialistic and Marxian, each has decried the\r\nother as being a \"fake\" or \"bogus\" party. The Socialist Labor Party's\r\nmain complaint is that its rival the Socialist Party is sacrificing the\r\nprinciples of Karl Marx in its endeavor to gain votes, while, on the\r\nother hand, the latter party retorts by stigmatizing its opponent as\r\nbeing a party of \"scabs,\" the sole purpose of whose existence is to\r\nantagonize the Socialist Party. In recent years unsuccessful attempts\r\nhave been made to unite the two.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Party, besides publishing two important dailies in\r\nEnglish, \"The Call,\" of New York City, and the \"Milwaukee Leader,\"\r\nissues at least two in German, two in Bohemian, one in Polish and one in\r\nYiddish. \"Forward,\" the Jewish paper published in New York City in\r\nYiddish, had a daily circulation[4] of over 150,000, according to a\r\nreport in \"The Call\" April 6, 1919. Foremost for many years among the\r\nSocialist weeklies in English was the \"Appeal to Reason,\" which was once\r\nextremely bitter and unrelenting in its attacks on the United States\r\nGovernment. Published at Girard, Kansas, its circulation reached nearly\r\n1,000,000 copies a week during the fall of 1912, but since 1917 it has\r\nfallen into great disfavor among most Socialists because of its pro-war\r\nand moderate tendencies. In addition to the Socialist papers already\r\nreferred to, there are in our country hundreds of others in English,\r\nGerman, Bohemian, Polish, Jewish, Slovac, Slavonic, Danish, Italian,\r\nFinnish, French, Hungarian, Lettish, Norwegian, Croatian, Russian, and\r\nSwedish. In a report to Congress in 1919, the Attorney-General of the\r\nUnited States stated that there were 416 radical newspapers in America.\r\n\r\nA strong impression that serious party strife and bossism prevail in the\r\nSocialist organization is gained by those who read the Marxian papers\r\nand magazines. William English Walling, for example, in the\r\n\"International Socialist Review,\" Chicago, April, 1913, showed his\r\nsympathy with the so-called \"reds,\" who then comprised the radical I. W.\r\nW. wing of the party, and at the same time attacked the \"yellows,\" the\r\nadvocates of political action.\r\n\r\n\"Ever since the Socialist Party was formed,\" he wrote, \"the party\r\noffice-holders have been spending the larger part of their energies in\r\nendeavoring to hold their jobs and to fight down every element in the\r\nparty that demanded any improvement or advance in any direction....\r\n\r\n\"A far greater danger is the new one, that has become serious only since\r\nwe entered upon the present period of political success two years ago,\r\nnamely the corruption of the party by those elected to public office....\r\n\r\n\"Only last year we had several mayors in the one state of Ohio either\r\nbeing forced to resign or deserting the party because they could not use\r\nit for their purpose....\r\n\r\n\"Next year we may elect a few congressmen and half a hundred\r\nlegislators--if the reactionaries in the party will cease their\r\nunderhand efforts to disrupt the organization and drive out the\r\nrevolutionists....\r\n\r\n\"If then these office-holders continue to show the tendency towards\r\nbossism so common in the past, the Socialist Party will soon become an\r\noffice-holders' machine, little different in character from the machine\r\nby which Gompers controls the Federation of Labor, or Murphy, Tammany\r\nHall....\r\n\r\n\"The only possible way to avoid a split so openly and shamelessly\r\nadvocated by some of the opportunist leaders of our party--Berger even\r\nthreatened it in the last National Convention--is to have the system of\r\nproportional representation....\r\n\r\n\"Unless some such changes as these are made in the next four years, it\r\ndoes not take a prophet to see that there would be nothing left of what\r\nwe now know as the Socialist Party. If we cannot control our own petty\r\nautocrats, how can we ever hope to control the infinitely more powerful\r\nand resourceful autocrats of the Capitalist system?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Communist,\" formerly the Left Wing organ of the Chicago Socialists,\r\nin its edition of April 1, 1919, bitterly assails Victor L. Berger of\r\nthe Right Wing:\r\n\r\n     \"A vote for Berger is a vote of pitying contempt for our Bolsheviki\r\n     and Spartacan comrades. A vote for Berger is a vote approving his\r\n     repeated and uncalled-for condemnation of our class-war comrades of\r\n     the I. W. W.--condemnation persistently offered to prove Berger's\r\n     own eminent respectability. A vote for Berger is a vote of scoffery\r\n     against the St. Louis platform--a vote of apology for the platform,\r\n     dissipation of its meaning, and disavowal of its essential spirit.\r\n     A vote for Berger is a vote for the International of German\r\n     Majority Socialism. A vote for Berger is a vote for petty bourgeois\r\n     progressivism as the essence of Socialism; it is a vote against\r\n     identification of the Socialist Party with the revolutionary mass\r\n     aspirations. A vote for Berger is a betrayal of all the efforts,\r\n     sacrifices and dreams of those whose lives have gone into the\r\n     socialist movement as torch-bearers of proletarian triumph over\r\n     capitalist exploitation, from Marx to the humblest comrade fighting\r\n     today in the ranks of the revolutionary class struggle.\r\n\r\n     \"As far as this election is concerned there is nothing to be\r\n     considered about Victor Berger, past and present, except the ideal\r\n     Socialism which has become unchangeably attached to his name. If\r\n     the American Socialist Party is to be a party of Berger-Socialism,\r\n     then indeed, the Socialist movement will not die in America. No, it\r\n     is the Socialist Party that will die.\"\r\n\r\nAs we shall see presently, these prophecies of disruption were soon\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the Socialist organizations of the different\r\ncountries of the world have from the time of Karl Marx met together at\r\nmore or less regular intervals, being banded together in what is called\r\nthe \"International.\"\r\n\r\nThe official organ of the National Office, Socialist Party, \"The Eye\r\nOpener,\" in its issue of February, 1919, gives a detailed explanation of\r\nthe \"International\":\r\n\r\n     \"It is an organization of Socialist Parties and labor\r\n     organizations, meeting periodically in international conferences.\r\n     In order to be eligible for membership, an organisation must meet\r\n     the following test, adopted by the International Congress of Paris,\r\n     1900.\r\n\r\n     \"Those admitted to the International Socialist Congresses are:\r\n\r\n     \"1. All associations which adhere to the essential principles of\r\n     Socialism; namely, Socialization of the means of production and\r\n     exchange, international union, and action of the workers, conquest\r\n     of public power by the proletariat, organized as a class party.\r\n\r\n     \"2. All the labor organizations which accept the principles of the\r\n     class struggle and recognize the necessity of political action,\r\n     legislative and parliamentary but do not participate directly in\r\n     the political movement.\r\n\r\n     \"This definition includes every Socialist Party and propaganda\r\n     organization in the world and it further takes in those enlightened\r\n     unions that recognize the need for political action. It excludes\r\n     conservative unions that do not yet admit the soundness of the\r\n     principles of the class struggle.\"\r\n\r\nThe First International was thoroughly Marxian and revolutionary.\r\nAccording to \"The Revolutionary Age,\" April 12, 1919, it accepted the\r\nrevolutionary struggle against capitalism and waged that struggle with\r\nall the means in its power. It considered its objective to be the\r\nconquest of power by the revolutionary proletariat, the annihilation of\r\nthe bourgeois state, and the introduction of a new proletarian state,\r\nfunctioning temporarily as a dictatorship of the proletariat. The First\r\nInternational collapsed after the Franco-Prussian War.\r\n\r\nThe Second International was formed at Paris in the year 1889. Its\r\ntendencies were much more moderate than those of its predecessor. \"The\r\nRevolutionary Age,\" April 12, 1919, criticises it for being\r\n\"conservative and petty bourgeois in spirit,\" and states that \"it was\r\npart and parcel of the national liberal movement, not at all\r\nrevolutionary, dominated by the conservative skilled elements of the\r\nworking class and the small bourgeoisie. It was hesitant and\r\ncompromising, expressing the demands of the 'petite bourgeoisie' for\r\ngovernment ownership, reforms, etc.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1900 an International Socialist Bureau was established at Brussels\r\nfor the purpose of solidifying and strengthening the work of the Second\r\nInternational and for maintaining uninterrupted relations between the\r\nvarious national organizations.\r\n\r\nThat the American Socialists were closely united with the Marxians the\r\nworld over during the Second International, which continued till the\r\nWorld War, was especially evident from the fact that representatives\r\nfrom the United States met abroad in the international congresses every\r\nthree years to discuss party policies. Far from denying the\r\ninternational character of the whole movement, the Revolutionists of the\r\nUnited States have ever rejoiced and gloried in it, trusting that it\r\nwould result in the rapid spread of their doctrines and the ultimate\r\nvictory of their cause. In confirmation of the intimate union existing\r\nbetween American and foreign Socialists, during the time of the second\r\nInternational, we have the declaration of the Socialist Party of the\r\nUnited States in its national platform of 1904, pledging itself to the\r\nprinciples of International Socialism, as embodied in the united thought\r\nand action of the Socialists of all nations. Moreover, Morris Hillquit\r\ninformed us in \"The Worker,\" March 23, 1907, that the International\r\nSocialist Movement, with its thirty million adherents and its organized\r\nparties in about twenty-five civilized countries in both hemispheres,\r\nwas everywhere based on the same Marxian program and followed\r\nsubstantially the same methods of propaganda and action. Writing again,\r\nin \"Everybody's,\" October, 1913, Hillquit declared that the dominant\r\nSocialist organizations of all countries were organically allied with\r\none another, that by means of an International Socialist Bureau,\r\nsupported at joint expense, the Socialist parties of the world\r\nmaintained uninterrupted relations with one another, and that every\r\nthree years they met in international conventions, whose conclusions\r\nwere accepted by all constituent[5] national organizations.\r\n\r\nCommenting upon \"The Collapse of the Second International,\" which is\r\nheld to have taken place at the beginning of the World War, \"The\r\nRevolutionary Age,\" March 22, 1919, says:\r\n\r\n     \"Great demonstrations were held in every European country by\r\n     Socialists protesting against their government's declarations of\r\n     war, and mobilizations for war. And we know that these\r\n     demonstrations were rendered impotent by the complete surrender of\r\n     the Socialist parliamentary leaders and the official Socialist\r\n     press, with their 'justification' of 'defensive wars' and the\r\n     safeguarding of 'democracy.'\r\n\r\n     \"Why the sudden change of front? Why did the Socialist leaders in\r\n     the parliaments of the belligerents vote the war credits? Why did\r\n     not Moderate Socialism carry out the policy of the Basle Manifesto,\r\n     namely; the converting of an imperialistic war into a civil\r\n     war--into a proletarian revolution? Why did it either openly favor\r\n     the war or adopt a policy of petty-bourgeois pacifism?\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the World War Socialists and representatives of\r\nlabor from many countries met at Berne, Switzerland, in what was known\r\nas the Berne Conference. This international Socialist conference was\r\ncomparatively moderate in tendencies, while another Socialist congress,\r\nheld shortly before it in Bolshevist Moscow, was far more radical.\r\n\r\nJ. Ramsay MacDonald, commenting upon the Berne Conference in \"Glasgow\r\nForward,\" in the spring of 1919, said:\r\n\r\n     \"It declined to condemn the Bolshevists and declined to say that\r\n     their revolution was Socialism....\r\n\r\n     \"Moscow seems to be more thorough than Berne, though as a matter of\r\n     fact Berne was far more thorough than Moscow. There is a glamour\r\n     and a halo about Moscow; but there are substance and permanence\r\n     about Berne.\r\n\r\n     \"That blessed word 'Soviet' has become a shibboleth. But Berne did\r\n     not say anything about it. It declared its continuing belief in\r\n     democracy and in representative institutions. I hope that the\r\n     Soviet is not contrary to democracy; I know that it is a\r\n     representative institution. But I know more. I know that beyond its\r\n     primary stage it is a system of indirect representation--the\r\n     representation of representatives--and that a few years ago there\r\n     was not a single Socialist in the country that would have accepted\r\n     such a form of representative government. For Socialists to pretend\r\n     to prefer that system to one of direct responsibility is a mere\r\n     pose.\r\n\r\n     \"Therefore, two Internationals will be the worst thing that could\r\n     happen to the revolutions now going on and to the general\r\n     Socialist movement. The duty of every Socialist--especially of\r\n     those of us who are not in revolution--is to strive by might and by\r\n     main to get a union of the two. We may have to suffer a time of\r\n     internal trouble owing to the friction of conflicting conceptions\r\n     of Socialist reconstruction, but I am quite certain that no one has\r\n     yet said what is to be the last word on the subject, and to split\r\n     on such a controversy as this is to advertise to the world how\r\n     unready Socialism is to assume command.\"\r\n\r\nThe Berne Conference, which had at first been called to meet at\r\nLausanne, the Russian Bolshevik government of Lenine denounced in a\r\nmanifesto which the \"Chicago Socialist\" of February 8, 1919, republished\r\nin part as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The Central Committee of the Russian Communist Bolshevik Party in\r\n     a manifesto on the proposal to call together an International\r\n     Conference at Lausanne, declares that the project cannot be\r\n     considered even as an attempt to revive the Second International.\r\n     The latter ceased to exist during the first days of August, 1914,\r\n     when the representatives of the majority of nearly all the\r\n     Socialist parties passed over into the ranks of their imperialist\r\n     governments.\r\n\r\n     \"The attempts made to revive this International, for which\r\n     agitation has been carried on in all countries throughout the war,\r\n     emanated from elements standing mid-way, which, whilst not\r\n     recognizing openly Imperialist Socialism, nevertheless had no idea\r\n     of creating a third revolutionary International.\r\n\r\n     \"The attempts made to go back to the pre-war situation regarding\r\n     the labor movement crashed against the Imperialist policy of the\r\n     official parties, which could not, at that time, admit the\r\n     appearance of an attempt to restore the International, fearing, as\r\n     they did, that this might tend to weaken the war policy of the\r\n     government and the working class working in unison.\r\n\r\n     \"To counteract these attempts, the Imperialist Socialist parties\r\n     undertook to change the conditions of representation of the\r\n     national sections in the old International. The last so-called\r\n     inter-Allied conference in the Entente countries made it clear that\r\n     this change had been effected.\r\n\r\n     \"Great Britain was represented by a motley organization in which\r\n     the Socialist parties could play no direct role. Italy was\r\n     represented by men whose party never before belonged to the\r\n     International and whose presence compelled the absence of the\r\n     official Italian Socialist Party. America was represented by\r\n     Gompers, representing associations which never had anything to do\r\n     with the Socialists....\r\n\r\n     \"As against the International of traitors and\r\n     counter-revolutionaries, organizing themselves for the purpose of\r\n     forming leagues against the proletarian revolutions the world over,\r\n     the Communists of all countries must rapidly close their ranks\r\n     around the third revolutionary International--already, in fact,\r\n     existing.\r\n\r\n     \"This Third International has nothing in common with the avowed\r\n     Socialist Imperialists, or with the pseudo-revolutionary\r\n     Socialists, who in reality support the former when they refuse to\r\n     break with them, and who do not recoil against participation in the\r\n     conferences of falsely called Socialists. The Russian Communist\r\n     Bolshevik Party refuses to take part in these conferences, which\r\n     abuse the name of Socialism. It invites all those who desire that\r\n     the Third Revolutionary International shall live to take the same\r\n     line; the task of this Third International being to hasten the\r\n     conquest of power by the working class.\r\n\r\n     \"The Communist parties of Finland, Esthonia, Lithuania, of White\r\n     Russia, the Ukraine, Poland, and Holland are at one with the\r\n     Russian Communist Party.\r\n\r\n     \"The latter also regards as its associates the Spartacus group in\r\n     Germany, the Communist Party of German Austria and other\r\n     revolutionary proletarian elements of the countries in the old\r\n     Austro-Hungarian Empire; the Left Social Democrats of Sweden, the\r\n     Revolutionary Social Democracy of Switzerland and Italy, the\r\n     followers of Maclean in England, of Debs in America, of Loriot in\r\n     France. In their persons the Third International, which is at the\r\n     head of the World Revolution, already exists.\r\n\r\n     \"At the present moment when the Socialist Imperialists of the\r\n     Entente who formerly hurled the most violent accusations against\r\n     Scheidemann, are about to unite with him and to break the power of\r\n     Socialism in all countries, the Communist Party considers that\r\n     unity for the World Revolution is an indispensable condition for\r\n     its success.\r\n\r\n     \"Its most dangerous enemy now is the Yellow International of the\r\n     Socialist traitors--thanks to whom capitalism still succeeds in\r\n     keeping a considerable portion of the working class under its\r\n     influence.\r\n\r\n     \"For the conquest of power by the workers let us carry on an\r\n     implacable struggle against those who are deceiving them--against\r\n     the pseudo-Socialist traitors.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of May, 1919, the National Executive Committee of the\r\nSocialist Party of the United States, probably on account of pressure\r\nbrought to bear on it by the \"Left Wing,\" stated that the party\r\nrepudiated the Berne Conference, but, at the same time, was _not yet_\r\naffiliated with the Communist Conference of the Bolshevists at Moscow.\r\nThe phraseology of this ambiguous announcement is here given:\r\n\r\n     \"It recognizes the necessity of reorganizing the Socialist\r\n     International along more harmonious and radical lines. The\r\n     Socialist Party of the United States is not committed to the Berne\r\n     Conference, which has shown itself retrograde on many vital points,\r\n     and totally devoid of creative force. On account of the isolation\r\n     of Russia, and the misunderstanding arising therefrom, it also is\r\n     not affiliated with the Communist Congress of Moscow.\"\r\n\r\nThis awkward straddle is explained by the fact that the American\r\nSocialist Party, under the pro-German leadership of Morris Hillquit of\r\nNew York and Victor L. Berger of Milwaukee, had in its Congressional\r\nplatform for 1918 expressly endorsed the Inter-Allied Socialist and\r\nLabor Conference, held at London that year. This is the conference which\r\nthe Lenine government scoffs at in the manifesto quoted just above,\r\nstyling it the \"so-called inter-allied conference,\" in which \"America\r\nwas represented by Gompers, representing associations which never had\r\nanything to do with the Socialists.\" That the American Socialist Party\r\nhad been led into the endorsement of the conference by Berger and\r\nHillquit because the conference had recommended a meeting with German\r\nworkingmen seems evident from the wording of the endorsement, taken from\r\nthe official publication of the Socialist Party's 1918 Congressional\r\nPlatform, pages 3-4:\r\n\r\n     \"In all that concerns the settlement of this war, the American\r\n     Socialist Party is in general accord with the announced aims of the\r\n     Inter-Allied Conference. We re-affirm the principles announced by\r\n     the Socialist Party in the United States in 1915; adopted by the\r\n     Socialist Republic of Russia in 1917; proclaimed by the\r\n     Inter-Allied Labor Conference in 1918 and endorsed by both the\r\n     majority and minority Socialists in the Central empires; no\r\n     forcible annexations, no punitive indemnities and the free\r\n     determination of all peoples.\r\n\r\n     \"The Socialist Party believes that the foundations for\r\n     international understanding must be laid during the war, before the\r\n     professional diplomats begin to dictate the world's future as they\r\n     have in the past.\r\n\r\n     \"It therefore supports the demand of the Inter-Allied Conference\r\n     for a meeting with the German workingmen, convinced that such a\r\n     meeting will promote the cause of democracy, and will encourage the\r\n     German people to throw off the military autocracy that now\r\n     oppresses them. We join our pledge to that of the Inter-Allied\r\n     Conference that, this done, as far as in our power, we shall not\r\n     permit the German people to be made the victims of imperialistic\r\n     designs.\"\r\n\r\nThe phrases in the above endorsement, \"Inter-Allied Conference,\"\r\n\"majority ... Socialists in the Central empires,\" and \"promote the cause\r\nof democracy,\" must have invoked the scorn of Lenine and Trotsky. Hence\r\nthe wording of their manifesto, in which they acknowledged as\r\n\"associates\" the \"followers ... of Debs in America,\" is an evident slap\r\nat Berger and Hillquit and their \"followers\" in the American Socialist\r\nParty. It was so understood by many in the party, and led to the rapid\r\nsprouting of a \"Left Wing\" and the ultimate secession of about 72,000\r\ndues-paying members, leaving only about 40,000 with Berger and Hillquit.\r\n\r\nThe story of this rupture will be found in the three chapters following,\r\nwhere it also appears that Berger and Hillquit attempted to hide their\r\n\"Yellow\" streak under a deeper daub of \"Red.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIALIST PARTY OF AMERICA DEVELOPS A LEFT WING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years ago, when the people of the United States were beginning to\r\nsuspect that the Socialists were plotting a revolution against our\r\nConstitutional form of government the hypocritical followers of Eugene\r\nV. Debs, fearing that their plot might be nipped in the bud, endeavored\r\nto conceal their conspiracy, and succeeded quite well, by assuring the\r\nAmerican people that the word \"revolution,\" so often used by them, was a\r\nharmless term and was to be taken in a broad sense, without the \"r,\"\r\nsignifying nothing more than \"evolution.\" \"Do not be alarmed,\" they told\r\nus, \"we Socialists are striving to bring about reforms in the\r\ngovernment, but solely by constitutional means and the use of the\r\nballot.\"[B]\r\n\r\nMany proofs could be given to show that, even in the early days of the\r\nAmerican Socialist Party, revolution, in the strictest sense of the\r\nword, was foremost in the minds of many of the Marxian leaders. With the\r\nadvent of Bolshevism in Russia, and the successful overthrow of European\r\ngovernments by revolutionary Socialists abroad, the \"Reds\" in our own\r\ncountry became decidedly bolder, both in word and plot, against the\r\nGovernment of our country. The more outspoken, daring and impatient\r\nplotters in the Socialist Party of America lined up in a Left Wing\r\nfaction, whereas the more hypocritical, hesitant, cautious and prudent\r\nrevolutionists constituted the Right Wing. The former became known as\r\nthe \"Reds,\" the latter as the \"Yellows.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Reds\" made a specialty of \"direct action\" or violence, had little\r\nconfidence in victory through the ballot, and campaigned for a\r\nrevolution at an early day. The \"Yellows,\" of course, also rely on a\r\nfinal victory through rebellion, but in the meantime, during the period\r\nof revolutionary education and organization, insist on political action.\r\nThe leaders in control of the executive machinery of the Socialist\r\nParty, wishing to retain their lucrative positions, and looking forward\r\nto the advantage of political office during the years which might elapse\r\nbefore the time would be ripe for rebellion, were nearly all Right\r\nWingers, and have waged a bitter and unscrupulous fight against the Left\r\nWing organization within the party.\r\n\r\nThe Left Wing of the Socialist Party of America had its origin,\r\nprobably, in the year 1916. According to the \"International Socialist\r\nReview,\" of December of that year, this ultra-revolutionary faction took\r\nform in Boston. About the latter part of the year 1917 it began to\r\ndevelop more rapidly, its progress being more or less proportional to\r\nthe spread of Bolshevism and the Socialist revolutions in Europe. Its\r\nsuccess, of course, was at the expense of the political leaders of the\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nThe Left Wing has certainly been more honest than the Right. The \"Reds\"\r\ncomprising it favor direct action, that is, strikes and disturbances,\r\nrather than the use of the ballot, hoping thus to bring our country into\r\nsuch a critical condition that they may precipitate a rebellion, and\r\nthen, though in a minority, assume control of the government by a sudden\r\n_coup d'état_, as the Bolsheviki did in Russia. The Left Wingers opposed\r\nthe \"immediate demands\" in the Socialist Party platform, preferring to\r\nwork for dictatorship rather than for social reforms. They despised the\r\npoliticians of the Right Wing, calling them yellow, reactionary,\r\nhypocritical, capitalistic Socialists, and telling them that their place\r\nwas with the newly formed Labor Party, which had already praised the\r\nSocialists and invited them to join its ranks. The Lefts expressed a\r\nfear that the leaders of the Right would, if our Government were\r\noverthrown, turn against them just as the Scheidemann-Ebert group turned\r\nagainst the German Spartacides. The fight between the two factions\r\nbecame severe about the beginning of the year 1919.\r\n\r\n\"The Revolutionary Age,\" Boston, February 15, 1919, speaking of the\r\ndisturbance in the Socialist Party, and explaining the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the Left Wing said:\r\n\r\n     \"The American Socialist Party is in a condition of feverish\r\n     theoretical activity. Pressing problems are being met in a spirit\r\n     of self-criticism. New forms of action in the social struggle are\r\n     being accepted. Old methods, old tactics, old ideas, which in the\r\n     test of war have proven incapable of furthering the revolutionary\r\n     struggle of the proletariat, are being seriously analyzed and\r\n     repudiated.\r\n\r\n     \"The membership of the Socialist Party, the majority, is\r\n     instinctively class conscious and revolutionary. It was this\r\n     membership that compelled our officials to acquiesce in the\r\n     adoption of a radical declaration against war--which most of the\r\n     officials sabotaged or converted into an innocuous policy of\r\n     bourgeois pacificism. When the Bolsheviki conquered, the majority\r\n     of our officials were either hostile or silent; some weeks before,\r\n     the 'New York Call' had stigmatized the Bolsheviki as 'anarchists.'\r\n     But the membership responded; they forced the hands of the\r\n     officials, who became 'me too' Bolsheviki, but who did not draw the\r\n     revolutionary implications of the Bolshevik policy. These officials\r\n     and their machinery baffled the will of the membership; more, the\r\n     membership baffled itself because it did not clearly understand the\r\n     theory and the practice implied in its instinctive class\r\n     consciousness and revolutionary spirit.\r\n\r\n     \"While our National Executive Committee accepts the Berne Congress\r\n     and refuses to call an emergency National Convention, locals of the\r\n     party are actively engaged in the great struggle, turning to the\r\n     left, to revolutionary Socialism. Groups within the party are\r\n     organizing and issuing proclamations, determined that the party\r\n     shall conquer the party for revolutionary Socialism. Two of these\r\n     proclamations were published in the last issue of 'The\r\n     Revolutionary Age.' They deserve serious consideration and\r\n     discussion.\r\n\r\n     \"The manifesto of the Communist Propaganda League of Chicago is a\r\n     concise document. Its criticism of the party is summarized:\r\n\r\n     \"'The Party proceeds on too narrow an understanding of political\r\n     action for a party of revolution, its programs and platforms have\r\n     been reformist and petty bourgeois in character, instead of being\r\n     definitely directed toward the goal of social revolution; the party\r\n     has failed to achieve unity with the revolutionary movement on the\r\n     industrial field.'\r\n\r\n     \"Its proposals for democratizing the party--mass action in the\r\n     party--are excellent; it repudiates the old international and the\r\n     Berne Congress, and asks:\r\n\r\n     \"'Identification of the Socialist Party with class conscious\r\n     industrial unionism, unity of all kinds of proletarian action and\r\n     protest forming part of the revolutionary class struggle; political\r\n     action to include political strikes and demonstrations, no\r\n     compromising with any groups not inherently committed to the\r\n     revolutionary class struggle, such as Labor parties, People's\r\n     Councils, Non-Partisan Leagues, Municipal Ownership Leagues and the\r\n     like.'\"\r\n\r\nIn order clearly to understand the big fight that has disrupted the\r\nSocialist Party, further explanations of the principles of the Left Wing\r\nare necessary. \"The Revolutionary Age,\" from which the above quotation\r\nwas taken, was first published in Boston, its editor being Louis C.\r\nFraina. In the summer of 1919 it combined with \"The Communist,\" of New\r\nYork City, and, still maintaining its former name, became the national\r\norgan of the Left Wing of the Socialist Party.\r\n\r\nIn the article just quoted reference was made to \"mass action.\" This,\r\naccording to \"The Revolutionary Age,\" is to be the main weapon used by\r\nthe rebels in precipitating rebellion. The July 12, 1919, issue of the\r\nsame paper explains mass action and shows how it is to be used. The\r\narticle, written by Louis C. Fraina, reads in part as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Socialism in its early activity as a general organized movement\r\n     was compelled to emphasize the action of politics because of the\r\n     immaturity of the proletariat....\r\n\r\n     \"All propaganda, all electoral and parliamentary activity are\r\n     insufficient for the overthrow of Capitalism, impotent when the\r\n     ultimate test of the class struggle turns into a test of power. The\r\n     power for the social revolution issues out of the actual struggles\r\n     of the proletariat, out of its strikes, its industrial unions and\r\n     mass action.\"\r\n\r\nIndustrial unions of course means the union system of the I. W. W., and\r\nnot the craft unions of the American Federation of Labor.\r\n\r\nThe article continues:\r\n\r\n     \"The peaceful parliamentary conquest of the state is either sheer\r\n     utopia or reaction....\r\n\r\n     \"The revolution is an act of a minority, at first; of the most\r\n     class conscious section of the industrial proletariat, which in a\r\n     test of electoral strength, would be a minority, but which, being a\r\n     solid, industrially indispensable class, can disperse and defeat\r\n     all other classes through the annihilation of the fraudulent\r\n     democracy of the parliamentary system implied in the dictatorship\r\n     of the proletariat, imposed upon society by means of revolutionary\r\n     mass action....\r\n\r\n     \"Mass action is not a form of action as much as it is a process and\r\n     synthesis of action. It is the unity of all forms of proletarian\r\n     action, a means of throwing the proletariat, organized and\r\n     unorganized, in a general struggle against Capitalism and the\r\n     capitalist state....\r\n\r\n     \"The great expressions of mass action in recent years, the New\r\n     Zealand general strike, the Lawrence strike, the great strike of\r\n     the British miners under which capitalist society reeled on the\r\n     verge of collapse--all were mass actions organized and carried\r\n     through in spite of the passive and active hostility of the\r\n     dominant Socialist and labor organization. Under the impulse of\r\n     mass action, the industrial proletariat senses its own power and\r\n     acquires the force to act equally against capitalism and the\r\n     conservatism of organizations. Indeed, a vital feature of mass\r\n     action is precisely that it places in the hands of the proletariat\r\n     the power to overcome the fetters of these organizations, to act in\r\n     spite of their conservatism, and through proletarian mass action\r\n     emphasize antagonisms between workers and capitalists, and conquer\r\n     power. A determining phase of the proletarian revolution in Russia\r\n     was its acting against the dominant Socialist organizations,\r\n     sweeping these aside through its mass action before it could seize\r\n     social supremacy....\r\n\r\n     \"Mass action is the proletariat itself in action, dispensing with\r\n     bureaucrats and intellectuals, acting through its own initiative;\r\n     and it is precisely this circumstance that horrifies the soul of\r\n     petty bourgeois Socialism. The masses are to act upon their own\r\n     initiative and the impulse of their own struggles....\r\n\r\n     \"Mass action organizes and develops into the political strike and\r\n     demonstration, in which a general political issue is the source of\r\n     the action....\r\n\r\n     \"The class power of the proletariat arises out of the intensity of\r\n     its struggles and revolutionary energy. It consists, moreover, of\r\n     undermining the bases of the morale of the capitalist state, a\r\n     process that requires extra parliamentary activity through mass\r\n     action. Capitalism trembles when it meets the impact of a strike in\r\n     a basic industry; Capitalism will more than tremble, it will\r\n     actually verge on a collapse, when it meets the impact of a general\r\n     mass action involving a number of correlated industries, and\r\n     developing into revolutionary mass action against the whole\r\n     capitalist regime. The value of this mass action is that it shows\r\n     the proletariat its power, weakens capitalism, and compels the\r\n     state largely to depend on the use of brute force in the struggle,\r\n     either the physical force of the military or the force of legal\r\n     terrorism; this emphasizes antagonisms between proletarian and\r\n     capitalist, widening the scope and deepening the intensity of the\r\n     proletarian struggle against capitalism....\r\n\r\n     \"Mass action, being the proletariat itself in action, loosens its\r\n     energy, develops enthusiasm, and unifies the action of the workers\r\n     to its utmost measure....\r\n\r\n     \"Moreover, mass action means the repudiation of bourgeois\r\n     democracy. Socialism will come not through the peaceful, democratic\r\n     parliamentary conquest of the state, but through the determined and\r\n     revolutionary mass action of a proletarian minority. The fetish of\r\n     democracy is a fetter upon the proletarian revolution; mass action\r\n     smashes the fetish, emphasizing that the proletarian recognizes no\r\n     limits to its action except the limits of its own power. The\r\n     proletariat will never conquer unless it proceeds to struggle after\r\n     struggle; its power is developed and its energy let loose only\r\n     through action. Parliamentarism, in and of itself, fetters\r\n     proletarian action; organizations are often equally fetters upon\r\n     action; the proletariat must act and always act; through action it\r\n     conquers....\r\n\r\n     \"The great war has objectively brought Europe to the verge of\r\n     revolution. Capitalist society at any moment may be thrust into the\r\n     air by an upheaval of the proletariat--as in Russia. Whence will\r\n     the impulse for the revolutionary struggle come? Surely not from\r\n     the moderate Socialism and unionism, which are united solidly in\r\n     favor of an imperialistic war; surely not from futile parliamentary\r\n     rhetoric, even should it be revolutionary rhetoric. The impulse\r\n     will come out of the mass action of the proletariat....\r\n\r\n     \"Mass action is equally a process of revolution and the revolution\r\n     itself in operation.\"\r\n\r\nThe March 22, 1919, issue of \"The Revolutionary Age\" published the\r\nManifesto of the Left Wing section of the Socialist Party of New York,\r\nfrom which several important quotations are hereby taken:\r\n\r\n     \"We are a very active and growing section of the Socialist Party\r\n     who are attempting to reach the rank and file with our urgent\r\n     message over the heads that be, who, through inertia or a lack of\r\n     vision, cannot see the necessity for a critical analysis of the\r\n     party's policies and tactics....\r\n\r\n     \"In the latter part of the nineteenth century the\r\n     Social-Democracies of Europe set out to 'legislate capitalism out\r\n     of office.' The class struggle was to be won in the capitalist\r\n     legislatures. Step by step concessions were to be wrested from the\r\n     state; the working class and the Socialist parties were to be\r\n     strengthened by means of 'constructive' reform and social\r\n     legislation; each concession would act as a rung in the ladder of\r\n     Social Revolution, upon which the workers could climb step by step,\r\n     until finally, some bright sunny morning, the peoples would awaken\r\n     to find the Cooperative Commonwealth functioning without disorder,\r\n     confusion or hitch on the ruins of the capitalist state.\r\n\r\n     \"And what happened? When a few legislative seats had been secured,\r\n     the thunderous denunciations of the Socialist legislators suddenly\r\n     ceased. No more were the parliaments used as platforms from which\r\n     the challenge of revolutionary Socialism was flung to all the\r\n     corners of Europe. Another era had set in, the era of\r\n     'constructive' social reform legislation. Dominant Moderate\r\n     Socialism accepted the bourgeois state as the basis of its action\r\n     and strengthened that state. All power to shape the policies and\r\n     tactics of the Socialist parties was entrusted to the parliamentary\r\n     leaders. And these lost sight of Socialism's original purpose;\r\n     their goal became 'constructive reforms' and cabinet\r\n     portfolios--the 'cooperation of classes,' the policy of openly or\r\n     tacitly declaring that the coming of Socialism was a concern 'of\r\n     all the classes,' instead of emphasizing the Marxian policy that\r\n     the construction of the Socialist system is the task of the\r\n     revolutionary proletariat alone....\r\n\r\n     \"The 'Moderates' emphasized petty-bourgeois reformism in order to\r\n     attract tradesmen, shop-keepers and members of the professions,\r\n     and, of course, the latter flocked to the Socialist movement in\r\n     great numbers, seeking relief from the constant grinding between\r\n     corporate capital and awakening labor....\r\n\r\n     \"Dominant 'Moderate Socialism' forgot the teachings of the founders\r\n     of scientific Socialism, forgot its function as a proletarian\r\n     movement--'the most resolute and advanced section of the working\r\n     class parties'--and permitted the bourgeois and self-seeking trade\r\n     union elements to shape its policies and tactics. This was the\r\n     condition in which the Social-Democracies of Europe found\r\n     themselves at the outbreak of the war in 1914. Demoralized and\r\n     confused by the cross-currents within their own parties,\r\n     vacillating and compromising with the bourgeois state, they fell a\r\n     prey to social-patriotism and nationalism.\r\n\r\n     \"But revolutionary Socialism was not destined to lie inert for\r\n     long. In Germany, Karl Liebknecht, Franz Mehring, Rosa Luxemburg\r\n     and Otto Rhule organized the Spartacus group. But their voices were\r\n     drowned in the roar of cannon and the shriek of the dying and\r\n     maimed.\r\n\r\n     \"Russia, however, was to be the first battle-ground where the\r\n     'moderate' and revolutionary Socialism should come to grips for the\r\n     mastery of the state. The break-down of the corrupt, bureaucratic\r\n     Czarist regime opened the floodgates of Revolution....\r\n\r\n     \"'Moderate Socialism' was not prepared to seize the power for the\r\n     workers during a revolution. 'Moderate Socialism' had a rigid\r\n     formula--'constructive social reform legislation within the\r\n     capitalist state,' and to that formula it clung....\r\n\r\n     \"Revolutionary Socialists hold, with the founders of Scientific\r\n     Socialism, that there are two dominant classes in society--the\r\n     bourgeoisie and the proletariat; that between these two classes a\r\n     struggle must go on, until the working class, through the seizure\r\n     of the instruments of production and distribution, the abolition of\r\n     the capitalist state, and the establishment of the dictatorship of\r\n     the proletariat, creates a Socialist system. Revolutionary\r\n     Socialists do not believe that they can be voted into power. They\r\n     struggle for the conquest of power by the revolutionary\r\n     proletariat....\r\n\r\n     \"The 'moderate Socialist' proposes to use the bourgeois state with\r\n     its fraudulent democracy, its illusory theory of 'unity of all the\r\n     classes,' its standing army, police and bureaucracy oppressing and\r\n     baffling the masses; the revolutionary Socialist maintains that the\r\n     bourgeois state must be completely destroyed, and proposes the\r\n     organization of a new state--the state of the organized\r\n     producers--of the Federated Soviets--on the basis of which alone\r\n     can Socialism be introduced.\r\n\r\n     \"Industrial Unionism, the organization of the proletariat in\r\n     accordance with the integration of industry and for the overthrow\r\n     of Capitalism, is a necessary phase of revolutionary Socialist\r\n     agitation. Potentially, industrial unionism constructs the basis\r\n     and develops the ideology of the industrial state of Socialism; but\r\n     industrial unionism alone cannot perform the revolutionary act of\r\n     seizure of the power of the state, since under the conditions of\r\n     Capitalism it is impossible to organize the whole working class,\r\n     or an overwhelming majority into industrial unionism.\r\n\r\n     \"It is the task of a revolutionary Socialist party to direct the\r\n     struggles of the proletariat and provide a program for the\r\n     culminating crisis.\"\r\n\r\nJulius Hammer, in a letter published in \"The Call,\" April 4, 1919,\r\nspeaking of the Left Wing, says:\r\n\r\n     \"Aside from the discussions as to the principles and tactics\r\n     identifying the 'Left Wing' there is a great deal of acrimonious\r\n     discussion and opposition to those in the 'Left Wing' organization.\r\n     They are called 'separatists,' 'secessionists,' 'splitters of the\r\n     party,' and this in spite of vehement denials that there is\r\n     intention or desire to split the party. 'It is unnecessary,'\r\n     say they, 'and superfluous; the party machinery is ample\r\n     for the purpose now; organization within organization is\r\n     injurious and wrong.' Some seem to go even further and fling\r\n     epithets of 'disrupters,' 'traitors,' 'direct actionists,'\r\n     'anti-politicalists,' 'anarchists,' etc. And there seems to be\r\n     quite a number who consider that the menace should be met with\r\n     stern measures--nothing less than expulsion.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Left Wing statements of principles and tactics the reader will\r\nobserve a constant emphasis upon \"direct action,\" or violence, and in\r\nfavor of \"industrial unionism\" and the \"identification of the Socialist\r\nParty with class conscious industrial unionism.\" Chapters VIII and IX of\r\nthis work, which describe the principles and tactics of the I. W. W.,\r\nwill make the significance of the Left Wing movement perfectly apparent\r\nas an effort to combine Socialist Partyism and I. W. W.'ism or to place\r\nthe latter under the political leadership of the former. In the Left\r\nWing we see an enthusiastic consecration of the major part of the\r\nAmerican Socialist Party to revolutionary violence--the direct\r\napplication of anarchistic tactics to the overthrow of the Government\r\nand institutions of the United States. As we follow the Left Wing\r\nmovement we shall see the principles and tactics of the I. W. W., as\r\ncarried out in Russia, adopted as a program by the major part of the\r\nAmerican Socialist party, which also finally succeeded in committing the\r\nminor part, the Right Wing, to the same principles.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, this movement was helped on by the various\r\ncommunications received from the Lenine dictatorship, and notably by the\r\ncall for an international communist congress to meet at Moscow in March,\r\n1919. The text of this call began to appear in the American radical\r\npublications in late March and April, and is here reproduced from \"The\r\nOne Big Union Monthly\" for the latter month:\r\n\r\n     \"First Section\r\n\r\n     \"AIMS AND TACTICS\r\n\r\n     \"In our estimation, the acceptance of the following principles\r\n     shall serve as a working program for the International:\r\n\r\n     \"1. The actual period is the period of the dissolution and collapse\r\n     of the whole capitalist system;\r\n\r\n     \"2. The first task of the proletariat consists to-day of the\r\n     immediate seizure of government power by the proletariat;\r\n\r\n     \"3. This new governmental apparatus must incorporate the\r\n     dictatorship of the working class, and in some places, also, that\r\n     of the poorer peasantry, together with hired farm labor, this\r\n     dictatorship constituting the instrument of the systematic\r\n     overthrow of the exploiting classes;\r\n\r\n     \"4. The dictatorship of the proletariat shall complete the\r\n     immediate expropriation of Capitalism and the suppression of\r\n     private property in the means of production, which includes, under\r\n     Socialism, the suppression of private property and its transfer to\r\n     a proletarian state under the Socialist administration of the\r\n     working class, the abolition of capitalist agricultural production,\r\n     the nationalization of the great business firms and financial\r\n     trusts;\r\n\r\n     \"5. In order to insure the Social Revolution, the disarming of the\r\n     bourgeoisie and its agents, and the general arming of the\r\n     proletariat, is a prime necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Second Section\r\n\r\n     \"ATTITUDE REGARDING SOCIALIST PARTIES\r\n\r\n     \"7. The fundamental condition of the struggle is the mass action of\r\n     the proletariat, developing into open armed attack on the\r\n     governmental powers of Capitalism;\r\n\r\n     \"8. The old International has broken into three principal groups:\r\n     the avowed social-patriots, who, during the entire duration of the\r\n     imperialistic war between the years 1914 and 1918, have supported\r\n     their own bourgeoisie; the minority Socialists of the 'Center,'\r\n     represented by leaders of the type of Karl Kautsky, and who\r\n     constitute a group composed of ever-hesitating elements, unable to\r\n     settle on any determined direction and who up to date have always\r\n     acted as traitors; and the Revolutionary Left Wing.\r\n\r\n     \"9. As far as the social-patriots are concerned, who stood up\r\n     everywhere in arms, in the most critical moments, against the\r\n     revolution, a merciless fight is the alternative; in regard to the\r\n     'Center,' the tactics consist in separating from it the\r\n     revolutionary elements, in criticizing pitilessly its leaders and\r\n     in dividing systematically among them the number of their\r\n     followers; these tactics are absolutely necessary when we reach a\r\n     certain degree of development;\r\n\r\n     \"10. On the other hand it is necessary to proceed in a common\r\n     movement with the revolutionary elements of the working class who,\r\n     though hitherto not belonging to the party, yet adopt to-day in its\r\n     entirety, the point of view of dictatorship of the proletariat,\r\n     under the form of Soviet government, including the syndicalist\r\n     elements of the labor movements;\r\n\r\n     \"11. It is also necessary to rally the groups and proletarian\r\n     organizations, who, though not in the wake as yet of the\r\n     revolutionary trend of the Left Wing, nevertheless have manifested\r\n     and developed a tendency leading in that direction;\r\n\r\n     \"12. We propose that the representatives of parties and groups\r\n     following these tendencies shall take part in the Congress as\r\n     plenipotentiary members of the Workers' International and should\r\n     belong to the following parties:\r\n\r\n     \"1.

The Congress must be transformed into a common organ of combat\r\n     in view of the permanent struggle and systematic direction of the\r\n     movement, into a center of International Communism which will\r\n     subordinate the Interests of the Revolution from an international\r\n     point of view.\r\n\r\n     \"The concrete forms of organization, representation, etc., will be\r\n     elaborated by the Congress.\"\r\n\r\n     The testimony of Morris Hillquit in the Socialist case before the\r\n     Assembly Judiciary Committee gave the preceding document an added\r\n     interest which the reader will better appreciate further on. As\r\n     will appear later in our narrative, on September 4, 1919, the\r\n     Socialist Party adopted a manifesto strongly favoring the\r\n     \"industrial\" unionizing of American labor for the purpose of\r\n     reinforcing the political \"demands\" of the Socialist Party with\r\n     \"industrial action.\"\r\n\r\n     On the stand at Albany, on February 19, 1920, Hillquit acknowledged\r\n     the authorship of at least 90 per cent of the \"industrial action\"\r\n     manifesto of his party, but declared that he had never read the\r\n     Moscow manifesto when he wrote his, and so was not influenced by\r\n     the Moscow recommendation of industrial action to bring about a\r\n     revolution by violence. But the above \"call\" to the Moscow\r\n     Conference urged \"a common movement\" with \"syndicalist elements,\"\r\n     or \"industrial union\" revolutionaries, as much as the Moscow\r\n     manifesto did, and the reader will find at the end of our next\r\n     chapter evidence that Morris Hillquit was familiar with and\r\n     criticized the above Moscow \"call\" at least as early as July, 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE FREE-FOR-ALL FIGHT BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND LEFT WINGS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmanuel Blumstein, a member of the Right Wing, in a letter published in\r\n\"The Call,\" April 9, 1919, bitterly complained against the tactics of\r\nthe Left Wingers--in trying to wrest control of the Socialist Party from\r\nthe \"Old Guard\" of Berger and Hillquit, which had acquired the habit of\r\ndomination:\r\n\r\n     \"The reason that the so-called Left Wingers are concentrating at\r\n     meetings, making motions to recall delegates, and carry their\r\n     motions through, is very simple. Anyone who attends the meetings\r\n     can easily understand it. They shout down every honest thinking\r\n     Socialist with slurs and abuse. They make it so intolerable that\r\n     the meeting hall appears to be, instead of a Socialist meeting, a\r\n     room frequented by rowdies of all types and descriptions. In this\r\n     way they drive the most active Comrades out of the meeting hall, as\r\n     these Comrades get disgusted with the tactics pursued and leave the\r\n     meeting. Then they drag the meeting on to all hours of the night\r\n     until those left, having no opposition, carry all their destructive\r\n     actions through, and this they call democratic decision for the\r\n     Comrades of the branch--deciding the policies for them.\"\r\n\r\nMorris Zucker, a member of the Left Wing, defends his faction in a\r\nletter that appeared in \"The Call,\" New York, April 11, 1919:\r\n\r\n     \"In regard to Lee's objection that the Left Wing may bring about a\r\n     premature revolt, the reply is that no real revolution, no social\r\n     revolution, is ever manufactured. It must be spontaneous. It must\r\n     be real. It must be an overwhelming, impulsive demonstration of the\r\n     popular will. Revolutions may be manipulated but not manufactured.\r\n     Trotzky shows in his 'From October to Brest-Litovsk' that the\r\n     Bolshevist Revolution was not manufactured.\r\n\r\n     \"The problem is to manipulate the revolution, to guide it, to\r\n     counsel it. And herein lies the importance of proper Socialist\r\n     education, of knowledge and understanding, and from these of proper\r\n     Socialist tactics.\r\n\r\n     \"The Left Wing believes it has the proper program. And it wants the\r\n     Socialist Party to adopt its program. The Left Wing not only\r\n     preaches revolutionary Socialism, it believes that the economic and\r\n     social forces that have made half Europe Socialist, and threaten\r\n     momentarily to engulf the other half are at work in America also.\r\n     It believes that a revolutionary outbreak in America is not a\r\n     matter of the far and distant future. And it desires to make that\r\n     revolution as easy and as successful as it can possibly be. For\r\n     that reason the Left Wing has evolved its manifesto and program,\r\n     and now calls upon the Socialist Party to discuss it, perfect it,\r\n     and adopt it.\"\r\n\r\nIn April, 1919, the New York State Committee of the Socialist Party, by\r\na vote of 24 against 17, resolved that it was \"definitely opposed to the\r\norganization calling itself the Left Wing section of the Socialist\r\nParty, and to any group within the party organized for the same or\r\nsimilar purpose;\" and it instructed \"its executive committee to revoke\r\nthe charter of any local affiliated with any such organization or that\r\npermits its subdivision or members to be affiliated.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Call,\" April 23, 1919, publishes a long letter from F. Basky in\r\nwhich he defends the principles of the Left Wing and attacks the New\r\nYork State Committee for the above resolutions. We quote a part:\r\n\r\n     \"Aside of these arguments the Left Wing is not a\r\n     counter-organization to the Socialist Party. On the contrary, it is\r\n     the only active force to save the party from going into decay and\r\n     finally to the scrap heap as a tool not adapted to the task. If the\r\n     Left Wing is the party, then and only then can we answer the\r\n     criticism of the syndicalist that a political party is nothing else\r\n     but a vote-catching machinery for middle-class politicians. If the\r\n     principles enunciated in the manifesto will be the principles of\r\n     the party, then it will enjoy the confidence of those who, through\r\n     their bitter experience realized the fallacies of the Second\r\n     International, led and dominated by the social-patriots, reformists\r\n     of the German Social Democratic Party. If we follow the line of\r\n     uncompromising revolutionary activity indicated by the Left\r\n     Wingers, then we can rest assured that the party will be cleared of\r\n     the would-be Scheidemanns, Eberts, Kerenskys, Brantenburgs, and the\r\n     rest of the traitors of our principles and our class.\r\n\r\n     \"They will be eliminated anyway. The fight is on. And I welcome the\r\n     attack of the state committee. We at least know some of those we\r\n     would have to face in the critical hour. Might as well fight it out\r\n     now; whether they or the Left Wing represents the party. Let us\r\n     find out right now who is with us and who is against us.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Call,\" April 30, 1919, published a resolution then recently passed\r\nby the Socialist Party of Essex County, New Jersey, which had adopted\r\nthe Left Wing program. Part of the resolution is hereby quoted:\r\n\r\n     \"While the need for new orientation is clearly apparent, there is\r\n     an element within the party which is either unwilling or unable to\r\n     adjust itself to the new world conditions and the new tactics\r\n     required by these conditions. Unfortunately, this element has\r\n     controlled the party national executive committee and the party\r\n     machinery, with the consequence that the national organization, in\r\n     place of furnishing the leadership and urging the locals forward to\r\n     take advantage of the present world crisis in building up the\r\n     proletariat movement, has conspicuously lagged behind.\"\r\n\r\nBy the early part of May, 1919, conditions in the Socialist Party became\r\nso serious that the Executive Committee of Local New York, according to\r\n\"The Call,\" May 8, 1919, issued the following statement on the Left\r\nWing:\r\n\r\n     \"To the Members of Local New York:\r\n\r\n     \"Comrades.--A critical situation has arisen within Local New York.\r\n     Your executive committee is compelled to take unusual and vigorous\r\n     measures to combat the disruptive efforts of an internal faction\r\n     which seeks to dominate the party by undemocratic and unsocialistic\r\n     methods. The executive committee addresses itself to you, the\r\n     membership, to explain the gravity of the crisis and to urge your\r\n     support in saving the organization which has been built up with so\r\n     much sacrifice by thousands of Comrades.\r\n\r\n     \"The very existence of the party is at stake--its existence as the\r\n     democratically self-governed party of the working class, laboring\r\n     to awaken and educate the proletarian masses and to express their\r\n     class interests on the political field....\r\n\r\n     \"This organization, i.e., the Left Wing, is not open to all party\r\n     members, nor even to all who accept the ideas set forth in its\r\n     manifesto and program. Only such persons are admitted as can be\r\n     counted on to set the authority of the 'Left Wing Section' above\r\n     that of the party itself. Its meetings are held in secret, and\r\n     their business is that of a permanent closed caucus to lay plans\r\n     for controlling the action of the party branches and committees,\r\n     and of obstructing their activities when it cannot control them.\r\n\r\n     \"Even within the 'Left Wing Section' itself democratic methods are\r\n     not used. The admission of members, the choice of delegates to Left\r\n     Wing conferences, and the framing of instructions to those\r\n     delegates are intrusted to committees composing an inner circle.\r\n     All members and adherents of the 'Left Wing Section' are called\r\n     upon in their action as party members and as members of party\r\n     committees, to give explicit obedience to orders issued by the\r\n     inner circle. A sufficient sample of this is the appointment of a\r\n     'steering committee' for the Left Wingers in the central committee\r\n     of the local, and the issuance of instructions to delegates\r\n     affiliated with that section as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"'In all matters involving Left Wing tactics vote as a unit with\r\n     the steering committee. Do not make motions, ask for divisions,\r\n     further divisions, roll call, and appeals from the chair. The\r\n     steering committee will attend to that.'\r\n\r\n     \"The Left Wing Section has not been able to command a majority in\r\n     the central committee, notwithstanding the drastic methods used in\r\n     their attempt to capture it. Unable to control they have practised\r\n     systematic obstruction, and have openly declared that they will not\r\n     permit the central committee to function so long as their group is\r\n     in the minority there. Under the direction of their steering\r\n     committee, the time is consumed with every species of parliamentary\r\n     delay, with the aim and effect of preventing the central committee\r\n     from transacting business and carrying on the normal work of the\r\n     party. These dilatory tactics are supplemented by personal abuse\r\n     directed against those who will not truckle to the 'Left Wing,' by\r\n     insults and provocatory threats, and when necessary, by the\r\n     creation of an uproar designed to attract the attention of the\r\n     police and to break up the sessions....\r\n\r\n     \"The Executive Committee has heretofore decided not to have a\r\n     meeting of the central committee on May 13, and has appointed a\r\n     committee to reorganize Local New York. This committee will begin\r\n     with such branches as are affiliated with the 'Left Wing Section.'\r\n     No one will be excluded because of his opinions, but no one can\r\n     retain a double membership in the party and the so-called 'Left\r\n     Wing Section.'\"\r\n\r\nBy about the middle of May, 1919, the Left Wing program had been adopted\r\nby the Socialist Party in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit,\r\nPhiladelphia, Kings and Queens Counties, N. Y., and Essex County, N. J.\r\nIn Hudson County, N. J., the county committee referred it favorably to\r\nall the branches, and at the end of the month the New Jersey Convention\r\nof the party adopted it. In Chicago, J. Louis Engdahl, sentenced[C] to\r\ntwenty years in Leavenworth prison, was reported to have been ousted\r\nfrom the organization, having been considered too conservative by the\r\nmillionaire Socialist, William Bross Lloyd, and the latter's friends who\r\ncontrolled the Communist Propaganda League, the Left Wing faction of the\r\nlocal organization.\r\n\r\n\"The Call,\" May 8, 1919, publishes an interesting letter from one of its\r\ncorrespondents:\r\n\r\n     \"It is not so much a question as to Left or Right Wing domination\r\n     as it is a question of whether we are to have a united or divided\r\n     party.\r\n\r\n     \"I am not a Centrist, if that means to be in the center of the\r\n     party as it is today. We must move to the Left--that is understood\r\n     by all thinking, class-conscious Comrades, but we must move\r\n     together, not, perhaps, as far as some of the hot-heads would like\r\n     to have us--they fail to understand what an American Socialist\r\n     Party should be, for they seem to think of New York City as the\r\n     whole thing. If they could take a trip to Chicago and back they\r\n     might find themselves moving toward the Right.\r\n\r\n     \"No one wants to be where the stick-in-the-mud Rights are,\r\n     either--that is, no one except them. The majority of us see the\r\n     need for revolutionizing the party. What we don't see is any\r\n     necessity of disrupting the party in the process. The master class\r\n     would like to see that; in fact, they have been egging us on to\r\n     fight among ourselves for the last two or three years, and we have\r\n     blindly done the very thing that they want most we should do. They\r\n     are laughing in their sleeves at us--poor boobs that we are.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 15, 1919, following the open fight against the Left Wing\r\ninaugurated by the New York State Committee and its Executive Committee,\r\nthe Left Wing Locals of Boston, Cleveland and New York joined in a call\r\nfor a National Conference of the Left Wing to convene in New York on\r\nJune 21. This call opened with the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n     \"The international situation and the crisis in the American\r\n     Socialist Party; the sabotage the party bureaucracy has practised\r\n     on the emergency national convention; the N. E. C. [National\r\n     Executive Committee] aligning our party with the social-patriots at\r\n     Berne, with the Congress of the Great Betrayal; the necessity of\r\n     reconstructing our policy in accord with revolutionary events--all\r\n     this and more, makes it necessary that the revolutionary forces in\r\n     the Socialist Party get together for counsel and action.\"\r\n\r\nApparently so many bitter letters were sent to \"The Call\" that it found\r\nit expedient to publish the following notice in its edition of May 16,\r\n1919:\r\n\r\n     \"No letters dealing in personalities of any kind will be published\r\n     in this column. All views and all arguments set forth must be\r\n     confined strictly to the principles and tactics either defended or\r\n     attacked. This ruling is by the unanimous vote of the Board of\r\n     Managers of 'The Call.'\"\r\n\r\nMorris Hillquit, member of the National Executive Committee of the\r\nSocialist Party till September, 1919, and one of the principle leaders\r\nof the Right, published in his paper, \"The Call,\" May 21, 1919, a long\r\narticle in large type, covering half of the editorial page, under the\r\ncaption, \"The Socialist Task and Outlook.\" After speaking of the gloomy\r\nconditions in the Socialist Party abroad, he thus comments on conditions\r\nin the American branch of the international organization:\r\n\r\n     \"All the more unfortunate is it that the energies of the Socialist\r\n     Party should at this time be dissipated in acrimonious and\r\n     fruitless controversies brought on by the self-styled Left Wing\r\n     movement. I am one of the last men in the party to ignore or\r\n     misunderstand the sound revolutionary impulse which animates the\r\n     rank and file of this new movement, but the specific form and\r\n     direction which it has assumed, its program and tactics, spell\r\n     disaster to our movement. I am opposed to it, not because it is too\r\n     radical, but because it is essentially reactionary and\r\n     non-Socialistic; not because it would lead us too far, but because\r\n     it would lead us nowhere. To prate about the dictatorship of the\r\n     proletariat and of workers' Soviets in the United States at this\r\n     time is to deflect the Socialist propaganda from its realistic\r\n     basis, and to advocate the abolition of all social reform planks in\r\n     the party platform means to abandon the concrete class struggle as\r\n     it presents itself from day to day.\r\n\r\n     \"The Left Wing movement, as I see it, is a purely emotional reflex\r\n     of the situation in Russia. The cardinal vice of the movement is\r\n     that it started as a wing, i.e., as a schismatic and disintegrating\r\n     movement. Proceeding on the arbitrary assumption that they were the\r\n     Left, the ingenuous leaders of the movement had to discover a\r\n     Right, and since the European classification would not be fully\r\n     reproduced without a Center, they also were bound to locate a\r\n     center in the Socialist movement of America.[D] What matters it to\r\n     our imaginative Left Wing leaders that the Socialist Party of\r\n     America as a whole has stood in the forefront of Socialist\r\n     radicalism ever since the outbreak of the war, that many of its\r\n     officers and leaders have exposed their lives and liberties to\r\n     imminent peril in defense of the principles of international\r\n     Socialism, they are Right Wingers and Centrists because the\r\n     exigencies of the Left Wing require it. The Left Wing movement is a\r\n     sort of burlesque on the Russian revolution. Its leaders do not\r\n     want to convert their Comrades in the party. They must capture and\r\n     establish a sort of dictatorship of the proletariat(?) within the\r\n     party. Hence the creation of their dual organization as a kind of\r\n     Soviet, and their refusal to cooperate with the aforesaid stage\r\n     Centrists and Right Wingers.\r\n\r\n     \"But the performance is too sad to be amusing. It seems perfectly\r\n     clear that, so long as this movement persists in the party, the\r\n     latter's activity will be wholly taken up by mutual quarrels and\r\n     recriminations. Neither wing will have any time for the propaganda\r\n     of Socialism. There is, as far as I can see, but one remedy. It\r\n     would be futile to preach reconciliation and union where antagonism\r\n     runs so high. Let the Comrades on both sides do the next best\r\n     thing. Let them separate, honestly, freely and without rancor. Let\r\n     each side organize and work in its own way, and make such\r\n     contribution to the Socialist movement in America as it can. Better\r\n     a hundred times to have two numerically small Socialist\r\n     organizations, each homogeneous and harmonious within itself, than\r\n     to have one big party torn by dissensions and squabbles, an\r\n     impotent colossus on feet of clay. The time for action is near.\r\n     Let us clear the decks.\"\r\n\r\nBy the end of May, 1919, the Left Wing fight had become so serious that\r\nthe National Executive Committee revoked the charter of the Socialist\r\nParty in Michigan and suspended the Russian, Lithuanian, Ukranian,\r\nLettish, Polish, South Slavic and Hungarian branches, expelling or\r\nsuspending considerably over 25,000 members out of a total dues-paying\r\nmembership of about 100,000.\r\n\r\n\"The Ohio Socialist,\" the party organ of Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia\r\nand New Mexico, in its issue of June 4, 1919, comments as follows on the\r\nexpulsions:\r\n\r\n     \"Violating every principle of fair play and square dealing and\r\n     disregarding every constitutional provision, the National Executive\r\n     Committee at its session in Chicago, May 24 to 30, expelled without\r\n     a trial the state organization of the Socialist Party of Michigan,\r\n     constituting about 6,000 members, suspended the Russian,\r\n     Lithuanian, Lettish, Polish, Hungarian, Ukrainian and South Slavic\r\n     Federations of the party, constituting more than 30,000 members,\r\n     and worst of all--and let it be said to their everlasting\r\n     shame--are autocratically holding up the national membership\r\n     referendum for the election of a new National Executive Committee,\r\n     International Delegates, International Secretary, and the holding\r\n     of a national convention.\r\n\r\n     \"Never before in the party's history have Socialist Party officials\r\n     been so lost to all sense of decency and square dealing. A wilful\r\n     group of seven members of the National Executive Committee usurped\r\n     power which the constitution does not grant them and which the\r\n     Socialist Party membership never intended any servants of the party\r\n     to have. This despotic group of seven did not act as the party's\r\n     servants, but as dictators and tyrants to defeat the expressed will\r\n     of the party membership and to perpetuate itself in office.\r\n\r\n     \"Unbelievable as it may seem, seven officials of the party had the\r\n     monumental effrontery to assume the right to expel and suspend\r\n     40,000 members. Think of it. That such a dastardly deed should ever\r\n     be perpetrated upon the rank and file of our organization is almost\r\n     beyond comprehension. And yet it was done--it was done by those\r\n     whom you elected to serve you. Instead they are betraying you,\r\n     disrupting the organization....\r\n\r\n     \"The intention of these autocrats is plain as daylight. Like a\r\n     tidal wave, the demand for a Socialism which stands true to the\r\n     working class at all times has swept the party. The thousands of\r\n     Comrades who are sincerely working to win the party to a more\r\n     revolutionary position are known to the Left Wing. This Left Wing\r\n     understands clearly that the Scheidemann brand of Socialism stands\r\n     for the betrayal and defeat of the working class and that only the\r\n     Socialism of Liebknecht and Lenine has within it the potentialities\r\n     of victory and success....\r\n\r\n     \"There was no trial, no opportunity for defense offered to the\r\n     Michigan Comrades. A motion to allow Michigan a chance to interpret\r\n     their action was voted down. The right to appear at a trial was\r\n     denied....\r\n\r\n     \"Expulsion meant throwing out over three thousand votes. On with\r\n     the expulsion of Michigan....\r\n\r\n     \"But the expulsion of Michigan was apparently not sufficient to\r\n     decide the elections in favor of the reactionary moderates. At a\r\n     subsequent session, accordingly, it was decided to destroy the\r\n     whole election.\r\n\r\n     \"The National Executive Committee instructed the secretary not to\r\n     tabulate the vote or make it public. They nullified the referendum\r\n     vote, destroyed the will of the membership in order to retain\r\n     control. Most of these National Executive Committee members are out\r\n     for re-election, are interested parties, knowing that the\r\n     referendum defeated them for re-election, are now, by this action,\r\n     perpetuating themselves in office....\r\n\r\n     \"The National Executive Committee's action is equivalent to\r\n     stealing the elections. The party must act sternly to rebuke this\r\n     official chicanery.\r\n\r\n     \"After this betrayal of the party the despotic seven seemed to fear\r\n     the results of the National Convention, which has been called for\r\n     August 30. A way had to be devised to control the convention. Happy\r\n     thought: Suspend the federations that have endorsed the Left Wing,\r\n     and we are safe. Another caucus held. Result: Suspension of the\r\n     Russian, Polish, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Lettish and\r\n     South Slavic Federations from the Socialist Party--over thirty\r\n     thousand members. A plain attempt to assure the election of\r\n     reactionary delegates to the National Convention to approve the\r\n     abominable actions of the National Executive Committee majority....\r\n\r\n     \"In spite of all these dirty tactics the little group of\r\n     reactionary autocrats did not feel themselves secure. They still\r\n     fear that they will not be able to control the coming National\r\n     Convention. So they formed a corporation, nearly all the directors\r\n     of which are of the same stamp as the wilful seven, and into the\r\n     hands of these directors is to be placed the entire property of the\r\n     Socialist Party, including the new headquarters building upon which\r\n     $10,000 has been paid. These directors cannot be recalled by the\r\n     party membership as long as they retain membership in the party,\r\n     and only four, a minority, can be removed in three years' time....\r\n\r\n     \"They want the Left Wing to desert the party. They want us to leave\r\n     the party machinery in their hands. They will be disappointed in\r\n     this. We know their game. We shall not play into their hands. We\r\n     will not quit. Every Left Winger will work night and day for the\r\n     reinstatement of the nearly 40,000 members whom the reactionaries\r\n     are trying to sever from the party in violation of the party's\r\n     constitution. Every radical will work with might and main to get\r\n     new members and build, build the Left Wing and the party. Every\r\n     revolutionist will stick until victory is ours and the Socialist\r\n     Party is completely won for revolutionary Socialism.\"\r\n\r\nCommenting on the referendum for a new National Executive Committee \"The\r\nRevolutionary Age\" in its May 24, 1919, issue says:\r\n\r\n     \"The moderates claim that the Left Wing represents only a small\r\n     clique in the party: why, then, not allow the membership to make\r\n     its decision through the referendum? Why disfranchise the\r\n     revolutionary Socialists? Why steal votes away from the Left Wing\r\n     candidates? These desperate tactics are understandable only on the\r\n     theory that the moderates feel that the revolutionary Socialists\r\n     are a majority, that they will meet defeat in the referendum votes\r\n     and revolutionary Socialism will conquer the party.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Revolutionary Age,\" July 12, 1919, informs us that the\r\nMassachusetts Comrades were also expelled and that others in other\r\nStates were threatened:\r\n\r\n     \"Another State gone. Massachusetts is expelled for adopting the\r\n     Left Wing program at its State Convention and for refusing to\r\n     recognize the National Executive Committee's act of suspending the\r\n     Federations. For this latter offense, Pennsylvania is now\r\n     threatened with excommunication, and very likely Ohio will meet the\r\n     same sad fate.\r\n\r\n     \"It is a race against time. Will there be anything left for the\r\n     rump N. E. C. to expel by August 30th?\"\r\n\r\nRelative to the success of the Left Wing in electing its members to the\r\nnew National Executive Committee of fifteen, and to the meeting of this\r\nnew committee, \"The Revolutionary Age,\" July 19, 1919, comments as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"The election of Comrades Fraina, Hourwich, Harwood, Prevey,\r\n     Ruthenberg, Lloyd, Keracher, Batt, Hogan, Millis, Nagle,\r\n     Katterfeld, Wicks and Herman appears now to be certain, while there\r\n     is still a question about the third choice in the First District,\r\n     Comrade Lindgren leading without the New York vote.\r\n\r\n     \"There is no question, but that the final tally of the party\r\n     elections is available at the National Office, but according to the\r\n     action of the National Executive Committee this tally will not be\r\n     made known till August 30. Meanwhile the State secretaries have\r\n     published enough of the votes to leave no question of the outcome,\r\n     except as above indicated....\r\n\r\n     \"According to the party law the new N. E. C. is entitled to control\r\n     beginning July 1st....\r\n\r\n     \"There can be no legality by which a defunct Executive Committee\r\n     can keep the newly elected committee from taking office. By such\r\n     'constitutionality' the old body could perpetuate itself\r\n     indefinitely, let the members vote as they like. Stopping\r\n     referendums is the method chosen to make sure that the members\r\n     consent.\"\r\n\r\nAccusations and recriminations, charges and counter-charges, continued\r\nto fly back and forth between the two Wings, as the secretaries\r\nproceeded with the work of expulsion or suspension, carrying out the\r\nsavage instructions of the Right Wing majority of the National Executive\r\nCommittee, where Victor L. Berger, Morris Hillquit and Seymour Stedman\r\nwere the dominating leaders. On the side of the Lefts little more could\r\nbe done than to set up a howl against the \"dictatorship of the\r\nproletariat\" within the party which forced them to taste the medicine\r\nthey would have preferred to prescribe for the rest of the country.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer the Left Wing movement was hastened on, dragging the\r\nRight Wing after it, by the publication in the radical papers of America\r\nof the manifesto issued in Moscow in March, 1919, by the Third or\r\nCommunistic International in session there. Max Eastman, a Left Wing\r\nleader, in an article on \"The New International\" in \"The Liberator,\"\r\nJuly, 1919, a Left Wing magazine, thus describes the Bolshevik\r\nInternational:\r\n\r\n     \"The Communist International, which met at Moscow on March 2d,\r\n     1919, comprised thirty-two _delegates with full power to act_,\r\n     representing parties or groups in Germany, Russia, Hungary,\r\n     Sweden, Norway, Bulgaria, Rumania, Finland, Ukrainia, Esthonia,\r\n     Armenia, delegates from the 'Union of Socialists of Eastern\r\n     Countries,' from the labor organizations of Germans in Russia, and\r\n     from the Balkan 'Union of Revolutionary Socialists.'\r\n\r\n     \"There were also present _representatives with consultative powers_\r\n     from parties and groups in Switzerland, Holland, Bohemia,\r\n     Jugo-Slavia, France, Great Britain, Turkey, Turkestan, Persia,\r\n     Corea, China, and the United States (S. J. Rutgers, of the\r\n     Socialist Propaganda League, now merged with the Left Wing section\r\n     of the Socialist Party). A letter was read from Comrade Loriot, the\r\n     leader of the Left Wing section of the French Party, repudiating\r\n     the Berne Congress of the Second International.\r\n\r\n     \"The Russian Communist Party was represented by Comrades Lenine,\r\n     Trotzky, Zinoviev, Kukharin and Stalin. This party contains many\r\n     millions of organized class-conscious Socialists, more, perhaps,\r\n     than are to be found in all the rest of the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe Communist Manifesto of 1919, issued by this Moscow International,\r\nbecame the test of fellowship among the simon-pure \"Reds\" the world\r\nover, and since the campaign of the Left Wing grew into an attempt to\r\nforce the Socialist Party of America to adopt this Bolshevik program, we\r\nhere quote the salient parts of the Moscow Manifesto from the article by\r\nEastman mentioned above:\r\n\r\n     \"_To the proletariat of all countries!_\r\n\r\n     \"Seventy-two years have gone by since the Communist Party of the\r\n     World proclaimed its program in the form of the Manifesto written\r\n     by the great teachers of the proletarian revolution, Karl Marx and\r\n     Frederick Engels....\r\n\r\n     \"We Communists, representatives of the revolutionary proletariat of\r\n     the different countries of Europe, America and Asia, assembled in\r\n     Soviet Moscow, feel and consider ourselves followers and fulfillers\r\n     of the program proclaimed seventy-two years ago. It is our task now\r\n     to sum up the practical revolutionary experience of the working\r\n     class, to cleanse the movement of its admixtures of opportunism and\r\n     social patriotism, and to gather together the forces of all the\r\n     true revolutionary proletarian parties in order to further and\r\n     hasten the complete victory of the Communist revolution.\r\n\r\n     \"The opportunists who, before the war, exhorted the workers, in the\r\n     name of the gradual transition into Socialism, to be temperate;\r\n     who, during the war, asked for submission in the name of 'civil\r\n     peace' and defense of the Fatherland, now again demand of the\r\n     workers self-abnegation to overcome the terrible consequences of\r\n     the war. If this preaching were listened to by the workers,\r\n     Capitalism would build out of the bones of several generations a\r\n     new and still more formidable structure, leading to a new and\r\n     inevitable world war. Fortunately for humanity, this is no longer\r\n     possible....\r\n\r\n     \"Only the Proletarian Dictatorship, which recognizes neither\r\n     inherited privileges nor rights of property, but which arises from\r\n     the needs of the hungering masses, can shorten the period of the\r\n     present crisis; and for this purpose it mobilizes all materials and\r\n     forces, introduces the universal duty to labor, establish the\r\n     regime of industrial discipline, thus to heal in the course of a\r\n     few years the open wounds caused by the war and also to raise\r\n     humanity to new undreamed-of heights.\r\n\r\n     \"The whole bourgeois world accuses the Communists of destroying\r\n     liberties and political democracy. This is not true. Having come\r\n     into power the proletariat only asserts the absolute impossibility\r\n     of applying the methods of bourgeois democracy, and it creates the\r\n     conditions and forms of a higher _working class democracy_....\r\n\r\n     \"The peasant of Bavaria and Baden who does not look beyond his\r\n     church spire, the small French wine-grower who has been ruined by\r\n     the adulterations practiced by the big capitalists, the small\r\n     farmer of America plundered and betrayed by bankers and\r\n     legislators--all these social ranks which have been shoved aside\r\n     from the main road of development by Capitalism, are called on\r\n     paper by the regime of political democracy to the administration of\r\n     the State. In reality, however, the finance-oligarchy decides all\r\n     important questions which determine the destinies of nations behind\r\n     the back of parliamentary democracy....\r\n\r\n     \"The proletarian State, like every State, is an organ of\r\n     suppression, but it arrays itself against the enemies of the\r\n     working class. It aims to break the opposition of the despoilers of\r\n     labor, who are using every means in a desperate effort to stifle\r\n     the revolution in blood, and to make impossible further opposition.\r\n     The dictatorship of the proletariat, which gives it the favored\r\n     position in the community, is only a provisional institution. As\r\n     the opposition of the Bourgeoisie is broken, as it is expropriated\r\n     and gradually absorbed into the working groups, the proletarian\r\n     dictatorship disappears, until finally the State dies and there are\r\n     no more class distinctions....\r\n\r\n     \"In an empire of destruction where not only the means of production\r\n     and transportation, but also the institutions of political\r\n     democracy have become bloody ruins, the proletariat must create its\r\n     own forms, to serve above all as a bond of unity for the working\r\n     class and to enable it to accomplish a revolutionary intervention\r\n     in the further development of mankind. Such apparatus is\r\n     represented in the Workmen's Councils. The old parties, the old\r\n     unions, have proved incapable, in person of their leaders, to\r\n     understand, much less to carry out the task which the new epoch\r\n     presents to them. The proletariat has created a new institution\r\n     which embraces the entire working class without distinction of\r\n     vocation or political maturity, an elastic form of organization\r\n     capable of continually renewing itself, expanding, and of drawing\r\n     into itself ever new elements, ready to open its doors to the\r\n     working groups of city and village which are near to the\r\n     proletariat. This indispensable autonomous organization of the\r\n     working class in the present struggle and in the future conquests\r\n     of different lands, tests the proletariat and constitutes the\r\n     greatest inspiration and the mightiest weapon of the proletariat of\r\n     our time. Wherever the masses are awakened to consciousness,\r\n     Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Councils will be formed....\r\n\r\n     \"The outcry of the bourgeois world against the civil war and the\r\n     red terror is the most colossal hypocrisy of which the history of\r\n     political struggles can boast. There would be no civil war if the\r\n     exploiters who have carried mankind to the very brink of ruin had\r\n     not prevented every forward step of the laboring masses, if they\r\n     had not instigated plots and murders and called to their aid armed\r\n     help from outside to maintain or restore their predatory\r\n     privileges. Civil war is _forced upon_ the laboring classes by\r\n     their arch-enemies. The working class must answer blow for blow, if\r\n     it will not renounce its own object and its own future which is, at\r\n     the same time, the future of all humanity.\r\n\r\n     \"The Communist parties, far from conjuring up civil war\r\n     artificially, rather strive to shorten its duration as much as\r\n     possible--in case it has become an iron necessity--to minimize the\r\n     number of its victims, and, above all, to secure victory for the\r\n     proletariat. This makes necessary the disarming of the bourgeoisie\r\n     at the proper time, the arming of the laborer, and the formation of\r\n     a communist army as the protector of the rule of the proletariat\r\n     and the inviolability of the social structure. Such is the Red Army\r\n     of Soviet Russia which arose to protect the achievements of the\r\n     working class against every assault from within or without. The\r\n     Soviet Army is inseparable from the Soviet State.\r\n\r\n     \"Seizure of political power by the proletariat means destruction of\r\n     the political power of the bourgeoisie. The organized power of the\r\n     bourgeoisie is in the civil State, with its capitalistic army under\r\n     control of bourgeoisie-junker officers, its police and gendarmes,\r\n     jailers and judges, its priests, government officials, etc.\r\n     Conquest of the political power means not merely a change in the\r\n     personnel of ministries, but annihilation of the enemy's apparatus\r\n     of government; disarmament of the bourgeoisie of the\r\n     counter-revolutionary officers, of the White Guard; arming of the\r\n     proletariat, the revolutionary soldiers, the Red Guard of\r\n     workingmen; displacement of all bourgeois judges and organization\r\n     of proletarian courts; elimination of control by reactionary\r\n     government officials and substitution of new organs of management\r\n     of the proletariat.... Not until the proletariat has achieved this\r\n     victory and broken the resistance of the bourgeoisie can the former\r\n     enemies of the new order be made useful, by bringing them under\r\n     control of the Communist system and gradually bringing them into\r\n     accord with its work....\r\n\r\n     \"The Dictatorship of the Proletariat does not in any way call for\r\n     partition of the means of production and exchange; rather, on the\r\n     contrary, its aim is further to centralize the forces of production\r\n     and to subject all of production to a systematic plan. As the first\r\n     steps--socialization of the great banks which now control\r\n     production; the taking over by the power of the proletariat of all\r\n     government-controlled economic utilities; the transferring of all\r\n     communal enterprises; the socializing of the syndicated and\r\n     trustified units of production, as well as all other branches of\r\n     production in which the degree of concentration and centralization\r\n     of capital makes this technically practicable; the socializing of\r\n     agricultural estates and their conversion into co-operative\r\n     establishments....\r\n\r\n     \"As far as smaller enterprises are concerned, the proletariat must\r\n     gradually unite them, according to the degree of their importance.\r\n     It must be particularly emphasized that small properties will in no\r\n     way be expropriated and that small property owners who are not\r\n     exploiters of labor will not be forcibly dispossessed....\r\n\r\n     \"The task of the Proletarian Dictatorship in the economic field can\r\n     only be fulfilled to the extent that the proletariat is enabled to\r\n     create centralized organs of management and to institute workers'\r\n     control. To this end it must make use of its mass organizations\r\n     which are in closest relation to the process of production....\r\n\r\n     \"As in the field of production, so also in the field of\r\n     distribution, all qualified technicians and specialists are to be\r\n     made use of, provided their political resistance is broken and they\r\n     are still capable of adapting themselves, not to the service of\r\n     capital, but to the new system of production.... Besides\r\n     expropriating the factories, mines, estates, etc., the proletariat\r\n     must also abolish the exploitation of the people by capitalistic\r\n     landlords, transfer the large mansions to the local workers'\r\n     councils, and move the working people into the bourgeois\r\n     dwellings....\r\n\r\n     \"The capitalistic criminals asserted at the beginning of the World\r\n     War that it was only in defense of the common Fatherland. But soon\r\n     German Imperialism revealed its real brigand character by bloody\r\n     deeds in Russia, in the Ukraine and Finland. Now the Entente States\r\n     unmask themselves as world despoilers and murderers of the\r\n     proletariat....\r\n\r\n     \"Indescribable is the White Terror of the bourgeois cannibals.\r\n     Incalculable are the sacrifices of the working class. Their\r\n     best--Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg--they have lost. Against this the\r\n     proletariat must defend itself, defend at any price. The Communist\r\n     International calls the whole world proletariat to this final\r\n     struggle.\r\n\r\n     \"Down with the imperialistic conspiracy of capital!\r\n\r\n     \"Long live the International Republic of the Proletarian Councils!\"\r\n\r\nAs will be seen when we study the I. W. W., the above is the program of\r\nthe world-wide conspiracy of a single class, a minority of society, to\r\ncarry out the cynical purpose of I. W. W.'ism--to \"take possession of\r\nthe earth and the machinery of production.\"\r\n\r\nMorris Hillquit, a Right Wing leader of the Socialist Party of America,\r\ndeclared that \"The Communist Congress of Moscow made the mistake of\r\nattempting a sort of dictatorship of the Russian proletariat in the\r\nSocialist International and was conspicuously inept and unhappy in the\r\nchoice of certain allies and in the exclusion of others.\"[E]\r\n\r\nQuoting this, Max Eastman, in the article from which we have taken so\r\nmuch, makes the following reply:\r\n\r\n     \"How can he expect them to be any more indefinite and generous in\r\n     their invitation than they were? In every country where there was a\r\n     doubt as to what groups had stood true to the revolutionary\r\n     principle and the principle of Internationalism, they so indicated\r\n     the alignment as to leave every Socialist free to consider himself\r\n     their ally who seriously and courageously desired to. This was what\r\n     they did in America. The S. L. P. (Socialist Labor Party), the\r\n     Socialist Propaganda League, the I. W. W. and in the Socialist\r\n     Party 'the followers of Debs!' Could they in a brief word open the\r\n     door wider to American Socialists, unless they wished to admit\r\n     prominent members of the Socialist Party who were known to have\r\n     repudiated them, as Berger did, declaring his solidarity with the\r\n     Mensheviks who were waging war on them?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nBIRTH OF THE COMMUNIST AND COMMUNIST-LABOR PARTIES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 24, 1919, the Left Wing Conference assembled in New York City.\r\nThe purpose of the Conference was for the first time to unite the forces\r\nof the Left Wing throughout the country and to decide upon a common plan\r\nof action against the Right. For some time there had been a growing\r\ndesire among the members of the Left for the formation of a new party to\r\nbe known as the Communist Party. The Michigan State organization and the\r\ndifferent Russian-speaking federations, which had either been expelled\r\nor suspended, were particularly anxious for a new party. Then, too, many\r\nmembers of the Left Wing throughout the country believed that, even\r\nthough they were more numerous than those of the Right, it would be\r\nuseless to try to control the National Emergency Convention of the\r\nSocialist Party, called for August 30, 1919, in Chicago. They feared\r\nthat the credentials of the still unsuspended and unexpelled Left Wing\r\ndelegates would not be recognized by the party machine in the hands of\r\nthe Right Wing, and, moreover, that even if they were, these Left Wing\r\ndelegates would not be in the majority because so many other Left Wing\r\ndelegates had been expelled from the Party.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the beginning of the National Conference of the Left Wing the\r\nMichigan State delegates and the delegates of the foreign-language\r\nfederations insisted on the immediate organization of a new party to be\r\nknown as the Communist Party. The majority of the delegates, however,\r\nwere opposed to immediate organization, claiming that it would be much\r\nmore prudent to wait till the meeting of the National Emergency\r\nConvention, at the end of August, as many Left Wing Socialists would\r\nrefuse to leave the mother party until it became evident that the\r\nConvention could not be captured by the Left Wing. The majority of the\r\ndelegates decided to call a Communist Party Convention on September 1,\r\n1919. The Michigan State delegates and the Russian-speaking federation\r\ndelegates thereupon broke with the majority of the Left Wing, causing a\r\nserious split, which continued till about the end of July, 1919.\r\n\r\nIn that month, however, most of the members of the National Council of\r\nthe Left Wing who had been leading the faction of the Left Wing which\r\nhad refused the call for the immediate formation of the Communist Party,\r\nwent over to the minority faction, which included the Michigan State\r\norganization and the Russian-speaking federations. A compromise had been\r\nreached whereby the aforesaid members of the National Council agreed not\r\nto insist upon attendance at the National Emergency Convention of the\r\nSocialist Party, while the Michigan organization, together with the\r\nfederations, were willing to wait till September 1, 1919, for the\r\nconvention of the Communist Party.\r\n\r\nEven on these terms John Reed, Ben Gitlow and some other leading members\r\nof the Left Wing refused to go over to the Communist Party, having\r\ndecided to fight for the rights of the Left Wingers in the National\r\nEmergency Convention of the Socialist Party. This group of Left Wingers\r\nlater on, as will be seen, became the nucleus of a third party, the\r\nCommunist Labor Party. Several statements from the joint call for the\r\nconvention of the Communist Party, cited from \"The Revolutionary Age,\"\r\nAugust 23, 1919, will interest the reader:\r\n\r\n     \"The party will be founded upon the following principles:\r\n\r\n     \"The present is the period of the dissolution and collapse of the\r\n     whole capitalist world system, which will mean the collapse of\r\n     world culture, if capitalism with its unsolvable contradictions is\r\n     not replaced by Communism.\r\n\r\n     \"The problem of the proletariat consists in organizing and training\r\n     itself for the conquest of the powers of the state....\r\n\r\n     \"This new proletarian state must embody the dictatorship of the\r\n     proletariat, both industrial and agricultural, this dictatorship\r\n     constituting the instrument for the taking over of property used\r\n     for exploiting the workers, and for the reorganization of society\r\n     on a Communist basis....\r\n\r\n     \"The dictatorship of the proletariat shall carry out the abolition\r\n     of private property in the means of production and distribution, by\r\n     transfer to the proletarian state under Socialist administration of\r\n     the working class....\r\n\r\n     \"The present world situation demands the closest relation between\r\n     the revolutionary proletariat of all countries....\r\n\r\n     \"We favor international alliance of the Communist Party of the\r\n     United States only with the Communist groups of other countries,\r\n     such as the Bolsheviki of Russia, Spartacans of Germany, etc....\r\n\r\n     \"The party shall propagandize class-conscious industrial unionism,\r\n     and shall carry on party activity in cooperation with industrial\r\n     disputes that take on a revolutionary character.\"\r\n\r\nThe national organ of the Communist Party was \"The Communist\" of\r\nChicago. In its issue of August 23, 1919, it thus criticises the\r\nSocialist Party:\r\n\r\n     \"The majority of the readers of 'The Communist' are familiar with\r\n     the form of organization of the old Socialist Party, with its state\r\n     autonomy and its bureaucratic officialdom. Every state is\r\n     practically organized as an Independent Socialist party. 'Official\r\n     socialism' of Milwaukee is entirely different from[6] 'official\r\n     socialism' in Ohio, both in regard to platforms and form of\r\n     organization. Every state has a 'Socialism' of its own brand, and\r\n     even dues are not uniform throughout the country. 'Official papers'\r\n     of the party are in most cases organs of independent associations,\r\n     not at all affiliated with the central party organizations. Such\r\n     important weapons in the struggle of the proletariat are left in\r\n     the hands of the petty bourgeois ideologists who, in reality,\r\n     prostitute the labor press. As examples, we have, for instance,\r\n     'The Milwaukee Leader,' the 'New York Call,' the Jewish 'Daily\r\n     Forward,' the 'Appeal to Reason,' and many others scattered\r\n     throughout the United States, and each contradicting not only the\r\n     others, but containing in each issue glaring contradictions that an\r\n     intelligent person who reads them becomes disgusted with the whole\r\n     muddled mess.\"\r\n\r\nThe fight among the revolutionists was a fight to the finish. The\r\nleaders all wanted to become Trotzkys and Lenines, all wanted to be\r\nbosses. It seems reasonable to conclude that if Bolshevism were ever\r\nintroduced into the United States, either by the mother Socialist Party\r\nor by its offspring, the Communist Party or the Communist Labor Party,\r\nthe dictatorship of the proletariat, that wonderful piece of nonsense\r\nwhich we hear so much about, would be grasped at by an amazing number of\r\ncompetitors. In Russia Lenine and Trotzky seem to constitute the\r\nDictatorship of the Proletariat. In the Socialist Party of the United\r\nStates Berger and Hillquit, of the old National Executive Committee,\r\nconstituted a first-class dictatorship. In the Communist Party, Dennis\r\nBatt, lately jailed, and Alexander Stoklitsky would surely give the\r\nCommunist rank and file plenty to do--everything of course being done\r\naccording to their wills. John Reed and Ben Gitlow would make an ideal\r\n\"dictatorship of the proletariat,\" if the Communist Labor Party ever\r\nmade Bolshevism the law of the land.\r\n\r\n\"Truth,\" one of the organs of the Communist Labor Party, published in\r\nDuluth, Minn., in its issue of August 29, 1919, devotes nearly two of\r\nits eight pages to bitter attacks on the Communist Party. Two short\r\nquotations will suffice to show the spirit of envy that exists:\r\n\r\n     \"'Tis said that distance lends enchantment, and perhaps that is the\r\n     reason why some of you in the East have responded to the\r\n     cuckoo-call of Michigan-Federations. Frankly, we see nothing\r\n     hopeful in the alignment presented by the Michigan-Federation\r\n     combine. We are fearful of the consequence of such leadership. The\r\n     so-called Communist Party, as it is now constituted and especially\r\n     with the accretion of a part of the National Council, presents the\r\n     prettiest bunch of 'eligibles' that man ever laid eyes upon. And as\r\n     I gaze upon this august array of talent, I wonder where the working\r\n     class is going to get off at. We of the left wing of Cook County\r\n     are reluctant to join with an organization under the guidance of a\r\n     few doctrinaires from Detroit and the would-be Lenine of the United\r\n     States.[F] We do not consider that the welfare of the revolutionary\r\n     movement would be zealously guarded in their hands.\"\r\n\r\nFrom \"Truth,\" of the same date, we also quote an open letter to Louis C.\r\nFraina, which reads in part as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Do you know how the Russian Federation is being ruled? Do you know\r\n     that a 'firing squad' is constantly on the job expelling members\r\n     and branches from the Federation who dare to disagree on anything\r\n     with the would-be bosses of the Russian Federation?...\r\n\r\n     \"Do you know that a regular secret service system is being employed\r\n     by these 'bosses' to hunt down the undesirables?\r\n\r\n     \"Do you know that a worse than military censorship is being\r\n     maintained in the domain of Stocklitzky (the Northwestern States),\r\n     where it is prohibited to the branches to communicate with each\r\n     other or to send out or receive any correspondence otherwise than\r\n     through the hands of the censors, the Executive Committee, and that\r\n     this censorship committee, like the imperialists in the world's\r\n     war, are holding up the mail of these branches and do not deliver\r\n     at all the 'undesirable' mail?\"\r\n\r\nAugust 30, 1919, the day for the assembling of the National Emergency\r\nConvention of the Socialist Party, at last arrived. Delegates of the\r\nRight Wing, and many of the Left, including John Reed, I. E. Ferguson\r\nand Rose Pastor Stokes, were present. The Left Wing delegates, to the\r\nnumber of about 84, arrived early at the place of meeting, Machinists'\r\nHall, 113 South Ashland Boulevard, Chicago. Trouble immediately began,\r\nfor the seats being occupied by the Left Wingers, the members of the\r\nRight were crowded out.\r\n\r\nGermer and Gerber of the Right seem to have lost their heads. \"The\r\nChicago Herald and Examiner,\" of August 31, 1919, informs us that Adolph\r\nGermer, National Secretary of the Socialist Party and one of the leading\r\nmembers of the Right Wing, called in the police, who cleared the hall.\r\n\"The Chicago Tribune\" of the same day tells us that everybody was\r\nexchanging fisticuffs when the police arrived. Detective Sergeant\r\nLawrence McDonough, head of the anarchist squad, with the aid of a dozen\r\nuniformed policemen, seems to have saved the day for the Right Wingers.\r\nJohn Reed, of the Left Wing, was furious, and \"The Call,\" New York,\r\nAugust 31, 1919, tells us that he issued a statement which he addressed\r\nto the delegates of the Emergency Convention:\r\n\r\n     \"We address you to inform you of occurrences this morning which\r\n     every Revolutionary Socialist on the floor of this convention will\r\n     protest against.\r\n\r\n     \"Delegates from Illinois, Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, Ohio,\r\n     Nebraska, California and other states entered the convention floor\r\n     and took their seats in readiness for the opening of the\r\n     convention.\r\n\r\n     \"At nearly 10 o'clock Gerber of New York and Goebel of New Jersey,\r\n     who were at the door and attempted to refuse the above named\r\n     delegates admission, called the police and these delegations were\r\n     ejected from the hall by police power, many of them being roughly\r\n     handled.\"\r\n\r\nPress reports inform us that after the belligerents had calmed down the\r\nmeeting was again convened, and that Victor Berger, in referring to the\r\nLefts, said: \"They're just a lot of anarchists; we are the party.\"\r\nBerger did not say whether or not by the word \"we\" he meant the old\r\nNational Executive Committee, which should have gone out of office in\r\nJuly,[G] but seemed to have given itself a \"mandate\" to run the National\r\nEmergency Convention.\r\n\r\nOn August 31, 1919, the hot-heads and sore-heads again assembled, and a\r\ndispute arose as to who called the \"cops.\" As a result the Left Wingers\r\nnext met by themselves downstairs, on the first floor of the hall, while\r\nthe Right Wingers remained higher up on the second floor. On the same\r\nday the Minnesota group was seated by the Convention, but was denied a\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nOn September 1st the high climbers of the Right Wing purged the party\r\nstill more by unseating the Washington State delegation and expelled\r\nKatterfield \"for the good of the party.\" The California delegates then\r\nthrew a bomb into the Right Wing Convention by announcing that they\r\nwould not take their seats until all of the contested delegations were\r\nseated and the police were withdrawn from the hall. These delegates\r\nfinally went down to the first floor and joined ranks with the Left\r\nWingers there, this section henceforth being known as the Communist\r\nLabor Party.\r\n\r\nOn the same day the Convention of the Communist Party assembled at\r\nSmolny Institute, 1221 Blue Island Avenue, Chicago. Red flags were\r\ndisplayed and Bolshevist songs were sung until the police of the\r\nanarchist squad finally demanded the removal of the blood-colored\r\nstandards of revolt.\r\n\r\n\"The Call\" informs us that on the next day, September 2nd, the Communist\r\nParty, composed of the Michigan crowd, the Russian Federation and the\r\nformer Left Wing National Council, nearly split in two when, at a\r\nconcerted signal, there resigned from the emergency committee of the\r\nconvention, Louis C. Fraina, C. E. Ruthenberg, I. E. Ferguson,\r\nMaximilian Cohen, S. Elbaum and A. Selakowich, and, from other offices,\r\nA. Paul of Queens and Fannie Horowitz. It seems that these members were\r\nanxious to have the Communist Party amalgamate with the Communist Labor\r\nParty, but that the foreign federations, fearing that they would be\r\noutnumbered by the English-speaking members, were very much opposed to\r\nthe union.\r\n\r\nOn this same day Dennis Batt, one of the principal leaders of the\r\nCommunist Party, was jailed.\r\n\r\nMoreover, on the 2nd of September the Communist Labor Party--the group\r\nthat had first met with the Right Wing, and, later on, down stairs on\r\nthe first floor of the hall on South Ashland Boulevard--assembled at the\r\nI. W. W. Hall at 119 Throop street. This party, heart and soul, is in\r\nfavor of the propagation of Bolshevism and I. W. W.'ism in the United\r\nStates, and if not completely broken up by the Government, seems\r\ndestined to become more numerous than either the rapidly disintegrating\r\nSocialist Party or the Communist Party, which is principally made up of\r\nforeigners who speak the various Russian languages. The principal\r\nleaders of the Communist Labor Party are John Reed, William Bross Lloyd,\r\nformerly known as the millionaire Socialist, and Benjamin Gitlow.[H] It\r\nseemed likely, too, that Fraina, Ferguson, Ruthenberg and Cohen,\r\nprominent \"Reds,\" who resigned from the emergency committee of the\r\nCommunist Party, would soon be found among the leaders of the Communist\r\nLabor Party. At the time of the convention no national organ of the\r\nCommunist Labor Party had yet begun publication, but \"The Voice of\r\nLabor,\" edited by Reed and Gitlow, and \"Truth,\" formerly the Socialist\r\npaper of Duluth, were local organs.\r\n\r\nBoth the Communist Party and the Communist Labor Party are strongly\r\nBolshevist. The Communist Labor Party is decidedly more in favor of the\r\nI. W. W. than the Communist Party; but the main differences between\r\nthese two parties seems to be a matter of race, language, and especially\r\nof personal jealousy and dislike among the leaders.\r\n\r\nFor years the Socialist Party and the Socialist Labor Party have\r\nremained separated from each other, so that now, with the two new\r\nparties, the Communist Party and the Communist Labor Party, there are\r\nfour parties of rebels, all plotting a revolution against our National\r\nGovernment, while the great body of the American people sleep and dream.\r\n\r\nQuite a number of educated people in the United States, including the\r\neditors of some of our leading dailies, seem to think that the remnant\r\nof the Socialist Party is not at all a Bolshevist organization and not\r\nat all revolutionary in character. They are very much deceived, having\r\nlet the crafty, deceptive, hypocritical leaders of the Right Wing fool\r\nthem badly. The Left Wingers have indeed been much more open in\r\nadmitting their intentions to overthrow our government by force of arms.\r\nThey are dangerous, but perhaps not nearly so much so as the slippery\r\n\"Yellows,\" cunning weasels of the imported Russian Hillquit type, who,\r\nthough they do not talk as openly as the \"Reds,\" are spreading their\r\nsubversive principles on every side, and especially among the less\r\neducated classes of our people, into whose minds they instil the spirit\r\nof hatred between employers and employees, while at the same time\r\nencouraging strikes, wherever they can, with the hope of overthrowing\r\nour Government when conditions become sufficiently critical. Both\r\nparties of the Socialists and both parties of the Communists, along with\r\nthe I. W. W., are all revolutionary in the strictest sense, and the\r\nsooner the American people wake up to the fact and take some intelligent\r\naction to stamp them out, the better it will be. It is not yet too late,\r\nbut soon may be.\r\n\r\nThe Bolshevist Socialists of Russia and the two new parties of\r\nSocialists that at Chicago in September, 1919, seceded from the mother\r\nparty, have all adopted the name, \"Communist,\" which \"The Call,\" New\r\nYork, July 24, 1919, informs us was used by Marx and Engels, the\r\nfounders of modern Socialism, adding that though the name is somewhat\r\nconfusing, inasmuch as the word has another and a distinct meaning in\r\nEnglish, still, \"wherever it is used it means revolutionary Socialists\r\nas distinguished from Social patriots and mere parliamentary\r\nSocialists.\" Is this definition an alibi for Hillquit and Berger?\r\n\r\nMany persons have hastily assumed that the main reason why the Left and\r\nRight Wings of the Socialists fought each other like cats and dogs was\r\nthat the Right Wing members of the party are opposed to Bolshevism. This\r\nis nonsense. The Socialist papers of the country, Right and Left, with\r\nthe possible exception of the once powerful \"Appeal to Reason,\" which in\r\nrecent years has fallen into great discredit among Socialists because it\r\nfavored our entrance into the World War--have been and still are\r\nadvocating Bolshevism every day. If anyone has any doubt, let him read\r\nany of the rebel sheets.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Party of St. Louis, in its appeal for party unity,\r\npublished in \"The Call,\" July 19, 1919, informs us that the Socialist\r\nParty is whole-heartedly with the Russian Bolshevists and their cause:\r\n\r\n     \"Promptly, and notwithstanding all obstacles and persecution, the\r\n     Socialist party hurried to the front in defense of the cause of our\r\n     Russian Comrades. Mass meetings were held, demonstrations in behalf\r\n     of Soviet Russia were arranged, our Socialist press gave all\r\n     possible support to counteract the sinister work of the American\r\n     capitalist press.\"\r\n\r\nEugene V. Debs, many times the presidential candidate of the Socialists\r\nand the idol of \"Reds\" and \"Yellows\" alike, has all along been an ardent\r\nBolshevist. Listen to these words of his in his article, \"The Day of the\r\nPeople,\" published in many Socialist papers in the early part of 1919,\r\nand taken by us from the March number of \"Party News,\" the official\r\norgan of the Socialist Party of Philadelphia:\r\n\r\n     \"In Russia and Germany our valiant Comrades are leading the\r\n     proletarian revolution, which knows no race, no color, no sex and\r\n     no boundary lines. They are setting the heroic example for\r\n     world-wide emulation. Let us, like them, scorn and repudiate the\r\n     cowardly compromisers within our ranks, challenge and defy the\r\n     robber-class power, and fight it out on that line to victory or\r\n     death!\r\n\r\n     \"From the crown of my head to the soles of my feet I am Bolshevik,\r\n     and am proud of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe report of the Right Wing majority of the old National Executive\r\nCommittee of the Socialist Party, made to the National Emergency\r\nConvention, and here quoted from \"The Call,\" September 3, 1919, contains\r\nthe following defense of their Bolshevism, against the aspersions of the\r\nLeft Wing leaders who had challenged the committee's attitude toward\r\nRussia:\r\n\r\n     \"Ever since the revolution in Russia, the party has hailed it as\r\n     the first great gift of the International. At every meeting of the\r\n     National Executive Committee held since the second revolution in\r\n     Russia [the revolution which put Lenine and Trotzky in power] the\r\n     committee has issued some ringing declaration in favor of the\r\n     workers' and peasants' government in Russia....\r\n\r\n     \"Rarely has a meeting been held under party auspices that our\r\n     speakers have not taken advantage of it to present the claims and\r\n     achievements of the Russian revolution. The party's position may be\r\n     easily ascertained by consulting the party bulletins and the party\r\n     press.\"\r\n\r\nThe Executive Committeemen who signed this defense of the committee's\r\nBolshevist complexion were Victor L. Berger, Seymour Stedman, James\r\nOneal, A. Shiplacoff, Dan Hogan, John M. Work, Frederick Krafft and\r\nGeorge H. Goebel. These, with Morris Hillquit, were the men who had\r\nviolently expelled or suspended tens of thousands of members of the\r\nparty without warrant of the party Constitution and without granting a\r\ntrial or the right of self-defense to those thus dealt with; who had\r\nmaintained themselves in office after July 1, 1919, in express violation\r\nof the party Constitution, having suppressed announcement of the result\r\nof the referendum vote by the rank and file to elect executive\r\ncommitteemen, by which vote Left Wing committeemen had been elected, as\r\nthe report to the National Emergency Convention of the Right Wing\r\ncommittee appointed to investigate this referendum had to acknowledge;\r\nand who, by these devices and a similar high-handedness committed by\r\nthemselves and friendly delegates had seized control of the National\r\nEmergency Convention and organized it in their own interest.\r\n\r\nIn their report to the convention they further defended themselves\r\nagainst the Left Wing charge that this majority of the Executive\r\nCommittee had allied itself with the Berne Conference. Under this head\r\nthe above-mentioned committeemen say:\r\n\r\n     \"While no definite date may be set for the beginning of the present\r\n     party dissension, it is certain that they began to be generally\r\n     noticeable in January of this year [1919], when the National\r\n     Executive Committee elected delegates to the Berne Conference owing\r\n     to the fact that the delegates elected by referendum could not\r\n     serve, and the assembling of the Berne Conference in March made\r\n     necessary the election of delegates by the National Executive\r\n     Committee.\r\n\r\n     \"The so-called Left Wing members of the National Executive\r\n     Committee participated in the election, nominating and voting for\r\n     candidates. None of their nominees were elected, and shortly after\r\n     the election an organized attack was made against the international\r\n     delegates by the Left Wing....\r\n\r\n     \"The National Executive Committee, in session, decided that if our\r\n     delegates arrived at Berne in time and the conference failed to\r\n     take the position of the party on war and imperialism, we were to\r\n     withdraw with any other elements favoring a genuine working-class\r\n     International. It was agreed that we would not affiliate with any\r\n     International that excluded the Russian Comrades, who were fighting\r\n     world imperialism, or the Comrades opposed to the Ebert-Scheidemann\r\n     regime in Germany.\r\n\r\n     \"Before our delegates could leave the country, the National\r\n     Executive Committee learned that the Berne Conference had failed to\r\n     respond to its opportunity.... Learning this, the National\r\n     Executive Committee decided to send one delegate abroad to impart\r\n     information to the Comrades in Europe, informing them of our\r\n     attitude on international questions.\"[I]....\r\n\r\n     \"Yet, despite all this, a systematic campaign of falsehood has been\r\n     waged against the party by a faction within the party. This faction\r\n     has falsely claimed that the party is allied with the Berne\r\n     Conference.... They have denounced the party and its officials as\r\n     an organization of 'Scheidemanns' and 'Noskes,' asserting that if\r\n     the party were intrusted with public power it would murder our own\r\n     Comrades with machine guns and hand grenades....\r\n\r\n     \"These slanders have been accompanied with a similar propaganda\r\n     regarding Russia. The party and its officials, especially the\r\n     members of the National Executive Committee, have been charged with\r\n     being 'Kolchaks' and 'counter-revolutionists,' the implication\r\n     being that the party has been committed to counter-revolution in\r\n     Russia, allied intervention, and support of Kolchak in Siberia.\r\n\r\n     \"As in the case of Germany, so in the case of Russia, the National\r\n     Executive Committee and the party in general have opposed\r\n     intervention in Russia or support of Kolchak and have supported the\r\n     Russian Comrades at the head of the Soviet power against a campaign\r\n     of international lying.\r\n\r\n     \"There has never been a single utterance of the National Executive\r\n     Committee quoted by the Left Wing to support these slanders. The\r\n     Comrades may rest assured that this faction would quote the\r\n     National Executive Committee if it could.\"\r\n\r\nIt is technically true that the Left Wing writers were not able to quote\r\nthe Executive Committee as such; but they could and did quote the\r\ndominating leaders of the Right Wing majority of the Executive\r\nCommittee, Hillquit and Berger, through their organs, the \"Call\" and\r\n\"Leader\"--\"The Call\" as characterizing the Bolsheviki as \"anarchists\"\r\nand Berger as proclaiming his solidarity with the Mensheviki--and we\r\nhave nowhere seen any evidence that these leaders could purge the record\r\nof these charges. That these leaders _were_ the Executive Committee, to\r\nall intents and purposes, seems abundantly shown by their ruthless use\r\nof it to smash the party, going so far as to cast out nearly two-thirds\r\nof the entire party membership to get rid of their accusers, the Left\r\nWing leaders.\r\n\r\nThis scandal and disaster to a cause they pretended to serve are logical\r\noutcomes of a double hypocrisy--an effort to fool the voting public and\r\nour Government officials by a pretense of moderation in papers and\r\nelectioneering speeches, while at the same time fooling the dues-paying\r\nrank and file of their party with expressions of loyalty to radicalism.\r\n\r\nThe significant facts in estimating the revolutionary character of the\r\nAmerican Socialist Party, as recruited and indoctrinated by its\r\ndouble-faced leaders are two: the fact that as lately as September,\r\n1919, some 70,000 of their pupils graduated into the open course of\r\nrevolutionary violence adopted by the Communist Party of America and the\r\nCommunist Labor Party, and the fact that the more manageable 40,000\r\nremaining with these leaders were so much like their seceding Comrades\r\nthat their leaders were compelled to defend their own radicalism in the\r\nfashion above shown, and were also compelled, as we shall soon see, to\r\ntake an open stand for revolution and I. W. W.'ism in order to keep even\r\nthe remnant of the party from deserting them.\r\n\r\nThus a serious mistake has been made by the many who fancy that the\r\n\"Yellow\" Socialists--Hillquit's Right Wing which still constitutes the\r\nSocialist Party of America--are not plotters who work for a revolution\r\nto overthrow our Government. Of course they are, and any one who has\r\nread the Socialist papers and publications, even to a very limited\r\ndegree, may easily see that these alleged \"moderates\" appear such only\r\nin contrast with the more rabid \"Red\" rebels of the Left; and that the\r\none object of Right and Left alike is to stir up discontent and foment\r\nhatred of class against class precisely in order that a rebellion may\r\nsome day break out.\r\n\r\nTrue it is that the crafty leaders of the Right do not act as\r\nimprudently as the hot-headed leaders of the Left, for they fear lest\r\nrashness should precipitate them in a premature and unsuccessful\r\noutbreak; yet they are sowing the seed of revolution as certainly as are\r\nthe Communists, and perhaps with much more success, because they proceed\r\nmore prudently. Once in a while, when they are off their guard, the \"cat\r\nescapes from the bag.\" As an example we quote from an article that\r\nappeared in the May Day, 1919, issue of \"The Call,\" the paper founded\r\nand controlled by Hillquit, the foxy leader of the Rights:\r\n\r\n     \"The world revolution, dreamed of as a thing of the distant future,\r\n     has become a live reality, rising from the graves of the murdered\r\n     millions and the misery and suffering of the surviving millions. It\r\n     has taken form, it strikes forward, borne on by the despair of the\r\n     masses and the shining example of the martyrs. Its spread is\r\n     irrepressible. The bridges are burnt behind the old capitalist\r\n     society and its path is forever cut off. Capitalist society is\r\n     bankrupt, and the only salvation of humanity lies in the uprising\r\n     of the masses, in the victory of the Socialist revolution, in the\r\n     revolutionary forces of Socialism.\r\n\r\n     \"The World War, which is now about to be officially closed, has\r\n     slid into a condition neither war nor peace. However the war of\r\n     nations has been followed by the war of the classes. The class\r\n     struggle is no longer fought by resolutions and demonstrations.\r\n     Threateningly it marches through the streets of the great cities\r\n     for life or death.\"\r\n\r\nYet the Right Wing papers, on the whole, are much more reserved than\r\nthose of the Left. As an example of the openness with which the Left\r\nWing or Communist papers instigate rebellion, a quotation from \"The\r\nCommunist,\" Chicago, April 1, 1919, will interest the reader:\r\n\r\n     \"The Communist Propaganda League of Chicago came into existence on\r\n     November 7, 1918, first anniversary of the Russian Soviet Socialist\r\n     Republic, and the very day of the German Revolution.\r\n\r\n     \"A group of Socialist Party officials and active party members came\r\n     together for consultation as to ways and means for giving the\r\n     American Socialist movement a revolutionary character in harmony\r\n     with all the significance of November 7th, the most glorious date\r\n     in all history. At the hour of that little meeting bedlam reigned\r\n     in the streets of Chicago by premature celebration of peace. The\r\n     calling of this meeting during the mass tumult of November 7th is\r\n     prophetic of the revolutionary vision which brought these Comrades\r\n     together. On that day the seething proletariat ruled Chicago by\r\n     sheer force of numbers. One thing alone was needed to give this\r\n     mass expression identity with the proletarian uprisings of\r\n     Europe--one thing: the revolutionary idea!\r\n\r\n     \"The Communist Propaganda League is an organization for the\r\n     propagation of the revolutionary idea. The civilization of tomorrow\r\n     is with unorganized masses who greeted the news of peace and\r\n     revolution in Germany with what may be safely described as the\r\n     greatest spontaneous expression of mass sentiment ever witnessed in\r\n     America. To give direction and inspiration to the advancing and\r\n     irresistible army of the preletariat is the mission to which this\r\n     League is dedicated.\"\r\n\r\nThis League, with the millionaire Socialist, William Bross Lloyd, at its\r\nhead, became part of the Communist Labor Party.\r\n\r\nThe indications are that the Communist Labor Party, had it been left\r\nundisturbed by our Government, would soon have surpassed in numbers the\r\nremnant left in the old Socialist Party, whose dues-paying membership\r\ndwindled from 109,589 in January, 1919, to 39,750 by July of the same\r\nyear. Evidently, when the Left Wing secession occurred, a few real\r\nrebels came out of the Socialist Party, which used to boast in election\r\ncampaigns that it was merely a party of evolution, not of revolution.\r\nThose who still remain in the old party are rebels, too, but the rank\r\nand file is restrained by seasoned leaders, who are more prudent but\r\nless honest than the hot-headed Communists.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists now have in the country four revolutionary organizations:\r\nthe Socialist Party, the Socialist Labor Party, the Communist Party and\r\nthe Communist Labor Party. The scum of the land, the wrecks and wreckers\r\nof civilization, deluded ignoramuses, thus find ample opportunity for\r\nselecting an organization of rebellion in which there is \"no political\r\ncorruption.\" The members of these parties find fault with everything\r\nunder the Stars and Stripes, and yet hesitate to pass over to Russia and\r\nlive under the bloody standard of Lenine and Trotzky. If these four\r\nrebel parties do not suffice for some of the rebels, there still remains\r\nthe I. W. W. All are pretty much the same, their principal differences\r\nbeing the varying degrees of hypocrisy, boldness and lust for power of\r\ntheir leaders.\r\n\r\nThe open and pronounced revolutionary character of the I. W. W.,\r\nCommunist Party and Communist Labor Party, evidenced in their\r\ninflammatory utterances and tactics, had established their criminal\r\nstatus with our National and State police and legal departments, while\r\nstartling wholesale arrests, deportations and indictments of these three\r\nclasses of law-breakers soon impressed a recognition of their criminal\r\nstatus upon the public mind. It is important to establish the further\r\nfact, if it be one, that the only difference between the rank and file\r\nof these organizations and the rank and file of the remnant still\r\nattached to the Socialist Party of America is the difference between\r\ntweedledee and tweedledum.\r\n\r\nThe late inquiry into the qualifications of five suspended Socialists to\r\nsit as law-makers in the New York Assembly created an astonishing\r\nfurore, disclosing amazing ignorance concerning American Socialism among\r\nour most intelligent citizens. The confusion of the public mind was\r\nstill further increased by the Attorney-General of the United States,\r\nwhose convincing characterization of the two Communist parties, given\r\nout on January 23, 1920, contained the following sentence:\r\n\r\n     \"Certainly such an organization as the Communist Party of America\r\n     and also the Communist Labor Party cannot be construed to fall\r\n     within the same category as the Socialist Party of America, which\r\n     latter organization is pledged to the accomplishment of changes of\r\n     the Government by lawful and rightful means.\"\r\n\r\nBut can the facts so far brought out in this book \"be construed\" as\r\nindicating any substantial difference between the 39,000 or 40,000\r\nSocialists who have kept their old party name and the 70,000 or 72,000\r\nwho separated from them in September, 1919? Up to the moment of\r\nseparation were not all alike under the same \"pledge\" to use \"lawful and\r\nrightful means?\" But if this public profession of lawfulness meant\r\nnothing to 70,000 of them, why think it means more to the rest?\r\n\r\nWe have the further striking evidence, shown above, that the leaders who\r\nhad compromised their attitude toward Bolshevism felt compelled, in\r\norder to hold any of the rank and file, to argue that \"the National\r\nExecutive Committee and the party in general\" had \"supported the Russian\r\nComrades at the head of the Soviet power.\" Yet in spite of this defense\r\nthe old National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party was rebuked\r\nand kicked out of office during the Emergency Convention, even by\r\ndelegates who were friendly to the compromised leaders. The \"Call,\"\r\nSeptember 5, 1919, gives some of the details:\r\n\r\n     \"The rebuke of the National Executive Committee was in the form of\r\n     an amendment to the original motion to adopt its report. The\r\n     amendment carried by 63 to 39....\r\n\r\n     \"Perhaps Frederick Haller expressed the general sentiment of the\r\n     convention when he said:\r\n\r\n     \"'We must endorse this supplemental report of the National\r\n     Executive Committee, but we must go back to our constituents and\r\n     tell them that we gave the National Executive Committee hell.'\"\r\n\r\nThese \"constituents,\" the rank and file, determine the character of the\r\nparty, and not the thimble-rigging games of their political leaders, who\r\nsupport themselves and have \"made a good thing\" out of Socialism by\r\ncarrying water on one shoulder for gullible voters, and on the other for\r\ntheir credulous disciples. This is not the first time that self-serving,\r\nhypocritical teachers, in compassing sea and land to make proselytes,\r\nhave made them twofold more the children of hell than themselves.\r\n\r\nThe National Emergency Convention of 1919 affords still other evidence\r\nof the mind of the rank and file of the Socialist Party in the report of\r\nthe committee which investigated the referendum vote of 1919 which the\r\nold National Executive Committee had suppressed. The \"Call,\" September\r\n1, 1919, says:\r\n\r\n     \"The report states that on the face of the returns, referendum B\r\n     and D were carried by large majorities, and a National Executive\r\n     Committee, consisting of Louis Fraina of New York, Charles E.\r\n     Ruthenberg of Cleveland, Seymour Stedman of Chicago, Patrick S.\r\n     Nagle of Oklahoma and L. E. Katterfeld of Cleveland was elected.\r\n     The returns also showed on their face that John Reed and Louis\r\n     Fraina had been elected as the party's international delegates and\r\n     Kate Richards O'Hare its international secretary.\"\r\n\r\nThus the party was \"Red\" or Left-Wingish \"by large majorities,\" and was\r\ndistinctly Bolshevist, as we learn from the \"Call's\" explanation of\r\n\"referendum B and D,\" which \"were carried by large majorities.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Referendum B put the question of holding a National Emergency\r\n     Convention up to the membership. Referendum D asked the membership\r\n     to decide whether the party should record itself as being opposed\r\n     to entering any other international Socialist alignment than that\r\n     of the Third National [International?] which held its first\r\n     conference at Moscow early in March.\r\n\r\n     \"Its adoption means that the Socialist party will not take part in\r\n     any international conference from which the Bolsheviki of Russia\r\n     and the Spartacans of Germany are excluded, or in which they refuse\r\n     to participate.\"\r\n\r\nThus at the Emergency Convention of August-September, 1919, the\r\nSocialist Party of America was tied to the will of the Russian\r\nBolshevists and the German Spartacides, who held the powers of approval\r\nand veto in deciding what internationals the members of the Socialist\r\nParty of America might associate with! A more anomalous product of the\r\ndouble-faced generalship of Berger and Hillquit it would be hard to\r\nimagine.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. The Moscow Manifesto of March, 1919, was before the\r\nEmergency Convention. This Russian Communistic Manifesto is addressed\r\n\"To the proletariat of all countries\" (see Chapter IV) and reads: \"We\r\nCommunists, representatives of the revolutionary proletariat of the\r\ndifferent countries of Europe, America and Asia, assembled in Soviet\r\nMoscow.\" Would the Socialist Party of America accept its inclusion among\r\nthose in \"America\" thus designated, or refuse? The committee which\r\nconsidered the matter split, bringing in majority and minority reports.\r\nThe majority report, favored by Berger, considered the Third\r\nInternational as not yet constituted, thus hanging the Socialist Party\r\nof America in the air, without fellowship with Moscow, Berne or any\r\nother thing--a trapeze performance truly Bergeresque. The minority\r\nreport, voted for even by a third of the machine delegates in the\r\nEmergency Convention, favored affiliation with the associates of the\r\nMoscow Conference as constituting the Third International. It was\r\ndecided to submit both reports to a referendum vote of the party, which\r\nshould have been taken in January or February, 1920, if the requirements\r\nof the party Constitution were followed.\r\n\r\nThe concern of the Socialist Party managers to keep the facts from the\r\ngeneral public, evidenced by their tactics in the case of the five\r\nsuspended Socialist Assemblymen at Albany, might have led to another\r\nunconstitutional delay or manipulation of a referendum. But this was\r\nimmaterial in determining the mind of the rank and file, as we have\r\ndocumentary evidence showing that the only opposition within the party\r\nto a clear-cut Bolshevik committal sprang out of fear either of legal\r\nprosecution or of the loss of votes through public condemnation. The\r\nfollowing illuminating discussion is extracted from a letter of\r\nAlexander Trachtenberg, a conspicuous Socialist, as printed in the\r\n\"Call\" of November 26, 1919:\r\n\r\n     \"The members of the Socialist Party now have before them two\r\n     referenda--Referendum E, consisting of the various changes in the\r\n     party Constitution which were decided upon at the Chicago\r\n     Convention, and Referendum F, on international Socialist\r\n     relations....\r\n\r\n     \"The question of international affiliation is at this moment\r\n     probably the most important before the Socialist Party. The two\r\n     reports which emanated from the convention, known as the majority\r\n     and minority reports, will no doubt receive very careful\r\n     consideration by the members....\r\n\r\n     \"A close examination of the two reports reveals that the condition\r\n     laid down for the International, with which the Socialist party\r\n     cares to affiliate itself, are the same. Both reports agree that:\r\n\r\n     \"a. The Second International is dead.\r\n\r\n     \"b. The Berne International Conference hopelessly failed in its\r\n     indeavor to reconstitute the International.\r\n\r\n     \"c. The New International must consist only of those parties:\r\n\r\n     \"1. Which have remained true to the revolutionary International\r\n     Socialist movement during the war.\r\n\r\n     \"2. Which refused to co-operate with bourgeois parties and are\r\n     opposed to all forms of coalition.\r\n\r\n     \"In short, _both_ reports agree that the Socialist Party will go\r\n     only into such an International the component parties of which\r\n     _conduct their struggle on revolutionary class lines_. The\r\n     difference between the two reports is, that while the majority\r\n     report leaves the matter of the reconstruction of the International\r\n     hang in the air, the minority report has something tangible to\r\n     offer. It also more specifically outlines the Socialist policy on\r\n     the question of international affiliation, and gives several\r\n     reasons for joining the Third (Moscow) International....\r\n\r\n     \"The Socialist Party of America cannot afford to remain amorphous\r\n     at the present stage of the building of the new International. It\r\n     has refused to go with those elements who have either betrayed or\r\n     were unwilling to remain true to their professions. It belongs\r\n     among those parties which have remained true to International\r\n     Socialism and who alone have the right to build the edifice of the\r\n     new International.\r\n\r\n     \"By voting for the minority report the Comrades will give\r\n     expression to _what they have professed and believed in_ during the\r\n     past critical years in the life of the international Socialist\r\n     movement.\"\r\n\r\nA letter on the same subject, by Benjamin Glassberg, appears in the\r\n\"Call\" of December 4, 1919, from which we take extracts showing the\r\nBergeresque argument of Hoan, Berger's mayor of Milwaukee:\r\n\r\n     \"The most important question before the members of the Socialist\r\n     Party just now is the referendum on the majority and minority\r\n     reports on international relations. Comrade Trachtenberg has argued\r\n     in the columns of 'The Call' in favor of the minority report, and\r\n     Hoan of Milwaukee for the majority, and Comrade Warshow has argued\r\n     against both.\r\n\r\n     \"A careful examination of the position taken by both Hoan and\r\n     Warshow fails to reveal why the minority report should be voted\r\n     down. Comrade Hoan is naturally very much concerned at the\r\n     possibility that 'in the coming political battles the capitalistic\r\n     henchmen will flaunt in your face that the above is the program of\r\n     the Socialist Party' (referring to the statement in the governing\r\n     rules of the Communist International that the revolutionary era\r\n     compels the proletariat to make use of mass action).\r\n\r\n     \"The important thing, according to Hoan, is not whether the\r\n     minority report is right or not, but rather what will the effect be\r\n     at the next election. In this respect he is typical of the pure and\r\n     simple political Socialist....\r\n\r\n     \"In one breath Comrade Warshow calls for a new International to\r\n     which shall be admitted all Socialist parties of the world who\r\n     believe in the class struggle, and in the next he defends the\r\n     Socialists supporting a coalition government. How can one subscribe\r\n     to the doctrine of the class struggle and at the same time approve\r\n     of Socialists joining in a coalition government, which of necessity\r\n     will not be the agent of the workers but of the class with which\r\n     the workers are at all times at war?....\r\n\r\n     \"In all our official declarations, including the Chicago manifesto,\r\n     we have voiced our support of the Bolsheviki. In our meetings and\r\n     in our literature we have taken our stand solidly with our Russian\r\n     Comrades, our friends, the Left Wingers to the contrary\r\n     notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n     \"Why, then, hesitate to affiliate with them?\"\r\n\r\nThus, whether or not Berger's policy of dissimulation prevailed--and his\r\nwholesale slaughter of dues-payers with the ax of the Executive\r\nCommittee had shown all who opposed him what they might expect--it\r\nremained true that identification with the Bolshevist principles and\r\ntactics of Lenine and Trotzky was what the present members of the\r\nSocialist Party in America \"have professed and believed in during the\r\npast critical years\" and was in accord with \"all\" their \"official\r\ndeclarations,\" their \"meetings\" and their \"literature.\"\r\n\r\nThe base ingratitude of Berger toward those who have followed and\r\nsupported him; the gross, incredible savagery of his egotism in turning\r\nto rend those he had discipled into revolutionaries the moment their\r\nallegiance to the principles he taught them stood in the way of his\r\ncowardice and ambition; his butcher insensibilities in making his\r\nparty's Constitution a \"scrap of paper\" and the party a shambles for the\r\nhewing down of two-thirds of his \"Comrades;\" his burlesque effrontery in\r\nposing in the convention as a law-and-order man, railing at his own\r\nvictims as \"anarchists\"--these daubs of color paint the cubist portrait\r\nof Wisconsin's mock hero, one of the meanest caricatures of human life\r\nthat ever swaggered on a political arena.\r\n\r\nWhen the two Wings of the Convention raised the question, \"Who called\r\nthe cops?\" Berger's pale and innocent figure rose with the trembling\r\nremark: \"If they had not been here yesterday morning we would not be\r\nhere now. The two-fisted Reed and the other two-fisted Left Wingers\r\nwould be here.\" He took pains to have the delicate pathos of his\r\nmartyrdom sketched into the Executive Committee report he signed,\r\n\"Victor L. Berger, in addition to a sentence of 20 years, has four more\r\nindictments pending against him, besides being refused his seat in\r\nCongress. All the Socialist candidates for Congress in Wisconsin and the\r\nState Secretary also are under indictment. No mail whatever is permitted\r\nto be delivered to the 'Leader,' the party daily in Milwaukee,\" etc. On\r\nthe other hand, against the terrible \"anarchs\" who had so outraged his\r\nown gentle spirit and sense of order, he even fulminated outside the\r\nConvention Hall, as in the interview which we take from the \"Call\" of\r\nSeptember 4, 1919:\r\n\r\n     \"Ever since the Socialist movement has existed there have been two\r\n     very distinct tendencies apparent--the Social Democratic tendency\r\n     and the Anarcho-Syndicalist tendency....\r\n\r\n     \"But the revolution in Russia and Hungary, which had been predicted\r\n     by us, as well as in Germany, has had a peculiar psychological\r\n     effect on many of the rank and file of the party, especially upon\r\n     those who had come from Russia and Hungary. They really believe\r\n     this revolt can be repeated today in America.\r\n\r\n     \"The revolution in Russia and the psychological effect of it\r\n     penetrated into the foreign federations affiliated with the\r\n     Socialist party of America and gave the Anarcho-Syndicalists, who\r\n     have joined us in great numbers in the last six months, a chance to\r\n     split up the Socialist party of America into three groups.\r\n\r\n     \"First, the old Socialist Party, which will remain longer to aid\r\n     the old ideals of Social Democracy, even though there may be a\r\n     change in tactics required by changed conditions.\r\n\r\n     \"Then there are the Communist Socialists, led by John Reed and a\r\n     few hysterical men and women, who try to bring about a Russian\r\n     revolution or God knows what other things, they themselves don't\r\n     know tomorrow morning.\r\n\r\n     \"And, finally, there is the Communist Party, led by Louis Fraina,\r\n     which consists mainly of Russians, Ukrainians[7], Slovenic races\r\n     and other foreign federation members, who have been suspended for\r\n     stuffing ballot boxes in the last referendum, and who also want\r\n     revolution of some kind, the wherewith and howwith they haven't\r\n     been able to explain so far.\"\r\n\r\nDo we exaggerate the humbuggery of leadership uncloaked in this\r\nEmergency Convention of the Socialist Party of America? Let the reader\r\njudge from the supreme example of it, the motive of which we present in\r\nthe words of the organ of one of the chief conspirators, Hillquit's\r\n\"Call.\" The issue of August 31, 1919, declared: \"The convention will\r\nadopt a stand, expressed in a manifesto that is expected to satisfy all\r\nthose in the Left Wing who are contending for what they believe to be\r\nrevolutionary principles.\" In the issue of September 3 we read:\r\n\r\n     \"There will be a restatement of party principles which is expected\r\n     to cut the ground from under the feet of the former members and\r\n     organizations of the party who have read themselves out and will\r\n     remain suspended in mid-air between the newly formed and still more\r\n     newly revised Communist-Labor Party and the Communist Party.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Call\" of September 5, which published the manifesto, we also\r\nhave this comment on it by James Oneal: \"The American movement can\r\ncongratulate itself on having produced such a splendid document. It will\r\ntend to rally members who have been uncertain of the outcome of the\r\nconvention, and will eventually bring to us many who are sick of the\r\nhypocrisies, the shams and the illusions that have held them in chains\r\nfor nearly three tragic years.\"\r\n\r\nWhat hypocrisies, shams and illusions are referred to? Who were their\r\nauthors? In another column of the same issue we are told: \"With every\r\ndelegate on his feet and cheering, the National Emergency Convention of\r\nthe Socialist Party unanimously adopted its manifesto this afternoon.\r\n[September 4th.] It was the big moment of the convention. The document\r\nis regarded as the most revolutionary the party has ever drawn up, and\r\none certain to bring back into the organization thousands of members\r\ntemporarily outside of it, either because their local organizations were\r\nexpelled or by reason of what Lenine has called 'the intoxication of the\r\nrevolutionary phrase.'\"\r\n\r\nThus this manifesto was adopted by the wreckers of the Socialist Party\r\nto hold the \"revolutionary\" rank and file still left them and to draw\r\nback the revolutionary seceders--minus their leaders, of course.\r\nNevertheless the manifesto is truly revolutionary--\"most\r\nrevolutionary\"--the revolutionary creed of a revolutionary organization.\r\nIt is, of course, carefully worded, so as to deceive if possible that\r\npublic whose intelligence the cynical Socialists despise at the same\r\ntime that they appeal to it for votes, and this careful wording we can\r\nunderstand from a comment in the \"Call\" of September 5, 1919: \"Before\r\nreading the manifesto, Block told the convention the manifesto was\r\nlargely based upon one suggested by Morris Hillquit, now ill at Saranac\r\nLake, N. Y.\"[J]\r\n\r\nSeen through its mask of verbiage, however, the manifesto of the\r\nEmergency Convention of the Socialist Party of America joins with the\r\nfamous Preamble of the I. W. W. and the manifestoes and programs of the\r\nCommunist and Communist Labor Parties in advocating the plundering of\r\nmankind by proletarians, the elimination of the private ownership of\r\nnatural wealth and the machinery of production, and the _wresting_ of\r\n\"the industries and the control of the government of the United States\"\r\nout of their present ownership and control so as \"to place industry and\r\ngovernment in the control of the workers.\"\r\n\r\nThis revolutionary document incites \"American labor\" to \"break away\"\r\nfrom its present leadership, called \"reactionary and futile,\" and \"to\r\njoin in the great emancipating movement of the more advanced\r\nrevolutionary workers of the world\"--the I. W. W.'s and Bolshevists. It\r\nis \"the supreme task\" of \"the Socialist party of America,\" its \"great\r\ntask,\" to which its members \"pledge all\" their \"energies and resources,\"\r\nto \"win the American workers\" from their \"ineffective\" leadership, \"to\r\neducate them to an enlightened understanding of their own class\r\ninterests, and to train and assist them to organize politically and\r\nindustrially on class lines, in order _to effect their emancipation_,\"\r\nnamely, \"to _wrest_ the industries and the control of the government of\r\nthe United States from the capitalists _and their retainers_\" and \"place\r\nindustry _and government_ in the control of the workers.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, \"to _insure_ the triumph of Socialism in the United States\r\nthe bulk of American workers must be strongly organized politically as\r\nSocialists, in constant, clear-cut and _aggressive opposition to all\r\nparties of the possessing class_\" and \"must be strongly organized in the\r\neconomic field on broad industrial lines, _as one powerful and\r\nharmonious class organization_, co-operating with the Socialist Party,\r\nand _ready in cases of emergency_ to _reinforce_ the _political_ demands\r\nof the working class _by industrial action_.\" (See, a few pages further\r\non, the manifesto itself, from which we have quoted in the three last\r\nparagraphs.)\r\n\r\nIs this the thing which Berger and Hillquit have let loose--after\r\nblocking a much less compromising resolution of long-distance\r\naffiliation with Moscow? Does Berger think the people of Wisconsin such\r\nblockheads that they will shy at a word like Bolshevism, but are unable\r\nto understand the plain, bold English of a conspiracy to bring about\r\nindustrial organization \"to wrest the industries and the control of the\r\ngovernment of the United States\" out of the hands of the American people\r\nand into the hands of a special class? Indeed, if the \"workers\" take\r\neverything, what will become of the drones--the Socialist political\r\nhacks?\r\n\r\nWhile we reserve the details for Chapter XVI, we add here in passing\r\nthat on February 10, 1920, it was acknowledged in testimony at the trial\r\nof the five Assemblymen at Albany that affiliation with the Third\r\n(Moscow) International had been carried by referendum vote in the\r\nSocialist Party of America with a large majority.\r\n\r\nBefore giving the reader the text of that part of the Emergency\r\nConvention manifesto which we have been discussing we must call\r\nattention to another piece of evidence--Morris Hillquit's letter in his\r\npaper, the \"New York Call,\" shortly after the Emergency Convention, in\r\nwhich he says:\r\n\r\n\"The split in the ranks of American Socialism raises the question: What\r\nshall be the attitude of the Socialist Party toward the newly formed\r\nCommunist organization?\" His letter answering this important question\r\nwas read out of the \"Call\" into the record of the New York Assembly's\r\ninquiry into the qualifications of the five suspended Socialists to act\r\nas law-makers and will be found in the \"New York Herald\" of January 29,\r\n1920, from which we take it:\r\n\r\n     \"Any attempted solution of the problem must take into account the\r\n     following fundamental facts:\r\n\r\n     \"First--The division was not created arbitrarily and deliberately\r\n     by the recent convention in Chicago. It had become an accomplished\r\n     fact months ago, and the Chicago gatherings did nothing more than\r\n     recognize the fact.\r\n\r\n     \"Second--The division was not brought about by differences on vital\r\n     questions of principles. It arose over disputes on methods and\r\n     policy.\r\n\r\n     \"Third--The separation of the Socialist Party into three\r\n     organizations need not necessarily mean a weakening of the\r\n     Socialists. They are wrong in their estimate of American\r\n     conditions, their theoretical conclusions and practical methods,\r\n     but they have not deserted to the enemy. The bulk of their\r\n     following is still good Socialist material. When the hour of the\r\n     real Socialist fight strikes in this country we may find them\r\n     again in our ranks.\r\n\r\n     \"Our quarrel is a family quarrel, and has no room in the columns of\r\n     the capitalistic papers, where it can only give joy and comfort to\r\n     the common enemy. The unpardonable offense of the\r\n     Simons-Russell-Spargo crowd [which withdrew from the Socialist\r\n     Party of America on account of its unpatriotic and un-American\r\n     opposition to the people and Government of the United States at\r\n     war, as expressed in the Socialist Party's St. Louis Convention\r\n     utterances in April, 1917] was not so much their social-patriotic\r\n     stand during the war as the fact that they rushed into the\r\n     anti-Socialist press maliciously denouncing their former comrades\r\n     as pro-German and deliberately added fuel to the sinister flame of\r\n     mob violence and government persecution directed against the\r\n     Socialist movement.\r\n\r\n     \"We have had our split. It was unfortunate but unavoidable, and now\r\n     we are through with it. Legitimate constructive work of the\r\n     Socialist movement is before us. Let us give it all of our time,\r\n     energies and resources. Let us center our whole fight upon\r\n     capitalism, and let us hope our Communist brethren will go and do\r\n     likewise.\"\r\n\r\nThus all three organizations, Socialist Party of America, Communist\r\nParty of America and Communist Labor Party, have merely had \"a family\r\nquarrel\" and are still one kin, one blood, one \"family,\" without\r\n\"fundamental\" \"differences on vital questions of principles,\" so that\r\nthe Socialist Partyites and their \"Communist brethren\" can go on doing\r\n\"likewise\" against our present Government and institutions until, \"when\r\nthe hour of the _real_ Socialist fight\"--the Great Rebellion--\"strikes\r\n_in this country_\" the members of the Socialist Party \"may find\" the\r\nmembers of the two Communist parties \"again in\" their \"ranks.\" Thus by\r\nHillquit, at least, all three parties can only \"be construed\" to be in\r\none and the same \"category.\"\r\n\r\nWe end this chapter by reproducing from the \"New York Call\" of September\r\n5, 1919, a considerable part of the Socialist Party's Emergency\r\nConvention manifesto. This offspring of Hillquit's brain declares\r\n\"solidarity with the revolutionary workers of Russia\" and \"radical\"\r\nSpartacides of Germany and Communists of Austria and Hungary. Let the\r\nreader carefully weigh this document's meanings, comparing them with the\r\ncall for and manifesto of the Moscow Conference, the definition of\r\n\"industrial unionism\" and \"mass action\" in the Left Wingers' writings,\r\nthe Communist and Communist Labor manifestoes and programs, and the\r\nprinciples and tactics of I. W. W.'ism as set forth elsewhere in this\r\nvolume, and then ask himself if the latest official utterance of the\r\nSocialist Party of America can in any way \"be construed\" as placing that\r\nparty in any \"category\" which does not also contain the Communist\r\norganizations and the I. W. W. The salient parts of the manifesto\r\nfollow:\r\n\r\n     \"The capitalist class is now making its last stand in its history.\r\n     It was intrusted with the government of the world. It is\r\n     responsible for the prevailing chaos. The events of recent years\r\n     have conclusively demonstrated that capitalism is bankrupt, and has\r\n     become a dangerous impediment to progress and human welfare. The\r\n     working class alone has the power to redeem and to save the\r\n     world....\r\n\r\n     \"It now becomes more than ever the immediate task of international\r\n     Socialism to accelerate and organize the inevitable transfer of\r\n     political and industrial power from the capitalist class to the\r\n     workers. The workers must recognize the economic structure of human\r\n     society by eliminating the institution of the private ownership of\r\n     natural wealth and of the machinery of industry, the essence of the\r\n     war-breeding system of international commercial rivalry. The\r\n     workers of the world must recognize the economic structure of human\r\n     society by making the natural wealth and the machinery of industry\r\n     the collective property of all....\r\n\r\n     \"The workers of Great Britain, France and Italy, the workers of the\r\n     newly created nations, and the workers of the countries which\r\n     remained neutral during the war, are all in a state of\r\n     unprecedented unrest. In different ways and by different methods,\r\n     either blindly impelled by the inexorable conditions which confront\r\n     them, or clearly recognizing their revolutionary aims, they are\r\n     abandoning their temporising programs of pre-war labor reform. They\r\n     are determined to control the industries, which means control of\r\n     the governments.\r\n\r\n     \"In the United States capitalism has emerged from the war more\r\n     reactionary and aggressive, more insolent and oppressive than it\r\n     has ever been....\r\n\r\n     \"But even in the United States the symptoms of a rebellious spirit\r\n     in the ranks of the working masses are rapidly multiplying.\r\n     Widespread and extensive strikes for better labor conditions, the\r\n     demand of the 2,000,000 railway workers to control their industry,\r\n     sporadic formation of labor parties, apparently, though not\r\n     fundamentally, in opposition to the political parties of the\r\n     possessing class, are promising indications of a definite tendency\r\n     on the part of American labor to break away from its reactionary\r\n     and futile leadership and to join in the great emancipating\r\n     movement of the more advanced revolutionary workers of the world.\r\n\r\n     \"Recognizing this crucial situation at home and abroad, the\r\n     Socialist Party in the United States at its first national\r\n     convention after the war, squarely takes its position with the\r\n     uncompromising section of the international Socialist movement. We\r\n     unreservedly reject the policy of those Socialists who supported\r\n     their belligerent capitalist governments on the plea of 'national\r\n     defense,' and who entered into demoralizing compacts for so-called\r\n     civil peace with the exploiters of labor during the war and\r\n     continued a political alliance with them after the war.\r\n\r\n     \"We, the organized Socialists of America, declare our solidarity\r\n     with the revolutionary workers of Russia in the support of the\r\n     government of their Soviets, with the radical Socialists of\r\n     Germany, Austria and Hungary in their efforts to establish working\r\n     class rule in their countries, and with those Socialist\r\n     organizations in England, France, Italy and other countries, who,\r\n     during the war as after the war, have remained true to the\r\n     principles of uncompromising international Socialism....\r\n\r\n     \"The great purpose of the Socialist Party is to wrest the\r\n     industries and the control of the government of the United States\r\n     from the capitalists and their retainers. It is our purpose to\r\n     place industry and government in the control of the workers with\r\n     hand and brain, to be administered for the benefit of the whole\r\n     community.\r\n\r\n     \"To insure the triumph of Socialism in the United States the bulk\r\n     of the American workers must be strongly organized politically as\r\n     Socialists, in constant, clear-cut and aggressive opposition to all\r\n     parties of the possessing class. They must be strongly organized in\r\n     the economic field on broad industrial lines, as one powerful and\r\n     harmonious class organization, cooperating with the Socialist\r\n     Party, and ready in cases of emergency to reinforce the political\r\n     demands of the working class by industrial action.\r\n\r\n     \"To win the American workers from their ineffective and\r\n     demoralizing leadership, to educate them to an enlightened\r\n     understanding of their own class interests, and to train and assist\r\n     them to organize politically and industrially on class lines, in\r\n     order to effect their emancipation, that is the supreme task\r\n     confronting the Socialist Party of America.\r\n\r\n     \"To this great task, without deviation or compromise, we pledge all\r\n     our energies and resources. For its accomplishment we call for the\r\n     support and co-operation of the workers of America and of all other\r\n     persons desirous of ending the insane rule of capitalism before it\r\n     has had the opportunity to precipitate humanity into another\r\n     cataclysm of blood and ruin.\r\n\r\n     \"Long live the International Socialist Revolution, the only hope of\r\n     the suffering world!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSOCIALISM IN THEORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMorris Hillquit, a ring-leader among Socialists of the United States,\r\nwriting in \"Everybody's,\" October, 1913, page 487, informs us that the\r\nterm Socialism is used indiscriminately to designate a certain\r\nphilosophy, a scheme of social organization and an active political\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nSocialism, used to designate a certain philosophy, may better be\r\ndistinguished by being called Socialism in theory. Socialism as an\r\napplied scheme of social organization may be termed Socialism in\r\npractice, and means nothing other than a form of government according to\r\nthe principles of Socialist philosophy. Socialism, as an active\r\npolitical movement, means the Socialist Party. Thus, when we say that\r\nSocialism won several times in Milwaukee, we do not mean that the system\r\nof Socialist philosophy was voted upon and accepted by the majority, for\r\nmost of the voters knew practically nothing about the philosophy of\r\nSocialism; nor do we mean that the form of government in accordance with\r\nthe principles of Socialist philosophy was adopted at the polls, for, as\r\na matter of fact, we know that the government of Milwaukee has never\r\nbeen in accordance with the Marxian principles; but we mean this, and\r\nonly this, that the active political movement of the Socialists, in\r\nother words, the Socialist Party, elected its candidates. No doubt the\r\nvictorious candidates would have ruled Milwaukee according to the\r\nphilosophy of Socialism, applying the Marxian principles to their\r\ngovernment, if they could have done so, but the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States as well as that of the State of Wisconsin would have stood\r\nin the way, as will be seen when Socialism is explained more in detail.\r\n\r\nThe first form of Socialism to be explained in detail is Socialism in\r\ntheory. There seem to be about 57 hundred times 57 hundred varieties of\r\nSocialists, owing to the conflicting views that members of the party\r\nhold on different subjects which they wish to include in Socialism, and\r\nalso because of their different interpretations of the fundamental\r\nprinciple of Socialism. There is, however, one underlying principle that\r\nseems to be held quite generally by Marxians the world over. No matter\r\nwhat other radical measures individual Socialists may favor or wish to\r\nsee included in the Socialist philosophy, and no matter how many\r\ndifferent interpretations are given to the principle of Socialism, the\r\nbasic principle that stands out above all others and is accepted\r\ngenerally by Socialists the world over may be said to be the demand for\r\na government, democratic in form, under which all the citizens would\r\ncollectively own and manage the principal means of production,\r\ntransportation and communication.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Workers of the World form one of the few classes of\r\nSocialists who object to the generally accepted fundamental principle\r\njust mentioned. \"The One Big Union Monthly,\" March, 1919, prefers to\r\ndrop the words \"democratic form of government,\" because the I. W. W.'s\r\nare not sure that ownership by the people as a whole would succeed\r\nbetter under a democratic form of government than under a dictatorship\r\nof the proletariat.\r\n\r\n\"The Labour Leader,\" the organ of the Socialist Independent Labor Party,\r\nManchester, England, February 6, 1919, declares that Socialism is \"the\r\ncomplete ownership and control of the means of life by the people, and\r\nthe development of industry and the distribution of its fruits under a\r\ngenuine and absolute democracy.\" In explaining Socialism, it says that\r\n\"it means that the land shall become the property of the people, not of\r\nprivate individuals. It means that the great industries shall become the\r\nproperty of the people. It means that the railways and the canals shall\r\nbecome the property of the people. It means that the shipping shall\r\nbecome the property of the people. In short it means that everything\r\nessential to the life of all shall become the property of all, and shall\r\nbe administered not for the profit of the few, but for the use of all.\r\nAnd it demands intelligent control of public affairs by the people,\r\nwomen as well as men.\"\r\n\r\nPractically the same ideas are expressed in other words by Jaurés in\r\n\"Studies in Socialism,\" page 32 of 1906 edition, translated by Minturn.\r\nThis great leader of the French Socialists, who was assassinated at the\r\nbeginning of the World War, and in whose honor there was a tremendous\r\ndemonstration in Paris on April 6, 1919, prophesied that \"the time is\r\nnot far off when no one will be able to speak to the public about the\r\npreservation of private property without covering himself with ridicule\r\nand putting himself voluntarily into an inferior rank. That which\r\nreigns to-day under the name of private property is really class\r\nproperty, and those who wish for the establishment of democracy in the\r\neconomic as well as the political world should give their best effort to\r\nthe abolition and not to the maintenance of this class property.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"The Revolutionary Age,\" Boston, January 11, 1919, page 4, we read:\r\n\r\n     \"What is Socialism? It is the public ownership of all the wealth,\r\n     the mills, the mines, the factories, the railroads and land. Things\r\n     that are used in common, must be owned in common, by the people and\r\n     for the people under democratic management by the people, instead\r\n     of the present system of private ownership for profits.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Morris Hillquit in \"Everybody's,\" October, 1913, page 487:\r\n\r\n     \"The Socialist program advocates a reorganization of the existing\r\n     industrial system on the basis of collective or national ownership\r\n     of the social tools. It demands that the control of the machinery\r\n     of wealth creation be taken from the individual capitalists and\r\n     placed in the hands of the nation, to be organized and operated for\r\n     the benefit of the whole people.\"\r\n\r\nHillquit, in his various articles, has, of course, like many other\r\nSocialists, given his explanation of the detailed method of organization\r\nand operation of industries under a Socialist form of government. It\r\nreads very nicely and appears attractive, as his statements do till\r\ntruth's searchlight falls on them, but it does not seem worth while to\r\npresent his views, for very many of the leading Socialists of the world\r\nnot only differ with each other as regards the method of organization\r\nand operation that they advocate for the Marxian state, but they are\r\nalso very much at variance with the plan of organization and operation\r\nthat Hillquit describes.\r\n\r\nEugene V. Debs, in his \"Daily Message from Moundsville Prison,\"\r\npublished in \"The Call,\" New York, April 21, 1919, tells us what\r\nSocialism is:\r\n\r\n     \"The earth for all the people! That is the demand.\r\n\r\n     \"The machinery of production and distribution for all the people!\r\n     That is the demand.\r\n\r\n     \"The collective ownership and control of industry and its\r\n     democratic management in the interest of all the people! That is\r\n     the demand.\r\n\r\n     \"The elimination of rent, interest and profit and the production of\r\n     wealth to satisfy the wants of all the people! That is the demand.\r\n\r\n     \"Co-operative industry in which we all shall work together in\r\n     harmony as the basis of a new social order, a higher civilization,\r\n     a real republic! That is the demand.\r\n\r\n     \"The end of class struggles and class rule, of master and slave, of\r\n     ignorance and vice, of poverty and shame, of cruelty and crime--the\r\n     birth of freedom, the dawn of brotherhood, the beginning of MAN!\r\n     That is the demand.\r\n\r\n     \"This is Socialism!\"\r\n\r\nIn the Preamble to the American Socialist Party Platform, adopted by\r\nnational referendum, July 24, 1917, we are told:\r\n\r\n     \"The theory of a democratic government is the greatest good to the\r\n     greatest number. The working class far out-numbers the capitalist\r\n     class. Here is the natural advantage of the working class. By\r\n     uniting solidly in a political party of its own, it can capture the\r\n     government and all its powers and use them in its own interests.\r\n\r\n     \"The Socialist Party aims to abolish this class war with all its\r\n     evils and to substitute for capitalism a new order of co-operation,\r\n     wherein the workers shall own and control all the economic factors\r\n     of life. It calls upon all workers to unite, to strike as they vote\r\n     and to vote as they strike, all against the master class.\r\n\r\n     \"Only through this combination of our powers can we establish the\r\n     co-operative commonwealth, wherein the workers shall own their jobs\r\n     and receive the full social value of their product. The necessities\r\n     of life will then be produced, not for the profits of the few, but\r\n     for the comfort and happiness of all who labor. Instead of\r\n     privately owned industries with masters and slaves, there will be\r\n     the common ownership of the means of life, and all the\r\n     opportunities and resources of the world will be equal and free to\r\n     all.\"\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle of Socialism, namely, a government, democratic\r\nin form, in which all the citizens would collectively own and manage the\r\nprincipal means of production, transportation and communication, will be\r\nmore clearly understood if the several component parts of the basic\r\nprinciple are explained.\r\n\r\nA government, _democratic in form_, would, of course, require the\r\noverthrow of all limited monarchies as well as the annihilation of those\r\nthat are despotic. Even a republican form of government, like that of\r\nthe United States, is very far from being satisfactory to the\r\nRevolutionists, for they demand that the citizens have as direct a voice\r\nas possible, first in the election of all public officers, secondly in\r\nthe framing of the laws, and thirdly in the management of the many\r\nindustrial departments of the proposed government.\r\n\r\nBy the citizens' _collective owning_ of the different things enumerated\r\nis meant that they would own them just as the citizens of the United\r\nStates, as a body, to-day own the post-offices, arsenals, navy and\r\npublic lands. Of course, collective ownership does not imply that, after\r\nthe state should have taken over the things referred to, each citizen\r\nwould be entitled to an equal share of them as his own private property,\r\nto be used by him according to his desires.\r\n\r\n_The management of the property_ of the Socialist state and the\r\nremuneration[8] for labor would not be in the hands of private\r\nindividuals acting independently, but would be subject to the will of\r\nthe majority of the citizens.\r\n\r\nBy the _principal_ means of production, transportation and communication\r\nis meant any instrument of production, transportation or communication\r\nthat would be used for purposes of exploitation, in other words, for\r\nmaking profit through the employment of hired labor. To illustrate this,\r\nseveral examples will be given. Mines, factories and mills of all kinds,\r\nlarge business houses and stores, together with those farms whose owners\r\nwould employ hired labor for the production of goods to be sold at\r\nprofit, would all be looked upon as being among the _principal means of\r\nproduction_. On the other hand, a sewing-machine used for family needs\r\nwould not be included in the list.\r\n\r\nThere are many Socialists who have held that their intended state would\r\nallow the private ownership of very small farms, provided that the\r\nproducts were raised without the employment of farm hands. But it seems\r\nlikely that such a plan of private ownership would not be tolerated\r\nunder a Socialist government, for, first of all, a very large number of\r\nSocialists are opposed to such a plan, and, secondly, the political\r\nactionists who have favored it either have sacrificed thereby the\r\nprinciples of their party, or else by advocating the private ownership\r\nof small farms, have done so with the intention of deceiving farmers and\r\nsmall land owners in order to win their votes. More will be said about\r\nthis further on.\r\n\r\nRailroads, street car lines, express and steamship service would be\r\namong the _principal means of transportation_; while included in the\r\nlist of _principal means of communication_ there would be the public\r\ntelephone and telegraph systems. Automobiles, horses and carriages, if\r\nused without the assistance of hired labor, would not be considered as\r\nbeing principal means of transportation. So, too, under similar\r\nconditions, a private telephone or telegraph line running to the house\r\nof a friend would be excluded from the principal means of communication.\r\n\r\nThe state would, of course, own all the goods produced in its mines,\r\nfactories, shops, etc., until they were purchased with money or labor\r\ncertificates. The people would then retain these goods as their own\r\nprivate property, and would not, according to the leading American\r\nSocialists, be compelled to divide them up with their fellow countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist plan looks very nice on paper, allures many impoverished\r\nworkingmen of the present day, appeals strongly to the uneducated, and\r\noffers great inducements to the \"downs and outs\" of society. It is,\r\nhowever, a deadly poison, and this will be proven conclusively in the\r\nchapter on \"Socialism a Peril to Workingmen.\" There it will be shown not\r\nonly that a Socialist state cannot possibly be a success, but that it\r\nwould be a source of continued civil strife and discord, thoroughly\r\nunsatisfactory to workingmen, whom it would overwhelm with all the evils\r\nattendant on crime, strife, rebellion and chaos. In the Marxian state\r\nthe industrial establishments, land, and business enterprises would be\r\nconfiscated; neither interest, rent nor profit would be tolerated; the\r\nwage system would be abolished; no satisfactory plan could be devised\r\nfor assigning so many millions of workingmen to the different positions,\r\nwhile at the same time satisfying them with remuneration for their daily\r\ntoil; religions of all kinds would be the object of persecution;\r\nfree-love would be legalized; and political corruption would be much\r\nmore widespread than today. These are but several of the factors that\r\nwould make a successful Socialist state an impossibility.\r\n\r\nIt may interest the reader to know that Socialists of the highest\r\nauthority inform us that in the new state women would be called upon to\r\nwork. The late August Bebel, one of the foremost of German Socialists,\r\nsays that as soon as society is in possession of all the means of\r\nproduction, \"the duty to work, on the part of all able to work, without\r\ndistinction of sex, becomes the organic law of socialized society.\"\r\n[\"Woman Under Socialism,\" by Bebel, page 275 of the 1904 edition in\r\nEnglish.] Frederick Engels, in his book, \"Origin of the Family,\" teaches\r\nthat the emancipation of women is primarily dependent on the\r\nreintroduction of the whole female sex into the public industries.\r\n[\"Origin of the Family,\" by Engels, page 90 of Untermann's 1907\r\ntranslation into English.] In \"The Call,\" New York, February 27, 1910,\r\nit is stated that \"the man who professes himself to be a Socialist, and\r\nthen says that under Socialism men will provide for women, is wide of\r\nthe mark.\"\r\n\r\nKeeping clearly before their minds the fundamental principle of\r\nSocialism, the people of America must be careful to distinguish between\r\nSocialists ruling under our present form of government, and Socialists\r\nruling in a Socialist state. Possible success in the first case would by\r\nno means indicate success in the latter. If our citizens are cautious in\r\nthis respect, the enemies of our country will not dare to boast of the\r\nso-called success of Socialism in those places in which the members of\r\ntheir party, elected to public office, may have given a good\r\nadministration under our constitutional system of government.\r\n\r\nThough Socialism, in the strictest sense of the word, is concerned\r\nexclusively with economics, still this does not mean that those who\r\nprofess it do not advocate, as part of their program, many pet projects\r\nnot appertaining to economics. By a vast majority, the members of the\r\nSocialist Party either advocate atheism and opposition to religion, or\r\nat least do not oppose those Socialists who do. Most of them, too, in\r\ntheir cravings for what is base and low, are by no means adverse to\r\nseeing free-love reign supreme in their contemplated state. The word\r\n_Socialism_ is, therefore, frequently used in a broader sense, and is\r\nmade to include not only the common doctrine advocating the democratic\r\nform of government under which the citizens would collectively own and\r\nmanage the principal means of production, transportation and\r\ncommunication, but also those other doctrines that are taught or\r\nsilently approved by the majority. It is in this broader sense, then,\r\nthat the opponents of the Marxians justly claim that Socialism is\r\natheistic, anti-religious, and immoral.\r\n\r\nWe are told by Hillquit in \"Everybody's,\" October, 1913, page 486, that\r\n\"like all social theories and practical mass movements, Socialism\r\nproduces certain divergent schools, bastard offshoots clustering around\r\nthe main trunk of the tree, large in number and variety, but\r\ninsignificant in size and strength. Thus we hear of State Socialism,\r\nSocialism of the Chair, Christian Socialism and even Catholic\r\nSocialism.\"\r\n\r\nPersons who call themselves Socialists may be divided into two classes,\r\nin the first of which are those who are Socialists merely in name, for\r\nthey go no further than to vote the party ticket. It is in the second\r\nclass that we find the real Socialists, men who besides severing all\r\nconnections with the other political organizations and voting regularly\r\nfor the Socialist candidates, have taken out membership cards which\r\nentitle them to vote on party policies by the payment of several dollars\r\na year into the treasury of the party. Many of the first class are, of\r\ncourse, not guilty of propagating atheism, free-love, and other radical\r\ndoctrines. In fact, it often happens that they scarcely know that such\r\nthings are taught by Socialists, for the deceitful Revolutionary orators\r\nand writers, having blinded them with vivid pictures of their\r\nmisfortunes, lead them to believe that the movement is morally upright,\r\nand that the contemplated state of the future will bring them every\r\nblessing under Heaven.\r\n\r\nBut unless those who are Socialists merely in name sever their\r\nconnection with the party of Karl Marx, it will not be long before many\r\nof them will lose all sense of honor, decency and morality. Indeed they\r\noften sink lower than the base character who composed the \"poem\" that\r\ntakes up half a page of \"The Call\" of May 10, 1914. Though \"The Call\"\r\nseems to consider the \"poem\" an excellent specimen of literature, or\r\nelse uses the large type that it does in order to attract the attention\r\nof its readers to the sublime virtues of the author, the quotation of\r\nbut a small part of the production will suffice to bring out its real\r\nworth and at the same time show us the benign effects of Socialist\r\nteachings:\r\n\r\n    \"You who are exalted by pictures but not by people: you who\r\n        worship a book and a god rather than hearts and men and\r\n        women:\r\n    I'd rather have my world and its flesh and its devil than your\r\n        heaven and its spirit and its god:....\r\n    And while I don't blame man for being base or praise man for\r\n        being noble, I embrace man as my brother for being man:\r\n    And there you have the whole story, my man intoxication: I am\r\n        drunk with man: you see how it is:\r\n    You can have your bibles: I don't need your christs: your\r\n        creeds would be an insult to me: I have man: I am drunk\r\n        with man:\r\n    That's the secret of secrets: that's the confession of confessions:\r\n        that's the inside of the inside of me:\r\n    I don't expect you to take it in: drunk with man: no: that's\r\n        too much like mockery to you: you shudder at it:\r\n    To you man always comes last: man never comes first: gods,\r\n        mountains, laws--they come first: man can take his\r\n        chances:\r\n    That's the rule of precedence as you have fixed it: that's the up\r\n        and down and around of your cosmos:\r\n    But I say no: I who am drunk with man can't give up my faith\r\n        for your blasphemy: you who are sober with god.\"\r\n\r\nThe attention of the reader must now be drawn to something of vital\r\nimportance. There is no doubt that \"Knights of the Red Flag\" have\r\nadvocated many excellent social reforms, such as higher wages, shorter\r\nworking hours and greater safety for laborers, legislation against\r\ntrusts, and the prevention of child labor and political corruption.\r\nGreat credit would they deserve if their real object were not to gain\r\nvotes to secure the establishment of a Socialist form of government. It\r\nis probable that before long, voting with true social reformers, they\r\nwill see the materialization of many of the immediate demands enumerated\r\nin their platform. But it is to be remembered that no matter how many\r\nbeneficial reforms Socialists may help to procure under our present\r\nconstitutional system, they thus in no way prove the superiority of a\r\nSocialistic government, democratic in form, in which the citizens would\r\ncollectively own and manage the principal means of production,\r\ntransportation, and communication. The reason is that our constitutional\r\ngovernment would still be in vogue, and the contradictory fundamental\r\nprinciple of Socialism could not be applied by the ruling Marxians.\r\n\r\nPersons who judge the Socialist movement solely by the immediate demands\r\nof its political platform, or by social reforms instituted after a\r\npolitical victory, understand very little either about Socialism or the\r\nmethods and purposes of the Marxians. Yet this was the short-sighted\r\nmanner in which the press persistently, and for a long time, viewed the\r\ntactics of Socialist politicians. Only a revolutionary movement far\r\nenough advanced to neglect gradual transformation by means of immediate\r\ndemands would be able to sweep away by force, at a single stroke, all\r\nthe old conditions of production, together with our present form of\r\ngovernment, and the existing order of society.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"Immediate Demands\" of the Socialists may be termed\r\npolitical campaign Socialism or vote-catching Socialism. They are the\r\nsugar coating of the poisonous pill of Socialism itself. Their object is\r\nto attract and interest the voter, and at the same time keep his mind\r\noff of the fallacies of Socialism proper. They keep him from asking too\r\nmany unanswerable questions about the detailed method of organization\r\nunder a Socialist form of government--for instance, how the millions\r\nupon millions of government employes would be assigned to positions that\r\nwould suit them, and at the same time receive satisfactory remuneration\r\nfor their labors.\r\n\r\nThese same immediate demands also give the voter a chance to find fault\r\nwith our present system of government and to criticise it, thereby\r\nrendering it less able to withstand successive Socialist assaults. The\r\nimmediate demands are, of course, meant for the present day and even if\r\nthey should materialize, under our present system, they could not be\r\ncontinued in a Socialist state, that would be necessarily weak,\r\npoverty-stricken, strife-ridden, politically corrupt and chaotic. It is\r\none thing to make demands, quite another thing to be able to grant them.\r\nA highway robber can demand a million dollars from the person whom he\r\nattacks, but that doesn't make the one assaulted able to surrender the\r\nsum; nor would it prove that the robber himself could afford to pay a\r\nlike amount if he should afterwards be held up for a million.\r\n\r\nThe immediate demands of the 1918 Congressional Platform of the\r\nSocialist Party are entirely too many conveniently to enumerate. They\r\nare classed under\r\n\r\n    A--International Reconstruction.\r\n      Peace Aims.\r\n      Federation of Peoples.\r\n    B--Internal Reconstruction.\r\n      Industrial Control.\r\n      Railroads and Express Service.\r\n      Steamships and Steamship Lines.\r\n      Telegraph and Telephone.\r\n      Large Power Scale Industry.\r\n      Democratic Management.\r\n      Demobilization.\r\n      The Structure of Government (i.e., of the present system of\r\n        government).\r\n      Civil Liberties.\r\n      Taxation.\r\n      Credit.\r\n      Agriculture.\r\n      Conservation of Natural Resources.\r\n      Labor Legislation.\r\n      Prisons.\r\n      The Negro.\r\n\r\nThe immediate demands are so numerous as to require a booklet of 24\r\npages, published by the National Office, Socialist Party, Chicago, Ill.\r\nIt is very hard to find a single reference to Socialism itself in the\r\nentire 24 pages of the Congressional Platform.\r\n\r\nIn a letter of Moses Oppenheimer, published in \"The Call,\" New York,\r\nApril 14, 1919, we are told that under the opportunist leadership of men\r\nlike Hillquit, Berger, Ghent, and Robert Hunter the struggle for reforms\r\nhas gradually overshadowed and supplanted the demand for the abolition\r\nof wage slavery. The writer continues:\r\n\r\n     \"More and more it has resulted in petty tactics for vote catching.\r\n     Berger's Old Age Pension bill was a glaring exhibit of opportunist\r\n     incapacity.\r\n\r\n     \"Immediate demands are a tactical problem! Comrade Lee knows that\r\n     the tactics change with changed conditions. There was a time when\r\n     the opportunists expected to win the votes of the bulk of A. F. of\r\n     L. workers. Hence the sugar coating of the Socialist pill and three\r\n     years of Chester M. Wright in control of 'The Call.'\r\n\r\n     \"That is now ancient history. Lee could not repeat that chapter if\r\n     he would. Nay, I believe he wouldn't if he could.\r\n\r\n     \"The powerful impulse from the movement in Europe makes itself felt\r\n     over here. There is great need for reforming our front, for\r\n     recasting our tactics. The old roar of opportunism led us nowhere,\r\n     except to barren failure. If nothing else the experience with our\r\n     Ten in Albany and our Seven in the City Hall should open our eyes.\r\n     The time for picayune politics is irrevocably gone.\"\r\n\r\nIn an article published in \"The Proletarian,\" Detroit, April, 1919, page\r\n4, Oakley Johnson thus criticises the Socialist policy of reformism as\r\nmanifested in the immediate demands of the party platform:\r\n\r\n     \"Socialists have been dazed time and again by the glitter of\r\n     reformism. In every country the question has been an ever-present\r\n     one, and, as a result, the rainbows of reform have found many\r\n     chasers in the ranks of the workers. The matter seemed, up to near\r\n     the end of the war, to involve more an academic dispute on tactics\r\n     than a principle of vital importance. There seemed too many good\r\n     reasons why immediate demands for slight concessions should not be\r\n     worked for, as a step in the direction of proletarian emancipation.\r\n\r\n     \"When, however, the Bolshevik revolution in Russia showed the stand\r\n     taken by the reformist groups--a stand in defense of capitalism\r\n     when capitalism was about to fall--the uncompromisingly\r\n     revolutionary attitude of Marxian Socialists toward reform in the\r\n     past was amply justified. And when, in the course of a few months,\r\n     the reformistic Majority Socialists of Germany took exactly the\r\n     same stand as the Kerensky crowd had taken, there could no longer\r\n     be any doubt that the purpose of reform parties in capitalistic\r\n     society is to function as the last obstacle to the victory of the\r\n     proletariat....\r\n\r\n     \"The fact is, there is a threefold objection to reformism as a\r\n     working-class policy. In the first place it is a waste of effort,\r\n     for the same zeal displayed by short-sighted reform-Socialists\r\n     would, if applied in the propagation of straight Socialism, treble\r\n     the strength of the movement in a few months' time. In the second\r\n     place reformism obscures the real end in view, develops\r\n     confusionists rather than revolutionists, gives capitalist\r\n     political parties a chance to steal a few 'Socialist' planks and\r\n     thus bid for the Socialist vote, and, worst of all, paves the way\r\n     to such tragedies as are now occurring in Germany, where Liebknecht\r\n     and Luxemberg have been murdered by their 'reform' comrades(?). And\r\n     finally, in the third place, even if reform be the sole object in\r\n     view, reformism is the poorest policy to follow to get it. A\r\n     proletariat organized for revolutionary ends has no difficulty in\r\n     securing reforms; it does not need to ask for them, for an awakened\r\n     and apprehensive bourgeoisie will shower reforms upon them like the\r\n     proverbial manna. If, indeed, workers want only reforms, why take\r\n     the longest way around?\"\r\n\r\n\"The New Age,\" Buffalo, April 10, 1919, page 4, rejoices that the\r\nreformists of the Socialist Party, whose policy it is to pay more\r\nattention to the immediate demands than to the principles of Socialism,\r\nhave now a serious rival in the New Labor Party:\r\n\r\n     \"Now that the New Labor Party is established (and in Chicago\r\n     recently they polled more votes than the Socialists), we wonder\r\n     what the old machine will do to combat this new octopus that\r\n     threatens the big vote that used to belong to 'US.' Answer: Teach\r\n     the working class real Socialism, the Socialism of Marx and\r\n     Engels.\"\r\n\r\nThe millionaire Socialist, William Bross Lloyd, of Chicago, has a very\r\ninteresting article on \"Socialist Platforms\" in \"The Communist,\"\r\nChicago, April 1, 1919:\r\n\r\n     \"Confession is good for the soul. Let the Socialist Party of the\r\n     World now stand up and confess that it bears a close resemblance to\r\n     other political parties in that, like the others, its platforms are\r\n     mostly bunk.\r\n\r\n     \"The difference between its platforms and others is that the others\r\n     mean nothing while its platforms mean anything. The difference\r\n     between Socialists and other politicians is that the Socialists\r\n     mean what they think their platforms mean while the others mean\r\n     only to get office.\r\n\r\n     \"This follows from the state of affairs we have had in the world\r\n     since 1914, when Socialists became so diverse in words and deeds.\r\n     Most of those on both sides are honest. The trouble is the\r\n     vagueness of the words of the Socialist propaganda.\r\n\r\n     \"Socialist thought should be so clearly stated in its platforms\r\n     that no one can doubt its meaning. This will eliminate from the\r\n     party the reformers and compromisers who are such a source of\r\n     weakness to the movement. It will also make clear to the workers\r\n     that the movement really means something.\r\n\r\n     \"Take, for instance, the case of the party's attitude toward war.\r\n     Socialists are said to be opposed to all wars--then come the\r\n     exceptions: wars of 'defense,' 'invasion,' 'emancipation,'\r\n     'liberation,' and all the meaningless tribe. Confusion results. We\r\n     have the German Majority Socialists, i.e., so-called Socialists,\r\n     supporting their government in a war of 'defense' against\r\n     'invasion' and of the maintenance of their 'liberties'--God save\r\n     the mark--against Russian autocracy....\r\n\r\n     \"Without knowing the precise intention of those who drafted the St.\r\n     Louis platform, I infer that it was partly written in the hope--if\r\n     not belief--that the American workers would rise against their\r\n     oppressors and the situation to which they have been subjected. It\r\n     was a ringing declaration--a 'mass movement' of the delegates to\r\n     the convention, later endorsed by the party membership. And as\r\n     these delegates separated hot-foot for home, they got cold feet as\r\n     they dispersed into the cold-footed isolation of the individual\r\n     Socialist scattered here and there throughout this land. The\r\n     platform contained no statement of individual duty, no individual\r\n     program of action Each Socialist began to ask as his feet got\r\n     colder and colder: 'Where are these \"mass movements;\" what are the\r\n     others going to do?' The situation was made worse by the action of\r\n     the National Executive Committee which told every Socialist to read\r\n     the St. Louis platform and then act as his conscience dictated.\r\n     Fine business for a revolutionary mass movement seeking to\r\n     establish the co-operative commonwealth. No anarchist could be more\r\n     individualistic.\r\n\r\n     \"The party's attitude toward war should be cleared up. It should\r\n     definitely provide for mass action, and bind the individuals of the\r\n     party as units of the party mass. This war platform should be\r\n     followed by a Workers' Mobilization plan carefully worked out in\r\n     detail and laying down action in response to each step taken in\r\n     approach to war. For instance, on the introduction of the War\r\n     Declaration in Congress, a one-day general strike just to show the\r\n     rulers what was in store. On passage of the War Declaration a\r\n     general strike, refusal to serve in the military forces, and such\r\n     other measures as may be effective.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Appeal to Reason\" some years ago was the leading Socialist paper of\r\nthe United States. In 1917 it came out in favor of war with the Central\r\nPowers. Either because of this, or because it violently assailed\r\nBolshevism for a long while, it is now outlawed by the greater part of\r\nthe Socialist Party.\r\n\r\nOn the editorial page of \"The Call,\" New York, April 24, 1919, we read:\r\n\r\n     \"Instead of the 'Appeal to Reason' asking for a pardon for Debs, it\r\n     should ask a pardon from Debs.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"The Bulletin,\" Chicago, March 24, 1919, there appears on page 12 a\r\nbitter attack on \"The Appeal\" by no less a personage than Adolph Germer,\r\nNational Secretary of the Socialist Party. In this official paper,\r\nissued by the National Office, Socialist Party, we read:\r\n\r\n     \"An Open Letter to 'The Appeal.'\r\n\r\n     \"_March_ 19, 1919.\r\n\r\n     \"Editor Appeal to Reason,\r\n\r\n     \"Girard, Kans.:\r\n\r\n     \"Sir.--In the issue of the 'Appeal to Reason,' March 15, 1919, you\r\n     publish an appeal for $30,000 CASH, for an alleged 'Amnesty and\r\n     Construction Fight.'\r\n\r\n     \"You give yourself credit for having 'won' the first skirmish in\r\n     the amnesty fight and on the basis of this unfounded claim, you\r\n     justify your appeal for $30,000 CASH.

I\r\n     happen to be one of those who is facing a prison sentence and if\r\n     you have included me in 'many of the comrades,' I want you to\r\n     strike my name from your list. I loathe to be a 'comrade' of yours.\r\n     You and your paper helped to create a hatred against the Socialist\r\n     Party and you wilfully and maliciously lied about the National\r\n     Executive Committee when it refused to follow a course that would\r\n     put more of our members in prison. In other words, you and your\r\n     paper must bear a part of the responsibility for the prosecution\r\n     and persecution of the Socialists and it is rank hypocrisy for you\r\n     to prate about your fight for amnesty.\r\n\r\n     \"Others may speak for themselves, but I scorn any effort that you\r\n     make in my behalf.

On page 28 of his\r\nbooklet, \"From Revolution to Revolution,\" we are told: \"Perhaps we shall\r\nlearn in time, before accentuated capitalism has intensified the\r\nuniversal misery of labor. Socialism is already on its way to the\r\nconquest of Europe. And it may be that we shall yet behold that glorious\r\nuprising of the universal peoples which is to begin man's real history,\r\nand the world's real creation--that united affirmation of the world's\r\nworkers which Socialism foretells, knowing boundaries neither of nations\r\nnor sects nor factions, speaking one voice and working together as one\r\nman for one purpose, filling and cleansing the world with one glad\r\nrevolutionary cry. When the peoples thus come, divine and omnipotent\r\nthrough co-operation, the raw materials of the world-life in their\r\ncreative hands, no longer begging favors or reforms, no longer awed by\r\nthe slave moralities or the slave religions that teach submission to\r\ntheir masters, but risen and regnant in the consciousness of their\r\ncommon inheritance and right in the earth and its fullness, of which\r\nthey are the makers and preservers, then will the antagonisms and\r\ndevastations of classes vanish forever, and the peace of good will\r\nbecome the universal fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"Glorious,\" indeed, have been the uprisings of the Bolsheviki of Russia,\r\nthe Communists of Hungary and Bavaria, and the Spartacans of Germany,\r\nall of whom are Socialists of the most pronounced type. These uprisings,\r\ninstead of being the \"beginnings of the world's real creation,\" are\r\nrather the beginnings of its destruction and ruination. The world's\r\nworkers have been \"wonderfully united\" in Russia, Hungary, Bavaria and\r\nGermany since Socialism came into power--and no better proof need be\r\ngiven than the way in which they have been shooting each other down and\r\ntrying to oust each other from office. Though the Socialists were not\r\nsupposed to know \"the boundaries of nations, sects or factions,\" but\r\nwere to \"speak one voice and work together as one man for one purpose,\"\r\nthe Spartacans, it seems, would be better off if they had not only an\r\nimaginary boundary to separate barbarians of their type from the rest of\r\ncivilization, but a barrier of mountains with heights towering in the\r\nclouds to divide Germany into two parts, in one of which the Spartacans\r\ncould rest in peace, safe from the attacks of their beloved brethren of\r\nthe Ebert-Scheidemann group.\r\n\r\nIf the Communists of Bavaria had only built half a dozen Chinese walls\r\naround Munich, they might still be holding out against the Socialist\r\narmy that besieged them and overcame them. Lenine's Government caused\r\nsuch rivers of blood to flow in Russia that it could well dispense with\r\nimaginary boundary lines to separate \"Bolsheviki Land\" from the domains\r\nof Socialist Siberia. \"One glad revolutionary cry\" was to go up from\r\nSocialists all over the world, but the cry is: \"Workers in\r\nanti-Socialist countries, save us from our false, hypocritical,\r\nreactionary, murderous Marxian brethren!\" Have the Socialist peoples the\r\nworld over become truly \"divine\" by their attacks on God and all\r\nreligions? Have they become \"omnipotent\" wherever they are in power--so\r\nomnipotent that law, order and decency are no longer needed? The \"raw\r\nmaterials of the world were in their creative hands,\" and yet the\r\nRussian people were starving by the millions, and the longer the period\r\nsince the world war, the worse things became in those vast domains once\r\nso famous for their natural resources, wheat, cattle, wool, minerals,\r\noil and wood.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist dream was one of \"no submission to masters;\" but, strange\r\nto say, the dictator, Lenine, rules \"Bolsheviki-Land\" just as he\r\npleases; Bela Kun so ruled Hungary; while the supposedly democratic\r\nSoviets just issued decrees of murder or plunder, and no national\r\nrepresentative body of all the Russians or of all the Hungarians ever\r\nseemed to meet. The Socialists of Russia, Hungary and Bavaria were\r\nindeed \"regnant in the consciousness of their common inheritance,\"\r\nprovided, of course, that by inheritance, confiscated property is meant.\r\nYet although \"antagonism and devastations of classes\" were destined to\r\n\"vanish forever, and the peace of good will become the universal fact,\"\r\nsomehow or other certain \"scientific reformers\" forgot that there were\r\nsuch things as fools' paradises and overlooked the old saying that \"all\r\nthat glitters is not gold.\"\r\n\r\nIn Chapters X and XI much more will be said about the Lenine-Trotzky\r\ndictatorship of Socialist Russia, the Bela Kun administration of\r\nHungary, the criminal Socialist crew of Bavaria, and, of course, the\r\nfiery Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxembourg group that at times in certain\r\nlocalities replaced the Ebert-Scheidemann government of Germany.\r\n\r\nIn \"The Call,\" New York, April 28, 1919, under the caption, \"Socialist\r\nGovernment of Yucatan Grapples With the Binder Trust,\" we read:\r\n\r\n     \"We get vastly less news nowadays from our next-door neighbor,\r\n     Mexico, than from Europe and Asia, therefore a 'Call' reporter,\r\n     meeting a Comrade who has recently returned from the tropic\r\n     peninsula, fell upon him and demanded news of the Socialist, labor\r\n     and co-operative movements there.\r\n\r\n     \"'We are facing a very much tangled-up situation down there,'\r\n     answered the man from Yucatan. He is W. Elkin Birch, a well-known\r\n     American Socialist and business man, who has lived in Mexico\r\n     several years. He came up to 'the States' on a business trip, and\r\n     is returning to Yucatan, where he is prominent in the Socialist and\r\n     co-operative movements.\r\n\r\n     \"'The forces of capitalism in Mexico are so strong, and the\r\n     commercial system is so vicious,' he began, 'that I am not very\r\n     optimistic about the future of Socialism in Yucatan.'\r\n\r\n     \"'But we thought that Alvarado had established almost a paradise\r\n     down there,' cried the reporter. 'A year ago we learned that you\r\n     had elected a complete Socialist administration in Yucatan; then, a\r\n     few months since, we heard that it had not put any part of the\r\n     Socialist program into effect. We wondered what was the reason, but\r\n     hardly any news comes through now.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Alvarado did work a wonderful transformation, and much of the\r\n     good he did remains. It is true, we have an administration of\r\n     Socialists, but we find that that is a very different thing from a\r\n     Socialist administration. Yucatan is still in the grip of the\r\n     commercial interests, and the game is blocked at every move. As\r\n     fast as the radicals devise some means of stopping the robbery of\r\n     the people by special privilege, the privileged interests find a\r\n     way of circumventing the radicals by apparently yielding, but\r\n     really maintaining their domination.\r\n\r\n     \"'Alvarado took over the Reguladora, through which the henequem,\r\n     Yucatan's principal product, is sold for export; he took over the\r\n     railroads, and the line of steamships running to the States....\r\n\r\n     \"'The government still controls the Reguladora, but, as I said, it\r\n     is in a deadlock with the powers who control its market. We still\r\n     have government-owned railroads in Yucatan, but government\r\n     ownership merely takes the public utility out of the hands of\r\n     private capital and places it under the control of a political\r\n     organization. And private capital already has secured control of\r\n     that political organization, and graft and robbery are running\r\n     riot. Government ownership of railroads has increased the cost of\r\n     operation 100 per cent. The payrolls are packed with friends of\r\n     officials and friends of friends. If a man can control a few votes,\r\n     they reason, why shouldn't he have a job? What's the railroad for,\r\n     if not to provide jobs? The folks down there are very much like\r\n     people in other countries, you see.'....\r\n\r\n     \"'But why doesn't the Socialist administration take control of\r\n     industry and commerce, and put the interests out of power?'\r\n     demanded the reporter, determined to uphold the faith in the face\r\n     of disappointing facts.\r\n\r\n     \"'Well, of course, that sounds easy; but Socialists are just\r\n     people, after all, and when a Socialist gets into office he finds\r\n     it quite as hard as ordinary folks to resist the subtle influences\r\n     that surround officials. A man can't be sure that he is a real\r\n     Socialist until he is put to the test of being a part of the\r\n     government. The commercial interests offer him opportunities to\r\n     make money; they give him and his family social advantages. He\r\n     begins to see that capitalism has its good points, after all.' Mr.\r\n     Birch smiled half-satirically, half-tolerantly. 'Some members of\r\n     the Assembly have made fortunes during their year of office. One\r\n     member, who handles concessions, illegal and otherwise, has cleared\r\n     over a million pesos.\"\r\n\r\nThe February, 1918, issue of the \"International Socialist Review,\"\r\nChicago, was suppressed by the authorities of the United States\r\ngovernment, and, as a consequence, it is probable that not very many\r\ncopies are in circulation. The author of \"The Red Conspiracy,\" however,\r\nhas in his possession a copy of this edition, in which there is a very\r\ninteresting article, beginning on page 414, entitled, \"Your Dream Come\r\nTrue.\"\r\n\r\n     \"A Land of practical Socialism in active operation.\r\n\r\n     \"Nearly 4,000,000 people without one cent of money in circulation;\r\n     and where no man owns a foot of land or the tools of\r\n     production--trades unionism, industrialism, single tax and\r\n     socialism all rolled into one.\r\n\r\n     \"Ninety thousand square miles without a policeman; where gold rings\r\n     are placed in the public markets in large baskets, to be had for\r\n     the asking.\r\n\r\n     \"A work day of two hours for the strong; of play for the young,\r\n     middle-aged and old.

Shades of Thomas Moore, Edward Bellamy\r\n     and William Morris arise and rejoice, for your wildest visions have\r\n     become facts.\r\n\r\n     \"Across the miles I stretch my hand in fellowship with Mexico's\r\n     great democrat--Zapata. Don't forget that name. The capitalist\r\n     press has not told much about him--for obvious reasons. He is\r\n     putting into practice the basic principles of co-operation. The\r\n     golden rule is being translated into action.\r\n\r\n     \"General Zapata now absolutely controls 90,000 square miles,\r\n     comprising parts of Morelo, Jalisco, Chapas, Quintana Roo and\r\n     Tabasco. This land is well under cultivation. The population (on a\r\n     rough estimate, without the advantages of a scientific census) is\r\n     from three to four millions. The inhabitants are nearly all peons,\r\n     who for centuries had existed in a degrading state of slavery. More\r\n     than ninety-five per cent. can neither read nor write.\r\n\r\n     \"Zapata's control began in 1910, but only in the three years past\r\n     has the co-operative system been placed on its present basis. The\r\n     greatest development has been made during the past two years.\r\n\r\n     \"Methods of propaganda have been simple and effective. Direct\r\n     action is the keynote. The people awoke to a knowledge of their\r\n     slavery and the realization of their heritage--and took what\r\n     belonged to them. The only message sent to the people was somewhat\r\n     similar to the I. W. W. preamble, but much shorter than that\r\n     classic document.\r\n\r\n     \"Having aroused the slaves to realize their status by saying in\r\n     substance: the rich unjustly possess the land; we want all that is\r\n     ours and are not willing that any man should possess that which is\r\n     not his--Zapata would lead his army into some rich valley and\r\n     simply dispossess the wealthy 'owners.' Then the peons on the land\r\n     would be given the use of the land. Not one man in the ninety\r\n     thousand square miles holds a title to one foot of land. After\r\n     getting the new territory, the land was cultivated and the district\r\n     organized.\r\n\r\n     \"When strong enough the army--the propaganda branch of the\r\n     revolution--held another convention in some other fertile valley\r\n     and benevolently assimilated some other opulent set of\r\n     slave-driving usurpers of the land....\r\n\r\n     \"Every citizen of each community is given a little brass\r\n     citizenship tag. It is necessary to show this only in strange\r\n     towns. It is his passport for whatever he needs for food, clothing\r\n     and shelter. Each person goes into the stores and gets what he\r\n     needs for the simple asking.\r\n\r\n     \"We have heard endless discussions as to the nature of the future\r\n     medium of exchange. Many volumes have been written on the subject.\r\n     Zapata isn't worrying over these problems. He is leaving them where\r\n     they belong--to the philosophers. There isn't any medium of\r\n     exchange in Zapata's land. Why should there be on a free earth? If\r\n     a man wanted ten pairs of sandals or shoes he could have them, but\r\n     why would he want them? He can always go--in Zapata's country--to\r\n     any store and get a pair when he needs one. So with all other\r\n     provisions. In practice, in the few years the plan has been in\r\n     operation, the peons have not abused the privilege. They are\r\n     producers, and realize it. Why rob themselves? There is not one\r\n     idea of profit in all that 90,000 square miles, and human nature is\r\n     just as it was when Adam delved and Eve spun.\r\n\r\n     \"Travelers are not being admitted freely just now, in these\r\n     unsettled times, because of the lying reports carried away by\r\n     spying emissaries of capitalism. But when one is given permission\r\n     to visit the country, his route is marked out and listed on the\r\n     passport given him. He pays the government and then is provided\r\n     freely on all the travels over the designated route.\r\n\r\n     \"No women or children are to be found in any line of manual labor\r\n     in mill, field or factory.\r\n\r\n     \"The young and middle aged men alone work. They work from one and\r\n     one-half to three hours a day. Some will work more steadily for a\r\n     week and then go away to some town for two or three weeks to enjoy\r\n     their country. For the first time in history the workers have a\r\n     country that is really theirs. Workers? Yes, for all are workers.\r\n     There are no landlords or 'bosses' and overseers to prod them into\r\n     exhausting toil. And these people are simple enough to believe that\r\n     man should enjoy life--that all people should find pleasure in\r\n     living.\r\n\r\n     \"Of course there are foremen and superintendents in the\r\n     administration of industry. But they receive no wages, just what\r\n     they need to live on, and every man, woman and child gets that.

The\r\n     refinery still is in operation fourteen hours daily. There are\r\n     seven shifts of workers. All told, there are 25,000 employees of\r\n     that refinery. All are happy and have all of the food, clothing and\r\n     shelter the land affords.

This is the way they spoke of \"Socialism\" in Mexico some years\r\nago, and today they are speaking of it in Russia in much the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\nAct the Second\r\n\r\nScene--A large photo of Zapata--4 by 6 inches, in \"The Call,\" the\r\nSocialist paper of New York City, April 24, 1919.\r\n\r\nUnder the photo there is the following inscription:\r\n\r\n     \"General Emiliano Zapata, Mexico's apostle of terrorism, and\r\n     recently officially reported to have been killed by Carranza's\r\n     troops, was a former plantation stirrup-boy, who, at the zenith of\r\n     his rebel power, gained temporary control of Mexico City. Twice\r\n     since 1910, when he began his revolt in Morelos, he and his Indian\r\n     followers took brief possession of the capital. For nine years he\r\n     ravaged southern Mexico, co-operating for a time in 1914 with\r\n     Villa. He was the most implacable enemy of peaceful reconstruction\r\n     through several regimes. Poor, uneducated, primitive but magnetic,\r\n     Zapata was the leader of Mexico's half-savage Indians, in whose\r\n     power he planned to place control of the country. Toward the last\r\n     he was little more than a hunted renegade, and is reported to have\r\n     been killed by strategy of troops operating under General Pablo\r\n     Gonzales in Morelos.\"\r\n\r\nThe wood-cut of Zapata appears in connection with an article by Jack\r\nNeville, part of which is hereby quoted:\r\n\r\n     \"Cuautla, Mexico, April 23.--The death of Emiliano Zapata removes\r\n     Mexico's most ruthless destructionist and implacable enemy of\r\n     peaceful regeneration.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, on the wreckage of his empire, where the rebel chief laughed\r\n     at civilization and played his huge joke on 100,000 confiding\r\n     workers, General Pablo Gonzalez is placing firm underpinning for\r\n     freedom and progress.\r\n\r\n     \"Here in the world's richest garden spot, where exploited humanity\r\n     has been kept poorest, and where Zapata 'gave' his half-savage\r\n     followers the land only to commandeer all crops--here the peon is\r\n     for the first time in centuries enjoying the fruits of his toil and\r\n     supporting instead of hating government.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, April 25th, 1919. \"The Call\" published another article of\r\nNeville's under the title, \"Mexican Peons Rejoice in First Taste of\r\nFreedom.\" Only a small part of the article will be quoted:\r\n\r\n     \"I stepped into a pulque-reeking cantina. A group of former\r\n     Zapatistas invited me to join them--to have a glass. It was the\r\n     open sesame. They chattered like children. Presented me with\r\n     cornhusk cigarettes; told me tales of Zapata; his perfidy, his\r\n     ruthlessness.\r\n\r\n     \"'Not more than 800 rebels were yet in arms when Zapata was\r\n     killed,' they said. These, they explained, had ousted Zapata from\r\n     leadership because he had refused to divide the loot with them.\r\n     They told me of Zapata's former army of 30,000, blood-letting\r\n     surianos and ayetes (unarmed men carrying ropes) who formed the\r\n     rear guard to carry away the loot....\r\n\r\n     \"Alongside the old church, where the patriot Morelos had more than\r\n     a century ago made a successful stand against the Spaniards, a\r\n     train was disgorging families returning to their homes, now that\r\n     Zapata was gone.\r\n\r\n     \"A little man stepped out--the bishop of Cuernavaca, coming back to\r\n     his diocese under the conciliatory program of Don Pablo after eight\r\n     years' exile.\r\n\r\n     \"I rode into the country with Colonel Sanchez Neira and talked with\r\n     the workmen in the field.

We rode down\r\n     the Inter-Oceanic railway and viewed the right of way, strewn with\r\n     wrecked rolling stock. We saw utterly demolished villages, the work\r\n     of Zapata and communism.\r\n\r\n     \"I saw a bridge where train after train was dynamited, where\r\n     Zapatistas had ruthlessly executed more than three thousand\r\n     peaceful men, women and children passengers.\"\r\n\r\nFrom these articles published in \"The Call,\" the great Socialist paper\r\nof New York City, it seems that the poverty-stricken, perpetually\r\nbegging staff of Hillquit's paper does not relish the Chicago brand of\r\nSocialism described so beautifully in the \"International Socialist\r\nReview.\" The more \"talented\" and \"progressive\" \"evolutionists\" near the\r\nshore of Lake Michigan have many a year's hard work to perform before\r\nthey can sufficiently develop the brains of their backward chums and\r\nbrethren on the lower east side of New York City. It takes editors like\r\nKerr, Haywood, the Marcys and all the Bohns on the staff of the\r\n\"Review\" to reveal the true glories of Socialism.\r\n\r\nAs recently as February, 1920, it could safely be said that the\r\nprinciples of Socialism had never been put into full operation in any\r\ncountry. The nearest approach to a truly Socialist state is Bolshevist\r\nRussia, that strife-ridden land of crime and bloodshed. The penalty paid\r\nfor the foolish attempt has already been a dreadful one. How much\r\ngreater it will be, as time goes on, nobody knows. The Socialists of\r\nAmerica have hailed Russian Bolshevism as true Socialism; but, no doubt,\r\nas the evil consequences of Lenine's Red rule become more widely known\r\nand more universally feared, or if, even on the low ground of\r\nmaterialistic economics, the attempt fails, the slippery Marxians will\r\ntry to prove that Bolshevism was not Socialism after all, since the\r\nRussian government was a dictatorship, with the principles of Socialism\r\nnever fully applied.\r\n\r\nWe should add that even if the Russian dictatorship succeeds in\r\nrealizing the mere economic success which seems to be the height of its\r\nambition, this will not prove to be an argument in favor of Socialism,\r\nbut a terrible indictment of it. For the road the dictatorship is now\r\ntaking, which indeed offers it the only possible hope of even a passable\r\neconomic success, is the barren, heartless, unspiritual, materialistic\r\ntyranny of machine-like \"industrialism\" which the I. W. W. represents.\r\nIn the two chapters immediately following, VIII and IX, the reader will\r\nlearn something of the loss of all moral standards and the cruel,\r\nlawless violence to which the atheistic, anarchistic materialism of\r\nI. W. W.'ism leads; and will also find that Bolshevism is already\r\ncommitted to this system as the only economic solution of its bloody\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nIs it worth while? In Chapters X and XI the reader will face some of the\r\nappalling details of the blood, violence and despair which have been\r\ntyrannically imposed upon Russia's groaning millions for the sake of an\r\nexperiment which leads to nothing but the pagan barbarism of I. W.\r\nW.'ism. Is it worth while? Even if at last they are able to produce and\r\ndistribute enough to clothe and feed themselves, can human beings be\r\nhappy in such a state? Is this the dream of the dreamer come true?\r\n\r\nAgain, the hope of a bare economic solution of the question of bread and\r\nbutter is possible in Russia only through such an absolute and tyrannous\r\ndictatorship as has been established, under which the reluctant and\r\ndisorganized proletariat can be forced back to work, whether they wish\r\nor no, at the point of the bayonets of the Red Guard. Would the American\r\nworking-man think this worth while in America?\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the Lenine desperadoes are determined to win an\r\neconomic success even at the cost of forcing Russian labor to toil under\r\nliteral military conscription. If they do this, they may\r\nsucceed--economically merely. But does American labor think such an\r\nexperiment _here_ would be worth what it costs?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in the Russian land of Socialistic experiment the people,\r\nleft to themselves by the other nations, cannot find peace among\r\nthemselves. Why should there be peace as long as any manhood is left in\r\nRussia to lift up its hand out of its despair against its Bolshevist\r\noppressors? Is civil war worth while--for such a barren result?\r\n\r\nFinally, if the proletarian tyrants wear all Russia down until a spirit\r\nof resistance is left in no breast, still will there be no peace; for,\r\nas will be found quoted elsewhere in this book, Lenine declares that\r\nSocialism cannot endure in a world half Socialistic and half\r\nCapitalistic, so that his wretched Russian slaves seem likely to be\r\ndragged into a war against the rest of the world to help out the crazy\r\nexperiment of domination by the proletariat. Is it worth while?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE I. W. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe I. W. W., or the so-called \"Industrial Workers of the World,\" whose\r\npolicy may be summed up in the words, \"I Want to Wreck,\" and who in\r\nderision are termed the \"I Won't Works,\" the \"Imported Weary Willies\"\r\nand the \"Wobblies,\" enjoy the unenviable reputation of being classed\r\namong the most insurrectionary, impious and infamous workers of the\r\nworld to-day. This industrial union, also known as the One Big Union, is\r\nthe bitter rival of the American Federation of Labor. Joseph J. Ettor,\r\nin his I. W. W. pamphlet, \"Industrial Unionism,\" page 5, speaking of the\r\nfear that people have of the I. W. W. says:\r\n\r\n     \"Yes, gentle reader, our ideas, our principles and object are\r\n     certainly dangerous and menacing, applied by a united working class\r\n     would shake society and certainly those who are now on top\r\n     sumptuously feeding upon the good things they have not produced\r\n     would feel the shock.\"\r\n\r\nThe I. W. W. was organized at a secret conference in Chicago, January 2,\r\n1905, attended by 26 of the most radical Socialists in the country,\r\nincluding Eugene V. Debs, William D. Haywood, William E. Trautman,\r\nThomas J. Haggerty, Daniel MacDonald, Charles H. Moyer, Charles O.\r\nSherman, Frank Bohn and A. M. Simons. Daniel De Leon was prominent at\r\nthe first convention, June 27, 1905, and for three years afterward, the\r\norganization being founded on his theory that the Socialistic revolution\r\nwould not come by voting but by a violent seizure of the industries of\r\nthe country by Socialistic workmen industrially organized.\r\n\r\n\"The One Big Union Monthly,\" March 1, 1919, page 4, referring to the\r\nhungry and desperate masses tells us:\r\n\r\n     \"In some countries these revolting, desperate masses may come out\r\n     victorious, and establish a rule of their own, like the Russian\r\n     Bolsheviki, only to find that they will have to keep on running\r\n     society on private ownership basis, until industrial organization\r\n     of the workers is so far advanced that it can take over the\r\n     responsibility. There is no way in which the masses can escape\r\n     industrial unionism. What they do not want to do now at our\r\n     prompting, they will have to do later of their own initiative,\r\n     driven by economic necessity. Our new society is bound to come. It\r\n     will be firmly established in ten years if we are energetic. It\r\n     will take longer if we are indifferent. We cannot stand still\r\n     socially, because there is no footing before we reach the bottom.\r\n     We cannot go back, any more than the butterfly can again become a\r\n     larva. We must go forward to Industrial Democracy.\"\r\n\r\nOn page 23 of the same issue of \"The One Big Union Monthly\" we are\r\ninformed that Industrial Unionism is International:\r\n\r\n     \"Industrial unionism arises out of and is modeled after modern\r\n     capitalism. Unlike trade unionism, it is not born of the capitalism\r\n     of fifty years ago. Industrial unionism recognizes that capitalism\r\n     is not only interindustrial, so to speak, but also international.\r\n     That just as it binds industries together by means of machine\r\n     processes and financial investments, so also does capitalism tend\r\n     to bind nations together. Industrial unionism follows the same\r\n     trend. It, too, is not only interindustrial but also international.\r\n     Industrial unionism seeks to organize the industrial workers of the\r\n     world just as capitalism seeks to exploit them. Industrial unionism\r\n     is spreading wherever international capitalism exists. Like\r\n     international capitalism, industrial unionism knows no boundaries,\r\n     color, race, creed or sex. As international capitalism knows only\r\n     profit, industrial unionism knows only the industrial exploitation\r\n     by which profit is possible. Industrial unionism organizes to make\r\n     industrial exploitation an impossibility. And capitalism is its\r\n     most valued assistant.\"\r\n\r\nEttor, in \"Industrial Unionism,\" page 21, tells us, that the I. W. W.\r\ndoes not organize by trades, but by industries: \"All the workers in any\r\nplant, factory, mine, mill or any given industry in a given locality\r\norganize in one Local Industrial Union. All the Local Industrial Unions\r\nof a given general industry are banded together in the National\r\nIndustrial Union. The National Industrial Unions are banded again\r\nstronger in the Industrial Department and then all Departments, six in\r\nall, are brought under one head, the General Administration of the I. W.\r\nW. One Big Union of all workers, welded together in such a manner that,\r\nimbued with the war cry: 'an injury to one is an injury to all,' all its\r\nmembers can act together in fighting the common enemy.\"\r\n\r\nExplaining organization by industries rather than by trades, \"The One\r\nBig Union Monthly,\" March 1, 1919, page 25, takes for instance the\r\nstockyards:\r\n\r\n     \"We do not know how many crafts there are in the stockyards, but\r\n     there are many. According to the old style, these crafts would be\r\n     organized each by itself, the carpenters belonging to the national\r\n     union of carpenters, the engineers to the national union of\r\n     engineers, the butchers to the national union of butchers, etc. It\r\n     also belongs to old style unionism to leave the unskilled workers\r\n     unorganized. Our method would be to organize all the workers in a\r\n     plant, as a branch of the Stockyard Workers' Industrial Union. This\r\n     would imply the cancelling of trade distinctions and craft lines.\r\n     As against the employer we would face him not as butchers,\r\n     laborers, carpenters or engineers, but as stockyard workers, no\r\n     matter whether we are office clerks or laborers, or carpenters, or\r\n     engineers. This is what we mean with industrial unionism. The\r\n     various branches would combine into district organizations if\r\n     necessary, and all of them together would form the Stockyard\r\n     Workers' Industrial Union as part of the Industrial Workers of the\r\n     World. By being thus organized we hope to be able to carry on the\r\n     fight locally, or by districts, or on a national scale with better\r\n     chance of success, than if we were split up in a great number of\r\n     unions in each plant, with little or no contact with one another.\r\n     The advantages of the one big union idea are so apparent that no\r\n     honest worker will, in earnest, contradict us.\"\r\n\r\nThe famous Preamble to the platform of the I. W. W. throws a startling\r\nlight upon this revolutionary industrial union, which has, within recent\r\nyears, been getting a very strong hold on immigrants from Europe:\r\n\r\n     \"The working class and the employing class have nothing in common.\r\n     There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among\r\n     millions of the working people, and the few who make up the\r\n     employing class have all the good things of life.\r\n\r\n     \"Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers\r\n     of the world organize as a class, take possession of the earth and\r\n     the machinery of production and abolish the wage system.\r\n\r\n     \"We find that the centering of the management of industries into\r\n     fewer hands makes the trade unions unable to cope with the\r\n     ever-growing power of the employing class.\r\n\r\n     \"These conditions can be changed and the interests of the working\r\n     class upheld only by an organization formed in such a way that all\r\n     its members in any one industry, or in all industries if necessary,\r\n     cease work whenever a strike or lockout is on in any department\r\n     thereof, thus making an injury to one, an injury to all.\r\n\r\n     \"Instead of the conservative motto, 'A fair day's wages for a fair\r\n     day's work,' we must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary\r\n     watchword, 'Abolition of the wage system.'\r\n\r\n     \"It is the historic mission of the working class to do away with\r\n     capitalism. The army of production must be organized, not only for\r\n     the every-day struggle with the capitalists, but also to carry on\r\n     production when capitalism shall have been overthrown. By\r\n     organizing industrially we are forming a structure of the new\r\n     society within the shell of the old.\"\r\n\r\nGiovannitti, editor of the New York City Italian Socialist publication,\r\n\"Il Proletario,\" one of the official Socialist organs enumerated in the\r\n\"Proceedings[9] of the 1910 National Congress of the Socialist Party,\"\r\nwriting in the April 5, 1913, edition of his paper, says:\r\n\r\n     \"The aim of the Socialists and of the Syndicalists is precisely\r\n     that of dispossessing the middle class by transferring property to\r\n     the working class.\r\n\r\n     \"We shall take possession of the industries for three very simple\r\n     reasons: because we need them, because we desire them, and because\r\n     we have the power to take them.\r\n\r\n     \"Whether it is just or unjust, moral or immoral, it is no concern\r\n     to us. We shall waste no time whatever in providing the validity of\r\n     our legal titles, yet, if it will be necessary, after the\r\n     dispossession will have been accomplished, we shall engage a couple\r\n     of lawyers and judges to adjust the contracts and to render the act\r\n     perfectly legal and respectable. So, too, if it will be necessary,\r\n     we shall find a couple of most learned bishops to sanctify it.\r\n     These matters can always be arranged--all that is strong and\r\n     powerful becomes in time just and moral--and for this reason, we\r\n     Syndicalists maintain that the social revolution is not a question\r\n     of necessity and justice, but of necessity and strength.\"\r\n\r\n\"The New Unionism,\" by Tridon, on page 112, informs us that Arturo\r\nGiovannitti was, in turn, a minter, a bookkeeper, a theological student,\r\na mission preacher and a tramp. Ettor, in \"Industrial Unionism,\" page\r\n15, speaking of the I. W. W. principles of morality, says:\r\n\r\n     \"New conceptions of Right and Wrong must generate and permeate the\r\n     workers. We must look on conduct and actions that advance the\r\n     social and economic position of the working class as Right,\r\n     ethically, legally, religiously, socially and by every other\r\n     measurement. That conduct and those actions which aid, help to\r\n     maintain and give comfort to the capitalist class, we must consider\r\n     as Wrong by every standard.\"\r\n\r\n\"The New Unionism,\" page 104, gives us Vincent St. John's statement of\r\nthe methods and tactics employed by the I. W. W., of which he has been a\r\nprominent leader:\r\n\r\n     \"As a revolutionary organization the Industrial Workers of the\r\n     World aims to use any and all tactics that will get the results\r\n     sought with the least expenditure of time and energy. The tactics\r\n     used are determined solely by the power of the organization to make\r\n     good in their use. The question of 'right' and 'wrong' does not\r\n     concern us. No terms made with an employer are final. All peace so\r\n     long as the wage system lasts is but an armed truce. At any\r\n     favorable opportunity the struggle for more control of industry is\r\n     renewed....\r\n\r\n     \"The organization does not allow any part to enter into time\r\n     contracts with the employers. It aims where strikes are used, to\r\n     paralyze all branches of the industry involved, when the employers\r\n     can least afford a cessation of work--during the busy season and\r\n     when there are rush orders to be filled.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Socialist Labor Party paper, \"Weekly People,\" New York, February\r\n10, 1912, the following article by Arthur Giovannitti shows the part\r\nthat the I. W. W. is expected to take in bringing about the Marxian\r\nrebellion through the instrumentality of a general strike:\r\n\r\n     \"The future of Socialism lies only in the general strike, not\r\n     merely a quiet political strike, but one that once started should\r\n     go fatally to its end, i.e., armed insurrection, and the forcible\r\n     overthrow of all existing social conditions.... The task of\r\n     revolution is not to construct the new society, but to demolish the\r\n     old one, and, therefore, its first aim should be at the complete\r\n     destruction of the existing state, so as to render it absolutely\r\n     powerless to react and re-establish itself.... The I. W. W. must\r\n     develop itself as the new legislature and the new executive body of\r\n     the land, undermine the existing one, and gradually absorb the\r\n     functions of the state until it can entirely substantiate it\r\n     through the only means it has, the revolution.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1919, plans for a nation-wide strike on July 4th were\r\ndisclosed by I. W. W. orators at a mass meeting in the workingmen's\r\nhall, 119 South Throop Street, Chicago. It was Simms, a colored man, who\r\ngave the details of the strike plan:\r\n\r\n     \"The workmen will lay down their tools on July 4th, and on the\r\n     morning of July 5th not one will take them up again....\r\n\r\n     \"It will be the opening of the social revolution. Moreover, not one\r\n     workman will take up his tools again until every prisoner of the\r\n     workers now incarcerated in the capitalistic prisons is released.\"\r\n\r\n\"The One Big Union Monthly,\" March 1, 1919, page 22, declares:\r\n\r\n     \"Socialism rears new institutions. It weaves a new fabric for our\r\n     social life. In Russia it is the Soviets; in America it is the One\r\n     Big Union. This fabric is proletarian only. Within its limits the\r\n     Socialist Revolutionist halts. This new organism--this One Big\r\n     Union--may, or may not seek Democracy. Democracy is merely a method\r\n     of governing. If that method leads to Socialist goals it will be\r\n     followed. Otherwise, we will seek further for our avenue. But the\r\n     great end is proletarianism. It is the social ownership of the\r\n     means of production. It is the creation of a society where all\r\n     classes will be melted into one, and where the class war will\r\n     soften into an all-race proletarianism.\"\r\n\r\nAnother I. W. W. publication, \"The Evolution of Industrial Democracy,\"\r\npage 40, speaking of government after the \"Wobblies\" get into power,\r\ngoes still further:\r\n\r\n     \"Government, as now understood will disappear--there being no\r\n     servile class to be held in subjection--but in its place will be an\r\n     administration of affairs.\"\r\n\r\nRelative to property rights in the future, \"The Evolution of Industrial\r\nDemocracy,\" page 39, informs us:\r\n\r\n     \"Rights of inheritance would disappear with the right to hold\r\n     private property in the lands, tools and machinery of production.\r\n     Any accumulation by the individual that might be used for\r\n     exploitation would pass to the collectivity at the death of the\r\n     holder. Society would be the heir of the individual and, vice\r\n     versa, the individuals would be the heirs of society. The right to\r\n     freely function at the machines and enjoy the social value of his\r\n     toil would guarantee the worker a full competence.\"\r\n\r\nAs regards compensation for work in accordance with the I. W. W. plan,\r\nwe are told on page 39:\r\n\r\n     \"Compensation in the industries would necessarily be upon the basis\r\n     of the 'man-day'--the average production of an average man in an\r\n     average day when working under average conditions--and in those\r\n     industries not of an actual productive nature, such as 'public\r\n     service,' etc., the man-day must prevail there also (being based\r\n     upon the average production of all the industries served) for the\r\n     reason that no man could be induced to serve for less than that\r\n     average--to do so being to confess himself an inferior being--and\r\n     to compel him to serve for less would be to set up a new slavery,\r\n     which the moral sense of the new community could not endure.\"\r\n\r\nGiovannitti, in \"Il Proletario,\" New York, April 5, 1913, gives a lesson\r\nin sabotage to the Italian Socialists and members of the I. W. W.:\r\n\r\n     \"We are not yet sufficiently strong to restore them [i.e., the\r\n     instruments of production] to ourselves, it is true, but it is also\r\n     true that we cannot allow any opportunity to escape of reaping any\r\n     advantage from them.\r\n\r\n     \"Thus, if to-morrow we shall be justified in wrenching from\r\n     capitalism all the industries, why, when it is a question of life\r\n     or death for us to win or to lose a strike, is it not just to\r\n     remove a screw, derange a wheel, break a thread, or commit, in any\r\n     way whatever, an act of sabotage on a machine which otherwise would\r\n     become the very beginning of our defeat in the hands of the scabs?\r\n\r\n     \"We cannot understand how it is still possible while we have a\r\n     right to all the produce of our work, we have not an entire right\r\n     to a part of it.\"\r\n\r\nOther illustrations of sabotage may be of interest to the reader. The\r\nfollowing one is taken from the Chicago \"Syndicalist,\" February 15,\r\n1913:\r\n\r\n     \"A few drops of sulphuric acid placed on top of a pile of woolen or\r\n     cotton goods never stops going down.\r\n\r\n     \"Two decks of cards in a grain separator cover the screen and cause\r\n     the grain to vanish out of the blower.\r\n\r\n     \"A piece of iron dropped in a crucible full of glass will eat\r\n     through it. Crucibles are made of graphite and cost $40.\r\n\r\n     \"A handful of salt in paint will allow a good-looking job for a day\r\n     or two, but when dry will fall off in sheets.\r\n\r\n     \"Maclay Hoyne, Chicago's district attorney, is analyzing a\r\n     spontaneous fire powder that allows the user to be miles away when\r\n     it breaks forth.\r\n\r\n     \"Castor oil capsules dissolved in varnish destroy the ability of\r\n     the latter to dry. The job must be washed down and started all over\r\n     again.\r\n\r\n     \"The suffragettes of England have significantly notified their\r\n     opponents that a fire in every shire was the way the word was\r\n     flashed in days gone by.\"\r\n\r\nPages 40 to 48 of \"The New Unionism,\" by Tridon, furnish us with some\r\nmore barbarous examples of sabotage:\r\n\r\n     \"We may distinguish three forms of sabotage:\r\n\r\n     \"1. Active sabotage which consists in the damaging of goods or\r\n     machinery.\r\n\r\n     \"2. Open-mouthed sabotage, beneficial to the ultimate consumer, and\r\n     which consists in exposing or defeating fraudulent commercial\r\n     practices.\r\n\r\n     \"3. Obstructionism or passive sabotage, which consists in carrying\r\n     out orders literally, regardless of consequences.\r\n\r\n     \"If you are an engineer you can, with two cents' worth of powdered\r\n     stone or a pinch of sand, stall your machine, cause a loss of time\r\n     or make expensive repairs necessary. If you are a joiner or\r\n     woodworker, what is simpler than to ruin furniture without your\r\n     boss noticing it, and thereby drive his customers away? A garment\r\n     worker can easily spoil a suit or a bolt of cloth; if you are\r\n     working in a department store, a few spots on a fabric cause it to\r\n     be sold for next to nothing; a grocery clerk, by packing up goods\r\n     carelessly, brings about a smashup; in the woolen or the\r\n     haberdashery trade a few drops of acid on the goods you are\r\n     wrapping will make a customer furious ... an agricultural laborer\r\n     may sow bad seed in wheat fields,\" etc.\r\n\r\n     \"With two cents' worth of a certain stuff, used by one who knows, a\r\n     locomotive can be made absolutely useless.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The first thing to do before going out on strike is to cripple all\r\n     the machinery. Then the contest is even between employer and\r\n     worker, for the cessation of work really stops all life in the\r\n     capitalists' camp. Are bakery workers planning to go on strike? Let\r\n     them pour in the ovens a few pints of petroleum or of any other\r\n     greasy or pungent matter. After that, soldiers or scabs may come\r\n     and bake bread. The smell will not come out of the tiles for three\r\n     months. Is a strike in sight in steel mills? Pour sand or emery\r\n     into the oil cups.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The electrical industry is one of the most important industries,\r\n     as an interruption in the current means a lack of light and power\r\n     in factories; it also means a reduction in the means of\r\n     transportation and a stoppage of the telegraph and telephone\r\n     systems. How can the power be cut off? By the curtailing in the\r\n     mine the output of the coal necessary for feeding the machinery or\r\n     stopping the coal cars on their way to the electrical plants. If\r\n     the fuel reaches its destination what is simpler than to set the\r\n     pockets on fire and have the coal burn in the yards instead of the\r\n     furnaces? It is child's play to put out of work the elevators and\r\n     other automatic devices which carry coal to the fire room. To put\r\n     boilers out of order use explosives or silicates or a plain glass\r\n     bottle which thrown on the glowing coals hinders the combustion and\r\n     clogs up the smoke exhausts. You can also use acids to corrode\r\n     boiler tubes; acid fumes will ruin cylinders and piston rods. A\r\n     small quantity of some corrosive substance, a handful of emery will\r\n     be the end of oil cups. When it comes to dynamos or transformers,\r\n     short circuits and inversion of poles can be easily managed.\r\n     Underground cables can be destroyed by fire, water or explosives,\"\r\n     etc.\r\n\r\n\"The New Unionism,\" the book from which the above quotations were taken\r\nand which was purchased by the author of \"The Red Conspiracy\" at the I.\r\nW.

The One\r\nBig Industrial Union and, of course, the Socialist Party then proclaim\r\ntheir innocence, collect funds for their defense, and urge all the\r\nworking men of our country to strike in behalf of amnesty for \"poor,\r\npersecuted, noble protagonists of the cause of labor jailed because\r\nfreedom of speech and liberty of action are no longer tolerated by the\r\ngovernment.\" Thus on page 409 of the February, 1918, edition of the\r\n\"International Socialist Review,\" which was suppressed by the United\r\nStates Government, we read:\r\n\r\n     \"Socialists Demand Fair Trial for Indicted I. W. W.--In a\r\n     declaration adopted by its National Executive Committee the\r\n     Socialist Party calls for a fair and unprejudiced trial for the\r\n     indicted members of the Industrial Workers of the World. The demand\r\n     says:\r\n\r\n     \"'The Socialist Party repeats its declaration of support of all\r\n     economic organizations of the working class and declares the\r\n     lynching, deportation, prosecution and persecution of the\r\n     Industrial Workers of the World is an attack upon every toiler in\r\n     America, and we now call attention to the fact that the charges of\r\n     incendiarism, the burning of crops and forests and of vicious\r\n     destruction of property, made by the public press against the I. W.\r\n     W., have been proven pure fabrications when put to legal test. The\r\n     Socialist Party has always extended its aid, material and moral, to\r\n     organized labor wherever and whenever it has been attacked by the\r\n     capitalist class, and this without reference to form of\r\n     organization or special policies; therefore we pledge our support\r\n     to the Industrial Workers of the World now facing trial in Chicago\r\n     and elsewhere, and demand for them a fair and unprejudiced trial\r\n     and urge our members to use every effort to assist the Industrial\r\n     Workers of the World by familiarizing the public with the real\r\n     facts, to overcome the falsehoods and misinformation with which\r\n     the capitalist press has poisoned and prejudiced the public mind\r\n     and judgment against these workers, who are now singled out for\r\n     destruction, just as other labor organizations and leaders have\r\n     been singled out for destruction by the same capitalist forces in\r\n     the past.\"\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Party, in pledging its support to the Industrial Workers\r\nof the World, pledges its support to a revolutionary organization like\r\nitself. \"The One Big Union Monthly,\" March 1, 1919, page 4, under the\r\ncaption, \"The Red Tidal Wave,\" says:\r\n\r\n     \"With great satisfaction we record the fact that the red\r\n     revolutionary wave is encircling the globe, sweeping away the last\r\n     remnants of feudal rubbish from the body social, and some of the\r\n     capitalistic. The world war acted like a vigorous laxative on the\r\n     stomach of the nations.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The Rebel Worker,\" an I. W. W. paper of New York City, in its\r\n     issue of April 15, 1919, after printing the word, \"Revolution\" in\r\n     the heaviest type all the way across the paper, publishes an\r\n     article on the first page entitled \"Terrible Days Ahead in the\r\n     United States.\"\r\n\r\n     \"'The United States is in the grip of a bloody revolution!\r\n     Thousands of workers are slaughtered by machine guns in New York\r\n     City! Washington is on fire! Industry is at a standstill and\r\n     thousands of workers are starving! The government is using the most\r\n     brutal and repressive measures to put down the revolution!\r\n     Disorganization, crime, chaos, rape, murder and arson are the order\r\n     of the day--the inevitable results of social revolution!'\r\n\r\n     \"The above is what we may expect to see on the front pages of what\r\n     few newspapers survive the upheaval. No one who has the interest of\r\n     the working class at heart wants to see such a revolution. But\r\n     whether those interested in the working class want to see such a\r\n     revolution or not, there are powerful forces in the United States\r\n     that are making for just such a catastrophe. The Industrial Workers\r\n     of the World has in the past and is now using all of its energies\r\n     to avert such a cataclysmic debacle. It is not yet too late to\r\n     avoid this terrible and sanguinary strife--provided that the I. W. W.\r\n     is allowed to carry out its program of organizing and educating the\r\n     workers for the purpose of taking control of, and operating\r\n     industry and giving to those who work the full social value of the\r\n     product of their labor.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The New Solidarity,\" the Chicago organ of the I. W. W., in its\r\n     edition of April 19, 1919, publishes on the editorial page an\r\n     article entitled, \"When We Are Ready,\" part of which is hereby\r\n     quoted:\r\n\r\n     \"Frequently the question is asked how the proletariat is to know\r\n     when they are ready for the revolution, how it would be possible to\r\n     know a sufficient number were class conscious enough for the\r\n     revolutionary change. This question is asked with the idea that\r\n     there must be a periodical counting of noses, and that little or\r\n     nothing may be done except educate until an absolute majority has\r\n     been obtained....\r\n\r\n     \"It matters not how many members of the working class do or do not\r\n     stand up to be counted for or against capitalism, just as soon as\r\n     the organized workers can overthrow that system of industry they\r\n     will do it and not wait to be counted....\r\n\r\n     \"To wait for majorities at all times is to enervate and emasculate\r\n     the working class movement. To constantly attack, and attack for\r\n     the purpose of taking and administering industry for the workers by\r\n     action on the job and in the Union halls, is to strengthen and\r\n     encourage the workers in their task, and is the plan that must\r\n     ultimately win the age-long struggle against exploitation.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 5, 1917, the I. W. W. headquarters, 1001 West Madison\r\nstreet, Chicago, and the Socialist headquarters were raided by the\r\nUnited States authorities. On March 10, 1919, Solicitor General Lamar of\r\nthe Post Office Department submitted a memorandum to the Senate\r\npropaganda committee stating that the I. W. W., anarchists, socialists\r\nand others were \"perfecting an amalgamation with one object--the\r\noverthrow of the government of the United States by means of a bloody\r\nrevolution and the establishment of a Bolshevik Republic.\" Mr. Lamar\r\nsaid his conclusion was based upon information contained in seized mail\r\nmatter. Accompanying the memorandum were several hundred excerpts from\r\nthe mail matter. The solicitor named the following organs, published in\r\nthe interest of the I. W. W. or Bolshevist movements: \"The New\r\nSolidarity,\" English, weekly, Chicago; \"One Big Union,\" English,\r\nmonthly, Chicago; \"Industrial Unionist,\" English, weekly, Seattle;\r\n\"California Defense Bulletin,\" English, weekly, San Francisco; \"The\r\nRebel Worker,\" English, bi-monthly, New York; \"La Neuva Solidaridad,\"\r\nSpanish, weekly, Chicago; \"Golos Truzenta,\" Russian, weekly, Chicago;\r\n\"Il Nuovo Proletario,\" Italian, weekly, Chicago; \"Nya Varlden,\"\r\nSwedish, weekly, Chicago; \"Der Industrialer Arbiter,\" Jewish, weekly,\r\nChicago; \"Probuda,\" Bulgarian, weekly, Chicago; \"A. Fels Badulas,\"\r\nHungarian, weekly, Chicago. After referring to the excerpts from the\r\nseized mail matter, the solicitor general's memorandum said in part:\r\n\"This propaganda is being conducted with such regularity that its\r\nmagnitude can be measured by the bold and outspoken statements contained\r\nin these publications and the efforts made therein to inaugurate a\r\nnation-wide reign of terror and overthrow of the government.\r\n\r\n     \"In classifying these statements, they are submitted in a major or\r\n     general class as follows: I. W. W., anarchistic,\r\n     radical-socialistic and socialist. It will be seen from these\r\n     excerpts and it is indeed significant that this is the first time\r\n     in the history of the so-called radical movement in the United\r\n     States that the radical elements have found a common cause\r\n     (Bolshevism) in which they can all unite. The I. W. W.,\r\n     anarchistic, socialists, radical and otherwise, in fact all\r\n     dissatisfied elements, particularly the foreign element, are\r\n     perfecting amalgamation with one object, and with one object in\r\n     view, namely, the overthrow of the government of the United States\r\n     by the means of a bloody revolution and the establishment of a\r\n     Bolshevik republic.\r\n\r\n     \"The I. W. W. is perhaps most actively engaged in spreading this\r\n     propaganda and has at its command a large field force known as\r\n     recruiting agents, subscription agents, etc., who work unceasingly\r\n     in the furtherance of 'the cause!'\r\n\r\n     \"This organization publishes at least five newspapers in the\r\n     English language and nine in foreign languages. This list comprises\r\n     only official papers of the organization and does not take into\r\n     account the large number of free lance papers published in the\r\n     interest of the above organization.\"\r\n\r\nIn the April 19, 1913, edition of \"Solidarity,\" the eastern organ of the\r\nI. W. W., we are informed that \"among other diseases common to all\r\nnations and particularly prevalent in the United States is respect for\r\nlaw and order.\" The same edition of the paper extends greetings to \"all\r\nRebels\" from its new home in Cleveland.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1913 Paterson strike, which was managed by the I. W. W.,\r\nQuinlan, one of the leaders, declared on May 17th:\r\n\r\n     \"Paterson is a dangerous place to live in just at this time, no\r\n     matter in what direction you are looking. The longer the strike\r\n     lasts, the stronger and more bitter and the madder the workers are\r\n     growing. Out of it all we want to build up an organization that\r\n     will be able to fight efficiently, and fight to win--to fight to\r\n     win, if necessary, by dying.\r\n\r\n     \"And we are going to win this strike or Paterson will be wiped off\r\n     the map. If the strike is not won Paterson will be a howling\r\n     wilderness and a graveyard industrially, because the workers will\r\n     not stay there. We have had too long and bitter a fight to lay down\r\n     what we have gained so far. Heaven might fall and hell might break\r\n     loose, but the strike is going to be won.\"\r\n\r\nBoyd, another speaker, is reported as saying on the same day:\r\n\r\n     \"We are going to get what we want whether the courts want it or\r\n     not. We are going to call a general strike, if it is necessary, to\r\n     free our fellow-workers. We are going to cut off the lights in\r\n     Paterson, and tie up the street car system. We shall reduce the\r\n     city to a condition of absolute helplessness. We are going to\r\n     paralyze Paterson, and we are going to win in Paterson just as we\r\n     are going to win in New York City.\"\r\n\r\nRobert Plunkett, said to be a former Cornell student, who was introduced\r\nas a \"fellow-worker,\" urged the strikers and their sympathizers to use\r\nevery means to free their leaders, even if Paterson had to \"starve or go\r\nnaked.\" He said that the lights would be put out in Paterson, and that\r\nthe street cars would be tied up, so that Paterson would become a dead\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nMohl, who also made his appearance at the silk mills strike in Paterson,\r\ndeclared on May 18, 1913:\r\n\r\n     \"The American flag is pretty to look at. Its colors are\r\n     striking--red, white, and blue, with two or three twinkling stars\r\n     here and there, but it is not good to eat.\"\r\n\r\nThe I. W. W. is, of course, an atheistic and anti-religious\r\norganization. In the March 1, 1919, issue of \"The One Big Union\r\nMonthly,\" page 40, we read under the caption, \"Help Wanted, Male or\r\nFemale:\"\r\n\r\n     \"Priest or Minister to show the One Big Union family why our\r\n     Solidarity Dogma is not superior to the ethical teachings of Jesus,\r\n     Buddha or Mohammed, also to demonstrate the inside of the religious\r\n     business, and where it is interwoven with Wall street.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Call,\" New York, May 3, 1919, in an editorial on \"The Bomb Plot,\"\r\nwhich had just aroused the whole nation, said:\r\n\r\n     \"The bomb and torch have not the slightest relation to any branch\r\n     of the organized labor movement in this country, and the editors\r\n     know it. Those who print such unfounded and slanderous insinuations\r\n     place themselves in the same class as the would-be-assassin.\"\r\n\r\nThis editorial was published the day after the following special\r\ndispatch was sent to \"The New York Times:\"\r\n\r\n     \"Sioux City, Iowa, May 2.--'We will blow the whole town to hell if\r\n     you put Mayor Short out of office.' This was the threat on a\r\n     postcard addressed to E. J. Stanson, who is trying to secure the\r\n     recall of Mayor Short. The card was received today. It was signed\r\n     'I. W. W. Alliance for Short.' The police are rounding up all\r\n     suspicious characters, and those known to have a leaning toward the\r\n     Bolshevists of the I. W. W. Citizens are seeking to oust Short\r\n     because he welcomed delegates to a recent 'wobblies' convention\r\n     here.\"\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the spring of 1919 the author of \"The Red\r\nConspiracy\" obtained at the I. W. W. headquarters in Chicago a leaflet\r\nentitled, \"To Colored Workingmen and Women!\" Part of it is hereby\r\nquoted:\r\n\r\n     \"To the black race, who, but recently, with the assistance of the\r\n     white men of the northern states, broke their chains of bondage and\r\n     ended chattel slavery, a prospect of further freedom, of Real\r\n     Freedom, should be most appealing.\r\n\r\n     \"For it is a fact that the negro worker is no better off under the\r\n     freedom he has gained than the slavery from which he has escaped.\r\n     As chattel slaves we were the property of our masters, and as a\r\n     piece of valuable property our masters were considerate of us and\r\n     careful of our health and welfare. Today, as wage-workers, the boss\r\n     may work us to death at the hardest and most hazardous labor, at\r\n     the longest hours, at the lowest pay; we may quietly starve when\r\n     out of work and the boss loses nothing by it and has no interest in\r\n     us. To him the worker is but a machine for producing profits, and\r\n     when you, as a slave who sells himself to the master on the\r\n     installment plan, become old, or broken in health or strength or\r\n     should you be killed while at work, the master merely gets another\r\n     wage slave on the same terms.\r\n\r\n     \"We who have worked in the south know that conditions in lumber and\r\n     turpentine camps, in the fields of cane, cotton and tobacco, in the\r\n     mills and mines of Dixie, are such that the workers suffer a more\r\n     miserable existence than ever prevailed among the chattel slaves\r\n     before the great Civil War....\r\n\r\n     \"The only problem, then, which the colored worker should consider,\r\n     as a worker, is the problem of organizing with other workingmen in\r\n     the labor organization that best expresses the interest of the\r\n     whole working class against the slavery and oppression of the whole\r\n     capitalist class. Such an organization is the I. W. W., the\r\n     Industrial Workers of the World.\"\r\n\r\n\"The One Big Union Monthly,\" March 1, 1919, page 6, publishes an article\r\nentitled, \"The Chinese and the I. W. W.\":\r\n\r\n     \"The Chinese workers in this country have discovered the I. W.\r\n     W....\r\n\r\n     \"Long enough have workers been divided along colored lines. The\r\n     old, old misunderstanding created by our masters is fading away as\r\n     we mutually discover that we are all condemned to slavery if\r\n     divided, and that freedom is ours if we unite. The accessions of\r\n     Chinese workers to our ranks fills us with great joy. May they also\r\n     succeed in soon carrying the gospel of Working Class Solidarity and\r\n     Industrial Organization to their native country. That hope takes\r\n     the sadness out of the news of their possible deportation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I. W. W. Songs,\" a Red booklet published at the Chicago headquarters,\r\nhas already met with such popularity among the \"Wobblies\" that fourteen\r\neditions have been published. Several songs, showing the spirit of the\r\nReds, are given here:\r\n\r\n         The Preacher and the Slave\r\n                       By Joe Hill\r\n             (Tune: \"Sweet Bye and Bye\")\r\n\r\n    Long-haired preachers come out every night,\r\n    Try to tell you what's wrong and what's right;\r\n    But when asked how 'bout something to eat\r\n    They will answer with voices so sweet:\r\n\r\n              _Chorus_\r\n\r\n      You will eat, bye and bye,\r\n      In that glorious land above the sky;\r\n      Work and pray, live on hay,\r\n      You'll get pie in the sky when you die.\r\n\r\n    And the starvation army they play,\r\n    And they sing and they clap and they pray.\r\n    Till they get all your coin on the drum,\r\n    Then they'll tell you when you're on the bum:\r\n\r\n    Holy Rollers and jumpers come out,\r\n    And they holler, they jump and they shout.\r\n    \"Give your money to Jesus,\" they say,\r\n    \"He will cure all diseases to-day.\"\r\n\r\n    If you fight hard for children and wife--\r\n    Try to get something good in this life--\r\n    You're a sinner and bad man, they tell,\r\n    When you die you will sure go to hell.\r\n\r\n    Workingmen of all countries, unite,\r\n    Side by side we for freedom will fight;\r\n    When the world and its wealth we have gained\r\n    To the grafters we'll sing this refrain:\r\n\r\n             _Last Chorus_\r\n\r\n      You will eat, bye and bye,\r\n      When you've learned how to cook and to fry,\r\n      Chop some wood, 'twill do you good,\r\n      And you'll eat in the sweet bye and bye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Tie 'Em Up!\r\n\r\n               (Words and music by G.

F. of L.,\r\n    But we ask you use your reason with the facts we have to tell.\r\n    Your craft is but protection for a form of property,\r\n    The skill that you are losing, don't you see.\r\n    Improvements on machinery take your tool and skill away,\r\n    And you'll be among the common slaves upon some fateful day.\r\n    Now the things of which we're talking we are mighty sure about.--\r\n    So what's the use to strike the way you can't win out?\r\n\r\n              _Chorus_\r\n\r\n    Tie 'em up! Tie 'em up! That's the way to win.\r\n    Don't notify the bosses till hostilities begin.\r\n    Don't furnish chance for gunmen, scabs and all their like;\r\n    What you need is One Big Union and the One Big Strike.\r\n\r\n    Why do you make agreements that divide you when you fight\r\n    And let the bosses bluff you with the contract's \"sacred right?\"\r\n    Why stay at work when other crafts are battling with the foe,\r\n    You all must stick together, don't you know.\r\n    The day when you begin to see the classes waging war\r\n    You can join the biggest tie-up that was ever known before.\r\n    When the strikes all o'er the country are united into one,\r\n    Then the workers' One Big Union all the wheels shall run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Walking on the Grass\r\n\r\n                        (Tune: \"The Wearing of the Green\")\r\n\r\n    In this blessed land of freedom where King Mammon wears the crown,\r\n    There are many ways illegal now to hold the people down.\r\n    When the dudes of state militia are slow to come to time,\r\n    The law upholding Pinkertons are gathered from the slime.\r\n    There are wisely framed injunctions that you must not leave your job,\r\n    And a peaceable assemblage is declared to be a mob,\r\n    And Congress passed a measure framed by some consummate ass,\r\n    So they are clubbing men and women just for walking on the grass.\r\n\r\n    In this year of slow starvation, when a fellow looks for work,\r\n    The chances are a cop will grab his collar with a jerk;\r\n    He will run him in for vagrancy, he is branded as a tramp,\r\n    And all the well-to-do will shout: \"It serves him right, the scamp!\"\r\n    So we let the ruling class maintain the dignity of law,\r\n    When the court decides against us we are filled with wholesome awe,\r\n    But we cannot stand the outrage without a little sauce\r\n    When they're clubbing men and women just for walking on the grass.\r\n\r\n    The papers said the union men were all but anarchist,\r\n    So the job trust promised work for all who wouldn't enlist;\r\n    But the next day when the hungry horde surrounded city hall,\r\n    He hedged and said he didn't promise anything at all.\r\n    So the powers that be are acting very queer to say the least--\r\n    They should go and read their Bible and all about Belshazzar's feast,\r\n    And when mene tekel at length shall come to pass,\r\n    They'll stop clubbing men and women just for walking on the grass.\r\n\r\nAlthough the I. W. W. does not yet officially constitute a part of the\r\nSocialist organization, still very many of its members are most active\r\nSocialists. Indeed, it may be said that the I. W. W. is related to the\r\nSocialist Party quite as closely as a child is to its mother, for not\r\nonly does the I. W. W. owe its origin to the followers of Karl Marx,\r\nbut they are its directors and leaders, and have assisted and encouraged\r\nit in not a few of its principal strikes, notably at Lawrence, Mass.,\r\nand Paterson, N. J.\r\n\r\nThough we readily concede that quite a number of Socialists are\r\nindividually antagonistic to the I. W. W., still they are opposed to it\r\nnot because the I. W. W. differs in essential principles from the\r\nSocialist Party or even because this unfriendly minority of Socialists\r\nwould oppose violent methods, if such were considered expedient, but\r\nbecause the \"Yellow\" Socialists prefer political action which is made\r\nlight of by the I. W. W. direct actionists who are looked upon as\r\nenemies, for they seem to be doing harm to the Socialist political\r\npropaganda. In verification of this, an excellent proof is furnished by\r\nno less an authority than John Spargo, then a Socialist, and a most\r\nprolific writer, whose opposition to the Syndicalists and to the direct\r\nactionists of the Socialist Party was a well established fact even\r\nbefore the publication of his book, \"Syndicalism, Industrial Unionism\r\nand Socialism.\" On page 172 of this work he writes:\r\n\r\n     \"If the class to which I belong could be set free from exploitation\r\n     by violation of laws made by the master class, by open rebellion,\r\n     by seizing the property of the rich, by setting the torch to a few\r\n     buildings, or by the summary execution of a few members of the\r\n     possessing class, I hope that the courage to share in the work\r\n     would be mine.\"\r\n\r\nSpargo, in \"Syndicalism, Industrial Unionism and Socialism,\" admits that\r\nthe Socialists have continually and consistently given aid to the\r\nIndustrial Workers of the World in their strikes. Yet notwithstanding\r\nthis active support, many persons have been led to believe that the\r\nSocialists have repudiated the I. W. W. This incorrect opinion may be\r\ndue to the fact that the Socialist Party did not endorse the I. W. W. at\r\nits 1912 National Convention, or else to the fact that William D.\r\nHaywood was subsequently removed by a referendum from the National\r\nExecutive Committee of the Socialist Party. But the 1912 Indianapolis\r\nConvention of the Socialist Party did not repudiate the Industrial\r\nWorkers of the World. The representatives of the party only declared for\r\na neutrality between this organization and the American Federation of\r\nLabor, and would in all probability have endorsed the I. W. W. and\r\nrepudiated the American Federation of Labor if the Socialists had not\r\nnursed a hope of getting control of the latter organization and turning\r\nit into an industrial union similar to that of the Industrial Workers of\r\nthe World.\r\n\r\nThat the Socialist Party by no means repudiated the I. W. W., but on the\r\ncontrary was still on the most friendly terms with it after the 1912\r\nConvention, is evident from several facts. \"The Call,\" May 17, 1912,\r\naffirms that the Convention decided for neutrality in affairs of unions.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Appeal to Reason,\" May 25, 1912, we read: \"So after long weeks\r\nof discussion in the press, after days of apprehensions and fencing for\r\nadvantage, the labor organization committee brought forth a unanimous\r\nreport, which after a few speeches, all expressing the spirit of\r\nsolidarity, was adopted without a dissenting vote. It was a compromise\r\nresolution. Each side declares itself completely satisfied with it. Each\r\ndeclares that it expresses its sentiments.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam D. Haywood, who perhaps more than any other person had the\r\ninterests of the I. W. W. at heart, declared, according to \"The Call,\"\r\nMay 17, 1912, that with the adoption of this declaration concerning the\r\nneutrality of the party towards the two rival labor unions he felt that\r\nhe could go to the 8,000,000 workers of the nation and carry to them the\r\nmessage of Socialism. \"This,\" he continues, \"is the greatest step that\r\nhas yet been taken by the Socialist Party.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Haywood was for the time being removed from the National\r\nExecutive Committee of the party, charged with favoring direct action\r\nrather than political action, he was never expelled from the\r\nparty--which yet boasted so much of the constitutional clause adopted at\r\nthe 1912 National Convention demanding that any member who opposes\r\npolitical action, or advocates crime, sabotage, or other methods of\r\nviolence as a weapon of the working class, to aid in its emancipation,\r\nshall be expelled from membership in the party.\r\n\r\n\"The New Unionism,\" page 119, points out some of the \"merits\" of the I.\r\nW. W., in comparison made with the Socialist Party, against which it was\r\nsomewhat offended by the anti-sabotage and anti-direct action plank\r\nadopted at the 1912 National Convention:\r\n\r\n     \"There are vote-getters and politicians who waste their time coming\r\n     into a community where ninety per cent. of the men have no vote,\r\n     where the women are disfranchised 100 per cent., and where the boys\r\n     and girls under age, of course, are not enfranchised. Still they\r\n     will speak to these people about the power of the ballot, and they\r\n     never mention a thing about the power of the general strike. They\r\n     seem to lack the foresight, the penetration to interpret political\r\n     power. They seem to lack the understanding that the broadest\r\n     interpretation of political power comes through the industrial\r\n     organization; that the industrial organization is capable not only\r\n     of the general strike, but prevents the capitalists from\r\n     disfranchising the worker; it gives the vote to women, it\r\n     re-enfranchises the black man and places the ballot in the hands of\r\n     every boy and girl employed in a shop, makes them eligible to take\r\n     part in the general strike, makes them eligible to legislate for\r\n     themselves where they are most interested in changing conditions,\r\n     namely, in the place where they work.\"\r\n\r\nAgain we read, on page 122 of \"The New Unionism\":\r\n\r\n     \"The politicians in the Socialist Party, who want offices in the\r\n     government, fight the I. W. W. because we have no place in our\r\n     ranks for them, and if our idea prevails, it will crowd them out\r\n     and destroy their influence as 'saviors of the working class.'\r\n     These politicians cater for votes to the middle class--to business\r\n     men, farm owners and other small labor skinners--while the I. W. W.\r\n     appeals only to wage-workers, and allows none but actual\r\n     wage-workers to join our ranks. The Socialists can never get a\r\n     majority of votes for a working class programme (if they had such a\r\n     programme) because the majority of voters are middle class, since\r\n     about ten million male wage-workers are disfranchised (being\r\n     foreigners or floaters without long enough residence in one place\r\n     to have votes). But the wage-workers are a big majority of the\r\n     whole people, and produce nearly all wealth, so when they organize\r\n     as the I. W. W. proposes, the working class will control the\r\n     country, and with similar organizations in other countries will\r\n     control the world. Foreigners, women, children and other non-voters\r\n     at elections, have equal rights in the union, and take part in its\r\n     activities, regardless of nationality, age, sex, or any other\r\n     consideration except that they are wage-workers with common\r\n     interests in opposition to those of the employers.\"\r\n\r\nIt may come as a surprise to the reader to hear that at the 1917 St.\r\nLouis Convention of the Socialist Party the anti-sabotage and\r\nanti-direct action plank of the Constitution was dropped. The\r\n\"International Socialist Review,\" May, 1917, page 669, commenting on the\r\nremoval of the clause, says:\r\n\r\n     \"It has served its purpose, which was to guillotine and drive out\r\n     most of the revolutionary workers from the party. The Constitution\r\n     committee recommended that it be striken out by unanimous consent\r\n     without going on the minutes or records. Ruthenberg opposed. He\r\n     insisted that it be struck out and the minutes show the record of\r\n     the action. It was carried almost unanimously.\"\r\n\r\nFurther on we read in the same issue of \"The International Socialist\r\nReview\":\r\n\r\n\"An industrial union plank to be inserted in the platform was defeated\r\nby a vote of 63 to 61. Had it been offered as a resolution it would have\r\ngone through by a big majority.\" Though most of the Convention favored\r\nthe I. W. W., evidently a small majority feared to put the Socialist\r\nParty on record.\r\n\r\nIn 1918 and 1919 the Socialist Party grew more and more friendly to the\r\nI. W. W. At present they seem to have fallen in love with each other.\r\nThe American Federation of Labor is held in greatest contempt by the\r\nSocialist press, while the I. W. W. is lauded to the skies. Its meetings\r\nare advertised, sympathy and aid are extended to its imprisoned\r\nofficials and everything is being done to help it along.\r\n\r\nEugene V. Debs has all along been the sincere friend of the I. W. W. In\r\nthe February, 1918, issue of the \"International Socialist Review,\" page\r\n395, he says:\r\n\r\n     \"Every plutocrat, every profiteering pirate, every food vulture,\r\n     every exploiter of labor, every robber and oppressor of the poor,\r\n     every hog under a silk tile, every vampire in human form will tell\r\n     you that the A. F. of L. under Gompers is a great and patriotic\r\n     organization and that the I. W. W. under Haywood is a gang of\r\n     traitors in the pay of the bloody Kaiser.\r\n\r\n     \"Which of these, think you, Mr. Wage-Slave, is your friend and the\r\n     friend of your class?....\r\n\r\n     \"The war within the war and beyond the war in which the I. W. W. is\r\n     fighting--the war of the workers of all countries against the\r\n     exploiters of all countries--is our war, the war of humanity\r\n     against its oppressors and despoilers, the holiest war ever waged\r\n     since the race began.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Call,\" New York, April 19, 1919, published at the top of its\r\neditorial page, \"Debs' Daily Message from Moundsville Prison:\"\r\n\r\n     \"Though Jailed, He Speaketh.\r\n\r\n     \"The clear voice of the awakened and dauntless few cannot be\r\n     silenced. The new unionism is being heard. In trumpet tones it\r\n     rings out its revolutionary shibboleth to all the workers of the\r\n     earth: 'Our interests are identical--let us combine industrially\r\n     and politically, assert our united power, achieve our freedom,\r\n     enjoy the fruit of our labor, rid society of parasitism, abolish\r\n     poverty and civilize the world!'....\r\n\r\n     \"There can be no peace until the working class is triumphant in\r\n     this struggle and the wage system is forever wiped from the earth.\"\r\n\r\nIn the May Day issue of \"The Call,\" May 1, 1919, there is a very long\r\narticle on Debs' Imprisonment by David Karsner, staff correspondent. He\r\ntells us that on the afternoon of April 28 he sat talking with Debs in\r\nhis little room in the prison hospital at Moundsville, West Virginia,\r\nand that the many-times presidential candidate of the Socialist Party\r\namong other things said, when told of an intended visit by Karsner to\r\nthe Leavenworth Federal prison to see William D. Haywood and the other\r\n93 I. W. W. prisoners:\r\n\r\n     \"I want you to take my love to Bill Haywood and all the other boys\r\n     you see out there. We all stand shoulder to shoulder together.\"\r\n\r\nThe staff correspondent then goes on to say:\r\n\r\n     \"The reference of Debs to Haywood and the I. W. W. brought vividly\r\n     to my mind the little scene enacted between 'Gene' and 'Big Bill'\r\n     in the corridor of Judge Landis' courtroom in Chicago last August\r\n     during the I. W. W. trial.\r\n\r\n     \"'You and the boys are making a great and noble fight,' said Debs\r\n     to Haywood at that time, patting the cheek of Big Bill. 'You are a\r\n     born champion of the underdog.' Haywood clasped Debs' in his own\r\n     great palm and said affectionately, 'You are the champion of the\r\n     underdog, Gene, and you always will be.' There was something\r\n     thrilling and inspiring in witnessing this friendly and comradely\r\n     felicitation between two noble men, both of whom have never\r\n     retreated one jot from their ideas of emancipation of the working\r\n     class.\r\n\r\n     \"I recalled as I saw him this afternoon that seven years ago, or at\r\n     the time of the Indianapolis Convention of the Socialist party,\r\n     Debs pleaded for unity of the movement. He refused to be stampeded\r\n     into any position that would compromise the noble work that\r\n     confronted himself and the Socialist Party. Debs has always been\r\n     for industrial unionism. His speeches and writings are filled with\r\n     the spirit of organization and solidarity on the industrial field\r\n     as well as on the political. But above everything else he has\r\n     warned his fellow Socialists and industrialists that the thing to\r\n     do is to keep united, to solidify their economic and political\r\n     strength to the end that when our day comes we shall be ready to\r\n     enjoy the fruits of our victory.\"\r\n\r\n\"The One Big Union Monthly,\" March 1, 1919, pages 14, 19 and 21, gives\r\nus some very interesting information about the I. W. W. attitude toward\r\nBolshevism and the two extreme groups of the Socialists:\r\n\r\n     \"We have long predicted the revolutionary cyclone that is now\r\n     sweeping over the world, even though few people cared to believe\r\n     us. We asked them to prepare for it by building up the framework of\r\n     the new society within the shell of the old, in other words to see\r\n     to it that we had the new house ready to move into, before we\r\n     dynamited the old one....\r\n\r\n     \"Personally we are convinced that Russia will never again return to\r\n     the old order. The workers have control and they will not let go of\r\n     it. As the days go by, they will gradually organize production and\r\n     distribution on the lines of industrial unionism, as Lenine assures\r\n     us, and that will be their salvation.\r\n\r\n     \"The plight of the Russian people is a warning to other peoples to\r\n     immediately start building the new society, by building industrial\r\n     unions right now, before the structure of the old society topples\r\n     over. Industrial unions are the only social apparatus that will\r\n     make abolishment of wage slavery possible....\r\n\r\n     \"The Bolshevik Revolution has emphasized this sad fact. Socialism\r\n     in Russia, facing for the first time in Socialist history, the\r\n     problem of inaugurating a working class state, found itself\r\n     paralyzed by the existence of a parliamentary form of Democracy.\r\n     The Revolution was at stake. In order to destroy capitalism it was\r\n     necessary to destroy parliamentary Democracy, and Lenine destroyed\r\n     it. In its place he reared a new form of Democracy--the\r\n     Dictatorship of the Proletariat, which is Socialism.\r\n\r\n     \"And yet, so misled is the thinking of our European Socialists that\r\n     in the very presence of a living, accomplished Socialist\r\n     commonwealth, they hastened to repudiate it because it was not\r\n     'Democratic.' Plekhanov betrayed it. Kautsky reviled it. Albert\r\n     Thomas called upon the capitalists of France to send their soldiers\r\n     there and crush it. Mr. Walling, Mr. Spargo and Mr. Russell\r\n     baptized themselves into a 'Socialist' crusade to destroy\r\n     Socialism. Could idiocy be more abject?\r\n\r\n     \"The alternative is presented, to choose between Socialism or\r\n     Democracy. Or perhaps it would be better to put it--between\r\n     industrial Democracy and parliamentary Democracy. And our pitiable\r\n     Spargos, duped by a stale phrase, abandon their Socialism because\r\n     it is not 'Democratic.'\r\n\r\n     \"In America, it is this same issue of Democracy which has long been\r\n     the dividing line between the Socialist Party and the I. W. W. Like\r\n     the Bolshevists of Russia, the I. W. W. have championed Democracy\r\n     but we have refused to allow the capitalist thinkers to define it\r\n     for us. We have practiced Democracy in our organization and we have\r\n     sublimated it into the most perfect of Democratic organizations.\r\n     But always, it has been a Democracy only of proletarians. We have\r\n     built the framework of a new society which says that those shall\r\n     not vote who do not work. And this, indeed, is Socialism.\r\n\r\n     \"But the political Socialists have feared to draw this distinction.\r\n     They have not built themselves upon the proletarian rock. Into\r\n     their ranks they have admitted, not only the butcher, the baker and\r\n     the candle-stick maker, but also the lawyer, the doctor, the\r\n     merchant, the sky pilot, yes, and even the capitalists--known as\r\n     millionaire Socialists. Out of such a medley, a medley philosophy\r\n     was sprouted. Democracy, to the political Socialists, could not be\r\n     rigidly proletarian, because the political Socialists, themselves,\r\n     were not proletarians. And their ideals paled into evasion and\r\n     compromise.\r\n\r\n     \"Again, the I. W. W. being proletarian, spurned a parliamentary\r\n     action which would have drawn it together with the exploiting\r\n     class. It realized, before Spargo took that fatal dodge, that, from\r\n     parliamentary Socialism to parliamentary Democracy it was but a\r\n     step. Hence we spurned politics and parliamentarism, and\r\n     substituted a Democracy, grouped around unions, and not around\r\n     parliaments.\r\n\r\n     \"But the political Socialists, immersed in parliamentary hack work,\r\n     stifled the Socialist concept of Democracy by recognizing and\r\n     participating in the capitalist form of Democracy. Entering the\r\n     parliaments, they dreamed that they could transform these\r\n     parliaments into Socialist republics. Only too soon they discovered\r\n     that the parliaments had transformed them into 'Democratic'\r\n     apologists. Like a poisoning strain, parliamentarism spread out\r\n     over Socialism. And so, when Socialism came at last in Russia,\r\n     without the aid of the foolish parliaments, deluded Socialists\r\n     cried that Bolshevism was not Socialism.\"\r\n\r\nThe year 1919 witnessed a very marked drawing together, in the United\r\nStates and throughout the world, of I. W. W.'ism, or Syndicalism, and\r\nall the bodies of radical, revolutionary Socialism. The Moscow\r\nBolshevists gave a great \"boost\" to the I. W. W. principle of industrial\r\nunionism by endorsing it and declaring that Russia was being\r\nreorganized economically along similar lines. Bolshevism in Russia, in\r\nfact, has had the help and counsel of I. W. W. experts from the United\r\nStates, and I. W. W. leaders in America have naturally been elated. John\r\nSandgren wrote in \"The New Solidarity,\" April 12, 1919:\r\n\r\n     \"The immortal gains of Bolshevism for humanity lie on the political\r\n     field. When it comes to economic reconstruction, the Bolsheviks are\r\n     going to find that it cannot be made from the top through laws and\r\n     regulations. Any attempt to make the people the real owners of the\r\n     means of production and distribution must start with the industrial\r\n     organization of the workers themselves as outlined in the I. W. W.\r\n     program. In the meantime, let us hope that Bolshevism will sweep\r\n     victoriously over all such parts of the world where it still has a\r\n     mission to perform. After that, begins the I. W. W. period in human\r\n     history.\"\r\n\r\nThe April 1, 1919, issue of \"The One Big Union Monthly,\" published the\r\nRussian Communist Party call and invitation to the Moscow Conference\r\n[see Chapter III for a copy of this document], remarking that \"as to the\r\ngeneral demand for the overthrow of Capitalism, the dis-establishment of\r\nprivate ownership and making the working-class the rulers of the world,\r\nthere is apt to be little if any dissension.\" However, noting that \"the\r\nI. W. W. of this and other countries\" had been invited to the\r\nconference, it declared that \"we have no reason to get excited over the\r\ninvitation,\" since, \"with the exception of the I. W. W., there is hardly\r\nany of the thirty-nine invited bodies who seriously endorse industrial\r\nunionism as the basis of a new society.... The proposed communist\r\nconference would consequently be a congress of radical political\r\nSocialists to consider the question of discontinuing the use of the\r\nballot and adopting the methods used by the Russian communists in the\r\npast in overthrowing capitalist society.\" The I. W. W. world-scheme is\r\nthen outlined:\r\n\r\n     \"The I. W. W. has given up all thought of using the machinery of\r\n     the present state for its purposes. It proposes to create an\r\n     entirely new machinery of administration in which not even a\r\n     particle of the old shall enter as a constituent part. We propose\r\n     to re-group all mankind on industrial lines in industrial\r\n     organizations which we hope will make superfluous and crowd out the\r\n     political groupings which constitute the state. We propose to make\r\n     the unit of industry, the place of work, the shop, the mill, the\r\n     field, the ship, the basis of our new social organization. These\r\n     units will combine in two different manners. From a purely\r\n     industrial standpoint, they will unite with other units into large\r\n     industrial unions, calculated to embrace the whole world, each and\r\n     every one of them. For the purpose of local administration, we\r\n     propose that the local industrial units shall form a district\r\n     industrial council or local administrative body to take care of\r\n     local affairs. As we propose to order all branches of human\r\n     activity along these lines and include them in a world scheme of\r\n     industrial co-operation, we must conclude that our program,\r\n     although fundamentally aiming at the same thing as the program of\r\n     the Communist Party, somewhat differs from the program proposed as\r\n     a basis of unity.\"\r\n\r\nAn editorial in the same issue on \"Soviet Government in the U. S.\" says:\r\n\r\n     \"The papers have informed us that the police and the secret service\r\n     have unearthed a gigantic plot among the Socialists of this country\r\n     to gather up all the radical elements with a view to establishing a\r\n     Soviet government in this country.... We do not deny that this\r\n     agitation is useful, for it stirs people to thought and excites\r\n     contradiction, ... but when that is said, we have said all the good\r\n     we can about it....\r\n\r\n     \"The Russians made their revolution not because they had Soviets,\r\n     but because the people willed it.... The I. W. W. has at least on\r\n     paper an institution corresponding to the Soviet, namely, the\r\n     District Industrial Council, ... a local representative body of the\r\n     various industrial unions in each locality. So far, it lacks all\r\n     practical significance because we are not numerous enough, but\r\n     whenever there is to be a radical change in this country, the\r\n     change will have to be made through these councils locally. They\r\n     will take over the functions which were taken over by the Soviets\r\n     in Russia.\"\r\n\r\nAnother editorial in the same issue treats of the overtures of the Left\r\nWing Socialists:\r\n\r\n     \"Of late we have noticed an ever-increasing tendency to hush us up\r\n     in the name of unity. We are being told not to show up political\r\n     Socialism; we are told not to attack Anarchism. We are asked to be\r\n     more lenient toward the A. F. of L. [American Federation of Labor.]\r\n     We mustn't touch on church and religion....\r\n\r\n     \"It appears that political Socialists, anarchists and other labor\r\n     elements feel that the bottom has fallen out of their programs and\r\n     they want us to keep quiet about it, and as a reward we will secure\r\n     their friendly services. The I. W. W. is not willing to enter into\r\n     any such bargain.\"\r\n\r\nAnother editorial gives further light on the \"boring in\" process begun\r\nby theoretical Socialists with an itch for revolution--paper soldiers\r\nanxious to get a-straddle of the great strike-conducting war-horse of I.\r\nW. W.'ism and ride into \"the dictatorship of the proletariat.\" This is\r\nthus dealt with:\r\n\r\n     \"There is a large element in this country who want a radical change\r\n     if not a revolution. This element would like to see the change made\r\n     to suit them with the smallest possible cost to themselves.\r\n\r\n     \"The most insistent agitators belong to the upper-class radicals,\r\n     and their object seems to be to stir the working masses into some\r\n     sort of revolutionary activity, not clearly defined. It seems they\r\n     built great hopes on the participation of the I. W. W. They know we\r\n     are a compact mass of industrial workers, able to manipulate such\r\n     great affairs as the general strikes in Seattle and Butte, the\r\n     strike of the silk workers, the strike on the Mesaba Range, and so\r\n     on, and we are just what they need for their purpose.\r\n\r\n     \"For this reason we have met with an unusual amount of courtesy and\r\n     consideration of late, but we are sorry to say that we do not\r\n     consider it disinterested. If these revolutionists were sincere in\r\n     their friendship for us, they would throw everything aside and help\r\n     us build up industrial unionism, but that is exactly what they are\r\n     not doing to any considerable extent. Their activities are directed\r\n     on aims that are strange and foreign to us. Some of their adherents\r\n     in overalls are getting into our ranks because they work in the\r\n     industries we have organized or because our recruiting unions are\r\n     open to them, and their activity is frequently annoying to us, as\r\n     it has little or nothing to do with the industrial organization of\r\n     the workers.\"\r\n\r\nThe same issue contains an article by a Left Winger, I. E. Ferguson, a\r\n\"Little Corporal\" ready to step to the front of I. W. W.'ism and lead it\r\nto glory. He complains:\r\n\r\n     \"The attempt to 'hog the market' of propagandizing the Russian\r\n     Revolution in the United States for the I. W. W. is leading to\r\n     excesses which ought to be checked right now, else these excesses\r\n     will accomplish injury to the American Socialist movement. This\r\n     does not mean to repudiate the claims of the I. W. W. to any\r\n     extent, but to controvert the negative proposition that all of the\r\n     American revolutionary socialist movement is and necessarily must\r\n     be within the folds of the I. W. W....\r\n\r\n     \"The I. W. W. is the livest thing in the American Socialist\r\n     movement, therefore, truly, the Greatest Thing On Earth for the\r\n     American working class. But ... when the same organization carries\r\n     on the business of unionism and the business of revolution at the\r\n     same time, it is more than likely, when it becomes overburdened, to\r\n     throw overboard the more remote job in favor of the more immediate\r\n     one. Revolution is a political proposition, or, if you please,\r\n     anti-political. Its direct task is the overthrow of the capitalist\r\n     state, the bulwark of capitalist industrialism. There is no\r\n     question in the world but that the I. W. W. form of labor\r\n     organization is the most powerful possible weapon for the overthrow\r\n     of the capitalist state, because of its adaptability to great mass\r\n     protests and mass movements of the proletariat. But only an\r\n     organization with the sole aim of revolution can take the\r\n     responsibility for leadership in this fight.\"\r\n\r\nGranting some truth in the above argument, it is not probable that a\r\ngreat practical organization like the I. W. W., which _does_ things, and\r\nvery rough things, will invite theorists, non-working drones, to come in\r\nand take charge of it. Nor is it willing to be borrowed, and diverted\r\ninto an engine to run toy revolutions. This is the substance of the\r\nreply to Ferguson made by Harold Lord Varney in the same magazine. We\r\nquote its pith:\r\n\r\n     \"Like the Left Wingers of the Socialist Party; like the editors and\r\n     the writers of the Revolutionary Age and the Class Struggle; like\r\n     the Eastmans, the Nearings and the Frainas of our American\r\n     movement, my critic is obsessed with Russia. To him, the\r\n     Bolshevists and their mass action revolutions are like dazzling,\r\n     fiery suns which blind and obscure all rivals....\r\n\r\n     \"As proletarians, I. W. W.'s rejoiced at the Lenine triumph. As\r\n     proletarians, we have unwaveringly supported the Bolshevist regime\r\n     in all our propaganda. Those of our members who happened to be in\r\n     Russia when the October Revolution came (and there were thousands\r\n     of them) were all found in the Bolshevist army. Bill Shatoff,\r\n     Volodarsky, Martoff, Kornuk and others who have been leaders in the\r\n     Bolshevist army were all old members of the I. W. W. In brief,\r\n     then, were we in Russia, all I. W. W.'s would be Bolsheviki. But\r\n     from this it does not necessarily follow that in America the I. W.\r\n     W. must turn Bolshevist also....\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Ferguson's proposition is that after all these years of\r\n     struggle we should now discard this One Big Union goal and unite\r\n     with political Socialists to create an American Bolsheviki. And in\r\n     that proposal he demonstrates the impractical artlessness of the\r\n     Left Winger. The I. W. W. is a Socialist who is a materialist. The\r\n     Left Winger is a Socialist who is an ideologist. The I. W. W. seeks\r\n     for verities and for concrete, ponderable power. The Left Winger\r\n     follows the intoxicating dreams of his own imagination....\r\n\r\n     \"Of course, the I. W. W. wants unity. But we will have no unity\r\n     with any who are not willing to accept the proletarian conception\r\n     of Socialism. We will have no unity with any who do not belong to\r\n     our class. And we will have no unity with any who flinch at the\r\n     'radicalism' of our program....\r\n\r\n     \"The I. W. W. is not anti-political. Its members are free to be\r\n     members of the Socialist Party and thousands of us, the writer\r\n     included, do carry Socialist cards....\r\n\r\n     \"The social revolution is not a thing of theories. It is merely the\r\n     final act of working-class organization. It is the historic mission\r\n     of the working class to mount to supreme power. They do this, not\r\n     by debating nor by marching in the street; they do this by the slow\r\n     process of organization. In their union halls, the workers learn\r\n     class consciousness. In their union halls, the workers learn\r\n     self-government. In their union halls, the workers are disciplined\r\n     and solidified for the 'final conflict.' Every strike is a\r\n     revolution in miniature. Every gain which organized workers make,\r\n     by a conscious act of their own, weakens capitalism and is\r\n     revolutionary. In short, the union movement is the schoolhouse of\r\n     the new society....\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Ferguson is not correct in asserting that the I. W. W. does\r\n     not have 'the sole aim of revolution.' In our Preamble, he will\r\n     find the boldest revolutionary utterance which has ever been\r\n     penned.... Even were we silent in revolutionary words, our very\r\n     form of organization and mode of action stamp us as revolutionists.\r\n     We are organized against capital. We are an army that is ever\r\n     battling....\r\n\r\n     \"The real I. W. W. is not to be read in books of the intellectuals.\r\n     It does not flash in phrases. It is written in the hearts of strong\r\n     silent men. It can be read in the ineffable tales of anguish which\r\n     ring from the prisons of the land. It can be read in the tragic\r\n     sacrifices of the Littles, the Joe Hills, the Barans, the Looneys,\r\n     the Jonsons, the Rabinowitzes, the Gerlots, the Jack Whytes whom\r\n     destiny has claimed from among us. Its chapters have been penned,\r\n     not with words, but with the living dramas of Spokane and San\r\n     Diego, Lawrence and Paterson, McKee's Rocks, Everett and Mesaba\r\n     Range.\"\r\n\r\nThis is indeed the spirit of the most dangerous organization of devoted\r\nfanatics in the world today, and if our present order of society hopes\r\nto survive its steady, unrelenting assault, it must take into its hands\r\nthe weapons of truth and justice.\r\n\r\nWe have given these quotations to show clearly both the difference and\r\nthe bond of union between the I. W. W.'s and the other brands of\r\nSocialists. A Left Winger sums it up concisely (\"The Communist,\" August\r\n23, 1919): \"The syndicalist and the Socialist have this in common: That\r\nthey both strive for the reduction of the state to zero and the\r\n'building of a new society within the shell of the old.' The fundamental\r\ndifference between the two is that the syndicalist naively strives to\r\nbuild the new society while the capitalist class controls the coercive\r\npower, and the Socialist aims to destroy that power first and then begin\r\nthe 'building' process.\"\r\n\r\nBut I. W. W.'ism is the more logical, and, in conditions like those in\r\nthe United States, much the more dangerous, because it is _revolution\r\ngoing on_ every day of the year, holding what it gets, be it much or\r\nlittle. Moreover, since I. W. W.'ism will not give up its position,\r\nSocialism in America has adopted the industrial unionism creed. This now\r\nis the backbone of all the recent Socialist platforms, including that of\r\nthe Socialist Party of America. Even with the Left Winger's buoyant\r\nfaith in a speedy overturn of the United States, he now sees that the\r\nOne Big Union is the necessary steam-roller to accomplish it, and for\r\nmonths he has been at work, \"boring from within,\" to get the forces of\r\nAmerican labor industrially organized for revolutionary action. In\r\nshort, there has been a general following of the advice which \"Truth,\"\r\nLeft Wing organ in the Northwest, gave in its issue of May 23, 1919, as\r\nits answer to the above-quoted challenge of Varney to Ferguson:\r\n\r\n     \"The Left Wing represents the revolutionary portion of the\r\n     Socialist Party in opposition to the opportunism of the Right Wing.\r\n     Therefore we must, in order to make the Socialist Party a\r\n     revolutionary expression of the working class, join hands with the\r\n     Left Wing....\r\n\r\n     \"The I. W. W. represents the revolutionary section of the working\r\n     class in opposition to the opportunism of Gompers et al. Therefore\r\n     we must, in order to make working class organizations\r\n     revolutionary, join hands with the I. W. W.\r\n\r\n     \"The resolutions and the manifestoes of the Left Wing are\r\n     revolutionary expressions. But action counts for more than words.\r\n     If all Left Wingers are sincere they will join in the I. W. W. and\r\n     endeavor to make the I. W. W. the dominant working-class\r\n     organization throughout the country. The times demand that we must\r\n     make ready to enforce our demands. No pious resolutions will bring\r\n     us freedom. Only POWER through organization on the job will bring\r\n     us freedom. True it is that we have to resort to mass action. But\r\n     the basis of our mass action must be organization on the job. The\r\n     I. W. W. represents the highest form of industrial organization and\r\n     therefore merits our support. So we trust that ALL Left Wingers\r\n     will join with the I. W. W. This is not the time to indulge in\r\n     hair-splitting. If you are enraptured by what has taken place in\r\n     Russia, do your share here in America.\"\r\n\r\nThis appeared in May, 1919. Six months later we open the December, 1919,\r\n\"One Big Union Monthly\" and read:\r\n\r\n     \"We need hardly repeat the now well known facts that the workers of\r\n     western Canada and of Australia have in mass adopted our principles\r\n     in the course of this year. Close upon these significant events\r\n     came the news that the three fragments into which the Socialist\r\n     Party was split endorsed industrial unionism, while two of them\r\n     rather outspokenly favored the I. W. W.\r\n\r\n     \"Later we were able to state that the increase in our own\r\n     membership in the course of the 12 months, September 1, 1918, to\r\n     September 1, 1919, was about 50,000. Now we are able to inform our\r\n     readers that the growth of the last three months has been\r\n     unprecedented. Lumber workers, miners, construction workers, marine\r\n     transport workers and many other unions report many thousands of\r\n     new members. We are getting a footing in fields that we have never\r\n     been able to touch before, such as the printing industry and\r\n     building construction. Carpenters and painters are joining us by\r\n     the thousand. On November 9th delegates of eight independent unions\r\n     in different industries, representing something like 250,000\r\n     workers, met in New York City and took the first steps for an\r\n     affiliation with the I. W. W.--in spite of jails and persecution.\r\n     And let us not forget that the Negro workers of the U. S. are\r\n     organizing on the basis of our program.\r\n\r\n     \"But the influence of our principles is not limited to the\r\n     English-speaking people in America and Australia. Other races and\r\n     countries are enthusiastically taking up our program and proudly\r\n     announcing that they are with the I. W. W. Thus in Mexico our\r\n     movement has taken form and been laid out on a national basis. In\r\n     South America, where the labor movement always has been in\r\n     sympathy with us, the workers are going one step further and have\r\n     started organizing as an I. W. W. In Buenos Ayres there is already\r\n     an organization of 2,800 marine transport workers in such an\r\n     organization.\r\n\r\n     \"Furthermore it is to be noted that practically all the old trade\r\n     unions on this continent prove to be honey-combed with friends of\r\n     the I. W. W.\r\n\r\n     \"Over in Europe it is the same story. The rebuilding of production\r\n     and distribution in Russia is said to be largely based on our\r\n     principles. At last report there were about 3,500,000 industrial\r\n     workers organized in industrial unions for the carrying on of\r\n     production and distribution. The Russian people are taking\r\n     possession of the industries through their industrial unions.\r\n\r\n     \"In Italy 'The Italian Syndicalist Union,' 300,000 strong, is\r\n     forging ahead along the same lines as the I. W. W. In Spain our\r\n     adherents are to be numbered by the hundreds of thousands. In\r\n     France the proposition has recently been made in the organ of the\r\n     Communist Party, 'L'Internationale Communiste,' to start\r\n     reorganizing the French working class on our program, in opposition\r\n     to the C. G. T. [Confédération Générale du Travail, or French\r\n     Confederation of Labor]. In England there is a separate\r\n     organization of the I. W. W. that is advancing rapidly, while the\r\n     influence on the old trade unions is very noticeable in their\r\n     changed attitude of late toward 'direct action.' ...\r\n\r\n     \"But the biggest surprise of the year we received from Germany. At\r\n     least two separate calls have been issued by the German workers to\r\n     organize exactly as the I. W. W. The recently formed 'Freie\r\n     Arbeiter Union' is also a federation of industrial unions that\r\n     endorse our principles. And, finally, from distant, unknown Greece\r\n     we are receiving news that the One Big Union is the aim of all the\r\n     organized workers of that country.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral very important facts have been proven in this and the preceding\r\nchapter: first, that the Industrial Workers of the World is a\r\nrevolutionary organization in the strictest sense and has for its object\r\nthe overthrow of the United States Government; secondly, that, like the\r\nSocialist Party, it is constantly seeking to stir up trouble whenever it\r\ncan do so; thirdly, that it respects neither morality nor the law and\r\nappeals to the basest passions in man; and, finally, that all sections\r\nof the Socialist Party are on the strictest terms of friendship with it\r\nand are giving it full support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nBOLSHEVIST RULE IN RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after the Lenine-Trotzky government came into power in Russia,\r\nin the latter part of the year 1917, Bolshevism became very popular in\r\nAmerica among the radicals, especially the Socialists. Among those who\r\nhelped most to bring it into such high esteem was Albert Rhys Williams,\r\nwho had spent but one year of his life in Russia, hardly spoke the\r\nRussian language, and while staying in that country was in the pay of\r\nthe Bolsheviki, as he testified before the Senate Committee.\r\n\r\nThe Bolsheviki came into power by violence and have sustained themselves\r\nin power by violence and terrorism. Their main support, the so-called\r\nRed Army, in which the Chinese and Letts have played a prominent part,\r\nis an army of mercenaries who are well paid and well fed, while\r\nthousands of civilians are dying from starvation in the cities and towns\r\nof Russia.\r\n\r\nThe first success of the Bolsheviki was the dissolution by bayonets of\r\nthe Constituent Assembly, which for forty years had been the goal of all\r\nRussians--even of the Bolsheviki up to the time when they found it\r\noverwhelmingly against them. Then they invented a new double name for\r\ntheir anti-democratic government: Soviets, or dictatorship of the\r\nproletariat. Next they dissolved all the democratic Municipal Councils\r\nand Zemstvos and proceeded to take away the various liberties won in the\r\nrevolution against the regime of the Czar.\r\n\r\nThe dictatorship of the proletariat led rapidly to an almost complete\r\nstoppage of industry. Governmental expenditures increased by leaps and\r\nbounds with the growing pauperization of the people; for the growing\r\nstaffs of Bolshevist officials were utterly incompetent, a large army of\r\nmercenaries was required in order to keep down the ever-increasing\r\nnumber of insurrections and the ceaseless attacks from many foreign\r\nfoes, enormous subsidies had to be paid to Bolshevist workingmen,\r\nregardless of the fact that the factories were producing sometimes\r\nlittle and sometimes nothing, and, finally, the Lenine government spent\r\ngreat sums in revolutionary propaganda in the different countries of\r\nthe world. Political and economic slavery, moral corruption and the\r\nstarvation of millions of people, are a few of the \"blessings\" bestowed\r\nupon Russia by Bolshevism.\r\n\r\nCatherine Breshkovsky, the \"Grandmother of the Russian Revolution,\"\r\nherself a Socialist, speaking of the Bolsheviki, said:\r\n\r\n     \"In addition to the crimes in their foreign policy, which\r\n     culminated in the treacherous Brest-Litovsk 'peace' with German\r\n     militarists, the Bolsheviki have committed innumerable crimes in\r\n     their internal policy. They have destroyed all civil liberties in\r\n     Russia: freedom of speech, of the press, of assemblage and of\r\n     organization; they have filled prisons through the country with\r\n     their political adversaries, proclaiming 'enemies of the people'\r\n     not only the Liberals, the Constitutional-Democratic Party, but\r\n     also the party of the Socialists-Revolutionists and the\r\n     Social-Democrats Mensheviki, that is, the parties of the Russian\r\n     peasantry and proletariat. They have instituted a system of terror\r\n     unequaled in cruelty, and while hundreds of innocent hostages would\r\n     pay with their lives for the assassination or for the attempt to\r\n     assassinate a Bolshevist commissaire, they did not punish the Red\r\n     Guards who assassinated the two Ministers of the Provisional\r\n     Government, Kokoshkin and Shingariev, while the latter were under\r\n     Bolshevist arrest, lying sick in a hospital.\"\r\n\r\nThe January, 1919, issue of \"The Eye Opener,\" the official organ of the\r\nNational Office, Socialist Party, publishes the full text of the Russian\r\nBolshevist Constitution under the caption, \"Here's Constitution of\r\nWorld's First Socialist Republic.\" Some quotations from the document\r\nwill no doubt prove interesting as well as instructive:\r\n\r\n     \"For the purpose of realizing the socialization of land, all\r\n     private property in land is abolished, and the entire land is\r\n     declared to be national property and is to be apportioned among\r\n     husbandmen without any compensation to the former owners, in the\r\n     measure of each one's ability to till it.\r\n\r\n     \"All forests, treasures of the earth, and waters of general public\r\n     utility, all implements whether animate or inanimate, model farms\r\n     and agricultural enterprises are declared to be national property.\r\n\r\n     \"As a first step toward complete transfer of ownership to the\r\n     Soviet Republic of all factories, mills, mines, railways and other\r\n     means of production or transportation, the Soviet law, for the\r\n     control by workmen and the establishment of the Supreme Soviet of\r\n     National Economy is hereby confirmed, so as to assure the power of\r\n     the workers over their exploiters....\r\n\r\n     \"Universal obligation to work is introduced for the purpose of\r\n     eliminating the parasitic strata of society and organizing the\r\n     economic life of the country.\r\n\r\n     \"For the purpose of securing the working class in the possession of\r\n     the complete power, and in order to eliminate all possibility of\r\n     restoring the power of the exploiters, it is decreed that all\r\n     toilers be armed, and that a Socialist Red Army be organized and\r\n     the propertied class be disarmed....\r\n\r\n     \"The Russian Republic is a free Socialist society of all the\r\n     working people of Russia. The entire power, within the boundaries\r\n     of the Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic, belongs to all\r\n     the working people of Russia, united in urban and rural Soviets....\r\n\r\n     \"The Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic considers work the\r\n     duty of every citizen of the Republic, and proclaims as its motto:\r\n     'He shall not eat who does not work.'\r\n\r\n     \"The following persons enjoy neither the right to vote nor the\r\n     right to be voted for, even though they belong to one of the\r\n     categories enumerated above, namely:\r\n\r\n     \"Persons who employ hired labor in order to obtain from it an\r\n     increase in profits.\r\n\r\n     \"Persons who have an income without doing any work, such as\r\n     interest from capital, receipts from property, etc.\r\n\r\n     \"Private merchants, trade and commercial brokers.\r\n\r\n     \"Monks and clergy of all denominations.\"\r\n\r\nThis Bolshevist Constitution shows that the Lenine government has\r\ndecreed the socialization of all the land, factories, mills, mines and\r\nother means of production, as well as the railways and the various means\r\nof transportation. This program has been carried out, though as yet\r\nprobably not completely. Conditions in Russia were deplorable under the\r\nregime of the Czar, but the Socialist government has made them a\r\nthousand times worse. Industry has been reduced to an almost negligible\r\nminimum, property has been destroyed on every side and possession made a\r\ncrime. The country has been reduced to chaos, for no one cares to sow\r\nwhere others will reap; and unemployment is widespread, for employers\r\nare outlawed, and the government has not enough satisfactory positions\r\nto offer. The right to hold property is one of the binding forces that\r\nholds civilization together and supplies incentive to labor. Some of the\r\nevil effects of the confiscation and socialization of property in Russia\r\nare shown from the following articles, published by the\r\nSocialists-Revolutionists, a faction of the Marxians opposed to the\r\nBolsheviki. Their paper, \"Vlast Naroda,\" declares:\r\n\r\n     \"The village has taken away the land from the landlords, farmers,\r\n     wealthy peasants and monasteries. It cannot, however, divide it\r\n     peacefully, as was to be expected.\r\n\r\n     \"The more land there is, the greater the appetite for it; hence\r\n     more quarrels, misunderstandings and fights.\r\n\r\n     \"In Oboyansk County, many villages refused to supply soldiers when\r\n     the Soviet authorities were mobilizing an army. In their refusal\r\n     they stated 'in the spring soldiers will be needed at home in the\r\n     villages,' not to cultivate the land, but to protect it with arms\r\n     against neighboring peasants.\r\n\r\n     \"In the Provinces of Kaluga, Kursk and Voronezh peasant meetings\r\n     adopted the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     \"'All grown members of the peasant community have to be home in the\r\n     spring. Whoever will then not return to the village or voluntarily\r\n     stay away will be forever expelled from the community.\r\n\r\n     \"'These provisions are made for the purpose of having as great a\r\n     force as possible in the spring when it comes to dividing the\r\n     land.' ...\r\n\r\n     \"Some villages in the Nieshnov district, in the Province of\r\n     Mohilev, have supplied themselves with machine guns. The village of\r\n     Little Nieshnov, for instance, has decided to order fifteen machine\r\n     guns and has organized a Red Army in order to be able better to\r\n     defend a piece of land taken away from the landlord and, as they\r\n     say, that 'the neighboring peasants should not come to cut our hay\r\n     right in front of our windows, like last year.' When the\r\n     neighboring peasants heard of the decision they also procured\r\n     machine guns. They have formed an army and intend to go to Little\r\n     Nieshnov to cut the hay on the meadows 'under the windows' of the\r\n     disputed owners....\r\n\r\n     \"Stubborn fights for meadows and forests are always going on. They\r\n     often result in skirmishes and murder. There are similar happenings\r\n     in other counties of the Province, for instance, in Petrov,\r\n     Balashov and Arkhar.\r\n\r\n     \"In the Province of Simbirsk there is war between the community\r\n     peasants and shopkeepers. The former have decided to do away with\r\n     'Stolypin heirs,' as they call the shopkeepers. The latter,\r\n     however, have organized and are ready for a stubborn resistance.\r\n     Combats have already taken place. The peasants demolish farms, and\r\n     farmers set fire to towns, villages, thrashing floors, etc.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the results of confiscation and socialization were so bad from\r\nthe very beginning that no less a personage than Lenine himself, in \"A\r\nLetter to American Workingmen,\" published by the Socialist Publication\r\nSociety of Brooklyn, New York, on pages 12 and 13, says:\r\n\r\n     \"Mistakes are being made by our peasants who, at one stroke, in the\r\n     night from October 25 to October 26 (Russian Calendar), 1917, did\r\n     away with all private ownership of land, and are now struggling,\r\n     from month to month, under the greatest difficulties, to correct\r\n     their own mistakes, trying to solve in practice the most difficult\r\n     problems of organizing a new social state, fighting, against\r\n     profiteers to secure the possession of the land, for the workers\r\n     instead of for the speculator, to carry on agricultural production\r\n     under a system of communist farming on a large scale.\r\n\r\n     \"Mistakes are being made by our workmen in their revolutionary\r\n     activity, who, in a few short months, have placed practically all\r\n     the large factories and workers under state ownership, and are now\r\n     learning, from day to day, under the greatest difficulties, to\r\n     conduct the management of entire industries, to reorganize\r\n     industries already organized, to overcome the deadly resistance of\r\n     laziness and middle-class reaction and egotism.\"\r\n\r\nThe Socialists of the United States and other radical elements in our\r\ncountry, after the World War, began to laud to the skies the Russian\r\nSoviets as the most perfect form of government that the world had ever\r\nseen. They were held to far surpass parliaments, congress and other\r\nlegislative bodies and to be the supreme accomplishments of a democratic\r\nform of government. The deputies of the soviets, according to the\r\nBolshevist Constitution, were to be elected by the secret, direct and\r\nequal vote of all the working masses. Theoretically the soviets were\r\nvery attractive, but in reality fall far short of the ideal. \"Struggling\r\nRussia,\" a well-known weekly magazine published in New York City by one\r\nof the groups of Russian Socialists, has this to say about the Soviets\r\nin its issue of April 5, 1919:\r\n\r\n     \"In fact, there never was either a secret election in Soviet\r\n     Russia, or one based on equal suffrage. Elections are usually\r\n     conducted at a given factory or foundry at open meetings, by the\r\n     raising of hands and always under the knowing eye of the chairman.\r\n     The majority of the workers very frequently do not take part in\r\n     these elections at all. The rights of a minority are never\r\n     recognized, as proportional representation has been rejected.\r\n\r\n     \"As regards direct elections, it is again a mere phrase. The\r\n     Central Executive Committee, which is supposed to embody the\r\n     supreme administrative organ of the country, was actually being\r\n     elected through a four-grade system. Local Soviets send their\r\n     representatives to the Provincial Congress, the Provincial Congress\r\n     is represented by delegates at the All-Russian Congress, and only\r\n     this last body elects the Central Executive Committee. Often the\r\n     delegates are not elected by the regular meetings of the Soviets at\r\n     all, but are sent by the Executive Committees, cleverly handpicked\r\n     by the Bolsheviki after the system of proportional representation\r\n     was rejected....\r\n\r\n     \"The exclusion from the Soviets of all who think differently from\r\n     the Bolsheviki developed gradually. They 'cleansed' the Soviets in\r\n     Perm and Ekaterinburg, in January 1918; in Ufa, Saratov, Samara,\r\n     Kazan and Yaroslavl in December, 1917; in Moscow and Petrograd in\r\n     February, 1918. They were excluding all Socialists-Revolutionists\r\n     and the Mensheviki, to say nothing of the People's Socialists and\r\n     members of the Labor Group. Often, when workers demanded new\r\n     elections to the Soviet (as happened in Petrograd late in December\r\n     of 1917, and early in January, 1918), and such elections did take\r\n     place, the Bolsheviki would not permit the newly elected delegates\r\n     to enter the building of the Soviet and frequently arrested them.\r\n     Gradually only Bolsheviki and Socialists-Revolutionists of the Left\r\n     remained in the Soviets. Soon, however, after the assassination in\r\n     Moscow of Count Mirbach, the German Ambassador, and the attempt at\r\n     rebellion in Moscow early in June, 1918, by the\r\n     Socialists-Revolutionists of the Left, the Bolsheviki began to fill\r\n     up the prisons with the latter just as they did with the\r\n     Socialists-Revolutionists of the Right and the Menshiviki.\r\n\r\n     \"So, practically, there remained only Bolsheviki in the Soviets.\r\n     And as there was no difference of opinion among them, regular\r\n     meetings were soon abandoned altogether and the ostensible 'rule of\r\n     the working masses' thus definitely disappeared. A few persons,\r\n     often appointed from above (the Bolsheviki often had recourse to\r\n     bayonets to support the fiction of Soviet rule: in Tumen the\r\n     Executive Committee of a non-existent Soviet was brought from\r\n     Ekaterinburg under a convoy of 800 Red Guards), would rule and lord\r\n     it over the people, tired and weary of the war and a sterile\r\n     revolution.\r\n\r\n     \"Occasional outbursts of popular wrath serve as indications of the\r\n     depth of dissatisfaction which is engendered by the Soviets and\r\n     their offshoots, the Military-Revolutionary Committee. Thus, in the\r\n     Polevsky works, in Ekaterinburg County, a mob of peasants, armed\r\n     with axes, scythes and sticks, fell upon the Soviets and beast-like\r\n     tore into fragments fifty Bolsheviki. In the Neviansk works the\r\n     insurrection of the workers against the Red Army lasted for three\r\n     days, until reinforcements from Perm finally subdued this\r\n     'counter-revolutionary' revolt. In Okhansk County 2,000 peasants\r\n     were shot down for demanding the abolition of the Soviets and the\r\n     re-establishment of the rule of the people.\"\r\n\r\nIn the April 19, 1919, issue of \"Struggling Russia\" we are told that\r\n\"Vlast Naroda,\" in May, 1918, thus described the uprisings against the\r\nSoviets:\r\n\r\n     \"In Kleen, a crowd entered by force the building occupied by the\r\n     Soviets with the intention of bringing the deputies before their\r\n     own court of justice. The latter fled. The Financial Commisary\r\n     committed suicide by shooting himself, in order to escape the\r\n     infuriated crowd.\r\n\r\n     \"In Oriekhovo-Zooyevo, the deputies work in their offices, guarded\r\n     by a most vigilant military force. Even on the streets they are\r\n     accompanied by guards armed with rifles and bayonets.\r\n\r\n     \"In Penza, an attempt has been made on the lives of the Soviet\r\n     members. One of the presiding officers has been wounded. The Soviet\r\n     building is now surrounded with cannons and machine-guns.\r\n\r\n     \"In Svicherka, where the Bolsheviki had ordered a Bartholomew\r\n     night, the deputies are hunted like wild animals....\r\n\r\n     \"In Bielo, all members of the Soviets have been murdered.\r\n\r\n     \"In Soligalich, two of the most prominent members of the Soviets\r\n     have literally been torn to pieces. Two others have been beaten\r\n     half-dead.\r\n\r\n     \"In Atkarsk, several members of the Soviets have been killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Struggling Russia,\" May 31, 1919, informs us that the Petrograd\r\nCommittee of the Socialists-Revolutionists of the Left, in the middle of\r\nMarch, 1919, issued the following proclamation condemning the Petrograd\r\nSoviet:\r\n\r\n     \"Shame to the Bolshevist Violators, Liars and 'Agents\r\n     Provocateurs!'\r\n\r\n     \"The Petrograd Soviet does not express the will of the Workmen,\r\n     Sailors and 'Reds.'\r\n\r\n     \"The Soviet was not elected. The elections were either pretenses or\r\n     held under threats of shooting or starvation. This terrorism\r\n     completely suffocated freedom of speech, the press and meetings of\r\n     the laboring classes.\r\n\r\n     \"The Petrograd Soviet consists of self-appointed Bolsheviki. It is\r\n     a blind tool in the hands of the 'agents-provacateurs,' hangmen and\r\n     assassins of the Bolshevist regime....\r\n\r\n     \"Where is the dictatorship of the proletariat and working\r\n     peasantry? It has been supplanted by the dictatorship of the\r\n     Central Committee of the Bolshevist Party, governing with the\r\n     assistance of a swarm of extraordinary commissions and punitive\r\n     detachments of imported soldiers.\"\r\n\r\nThough the Russian Socialists overthrew the government of the Czar in\r\nthe hope of securing liberty, liberty, under the Bolshevist regime, is\r\nfarther off than it was before. The British High Commissioner, R. H.\r\nBruce-Lockhart, in a telegram sent to the British Foreign Office,\r\nNovember 10, 1918, among other things said:\r\n\r\n     \"The Bolsheviki have established a rule of force and oppression\r\n     unequaled in the history of any autocracy.\r\n\r\n     \"Themselves the fiercest upholders of the right of free speech,\r\n     they have suppressed, since coming into power, every newspaper\r\n     which does not approve their policy.\r\n\r\n     \"The right of holding public meetings has been abolished. The vote\r\n     has been taken away from everybody except the workmen in factories\r\n     and the poorer servants, and even amongst the workmen those who\r\n     dared to vote against the Bolsheviki are marked down by the\r\n     Bolshevist police as counter-revolutionaries, and are fortunate if\r\n     their worst fate is to be thrown into prison, of which in Russia\r\n     today it may truly be said, 'many go in but few come out.'\"\r\n\r\nV. M. Zenzinov, a member of the Central Committee of the\r\nSocialists-Revolutionists, in an article published in \"Struggling\r\nRussia,\" April 12, 1919, speaking of absence of liberty under\r\nBolshevism, says:\r\n\r\n     \"It was during my stay in Petrograd in April, 1918, that a\r\n     conference of factory and industrial plant employees of Petrograd\r\n     and vicinity was held, to which 100,000 Petrograd workingmen (out\r\n     of a total of 132,000) sent delegates. The conference adopted a\r\n     resolution sharply denouncing the Bolshevist regime. Following this\r\n     conference an attempt was made, in May, to call together an\r\n     All-Russian Congress of workmen's deputies in Moscow, but all the\r\n     delegates were arrested by the Bolsheviki, and to this day I am\r\n     ignorant of the fate that befell my comrades.\"\r\n\r\nJustice, as well as liberty, is a dead letter in the land of Lenine, and\r\nconscription is rigidly enforced by the Russian Socialist Government. R.\r\nH. Bruce-Lockhart, to whom reference has been made, in his telegram to\r\nthe British Foreign Office, November 10, 1918, stated:\r\n\r\n     \"The Bolsheviki have abolished even the most primitive forms of\r\n     justice. Thousands of men and women have been shot without even the\r\n     mockery of a trial, and thousands more are left to rot in the\r\n     prisons under conditions to find a parallel to which one must turn\r\n     to the darkest annals of Indian or Chinese history....\r\n\r\n     \"The Bolsheviki who destroyed the Russian army, and who have always\r\n     been the avowed opponents of militarism, have forcibly mobilized\r\n     officers who do not share their political views, but whose\r\n     technical knowledge is indispensable, and by the threat of\r\n     immediate execution have forced them to fight against their\r\n     fellow-countrymen in a civil war of unparalleled horror.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning religious conditions in Russia, the Rev. Dr. George S.\r\nSimons, shortly after his return from that country, testified before the\r\nSenatorial Committee, which, in February, 1919, was investigating the\r\nnature of Russian Bolshevism:\r\n\r\n     \"The Bolshevik is not only an atheist, but he also seeks to make\r\n     all religions impossible. They assert that all misery is due to the\r\n     superstition that there is a God. One of their officials told me:\r\n\r\n     \"'We now propose to enlighten our children, and with this purpose\r\n     in view, we are issuing a catechism on atheism for use in all the\r\n     schools.'\r\n\r\n     \"The man who told me this was the Commissionaire of Enlightenment\r\n     and Education.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 7, 1919, an appeal was sent to Pope Benedict XV, by the\r\nOrthodox Greek clergy of that part of Russia which had not fallen a prey\r\nto the Bolsheviki. It was signed by Sylvester, Archbishop of Omsk,\r\nPresident of the Supreme Administration of the Orthodox Church, and by\r\nother members of the same administration. This letter implored the Holy\r\nFather to deign to take into consideration the conditions existing in\r\nRussia. It exposed a list of crimes and outrages, cities sacked,\r\nchurches profaned and pillaged, more than twenty bishops and more than\r\none hundred priests assassinated, the victims being of every kind. Some\r\nof them before they were put to death had their arms and legs cut off,\r\nwhile others were buried alive. Nuns were violated; the socialization of\r\nwomen was proclaimed; rein was given to unbridled passions; everywhere\r\nthere was nothing but famine, death and misery. The following message is\r\nalso noteworthy:\r\n\r\n     \"With deep grief, Venerable Father, we expose to you the unhappy\r\n     conditions in which millions of Russians of true Russia are\r\n     reduced. Relying on that unity which makes all mankind one, and on\r\n     the strength of Christian fraternity, we hope, Venerable Father,\r\n     that we may count on your compassion as representing the Christian\r\n     Church, and trust that your flock will be informed of what is going\r\n     on, and that in common with you they will offer fervent prayers to\r\n     Him, in whose hands are both life and death, for those who in the\r\n     northeast of Europe are being made, because of their love of\r\n     Christ, Martyrs of the faith in the twentieth century.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dyelo Naroda,\" an organ of the Socialists-Revolutionists of Russia, in\r\nApril, 1918, stated that the situation of the church and clergy was\r\nhorrible. \"Everything pertaining to them is being spit upon and\r\nprofaned. People, with rifles on their shoulders and their hats on,\r\noften enter the church and right there question the clergymen and arrest\r\npriests, at the same time mocking the religious feelings of the praying\r\ncrowd. Many churches have been closed as a result of the edict\r\nconcerning the separation of Church and State.\"\r\n\r\n\"The New York Times,\" April 11, 1919, published the following special\r\ncable despatch concerning the religious persecution:\r\n\r\n     \"London, April 10.--The Chronicle publishes an article by R.\r\n     Courtier Foster, a British Chaplain at Odessa and Russian ports of\r\n     the Black Sea, describing the religious persecution practised by\r\n     the Bolsheviki following upon their former capture of Odessa. He\r\n     says:\r\n\r\n     \"'Committees were held on board the ships of the Black Sea Fleet,\r\n     among the dockers in the port, in the towns and villages on every\r\n     hand, which passed resolutions reading:\r\n\r\n     \"'\"We abolish God.\" In Odessa Cathedral, when the Archbishop of\r\n     Kherson was celebrating the Holy Mysteries, an uproar occurred with\r\n     cries of \"Down with the priests!\" \"Down with the Church!\" At a fête\r\n     in the town gardens one saw a soldier of the Red Army, amid the\r\n     guffaws of his fellows, spit on the Russian holy picture of the\r\n     face of Christ, then tear it into fragments and stamp it into the\r\n     dust.\r\n\r\n     \"'The Bolshevist conception of religious toleration is considerably\r\n     more elastic and far-reaching than the ideas of any mediæval\r\n     inquisition. In this matter the Bolsheviki pride themselves on\r\n     being far in advance of our effete western thought. They have\r\n     murdered Vladimir, the Metropolitan of Kiev, twenty bishops, and\r\n     many hundreds of priests. Before killing them they cut off the\r\n     limbs of their victims, some of whom they buried alive in the\r\n     Kremlin. The Cathedrals in Moscow and those in the towns of\r\n     Yaroslav and Simferopol have been sacked. Many nuns were violated\r\n     and churches defiled.\r\n\r\n     \"'The ancient and historical sacristies and famous libraries of\r\n     Moscow and Petrograd were pillaged and countless sanctuaries\r\n     profaned. In Cronstadt Cathedral the great figure of the Crucified\r\n     Christ was torn down and removed, and a monstrous and appalling\r\n     pagan form placed in its stead, symbolizing \"Freedom of Mind.\"\r\n\r\n     \"'It is not against any one particular form of religion that the\r\n     terrors of the new Freedom are hurled. Orthodox, Roman Catholics\r\n     and Lutherans alike have been tortured, mutilated, and done to\r\n     death under the aegis of the Holy Revolution which appeals to the\r\n     proletariat of the whole world to join its forces.\r\n\r\n     \"'The Revolutionary Government is subjecting the Christian religion\r\n     to persecutions as great and brutal as anything the world saw\r\n     during the first three centuries of the Christian era. Moral\r\n     disintegration and ruin spread their tentacles on every side. Any\r\n     restraint on sinful impulse or covetous desire is laughed to scorn.\r\n     The Bolsheviki publicly encourage outrage and looting. The\r\n     propaganda for freedom of mind is essentially nihilistic. It is\r\n     based on negation and denial of the existence of God, denial of the\r\n     authority of any moral law, denial of all rights of conscience,\r\n     denial of all religious liberty, denial of all freedom of the\r\n     press, denial of any liberty of speech.\r\n\r\n     \"'One officer remarked despairingly to me: \"In Russia now there is\r\n     no God, no Czar, no law, no property, no money, no food--only\r\n     freedom.\" And in that travesty of liberty, which the whole\r\n     civilized world may well shudder at, all mercy, pity and toleration\r\n     are alike scorned. And it is this new and wonderful equality of man\r\n     which by means of torture, outrage and assassinations proclaims the\r\n     \"freedom of mind and body\" to the devastated Russian nation.'\"\r\n\r\nIn an Associated Press despatch, from London, that appeared in \"The New\r\nYork Times\" on April 19, 1919, we are informed that of the 300 priests\r\nin the Perm diocese, 46 have been killed; moreover, that two monasteries\r\nwere pillaged.\r\n\r\nA very interesting and enlightening article on religion in Russia and\r\nthe attitude of the Bolsheviki towards it appears in \"The Proletarian,\"\r\nDetroit, April, 1919. The author is Ernest Greenburg and we shall quote\r\nthe greater part of his article:\r\n\r\n     \"The resolution adopted by the Socialist Party of Michigan at its\r\n     recent State Convention that, 'It shall be the duty of all\r\n     agitators and organizers upon all occasions to avail themselves of\r\n     the opportunity of explaining religion,' caused a storm of\r\n     indignation to arise among certain 'Socialists.' Clinging to the\r\n     old fallacy that religion should be left alone, they point to the\r\n     Russian Constitution and the works of the Bolshevik leaders who say\r\n     'Religion is a private matter.' But they fail to understand that\r\n     the interpretation of the term 'Religion is a private matter,' has\r\n     a different meaning here than it has in Russia.\r\n\r\n     \"The slogan, 'Religion is a private matter,' is not of Russian\r\n     origin. It has been and is one of the battle cries of the\r\n     Revolutionary working class in all countries in which the Church\r\n     and the State are combined. Different conditions account for\r\n     different understandings of the terms 'Private Matter' here and in\r\n     Russia.\r\n\r\n     \"Probably in no other country have religion and the church played\r\n     such an important role in the affairs of the state as in Russia up\r\n     to the very present time. Truly, it was not so much the force of\r\n     arms as that of ignorance which kept up the Czardom for hundreds of\r\n     years. The Feudal aristocracy realized the advantages to be derived\r\n     from keeping the minds of its slaves in darkness and superstition.\r\n     One of the most powerful weapons in the hands of aristocracy was\r\n     the Church, whose noble duty it was to sow and to propagate\r\n     ignorance. The Church was officially a part of the state. People\r\n     were forced to go to church; school children[10] were taught the\r\n     'Holy Law of God,' attacks against the church were punished as\r\n     attacks against the Czar.\r\n\r\n     \"Religious ignorance of the masses was the greatest enemy of the\r\n     Socialists in their propaganda work; at every step they had to meet\r\n     and to combat the authority of God, in whose name the church\r\n     servants consecrated the yoke of the Czar and the landlords. It was\r\n     necessary to pull this poisonous tooth out of the jaws of the\r\n     state. Hence came the demand: 'Religion is a private\r\n     matter,'--private as opposed to state. It meant that the Church\r\n     should be separated from the state and be deprived from its\r\n     protection. It was a demand which, put to the Czarist government,\r\n     if granted would only facilitate the struggle against this very\r\n     religion.\r\n\r\n     \"Similar demands have been put in the Socialist platforms of\r\n     Germany, Austria, and other countries which were confronted with\r\n     conditions like those in Russia. One of the immediate demands of\r\n     the French revolutionists of the nineteenth century was of this\r\n     nature.\r\n\r\n     \"The November Revolution put the Russian workers in possession of\r\n     the machinery of the church. As a weapon of ignorance, it could not\r\n     be used against the exploiters; nor could it be destroyed by force.\r\n     Then the Russian workers declared religion a private matter,\r\n     thereby depriving it of State protection and forcing it under the\r\n     blows of scientific criticism, which will rapidly do away with the\r\n     reminders of the decrepit superstitions.\r\n\r\n     \"In America religion always was 'a private matter.' It had never\r\n     been officially related to the state, but just the same it is now\r\n     being employed by the ruling class against the workers. If it is\r\n     not yet as influential here as it was in Russia during the reign of\r\n     the Czars--it is becoming so. Its destructive work cannot be\r\n     neglected any longer. It must be fought....\r\n\r\n     \"German Socialists understand that by destroying the holy alliance\r\n     between the Church and the State their task would not be completed.\r\n     After that 'We must wage unrelenting war against the Church,' says\r\n     Bebel, 'because she foments civil war among the workers--because it\r\n     is the only reactionary force which has any strength and which\r\n     keeps us in voluntary slavery.'\r\n\r\n     \"By separating the Church from the State and thereby enforcing\r\n     their demand, 'Religion is a private matter,' the French Socialists\r\n     were not yet satisfied. They went on fighting religion, and their\r\n     Belgian comrades worked in accord with them. Says E. Vandervelde,\r\n     'We are bound to admit that both in philosophy and in politics\r\n     there must be war between Socialism and the Church.'\r\n\r\n     \"This attitude of the French and Belgian Socialists was approved by\r\n     the international Congress at Amsterdam, 1904.\r\n\r\n     \"The position of the Russian Socialists is very clear. They fully\r\n     understand that 'Religion is a private matter' signifies only the\r\n     first stage in the war against mental slavery. 'Religion is a\r\n     private matter,' says N. Boucharin (The Church and the School),\r\n     'but it does not mean that we must not fight it by persuasion.'\r\n     Further on he emphasizes that it is a 'private matter' only as\r\n     much as forceful protection or forceful destruction is concerned.\r\n     Beyond the gates of the State's protection, religion is not\r\n     considered to be a private matter in Russia. It is fought there in\r\n     schools and educational institutions by 'Propaganda, explanation\r\n     and education.'\r\n\r\n     \"In this question American Socialists must not be misled by the\r\n     seeming contradiction in terms.\"\r\n\r\nIn the April 19, 1919, number of \"Struggling Russia,\" Dioneo gives some\r\ninteresting information relative to the destruction of education under\r\nthe Bolshevist regime:\r\n\r\n     \"The lower and secondary schools are ruined. The villages have\r\n     their Soviets, their premises for meetings, but no lower schools.\r\n     As regards secondary schools, the Bolshevist reformers are of the\r\n     opinion that, in general, such institutions are not wanted and are\r\n     just as unnecessary as the intermediate stage between nascent\r\n     capitalism and the extreme form of communism.\r\n\r\n     \"The Bolsheviki have only acknowledged the universities. At first,\r\n     the reformers made such experiments on the latter as, for instance,\r\n     the appointment of a porter to the post of inspector of the\r\n     Technological institute, or of a cook as head-mistress of the\r\n     Higher Courses for Girls. Then the Bolsheviki decided that no\r\n     certificates were necessary for matriculation at the university.\r\n     Any half-educated person might become a student of any faculty. The\r\n     professors were at a loss to know how to lecture on higher\r\n     mathematics to students ignorant of the multiplication table, or\r\n     how to explain spectral analysis to persons hardly able to read.\r\n     Then the Bolsheviki decided that there was no necessity for the\r\n     professor to have a diploma either. It was only necessary that he\r\n     should be a supporter of the Bolshevist platform. That is all! And\r\n     celebrated Professors were obliged to leave the universities which\r\n     they had made famous....\r\n\r\n     \"National education--elementary, secondary, and higher--has been\r\n     completely ruined by the Bolsheviki. Lately, they have apparently\r\n     decided that Bolshevism ought to give the world a new type of\r\n     university, quite different from that of the bourgeoisie. And with\r\n     that in mind, the Municipal Council of Voronezh has thought of a\r\n     'Street University.' This is how the 'Izvestia' describes this\r\n     curious institution of higher education: 'Each of the principal\r\n     thoroughfares of Voronezh is now a faculty--of law, economics,\r\n     history, literature, science, etc. The walls of the houses are\r\n     placarded with posters, containing portraits and brief biographies\r\n     of men distinguished in one or another branch of knowledge and\r\n     brief items of information concerning the respective subject.'\r\n     Thus comments the organ of the Bolshevist Government: 'Every\r\n     citizen, instead of spending years at a university, can pick up a\r\n     general knowledge of the principal educational subjects as he goes\r\n     along.' ...\r\n\r\n     \"Russia's school system is ruined. Education reforms exist only on\r\n     paper. And at the same time the Bolsheviki, wishing to show that\r\n     they value knowledge very highly, have announced that a\r\n     geographical university such as the world has 'never yet seen' is\r\n     going to be opened in Petrograd. It is interesting to know what\r\n     professors will lecture in this new university, and who will form\r\n     their audience?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nRUSSIA RED WITH BLOOD AND BLACK WITH CRIME\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSocialists have for many years boasted of the perfect peace and harmony\r\nwhich would prevail when once they had established their state.\r\nBloodshed, civil discord and strife of every kind would cease when the\r\nMarxian workers ruled the land, for, as they said, privately owned\r\nproperty, and exploitation of workers are the source of wars and the\r\nfundamental cause of the oppression of the people. Bolshevist Russia,\r\nhowever, the first Socialist country, appears to be an exception.\r\nPerhaps no nation has ever witnessed such scenes of violence, bloodshed,\r\nmurder and cruelty, perpetrated by a government, not against a foreign\r\nfoe, but against its own people, and this not after an existence of a\r\nhundred or several hundred years, but constantly from its very birth. So\r\nfar only a few pages, comparatively speaking, of the history of the\r\nterrible outrages are opened to us, but from these we can form some\r\nslight idea of the dreadful condition of the land that is truly red, but\r\nred principally from the rivers of blood that flow in abundance over\r\nevery section of the country.\r\n\r\nThe \"Izvestia,\" an official Bolshevist publication, on October 19, 1918,\r\npublished the following news item under the heading, \"The Conference of\r\nthe Extraordinary Commission:\"\r\n\r\n\"Comrade Baky threw light on the work of the District Commission of\r\nPetrograd after the departure of the All-Russian Extraordinary\r\nCommission for Moscow. The total number of people arrested by the\r\nExtraordinary Commission amounted to 6,220. Eight hundred people were\r\nshot.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Northern Commune,\" another official Bolshevist publication, in its\r\nissue of September 10, 1918, stated:\r\n\r\n     \"In the whole of the Jaroslavl Government a strict registration of\r\n     the bourgeoisie and its partisans has been organized. Manifestly\r\n     anti-Soviet elements are being shot; suspected persons are being\r\n     interned in concentration camps; non-working sections of the\r\n     population are being subjected to compulsory labor.\"\r\n\r\nThe same edition of the \"Northern Commune\" publishes the following\r\ndespatch:\r\n\r\n     \"Tver, Sept. 9.--The Extraordinary Commission has arrested and sent\r\n     to concentration camps over 130 hostages from among the\r\n     bourgeoisie. The prisoners include members of the Cadet Party,\r\n     Socialists-Revolutionists of the Right, former officers, well known\r\n     members of the propertied class and policemen.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the September 18, 1918, edition of the \"Northern Commune\" we learn\r\nthat in Perm, in retaliation for the assassination of Uritzky and for\r\nthe attempt on Lenine, fifty hostages from among the bourgeois classes\r\nand the White Guards were shot.\r\n\r\n\"Struggling Russia,\" March 22, 1919, supplies us with other details of\r\nBolshevist rifle rule:\r\n\r\n     \"We know a great deal about the terror in Petrograd, and\r\n     considerably less about Moscow. The reason is plain. We find the\r\n     curtain dropped on the activities of the All-Russian Extraordinary\r\n     Commission which had its seat in Moscow. In a report of the meeting\r\n     of the Executive Committee of the Moscow Soviet, which took place\r\n     on October 16, we read:\r\n\r\n     \"'The report of the work of the All-Russian Extraordinary\r\n     Commission was read at a secret session of the Executive Committee.\r\n     But the report and the discussion of it were held behind closed\r\n     doors and will not be published.' ['Izvestia,' October 17, 1918.]\r\n\r\n     \"The kind of decisions adopted by the Moscow Bolsheviki behind\r\n     closed doors and the mass terror practised in Moscow and all over\r\n     Russia under the direction of the All-Russian Extraordinary\r\n     Commission are well illustrated by Eugene Trupp, a prominent\r\n     Socialist-Revolutionist and a member of the All-Russian Constituent\r\n     Assembly, who wrote the following in the Socialist-Revolutionary\r\n     daily, 'Zemlia i Volia' (Land and Freedom) of October 3, 1918:\r\n\r\n     \"'After the murder of Uritzky in Petrograd, 1,500 people were\r\n     arrested; 512, including 10 Socialists-Revolutionists, were shot.\r\n     At the same time 800 people were arrested in Moscow. It is unknown,\r\n     however, how many of these were shot. In Nizhni-Novgorod, 41 were\r\n     shot; in Yaroslavl, 13; in Astrakhan, 12 Socialists-Revolutionists;\r\n     in Sarapool, a member of the Central Committee of the Party of\r\n     Socialists-Revolutionists, I. I. Teterkin; in Penza, about 40\r\n     officers; in Kooznetzk people are daily shot in masses; all this is\r\n     only a drop in the ocean. I have no exact information as to the\r\n     number of people shot in other cities.' ...\r\n\r\n     \"'Despite all these and other outrages, a demonstration of Red\r\n     Guards took place in Moscow on September 6. Their main demands were\r\n     \"deeds for words\" and \"relentless red terror in the fight against\r\n     the bourgeoisie.\" ...\r\n\r\n     \"'The last days of my stay Moscow and Soviet-Russia in general were\r\n     filled with red terror. A gray, silent and dejected crowd, with\r\n     pale, terrified faces and eyes full of excitement, was moving along\r\n     the streets. \"Such or such people have been arrested today.\" \"This\r\n     or that number has been shot.\" \"Do not sleep at home, they are\r\n     looking for you.\" \"You are still alive?\" \"Why do you not go away\r\n     from here?\" were expressions hastily exchanged.\r\n\r\n     \"'No conversations were heard; only silent whispering in corners.\r\n     All were trembling.

While traveling you feel that if your face or\r\n     perhaps your attire, or your opinion, carelessly uttered, will not\r\n     please them, you may be held up at any moment. You feel that every\r\n     passenger is hiding something in himself. Keep silent; we will\r\n     talk later when we have passed the spying cordons.'\"\r\n\r\nIn the September 18, 1918, evening issue of the \"Northern Commune,\"\r\nthere is a report of a meeting of the Soviet of the First District of\r\nPetrograd. After a report made by Kharitonoff, who emphasized the\r\nnecessity of suppressing the bourgeois press, and after speeches by\r\nother members, the following resolution was passed:\r\n\r\n     \"The meeting welcomes the fact that mass terror is being used\r\n     against the White Guards and higher bourgeois classes, and declares\r\n     that every attempt on the life of our leaders will be answered by\r\n     the proletariat by the shooting down not only of hundreds, as the\r\n     case is now, but of thousands of White Guards, bankers,\r\n     manufacturers, Cadets (Constitutional Democrats) and\r\n     Socialists-Revolutionists of the Right.\"\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to \"Struggling Russia,\" March 29, 1919, for the\r\nfollowing information as regards the Red rule of Lenine and the shooting\r\nof children:\r\n\r\n     \"The following quotation from a speech of one of the most active\r\n     Bolshevist leaders, Zinoviev, printed in the 'Northern Commune' of\r\n     September 19, 1918, fully expresses the spirit of the Bolshevist\r\n     terrorism:\r\n\r\n     \"'To overcome our enemies we must have our own Socialist\r\n     Militarism. We must win over to our side 90 millions out of the 100\r\n     millions of population of Russia under the Soviets. As for the\r\n     rest, we have nothing to say to them; they must be annihilated.'\r\n\r\n     \"The program of annihilating ten million of the opponents of\r\n     Bolshevism in Russia (Mr. Zinoviev has considerably underestimated\r\n     their number) began to be executed by the Bolsheviki from the first\r\n     moment of their coming into power. In the beginning of March, 1918,\r\n     they held mass executions in Rostov-on-the-Don, killing, among\r\n     others, many youths. The Moscow 'Russkiya Viedomosti' (Russian\r\n     News) in its issue of March 23, 1918, reported that the president\r\n     of the Rostov Municipal Council and the Chairman of the Don\r\n     Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Party, B. C. Vasiliev,\r\n     the mayor of the city, P. Petrenko, the former Chairman of the\r\n     Rostov-Nakhichevan Council of Workingmen's and Soldiers' Delegates,\r\n     P. Melnikov, and even M. Smirnov, at that time Chairman of the\r\n     Council, have handed in a petition to the Bolshevist\r\n     War-Revolutionary Council asking them to shoot them 'instead of the\r\n     innocent children who are executed without law and justice.' A\r\n     group of women, horrified by what was going on, also asked that\r\n     they be shot instead of the children. In their petition they wrote\r\n     as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"'If, according to you, there is need of sacrifices in blood and\r\n     life in order to establish a Socialistic state and to create new\r\n     ways of life, take our lives, kill us, grown mothers and fathers,\r\n     but let our children live. They have not yet had a chance to live;\r\n     they are only growing and developing. Do not destroy young lives.\r\n     Take our lives and our blood as ransom....\r\n\r\n     \"'We, mothers, have served the country by giving our sons, husbands\r\n     and brothers. Pray, take our last possession, our lives, but spare\r\n     our children. Call us, one after the other, for execution, when our\r\n     children are to be shot! Every one of us would gladly die in order\r\n     to save the life of her children or that of other children.\r\n\r\n     \"'Citizens, members of the War Revolutionary Council, listen to the\r\n     cries of the mothers. We cannot be kept silent!'\"\r\n\r\nCharles Dumas, a French Socialist, on his return to France from Russia,\r\nwrote a book in which he warns his fellow-comrades on the dangers of\r\nBolshevism, and among other things he says:\r\n\r\n     \"Upon my arrival in Petrograd I wanted, first of all, to meet three\r\n     of my old Russian friends, but soon learned that my searches were\r\n     in vain. Two of the poor fellows had lost their minds and the third\r\n     had cut his own throat with a razor....\r\n\r\n     \"The Sebastopol horrors of March, 1918, when the sailors of the\r\n     port, inflamed to a high pitch of bestiality by the Bolshevist\r\n     press decided to kill all the inhabitants of the principal streets,\r\n     not sparing even children above the age of five, are still so fresh\r\n     in your minds that I need not remind you of them....\r\n\r\n     \"On March 18, 1918, the peasants of an adjoining village organized,\r\n     in collusion with the Bolsheviki, a veritable St. Bartholomew night\r\n     in the city of Kuklovo. About 500 bodies of the victims were found\r\n     afterwards, most of them 'intellectuals.' All residences and stores\r\n     were plundered and destroyed, the Jews being among the worst\r\n     sufferers. Entire families were wiped out, and for three days the\r\n     Bolsheviki would not permit the burial of the dead.\r\n\r\n     \"In May, 1918, the city of Korocha was the scene of a horrible\r\n     massacre. Thirty officers, four priests, and 300 citizens were\r\n     killed. The Peoples' Commissaries and the Soviets have, upon more\r\n     than one occasion, made admissions that these horrors were part of\r\n     their program. At the Congress of the Soviets the chairman of the\r\n     Central Committee of the Soviets, Sverdlov, said: 'We invoke the\r\n     Soviets not to relent, but to fortify the Terror, no matter how\r\n     terrible it may be and what dimensions it may assume.'\"\r\n\r\nAn Associated Press despatch, dated Omsk, April 5, 1919, stated that the\r\nBolsheviki had murdered 2,000 at or near Osa:\r\n\r\n     \"Indisputable evidence of the massacre by the Bolsheviki of more\r\n     than 2,000 civilians in and near the town of Osa has been obtained\r\n     by Messrs. Simmonds and Emerson and Dr. Rudolph Teusler of the\r\n     American Red Cross, who have just returned from reoccupied Russian\r\n     territory. Approximately 500 persons were killed at Osa and 1,500\r\n     in the surrounding districts.\"\r\n\r\nThe same despatch shows the excessive cruelty of Lenine's gang of\r\nblood-thirsty Reds:\r\n\r\n     \"A blacksmith was shot because he could not pay 5,000 rubles. A man\r\n     was shot because he lived in a brick house. All attorneys and\r\n     jurists and doctors whose services were not required were killed. A\r\n     woman was compelled to fetch a lamp and gaze upon her murdered sons\r\n     for the amusement of the slayers.\r\n\r\n     \"The Soviet called a meeting and prepared lists of those to die.\r\n     The houses prescribed were visited by squads, the doors were\r\n     smashed in, the victims dragged to the edge of the town and forced\r\n     to dig their own graves. A survivor testified that he had seen men\r\n     thrown into a pit and buried alive. Priests were hunted\r\n     unmercifully. The evidence showed that men were slain whose only\r\n     offense was that they worked as sextons or caretakers of churches.\r\n     In the Perm district everything of value was stolen from the\r\n     churches, the monastery was looted and several priests were\r\n     murdered.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to two more Associated Press despatches, even women and\r\nchildren were not excepted by the Bolsheviki who have been so much\r\nextolled by our American Socialists and recognized as their brethren:\r\n\r\n     \"Stockholm, April 17, 1919.--The Bolsheviki are carrying out a\r\n     rapid and systematic annihilation of all the bourgeois elements in\r\n     Riga, according to reports from Libau to 'Svenska Dagblast.' The\r\n     victims of the Bolsheviki terror are taken to the Island of Hasen,\r\n     in the Dvina river, and are said to number 70,000, including women\r\n     and children. No one is permitted to take food or money to the\r\n     island.\"\r\n\r\n     \"London, April 17, 1919.--Eighteen hundred persons, including 400\r\n     women, were murdered by the Bolsheviki at Ufa, according to a\r\n     dispatch from Omsk, received in official quarters here.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Northern Commune\" published the following report in which the\r\nhorrors of the Bolsheviki prisons were described by the Bolsheviki\r\nthemselves:\r\n\r\n     \"The presiding officers of the Soviet of the Viborg district\r\n     decided to send a delegation to the prisons of that district when\r\n     they heard that terrible scenes were occurring there. The prisoners\r\n     were starving. Many of them who had been held eight months had not\r\n     yet been tried, for the Commission entrusted with the investigation\r\n     of their cases had not yet been in session.\r\n\r\n     \"The delegation consisted of Dr. Petropavlovsky, the Military\r\n     Commissionary, Vasilyevsky, and the President of the Soviet,\r\n     Frilisser. The latter handed in the following report: 'Comrades,\r\n     what we saw and heard in visiting the prisons of the Viborg\r\n     district cannot be described....\r\n\r\n     \"'The cells are repulsively dirty. There is neither clean linen nor\r\n     pillows. The prisoners are being punished for the least offence.\r\n\r\n     \"'But what is most terrible is the scene we witnessed in the prison\r\n     hospital.\r\n\r\n     \"'Comrades! We found there no people! We found there living ghosts\r\n     who had no strength to talk, for they were starving.\r\n\r\n     \"'When somebody dies, the corpse remains for several hours with its\r\n     living neighbors, who say: \"That is nothing. We shall all soon die\r\n     of hunger.\"'\"\r\n\r\n\"Dyelo Naroda,\" in its issue of April 26, 1918, thus describes the\r\ncruelties of the barbarous Bolshevists:\r\n\r\n     \"In Kirensk County the people's tribunal ordered a woman found\r\n     guilty of extracting brandy, to be enclosed in a bag and repeatedly\r\n     knocked against the ground until dead.\r\n\r\n     \"In the Province of Tver the people's tribunal had sentenced a\r\n     young fellow to freeze to death for theft. In a rigid frost he was\r\n     led out, clad only in a shirt, and water was poured on him until he\r\n     turned into a piece of ice. Out of pity somebody cut his tortures\r\n     short by shooting him.\"\r\n\r\nThe British High Commissioner, R. H. Bruce-Lockhart, in his telegram to\r\nthe British Foreign Office, November 10, 1918, thus describes one of the\r\nmethods of torture and the taking of hostages as practiced by the\r\nfollowers of the \"gentle\" Lenine:\r\n\r\n     \"The Bolsheviki have restored the barbarous methods of torture. The\r\n     examination of prisoners frequently takes place with a revolver at\r\n     the unfortunate prisoner's head.\r\n\r\n     \"The Bolsheviki have established the odious practice of taking\r\n     hostages. Still worse, they have struck at their political\r\n     opponents through their woman folk. When recently a long list of\r\n     hostages was published in Petrograd, the Bolsheviki seized the\r\n     wives of those men whom they could not find and threw them into\r\n     prison until their husbands should give themselves up.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Bolsheviki were forced to evacuate Riga, in May, 1919, they\r\nleft behind them in the [**] prisons 1,600 hostages who were found to be\r\nin a state of unspeakable misery and starvation.\r\n\r\nAn Associated Press despatch of March 22, 1919, states that \"a Russian\r\ngirl of 19 years, who, in December, 1918, had been charged with\r\nespionage, was tortured by being pierced thirteen times in the same\r\nwound with a bayonet. She lived, however, and made an affidavit to these\r\ndetails.\"\r\n\r\nThe same dispatch states that \"an examination of dead bodies of persons\r\nalleged to have been killed by the Bolsheviki in the Perm district,\r\nshows a preponderance of bayonet wounds in the back, but in other\r\ninstances mouths were slit, fingers and hands cut off, and the heads of\r\nthe victims smashed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Struggling Russia,\" in its issue of April 5, 1919, informs us that\r\n\"officers have come out of Petrograd prisons with their nails torn off,\r\nand that prisoners after having been fed on herrings were given nothing\r\nto drink for two or three days.\"\r\n\r\nA dispatch from Warsaw, dated April 10, 1919, stated that fugitives from\r\nRussia were pouring into that city, each of them bringing fresh tales of\r\nBolsheviki horrors. The people in Russia, it was said, were being shot\r\non the least provocation. For instance, men who remained in bed during\r\nthe cold weather to keep warm because they had no fuel were accused of\r\n\"discontent\" and dragged into the streets and shot. Dead bodies, it was\r\nclaimed, were left lying in the streets in heaps.\r\n\r\nIn order to maintain their popularity with the workingmen and with their\r\nhired mercenaries, the Bolsheviki paid their supporters enormous wages\r\nby means of an unchecked paper issue. In fact they have turned out so\r\nmany tons of paper money, without financial guarantees of any sort, that\r\ntoday in Russia money has lost practically all its value.\r\n\r\n\"Struggling Russia,\" March 22, 1919, publishes an appeal issued in\r\nPetrograd and signed by the following organizations: Committee for the\r\nDefence of Freedom of the Press; Central Committee of the Russian Social\r\nDemocratic Labor Party; Central Committee of the Party of\r\nSocialists-Revolutionists; Central Committee of the Councils of Peasant\r\nDeputies and the Union of Workmen-Printers. Among other things the\r\nappeal says:\r\n\r\n     \"Civil war has inflamed the whole country. Cities are being\r\n     destroyed. The war of brother against brother is consuming the\r\n     strength of our revolutionary democracy. The cannons, secured to\r\n     guard the conquests of our revolution, shatter monuments, homes,\r\n     and shrines of art. The cities of Russia fall at the hands of her\r\n     own citizens....\r\n\r\n     \"The nation is being driven towards ruin. The people are deprived\r\n     of all liberties won by the revolution.\"\r\n\r\nThe April 26, 1919, issue of \"Struggling Russia,\" under the caption,\r\n\"City of the Dead,\" describes the deplorable condition of Petrograd as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"Vladimir Bourtzev published in his paper, 'Obscherye Dyelo,' (The\r\n     Common Cause), appearing in Paris, an interview with a well known\r\n     pedagogist and journalist, C. L. Avaliani, who recently arrived\r\n     from Petrograd. Mr. Avaliani lived in Petrograd during the bright,\r\n     early days of the revolution and has also witnessed the tragic\r\n     period of the Bolshevist rule:\r\n\r\n     \"'That Petrograd that used to draw to itself the leading social and\r\n     scientific forces is no more. That living spring that sent upward a\r\n     spray of rainbow hues and colors has gradually died out and is now\r\n     finally extinct.\r\n\r\n     \"'There is no scientific activity, no research work, no literary or\r\n     artistic life. All is leveled down and compressed under one\r\n     Bolshevist lid. The only burning question is the problem of food.\r\n     The only blessed object of Bolshevist providence is the remaining\r\n     bourgeois element, the only axis around which all their creative\r\n     experiments revolve. On the one hand, those who toil,--and on the\r\n     other the \"parasites,\" and to the latter class all the members of\r\n     the liberal professions, all the literateurs, the lawyers and the\r\n     clergy were assigned. The sympathizers and upholders of the \"rule\r\n     of the Soviets\" get a food ticket; all the others are sentenced to\r\n     starvation.\r\n\r\n     \"'It is a rule that rests solely on bayonets! There is no popular\r\n     confidence, no social support. It is all regarded as superfluous\r\n     and a \"burgeois\" prejudice.

In the year 1919 the revolutionary outbreaks seem to\r\nhave become far more numerous.\r\n\r\nEvidence as to the criminal nature of Russian Bolshevism was supplied by\r\nthe Rev. Dr. George S. Simons, who, in February, 1919, testified before\r\nthe Senatorial Committee as to his personal knowledge of the matter:\r\n\r\n     \"There is a large criminal element in the Bolshevist regime. The\r\n     fact that the criminal has a big part in the movement is proven by\r\n     the destruction in a public bonfire of court records, the\r\n     destruction of prisons and the liberation of all criminals who are\r\n     sympathetic with the cause. We know it to be a fact that some of\r\n     the worst criminal characters in all Russia hold positions under\r\n     the Bolshevist Government, while others are helping as agitators.\"\r\n\r\nA press dispatch dated Warsaw, April 10, 1919, states that it has been\r\ndecided by the Bolsheviki regime that control of desire of impulse, even\r\nwhen self-imposed, is against the freedom of man, that as a consequence\r\nunbelievable orgies and indecencies take place, and that all restraint\r\nis at an end. The despatch states, futhermore[11], that the aristocrats\r\nremaining in Russia have lost all will and energy. They accept\r\ndegradation or death with complete fatalism and do not even try to save\r\ntheir wives and daughters.\r\n\r\nThe deplorable condition of that part of Russia under Bolshevist rule\r\nwas described in the Declaration adopted by the Socialist groups in Omsk\r\non February 23, 1919. The Declaration says in part:\r\n\r\n     \"The main prop of an agricultural country such as Russia\r\n     principally is, the peasant population, is pauperized, starving and\r\n     is being driven under the banners of the Red Armies by lash and\r\n     rifle. The numerically small class of intellectuals is being shot\r\n     down and exterminated. The cities have been handed over to the\r\n     pillage and rule of Red Army troops. The prisons are overcrowded.\r\n     The enemies of the people have carried out their destructive\r\n     program to the very end, and given the people, in place of bread,\r\n     peace and freedom--a new inter-Russian war, the complete exhaustion\r\n     of all the productive forces of the land, economic, industrial and\r\n     railroad desolation, unemployment, a terrorizing reign of disorder\r\n     and a lapse into barbarity.\"\r\n\r\nThe Council of the All-Siberian Co-operative Assemblies, in a\r\nDeclaration brought to this country by C. A. Kovalsky, a prominent\r\nRussian writer and a member of the Party of Socialists-Revolutionists,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     \"The All-Siberian Co-operative Movement--as the expression of the\r\n     unity of the creative democratic elements--strives for the\r\n     rehabilitation of the destroyed statehood of Russia....\r\n\r\n     \"The immediate aims of our political activities must be--the\r\n     support of the existing Omsk Government, which has proclaimed\r\n     itself a democratic rule; the steering of its political course into\r\n     democratic channels; the struggle with anti-democratic influences\r\n     from the Right as well as with the destructive forces from the\r\n     left; the strengthening of the ties between the rear and the\r\n     fighting front, and the support of the army as the cultural force\r\n     which is reconquering the violated rights of the people to the\r\n     formation of a democratic state.\"\r\n\r\nThe Russian Co-operative Unions, having a membership of over 20,000,000,\r\nand representing the strongest economic organization in Russia, reaching\r\nevery little town and village, announced through its representatives in\r\nNew York, on May 20, 1919, its opposition to the Lenine regime and its\r\nsupport of the Provisional Russian Government at Omsk, Siberia, headed\r\nby Admiral Kolchak:\r\n\r\n     \"When Russia fell under the Bolshevist Soviet rule, the\r\n     representatives of the Co-operative Organizations, at the\r\n     All-Russian Co-operative Congress in Moscow, April 18 to 24, 1918,\r\n     rejected the principles and the methods of the Bolsheviki and\r\n     declared the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, concluded by the Soviet\r\n     authorities with the Austro-German, dishonorable and ruinous for\r\n     Russia. In these terrible and trying times of bloody rule that our\r\n     suffering and worn-out country is passing through, the Co-operative\r\n     Organizations of Siberia and North Russia serve as a unifying link\r\n     for all the honest, healthy and State-preserving elements of the\r\n     Russian democracy.\r\n\r\n     \"The All-Siberian United Co-operatives are fully cognizant of the\r\n     abnormal conditions in which the territories liberated from the\r\n     Bolsheviki--the Ural, Siberia and the North Russian Provinces--find\r\n     themselves, where in pain and anguish a new Russian Statehood is\r\n     arising. Nevertheless, considering the unusual difficulties\r\n     connected with the work of rebuilding and re-establishing legality\r\n     and order in a land overburdened financially and economically,\r\n     ravaged by civil war and hunger, and with a popular psychology\r\n     corrupted by Bolshevism, the United Co-operatives recognize and\r\n     support, until the formation of a new, ultimate government through\r\n     the Constituent Assembly, the Provisional Russian Government formed\r\n     on Siberian territory and headed by Admiral Kolchak....\r\n\r\n     \"We have, on our side, State wisdom, equity and justice. Our\r\n     adversaries oppose us with terror, violence and complete social and\r\n     economic ruin.\"\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the year 1919, the report reached America that the\r\nBolshevist authorities were nationalizing women. The Socialists of our\r\nown country, who are far from being noted for their reliability and\r\ntruthfulness, have, of course, denied the charge, in order that the\r\nLenine regime, which they support and wish to see extended to our own\r\nland, might not have its already terribly sullied name dishonored still\r\nmore. The Bolshevists are far from being saints, and a \"few\" of their\r\n\"shortcomings\" have been pointed out in this chapter.\r\n\r\nCertainly the Lenine Government is absolutely lax in matters\r\nappertaining to sex relations. It has fully legalized free love, as we\r\nlearn from the No. 2 issue of the radical Los Angeles magazine, \"More\r\nTruth About Russia.\" This magazine, of course, defends the Bolshevists,\r\nand on page 6 of the above-mentioned issue quotes several of the decrees\r\nof the Lenine Government on the matter of marriage and divorce. Among\r\nthe decrees we read:\r\n\r\n\"Marriage is annulled by the petition of both parties or even one of\r\nthem.\" All that is necessary to annul a marriage is the expressed desire\r\nof either party. The party is, of course, then free to marry again and\r\nremain married till another partner is desired. Hence free love is\r\nlegalized. A government that legalizes free love may be expected to\r\nnationalize those women who do not wish to marry or who are unable to\r\nsecure partners by the time they have reached a certain age.\r\n\r\n\"The Call,\" New York, April 2, 1919, on its editorial page reprinted an\r\napology of the English publication, \"New Europe,\" which in a previous\r\nissue had given as the authority for its charge of the nationalization\r\nof women in Russia an article in the Soviet paper \"Izvestija:\"\r\n\r\n\"I have made particular inquiries among friends recently arrived from\r\nRussia,\" says Dr. Harold Williams, \"New Europe's\" collaborator, \"as to\r\nthe alleged nationalization of women, and they have all assured me\r\npositively that they have never heard or read of such a decree.\"\r\n\r\nThose \"friends,\" whoever they were, were possibly Bolsheviki themselves,\r\nand are not said to have denied that the women were nationalized, but\r\nmerely that they had never heard or read of the \"decree.\" Lots of things\r\nare enforced by authorities without decrees. The Bolshevist authorities\r\nmay have had no decrees for the murder of the many thousands of innocent\r\ncitizens whom they tortured and put to death.\r\n\r\nDr. Harold Williams states, moreover, that it is certain that \"the\r\nCentral Bolshevist Government has issued no order of the kind\" (i.e., of\r\nnationalization), but he does not deny that in different places the\r\nlocal Bolshevist authorities may have nationalized women.\r\n\r\nFurther on it is admitted that not the official national Soviet organ,\r\nbut the local Vladimir Soviet organ, \"Izvestija,\" was the Bolshevist\r\npaper which stated that the Bolshevists of Vladimir had nationalized\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nThe article in \"New Europe,\" republished in \"The Call,\" concludes with\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n     \"As this puts an entirely different complexion on the matter, and\r\n     as the Central Moscow Government cannot be held responsible for the\r\n     lucubrations of every local committee, we desire to withdraw\r\n     unreservedly the imputation and to express our regret for the\r\n     mistake.\"\r\n\r\nThis article in the March 13, 1919, issue of \"New Europe,\" which thus\r\napologizes for the \"mistake\" that it claims it made in a previous issue,\r\nhas been quoted far and wide by American Socialists and other radicals\r\nof our country. Yet witnesses who were questioned at the Senatorial\r\ninvestigation at Washington, in February, 1919, attested to the\r\nnationalization by the Bolshevists.\r\n\r\nOn February 7, 1919, the Orthodox Greek Archbishop of Omsk and other\r\nclergy of the Russian Church sent a letter to Pope Benedict XV,\r\nmentioning, with other crimes and abuses of the Bolshevists, the\r\nsocialization of women.\r\n\r\nA press despatch dated Warsaw, April 10, 1919, stated the following\r\nconcerning the condition of women in Russia:\r\n\r\n     \"The nationalization of women is becoming quite general. The\r\n     Bolsheviki have declared war on family life and consideration for\r\n     one another's mother or sister is forbidden. All must be treated\r\n     alike. The most terrible thing is that the women themselves have\r\n     accepted this nationalization and very little protest is made. This\r\n     applies to every class. In certain cases, however, a hitch has\r\n     occurred. Even Bolshevism cannot master human nature, and it has\r\n     been found that a masculine jealousy occasionally stands in a way.\r\n     Certain men have refused to nationalize a particular woman and as a\r\n     result Bolshevik has fought Bolshevik with considerable force.\"\r\n\r\nAn Associated Press despatch from London, April 15, 1919, gives lengthy\r\ndetails regarding the nationalization of women, and even the opposition\r\noffered to it:\r\n\r\n     \"The law providing for the nationalization of women in Northeast\r\n     Russia has been suspended in one province as a result of popular\r\n     outcry, according to information reaching London today, from\r\n     Stockholm.\r\n\r\n     \"The Commissary of Vladimir has, by decree, appointed a committee\r\n     of women, who are to inquire into operations of the law and make a\r\n     report with the least possible delay. His action has been approved\r\n     by the local Soviet.\r\n\r\n     \"'The Krasnaya Gazeta' publishes an account of the results of\r\n     nationalization. The system provides that every girl on reaching\r\n     the age of eighteen must register her name in the Bureau of Free\r\n     Love, after which she is compelled to select a partner from among\r\n     men between the ages of 19 and 50 years old. The law led to\r\n     lamentable confusion, says the 'Gazeta,' in judicial notions as to\r\n     personal inviolability.\r\n\r\n     \"A few days after the Soviet's decree, which women very generally\r\n     ignored, two men known to nobody, arrived in the town and seized\r\n     the two daughters of a well-known non-bourgeois comrade, declaring\r\n     they had chosen them as wives and that the girls without further\r\n     ceremony must submit, as they had not observed the registration\r\n     rule.\r\n\r\n     \"Comrades Yablonovski and Guriakin, who sat as judges on the claim,\r\n     decided that the men were right, and the girls were carried off.\r\n     They have not been heard of since by the village folk.\r\n\r\n     \"This, says the Gazeta, was done in the name of the nationalization\r\n     of women.\r\n\r\n     \"Many other instances of the fantastic operation of the law, not to\r\n     speak of its inhumanities, are cited by the Gazeta. Enthusiasts for\r\n     nationalization, naturally all males, raid whole villages, seize\r\n     young girls, and demand proof that they are not over 18. As this\r\n     proof is difficult to give, many of the girls are carried off, and\r\n     there have been suicides and murders as a result.\r\n\r\n     \"In the town of Kovrov, a campaign without parallel since the\r\n     Trojan war was waged between the vengeful relatives of an abducted\r\n     nationalized girl and her persecutors.\r\n\r\n     \"In this town the 'register of nationalized women' was opened on\r\n     December 1, but up to February 1 last only two women, both over 40,\r\n     and neither of whom had ever been married, registered themselves as\r\n     willing to accept the first husband the state sent along.\r\n\r\n     \"On the committee which is now to revise the nationalization decree\r\n     or to recommend its complete abrogation sits Mme. Vera Arkadieff, a\r\n     Bolshevist enthusiast, who commanded a detachment of women soldiers\r\n     during the recent operations against Admiral Kolchak's army at\r\n     Perm. She has been twice wounded.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Krasnaya Gazeta,\" translated, means the Red Gazette. It is a\r\nBolshevist newspaper published in Petrograd. The following \"Special\r\nCable\" to \"The New York Times,\" dated Milan, April 24, 1919, published\r\nApril 26, 1919, gives a Bolshevist's explanation of the Russian sex\r\nlegislation:\r\n\r\n     \"A Bolshevist statesman, from whom the 'Journal Epoca' obtained a\r\n     special interview respecting the Leninist legislation on the sex\r\n     problem, complains that a vast amount of grotesque\r\n     misrepresentation has appeared on the subject in the hostile or\r\n     unsympathetic press.\r\n\r\n     \"'Abolition of celibacy has been adopted,' he stated, 'simply as a\r\n     means toward class equality. Every woman, on attaining her\r\n     eighteenth and every man on his twentieth year, is bound to\r\n     inscribe his or her name in a special register kept at the\r\n     Commissariat of Unions, and must then contract a union within the\r\n     period of six months. Should they fail to do so, they are served\r\n     with three warning notices at successive intervals of two months,\r\n     before any step is taken in the way of coercive measures. Every\r\n     bachelor and every spinster is bound to furnish a written\r\n     explanation of their irregular condition, and the only reasons\r\n     admitted as valid are serious ill-health or organic defects.\r\n\r\n     \"'When two lovers wish to marry they present themselves to the\r\n     People's Commissary, who witnesses their marriage. The same course\r\n     is followed as regards separating, only that the Commissary, after\r\n     freeing the unhappy pair, inscribes the man afresh on the celibate\r\n     list and the woman on the register of marriageable persons,\r\n     notifying each of the obligation to find another partner within six\r\n     months. In case children have been born from their union, they are\r\n     either delivered to the custody of the particular parent desiring\r\n     them or else divided between them. The Commissariat of Unions aids\r\n     the youth of either sex in their quest of a mate by promoting all\r\n     healthy forms of social intercourse and facilitating introductions\r\n     among families of every type.'\"\r\n\r\nThe above despatch was published in the April 26, 1919, issue of \"The\r\nNew York Times.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 28, 1919, the following very apt comment was made on it and\r\nappeared on the editorial page of the \"New York Times\":\r\n\r\n     \"As explained by somebody whom a Milan paper calls a 'Bolshevist\r\n     statesman,' marriage as regulated by the great and good Lenine is\r\n     not at all the dreadful thing described recently by the mendacious\r\n     enemies of his Socialistic paradise. As pictured by his friends,\r\n     nothing worse has been done than to exert a gentle pressure on the\r\n     marriageable unmarried to the end that they may do their duty to\r\n     the Bolshevist State and provide it as soon as may be with new sons\r\n     and daughters to take the place of those recently 'removed' by a\r\n     benevolent terrorism.\r\n\r\n     \"Bachelorhood and spinsterhood are to be regarded as\r\n     'irregular'--conditions that must be explained in writing to the\r\n     proper authorities. For the well disposed a simple civil marriage\r\n     ceremony is provided; also a simple divorce ceremony in case the\r\n     union proves wearisome. And that is all there is to the Bolshevist\r\n     marriage system, the statesman says.\r\n\r\n     \"But one notices that he does not disclose what is done to those\r\n     who fail to find pleasing mates in the six months allowed after\r\n     notification for the making of a choice. Apparently it is then that\r\n     the so-called nationalization of women comes in, and the statesman\r\n     forgot to say a word about the only peculiarity of the system that\r\n     has evolved any serious criticism.\"\r\n\r\nCommenting on Bolshevism, Mr. Eber Cole Byam, in the April 26, 1919,\r\nissue of \"America,\" very aptly says:\r\n\r\n     \"As the Roman world was reduced to barbarism by the barbarians so\r\n     now the modern world is threatened with reduction to Bolshevism by\r\n     the Bolsheviki. Whatever the word Bolshevism may have meant\r\n     originally it has come to mean fiendish treatment of women, the\r\n     savage murder and mutilation of men and the wanton destruction of\r\n     the accumulated labors of generations. The Bolshevik is a\r\n     Socialist, not the armchair theorist dreaming fantastic fancies.\r\n     The Bolshevik is the real Socialist, the Socialist of practice.\"\r\n\r\nThe following encomium on Bolshevism appeared in \"The Call,\" New York,\r\nApril 26, 1919, and shows what strange inclinations the Socialists have\r\ntowards barbarism:\r\n\r\n     \"For the first time in Russia's history law has been established\r\n     based on the direct will of the population, established through the\r\n     most democratic franchise in the world. Under Czarism, law was\r\n     merely the promulgation of autocratic tyranny....\r\n\r\n     \"For the first time in Russia's history, perfect freedom of\r\n     religion is guaranteed to Christian, Moslem and Jew alike. After\r\n     the American pattern, no church may control the state....\r\n\r\n     \"For the first time, millions of Russian workers and peasants find\r\n     themselves with decent homes. For the first time, women have equal\r\n     social rights with men. For the first time, a real educational\r\n     system has been inaugurated for the children....\r\n\r\n     \"The recent official American investigators sent to Russia found a\r\n     great change in the life of the cities from of old. They described\r\n     the life as puritanical. Russians explained the change to them by\r\n     the fact that vice and debauchery had been confined mostly to the\r\n     idle ruling class, the old aristocracy, and these things had passed\r\n     with the passing of that class.\"\r\n\r\nListen now to the words of the Russian Socialist author, Leonoid\r\nAndréiev, who has seen quite enough of the \"blessings\" of Bolshevism.\r\nThey appear in the April 26, 1919, issue of \"Struggling Russia,\" under\r\nthe caption, \"S. O. S., An Appeal to Humanity\":\r\n\r\n     \"One must, indeed, be insane not to understand the palpable and\r\n     simple acts of Bolshevism! One must be sightless, stark-blind or\r\n     have eyes that see not, to fail to observe on the face of the great\r\n     mutilated Russia murder without end, ruins, miles of cemeteries,\r\n     dungeons and insane asylums; not to perceive what hunger and terror\r\n     have done to Petrograd, and, alas, to many other cities!\r\n\r\n     \"One must be earless, stone-deaf, or have ears that hear not, to\r\n     remain callous to the sobs, the sighs and the wailing of women, the\r\n     heart-rending cries of the children, the death-rattle of strangled\r\n     men, the cracking of the assassins' rifles, the only music that has\r\n     filled the air of Russia for the last eighteen months!...\r\n\r\n     \"As the wireless operator on a sinking vessel, in the thick\r\n     blackness of the night, sends out his last appeal, 'Help, quick, we\r\n     are sinking, save us!' so I, moved by my faith in the goodness of\r\n     man, am sending out into distance and darkness my prayer for my\r\n     people who are sinking.\r\n\r\n     \"If you only knew how dark is the night around us, if my words\r\n     could only convey its density and depth! Whom am I calling? I know\r\n     not. Does the wireless operator know who may intercept his call?\r\n     For thousands of miles around the ocean may be deserted and not a\r\n     living soul may overhear his appeal.\r\n\r\n     \"The night is dark. The sea is frightful. But the operator has not\r\n     lost his faith, and he calls persistently, to the very last minute,\r\n     until the last light is gone and his apparatus is silenced forever.\r\n\r\n     \"What does he trust in? He trusts in humanity, and so do I. He\r\n     trusts in the law of human love and life. It is impossible that one\r\n     human being will deny help to another in his hour of perdition. It\r\n     is impossible that one human being will abandon another to perish\r\n     without attempting to help. It is impossible that such an appeal\r\n     for help will not receive any response!...\r\n\r\n     \"Friend! I do not even attempt to tell you how frightful life is in\r\n     Russia at present, in our tormented Petrograd. Others have told\r\n     enough, and new words cannot be coined by the human tongue.\r\n\r\n     \"It is frightful when children starve and perish, and assassins are\r\n     well-fed and Trotzky is pouring down his throat the last bottle of\r\n     milk. It is frightful when the cemeteries of Petrograd have no more\r\n     room for the dead, and the murderers have a free road not only to\r\n     the Princess Islands, but to all the ends of the world, and the\r\n     wealth they have stolen will enable them to live in balmy lands and\r\n     in the most attractive corners of our mercenary globe.\"\r\n\r\nCatherine Breshkovsky, the Socialist \"Grandmother of the Russian\r\nRevolution,\" though now an aged woman, lived long enough to bewail the\r\nfate of her country. Speaking of her native land, now reaping the\r\nharvest from the Marxian seed first sown many years ago, she says in her\r\n\"Message to the American People\":\r\n\r\n     \"Flooded with tears and blood, Russia moans and cries out to the\r\n     world. She is a living body, and her tortures cannot be looked upon\r\n     cold-bloodedly as an extraordinary, never-before-witnessed\r\n     experiments in social evolution. She is alive and every pore of her\r\n     body is shedding blood.\"\r\n\r\nLet the \"scientific\" American Socialists continue to take their\r\ninformation from \"The Call.\" They are far too learned to be deceived by\r\nRussians such as Andréiev or the \"Grandmother of the Russian\r\nRevolution.\" \"The capitalist press is lying about the conditions in\r\nRussia.\" \"The Call\" alone speaks the truth, for it is a proletarian\r\nsheet.\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with ruining his own country, Lenine would have Bolshevism\r\nspread to all other nations. He longs for their workingmen to rise in\r\nrevolt against their present systems of government. Listen to his words\r\nin his \"Letter to American Workingmen,\" published by the Socialist\r\nPublication Society, 431 Pulaski street, Brooklyn, New York:\r\n\r\n     \"We know that it may take a long time before help can come from\r\n     you, Comrades, American Workingmen, for the development of the\r\n     revolution in the different countries proceeds along various paths,\r\n     with various rapidity (how could it be otherwise!) We know full\r\n     well that the outbreak of the European proletarian revolution may\r\n     take many weeks to come, quickly as it is ripening in these days.\r\n     We are counting on the inevitability of the international\r\n     revolution. But that does not mean that we count on its coming at\r\n     some definite date. We have experienced two great revolutions in\r\n     our own country, that of 1905 and that of 1917, and we know that\r\n     revolutions cannot come either at word of command nor according to\r\n     prearranged plans. We know that circumstances alone have pushed us,\r\n     the proletariat of Russia, forward, that we have reached this new\r\n     stage in the social life of the world not because of our\r\n     superiority but because of the peculiarly reactionary character of\r\n     Russia. But until the outbreak of the international revolution,\r\n     revolutions in individual countries may still meet with a number of\r\n     setbacks and serious overthrows....\r\n\r\n     \"We are in a beleaguered fortress, so long as no other\r\n     international Socialist revolution comes to our assistance with its\r\n     armies. But these armies exist, they are stronger than ours, they\r\n     grow, they strive, they become more invincible the longer\r\n     imperialism, with its brutalities, continues. Workingmen the world\r\n     over are breaking with their betrayers, with their Gompers and\r\n     their Scheidemanns. Inevitably labor is approaching communistic\r\n     Bolshevistic tactics, is preparing for the proletarian revolution\r\n     that alone is capable of preserving culture and humanity from\r\n     destruction. We are invincible, for invincible is the Proletarian\r\n     Revolution.\"\r\n\r\nThe above words of the dictator Lenine may throw some light on the\r\nSocialists' demand for \"justice\" to Russia, and their campaign in behalf\r\nof the recognition of the Soviet Government of that country.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Publication Society of Brooklyn at the end of the World\r\nWar issued a large pamphlet entitled, \"One Year of Revolution,\"\r\ncelebrating the first anniversary of the founding of the Russian Soviet\r\nRepublic. On the cover page, under the caption, \"The Spirit of\r\nRevolutionary Russia,\" and the subtitle, \"To the Oppressed of All\r\nCountries,\" we read the summons to a Socialist world-wide revolution:\r\n\r\n     \"And this life and death struggle with our own oppressors gives us\r\n     the right to appeal to you, proletarians of all countries, with a\r\n     strong voice, with the voice of those who look into the eyes of\r\n     death in the revolt against the exploiters.\r\n\r\n     \"Break the chains, you who are oppressed!

An Associated Press\r\ndispatch, dated Vienna, April 24, 1919, shows how the Bolshevists\r\ncarried on their campaign in the Ukraine:\r\n\r\n     \"The Bolsheviki penetrated the country in four sections. First came\r\n     agitators and next marauding bands to strike terror. These were\r\n     followed by larger bodies of troops, made up of foreign elements.\r\n     Last came Soviet troops, headed by Bolshevist commissioners. Iron\r\n     discipline was maintained by Chinese assassins, who executed all\r\n     soldiers who revolted against orders.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 26, 1919, the \"New York Times\" announced that a Bolshevist weekly\r\npaper would be issued in that city:\r\n\r\n     \"Nicholai Lenine, the Premier, and Leon Trotzky, the Minister of\r\n     War, together with other officials of the Russian Bolshevist\r\n     Government, will begin next Monday the publication in this city of\r\n     a sixteen page weekly newspaper, the purpose of which will be to\r\n     spread propaganda favorable to the Bolsheviki. This announcement is\r\n     made in today's issue of the propaganda sheet issued weekly from\r\n     the headquarters of Ludwig C. A. K. Martens, the unrecognized\r\n     'Bolshevist Ambassador' to the United States. The paper is to be\r\n     known as 'Soviet Russia.'\"\r\n\r\n     \"'Every friend of Russia, as well as every person interested in\r\n     international affairs,' says the announcement, 'will subscribe to\r\n     this weekly.' 'Soviet Russia' will contain news items, editorials,\r\n     original articles, and unpublished documents.\"\r\n\r\nThe American Socialist Party acknowledges the Bolshevist regime of\r\nmurder and starvation to be a Socialist regime and states that it\r\nupholds the lofty, international proletarian ideals. Debs and the\r\nAmerican Socialist press, at the present writing, acknowledge the\r\nBolsheviki to be real Socialists, not reactionaries or Socialists merely\r\nin name, like the Ebert-Scheidemann group in Germany. They want\r\nBolshevism in America. They welcome it, laud it, love it. At least this\r\nis the case just now. Will they presently be offering arguments to prove\r\nthat the Bolshevists were not Socialists at all, but traitors to the\r\nwhole Marxian movement? Meantime the American Socialists spread all\r\nkinds of lies about the \"wonders\" of the Soviet Government while\r\nclaiming that \"the press\" is lying about the Lenine system to save the\r\ncapitalists from the demands of the laboring class.\r\n\r\nLet us sincerely hope that no more Bolshevists from Russia will land on\r\nour shores. We have enough rebellious, hypocritical Reds here already,\r\nand need no more of them to teach us how to run our government. Congress\r\nshould pass strict laws allowing no immigrants to land here who are\r\nBolshevists.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped, too, that the leaders of the Illinois Labor Party who\r\nsecured the adoption in their platform of a pro-Soviet plank in the\r\nspring of 1919 will take a few hours off and learn something about the\r\nRussian system before trying to \"work it off\" on our country.\r\n\r\nThere has been a great deal of \"pussy-footing\" talk in the American\r\npress about Bolshevism and Socialism, implying that there is no\r\nconnection between the two. Yet Bolshevism is nothing but a form of\r\nSocialism. It is Socialism applied, though not yet as completely applied\r\nas the teachings of Karl Marx require. If an incomplete application of\r\nthe principles of Socialism reduces a country to such an awful condition\r\nas Russia reveals, what may be expected from the full dose of Socialism?\r\n\r\nAt the last moment, with this book in type, a cry from the Bolshevik\r\ndictatorship comes out of Russia through interviews given by Lenine and\r\nTrotzky to the \"New York World's\" European correspondent, Lincoln Eyre.\r\n\"I had an hour's talk with Lenine in the Kremlin at Moscow,\" Eyre writes\r\nin a dispatch headed, \"Riga (by courier to Berlin), Feb. 20, 1920,\" and\r\nprinted in the \"World\" of February 21, 1920. Lenine turned the interview\r\ninto an argument for the lifting of the Allied blockade of Russia, and\r\ngave more than a hint that Russia's economic condition is desperate.\r\nAccording to Mr. Eyre's cable to the \"New York World\" of February 21,\r\n1920, Lenine said, speaking in English:\r\n\r\n     \"Russia's present economic distress is simply a part of the world's\r\n     economic distress. Until the economic problem is faced from a world\r\n     standpoint and not merely from the standpoint of certain nations or\r\n     groups of nations, a solution is impossible.... Not only Russia but\r\n     all Europe is going to pieces, and the [Allied] Supreme Council\r\n     still indulges in tergiversation. Russia can be saved from utter\r\n     ruin and Europe, too, but it must be done soon and quickly.\"\r\n\r\nBy insinuating that \"all Europe is going to pieces\" with Russia, and\r\nfaces the same \"utter ruin,\" Lenine covers his plea for Russia under an\r\nappeal to the self-interest of other nations. Yet his confession that\r\nRussia is \"going to pieces\" and trembles on the brink of \"utter ruin\" is\r\nplain enough, making his whole argument a cry to the \"capitalistic\"\r\nnations to help Socialistic Russia. Indeed, in other parts of the same\r\ninterview, as reported by Mr. Eyre in the \"World\" of February 21, 1920,\r\nLenine appeals to \"foreign capital\" and the \"capitalistic countries\" in\r\nthe baldest terms, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"We have reiterated and reiterated our desire for peace, our need\r\n     for peace and our readiness to give foreign capital the most\r\n     generous concessions and guarantees.... I know of no reason why a\r\n     Socialistic commonwealth like ours cannot do business indefinitely\r\n     with capitalistic countries. We don't mind taking their\r\n     capitalistic locomotives and farming machinery, so why should they\r\n     mind taking our Socialistic wheat, flax and platinum?\"\r\n\r\nHaving waded through blood and violence to exterminate \"capitalism\" and\r\ncancel all \"concessions\" and \"guarantees\" in Russia, has \"the\r\ndictatorship of the proletariat\" emerged out of its nightmare of\r\ndestruction simply to coax \"foreign capital\" back into Socialistic\r\nRussia by bribing offers of \"the most generous concessions and\r\nguarantees?\" After two years of a reign of terror to make an earthly\r\nparadise by destroying \"capitalism\" and the whole machinery of\r\n\"capitalistic countries,\" this hungry reaching out by Lenine after\r\n\"capital\" and \"capitalistic\" things is almost too ludicrous for belief!\r\n\r\nEyre's interview with Trotzky, sent from \"Riga (by courier to Berlin,\r\nFeb. 23)\" and printed in the \"New York World\" of February 25, 1920,\r\nsimply reenforces Lenine's appeal to \"foreign capital\" and the wicked\r\n\"capitalistic countries.\" According to Eyre in the \"World\" of February\r\n25, Trotzky spoke of \"Russia, bankrupt, bleeding and starved,\" and said\r\nin part:\r\n\r\n     \"Our military successes have not blinded us to our need of peace.\r\n     We require peace for the re-establishment of economic\r\n     stabilization.... We have had to sacrifice the welfare of our\r\n     people and the health of future generations to the desperate needs\r\n     of the hour.\"\r\n\r\nAnd for what? Apparently only to substitute the autocracy of a new\r\nproletarian aristocracy for the autocracy of the old regime, and the\r\nczardom of Lenine and Trotzky for that of the Romanoffs. And the new\r\ntyranny not only re-establishes the old partnership between \"capital\"\r\nand labor, but puts the burden of militarism on labor more exclusively\r\nthan before. This seems to be the program of Trotzky, \"the People's\r\nCommissary for Military Affairs,\" according to Eyre's report of\r\nTrotzky's words in the \"New York World\" of February 25, 1920. His words\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"We recognize our need for outside aid in setting this country on\r\n     its feet industrially and economically. It is a tremendous\r\n     enterprise, one that will take two, five, perhaps ten years to\r\n     carry out, but through the indomitable spirit of our proletariat it\r\n     will be accomplished with a speed and competency that will amaze\r\n     our foemen.... And once again I say that the people who help us\r\n     gain peace will share in the profits, the very considerable\r\n     profits, resultant from the aid they will have extended to us....\r\n\r\n     \"Foreign capitalists who invest their money in Russian enterprises\r\n     or who supply us with merchandise we require will receive material\r\n     guarantees of amply adequate character. They need have no fears on\r\n     that score.... It is obvious that we must look to the victorious\r\n     nations, to Great Britain or, still better, to America for\r\n     machinery, agricultural tools and other imports which Russia's\r\n     economic renaissance demands.\"\r\n\r\nThus the old partnership of capital and labor is to be resumed. But what\r\nof the Russian workers? Having fought and toiled to put Lenine and\r\nTrotzky on the proletarian throne they must keep up military training to\r\nkeep them there, and must toil hard to produce \"the very considerable\r\nprofits\" which Lenine and Trotzky are going to share with the \"foreign\r\ncapitalists\" who help them. But let Trotzky explain the destiny of the\r\nRussian workers in his own words, as reported by Eyre in the \"World\" of\r\nFebruary 25, 1920:\r\n\r\n     \"The workers and peasants will insist, once the revolution is no\r\n     longer in peril, on returning to their factories and farms and\r\n     making Russia a fit land to live in. Frontier guards will be\r\n     maintained, of course. The framework of our (military) organization\r\n     must also be preserved in order that with the experience they have\r\n     received in the past eighteen months our proletarian fighting men\r\n     can be remodelled in two or three months if the need arises. There\r\n     will also be some form of military training for the working class,\r\n     that it may always be ready to defend itself against the\r\n     bourgeoisie.\"\r\n\r\nWill not this be \"militarism?\" Of course not; for, in Trotzky's words in\r\nthe same interview, \"Militarism, striking as it does at the very roots\r\nof Communism, cannot possibly exist in Soviet Russia, the only truly\r\npacific country in the world!\" Thus facts disappear behind words.\r\nConscription was militaristic under the Czar, but it cannot be under a\r\nTrotzky, for he has labeled his system a Soviet Republic and since\r\nSoviets are never military their military arrangements, though\r\napparently more severe than the other kind, are really only a form of\r\npacifism! Thus the happy Russian workers must serve as \"frontier\r\nguards,\" keep up the framework of their military organization, and\r\nsubmit to \"some form of military training,\" but may whistle as they\r\ngroan, knowing that the yoke they bear \"cannot exist.\"\r\n\r\nOther contradictions in these interviews will be discussed later in this\r\nbook. For example, we shall find, in Chapter XVI, that the Soviet\r\nRepublic at Moscow can make peace with \"capitalistic countries\" and form\r\npartnerships with \"foreign capital\" while at the same time the Third\r\nInternational at Moscow carries on a world-wide conspiracy to destroy\r\n\"capitalism\" and overthrow the governments and institutions of\r\n\"capitalistic countries.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN SPARTACIDES AND COMMUNISTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Berlin, shortly after the Revolution against the Imperial Government,\r\nKarl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg and their group of Socialists of the\r\nextreme Left were raising a merry riot almost every day in the hope of\r\novercoming the ultra-conservative Socialist government and introducing\r\nthe radical Bolshevist program. The constant disorder occasioned by\r\nthese Spartacans or Spartacides of the Left provoked the opposition\r\nparties very much, annoying them to such an extent that many Germans\r\nwished to remove the capital of the country from Berlin to some more\r\norderly city.\r\n\r\nThe name \"Spartacides\" or \"Spartacans\" came from the fact that early in\r\nthe World War Karl Liebknecht, their leader, issued a number of anti-war\r\npamphlets bearing the pseudonym, \"Spartacus.\"\r\n\r\nThe Spartacides are the reddest of the Reds, the real Socialists of\r\nGermany. They differ very much from the Ebert-Scheidemann group, for the\r\nSpartacans want the principles of Socialism applied immediately, whereas\r\nEbert and other members of his government warned their followers that\r\nthough they held Socialist theories, the application of Socialism must\r\nbe postponed to the distant future. The Ebert-Scheidemann Majority\r\nSocialists are regarded by the others as Socialists only in name, being\r\nreally social reformers, or, at the most, weak-kneed Socialists who\r\nsought power, but fully realized that the application of the Marxian\r\nprinciples would be doomed to absolute failure. The Spartacans, however,\r\nstill have confidence in Socialism; they agree heart and soul with the\r\nRussian Bolsheviki; they are the rowdies and ruffians of Germany, always\r\nlooking for trouble. Strikes, riots and civil discord are their weapons,\r\nand the American Socialists are among their particular friends. Indeed,\r\nthe Socialist Party of Eugene V. Debs has no use whatever for the\r\nEbert-Scheidemann group, who are looked upon as reactionaries,\r\nhypocrites, murderers and traitors to Socialism.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of 1918, the Berlin correspondent of the \"Kölnische\r\nZeitung\" drew a graphic picture of the terrorism exercised in Berlin by\r\nthe Spartacan gangs:\r\n\r\n     \"Dr. Liebknecht himself, whose imprisonment has obviously clouded\r\n     his formerly keen intelligence and probably turned his brain,\r\n     spends his time in visiting barracks in Berlin, Spandau and\r\n     elsewhere, and inciting the men to refuse to allow any distinctions\r\n     even of non-commissioned rank or to accept anything resembling\r\n     orders from officers or to admit them to the local councils. His\r\n     chief of staff, Dr. Levy, who before the war was his business\r\n     partner in his law office, is preaching fanaticism in Berlin to all\r\n     and sundry.\r\n\r\n     \"The word Spartacus goes through the city like a bogy. Civilians,\r\n     soldiers, employees, capitalists, all feel themselves equally\r\n     threatened. A sitting of the Prussian Lower House had to be\r\n     adjourned because it was feared that the Spartacus gang was going\r\n     to seize the building.\r\n\r\n     \"'The Lokal Anzeiger' has several times failed to appear, as the\r\n     result of repeated efforts of the Spartacus gang to seize it.\r\n     Careful burghers chain up the house doors, and it would be well if\r\n     the steadier elements of our workmen and soldiers would chain up\r\n     the door of their hearts against the murderous and suicidal ideas\r\n     of the Spartacus gang.\"\r\n\r\nThe Spartacides made a practice of terrorizing German newspapers into\r\nsupporting them. In the early part of 1919, they tried to prevent the\r\nConstituent Assembly from coming together, and later on engineered many\r\na revolt in the various cities of Germany. Since their leaders, the\r\nfiery Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, were assassinated, the orderly\r\nelements of the German people have succeeded more and more in weakening\r\nthe power and influence of the Spartacans.\r\n\r\nKurt Eisner, of Bavaria, after the overthrow of the German Imperial\r\nGovernment, sought to establish a federation of German republics under\r\nthe head of Bavaria. It was not very long before the first step was\r\ntaken, Bavaria declaring itself a republic independent of the Berlin\r\nGovernment. After the assassination of Eisner, Bavaria, and especially\r\nits capital, Munich, came more and more under the control of the extreme\r\nradical group of Socialists known as the Communists. About the end of\r\nMarch, 1919, Bela Kun, the Foreign Minister of the newly established\r\nCommunist Government of Hungary and one of the most active propagandists\r\nof Russian Bolshevism, arrived at Munich to confer with the leaders of\r\nthe Bavarian Government. Shortly afterwards, in the early part of\r\nApril, a Soviet Republic was proclaimed at Munich.\r\n\r\nThe socialization of industry began. That part of the press that favored\r\nthe new regime was upheld by the Government, which suppressed unfriendly\r\norgans. Members of the Christian Textile Workers' Association were\r\nforced, on pain of being deprived of work, to join the Social-Democratic\r\nUnion. Various other measures of \"freedom, equality, and justice\" were\r\nalso bestowed upon the people, and the hope was expressed by the Red\r\nSocialists of Munich that the proclamation of a Bavarian Soviet would\r\nhave its effect throughout Germany and result in a world revolution.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of April, 1919, press dispatches stated that the\r\nMunich Communists had elected a council, consisting of five workmen and\r\nfive soldiers, with Herr Klatz, a bricklayer, as president; that the\r\npolice was disarmed; that eleven hostages were taken from the ranks of\r\nthe trade-union leaders; that revolutionary tribunals were established\r\nat Munich, where twenty-eight judges continued, in relays of seven, to\r\npass sentences day and night, and, finally, that a decree was issued by\r\nthe Communist government confiscating all dwellings.\r\n\r\nShortly after these reports reached America, the peasants of Bavaria\r\nrose up against the revolutionary government in Munich and declared an\r\neffective ban on the shipment of food to that city. No attacks were made\r\nupon Munich by the troops of the moderate Hoffman government of Bavaria\r\nwhich had been ousted by the Communists, for it was feared that the\r\nwhole country might thus be plunged into civil war. The only strategic\r\nmovement of these troops was to cut off the supplies of food.\r\n\r\nDiscord soon sprang up among the Soviet leaders themselves, who engaged\r\nin open street fights against each other. Before the end of April, 1919,\r\nthe Central Council had been dissolved and the Communist mob had turned\r\nto plundering. Food ration cards were taken away from the bourgeoisie,\r\nand barricades were erected around the city to defend it from Noske's\r\narmy, sent to attack it by the Ebert-Scheidemann moderate Socialist\r\nGovernment of Berlin. In the early part of May, 1919, the Communist\r\nrabble of the Bavarian capital was finally overcome by the artillery\r\nfire of Noske's troops, and Hoffman was once more put in control.\r\n\r\nThe American Socialists look upon the ousted Communists of Bavaria as\r\nthe upholders of the Marxian doctrine, and consider them, along with\r\nthe Russian Bolsheviki and the Hungarian Communists, as Socialist\r\nbrethren worthy of their respect and imitation.\r\n\r\nIn Hungary the \"100 per cent\" Socialists, the Communists, under the\r\nleadership of Bela Kun, came into power in the early part of the year\r\n1919. Press despatches, at the end of March, stated that all villas,\r\nindustries and building had been declared the property of the state;\r\nthat each factory was controlled by a Council of Laborers; that\r\nfree-love was legalized as in Russia; that all clergymen and nuns were\r\nremoved from the hospitals, excepting those who acted in the capacity of\r\nnurses, and the religious, tuition schools were abolished.\r\n\r\nA press dispatch dated Buda-Pest, April 4, 1919, said that \"in\r\nTransylvania, following the practice in Moscow, the churches have been\r\nconverted into music halls, the best seats being reserved for the\r\nproletariat. The government officials do not pay house rent and have\r\npriority on foodstuffs and clothing.\"\r\n\r\nThe American Socialists boasted about the absence of bloodshed in\r\nHungary during the early part of Bela Kun's regime. Whether or not he\r\nhad been cautioned by Lenine not to wear out too many rifles in the\r\nbeginning, lest there be a dearth later on, we do not know. At any rate,\r\nby the latter part of May, 1919, the Hungarian Communists also began to\r\nmanifest their true color. They were not satisfied with \"painting\r\neverything red\" in Buda-Pest, but also wanted to see red blood flowing\r\nin the gutters. In confirmation of this we have the following Associated\r\nPress report, dated Vienna, May 20, but not appearing in the \"New York\r\nTimes\" till May 23:\r\n\r\n     \"Many persons accused of being counter-revolutionists are being\r\n     executed by the Hungarian Communists, according to despatches\r\n     received here. The victims are usually shot in front of the\r\n     Hungarian Parliament House in the daytime or in the school-yard in\r\n     the Markostrasse at night.\r\n\r\n     \"Among those who are said to have been executed are Herr Holan,\r\n     manager of the Kaschau-Oderberg Railway; Bishop Balthasar, a\r\n     hostage from Debreczen, and Colonel Dormany of the General Staff,\r\n     who was taken from a hospital. Several girls, who were accused of\r\n     making tri-color rosettes for the counter-revolutionists, also were\r\n     executed. The presiding Judge of the Revolutionary tribunal, which\r\n     orders the executions, it is said, is a former locksmith, 22 years\r\n     of age.\r\n\r\n     \"Many bodies of men and women and girls of the better classes have\r\n     been found on the shores of islands in the Danube below the city.\r\n     It is reported that they were arrested in the residential quarter\r\n     of Buda and thrown into the Danube by guards who were taking them\r\n     to prisons in Pest.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1919 the Hungarian Communists lost control of the\r\ncountry. Not only had internal dissensions broken out at home, but they\r\nhad been attacked for a long time by the Rumanians, who had caused them\r\nendless trouble. If they had succeeded in remaining in power long\r\nenough, they would, no doubt, in time have shown themselves proficient\r\nin murdering their fellow-countrymen and as skilled in the use of the\r\nrifle as the Bolsheviki in Russia, the Spartacides in Germany and the\r\nCommunists in Bavaria. These four groups of European Socialists of the\r\nextreme Left--ruffians, brutes, murderous thugs, half barbarous savages,\r\nslayers even of their own Socialist brethren--have long been in a\r\n\"position\" to teach the \"gentle art\" of plunder and murder to their\r\nadmiring comrades on this side of the Atlantic, that \"poor,\"\r\n\"persecuted,\" \"workingman,\" Eugene V. Debs, and his crowd of \"honest,\"\r\n\"scientific,\" \"evolutionists.\"\r\n\r\nWith these European thugs Berger and Hillquit deliberately \"lined up\"\r\nthe Socialist Party of America in the words of their Chicago manifesto\r\nof September 4, 1919:\r\n\r\n     \"The Socialist Party of the United States at its first national\r\n     convention after the war, squarely takes its position with the\r\n     uncompromising section of the international Socialist Movement. We\r\n     unreservedly reject the policy of those Socialists who supported\r\n     their belligerent capitalist governments on the plea of 'national\r\n     defense,'\" etc.\r\n\r\nThere is no breath of patriotism in these dogs.\r\n\r\nThe above \"line up\" was confirmed by the rank and file of the Socialist\r\nParty of America in their referendum vote identifying their party with\r\nthe Revolutionary Third (Moscow) International. (See Chapters V and\r\nXVI.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE BOLSHEVISM OF AMERICAN SOCIALISTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo accuse American Socialists of conspiring against our fair land may at\r\nfirst startle the reader. Brand as traitors to the common welfare men\r\nwho boast so loudly of being the only friends of the oppressed laborer!\r\nCall the followers of Karl Marx the enemies of our country after they\r\nhave lavished so much precious time on exposures of those who defraud\r\nAmerican workingmen of an honest wage! Yet, as our investigation moves\r\nalong, telling evidence uncovers the existence of an alarmingly\r\nwidespread conspiracy.\r\n\r\nOur Chapters VIII and IX have clearly revealed the I. W. W. as a purely\r\nrevolutionary organization, enrolling under its red flag discontented\r\nworkingmen, even negroes and Chinese, pledged to overthrow our\r\nGovernment, while meanwhile, with anarchistic contempt for law and\r\nmorality, they do what damage they can through strikes and sabotage.\r\n\r\nThe same chapters proved that the Socialists are co-operating heart and\r\nsoul with the Industrial Workers of the World.\r\n\r\nChapters X, XI and XII gave the reader evidence of some of the terrible\r\nresults of Bolshevism in Russia, Communism in Hungary and Bavaria, and\r\nSpartacism in Germany. Yet far from being dismayed by these horrors, the\r\nSocialists of the United States proclaim themselves of the same breed as\r\nthe Bolshevists, Communists and Spartacans abroad, whose torch of\r\nincendiarism they would apply to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Party of Buffalo, New York, published a pink booklet\r\nentitled, \"The Truth About Russia,\" in which reference is made to the\r\nRussian call to a world-wide Socialist revolution. On page 41, at the\r\nconclusion of the articles of the Bolshevik Constitution concerning\r\nrights and duties, we read:\r\n\r\n     \"In proclaiming these rights and duties the Russian Socialist\r\n     Republic of the Soviets calls upon the working classes of the\r\n     entire world to accomplish their task to the very end, and in the\r\n     faith that the Socialist ideal will soon be achieved to write upon\r\n     their flags the old battle cry of the working people:\r\n\r\n     \"'Proletarians of all lands, unite!\r\n\r\n     \"'Long live the Socialistic world revolution!'\"\r\n\r\nThe plan is for Socialists in countries outside of Russia to be helped\r\nin their revolts against their governments by their Bolshevist comrades.\r\nIn the \"Labor Scrap Book,\" published by Chas. H. Kerr and Co., there is\r\na long article by Nicholas Lenine, the Russian dictator. Several\r\nquotations are here given:\r\n\r\n     \"Russia's revolution is not a domestic revolution, but essentially\r\n     a world revolution....\r\n\r\n     \"The Bolsheviki follow a consistent policy. They realized long ago\r\n     that the revolution, though primarily political, must become\r\n     economic and socialist. They know that economy and socialism have\r\n     nothing to do with racial or political boundaries and that the\r\n     future of our revolution must, therefore, be international. The\r\n     revolution must pass over all political and racial frontiers and\r\n     crush opposing economic ideas. They know that a state organized on\r\n     Socialist and pacifist lines cannot exist if hemmed in by\r\n     capitalistic and militarist states. Russia's revolution must follow\r\n     the law of all healthy organisms. It must increase. If it does not\r\n     increase it will decline....\r\n\r\n     \"Russia will continue to propagandize unshrinkingly in all\r\n     countries.\r\n\r\n     \"We may be left temporarily in peace to enjoy our revolutionary\r\n     social and economic system while the rest of Europe continues to\r\n     groan under a capitalism and monarchism which, perhaps, for the\r\n     time being, will be purged of a too dangerous imperialism.\r\n\r\n     \"What will Russia do if this be so?\r\n\r\n     \"Short-sighted men reply: 'Cherish your own revolution; thank\r\n     Heaven that you are better off than the rest of the world; and let\r\n     the rest of the world do what it likes.'\r\n\r\n     \"But we Bolsheviki are against such a policy. Short of armed\r\n     pressure against any European country, we shall not shrink from\r\n     measures necessary for spreading our revolution in the world.\r\n\r\n     \"The motives why every Bolshevik must approve of this policy are\r\n     overwhelming. The first is that a peace between the ideas of\r\n     revolutionary Russia and the ideas of non-revolutionary Europe\r\n     could at best be a truce....\r\n\r\n     \"Each side would foster its ideas and prepare for a future\r\n     struggle, and since non-revolutionary Europe will always be better\r\n     armed than pacifist Russia, the European despots (as soon as they\r\n     have recovered from their present bitter lesson of the meaning of\r\n     war) undoubtedly would hurl themselves upon Russia in order to wipe\r\n     away the one revolutionary plague-spot.\r\n\r\n     \"For that reason our revolution cannot rest until it has\r\n     established full revolution in all neighbor lands.\r\n\r\n     \"The second reason why Russia must incite Europe to revolt is that\r\n     by its very nature, the revolution cannot live in isolation. Europe\r\n     must be organized, either on a capitalistic basis or a proletarian,\r\n     anti-capitalistic basis. The dual system is inconceivable. It is\r\n     impossible for Russia to exist without capitalistic banks and\r\n     industries, if she has to trade with countries which have\r\n     capitalistic banks and industries....\r\n\r\n     \"In its own defense the revolution must propagandize and convert.\r\n     It must incite and urge on the masses against their present rulers\r\n     in all countries, and it must do this unshrinkingly, without fear\r\n     of consequences, or consideration for the feelings and interests of\r\n     the foreign affected parties.\"\r\n\r\nThe question may now be asked, What means is the Russian Bolshevist\r\ngovernment using to incite revolution in America? We have not, of\r\ncourse, much definite information as yet; but we know that Lenine's\r\ngovernment has lots of money which it can use for foreign revolutionary\r\npropaganda, and that a certain Ludwig C. A. K. Martens has been in our\r\ncountry for some time claiming to represent the Soviet government and\r\nboasting that he is able to deposit in our banks for commercial purposes\r\nhundreds of millions of Russian gold. He is very active, has been\r\nassisted by Morris Hillquit of \"The Call,\" the Socialist daily of New\r\nYork City, goes about visiting different Socialist organizations, and in\r\nreturn is entertained by them. During the months of April and May, 1919,\r\nmany notices of such receptions were published in \"The Call.\" One\r\nexample will suffice. Under the caption, \"Official Socialist News,\" in\r\nthe issue of March 31, 1919, we read:\r\n\r\n     \"The central committee of Local New York, Socialist Party, greets\r\n     Comrade L. C. A. K. Martens, recently appointed the representative\r\n     of the Russian Soviet government in the United States and in his\r\n     name the victorious Russian proletariat.\r\n\r\n     \"We sincerely hope that his work in behalf of the Socialist\r\n     government of Russia will be crowned with success. We pledge him\r\n     our aid, and promise that we shall not rest until the government of\r\n     the United States has ceased to be a party to the economic and\r\n     political isolation of Russia and the military occupation of\r\n     territory of the Soviet republic.\"\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of March, 1919, Martens shared offices with Santeri\r\nNuorteva, also a great friend of the American Socialists. Nuorteva was\r\nhead of the Bolshevist propaganda in this country and from his office\r\nmailed the \"Weekly Bulletin of the Bureau of Information on Soviet\r\nRussia.\" Nuorteva denied that these large sheets, which are about the\r\nsame size as the propaganda sheets issued in the first months of the war\r\nby the German Information Service, constitute propaganda. Like the\r\nGerman Information Service sheets, each contains from six to ten\r\narticles. All paint conditions in Russia under Trotzky and Lenine as\r\nsteadily improving and show those men and their aids as gentle,\r\nkind-hearted individuals whose only sin is the betterment of mankind.\r\n\r\nAmong labor unions Bolshevism has made great headway. The New Labor\r\nParty of Illinois in 1919 not only supported Soviet Russia but favored\r\nthe Soviet system in our own country. Sensible workingmen in the\r\nAmerican Federation of Labor and conservative members of the new Labor\r\nParty had good reason for being alarmed and for suspecting that American\r\npropagators of Bolshevism received Russian gold from some one, possibly\r\nfrom Martens.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist papers of the United States approve of Bolshevism,\r\nSpartacism and Communism, and would gladly welcome it to our country.\r\n\"The Call,\" New York, March 31, 1919, on its editorial page says: \"The\r\nred in the East is the dawning of a new day.\" On April 1, 1919, the same\r\npaper contained a long article on the first page, entitled, \"Forces of\r\nDarkness Open Their Campaign to End Bolshevism.\" On April 11, 1919, in\r\nan editorial on the impending capture of Odessa by the Bolsheviki, it\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     \"The evacuation of the Black Sea port of Odessa by foreign troops\r\n     that have been holding it for many months is news of great\r\n     significance....\r\n\r\n     \"Like the German forces hurled against Soviet Russia by the mailed\r\n     fist of the Kaiser, the French, Greek and Rumanian soldiers go out\r\n     in a different mind and temper than they had going in. Wherever\r\n     they go, they will spread the ideas of human liberty and\r\n     co-operative development that they were sent to crush.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 13, 1919, \"The Call\" printed a poem on the assassinated\r\nSpartacan leader, Karl Liebknecht:\r\n\r\n                \"Liebknecht\r\n\r\n    \"Liebknecht, your lonely, bitter course is run!\r\n    While we, with cautious feet, pursue the goal--\r\n    'Tis not in pity's name that we make moan--\r\n    Nay!

Shall not the tomb\r\n    Yield heavy harvest where such seed is sown?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Call,\" April 15, 1919, published the following endorsement of\r\nHungarian Communism by the New York State Committee of the Socialist\r\nParty:\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas, the working class of Hungary have seized political power\r\n     and are using the same for the purpose of socializing industry and\r\n     as an instrument for the complete emancipation of labor, therefore\r\n     be it\r\n\r\n     \"Resolved, that we, the State Committee of the Socialist Party of\r\n     the State of New York, in meeting assembled congratulate the\r\n     Socialist movement and the working class of Hungary on the success\r\n     of the revolution and on the position that the Hungarian Socialist\r\n     Republic has taken in defiance of the capitalist imperialists of\r\n     all lands.\"\r\n\r\nIn the April 24, 1919, edition of \"The Call\" we read:\r\n\r\n     \"A new period in the evolution of the social and economic structure\r\n     of the world is at hand. A new day for those who toil. A new day\r\n     which will mean economic and political liberty based on justice for\r\n     those who toil. Some call it revolution. Well, if that be the word,\r\n     so be it. And woe be to those who in their blind folly throw\r\n     themselves in the way to stop its onward sweep throughout the\r\n     civilized world, for they shall be as grass before the sickle!\r\n     Hail, all hail, the new day!\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in its issue of April 30, 1919, \"The Call\" favors the Hungarian\r\nCommunist regime of Bela Kun:\r\n\r\n     \"'There is reason to believe,' says a dispatch from Budapest, 'that\r\n     the present Hungarian government has been unofficially approached\r\n     by the Entente with the suggestion that military invasion might be\r\n     arrested if the extremist members were replaced by more moderate\r\n     Socialists.' Making all allowance for the unreliability of the\r\n     dispatch, it is hard to say which cuts the more contemptible\r\n     figure, the Entente or the 'Moderate Socialists.'\"\r\n\r\nIn its 1919 May Day edition, \"The Call,\" under the caption, \"All Attacks\r\non Russian Revolution Have Recoiled,\" shows its sympathy for Bolshevism\r\nand Spartacism:\r\n\r\n     \"Every attack of world reaction upon Soviet Russia, the center of\r\n     the world revolution, has remained fruitless. The internal strength\r\n     and the external power of the Russian Workers' and Peasants'\r\n     Republic is growing daily into a power that will successfully\r\n     withstand the onslaughts of capitalism. The possibilities of\r\n     subduing the Russian revolution by force from without decrease\r\n     constantly as the governments of the different countries are ever\r\n     more forcibly threatened by the fermentation among their own\r\n     peoples which they must combat.\r\n\r\n     \"At present the second, the Socialist revolution, has come upon the\r\n     scene in Germany, which, driven to the edge of starvation, bleeding\r\n     and drained to the marrow by Kaiserism and militarism, is now being\r\n     held in the grip of Entente capitalism. There at this moment the\r\n     courageous and steadfast Socialists stand under the flag of\r\n     Spartacus, first on the barricades under the sign of the general\r\n     strike and street battles....\r\n\r\n     \"The German Socialists of the Right have soiled the name of\r\n     Socialism by being inimical to the Russian revolution; by failing\r\n     to communicate with the radical English elements in the English\r\n     strike movements, which are also spontaneous expressions of\r\n     proletarian unrest; by acting as the lackeys of Kaiserism and\r\n     capitalism in opposing the November revolution to the last hour\r\n     before its outbreak; and, finally, by their unspeakable mass\r\n     murders of starving, demonstrating and striking proletarians.\r\n\r\n     \"In this struggle between the revolution and the social-patriotic\r\n     bourgeois reaction which now enters into a decisive phase, two of\r\n     the noblest pioneers of the international, Dr. Karl Liebknecht and\r\n     Rosa Luxemburg, were murdered by the hate-filled bourgeois mob and\r\n     the degenerate Scheidemann-Noske henchmen. Another victim of the\r\n     treacherous reaction was Kurt Eisner, Socialist premier of Bavaria.\r\n     One need but be an honest, fearless Socialist to be in danger of\r\n     one's life under the hypocritical, false, brutal and murderous\r\n     regime of Ebert-Scheidemann-Noske. This regime revives the worst\r\n     methods of Kaiserism and holds its protecting hand over the\r\n     bourgeois and capitalists of Germany. But this blood and the blood\r\n     of our martyrs will only urge the masses to continuous\r\n     unconquerable struggle, till the criminal Ebert-Scheidemann-Noske\r\n     reaction, together with the criminals and conspirators of the old\r\n     empire, yield to the power of the revolutionary justice of the\r\n     masses.\"\r\n\r\nIn the May 1, 1919, issue of \"The Call,\" the May Day Manifesto is made\r\npublic by Morris Hillquit, International Secretary of the Socialist\r\nParty of the United States. Only part of it is hereby quoted:\r\n\r\n     \"We send fraternal greetings and vows of whole-hearted sympathy to\r\n     the Socialist Soviet Republic of Russia, which is so valiantly\r\n     upholding the lofty international proletarian ideals in the face of\r\n     the combining military economic and political attacks of\r\n     reactionary powers, and in spite of the systematic campaign of\r\n     libelous misrepresentation on the part of the lying capitalist\r\n     press of the world. We send congratulations and fraternal good\r\n     wishes to the workers of Hungary on the establishment of a free\r\n     Communistic Workers' Republic, upon the ruins of the predatory\r\n     monarchy of their exploiting and land-monopolizing rulers. We\r\n     extend the hand of comradeship and solidarity to the revolutionary\r\n     Socialists of Germany and Russia, now engaged in a life-and-death\r\n     struggle to secure for the working masses of their countries the\r\n     full fruit of their victorious revolutions; to the workers of\r\n     England in their efforts to wrest the control of the industries\r\n     from the parasites in their country, and to the Socialists of\r\n     France, Italy and all other countries of Europe in their fights\r\n     against their revolutionary governments.\"\r\n\r\n\"The New Age,\" the Socialist paper of Buffalo, April 10, 1919, published\r\na \"Greeting to the Soviet Republic of Hungary\":\r\n\r\n     \"The proletariat of Hungary has taken all power in its own hands.\r\n     Like a bolt from the blue the workers, soldiers and peasants of\r\n     'conquered' Hungary proclaim their intervention in the arena of\r\n     world politics--and the diplomats of capitalism are thrown into a\r\n     flurry of mingled rage and fear.\r\n\r\n     \"While the wires were still hot with the news of the resignation of\r\n     Count Karolyi, president of the provisional government of Hungary,\r\n     as a protest against the peace terms of the Paris Conference, came\r\n     word of the complete triumph of revolutionary Socialism and the\r\n     establishment of the second Soviet Republic in the world.\r\n\r\n     \"With little or no resistance, with no intervening period of\r\n     Socialist compromise, the Hungarian Soviet Republic rises to power\r\n     and in its initial proclamation ushers in the dictatorship of the\r\n     proletariat, decrees the socialization of the large estates, mines,\r\n     big industries, banks and lines of transportation, declares its\r\n     oneness of purpose with the revolutionary proletariat of Russia and\r\n     its readiness to form an armed alliance with the federated Soviet\r\n     Republic. All over the country Workmen's, Soldiers' and Peasants'\r\n     Councils are in action and take over the functions of government.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Revolutionary Age,\" then a Socialist paper of Boston, on March 29,\r\n1919, showed its complete sympathy for the Bolshevists, Communists and\r\nSpartacans:\r\n\r\n     \"So the Hungarian workers set about their task and the eastern sky\r\n     is brightening.\r\n\r\n     \"Already the two Soviet governments have issued an appeal to the\r\n     workers of all countries to sweep away the old system. The\r\n     bourgeois press tells of the spread of Bolshevism throughout\r\n     central Europe and the diplomats of Capitalism are turning this way\r\n     and that to avert fresh outbreaks. But they are powerless. Every\r\n     new move brings new complications, every award of territory here\r\n     brings discontent and adds to the 'menace' there.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Next!\r\n\r\n     \"The fear that weighs upon the world of Capitalism and the\r\n     diplomats in Paris is: Who next? The proclamation of a Soviet\r\n     Republic in Hungary is to them not a fact, but a symbol--a symbol\r\n     of the onward sweep of the proletarian revolution, which may break\r\n     loose in other nations.\r\n\r\n     \"Through this symbol looms Soviet Russia--gigantic, mysterious and\r\n     implacable. Despised by the world of Capitalism, intrigued against\r\n     and vilified, isolated in the spaces of its own territory, attacked\r\n     by the soldiers of the Allies--Soviet Russia, through the flaming\r\n     energy of its proletariat and Socialism has conquered in spite of\r\n     all. The Allies, their Capitalism and Imperialism, are no longer a\r\n     menace to Soviet Russia; it is now Soviet Russia that menaces the\r\n     Allies through its own gigantic strength and the threat of the\r\n     international proletarian revolution....\r\n\r\n     \"And this revolutionary army of Soviet Russia, massed at the\r\n     frontier, is prepared to march into Hungary or Poland or Germany to\r\n     co-operate with the revolutionary masses in any war that may be\r\n     necessary against international Imperialism and for the proletarian\r\n     revolution.\r\n\r\n     \"The situation in Germany is critical and crucial.

The following\r\nquotations are taken from the April, 1919, edition:\r\n\r\n     \"In order to be a good American, according to the view of the\r\n     powers that be, it is necessary to repeat and believe the stories\r\n     written in the capitalist press about the Bolsheviki. But we, who\r\n     know what is going on, and do not believe them, maintain that a\r\n     person can be truthful, and still be an American. That he can be a\r\n     good, pure, unadulterated American, and still lend his sympathies\r\n     to the Bolsheviki.\r\n\r\n     \"In revolutionary Germany the struggle between the defenders of\r\n     capitalism and the champions of working class emanicipation--the\r\n     Spartacides and their adherents--continues almost unceasingly. The\r\n     'democratic' government has taken desperate steps to crush the\r\n     revolution; there have been wholesale executions and other\r\n     repressive acts....\r\n\r\n     \"The final conflict is now on. 'Ruthless slaughter' is the\r\n     governmental decree with Gustav Noske, 'minister of defense,' in\r\n     charge of the butchering. And what is it that Noske and his\r\n     'Socialist' colleagues are defending? The interests of the German\r\n     capitalists. Sacred private property rights are in danger; the\r\n     stronghold of capitalism is being assailed. The expropriation of\r\n     the capitalists is the aim of the proletarian revolutionists....\r\n\r\n     \"All the old friends of Kaiserism--Hoffman, Hindenberg and the\r\n     rest--are lined up against the Spartacans. Although these elements\r\n     of reaction have gained temporary victory, the workers are\r\n     undismayed.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Proletarian,\" in this same issue, referring to the Bela Kun\r\ndictatorship of Hungary, says:\r\n\r\n     \"On Sunday, March 23d, the news was flashed across America that\r\n     Hungary had swung into the ranks of the revolutionary proletarian\r\n     dictatorships....\r\n\r\n     \"A note from the Paris Conference seems to have been the last straw\r\n     that 'broke the camel's back' of the middle course government,\r\n     causing President, Cabinet and all, to resign. This allowed the\r\n     political power to fall into the hands of those who are alone\r\n     capable of handling the situation--the revolutionary proletariat.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Chicago Socialist\" is also pro-Bolshevist. In the April 1, 1919,\r\nedition each of the three following lines extends across the top of the\r\nfront page of the paper:\r\n\r\n     \"How Many Bolshevists in Chicago?\r\n\r\n     \"The Vote Today Will Tell.\r\n\r\n     \"Vote The Socialist Ticket.\"\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the first page of this April election day issue of \"The\r\nChicago Socialist,\" the following notice is given to voters:\r\n\r\n     \"Vote for the great change, TODAY, by casting a Socialist ballot.\r\n     Stand up and be counted for a Soviet Republic, not only in Russia,\r\n     or in Hungary, not only in the United States or in some other land;\r\n     but stand up and be counted for the Soviet Republic of the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe Socialist paper of Duluth, like the other Marxian papers of the\r\nUnited States, also favored Spartacism and Bolshevism, for in the March\r\n7, 1919, issue of \"The Truth\" we read:\r\n\r\n     \"We can honestly say that the position in Germany is very\r\n     promising.

In Germany, Austria and countries similarly\r\nsituated, its sympathies are with the more advanced Socialist groups.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"The Call,\" May 17, 1919, Martens, the representative in the United\r\nStates of the Russian Soviet Government, is quoted as saying:\r\n\r\n     \"Russian workers, whom I represent, acknowledge with gratitude the\r\n     sympathy toward the struggles of Soviet Russia evinced by the\r\n     Socialist Party of America, as well as by the Socialist Labor\r\n     Party, the I. W. W. and other organizations of the working class,\r\n     and they return the sympathy without discrimination.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Call,\" March 30, 1919, informs its readers that Cleveland\r\nSocialists were organizing a Workers' and Soldiers' Soviet, and again,\r\non April 1, 1919, that soviets had been established in Seattle, Portland\r\nand San Francisco. Eugene V. Debs, in an article written by him in \"The\r\nClass Struggle,\" said:\r\n\r\n     \"From the crown of my head to the soles of my feet I am Bolshevik\r\n     and proud of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Call,\" April 14, 1919, published Debs' \"Last Minute Message to All\r\nNew York Socialists\":\r\n\r\n     \"As I am about to enter the prison doors, I wish to send to the\r\n     Socialists of New York who have loyally stood by me since my first\r\n     arrest, this little message of love and cheer. These are pregnant\r\n     and promising days. We are all on the threshold of tremendous\r\n     changes. The workers of the world are awakening and bestirring\r\n     themselves as never before. All the forces that are playing upon\r\n     the modern world are making for the overthrow of despotism in all\r\n     its forms and for the emancipation of the masses of mankind. I\r\n     shall be in prison in the days to come, but my revolutionary spirit\r\n     will be abroad, and I shall not be inactive.

Love to\r\n     all my Comrades, and all hail to the Revolution.--Eugene Victor\r\n     Debs.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the same issue of \"The Call\" we learn that Debs, on leaving\r\nWheeling, West Virginia, for the Moundsville prison, gave the following\r\nstatement to David Karsner, staff correspondent: \"I enter the prison\r\ndoors a flaming revolutionist--my head erect, my spirit untamed, and my\r\nsoul unconquered.\"\r\n\r\nA press despatch from Toledo, Ohio, March 31, 1919, describes the\r\nserious socialist riot which took place that afternoon as a protest\r\nagainst the then impending imprisonment of Debs, the self-styled\r\n\"flaming revolutionist\":\r\n\r\n     \"Toledo, Ohio, March 31.--When they were refused admission by city\r\n     officials to Memorial Hall, a city building where Eugene V. Debs\r\n     was scheduled to speak, 5,000 persons stormed the place, broke\r\n     windows and doors, and then paraded the streets crying, 'To hell\r\n     with the mayor.' ...\r\n\r\n     \"Announcement that Debs would not be permitted to speak was made\r\n     late Saturday night, after the Socialists here had prepared to\r\n     handle an overflow crowd. The announcement appeared in the morning\r\n     papers, and was the first notice the Socialists had that their\r\n     meeting could not be held.\r\n\r\n     \"When the hour for Debs to speak arrived there were at least 6,000\r\n     men and women congregated about the William McKinley monument in\r\n     Courthouse Park, across the street from Memorial hall.\r\n\r\n     \"A man mounted the base of the monument. 'We'll use Memorial Hall\r\n     this afternoon if we have to wade through blood to do it!' he\r\n     shouted. A policeman grabbed him and he was thrown unceremoniously\r\n     into a patrol wagon. The man who essayed to speak next also was\r\n     arrested.\r\n\r\n     \"As the crowd sensed what was occurring the radicals began to hoot\r\n     and boo the officers. Clubs were drawn and the crowd was made to\r\n     move. Then came the parade through the streets and cries of 'Down\r\n     with the mayor!' 'Hang him!' 'To hell with the police!' and others\r\n     of a similar nature.\r\n\r\n     \"It was after five o'clock before the police were able to disperse\r\n     the crowd. Fist fights by the dozens occurred on corners. Hotel\r\n     lobbies were invaded by the malcontents. Street cars were held up\r\n     and threats of serious outbreaks were to be heard on every hand....\r\n\r\n     \"More than seventy-five men were arrested, including Thomas Devine,\r\n     Socialist member of the city council.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nVIOLENCE, BLOODSHED AND ARMED REBELLION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery year on May Day the Socialists are in the habit of publishing\r\narticles and making speeches of a more than usual revolutionary\r\ncharacter. They are also fond of parading on that day to incite riot,\r\nand of holding meetings to stir up discontent and to foment rebellion\r\namong the laboring classes. May Day, 1919, was an especially serious one\r\nin several cities of the United States and will long be remembered,\r\nbecause the Socialist riots occurred while the whole country was excited\r\nover the unsuccessful mailing of bombs to a score or so of eminent\r\ncitizens. The most serious Marxian riots took place in Cleveland, Ohio,\r\nand were described in part in the \"Chicago Tribune\" as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Cleveland, Ohio, May 1.--An unidentified man was killed by a\r\n     detective's bullet, eleven policemen were shot or badly beaten, and\r\n     about 100 persons wounded, many seriously, in general rioting which\r\n     brought a dramatic finale this afternoon to a Socialist May Day\r\n     demonstration here.\r\n\r\n     \"About thirty persons, seriously injured, are in hospitals\r\n     to-night, while scores of others, including women, were trampled by\r\n     rioters or clubbed by police.\r\n\r\n     \"Socialist headquarters was totally wrecked by angry civilians bent\r\n     on putting an end to the demonstration....\r\n\r\n     \"A mob of several hundred threatened police headquarters when C. E.\r\n     Ruthenberg, Socialist leader and former Socialist candidate for\r\n     mayor, was arrested and for more than an hour the entire downtown\r\n     section of the city was a warring mass of Socialists, police,\r\n     civilians and soldiers, the latter riding down the rioters in army\r\n     trucks and tanks.\r\n\r\n     \"Dozens of shots were fired in Public square, where more than\r\n     20,000 Socialists and sympathizers assembled for a May Day rally\r\n     and to protest against the convictions of Eugene V. Debs and Thomas\r\n     J. Mooney.\r\n\r\n     \"The trouble started in Superior Avenue, near East Ninth Street,\r\n     when the head of one of the five Socialist parades, scheduled to\r\n     meet in a mass meeting at Public square, was stopped, and Liberty\r\n     Loan workers and an army lieutenant tore a red flag from a man at\r\n     the head of the marchers, practically every one of whom were\r\n     carrying red flags.\r\n\r\n     \"In less than ten minutes riots had developed at several other\r\n     points, mounted and foot policemen being switched from one location\r\n     to another to quell the fighting.\r\n\r\n     \"The trouble in the public square started when Lieut. H. S. Bergen,\r\n     who served with the 80th Division overseas, demanded that several\r\n     soldiers among the Socialists on the platform remove their uniforms\r\n     or the red flags they wore on their breasts.\r\n\r\n     \"The soldiers refused, and C. E. Ruthenberg, scheduled as the\r\n     principal Socialist speaker, interceded for the Socialists.\r\n\r\n     \"Lieut. Bergen, followed by Lieut. John Hardy of Detroit, thereupon\r\n     mounted the platform and tore the red insignia from the khaki\r\n     uniforms. The act was the signal for a grand rush by thousands of\r\n     Socialist sympathizers.\"\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, May 4, 1919, serious trouble with the Socialist-Bolshevist\r\nelement of Gary, Indiana, was narrowly averted. The account, as\r\npublished in the \"Chicago Tribune\" on the next day, reads in part as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"There was no 'Red' parade in Gary yesterday....\r\n\r\n     \"Fifty policemen, wearing revolvers on their belts and reinforced\r\n     by a special shotgun squad of sixteen, a company of state militia,\r\n     thirty deputy sheriffs, a group of secret service men from Chicago\r\n     and hundreds of citizen volunteers, prevented the parade after the\r\n     Russian Socialists flouted an order of Mayor W.H. Hodges\r\n     prohibiting the march and declared they would proceed despite the\r\n     authorities....\r\n\r\n     \"Yesterday's demonstration was the result of a carefully planned\r\n     plot matured for nearly a month by the foreign radical element of\r\n     Lake County, Indiana. Its stated purpose was to protest against the\r\n     conviction of Eugene V. Debs and Kate Richards O'Hare. An\r\n     undercurrent of rumor among the radicals gave it a more significant\r\n     meaning, however.\r\n\r\n     \"On Thursday secret service men obtained copies of pamphlets\r\n     printed in Russian, containing a formula for the manufacture of\r\n     explosives. More literature calling for the overthrow of the\r\n     government was circulated. A third series of pamphlets contained\r\n     the Constitution of the Russian Soviet Republic.\r\n\r\n     \"Friday Morris Lieberman, head of the Socialists, called on Mayor\r\n     Hodges for a permit to parade. It was refused with the explanation\r\n     that riots such as caused two deaths in Cleveland were feared....\r\n\r\n     \"Early yesterday morning radicals began to arrive in Gary. Cars\r\n     from Indiana Harbor, Whiting, Hammond, Crown Point, and trains from\r\n     Chicago brought them by the dozens.\r\n\r\n     \"By noon several thousand had gathered in and near the Socialist\r\n     headquarters, a mile south of the business district of Gary. Under\r\n     portraits of Trotzky and Lenine they sang Russian songs and\r\n     gathered about in knots waiting for 'zero hour'--one o'clock.\r\n\r\n     \"Lieberman, fearing bloodshed, decided to counsel his followers\r\n     against a parade. They howled him down, however, and hotter heads\r\n     took charge of the meeting. A dozen girls, with rolls of red\r\n     ribbon, pinned a scarlet strip on the lapel of each man's coat as\r\n     he entered the meeting hall. Red neckties were abundant. Red hat\r\n     bands made their appearance. Many wore scarlet carnations.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Haas of the Municipal Court of Gary thus commented on those\r\narrested in the demonstration:\r\n\r\n     \"All except Capolitto have failed to become citizens. All except\r\n     him and one other tried to evade war service in our army,\r\n     endeavoring to sneak out on the ground of not being citizens of\r\n     this country. All they seem to want is to come over here and make\r\n     trouble--out of twenty-one gun-toters who have been brought before\r\n     me, nineteen have been foreigners and not even citizens.\"\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the Marxian movement, both in the United States and\r\nabroad, testify that to be a Socialist is to be a plotter against all\r\nexisting forms of government. Marx and Engels, for instance, confess the\r\ntruth of this in their celebrated \"Communist Manifesto,\" which they\r\naddressed to their followers over half a century ago, and which is\r\nlooked upon even today by the rank and file of the party as embodying\r\nthe fundamental principles of International Socialism. \"The Communists,\"\r\nwe are told, \"everywhere support every revolutionary movement against\r\nthe existing social and political order of things\" and \"disdain to\r\nconceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be\r\nobtained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social\r\nconditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a communistic\r\nrevolution.\"\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the late August Bebel, the leader of the Socialists\r\nof Germany, for the confession that \"along with the state die out its\r\nrepresentatives--cabinet ministers, parliaments, standing armies, police\r\nand constables, courts, attorneys, prison officials, tariff and tax\r\ncollectors, in short the whole political apparatus. Barracks and other\r\nsuch military structures, palaces of law and of administration,\r\nprisons--all will now await better use. Ten thousand laws, decrees and\r\nregulations become so much rubbish; they have only historic value.\"\r\n[\"Women Under Socialism,\" by Bebel, page 319, of the 1904 edition in\r\nEnglish.]\r\n\r\n\"The People,\" New York, May 13, 1900, in speaking of the relation of\r\nSocialism to existing forms of government, including our own, affirms\r\nthat \"while there is a very general idea that Socialism means an\r\nextension of the powers and functions of government, still this is a\r\nvery natural and dangerous misconception, and one that ought to be\r\nguarded against.\" \"Socialism,\" it adds, \"does not mean the extension of\r\ngovernment, but on the contrary it means the end, the elimination of\r\ngovernment.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"International Socialist Review,\" Chicago, February, 1912, together\r\nwith many other magazines and papers current at the time, called\r\nattention to the fact that William D. Haywood, who for a long time had\r\nbeen before the eyes of the public on account of his revolutionary\r\nutterances and writings, declared in a speech at Cooper Union, in New\r\nYork City, that the Socialists were conspirators against the United\r\nStates Government.\r\n\r\n\"The Call,\" April 1, 1919, in an editorial note says that \"the whole\r\nsystem of government in the United States, Federal, State and Municipal,\r\nseems to be out of date.\"\r\n\r\nThough the men who march behind the red flag, singing the Marseillaise\r\nof the French Revolution, usually deny to the general public, for\r\nreasons of political expediency, that the Socialist movement is a\r\nviolent and revolutionary one, it is evident to those who have read\r\ntheir books, magazines, and papers, that the use of the ballot and\r\neducation are not the means on which they rely finally for the\r\nestablishment of their visionary commonwealth. Violence is advocated and\r\nhabitually practised by the Socialists who constitute the Industrial\r\nWorkers of the World, whose banner with the inscription, \"No God, No\r\nMaster,\" has brought them into disrepute all over the country. Jack\r\nLondon, a Socialist widely known in the United States and England as a\r\nnovelist, furnishes us with excellent reasons for believing that the\r\nInternational Socialist Party approves of violence and assassination,\r\nand thereby reaffirms its allegiance to the base principles of the\r\nFrench Commune. Writing in the \"International Socialist Review\" of\r\nAugust, 1909, Jack London made the following comment on the progress of\r\nSocialism in Russia:\r\n\r\n     \"Our comrades in Russia have formed what they call 'THE FIGHTING\r\n     ORGANIZATION.' This FIGHTING ORGANIZATION accused, tried, found\r\n     guilty and condemned to death one Sipiaguin, Minister of the\r\n     Interior. On April 2, he was shot and killed in the Maryinsky\r\n     Palace. Two years later the FIGHTING ORGANIZATION condemned to\r\n     death and executed another Minister of the Interior, Von Plehve.\r\n     Having done so it issued a document, dated July 29, 1904, setting\r\n     forth the counts of its indictment of Von Plehve and its\r\n     responsibility for the assassination. Now, and to the point, this\r\n     document was sent out to the Socialists of the world, and by them\r\n     was published everywhere in the magazines and newspapers. The point\r\n     is, not that the Socialists of the world were unafraid to do it,\r\n     but that they did it as a matter of routine, giving publication to\r\n     what might be called an official document of International\r\n     Revolutionary Movement.\"\r\n\r\nAugust Bebel in \"Unsere Ziele,\" page 44, expresses his sentiments on the\r\nsubject of violence quite as frankly as Jack London. \"We must not\r\nshudder,\" he tells us, \"at the thought of the possible employment of\r\nviolence; we must not raise an alarm cry at the suppression of existing\r\nrights, at violent expropriation, etc. History teaches that at all times\r\nnew ideas, as a rule, were realized by a violent conflict with the\r\ndefenders of the past, and that the combatants for new ideas struck\r\nblows as deadly as possible at the defenders of antiquity. Not without\r\nreason does Karl Marx, in his work on 'Capital' exclaim: 'Violence is\r\nthe obstetrician that waits on every ancient society which is about to\r\ngive birth to a new one; violence is in itself a social factor.'\"\r\n\r\nAs reference has just been made to Karl Marx, it will be well to call\r\nattention to the fact that the Father of modern Socialism, in \"The Civil\r\nWar in France,\" page 78, claims that \"the workingmen's Paris, with its\r\nCommune, will forever be celebrated as the glorious harbinger of a new\r\nsociety.\" The Commune, then, whose anniversary is celebrated on the 18th\r\nof March, every year, by the Socialists all over the world, has been,\r\nand still is considered the precursor of their contemplated state. The\r\nreign of terror and rebellion in which tens of thousands of Frenchmen\r\nmet their death, while public buildings and priceless works of art were\r\nbeing burned or destroyed and many beautiful churches pillaged, is the\r\nboast of the Socialistic champions of universal peace. The Parisian mob\r\nof criminals and revolutionists, which was finally subdued by 150,000\r\nFrench troops, after men and women had run about the streets with\r\npetroleum cans, firing public buildings and private houses and seizing\r\nmany victims whom they hurried off to death, is, therefore, considered\r\nby the Socialists as one of the most illustrious gatherings of persons\r\nrecorded in history, and one worthy of special memory, honor and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nVictor Berger of Wisconsin, speaking in the 1908 National Convention of\r\nthe Socialist Party in favor of an amendment to the party constitution,\r\nproposed by Delegate Hazlett, to the effect that any person opposing\r\npolitical action should be expelled from the party, shows how little\r\ndifference there is between the advocates of \"political action,\" who are\r\nsupposed to favor the use of the ballot, and the \"direct actionists,\"\r\nwho admit their preference for violence.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard it pleaded,\" said Berger, \"many a time right in our own\r\nmeetings by speakers that come to our meetings, that the only salvation\r\nfor the proletariat of America is direct action, that the ballot box is\r\nsimply a humbug. Now I don't know how this question is going to be\r\nsolved. I have no doubt that in the last analysis we must shoot, and\r\nwhen it comes to shooting, Wisconsin will be there. We always make\r\ngood.... In order to be able to shoot even some day we must have the\r\npowers of political government in our hands, at least to a great extent.\r\nI want that understood. So everybody who is talking to you about direct\r\naction and so on, and about political action being a humbug, is your\r\nenemy today, because he keeps you from getting the powers of political\r\ngovernment.\" [\"Proceedings of the 1908 National Convention of the\r\nSocialist Party,\" page 241.]\r\n\r\nOn July 31, 1909, we find Victor Berger, who posed as the special\r\nexponent of \"political action,\" against the \"anarchistic\" element in his\r\nparty, writing as follows in the \"Social Democratic Herald\" of\r\nMilwaukee:\r\n\r\n     \"No one will claim that I am given to the reciting of revolutionary\r\n     phrases. On the contrary I am known to be a constructive Socialist.\r\n     However, in view of the plutocratic law making of the present day,\r\n     it is easy to predict that the safety and hope of this country will\r\n     finally lie in one direction only, that of a violent and bloody\r\n     revolution. Therefore, I say, each of the 500,000 Socialist voters\r\n     and of the 2,000,000 workingmen who instinctively incline our way,\r\n     should, besides doing much reading and still more thinking, also\r\n     have a good rifle and the necessary rounds of ammunition in his\r\n     home, and be prepared to back up his ballot with his bullets if\r\n     necessary. This may look like a startling statement. Yet I can see\r\n     nothing else for the American masses today.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Social Democratic Herald,\" August 14, 1909, Victor Berger drops\r\na few more words on the same subject in an article entitled: \"IF THIS BE\r\nTREASON, MAKE THE BEST OF IT.\" \"There are two ways,\" says he, \"of\r\neffecting great social changes in a republic--the ballot and the bullet.\r\nIf our people are not wise--if they are otherwise--then we may have use\r\nfor both of them.\"\r\n\r\nNow, if Berger is a specimen of the extreme \"political actionist,\" a\r\nconservative, the enemy of \"direct action,\" who can imagine the\r\ntreasonable intentions and bloody thoughts of the immense number of\r\n\"direct actionists\" who throng the ranks of these national conspirators?\r\n\r\nIt is not flattering to the State of Wisconsin to realize that Berger\r\nhas several times been chosen to represent one of its Congressional\r\ndistricts in the United States House of Representatives. Yet Berger has\r\napt pupils. On January 12, 1919, Mayor Hoan of Milwaukee presided at a\r\nMilwaukee meeting of 8,000 \"Reds\" to protest against the conviction,\r\nunder the Espionage Law, of Victor L. Berger and four co-conspirators,\r\nand prolonged cheering and waving of \"Red\" insignia answered the\r\nfollowing words spoken by William Bross Lloyd (_Testimony, Socialist\r\nTrial, Albany, page 1623_):\r\n\r\n     \"What we want is revolutionary preparedness. We want to\r\n     organize.... We want a mobilization plan and an organization for\r\n     the revolution. We want to get rifles, machine guns, field\r\n     artillery, and the ammunition for it. You want to get dynamite. You\r\n     want to tell off the men for the revolution when it starts here.\r\n     You want to tell off the men who are to take the dynamite to the\r\n     armory doors and blow them in and capture the guns and ammunition\r\n     there so that the capitalists won't have any. You want to tell off\r\n     the men to dynamite the doors of the banks to get the money to\r\n     finance the revolution.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam D. Haywood and Frank Bohn are the joint authors of a pamphlet\r\nentitled, \"Industrial Socialism,\" the revolutionary tenor of which may\r\nbe gathered from the following lines:\r\n\r\n     \"When the worker, either through experience or a study of\r\n     Socialism, comes to know this truth [i.e., economic determinism],\r\n     he acts accordingly. He retains absolutely no respect for the\r\n     property rights of the profit takers. He will use any weapon which\r\n     will win his fight. He knows that the present laws of property are\r\n     made by and for the capitalists. Therefore he does not hesitate to\r\n     break them.\"\r\n\r\nSince Haywood and Bohn evidently had no intention of using paper-cap\r\npistols and pop-guns as their weapons, and since they certainly did not\r\nmean to shoot at stone walls and forest trees, it seems strange that the\r\nSocialist Party, if it does not advocate such doctrines of violence,\r\nshould sell these pamphlets at $6 per 100, according to a price list of\r\nits national office in Chicago.\r\n\r\nTo make matters still worse for the apologists of the Socialist Party of\r\nAmerica, no less a personage than Eugene V. Debs commented as follows,\r\nin the \"International Socialist Review,\" February, 1912, on the\r\ndoctrines of Haywood and Bohn just referred to:\r\n\r\n     \"We have here a matter of tactics upon which a number of comrades\r\n     of ability and prominence have sharply disagreed. For my part, I\r\n     believe the paragraph to be entirely sound. Certainly all\r\n     Socialists knowing how and to what end capitalist property rights\r\n     are established, must hold such rights in contempt.... As a\r\n     revolutionist I can have no respect for capitalist property laws,\r\n     nor the least scruple about violating them. I hold all such laws to\r\n     have been enacted through chicanery, fraud and corruption, with the\r\n     sole end in view of dispossessing, robbing and enslaving the\r\n     working class. But this does not imply that I propose making an\r\n     individual law breaker of myself, and butting my head against the\r\n     stone wall of existing property laws. That might be called force,\r\n     but it would not be that. It would be mere weakness and folly. If I\r\n     had the force to overthrow these despotic laws, I would use it\r\n     without an instant's hesitation or delay, but I haven't got it, so\r\n     I am law abiding under protest--not from scruple--and bide my\r\n     time.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Appeal to Reason,\" Girard, Kansas, September 2, 1911, there is\r\nan excellent specimen of one of Debs' revolutionary articles, which\r\nreads in part as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Let us arouse the working class and invoke their power to smite\r\n     the conspirators and set our brothers [the McNamaras] free. They\r\n     can be saved in no other way. The lawyers will plead for them to\r\n     deaf ears; organized labor will protest against their taking off in\r\n     vain. We are confronted by a heartless, soulless plutocracy. Let us\r\n     buckle on our armor and fight!... Let us marshal our forces and\r\n     develop our power for the revolt! Let us develop without delay all\r\n     the power we have, and prepare to strike in every way we know how.\r\n     With a general strike we can paralyze the plutocracy from coast to\r\n     coast. Hundreds of thousands will join eagerly and serve loyally in\r\n     the fight. We can stop the wheels, cut off the food supply, and\r\n     compel the plutocrats in sheer terror to sue for peace.... A few\r\n     men may be needed who are not afraid to die. Be ye also ready....\r\n     Let us swear that we will fight to the last ditch, that we will\r\n     strike blow for blow, that we will use every weapon at our command,\r\n     and that we will never surrender! Roll up a united Socialist vote\r\n     in California that will shake the Pacific Coast like an earthquake,\r\n     and back it up with a general strike that will paralyze the\r\n     continent.... Let the sturdy toilers of the Pacific Coast raise the\r\n     Red standard of revolt.\"\r\n\r\nIt was no other than this same Eugene V. Debs, the advocate of violence\r\nand revolution, who on May 17, 1912, was nominated as the presidential\r\nstandard bearer of the Socialist Party. If ever elected, what a fine\r\npresident he would make, this \"poor,\" \"persecuted,\" self-styled\r\n\"flaming-revolutionist,\" now in jail! What an honorable party it must be\r\nthat nominated such a man for the fourth successive time to fill the\r\noffice of the presidency of our country! Indeed it was on the very same\r\nday that the followers of Karl Marx chose Debs as their candidate to\r\nrule the United States that they also declared, in the constitution of\r\ntheir party, that any member who should advocate crime, sabotage or\r\nother methods of violence, as a weapon of the working class to aid it in\r\nits emancipation, should be expelled from membership in the party!\r\n\r\nNever can political Socialists convince the American people of their\r\nsincerity and honesty while they nominate for office men like Debs, send\r\nto Congress representatives like Victor Berger, and choose as members of\r\ntheir national executive committee persons of the stamp of William D.\r\nHaywood. There was no better way for Socialists to convict themselves of\r\nhypocrisy than by retaining in their constitution the clause against\r\nsabotage, referred to above, while at the same time selling at their\r\nNational Office books like \"Industrial Socialism\" and publishing in\r\ntheir papers and magazines articles advocating and approving \"direct\r\naction.\" By their deeds we judge them, and not by their hypocritical\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\"The Call,\" on April 28, 1919, introduces with the following headlines\r\nthe long comment that it makes on the Hart-Nearing debate of April 27th\r\nin New York City: \"Revolution Is Only Solution of World-Wide Unrest,\r\nSays Nearing.\" In the course of the article Scott Nearing's suggestion\r\nof revolt is mentioned: \"As against Professor Hart's proposal of a\r\nLeague of Nations, I suggest revolution.\" The \"New York Times,\" April\r\n28, 1919, commented in part on the debate as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"'Who wants war?' asked Professor Hart. 'Scott Nearing wants war\r\n     and the people who think as he does, want war. Revolution is\r\n     nothing but civil war and we see its result in the Russian\r\n     revolution. Russia passed through three revolutions and is that the\r\n     kind of result we want in order to overthrow what he calls this\r\n     robber nation?'\r\n\r\n     \"A whirlwind of applause marked this and through the applause was\r\n     heard a chorus of voices shouting 'yes.' The meeting cheered\r\n     Nearing's frequent references to 'revolution,' to the Russian\r\n     Soviet Republic and applauded his radical utterances, although he\r\n     had requested that he be permitted to speak without interruption.\r\n     The theatre contained about 3,000 persons who filled all the seats,\r\n     the stage and stood in the aisles, after paying from 25 cents to\r\n     $1.50 admission.\r\n\r\n     \"Judging from the manifestations of approval of Nearing's remarks,\r\n     the large audience appeared to be overwhelmingly composed of\r\n     revolutionary Socialists, and when the speaker declared he believed\r\n     in a League of Socialist Nations the crowd vigorously applauded in\r\n     a way that left no doubt of its sentiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Call\" in its May Day issue, 1919, published an article on\r\npresent-day revolutionary tactics of the Socialists:\r\n\r\n     \"The world revolution, dreamed of as a thing of the distant future,\r\n     has become a live reality, rising from the graves of the murdered\r\n     millions and the misery and suffering of the surviving millions. It\r\n     has taken form, it strikes forward, borne on by the despair of the\r\n     masses and the shining example of the martyrs. Its spread is\r\n     irrepressible. The bridges are burnt behind the old capitalist\r\n     society and its path is forever cut off. Capitalist society is\r\n     bankrupt and the only salvation of humanity lies in the uprising of\r\n     the masses, in the victory of the Socialist revolution, in the\r\n     renovating forces of Socialism.\r\n\r\n     \"The world war which is now about to be officially closed has slid\r\n     into a condition neither war nor peace. However, the war of the\r\n     nations has been followed by the war of the classes. The class\r\n     struggle is no longer fought by resolutions and demonstrations.\r\n     Threateningly it marches through the streets of the great cities\r\n     for life or death.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nPATRIOTISM RIDICULED AND DESPISED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThough it is evident that there can be no patriotism in men who are\r\ndoing their utmost to overthrow our government by stirring up\r\nclass-hatred and inciting rebellion, still most of the citizens of our\r\ncountry have never realized the extent to which Socialists ridicule and\r\ndespise patriotism and abhor its very name.\r\n\r\n\"The Call,\" September 25, 1912, in answering the charge that Socialism\r\nundermines patriotism, says: \"So it does, and is proud of it, if by\r\npatriotism is meant that mawkish sentiment which causes a man, for the\r\nsum of $15 a month, to go out and get himself killed in defense of a\r\ncountry of which he owns not a single foot and can never hope to own\r\nany. If a wage slave is paid only enough to live on, anyhow, what\r\ndifference to him does it make whether his boss is a Britisher or a\r\nChinaman?\"\r\n\r\nThe Socialists often succeed in stirring up violence during strikes to\r\ndevelop the spirit of revolt; then, when it becomes necessary for the\r\nstate to protect the lives and property of its citizens, the lovers of\r\nrebellion and disorder do their utmost to incite hatred and contempt\r\nagainst the soldiers who are sent to preserve order.\r\n\r\nOn February 10, 1912, there appeared in \"The Call\" an article which\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The capitalist class, alarmed at the amazingly rapid growth of\r\n     anti-militarism in this country, is endeavoring, through church and\r\n     government, to combat this just sentiment, and by law and precept\r\n     to create an artificial respect and love for the soldiers' uniform\r\n     and the American flag.\r\n\r\n     \"'Respect the uniform, honor the flag,' is their cry, and they are\r\n     foolish enough to believe that if they raise their voices loud\r\n     enough, we, the workers, will become infected by their fictitious\r\n     enthusiasm, and shout with them.\r\n\r\n     \"'Honor the uniform!' Oh, surely! Honor the trappings and gold lace\r\n     with which they are dressing up their weak-minded scabs! Honor the\r\n     uniform which has the power to transform a decent but ignorant boy\r\n     of the working class into an unthinking savage, who would, if\r\n     ordered to do so by a superior in rank, shoot down his aged father\r\n     or kill his sister's unborn child with a bayonet thrust, should\r\n     they happen to be on strike and crying aloud for a little more\r\n     bread, warmer clothing and better shelter. Honor the uniform? No,\r\n     spit on it! Make it a shame and a reproach until a worker who wears\r\n     it will not dare to show his face among decent working people.\r\n     Honor the uniform! Honor that which gives a free license to kill,\r\n     if the victim happens to be a worker? Honor that which stands for\r\n     oppression, for the loafer against the worker, for the master\r\n     against the slave? Honor that which causes a worker to become a\r\n     traitor to his class, to forget his ties of blood, and for pay to\r\n     deliver himself over body and soul to his natural enemy, the\r\n     capitalist class? Honor the Judases, the Benedict Arnolds of the\r\n     working class? Our masters insult us by even asking such a thing.\r\n\r\n     \"Shall we honor the Massachusetts militiamen who, without the\r\n     slightest provocation, murdered a young worker? Is that what you\r\n     want us to do, you capitalists, you cardinals and presidents? You\r\n     ask too late, for we already despise and loathe your decorated\r\n     hirelings, and are, as time passes, making it more difficult for\r\n     you to recruit our decent boys and transform them into loathsome\r\n     parasites.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 6, 1919, millions of New Yorkers enthusiastically welcomed the\r\n77th Division of our soldier boys on their return home from the\r\nbattle-fields of Europe. Glowing descriptions of the celebration\r\nappeared in nearly all the papers of the Metropolis. A contemptible\r\naccount, however, was published the next day in \"The Call,\" showing the\r\nscornful spirit of the Socialists toward the millions of American troops\r\nwho made so many sacrifices for their country in the late war. The\r\narticle in \"The Call\" runs as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Rows and Rows and Rows and Rows and Rows of 'Em March\r\n\r\n     \"_Folks Cheered 77th Division which Finally Changed From Toys Into\r\n     Folks, Too._\r\n\r\n     \"A row of mounted police rode up Fifth avenue yesterday.\r\n\r\n     \"A man carrying a banner on which were the words and figures, '77th\r\n     Division,' marched up Fifth avenue yesterday.\r\n\r\n     \"A band played all the way up Fifth avenue yesterday.\r\n\r\n     \"A line of soldiers walked up Fifth avenue yesterday.\r\n\r\n     \"A second line of soldiers walked up Fifth avenue yesterday.\r\n\r\n     \"A third line of soldiers walked up Fifth avenue yesterday.\r\n\r\n     \"A fourth line of soldiers walked up Fifth avenue yesterday.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"A soldier carrying a service flag walked up Fifth avenue\r\n     yesterday.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"One soldier wore khaki and carried a steel helmet on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n     \"A second soldier wore khaki and carried a steel helmet on his\r\n     shoulder.\r\n\r\n     \"A third soldier wore khaki and carried a steel helmet on his\r\n     shoulder.\r\n\r\n     \"A fourth soldier wore khaki and carried a steel helmet on his\r\n     shoulder.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"They marched precisely.\r\n\r\n     \"They marched steadily.\r\n\r\n     \"They marched firmly.\r\n\r\n     \"They marched in silence.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"The crowds cheered.\r\n\r\n     \"The crowds waved flags.\r\n\r\n     \"The crowds did not fill the stands.\r\n\r\n     \"The crowds applauded.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"The police kept the waves of humanity back.\r\n\r\n     \"The police did not have much trouble.\r\n\r\n     \"The police permitted the crowd to cheer.\r\n\r\n     \"The police permitted the crowds to wave flags.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"Soldiers of the 77th Division marched up Fifth avenue yesterday,\r\n     and when they had done marching they broke ranks and greeted their\r\n     friends and relatives who had not seen them since they went to war.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"A mother greeted her son with kisses and tears.\r\n\r\n     \"A mother greeted her son with kisses and tears.\r\n\r\n     \"A mother greeted her son with kisses and tears.\r\n\r\n     \"Change the word 'mother' to sweetheart, brother, sister, and keep\r\n     on repeating until 'father' is reached and then change 'kisses and\r\n     tears' to 'smiles and cheers.'\"\r\n\r\nThe hypocritical Socialists at one moment plead for universal peace, the\r\ndesire of nations, and at the next for class hatred. They are trying to\r\nruin our domestic peace and to expose us to the ravages of lawlessness\r\nand crime. By fostering contempt for soldiers and other guardians of the\r\npeace, they not only make it harder for them to fulfil their duties, but\r\nprevent many from joining the army and navy for the defense of our\r\ncountry against foreign and domestic foes.\r\n\r\nOur country at present is well able to defend itself against foreign\r\nattacks, but if our domestic enemies continue to sow the seeds of\r\ndiscord and class hatred among our fellow citizens, it will surely fall,\r\nfor no nation that is divided against itself can stand.\r\n\r\nFrom the very fact that \"The Call\" of February 10, 1912, dared to\r\npublish the following article, showing the intense hatred of its author\r\nfor the Stars and Stripes, our national emblem, the reader can judge for\r\nhimself whether the thousands of unoffended subscribers have the\r\nfaintest spark of patriotism in their hearts:\r\n\r\n     \"'At least honor the flag!' they cry in desperation. 'Honor the\r\n     flag which stands for freedom, equality and fraternity!'\r\n\r\n     \"What flag? The American flag? The Stars and Stripes? The flag\r\n     which floats over every hellhole of mine and mill and prison? The\r\n     flag which floats over station house and barracks whence issue\r\n     police and soldiers to batter down and murder workers exercising\r\n     their constitutional rights of free speech and free assemblage?\r\n     Honor the flag which you, our masters, have changed from a flag of\r\n     liberty into a symbol of the cruelest exploitation and vilest\r\n     oppression of the new civilization?\r\n\r\n     \"If I had been Samuel Gompers when he was reproached by the\r\n     capitalists for placing his foot on the American flag, I should\r\n     have answered: 'Yes, I trampled on it, and, more than that, I spit\r\n     upon your flag, not mine; I loathe the Stars and Stripes, once the\r\n     symbol of liberty for all, but now the stripes represent the bloody\r\n     stripes left by your lash on the back of the worker, and the stars,\r\n     the bullet and bayonet wounds in his breast. To hell with your\r\n     flag!...\r\n\r\n     \"Down with the Stars and Stripes! Run up the red flag of humanity.\"\r\n\r\nNot alone do the members of the rank and file of the Socialist Party\r\nattack the Star Spangled Banner, but even its foremost leaders are\r\nguilty of the same offense. \"The Comrade,\" July, 1904, furnishes us\r\nwith an attack made upon our country's flag by no less a personage than\r\nEugene V. Debs:\r\n\r\n\"Have you a drop of blood in your veins? Has your manhood rotted into\r\ncowardice? Wake up and take your place in the class struggle. For the\r\ndesecration of the flag your leader is in jail. What flag? The flag of\r\nthe capitalist class--the flag that floats over the bull pens of\r\nColorado. The wholesome truths he stamped upon its stripes are your\r\nshame and your masters' crime. Rally to the red flag of international\r\nSocialism, the symbol of the proletarian revolt.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE CONSPIRACY AGAINST OUR COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter is the center of our book, the hub where all the spokes of\r\nevidence focus and unite, clearly revealing the unity, power and purpose\r\nof the Wheel of Revolution which now is rolling through the minds and\r\nwills of American radicals. To make this complex plot simple, it has\r\nbeen analyzed into its parts in the other chapters of \"The Red\r\nConspiracy,\" so that each element may be weighed by itself. In the\r\npresent chapter the results of this analysis are gathered up again, to\r\nshow how all the parts fit into one mechanism; and, with the whole thus\r\nseen as one contrivance, the working of each part being understood, the\r\nplan and purpose of the entire invention stands out as clear as day.\r\n\r\nBut if this chapter is the center of our explanation of \"The Red\r\nConspiracy,\" the center of the thing itself lies elsewhere. The Great\r\nRed Wheel of Proletarian Revolution is an International Wheel, and both\r\nthe hub which unites it and the turning power which moves it are\r\ncentered in the old Russian town of Moscow.\r\n\r\nFrequently in preceding chapters the reader has been impressed by the\r\nfact that the \"Reds\" are guilty of conspiracy against all governments,\r\nincluding that of the United States of America. In the present chapter\r\nwe shall discuss this matter of conspiracy much more in detail and\r\nassemble the proofs in such order and strength that no reasonable man\r\ncan deny the existence of the widespread plot now fast undermining the\r\npillars of our country.\r\n\r\nThe \"Reds\" under one name or another have in the long run proven to be\r\nfar more than evolutionists in the various countries of Europe. Actual\r\nrebellions have shown them to be revolutionists by violence in the\r\nstrictest sense of the word in Russia, Germany, Bavaria, Hungary and\r\neven on one of the islands of far distant Japan. Their activities in\r\nEngland, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Holland, Bulgaria and many\r\nanother foreign land bid fair to give us still further proofs in the\r\nnear future that the \"Reds\" do not intend to wait for success by the\r\nballot, but that, as soon as they consider themselves a sufficiently\r\nstrong and united minority, they will throw off their masks, use rifles\r\nin place of hypocritical words, and work behind barricades instead of\r\nbehind closed meeting doors. The Italian Socialists were about to begin\r\ntheir rebellion when, quite recently, the word came from the Moscow\r\nheadquarters of the International conspirators to wait for a more\r\nopportune moment.\r\n\r\nIt seems quite incredible that the \"Reds\" of our own country, whether\r\nthey be I. W. W.'s, Communists, members of the Communist Labor Party, or\r\nSocialists, should be merely evolutionists, harmless parliamentarians,\r\nwhen their brethren abroad, with whom they so much sympathize, and upon\r\nwhom they look as the saviors of the world and the highest types of\r\nadvanced civilization, are either avowedly attempting to overthrow their\r\ngovernments or else have already done so, and in not a single instance\r\nby means of the ballot. There is an old saying to the effect that we are\r\nknown by the company we keep. Since the American \"Reds\" keep company\r\nwith foreign rebels, it is not to be presumed that the latter are demons\r\nand the former saints.\r\n\r\nFew specific proofs need be given in this chapter to show that the I. W.\r\nW.'s are guilty of conspiracy against the United States Government, for\r\na great part of them, especially those most active, belong either to the\r\nCommunist, Communist Labor or the Socialist Party, and an abundance of\r\nproofs will be given that these latter organizations are far from being\r\nharmless and innocent political parties.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the I. W. W.'s, in their revolutionary \"Preamble\" and by the\r\nmany utterances of their leaders, are openly committed to a conspiracy\r\nof violence against our Government. Relative to the I. W. W. and its\r\nunderhand activities, the reader will remember the words of Arturo\r\nGiovannitti, quoted in a previous chapter, from the Socialist Labor\r\nParty paper, \"Weekly People,\" New York, February 10, 1912. That writer,\r\nwith all his experience as a leader of the \"Wobblies,\" certainly knew\r\ntheir plans, and makes this astounding admission relative to the part\r\nthat the I. W. W. is expected to take in bringing about the Marxian\r\nrebellion:\r\n\r\n     \"The future of Socialism lies only in the general strike, not\r\n     merely a quiet political strike, but one that once started should\r\n     go fatally to its end, i.e., armed insurrection, and the forcible\r\n     overthrow of all existing social conditions.... The task of\r\n     revolution is not to construct the new society, but to demolish the\r\n     old one, therefore, its first aim should be at the complete\r\n     destruction of the existing state, so as to render it absolutely\r\n     powerless to react and re-establish itself.... The I. W. W. must\r\n     develop itself as the new legislature and the new executive body of\r\n     the land, undermine the existing one, and gradually absorb the\r\n     functions of the state until it can entirely substantiate it\r\n     through the only means it has, the revolution.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1919 a very excellent example of how the One Big Union\r\ntried to develop a strike into a rebellion was given in Winnipeg,\r\nCanada. Some time previously we had in our own country an example in the\r\ngreat strike at Seattle, Washington.\r\n\r\nCases of sabotage, murder and arson are but minor activities of the I.\r\nW. W., and mere circumstances to aid in bringing about the contemplated\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nGovernment raids in recent years, and the seizure of hundreds of tons of\r\ninflammatory literature, from which extensive quotations were made in\r\nthe daily press, have furnished us with ample proofs that the I. W. W.'s\r\nare national conspirators.\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember the vivid picture of the contemplated rebellion\r\nin the mind of the \"Wobbly\" who wrote in \"The Rebel Worker,\" April 15,\r\n1919:\r\n\r\n     \"The United States is in the grip of a bloody revolution! Thousands\r\n     of workers are slaughtered by machine guns in New York City!\r\n     Washington is on fire! Industry is at a standstill and thousands of\r\n     workers are starving! The government is using the most brutal and\r\n     repressive measures to put down the revolution! Disorganization,\r\n     crime, chaos, rape, murder and arson are the order of the day--the\r\n     inevitable results of social revolution!\"\r\n\r\nThe I. W. W.'s are certainly conspirators, and seek the overthrow of our\r\nGovernment by industrial violence, and we were told by \"The Evolution of\r\nIndustrial Democracy,\" page 40, that \"Government, as now understood,\r\nwill disappear--there being no servile class to be held in\r\nsubjection--but in its place will be an administration of affairs.\"\r\n\r\nThe spirit of armed rebellion against our Government was foremost in the\r\nminds of the Left Wing members of the Socialist Party who afterwards\r\nformed the Communist and the Communist Labor Parties. We shall recall\r\nsome of the words of Louis C. Fraina during the great struggle between\r\nthe Rights and Lefts:\r\n\r\n     \"All propaganda, all electoral and parliamentary activity are\r\n     insufficient for the overthrow of Capitalism, impotent when the\r\n     ultimate test of the class struggle turns into a test of power. The\r\n     power for the social revolution issues out of the actual struggles\r\n     of the proletariat, out of its strikes, its industrial unions and\r\n     mass action.\"--\"The Revolutionary Age,\" July 12, 1919.\r\n\r\n     \"Socialism will come not through the peaceful, democratic\r\n     parliamentary conquest of the state, but through the determined and\r\n     revolutionary mass action of a proletarian minority.\"--\"The\r\n     Revolutionary Age,\" July 12, 1919.\r\n\r\n     \"Revolutionary Socialists hold, with the founders of Scientific\r\n     Socialism, that there are two dominant classes in society--the\r\n     bourgeoisie and the proletariat; that between these two classes a\r\n     struggle must go on until the working class, through the seizure of\r\n     the instruments of production and distribution, the abolition of\r\n     the capitalist state, and the establishment of the dictatorship of\r\n     the proletariat, creates a Socialistic system. Revolutionary\r\n     Socialists do not believe that they can be voted into power. They\r\n     struggle for the conquest of power by the revolutionary\r\n     proletariat.\"--\"The Revolutionary Age,\" March 22, 1919.\r\n\r\n\"The Communist,\" of Chicago, April 1, 1919, it will be remembered, in\r\nspeaking of November 7, 1919, the day on which the armistice was signed,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     \"On that day the seething proletariat ruled Chicago by sheer force\r\n     of numbers. One thing alone was needed to give this mass expression\r\n     identity with the proletarian uprisings in Europe--one thing, the\r\n     revolutionary idea.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the formation of the Communist and Communist Labor parties, in\r\nSeptember, 1919, both made great progress in winning recruits to the\r\ncause of armed rebellion. On January 2, 1920, government agents all over\r\nthe country suddenly descended upon the conspirators and took thousands\r\nof them prisoners. Bombs, rifles and other weapons were captured by the\r\ndepartment agents. In Newark 25 rifles and a large number of bombs were\r\ntaken, many tons of violent literature were seized and innumerable\r\nquotations from it appeared in the daily press, showing beyond the\r\nshadow of a doubt the evil intentions of these \"Reds\" against the land\r\nthat we love.\r\n\r\nThe Communist Party of America and the Communist Labor Party have the\r\nsame purposes and aims as the Communist Party of Russia. They are joined\r\nwith the latter in advocating and supporting the manifesto of the Third\r\nInternational, which openly urges an armed revolution to bring about the\r\noverthrow of the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nBoth parties have conducted effective propaganda work through\r\nnewspapers, books, pamphlets and other means. The Communist Party alone\r\nhad twenty-five newspapers printed in several languages, actively\r\nsupporting its cause. This number was being increased weekly, papers\r\nwhich were formerly Socialist Party organs going over to its support.\r\nThe alien editors of most of these papers were taken by the Department\r\nof Justice agents in the raids.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Justice naturally was most vitally interested in the\r\npromises of violence against the United States Government contained in\r\nthe manifesto of the Communists of the Third International, which was\r\nheld at Moscow, March 2 to 6, 1919. Among the passages in the Moscow\r\nmanifesto which most interested the Department of Justice were the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n     \"Socialist criticism has sufficiently stigmatized the bourgeois\r\n     world order. The task of the International Communist Party is now\r\n     to overthrow this order and to erect in its place the structure of\r\n     the Socialist world order. We urge the workingmen and women of all\r\n     countries to unite under the Communist banner, the emblem under\r\n     which the first victories have already been won.\r\n\r\n     \"Proletarians of all lands! In the war against imperialistic\r\n     barbarity, against monarchy, against the privileged classes,\r\n     against the bourgeois state and bourgeois property, against all\r\n     forms and varieties of social and national oppression--unite!\r\n\r\n     \"Under the standard of the Workingmen's Councils under the banner\r\n     of the Third International, in the revolutionary struggle for power\r\n     and the dictatorship of the proletariat, proletarians of all\r\n     countries--unite!\"\r\n\r\nThe manifesto is signed by Lenine, Trotzky and other revolutionaries.\r\nSeveral references are made to the United States, indicating this\r\ncountry as one of the objectives of the revolutionaries. Describing the\r\nmethods to be used, the manifesto says:\r\n\r\n     \"Civil war is forced upon the laboring classes by their arch\r\n     enemies. The working class must answer blow for blow, if it will\r\n     not renounce its own object and its own future, which is at the\r\n     same time the future of all humanity.\r\n\r\n     \"The Communist parties, far from conjuring up civil war,\r\n     artificially, rather strive to shorten its duration as much as\r\n     possible--in case it has become an iron necessity--to minimize the\r\n     number of its victims, and above all to secure victory for the\r\n     proletariat.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the caption, \"The Way to Victory,\" the manifesto says:\r\n\r\n     \"The revolutionary era compels the proletariat to make use of the\r\n     means of battle which will concentrate its entire energies, namely,\r\n     mass action, with its logical resultant, direct conflict with the\r\n     governmental machinery in open combat. All other methods, such as\r\n     revolutionary use of bourgeoisie parliamentarism, will be of only\r\n     secondary significance.\"\r\n\r\nThe principles of the American Communist Party set forth in their seized\r\nrecords and made public by the Department of Justice, are:\r\n\r\n     \"The Communist Party of America is the party of the working class.\r\n     The Communists of America propose to end capitalism and organize a\r\n     workers' industrial republic. The workers must control industry and\r\n     dispose of the products of industry.\r\n\r\n     \"The Communist Party is a party realizing the limitations of all\r\n     existing workers' organizations and purposes to develop the\r\n     revolutionary movement necessary to free the workers from the\r\n     oppression of capitalism. The Communist Party insists that the\r\n     problems of the American worker are identical with the problems of\r\n     the workers of the world.\r\n\r\n     \"The Communist Party is the conscious expression of the class\r\n     struggle of the workers against capitalism. Its aim is to direct\r\n     this struggle to the conquest of political power, the overthrow of\r\n     capitalism and the destruction of the bourgeois state.\r\n\r\n     \"The Communist Party prepares itself for the revolution in the\r\n     measure that it develops a program of immediate action expressing\r\n     the mass struggles of the proletariat. These struggles must be\r\n     inspired with revolutionary spirit and purposes.\r\n\r\n     \"The Communist Party is fundamentally a party of action. It brings\r\n     to the workers a consciousness of their oppression, of the\r\n     impossibility of improving their condition under capitalism. The\r\n     Communist Party directs the workers' struggle against capitalism,\r\n     developing fuller forms and purposes in this struggle, culminating\r\n     in the mass action of the revolution.\r\n\r\n     \"The negro problem is a political and economic problem. The racial\r\n     oppression of the negro is simply the expression of his economic\r\n     bondage and oppression, each intensifying the other. This\r\n     complicates the negro problem, but does not alter its proletarian\r\n     character. The Communist Party will carry on agitation among the\r\n     negro workers to unite them with all class conscious workers.\"\r\n\r\nLittle need be added concerning the Communist Labor Party. As its\r\nmanifesto and program are practically identical with those of the\r\nCommunist Party of America, while all its members are likewise\r\naffiliated with the Third or Moscow International, the foregoing\r\ncharacterization of the Communist Party applies without essential\r\nmodification to the Communist Labor Party. The identical character of\r\nthese two parties was asserted by A. Mitchell Palmer, Attorney-General\r\nof the United States, in a statement given out January 23, 1920, and\r\nprinted in the \"New York Times\" of the next day, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"These two organizations are identical in aim and tactics, the\r\n     cause for their separate existence being due to the desire of\r\n     certain individuals connected with the so-called Left Wing elements\r\n     of the Socialist Party to be leaders. For the sake of convenience I\r\n     shall refer to members of the Communist Party of America and the\r\n     Communist Labor Party as 'Communists.'\"\r\n\r\nAttorney-General Palmer then quotes from the manifesto of the Third\r\nInternational, adopted March 6, 1919, at Moscow, to show, as he says,\r\n\"that their sole and intimate aim was to accomplish not only the\r\nconquest but the destruction of the idea of the 'State,' as understood\r\nby loyal American citizens,\" and that \"this destruction was not to be\r\naccomplished by parliamentary action, for it is specifically stated that\r\nit is to be by armed conflict with governmental authority.\" The\r\nAttorney-General's statement then continues:\r\n\r\n     \"It is this manifesto which was adopted by the Communist parties in\r\n     the United States as their program of action....\r\n\r\n     \"In the program of the Communists in the United States we find such\r\n     statements as the following:\r\n\r\n     \"'Communism rejects the conception of the State; it rejects the\r\n     idea of class reconstruction and the parliamentary conquest of\r\n     capitalism....\r\n\r\n     \"'The objective is the conquest by the proletariat of the power of\r\n     the State. Communism does not propose to capture the bourgeois\r\n     parliament of any State, but to conquer and destroy it.'\r\n\r\n     \"We thus find stated in very clear and plain language the fact that\r\n     the aim of the Communists of America is for the destruction of the\r\n     government. This shows clearly that the organizations of Communists\r\n     in this country aim, not at the change of government of the United\r\n     States by parliamentary or political methods, but in the overthrow\r\n     and the destruction of the same by mass and direct action, by force\r\n     and violence.\r\n\r\n     \"Another point of particular significance to which I feel I should\r\n     call your attention, is the fact that the organizations of\r\n     Communists in the United States are pledged to destroy the great\r\n     and loyal labor organization of America, namely, the American\r\n     Federation of Labor, which, according to the Communist Party of\r\n     America is considered to be reactionary and a bulwark of\r\n     capitalism. Another particularly significant pledge of the\r\n     Communists of America is to carry on agitation of the negro workers\r\n     of America.\"\r\n\r\nThe I. W. W.'s and the members of the Communist and Communist Labor\r\nparties are all openly confessed conspirators against the United States\r\nGovernment. The members of the Socialist Party are just as bad, and\r\nworse, for they are hypocrites, besides being conspirators.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists, as we have seen in a former chapter, have for many years\r\ngiven unlimited support to the I. W. W., knowing full well that it was\r\nan organization pledged to revolution by violence.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists, moreover, are heart and soul in favor of the Bolsheviki\r\nof Russia, who have issued the manifesto of their International\r\nexpressly to stir up revolutions by violence in all countries, including\r\nour own. The Socialists of the United States call themselves Bolsheviki,\r\nare spreading the doctrines of the Bolshevists of Russia and openly\r\nadmit that Bolshevism and Socialism are identical.\r\n\r\nUntil very recently the Socialist Party nursed within its bosom about\r\n70,000 dues-paying members, out of 109,586, who went over to the\r\nCommunist and Communist Labor parties. Hence, at least till lately,\r\nnearly two-thirds of its membership consisted of avowed rebels. Has it\r\nchanged since the break with the Communists? No, not at all. It is just\r\nas bad as ever, only more hypocritical, more prudent and biding its time\r\nso as not to start a premature revolt. After the wholesale arrests of\r\nthe members of the Communist and the Communist Labor parties on January\r\n2, 1920, the Publicity Department of the Socialist Party, 220 South\r\nAshland Boulevard, Chicago, said: \"The Socialist Party herewith raises\r\nits voice in emphatic and solemn protest against these activities on the\r\npart of the hot-headed and overzealous guardians of the safety of the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nNow listen once more to the words of Morris Hillquit, who poses before\r\nthe public as in a different class from the American Communists and\r\nCommunist Laborites. In \"The Call,\" May 21, 1919, in a long article in\r\nlarge type covering half the editorial page, Morris Hillquit said of the\r\n\"Left Wing\" movement: \"I am one of the last men in the party to ignore\r\nor misunderstand _the sound revolutionary impulse_ which animates the\r\nrank and file of this new movement, but the specific form and direction\r\nwhich it has assumed, its program and tactics, spell disaster to our\r\nmovement. I am opposed to it, _not because it is too radical_, but\r\nbecause it is _essentially reactionary_ and non-Socialistic; _not\r\nbecause it would lead us too far_, but because it would lead us nowhere.\r\nTo prate about the dictatorship of the proletariat and of workers'\r\nSoviets in the United States _at this time_ is to deflect the\r\nSocialistic propaganda from its realistic basis, and to advocate the\r\nabolition of all social reform planks in the party platform means to\r\nabandon _the concrete class struggle_ as it presents itself from day to\r\nday.\" (Italics mine.)\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of this crafty, go-slow policy is now apparent, with the\r\n\"Left Wing\" leaders in jail, and Hillquit's chameleons now posing as\r\nangels of light, the saviors of \"representative government\" in America.\r\nThe fact that the Socialist Party of America \"goes into politics\" does\r\nnot make it less dangerous than the other revolutionary bodies, but more\r\ndangerous, for it thus expects to have men in political positions to\r\nseize the reins of government when the hour of blood and violence\r\narrives. That this is its definite policy, the meaning of its political\r\nactivity, was apparent as far back as its National Convention of 1908,\r\nwhen, in opposing those who would dismiss the use of the ballot in favor\r\nof \"direct action\"--violence--exclusively, Victor L. Berger said:\r\n\r\n     \"I have no doubt that in the last analysis we must shoot, and when\r\n     it comes to shooting, Wisconsin will be there.... In order to be\r\n     able to shoot even some day we must have the powers of political\r\n     government in our hands, at least to a great extent. I want that\r\n     understood. So everybody who is talking to you about direct action\r\n     and so on, and about political action being a humbug, is your enemy\r\n     today, because he keeps you from getting the powers of political\r\n     government.\" (\"Proceedings of the 1908 National Convention of the\r\n     Socialist Party,\" page 241.)\r\n\r\nIn the \"Social Democratic Herald\" of Milwaukee, July 31, 1909, Berger\r\nwrote: \"It is easy to predict that the safety and hope of this country\r\nwill finally lie in one direction only, that of a violent and bloody\r\nrevolution. Therefore, I say, each of the 500,000 Socialist voters and\r\nof the 2,000,000 workingmen who instinctively incline our way, should,\r\nbesides doing much reading and still more thinking, also have a good\r\nrifle and the necessary rounds of ammunition in his home, and be\r\nprepared to back up his ballot with his bullets if necessary. This may\r\nlook like a startling statement. Yet I can see nothing else for the\r\nAmerican masses today.\" In the same paper, August 14, 1909, he wrote:\r\n\"We should be grateful if the social revolution, if the freeing of\r\n75,000,000 whites, would not cost more blood than the freeing of\r\n4,000,000 negroes in 1861.\"\r\n\r\nThus the Socialist Party of America, under the tutelage and control of\r\nfar-seeing and deep-witted leaders like Hillquit and Berger, is by far\r\nthe most dangerous band of conspirators in the United States. No\r\n\"revolutionary impulse\" is too extreme for Hillquit, no movement is \"too\r\nradical;\" but its \"program and tactics\" must be deep-laid, deceptive,\r\nseizing every present political advantage so that the central power can\r\nbe grasped by astute leadership in one lurch when the hour of \"shooting\"\r\narrives.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic violence of Lenine and Trotzky passed through all the\r\nradical bodies in America like an electric shock, and the enthusiasts\r\nwished to start a ruction right away. But Morris Hillquit was not\r\ncarried off his feet. If the boys were so senseless as to try to seize\r\nthe reins of party government, Hillquit would dismiss them with a\r\nfriendly wave, as in his article, quoted above, in which he also says:\r\n\"There is, as far as I can see, but one remedy. It would be futile to\r\npreach reconciliation and union where antagonism runs so high. Let the\r\nComrades on both sides do the next best thing. Let them separate,\r\nhonestly, freely, and without rancor. Let each side organize and work in\r\nits own way, and make such contribution to the Socialist movement in\r\nAmerica as it can.\" If the \"contribution\" of the boys should really turn\r\nout to be a successful general strike and overturn, who would be better\r\nable to grasp the power than an astute leader like Hillquit?\r\n\r\nThis book was written before the Judiciary Committee of the New York\r\nAssembly began its inquiry, in January, 1920, into the fitness of five\r\nSocialist Assemblymen to act as law-makers, and since then has only\r\nreceived the addition of some important facts and testimony. It is\r\nremarkable, therefore, that all the evidence independently sifted in\r\nthat investigation overwhelmingly points to the same conclusions arrived\r\nat in this volume.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, 1920, at the second day's hearing at Albany, as reported\r\nin the \"New York Times\" of January 22, John B. Stanchfield and Martin W.\r\nLittleton, of counsel for the Judiciary Committee, stated the\r\nfundamental nature of the charges brought against the five suspended\r\nSocialists--charges based, as is well known, on the results of raids and\r\ninvestigations of radicalism by the New York State Legislative\r\nCommittee, Senator Lusk, Chairman. Said Mr. Stanchfield:\r\n\r\n     \"When the Chairman read from the statement yesterday that the\r\n     charge against these men was disloyalty, and that they had\r\n     affiliated themselves with a party whose platform and program call\r\n     for an overthrow of this Government by violence, he added that we\r\n     will prove this beyond the shadow of a doubt.\r\n\r\n     \"We are not upon this investigation engaged in a discussion of the\r\n     philosophy of Socialism or its economics. We are engaged in an\r\n     investigation of its tactics, its methods, its practical program,\r\n     and these tactics, these methods, and that program called for the\r\n     overturn of the power of this State and its annihilation, its utter\r\n     and complete annihilation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Littleton said:\r\n\r\n     \"The representation with reference to what these five men did and\r\n     what they profess and what they engaged to do stands out as plainly\r\n     as any thing can stand out--that they gave their allegiance wholly\r\n     and solely to an alien and invisible empire known as the\r\n     Internationale. It stands out that they are the citizens, not in\r\n     reality of the country which sustains and maintains them, but they\r\n     are citizens of this invisible empire which projects itself as a\r\n     revolutionary force into every country, menacing its institutions\r\n     and threatening its overthrow. Their allegiance before they ever\r\n     entered upon the threshold of this chamber was given to this\r\n     empire, which masquerades at one time with the softness of\r\n     parliamentary reform and which declares itself in favor of\r\n     revolution with force, according to the place and time where it may\r\n     so declare.\r\n\r\n     \"It is that alien state, people of alien races--pledged to the\r\n     destruction of this Government and its institutions--that the\r\n     charges say that these men belong to and act with....\r\n\r\n     \"Perhaps at a later day in this proceeding we will ascertain the\r\n     specific program to which they pledged themselves, the program of\r\n     Mr. Lenine and Mr. Trotzky, not to reform Russia--that is a\r\n     misconception and a misdirection; it is not that Lenine and Trotzky\r\n     are trying to reform Russia or change Russia, it is that Lenine and\r\n     Trotzky, acting through these agencies, are proposing the\r\n     installation of the same kind of government in constitutional\r\n     America that they have inaugurated in Russia, and these are the\r\n     agents and the instructors, according to the charge, to carry out\r\n     that program.\r\n\r\n     \"It is quite a different thing from expressing your sympathy in a\r\n     convention for downtrodden Russia. It is a little different\r\n     program, Mr. Chairman, and the evidence in this case will disclose\r\n     that these members, in conjunction with that party, have tied\r\n     themselves irrevocably to the program.\r\n\r\n     \"So that charge involves, I should say, a grave question as to\r\n     whether these men, pledged to an alien empire to carry out an alien\r\n     policy and to do it masquerading as a political party, shall be\r\n     members of that Assembly and can take the oath of office.\r\n\r\n     \"Our ideals are the embodiment of the Constitution which these men\r\n     ought to have been able to take the oath to and support. No alien,\r\n     invisible empire, having one corner of it resting in the heart of\r\n     Soviet Russia, another corner of it resting upon the shoulders of\r\n     the Spartacides in Germany, and another resting somewhere else, you\r\n     swore allegiance to, but to this country and this standard and no\r\n     other country or standard--that is the ideal which we take the oath\r\n     for and undertake to support.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, with that situation, here is an Assembly organized under the\r\n     ideals of that country and under its Constitution, and the question\r\n     here is, Can that Assembly inquire into whether or not five of its\r\n     members are disloyal to the country have foresworn themselves and\r\n     given their allegiance to an alien and an invisible empire, and\r\n     placed themselves in the hands of a master who can withdraw them\r\n     from this Assembly when he chooses? Can such a deliberative body as\r\n     this make that inquiry, and, finding the fact out, can it expel\r\n     that agency from this body before the poison has contaminated the\r\n     system?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Littleton here took up the charge that the five Socialist\r\nAssemblymen, before taking office, had placed their resignations in the\r\nhands of their party leaders, or their local organizations, to be used\r\nto withdraw them from office should they fail to carry out their party's\r\nbehest. He continued:\r\n\r\n     \"What is the charge here? That these men, belonging to the\r\n     invisible empire of the Internationale, whose agents may be violent\r\n     or peaceable, according as the law allows, and according as they\r\n     may escape, are here acting as agents of Lenine and Trotzky, not to\r\n     establish a Soviet Republic under the rotten ruins of an infamous\r\n     democracy, but to establish a Soviet Republic on the ruins of a\r\n     Constitution to which every man is pledged by every ounce of his\r\n     blood and by that solemn vow which he registered in heaven when he\r\n     entered on the duties of his office.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Chairman, before this investigation is over and before the\r\n     waves which have been stirred, the waves of public opinion, have\r\n     subsided, I make no threat, but I make a prediction, that this\r\n     country will understand that this so-called political party,\r\n     masquerading as a political party, is the agent and the\r\n     co-conspirator with the dark forces of this invisible empire whose\r\n     object is the forcible destruction of constitutional government in\r\n     America.\r\n\r\n     \"I say this question, before it is over, will arouse this country.\r\n     It will not be a tempest in the teapot. It will be a question as to\r\n     whether they can hypocritically masquerade as a political party,\r\n     and strike hands with every agency of force and revolution, and\r\n     still make simple American people understand they are not sworn\r\n     enemies of their country and ready to overthrow it.\"\r\n\r\nThe power of the \"invisible empire\" established by Lenine and Trotzky\r\ncan be traced in the quotations in this book as a great dramatic energy\r\nwhich has seized and dragged into its vortex one after another of the\r\nradical organizations in the United States until none are now left out,\r\nand some even of the comparatively conservative trades union bodies\r\nappear to be trembling on the verge of peril. The evil fascination of\r\nthe blood-reign of Lenine and Trotzky has been most remarkably evident\r\nin the Socialist Party of America, and precisely so because an element\r\nin this organization developed a strong power of resistance--only to\r\nsuccumb at last.\r\n\r\nThe story of this struggle is told in Chapters III to V of this work,\r\nwhere we see the Moscow Magnet dragging one section so much more rapidly\r\nthan the rest moved that the Socialist Party at first stretched out into\r\ntwo wings, the Left and the Right, and then exploded into three parts,\r\nthe Communist Labor Party, the Communist Party of America and that which\r\nstill calls itself the Socialist Party of America.\r\n\r\nWe cannot forget the significant statement by Morris Hillquit in the\r\n\"New York Call\" after the Chicago Emergency Convention of September,\r\n1919. This was put in evidence against the Socialist Party of America\r\nduring the trial before the New York Assembly's Judiciary Committee and\r\nappeared in the \"New York Herald\" of January 29, 1920. Hillquit's letter\r\nin the \"Call\" raised the question, \"What shall be the attitude of the\r\nSocialist Party toward the newly formed Communist organization?\" In\r\nanswering this question Hillquit used the following remarkable\r\nexpressions:\r\n\r\n     \"The division _was not brought about by differences on vital\r\n     questions of principles_. It arose over disputes on methods and\r\n     policy. The separation of the Socialist Party into three\r\n     organizations _need not necessarily mean a weakening of the\r\n     Socialists_.... Our quarrel is a _family_ quarrel, and has no room\r\n     in the columns of the capitalistic papers.... We have had our\r\n     split.... Now we are through with it. Legitimate constructive work\r\n     of the Socialist movement is before us. Let us give it all of our\r\n     time, energies and resources. Let us center our whole fight upon\r\n     capitalism, and let us hope _our Communist brethren_ will go and do\r\n     likewise.\" (Italics mine.)\r\n\r\nThe difference, then, is not at all one of \"principles,\" but only one of\r\n\"methods and policy,\" that is, of cunning in putting on disguises; and\r\nin this we concede that the Socialist Party of America is greatly\r\nsuperior to its \"Communist brethren.\"\r\n\r\nAnother evidence of this cunning, brought out at the trial of the\r\nSocialist Assemblymen in January, 1920, bears directly upon the\r\nconspiratory character of the Socialist Party's policy of \"political\r\naction.\" According to the \"New York Evening Sun,\" January 22, 1920, the\r\nfollowing from the Socialist Party's New York State Constitution was put\r\nin evidence:\r\n\r\n     \"All candidates or appointees to public office selected by the\r\n     dues-paying membership of the Socialist Party of the State of New\r\n     York, or any of its subdivisions, shall sign the final resignation\r\n     blank before nomination is made official or appointment is made\r\n     final.\"\r\n\r\nThe form of resignation, also put in evidence, is here reproduced from\r\nthe same issue of the \"Evening Sun\":\r\n\r\n     \"To the end that my official acts may at all times be under the\r\n     direction and control of the party membership, I hereby sign and\r\n     place in the hands of Local (........) my resignation to any office\r\n     to which I may be elected (or appointed), such resignation to\r\n     become effective whenever a majority of the local shall so vote. I\r\n     sign this resignation voluntarily as a condition of receiving said\r\n     nomination, and pledge my honor as a man and Socialist to abide by\r\n     it.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the by-laws of the New York County organization put in evidence\r\nalso reads:\r\n\r\n     \"On accepting a nomination of the party for public office, the\r\n     candidate shall at once give to the executive committee a signed\r\n     resignation of the office for which he is nominated, and shall\r\n     assent in writing to its being filed with the proper authority, if,\r\n     in case of election, he proves disloyal to the party.\"\r\n\r\nA protest had been made to the New York Assembly claiming that \"the\r\nfundamental principles of representative government\" would be violated\r\nin refusing to seat the five suspended Socialist Assemblymen. But it is\r\nplain that men controlled in office by such a secret device would not\r\nreally represent their districts, nor those who voted for them, but only\r\nthe members of the dues-paying locals or the executive committee holding\r\ntheir resignations; and in cases of some of the suspended Socialists it\r\nwas said that of the votes they received not one in ten nor even one in\r\ntwenty had been cast by a dues-paying Socialist. At the trial Morris\r\nHillquit, of counsel for the defense, tried to break the force of this\r\ndamaging evidence by getting in testimony \"that this provision of the\r\nState Constitution has been a dead letter since its inception.\" (New\r\nYork \"Evening Sun,\" January 22, 1920.) But this hypocrisy was thoroughly\r\nexposed by the testimony given on January 28, 1920, by George R. Lunn,\r\nDemocratic Mayor of Schenectady, who had been a candidate for that\r\noffice three times as a Socialist. The following summary of his\r\ntestimony is from the \"New York Sun\" of January 29, 1920:\r\n\r\n     \"The outstanding features of Mayor's Lunn's testimony were his\r\n     statements that on the night before election in 1911, when he was\r\n     running for Mayor on the Socialist ticket, two members of the party\r\n     went to his home and presented a blank resignation for his\r\n     signature. This, he said, he signed in order to 'avoid a squabble,'\r\n     although he considered it 'child's play and illegal.' He refused,\r\n     he said, in 1913 to sign the required resignation before the\r\n     election. This time he was defeated. In 1915, he testified, he was\r\n     again nominated and elected, after repudiating that part of the\r\n     Socialist Constitution which bound him to follow the dictates of\r\n     his party leaders. The result, he said, was that the State\r\n     organization revoked the charter of the entire Schenectady local in\r\n     order to discipline him.\"\r\n\r\nIn a ninety-page brief, submitted to members of the New York Assembly on\r\nFebruary 12, 1920, by counsel of the Judiciary Committee, after five\r\nweeks of investigating the qualifications of the suspended Socialist\r\nAssemblymen, Attorney-General Charles D. Newton and the other signers\r\nsaid that the five Socialists by \"their promise ... to place their\r\nresignations in the hands of the dues-paying members ... abdicated their\r\nfunctions as Assemblymen and disqualified themselves from taking the\r\noath of office and rendered their oath false.\" (\"New York Times,\"\r\nFebruary 13, 1920.)\r\n\r\nThe same brief, according to the \"Times\" of above date, says:\r\n\r\n     \"A decent regard for the Assembly as the popular representative\r\n     house of the State requires that these five Assemblymen be excluded\r\n     from their seats. They have taken a false oath to secure seats\r\n     which they cannot occupy as gentlemen, patriots, loyal citizens or\r\n     Assemblymen. They come here under the false pretense of being loyal\r\n     to their Government, when in fact they are really citizens of the\r\n     Internationale, and desire above all things the destruction of this\r\n     Government.\"\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Party of America is also denounced by the same brief on\r\nthree other counts, which the \"New York Times\" of February 13, 1920,\r\nthus summarizes:\r\n\r\n     \"The Socialist Party is a revolutionary party, having the single\r\n     purpose of destroying our institutions and Government, which they\r\n     abhor, and substituting the Russian Soviet Government or the\r\n     proletariat Government instead to be controlled by themselves. This\r\n     appears from their platforms and propaganda.\r\n\r\n     \"The Socialist Party is not a national party, like the Democratic\r\n     Party or the Republican Party, whose aim is to conserve and\r\n     preserve the nation. The Socialist Party is an anti-national party\r\n     whose allegiance is given to the Internationale and not to the\r\n     United States, whose Government and institutions it would destroy.\r\n\r\n     \"'Mass action' and the 'general strike' are advocated and urged by\r\n     the Socialist Party as a part of the plan to bring about conditions\r\n     favorable to revolution, and as instruments of revolution, and not\r\n     to remedy industrial evils. The revolutionary purpose and\r\n     non-political character of such acts make them treasonable, and,\r\n     whether criminal or not in the absence of such purpose, treasonable\r\n     with it.\"\r\n\r\nThis last point, the attitude of the Socialist Party of America toward\r\n\"mass action\" and the \"general strike,\" is of the utmost importance as\r\nevidence that the Socialist Party stands for seizure of the Government\r\nof the United States by revolutionary violence; for the reader will\r\nrecall abundant proof in this book that it is precisely by means of\r\n\"mass action\" and the \"general strike\" that both of the Communist\r\nparties in this country expect to destroy our existing Government, these\r\n\"instruments of revolution\" being also the very ones recommended by the\r\nCommunist manifesto of the Third (Moscow) International, and the ones\r\nemployed by the I. W. W. in its industrial battles.\r\n\r\nThe Moscow Manifesto, as cited from the copy of it in the \"New York\r\nCall\" of July 24, 1919, gives the Third International's plan of action\r\nfor world revolution in a nutshell:\r\n\r\n     \"The revolutionary epoch demands that the proletariat should employ\r\n     such fighting methods as will concentrate its entire energy, viz.,\r\n     the method of mass action, and lead to its logical consequence--the\r\n     direct collision with the capitalist state machine in an open\r\n     combat. All other methods, e.g., revolutionary use of bourgeois\r\n     parliamentarism will in the revolution have only a subordinate\r\n     value.\"\r\n\r\nIt is very significant, therefore, that the Socialist Party of America\r\ndefinitely committed itself to these tactics in the manifesto it adopted\r\nat the Chicago Emergency Convention on September 4, 1919. As given in\r\nthe \"Call\" of September 5, 1919, the manifesto of the Socialist Party of\r\nthe United States says on this point:\r\n\r\n     \"The great purpose of the Socialist Party is to wrest the\r\n     industries and the control of the Government of the United States\r\n     from the capitalists and their retainers. It is our purpose to\r\n     place industry and government in the control of the workers with\r\n     hand and brain, to be administered for the benefit of the whole\r\n     community.\r\n\r\n     \"To insure the triumph of Socialism in the United States the bulk\r\n     of the American workers must be strongly organized politically as\r\n     Socialists, in constant, clear-cut and aggressive opposition to all\r\n     parties of the possessing class. They must be strongly organized in\r\n     the economic field on broad industrial lines, as one powerful and\r\n     harmonious class organization, co-operating with the Socialist\r\n     Party, and ready in cases of emergency to reinforce the political\r\n     demands of the working class by industrial action.\r\n\r\n     \"To win the American workers from their ineffective and\r\n     demoralizing leadership, to educate them to an enlightened\r\n     understanding of their own class interests, and to train and assist\r\n     them to organize politically and industrially on class lines, in\r\n     order to effect their emancipation, that is the supreme task\r\n     confronting the Socialist Party in America.\r\n\r\n     \"To this great task, without deviation or compromise, we pledge all\r\n     our energies and resources. For its accomplishment we call for the\r\n     support and co-operation of the workers of America and of all other\r\n     persons desirous of ending the insane rule of capitalism before it\r\n     has had the opportunity to precipitate humanity into another\r\n     cataclysm of blood and ruin.\r\n\r\n     \"Long live the International Socialist Revolution, the only hope of\r\n     the suffering world!\"\r\n\r\nSo culminates and ends this 1919 national convention manifesto of the\r\nSocialist Party of America. This dedication of that party to the\r\n\"supreme task\" of \"strongly organizing\" the \"bulk of the American\r\nworkers\" into \"one powerful and harmonious class organization\" in order\r\nthat \"industrial action\" may \"reinforce the political demands of the\r\nworking class,\" adds greatly to the significance of some testimony by\r\nleading Socialists in the inquiry of the New York Assembly's Judiciary\r\nCommittee at Albany. On January 30, 1920, Algernon Lee, educational\r\ndirector of the Rand School and secretary of the New York County\r\nCommittee of the Socialist Party, was sworn and testified as follows,\r\naccording to the \"New York Herald\" of January 31, 1920:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Lee ... described at length what Socialists mean by direct\r\n     mass action and the general strike. He said the general strike had\r\n     been used with some degree of success in Russia and Belgium....\r\n     'The general strike is often used to back up political action,' the\r\n     witness said. He justified combining economic strikes as a\r\n     political weapon....\r\n\r\n     \"'Let us assume for the moment,' said Mr. Conboy, 'that these five\r\n     gentlemen whose seats are in question ... should present a\r\n     political program here in the shape of proposed legislation, and\r\n     they were reinforced by the combination in industrial action,\r\n     including within its weapons the general strike. It would be\r\n     possible for them, would it not, in the event that the Legislature\r\n     of this State refused to adopt the movement which they presented\r\n     for adoption by the Legislature, to cripple the industries of the\r\n     State and to starve the people thereof?'\r\n\r\n     \"'I think you are assuming, I may almost say, an impossible\r\n     condition,' replied Mr. Lee, 'that the people should elect an\r\n     overwhelming majority upon one side and then be so overwhelmingly\r\n     organized as to be able to use industrial action on the other\r\n     side.'\"\r\n\r\nBut here Mr. Lee simply concealed the truth behind hypocritical\r\ncamouflage by using the term, \"the people,\" ambiguously. For our people\r\nmight go on as now, conducting constitutional government by\r\nrepresentatives in all their legislatures elected by \"an overwhelming\r\nmajority upon one side,\" while at the same time the underground work\r\nmight go on of \"strongly organizing\" \"the bulk of the American workers\"\r\ninto \"one powerful and harmonious class organization\" ready for\r\n\"industrial action.\" In that case, a \"general strike\" would absolutely\r\nparalyze the whole country, and \"the people\" and all their legislatures\r\nalike would have to surrender absolutely to any demands made upon them,\r\nor would have to engage instantly in such a civil war as the world has\r\nnot yet seen, carried on under conditions of indescribable chaos.\r\n\r\nMoreover the underground work of revolutionary \"industrial organization\"\r\nneed be only partial, need, in fact, be carried on only a little beyond\r\nconditions already actually existing, in order to establish a\r\n\"dictatorship of the proletariat,\" or else terrible civil war, in many\r\nof our American cities by the simple process of calling general strikes.\r\nThe reader who questions this should learn the facts about the Winnipeg\r\ngeneral strike of May 1-June 15, 1919, \"the culmination of the\r\ndevelopment of the One Big Union movement in Canada\" (page 333 of \"The\r\nAmerican Labor Year Book, 1919-1920, edited by Alexander Trachtenberg,\r\nDirector, Department of Labor Research, Rand School of Social Science\"),\r\nwhich held a city of 200,000 terrorized for six weeks under the absolute\r\ndictatorship of a Strike Committee elected by the strikers, while \"many\r\ncities, including Calgary, Edmonton and Toronto, meanwhile joined the\r\ngeneral strike in sympathy with Winnipeg.\" (Ibid., page 334.)\r\n\r\nThe strikers included the employees of the fire, water supply, health,\r\nstreet cleaning, light and power, transportation, telegraph, telephone\r\nand postal departments of the city, together with the janitors of\r\nbuildings, elevator men, wholesale and retail clerks and the carters and\r\ndeliverers of the stores, railways and express companies, thus cutting\r\noff the city from the rest of the world and even from the supplies and\r\nfacilities within its own bounds except only as the Strike Committee\r\nmade concessions. \"I could have a glass of milk or lunch if I had a\r\nticket from the Strike Committee. Otherwise I couldn't.\" This was the\r\ntestimony of Mr. Robert McKay, of Winnipeg, February 10, 1920, and\r\nprinted in the Albany \"Knickerbocker Press\" of February 11, 1920, from\r\nwhich we take the facts. Even the Winnipeg newspapers failed to appear\r\nafter the first three days of the strike, while the city police also\r\nvoted to strike, but continued on duty under command of the Strike\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nAt length a Citizens' Committee was organized, 100 men at first, which\r\ngrew to 1,000, and even 10,000, Mr. McKay says. \"The regular police was\r\nreplaced by 1,500 special police, assisted by mounted police and\r\nmilitia,\" and \"during the last two weeks there were two riots, in which\r\ntwo persons were shot by the mounted police.\" (Account in Trachtenberg's\r\n\"Year Book,\" above quoted, page 334.) In other words, Winnipeg was only\r\ndelivered by means of rescue from outside and by incipient civil war,\r\nthe ringleaders of the dictatorship being arrested and indicted for\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nYet are there some Americans still so blinded by foolish optimism as to\r\nthink we are in no danger--even at a time when all the \"Reds\" of\r\nAmerica, inflamed by the Third International, are uniting in feverish\r\nhaste to carry \"industrial organization\" to a sufficient state to make\r\nit an instrument for holding up the whole American people? If the false\r\nprophets of optimism pooh-pooh the peril and label intelligent warnings\r\nas \"hysteria,\" will it be the first time in history that this was done\r\nby men of weight and influence in the very shadow of a great, impending\r\nrebellion and down to the very hour of its outbreak?\r\n\r\nMr. Lee's testimony on January 30, 1920, as quoted above, was\r\nvoluntarily supplemented by a statement by Seymour Stedman, of counsel\r\nfor the five Socialist Assemblymen and a prominent Socialist himself,\r\none of the National Executive Committeemen who fought the Left Wing to\r\nkeep the control of the party in 1919. We quote from the report of the\r\ntrial in the \"New York Times\" of January 31, 1920:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Lee was next asked to explain what was meant by the pledge of\r\n     the Socialist anti-war faction to support 'mass action' against\r\n     conscription. He answered that the general strike was included in\r\n     the term 'mass action,' but that the word contemplated other\r\n     methods as well.\r\n\r\n     \"'Is it part of the Socialist Party plans to use the general strike\r\n     to back up political action?'\r\n\r\n     \"'If the circumstances should exist which made that necessary, I\r\n     take it that it would be construed so,' said the witness.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Conboy was unable to pin the witness down to a definition of\r\n     what circumstances would make the Socialists resort to direct\r\n     action. Mr. Stedman interrupted:\r\n\r\n     \"'There was a bill to nationalize the railroads,' he said. 'The men\r\n     went on strike to reinforce their demands. I can see the miners and\r\n     the whole working class going on a strike protesting against the\r\n     Government paralyzing them rather than taking the mine owners by\r\n     the collar. That will be general. If the working class made such a\r\n     demand to reinforce a general political demand for the relaxation\r\n     of such an injunction, the Socialists would stand side by side with\r\n     them everywhere. Personally, I think the mining situation was an\r\n     instance where there should have been a general strike.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is important to emphasize the proofs that the Socialist Party of\r\nAmerica has openly committed itself to the sanction and advocacy of\r\n\"industrial\" violence in furtherance of its avowed intention \"to wrest\r\nindustry and the control of the government of the United States\" from\r\nthe whole American people and place them in the hands of a special\r\nclass. For since the wholesale arrests of \"Reds\" by the Department of\r\nJustice were made, followed by the institution of the inquiry into the\r\nqualifications of the five Socialist Assemblymen at Albany, a new,\r\ngeneral movement became discernible among the radicals, a movement to\r\ndisguise their real principles, camouflage their plan of action and\r\ncarry their propaganda \"under ground.\"\r\n\r\nHillquit, Victor L. Berger and the other shrewd leaders of the Socialist\r\nParty realized early in 1919 that the programs of violence against this\r\ncountry, flaunted openly by the Left Wing leaders, would bring down the\r\nhand of the Government upon the conspirators. As early as April 19,\r\n1919, Julius Gerber, Executive Secretary of the New York Local of the\r\nSocialist Party, in a private letter which we quote from the Left Wing\r\n\"New York Communist.\" May 1, 1919, stated that \"the control of the party\r\nby these irresponsible people will make the party an outlaw\r\norganization, and break up the organization.\"\r\n\r\nYet the call for the Third (Moscow) International had cunningly\r\nclassified the Socialists of the world into three groups, a Right, a\r\nCenter and \"the Revolutionary Left Wing.\" This last group included the\r\nfriends of Moscow, the elements of the Third International; and those\r\ncredited to it in America, who received invitations to the Moscow\r\nConference of March 2-6, were the Socialist Labor Party, the I. W. W.,\r\nthe Workers' International Industrial Union and \"the elements of the\r\nLeft Wings of American Socialist Propaganda (tendency represented by E.\r\nV. Debs and the Socialist Propaganda League).\" The group of the Right,\r\nthe other extreme, was completely condemned by the Moscow call as\r\n\"avowed social-patriots who, during the entire duration of the\r\nimperialistic war between the years 1914 and 1918 have supported their\r\nown bourgeoisie.\"\r\n\r\nBut the \"Center\" was described as \"represented by leaders of the type of\r\nKarl Kautsky, and who constitute a group composed of ever-hesitating\r\nelements, unable to settle on any determined direction and who up to\r\ndate have always acted as traitors.\" \"In regard to the 'Center,'\" the\r\ncall continues, \"the tactics consist in separating from it the\r\nrevolutionary elements, in criticizing pitilessly its leaders and in\r\ndividing systematically among them the number of their followers.\" The\r\nLeft Wing leaders in America, however, ignoring the recognition of a\r\n\"Center\" in this country, lumped together and designated as the \"Right\"\r\nall their Socialist opponents, the special followers of Hillquit, Victor\r\nL. Berger and the other \"bosses\" of the Socialist Party; but they\r\ncertainly followed the tactics of \"criticizing pitilessly its leaders.\"\r\n(See the Moscow call in Chapter III and the details of the Left Wing\r\nfight in Chapters III, IV and V.)\r\n\r\nThese facts explain the course pursued by Hillquit and his\r\nfellow-leaders. In the first place they had to get rid of the Left Wing\r\nleaders whose \"control of the party\" would make it \"an outlaw\r\norganization and break up the organization.\" This they accomplished by\r\nwholesale expulsions and suspensions, as we have seen in earlier\r\nchapters. But in the second place they had to prepare a sufficiently\r\nstrong public declaration of the real revolutionary principles of their\r\nparty and a sufficiently explicit identification of the party with the\r\nMoscow International to satisfy both the rank and file of their\r\nfollowers and Lenine and Trotzky in Russia, while yet not going far\r\nenough to incriminate themselves with the awakening suspicions of our\r\nNational and State Governments. As a result we have the utterances of\r\nthe Emergency Convention of August-September, 1919, where every\r\ncompromising word was still only a hint of the principles and plan of\r\naction carefully concealed behind it.\r\n\r\nEven so, the leaders soon realized that they had revealed too much of\r\nthe truth for their safety; while the wholesale arrests, indictments and\r\ndeportations of radicals evidently convinced these cunning plotters that\r\nthe old-time disguises and hypocrisies of Hillquit, Victor Berger and\r\nthe other foxes of the party were the only safe tactics for\r\nrevolutionists in America. Thus Ludwig C. A. K. Martens, the Bolshevist\r\n\"ambassador,\" himself led the retreat in his smooth lies to the United\r\nStates Senate Foreign Sub-Committee, to the effect that the dictatorship\r\nin Russia no longer regarded it as necessary to urge those affiliated\r\nwith it in other countries to overthrow the existing governments.\r\nUndoubtedly he had made the American situation perfectly clear to Lenine\r\nand Trotzky.\r\n\r\nThe reappearance of Morris Hillquit in the Assembly case at Albany, on\r\nFebruary 17, 1920, and his appearance on the witness-stand as \"an expert\r\non Socialism,\" was a similar attempt to repair the breaches with\r\ncamouflage. It was his part with an amused smile to show that\r\n\"industrial organization,\" \"industrial action,\" \"mass action\" and\r\n\"general strikes\" really mean nothing in the Socialist Party's\r\nmanifestoes, platforms and programs, and that his party's affiliation\r\nwith the Third (Moscow) International was a mere meaningless, friendly\r\ngesture. But these party utterances and acts meant all and even more\r\nthan they said to the party's rank and file and confederates.\r\n\r\nIt was brought out in the testimony at Albany on February 10, 1920, that\r\nthe minority report of the Emergency Convention, decreeing affiliation\r\nwith the Moscow International, had been adopted by a referendum vote of\r\nthe party's rank and file, 3,495 votes for to 1,449 against. The wording\r\nof this report, here given in part from Trachtenberg's 1919-20 Labor\r\nYear Book, page 411, is another of those brilliant attempts at\r\ncamouflage for which the \"Yellow\" Socialists are famous:\r\n\r\n     \"Any International, to be effective in this crisis, must contain\r\n     only those elements who take their stand unreservedly upon the\r\n     basis of the class struggle, and their adherence to this principle\r\n     is not mere lip loyalty....\r\n\r\n     \"The Socialist Party of the United States, in principle and in its\r\n     past history, has always stood with those elements of other\r\n     countries that remained true to their principles. The manifestoes\r\n     adopted in national convention at St. Louis (1917) and Chicago\r\n     (1919), as well as Referendum 'D,' 1919, unequivocally affirm this\r\n     stand.[K] These parties, the majority parties of Russia, Italy,\r\n     Switzerland, Norway, Bulgaria and Greece, and growing minorities in\r\n     every land, are uniting on the basis of the preliminary\r\n     convocation, at Moscow, of the Third International. As in the past,\r\n     so in this extreme crisis, we must take our stand with them.\r\n\r\n     \"The Socialist Party of the United States, therefore, declares\r\n     itself in support of the Third (Moscow) International, not so much\r\n     because it supports the 'Moscow' programs and methods, but because:\r\n\r\n     \"(a) 'Moscow' is doing something which is already challenging world\r\n     imperialism.\r\n\r\n     \"(b) 'Moscow' is threatened by the combined capitalist forces of\r\n     the world simply because it is proletarian.\r\n\r\n     \"(c) Under these circumstances, whatever we may have to say to\r\n     'Moscow' afterwards, it is the duty of Socialists to stand by it\r\n     now because its fall will mean the fall of Socialist republics in\r\n     Europe, and also the disappearance of Socialist hopes for many\r\n     years to come.\"\r\n\r\nIf Moscow's \"programs and methods\" are only the minor reason for\r\nsupporting Moscow, what is the major reason for this \"support?\" What is\r\nthe Third (Moscow) International \"doing\" which \"is really challenging\"\r\nthe \"world,\" arraying the \"forces of the world\" against it and thus\r\nmaking its own \"fall\" a serious possibility? We examine (see Chapters\r\nIII and IV and the present chapter) the Third (Moscow) International's\r\ncall to the March, 1919, Conference and the manifesto sent out from it,\r\nand we see what it has done in challenge of the rest of the world. It\r\nhas declared war against the rest of the world and its existing\r\ngovernments, the \"Entente Powers,\" \"The White Terror of the\r\nbourgeoisie,\" as it calls them in the \"Manifesto of the Moscow\r\nInternational\" published in the \"New York Call\" of July 24, 1919, from\r\nwhich we here quote; and against these \"Entente Powers,\" \"The White\r\nTerror,\" the manifesto continues, \"Against this the proletariat must\r\ndefend itself--defend itself at all costs! The Communist International\r\ncalls the whole world-proletariat to this, the final struggle! Down with\r\nthe imperialist conspiracy of capital! Long live the International\r\nRepublic of Proletarian Soviet!\" (Ibid.)\r\n\r\nThus complete identification with this proletarian declaration of war\r\nagainst the \"Entente Powers\" was the major aim of the Socialist Party of\r\nthe United States in voting for affiliation with Moscow. This is the\r\nprincipal ground on which it \"declares itself in support of the Third\r\n(Moscow) International\" and proclaims it to be \"the duty of Socialists\r\nto stand by it now.\" Just as Hillquit differed from the Left Wingers,\r\nnow his \"communist brethren,\" not \"on vital questions of principles,\"\r\nbut only \"on methods and policy,\" opposing their \"movement\" \"not\r\nbecause\" it was \"too radical\" or \"would lead us too far,\" but simply\r\nbecause its \"specific form and direction, ... its program and tactics,\"\r\nwould \"spell disaster,\" so Hillquit's Party supported the Third (Moscow)\r\nInternational \"not so much because\" of its \"programs and methods\" as\r\nbecause what it was \"doing,\" its war-declaration and marshaling of the\r\nworld's proletarian forces against the \"Entente Powers,\" was \"really\r\nchallenging world imperialism.\"\r\n\r\nIs not one mind, one aim, one intent, one purpose and hatred\r\nconsistently evident in all these utterances? And thus we understand the\r\nvehemence of the Chicago Manifesto of September 4, 1919, \"largely based\r\nupon one suggested by Morris Hillquit,\" as the \"Call,\" New York, of\r\nSeptember 5, 1919, says. The following quotation from the Chicago\r\nManifesto, as printed in the \"New York Call\" of September 5, 1919, and\r\nalso in Trachtenberg's Labor Year Book, 1919-1920, pages 413-14, shows\r\nthat the Socialist Party of America completely repudiates the so-called\r\n\"Moderate\" Socialists, and supports the Bolshevist and Communist violent\r\nrevolutionists:\r\n\r\n\"The Socialist Party of the United States at its first national\r\nconvention after the war, squarely takes its position with the\r\nuncompromising section of the international Socialist movement. We\r\nunreservedly reject the policy of those Socialists who supported their\r\nbelligerent capitalist governments on the plea of 'national defense,'\r\nand who entered into demoralizing compacts for so-called civil peace\r\nwith the exploiters of labor during the war and continued a political\r\nalliance with them after the war. We, the organized Socialists of\r\nAmerica, pledge our support to the revolutionary workers of Russia in\r\nthe maintenance of their Soviet Government, to the radical Socialists of\r\nGermany, Austria and Hungary in their efforts to establish working-class\r\nrule in their countries, and to those Socialist organizations in\r\nEngland, Italy and other countries who during the war, as after the war,\r\nhave remained true to the principles of uncompromising international\r\nSocialism.\"\r\n\r\nJust as the Moscow Manifesto cries out, \"Long live the International\r\nRepublic of Proletarian Soviet!\" so does Hillquit's manifesto, adopted\r\nSeptember 4, 1919, by the Socialist Party, \"hold out to the world the\r\nideal of a federation of free and equal Socialist nations.\" A common\r\nzeal for the violent overthrow of the world's existing non-Socialist\r\ngovernments, in order to set up a world-empire of Socialism, is the\r\nmajor feature of the Socialist Party's unity with the Moscow plotters\r\nand incendiaries.\r\n\r\nBut while Moscow's \"programs and methods\" are \"not so much\" the concern\r\nof the American Socialist Party as the \"federation of ... Socialist\r\nnations,\" yet these Moscow \"programs and methods\" are themselves also\r\ndistinctly adopted and enthusiastically followed by the American\r\nSocialists.\r\n\r\nThe Moscow Manifesto (\"New York Call,\" July 24, 1919) lays down two\r\ngreat principles of action, one of _method_, the other of _means_. Here\r\nis the method: \"The revolutionary epoch demands that the proletariat\r\nshould employ such fighting methods as will concentrate its entire\r\nenergy, viz., the method of mass action, and lead to its logical\r\nconsequence--the direct collision with the capitalist state machine in\r\nan open combat. All other methods, e.g., revolutionary use of bourgeois\r\nparliamentarism, will in the revolution have only a subordinate value.\"\r\n\r\nHere is the means: \"A coalition is necessary with those elements of the\r\nrevolutionary workers' movement who, though they did not previously\r\nbelong to the Socialist Party, now, on the whole, take up the standpoint\r\nof the proletarian dictatorship in the form of the power of Soviets,\r\ne.g., _some of the sections among the Syndicalists_.\" (Ibid.)\r\n\r\nThe American \"Syndicalists\" are the I. W. W.'s, and their methods are\r\nthose of \"industrial action\" by means of industrial unionism. In other\r\nwords, they are seeking to organize \"One Big Union\" in order, as the\r\n\"Preamble\" to their Constitution asserts, to \"take possession of the\r\nearth and the machinery of production.\" These are the methods and means\r\nrecommended by the Moscow International to the rabid Socialists\r\naffiliated with it all over the world.\r\n\r\nThese methods and means, urged by the Moscow Manifesto, were evidently\r\nadopted in Hillquit's manifesto, which led, by the party's adoption of\r\nit, to the American Socialist Party's strong commitment of itself at\r\nChicago to \"strongly organize\" on \"industrial lines\" the \"bulk of the\r\nAmerican workers\" into \"one powerful and harmonious class organization\"\r\nready for \"industrial action.\" The preamble to the Constitution, also\r\nadopted at the Emergency Convention of 1919, according to Trachtenberg's\r\nLabor Year Book, 1919-1920, page 410, stresses the same thing:\r\n\r\n     \"The Socialist Party seeks to organize the working-class for\r\n     independent _action_ on the political field, not merely for the\r\n     betterment of their conditions, _but also and above all with the\r\n     revolutionary aim_ of putting an end to exploitation and class\r\n     rule.\" And it adds: \"To accomplish this aim, it is necessary that\r\n     the working-class be powerfully and solidly organized also on the\r\n     economic field _to struggle for the same revolutionary goal_.\"\r\n\r\nTrachtenberg's 1919-1920 Year Book, page 409, tells us, too, that the\r\nparty at its Emergency Convention \"adopted a series of resolutions,\"\r\nincluding two described as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_Co-operatives._--Favoring the establishment of co-operatives and\r\n     recommending that literature be distributed on the subject.\"\r\n\r\n     \"_Economic Organization._--Favoring industrial unionism and\r\n     establishing a labor department in the party for the preparation of\r\n     literature and more active work among the labor unions.\"\r\n\r\nWe know what the last-mentioned resolution means; and the meaning of the\r\npropaganda for \"co-operatives\" becomes plain when we read in\r\nTrachtenberg's same Year Book, page 393, that this co-operative movement\r\nhas been defined as \"The state within a state.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, these two resolutions, favoring propaganda for \"co-operatives\"\r\nand \"industrial unionism,\" seem to be explained in the \"Preamble to the\r\nConstitution of the Socialist Party,\" adopted at Chicago on September 6,\r\n1919. A single sentence in this Preamble, which we quote from\r\nTrachtenberg's Labor Year Book, 1919-1920, page 410, tells us what the\r\nSocialist Party wants and the means by which it hopes to get it. Here is\r\nthe sentence: \"The workers must wrest the control of the government from\r\nthe hands of the masters and use its powers in this upbuilding of the\r\nnew social order, the Co-operative Commonwealth.\"\r\n\r\nNaturally \"co-operatives\" are favored as a step toward the \"Co-operative\r\nCommonwealth,\" which is what the Socialist dreamers want. But in order\r\nto set up this new state, the Socialists want \"the workers\" to do a big\r\njob for them, namely, to \"wrest the control of\" the present Government\r\nof the United States and get it out of the way. Thus \"the workers\" are\r\nthe means, the tool, which the hair-brained Socialists hope to use,\r\nwhile the proposed method of using these \"workers\" is to make Socialists\r\nof them and line them up in one big \"industrial union\" ready for\r\n\"industrial action\" when the Socialists crack the whip. We do not think\r\nAmerica's \"workers\" intend to burn their fingers in pulling Hillquit's\r\nchestnuts out of the fire; but the lazy drones, the Socialist\r\n\"intellectuals,\" as the Hillquitites love to style themselves, certainly\r\nhope to ride into power on the back of American labor just as the\r\nBolshevist \"dictators,\" Lenine and Trotzky, rode into power and are\r\nstill riding on the galled back of the labor slaves of Russia.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that the Socialist Party of America is not merely\r\naffiliated with Moscow's \"programs and methods\" by a referendum vote,\r\nbut has adopted a similar program and method for its own \"supreme task.\"\r\nThe only difference is that the Bolsheviks have made their revolution,\r\nwhile the American Socialists are forging the weapon for theirs. Debs'\r\nmotto is their motto: \"I am law abiding under protest--not from\r\nscruple--and bide my time.\"\r\n\r\nPerceiving the peril of his party, Hillquit, on the witness stand in the\r\nJudiciary Committee's inquiry at Albany, sought in every way to belittle\r\nthe significance of his and his party's Chicago Manifesto, the Moscow\r\nManifesto, and the evident connection between the two, belittling, also,\r\nhis party's affiliation with the Third (Moscow) International. How\r\nunscrupulous and hypocritical his testimony seems in the light of all\r\nthe facts!\r\n\r\nIn his testimony at Albany on February 19, 1920, Hillquit acknowledged\r\nthe Chicago Manifesto, adopted September 4, 1919, as his own child. \"At\r\nleast ninety per cent of it is my authorship,\" he proudly said. Having\r\nhimself imprudently led his party to make open confession, by manifesto,\r\nof its plot \"to wrest the industries and the control of the government\r\nof the United States\" out of their present keeping and so completely\r\ninto the hands of the Socialist Party that it would be able \"to place\"\r\nthem \"in the control of\" a special class, did Hillquit feel that he\r\nwould be justified on the witness stand in using any extreme of craft\r\nwhich might help to bury the plot out of sight again?\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that the Party Manifesto Hillquit wrote sounds\r\nastonishingly like the echo of the Moscow Manifesto, Hillquit, on\r\nFebruary 19, 1920, swore that he had never read the Moscow Manifesto\r\nwhen he wrote his ninety per cent or more of the Chicago Manifesto. To\r\nthis he held even when reminded by Mr. Conboy that all of the Moscow\r\nManifesto but the preamble had appeared in the \"New York Call\" of July\r\n24, 1919. And he still sought to convey the notion that the Moscow\r\nManifesto had not made any particular impression upon the members of\r\nhis party prior to the Emergency Convention of September, 1919, in spite\r\nof the letter read to him by Mr. Conboy, of which the following is an\r\nextract:\r\n\r\n\r\n                        \"SOCIALIST PARTY\r\n                       \"National Office\r\n                \"Executive Secretary: Adolph Germer\r\n                    \"803 West Madison Street\r\n                \"Chicago, Ill., 5/12/1919.\r\n\r\n     \"Local Rochester, C. M. O'Brien,\r\n\r\n     \"580 St. Paul St., Rochester, N. Y.:\r\n\r\n     \"Dear Comrade.--I am pleased to announce the publication of two\r\n     vital documents in pamphlet form, namely, 'The Manifesto Communist\r\n     International,' issued 1919 by the Soviets of Russia at Moscow to\r\n     the toiling masses of the world. This is undoubtedly the greatest\r\n     declaration ever issued from any working class tribunal since the\r\n     Communist Manifesto of Marx and Engels ... the second is 'The\r\n     Constitution World's First Socialist Republic....\r\n\r\n     [Signed] \"Edwin Firth,\r\n\r\n     \"Literature Dept.\"\r\n\r\nBut Hillquit, the great \"expert on Socialism,\" missed reading this\r\n\"vital\" manifesto all the summer of 1919, when the Socialist papers were\r\nfull of it; and yet, by some wild chance, himself composed a close echo\r\nof it!\r\n\r\nThe cowardly \"Reds,\" as we have seen, want a violent revolution and\r\nconstantly preach it to the discontented as boldly and openly as they\r\ndare. But they want America's workingmen to take all the risk and do all\r\nthe work, and they go on with their frantic agitation in the hope that\r\nAmerican labor will some day organize a great \"general strike\" and try\r\nto turn it into a revolution to overthrow the United States Government.\r\nNaturally, therefore, the Socialists get excited whenever any great\r\nlabor strike is on, and they stand as tempters whispering the word\r\n\"revolution\" into the ears of the strikers. Sometimes they get their\r\nsuggestion that the strike be turned into a revolution before the\r\nstrikers' minds by a hypocritical pretense that they are afraid that\r\nwhat they so much long for is likely to happen. Debs, the Socialist\r\nParty's presidential standard-bearer, is a past master in this art of\r\nsuggestion through a pretense of feeling concern, and during the steel\r\nstrike of 1919 he even tried to \"start something\" of this kind from\r\nbehind the bars of his jail. Thus in the form of an interview, sent as\r\na \"special to the 'New York Times,'\" which published it September 24,\r\n1919, he got off the following hypocritically inflammatory comment on\r\nthe steel strike from his place in the Atlanta Federal Prison:\r\n\r\n     \"'I fear that much violence will result from the strike. Then we\r\n     have the potentiality of other unions to consider, for many of\r\n     them, including the miners, who have a crisis coming within a short\r\n     time themselves, as well as the railroad men of the country, who\r\n     have already made demands--these workers and others may be drawn\r\n     into the great steel struggle before it is over, and while I do not\r\n     believe that a prearranged general strike will be called, yet I\r\n     fear the results of great excitement over possible killings like\r\n     those we read about in the papers of today, and it is possible that\r\n     in the heat of passion men may lay down their work and be swept\r\n     into a revolution with cyclonic fury.\r\n\r\n     \"'Anything is possible as an outcome of the present situation,'\r\n     continued the prisoner, 'and should a general strike or revolution\r\n     occur it would be the outcome of too great pressure being brought\r\n     to bear upon the men who, in a state of unrest and industrial\r\n     uncertainty, have reached a highly inflammable condition that might\r\n     burst out spontaneously.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Honest\" Bill Haywood, one of the foremost Socialists of the time,\r\nadmitted as far back as the early part of 1912, in a speech at Cooper\r\nUnion, New York City, that the Socialists were conspirators against the\r\nUnited States Government.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Party of America, ever since its birth, has been reviling\r\nand attacking the Government of the United States with a view to\r\noverthrowing and destroying it. Is it possible that such an organization\r\nis not engaged in a conspiracy against our country?\r\n\r\nThe American Socialists have been thoroughly unpatriotic. \"To hell with\r\nthe American flag!\" \"Down with the Stars and Stripes!\" \"I would spit\r\nupon your flag!\" These are a few of their expressions of contempt. The\r\nUnited States uniform and the soldiers alike are scorned and ridiculed.\r\nThe article in \"The Call,\" \"Rows and Rows and Rows of 'em march,\" which\r\nhas been quoted in a previous chapter, shows the reader the real spirit\r\nand intention of Debs' gang, who have been so zealous in stirring up\r\nstrikes with a view to the final ruin of our present form of government.\r\n\r\nDebs, four times the standard-bearer of the Socialists in presidential\r\ncampaigns, has revealed himself, as we have shown, in such utterances as\r\nthese:\r\n\r\n     \"As a revolutionist, I have no respect for capitalist property\r\n     laws, nor the least scruple about violating them.... I am law\r\n     abiding under protest--not from scruple--and bide my time.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Let the sturdy toilers of the Pacific Coast raise the Red standard\r\n     of revolt.\"\r\n\r\n     \"All hail to the revolution.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I enter the prison doors a flaming revolutionist, my head erect,\r\n     my spirit untamed, and my soul unconquered.\"\r\n\r\n     \"In Russia and Germany our valiant comrades are leading the\r\n     proletarian revolution.... They are setting the heroic example for\r\n     world-wide emulation. Let us, like them, scorn and repudiate the\r\n     cowardly compromisers within our ranks, challenge and defy the\r\n     robber-class power, and fight it out on that line to victory or\r\n     death.\"\r\n\r\nThis favorite leader of the radicals of America was convicted by jury of\r\nviolation of the Espionage Law on September 12, 1918, and two days later\r\nsentenced to serve ten years in the penitentiary. The case was appealed\r\non the ground that the Espionage Act was an unconstitutional abridgment\r\nof the right of free speech. The decision of the United States Supreme\r\nCourt was handed down on March 10, 1919. In the words of a Socialist\r\nwork, Trachtenberg's Labor Year Book, 1919-1920, page 102, \"The Court\r\nheld that the law was not contrary to the Constitution and affirmed the\r\nsentence imposed upon Debs by the lower court. The decision was\r\nunanimous that the nature and intended effect of his speech was to\r\nobstruct recruiting and enlistment in the army.\"\r\n\r\nYet this same Year Book, in its account of \"The Emergency Convention of\r\nthe Socialist Party\" at Chicago in August-September, 1919, says, page\r\n409: \"The Convention went on record offering the presidential nomination\r\nof the party to Eugene V. Debs, the nomination to be ratified at the\r\n1920 Convention.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 5, 1920, at Albany, in the final argument for the five\r\nsuspended Socialist Assemblymen, according to the \"New York Times\" of\r\nMarch 6, 1920, Seymour Stedman said of Debs: \"He represents in a sense\r\nthe Socialist movement. Perhaps he represents it more completely than\r\nany other man in this country.\"\r\n\r\nIn order that the reader may understand the extreme way in which\r\nlawbreakers like Debs and Victor L. Berger were justified by those\r\ndefending the five suspended Socialists at Albany, we give an extract\r\nfrom the testimony of Morris Hillquit on February 19, 1920, as reported\r\nin the \"New York Times\" of the next day:\r\n\r\n     \"The testimony leading up to Mr. Hillquit's admissions was given\r\n     after Martin Conboy of counsel for the Judiciary Committee had read\r\n     into the record a speech and a signed article by Victor L. Berger.\r\n     In the speech, delivered at the Socialist National Convention in\r\n     1908, Mr. Berger said:\r\n\r\n     \"'I have no doubt that in the last analysis we must shoot, and when\r\n     it comes to shooting, Wisconsin will be there.'\r\n\r\n     \"In the signed article which appeared in a Socialist newspaper\r\n     published in Milwaukee the following year, he wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"'Socialists and workingmen should ... have rifles and the\r\n     necessary rounds of ammunition ... and be prepared to back up their\r\n     ballots with their bullets.'\"\r\n\r\nIn reply, according to the \"New York Times\" of February 20, 1920,\r\nputting his own far-fetched construction on Victor L. Berger's words,\r\nMorris Hillquit himself advanced the doctrine of \"a little shooting\" in\r\nthe following statement:\r\n\r\n     \"'History ... has shown that when the privileged minority is about\r\n     to lose its privileges ... it tries to destroy reform or lawful\r\n     revolutionary movements by force, ... and in a case of this kind it\r\n     may come to shooting.\r\n\r\n     \"'It is not at all impossible that, even in this country, when the\r\n     majority of the people will be ready to introduce substantial\r\n     reform and take away the privileges of the profiteering class by\r\n     constitutional, legal methods, these self-same profiteering\r\n     interests will take offense and try to play some trick upon the\r\n     people, and in that case it is possible--as a matter of prophecy,\r\n     not as a matter of program, so far as we are concerned--that the\r\n     people of this country will be compelled to supplement their\r\n     political action by a little shooting.'\"\r\n\r\nTestifying the same day, Hillquit endorsed Debs as follows, according to\r\nthe \"New York Times\" of February 20, 1920:\r\n\r\n     \"When asked if Debs is a candidate of the Socialist Party for\r\n     President, Mr. Hillquit replied:\r\n\r\n     \"'If any voice or influence of mine could accomplish anything, he\r\n     certainly will be nominated at the next convention.'\r\n\r\n     \"'The Supreme Court has passed upon the conviction of Debs and\r\n     affirmed it,' said ex-Judge Sutherland, of counsel.\r\n     'Notwithstanding this judgment, you still declare that Mr. Debs\r\n     represents and personifies the attitude of the Socialist Party on\r\n     the subject of loyalty to the United States Government?'\r\n\r\n     \"'I do not say that he represents the attitude of the Socialist\r\n     Party. I think I said that he represents the highest and noblest\r\n     sentiments of United States citizenship and American loyalty....\r\n     Debs was convicted only for saying things, not for doing things. I\r\n     do not for a moment doubt he said the things he is charged with\r\n     having said.' ...\r\n\r\n     \"'Do you uphold and approve of, as a leader of the Socialist Party,\r\n     the words that Mr. Debs pronounced, and for which he was\r\n     convicted?'\r\n\r\n     \"'I haven't got his complete speech before me. I do not want to\r\n     commit the Party in this general way to every statement. I will\r\n     say, as a whole, I read his speech at the time and my impression\r\n     was that it was a perfectly innocent, honest expression of\r\n     opposition to war for very good and patriotic motives.' ...\r\n\r\n     \"'Have you any respect at all for the decision of the tribunal to\r\n     the contrary?'\r\n\r\n     \"'I have respect to this effect: that I know that it is final and\r\n     binding and in practice will go. I do not have respect in the sense\r\n     of believing that it is just, impartial, and well-reasoned out.'\r\n     ...\r\n\r\n     \"'Mr. Hillquit, do you wish to be understood as saying that you\r\n     approve of the words spoken by Mr. Debs for which he was\r\n     convicted?'\r\n\r\n     \"'Are you trying to get me a little conviction, also, Judge?' asked\r\n     the witness.\r\n\r\n     \"'I am not in a position to indorse every word and every phrase\r\n     because I have not the speech before me,' he continued. 'As a rule,\r\n     I fully indorsed his statements on the subject of the war,\r\n     expressed, I suppose, in that speech and in other speeches.... I\r\n     share with all my comrades the greatest respect for Debs, and\r\n     cannot think any compliment too high for him.'\r\n\r\n     \"'And you think it was that largeness of view, do you, that led Mr.\r\n     Debs to say the things which brought him into conflict with the law\r\n     of the United States?'\r\n\r\n     \"'Absolutely, just in the same way as it once happened to one Jesus\r\n     of Nazareth.'\"\r\n\r\n     \"'And you say that notwithstanding the highest judicial authority\r\n     known under the Constitution has declared him guilty of doing\r\n     that, and in contempt of that authority, notwithstanding that\r\n     authority, you say that he is the man that should be placed in the\r\n     President's chair by the votes of the Socialist Party?'\r\n\r\n     \"'I do.'\r\n\r\n     \"'If Mr. Debs were elected in 1920, how would you proceed to\r\n     inaugurate[12] him, as he is serving a twenty-year sentence?' asked\r\n     Assemblyman Jenks.\r\n\r\n     \"'The chances are that prior to the time he would be called upon to\r\n     occupy the chair the powers that be would sober up enough to know\r\n     that the present conviction is an improper and inhuman act and\r\n     liberate him.'\"\r\n\r\nOn several occasions at the trial, in spite of Hillquit's studied effort\r\nto cast an air of innocency over his party, menacing words escaped from\r\nthis crafty leader. He could not restrain them even at the end, on March\r\n3, 1920, when summing up the case for the Socialist defendants at\r\nAlbany, according to the following account in the \"Sun and New York\r\nHerald\" of March 4, 1920:\r\n\r\n     \"Justifying the general strike as an emergency weapon, Mr. Hillquit\r\n     made this startling statement interpreted in some quarters as an\r\n     open threat:\r\n\r\n     \"'The workers of this country have the right \"to call a general\r\n     strike\" and it is well that they should at least hold it in\r\n     abeyance as a possible instrument in some cases, in very\r\n     exceptional emergencies. I will say that the general strike has\r\n     been used abroad for the purpose of enforcing political action.'\r\n\r\n     \"'A labor party is being formed,' Mr. Hillquit said, 'in some parts\r\n     of the country. Suppose it should elect representatives to the\r\n     Legislature and a capitalist in that Legislature should get up and\r\n     say \"I don't approve of your programme; get out of my Legislature.\"\r\n\r\n     \"'I say this would be eminently a case where the workers would be\r\n     justified in declaring a general strike until such time as their\r\n     constitutional rights are actually accorded to them.'\"\r\n\r\nTo this \"veiled threat\" Martin Conboy, counsel for the Judiciary\r\nCommittee, replied the next day in summing up for the prosecution. We\r\nquote his words from the \"Sun and New York Herald\" of March 5, 1920:\r\n\r\n     \"'Under the veil of a simile a threat was employed that if you\r\n     gentlemen concluded that these five Socialist Assemblymen should\r\n     not sit in this chamber as members of this Assembly a general\r\n     strike might be called. In the whole history devoted to the\r\n     development of this idea there has been no more frank exposition of\r\n     the doctrine than that. It is proof, sufficient and satisfactory to\r\n     the point of a demonstration of the charge that has been made in\r\n     this case.\r\n\r\n     \"'The threat carries itself further. You must not only admit them,\r\n     but you must take their legislative programme and exact it into\r\n     law; otherwise the general strike will again be employed.\r\n\r\n     \"'No opportunity is lost by the leaders of the Socialist Party to\r\n     impress upon the rank and file that it is impossible to achieve\r\n     ultimate triumph by political action. For this reason the American\r\n     Federation of Labor is subjected to continuous attacks and\r\n     misrepresentation. For this reason Debs, originally an ardent trade\r\n     unionist, abandoned and repudiated his former associates after\r\n     joining the Socialist Party.'\"\r\n\r\nThe hypocritical defense made by the Socialists at Albany, through which\r\nthe unchanged character of the unrepentant plotters has constantly\r\nrevealed itself, should put us on our guard. Brought into the light by\r\nwholesale arrests and deportations, all branches of radicalism, in this\r\ncountry and at Moscow, have adopted new tactics of deception. They\r\nprofess peace and a return to peaceful methods, claim the liberties\r\nwhich belong only to the law-abiding, and hide behind the sympathies of\r\nthose who are easily taken in. Yet they justify all their misdeeds, and\r\nwithdraw none of their evil principles, but rather reaffirm them, with\r\nsubtlety. What does this mean? It means that the old conspirators, whose\r\novert acts have lately crowded our law-courts, hope to fool the American\r\npeople into letting them continue their propaganda unto lawlessness\r\nunder a thin mask of conformity to the very laws they seek to destroy.\r\n\r\nAlthough the \"Red\" conspiracy, as a result of government prosecution,\r\nhas taken on disguises and gone under ground, it is not, thus, less\r\nvirulent and dangerous, but more so. Evidence of deceit appeared in the\r\n\"One Big Union Monthly\" for February, 1920, to which lack of space\r\nprevents more than a mere allusion. That issue contained articles\r\nshowing even the I. W. W. preparing an alibi and a disguise. They argued\r\nthat their organization was not \"illegal,\" and that its famous Preamble\r\nmeant \"evolution\" and not \"revolution.\" Another article urged the I. W.\r\nW. to give up its name and amalgamate with other industrial unions in a\r\nnew organization to be known as The One Big Union.\r\n\r\nStill more significant, the same magazine for February, 1920, published\r\na new incitement to revolution by Leon Trotzky, together with a \"Call\r\nfor Proletarian International\" signed by \"The Bureau of the Central\r\nAll-Russian Council of Industrial Unions\" and an \"Appeal of the Russian\r\nIndustrial Unions to the Workers of the Allied Countries\" signed by \"The\r\nBureau of the All-Russian Council of Industrial Union.\" The \"call\"\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n     \"The Central All-Russian Council of Industrial Unions invites all\r\n     economic organizations based on the real and revolutionary class\r\n     struggle for the liberation of labor through the proletarian\r\n     dictatorship to solidify anew their ranks against the international\r\n     league of brigands, to break with the international of\r\n     conciliators, and to proceed in unison with the Central All-Russian\r\n     Council of Industrial Unions toward the organization of a truly\r\n     international conference of all Socialistic labor unions and\r\n     veritable revolutionary workers' syndicates.\r\n\r\n     \"We beg all economic labor organizations that accept the program of\r\n     the revolutionary class struggle to respond to our call and enter\r\n     in a direct touch with us.\"\r\n\r\nThe accompanying I. W. W. comment was, \"We are sure that our\r\norganization will be there.\" Thus, if it be under ground, the mole still\r\nworks. Moscow still inflames, unifies and directs the great\r\nworld-conspiracy against the \"Entente Powers\" and all the nations that\r\nhave been looking toward peace. The \"Appeal,\" accompanying the \"call,\"\r\nsays in part:\r\n\r\n     \"Can it be true, that you, the workers of England, France, Italy\r\n     and the United States, will much longer support your governments\r\n     and permit your blood to quench the spreading conflagration of the\r\n     social revolution? Can it be that the international bandits of the\r\n     League of Nations and the thrice-branded Versailles shall be\r\n     allowed unhampered to weave their nets for the strangling of the\r\n     world proletarian revolution?...\r\n\r\n     \"Down with the bandits of imperialism!\r\n\r\n     \"Long live the World Proletarian Revolution!\r\n\r\n     \"Long live the International Soviet Republic!\"\r\n\r\nNear the end of his article Trotzky says, according to \"The One Big\r\nUnion Monthly,\" for February, 1920, page 21, \"By thrusting the\r\nbourgeoisie away from the helm of state, by taking power into its own\r\nhands, the working class is preparing for the creation of Federation of\r\nSoviet Republics of Europe and the whole world.... War was and will\r\nremain a form of armed exploitation or armed struggle against\r\nexploitation.\"\r\n\r\nAn editorial note on the same page, immediately below the article of\r\nTrotzky, says: \"The above article and the APPEAL OF THE RUSSIAN\r\nINDUSTRIAL UNIONS TO THE WORKERS OF THE ALLIED COUNTRIES are taken from\r\ndocuments on Russia of the working class, written by members of the\r\nSoviet Government.... These materials were sent to Fellow Worker Wm. D.\r\nHaywood by Comrade Leon Trotzky, the valiant Commissary for War of the\r\nvictorious Workers' Commonwealth. We are happy to announce that the I.\r\nW. W. will be the first to publish these latest documents on peasant and\r\nindustrial life in Bolshevikland.\"\r\n\r\nDid Martens and Hillquit advise Lenine and Trotzky to disguise their\r\nAmerican propaganda by using the Industrial Unions of Russia as their\r\ncat's-paw? We ask this because Hillquit has long been \"Councillor\" in\r\nAmerica to the Russian Soviet Republic,[L] while the above method of\r\ninflaming American labor unions has been the secret method of the\r\nSocialist Party's Rand School of Science for some years--since 1916, at\r\nleast. These are facts established by documents obtained in the summer\r\nof 1919 by raids of the Rand School, put in evidence before the New York\r\nState Legislative Committee, Senator Clayton R. Lusk, Chairman, and\r\nreferred to in the July 30, 1919, issue of \"The National Civic\r\nFederation Review,\" from which we quote the following:\r\n\r\n     \"One David P. Berenberg is director of the correspondence\r\n     department of the Rand School. From the letter-files seized there,\r\n     evidence was produced showing the kind of propaganda conducted\r\n     through Berenberg's department. In a carbon copy of a letter to\r\n     Harry L. Perkins, of San Diego, Cal., dated June 7, 1916, the\r\n     statement was made:\r\n\r\n     \"'When we read of 'preparedness' that is in full force in the camps\r\n     of the capitalists, we realize that unless we organize and fit\r\n     ourselves to resist, and to take over the government, we will one\r\n     day find ourselves where our French and German brothers are today,\r\n     dead or maimed in the fray.'\r\n\r\n     \"'In other words,' commented Chairman Lusk, 'for over two years\r\n     this Rand School has been advocating armed preparedness to take\r\n     over the government.'\r\n\r\n     \"A letter--obviously after a form letter sent to correspondents\r\n     generally--dated October 3, 1916, addressed to M. E. Rabb, Xenia,\r\n     Ohio, offered as evidence, contained the following:\r\n\r\n     \"'What are you doing when the State robs you and your union and so\r\n     makes you helpless to strike? There is only one thing to do: take\r\n     over the State.\r\n\r\n     \"'Are the members of your local prepared to take over and conduct\r\n     wisely and well the affairs of your town and county? Are you\r\n     prepared to meet the militia when the powers of the State and\r\n     courts are against you? Are you arming yourself with the knowledge\r\n     of the foundations of our society so that when these crises come to\r\n     you, you will have an organization strong enough to have foreseen\r\n     and forestalled them? Are you training your members in scientific\r\n     Socialism?'\r\n\r\n     \"This same adroitly phrased incitement was found in other\r\n     correspondence.\"\r\n\r\nThis pest-house of treason and lawlessness, the Rand School, Hillquit's\r\npet university of Socialism, ought to be dug up by the roots. And what\r\nshall we say of such evidence? Why should the Socialist Party of America\r\nhesitate to affiliate with the Third (Moscow) International and approve\r\nits \"programs and methods\" when Hillquit's illegitimate offspring, the\r\nRand School, was teaching such \"methods\" a year before the Bolsheviki\r\nseized Petrograd and the dictatorship? Is Hillquit Lenine's pupil or\r\nLenine's teacher? Is Hillquit, backer of the Rand School propaganda, the\r\nsame gentle Morris Hillquit who as an \"expert on Socialism\" testified\r\nbefore the Assembly Judiciary Committee on February 17, 1920:\r\n\r\n     \"The word 'revolution' does not have for us the romantic\r\n     significance of barricade fights or other acts of violence that it\r\n     has for most of our newspaper writers and school boys.\" (\"Sun and\r\n     New York Herald,\" February 18, 1920.)\r\n\r\nCan this be the same Hillquit who earlier in the trial broke out in the\r\nangry threat: \"What we say to you, gentlemen: the contemplated act of\r\nthis Assembly, if consummated, _will ... loosen the violent\r\nrevolution_.\" (\"New York Evening Sun,\" January 21, 1920.) Did he allude\r\nto some pink tea party?\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps the \"school boys\" Hillquit referred to are those by his pet\r\ninstitution poisoned and turned into degenerates in the bud of manhood,\r\nlike poor Oscar Edelman, whose valedictory speech on graduating from a\r\ncourse in the Rand School of Social Science ran thus:\r\n\r\n     \"For us as students, Socialists and Labor Unionists, our work is\r\n     laid out. We must help educate the workers of America so that their\r\n     slogan, 'a fair day's wage for a fair day's work' be replaced by\r\n     the revolutionary slogan, 'abolition of the wage system.' ... In\r\n     the great world-struggle which is taking place today, we must take\r\n     active part.... The ideals which today inspire Debs and Lenine are\r\n     the ideals which inspire us.\" (Lusk Committee evidence, quoted from\r\n     \"The National Civic Federation Review,\" July 30, 1919.)\r\n\r\nBut of all the sublime performances of Hillquit, that which lays the\r\nbrightest crown on his veracity was the answer he gave at Albany on\r\nFebruary 17, 1920, to the long hypothetical question concerning the\r\nattitude of the Socialists should their friends of the Third\r\nInternational, the Bolsheviki, invade the United States.\r\n\r\nAt this question the redoubtable Mr. Hillquit, according to the \"New\r\nYork Times\" of February 18, 1920, \"settled back in his chair and smiled\"\r\nand said: \"I should say that the Socialists of the United States would\r\nhave no hesitancy whatsoever in joining forces with the rest of their\r\ncountrymen to repel the Bolsheviki who would try to invade our country\r\n_and force a form of government upon our people which our people were\r\nnot ready for and did not desire_.\" (Italics mine.)\r\n\r\nHad Hillquit stopped where the italics began he would have stretched our\r\ncredulity to the utmost. But if \"our people\" meant to him American\r\nSocialists, we readily believe that invading Bolsheviki, coming to wrest\r\nthe American dictatorship from our native talent, would find themselves\r\nand their undesirable \"form of government\" pitched into the sea by\r\nHillquit and his crowd. Majority Socialist against Spartacide and\r\nBolshevik against Menshivik--we have seen how one Socialist group repels\r\nthe \"form of government\" forced by another.\r\n\r\nWhen we think of the heroic exploits of Hillquit in repelling foreign\r\ninvaders from America about 1917-18, can we not imagine him hurling one\r\nof his deadly manifestoes at his Bolsheviki friends? No doubt when\r\nComrade Martens, the vanguard of the invading Bolsheviki, stormed\r\nHillquit's castle on Riverside Drive with a fee and a commission as\r\n\"Councillor,\" the outraged patriot crashed a receipt in full against the\r\ninvader's outstretched paw.\r\n\r\nAs we think of Hillquit's love for peaceful \"political action\"--on the\r\nwitness stand--those words from his foundling, the \"New York Call\" of\r\nMay 1, 1919, return to our minds:\r\n\r\n     \"The world revolution, dreamed of as a thing of the distant future,\r\n     has become a live reality, rising from the graves of the murdered\r\n     millions and the misery and suffering of the surviving millions. It\r\n     has taken form, it strikes forward, borne on by the despair of the\r\n     masses and the shining example of the martyrs: its spread is\r\n     irrepressible....\r\n\r\n     \"The war of the nations has been followed by the war of the\r\n     classes. The class struggle is no longer fought by resolutions and\r\n     demonstrations. Threateningly it marches through the streets of the\r\n     great cities for life or death.\"\r\n\r\nMr. William English Walling, in an article published in the \"New York\r\nTimes,\" January 20, 1920, asks a pertinent question about the\r\nrevolutionary activities of the American Socialist Party:\r\n\r\n     \"The 'American Socialist Party,' finds itself compelled, precisely\r\n     like Lenine, to pretend to be a peace-loving organization, loyally\r\n     accepting constitutional democracy and opposed to violence. Are we\r\n     to take it at its own word? Is it possible that a few pious phrases\r\n     offered on occasion can deceive the American people as to the\r\n     nature of a propaganda organization that is shouting from the\r\n     housetops in every corner of the country and every day of the year?\r\n\r\n     \"The only imaginable reason why the public has paid any attention\r\n     is that there are two or three organizations more wholly given over\r\n     to violence, whereas the Socialist organization gives a share of\r\n     its attention to party politics. It was said until recently, 'Oh,\r\n     the anarchists are for violence, but the Socialists are for law and\r\n     order.' Last August it was found that a large part of the\r\n     Socialists were for immediate revolution. Then it was said that the\r\n     Communists are revolutionary, but the Socialists are for law and\r\n     order. The reasoning was that if the Left Wing was for immediate\r\n     revolution, then the Right Wing must be for law and order!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Walling expresses an expert opinion, having been a prominent member\r\nof Hillquit's party until this organization, at St. Louis in 1917,\r\nbegan the openly lawless course which led to the conviction of a large\r\nnumber of its leaders under the Espionage Law. Moreover, since January,\r\n1920, when Mr. Walling recorded the above opinion, evidence has come to\r\nlight which shows he was exactly right in saying that the American\r\nSocialist Party acted \"precisely like Lenine\" in pretending \"to be a\r\npeace-loving organization\" because it found \"itself compelled\" to do so.\r\n\r\nThe tactics of Lenine, Trotzky and Zinovieff, the Bolshevist\r\n\"triumvirate\" of Russia, and of Ludwig C. A. K. Martens and Morris\r\nHillquit in America, are so similar that the evidence brought by Lincoln\r\nEyre out of Russia perfectly interprets the \"weasel words\" of Martens\r\nand Hillquit on the witness stand at Washington and Albany,\r\nrespectively. Hillquit, the connecting link, according to his testimony\r\nat Albany, February 19, 1920, was born at Riga, Russia; came to America\r\na boy, like so many Russian immigrants; attended New York's public\r\nschools; and under the protection of the Stars and Stripes, which he\r\nwould drag down, has made himself so emphatically one of the\r\n\"capitalists,\" whom he hates, that he resides on New York's famous\r\n\"Riverside Drive,\" and was able to testify with a smirk, \"I flatter\r\nmyself that I am not a failure.\" (See printed \"Testimony\" of the trial\r\nof the five Assemblymen for the details.)\r\n\r\nA moral failure, without extenuation, most Americans will regard Morris\r\nHillquit. For out of thirty-five years, spent by him on our hospitable\r\nshores in getting rich under the protection of our Government,\r\ninstitutions and people, he has used at least twenty in trying to\r\ndestroy the benefactor that nursed him. See the \"New York Evening\r\nTelegram\" of February 17, 1920, as follows: \"Mr. Hillquit was called to\r\nthe stand as the first witness for the five Assemblymen. He gave his\r\nresidence as No. 214 Riverside Drive, New York City. Mr. Hillquit said\r\nhe had lived in this country thirty-five years, and had been a Socialist\r\nsince the party was organized, in 1900.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the man who in 1917 and 1918 backed his organization, so far as\r\nhe dared, to cripple the people of the United States while they were\r\nengaged in a desperate war; and who since has been Lenine's brain in\r\nAmerica in trying to set fire to the house of government in which the\r\nAmerican people live. Notice his intelligence in the hypocritical\r\nBolshevist refinement of separating the Moscow Soviet Government from\r\nthe Moscow International, so that one of these may offer our people\r\npeace while the other continues to plot our destruction. This\r\ndistinction was made, with its significance concealed, in Hillquit's\r\ntestimony at Albany on February 18, 1920, which the Albany\r\n\"Knickerbocker Press\" of the next day, February 19, thus summarized:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Hillquit testified at length concerning Soviet Russia.... Mr.\r\n     Hillquit also testified that there were differences between Soviet\r\n     Government, Bolshevists and the Moscow International. _The latter_,\r\n     he said, _did not represent Soviet Russia_, and the Bolshevists, he\r\n     said, were merely a national party of Russia.\" (Italics mine.)\r\n\r\nIn a cabled account of an interview with Zinovieff, sent by Lincoln Eyre\r\nfrom Russia to the \"World,\" headed, \"Riga (by courier via Berlin), Feb.\r\n24,\" and printed in the \"New York World\" of February 26, 1920, we have a\r\nflood of light showing that the central plot of the Socialist\r\ninternational conspiracy hinges precisely on the distinction which\r\nHillquit had made at Albany a few days before, namely, that the Moscow\r\nInternational does \"not represent Soviet Russia.\" Through the courtesy\r\nof the \"New York World\" we quote from its issue of February 26, 1920,\r\nthe essential parts of Eyre's statement as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Bolshevik propaganda abroad, though still as active and insidious\r\n     as it has ever been has undergone a radical change of late. That\r\n     conclusion was arrived at by a close study of the subject, which I\r\n     pursued in Moscow and Petrograd, reinforced by an interview with C.\r\n     S. Zinovieff, ruler of the latter city, also President of the\r\n     Executive Committee of the Third Internationale and firebrand of\r\n     the revolution.\r\n\r\n     \"The Russian Communist Party, which is the Bolsheviki's official\r\n     political title, no longer exports agitators chosen from among\r\n     members to kindle the flames of revolt in foreign lands. They are\r\n     too wise for that antiquated process nowadays. What they do in\r\n     these scientific times is to import from the country of his birth\r\n     the crudely fashioned product of his own domestic Bolshevism,\r\n     subject him to certain finishing processes (including perhaps a\r\n     gold lining) and ship him back home again complete in every detail,\r\n     smooth running and highly inflammable. That is one of the reasons\r\n     why the Soviet Government is prepared to promise and to keep its\r\n     promise to refrain from sending forth agents charged with spreading\r\n     the gospel of capitalistic annihilation....\r\n\r\n     \"Another reason for the Soviet's willingness to quit propagandizing\r\n     abroad is that it has already turned over to the Third\r\n     Internationale all business of that kind.... Now, the Third\r\n     Internationale has no official connection with the Soviet\r\n     Government. It is supposed to be a separate institution. Yet all\r\n     its leaders hold office under the Soviets and its funds, which are\r\n     considerable, must be derived from Soviet sources. Nevertheless it\r\n     is technically, indeed legally, non-governmental, wherefore the\r\n     Moscow Cabinet is justified in pledging itself to leave propaganda\r\n     to 'friendly' foreign states alone.\r\n\r\n     \"The moving spirit of the Third Internationale is Zinovieff, who,\r\n     with Lenine and Trotzky, forms the triumvirate on which Bolshevism\r\n     today rests, although he is by no means as big a man as the other\r\n     two. Zinovieff is not a member of the Council of Peoples'\r\n     Commissaries (the Cabinet), but merely of the All-Russian Central\r\n     Executive Committee, from which the former body derives its powers,\r\n     and which itself is subordinate to the supreme executive\r\n     legislative judicial organ, the All-Russian Convention of Soviets.\r\n     Thus, while the role allotted to him on the administrative stage is\r\n     really as prominent as that of any of his fellows, short of Lenine\r\n     and Trotzky, Zinovieff can legitimately claim to be without voice\r\n     in the actual administration of the Soviet Republic....\r\n\r\n     \"The first point that Zinovieff made clear to me in our talk was\r\n     that the Third Internationale is not comparable to the League of\r\n     Nations.... The Overlord of Petrograd affirmed, ... 'The Third\r\n     Internationale ... is a purely political group. It is a\r\n     confederation of the world's Communists, an international coalition\r\n     of the Communist Parties already existing in their respective\r\n     countries.... The Third Internationale is a going concern, with\r\n     some 8,000,000 members.' ...\r\n\r\n     \"'But,' I asked, 'how is your aim of a European world republic of\r\n     Soviets to be realized unless there is some international\r\n     governmental machine?'\r\n\r\n     \"'There will be some such machine,' Zinovieff replied, 'but\r\n     probably it will take the form of a new organization along Soviet\r\n     lines. In my view, the revolution will follow the same general\r\n     channels it has taken in Russia, with alterations of detail, of\r\n     course. Should France overthrow capitalism, for instance, she will\r\n     at first establish Sovietism, and subsequently combine with us. To\r\n     foresee the mechanical angles of such combination, however, is too\r\n     early.'\r\n\r\n     \"'And your propaganda programme,' I ventured, 'is as strong and\r\n     far-reaching as ever?'\r\n\r\n     \"The prompt reply was: 'The Third Internationale is primarily an\r\n     instrument of revolution. It reunites at Moscow the intelligence\r\n     and energy of all the Communist groups the world over. Delegates\r\n     from the various national organizations come to us and give and\r\n     take knowledge about the cause and return to their respective home\r\n     countries refreshed and invigorated. This work will be continued,\r\n     no matter what happens, legally or illegally. The Soviet Government\r\n     may pledge itself to refrain from propaganda abroad, but the Third\r\n     Internationale--never!'\"\r\n\r\nLet us ponder this description of the Third International by its manager\r\nand greatest living expert: its scope, a confederation of the world's\r\nCommunists, a coalition of the Communist parties of all countries; its\r\nsize, 8,000,000 members, perhaps greatly exaggerated; its nature, \"an\r\ninstrument of revolution;\" and its determination, to carry on\r\npropaganda, for the violent seizure of every land by a dictatorship, \"no\r\nmatter what happens, legally or illegally.\" Let us reflect that it is\r\nwith this Third International, and not the Russian Soviet Government,\r\nthat Hillquit's Party in America is affiliated, according to the\r\ntestimony of the Socialists themselves at Albany. Finally, with these\r\nfacts for a plummet, let us try to find the bottom of Hillquit's\r\nhypocrisy in pretending at Albany that he and his disciples do not\r\nbelieve in \"revolution\" but only in \"evolution.\"\r\n\r\nBefore passing from Lincoln Eyre's testimony, we further quote from his\r\ncable in the \"World\" of February 26, 1920, what we may call his\r\ndescription of \"the Third International at work,\" as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Zinovieff ... is that combination of idealistic Hotspur and\r\n     practical executive which is characteristic of many Bolshevist\r\n     leaders. Despite his long years in exile with Lenine, to whose\r\n     Doctor Johnson he played Boswell ably and loyally, this\r\n     shock-haired enthusiastic young Jew--he is to-day scarcely\r\n     forty--was able to run Petrograd.... Petrograd is still underfed,\r\n     underheated, dirty and desolate, but it continues to live.... For\r\n     this Zinovieff, as all-mighty controller of the city's destinies,\r\n     ... deserves credit....\r\n\r\n     \"Besides having a hand in everything that concerns local\r\n     administration, and most things which have to do with national\r\n     government, he personally edits and writes many pages of the Third\r\n     Internationale's organ, 'The Internationale Communist,' a monthly\r\n     magazine of some 250 pages printed simultaneously in Russian,\r\n     English, French and German. Moreover, he passes upon all important\r\n     printed matter emanating from the Internationale's press. Every\r\n     foreign Communist coming to Moscow or Petrograd sees Zinovieff and\r\n     gets pointers from him how to propagate Bolshevism.\r\n\r\n     \"In the seven weeks I spent in Moscow, three delegates arrived from\r\n     the United States and literally scores from Germany, Hungary,\r\n     Austria, Switzerland, Scandinavia, Roumania, Bulgaria, Italy,\r\n     China, Japan, Corea, India, Afghanistan and Asia Minor countries.\r\n     The only important states from which few Communistic envoys come\r\n     are Britain and France. Practically all these missionaries are\r\n     obliged to travel illegally, that is, with false passports or\r\n     without any. They slip across the fighting fronts that encircle the\r\n     Soviet Republic in astonishing ways, risking death and all forms of\r\n     hardship to reach Moscow. The one-time seat of Moscow's Emperors\r\n     has become to Communists the world over what Mecca is to the\r\n     Mohammedan pilgrims.\r\n\r\n     \"A youthful emissary of the I. W. W. said to me: 'We come here to\r\n     drink of the fountain of revolutionary youth.' I asked him what he\r\n     thought would happen when Russia's frontiers were opened. 'We shall\r\n     come as we come now, but in greater numbers and with greater ease,'\r\n     he replied.\r\n\r\n     \"'But won't the Third Internationale send its Russian agitators\r\n     abroad then, thus making it unnecessary for you to come here?'\r\n     'What for?' he retorted. 'There is no use sending Russians to talk\r\n     to American workmen. Americans will close their ears to a foreigner\r\n     where they will open them wide to one of their own countrymen. The\r\n     Third Internationale is a realistic organization. It has learned\r\n     long ago that racial and national prejudices, however misguided\r\n     they may be, are deep seated and cannot be overcome in a day. It\r\n     aims to get results, and so it lets Americans talk to Americans.'\r\n     ...\r\n\r\n     \"The Bolsheviki are as eager to precipitate a world revolution as\r\n     ever. But at the moment they are even more eager to establish\r\n     relations with the markets of the world, so that Russia may be\r\n     saved from economic catastrophe.... The Kremlin realizes full well\r\n     that it cannot hope to spread Bolshevism by means of its own\r\n     people. And with the Third Internationale headed by Zinovieff,\r\n     operating in close contact with the National Communist groups, it\r\n     knows it does not have to.\"\r\n\r\nThus the overtures of peace and promises of good behavior made by the\r\nRussian Soviet Government to the other Powers are pure humbug; and\r\nequally false are the professions of peace in America which Hillquit's\r\nbranch of the Third International has made to lull the fears of the\r\nAmerican people. To get the full force of this parallelism we have only\r\nto place the law-breaking Socialist Party of America since 1917 in juxta\r\nposition with the hypocritical Socialist professions and principles\r\nbrought out in 1920 during the trial of the Assemblymen at Albany.\r\n\r\nAs the long record of jury convictions of officials and members of the\r\nSocialist Party of America is the real foundation of the case against\r\nthe five New York Assemblymen, exposing the character of the\r\norganization they serve, we quote for the reader's information a press\r\nsummary of the facts, submitted by a citizens' \"Committee on Publicity,\"\r\nMarch 2, 1920, \"for the approval of the People of the State of New\r\nYork.\" According to the Albany \"Knickerbocker[13] Press\" of March 3,\r\n1920, this Committee's statement, after referring to \"the procedure of\r\nthe New York Assembly in January, 1920,\" in \"temporarily suspending the\r\nfive Socialist Assemblymen while instituting a judicial inquiry into\r\ntheir qualifications to serve as law-makers,\" continues as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"We believe the Assembly was misjudged in the minds of many who\r\n     reasoned: 'Socialists elected to previous Assemblies were seated\r\n     without objection, why then suspend the five Socialist Assemblymen\r\n     this year and investigate them?'\r\n\r\n     \"We offer what we believe to be a complete answer to the question.\r\n     We believe the Assembly had a compelling warrant for its procedure\r\n     in serious facts and charges not known to previous Legislatures.\r\n     These include:\r\n\r\n     \"First--Court records showing that most of the principal leaders of\r\n     the Socialist 'Party' were convicted lawbreakers.\r\n\r\n     \"Second--the revelations of the Lusk Committee.\r\n\r\n     \"Under the first head may be mentioned the conviction and\r\n     twenty-year sentence, on January 8, 1919, of Victor L. Berger,\r\n     National Executive Committeeman of the so-called Socialist Party;\r\n     the conviction of Eugene V. Debs, four times Presidential candidate\r\n     of the party, whose ten-year sentence was affirmed by the United\r\n     States Supreme Court March 10, 1919; and other convictions in 1919,\r\n     including, Adolph Germer, National Executive Secretary; J. Louis\r\n     Engdahl, editor of the Socialist Party's official publications;\r\n     Irwin St. John Tucker, head of its literature department, and\r\n     William F. Kruse, Secretary of the Young People's Socialist\r\n     organization. In addition, twenty of the Socialist Party's lesser\r\n     leaders and scores of its rank and file had been convicted of\r\n     disloyal acts and utterances, while nineteen of the chief Socialist\r\n     organs had their second-class mail privileges canceled for\r\n     disloyalty.\r\n\r\n     \"Under the second head may be mentioned the fact that the\r\n     investigations of the Lusk Committee showed that the Socialist\r\n     incitement to lawlessness prevalent throughout the country was\r\n     largely due to the propaganda of the Rand School of Socialism, a\r\n     New York Corporation of which two of the Socialist Assemblymen were\r\n     members. Furthermore, the American Socialist Society, the\r\n     corporation that owns and conducts the Rand School, had been\r\n     convicted under the Espionage Act before the United States District\r\n     Court and heavily fined by Judge Julius M. Mayer.\r\n\r\n     \"These were some of the facts and charges which were matters of\r\n     public record and public knowledge when the Assembly of 1920\r\n     convened. We submit, therefore, that if the Assembly had not taken\r\n     action as it did, it would have been derelict in its duty.\r\n\r\n     \"We therefore recommend:\r\n\r\n     \"1. That all loyal organizations pass, publish and file with this\r\n     Committee resolutions in acknowledgment of the service rendered by\r\n     the New York Assembly and in encouragement of similar action by the\r\n     Legislatures of other states.\r\n\r\n     \"2. That individuals affirm this judgment in suitable ways, and\r\n     particularly by letters to the press in their localities.\r\n\r\n     \"3. That all loyal individuals and organizations co-operate to give\r\n     the whole American people the exact facts concerning the conspiracy\r\n     of radicals against our Government and institutions.\r\n\r\n     \"To this end we propose to continue the work of education by\r\n     permanent organization under the name of 'Publicity Committee\r\n     Against Socialism.'\"[M]\r\n\r\nThe above list of Socialist convictions for lawbreaking will be found\r\ncompletely confirmed, on Socialist authority, in Trachtenberg's Labor\r\nYear Book, 1919-1920, pages 92-103.\r\n\r\nWas this record questioned by the Socialist defense at Albany? In no\r\nwise; it could not be. Was the record faced, the guilt of the\r\nlawbreakers confessed, and their transgressions deplored as acts of\r\ndisloyalty which the Socialist Party now condemns and repudiates? Not at\r\nall. These acts were freshly confirmed, and taken anew upon the\r\nSocialist Party, by brazen justification of them at Albany and\r\ncondemnation of the laws, juries and courts of the American people.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how Hillquit on the witness stand justified the disloyal\r\nand violently revolutionary utterances of two of the chief offenders,\r\nDebs and Victor L. Berger, identifying himself with their sentiments and\r\nproclaiming Debs as the highest type of American citizen, the man most\r\nfit for President of the United States. We have also seen that the whole\r\nSocialist Party was in 1919 committed to the nomination of Debs as its\r\nPresidential candidate in 1920; while it is a well known fact that when\r\nCongress excluded Victor L. Berger from that body because of his\r\nconviction as a lawbreaker, the lawless Socialist Party at once\r\nre-elected him to show its contempt for law and order under our\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe testimony piled up by the prosecution at Albany showed that, instead\r\nof judging the wholesale lawbreaking by its leaders and members in 1917\r\nand 1918, the Socialist Party had in 1919 and 1920 involved itself in a\r\nstill deeper guilt, adding treason to disloyalty by affiliating itself\r\nwith the open enemies of our Government in Russia and other foreign\r\nlands. Was this denied by the Socialist defense at Albany? No, the fact\r\nof affiliation with the Third (Moscow) Internationale was admitted,\r\nreducing the defense to the false principle that the five Socialist\r\nAssemblymen should not be excluded on account of their signed pledge of\r\nobedience to a lawless organization, no matter how lawless it might be.\r\nThus in summing up for the defense, on March 3, 1920, Morris Hillquit,\r\naccording to the \"New York Times\" of March 4, 1920, made the following\r\nexcellent summary of the evidence against his party:\r\n\r\n     \"First--That the Socialist Party is a revolutionary organization.\r\n\r\n     \"Second--That it seeks to attain its ends by means of violence.\r\n\r\n     \"Third--That it does not sincerely believe in political action, and\r\n     that its politics is only a blind or camouflage.\r\n\r\n     \"Fourth--That it is unpatriotic and disloyal.\r\n\r\n     \"Fifth--That it is unduly controlled--or that it unduly controls\r\n     public officials elected on its ticket.\r\n\r\n     \"Sixth--That it owes allegiance to a foreign power known as the\r\n     Internationale.\r\n\r\n     \"Seventh--That it approves of the Soviet Government of Russia, and\r\n     seeks to introduce a similar regime in the United States; and,\r\n     finally,\r\n\r\n     \"Eighth--That the Assemblymen personally opposed prosecution of the\r\n     war and gave aid and comfort to the enemy.\r\n\r\n     \"'All of these charges,' Mr. Hillquit said, 'are distinctly charges\r\n     against the Socialist Party as such. In other words, it is the\r\n     Socialist Party of the United States that is on trial before you.'\r\n     ...\r\n\r\n     \"'I think, perhaps, the most telling point is the charge that the\r\n     Socialist Party is unpatriotic and disloyal--at least it has been\r\n     emphasized more than any other,' said the lawyer. 'We opposed the\r\n     war.... If similar conditions again arise I am sure we will take\r\n     the same position.'\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Seymour Stedman, summing up for the Socialists on March 5,\r\n1920, not being able to deny the many convictions of leaders and members\r\nof the Socialist Party under the Espionage Law, openly attacked the law\r\nitself, according to the following account in the \"New York Evening Sun\"\r\nof March 5, 1920:\r\n\r\n     \"Albany, March 5.--A bitter attack on the Espionage Act was made by\r\n     Seymour Stedman in his final summing up for the five suspended\r\n     Socialists before the Judiciary Committee of the Assembly today.\r\n\r\n     \"'Because of that act, you don't know the truth about this war; you\r\n     cannot know the truth about this war until the Espionage Act is\r\n     dead,' he asserted....\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Stedman admitted that the St. Louis war platform of the\r\n     Socialist Party was drawn 'in lurid language to meet a situation in\r\n     high flame,' but said no meeting could be called to consider\r\n     amending it because those who favored it might have been convicted\r\n     under the Espionage Act....\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Stedman contended that, of course, the Socialists took their\r\n     oath to uphold the Constitution of New York State and the United\r\n     States with the idea that they could interpret for themselves what\r\n     the Constitution means.\r\n\r\n     \"'Each public officer who takes an oath to support the Constitution\r\n     swears that he will support it as he understands it, and not as it\r\n     is understood by others.'\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the \"New York World\" of March 6, 1920, Stedman, in his\r\nspeech of the preceding day, justified Eugene V. Debs' lawbreaking with\r\nthe disgusting remark, \"He had no conception of Jesus with a dagger in\r\nhis teeth;\" and justified the lawbreaking for which Rose Pastor Stokes\r\nwas convicted with the sentence, \"She had a right to disagree with the\r\nwar aims.\" She, of course, was not convicted for \"disagreement\" but for\r\nwilfully interfering with the \"recruiting service\" of the United States\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe \"New York World\" of March 6, 1920, also gives the following specimen\r\nof Stedman's reasoning:\r\n\r\n     \"Answering the charge that Socialists generally were guilty of law\r\n     violations, he exclaimed: 'Go down to the penitentiaries and get\r\n     the histories of the birds there and you won't find any Socialists.\r\n\r\n     \"'We are quite willing to say that if 2,000 Socialists had been\r\n     arrested during the war, we are guilty.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to follow this logic. After telling us that we wouldn't\r\n\"find any Socialists\" in the penitentiaries, did Stedman suddenly\r\nbethink himself of the scores convicted, and then, on the spur of the\r\nmoment, fix 2,000 as the number of \"arrests\" necessary to wring from\r\nSocialists the confession, \"We are guilty\"? From a Socialist work,\r\nTrachtenberg's Labor Year Book, 1919-1920, page 92, we quote the\r\nfollowing figures for Stedman's edification:\r\n\r\n     \"The total number of prosecutions for violation of the Espionage\r\n     Act from June 15, 1917, to July 1, 1918, were 988. Of these, 197\r\n     pleaded guilty and were sent to prison, 166 others were convicted\r\n     (a large number appealing), and 497 cases were pending for trial\r\n     July 1st, while 128 had been acquitted or dismissed up to that\r\n     time. The act has been enforced _with increasing vigor since that\r\n     date_, but no official figures subsequent thereto are available.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Trachtenberg, pages 93 and 94, the above cases do not\r\ninclude about 450 cases of \"conspiracy to obstruct draft\" under the\r\nPenal Code and Draft Act, 30 prosecutions for threats against the\r\nPresident, others under the treason statutes, and prosecutions under\r\nstate statutes and city ordinances, in \"number,\" says Trachtenberg,\r\n\"doubtless _greatly in excess_ of the federal prosecutions,\" including\r\n\"in New York City alone scores of cases.\" A flock of 27 Socialists was\r\nconvicted at Sioux Falls, S.D. (Trachtenberg, page 92), and at Chicago a\r\nherd of 166 I. W. W.'s, first cousins to the Socialists; while these\r\nfirst cousins were also indicted in various places in batches of 47, 38,\r\n27, 28, etc. (Ibid.) Nor do any of the foregoing figures include the\r\n\"arrests\" of _two or three thousand \"Communists\" who were members of\r\nStedman's party prior to September, 1919_.\r\n\r\nIn short, even accepting Stedman's extraordinary dictum that \"2,000\r\nSocialists ... arrested\" is the minimum necessary to force Socialists to\r\nconfess themselves \"guilty,\" that test is more than met by the arrests\r\nalready known.\r\n\r\nMartin Conboy, in summing up for the State in the proceedings before the\r\nNew York Assembly Judiciary Committee, on March 4, 1920, according to\r\nthe \"New York Times\" of March 5, 1920, accused the Socialist counsel and\r\nwitnesses of \"evasive and hypocritical sentiments, expressed on the\r\nwitness stand, to throw the dust of political, parliamentary and\r\ninoffensive acts into the eyes of this Committee and the correspondents\r\nof the newspapers.\" On the other hand, he said, \"the leaders of the\r\nSocialist Party\" lost \"no opportunity\" to \"impress upon the rank and\r\nfile of that organization that it is impossible to achieve the ultimate\r\ntriumph of their cause by political action,\" in support of which he\r\ncited the testimony in evidence as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Every manifesto, every platform, almost every utterance of the\r\n     Socialist orator carries with it the party mandate that the workers\r\n     of America should be organized industrially so as to be submissive\r\n     to the command of a revolutionary leadership.\r\n\r\n     \"In adopting a programme of industrial action, involving the use of\r\n     the general strike, the Socialist Party has stripped itself of the\r\n     mask of political action and stands revealed as a radical\r\n     revolutionary propaganda organization.'\"\r\n\r\nAnother part of Mr. Conboy's address we cite from the \"Sun and New York\r\nHerald\" of March 5, 1920:\r\n\r\n     \"The danger of revolution is more real than the nation realizes,\r\n     Mr. Conboy charged, saying that the Socialist Party seeks to set up\r\n     its rule here by the following 'unlawful methods':\r\n\r\n     \"'Obstruction of the Federal and State governments in all measures\r\n     relating to defense, thereby rendering the nation defenseless\r\n     against the attack of enemies from without and within.\r\n\r\n     \"'Destruction of government by mass action and insisting in all\r\n     teachings that political action must be backed by force.\r\n\r\n     \"'By making its members and those elected to office responsible\r\n     only to its dues-paying members, thereby relieving its agents of\r\n     obligation to established government.\r\n\r\n     \"'We are confronted with the necessity of determining how we shall\r\n     treat this group of persons who are in the United States but not\r\n     of it; who, while accepting the benefits of our laws and\r\n     constitutions and the sacrifices of blood and treasure given to\r\n     support them, refuse their support to them; who take all they can\r\n     get but will not give a life or a dollar to preserve, defend and\r\n     perpetuate the Government that is their sole and only guaranty of\r\n     life, liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness,' said Mr.\r\n     Conboy.\r\n\r\n     \"'It is the first time since the rebellion of 1861 that notice has\r\n     been plainly and explicitly served upon the Government of the\r\n     United States by a group of men residing within its borders that\r\n     they will not support or defend it, but that they will by all means\r\n     obstruct and resist its effort to maintain in time of stress its\r\n     national honor and existence.\r\n\r\n     \"'The Socialist Party of America is not a loyal organization\r\n     disgraced occasionally by the traitorous act of a member, but a\r\n     disloyal party composed of perpetual traitors.'\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in a part of his address reported in the \"New York Evening Sun\"\r\nof March 4, 1920, Mr. Conboy mentioned the fact that \"at the National\r\nConvention of the Socialist Party of America held in St. Louis,\" in\r\nApril, 1917, \"its members were directed to deny and repudiate allegiance\r\nto this Government,\" and added:\r\n\r\n     \"The explanation of the anti-American attitude of the Socialist\r\n     Party of America during the war lies in the anti-national and\r\n     pro-international character of its programme. Its members are not\r\n     occasional but perpetual traitors, in constant conflict not merely\r\n     with the purposes of any temporary administration of the affairs of\r\n     this Government, but with the very institutions and fundamental\r\n     laws. They are citizens not of the United States, but subjects of\r\n     the Internationale, whose pronouncements are to be given their\r\n     moral support, a support which they not only withhold from but deny\r\n     to the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\n     \"The principal exponent of this party, who appears here in the dual\r\n     capacity of witness in chief and counsel in chief, is the\r\n     international secretary for America of the International Socialist\r\n     Bureau.\"\r\n\r\nTo complete our information concerning the Moscow International, we add\r\nhere some details concerning its Executive Committee, and the right of\r\nrepresentation on it enjoyed by the affiliated \"Parties\" in other lands\r\nthan Russia, including, no doubt, the Socialist Party of America.\r\nTrachtenberg's Labor Year Book, 1919-1920, in its article, \"The Moscow\r\nInternational Communist Conference\" (held at Moscow, March 2-6, 1919),\r\nsays, page 312:\r\n\r\n     \"The Conference ... perfected the organization of the new\r\n     International and entrusted the direction of the work to an\r\n     Executive Committee consisting of one representative from the\r\n     Communist parties of the more important countries. The parties in\r\n     Russia, Germany, German-Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Sweden and\r\n     the Balkan Federation, were directed to send members to the\r\n     Executive Committee. Parties which have declared their adherence to\r\n     the new International will be given seats in the Executive\r\n     Committee, pending the arrival of delegates from other countries.\r\n     The members of the Committee from the country in which the\r\n     Executive Committee has its seat [Russia] were empowered to plan\r\n     the work of the new organization. The Executive Committee was\r\n     authorized to elect a bureau consisting of five members to do the\r\n     actual work of the Committee.\"\r\n\r\nHas the Socialist Party of America contributed its Executive\r\nCommitteeman to this revolutionary machine? Even so, the orders, or\r\n\"suggestions,\" evidently come from the Bolshevist Bureau of Five who \"do\r\nthe actual work of the Committee.\" Are these the Russian power that,\r\naccording to correspondence found in a raid of the Lusk Committee, has\r\nalready appointed Eugene V. Debs to reign over us \"as 'Proletarian\r\nDictator' of the United States\" as soon as the plotted revolution is\r\npulled off in this country? (See \"The National Civic Federation Review\"\r\nfor July 30, 1919.) Are these the power, too, according to report, that\r\ninduced the Italian Socialists and Syndicalists to postpone their\r\nproposed revolution to a more convenient season? And was this to give\r\nSoviet Russia a chance to put through a temporary peace or truce with\r\nEurope to stave off \"economic catastrophe?\" If so, the twitching\r\nrevolutionaries in other lands must evidently train their toes to dance\r\nat Moscow's convenience.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, under the International, the diabolical work of getting the\r\nimmoral elements ready for violence goes on in every land, including the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nLet Hillquit excuse, extenuate, deny and palaver as he may, it remains\r\ntrue that the Socialist Party of America teaches the same treasonable\r\ndoctrines of violence and insurrection as the Russian Bolshevists, but\r\nin a more covert way. We have a sample in the pamphlet, \"The\r\nDictatorship of the Proletariat,\" put in evidence on January 27, 1920,\r\nin the inquiry of the Judiciary Committee at Albany. It is published by\r\nthe Jewish Socialist Federation of America, New York City, a part of the\r\nSocialist Party of America. It says in part:\r\n\r\n     \"Socialism does not believe in the State, wants to annihilate it\r\n     entirely. It holds that the task of the State has always been to\r\n     oppress the country in the interests of one class. So long as there\r\n     are classes in society which seek supremacy, the mastery, there\r\n     must be a State. But as soon as classes are eliminated the State\r\n     will have no justification for existence, and it will disappear of\r\n     itself.\r\n\r\n     \"The Socialist movement rouses the workingmen to revolution. It\r\n     preaches to them the class struggle, awakens within them\r\n     class-consciousness, makes all necessary preparations for\r\n     Socialistic order. When society is ready for the overturn, when the\r\n     Socialistic organization feels that the moment has come, it will\r\n     make the revolution.\r\n\r\n     \"The dictatorship will be employed for the one thing, to eliminate\r\n     capitalism by force, take away by force the capital from private\r\n     owners and transfer it to the ownership of the community. The\r\n     industries will be managed by the workingmen through their soviets.\r\n\r\n     \"Let the true Socialists stand as sentinels; let them see that the\r\n     Socialist programs strike with hot, revolutionary blood. The great\r\n     task of the Socialist movement is to create an army in this country\r\n     which should be ready to make the Socialist revolution when the\r\n     suitable moment arrives. This army must know its aims and the\r\n     method of attaining these aims, must be an intelligent army. Every\r\n     soldier in it must himself know the way, the plans, the strategy.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Outline of the Evidence Taken Before the Judiciary Committee to\r\nand Including February 5, 1920,\" issued by counsel for the State, they\r\nquote from the Yiddish book, cited above, referring to the printed\r\n\"Testimony,\" pages 199, 204 and 207, in proof that the Jewish Socialist\r\nFederation, which published the book, is \"part of the Socialist Party,\"\r\nand introducing their citations from the book with the very significant\r\nremark, \"Published in Yiddish the principles of Socialism were not\r\ncamouflaged as they frequently are in English.\" Bearing this in mind,\r\nlet us note how this plain-spoken book, which we cite from the State\r\ncounsel's \"Outline,\" pages 31-34, gives the lie to Hillquit's camouflage\r\nabout \"revolution\" being \"evolution.\" The book says:\r\n\r\n     \"History teaches us that through evolution, through natural\r\n     developments alone, no ruling class in society has ever been\r\n     deposed from its power.... Workingmen cannot depend on '_peaceful_\r\n     evolution'; they must prepare for a revolution, and\r\n     class-dictatorship....\r\n\r\n     \"To the Socialist at present, the meaning of class struggle,\r\n     Internationale and Dictatorship of the Proletariat, must be clear.\r\n     He must understand that Socialism is not a reform movement. He must\r\n     know that Socialism is a Revolutionary world-perspective, and that\r\n     the Socialist movement is a Revolutionary movement.... He must\r\n     cease to be a moral preacher and become a fighter. He must know\r\n     that the Socialist movement is a red movement, a movement with\r\n     blood in the veins, which knows that nothing in life can be won\r\n     without a struggle.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the real stuff, hid in a foreign tongue, with which Hillquit's\r\ngang poisons the East Side of New York City, while the gang's leaders\r\nlie to the American people.\r\n\r\nYet if the real plan is not to give us Socialism by \"peaceful evolution\"\r\nbut to impose it on us by \"a revolution, and class-dictatorship,\" what\r\nis the real object of the \"political action\" carried on meantime by\r\nthese hypocrites? Again the Yiddish book gives us the real thing:\r\n\r\n     \"So long as the State is ... a tool in the hands of the bourgeoisie\r\n     in the fight against the proletariat, ... why do the Socialists\r\n     seek to send their representatives there? Where do Socialists fit\r\n     into the State? What can they do there?\r\n\r\n     \"Socialists seek to enter into the government for two reasons,\r\n     first, to be nearer to the doors of the chambers, where\r\n     dictatorship sits, and second to hinder the dictatorial work in any\r\n     way possible. The first reason is the most important. Sitting in\r\n     Parliament or in Congress, being inside of the government ranks,\r\n     affords Socialists an opportunity to find out the plans, the\r\n     strategy of the State. And knowing this, they can carry out the\r\n     propaganda the better.\"\r\n\r\nIf this is not treason--wickedness using \"political party\" methods both\r\nas a mask and a blackjack to destroy the State--what is it?\r\n\r\nTo be forewarned is to be forearmed. Ample proof has been given in this\r\nchapter to show that there is a nation-wide conspiracy to destroy our\r\ngovernment and institutions and replace the Stars and Stripes by the red\r\nflag. I. W. W.'s, Communists, Communist Laborites, Socialists and\r\nSocialist Laborites have united under the leadership of the Bolshevist\r\nGovernment of Russia. Their agents are everywhere, everywhere\r\nhypocritically protesting that in our land freedom, of speech and\r\nfreedom of assemblage are no longer tolerated. Unless our loyal citizens\r\npromptly rally to the defense of America, disorder, strife and rebellion\r\nwill be seething everywhere, the foundations of the glorious nation that\r\nsprang from the blood of the brave soldiers of '76 will be completely\r\nundermined, our country will be afflicted with evils far more grave than\r\nthose averted by the heroes who fought and died in 1812, and the land\r\nthat we love will fall a prey to the terrible ravages of crime,\r\nlawlessness and anarchy.\r\n\r\nWe must save our country, and save it now. Now is the time to act--now,\r\nbefore it is too late; and we must act so effectively and so vigorously\r\nthat the Socialists and all their allied, criminal, revolutionary crews\r\nwill wish that they never had seen a red flag or left their homes\r\nabroad. They are conspiring enemies of our country. They are traitors to\r\nthe flag under which Washington and his soldiers fought for the\r\nindependence of America; traitors to the flag to whose defense the brave\r\nmen of 1812 rallied; traitors to the flag for which a million soldiers\r\nsuffered or died in our great Civil War. They are traitors to the flag\r\nthat symbolizes the union of countless happy homes under a democratic\r\ngovernment held in honor, respect and veneration. Traitors they are to\r\nthe flag that stands for freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom\r\nof the press, and for the protection of individual as well as of family\r\nrights. They are traitors to the flag of a much slandered and\r\ncalumniated government, which, though imperfect, like all things on this\r\nearth, extends its blessings to all, not even excepting ungrateful\r\nSocialists and other radicals.\r\n\r\nFellow citizens and fellow countrymen, rally to the defense of the flag\r\nthat you love! Denounce, to the north, south, east and west, the evil\r\nteachings and deceptions of the Red conspirators; for there is nothing\r\nthat will more quickly ruin the parties of Reds than to reveal to the\r\nworld their professed and secret teachings.\r\n\r\n    \"Immortal patriots, rise once more!\r\n    Defend your rights, defend your shore!\r\n    Let no rude foe with impious hand,\r\n    Invade the shrine where sacred lies\r\n    Of toil and blood the well earned prize.\r\n    While off'ring peace, sincere and just,\r\n    In heav'n we place a manly trust,\r\n    That truth and justice shall prevail,\r\n    And every scheme of bondage fail.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nSOCIALISM A PERIL TO WORKINGMEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn glowing colors the imaginations of Socialists have beautifully\r\npictured their utopian state for the benefit of the credulous and\r\noppressed. Unfortunately, however, for the followers of Karl Marx, a\r\nlittle reasoning and common sense show that their visionary state,\r\ninstead of being a heavenly paradise, would in reality be a descent into\r\nchaos and anarchy. Domestic peace would be a blessing of the past.\r\nDiscontent, wrangles, fights, riots, civil discord and sabotage would be\r\nthe order of the day till irrepressible rebellion had sounded the\r\ndeath-knell of Socialism.\r\n\r\nThere is every indication that the Revolutionists would not destroy our\r\npresent system of government without having recourse to arms. Besides\r\nthe many convincing proofs given in the preceding chapter, we learn from\r\n\"The Call,\" New York, January 28, 1912, that the celebrated Socialist\r\nnovelist, Jack London, scouted the idea that the social revolution would\r\nbe realized without force. Then, again, Victor Berger--who was Socialist\r\nCongressman from Wisconsin, and who, like Debs, was one of the\r\n\"innocents\" whom the \"poor,\" \"persecuted\" Reds have been trying to save\r\nfrom a long imprisonment by a nationwide agitation for amnesty--writing\r\nin the \"Social Democratic Herald\" of Milwaukee, on August 14, 1909,\r\nsaid: \"We should be grateful if the social revolution, if the freeing of\r\n75,000,000 whites would not cost more blood than the freeing of\r\n4,000,000 negroes in 1861.\"\r\n\r\nRoland Sawyer, the Socialist candidate for governor of Massachusetts in\r\n1912, writing in \"The Call,\" New York, October 1, 1911, dares to confess\r\nthat \"the conceptions of modern Socialism are all found in a cruder form\r\non the streets of Paris during the Revolution.\" Finally, as we have\r\nseen, Eugene V. Debs, who on four different occasions was the Socialist\r\ncandidate for the presidency of the United States, in the \"Appeal to\r\nReason,\" Girard, Kansas, September 2, 1911, said: \"Let us marshal our\r\nforces and develop our power for the revolt.... A few men may be needed\r\nwho are not afraid to die. Be ye also ready.... Let us swear that we\r\nwill fight to the last ditch, that we will strike blow for blow, that we\r\nwill use every weapon at our command, that we will never surrender.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that if, after a bloody rebellion, the Socialists should\r\noverthrow the United States Government, the many millions of defeated\r\npatriotic Americans would continue to be the enemies of the new regime.\r\nBut even if no rebellion took place, and the present system of\r\ngovernment were overthrown merely by the ballot, the new state would\r\nbegin life with millions of enemies, those, namely, who for one reason\r\nor another had been radically opposed to Socialism.\r\n\r\nWhen the Marxians come into power, several large factions of them\r\nusually rebel against the government of the Socialists, as in Russia,\r\nGermany and Bavaria.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists, in most cases, gain control of a country after a foreign\r\nwar, at a time when it is most difficult for even the wisest and most\r\nexperienced statesmen to solve the serious problems of the hour. Great\r\ndiscontent should, therefore, be expected from the failure of\r\ninexperienced agitators after coming into power, because of their\r\ninability to solve an almost endless number of serious difficulties.\r\nForemost among these would probably be food difficulties, which, as in\r\nRussia, Germany, and Hungary, have resulted in widespread opposition to\r\nthe newly established regimes.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists have never yet made known to the people of America the\r\ndetailed working plan of their proposed state. They have, of course,\r\nmade lots of very general statements, which do not stand the test of\r\naccurate criticism, but they have utterly failed to offer solutions of\r\nthe grave difficulties that they know would confront them. They prefer\r\nto let the future work out the solution, and, in the meantime, invite us\r\nto ruin our present form of government and industry, imagining that we\r\nAmericans are a lot of ignorant children who will entrust our destinies\r\nto a pack of wild theorists with nothing but a vague hope of a\r\npropitious future.\r\n\r\nThink of the discontent which would result if our people tore down the\r\nold structure, to find no structure whatever into which to move. They\r\nwould be in the same predicament as the people of San Francisco in the\r\ndays after the earthquake and fire, when they had to camp out in the\r\nopen with an insufficient food supply, exposed to the inclemency of the\r\nweather. In fact, they would be far worse off. A big-hearted world\r\nrushed supplies to the San Franciscans and soon helped them to surmount\r\ntheir difficulties. But the new Socialist state would be attacked from\r\nwithin and without, by citizens hoping to destroy the hated form of\r\ngovernment, and by foreign nations dreading the spread of anarchy, just\r\nas the United States, England and France blockaded Socialist Russia,\r\ncausing untold trouble to the Bolshevist government.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of embarrassments like these the inexperienced Marxian\r\nagitators must attempt to solve ten thousand times ten thousand problems\r\nwhich require skill in the extreme and years of careful thought. Would\r\nnot this result in widespread discontent? Or would the citizens of the\r\nUnited States, who just before the dawn of Socialism had been taught by\r\nDebs and his crew to find fault with everything under the sun, suddenly\r\nlearn patience and remain as meek as lambs merely because the Socialists\r\nhad raised the Red flag in place of the Star Spangled Banner?\r\n\r\nNo sooner would the all-perfect Socialists take control at Washington\r\nthan the endeavors of the new state to settle the serious difficulties\r\nconfronting it would occasion so much discontent and strife as seriously\r\nto threaten, if not actually bring to an end, the very existence of the\r\nnew government. For, first of all, the people would have to determine\r\nwhether the immense number of property owners, whose goods must be taken\r\nover by the state, should receive full payment, partial payment, or no\r\npayment at all.\r\n\r\nThe famous Belgian Socialist, Vandervelde, informs us that we may group\r\ninto three categories the plans of socialization proposed by different\r\nschools, according to their aiming at the expropriation of the means of\r\nproduction without indemnity, with complete indemnity, or with limited\r\nindemnity. [\"Collectivism and Industrial Evolution,\" by Vandervelde,\r\npage 152 of the 1904 translation into English.--Chas. H. Kerr and\r\nCompany.]\r\n\r\nIf full compensation were granted, millions of Socialists would become\r\nexceedingly disgusted and discontented, for not only would the new state\r\nfrom the very beginning of its existence be burdened with a tremendous\r\ndebt through having to borrow many billions of dollars, if such a thing\r\nwere possible, in order to make the purchases, but--which would make\r\nmatters much worse--many of the property owners, who even now are hated\r\nand detested by the Socialists, could, after receiving payment, either\r\nsit down for the rest of their lives and watch the Revolutionists labor\r\nand toil, or else, while doing some work themselves, could use their\r\nwealth in bribing the Socialist officials to bestow on them all kinds of\r\nprivileges and favors.\r\n\r\nIf no compensation whatever were granted, then, in addition to the\r\nhatred and disgust for the new system, which would prevail among the\r\nmillions who would be dispossessed of their property, after long years\r\nof work and careful saving in order to purchase it, there would also be\r\nboundless dissatisfaction on the part of persons who, still respecting\r\nGod's Commandments and the sense of right in natural conscience, would\r\nwant to see justice and honesty reign throughout America.\r\n\r\nFinally, if partial payment were made, both those opposed to full\r\ncompensation and those in favor of it would be displeased because of the\r\nreasons given, which would still influence them very decidedly. If the\r\nindemnity paid were very small, the former property owners and all\r\nhonest citizens would be those especially offended. If the amount paid\r\nwere large, dishonest Socialists would take offense. Therefore, no\r\nmatter which plan of expropriation were adopted, the state would make a\r\ngreat number of new enemies.\r\n\r\nThough we learn from page 186 of the \"Proceedings of the 1908 National\r\nConvention of the Socialist Party\" that the delegates to the convention,\r\nafter a factional dispute on party principles, declared by a vote of 102\r\nto 33 for the collective ownership of _all_ the land, and thus\r\ndetermined that the state should take over all the farms of the country,\r\nstill it cannot be denied that a great number of Revolutionists have\r\nclaimed, especially of late years, that the government should not\r\ndispossess the small farmers of their properties. On account of the\r\nrival theories of the two contending factions, the Socialist state might\r\nhave to pass through a serious ordeal before either plan was adopted.\r\nShould the new government finally determine to take possession of such\r\nproperty, millions of farmers and their families would become\r\nexceedingly hostile to the government. Should the state allow former\r\nowners to cultivate the fields about their old homesteads, the\r\ndiscontent would be but partially lessened, for strict obedience to the\r\ncommands of government bosses would replace the freedom of action once\r\nenjoyed by the farmer's family.\r\n\r\nPages 167 to 190 of the \"Proceedings of the 1908 National Convention of\r\nthe Socialist Party,\" and pages 220 to 235 of the \"Proceedings of the\r\n1910 National Congress of the Socialist Party,\" convinced us that very\r\nmany of the Revolutionists who oppose government ownership of _all_\r\nland do so in order to gain votes. It seems highly probable, therefore,\r\nthat if Socialism became the law of America many of the apparently\r\nmoderate Revolutionists would throw off their masks and unhesitatingly\r\ndeclare for the most radical plan of government ownership.\r\n\r\nYet even if the contemplated state should permit the private ownership\r\nof small farms, their owners would be displeased because they would no\r\nlonger be allowed to hire laborers for working the fields. Some\r\nconservative Socialists, indeed, profess willingness to tolerate the\r\nemployment of one or two farm hands. But not alone do the 1908 National\r\nPlatform and the amendment adopted by party referendum on September 7,\r\n1909, oppose exploitation, or the employment of hired labor in the\r\nproduction of goods, but innumerable articles in Socialist papers, books\r\nand reviews denounce exploitation most emphatically. Hence, if the\r\nSocialist state allowed farmers in good standing with the government to\r\nown little farms, they could not hire labor to operate them. If the\r\nfarmer should fall sick, his crops would go to ruin. Advantage could not\r\nbe taken of some of the great inventions helpful to agriculture, nor\r\nscientific methods of work and management. The individual farmer, thus\r\nhandicapped, might feed himself, his wife, his children, his horse, his\r\ncow, his pig, but very little more.\r\n\r\nIn the Socialist state great discontent would arise from either the\r\ntoleration or prohibition of small business enterprises. If permitted,\r\nwithout power to hire labor, they must compete with the government. If\r\nforbidden, large numbers of persons would be obliged to work for the\r\ngovernment, after losing little stores or shops in which for years they\r\nhad been interested.\r\n\r\nIn its issue of March 30, 1912, the \"Appeal to Reason,\" then the leading\r\nSocialist weekly of the United States, declared that under Socialism\r\nJohn D. Rockefeller would be allowed to retain his money and decide what\r\nto do with it. Were this the case, and every person of wealth allowed to\r\nretain his money, it is difficult to see how Socialists who hate and\r\ndetest the rich could endure such a condition, any more than they could\r\ntolerate the granting of full or partial indemnity to property owners.\r\nThe attempt to leave the rich in possession of their wealth would\r\nprobably incite Socialists to rise in arms against the state they had\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if wealth were confiscated, the wealthy and the\r\nhonest poor alike would be discontented with a dishonest government.\r\nMoreover, where would the Socialists draw the line of lawful possession?\r\nAt $1,000,000, $10,000, $1,000, or $100? Would the decision be reached\r\npeaceably? Would the use and possession of government bonds be allowed?\r\nAs the desire to acquire is one of the strongest passions, bitter hatred\r\nwould assail the Socialist state, which, Debs tells us, would prohibit\r\nbusiness profits, rent and interest. [\"Socialism and Unionism,\" by\r\nEugene V. Debs.] How could insurance companies, in which the American\r\npeople have invested so much, and which depend on interest, exist under\r\nSocialism? Socialism having ruined the insurance companies, would the\r\nmillions of policyholders just sit down and have a good, hearty laugh\r\nover their losses?\r\n\r\nThe real crux of Socialism is the inability of the Marxians to determine\r\nupon a system of employment and a scale of wages or remuneration\r\nsatisfactory both to the government and the working classes.\r\n\r\nRemuneration must either be in the form of money, or of goods or labor\r\ncertificates entitling the holder to receive goods from the government\r\nstores. As labor certificates would be like money, we shall class them\r\nas \"money\" when speaking of wages.\r\n\r\nDifferent schemes of employment have been proposed by Socialists. One of\r\nthe oldest allows each individual to select the occupation he desires,\r\nprovided he can do the work. All citizens, under this system, receive\r\nequal pay or equal supplies for their services.\r\n\r\nSuch a system is absurd. The more repugnant occupations, no matter how\r\nimportant for the welfare of the nation, would be neglected. All would\r\nwant easy, clean jobs. Bootblacks might prefer to become artistic\r\ndecorators; street-cleaners would ask to be put in charge of big\r\nfactories; night-workers would prefer day-work. The result would be\r\nendless discontent, jealousy and disorder. As everybody would receive\r\nequal recompense, the system would set a premium on sloth and\r\ninefficiency, and entail state bankruptcy. One of the most serious\r\nobjections would be the discontent among skilled workingmen, who would\r\nwant skill to be a determining factor in the wage scale. Yet should\r\ntheir system of equal remuneration not prevail, unskilled laborers, led\r\nby agitators to believe that equal wages would be paid to all, would\r\nbecome the sworn enemies of the government. A second system, favored by\r\nmany Socialists would permit all citizens to choose their occupations\r\nand allow each individual to draw upon the national storehouses\r\n_according to his needs_. [Gotha Programme of the Socialists of\r\nGermany.]\r\n\r\nThis scheme, like the first, is absolutely absurd. It would permit all\r\nto demand more than they needed, would encourage sloth, would bankrupt\r\nthe state, and would occasion discontent among skilled workingmen. Under\r\nthis system, too, the entire population would neglect the more\r\ndistasteful occupations, and ill-feeling and jealousy would arise in the\r\nhearts of those failing to obtain congenial positions.\r\n\r\nAs diligence should be a determining factor in the arrangement of the\r\nwage scale, in considering the remaining systems we shall assume that\r\nthe wages are those for men whose diligence may be termed first class.\r\n\r\nMany Socialists, foreseeing the evils of a mad rush to obtain the\r\nattractive positions, yet realizing how intolerable it would be for the\r\nstate to drive its citizens into uncongenial occupations, have\r\nendeavored to find a way out. Several solutions have been proposed,\r\namong which is the one we shall call the third system.\r\n\r\nIn the third system, occupations may be chosen by those qualified to do\r\nthe work. The recompense would be the same for all, but with the hours\r\nof toil lessened in proportion to the disagreeableness of the work.\r\n[\"Looking Backward,\" by Bellamy, Chapter 7, Social Democratic Publishing\r\nCompany of Milwaukee.] But such a system would give more reason than\r\never for jealousy and discontent on the part of skilled workingmen, who\r\nwould be terribly incensed at seeing street cleaners and garbage\r\ncollectors for example receive salaries equal to their own and at the\r\nsame time enjoy shorter hours. This system would put a premium on such\r\noccupations as sewer-cleaning and dish-washing, and would discourage\r\npersons from pursuing occupations of the highest importance to the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nMorris Hillquit, writing in \"Everybody's,\" December, 1913, page 826,\r\ntells us that \"the national government might well own and operate all\r\nmeans of interstate transportations and communication, such as railroad\r\nsystems, telegraph and telephone lines; all sources of general and\r\nnational wealth, such as mines, forests, oil-wells; and all monopolized\r\nor trustified industries already organized on a basis of national\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\"Similarly the state government might assume the few industries confined\r\nwithin state limits; while the municipal government would logically\r\nundertake the management of the much wider range of peculiarly local\r\nbusiness, such as street transportation and the supply of water, light,\r\nheat and power.\r\n\r\n\"Still other local industries, too insignificant or unorganized even for\r\nmunicipal operation, might be left to voluntary co-operative\r\nenterprises.\"\r\n\r\nOn page 829 of the same issue of \"Everybody's,\" Hillquit adds that\r\n\"under a system of Socialism each worker will be a partner in the\r\nindustrial enterprise in which he will be employed, sharing in its\r\nprosperity and losses alike.\"\r\n\r\nAt first sight this fourth plan seems attractive, but upon examination\r\nwe notice that nothing is said as to how the millions of persons to be\r\nemployed by the national, state or municipal governments will be\r\nassigned to the different enterprises. Will the people be forced to\r\nlabor at repugnant tasks? That will make endless turmoil and trouble in\r\nthe Marxian state. But if all persons enjoy equal rights under the\r\nSocialist government there would be a grand rush for the most congenial\r\noccupations, and especially for the most lucrative. The result would be\r\nan immense amount of discontent and jealousy in those who failed to\r\nsecure the positions they desired. True, these objections might not hold\r\nfor well-to-do persons like Hillquit, founder of the \"New York Call,\"\r\nfor he and other Socialist politicians who have become wealthy by always\r\nremaining leaders of their dues-paying comrades might, perhaps, invest\r\ntheir money in co-operative enterprises. But such persons constitute\r\nonly a small part of the population of the country.\r\n\r\nThe many objections brought against these four systems could not be\r\nobviated by the adoption of a fifth, in which all would be free to\r\nchoose their occupations, and would for the same number of hours of work\r\nreceive as recompense an amount determined by all the factors which\r\nshould be taken into consideration, such as skill, the physical\r\ndifficulty of the labor, danger, disagreeableness of the work and the\r\nincreased value added to the raw material.\r\n\r\nIn trying to arrange the details of such a system, innumerable\r\ndifficulties would arise. Unskilled laborers would want physical labor\r\nrather than skill or talent made the principal factor in determining the\r\nscale; for they would recall the promises of Socialist orators that in\r\nthe new state all should enjoy equal rights, and they would consider it\r\na grave injustice to work as hard or even harder than skilled laborers\r\nand yet receive lower wages through want of skill and talent due to no\r\nfault of theirs. Should the plea of these millions of unskilled\r\nlaborers go unheeded, the new state could count them among its most\r\nbitter enemies.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, skilled laborers would want skill and talent to be\r\nthe main factors in determining wages, arguing that they had worked hard\r\nto become proficient and that their talent and skill made the work more\r\nvaluable to the state. They would protest that they should not suffer\r\nsimply because unskilled laborers lacked their skill and talent. Should\r\nthe skilled workingmen not be heard, the new state would have another\r\nthrong of enemies.\r\n\r\nCompromises might be attempted by different adjustments of talent and\r\nskill to physical labor in determining the wage schedule; but in each\r\ncase the new regime would only be at the beginning of troubles. What\r\nbitter disputes among the skilled workingmen in different trades! There\r\nwould be conflicting views of every sort regarding the exact amount of\r\nskill and of physical labor required in the different trades, and\r\nregarding the difficulties, disagreeableness of work, dangers to health\r\nand life, and increased value added to the raw material in each line.\r\n\r\nBut what would happen even if the ship of state under the red flag and\r\nits mast could weather the wage-storm and come safely into port with\r\nsome working system?\r\n\r\nThe people, we are told, would enjoy equal rights. The government could\r\nnot refuse to grant work to any qualified person applying for it.\r\nSuppose the members of some trade, the carpenters, for example,\r\ndispleased with the wages they were getting, should apply for other work\r\nand stick to it until the government was forced to grant their demands.\r\nOther craftsmen, seeing how easily the carpenters had won their strike,\r\nwould imitate their example. Thus would occur derangements of the\r\nintricate wage scale--which had occupied the attention of the country\r\nfor so long a time and been adopted only after the greatest\r\ndifficulty--causing great discontent and jealousy, while the economic\r\nlosses through successful strikes would raise the prices of commodities,\r\nbringing on a general fever of discontent.\r\n\r\nA further source of trouble would be the problem of determining what\r\nwages should be paid to shirkers and those incapable of working with\r\nefficiency. Would wage courts decide the value of their services? If so,\r\nhow many thousands of such courts would be required? If not, would state\r\nofficials or politicians decide the cases? The wages of such persons,\r\nno matter how determined, would cause discontent.\r\n\r\nIt would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to determine justly\r\nand accurately the wages of eminent specialists, physicians and persons\r\nwhose important services the state could not afford to lose. If very\r\nhigh wages were awarded them, the poorer classes would take offence at\r\nthe prospect of a rich class once more rising with power to suppress\r\nthem, as many do at the present time. If low wages were paid to eminent\r\nspecialists, they would neglect important pursuits and vocations to the\r\ndetriment of the nation's welfare. Even if they received moderately high\r\nwages, other persons of the same profession would become offended at the\r\ngovernment's refusal to grant them like salaries and would line up with\r\nthe enemies of the Socialist state.\r\n\r\nEven under the most favorable circumstances, the fifth wage-system would\r\nproduce two classes, the comparatively rich, and the comparatively poor,\r\na condition repugnant to Socialists.\r\n\r\nThe forcing of women to work, in accordance with Socialistic doctrines,\r\nwould arouse opposition to the new government. The husbands, fathers and\r\nsons of the women would be displeased with the wretched way in which\r\ntheir homes would be kept and their meals prepared.\r\n\r\nA further source of tremendous discontent in the Socialist state would\r\nbe the prevalence[14] of political corruption to a far greater extent\r\nthan under the present system. For there would be a far greater throng\r\nof state employes than now, and there would be an immense number of\r\npeople trying to get permissions, privileges and exemptions of every\r\ndescription. With human nature unchanged, but with the opportunities for\r\ndeals and bribery greatly multiplied, political corruption would greatly\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nAnother important cause would be in operation. Socialism is spreading\r\nanti-religious and atheistic doctrines, loosing men and women from their\r\nmoral restraints. With dishonesty thus increasing, acceptors of bribes\r\nwould not only be more common in the Marxian state, but the average\r\nnumber of their offences would increase; for since opportunities of\r\ncollecting large single sums would be rarer than at present, owing to\r\nabolition of the capitalist system and the small amount of wealth\r\npossessed by individuals, dishonest politicians would naturally endeavor\r\nto enrich themselves by granting corrupt favors to a larger number of\r\npeople. The reader himself can picture the condition of affairs in the\r\nSocialist state when large numbers of its citizens were its declared\r\nenemies because of a vast and hopeless system of political corruption.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist state would contain many persons who by soapbox orators\r\nand revolutionary authors were led to believe that police, soldiers and\r\ncourts would disappear. These persons would be greatly discontented when\r\nthe Socialist government still hedged them in by retaining the old\r\nsystem for the preservation of law and order, or, as in Russia, greatly\r\nincreased the restraint on their liberty by means of immense numbers of\r\nRed Guards, heavily armed and noted for cruelty. Or if these were taken\r\naway, the state would feel the enmity of all its better citizens who\r\nrealized the need for guardians, police, soldiers and courts, to protect\r\nthem from the crimes of the lawless.\r\n\r\nUnder the Socialist regime there would be atheists, fighting as in\r\nRussia, Mexico, France, Italy and Portugal for the propagation of their\r\ndoctrines, while in opposition to them would be millions of believers,\r\ndefending themselves from the attacks of the enemies of God. Any\r\nconcession granted by the state to one of these parties would arouse the\r\nenmity of the other.\r\n\r\nSo, too, there would be a rapidly growing faction in favor of free-love,\r\nas well as one opposed to it, and as each party would be extremely\r\npowerful, and use every effort to defeat its opponents, there would be\r\ngreat strife and discontent.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists in power in Europe, whether \"moderate\" or extremely\r\nradical, have made millions of enemies by imprisonments, executions,\r\nsuppression of free speech, the gagging of the press, the withholding\r\nfood, etc. Would these things happen in our country if the Reds gained\r\ncontrol?\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to believe that the Socialist Government would\r\nbecome exceedingly unpopular here as in Russia, owing to a great\r\nincrease in crime; for to say nothing of the criminal offences\r\noccasioned by the prevalent discontent of the citizens, the atheistical\r\nand anti-religious doctrines of the Revolutionists, by continuing to\r\nundermine the faith of the people in the existence of God and by leading\r\nthem to disbelieve in the rewards of heaven and the punishments of hell,\r\nwould very seriously interfere with the beneficent effects of several of\r\nthe most excellent preventives of crime.\r\n\r\nWith discontent, jealousy and crime reigning supreme in the state from\r\nits very birth, many who had hoped for the success of Socialism would\r\nbecome utterly disgusted with its absolute failure and would long for\r\nthe re-establishment of the old order. As the leaders of the Marxian\r\nmovement now make the most extravagant promises concerning perfections\r\nof their prospective state, their government, should it come, would\r\nsuffer the hatred of all who discovered that they had been cruelly\r\ndeceived.\r\n\r\nWe must remember, too, that the very persons who would discover that\r\nthey had been deceived by their Socialist teachers would be the very\r\nsame people who are now taught by the same teachers to find fault with\r\neverything under the sun. It would, therefore, be a terrible day for the\r\nnew state when the embittered rank and file of the Revolutionary Party\r\nfully realized the total failure of Socialism. The Socialist state would\r\nthen have millions of enemies, recruited from the Socialist Party\r\nitself, as well as from the ranks of those who had always opposed\r\nSocialism.\r\n\r\nNot alone would these enemies be far more numerous than those who oppose\r\nour present form of government, but their wrath and anger, wrought to\r\nfever heat by the many causes we have enumerated, as well as by the\r\nmistakes of the Marxian rulers, would urge them to commit deeds of\r\nviolence that have never yet been conceived even by the \"bomb squad\" of\r\nthe revolutionary I. W. W. Rebellion against the new government would be\r\nthe order of the day, and the Socialist state would not long endure. It\r\nwould crumble to pieces, and the poor workingman, in the midst of\r\nanarchy and the total destruction of industry, would deeply regret\r\nhaving listened to the crazed imaginations of silver-tongued fanatics.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLincoln Eyre's cables from Russia, received by the \"New York World\" when\r\nthis book was in type, more than corroborate the picture drawn in this\r\nchapter of the \"perils to workingmen\" from any attempt to put the\r\neconomic fallacies of Socialism into practice. In the first place,\r\naccording to Eyre's cable of February 26, 1920, printed in the \"World\"\r\nof February 28, 1920, all the blood and violence inflicted on Russia\r\nhave failed to establish real Communism there. Through courtesy of the\r\n\"World\" we give, in part, Eyre's statement as to this, from the cable\r\njust mentioned:\r\n\r\n     \"In wartime France, England or Germany no man could obtain for love\r\n     or money more than a specified maximum of food, fuel or the\r\n     household requirements. In wartime revolutionary Russia, ruled by a\r\n     communist dictatorship, any man with enough thousand ruble notes\r\n     can buy all the food and warmth he desires. Throughout the war\r\n     dwellers in London, Paris or Berlin affected by war conditions\r\n     (and that meant practically everybody) were freed of paying rent by\r\n     a moratorium. Residents of Moscow and Petrograd are still obliged\r\n     to pay rent and at a higher figure than in pre-war days. These two\r\n     incontrovertible facts are evidence that an all-powerful Bolshevik\r\n     in the Communist Government has in two years installed a lesser\r\n     measure of Communism in actual practice than existed in the\r\n     belligerent European countries during the war years. To my mind\r\n     this is one of the severest, albeit the most rarely mentioned,\r\n     indictments of the Bolsheviks' vast communistic programme, since it\r\n     reveals their impotency to attain their initial aim--the abolition\r\n     of classes.\"\r\n\r\nIn the second place, not alone has there been failure to destroy\r\ncapitalism and equalize possessions, but new class distinctions and \"new\r\naristocracies\" have arisen. We quote Eyre on this point from the same\r\nissue of the \"World,\" February 28, 1920:\r\n\r\n     \"While capitalism in the larger sense of the term has been\r\n     destroyed, together with private ownership on a large scale,\r\n     capital continues to be accumulated and to make its influence felt.\r\n     One man may still possess more than another in worldly goods and\r\n     receive higher pay for his work. Equality of material possessions\r\n     is as non-existent in the Russian social republic as it is in the\r\n     American 'bourgeois' republic. Hence there are coming into\r\n     existence new groupings of Russian population, new lines of\r\n     economic demarcation, new forms of social standing and of wealth.\r\n     The beginning of two new aristocracies are detectable. One is found\r\n     in the governmental hierarchy, the other in the ever-increasing\r\n     speculator class.... The Soviets ... cannot do without the\r\n     speculators (which means all persons engaged in private trading).\"\r\n\r\nThirdly, \"Communist\" Russia already has her \"ruling class,\" as\r\nprivileged and as distinctly marked off from the ordinary day-laborer as\r\nin any \"bourgeois\" republic. We quote Eyre as to this from the same\r\narticle:\r\n\r\n     \"Governmental aristocracy has its boots imbedded in the Kremlin,\r\n     that ancient Moscow citadel.... In Soviet Russia today one speaks\r\n     of the Kremlin as one spoke of Versailles in the magnificent days\r\n     of Louis XIV.... Only the most eminent commissaries of the people\r\n     and a few other Soviet stars of the first magnitude are domiciled\r\n     there in the grandiose palaces that once housed the most famous\r\n     figures of Muscovite history.\r\n\r\n     \"Protected behind numerous barriers of bayonets and machine guns,\r\n     the Bolshevik chieftains have made this barbarically gorgeous\r\n     nesting place of Oriental autocracy the throbbing nerve centre of\r\n     world revolution.... And from its frowning gates they sally forth\r\n     in their high power limousines on affairs of state even as the\r\n     Czars in their day went forth to superintend the administration of\r\n     their colossal heritage.\r\n\r\n     \"Bolshevism's upper ten are in the Kremlin. The lesser lights of\r\n     the Bolshevik aristocracy must content themselves with quarters in\r\n     the 'Soviet houses,' which were the city's leading hotels, and are\r\n     now nationalized habitations reserved for prominent Soviet\r\n     officials. These buildings, like the Kremlin, are better heated and\r\n     generally cared for than most other domiciles and the food served\r\n     in them is slightly more abundant. Sentries guard the doors to\r\n     prevent unauthorized visitors from gaining admission....\r\n\r\n     \"The fact that some individuals ride to the opera in limousines\r\n     while the rest walk is necessarily productive of class division.\r\n     Already there is a slang term for the former--the proletarian\r\n     bourgeoisie, they are called.\"\r\n\r\nThe observant reader will also have gathered from the extract just given\r\nthat, fourthly, the \"ruling class\" of Communist Russia is much more\r\ndistrustful of the \"common people\" than any class in the United States,\r\nGreat Britain or France would think of being. Thus the lords and\r\nlordlings of the \"proletarian dictatorship\" barricade themselves in\r\n\"citadels,\" behind \"barriers of bayonets and machine guns,\" while\r\n\"sentries guard the doors\" to keep out \"visitors.\" What would we poor\r\n\"bourgeois\" Americans think if our wealthier inhabitants and public\r\nofficials kept \"common citizens\" out of range by such a display of\r\ninfantry and artillery?\r\n\r\nFifthly, despite all the gush about a \"workingmen's\" republic in Russia,\r\nthat country is now absolutely helpless under the yoke of the most\r\nabsolute autocracy the world has seen in a long while. As to this we\r\nquote Lincoln Eyre's cable, dated February 25, 1920, and published in\r\nthe \"New York World\" of February 27, 1920. Eyre says:\r\n\r\n     \"Lenine ... and Trotzky ... wield a more absolute power than any\r\n     Czar.... They are the only really strong men detectable among the\r\n     Bolsheviki or anywhere else in Russia. That their strength is\r\n     greater than ever is demonstrated by the amazing program for the\r\n     militarization of labor that they have just entered upon; a\r\n     programme which when first proposed aroused the Communist Party's\r\n     instant antagonism, but which in a few days the dictators easily\r\n     persuaded their disciples to support.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall return to this astounding conscription of labor a little\r\nfurther on. It is referred to here merely to show who actually does the\r\n\"ruling\" in the widely advertised \"labor\" government of Russia. Eyre\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n     \"There is iron law and order all over Russia, neither anarchy nor\r\n     chaos being visible.... With the recent abolition of the death\r\n     penalty the Red terror, long since bleached to pale pink, came to a\r\n     definite end. Such is the omnipotence of the Soviets that it is no\r\n     longer necessary for them to terrorize their opponents into\r\n     obedience.\"\r\n\r\nThus horrible butcheries are no longer necessary because no one longer\r\ndares to resist. All liberty, all self-government, all self-initiative\r\nhave been crushed in the iron vise of dictated policy. This is the case,\r\nas Eyre says, \"twenty-seven months after the social revolution gripped\r\nthe nation in a clutch of steel that never has been relaxed since.\" Is\r\nnot such mental, moral and spiritual death a greater calamity than\r\nphysical death?\r\n\r\nSixthly, the common people, crushed under this experimental Socialist\r\nJuggernaut, are starving to death. In the article last cited, in the\r\n\"World\" of February 27, 1920, Eyre says:\r\n\r\n     \"The food problem is hideously acute, yet not quite so critical as\r\n     at the outset of the winter. In Moscow, Petrograd and other\r\n     industrial centres some 8,000,000 human beings, of whom only a tiny\r\n     fraction are Bolsheviki, are slowly but surely starving to death.\r\n     There are abundant food stocks in the south and east, but they\r\n     cannot be carried in sufficient quantity over the semi-paralyzed\r\n     railroads....\r\n\r\n     \"Trotzky himself defined the industrial situation as a race between\r\n     economic reconstruction and reversion to savagery.\"\r\n\r\nSeventhly, craving for food is one of the things which make it\r\nimpossible to shut out the food speculator, whose extortion at least\r\nhelps to prolong life. As Eyre says:\r\n\r\n     \"City and country food speculation, which the dictatorship thus far\r\n     confesses its inability to suppress or even control, is fast\r\n     developing a new capitalist class right under the Communists'\r\n     noses. One of the most painful sights in Russia is some pale, thin,\r\n     tottering old woman paying out more than she earns in a week for a\r\n     few lumps of sugar bought from a well-fed trader from the country\r\n     in the Sukfarevka, Moscow's open air market place.\"\r\n\r\nEighthly, the common people are nearly as cold as they are hungry. In\r\nthe cable printed in the \"World\" of February 27, 1920, Eyre says:\r\n\r\n     \"Fuel is slightly less scarce than it was two months ago. The lack\r\n     of heat, however, is helping the food shortage to increase the\r\n     mortality rate, which is likely to attain 30 per cent in Moscow\r\n     before spring.\"\r\n\r\nIn the ninth place, disease stalks through the land, hand in hand with\r\ncold and famine. The article just cited contains the following by Eyre:\r\n\r\n     \"Disease is rampant, and the typhus epidemic in Siberia, where\r\n     Kolchak left many tens of thousands of victims behind him in his\r\n     retreat, is spreading swiftly westward. Owing to the absence of\r\n     medical supplies, the epidemic can be combated only by quarantine.\"\r\n\r\nIn the tenth place, \"labor\" in Russia, the real \"working class,\" is\r\nconscripted, enslaved under military discipline, and \"exploited\" under\r\nan incredible system of military court martial--a degradation of\r\nworkingmen by the Socialist tyrants of Russia which no form of modern\r\n\"capitalism\" has dreamed of since human slavery was abolished. On this\r\nsubject Eyre says, in the \"World\" of February 27, 1920:\r\n\r\n     \"Four of Trotzky's sixteen armies have been turned into 'labor\r\n     armies,' which means that soldiers fresh from victories on military\r\n     fronts are being obliged to work, still under military command and\r\n     discipline, on the 'economic front.' They are used chiefly for\r\n     building up the transport system and assuring shipment of food and\r\n     fuel from the country to the city....\r\n\r\n     \"Labor generally is being militarized to an amazing extent.\r\n     Discipline is being imposed upon factory workers by the\r\n     establishment of special tribunals with powers of courts martial.\r\n     Communist commissaries, no longer required at the front, are being\r\n     detached from their regiments and sent to stimulate production\r\n     endeavor in industries and railroads.\"\r\n\r\nIs this the kind of thing which Hillquit's Socialist gang of would-be\r\nlabor \"exploiters\" would lure America's liberty-loving workingmen into\r\nby calling them \"slaves\" in their present dignified situation as\r\nself-governed and self-reliant freemen? On December 13, 1919, the\r\npresidents and secretaries of the 113 national and international unions\r\naffiliated with the American Federation of Labor met at Washington, D.\r\nC., with the heads of the four railway brotherhoods and several\r\nfarmers' organizations, and are to be congratulated for having passed\r\nthe following resolution, which the late information from Russia\r\noverwhelmingly vindicates:\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas, the American Federation of Labor is an American\r\n     institution, believing in American principles and ideas, and\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas, an attempt is being made to inject the spirit of\r\n     Bolshevism and I. W. W.'ism into the affairs of the American\r\n     Federation of Labor, and\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas, the American Federation of Labor is opposed to\r\n     Bolshevism, I. W. W.'ism and the irresponsible leadership which\r\n     encouraged such a policy, therefore be it\r\n\r\n     \"Resolved, that the conference of representatives of trades unions\r\n     affiliated with the A. F. of L., and other organizations associated\r\n     in this conference, repudiate and condemn the policy of Bolshevism\r\n     and I. W. W.'ism as being destructive of American ideals and\r\n     impracticable in application; be it further\r\n\r\n     \"Resolved, that this conference reiterate the action of the\r\n     conventions of the American Federation of Labor, and the advocacy\r\n     of the principles of conciliation and voluntary arbitration and\r\n     collective bargaining.\"\r\n\r\nWe cite this here to put the freedom of self-determination, practiced by\r\nthe great progressive body of American labor, in vivid contrast with the\r\nabject slavery which the Socialists of Russia are now imposing upon the\r\nlabor of that country. Lincoln Eyre's statement of the labor situation\r\nin Russia is confirmed by Trotzky himself, as we learn from the \"New\r\nYork World\" of February 28, 1920, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"London, February 27.--Leon Trotzky, Minister of War of Soviet\r\n     Russia, addressing the third Russian Congress, held in Moscow\r\n     January 25 last, outlined the Bolshevist plan for converting the\r\n     Red Army into an army of labor. According to reports of his speech\r\n     reaching here he said:\r\n\r\n     \"'There is still one way open to the reorganization of national\r\n     economy--the way of uniting the army and labor and changing the\r\n     military detachments of the army into detachments of a labor army.\r\n\r\n     \"'Many in the army have already accomplished their military task\r\n     but they cannot be demobilized as yet. Now that they have been\r\n     released from their military duties, they must fight against\r\n     economic ruin and against hunger; they must work to obtain fuel,\r\n     peat and other heat-producing products; they must take part in\r\n     building, in clearing the lines of snow, in repairing roads,\r\n     building sheds, grinding flour, etc.\r\n\r\n     \"'We have already organized several of these armies and they have\r\n     been allotted their tasks. One army must obtain foodstuffs for the\r\n     workmen of the districts in which it was formerly stationed and it\r\n     also will cut wood, cart it to the railways and repair engines.\r\n     Another army will help in the laying down of railway lines for the\r\n     transport of crude oil. A third labor army will be used in\r\n     repairing agricultural implements and machines, and, in the spring,\r\n     will take part in the working of the land....\r\n\r\n     \"'Trade unions must register qualified workmen in the villages.\r\n     Only in those localities where trade union methods are inadequate\r\n     other methods must be introduced, in particular that of compulsion,\r\n     because labor conscription gives the state the right to tell the\r\n     qualified workmen who is employed on some unimportant work in his\r\n     village, \"You are obliged to leave your present employment and go\r\n     to Sormovo or Kolomna, because there your work is required.\"\r\n\r\n     \"'Labor conscription means that the qualified workmen who leave the\r\n     army must proceed to places where they are required, where their\r\n     presence is necessary to the economic system of the country. We\r\n     must feed these workmen and guarantee them the minimum food\r\n     ration.'\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt these \"qualified workmen\" are what we call \"skilled workmen.\"\r\nHere we have, in its naked reality, the \"deliverance\" from\r\n\"wage-slavery\" which the crazy Socialists of all schools have so long\r\nbeen preaching to the laboring freemen of America. How would the\r\nmillions of labor's noblemen in the American Federation of Labor like to\r\nsee Debs, Hillquit and Victor L. Berger cracking the whip over them\r\nafter the fashion of Lenine, Trotzky and Zinovieff in Russia?\r\n\r\nNotice the \"capitalistic\" language of Trotzky: \"_We_\"--the tyrannical,\r\nexploiting drones in the Kremlin--\"must feed these workmen and guarantee\r\nthem the _minimum_ food ration.\" Do not the \"workmen\" produce the food?\r\nThen why do they not take it and cut the throats of these drones? Is not\r\nthis the Socialist doctrine we are taught by our American theorists, who\r\nfroth at the mouth over the alleged \"wage-slavery\" of American workmen\r\nwho rear intelligent families in comfortable homes and maintain the\r\nindependence and self-initiative of American freemen?\r\n\r\nIn the eleventh place, we notice that the workmen of Russia, as a reward\r\nfor complete slavery under military conscription and courts martial\r\ntribunals, are guaranteed nothing but this \"minimum food ration\" and a\r\npossibility of being able to buy enough additional food out of their\r\nwages to postpone starvation. The last-mentioned possibility is\r\ndescribed for us by Lincoln Eyre in his cable in the \"New York World\" of\r\nFebruary 27, 1920, where, it must be remembered, he is speaking of the\r\nmost-favored workmen, in the big cities. He says:\r\n\r\n\"Nobody in Russia relying wholly upon 'Sovietsky' food--food handed out\r\nthrough official agencies--gets enough to eat except soldiers, a small\r\npercentage of heavy workers and high Soviet officials. Ordinary factory\r\nworkers seldom receive as much as 60 per cent of their alimentary\r\nrequirements through the Government. The remainder they must buy at\r\nfantastically high prices from speculators. And though they themselves,\r\nin collaboration with central dictatorship, fix their own wages, they\r\nnever earn enough to cover the swift-climbing cost of living. If this is\r\nthe plight of the workers, that is, of the ruling class, the ghastliness\r\nof the situation confronting the less favored elements of the population\r\nmay well be imagined.\"\r\n\r\nIs it in irony that Eyre speaks of these \"workers\" as \"the ruling\r\nclass\"? What are the real workmen in Russia but victims of this cruel\r\nexperiment of tyrannizing Socialist \"intellectuals\"?\r\n\r\nWe remark next, in the twelfth place, that the Soviet system of food\r\ndistribution, wholly unequal and thus anti-communistic, has resulted in\r\ndividing the Russians into eight classes, each category having a special\r\ncard defining its special ration. The account of this is given by\r\nLincoln Eyre in a cable dated March 9, 1920, and published in the \"New\r\nYork World\" of March 10, 1920, from which we take two sentences:\r\n\r\n     \"The commissariat of food control has gradually built up no less\r\n     than eight distinct classes.... Special cards also are provided for\r\n     children from one, two to five and from five to sixteen. It will be\r\n     seen that this totals eight distinct varieties of card.\"\r\n\r\nThe affect of these distinctions may be gathered from the following\r\ninstance given in the article just cited:\r\n\r\n     \"In the month of November there was distributed by the Petrograd\r\n     Soviet altogether 13,631,480 pounds of bread.... Had all the bread\r\n     been divided evenly among the whole population, each person would\r\n     have had about one-half a pound a a day, whereas, in fact, one\r\n     category got much less than that amount daily and the third\r\n     category none at all.\"\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth place, we note that the Russian Socialist tyrants give\r\nthe workmen, in exchange for their labor, pieces of paper run off from\r\nprinting presses which seem almost to have solved the problem of\r\nperpetual motion. The workmen are wise if they spend this fiat money\r\ndaily for whatever it will bring in food, for its value will collapse\r\nutterly when the dictatorship bursts, leaving the country financially\r\nprostrate, without credit or means of exchange. This is one of the\r\ngreatest bunco games ever practiced upon workingmen. Eyre describes it\r\nin a cable dated March 3, 1920, and published in the \"New York World\" of\r\nMarch 4, 1920, from which we quote:\r\n\r\n     \"In 'the Socialist Federative Republic of Soviets of Russia,' to\r\n     give the Bolshevik land its official title, no mention has been\r\n     made of finance. The reason for this is simple. There is no\r\n     finance, in the European or American sense of the word, in present\r\n     Russia. The Soviet Government pays its own people what it has to\r\n     pay in paper money, of which it prints unlimited quantities. Being\r\n     determined eventually to abolish money altogether in favor of\r\n     Communistic exchange of products, it is not worried about\r\n     depreciation in the value of its currency. It possesses about\r\n     1,000,000,000 rubles--the exact amount is kept very secret--in\r\n     gold, with which it intends to pay for goods purchased abroad until\r\n     it can establish a system of barter with foreign commercial\r\n     interests. From the capitalistic viewpoint its budgetary\r\n     expenditures are chaotic, but in Communistic eyes they are both\r\n     sane and logical.\"\r\n\r\nOnly to minds financially insane or criminally degenerate could such a\r\nsystem seem \"sane and logical.\" Their carefully kept store of gold shows\r\nthat the Bolshevist dictators are not insane but criminal. They\r\nunderstand their game, which is that of bunco-steering to \"exploit\"\r\nlabor on the largest scale the world has ever seen. Honest paper money\r\nis a promise to pay, for value received, in gold, silver or good\r\nmerchandise. If this form is used by these frauds, it is with the\r\ndeliberate intention of repudiation, the possibility of payment being\r\nalso destroyed by the floods of the stuff turned out. If the paper given\r\nis not a promise to pay, it is circulated simply through the tyranny of\r\nmen who by threat of punishment or starvation force workingmen to\r\nexchange a day's labor for a bit of food and a piece of paper. In either\r\ncase the labor exploiters in the Kremlin exact from Russia's workingmen,\r\nin exchange for a little food and a wad of paper, a genuine value, the\r\nproduct of hard labor, which these get-rich-quick Wallingfords can turn\r\ninto gold, or exchange with the world for anything they want. All that\r\nRussian workingmen get is semi-starvation and the temporary delusion,\r\nconveyed to them in fine speeches, that they are \"in the game,\" whereas\r\nthey are only its dupes.\r\n\r\nThe worthless character of the paper money, which the workmen\r\nnevertheless have to take and spend to keep soul and body together, is\r\nshown by the fact that the peasants refuse it. In his cable printed in\r\nthe \"New York World\" of February 27, 1920, Eyre says that \"the peasant\r\ntwenty miles outside of Moscow ... has more food than he can eat, more\r\nclothes than he can wear,\" yet \"refuses to sell his products for money\r\nexcept that proportion of them that he is compelled to turn over to the\r\nSoviets at a fixed price. In private trading,\" Eyre continues, \"he will\r\ntake in exchange for his foodstuffs only manufactured articles, clothing\r\nand other things he needs.\" Thus the peasant is fortunate in that he\r\nlives on land where he can at least raise enough to eat; whereas the\r\n\"proletarian,\" in whose behalf the Socialists pretend to have made the\r\nRussian revolution, is most of all victimized by it.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the Bolshevist dictators are now conscripting Russian\r\nlabor seems evident. These pick-pockets have finished exploiting the\r\nRussian aristocracy and \"bourgeoisie,\" squeezed them dry, and squandered\r\nwhat they stole. The only game left to them now is to exploit labor to\r\nthe limit and appropriate the profits.\r\n\r\nTwo other features of this thimble-rigging arrangement complete the\r\nexposure of the most inhuman scheme to exploit labor which the world has\r\nseen for centuries. One of these shows us, in the fourteenth place, that\r\nthe rascals Lenine and Trotzky, are actually inviting \"foreign capital\"\r\nto form a partnership with them in their exploitation of Russian labor,\r\nunder promise to turn over to this outside \"capital\" a good share of the\r\n\"profits\" to be wrung by labor conscription out of the sweat of Russia's\r\nbrow.\r\n\r\nThe invitation to \"foreign capital\" to join hands with the Bolshevist\r\ndictatorship, under promise of good profits and guarantees of security\r\nwas made by both Lenine and Trotzky through interviews granted to\r\nLincoln Eyre. Through courtesy of the \"New York World\" we have quoted\r\nthe propositions of these \"friends\" of Russian labor near the close of\r\nChapter XV of this book, as the reader doubtless remembers, and we\r\nmerely recall the facts here to put them in line with the other features\r\nof Bolshevist labor oppression which we have just been considering. Who\r\ncould have imagined that within a little more than two years after\r\nbeginning their barbarous Socialist experiment with Russian industries\r\nthe brazen dictatorship would be urging \"foreign capital\" to join in a\r\nscheme to squeeze both a domestic and a foreign profit out of the toil\r\nof Russian workingmen conscripted by Socialist task-masters and held in\r\nwage-slavery under fear of death by court martial?\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth place, we have the dreadful fact that Russian labor is\r\nenslaved by a Socialist autocracy not for the sake of promoting peace\r\nbut for the sake of promoting war. In our last chapter we quoted the\r\nstatements of Zinovieff to Lincoln Eyre that the Third Internationale\r\nwould never give up its purpose to make the whole world Bolshevist. Eyre\r\nalso found the belief general in Russia that so long as the Socialists\r\nretain power, any peace made by them with the outside world will only be\r\na short truce in which to prepare for another war. He says, in his cable\r\nprinted in the \"New York World\" of February 27, 1920:\r\n\r\n     \"All, Bolsheviki included, feel that as long as the Soviets remain\r\n     in power in Russia and Bolshevism does not spread to other lands,\r\n     peace cannot be more than a truce in the international class\r\n     warfare.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in his cable printed in the \"New York World\" of March 4, 1920,\r\nLincoln Eyre says:\r\n\r\n     \"The Red Army's victories against Kolchak, Yudenitch and Denikine\r\n     are in themselves paradoxical, in that they serve to increase the\r\n     Russian need for peace.... Every advance recorded in Siberia or the\r\n     Crimea brings the front line further from the base and complicates\r\n     the task of supplying munitions, food and equipment. Thus it\r\n     becomes increasingly evident to all Russians, whatever their\r\n     political leanings may be, that Russia must have peace in order to\r\n     survive economically. And yet--another paradox--all feel that any\r\n     peace established now between Soviet authority and Governments of\r\n     the bourgeois and democratics cannot be more than a brief truce\r\n     because Socialism and capitalism cannot abide side by side, and\r\n     because neither can be suppressed without warfare. The Bolshevik\r\n     faith in the ultimate appearance of a world revolution has not\r\n     waned, but their hope of its speedy coming has lessened\r\n     considerably.\"\r\n\r\nWho but the long-suffering Russians would endure the hopeless fate\r\nimposed by Socialism on Russian labor? The workingmen were conscripted\r\nby Trotzky's armies. They won victories, but these have not freed them.\r\nReturning from the front they are conscripted for labor armies, to work\r\nas they fought, under military discipline, subject to court martial and\r\ndeath if they rebel. Yet this military toil will not free them. They\r\nslave under the pistols of the commissaries only to get themselves\r\neconomically equipped for a new war against their \"capitalistic\"\r\nneighbors, and in this war the workingman, if he can still walk, will be\r\nconscripted to go to the front again. Should he survive this, must he\r\nbegin the same round over again?\r\n\r\nBut why not strike against this slavery? Russian labor does not dare to\r\nstrike. Tender-hearted Socialism has made the labor strike a crime in\r\nRussia. Says Lincoln Eyre, in a cable dated March 11, 1920, and printed\r\nin the \"New York World\" of March 13, 1920:\r\n\r\n     \"The unions, of course, lost their former principal weapon--the\r\n     strike. Today any body of workers that would venture out on strike\r\n     would be considered, to quote President Melnitchansky of the Moscow\r\n     unions, as traitors to their Socialist fatherland and as such would\r\n     doubtless be shot.\"\r\n\r\nWith this utter collapse of Socialist theories and professions in\r\nBolshevikiland, we need not wonder that, according to a cable in the\r\n\"New York Times\" of March 2, 1920, the French National Socialist\r\nCongress adjourned at Strasbourg, March 1, 1920, \"after voting down by\r\nmore than 2 to 1 a motion to ally the Socialists of France with Lenine\r\nand Trotzky.\" According to the same cable, \"The pleaders for the Third\r\nInternationale, formed at Moscow, were answered by the reply that the\r\nbeautiful doctrines enunciated there had been thrown aside by Lenine and\r\nTrotzky and that any one who believed in real Socialism would be a fool\r\nto get behind the leaders of Soviet Russia.\"\r\n\r\nIs it now in order for our American Bolshevists, Gene Debs, Morris\r\nHillquit (_alias_ Hilkovitz) and Vic Berger, solemnly to inform us that\r\nRussian Bolshevism never was Socialism, nor anything like it, but only a\r\nbase counterfeit? And will they also inform us that Lenine and Trotzky\r\nare unprincipled adventurers and cold-blooded blackguards who have\r\nhidden behind the mask of Socialism to blackjack a great people and\r\nfilch a wealth they never did a day's work to accumulate?\r\n\r\nWhen our American wavers of the Red Flag try to hide their shipwrecked\r\ntheories behind a repudiation of Bolshevikiland, we shall have to remind\r\nthem of their many, many utterances jubilantly assuring us that\r\n\"Bolshevism is Socialism in practice.\" A specimen will do, taken from\r\none of the books published by the Jewish Socialist Federation of\r\nAmerica, a \"part of the Socialist Party\" of the United States piloted by\r\nDebs, Hilkovitz and Berger, which we quote as cited on page 34 of the\r\n\"Outline of the Evidence Taken Before the Judiciary Committee\" of the\r\nNew York Assembly:\r\n\r\n     \"Bolshevism is not a new Socialist theory, but the practical\r\n     carrying out in life of the old Socialist theory.\r\n\r\n     \"Bolshevism especially is not a theory. Bolshevism is a method of\r\n     how to establish Socialism in life.\r\n\r\n     \"Bolshevism is practical Socialism, the Socialism of today, and not\r\n     of the remote future day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE CONSPIRACY AGAINST RELIGION ABROAD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is but proper to begin this chapter by conceding that there are many\r\nchurch-going members among those who vote the Marxian ticket--not as an\r\nindorsement of the teachings of international Socialism, but merely as a\r\nprotest against political corruption and the abuses of capitalism.\r\nJustice, moreover, demands that we acknowledge the existence of a small\r\nminority of dues-paying members of the Socialist Party who neither\r\nattack religion nor tacitly approve of the atheistic propaganda carried\r\non in the official Marxian press, as well as in the books, pamphlets and\r\nmagazines on sale not only in the leading Socialist book-stores of\r\nAmerica, but even at the National Office of the party in Chicago.\r\n\r\nIn most countries of Europe, where the war against religion is much more\r\nopen and widespread than in America, the Socialists are frank in\r\nconfessing that their movement is atheistic and anti-religious.\r\n\r\nIn our own country some of the more violent Socialistic enemies of the\r\nchurch admit both in their speeches and in their writings that they\r\nwould be extremely happy to see the very idea of God become a matter of\r\nancient history. Christian Socialists of the old Carr faction, who\r\nconstitute a minority of far less than one per cent of the Socialist\r\nParty of the United States, have not only conceded the existence of an\r\natheistic propaganda within the ranks, but have attacked it and utterly\r\nfailed to suppress it.\r\n\r\nApart from these two classes of American Socialists, who admit the\r\nexistence of a campaign in favor of atheism, most Socialists in our\r\ncountry, because they fear that votes will be lost if our people are\r\nconvinced of the anti-religious character of the party, steadfastly deny\r\nthat they are conspiring against religion. Indeed they are quite cunning\r\nand crafty in their effort to beguile the unwary. If the person\r\nhesitates joining the party, owing to his conviction that nearly all the\r\nSocialist leaders have been the enemies of religion, he is informed that\r\nit would be just as foolish for him not to be a Revolutionist for this\r\nreason, as it would be for one not to become a Republican because Robert\r\nIngersoll did not believe in God and even propagated atheism.\r\n\r\nAs the conspirators against religion have, by this plausible argument,\r\ninvolving the name of Ingersoll, removed the prejudices that many\r\npersons formerly had against Socialism on account of the atheistic\r\nteachings of its leaders, it seems but fitting to give a short\r\nrefutation of the deceptive argument and to point out the absurdity of\r\nthe comparison just mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, although Robert Ingersoll was an atheist, he never\r\nstated that Republicanism was anti-religious. On the other hand, very\r\nmany of the highest authorities in the Marxian Party, whose extensive\r\nknowledge of Socialism justifies our belief that they know but too well\r\nthe policy of the revolutionary movement, admit that Socialism\r\npostulates atheism and war against religious beliefs. Ingersoll,\r\nmoreover, never attacked religion nor taught atheism with a view to\r\nfurthering the cause of Republicanism. But a very large number of the\r\nSocialists, whether Europeans or Americans, in their endeavor to promote\r\nwhat they consider to be the best interests of their party, have in\r\ntheir books, magazines, pamphlets and papers been waging a relentless\r\nwar against religion. The atheistical works of Robert Ingersoll were not\r\npurchased by the rank and file of the Republican Party for purposes of\r\nparty propaganda, but the rank and file of the Revolutionary Party spend\r\nlarge sums of money on publications in which their avowed leaders teach\r\natheism as part of the Socialist program. Not content even with this,\r\nthe members do their utmost to increase the circulation of\r\nanti-religious Socialist books, magazines, pamphlets and papers.\r\n\r\nBefore producing the evidence that will convict the Socialist leaders\r\nand the rank and file of the party of openly advocating atheism and\r\nhostility to religion, or at least of tacitly approving of such a\r\npropaganda, a few words must be said relative to the materialistic\r\nconception of history, or of economic determinism, as it is often\r\ncalled. According to this doctrine, which is one of the fundamental\r\nteachings of the Socialists, the whole history of mankind, including its\r\npolitical, intellectual and religious development, is nothing more than\r\na process of evolution, the guiding principle of which is the prevailing\r\neconomic conditions and their resultant class struggles. Consequently,\r\nthe Socialists who believe this doctrine deny the intervention of God in\r\nthe development and spread of the Christian religion; for economic\r\ndeterminism teaches that the development of the church is not the work\r\nof Divine Providence, but of the economic conditions and class struggles\r\nof society.\r\n\r\nW. D. P. Bliss, the Socialist editor of the \"New Encyclopedia of Social\r\nReform,\" in an article on page 1135 of his work, admits that it is\r\nperfectly true that the large majority of avowed Socialists are divorced\r\nfrom recognized religion and the church, and that this leads many of\r\nthem to extreme radicalism on all questions of ethics, money and the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nFrederick Engels, one of the renowned founders of modern Socialism,\r\ntaught that \"nowadays in our evolutionary conception of the universe,\r\nthere is absolutely no room for either a Creator or a ruler.\"\r\n(\"Socialism, Utopian and Scientific,\" by Frederick Engels, page 17 of\r\nthe Introduction to the 1901 edition in English--New York Labor News\r\nCo.)\r\n\r\nWilhelm Liebknecht, who until shortly before his death in 1900 was one\r\nof the foremost leaders of the Socialist Party in Germany, addressing\r\nthe Halle Convention, said: \"As regards my own self, I had done with\r\nreligion at an early age.... I am an atheist, I do not believe in\r\nGod.... We may peacefully take our stand upon the ground of Socialism,\r\nand thus conquer the stupidity of the masses in so far as stupidity\r\nreveals itself in religious forms and dogmas.\" The same German Socialist\r\nand atheist taught in his book, \"Materialist Basis of History\":\r\n\r\n     \"It is our duty as Socialists to root out the faith in God with all\r\n     our zeal, nor is anyone worthy the name, who does not consecrate\r\n     himself to the spread of atheism.\"\r\n\r\nAugust Bebel, who before his death in August, 1913, was the leader of\r\nthe Socialists of Germany, gave many proofs of the intimate relation\r\nexisting between Socialism and atheism. On September 16, 1878, he\r\ndeclared in the Reichstag:\r\n\r\n     \"Gentlemen, you attack our views on religion because they are\r\n     atheistic and materialistic. I acknowledge the correctness of the\r\n     impeachment. I am firmly convinced that Socialism finally leads to\r\n     atheism.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Reichstag, on December 31, 1881, he made the following profession\r\nof faith:\r\n\r\n     \"In politics we profess Republicanism, in economics Socialism, in\r\n     religion atheism.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the 1903 platform of the German Socialists, adopted at\r\nDresden, \"No religious instructions of any kind shall be given to\r\nchildren under the age of sixteen; after that they can select their own\r\nreligious tenets and teachings, as they please. Superstitious religious\r\nnotions that are current among the less educated classes are to be\r\neradicated through proper instructions.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Comrade,\" September, 1904, confesses that the satirical weekly\r\n\"L'Asino,\" published by the Socialists of Italy, and known throughout\r\nthe world for its attacks on religion, carries on a bitter fight against\r\nthe Catholic Church. In the early part of 1913, \"L'Asino,\" speaking of\r\nthe coming Italian election, boasted that the Socialists would proclaim\r\ntheir anti-clericalism and atheism in the public meetings.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian Socialists in convention at Linz, May 30, 1898, passed a\r\nresolution proposed by Pernerstorfer to the effect that \"Socialism is\r\ndirectly contradictory to Roman clericalism, which is enslaved to\r\nunyielding authority, immutable dogmas, and absolute intellectual\r\nthralldom. We doubt all authority, we know of no immutable dogma, we are\r\nthe champions of right, liberty and conscience.\" [Reported in\r\n\"Vorwärts,\" 1898, no. 126, suppl.]\r\n\r\nThe bitter persecution that has for years been waged against the church\r\nin France is too well known to require much comment. The representatives\r\nof the French Socialist Party at Tours in March, 1903, voted upon a\r\nprogram from which several clauses will be cited:\r\n\r\n     \"The Socialist Party needs to organize a new world, free minds\r\n     emancipated from superstition and prejudices. It asks for and\r\n     guarantees every human being, every individual, absolute freedom of\r\n     thinking, and writing and affirming their beliefs. Over against all\r\n     religious dogmas and churches as well as over against the class\r\n     conceptions of the bourgeoisie, it sets the unlimited right of free\r\n     thought, the scientific conception of the universe, and a system of\r\n     public education based exclusively on science and reason. Thus\r\n     accustomed to free thought and reflection, citizens will be\r\n     protected against the sophistries of the capitalistic and clerical\r\n     reaction.\" The program also declares for the \"abolition of the\r\n     congregations, nationalization of property in mortmain of every\r\n     kind belonging to them, and appropriation of it for works of social\r\n     insurance and solidarity.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Tours program, therefore, we have the open confession of the\r\nSocialist Party of France that it is anti-religious and that it favors\r\nthe disgraceful robbery of the church that has for many years been going\r\non in that country.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian Socialists are quite as violent as the French in their\r\nhatred of the church, for in addition to the large number of vile\r\nanti-religious pamphlets distributed during the campaign that preceded\r\nthe elections of 1912, we have the testimony of no less an authority\r\nthan the Socialist leader, Emile Vandervelde, in the \"Social Democrat,\"\r\nEngland, January, 1903:\r\n\r\n     \"In the end the question to be solved is: what is the essential aim\r\n     of Socialism? There is not a Socialist who would hesitate to say\r\n     that it is the emancipation of the workers, the freedom of the\r\n     proletariat--and by this freedom we mean its complete freedom, the\r\n     abolition of all slavery in the spiritual sphere as well as in the\r\n     material sphere.... Can a sincere believer follow the church's\r\n     teachings and yet be a Socialist? We are bound to admit that both\r\n     in philosophy and in politics there must be war between Socialism\r\n     and the Church.\"\r\n\r\nIn England, too, the Socialists are the avowed enemies of religion.\r\nBlatchford, who is well known to his comrades for his extreme work in\r\npropagating Socialism by the pen, wrote in the \"Clarion,\" October 4,\r\n1907:\r\n\r\n     \"Believing that the Christian religion was untrue, and believing\r\n     that all supernatural religions were inimical to human progress,\r\n     and foreseeing that a conflict between Socialism and religion was\r\n     inevitable, I attacked the Christian religion. I am working for\r\n     Socialism when I attack religion which is hindering it.\"\r\n\r\nAgain in his book, \"God and My Neighbor,\" Blatchford utters the\r\nfollowing blasphemies:\r\n\r\n     \"I am an easiful old pagan, and I am not angry with you at all--you\r\n     funny little champion of the Most High....\r\n\r\n     \"This is the God of Heaven? This is the Father of Christ? This is\r\n     the Creator of the Milky Way? No! He will not do. He is not big\r\n     enough. He is not good enough. He is not clean enough. He is a\r\n     spiritual nightmare, a bad dream born in the savage minds of terror\r\n     and ignorance and a tigerish lust for blood....\r\n\r\n     \"Is this unspeakable monster the Father of Christ? Is he the God\r\n     who inspireth Buddha and Shakespeare and Beethoven and Darwin and\r\n     Plato? No, not he. But in warfare and massacre, in rapine and rape,\r\n     in black revenge and in deadly malice, in slavery and polygamy, and\r\n     the debasement of women, and in the pomps, vanities and greeds of\r\n     royalty, of clericalism, and of usury and barter--we may easily\r\n     discern the influence of his ferocious and abominable personality.\"\r\n\r\nThis book, which teaches atheism from cover to cover, could be bought\r\nfor a dollar a copy in 1912 at the National Office of the Socialist\r\nParty in Chicago, Ill. In the May, 1917, issue of the \"International\r\nSocialist Review,\" \"God and My Neighbor,\" by Blatchford, is thus\r\nadvertised:\r\n\r\n     \"Is the Bible true? This is the chief subject of debate today\r\n     between Christians and Scientists the world over. Robert Blatchford\r\n     says: 'Is the Bible a holy and inspired book and the Word of God to\r\n     man, or is it an incongruous and contradictory collection of tribal\r\n     tradition and ancient fables, written by men of genius and\r\n     imaginations? Mr. Blatchford believes religions are not revealed,\r\n     they are evolved.\r\n\r\n     \"'We cannot accept as the God of Creation,' he writes, 'this savage\r\n     idol, Jehovah, of an obscure tribe, and we have renounced him and\r\n     are ashamed of him, not because of any later divine revelation, but\r\n     because mankind have become too enlightened to tolerate Jehovah.'\"\r\n\r\nErnest Bax, an Englishman, one of the greatest authorities in the world\r\non Socialism, an author who, even in America, has been styled \"the most\r\naccomplished writer on behalf of Socialism in this and perhaps in any\r\ncountry,\" in his book, \"Religion of Socialism,\" thus testifies to the\r\nrelation existing between Socialism and religion:\r\n\r\n     \"In what sense Socialism is not religious will now be clear. It\r\n     utterly despises the other world with all its stage\r\n     properties--that is, the present objects of religion.\" [\"Religion\r\n     of Socialism,\" by Ernest Belfort Bax, page 52 of 1891 edition.]\r\n\r\nWho could imagine any more convincing testimony of the atheistic and\r\nanti-religious nature of the Socialist movement than the following words\r\nof the English Socialist, James Leathan, in \"Socialism and Character\":\r\n\r\n     \"At the present moment I cannot remember a single instance of a\r\n     person who is at one and the same time a really earnest and\r\n     intelligent Socialist and an orthodox Christian. Those who do not\r\n     openly attack the church and the fabric of Christianity, show but\r\n     scant respect to either the one or the other in private.... And\r\n     while all of us are thus indifferent to the church, many of us are\r\n     frankly hostile to her. Marx, Lassalle and Engels among earlier\r\n     Socialists; Morris, Bax, Hyndman, Guesde and Bebel among\r\n     present-day Socialists--are all more or less avowed atheists; and\r\n     what is true of the more notable men of the party is almost equally\r\n     true of the rank and file the world over.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1910 a pamphlet entitled \"Socialism and Religion\" was issued by the\r\nRevolutionists of Great Britain. One quotation from it will amply\r\nsuffice to show the utter contempt of the English[15] Socialist for\r\nreligion:\r\n\r\n     \"If a man supports the church, or in any respect allows religious\r\n     ideas to stand in the way of principles of Socialism, or activity\r\n     of the party, he proves thereby that he does not accept Socialism\r\n     as fundamentally true and of the first importance, and his place is\r\n     outside. No man can be consistently both a Socialist and a\r\n     Christian. It must either be the Socialist or the religious\r\n     principle that is supreme, for the attempt to couple them equally\r\n     together betrays charlatanism or lack of thought. There is,\r\n     therefore, no need for a specifically anti-religious test. So\r\n     surely does the acceptance of Socialism lead to the exclusion of\r\n     the supernatural, that the Socialist has little need for such terms\r\n     as atheist, freethinker or even materialist, for the word\r\n     Socialist, rightly understood, implies one who (on all such\r\n     questions) takes his stand on positive science, explaining all\r\n     things by purely natural causation--Socialism being not merely a\r\n     politico-economic creed, but an integral part of a consistent world\r\n     philosophy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Western Clarion,\" a publication of the Canadian Socialists,\r\ndeclared in its issue of May 23, 1914, that the Socialist Party of\r\nCanada would have \"no compromise with advocates of Christianity.\"\r\n\r\nAlvarado, the governor of Yucatan, and his criminal sustainers several\r\nyears ago drove the clergy from the country, turned the churches into I.\r\nW. W. meeting houses, and turned some, as in the case of the Cathedral\r\nof Merida, even into warehouses. Religion was outlawed and an atheist\r\ntyranny established. Alvarado is an ardent I. W. W. Socialist of the\r\nmost violent sort. His advent into Yucatan from the lawless northern\r\npart of Mexico was marked by wholesale confiscation of property, by\r\nrobbery and outrage. His vile subordinates, of like origin with himself,\r\ncommitted loathsome crimes, unspeakable and without number, and no\r\nopportunity was overlooked to persecute the unhappy people whose\r\naccumulations by thrift and industry and whose steadfast adherence to\r\ntheir religion marked them as certain victims of robbery, murder and\r\noutrage.\r\n\r\n\"The Call,\" New York, April 9, 1919, informs us that the workers in\r\nYucatan have elected a succession of Socialist governors, and in its\r\nissue of April 14, 1919, under the caption, \"Up to the Minute Official\r\nSocialist News,\" we read the following:\r\n\r\n     \"Felipe Carrillo, president of the Socialist Party of Yucatan,\r\n     Mexico, spoke on conditions in Yucatan. Among other things he said:\r\n     'The Socialist Party of America should do everything possible\r\n     against intervention in Mexico.... All the public officials, from\r\n     the highest to the lowest, are members of the Socialist party....\r\n     There is no middle class in Yucatan.... The Socialist Party of\r\n     Yucatan has been in power three years.'\r\n\r\n     \"A rising vote was taken, expressing our fraternal greetings to\r\n     Felipe Carrillo and the Comrades of Yucatan.\"\r\n\r\nThe April 9, 1919, issue of \"The Call\" informs us that Alvardo in 1915\r\norganized the Socialist Party of Yucatan, 62,700 members of which belong\r\nto the League of Resistance, an organization which, we are told, is\r\npurely economic in its activities.\r\n\r\nWhat a strange name for an economic league, especially in Mexico, where\r\neconomics have for some years been taught by the torch, bomb, dagger!\r\n\r\nThe March, 1919, edition of \"The Eye Opener,\" the official organ of the\r\nSocialist Party of the United States, throws a little light on this\r\neconomic league of \"the knights of the red flag.\" On page 4 of that\r\nissue we are told that among the principles of the League of Resistance\r\nare the following:\r\n\r\n     \"The Land is Mother, and Labor is the Father of Humanity.\r\n     Attack no one without motive, but never present the other cheek to\r\n       any who has struck one.\r\n     Fly from the religions, principally the Catholic religion, as from\r\n       the plagues.\"\r\n\r\nThe article on the economic League of Resistance ends with the call of\r\nYucatan to the rest of the continent: \"Workers of the world, unite.\"\r\nCarillo is then quoted as saying:\r\n\r\n\"Never will labor conquer until it understands solidarity. Political\r\naction, economic action, perhaps military action--todos metodos\r\nnecesitamos. En todas las epocas del mundo, rifley dynamita sean\r\nnecesarios; pero siempre y sobre todo, solidaridad.\" The words, \"rifley\r\ndynamita\" mean nothing and are evidently a misprint for \"rifle y\r\ndynamita.\" There was good reason for letting the words remain in the\r\nSpanish in the official organ of the Socialist Party of the United\r\nStates, for if \"rifle y dynamita\" were the Spanish words meant, their\r\ntranslation would be:\r\n\r\n     \"We need all means. In all periods of the world's history, the\r\n     rifle and dynamite may be necessary, but always and above all\r\n     solidarity.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for the _economic_ League of Resistance of the Socialists of\r\nYucatan, which has been destroying both religion and civilization alike!\r\nCarrillo, its president, has been greeted throughout our country by the\r\nSocialists, who have been extending their fraternal greetings also to\r\nthe rest of their \"Comrades in Yucatan.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE CONSPIRACY AGAINST RELIGION IN AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch more testimony than has already been given could easily be\r\nfurnished for proving that the Socialist movement in foreign lands is\r\natheistic and anti-religious, but as sufficient has been given, let us\r\ndwell more on the anti-religious activities of the Revolutionists in our\r\nown country.\r\n\r\nIn answer to a possible objection, namely, that the American Socialists\r\nshould in no way be held responsible for the anti-religious and\r\natheistic teachings of their comrades abroad, the attention of the\r\nreader is called to the fact that the Socialist movement is an\r\ninternational one, and that nearly all the Marxian leaders in Europe are\r\nconsidered by the American Socialists as first class authorities on\r\nSocialism. Moreover the books and writings of these foreign protagonists\r\nform a very considerable part of the Socialistic literature of the\r\nUnited States and are considered as standard works on the subject.\r\n\r\nBut in addition to the fact that the American Socialists thus share the\r\nresponsibility of their European comrades, the Revolutionists of our own\r\ncountry will now come forward with more than enough testimony to prove\r\nthat they are just as guilty as their foreign comrades of propagating\r\natheistic and anti-religious doctrines.\r\n\r\nRev. William T. Brown, formerly the pastor of Plymouth Church,\r\nRochester, New York, after becoming a Socialist, wrote the following in\r\nthe May, 1902, number of \"Wilshire's Magazine\":\r\n\r\n     \"For myself, I do not recognize any existing church or state as\r\n     complete in itself or founded by God. There is absolutely nothing\r\n     in church or state that cannot be traced to a perfectly natural\r\n     origin.... Instead of the religious idea that God breathed into\r\n     clay the breath of life, and so man came into existence in the\r\n     image of God, we know beyond question that man's ancestors were\r\n     animals, and he is the image of his animal parentage.... Singing\r\n     hymns, saying prayers, learning catechism, attending the services\r\n     of a place miscalled a sanctuary will do nothing whatever to effect\r\n     the ends for which men are striving.... The church will attract its\r\n     own, and the Socialist cause will draw those who belong to it.\r\n     People who are interested in fossils and relics and curios will\r\n     find a congenial place in the church as will also the ignorant and\r\n     deluded masses.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge D. Herron, who, like William T. Brown, had once been a minister,\r\non becoming a Socialist expressed his atheistic sentiments by writing in\r\nthe \"International Socialist Review,\" Chicago, August, 1901:\r\n\r\n     \"When the gods are dead to rise no more, man will begin to live.\r\n     After the end of the gods, when there is nothing else to which we\r\n     may turn, nothing left outside of ourselves, we shall turn to one\r\n     another for fellowship, and behold! the heart of all worship is\r\n     exposed and we have omnipotence in our hands....\r\n\r\n     \"There will be no more priests, no rulers, no judges, when\r\n     fellowship comes and the gods are gone. And when there are neither\r\n     priests, nor rulers, nor judges, there will be no evil on earth,\r\n     nor none called good, to stand over against others called evil.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Spargo, a former Socialist of considerable renown in the United\r\nStates, and until recently very popular with the party, speaking of\r\neducation in \"Socialism, A Summary and Interpretation of Socialist\r\nPrinciples,\" touches upon the question of parochial schools in the\r\nMarxian commonwealth:\r\n\r\n     \"Whether the Socialist regime could tolerate the existence of\r\n     elementary schools other than its own, such as privately conducted\r\n     kindergartens and schools, religious schools, and so on, is\r\n     questionable. Probably not. It would probably not content itself\r\n     with refusing to permit religious doctrines or ideas to be taught\r\n     in its schools, but would go farther, and as the natural protector\r\n     of the child, guard its independence of thought in later life as\r\n     far as possible by forbidding religious teaching of any kind in\r\n     schools for children up to a certain age....\r\n\r\n     \"This restriction of religious education to the years of judgment\r\n     and discretion implies no hostility to religion on the part of the\r\n     state, but neutrality[16].\" [\"Socialism, A Summary and\r\n     Interpretaion[17] of Socialist Principles,\" by John Spargo, page\r\n     238 of 1906 edition.]\r\n\r\n\"The Call\" does not fail to publish among its many poems those that are\r\nviolently anti-religious. In confirmation of this we shall transcribe\r\nseveral, all of which furnish excellent proofs of the existence of the\r\nconspiracy against religion. The first poem that will be quoted appeared\r\nin the November 19, 1911, edition, and reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"When all the choric peal shall end;\r\n      That through the fanes hath rung;\r\n    When the long lauds no more ascend\r\n      From man's adoring tongue;\r\n    When overwhelmed are altar, priest and creed;\r\n      When all the faiths have passed;\r\n    Perhaps from darkening incense freed,\r\n      God may emerge at last.\"\r\n\r\nThe following poem, entitled, \"To the Religionist,\" appeared on the same\r\nday:\r\n\r\n    \"You bid us spare your vision;\r\n      Put faith in a life after death,\r\n    Strive on toward some realm Elysian\r\n      And heed all that one Book saith.\r\n\r\n    \"You will pray to a power celestial,\r\n      To direct us in all our ways,\r\n    Lest we fall to a region bestial\r\n      And lose ourselves in its maze.\r\n\r\n    \"You speak of the Crucifixion\r\n      Of one on Calvary\r\n    As if his benediction\r\n      Was a rank monopoly.\r\n\r\n    \"Shall we pray to a power not human\r\n      For guidance miraculous\r\n    When the nearest man or woman\r\n      Will give help, and without that fuss?\r\n\r\n    \"When the glorious future people\r\n      Have realized our dream,\r\n    Then the cross upon the steeple\r\n      No longer shall blaspheme.\r\n\r\n    \"The godhood of the lowly\r\n      Their sacrifice unknown;\r\n    Of the temple once held holy\r\n      There shall not last one stone.\"\r\n\r\nOnly two stanzas of a poem which appeared in \"The Call,\" March 17, 1912,\r\nare hereby given:\r\n\r\n    \"The Gods are dead;\r\n      Dead lies their Heaven, their Hell.\r\n    The Gods are dead,\r\n      With all their terrors! Well!\r\n\r\n    \"Man now unmakes them,\r\n      Who made them in his youth;\r\n    He boldly breakes them\r\n      With shattering blows of truth.\"\r\n\r\nEditorials and articles attacking religion are of very common occurrence\r\nin \"The Call.\" Several illustrations will suffice. In the May 1, 1912,\r\nedition we read:\r\n\r\n     \"In our combat with the natural forces we have been taught by\r\n     science to seek the cause and effect not in anything supernatural;\r\n     we have gotten rid of superstition[18] and fear of revengeful\r\n     gods.\"\r\n\r\nThe following short article appeared on November 19, 1911, in the same\r\npaper:\r\n\r\n     \"Our exploiters might as well understand now that we have no use\r\n     for the distorted and mystical figure that they present as Christ,\r\n     a conservative member of the Property Defence League, a thing\r\n     neither man nor woman, but a third sex--not understood of us except\r\n     as a rightful object of suspicion; we have no use for this rant,\r\n     cant and fustian of his holiness and immaculate qualities. That\r\n     presentation has always been repellent to us and always will be, no\r\n     matter how much he may be proclaimed as the friend of the\r\n     workingman.... Christ, the democrat, the agitator, the\r\n     revolutionary, the rebel, the bearer of the red flag, yes we can\r\n     understand that figure.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the caption, \"The Old Year and The New,\" an editorial, part of\r\nwhich is here given, was published in \"The Call,\" January 1, 1912:\r\n\r\n     \"Interesting is it to see these clerical reactionists trying to\r\n     kindle into flame the dying embers and ashes of the religious\r\n     enthusiasm of past ages, now on the point of flickering out, and\r\n     marshalling the remnants of fear and ignorance against the\r\n     inexorable march of humanity and social progress.\r\n\r\n     \"We have no verbal answer to expend upon them. They are not worth\r\n     it. Well do we know that their show of attack is but a defensive\r\n     movement. The only answer they need expect from us will be given\r\n     in the steady continuance of our work. For we can put a thousand\r\n     workers into the field for their one, and despite all they may do,\r\n     we will take from them thousands and hundreds of thousands of those\r\n     who now follow them, and in whose ignorance alone lies their\r\n     defensive strength. Economic conditions fight on our side. Their\r\n     capitalist Christ cannot feed the multitude. We can teach the\r\n     multitude how to feed themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Proletarian,\" the Socialist paper of Detroit, in its April, 1919,\r\nedition tells us that \"Socialism is not a religion, it explains the\r\ncauses and fallacies underlying all religions.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"International Socialist Review,\" August, 1908, a notable\r\nconfession is made relative to religion:\r\n\r\n     \"Religion spells death to Socialism, just as Socialism to religion.\r\n     The moment Socialism turns into a religion it loses all its\r\n     progressiveness, it ossifies and turns into a superstition of\r\n     fanatics, who never forget and never learn anything. Socialism is\r\n     essentially, although not apparently, a free-thought movement. The\r\n     thinking Socialists are all free-thinkers.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"International Socialist Review\" not only are there many articles\r\nand editorials attacking religion, but also many advertisements of\r\natheistical and anti-religious books. For instance, in the February,\r\n1912, edition, among the many works advertised on page 512 the following\r\nare listed under the heading, \"Free-Thought Pamphlets\":\r\n\r\n    \"Holy Smoke in Holy Land.\r\n    Myth of the Great Deluge.\r\n    Revelation Under the Microscope of Evolution.\r\n    Chas. Darwin, What He Accomplished.\r\n    Jehovah Interviewed.\r\n    Church and State--by Jefferson.\r\n    Mistakes of Moses--by Ingersoll.\r\n    Ingersolia: Gems from R. G. Ingersoll.\r\n    Age of Reason--by Thos. Paine.\r\n    Ingersoll--44 Lectures.\r\n    Ingersoll's Famous Speeches.\"\r\n\r\nIn the April, 1912, edition of the \"International Socialist Review\" the\r\nsubsequent additions are made to the advertisements already mentioned:\r\n\r\n    \"Voltaire.\r\n    Confessions of a Nun.\r\n    Merry Tales of the Monks.\r\n    Secrets of Black Nunnery.\"\r\n\r\nSurely such books as these would not be extensively advertised in the\r\n\"Review\" and in the Socialist papers, nor would money be spent in this\r\nway by their publishers, unless the atheistic and anti-religious works\r\nfound many purchasers among those who inserted a plank in their party\r\nplatform stating that the Socialist movement was primarily an economic\r\none and was not concerned with matters of religious belief.\r\n\r\nThe following is part of an editorial taken from the \"Comrade,\" New\r\nYork, January, 1904, on the death of Herbert Spencer:\r\n\r\n     \"Dying at 84 years of age, Herbert Spencer leaves behind him an\r\n     enduring monument such as few men have been able to build for\r\n     themselves. He helped to rid the world of superstition and to\r\n     destroy priestcraft; he put the idea of a God-direction of the\r\n     world, and its counterpart, the eternal subjection and the\r\n     dependence of man, into the waste paper basket of history. He\r\n     cleared the way for the feet of the army of progress.\"\r\n\r\nIn the propagation of atheism, the German Socialist papers of the United\r\nStates are worthy imitators of those that are published in English. The\r\n\"New Yorker Volkszeitung,\" October 9, 1901, thus acknowledges the\r\natheistic and anti-religious attitude of the revolutionary movement:\r\n\r\n     \"Socialism and belief in the Divinity as taught by Christianity and\r\n     its representatives do not agree, cannot agree, are diametrically\r\n     opposed to one another. Socialism is logical only when it denies\r\n     the existence of God, when it maintains that we do not need the\r\n     so-called assistance of God, since we are able to help ourselves.\r\n     Only he who has no faith begins to feel that he can accomplish\r\n     something. The laborer who places confidence in God, and who, with\r\n     Christian resignation, thinks that all is done by God is well\r\n     done--how can that laborer develop revolutionary forces for the\r\n     overthrow of authority and social order, both of which, according\r\n     to his faith, are instituted by God? As long as he clings to this\r\n     belief he will not be able to acquire a genuinely revolutionary\r\n     spirit.\"\r\n\r\nIn the May 10, 1902, edition of \"Vorwärts,\" a weekly supplement of the\r\n\"New Yorker Volkeszeitung,\" we read:\r\n\r\n     \"New York, May 6.--Archbishop Corrigan died last night after a\r\n     protracted illness. Preparations are going on for a grand funeral\r\n     with the usual paraphernalia. The soul of the prelate whizzed out\r\n     of his mortal remains straight up into the seventh heaven, and now\r\n     the bishop is staying there with lovely little angels and other\r\n     beautiful beings hovering about him. Let him who is fool enough,\r\n     believe it.\"\r\n\r\nWe are informed by \"The Call,\" April 5, 1911, that at Utica, New York,\r\non April 4, 1911, churches of all denominations were placed under the\r\nban of the Italian Socialist Federation of the United States at the\r\nclosing session of its National Congress, which had been in session for\r\nthe last three days in that city and that strongly worded resolutions\r\ncharging all churches with being against the emancipation of the working\r\nclass and for the protection and perpetuation of capitalism and moral\r\nand economic slavery were unanimously adopted amid vociferous applause;\r\nfinally that by the adoption of these resolutions, all members of the\r\nfederation must sever their affiliations with any and all existing\r\nchurches and religious organizations and refrain from all religious\r\npractices and rites.\r\n\r\nSome information regarding the atheistic teachings of the New York \"Il\r\nProletario,\" the official organ of the Italian Socialist Federation of\r\nthe United States, will be of interest to the reader. In the edition of\r\nDecember 23, 1910, there are several attacks on Christianity. One of\r\nthese entitled \"Christmas Is Here\" is translated as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Christmas is a fib, Christmas is a fraud, Christmas is a crime\r\n     wanted and continued by the powerful to delude their servants and\r\n     to make them believe that there is really happiness, justice and\r\n     love on this earth.... There is no everlasting joy. How long, O\r\n     poor and exhausted workingmen of the world, will the shameful\r\n     comedy continue? When will you finally perceive that not from a\r\n     false and unexisting God, not from a mystical and epileptic\r\n     crucified man, who died without rebellion and without protest, will\r\n     come your redemption? When will you open your eyes to the truth of\r\n     Socialism, and realize that finally upon you alone depends your\r\n     salvation?\"\r\n\r\nIn the same edition of \"Il Proletario\" there is a detailed list of 170\r\nbooks and pamphlets that are advertised as being on sale at the\r\nbook-store of the Italian Socialist Federation. The first part of the\r\nlist, under the heading \"Anti-religious Pamphlets,\" includes 22 works,\r\nwhose prices range from 5 cents to 30 cents. Among them are to be found:\r\n\r\n    \"The Religious Pest--5 cents.\r\n    The Crimes of God--5 cents.\r\n    The Sins of My Lady Penitents--8 cents.\r\n    The Last Religious Lie--5 cents.\r\n    Neither God Nor Soul--15 cents.\"\r\n\r\nNear the end of the detailed list 22 more works are advertised as\r\nanti-clerical novels.\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1912, while its editor, Arturo M. Giovannitti, was in prison\r\nat Lawrence, Massachusetts, \"Il Proletario\" published an article under\r\nthe caption, \"The Priest\":\r\n\r\n     \"Now at last the nations have understood that God is a monstrous\r\n     fable, and that hell, heaven, immortality, and all the other\r\n     devilish things are states created by rascals to despoil and\r\n     oppress the people.\"\r\n\r\nWe are very much indebted to the Social Reform Press for favoring us\r\nwith the translation of \"The Little Catechism,\" edited by Bartos\r\nBittner, whose dead and corrupt body was found by neighbors in his\r\nlodging in Chicago. This blasphemous Catechism, from which quotations\r\nare to be given, was published for the use of the children of the\r\nBohemian-American Socialists:\r\n\r\n     \"Question. What is God?\r\n\r\n     Answer. God is a word used to designate an imaginary being which\r\n     people of themselves have devised.\r\n\r\n     Q. Is it true that God has never been revealed?\r\n\r\n     A. As there is no God, He could not reveal himself.\r\n\r\n     Q. What is heaven?\r\n\r\n     A. Heaven is an imaginary place which churches have devised as a\r\n     charm to entice their believers.\r\n\r\n     Q. How did man originate?\r\n\r\n     A. Just as did animals; by evolution from their lower kinds.\r\n\r\n     Q. Has man an immortal soul as Christianity teaches?\r\n\r\n     A. Man has no soul; it is only an imagination.\r\n\r\n     Q. Who is Jesus Christ?\r\n\r\n     A. Jesus Christ is the son of a Jewish girl called Mary.\r\n\r\n     Q. Is he the son of God?\r\n\r\n     A. There is no God, therefore there can be no God's son.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did Christ rise from the dead as Christianity teaches?\r\n\r\n     A. The report about Christ rising from the dead is a fable.\r\n\r\n     Q. Is it true that after Christ's death the Apostles received the\r\n     Holy Ghost?\r\n\r\n     A. It is not; the Apostles had imbibed too freely of wine and their\r\n     dizzy heads imagined all sorts of queer things.\r\n\r\n     Q. Did Christ ascend into heaven?\r\n\r\n     A. He did not; what the church teaches is a nonsensical fable,\r\n     because there is no heaven, and there was no place to ascend to.\r\n\r\n     Q. Will Christ come to this earth?\r\n\r\n     A. He will not because no dead person can come back.\r\n\r\n     Q. Will Christ return on judgment day?\r\n\r\n     A. There will be no judgment day; that is all a fable so that\r\n     preachers could scare people and hold them in their grasp. Man has\r\n     no soul, neither had Christ a soul. All these things have been\r\n     invented by the church.\r\n\r\n     Q. What is the Holy Spirit?\r\n\r\n     A. The Holy Spirit is an imagination existing only in the minds of\r\n     crazy religious people.\r\n\r\n     Q. Is Christianity desirable?\r\n\r\n     A. Christianity is not advantageous to us, but is harmful, because\r\n     it makes us spiritual cripples. By its teachings of bliss after\r\n     death it deceives the people. Christianity is the greatest obstacle\r\n     to the progress of mankind, therefore it is the duty of every\r\n     citizen to help wipe out Christianity. All churches are impudent\r\n     humbugs.\r\n\r\n     Q. Is there communion of saints?\r\n\r\n     A. No, because there is no God, no saints, no soul, and therefore\r\n     our prayers are wholly useless, and only a waste of time, which\r\n     should be spent in more useful things.\r\n\r\n     Q. What is our duty when we have learned that there is no God?\r\n\r\n     A. We should teach this knowledge to others.\r\n\r\n     Q. Should we take the name of God in vain?\r\n\r\n     A. Yes, because the name of God has no meaning.\"\r\n\r\nIsador Ladoff, a Socialist of Cleveland, Ohio, and a candidate for\r\noffice in 1911, speaks very frankly about religion on page 11 of his\r\npamphlet, \"Socialism, The Anti-Christ\":\r\n\r\n     \"The church knows that Socialism in spite of the declaration of\r\n     neutrality of the latter in religious matters, undermines the very\r\n     foundation of the former. The church realizes that Socialism is\r\n     anti-Christ. For the church it is a question of life and death, a\r\n     struggle for existence. Why, then, should the Socialists not engage\r\n     in an open aggressive campaign against the church? Would not an\r\n     honest war between Christ and anti-Christ be more dignified, more\r\n     wise and more effective, than a false pretence of neutrality and a\r\n     defensive attitude toward the attacks of the church? Let us have\r\n     the courage of our convictions, not only in matters of social and\r\n     economic significance, but in all things affecting the interests of\r\n     the toiling masses of humanity, including religious institutions.\"\r\n\r\nRev. E. E. Carr, writing in the \"Christian Socialist,\" Chicago, May 15,\r\n1907, informs us that, \"The Christian Socialists do not ask or desire\r\nthat the party declare for religion. Strictly speaking, Socialism is a\r\npurely economic proposition.... We demand absolute freedom of religious\r\nopinion in the party, and that officials of the party cease teaching\r\nanti-religious dogma as an essential part of Socialist philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nDishonest Socialists, when arguing that their party does not advocate\r\natheism as the \"religion\" of their contemplated state, frequently appeal\r\nto the religious plank of their 1908 National Platform, which declares\r\nthat the Socialist Party is not concerned with matters of religious\r\nbelief.\r\n\r\nThough this deceitful appeal of the \"Knights of the Red Flag\" has been\r\nexposed time and again, still it seems expedient that the underhand\r\nmethods of the party which boasts of being the only one sufficiently\r\nhonest and upright to fight for the rights of poor and oppressed\r\nworkingmen, be better known to the American people, and that the more\r\nimportant parts of the indoor convention speeches be presented in\r\ngreater detail.\r\n\r\nPages 191 to 205 of the \"Proceedings of the 1908 National Convention of\r\nthe Socialist Party,\" edited by John M. Work, published by the Socialist\r\nParty[19], and sold at 50 cents a copy at the National Office of the\r\nparty, Chicago, Illinois, bear the following ample testimony to the\r\nhypocrisy of the Revolutionists.\r\n\r\nWhen Delegate Simons had finished reading the proposal of the platform\r\ncommittee \"that religion be treated as a private matter--a question of\r\nindividual conscience,\" Arthur M. Lewis, a delegate from Illinois rose\r\nand moved its rejection, saying:\r\n\r\n     \"I am among those who sincerely hoped the question of religion\r\n     would not be raised at this convention. I am willing to concede so\r\n     far that we shall let sleeping dogs lie. I know that the Socialist\r\n     position in philosophy on the question of religion does not make a\r\n     good campaign subject. It is not useful in the propaganda of a\r\n     presidential campaign, and therefore I am willing that we should be\r\n     silent about it. But if we must speak, I propose that we shall go\r\n     before this country with the truth and not with a lie.... Now I do\r\n     not propose to state in this platform the truth about religion from\r\n     the point of view of the Socialist philosophy as it is stated in\r\n     almost every book of Standard Socialist literature; but if we do\r\n     not do that, let us at least have the good grace to be silent about\r\n     it, and not make hypocrites of ourselves.... I say, let us either\r\n     tell the truth or have the good grace and the common sense and the\r\n     stamina and the manhood and the self-respect to keep our mouths\r\n     shut about it. Therefore I move this be stricken from the\r\n     platform.\"\r\n\r\nDelegate Hillquit of New York urged the following amendment as a\r\nsubstitute for the one the ratification of which Lewis had tried to\r\nprevent: \"The Socialist movement is primarily an economic and political\r\nmovement. It is not concerned with the institutions of marriage or\r\nreligion.\" Hillquit then went on to say:\r\n\r\n     \"The fact that Comrade Lewis as a scholar, as a student of\r\n     psychology, of history, of ethics and of everything else, has in\r\n     the domain of religion come to the position of an agnostic, and\r\n     that ninety-nine per cent of us have landed in the same spot, does\r\n     not make Socialism agnostic, nor is Socialism Christian, nor is\r\n     Socialism Jewish, Socialism hasn't anything to do with that side of\r\n     our existence at all. I say to you, Comrades, if we are to follow\r\n     Comrade Lewis's advise, and to say in our platform and declaration\r\n     of principles what is true, let us not be afraid to insert in it\r\n     the things we are advocating day after day and on all occasions.\"\r\n\r\nDelegate Unterman of Idaho, speaking in favor of the adoption of the\r\nreligious plank as originally proposed by the platform committee and\r\nread by Simons, added:\r\n\r\n     \"Comrades, no one will accuse me with any sympathy with\r\n     Christianity, either as a church or as a religion. I am known in\r\n     the United States as a materialist of the most uncompromising\r\n     order. But I want it clearly understood that my materialist\r\n     philosophy does not permit me to strike this plank out of the\r\n     platform. I want it understood that my materialist dialectics do\r\n     not permit me to forget the exigencies of the moment for our ideals\r\n     in the far future.... Would you expect to go out among the people\r\n     of this country, people of different churches, of many different\r\n     religious factions, and tell them that they must become atheists\r\n     before they can become Socialists? That would be nonsense. We must\r\n     first get these men convinced of the rationality of our economic\r\n     and political program, and then after we have made Socialists of\r\n     them and members of the Socialist Party, we can talk to them inside\r\n     of our ranks, talk of the higher philosophy and of the logical\r\n     consequences of our explanation of society and nature.... We should\r\n     not go out in our propaganda among people that are as yet\r\n     unconvinced and are still groping in ignorance and obscurity, and\r\n     tell them that they first must become materialists before they can\r\n     become members of the Socialist Party. No. This declaration that\r\n     religion is a private matter does not mean that it is not a social\r\n     matter or class matter at the same time. It merely means that we\r\n     shall bide our good time and wait till the individual is ready,\r\n     through his own individual evolution, to accept our philosophy. It\r\n     means that we shall give him plenty of time to grow gradually to\r\n     the things that are necessary to him, and those material things\r\n     that affect his material welfare, the economic and political\r\n     question of Socialism. After he has grown into them, it will be so\r\n     much easier to approach him with the full consequences of the\r\n     Socialist philosophy. Therefore I ask you to retain this plank in\r\n     our platform.\"\r\n\r\nDelegate Stirton gave the following reason for his opposition to the\r\nadoption of any religious plank in the party platform:\r\n\r\n     \"If this statement is true that religion is no concern of our\r\n     movement, as stated in the amendment, or in the original\r\n     recommendation that it is a private matter--if that is a true\r\n     statement, then we don't need it. If it is a lie, then we don't\r\n     want it.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Delegate Lewis at an earlier session of the\r\nconvention had said: \"Let us either tell the truth or have the good\r\ngrace and the common sense and stamina and the manhood to keep our\r\nmouths shut about it\" (i.e., religion from the viewpoint of Socialist\r\nphilosophy).\r\n\r\nTo show the insincerity of Lewis, we shall now quote parts of a second\r\nspeech made by him in the evening of the same day on which he had spoken\r\nso eloquently in behalf of asserting the truth and not telling a lie:\r\n\r\n     \"I have gone into conference,\" he says, \"between the afternoon\r\n     session and the evening session with most of the members of the\r\n     platform committee, and I have reached an agreement with them which\r\n     I am sure the convention would be glad to hear, and it will dispose\r\n     of this question, I think, amicably to all concerned.... I consider\r\n     myself and every other delegate on this floor as being present at\r\n     this convention for the sole purpose of promoting the best\r\n     interests of the Socialist Party. I am willing to waive any\r\n     personal views of mine, and I believe the members of the platform\r\n     committee are in the same position, to promote those interests....\r\n     While it may not harmonize with my personal opinion to have this\r\n     plank remain in the platform, I am willing to sink those personal\r\n     opinions rather than put the Socialist movement in America in a\r\n     false position and lay it open to the attacks of our enemies.\"\r\n\r\nVictor Berger of Wisconsin mentioned expediency as his reason for\r\nfavoring the adoption of a religious plank and argued:\r\n\r\n     \"In the first place, a plank of this kind you will find in every\r\n     platform or program of every other civilized nation in the world.\r\n     Yet in no country do they have as much reason for it as in this\r\n     country. There is not a race in the world that is as thoroughly\r\n     religious as the Anglo-Saxon race. If you want a party made up of\r\n     free-thinkers only, then I can tell you right now how many you are\r\n     going to have. If you want to wait with our co-operative\r\n     commonwealth, until you have made a majority of the people into\r\n     free-thinkers, I am afraid we will have to wait a long while. I say\r\n     this, although I am known, not only in Milwaukee, but wherever our\r\n     papers are read, as a pronounced agnostic.... You can hardly find a\r\n     paper in which we are not denounced as men who want to abolish all\r\n     religion and abolish God. Something must be done in order to enable\r\n     us to show that Socialism, being an economic theory--or rather the\r\n     name for an epoch of civilization--has nothing to do with religion\r\n     either way, neither pro nor con.\"\r\n\r\nWhat reader, who elsewhere in this book has followed the evidence\r\nlinking together the cunning craft of Morris Hillquit and Victor L.\r\nBerger in committing their party and followers to deceit and hypocrisy\r\nto obtain votes under false pretenses, will be surprised to find them\r\nthus also in the 1908 convention uniting the tongues of two old foxes to\r\nput through Hillquit's hypocrisy-plank on marriage and religion? These\r\nare the two whose deceit and violence have now reduced the Socialist\r\nParty of America to little more than a hollow echo of two lying hearts.\r\n\r\nDelegate Vander Porten opposed the adoption of the plank as originally\r\nread by Simons and urged the adoption of Morris Hillquit's amendment:\r\n\r\n     \"Nobody regrets more than I do that this question has arisen in\r\n     this convention, but as long as it occupies the position that it\r\n     does, I believe that there is to be an expression upon it, that\r\n     expression should be the truth and not a lie.... When we talk of\r\n     educating mankind and when we talk of raising mankind above the\r\n     level in which he is, then we have got to throw from his arms those\r\n     crutches that bind him to his slavery, and religion is one of them.\r\n     Let it be understood that the moment the Socialist Party's whole\r\n     aim and object is to get votes, we can get them more quickly by\r\n     trying to please the religionists and those whose only ambition is\r\n     to pray God and crush mankind.... Let us say nothing or say the\r\n     truth. To spread forth to the world that religion is the\r\n     individual's affair, and that religion has no part in the\r\n     subjection of the human race, we lie when we say it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter several other delegates had spoken, the \"Proceedings of the 1908\r\nNational Convention\" inform us that the chairman put the question on the\r\nacceptance of the substitute offered by Delegate Hillquit, and the\r\nresult being in doubt, a show of hands was called for, and the vote\r\nresulted in 79 for the substitute, and 78 against it.\r\n\r\nThose who honestly voted against the plank admitted thereby that the\r\nSocialist Party was very much concerned with matters of religious belief\r\nand that the Revolutionists were then, just as they are today, the\r\nbitter enemies of religion.\r\n\r\nThe 79 who voted for the plank did so, not because they had any love for\r\nreligion, for this is evident from their speeches and from their method\r\nof procedure, but because they considered that a great deal of prejudice\r\nagainst Socialism would be removed by the adoption of a plank stating\r\nthat the Socialist Party is primarily an economic and political\r\nmovement, and that it is not concerned with matters of religious belief.\r\n\r\nOn one single plank therefore there were 79 liars in the Socialist\r\nNational Convention out of a possible 157. Quite an unenviable record\r\nfor the party which is so fond of accusing its opponents of lies and\r\nfalsehoods!\r\n\r\nWhen speeches against religion, such as the ones quoted, can be\r\ndelivered at the national convention of a political party, without\r\narousing anything like serious opposition among the delegates present,\r\nor among the rank and file of the party who afterwards read them, the\r\nonly reasonable conclusion to be drawn is that the vast majority of the\r\nmembers of the party either advocate atheism or else are in sympathy\r\nwith those who do.\r\n\r\nFor four long years the Socialists all over the country appealed to the\r\nreligious plank of their 1908 platform to prove that their party was not\r\nopposed to religion; and although they were aware that the plank was a\r\nlie, they were not sufficiently honest to have it removed by referendum,\r\nas could have been done at any time. The plank was finally dropped by\r\nthe National Convention of 1912 and has not since then been readopted.\r\nThis, however, was not because the Socialists as a body had become more\r\nupright through their adherence to atheism, but because their lies\r\nconcerning religion had become pretty well known all over the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the reader will be interested in the following quotation taken\r\nfrom \"The Communist,\" the Left Wing Socialist paper of Chicago. In the\r\nApril, 1919, edition there is an article by John R. Ball, entitled,\r\n\"Challenge of the S. P. [i.e., the Socialist Party] of Michigan\":\r\n\r\n     \"When the delegates to a State Socialist Convention gathered in\r\n     Grand Rapids, Michigan, February 24, 1919, to nominate candidates\r\n     for the coming State Elections, they were determined to do much\r\n     more than to go through the mere formalities of complying with\r\n     State Election Laws....\r\n\r\n     \"There were many striking features about the personnel of the\r\n     delegates: not only were the preachers entirely absent, but their\r\n     following also. A Christian Socialist would have felt lonesome\r\n     indeed, with no one to act as a listener for him....\r\n\r\n     \"Fearless and unashamed, in true Bolshevik fashion, the delegation\r\n     paid no heed to the prejudice of some, but adopted, with one\r\n     opposing vote, an additional constitutional amendment, guided\r\n     solely by historic facts and scientific data. A Socialist who\r\n     understands the Materialistic Conception of History cannot have\r\n     faith in superstitions of any kind. In other words, a 'religious'\r\n     or 'Christian' Socialist is a contradiction of terms, and the\r\n     statement that 'religion is a private matter' is a lie. The belief\r\n     in a supreme being or beings is a social phenomenon which can be\r\n     explained on the materialistic basis, just as all economic\r\n     phenomena can be explained. With persistent adherence to honesty,\r\n     the convention adopted a resolution and a constitutional amendment\r\n     declaring religion to be a social phenomenon and instructing all\r\n     organizers and speakers to explain religion upon its materialistic\r\n     basis.\r\n\r\n     \"Here again, the Socialist Party of Michigan issued a direct\r\n     challenge to the National Organization. This time it is not a\r\n     challenge in regard to tactics, but we challenge the honesty of the\r\n     National Organization in declaring that 'religion is a private\r\n     matter.'\"\r\n\r\nNow listen to the words of Eugene V. Debs, published on the editorial\r\npage of \"The Call,\" New York, July 21, 1919, and see what a fraud and\r\nhypocrite the leader of the Socialists of the United States is:\r\n\r\n     \"If you have not already done so, read the platform of the\r\n     Socialist Party, and then let us know what you find in it to\r\n     warrant the lying charge of the sleek and fat leeches and parasites\r\n     and their degenerates, tools and hirelings that Socialism is\r\n     atheism and free-love(?) and that it will tear up the family by the\r\n     roots, smash up the home and turn society into a raging bedlam.\"\r\n\r\nSufficient evidence has now been given to prove that the Socialists are\r\nthe declared enemies of the church. They are conspiring to destroy an\r\ninstitution which, apart from the supernatural blessings that it has\r\nconferred upon mankind, has done wonders to promote the happiness of\r\nnations. To the church many countries owe their civilization and their\r\nconversion from heathenism. She has preserved for us the priceless\r\ntreasures of art and learning that would otherwise have fallen a prey to\r\nthe ravages of the barbarians. For centuries she has trained untold\r\nmillions to observe the Commandments of God, and has thus been\r\ninstrumental in the prevention of innumerable crimes and sins from which\r\nthe human race would have suffered. Not only has she taught the people\r\nthe virtues of charity, justice, temperance, humility, liberality,\r\npurity, meekness and forgiveness of enemies, and been a source of\r\nimmense consolation to the poor and oppressed, the sick and the injured,\r\nbut she has comforted millions of the dying, who, when they realized\r\nthat no earthly joys remained, took hope and delight at the thought of\r\nan eternal reward in heaven.\r\n\r\nIt is this glorious institution, then, founded by Almighty God Himself,\r\nthat the Socialists hate with all their hearts, and would destroy\r\nforever, because it prevents the spread of their revolutionary doctrines\r\nby teaching respect for law, order and authority, and by exposing to all\r\nthe world the deceptions, frauds and empty promises of the conspirators\r\nagainst religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE FAMILY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the Marxians in America, when confronted with the charge that\r\nthey advocate free-love, deny the truth of the accusation, claiming that\r\nit is a base calumny. False and calumnious, indeed, would the charge be,\r\nif it were directed against each individual among the Revolutionists, or\r\nif from its universality exceptions were not made for many, who, not\r\nhaving as yet accepted the full consequences of International Socialism,\r\ngo no further than to cast their votes for the party candidates. For\r\nwould it be fair to except no others from condemnation, for among the\r\ndues-paying members of the party are many who are extremely averse to\r\nthe system of loose morals that their comrades propose to substitute for\r\nthe monogamous form of marriage now in vogue.\r\n\r\nBooks advocating free-love are advertised in the Socialist press and\r\nreceive favorable notice in editorial columns. They have long been on\r\nsale at the leading Socialist book-stores of the country and even at the\r\nNational Office of the Socialist Party in Chicago. Finally, the\r\nRevolutionary clubs and locals all over the United States have in their\r\nlibraries books on free-love that are standard works on Socialism.\r\n\r\nThe Marxians, in their endeavors to offset the charge that a free-love\r\npropaganda exists within their party, frequently argue that\r\nprostitution, now so prevalent throughout the world, will under\r\nSocialism no longer remain the dreadful menace to society that it is\r\ntoday. They attribute the prevalence of this vice principally to\r\npoverty, and argue that in the new state, all persons will be abundantly\r\nsupplied with the goods of this world, and consequently no one will be\r\nobliged to indulge in this sin for obtaining a livelihood.\r\n\r\nThe Reds, therefore, try to dodge the question at issue by leading their\r\nopponents off on a tangent. The real question, free-love, will, however,\r\nby no means be forgotten by us until the Socialists have been shown up\r\nthoroughly. Since the conspirators against family life are so fond of\r\nharping on the matter of prostitution, with a view to drawing critics\r\naway from attacking their doctrine of free-love, the reader will be\r\nshown that even prostitution, instead of decreasing in the Socialist\r\nstate, would, together with immorality of every sort, become far more\r\nprevalent under Marxian rule than it is today.\r\n\r\nProstitution and impurities of every sort may, of course, be due to many\r\ndifferent causes. First, let us consider prostitution in connection with\r\npoverty and destitution. The Socialists claim that there will be far\r\nless prostitution in their state since the people, as a whole, will be\r\nsupplied more abundantly with the needs of life. This talk about greater\r\nsupplies for all in the Socialist state is mere assertion. The Marxians\r\nhave never proven that such would actually be the case. If so, where is\r\ntheir proof? Can they give any convincing argument? Can they name any\r\ncountry, state or city, where they have ever ruled, in which the people,\r\nas a whole, were better supplied with the needs of life under the red\r\nflag than they were before the Socialist rule began?\r\n\r\nThe fact is just the contrary. Look at any part of Europe over which the\r\nSocialists have ruled and you will see far greater destitution under\r\nSocialism than there was before. As for places that have never yet tried\r\nSocialism, enough arguments were given in the chapter, \"Socialism a\r\nPeril to Workingmen,\" to show that there would be so many upheavals, so\r\nmuch turmoil, discontent and strife in a Socialist state, that\r\nproduction would be at a minimum and entirely insufficient to supply the\r\nneeds of the people.\r\n\r\nWe concede that poverty often leads to prostitution, and this is one\r\nreason out of many for sincerely wishing that our poor people were\r\nbetter supplied than they now are with the necessities of life. Still it\r\nmust not be forgotten that poverty and want are often greater factors in\r\npreventing prostitution than in helping it. Think of the millions of\r\npoor people whose very poverty indirectly makes prostitution and vice in\r\ngeneral less likely by keeping them from immoral theatres, movies,\r\ndances and cabarets and association with bad companions of greater means\r\nwho would be attracted by better clothes and greater wealth if these\r\npoor people had them.\r\n\r\nDo the Socialists claim that the average poor woman is less moral than\r\nthe average rich one? Do not the Marxians know that poverty, rather than\r\nwealth, fosters religion and piety, the greatest of all factors in\r\nkeeping persons pure? Do the Reds deny that millions and millions of the\r\nvery poorest are chaste? If these souls can remain pure, notwithstanding\r\ntheir poverty, so, too, can others; and when these others do not remain\r\npure, usually something other than poverty is the cause, _e.g._,\r\nirreligion, lawlessness or disregard of authority, all of which the\r\nSocialists are advocating, day after day, in their books, pamphlets,\r\npapers and speeches.\r\n\r\nAgain, Debs and his followers, by having a separate party for\r\nworkingmen, are dividing the laboring class against itself, knowing full\r\nwell that millions upon millions of decent, honest workingmen will never\r\njoin them. And since Socialists are making unjust and impossible\r\ndemands, and injecting into labor organizations radical leaders who\r\ncause general distrust and fear, labor cannot succeed in its battles\r\nagainst the abuses of capitalism nearly as well as it would if all were\r\nunited. Hence, because of the existence of the Socialist Party, low\r\nwages still prevail in many cases, with extreme poverty which often\r\nleads to prostitution.\r\n\r\nIf the Socialists ever gain control of our country they will probably do\r\nso through a revolution. Or they will come into power gradually, by an\r\nincreased vote at each election. In the meantime, as victory came near,\r\nthere would be business failures by the thousands, owing to the\r\nimpending destruction of the existing system of industry and government.\r\nIn either case there would be terrible destitution and a great dearth of\r\nthe necessities of life. This, according to the Socialists' own\r\nargument, would mean a great increase in prostitution.\r\n\r\nIt has been proven theoretically in the chapter entitled, \"Socialism, a\r\nPeril to Workingmen,\" and actually by events in Europe, that a Socialist\r\nstate, even should it endure, cannot be a success. Hence, were the\r\nMarxian argument about prostitution as strong as the Socialists claim,\r\npicture the immorality among the people where a Socialist government\r\nplunges the industries and sources of production and distribution into\r\ntotal chaos.\r\n\r\nWith this refutation of the claim that prostitution would become a very\r\nrare thing under Socialism, the national conspirators must confess that\r\nthe same argument they have for years been using to further the\r\ninterests of their cause, can with telling effect be turned against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNot alone are the Socialists defeated in their argument that\r\nprostitution would be less prevalent in the Marxian state, but they are\r\nhypocrites in using the argument they do. \"The Call,\" for instance,\r\nwhich frequently uses the argument which has been refuted, in the\r\nmagazine section of its issue of June 8, 1919, published a poem\r\nentitled, \"The Harlot,\" to satisfy its lustful patrons:\r\n\r\n    \"I do not understand you--\r\n    I cannot see\r\n    How you can lie passive in my arms\r\n    When such a passion swells in me....\r\n    You lie in my arms--\r\n    Your face is close to mine.\r\n    I look into your eyes,\r\n    Revelation!\r\n    And you\r\n    Look into mine\r\n    Unmoved.\"\r\n\r\nWe now return to the question of free-love--we have not forgotten it,\r\nthough no doubt the Reds wish we had. Socialists who deny that an active\r\nfree-love propaganda exists within their ranks must either confess their\r\nignorance of what is going on, or plead guilty to the base charge of\r\ndeceiving the American people.\r\n\r\nThe \"New Encyclopedia of Social Reform,\" edited by the Socialist, W. D.\r\nP. Bliss, on page 484 contains an article on the family which reads in\r\npart as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"We then come to the third form of free-love, the free-love theory\r\n     par excellence, which is held today by many Socialists, and an\r\n     increasing number of radical men and women of various schools of\r\n     thought. According to these neither the state nor organized\r\n     religion should have aught to do with the control of the family or\r\n     of the sexual relation. They would make free-love supreme. They\r\n     would have it unfettered by any tie whatsoever. They argue that\r\n     compulsory love is not love; that all marriage save from love is\r\n     sin; that when love ends, marriage ends.\"\r\n\r\nIn another article, on page 1135, under the caption, \"Socialism,\" Bliss\r\ninforms us that it is perfectly true that Deville, a French Socialist,\r\nsaid that \"marriage is a regulation of property.... When marriage is\r\ntransformed, and only after that transformation marriage will lose its\r\nreason for existence, and boys and girls may then freely and without\r\nfear of censure listen to the wants and promptings of their nature....\r\nThe support of the children will no longer depend on the chance of\r\nbirth. Like their instruction it will become a charge of society. There\r\nwill be no room for prostitution or for marriage, which is in sum\r\nnothing more than prostitution before the mayor.\"\r\n\r\nOn page 897 of the old 1897 edition of the \"Encyclopedia of Social\r\nReform,\" an earlier work edited by W. D. P. Bliss, we are informed that\r\nSocialism would allow all to live in permanent monogamy, but would not\r\nforce people to remain married if they were unwilling to do so. \"The\r\nCommunist Manifesto,\" the work that made Marx and Engels famous among\r\nSocialists the world over, thus answers the charge made against the\r\nRevolutionists regarding their opposition to monogamy:\r\n\r\n     \"What the communists might possibly be reproached with is that they\r\n     desire to introduce, in substitution for a hypocritically\r\n     concealed, an openly legalized community of women.\"\r\n\r\nJules Guesde, a French Socialist, affirms in \"Le Catéchisme Socialiste\"\r\nthat \"the family is now only an odious form of property and must be\r\ntransformed or abolished.\"\r\n\r\nThe French Socialist leader, Jaurés, in a parliamentary speech said that\r\n\"They [_i.e._, married men and women] were free to make the marriage and\r\nshould in the same way be free to unmake it. In fact, just as the will\r\nof one of the parties could have prevented the marriage, so the will of\r\none should be able to end it. The power to annul should, of course, be\r\nall the stronger when both parties desire it.\" It need scarcely be added\r\nthat free-love would in most cases begin with the voluntary dissolution\r\nof the marriage ties.\r\n\r\nWhile the program of the French Socialist Party, adopted at Tours in\r\n1902, does not explicitly advocate free-love, still it calls for \"the\r\nmost liberal legislation on divorce.\" Ernest Belfort Bax, a prominent\r\nEnglish Socialist, in \"Outlooks From a New Standpoint,\" affirms that \"a\r\nman may justly reject the dominant sexual morality; he may condemn the\r\nmonogamic marriage system which obtains today; he may claim the right of\r\nfree union between men and women; he may contend he is perfectly at\r\nliberty to join himself, either temporarily or permanently with a woman;\r\nand that the mere legal form of marriage has no binding force with him.\"\r\n[\"Outlooks From a New Standpoint,\" by Ernest Belfort Bax, page 114 of\r\nthe 1891 edition.]\r\n\r\n\"Prostitution for private gain is morally repellent. But the same\r\noutward act done for a cause transcending individual interest loses its\r\ncharacter of prostitution.\" [Ibid., page 123.]\r\n\r\n\"There are few points on which advanced radicals and Socialists are more\r\ncompletely in accord than their hostility to the modern legal monogamic\r\nmarriage.\" [Ibid., page 151.]\r\n\r\n\"There are excellent men and women, possibly the majority, born with\r\ndispositions for whom a permanent union is doubtless just the right\r\nthing; there are other excellent men and women born with lively\r\nimaginations and Bohemian temperaments for whom it is not precisely the\r\nright thing.\" [Ibid., page 157.]\r\n\r\n\"Herein we have an instance of the distinction between bourgeois\r\nmorality and Socialist morality. To the first it is immoral to live in a\r\nmarital relation without having previously subscribed to certain legal\r\nformalities.... To the second ... to live in a state of unlegalized\r\nmarriage defileth not a man, nor woman.\" [Ibid., page 158.]\r\n\r\n\"Socialism will strike at the root at once of compulsory monogamy.\"\r\n[Ibid., page 159.]\r\n\r\nQuotations from this base free-love book will end with the following:\r\n\"If it be asked 'is marriage a failure?' the answer of any impartial\r\nperson must be 'monogamic marriage is a failure'--the rest is silence.\r\nWe know not what the new form of the family, the society of the future\r\nin which men and women will be alike economically free, may involve, and\r\nwhich may be generally adopted therein. Meanwhile we ought to combat by\r\nevery means within our power the metaphysical dogma of the inherent\r\nsanctity of the monogamic principle.\" [\"Outlooks From a New Standpoint,\"\r\nby Ernest Belfort Bax, page 160 of the 1891 edition.]\r\n\r\n\"Outlooks From a New Standpoint,\" from which these quotations have been\r\ntaken, was advertised in the price list of the Social Democratic\r\nPublishing Company of Milwaukee; and though it was sold for a dollar a\r\ncopy at Victor Berger's establishment, it has never been used by the\r\nSocialists of America to prove to the world that they do not advocate\r\nfree-love.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that \"Outlooks From a New Standpoint\" was sold at\r\nBerger's own publishing company, it is somewhat surprising to see him,\r\nin the August 10, 1912, edition of his paper, the Milwaukee \"Social\r\nDemocratic Herald,\" attacking, in a party squabble, \"the men in control\r\nof the 'International Socialist Review,' ... who publish books in\r\ndefense of what our enemies call free-love.\" Further on in the factional\r\nquarrel he writes: \"I shall leave out the Christian Socialists entirely.\r\nMany of them are honest in this fight. But these Christian\r\nSocialists--who are only a handful--are being used by cowardly assassins\r\nand practical free-lovers as a cat's paw.\" Perhaps the Socialist\r\npublishers would be a little more free with their love for each other,\r\nif there was less competition for the silver dollar.\r\n\r\nErnest Belfort Bax in another book, \"Religion of Socialism,\" thus\r\ndenounces the present form of family life: \"We defy any human being to\r\npoint to a single reality, good or bad, in the composition of the\r\nbourgeois family. It has the merit of being the most perfect specimen of\r\ncomplete sham that history has presented to the world.\" [\"Religion of\r\nSocialism,\" by Ernest Belfort Bax, page 141 of the 1891 edition.]\r\n\r\n\"Socialism, Its Growth and Outcome,\" edited by Ernest Belfort Bax and\r\nWilliam Morris, also advocates free-love, for its authors tell us that\r\nunder Socialism \"property in children would cease to exist, and every\r\ninfant that came into the world would be born into full citizenship, and\r\nwould enjoy all its advantages, whatever the conduct of its parents\r\nmight be. Thus a new development of the family would take place, on the\r\nbasis, not of a predetermined life-long business arrangement, to be\r\nformally and nominally held to irrespective of circumstances, but on\r\nmutual inclination and affection, an association terminable at the will\r\nof either party.... There would be no vestige of reprobation weighing on\r\nthe dissolution of one tie and the formation of another.\" [\"Socialism,\r\nIts Growth and Outcome,\" by Ernest Belfort Bax and William Morris, pages\r\n299 and 300 of the 1893 edition.]\r\n\r\nThe \"International Socialist Review,\" December, 1908, states that\r\n\"Socialism, Its Growth and Outcome,\" by William Morris and Ernest\r\nBelfort Bax, is \"a standard historical work long recognized as being of\r\nthe utmost value to Socialists.\" According to the price list sent out\r\nfrom the National Office of the Socialist Party this work on free-love\r\nwas on sale there for fifty cents a copy. Chas H. Kerr and Company, the\r\nSocialist publishing company of Chicago, in their catalogue advertised\r\nthe same book as being one of the most important works in the whole\r\nliterature of Socialism, by the two strongest Socialist writers of\r\nEngland. From these facts the reader may judge for himself whether or\r\nnot the Revolutionists of America tell the truth when they claim that\r\nthey are not the enemies of the family.\r\n\r\nIn a speech delivered on November 12, 1907, Henry Quelch, editor of the\r\nSocialist paper, \"London Justice,\" made the following statement: \"I do\r\nwant to abolish marriage. I do want to see the whole system of society,\r\nas at present constituted, swept away. We want no marriage bonds. We\r\nwant no bonds at all. We want free-love.\"\r\n\r\nEdward Carpenter in his book, \"Love's Coming of Age,\" tells us that\r\n\"marriage relations are raised to a much higher plane by a continual\r\nchange of partners until a permanent mate and equal is found.\"\r\n\r\nThat this work on free-love might find a ready market among Socialists,\r\nChas. H. Kerr and Company advertised it as follows in the \"International\r\nSocialist Review,\" Chicago, December, 1902:\r\n\r\n     \"He [i.e., Carpenter] faces bravely the questions that prudes of\r\n     both sexes shrink from, and he offers a solution that deserves the\r\n     attention of the ablest leaders of popular thought, while his\r\n     charmingly simple style makes the book easy reading matter for any\r\n     one who is looking for new light on the present and future of men\r\n     and women in their relations to each other.\"\r\n\r\nIn a 1912 catalogue the same publishing company volunteered the\r\ninformation that \"'Love's Coming of Age' is one of the best Socialist\r\nbooks yet written on the relations of the sexes.\" In a 1917 booklet it\r\nwas advertised by the company as being \"by far the most satisfactory\r\nbook on the relations of the sexes in the coming social order.\"\r\n\r\nCarpenter's work was sold for a dollar a copy at the National Office of\r\nthe Socialist Party in Chicago, and yet the Revolutionists persist in\r\ntelling us that they do not advocate free-love.\r\n\r\nAugust Bebel, the late leader of the German Socialists, was the author\r\nof a book entitled, \"Woman Under Socialism.\" This work, however, is\r\nbetter known by the simple appellation, \"Woman.\" A simple quotation will\r\nsuffice to show that Bebel, like many other excellent Socialist\r\nauthorities, advocates free-love:\r\n\r\n     \"If incompatibility, disenchantment or repulsion set in between two\r\n     persons that have come together, morality commands that the\r\n     unnatural and therefore immoral bond be dissolved.\" [\"Woman Under\r\n     Socialism,\" by Bebel, page 344 of the 1904 edition in English.]\r\n\r\nBebel's book has had an immense circulation. Over thirty editions have\r\nbeen issued, and translations have been made into nearly all the\r\nEuropean languages. Before his death in August, 1913, he was the\r\nadmiration of millions of the Revolutionists the world over. His book is\r\nconsidered everywhere as a standard work on International Socialism and\r\nis, of course, on sale with the other free-love publications at the\r\nNational Office of the Socialist Party. Chas H. Kerr and Company in 1917\r\nadvertised Bebel's work as being one of the greatest Socialist books\r\never written.\r\n\r\nFrederick Engel's \"Origin of the Family,\" a work that has made its\r\nauthor famous among Socialists on both sides of the Atlantic, contains\r\nthe following statement relative to free-love:\r\n\r\n     \"These peculiarities that were stamped upon the face of monogamy by\r\n     its rise through property relations will decidedly vanish, namely\r\n     the supremacy of men and the indissolubility of marriage.... If\r\n     marriage founded on love is alone moral, then it follows that\r\n     marriage is moral only as long as love lasts. The duration of an\r\n     attack of individual sex love varies considerably according to\r\n     individual disposition, especially in men. A positive cessation of\r\n     fondness or its replacement by a new passionate love makes a\r\n     separation a blessing for both parties and for society. But\r\n     humanity will be spared the useless wading through the mire of a\r\n     divorce case.\" [\"The Origin of the Family,\" by Fredrick Engels,\r\n     page 99 of the 1907 translation into English by Untermann.]\r\n\r\n\"The Comrade,\" New York, November, 1902, thus commends Engel's book:\r\n\"One of the most important issues of that excellent Standard Socialist\r\nSeries published by Chas. H. Kerr and Company is 'The Origin of the\r\nFamily,' by Fredrick Engels, now for the first time translated into\r\nEnglish by Ernest Untermann. This book, first published in 1884, has\r\nbeen translated into almost every European language and has long been\r\nregarded as one of the classics of Socialist philosophical literature.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Call,\" New York, February 27, 1910, deems \"The Origin of the\r\nFamily\" worthy of editorial comment: \"The one book that contains in\r\nsmall compass what every woman ought to know is Fredrick Engel's 'The\r\nOrigin of the Family.' Every Socialist woman should become a book agent\r\nto sell this book.\"\r\n\r\n\"The International Socialist Review,\" October, 1902, expressed its\r\nadmiration of Engel's work by stating that \"this book has long been\r\nknown as one of the great Socialist classics and has been translated\r\ninto almost every other language than English.... The book is really one\r\nof the two or three great Socialist classics; and now that it is in\r\nEnglish, it must find a place in the library of everyone who hopes to\r\nmaster the real fundamental philosophy underlying Socialism.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Origin of the Family,\" notwithstanding[20] the fact that it\r\ncontains matter too foul to comment on, for example a certain comparison\r\nthat is made on page 39, was listed with the books sold at the National\r\nOffice of the Socialist Party, and at Chas. H. Kerr and Company, the\r\nlargest Socialist publishing company in the United States.\r\n\r\nErnest Untermann, the American Socialist who translated Engel's work\r\ninto English, writes on page 7 of the preface of the 1907 edition: \"The\r\nmonogamic family, so far from being a divinely instituted union of\r\nsouls, is seen to be the product of a series of material, and in the\r\nlast analysis, of the most sordid motives.\"\r\n\r\nRives La Monte, in \"Socialism Positive and Negative,\" tells his readers\r\nthat \"from the point of view of this Socialist materialism, the\r\nmonogamous family, the present economic unit of society, ceases to be a\r\ndivine institution, and becomes the historical product of certain\r\ndefinite economic conditions. In the judgment of such Socialists as\r\nFredrick Engels and August Bebel, we shall probably remain monogamous,\r\nbut monogamy will cease to be compulsorily permanent.\" [\"Socialism,\r\nPositive and Negative,\" by Rives La Monte, page 98 of the 1907 edition.]\r\n\r\nIn the \"International Socialist Review,\" February, 1909, there appears\r\non page 628 a notice which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The 'Review' lately returned to a contributor a clever and\r\n     readable article in which he emphasized certain absurdities and\r\n     miseries of the present marriage system. His letter in the reply to\r\n     us raises some interesting questions, and we are glad to publish\r\n     it: ... 'It is disappointing to be advised to frankly discuss\r\n     subjects of such importance as religion and marriage only in hushed\r\n     whispers behind closed doors. In the fear of offending conservative\r\n     prejudice on these topics, some Socialists become more conservative\r\n     than the bourgeois themselves.... Of course, the main stream and\r\n     most important phase of Socialism is the political-economic\r\n     agitation, but at the same time the Socialist movement inevitably\r\n     brings into being, at least for a great part of its adherents, a\r\n     new culture, a new literature, a new art, a new attitude toward sex\r\n     relations and religion and individual freedom, a new conception of\r\n     life as a whole. In face of this fact it is sickening to see\r\n     individuals, whom one knows to be atheists, defending Socialism as\r\n     the will of God and the fulfilment of Christianity; and other\r\n     individuals, whom one knows to be free-lovers, going out of their\r\n     way to defend the home and family against the inroads of\r\n     capitalism. Nevertheless such things are seen.... There are\r\n     thousands of women who are worn out with the bearing of unwelcome\r\n     children on account of ignorance of proper ways of preventing\r\n     conception.... If sex life, the personal heart life, of\r\n     revolutionists were more free and joyous, if they breathed an\r\n     atmosphere of liberty and spontaneity, free from religious and\r\n     moral superstitions, if they became now as much like the free\r\n     people of the future as possible, would they not be that much more\r\n     ardent and joyous and unceasing workers of the Great Revolution?\r\n     And if former non-Socialists, especially women who had suffered\r\n     grievously from the evils of the marriage system, or been\r\n     intellectually blindfolded by religious teaching, were first led\r\n     into the light of more emancipated ideas by some of us Socialists,\r\n     would not they serve and glorify Socialism forever?... If the\r\n     Christian Socialists have a right to their God, and monogamists to\r\n     their eternal marriage, then surely in a revolutionary movement\r\n     like ours, the complete revolutionists have, to say the least, an\r\n     equal right to their agnosticism and their free union.\"\r\n\r\nClarence M. Meily, before speaking explicitly of free-love, praises lust\r\nand sensuality in the highest terms on page 129 of his book,\r\n\"Puritanism\": \"Freed from the privation of millenniums of unrequited\r\ntoil, with the wealth and wonders of the world at its command, it is\r\nfairly certain that the emancipated working class, still wan from its\r\ncenturies of service and sacrifice, will take great joy in repudiating,\r\nfinally and forever, the fallacies and aberration of asceticism.... Not\r\nthe denial of life, but the laudation and triumph of life, will be the\r\nkeynote of the new ethics. The lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye,\r\nthe pride of life, will become new formulas, holy and pure in the light\r\nof the perfect development of the whole man, and of all men, to which\r\nthe race will dedicate itself.\"\r\n\r\nMeily then approaches the marriage question and says: \"The question of\r\nthe status of marriage in the new society is one of extreme importance,\r\nsince it is here that reactionaries of all sorts center their opposition\r\nto social reconstruction. It is both idle and disingenuous to assert\r\nthat marriage as a legal and civil institution is not likely to undergo\r\nprofound modification.... The artificial perpetuation of the marriage\r\ntie, in the face of the disinclination of the parties involved to\r\ncontinue the relation, will cease to be a matter of public concern, or\r\nthe occasion of state interference. The dissolution of the marriage\r\nrelation will become as purely a personal and private affair as is the\r\nassumption of the relation now. Some sort of registration may be\r\nrequired for the purpose of vital statistics.\"\r\n\r\nIn July 2, 1901, \"The Haverhill Social Democrat,\" apparently without\r\nfear of offending its subscribers, asked: \"What is there sacred in the\r\nmodern home? Can anything be sacred which is based on a lie or on\r\nimpurity, or on ignorance? The marriage system today is based on\r\nimpurity, on ignorance and on a big lie.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Call,\" New York, December 4, 1910, tells its readers to \"give all\r\nwomen the vote, and they will strike off the rusty chains that hold them\r\nstill in marriage as the property of the man.\"\r\n\r\nThat the same paper is very lax as regards the divorce evil, so closely\r\nallied to free-love, is evidenced from the following quotation taken\r\nfrom the edition of March 30, 1913: \"Among the many encouraging signs of\r\nwoman's growing strength--of her determination to be at last the captain\r\nof her soul and the master of her faith--are recent divorce\r\nstatistics....\r\n\r\n     \"Far from being a sign of moral decadence, the large number of\r\n     divorces granted to women is one of the healthiest portents of the\r\n     regeneration of the body social....\r\n\r\n     \"The divorced woman is today the connecting link between the\r\n     non-resisting, ignorant victim of the past and the self-reliant,\r\n     enlightened, eugenically minded woman of the future. The divorce\r\n     statistics of the present are perfectly logical and the divorced\r\n     woman is a cheering omen, as she fulfils her historic mission.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Little Catechism\" for the use of the children of Bohemian\r\nSocialists, a book from which we have already had occasion to quote in\r\nthe previous chapter, shows us the exceedingly low standard of morality\r\nthat is taught to the youthful Revolutionists; for in answer to the\r\nquestion, \"Is adultery a sin?\" we are astounded by the boldness of the\r\nreply, \"It is not a sin.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall finally corroborate our charge that the Revolutionists advocate\r\nfree-love by quoting the words of no less an authority than Morris\r\nHillquit, who concedes in \"Everybody's,\" February, 1914, page 233, that\r\n\"Most Socialists stand for dissolubility of the marriage ties at the\r\npleasure of the contracting parties.\"\r\n\r\nAs many Socialist books on free-love have attained a high circulation,\r\nand as they have not been repudiated by the party, but have been praised\r\nand advertised in its newspapers, and, moreover, since these very books\r\nhave been sold as standard works both at the National Office of the\r\nparty and at the leading Socialist book-stores of America, the only\r\nreasonable conclusion to be drawn is that the number of party members\r\nwho openly advocate free-love, or at least tacitly approve of its\r\npropaganda, must be in the majority, for otherwise the party would never\r\ntolerate such a condition of affairs within its ranks.\r\n\r\nOnce the Socialists gain control of a country, as in the case of Russia,\r\nlaws legalizing free-love are very soon passed. In the No. 2 edition of\r\nthe Los Angeles magazine, \"More Truth About Russia,\" its radical editor\r\nmentions many of the Bolshevist laws on marriage, divorce, etc., in\r\nvogue in Russia. Among them is one fully legalizing free-love, making it\r\npossible for married parties to change partners whenever they wish and\r\nfor no other reason than their mutual or individual desire to do so:\r\n\r\n     \"1. Marriage is annulled by the petition of both parties or even\r\n     one of them.\r\n\r\n     \"2. The petition is submitted, according to the rules of local\r\n     jurisdiction, to the local court.\r\n\r\n     \"Note: A declaration of annulment of marriage by mutual consent may\r\n     be filed directly with the department of registration of marriages\r\n     in which a record of that marriage is kept, which department makes\r\n     an entry of the annulment of the marriage in the record and issues\r\n     a certificate.\r\n\r\n     \"3. On the day appointed for the examination of the petition for\r\n     the annulment of marriage, the local judge summons both parties or\r\n     their solicitors.\r\n\r\n     \"4. Having convinced himself that the petition for the annulment of\r\n     the marriage really comes from both parties or from one of them,\r\n     the judge personally and singly renders the decision of the\r\n     annulment of the marriage and issues a certificate thereof to the\r\n     parties.\"\r\n\r\nThis chapter shows that free-love filth, to corrupt and demoralize our\r\npeople, is being propagated by the Socialist Party of America through\r\nits National Headquarters in Chicago, Berger's publication company in\r\nMilwaukee, Hillquit's \"New York Call,\" and other publishing houses and\r\npapers affiliated with the party. Yet, because the question of the\r\nqualifications of five representatives of this system of abomination to\r\nmake laws for the State of New York was so much as raised by a judicial\r\ninquiry in the New York Assembly, that body of legislators has been\r\nassailed and falsely charged with undermining the fundamental principles\r\nof representative government. The ignorance concerning the true\r\ncharacter of the Socialist Party of America is startling.\r\n\r\nIs it not time for the American people to awake? Should not every decent\r\nAmerican petition all our legislative bodies, state and national, to\r\noutlaw the Socialist Party of America and curb its iniquitous\r\npropaganda?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE RACE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo most persons it will certainly be a surprise to hear that race\r\nsuicide has been openly advocated in the columns of leading Socialist\r\npublications. True it is that the number of individuals endeavoring to\r\nspread this practice by their writings is comparatively[21] small;\r\nstill, as the articles have continued to appear for years at more or\r\nless regular intervals, without exciting anything like serious\r\nopposition, we are forced to conclude that advocacy of race suicide is\r\nlooked upon by a very large number of the Revolutionists as one of their\r\ncharacteristic virtues.\r\n\r\nThough many vile articles advocating race suicide were published in the\r\n1910 and the 1911 editions of \"The New York Call,\" we shall pass them\r\nover, and discuss those of a more recent date.\r\n\r\nIn the Sunday editions of \"The Call,\" Anita C. Block has for years been\r\nediting a page called \"Woman's Sphere.\" This section of the paper on the\r\n24th of March, 1912, contained an editorial comment under the caption\r\n\"Enforced Motherhood and the Law,\" in which the practice of base and\r\ncriminal race suicide is encouraged:\r\n\r\n\"Within a space covering not much more than a month, six letters have\r\nbeen received by us, containing in substance about what is contained in\r\nthe following letter:\r\n\r\n     \"'Mrs. A. C. Block, New York City:\r\n\r\n     \"'Dear Comrade Block.--I have been a reader of \"The Call\" since\r\n     December 1, 1911. I do not know whether you can give me any\r\n     information as to what I wish to know....\r\n\r\n     \"'I have three children, 3½ years, 2¼ years, and a baby 9 months.\r\n     Now, you cannot blame me if I do not care for more for some time to\r\n     come....\r\n\r\n     \"'Could you give any information? Dr.... in \"...\" [We suppress the\r\n     author's name and the title of his work.] and \"...\" by ... contain\r\n     the sentence, \"Every woman should know prevention of conception.\" I\r\n     should be thankful for any advice.\r\n\r\n     \"'Yours for the Co-operative Commonwealth.'\"\r\n\r\nThe editorial comment then goes on to say:\r\n\r\n     \"Four of these letters we answered personally, stating the\r\n     impossibility of imparting this information under our present laws.\r\n     But when letters continued to come, we felt that any subject that\r\n     indeed meant everything in the world to the wives of the working\r\n     class, was entitled to publicity in these columns.\r\n\r\n     \"These women ought to know exactly what the laws are that make the\r\n     giving of this terribly needed information--A Felony. And so we\r\n     print below the Federal or United States law on this subject.\"\r\n\r\nThe law is then given in all its details, after which the New York State\r\nlaw on the same subject is also quoted.\r\n\r\nWe are then told that \"such are some of the laws on this grave subject,\r\nand, of course, no sane person would endeavor to violate them, openly at\r\nany rate. But as Dr.... states elsewhere in this page, we cannot be\r\nprevented from agitating for their repeal. Nor can we be prevented from\r\neducating the people wherever possible to an understanding that a\r\nknowledge of the means of preventing conception is a knowledge of one of\r\nthe means of regenerating the race.\r\n\r\n     \"Moreover even under Socialism, where economic conditions will be\r\n     such that every woman can support a dozen children in comfort if\r\n     she wants to, the volitional limitation of offspring will be\r\n     completely justifiable. For even parents in the most comfortable\r\n     circumstances should have the right to determine how many children\r\n     they want. Of all things in the world this is a matter for the\r\n     individual and not for society to determine.\"\r\n\r\nDr...., to whom reference was made in the above editorial comment, is\r\nalso the author of another work advertised as follows in \"Woman's\r\nSphere\" of \"The Call,\" March 24, 1912:\r\n\r\n     \"The three most important measures for the improvement of the human\r\n     race from a eugenic standpoint. What are they? I suppose everybody\r\n     who has given the subject any thought has his remedies. I have\r\n     studied the subject for years and my answer is:\r\n\r\n     \"1. Teaching the people the proper means of the prevention of\r\n     conception so that the people may have only as many children as\r\n     they can afford to have, and to have them when they want to have\r\n     them.\r\n\r\n     \"2.....\r\n\r\n     \"3.....\r\n\r\n     \"Of the three measures the first one is the most important and\r\n     still it will be the last one to come, because our prudes think it\r\n     would lead to immorality. And nevertheless I will repeat what I\r\n     said several times before, that there is no single measure that\r\n     would so positively, so immediately contribute toward the happiness\r\n     and progress of the human race as teaching the people the proper\r\n     means of regulating reproduction. This has been my sincerest and\r\n     deepest conviction since I have learned to think rationally. It is\r\n     the conviction of thousands of others, but they are too careful of\r\n     their standing to express it in public. I am happy, however, to be\r\n     able to state that my teachings have converted thousands; many of\r\n     our readers who were at first shocked by our plain talk on this\r\n     important subject are now expressing their full agreement with our\r\n     ideas. And Congress may pass draconian laws, the discussion of this\r\n     subject cannot, must not, be stopped.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 13, 1913, another article on the subject of race suicide, by\r\nClara G. Stillman, appeared in \"Woman's Sphere\" of \"The Call\" under the\r\ncaption, \"The Right to Prevent Conception.\" Only part of the foul\r\ncomposition is here given:\r\n\r\n     \"Those who are convinced that the voluntary prevention of\r\n     conception is a most important weapon in the modern fight with\r\n     poverty, disease and racial deterioration, will find their position\r\n     only strengthened by survey of their opponents' objections. These\r\n     objections are mainly of three kinds--and might be classed as the\r\n     pseudo-religious, the pseudo-moral and the pseudo-scientific,\r\n     because all are based on conceptions which our present state of\r\n     knowledge and social development have enabled us to outgrow....\r\n\r\n     \"Prevention of conception is already an accepted principle among\r\n     the educated classes of every civilized country. According as the\r\n     opposition of the law and public opinion are more or less\r\n     stringent, it is practised with more or less secrecy; but secret or\r\n     open, the practice is here to stay, and it is spreading. The fear\r\n     of most of its opponents is, therefore, not nearly so much that the\r\n     human race will become extinct as that its best elements will\r\n     gradually be replaced by the worst. At first this may seem\r\n     plausible. Granting our opponents' premise temporarily, the\r\n     conclusion is logically unavoidable that in order to restore a\r\n     normal relation between the so-called more and less intelligent or\r\n     desirable classes of society, we must put into the hands of all the\r\n     methods of restricting their increase, now utilized only by the\r\n     few.\"\r\n\r\nOn June 1, 1913, \"Woman's Sphere\" of \"The Call\" contained a four-column\r\narticle on race suicide, entitled, \"Musings of a Socialist Woman.\" The\r\nauthor, Antoinette F. Konikow, who was a delegate to the Socialist\r\nNational Conventions of 1908 and 1912, thus expresses her views:\r\n\r\n     \"I consider the question of the prevention of conception to be of\r\n     greater value to women than even the knowledge of sexual\r\n     diseases....\r\n\r\n     \"After meeting hundreds of women and girls in heart to heart talks,\r\n     I came to the sincere conviction that lectures on sex hygiene which\r\n     do not give a thorough understanding of conception in its definite\r\n     bearings on practical life and also of its possibilities of\r\n     prevention--that such lectures miss their main aim in bringing help\r\n     to distressed humanity....\r\n\r\n     \"Instead of meeting every need and demand of the worker, we are so\r\n     hampered by the fear of getting a bad reputation among our enemies\r\n     that we express our support to a new tendency only after it has\r\n     acquired a certain respectability in society....\r\n\r\n     \"Do the daring words of Comrade Clara G. Stillman or Dr....'s\r\n     article not hurt the feelings of some of our Comrades? No doubt\r\n     some readers felt dissatisfied but not more so than others who had\r\n     to read the conservative statement of Comrade Carey in 'The\r\n     Leader,' that he considers Bebel's conception of the family\r\n     un-Socialistic and anti-Socialistic....\r\n\r\n     \"Do our morals stand on a higher plane, thanks to the careful\r\n     guardianship of our laws?...\r\n\r\n     \"It is high time then to serve notice upon all our benevolent\r\n     censors and upholders of such laws, and declare ourselves fit to\r\n     get along without their superior guidance. It is time to open a\r\n     crusade against this hypocritical suppression of knowledge, which\r\n     leads to endless and needless suffering. It is time to emphatically\r\n     declare the right of the mother to control the functions of her own\r\n     body for her own good and the welfare of her offspring.\"\r\n\r\nThe disastrous consequences of such a crusade to further the cause of\r\nrace suicide are very forcibly brought home to us by an article which\r\nappeared in \"The Call,\" May 10, 1914, on \"The Conscious Limitation of\r\nOffspring in Holland\":\r\n\r\n     \"Our headquarters at The Hague and our subdivisions in all our\r\n     greater towns are spreading theoretical leaflets and pamphlets; but\r\n     the special pamphlet giving practical information in the prevention\r\n     of conception, is only given to married people when asked. We are\r\n     lecturing everywhere. But the essential missionary work is done\r\n     privately and modestly, often unconsciously by showing the happy\r\n     results in their own families, by the nearly 5,000 members of our\r\n     league spread over the whole country, among whom are physicians,\r\n     clergymen and teachers, etc. Every day information is asked by\r\n     letters and still more by our printed postcards; all information is\r\n     given cost-free and post-free. Almost all younger doctors and\r\n     midwives are giving information, and are helping mothers in the\r\n     cases when it is wanted on account of pathological indications.\r\n     Moreover special nurses are instructed in helping poor women.\r\n     Harmless preventive means are more and more taking the place of\r\n     dangerous abortion. So, merely by our freedom of giving\r\n     information, we have reached the desirable results proved most\r\n     brilliantly by the statistical figures of our country.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 21, 1914, \"Woman's Sphere\" of \"The Call\" devoted two more of its\r\ncolumns to the race suicide propaganda in the form of an article by\r\nSonia Ureles under the caption, \"Hats Off, Gentlemen, The Law!\" Since\r\nmany parts of the production are too foul to permit our quoting them, we\r\nshall give but a few short passages:\r\n\r\n     \"But the doctors only scowled, and the nurse told her gently that\r\n     the law did not permit poor people to regulate the birth of their\r\n     offspring....\r\n\r\n     \"To the thought of a private practitioner she gave no heed; it was\r\n     to her a luxury undreamed of....\r\n\r\n     \"The nurse, a well-meaning honest creature, writhed uncomfortably\r\n     under her gaze. 'It's--it's against the law to give out such\r\n     information,' she stammered.\r\n\r\n     \"'I don't care about the law,' came the stubborn reply. 'You\r\n     promised. Now tell me.' Nevertheless she left the hospital without\r\n     the information....\r\n\r\n     \"She applied to the women of her neighborhood for information. They\r\n     told her things they thought they knew, and things they thought\r\n     they ought to know. And her health was the price she paid....\r\n\r\n     \"They who knew, but would not tell, left her one alternative. She\r\n     chose it. And so,\r\n\r\n     \"'Hats off, gentlemen--the law!'\"\r\n\r\nIn this same issue of \"The Call,\" May 24, 1914, there is an editorial\r\ncomment that promised the base devotees of race suicide an abundance of\r\nfilthy reading matter for the future:\r\n\r\n     \"If unwelcome motherhood is not in accordance with a constructive\r\n     eugenic program, then the free imparting of information concerning\r\n     the prevention of involuntary motherhood must be. But as has been\r\n     pointed out in these columns again and again, to make this part of\r\n     a constructive eugenic program is to run up against vicious and\r\n     barbarous state and federal laws which make the giving of necessary\r\n     information a crime, punishable by imprisonment.\r\n\r\n     \"In connection with this entire subject we call the attention of\r\n     our readers to the grim sketch by Sonia Ureles, appearing elsewhere\r\n     on this page today.\r\n\r\n     \"This is the first of a series of stories on the same subject which\r\n     Miss Ureles is writing for 'Woman's Sphere.' All who know the vivid\r\n     reality of this writer's work will look forward to them with keen\r\n     anticipation.\"\r\n\r\nLet it not be thought for a moment that \"The Call\" has yet given up its\r\npropaganda of race suicide. As recently as May 25, 1919, there appeared\r\nin the magazine section of that vile Socialist daily of New York City an\r\narticle on the subject entitled, \"Birth Control and the War,\" the\r\narticle being no less than twelve columns long. Several quotations are\r\nhereby given:\r\n\r\n     \"Everywhere the feudal-minded ones act upon substantially the same\r\n     impulse. Everywhere they impel and, to a large extent, though by\r\n     indirection, they compel, prolific breeding among the less\r\n     intelligent persons. These latter are also the victims of the\r\n     prevailing religious, political, economic and industrial systems\r\n     and superstitions. The feudalistic ones proclaim fecundity as a\r\n     religious duty to God and a moral duty to the state. By psychologic\r\n     tricks a vanity of the unfortunate classes is encouraged so as to\r\n     make even the fools believe, or, at least, feel that they, too,\r\n     have a place in the sun....\r\n\r\n     \"By the uniform activities and lingering dominance of the feudal\r\n     mind we have remained in a state of development in which we\r\n     compete, like the stock-raiser, for an international and\r\n     intercredal supremacy in and through breeding....\r\n\r\n     \"As yet we have had no very urgent need for territorial expansion.\r\n     Our turn is coming and is coming soon, if only we will heed our own\r\n     feudal-minded ones, and will breed fast enough. But, without being\r\n     aggressors in this sense, we are yet unavoidably drawn into the\r\n     vortex of a world war inaugurated by the feudal-minded of other\r\n     nations and unconsciously promoted to a small degree by our own\r\n     feudal-minded ones by education for feudal-mindedness and for\r\n     prolific breeding in our people....\r\n\r\n     \"The next world war may possibly be one in which the disadvantaged\r\n     of all nations will fight the feudal-minded of all nations.\r\n     Something quite near to such an invitation already has come from\r\n     Russia. Shall we hasten such a conflict by continuing to preach the\r\n     sacredness of fecundity and of war? Or shall intelligent restraint\r\n     of the feudalistic compulsion help us toward a more perfect and\r\n     peaceful adjustment with the processes that make for the\r\n     democratization of welfare, with and by intelligent family\r\n     limitation as one means?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Call\" is one of the official papers recognized by the Socialists of\r\nAmerica. In 1914, while the race suicide propaganda was being carried on\r\nin its columns, lectures to be delivered for its benefit by Eugene V.\r\nDebs in many of the cities of New Jersey were advertised in its columns.\r\nIt is most likely, therefore, that such a splendidly informed leader of\r\nthe Revolutionists as Debs, like many thousands of members of the rank\r\nand file of the party, read some of the articles favoring race suicide.\r\nAs we have never yet heard of Debs or a single Socialist complaining\r\nagainst the race suicide propaganda so long carried on in the columns of\r\n\"The Call,\" we shall, unless the Marxians repudiate this form of\r\nimmorality of their paper, be forced to conclude that their leader as\r\nwell as a very large number of his followers intend legalizing this vice\r\nif they ever gain control of our country.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1919, a vile, crimson pamphlet was on sale in the radical\r\nbook-stores of the middle west. We shall not give the title, for it is\r\ntoo foul and indecent. On page 4 it warns its readers \"not to forget\r\nthis fact, celibacy, absolute continence from want of desire congenial\r\nor acquired, monkish asceticism are pathological states, diseased states\r\nof mind or body.\" Further on, we read, on page 10:\r\n\r\n     \"Do not be a suffering Jesus. Do not take him as an example. Do not\r\n     whine or snuffle, but get ahead in the world while you can. Get\r\n     lands, property and independence somehow....\r\n\r\n     \"The teachings of Christianity were designed for the castration of\r\n     the human soul. Christ would make you, not a free man, a hero, and\r\n     a warrior, but a hireling, a submissive beast of burden, a helot, a\r\n     nobody. Christianity is cowardice institutionalized and\r\n     peace-on-earth is the philosophy of the tax gatherer, the usurer,\r\n     and the international exploiter.\" On the inner side of the back\r\n     cover of the foul pamphlet a book is advertised by the\r\n     \"International Socialist Control Association of Chicago,\" which\r\n     seems also to publish the crimson pamphlet from which the above\r\n     quotation was taken. The advertisement of the book is hereby given\r\n     in part:\r\n\r\n     \"MOTHERS AND FATHERS, ATTENTION.\r\n\r\n     \"The welfare of the world depends upon the bringing up of children.\r\n\r\n     \"Everything depends upon the right start, hence it is your highest\r\n     duty to see that your children are started right.\r\n\r\n     \"Foremost men say and statistics show the stupendous peril of our\r\n     political, religious, and educational system. The root of education\r\n     is not merely knowing how to read and write, but knowing men\r\n     analytically and scientifically.\r\n\r\n     \"Anything is possible to the man who knows how and why. We develop\r\n     and plan out your life according to your adaptions and\r\n     inclinations--no guess work but cold, hard, mathematical facts. We\r\n     show you how to control, manage, and handle humanity and make it\r\n     your business to shape men's minds as easily as clay.\r\n\r\n     \"Misery, superstition and poverty must go.\"\r\n\r\nOn the back cover sheet of the pamphlet it is stated that the\r\nInternational Socialist Control Association of Chicago is \"An\r\norganization that teaches the suppressed and downtrodden truth, long\r\ncontrolled by the political and religious machine. The only organization\r\nthat places health, happiness and marriage upon solid, scientific\r\nprinciples.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1919, \"The Call\" of New York City, Morris Hillquit's\r\nvile publication, became more bold than ever in favoring race suicide.\r\nOn June 29, 1919, for instance, there appeared a three-column article in\r\nthe magazine section of the paper, entitled, \"The ... League.\" Parts of\r\nthe article are hereby quoted:\r\n\r\n     \"Many readers of 'Woman's Sphere' have expressed themselves as\r\n     eager to know the raison d'etre of The ... League, which is the\r\n     latest development in the birth control movement.\r\n\r\n     \"The answer is that this new league is started to speed up the\r\n     birth control movement. Its first aim is to take the question\r\n     straight to Congress and repeal the Federal statute which prohibits\r\n     the circulation of contraceptive knowledge. All the restrictive\r\n     state laws are modeled on this Federal obscenity statute. If that\r\n     is repealed, the state laws can easily be made to follow suit....\r\n\r\n     \"The repeal of this obnoxious out-of-date legislation is the\r\n     longest single step toward that end.\r\n\r\n     \"The next step is to get the subject taught in the medical schools,\r\n     and to have the best possible scientific information wisely and\r\n     well distributed. Every health agency in the country should have it\r\n     for the benefit of all who are in need. It should be available at\r\n     hospitals, clinics, dispensaries, maternity centers, charity\r\n     organizations and, most of all, through the Federal Health Service\r\n     and the National Children's Bureau....\r\n\r\n     \"Most Socialists are already convinced of the rightness of birth\r\n     regulation, but not all of them see the need for working now to\r\n     free the information. Some say, 'Oh, just work to achieve Socialism\r\n     and when we have that, things like birth control will come without\r\n     effort.' ...\r\n\r\n     \"Birth control is a necessary tool for the struggle after social\r\n     justice. Therefore, Socialists should insist upon it right now, and\r\n     not be content to wait for the Co-operative Commonwealth to bring\r\n     it to them, also they should not hesitate to co-operate with\r\n     non-Socialists to get it. Birth control is a blessing to humanity\r\n     as a whole. Everybody needs it.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 13, 1919, \"The Call\" published an editorial on Dr. Abraham\r\nJacobi who had recently died. In the course of the editorial the\r\nfollowing statement is made:\r\n\r\n     \"Many honors have been showered upon Dr. Jacobi, but probably none\r\n     will be more brilliant than the fact that he was one of the first\r\n     to fearlessly discuss the question of birth control.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 15, 1919, there appeared in \"The Call\" the letter of the\r\ndirector of the birth control league similarly praising the late Dr.\r\nJacobi:\r\n\r\n     \"...He did not wait till the baby was born, nor did he limit\r\n     himself to what is ordinarily known as the prenatal care. He again\r\n     and again proved his sincere belief that the only way to give\r\n     babies a fair chance in this world is for the parents to know how\r\n     to regulate the family birth rate.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Call\" on July 14, 1919, advertised seven birth control meetings to\r\nbe held during the week in New York City. Two days later, on July 16, it\r\nadvertised an open air birth control rally.\r\n\r\nIn \"Woman's Sphere\" of the magazine section of \"The Call,\" July 27,\r\n1919, there appears another three-column article favoring race suicide,\r\nentitled, \"How Shall We Change the Law?\" We shall quote briefly:\r\n\r\n     \"Once it is no longer on the statute books that it is unlawful to\r\n     impart information on the prevention of conception, then people may\r\n     freely help each other to attain the precious information so\r\n     urgently needed. The 'limited' bill would give this right only to\r\n     doctors and possibly to nurses and midwives....\r\n\r\n     \"And while we would not be so unscientific as to deny for a moment\r\n     that it would be better for every woman to get her advice and\r\n     instruction concerning the use of contraceptive directly from a\r\n     doctor, nevertheless it is impossible to overestimate the help men\r\n     and women could give each other were the free exchange of\r\n     information on methods of birth control legal instead of\r\n     illegal....\r\n\r\n     \"We feel quite sure that women will get infinitely more sympathetic\r\n     help and advice from each other than they will ever get from any\r\n     free clinic doctors.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Call\" on July 26, 1919, announced that Anita C. Block, editress of\r\n\"Woman's Sphere\" of the paper, had accepted nomination as a delegate to\r\nthe August 30, 1919, convention of the Socialist Party in Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe September 2, 1919, issue of \"The Call\" states that it received the\r\ncongratulations of the National Convention of the party then assembled\r\nat Chicago. There is, however, no record of any Socialist complaint\r\nagainst its continued race suicide propaganda. We can, therefore, draw\r\nour conclusions as to whether the Socialists approve of propagating race\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\nAway down in Mexico there lives a certain Linn A. E. Gale, a young\r\nSocialist who fled to that country from the United States to escape\r\nconscription. He is a \"brave\" fellow, for not only did he shirk his\r\nduties as a soldier and flee from his native land to escape jail, but he\r\npublishes a Socialist magazine in Mexico City in which he seeks to\r\ndeprive of life those who have as much right to it as he himself has; in\r\nother words he is carrying on a campaign for race suicide. We quote from\r\nthe August, 1919, issue of his Socialist publication, known as \"Gale's\r\nMagazine\":\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Felix F. Palavinci,\r\n\r\n     \"Manager of El Universal,\r\n\r\n     \"Mexico City, D. F. Mexico:\r\n\r\n     \"Sir.--It is generally believed that you inspired the recent act of\r\n     the health department of this city in having confiscated copies of\r\n     a Spanish translation of ...'s famous book on how to practise birth\r\n     control, and in sentencing me to the penitentiary when I refused to\r\n     pay a $500 fine for publishing the said translation, which\r\n     outrageous and malicious penalty was revoked by order of Mexico's\r\n     Secretary of State, Manuel Aguirre Berlanga.\r\n\r\n     \"It is hard to believe that a man of your intelligence and supposed\r\n     progressive ideas would be guilty of such a contemptible act. Yet\r\n     facts are facts and the facts leave little room for doubt that you\r\n     were to a large extent, if not almost entirely, responsible. The\r\n     persistent series of bitter and abusive articles published by your\r\n     newspaper, El Universal, against birth control and against me\r\n     personally, constitute convincing proof of your interest in\r\n     preventing contraceptive information from being diffused among the\r\n     Mexican people....\"\r\n\r\nIn the same issue of Gale's Mexican Socialist magazine there appears an\r\narticle entitled, \"First Congress of the National Socialist Party of\r\nMexico.\" Speaking of the party platform to be adopted, Gale says in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n     \"Another clause should put the party squarely on record as opposing\r\n     the recent tyrannical and illegal effort of the Mexico City health\r\n     department to prevent the dissemination of scientific birth control\r\n     information among the poorer classes.\"\r\n\r\nHysterical critics of the New York Assembly have accused the Judiciary\r\nCommittee of that body of accepting as evidence against the five\r\nsuspended Socialist Assemblymen every conceivable reproach against the\r\nSocialist Party of America which could be scraped together out of its\r\nentire history. An inquiry to ascertain the qualifications of Socialists\r\nto make the laws of the land assuredly would be justified in searching\r\nevery possible source of information. But, as a matter of fact, the\r\nJudiciary Committee confined its investigation to evidence bearing\r\ndirectly upon the political and governmental aspects of the case.\r\n\r\nHad the Judiciary Committee wished to bring out what would most surely\r\nand deeply shock the moral sense of the American people--the organized\r\npropagation of immorality with which the five suspended Assemblymen were\r\nlinked--the facts given in this and the preceding chapter show that no\r\ndifficulty would have been found in digging up overwhelming evidence.\r\nThe preceding chapter shows the propagation of free-love doctrines\r\nthrough all the publicity departments of the Socialist Party of America.\r\nThe present chapter shows that the \"New York Call,\" the chief political\r\norgan of the New York State branch of the Socialist Party of America,\r\nwith which the five suspended Assemblymen were most intimately linked,\r\nhas for years carried on an unclean and indecent propaganda to teach all\r\nwithin its polluting reach to violate one of the laws of the State of\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nSOCIALIST ORGANIZATION AND \"BORING IN\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe avowed enemies of our constitutional government have within recent\r\nyears met with stupendous success in persuading the credulous to rely on\r\ntheir extravagant promises and to look forward to the golden era of\r\nSocialism with the same bright hopes that little children do to the\r\ncandies and toys in kidnappers' homes.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked why the conspirators against our country, religion,\r\nfamily and everything dear to us are so successful in their efforts to\r\nundermine the foundations of a grand and glorious nation like our own,\r\nthe answer is that their astounding progress is due, first, to an\r\nexceptional zeal in the propagation of their doctrines, and, secondly,\r\nto the deceptive and specious arguments used for gaining recruits.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary activity that has secured for the Socialists of the\r\nUnited States by far the greater part of a million votes in several\r\npresidential elections, and the acceptance of their revolutionary\r\ndoctrines by a much larger number of radicals, who for one reason or\r\nanother do not vote the Marxian ticket, is manifested under many\r\ndifferent aspects.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Party of the United States in the early part of 1919\r\ncontained a little more than 100,000 dues-paying members, enrolled in\r\napproximately 7,000 locals and branches. The members of these locals and\r\nbranches frequently meet to devise means for spreading the doctrines of\r\nKarl Marx and for overthrowing the government of our country. It is\r\nalmost needless to add that their zeal would do great credit to men\r\nengaged in a truly noble cause. The American people would be astounded\r\nat their activity, should they carefully read, from the first to the\r\nlast page, a single copy of one of the foremost Socialist papers such as\r\nthe \"New York Call.\" Socialists are working by the tens of thousands\r\nevery day, from January 1st to December 31st, endeavoring to undermine\r\nour government. They have been doing this for years, and only recently\r\nhave the American people begun to wake up. Waking up, however, will not\r\nsuffice. We must act, act quickly and vigorously, before it is too late\r\nand before the forces of destruction become too numerous to control.\r\n\r\nSupplementing the indoor work of the locals and branches, one cannot but\r\nnotice the so-called soap-box orators, found on the street corners of\r\nnearly every city of importance in the country. The specialty of these\r\nmen is to preach class hatred and arouse dissatisfaction in their\r\naudiences with the present system of government and industry, and after\r\nthis to assert, but never to prove, that Socialism is the sole remedy\r\nfor the evils of our time.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to remember that the revolutionary Socialist Party, even\r\nas far back as 1913, published in the United States some 200 or more\r\npapers and periodicals in English, German, Bohemian, Polish, Jewish,\r\nSlovac, Slavonic, Danish, Italian, Finnish, French, Hungarian, Lettish,\r\nNorwegian, Croatian, Russian and Swedish. Attorney General Palmer made\r\nthe number over 400 in 1919. Among the papers are two important dailies\r\nin English, \"The Call\" of New York City and the \"Milwaukee Leader,\" two\r\ndailies[22] in German, two in Bohemian, one in Polish, and one in\r\nYiddish, the \"Forward,\" which in the spring of 1919 had a circulation of\r\nabout 150,000. The \"Appeal to Reason\" was once the greatest Socialist\r\nweekly in the country having had, in the fall of 1912, a circulation of\r\nnearly a million copies. About the latter part of 1917 it became\r\nlukewarm in upholding Socialist anti-war principles. As a consequence it\r\nlost most of its circulation, and in March, 1920, was still looked upon\r\ncontemptuously by most members of the Socialist Party.\r\n\r\nBy the vivid pictures which the revolutionary papers and periodicals\r\ndraw of the abuses, corruptions and wrongs of our age, they succeed in\r\nblinding many American citizens to such an extent that the latter do not\r\nrealize that they have been caught in the snares of a deceitful and\r\ndangerous enemy. Like the soap-box orators, these publications, besides\r\ncriticising real present-day abuses, frequently lie and exaggerate, and\r\neither assert that in the Marxian state man would enjoy the choicest\r\nblessings under heaven, or else arrive at this same conclusion by\r\narguing from false and unproven assertions as premises. The Socialist\r\npapers and periodicals, notwithstanding their beautifully painted\r\npictures of the visionary state, should in no way incline us towards\r\nenlisting under the red flag. For to say nothing of their lies and\r\nexaggerations, neither their criticisms of actual present-day wrongs,\r\ntheir unproven assertions of the benefits of Socialism, nor their\r\nconclusions drawn from false and unfounded premises, show in any wise\r\nthat the Marxian state would remedy existing evils and be a source of\r\nblessings to our people. Indeed, it would be just as foolish for us to\r\ntrust in these revolutionary publications as it would be to confide in\r\nquacks who should ask us to purchase their so-called remedies merely\r\nbecause they had pointed out the harmful effects of a few drugs sold by\r\na certain apothecary, or because they had claimed excellent healing\r\nproperties for their own potions.\r\n\r\nNot only do the Marxians exert great influence through the papers which\r\nthey publish, but they help their cause to a great extent by articles\r\npublished in non-Socialist papers and magazines of the United States.\r\n\r\nAnother way in which they have distinguished themselves for their\r\nactivity is by the immense number of books, novels and pamphlets they\r\nhave written, large numbers of which are in circulation throughout our\r\ncountry and are rapidly undermining the very foundations of our National\r\nGovernment. As these works are found in abundance and are available to\r\nall classes of persons in public libraries, our country's library system\r\nis supplying its enemies with well-stocked arsenals wherein weapons are\r\nkept for the use of those who will one day join the ranks of these\r\nnational conspirators.\r\n\r\nThe leaflet campaign of the Socialists has long since reached alarming\r\nproportions. To show what progress has been made by the arch enemies of\r\nour country, two quotations are hereby presented to the reader. The\r\nfirst is a letter which appeared in \"The Call,\" New York, March 31,\r\n1919, and reads as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Editor of 'The Call':\r\n\r\n     \"We are living in the days of big events. The revolution in Russia\r\n     has taught us some things that we ought to follow. One of them is\r\n     the distribution of literature. In the past we have been climbing\r\n     up four or five flights of stairs, standing on the street corners\r\n     handing out leaflets, wearing out our strength and patience. I took\r\n     a leaf out of the way the thing is done in Germany at present. All\r\n     over the city there are any number of large window sills, at the\r\n     top or very near the exits of the subway and elevated stations, the\r\n     window sills of large stores. These window sills will hold a large\r\n     amount of literature. Comrades going to work in the morning could\r\n     very easily place the leaflets on them; it would take only a few\r\n     seconds, the workers coming after them will pick them up. There is\r\n     also, in the downtown districts, quite a few empty newsstands that\r\n     are not used in the morning. These newsstands are generally at the\r\n     very mouth of the subway stations. Then there are a number of\r\n     benches in and on the stations that can be used. Our overcoat\r\n     pockets will easily hold 100 or 200 pieces of literature. The time\r\n     it takes to transfer the literature from our pockets to the window\r\n     sills, newsstand or bench is about two seconds. I have been on the\r\n     job for the last three weeks and the results have been astonishing.\r\n     What are not picked up by the workers are in a few hours read by a\r\n     large number of those out of work. We have got to come to it in the\r\n     very near future. The halls are closed to us; let's get busy.\r\n\r\n     \"Very cold, windy and rainy mornings are not very good ones. The\r\n     one big drawback is to get some Comrade to write the leaflets. The\r\n     leaflet I have used is one taken from 'The Call,' issued by local\r\n     Kings, entitled 'Hell in Russia.' The way the workers grab it does\r\n     your heart good.\r\n\r\n     \"Yours for the education of the workers,\r\n\r\n     \"Andrew B. DeMilt.\r\n\r\n     \"P. S.--The above-named places are also good for that 'Call' you\r\n     have laying around the house.\"\r\n\r\nIn the April 24, 1919, edition of \"The Call,\" under the caption,\r\n\"Official Socialist News,\" and the subheading, \"Queens\" (County, New\r\nYork), we read:\r\n\r\n     \"100 Socialists Wanted\r\n\r\n     \"One hundred are required tonight to aid in distributing Socialist\r\n     literature throughout the Ridgewood section. Those who are able and\r\n     willing to help should call this evening at the Queens County Labor\r\n     Lyceum, Myrtle and Cypress Avenues.\"\r\n\r\nThe number of revolutionary books, pamphlets and papers on the market is\r\nreally astounding, and all out of proportion to the number of\r\nSocialists, Communists and I. W. W.'s who could possibly support them.\r\nMoney for their publication must be forthcoming from other interested\r\nparties of considerable means. In fact, Deputy State Attorney General\r\nSamuel A. Berger, in a statement published in the \"New York Times\" on\r\nOctober 18, 1919, declared that rich radicals of the metropolis were the\r\nmeans of support for all but two of the forty or fifty extremely radical\r\npublications which reach 3,000,000 readers from New York City as a\r\ncenter. The same public official added that he did not have the\r\nauthority to make known the names of the well-to-do men and women\r\nengaged thus in financing the plot to overthrow our National\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nNot only are the Reds rapidly undermining our institutions by means of\r\nliterature, but also through the forces of organized labor. Enough has\r\nalready been said in a previous chapter relative to the I. W. W. itself;\r\nbut it will not be out of place to comment on the revolutionary\r\ninfluence which the I. W. W. and many Socialist labor leaders as, for\r\nexample, Maurer of Pennsylvania, are bringing to bear upon the American\r\nFederation of Labor.\r\n\r\nThe members of the I. W. W., as well as the Socialists and Communists\r\nthroughout the country, have all along made every endeavor to fan the\r\nflames of class hatred between rich and poor, the employer and employee.\r\nThey have, moreover, left nothing undone to promote discontent and\r\nstrikes on as large a scale as possible with a view to finally ruining\r\nour present system of industry and the Government itself. Read any of\r\nthe radical papers and you will be convinced that the \"Red\" rebels now\r\nplace the greatest hopes for their rise to power in the strikes they are\r\nfomenting wherever and whenever an opportunity is offered.\r\n\r\nThe Marxian leaders realize that the high cost of living is constantly\r\ngaining recruits for their cause, and that the greater the number of\r\nstrikes and the greater the number of persons involved, the longer it\r\nwill take to reduce the cost of the necessaries of life. They know that\r\nif the working class secures a six-hour day, a five-day week and, in\r\naddition, an immense increase in wages, production will fall far short\r\nof the demand, the cost of living will go up by leaps and bounds, and\r\nbusiness men will be ruined. Workingmen will then lose their positions\r\nand discontent will be far more prevalent than ever. Again, if laboring\r\nmen can only be made to break their wage contracts soon after every\r\nvictorious strike, the industries of the whole country will soon be\r\n\"topsy-turvy.\"\r\n\r\nWhat will bring on strikes more readily than to teach rebellion against\r\nall conservative labor leaders who would oppose uncalled-for walk-outs?\r\nIt is much easier to get men to strike by having labor agitators\r\nharangue and deceive them, than it would be to have the workingmen\r\nquietly discuss both sides of the question honestly and fairly and then\r\nvote pro or con.\r\n\r\nSympathetic strikes are well calculated to bring on a general strike,\r\nwhich might easily lead to the rebellion that the Reds so much desire.\r\nStrikes very often induce the action of courts against the workers\r\ninvolved and frequently demand the use of police and the calling out of\r\ntroops, and thus the rebel \"Reds\" obtain other arguments, sound or\r\notherwise, to win more of the working-class to their diabolical cause.\r\nIf the Socialist strike leaders are imprisoned, justly or not,\r\nSocialists do not fail to start nation-wide agitations for amnesty.\r\nStrikes, therefore, excessive demands, the breaking of wage contracts,\r\nrevolts against conservative labor leaders, and impassioned\r\nclass-conscious strike agitators are among the leading assets of the\r\nMarxian rebels for starting a bloody rebellion.\r\n\r\nMany of the laboring class, especially newly arrived immigrants, cannot\r\nsee the ultimate aim of the radical leaders and never dream of the\r\nterrible times that will soon overwhelm them if the cost of living\r\ncontinues to rise, business is ruined, and a terrible rebellion drenches\r\nour fair land with rivers of blood, leaving in its trail anarchy, crime\r\nand evils without end. Of what use are higher wages won by strikes, if\r\nthe cost of living ascends still more rapidly? Of what use are higher\r\nwages for a short time if all industries and our Government with them\r\nare to be ruined through continual strikes and unreasonable demands\r\nsuggested and agitated by men who have never yet given a single proof\r\nthat their Socialistic scheme would not fall a prey to anarchy and war?\r\nThe Reds, no matter of what type they are, have never proven that their\r\nstate would be a success, or that it would not have a million times as\r\nmany defects as our present system. Their empty assertions prove nothing\r\nbut the empty-mindedness and ignorance of their illogical rank and file.\r\n\r\nYes, Socialist, Communist and I. W. W. influence is making itself felt\r\neven in the American Federation of Labor. During 1919 many an\r\nunauthorized strike took place against the will of the lawful labor\r\nleaders. The printers' strike and longshoremen's strikes in New York\r\nCity are examples. \"Red\" labor leaders and revolutionary propaganda\r\nruined the cause of the steel strikers.\r\n\r\nThe American Federation of Labor cannot afford to harbor Socialists and\r\nmembers of the I. W. W. It is doomed to shipwreck if it does not rid\r\nitself of Marxian agitators. The vast majority of the American people\r\nwill not tolerate a revolutionary American Federation of Labor any more\r\nthan they will tolerate a revolutionary I. W. W. If the principles of\r\nthe American Federation of Labor become radical like those of the I. W.\r\nW., the Socialists, Communists and the Bolsheviki, the name \"American\"\r\nand past conservatism will never save our greatest labor organization\r\nfrom ruin. The greater part of the country is rapidly lining up against\r\nunreasonable demands made in the name of organized labor, millions of\r\nfarmers taking the lead. Extreme advantages to city workingmen would\r\nspell ruin to the farmers. Millions of others of the middle class in our\r\ncities will also soon unite with the farmers, for they are getting tired\r\nof the endless and costly series of unreasonable strikes.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists and agents of the I. W. W. have for years been \"boring\r\nfrom within\" the A. F. of L. In other words, these Marxians, though\r\nmembers of the A. F. of L., are undermining its conservatism,\r\ndiscrediting and seeking to displace its less radical leaders, changing\r\nits policy of co-operation between capital and labor into one of class\r\nhatred between employee and employer, and attempting to reorganize it\r\nalong industrial lines, rather than along those of the various craft\r\ndivisions of each industry, with a view to making strikes more\r\nwidespread and dangerous for our Government. In a word, they are seeking\r\nto turn the A. F. of L. into a second I. W. W., destined to join forces\r\nwith Haywood's discredited industrial union of rebels.\r\n\r\nWilliam Z. Foster, national leader of the steel strikers in the fall of\r\n1919, affords us an example of an I. W. W. agent \"boring from within\"\r\nthe A. F. of L.\r\n\r\nMr. Carl W. Ackerman informs us in the \"Boston Evening Transcript,\"\r\nSeptember 24, 1919, that the first appearance of Foster as a radical was\r\nin 1910, when, as a reporter for the \"Seattle Call,\" a Socialist paper\r\nat that time, he was sent along the Pacific Coast to report a number of\r\nso-called free speech fights. \"From this,\" continues Mr. Ackerman, \"he\r\nappears to have developed into a general agitator. As a result of his\r\ntour of the west he joined the I. W. W. and in this capacity he began to\r\nadvocate sabotage....\r\n\r\n     \"In 1911, while a member of the I. W. W., Foster went to Europe and\r\n     visited France, Germany and Hungary as a correspondent of\r\n     'Solidarity,' the official organ of the I. W. W. in America, at\r\n     that time published at New Castle, Pa. He wrote many articles for\r\n     this publication, some of them signed, 'Yours for the I. W. W., W.\r\n     Z. Foster,' and others, 'Yours for the revolution, W. Z. Foster.'\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter written by Foster in 1911 and on file in the office of the\r\nUnited States District Attorney in Chicago, Foster said:\r\n\r\n     \"I am satisfied from my observation that the only way for an I. W.\r\n     W. to have the workers adopt and practice the principles of\r\n     revolutionary unionism, which I take it is its mission, is to give\r\n     up the attempt to create a new labor movement, turn itself into a\r\n     propaganda league, get into the organized labor movement, and by\r\n     building up better fighting machinery within the old unions than\r\n     these possessed by our reactionary enemies, revolutionize these\r\n     unions, even as our French syndicalist fellow-workers have so\r\n     successfully done.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter, showing Foster's plan of \"boring from within\" the A. F. of\r\nL., was signed, \"Yours for the revolution.\"\r\n\r\nAs late as 1915 Foster brought out a book entitled, \"Trade Unionism, the\r\nRoad to Freedom.\" Several excerpts taken from the sixth chapter show the\r\ntrue frame of mind of this leader, who has recently gained such a\r\nfollowing in the A. F. of L.:\r\n\r\n     \"Under the new order as pictured above, government, such as we know\r\n     it, would gradually disappear. In an era of science and justice\r\n     this makeshift institution, having lost its usefulness, would\r\n     shrivel and die....\r\n\r\n     \"Criminal courts, police, jails and the like would go also. Crime\r\n     is due almost wholly to poverty. In a reign of plenty for all, it\r\n     would practically disappear.... People would no longer have to\r\n     wrangle over property rights. The industries now in the hands of\r\n     national, state and municipal governments would be given over\r\n     completely into the care of the workers engaged in them.... With\r\n     war, crime, class antagonisms and property squabbles obliterated,\r\n     and the management of industry taken from its care, little or no\r\n     excuse would exist for government.\"\r\n\r\nThe November 8, 1919, report of the Senate Committee on Education and\r\nLabor, in its investigation of the nation-wide steel strike, commented\r\nas follows on Foster:\r\n\r\n     \"Such men are dangerous to the country and they are dangerous to\r\n     the cause of union labor. It is unfair to men who may be struggling\r\n     for their rights to be represented by such leaders. It prevents\r\n     them from securing proper hearing for their cause. If Mr. Foster\r\n     has the real interest of the laboring man at heart he should remove\r\n     himself from any leadership. His leadership injures instead of\r\n     helping. If he will not remove himself from leadership the American\r\n     Federation of Labor should purge itself of such leadership in order\r\n     to sustain the confidence which the country has had in it under the\r\n     leadership of Mr. Gompers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nENLISTING RECRUITS FOR THE CONSPIRACY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe success or failure of the Marxian movement will, to a great extent,\r\ndepend upon the ability of the revolutionists to gain control of the\r\nschools, colleges and universities of the United States. That they have\r\nbeen long active in spreading their pernicious doctrines among the young\r\nis evident to all who are closely in touch with Socialist activities.\r\n\r\nIn our country there exist what are known as Socialist Sunday schools.\r\nThe revolutionists themselves tell us that the aim and purpose of these\r\nschools is the destructive work of tearing down old superstitious ideas\r\nof territorial patriotism, and that such schools should be founded in as\r\nmany places as possible, to counteract the influences of churches,\r\nsynagogues and public schools.\r\n\r\nPage 68 of the \"Proceedings of the 1910 National Congress of the\r\nSocialist Party,\" clearly indicates the exceptional importance which\r\nMarxians attach to their training of the young:\r\n\r\n     \"Among the special fields of Socialistic propaganda the education\r\n     of our boys and girls to an understanding of the Socialist\r\n     philosophy is one of the most important. The ultimate battles of\r\n     Socialism will largely be fought by the growing generation, and we\r\n     must begin early to train the latter for its part. The Socialists\r\n     of Europe have long appreciated the importance of the task, and in\r\n     almost every country they have built up a strong organization of\r\n     young people. The Socialists of America are just beginning to turn\r\n     their attention to the problem....\r\n\r\n     \"The teaching of infants is a task which requires a good deal of\r\n     professional training, and no Socialist 'Sunday schools' for very\r\n     young children should be established where we do not have\r\n     experienced and reliable teachers to conduct them....\r\n\r\n     \"It is quite otherwise with children of the maturer age of, say,\r\n     fourteen years and upward. Young people of that age normally\r\n     possess sufficient strength of mind to grasp the main philosophy\r\n     and aims of our movement intelligently, and their training into the\r\n     Socialist mode of thought and action cannot be conducted with too\r\n     much zeal and energy. Young people's clubs, societies for the\r\n     study of Socialism should be formed all over the country as regular\r\n     adjuncts to our party organization, and very serious consideration\r\n     should be given to them by the adult Socialists. But they should\r\n     remain primarily study clubs, and should not be encouraged to\r\n     engage in practical political activity, which can do but little\r\n     good to our movement, and may tend to arrest the intelligent growth\r\n     of the youthful enthusiasts. When they will reach a maturer age\r\n     they will be better and more efficient workers in the movement for\r\n     having made a more thorough study of its theory and methods.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Call,\" New York, March 30, 1913, commenting on teaching Socialism\r\nto the young, adds: \"Up to the present time only men vote in most of the\r\nstates, and they do not use the ballot until they are 21 years of age.\r\nIt stands to reason that for the intelligent use of the ballot there\r\nmust be proper preparation and education. We cannot expect people to\r\nvote right unless they are trained right....\r\n\r\n     \"If you want or expect men and women to be good and intelligent\r\n     voters at the age of 21, then something most vital must be done\r\n     with them before they reach that age. From 5 to 21, that's a long\r\n     road. That's the impressionable period. That's the time at which\r\n     the people are prepared to become good Socialists or good opponents\r\n     of Socialism. And the latter quite as readily as the former....\r\n\r\n     \"Catch them young! That's it. But how? In lots of ways. Get them\r\n     coming our way. Let them lose their fear of us. Have them come to a\r\n     dance and find out that we are human. It surprises them sometimes.\r\n     When they realize that, they are partly won.\r\n\r\n     \"Educating the young to Socialism is a matter of 'indirect' action\r\n     rather than 'direct' action. It would be the height of folly to try\r\n     to cram Karl Marx down these new young throats. That will come in\r\n     time. Start them on something easier, something less drastic. Sugar\r\n     coat your bitter pills a little.\"\r\n\r\nIt is possible, in conformity with this last suggestion, that after the\r\nparade of Socialist children of New York City, on May Day, 1913, they\r\nwere to be treated, as we are informed in \"The Call\" on the same day, to\r\na feast of ice cream and cake and a series of thrilling moving pictures\r\nof the struggles between the police and the strikers at Lawrence and\r\nLittle Falls.\r\n\r\nWith this short diversion, we shall return to the article in \"The Call\"\r\nof March 30, 1913, which goes on to say that \"the young people should\r\nbe gradually educated to rebellion and revolution. Songs will help.\r\nPlays will help. Casual talk here and there will aid. It must soak in.\r\nYou can't flood them with stuff in two days. Rebels that are made in two\r\ndays may stick in a crisis, but I don't believe they will.\"\r\n\r\nIt certainly is interesting to read \"Lesson 24,\" taken from the\r\n\"Socialist Primer,\" a little book which a man named Klein has prepared\r\nfor the use of children attending the Socialist Sunday schools:\r\n\r\n     \"Here is a man with a gun; he is in the troop. You see he has a\r\n     nice suit on. Does he work? No, the man with the gun does no work.\r\n     His work is to shoot men who do work. Is it nice to shoot men?\r\n     Would you like to shoot a man? This man eats, drinks, wears\r\n     clothes, but does no work. Do you think that is nice? Yes, this is\r\n     nice for the fat man, but bad for the thin; so he owns the man with\r\n     the gun. When the thin man will have the law on his side, there\r\n     will be no more men with guns. Who makes the gun? The man who\r\n     works. Who makes the nice suit? The man who works. Who gets shot\r\n     with the gun? The man who works. Who gets the bad clothes? The man\r\n     who works. Is this right? No, this is wrong!\"\r\n\r\nIn \"The Call,\" New York, April 17, 1919, there appeared the following\r\nadvertisement of a coming entertainment to be given by a Socialist\r\nSunday school of the Brownsville section of Brooklyn:\r\n\r\n     \"Sunday School Gives Concert in Brownsville\r\n\r\n     \"The annual entertainment and concert of the Brownsville Socialist\r\n     Sunday school will take place tomorrow evening at the Brownsville\r\n     Labor Lyceum. The capitalist press has lately discovered that there\r\n     are Socialist Sunday schools in the city. They even send their\r\n     reporters to discover what awful things Socialist children are\r\n     taught there. The American Defence Society has just undertaken a\r\n     vigorous nation-wide fight against Bolshevism in general and\r\n     Socialist Sunday schools in particular. All school children and the\r\n     parochial schools are to be enlisted in this glorious work. The\r\n     Protestant churches, not to be outdone, are also organizing to save\r\n     the children from Socialism. The growth of the Socialist schools is\r\n     throwing fear into the hearts of the capitalists. Brownsville\r\n     parents can do no better than to help make this school, now one of\r\n     the largest in the country, even better and stronger than it is. A\r\n     splendid musical program has been arranged and, in addition, the\r\n     children will sing, dance and recite. Tickets may be bought at the\r\n     Lyceum.\"\r\n\r\nEvery parent will understand the subtle, insidious poison of rebellion\r\nagainst parental authority and guidance instilled into young minds by\r\nsuch items as the following, from the \"New York Call\" of July 16, 1919:\r\n\r\n     \"Independence is one of the finest qualities of youth. In an\r\n     inspiring postal card to her mother (copies of which might well be\r\n     put into the hands of young children everywhere), Hilda Stydocker,\r\n     14, of 3 Washington Avenue, West Orange, states that she is going\r\n     to 'earn her own living and take care of herself.' Previously\r\n     gossip had been circulated to the effect that Hilda had been\r\n     kidnapped.\"\r\n\r\nIn a previous issue of \"The Call,\" April 4, 1919, part of a speech given\r\nby H. B. Shaen, president of the Brooklyn Sunday School Union, is\r\nquoted:\r\n\r\n     \"It is a question of great moment,\" President Shaen said yesterday.\r\n     \"It must be dealt with drastically, effectively and immediately.\r\n     Bolshevism is a greater menace than we like to believe. The\r\n     proposed establishment of 3,000 so-called Socialist schools in this\r\n     city will be a blow at religion, at government, at decency. It\r\n     might be a fatal error to underestimate the pernicious influence of\r\n     this organization that seeks to sow disquieting seeds by deceiving\r\n     young America with false beliefs.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Woodworth Clum, of the Greater Iowa Association, in volume 4, number\r\n1, of \"The Iowa Magazine,\" gives the following shocking account of\r\nSocialistic propaganda among school children carried on in the northwest\r\nby Townley's Non-Partisan League:\r\n\r\n     \"The Non-Partisan League, under direction of Townley and Le Seur,\r\n     has taken possession of the schools of North Dakota--and may get\r\n     control of the schools of Minnesota.... Radical doctrines are\r\n     becoming part of the regular curricula. I have a statement from O.\r\n     B. Burtness, representative in the North Dakota Legislature from\r\n     Grand Forks. Here it is:\r\n\r\n     \"'The board of administration has placed in charge of the state\r\n     library, to select the reading for our schools, C. E. Strangeland.\r\n     He is telling our school children what to read. I found in our\r\n     state library, the other day, a bundle of books, all ready to be\r\n     sent to one of our country schools--a circulating library. If the\r\n     farmers of North Dakota could have seen what I saw, they would\r\n     have come to Bismarck and cleaned out the whole Socialist gang.\r\n     Here are the titles of some of those books I saw:\r\n\r\n     \"'\"Socialism and Modern Science,\" Ferri.\r\n\r\n     \"'\"Evolution and Property,\" La Farge.\r\n\r\n     \"'\"Not Guilty,\" Blatchford.\r\n\r\n     \"'\"Love and Marriage,\" Ellen Key.\r\n\r\n     \"'\"Love and Ethics,\" Ellen Key.\r\n\r\n     \"'\"The Bolshevik and World Peace,\" Leon Trotzky.\r\n\r\n     \"'\"The History of the Supreme Court,\" Meyers.\r\n\r\n     \"'\"The Profits of Religion,\" Sinclair.\r\n\r\n     \"'\"Anarchism and Socialism,\" Harris.'\r\n\r\n     \"Ellen Key is a pronounced advocate of free-love and the\r\n     dissolution of marriage.\"\r\n\r\nIn high schools, especially those of New York City, many teachers have\r\nbeen using every opportunity for advocating Socialism and other radical\r\ndoctrines in the classroom and out of it. Students, in order to win\r\nfavor with some of these teachers, at times show zeal for Socialistic\r\ntenets both in oral and written composition. Quite a number of the\r\nteachers are Socialists themselves, have become known as such throughout\r\nthe schools and use their influence to win over others. Many books given\r\nby these teachers for outside reading are by Socialist or radical\r\nauthors.\r\n\r\nOn the editorial page of \"The New York Times,\" April 9, 1919, there is\r\nan article against the \"Teachers' Union,\" a Socialist and radical\r\norganization of many of the teachers of New York City. Under the title,\r\n\"Forbidden to Preach Sedition,\" we read:\r\n\r\n     \"There will be, presumably, much excited denunciation of the Board\r\n     of Education for closing the public schools to meetings of the\r\n     Teachers' Union. The familiar complaints about infringing the right\r\n     of free speech will be heard, and--well, the complaints will be as\r\n     ill-based as they usually are.\r\n\r\n     \"In the first place, while speech is free in this country, it is\r\n     not, any more than it is or can be, anywhere, free to the extent\r\n     that anybody is free to say anything at any time and any place.\r\n     Restrictions of several kinds there are and must be, including\r\n     those by which decency and the safety of our institutions are\r\n     protected. On the other hand, the members of the Teachers' Union\r\n     have not been reduced--as yet--to silence. They have simply been\r\n     told that they cannot use the city's property in the campaign which\r\n     they have undertaken against an important branch of the City\r\n     Government. They are still privileged to hire as many halls as they\r\n     please in which to accuse the Board of Education of tyranny, and\r\n     to protest against the enforcement of discipline against teachers\r\n     with a leaning toward Bolshevism, and a tendency to mingle\r\n     Socialistic and pro-German propaganda with instruction in the three\r\n     R's.\r\n\r\n     \"In this instance, as in so many others, the use of schoolhouses\r\n     for meetings of adults with opinions to express and doctrines to\r\n     preach has resulted unhappily. The adults who gather seem always,\r\n     or almost always, to be, not average, well-disposed citizens, but a\r\n     more or less incendiary minority who want to change things--and to\r\n     change them a lot and very quickly. That aspiration is not wholly\r\n     indefensible, for a good many things would be the better for\r\n     changing, but real light and leading have not often been found on\r\n     top at meetings in schoolhouses, and experience has proved that the\r\n     Teachers' Union has neither to offer.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is from the \"New York World\" of November 20, 1919:\r\n\r\n     \"Fifteen teachers in city schools will appear before Deputy\r\n     Attorney General Berger tomorrow afternoon to be questioned to\r\n     determine if they are dangerous radicals. Examination of the\r\n     records of the Communist Party seized in recent raids has resulted\r\n     in evidence indicating that each of the teachers is a member of\r\n     that organization....\r\n\r\n     \"Superintendent of Schools Ettinger revoked the license, yesterday,\r\n     of Sonia Ginsberg, a teacher in School No. 170 in Brooklyn, who\r\n     admitted she would like to see the United States Government\r\n     displaced by one similar to the Bolshevist regime in Russia. Miss\r\n     Ginsberg, born in Russia, was naturalized as a citizen last June.\"\r\n\r\nFor many years the Intercollegiate Socialist Society has been winning\r\ncollege and university students to the doctrines of the Social\r\nRevolution through the medium of the various branches that it\r\nestablishes in such institutions. The Intercollegiate Socialist Society\r\nsometime ago had, in the different colleges and universities of our\r\ncountry, between 60 and 70 chapters, or Socialist local societies, with\r\nSocialist libraries, and lecturers in frequent attendance. Every year\r\nchapter-delegates are sent to an intercollegiate convention from nearly\r\nall the important American universities, including Harvard, Yale,\r\nPrinceton, Columbia, Barnard, Amherst, Brown, Pennsylvania, Michigan,\r\nWisconsin, Kansas, Missouri, and Chicago. Even Vassar, which had 86\r\nmembers in the first year in which the Intercollegiate was organized, is\r\nincluded in the long list. Harry W. Laidler, organizer of the Socialist\r\nchapters and secretary of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society, claims\r\nthat all the universities now throw open their large assembly rooms for\r\naddresses by the visiting lecturers, give quarters in the college\r\nbuildings to the Socialist chapters, and permit the use of the college\r\npublications in the dissemination of propagandist literature, if it is\r\nwritten by bona fide students.\r\n\r\nWe shall reproduce a letter which shows what is going on in our colleges\r\nand universities. The identification of the writer, person addressed,\r\nand others mentioned in the letter, is made on the authority of Mr.\r\nWoodworth Clum, of the Greater Iowa Association, Davenport, Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe letter was written July 29, 1919, by Arthur W. Calhoun, then\r\ninstructor in sociology and political economy at Ohio State University,\r\nColumbus, Ohio. It was written to Professor Zeuch, then instructor at\r\nthe University of Minnesota, now an instructor at Cornell University.\r\n\"Gras,\" mentioned in the letter, is Professor N. S. B. Gras, a member of\r\nthe Faculty of the University of Minnesota. The letter also mentions E.\r\nC. Hayes, who is professor of sociology at the University of Illinois,\r\nPresident Grose of DePauw University, Greencastle, Indiana, and E. A.\r\nRoss, professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin and Advisory\r\nEditor of the American Journal of Sociology. The \"Beals\" mentioned in\r\nthe letter, says Mr. Clum, \"was formerly a university professor and old\r\nfriend of Calhoun's. He is now openly advocating Bolshevism.\" Toward the\r\nend of the letter, Calhoun says: \"Greencastle is too small to do much\r\nwith the co-op.\" This \"co-op\" is the Tri-State Co-operative Society of\r\nPittsburg, and, says Mr. Clum, \"the society's business is the production\r\nand distribution of vicious 'red' propaganda.\" Calhoun is or was one of\r\nits directors.\r\n\r\nThe letter, copied from a fac-simile of the original in volume 4, number\r\n1, of \"The Iowa Magazine,\" Davenport, Iowa, is as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"55 E. Norwich Av., Columbus, O., _July 29._\r\n\r\n     \"Dear Zeuch:--\r\n\r\n     \"I think I accept all you say about the condition of the\r\n     proletariat and the impossibility of the immediate revolution. But\r\n     I am less interested in the verbiage of the Left Wing than in the\r\n     idea of keeping ultimates everlastingly in the center of attention\r\n     to the exclusion of mere puttering reforms. One of the things that\r\n     will hasten the revolution is to spread the notion that it _can_\r\n     come soon. If the Left Wing adopts impossibilist methods of\r\n     campaign, I shall stand aloof, but if they push for Confiscation,\r\n     Equality of Economic Status, and the speedy elimination of class\r\n     privilege, and keep their heads, I shall go with them rather than\r\n     the yellows.\r\n\r\n     \"If Gras is doing what he says and I am doing what he says, he is\r\n     right in saying that he is doing the better job. I wonder, however,\r\n     how many of his students draw the 'necessary' conclusions: and I\r\n     wonder whether I do all my students' thinking for them.\r\n\r\n     \"Ellery is feeling at Columbus and also at Illinois. I had a letter\r\n     from Hayes about him.\r\n\r\n     \"I have accepted the professorship of Sociology at De Pauw\r\n     University. The job pays $2200 this year with assurance of $2400 if\r\n     I stay a second year. The president has been here three times and\r\n     had long interviews with me. Besides we have written a lot. I told\r\n     him I belong to the radical Socialists. I expounded my general\r\n     principles on all important points. He knows also of the\r\n     circumstances of my leaving Clark and Kentucky. He says he is in\r\n     substantial agreement with most of what I have said and that he\r\n     sees no reason why I can not get along at De Pauw. He says he feels\r\n     confident it will be a permanency. Ross had some hand in the game.\r\n     Pres. Grose interviewed him at Madison last week and Ross wrote\r\n     encouraging me to take the place. I did not make any great effort.\r\n     Grose knew that I did not care much one way or the other. He took\r\n     the initiative almost from the start and I sat back and waited. I'm\r\n     afraid Greencastle is too small to do much with the co-op.\r\n     Population 4000, 30 miles north of Bloomington. 800 students,\r\n     mostly in college, a few in School of Music, a few graduate\r\n     students. Hudson is prof. of Ec. there.\r\n\r\n     \"Beals was here last week. He is pushing the 'Nation.' Says the\r\n     circulation has quadrupled since they became Bolshevist.\r\n\r\n     \"As ever,\r\n\r\n     \"AWC\"\r\n\r\nThe Rand School, in New York City, is known as the University of\r\nSocialism and is said to have had 5,000 attending its lectures in the\r\nyear 1918. The purpose of the school, as originally conceived, and as\r\nadhered to throughout, is twofold, first, to offer to the general public\r\nfacilities for the study of Socialism and related subjects. This is done\r\nby its reference library and reading-room and by its large book store,\r\nin which are sold not only Socialist books, but books on atheism as\r\nwell; not only the more conservative Socialist papers, but ultra\r\nrevolutionary papers such as \"The Revolutionary Age,\" \"The Proletarian,\"\r\nmany Bolshevist publications, and \"The Rebel Worker\" and \"The New\r\nSolidarity,\" the latter two being I. W. W. papers.\r\n\r\nThe last time the author of \"The Red Conspiracy\" visited the Rand School\r\nbook store, there was on sale a pile of Birth Control Reviews several\r\nfeet high, \"The One Big Union Monthly,\" the I. W. W. organ, and enough\r\nfoul and revolutionary matter to satisfy the filthiest or most\r\nblood-thirsty wretch in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe second purpose of the Rand School is to offer to Socialists such\r\ninstruction and training as may make them more efficient workers for the\r\nSocialist movement. This is done by means of lectures, some 5,000\r\nstudents attending, on an average, 20 lectures each in the year 1918.\r\nThe school also directs extension classes in outlying parts of the city\r\nand neighboring places and correspondence courses for study classes and\r\nindividual students in all parts of the country. It conducts a bureau to\r\nprovide lectures on Socialism for clubs, trade unions, forums and other\r\norganizations not otherwise connected with the school. For years this\r\nschool, which was raided under the direction of the Lusk Committee, has\r\nbeen sowing the seeds of class hatred and class discrimination, now\r\neverywhere springing up round about us. The laws have been too tolerant,\r\nand it has been permitted to go on without interference far too long. In\r\nreferring to documents seized in the raids in the summer of 1919, Deputy\r\nAttorney General Conklin said that the papers \"are so carefully and\r\ncleverly phrased\" that no single sentence can be picked out as in\r\nviolation of the law. \"Yet,\" he adds, \"taken as a whole, the documents\r\nare seditious, in my opinion.\" They were made a matter of record,\r\nawaiting the disposition of the District Attorney of New York.\r\n\r\nThese facts speak for themselves. It scarcely need be said that unless\r\nthis propaganda is checked, the power and strength of the Socialist\r\nParty will soon assume tremendous proportions, imperilling the existence\r\nof our nation.\r\n\r\nAnother field of work to which the enemies of our country have been\r\ndevoting special attention is the propagation of revolutionary doctrines\r\namong the non-English speaking residents of the United States. Page 69\r\nof the \"Proceedings of the 1910 National Congress of the Socialist\r\nParty\" informs us that \"the American people are, after all, a nation of\r\nimmigrants. We count our Americanism by a very few generations, and the\r\nforeign population has always played an important part in the industrial\r\nand political life of the country. At this time there are over ten\r\nmillion foreign born persons in the United States. Most of them are\r\nworkers, and most of them still speak, write and read in their native\r\ntongues.\r\n\r\n     \"The powers of capital, through their political and so-called\r\n     educational agencies, and often with the aid of the churches, are\r\n     constantly at work prejudicing them against Socialism and arraying\r\n     them against organized labor.\r\n\r\n     \"The Socialists must make energetic efforts to counteract these\r\n     baneful influences and to reach the foreign workers with their\r\n     propaganda.\r\n\r\n     \"The Socialist Party has branch organizations among all, or almost\r\n     all, of these nationalities, and a few of these organizations have\r\n     reached a high degree of strength and a large measure of influence\r\n     among the people of their nationalities....\r\n\r\n     \"These organizations work under conditions different from those of\r\n     the party as a whole. In each case they deal with a special type of\r\n     persons, of a psychology and of economic conditions peculiarly\r\n     their own, and they are the most competent judges of the methods of\r\n     propaganda best suitable to their own countrymen. The party should\r\n     allow such non-English speaking organizations the greatest freedom\r\n     of action, and should assist them in every way in their special\r\n     work of Socialist propaganda.\"\r\n\r\nIt may interest the reader to learn that the Socialist Party is so much\r\nconcerned with its propaganda among foreigners, that in its 1913 May Day\r\nparade in New York City pink leaflets headed \"WOMEN, BECOME CITIZENS,\"\r\nwere distributed. They read:\r\n\r\n     \"If you hope to be a voter, remember that you must be a citizen!\r\n     Don't delay! Come to the NATURALIZATION BUREAU of the SOCIALIST\r\n     PARTY next Tuesday evening, and let us help you to become\r\n     naturalized.\" It was, of course, an understood fact that the\r\n     Socialist Party would, besides helping such women to become\r\n     naturalized, also help them to become Revolutionists.\r\n\r\nOn May 18, 1912, May Wood-Simons reported to the National Convention of\r\nthe Socialist Party the recommendations of the Woman's National\r\nCommittee, urging the carrying of the propaganda of Socialism to the\r\nhousewife, the woman on the farm, to teachers, foreign speaking women\r\nand women in industry. (\"The Call,\" New York, May 19, 1912.)\r\n\r\nThough the zeal of the national foe in its propaganda of revolutionary\r\nprinciples is manifested in many other ways, only a few more\r\nillustrations will be given. Many thousands of copies of the \"Appeal to\r\nReason,\" when it was the foremost American Socialist paper, found their\r\nway into the camps and upon the battleships of our country.\r\n\r\nAt the Socialist National Convention of 1912, held in Indianapolis,\r\nDelegate Kate Sadler pointed out how Socialist locals had been organized\r\non various battleships in the navy and how she was accustomed to hold\r\nmeetings on Sunday afternoons on the men-of-war at the navy yard,\r\nBremerton, Washington. \"We'll get the boys organized into the Socialist\r\nParty,\" she declared, and the Socialist Convention voted to adopt the\r\nresolution. (\"The Call,\" New York, May 17, 1912.)\r\n\r\nDuring recent years no one who has carefully read the public press could\r\nhave failed to notice that the Socialists have been carrying on an\r\nactive campaign of lies and deceptions in the form of letters which they\r\nhave sent to the editors of the daily papers, with the request that the\r\nsame be published for the enlightenment of the public regarding the\r\ngeneral excellency of the Socialist movement.\r\n\r\nIn \"The Call,\" New York, March 23, 1913, it is said that \"the man or\r\nwoman who can convey the message of Socialism through speaking is\r\nfortunate, and when it can be done through speaking and writing, the\r\nComrade is doubly lucky. But Ryan Walker can do it through speaking and\r\nwriting and the cartoon that makes you laugh or makes you mad.... The\r\ncartoons that Walker has been putting over in 'The Call,' 'The Coming\r\nNation' and the 'Appeal to Reason' have been copied in Socialist papers\r\nall over the world, in England, Scotland, Germany, Australia, and they\r\nare doing their work in these countries the same as they do it here. The\r\nSocialist cartoonists have been accomplishing some of the biggest\r\npropaganda work that is done by any one of our active members, and while\r\nthey are getting the laugh on capitalism, and getting the laugh on the\r\nfool workingman, they are arousing the worker to cast aside his\r\nfoolishness, and at the same time cast aside the foolishness of the\r\ncapitalist. Getting the laugh on the capitalist, showing how ridiculous\r\nand weak he is, is a great preliminary to getting rid of him.\"\r\n\r\nThe Socialists are inspired with such an ardent desire for the success\r\nof their movement, that they have written theatrical plays and have even\r\nhad moving picture films made, so that by representing in a most vivid\r\nmanner the evils and abuses of our day, they may persuade the unwary\r\nthat Socialism would mean the absence of sufferings and wrongs of every\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nWe elsewhere have called attention to I. W. W. effort to organize the\r\nnegroes of America. The work of making rebels of the negroes is also\r\ncarried on assiduously by the Socialist Party of America. Says \"The\r\nNational Civic Federation Review,\" July 30, 1919:\r\n\r\n     \"Among the propaganda material found on sale by agents of the Lusk\r\n     Committee in the Rand School book store were copies of 'The\r\n     Messenger,' on the front page of which it is called, 'The Only\r\n     Radical Negro Magazine in America,' of which Chandler Owen and A.\r\n     Philip Randolph are editors....\r\n\r\n     \"Both of the editors of this magazine, who are negroes, are\r\n     instructors at the Rand School of Social Science.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"The Open Forum\" of the September, 1919, issue of \"The Messenger\"\r\nthree letters are given as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Dear Comrade Owen:\r\n\r\n     \"I enclose a check for $25.00 as a contribution to the organization\r\n     fund being raised by 'The Messenger.' I know of no more important\r\n     and vital work in the field of American Socialism and Labor today\r\n     than the effort of your group to incorporate the large masses of\r\n     Negro workers in the ranks of the advanced and class-conscious\r\n     white workers in the industrial and political fields.\r\n\r\n     \"My heartiest wishes for the success of your movement.\r\n\r\n     \"Sincerely and fraternally yours,\r\n\r\n     \"Morris Hillquit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"To the Editors of 'The Messenger':\r\n\r\n     \"Dear Comrades.--The work which you are doing is vital.

With it goes my heart good wishes for the\r\n     success of your work.\r\n\r\n     \"Yours truly,\r\n\r\n     \"Scott Nearing.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Dear Sir and Brother:\r\n\r\n     \"Enclosed please find check for the amount of $100.00 in reply to\r\n     the appeal presented by you at the last meeting of our Board of\r\n     Directors for support to enable you to continue the noble work you\r\n     have undertaken to enlighten the colored worker in this country\r\n     upon his being exploited by the master class.\r\n\r\n     \"We wish you success in the work you are conducting on this field\r\n     and you can rely upon the assurance of our organization for all\r\n     possible assistance in the future.\r\n\r\n     \"Fraternally yours,\r\n\r\n     \"P. Monat.\"\r\n\r\nIn view of the frightful character of the very active propaganda that is\r\nbeing carried on by the enemies of our country, does it not behoove\r\nevery loyal and patriotic American to rise in his power and wipe out the\r\nRed plague that is rapidly disseminating its destructive germs\r\nthroughout the United States?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nEXPERTS IN THE ART OF DECEPTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt remains to be shown that the rapid spread of Socialism, besides being\r\ndue to the extraordinary zeal of the Revolutionists, is largely the\r\nresult of artful deception.\r\n\r\nThe Marxians, who are fond of being called \"scientific\" Socialists, may\r\nvery aptly be compared to little boys who might try to prove to their\r\nteacher that the solution of a certain problem in mathematics was\r\ncorrect, because that of another problem of an entirely different nature\r\nwas wrong. Or, better still, they may be likened to an egg dealer who\r\nwould attempt to prove to a customer that every egg in one crate was\r\ngood, because a few in another were unfit for use. The appropriateness\r\nof comparing the \"scientific\" Socialists to the amusing youngsters, or\r\nto the illogical egg dealer, will be evident to the reader when he\r\nreflects that the revolutionists, north, south, east and west, from the\r\nfirst day of January till the last of December, condemn the present\r\nsystem of government and industry, endeavoring thereby to persuade the\r\npeople that Socialism is the only remedy for the evils from which they\r\nare suffering.\r\n\r\nMost of the speeches and writings of the \"Knights of the Red Flag\"\r\nconsist in severely criticising prevalent evils. By attacking the\r\npresent system of government and industry they hope to have the\r\nworkingmen conclude that the Socialist Party alone can save mankind from\r\ncomplete ruin. This, then, is the way in which \"scientific\" Socialism\r\nleads unreflecting laborers to believe that the contemplated state would\r\nbe the most perfect institution under heaven, replete with countless\r\nblessings and free from every evil.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that the revolutionists dazzle the eyes of the weary\r\nwith the vivid pictures that they draw of intolerable civil and economic\r\nconditions, whether these be true, false or imaginary. The result is\r\nthat the poor people frequently brood over the wrongs from which they\r\nhappen to be suffering. They become so thoroughly discontented and\r\nblinded with class hatred that they are no longer able to see the\r\nadvantage of reforming the present system by constitutional and lawful\r\nmethods. Finally, when they have almost lost their reason and can no\r\nlonger realize that the drug offered them has never been proven capable\r\nof remedying the evils that weigh heavily upon them, they accept and\r\nswallow the poisonous dose of Socialism and become a thousand times more\r\nwretched than they were before. The very potion they drink, with a view\r\nto being cured, makes them most unhappy for the rest of their lives, and\r\nin many cases for all eternity. If there is anything that non-Socialists\r\nshould be on their guard against it is this base form of tactics by\r\nwhich the revolutionists have been eminently successful in gaining new\r\nrecruits.\r\n\r\nIf those whose party emblem is a flaming torch could even prove that\r\neverything without exception in the present system of industry is worthy\r\nof condemnation, and that the entire government is corrupt to its very\r\ncore, it would no more follow from this that Socialism was the remedy\r\nthan it would follow that the solution of one problem in mathematics\r\nmust be correct because another solution of an entirely different nature\r\nwas wrong, or that all the eggs in one crate must be good because there\r\nwere some in a second crate unfit for use.\r\n\r\nIt is very common for Socialists to assume that certain fundamental\r\nprinciples have been proven to be true, whereas the fact is that these\r\nvery premises, from which they draw their conclusions, are often false\r\nand without the slightest foundation. An excellent illustration of this\r\nhas already been given in preceding pages, where it was shown that the\r\nSocialists incorrectly assumed that there would be no poverty in their\r\nstate, and argued from this that there would be very little\r\nprostitution. It is evident, therefore, that unless those who listen to\r\nthe Marxians are on their guard and demand that the premises be proven\r\nthe Socialists may deduce from incorrect premises conclusions which will\r\nmake it appear that their intended state will bestow heaven's choicest\r\nblessings upon mankind.\r\n\r\nThough examples of deceit have already been given, the attention of the\r\nreader will be called to the testimony of no less an authority than\r\nEugene V. Debs, who in the following article, published in the\r\n\"International Socialist Review,\" Chicago, January, 1911, will be seen\r\nto substantiate our charge:\r\n\r\n     \"The truth is that we have not a few members who regard vote\r\n     getting as a supreme importance, no matter by what methods the\r\n     votes may be secured, and this leads them to hold out inducements,\r\n     and make representations which are not at all compatible with the\r\n     stern and uncomprising principles of a revolutionary party. They\r\n     seek to make the Socialist propaganda so attractive--eliminating\r\n     whatever may give offence--to bourgeois sensibilities--that it\r\n     serves as a bait for votes, rather than as a means for education,\r\n     and votes thus secured do not properly belong to us.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not unfrequently that we hear Socialists appealing to this or that\r\nplank of their party platform as proof sufficient that their\r\norganization favors or opposes a certain policy. An argument of this\r\nsort should have very little weight with careful thinking men, once\r\ntheir attention has been called to the fact that the Socialists have\r\nbeen proven guilty of a base lie by stating in their 1908 platform that\r\nthe party is not concerned with matters of religious belief. But even if\r\nthe revolutionists had never inserted in their platform a statement that\r\nwas untrue, nevertheless the following facts show that their platform\r\nplanks are very far from being reliable.\r\n\r\nThe delegates of the party assembled in national convention on May 15,\r\n1908, by a vote of 102 to 33 passed a plank declaring for the\r\n_collective ownership of all the land_. (\"Proceedings of 1908 National\r\nConvention of the Socialist Party,\" page 186.)\r\n\r\nIt was on September 7, 1909, less than a year and four months after the\r\nadjournment of the convention of 1908, that the words declaring for the\r\n_collective ownership of all the land_ were, by a referendum, _stricken\r\nfrom the party platform_, while by another referendum it was decided to\r\ninsert among the principles of the platform that the party was _not\r\nopposed to the occupation and possession of land by those using it in a\r\nuseful and bona fide manner without exploitation_. (\"Proceedings of the\r\n1910 National Congress of the Socialist Party,\" page 25.)\r\n\r\nAbout eight months after the adoption of this substitute plank, a bitter\r\ncontest concerning the ownership of \"all\" the land took place in the\r\nNational Congress of the party, which was held in Chicago from May 15,\r\n1910, till May 21, 1910. (\"Proceedings of the 1910 National Congress of\r\nthe Socialist Party,\" pages 220 to 235.) Thus, during the 1910 Congress,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that there existed at that time a plank in the\r\nparty platform guaranteeing the possession of land to persons who would\r\nuse it in a bona fide manner, _the representatives of the party in\r\nnational congress assembled, being unable to decide whether or not it\r\nwas to the best interests of the party to abide by this plank, referred\r\nthe matter to the next convention_. (\"Proceedings of 1908 National\r\nConvention of the Socialist Party,\" page 235.)\r\n\r\nThen, when the 1912 Convention met, it made another change, and declared\r\nfor _the collective ownership of land wherever practicable_. (\"The 1912\r\nPlatform of the Socialist Party\"--Cf. \"The Call,\" May 19, 1912.) In\r\naddition to this, it stated that _occupancy and use shall be the sole\r\ntitle to land_. (\"The 1912 Platform of the Socialist Party\"--Cf. \"The\r\nCall,\" May 19, 1912.)\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that the Convention of 1908 had previously voted down\r\nthis proposition to make occupancy and use the sole title to land, after\r\nthe proposition had been denounced as being anarchistic, unsocialistic,\r\nnonsensical, foolish, and a dream (\"Proceedings of 1908 National\r\nConvention of the Socialist Party,\" pages 188, 189 and 191.) One of the\r\nforemost opponents of the proposition was Delegate Morris Hillquit, who\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n     \"What does the amendment mean? Occupancy and use the basis of title\r\n     to land. How do we know whether the co-operative commonwealth will\r\n     infer and arrange it in that way? Aren't we taking a long excursion\r\n     into the domain of the future and into the domain of speculation?\r\n     It may be true that the dream of the dreamer may become a reality,\r\n     if this dream is the dream of the nation. But we have not come here\r\n     to dream dreams and leave it to the future to realize them or to\r\n     show them to be just mere pipe dreams.... The Socialist state may\r\n     just as well decide on an entirely different basis for the\r\n     distribution of land. It may not at all be bound to our resolution\r\n     here today that occupation forms a title.\" (\"Proceedings of 1908\r\n     National Convention of the Socialist Party,\" page 189.)\r\n\r\nWhen the Marxians are brought face to face with the charge of adopting a\r\nprogram today, rejecting it tomorrow, hesitating about it on the next\r\nday and compromising it on the fourth, as they did in respect to the\r\ncollective ownership of \"all\" the land, let them not argue that such\r\nchanges are to be expected in the evolution of Socialism. They should be\r\nforced to confess that they acted in such a way solely to gain votes.\r\nConfront them with the speeches delivered in their National Convention\r\nof 1908 and in their National Congress of 1910, both by the delegates\r\nwho advocated the collective ownership of \"all\" the land and by those\r\nwho opposed it. For the convenience of the reader passages from some of\r\nthese speeches will now be given:\r\n\r\n     Delegate Cannon of Arizona: \"I contend that the public ownership of\r\n     all machinery and land is one of the things for which the Socialist\r\n     Party is working. If some of the Comrades get up and tell us in\r\n     Germany they are not working for that, I move that we inform the\r\n     German Comrades that they are behind the times. The idea of not\r\n     including the land is nothing more or less than political\r\n     expediency.\" (\"Proceedings of 1908 National Convention of the\r\n     Socialist Party,\" page 175.)\r\n\r\n     Delegate Payne of Texas: \"I want to know if this convention of this\r\n     movement which we call the great revolutionary movement is going to\r\n     go down in history as catering to a small middle class of land\r\n     owners, or are you going to stand for the great proletarian farming\r\n     class?\" (\"Proceedings of 1908 National Convention on the Socialist\r\n     Party,\" page 181.)\r\n\r\n     Delegate Morrison of Arizona: \"Is it possible that we have so far\r\n     forgotten ourselves, that we will attempt to curry favor with a few\r\n     capitalist farmers? Why is this resolution here? What is the object\r\n     of it? What is the purpose of it? Is it to secure votes? Do you\r\n     hope to deceive some one as to the actual, real program of\r\n     scientific Socialism? Or are you, in other words, going to lie to\r\n     the farmers of this country in order to secure their suffrage? Are\r\n     you going to present something to them that you know is not\r\n     contained in the Socialist program? Can you afford, as\r\n     representatives of this great revolutionary party, to do that which\r\n     in a few years you will be ashamed of? I say no.\" (\"Proceedings of\r\n     1908 National Convention of the Socialist Party,\" page 184.)\r\n\r\n     Delegate Goaziou of Pennsylvania: \"I know we have in this country a\r\n     growing movement among Socialists who are wanting votes no matter\r\n     how they will get them. They are willing to put in appeals to the\r\n     farmers, appeals to the middle class and appeals to everybody, so\r\n     that they can get votes.\" (\"Proceedings of 1908 National Convention\r\n     of the Socialist Party,\" page 209.)\r\n\r\n     Delegate Thompson of Wisconsin: \"We know that there is a very large\r\n     portion of votes of this country on the farm, under agricultural\r\n     conditions and environment, over forty per cent. Less than thirty\r\n     per cent of the votes of this country are under industrial\r\n     conditions. When we get to the point where we want to do something,\r\n     we must have some way or other of getting these two forces welded\r\n     together. We can never win out with thirty per cent of the vote. We\r\n     will have to have at least a substantial majority, and that we\r\n     cannot have without the farmers.\" (\"Proceedings of 1908 National\r\n     Convention of the Socialist Party,\" page 185.)\r\n\r\n     Delegate Victor Berger of Wisconsin: \"We cannot have Socialism in\r\n     this country, if we don't get the farmers in some way. If you try\r\n     to take away the farms of twelve millions of farmers of this\r\n     country, you will have a big job on your hands. You might as well\r\n     try to reach down the moon.... You remember how much effort and how\r\n     many men it cost England to conquer 30,000 farmers, Boers--Boers,\r\n     mind you--and now try to take the farms from these 12,000,000\r\n     American farmers and you will have about a million times harder\r\n     job. Besides, they don't need to fight. All they have to do is to\r\n     stop bringing food to Chicago for six weeks, and Comrade Morgan and\r\n     the rest of Chicago would be knocked out.\" (\"Proceedings of the\r\n     1910 National Congress of the Socialist Party,\" page 230.)\r\n\r\n     Delegate Simmons of Illinois: \"There is just one thing on earth\r\n     that I will toady to and that is a fact. And when I meet a fact so\r\n     big as the farmer question in America, a fact that has in it the\r\n     future of 12,000,000 of people of the producing classes, without\r\n     whom we stand no more chance of a Socialist victory in this country\r\n     than we do of changing the orbit of a comet, and when I face a fact\r\n     as big as that, I don't try to stand in front of it, and howl empty\r\n     phrases, in the hope that the fact will get out of the way.\"\r\n     (\"Proceedings of the 1910 National Congress of the Socialist\r\n     Party,\" page 231.)\r\n\r\nSince the revolutionists, to win votes, frequently point to the reforms\r\nthey have proposed or in some cases accomplished, we should all be on\r\nour guard lest, being allured by these reforms, we be led into the\r\nSocialist camp, and later on suffer the dreadful evils that have been\r\nshown would result from the adoption of the Marxian system of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThose who vote the Socialist ticket insist on calling the attention of\r\nnon-Socialists to the immediate demands enumerated in their party\r\nplatform, many of which are excellent. Workingmen, however, should\r\nremember, first, that many of them are only meant for the time our\r\npresent Government is still in power; moreover, that a crime-ridden,\r\nanarchical and bankrupt state could not grant them, and, furthermore,\r\nthat there is no reason why our Government, in its present form, could\r\nnot grant all the Marxian demands that are really advantageous.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists often argue from some successful results in government\r\nownership of public utilities to the success of Socialism itself.\r\nThough it cannot be denied that government ownership of public utilities\r\nhas in some instances been a success, still anti-Socialists can just as\r\nwell argue the failure of Socialism from failures in government\r\nownership, which are entirely too numerous to require comment. If in the\r\nfuture it should become evident that great benefits would accrue from\r\nthe national, state, or municipal ownership of certain public utilities,\r\nwhich are now privately owned, our present form of government, without\r\nbecoming Socialistic, could take them over, just as many of our cities\r\nhave already taken over water, gas and power plants. But the number\r\nwould have to be limited, for it has already been shown in Chapter XVII\r\nwhat terrible consequences would follow from adopting the scheme of\r\nSocialism, whereby the people would collectively own and manage all the\r\nprinciple means of production, transportation and communication. Public\r\nownership on such a large scale, so as to conform with the plans of the\r\nrevolutionists, implies that the vast majority of workingmen would be\r\ngovernment employees. The result, as has been shown, would be a terrible\r\nreign of discontent, strife, crime, revolution and chaos; whereas the\r\nprudent purchase of a small number of public utilities, under the\r\npresent system of government, would entail none of these evils, since\r\nmost workingmen could refuse positions that they did not care for or\r\nwhere the wages would not satisfy them, and do this without injuring the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists, especially when they appeal to the less educated,\r\nfrequently argue that since their party platform says nothing concerning\r\nthe teaching of a certain doctrine, for instance free-love, it is\r\nevident that the party does not advocate it. Such a method of reasoning\r\nis, of course, absurd and utterly unworthy of men who style themselves\r\nscientific; for by arguing in exactly the same way, it would follow that\r\ntheir flag is not the red flag because there is no plank in their party\r\nplatform stating that it is.\r\n\r\nAlthough many Socialists have written an abundance of anti-religious\r\nliterature, other members of the party have composed books, pamphlets\r\nand articles that in no way attack the church. Some of the\r\nrevolutionists, in their endeavors to make their movement attractive to\r\nChristians, go so far as to claim that even Christ was a Socialist.\r\nSince, therefore, the enemies of our country have at their disposal\r\nwritings which attack religion, as well as those that are in no way\r\nhostile to it, they are well able to supply with attractive reading\r\nmatter not only atheists who are opposed to all forms of religion, but\r\nChristians, no matter to what denomination they may chance to belong.\r\n\r\nIn like manner there are to be found within the Socialist Party writers\r\nwho advocate free-love and others who are opposed to its propagation,\r\neither through a personal repugnance to legalized sin, or else because\r\nthey think that by teaching loose morals the party would alienate many\r\nprospective members. Hence, the Socialists can satisfy the depraved by\r\nrecommending to them the different works on free-love, and at the same\r\ntime they can give satisfaction to those who are opposed to the base\r\ndoctrine by referring them to books which not only do not advocate it\r\nbut even condemn it in the most emphatic way.\r\n\r\nIn this double-dealing party there is a very strong faction whose\r\nmembers advocate direct action, in other words, violence, as a means for\r\nbringing about the downfall of our Government and of the entire\r\nindustrial system. Opposed to these men, who are frequently termed the\r\n\"Reds,\" there is a rapidly disappearing faction of so-called \"Yellows,\"\r\nwho rely upon the use of the ballot, and decry direct action, either\r\nthrough personal repugnance to violence, or, as seems most likely,\r\nbecause they deem peaceful methods more prolific of votes, and\r\nconsequently of future political advantage to themselves. The direct\r\nactionists by their inflammatory speeches and writings are especially\r\nsuccessful in gaining recruits from among the more disorderly elements\r\nof society, whereas the political actionists appeal rather to those\r\npersons who are opposed to the destruction of life and property.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means uncommon for the revolutionists to avoid as far as\r\npossible the discussion of knotty problems relative to the working\r\ndetails of their contemplated state. They often do this by telling us\r\nthat the people of the future will be the ones to solve the problem in\r\nquestion. In illustration two examples will be given, the first of which\r\nis taken from the \"Appeal to Reason,\" January 6, 1912:\r\n\r\n     \"Do Socialists think all men should be paid alike--the man with the\r\n     pick the same wages as the lawyer or doctor?\"\r\n\r\n     \"Socialists differ on this proposition. Whatever a majority of the\r\n     people may decide will prevail.\"\r\n\r\nAgain we read, in the April 6, 1912, edition of the same paper:\r\n\r\n     \"Will producers get paid for the number of hours worked, or for the\r\n     amount of production?\"\r\n\r\n     \"No one knows just how the returns will be regulated, for the\r\n     reason that they are to be regulated according to the will of the\r\n     whole people and not according to the scheme of the 'Appeal to\r\n     Reason.' It is possible that both methods may be tried, and the\r\n     best prevail.\"\r\n\r\nA subterfuge that often meets with success, and which for this very\r\nreason is a favorite one among the revolutionists when they are on the\r\npoint of being defeated in an argument, consists in this, that they do\r\ntheir best to dodge the question at issue by leading their opponents off\r\non some side topic, such as the evils and abuses of the present day.\r\nEvery anti-Socialist ought, therefore, to be on his guard, and as soon\r\nas he notices the national enemy trying to draw him off on a tangent, he\r\nshould steadfastly refuse to take up the new line of argumentation, but\r\nshould compel the evader to stick to the question at issue.\r\n\r\nIt happens, too, and not unfrequently, that in the course of a dispute,\r\nwhen a Socialist is being defeated, he will ask the non-Socialist to\r\nprove that the present system is superior to that which is pictured in\r\nsuch beautiful colors by the followers of Karl Marx. Now, in the first\r\nplace, the burden of proof rests with the Socialist, for if he wishes to\r\nlead another into his camp, it is his task to prove to him that\r\neverything there is congenial and attractive. The non-Socialist would\r\nindeed act very imprudently if he should attempt to prove that the\r\npresent system offers more attractions than the Socialist Utopia whose\r\nperfections exist only in the imaginations of the revolutionists. What\r\nhe might do, however, would be to show that the present system of\r\ngovernment and industry, even in its unreformed state, is far superior\r\nto the condition of affairs that would actually exist if our\r\nconstitutional government should ever have to give way to the regime of\r\nthe revolutionists.\r\n\r\nOn reading Socialist literature or listening to the speeches of the\r\nrevolutionists one is impressed with all the wonderful benefits that the\r\nparty proposes to confer upon our citizens if it should ever rule the\r\nland. Of course very many of the proposals are made solely on the\r\nauthority of the speaker or writer. But even if they have the approval\r\nof the Party, we must not forget that it is one thing to propose to\r\ngrant a favor and quite another thing actually to grant it. There are\r\nlots of things that men say they propose to do, without ever intending\r\nto do them. And it frequently happens that after having had the best\r\nintentions, they change their minds or else are utterly unable to carry\r\nout their plans.\r\n\r\nKarl Marx about half a century ago taught the absurd doctrine that as\r\nall wealth is produced by labor, to the laborers all wealth is due. He\r\nheld, on the one hand, that all the profits arising from the sale of\r\ngoods should accrue to the workingmen in virtue of the labor required\r\nfor their production, and, on the other, that the capitalists who had\r\nnot performed any work should not be entitled to a share in the profits.\r\n\r\nThis old doctrine, unreasonable as it is, is still taught at the present\r\nday not only by European Socialists but also by the revolutionists of\r\nour own country. During the May Day parade in New York City on May 1,\r\n1912, when some 50,000 men marched behind red flags, great numbers of\r\nleaflets, entitled, \"The Issue,\" were distributed among the spectators.\r\nThese leaflets had been published by the Socialist Party of New York\r\nCity and openly advocated the old doctrine of Karl Marx, the Father of\r\nmodern Socialism, for on the third page appeared \"A Parable,\" from which\r\nwe quote the following:\r\n\r\n     \"A man was once engaged in making bricks just outside the wall of a\r\n     lunatic asylum. Presently a lunatic looked over the fence and\r\n     asked:\r\n\r\n     \"'What are you doing?'\r\n\r\n     \"'Making bricks.'\r\n\r\n     \"'What are the bricks for?'\r\n\r\n     \"'I don't know. What does it matter to me?'\r\n\r\n     \"'But why do you make them, if you don't intend to use them for\r\n     anything?'\r\n\r\n     \"'Why? Well it's my work.'\r\n\r\n     \"'But I don't see why you should work for no object. If you don't\r\n     use the bricks, who will?'\r\n\r\n     \"'How should I know? It's nothing to do with me.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Don't know what you are going to do with your own bricks?'\r\n\r\n     \"'They are not my bricks. They belong to the boss.'\r\n\r\n     \"'But didn't you make them?'\r\n\r\n     \"'Yes.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Then how comes it that the boss owns them?'\r\n\r\n     \"'It's his brick kiln and his clay hole.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Oh, didn't he make the kiln?'\r\n\r\n     \"'No; the bricklayers built them.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Did he dig the clay hole?'\r\n\r\n     \"'No; those men over there dug it.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Why do they dig clay holes?'\r\n\r\n     \"'It's their work. The boss pays them to do it.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Oh! does he pay you, too, to make these bricks?'\r\n\r\n     \"'Yes.'\r\n\r\n     \"'But where does he get the money to pay you with?'\r\n\r\n     \"'He sells bricks.'\r\n\r\n     \"'And you made those bricks he sold?'\r\n\r\n     \"'Yes.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Don't you think you'd better come inside?...\r\n\r\n     \"'But I say, how much will the boss sell those bricks for?'\r\n\r\n     \"'Oh! about $500.'\r\n\r\n     \"'How long will it take you to make them?'\r\n\r\n     \"'About ten weeks.'\r\n\r\n     \"'How much does the boss pay you for working so hard?'\r\n\r\n     \"'Two dollars and fifty cents a day.'\r\n\r\n     \"'That will be $150 in ten weeks. Ha! ha! ha! aha! he! he! he!'\r\n\r\n     \"'I don't see (wiping the sweat from his brow) the joke, you\r\n     confounded ass.'\r\n\r\n     \"'You must come inside. He! he! he!!!'\"\r\n\r\nAmerican Socialists, therefore, as well as the early German\r\nrevolutionists, teach that to the laborer all wealth is due.\r\n\r\nThough the low wages that many workingmen receive is a disgrace to our\r\ncivilization and an abuse that cries to heaven for vengeance, still it\r\nis absurd to hold that wages should be so much increased as to leave\r\nnothing for the capitalists. For, in the first place, if the workingmen\r\nshould enjoy the entire profits of their firms or industries all the\r\nowners would soon become bankrupt and fail, and, in the upheavals due to\r\nunemployment and the impossibility of supplying the necessaries of life,\r\nthe present system of our Government would certainly fall a prey to\r\nrevolution, the Socialists would come into power and then would follow\r\nthe terrible disturbances shown in Chapter XVII, \"Socialism, a Peril to\r\nWorkingmen.\"\r\n\r\nWe have no defence whatsoever to offer for dishonest capitalists, but\r\nmaintain that honest capitalists are entitled to a reasonable share in\r\nthe profits arising from their investments. For, in the first place, if\r\nit were not for the capital in the possession of honest capitalists,\r\nmillions of workingmen would be terribly handicapped in earning a\r\nliving. If this fact is not immediately evident to the reader it will\r\nbecome so when he reflects that many farm, mill and factory workers, and\r\nthe employes of many big business houses would have to seek other\r\npositions if the capital required for the industries was not supplied by\r\nthe owners. The buildings, machinery, raw materials, etc., in most\r\ncases are not and cannot be supplied by the laborers and workingmen, but\r\nare furnished by the capitalists who, if they wished, could sell them\r\nand spend the money obtained from the sale for their own personal\r\nenjoyment. For this reason, and also because the capitalists referred to\r\nare subject to many financial worries, assume great responsibilities,\r\nrun the risk of incurring serious losses of one kind or another,\r\nincluding business failure and bankruptcy, it is only just that they\r\nshould receive a reasonable recompense for their share in the production\r\nof the goods.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said regarding the falsity of the Marxian doctrine,\r\nthat to the laborer all wealth is due, it follows that the Socialists,\r\nby teaching this false principle, have been misleading the laborers and\r\nworkingmen for over half a century.\r\n\r\nSome of the best known American Socialists, when confronted with the\r\nevident fallacy of the Marxian doctrine concede that Marx was mistaken\r\nand that they do not approve of his teachings on this subject. Now, if\r\nthese leaders and their followers are in the majority, they should long\r\nago have compelled the minority in the party to stop deceiving the\r\nuneducated. On the other hand, if they themselves constitute the\r\nminority, their own personal opinions amount to little, since the\r\nmajority of the members of the Socialist Party would in that case be\r\nguilty of advocating foolish and absurd doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe attractive and popular motto, \"Workingmen of the world unite. You\r\nhave nothing to lose but your chains,\" has moved many a poor workingman\r\nto enlist in the revolutionary cause. Very little reflection, however,\r\nis needed to expose the absurdity that is found in the second part of\r\nthe motto. For no matter how badly off men may be financially, it has\r\nbeen shown that they not only would not lose their chains by uniting\r\nunder the red flag of Karl Marx but would be completely crushed by the\r\nmuch heavier ones of bloody revolution and a wretched form of government\r\nwhich would bring with it a religious prosecution and widespread\r\nlawlessness, crime and chaos.\r\n\r\nRealizing that the police would do much to help the revolutionary\r\nmovement, if they could be made friendly to it, some Socialists have\r\nbeen extremely anxious to win them over. To certify this statement we\r\nshall quote part of an article which appeared in \"The Call,\" New York,\r\nApril 25, 1911, urging Socialists to get control of the police force:\r\n\r\n     \"A policeman's vote, like any other person's vote, counts one.\r\n     Policemen are wage-earners, who, like other wage-earners, are\r\n     eager to improve their circumstances. Policemen will vote the\r\n     Socialist ticket when they realize that the Socialists in office\r\n     will insist upon their receiving more pay, more leisure, more sick\r\n     and old age benefits, more privileges.... Adopt constructive\r\n     resolutions demanding that constables be paid higher wages, that\r\n     they be granted shorter hours, that they be given more days off\r\n     each week, that they be exempted from paying part of their wages\r\n     into the superannuation fund, that they be accorded the right of\r\n     combination, that a more generous system of sick benefits be drawn\r\n     up, that they have the right of appeal against dismissal and abuse\r\n     to a representative committee of citizens.\"\r\n\r\nThe revolutionists are leaving nothing undone in their extraordinary\r\nefforts to gain recruits for the overthrow of our National Government.\r\nThis is evidenced by the appearance in their papers of articles like the\r\nfollowing, entitled, \"The Pure Water Problem,\" which was published in\r\n\"The Call,\" April 30, 1912:\r\n\r\n     \"As a political organization, the Socialist Party must address\r\n     itself to every question that interests the electorate. And in each\r\n     case it must offer the public a carefully thought out solution\r\n     instead of mere generalities and hackneyed phrases. Otherwise it\r\n     will not succeed in winning the confidence of the majority of\r\n     voters. Now almost every city in America is confronted with a pure\r\n     water and sewage disposal problem.... If the Socialist Party steps\r\n     into the arena with clear-cut proposals that deal in a radical,\r\n     constructive and common sense way with this problem, it will not\r\n     only help to secure pure drinking water for citizens, but it will\r\n     break down considerable prejudice against the Socialist movement,\r\n     and cause people to study the more revolutionary features of our\r\n     own official platform.\"\r\n\r\nInformation comes to us that on account of recent Government raids the\r\nRed organizations are assuming a variety of aliases. The Communist Party\r\nhas taken the innocuous title of \"The International Publishing Company,\"\r\nalias \"The International League of Defense.\" The I. W. W. operates under\r\nany local name which comes handy. Individual Reds often spread their\r\ndoctrines, and incite workingmen to take part in outlaw strikes, while\r\nprofessing to be members of no radical organization.\r\n\r\nThe Young People's Socialist League, closely affiliated with the\r\nSocialist Party, planned to use disguises, if necessary, after the\r\nSocialist Party adopted its anti-war program in 1917. Thus in \"Outlines\r\nof the Evidence Taken Before the Judiciary Committee of the Assembly of\r\nNew York,\" pages 608-9, appears a letter of William F. Kruse, National\r\nSecretary of the Young People's Socialist League, written to the\r\nsecretaries of its different branches, in which he urged them to have an\r\n\"unofficial emergency committee,\" have \"several copies of your most\r\nimportant records and especially your mailing list stowed away in\r\nvarious safe and secluded places,\" and have \"three trustworthy officers\r\nbroken in for each important job.\" \"At least one of these officers\r\nshould be a girl,\" he continued, \"so that if our boys are jailed for\r\nrefusal to serve, the girls can keep the League going.\" He added: \"If\r\never the Y. P. S. L. is suppressed you will immediately get together all\r\nits members as quietly as possible under the name of some athletic club,\r\ndance society or pleasure club. The name of this organization should\r\nhave nothing in common with Socialism.\"\r\n\r\nIn concluding this chapter the attention of the reader is called to the\r\nfact that the Socialists are trying their best to make it appear that\r\nthe interests of the American workingmen in general are jeopardized when\r\na member of their party is put in jail or is on trial. This is rank\r\nhypocrisy. Even if the Socialist Party was a real workingman's party,\r\nthis fact would not give it the right to set up its justly condemned\r\nbomb throwers, its preachers of Bolshevist revolution, its teachers of\r\nrace suicide, etc., as working-class martyrs and protagonists of free\r\nspeech, which they claim is no longer allowed in our country.\r\n\r\nThere are millions of workingmen in the great Republican, Democratic,\r\nand other American parties who don't need and don't want bomb-throwers,\r\nimported Marxian revolutionists, race suiciders, free-lovers, atheists,\r\nhypocrites, professional liars and deceivers to petition the Government\r\nin their name for the release of imprisoned Socialists on the plea that\r\nthese are being prosecuted because they are leaders of the\r\nworking-class. First of all, Debs, Haywood and their crews are leaders\r\nof blood-thirsty revolutionists, and not the leaders of the law-abiding\r\nworkingmen who maintain the Democratic and Republican parties. They are\r\nthe enemies of the latter, and the real object of the Socialists is to\r\nstir up trouble in our country by endeavoring to procure amnesty for a\r\nset of scoundrels who, after their release, would, by their subversive\r\nand dangerous doctrines, try to plunge the country we love and all\r\nhonest labor into a much more terrible abyss than that into which the\r\nBolsheviki have plunged Socialist Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE REDS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in the preceding chapters that the base doctrines\r\npropagated on every side by the revolutionists are among the gravest\r\nevils threatening the welfare of our nation. No doubt the reader\r\nperceives that unless this conspiracy against our country, religion and\r\nfamily is checked, the Socialists will soon overwhelm us with a bloody\r\nrebellion and establish a government that will mean nothing less than a\r\nreign of terror and a widespread prevalence of discontent, strife and\r\ncrime, finally terminating in chaos or anarchy.\r\n\r\nProvisions must, therefore, be made for averting the dire calamities\r\nthat would attend the unfurling of the red flag over Washington in place\r\nof the Star-Spangled Banner. Measures of defense must quickly be taken\r\nand an army of attack must immediately be set in motion. In this way\r\nalone can we hope to prevent the success of the revolutionary propaganda\r\nthat is characterized by a marvelous activity and an ever-increasing\r\npopularity among the unwary and uneducated. The country we love and the\r\nGovernment which has bestowed upon us innumerable blessings,\r\nnotwithstanding abuses, call upon us for help in the hour of need. True\r\npatriotism bids us take up suitable weapons and wage relentless war\r\nagainst that which would destroy our present constitutional form of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWho can turn a deaf ear to the call? In our heroic work we shall be\r\nhelped by millions of patriotic citizens whose devotion to their country\r\nhas already rallied them to the defense of the Stars and Stripes. All\r\nthat we need do, to fan into flame the fire of patriotism already\r\nglowing in their hearts, is to arouse them to a full realization of the\r\ndangers that threaten the very existence of our nation. Now is the time\r\nto act, before we hear the cry \"Too late!\" The great weapon must be\r\neducation and the ones to be enlightened on the evils of Socialism are\r\nnot merely scholars, professors and teachers, but the great masses of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to bring home to the American people a clear realization of\r\nthe threatening calamity, we ourselves must not only be thoroughly\r\nequipped with knowledge of the Socialistic teachings and their evil\r\nconsequences, but must also be able to refute the alluring and deceptive\r\narguments of the revolutionists. We must acquire a thorough knowledge of\r\nSocialism. But to do this, it almost goes without saying that we should\r\ncarefully read and study the excellent and thoroughly up-to-date\r\nanti-Socialistic works that can be had at a moderate price or readily\r\nobtained in the public libraries.\r\n\r\nAmong the best anti-Socialistic books in the English language may be\r\nmentioned \"Socialism, the Nation of Fatherless Children,\" edited by\r\nGoldstein and Avery. This book, whose authors were once Socialists,\r\ncontains hundreds of very strong and useful quotations and is of the\r\nhighest value to every student who is studying the evils and dangers of\r\nthe revolutionary movement. Published by T. J. Flynn & Co., 62 Essex\r\nStreet, Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n\"Socialism,\" by Cathrein and Gettelman, a very scholarly and learned\r\nwork, admirably explains and refutes the various Marxian doctrines. It\r\nis published by Benziger Bros., New York City.\r\n\r\nA third book of recent publication, and of great value to the\r\nanti-Socialist student is \"The World Problem,\" by Rev. Joseph Husslein,\r\nS. J., published by The America Press, 175 East 83rd Street, New York,\r\nN. Y.\r\n\r\nOne who is truly interested in the fight against the national enemy\r\nshould not content himself with the reading of anti-Socialist\r\nliterature, but should pass the matter on to others who may become\r\ninterested in the battle against the enemies of our country.\r\n\r\nBusiness men and persons of wealth should not only urge their friends to\r\nread anti-Socialist works that have appealed to themselves, but should\r\nshow their patriotism and generosity by extensively purchasing\r\nanti-Socialist literature, whether in the form of books, pamphlets or\r\nleaflets, to be sent to public libraries, clubs, high schools, colleges\r\nand universities, and reading-rooms, and placed within easy reach of\r\ntheir employes and customers.\r\n\r\nThe workingmen of our country, to whom the Socialists are especially\r\nappealing, often fall an easy prey to the deceptive arguments of the\r\n\"Reds.\" Many of them do not weigh matters carefully and do not realize\r\nhow far the acceptance of radical doctrines may lead them. The men who\r\nstarted the Russian revolution did not know how far it would go. The\r\nparty of Lvoff and Miliukoff did not foresee Kerensky. The followers of\r\nKerensky did not foresee Lenine and Trotzky; and probably few of the\r\nfollowers of Lenine and Trotzky dreamed of the abyss of barbarism into\r\nwhich they in turn have plunged bleeding Russia. The Socialists of the\r\nUnited States use pamphlets and leaflets, much more than books, in\r\nappealing to workingmen. Books are more expensive and require more time\r\nto read. Leaflets are attractive, short, to the point, easily remembered\r\nand almost costless. Anti-Socialist leaflets, distributed by the\r\nmillions, would do untold good and would soon start a tremendous\r\nopposition among laborers to the Red Flag movement.\r\n\r\nSince the foreigners in our country, especially Russians, Italians and\r\nJews, take to Socialism very readily, something should be done to\r\nprotect them by native Americans who are especially able to do so.\r\nPatriotic persons and organizations should have immense numbers of\r\nanti-Socialist books, pamphlets and leaflets published in the different\r\nlanguages and distributed free of charge to foreigners who are not yet\r\nacquainted with English.\r\n\r\nSocialism has made terrible inroads among the Jews. To give one example,\r\n\"The Forward,\" a Yiddish daily of New York City, has a circulation of\r\nabout 150,000 copies. This paper should be watched very carefully by the\r\ngovernment, for it has been doing some very dangerous work in the line\r\nof revolutionary propaganda without English-speaking people being aware\r\nof the doctrines it is advocating.\r\n\r\nIn order to counteract Socialist propaganda among girls and boys, a\r\nsimple and limited knowledge of the evil plottings of the \"Reds\" ought\r\nto be imparted in all the grammar and high schools of our country. With\r\na view to this, text-books should be prepared. The boards of education\r\nin the different cities should see to it that anti-Socialist instruction\r\nbe given to the children.\r\n\r\nEditors who have a good understanding of the evil consequences of\r\nSocialism have a fine field rapidly opening up to them. Since the\r\nMarxian principles are spreading, there is a rapidly growing demand for\r\narticles to refute and combat them; yet many on the editorial staffs\r\nseem to have little definite knowledge concerning the teachings of the\r\nrevolutionists.\r\n\r\nAll patriotic citizens who understand Socialism and the tactics of the\r\n\"Knights of the Red Flag\" should expose them, violently attacking them\r\nin their conversations with others, so that it may no longer be said\r\nthat the revolutionaries are more zealous in trying to ruin our country\r\nand overthrow out government than loyal Americans are to save them.\r\n\r\nAttention should be paid to the men who are advocating Socialism in the\r\nmills, factories, shops, stores, mines, etc. A thorough exposure of\r\ntheir unsound doctrines will be prolific of much good. The ardor and\r\nzeal of the anti-Socialist should go still further, and the illogical\r\nrevolutionary orators should be driven from their soap boxes, not by\r\nviolence nor by physical force--for this would only give them another\r\nopportunity for complaining and enable them to win the support of\r\nsympathizers--but by arguments with them so effective as to compel them\r\nto step down and walk off in disgrace under the jeers of their\r\naudiences. In arguing with the visionaries, proofs for the truth of\r\ntheir statements should be demanded and the fact ought always to be\r\ninsisted upon that, even if they could show that the present system of\r\ngovernment and industry was corrupt and useless, it would in no way\r\nfollow from this that the Socialists' regime--however magnificently\r\npictured by an unbridled imagination--would provide a true remedy for\r\nany of the evils and abuses of our day.\r\n\r\nThe letters that Socialists send to the daily papers for publication, to\r\nfurther their cause, can, as a rule, easily be refuted. All that is\r\nrequired, in most instances, after a brief introduction of the question\r\nat issue, is to connect, by a few short sentences, several of the\r\ndamaging quotations that can be found, for example, in the present\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nMen who have talent for public speaking can make good use of their\r\neloquence in the warfare against our nation's foes by giving lectures\r\nand delivering speeches. Good writers should devote their talents to the\r\npreparation of books, pamphlets and leaflets against the revolutionists,\r\nand should furnish suitable articles for the newspapers and magazines.\r\nThe follies of Socialism also afford an abundance of suggestions for\r\ndramatists and cartoonists.\r\n\r\nSocialist school teachers and principals, because of the revolutionary\r\ndoctrines that they gradually instill into the minds of the young,\r\nshould be eliminated from the school-room. Students of colleges and\r\nuniversities, in which the Intercollegiate Socialist Society is\r\norganized, could give a noble example of patriotism and loyalty to our\r\ncountry by forming clubs to oppose the influence of the Socialist\r\nchapters and offset the great harm they are doing.\r\n\r\nPatriotic members of the American Federation of Labor should attend as\r\nmany of its meetings as possible in order to prevent the Marxians and\r\nradicals from gaining the upper hand in the organization, endorsing the\r\nSocialist Party, or adopting revolutionary principles of any kind.\r\n\r\nAs Socialist women are trying to destroy our Federal Government, the\r\nwomen who are opposed to Socialism should give ample proofs of their\r\nloyalty and devotion by taking an active part in the defense of their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAnti-Socialist clubs should be formed throughout the country to study\r\nSocialism and to devise means for combating the zealous propaganda\r\ncarried on by the thousands of Socialist locals and branches.\r\nInfluential members of the anti-Socialist clubs should see to it that\r\nthe public libraries were well stocked with anti-Socialist literature\r\nand that Socialist publications are kept only for legitimate purposes of\r\nreference.\r\n\r\nSeveral very important works of defence remain to be undertaken by our\r\nNational Government, if the conspirators are to be prevented from\r\ndestroying it. Socialism has already struck deep roots into the soil of\r\nAmerica. Consequently, the Government of the United States, in leaving\r\nto individuals the defence of the nation against the well organized\r\nforces of the revolutionists, is running a risk almost as great as if it\r\nwere to entrust the suppression of an armed insurrection to individual\r\naction. The Socialists availing themselves of every opportunity for\r\nspreading their propaganda among foreigners, have already gained many\r\nrecruits from the immigrant class. With this serious condition of\r\naffairs confronting it, the National Government should employ strenuous\r\nmeasures to break the grip that Socialism already has on the nation, and\r\nto prevent the immigrants who are landing on our shores from becoming a\r\nmenace.\r\n\r\nA law should be passed by Congress forbidding the publication or\r\ncirculation of any paper, magazine or book which advocates the unlawful\r\ndestruction of our present form of government. The officers of the army\r\nand navy should take precautions for preventing the spread of such\r\npublications among soldiers and sailors.\r\n\r\nSo far we have spoken only of the negative measures that the United\r\nStates Government should adopt for its defence. It remains to add a few\r\nwords concerning a positive campaign against the conspirators. If the\r\nGovernment neglects to stem the rising tide of Socialism it will not be\r\nlong before a disastrous insurrections[23] will be upon us. Millions of\r\ndollars a day would then be spent in defraying the expenses of what\r\nmight turn out to be an unsuccessful campaign. Congress should now\r\nappropriate the sums of money necessary to suppress the Marxian uprising\r\nand entirely uproot Socialism out of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe American people as a body will never tolerate Socialism, once they\r\nhave been made to realize its full meaning and ruinous consequences.\r\nThis knowledge could be brought home to them most effectively by means\r\nof anti-Socialist information issued periodically under the direction of\r\none of the departments of the Government and furnished to the press of\r\nthe country. Such material should also be distributed to all labor\r\norganizations and every public library in the country, and to clubs,\r\nsocieties, clergymen, legislators, judges, and men and women of\r\ninfluence. If such a plan were adopted, the forces arrayed in the line\r\nof battle against the Socialists would become tremendously strong and\r\nthe danger now seriously threatening our nation would presently\r\ndisappear. Surely the Government could afford to spend a few million\r\ndollars a year against revolutionists who are already undermining its\r\nvery foundations and whose activities, if unopposed, will bring upon us\r\nevils incomparably greater than those coming from a foreign foe.\r\n\r\nOrators attacking Socialism could be recruited by the Government to\r\nspeak all over the country for five or ten minutes at a time, after the\r\nfashion of the Four Minute Men.\r\n\r\nThose who have read this book have seen that the principles of the\r\nrevolutionists are logically unsound and would deluge the land we love\r\nwith rivers of blood and plunge us into an abyss of discontent, strife,\r\ncrime and chaos. It has been shown that the Socialist Party is an\r\norganization controlled by bosses and politicians with the avowed object\r\nof gaining votes by the most unscrupulous methods. Notwithstanding their\r\npretentions to honesty and sincerity, evidence has been cited time and\r\nagain of the deceitfulness of their propaganda, and of their plottings\r\nto overthrow our constitutional form of government, destroy religion and\r\nruin family life.\r\n\r\nWe, however, who sincerely love America, will never tear down the\r\nStar-Spangled Banner and in its place fling to the breezes the\r\nblood-stained flag of Karl Marx.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nAbsolutism in Russia, 281-2, 286, 290.\r\n\r\nAction, See Direct Action and Mass Action.\r\n\r\nA.

Of its 156 delegates, sixty were of foreign\r\nbirth. By some newspapers the Convention was incorrectly styled \"mild\"\r\nand \"conservative,\" so well were the avowed revolutionary designs of the\r\nSocialists camouflaged behind seemingly harmless innocuous phrases for\r\nthe deception of the uninformed. \"Vote-catching\" was the key-note of the\r\nproceedings. As this book shows, the Socialist Party in 1919 lost the\r\nvast majority of its members to the Communists and the Communist\r\nLaborites and had, therefore, to seek new members. These, however, could\r\nbe won only by concealing for the time being the true revolutionary\r\nobjects of the Socialist Party. This covering-up of its conspiracy\r\nagainst the United States, and the resultant gathering into the\r\nconspirators' net of the timid halfway Socialists as yet members of\r\nother political Parties, could be accomplished only by the lure of a\r\nConvention Platform so worded as to convince the unwary that the\r\nSocialists as a Party had discarded their ultra radicalism and blatant\r\nun-Americanism.\r\n\r\nThe Convention of May, 1920, therefore, was guided, under the adroit\r\nmanagement of Morris Hillquit and Victor L. Berger, toward a Platform\r\nworded more mildly and conservatively than might have been expected. No\r\nthinking person, however, Socialist or decent American, will be deceived\r\ninto believing that the beast of prey has changed its ugly spots because\r\na gauzy veil of lies has been thrown over them.\r\n\r\n\"The Red Conspiracy\" has proven that the Socialists in the United States\r\nhave been, almost to a man, in thorough accord with the principles and\r\nworkings of the blackest Bolshevism. They have consistently and\r\ncompletely supported the I. W. W. They are avowed foes of the American\r\nFederation of Labor, though willing enough to use this organization by\r\nsending traitors to join it and to bore their rat-holes of corruption\r\nfrom within its respectable membership. One of the delegates to the\r\nSocialist Convention of May, 1920, George Bauer, of New Jersey, said:\r\n\"We must remember that there are four or five million men in the A. F.\r\nof L., and I don't believe we can establish a co-operative commonwealth\r\nwithout them.\" The Convention, following this argument of expediency,\r\nadopted a resolution stating that the Socialist Party did not intend to\r\ninterfere with the internal affairs of labor unions; but added a\r\nstatement that the Party favored the organization of workers along the\r\nline of industrial unionism, acting as one organized working-class body.\r\nThe I. W. W. is, of course, the leading industrial union in America, and\r\nthe Convention's resolution set another seal to the sympathetic bond\r\nbetween Socialism and I. W. W.'ism, with the added encouragement of the\r\nSocialist Party's support of the less powerful industrial unions now\r\nwithin the American Federation of Labor.\r\n\r\nThe Camouflagists at the Convention politely declared that the Socialist\r\nParty did not seek to interfere with the institution of the family. But\r\nHilkovitz whitewash is not white enough to obscure the lurid red of the\r\nfree-love and race-suicide propaganda carried on in the Socialist press,\r\nHillquit's favorite sheet, \"The New York Call,\" being one of the chief\r\noffenders. A visit to the Rand School in New York City and examination\r\nof the books for sale on its book-store shelves and the periodicals and\r\npamphlets there for sale will present appalling and convincing evidence\r\nof the Socialist efforts to destroy elementary decency as well as the\r\ninstitutions of marriage and the family.\r\n\r\nAnother declaration of the Camouflagists at the Socialist Convention of\r\nMay, 1920, stated that the Socialist Party \"recognizes the right of\r\nvoluntary communities of citizens to maintain religious institutions and\r\nto worship freely according to the dictates of their conscience.\" As\r\nAugust Claessens warned the Convention: \"Cry out against that which men\r\ncherish as holy, and you rouse an antagonism which no argument can\r\ndefeat.\" This counsel of discretion is interesting side by side with\r\nanother Convention statement, made by William Karlin of New York: \"If\r\nthe churches do stand for the old order, it will be a bad day for them\r\nwhen the new order comes, because the churches will go down with the old\r\norder.\" Mr. Karlin, however, accepting discretion as valor's better\r\npart, admitted that \"There are many people to whom we can appeal if we\r\ndon't arouse their religious prejudice;\" while Delegate McIntyre, of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, prudently advised the members of the Convention to\r\n\"get the voters first and talk religion out of them afterward.\" Again,\r\na visit to the book-shop of the Rand School is suggested if proof is\r\ndesired of the Socialist propaganda of atheism, sacrilege, and,\r\nspecifically, hatred of Christianity. The reader of \"The Red Conspiracy\"\r\nwill have noted enough of the Socialists' blasphemies to prevent the\r\nConvention Camouflagists' hedging on this subject from having any effect\r\nbut added disgust at hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nThe Convention declared in favor of political action for the attainment\r\nof the Socialists' ends. Exactly! Chapter XVI of this book, \"The\r\nConspiracy Against Our Country,\" has shown for what purposes political\r\naction and political power are to be used. Get traitors in office and\r\nwhen the Revolution comes the forces to coerce the American people and\r\ndestroy the American Government will be in the traitors' control.\r\n\r\nCamouflagists[25] and their opponents of the Convention united in the\r\nnomination of Eugene V. Debs, convicted criminal, for President of the\r\nUnited States. Let us hear the words of this man whom Morris Hillquit\r\nstated resembles \"the Nazarene,\" and who styles himself \"a flaming\r\nrevolutionist.\" A press report, from Atlanta, Georgia, dated May 14,\r\n1920, quotes him as saying:\r\n\r\n     \"Personally I am a radical. I have always been one. My only fear\r\n     has always been that I might not be radical enough. In my own party\r\n     I always led the minority, but I hope to lead a united Socialist\r\n     Party to the polls this Fall. They are fighting within my own party\r\n     today. It is a good healthy sign. The radicals keep the\r\n     conservatives from giving away too much to popularize the movement.\r\n     That is what killed the Populist Party. The leaders sought to\r\n     popularize its political propaganda by pandering to more\r\n     conservative elements. They lost the radical support of their\r\n     party, which became the Socialist Party, and naturally the\r\n     conservatives had no further use for them. To begin to placate your\r\n     enemies is to invite decay.\"\r\n\r\nThe radical minority in the Socialist Party formerly comprised the Left\r\nWing members who later on became Communists and Communist Laborites. J.\r\nLouis Engdahl of Chicago at present leads a new Left Wing radical\r\nminority within the Party.\r\n\r\nThe American public may at times be gullible, but hardly sufficiently so\r\nas to believe in the sincerity of Hillquit and Victor L. Berger, who\r\nfilled the air at the Convention with phrases of moderation and disclaim\r\nof treason and revolution, following their gentle verbiage by nominating\r\nDebs who scores those who \"sought to popularize\" \"political propaganda\r\nby pandering to more conservative elements.\" \"Panderer\" is not a pretty\r\nthing to be called, but the pleasant Messrs. Hilkovitz and Berger\r\nswallow it. That their conservative phraseology would fool no one was\r\nrecognized at the Convention by Irwin St. John Tucker, who said: \"You\r\ncan disguise yourself by sprouting pink whiskers.\" Mr. Tucker, however,\r\nwould not join the Camouflagists, remarking: \"It may be that the\r\nAmerican people are not yet ready to accept Socialist principles, but I\r\nwould rather lose an election than lose those principles.\"\r\n\r\nHillquit himself said in the Convention, on May 13, 1920, that the\r\nnomination of Debs \"proves that we have not receded from our position of\r\nrevolutionary Socialism and that we will be more effective and still\r\nmore revolutionary than ever before.\"\r\n\r\nJ. Louis Engdahl may be an enemy to the United States and to society in\r\ngeneral, but he is man enough to say boldly what he really thinks. At\r\nthe Convention he declared: \"I say that it is time to inaugurate the\r\nrevolution immediately. The time to prepare for victory is now.... We\r\ncan't fool anybody here by decorating the walls with the flag of Wall\r\nSt.\"\r\n\r\nDelegate Oneal, one of Hillquit's own faction of political actionists,\r\nvolunteered to furnish a reason why camouflage was a useful policy for\r\nthe Socialists to adopt until \"The Day\" arrived,--the black day when the\r\nUnited States of America should be gasping in the throes of death-agony,\r\nlike wretched Russia. Oneal sapiently remarked at the Convention: \"The\r\ntime and conditions which favored the Russian revolution must be studied\r\nbefore we attempt to adopt them here.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Camouflagists of the Convention did not sever and did not wish\r\nto sever the close bond of union between the Socialist Party of the\r\nUnited States and the Third or Moscow International, the Convention, in\r\nits majority report, stating that \"The Moscow organization is virile and\r\naggressive, inspired as it is by the militant idealism of the Russian\r\nrevolution,\" the majority report further stating that the Socialist\r\nParty of the United States, \"retaining its adherence to the Third\r\nInternational,\" \"instructs its executive committee, its international\r\nsecretary and international delegates to be elected\" \"To participate in\r\nmovements looking to the union of all true Socialist forces in the world\r\ninto one International and to initiate and further such movements\r\nwhenever the opportunity is presented.\" The said majority report\r\nfollows, as reported in \"The New York Call,\" May 15, 1920:\r\n\r\n     \"The international organization of Socialism has been disrupted as\r\n     a result of the world war.\r\n\r\n     \"The old Second International is represented principally by the\r\n     majority party of Germany, the Socialist parties of the countries\r\n     carved out from the former Austro-Hungarian empire, and of most of\r\n     the countries of Europe that remained neutral during the war.\r\n\r\n     \"The parties affiliated with this organization have largely\r\n     abandoned the revolutionary character and the militant methods of\r\n     working class Socialism. As a rule, they co-operate with the middle\r\n     class reform parties of their countries.\r\n\r\n     \"The Third or Moscow International was organized by the Communist\r\n     party of Russia with the co-operation of several other Communist\r\n     organizations recruited in the main from the countries split off\r\n     from the former Russian empire and some Scandinavian and Balkan\r\n     countries. The Third International also includes the Labor party of\r\n     Norway and the Communist Labor party of Poland. Of the other\r\n     important countries, the Socialist parties of Switzerland, Italy\r\n     and the United States, and the British Socialist party have\r\n     expressed their intention to affiliate with it.\r\n\r\n     \"The Moscow organization is virile and aggressive, inspired as it\r\n     is by the militant idealism of the Russian revolution. It is,\r\n     however, at this time only a nucleus of a Socialist International,\r\n     and its progress is largely impeded by the attitude of its present\r\n     governing committee, which seems inclined to impose upon all\r\n     affiliated bodies the formula of the Russian revolution 'The\r\n     dictatorship of the proletariat in the form of Soviet power.'\r\n\r\n     \"The Independent Socialist party of Germany, the Socialist party of\r\n     France and the Independent Labor party of Great Britain are\r\n     unaffiliated. They have initiated a movement to unite all truly\r\n     Socialist parties of the world, including those represented in the\r\n     Moscow organization, into one International.\r\n\r\n     \"At no time was an active and effective organization of a Socialist\r\n     International more vitally necessary for the success of Socialism\r\n     than at this crucial period of the world's history. Socialism is in\r\n     complete control in the great country of Russia. It is represented\r\n     in the bourgeois governments of several important countries of\r\n     Europe. The Socialists constitute the leading opposition parties in\r\n     most of the remaining modern countries. It should be the task of\r\n     the Socialist International to aid our Comrades in Russia to\r\n     maintain and fortify their political control and to improve and\r\n     stabilize the economic and social conditions of their country by\r\n     forcing the great powers of Europe and America to abandon the\r\n     dastardly policy of intrigue, war and starvation blockade against\r\n     Soviet Russia. It should be its task to help the Socialists in\r\n     countries of divided political control to institute full and true\r\n     Socialist governments, and to support the struggles of the\r\n     Socialists in the capitalist-controlled countries, so that they may\r\n     more speedily secure victory for the workers in their countries.\r\n\r\n     \"But above all a true Socialist International would at this time\r\n     fulfill the all-important function of serving as the framework of\r\n     the coming world parliament.\r\n\r\n     \"To accomplish these great tasks the International of Socialism\r\n     must be truly international.\r\n\r\n     \"It cannot be truly Socialist if it is not based upon the program\r\n     of complete socialization of the industries, and upon the\r\n     principles of class struggle and uncompromising working class\r\n     politics. It cannot be truly international unless it accords to its\r\n     affiliated bodies full freedom in matters of policy and forms of\r\n     struggle on the basis of such program and principles, so that the\r\n     Socialists of each country may work out their problems in the light\r\n     of their own peculiar economic, political and social conditions as\r\n     well as the historic traditions.\r\n\r\n     \"In view of the above considerations the Socialist party of the\r\n     United States, while retaining its adherence to the Third\r\n     International, instructs its executive committee, its international\r\n     secretary and international delegates to be elected\r\n\r\n     \"(a) To insist that no formula such as 'the dictatorship of the\r\n     proletariat in the form of soviets' or any other formula for the\r\n     attainment of the Socialist commonwealth be imposed or exacted as\r\n     condition of affiliation with the Third International.\r\n\r\n     \"(b) To participate in movements looking to the union of all true\r\n     Socialist forces in the world into one International, and to\r\n     initiate and further such movements whenever the opportunity is\r\n     presented.\"\r\n\r\nThe brotherly sympathy between the Socialist Party of the United States\r\nand the Red Vandals of Soviet Russia is exhibited by the following, also\r\nfrom \"The New York Call,\" May 15, 1920, reporting the proceedings of the\r\nSocialist Convention in Finnish Hall:\r\n\r\n     \"A mission of three members was provided for to carry fraternal\r\n     greetings to Soviet Russia and to investigate and report on\r\n     conditions in the first working class republic, and the\r\n     international delegates were further instructed to get into\r\n     communication with Socialist organizations in North and South\r\n     America for the purpose of creating Socialist Pan-American\r\n     congresses.\"\r\n\r\nThe majority reporters, or discreet Camouflagists, despite the prudent\r\nefforts of careful Mr. Hillquit to separate the Socialist Party of the\r\nUnited States from the Communists and other out-in-the-open enemies of\r\nour Country, evidently believed it wise to throw out a beckoning hand to\r\nall radicals in general, especially to the Red Left Wing Socialists who\r\nleft the Party to become Communists and Communist Laborites in the fall\r\nof 1919. At the Convention of May, 1920, the following resolution was\r\nadopted:\r\n\r\n     \"Resolved, that we, the national convention of the Socialist party,\r\n     in order to carry into effect this desire for unity, make the\r\n     following proposals:\r\n\r\n     \"That any individual, branch, local or state or language federation\r\n     that left the party last fall because of tactical differences and\r\n     now desires to re-enter on the basis of the Socialist party\r\n     platform and constitution, be welcomed to return.\r\n\r\n     \"That where Socialist party locals and other groups of the labor\r\n     movement exist side by side in the same locality, we propose the\r\n     creation of joint campaign committees for the management of a\r\n     working class electoral campaign upon the basis of our platform.\r\n\r\n     \"That after the campaign is over, whenever the situation promises\r\n     practical results, steps be taken to confer with representatives of\r\n     other factions of the movement with a view to establishing possible\r\n     basis for organization unity.\r\n\r\n     \"That a national advisory council of all working class\r\n     organizations for the purpose of combatting the reactionary forces\r\n     be formed so that wherever possible there be voluntary united\r\n     action by all political and economic organizations who take their\r\n     stand on the basis of the class struggle.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a family fuss over a proposed clause, finally stricken out,\r\nthat \"due stamps or other evidence of membership in the groups formed by\r\nthe split in the party shall be recognized as evidence of good standing\"\r\nin the Socialist Party. In this connection, William Kruse of Illinois,\r\nwho is far from a Camouflagist, said: \"Debs believes that the Communist\r\nand Communist Labor members are as good Socialists as any.\" The\r\nauthorities of our Nation have condemned membership in the Communist\r\norganization as illegal and have proven Debs a criminal. The Socialists\r\nwelcome the Communists and Communist Laborites, \"whenever the situation\r\npromises practical results\" (when the time for \"shooting,\" for \"bullets\"\r\nrather than \"ballots,\" has arrived?), and the Socialists, Camouflagists\r\nas enthusiastically as their opponents, acclaim Debs the criminal, Debs\r\nthe convicted enemy of the United States of America, and nominate this\r\ncriminal enemy for President of the United States of America!\r\n\r\nThe entire record of the May, 1920, Socialist Convention is a series of\r\ninsincere, futile, clever attempts to whitewash the blood-red of the\r\nknown and proved Socialist principles and aims, these attempts in turn\r\ncombated by the more honest delegates, and the net result being the\r\nre-affirmation in tangible and important matters of these same menacing\r\nprinciples and aims, though set forth in wilier and more guarded\r\nlanguage than has been heretofore the case.\r\n\r\nThe Red Conspiracy has been proven, and every new move of the Socialists\r\nbut confirms, in the minds of sane and loyal Americans, the extent and\r\nperil of the conspiracy, and intensifies our will to combat this evil\r\nthing in our midst until righteous combat has fought to glorious\r\nvictory. Down with the Red Flag of Socialism, Communism, Bolshevism, I.\r\nW. W.'ism, and Anarchy! Victory and glory to the Stars and Stripes of\r\nour beloved Country!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[A] \"The Bolsheviks--formerly a faction within the Social-Democratic\r\nLabor Party--have recently changed their name to Communist party to\r\ndistinguish themselves from the other Social-Democratic groups.\r\n\r\n\"The term Bolsheviks and Mensheviks date back to 1903, when at a\r\ncongress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party a difference arose\r\non a seemingly unimportant question (editorial supervision of the party\r\norgan), when upon a vote which decided the question there naturally was\r\na majority and minority. Those who were with the majority were nicknamed\r\nBolsheviks and those with the minority Mensheviks, deriving their names\r\nfrom the Russian words Bolshinstvo and Menshinstvo, meaning majority and\r\nminority respectively.\" _\"The Soviets at Work,\" by Nicolai Lenin,\r\npublished, with foreword and footnotes by Alexander Trachtenberg, by the\r\nRand School of Social Science._\r\n\r\n[B] It is a notable fact that throughout his three days' testimony on\r\nthe witness stand at Albany, February 17, 18 and 19, 1920, in the case\r\nof the five suspended Socialist Assemblymen before the Judiciary\r\nCommittee of the New York Assembly, Morris Hillquit, illustrious leader\r\nof the Red Rebels' Whitewash Squad, tried to save the five suspended\r\nSocialist Assemblymen and the damaged reputation of their organization,\r\nthe Socialist Party of the United States, by tremendous applications of\r\nDebs' old recipe of quicklime and water, the special formula of which is\r\nto spell revolution and rifles without the \"r,\" pistols without the \"p\"\r\nand bombs without the \"b.\"\r\n\r\n[C] Engdahl was indicted at Chicago, February 2, 1918, as Editor of the\r\nSocialist Party's official publications, brought to trial before Judge\r\nLandis, December 9, 1918, and convicted on January 8, 1919. The four\r\nindicted, convicted and sentenced with him, each for twenty years, were\r\nVictor L. Berger, member of the Socialist Party's National Executive\r\nCommittee; Adolph Germer, the Party's National Executive Secretary;\r\nWilliam F. Kruse, Secretary of the Young People's Socialist League, and\r\nIrwin St. John Tucker, former head of the Party's Literature Department.\r\n\r\n[D] This reference to Left, Right and Center bears every earmark of\r\nfamiliarity with the use of these terms in the call to the Moscow\r\nConference.\r\n\r\n[E] Thus Hillquit seems to have had his eye on the \"call\" to the Moscow\r\nConference, although he swore on the stand at Albany, in February, 1920,\r\nthat he had not read the Moscow manifesto when he wrote 90 per cent. or\r\nmore of his Party's Chicago manifesto of September, 1919.\r\n\r\n[F] The reference is to Alexander Stoklitzky.\r\n\r\n[G] Article 3, Section 3 (a), of the \"National Convention and Platform\r\nof the Socialist Party, 1917,\" as officially published, reads: \"The call\r\nfor the regular election of members of the National Executive Committee\r\nshall be issued on the first day of January, 1918, and on January first\r\nof each odd numbered year thereafter. _Members elected in 1918 shall\r\nretire July first, 1919._\" But why should their own Constitution bother\r\nplotters who wish to dynamite that of the United States?\r\n\r\n[H] Gitlow was tried, convicted and sentenced in New York City early in\r\n1920, for inciting to anarchy.\r\n\r\n[I] The report brought back by this delegate, James Oneal, was the basis\r\nof the straddle resolution then adopted by a majority of the Executive\r\nCommittee, the text of which we have given near the close of Chapter II.\r\n\r\n[J] As we have seen, the testimony of Morris Hillquit, February 19,\r\n1920, at the trial of the five Assemblymen at Albany, was, \"At least\r\nninety per cent. of the manifesto is my authorship.\"\r\n\r\n[K] See Chapter V of this book for an account of Referendum D, carried\r\nby a large majority in the spring or summer of 1919, by which the rank\r\nand file of the Socialist Party opposed its entrance into any\r\ninternational Socialist alignment except that of the Third (Moscow)\r\nInternational.\r\n\r\n[L] In its article on \"The Russian Soviet Government Bureau in the\r\nUnited States\" Trachtenberg's Labor Year Book, 1919-1920, pages 384-5,\r\nsays: \"The Legal Department, under the supervision of Morris Hillquit,\r\nadvises the Bureau so that its actions may at all times conform to the\r\nlaws of the United States.... The raid upon the Soviet Bureau by local\r\nauthorities engaged the attention of the Legal Department.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, the \"Albany Argus\" of February 19, 1920, describing Hillquit's\r\ntestimony in the Socialist case on the preceding day, February 18, says:\r\n\"It was brought out in cross-examination that Mr. Hillquit had acted as\r\ncounsel for the Russian Soviet Bureau in this country.... The witness\r\ntestified that he had advised Ludwig C. A. K. Martens to file his\r\ncredentials with the Secretary of State; had aided him in the\r\npreparation of his statement and advised him generally in the\r\norganization of his office and in every effort undertaken by him for the\r\nestablishment of trade connection with the United States.\"\r\n\r\n[M] Those willing to co-operate with the Committee should communicate\r\nwith its Chairman, Mr. Frank Allaben, President of The National\r\nHistorical Society, publishers of this book, 37 West 39th street, New\r\nYork City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Changed \"Bolshevissm\" to \"Bolshevism\".\r\n\r\n[2] Changed \"Bolhevist\" to \"Bolshevist\".\r\n\r\n[3] Changed \"Forence\" to \"Florence\".\r\n\r\n[4] Changed \"circulaton\" to \"circulation\".\r\n\r\n[5] Changed \"constitutent\" to \"constituent\".\r\n\r\n[6] Changed \"form\" to \"from\".\r\n\r\n[7] Changed \"Ukrainains\" to \"Ukrainians\".\r\n\r\n[8] Changed \"renumeration\" to \"remuneration\".\r\n\r\n[9] Changed \"Procedings\" to \"Proceedings\".\r\n\r\n[10] Changed \"chidren\" to \"children\".\r\n\r\n[11] Changed \"futhermore\" to \"furthermore\".\r\n\r\n[12] Changed \"inauguarate\" to \"inaugurate\".\r\n\r\n[13] Changed \"Knickerobcker\" to \"Knickerbocker\".\r\n\r\n[14] Changed \"prevalance\" to \"prevalence\".\r\n\r\n[15] Changed \"Englisn\" to \"English\".\r\n\r\n[16] Changed \"neutriality\" to \"neutrality\".\r\n\r\n[17] Changed \"Interpretaion\" to \"Interpretation\".\r\n\r\n[18] Changed \"superstitution\" to \"superstition\".\r\n\r\n[19] Changed \"Pary\" to \"Party\".\r\n\r\n[20] Changed \"nowithstanding\" to \"notwithstanding\".\r\n\r\n[21] Changed \"camparatively\" to \"comparatively\".\r\n\r\n[22] Changed \"dailes\" to \"dailies\".\r\n\r\n[23] Changed \"insurrections\" to \"insurrection\".\r\n\r\n[24] Changed \"alied\" to \"allied\".\r\n\r\n[25] Changed \"Canouflagists\" to \"Camouflagists\".",
