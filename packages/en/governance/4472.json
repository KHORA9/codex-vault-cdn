SUITORS FOR THE HAND OF NESTA VICTORIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTREATS OF THE DUMBNESS POSSIBLE WITH MEMBERS OF A HOUSEHOLD HAVING ONE\r\nHEART\r\n\r\nTwo that live together in union are supposed to be intimate on every\r\nleaf.  Particularly when they love one another and the cause they have\r\nat heart is common to them in equal measure, the uses of a cordial\r\nfamiliarity forbid reserves upon important matters between them, as we\r\nthink; not thinking of an imposed secretiveness, beneath the false\r\nexternal of submissiveness, which comes of an experience of repeated\r\ninefficiency to maintain a case in opposition, on the part of the\r\nloquently weaker of the pair.  In Constitutional Kingdoms a powerful\r\nGovernment needs not to be tyrannical to lean oppressively; it is more\r\nserviceable to party than agreeable to country; and where the alliance\r\nof men and women binds a loving couple, of whom one is a torrent of\r\npersuasion, their differings are likely to make the other resemble a log\r\nof the torrent.  It is borne along; it dreams of a distant corner of the\r\nway for a determined stand; it consents to its whirling in anticipation\r\nof an undated hour when it will no longer be neutral.\r\n\r\nThere may be, moreover, while each has the key of the fellow breast,\r\na mutually sensitive nerve to protest against intrusion of light or\r\nsound.  The cloud over the name of their girl could now strike Nataly and\r\nVictor dumb in their taking of counsel.  She divined that his hint had\r\nencouraged him to bring the crisis nearer, and he that her comprehension\r\nhad become tremblingly awake.  They shrank, each of them, the more from\r\nan end drawing closely into view.  All subjects glooming off or darkening\r\nup to it were shunned by them verbally, and if they found themselves\r\nentering beneath that shadow, conversation passed to an involuntary\r\ngesture, more explicit with him, significant of the prohibited, though\r\nnot acknowledging it.\r\n\r\nAll the stronger was it Victor's purpose, leaping in his fashion to the\r\ncover of action as an escape from perplexity, to burn and scheme for the\r\nwedding of their girl--the safe wedding of that dearest, to have her\r\nprotected, secure, with the world warm about her.  And he well knew why\r\nhis Nataly had her look of a closed vault (threatening, if opened, to\r\nthunder upon Life) when he dropped his further hints.  He chose to call\r\nit feminine inconsistency, in a woman who walked abroad with a basket of\r\nmarriage-ties for the market on her arm.  He knew that she would soon\r\nhave to speak the dark words to their girl; and the idea of any doing of\r\nit, caught at his throat.  Reasonably she dreaded the mother's task;\r\npardonably indeed.  But it is for the mother to do, with a girl.\r\nHe deputed it lightly to the mother because he could see himself stating\r\nthe facts to a son.  'And, my dear boy, you will from this day draw your\r\nfive thousand a year, and we double it on the day of your marriage,\r\nliving at Lakelands or where you will.'\r\n\r\nHis desire for his girl's protection by the name of one of our great\r\nFamilies, urged him to bind Nataly to the fact, with the argument, that\r\nit was preferable for the girl to hear their story during her green early\r\nyouth, while she reposed her beautiful blind faith in the discretion of\r\nher parents, and as an immediate step to the placing of her hand in a\r\nhusband's.  He feared that her mother required schooling to tell the\r\nstory vindicatingly and proudly, in a manner to distinguish instead of\r\ndegrading or temporarily seeming to accept degradation.\r\n\r\nThe world would weigh on her confession of the weight of the world on her\r\nchild; she would want inciting and strengthening, if one judged of her\r\ncapacity to meet the trial by her recent bearing; and how was he to do\r\nit!  He could not imagine himself encountering the startled, tremulous,\r\nnascent intelligence in those pure brown darklashed eyes of Nesta; he\r\npitied the poor mother.  Fancifully directing her to say this and that to\r\nthe girl, his tongue ran till it was cut from his heart and left to wag\r\ndead colourless words.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of a similar business of exposition, certainly devolving\r\nupon the father in treaty with the fortunate youth, gripped at his vitals\r\na minute, so intense was his pride in appearing woundless and scarless,\r\na shining surface, like pure health's, in the sight of men.  Nevertheless\r\nhe skimmed the story, much as a lecturer strikes his wand on the\r\nprominent places of a map, that is to show us how he arrived at the\r\nprincipal point, which we are all agreed to find chiefly interesting.\r\nThis with Victor was the naming of Nesta's bridal endowment.  He rushed\r\nto it.  'My girl will have ten thousand a year settled on her the day of\r\nher marriage.'  Choice of living at Lakelands was offered.\r\n\r\nIt helped him over the unpleasant part of that interview.  At the same\r\ntime, it moved him to a curious contempt of the youth.  He had to\r\nconjure-up an image of the young man in person, to correct the\r\nsentiment:--and it remained as a kind of bruise only half cured.\r\n\r\nMr. Dudley Sowerby was not one of the youths whose presence would rectify\r\nsuch an abstract estimate of the genus pursuer.  He now came frequently\r\nof an evening, to practise a duet for flutes with Victor;--a Mercadante,\r\nhoneyed and flowing; too honeyed to suit a style that, as Fenellan\r\ncharacterized it to Nataly, went through the music somewhat like an\r\ninquisitive tourist in a foreign town, conscientious to get to the end of\r\nthe work of pleasure; until the notes had become familiar, when it rather\r\nresembled a constable's walk along the midnight streets into collision\r\nwith a garlanded roysterer; and the man of order and the man of passion,\r\ntrue to the measure though they were, seeming to dissent, almost to\r\nwrangle, in their different ways of winding out the melody, on to the\r\nlast movement; which was plainly a question between home to the strayed\r\nreveller's quarters or off to the lockup.  Victor was altogether the\r\nyounger of the two.  But his vehement accompaniment was a tutorship;\r\nMr. Sowerby improved; it was admitted by Nesta and mademoiselle that\r\nhe gained a show of feeling; he had learnt that feeling was wanted.\r\nPassion, he had not a notion of: otherwise he would not be delaying;\r\nthe interview, dramatized by the father of the young bud of womanhood,\r\nwould be taking place, and the entry into Lakelands calculable, for\r\nNataly's comfort, as under the aegis of the Cantor earldom.  Gossip flies\r\nto a wider circle round the members of a great titled family, is\r\ninaudible; or no longer the diptherian whisper the commonalty hear of the\r\ncommonalty: and so we see the social uses of our aristocracy survive.  We\r\ndo not want the shield of any family; it is the situation that wants it;\r\nNataly ought to be awake to the fact.  One blow and we have silenced our\r\nenemy: Nesta's wedding-day has relieved her parents.\r\n\r\nVictor's thoughts upon the instrument for striking that, blow, led him to\r\nsuppose Mr. Sowerby might be meditating on the extent of the young lady's\r\nfortune.  He talked randomly of money, in a way to shatter Nataly's\r\nconception of him.  He talked of City affairs at table, as it had been\r\nhis practice to shun the doing; and hit the resounding note on mines,\r\nwhich have risen in the market like the crest of a serpent, casting a\r\ncertain spell upon the mercantile understanding.  'Fredi's diamonds from\r\nher own mine, or what once was--and she still reserves a share,' were to\r\nbe shown to Mr. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nNataly respected the young fellow for not displaying avidity at the\r\nflourish of the bait, however it might be affecting him; and she fancied\r\nthat he did laboriously, in his way earnestly, study her girl, to sound\r\nfor harmony between them, previous to a wooing.  She was a closer reader\r\nof social character than Victor; from refraining to run on the broad\r\nlines which are but faintly illustrative of the individual one in being\r\ncommon to all--unless we have hit by chance on an example of the\r\ndownright in roguery or folly or simple goodness.  Mr. Sowerby'g bearing\r\nto Nesta was hardly warmed by the glitter of diamonds.  His next visit\r\nshowed him livelier in courtliness, brighter, fresher; but that was\r\nalways his way at the commencement of every visit, as if his reflections\r\non the foregone had come to a satisfactory conclusion; and the labours of\r\nthe new study of the maiden ensued again in due course to deaden him.\r\n\r\nGentleman he was.  In the recognition of his quality as a man of\r\nprinciple and breeding, Nataly was condemned by thoughts of Nesta's\r\nfuture to question whether word or act of hers should, if inclination on\r\nboth sides existed, stand between her girl and a true gentleman.  She\r\ncounselled herself, as if the counsel were in requisition, to be passive;\r\nand so doing, she more acutely than Victor--save in his chance flashes--\r\ndiscerned the twist of her very nature caused by their false position.\r\nAnd her panacea for ills, the lost little cottage, would not have averted\r\nit: she would there have had the same coveting desire to name a man of\r\nbreeding, honour, station, for Nesta's husband.  Perhaps in the cottage,\r\nchoosing at leisure, her consent to see the brilliant young creature tied\r\nto the best of dull men would have been unready, without the girl to push\r\nit.  For the Hon. Dudley was lamentably her pupil in liveliness; he took\r\nthe second part, as it is painful for a woman with the old-fashioned\r\nideas upon the leading of the sexes to behold; resembling in his look the\r\ndeaf, who constantly require to have an observation repeated; resembling\r\nthe most intelligent of animals, which we do not name, and we reprove\r\nourselves for seeing likeness.\r\n\r\nYet the likeness or apparent likeness would suggest that we have not so\r\nmuch to fear upon the day of the explanation to him.  Some gain is there.\r\nShameful thought!  Nataly hastened her mind to gather many instances or\r\nindications testifying to the sterling substance in young Mr. Sowerby,\r\nsuch as a mother would pray for her son-in-law to possess.  She\r\ndiscovered herself feeling as the burdened mother, not providently for\r\nher girl, in the choice of a mate.  The perception was clear, and not the\r\nless did she continue working at the embroidery of Mr. Sowerby on the\r\nbasis of his excellent moral foundations, all the while hoping, praying,\r\nthat he might not be lured on to the proposal for Nesta.  But her\r\nsubservience to the power of the persuasive will in Victor--which was\r\nlike the rush of a conflagration--compelled her to think realizingly of\r\nany scheme he allowed her darkly to read.\r\n\r\nOpposition to him, was comparable to the stand of blocks of timber before\r\nflame.  Colney Durance had done her the mischief we take from the\r\npessimist when we are overweighted: in darkening the vision of external\r\naid from man or circumstance to one who felt herself mastered.  Victor\r\ncould make her treacherous to her wishes, in revolt against them, though\r\nthe heart protested.  His first conquest of her was in her blood, to\r\nweaken a spirit of resistance.  For the precedent of submission is a\r\ncharm upon the faint-hearted through love: it unwinds, unwills them.\r\nNataly resolved fixedly, that there must be a day for speaking; and she\r\nhad her moral sustainment in the resolve; she had also a tormenting\r\nconsciousness of material support in the thought, that the day was not\r\npresent, was possibly distant, might never arrive.  Would Victor's\r\nrelease come sooner?  And that was a prospect bearing resemblance to\r\nhopes of the cure of a malady through a sharp operation.\r\n\r\nThese were matters going on behind the curtain; as wholly vital to her,\r\nand with him at times almost as dominant, as the spiritual in memory,\r\nwhen flesh has left but its shining track in dust of a soul outwritten;\r\nand all their talk related to the purchase of furniture, the expeditions\r\nto Lakelands, music, public affairs, the pardonable foibles of friends\r\ncreated to amuse their fellows, operatic heroes and heroines, exhibitions\r\nof pictures, the sorrows of Crowned Heads, so serviceable ever to mankind\r\nas an admonition to the ambitious, a salve to the envious!--in fine,\r\nwhatsoever can entertain or affect the most social of couples,\r\ndomestically without a care to appearance.  And so far they partially--\r\ndramatically--deceived themselves by imposing on the world while they\r\ntalked and duetted; for the purchase of furniture from a flowing purse\r\nis a cheerful occupation; also a City issuing out of hospital, like this\r\npoor City of London, inspires good citizens to healthy activity.  But the\r\nsilence upon what they were most bent on, had the sinister effect upon\r\nVictor, of obscuring his mental hold of the beloved woman, drifting her\r\naway from him.  In communicating Fenellan's news through the lawyer\r\nCarling of Mrs. Burman's intentions, he was aware that there was an\r\nobstacle to his being huggingly genial, even candidly genial with her,\r\nuntil he could deal out further news, corroborative and consecutive,\r\nto show the action of things as progressive.  Fenellan had sunk into his\r\nusual apathy:--and might plead the impossibility of his moving faster\r\nthan the woman professing to transform herself into, beneficence out of\r\nmalignity;--one could hear him saying the words!  Victor had not seen him\r\nsince last Concert evening, and he deemed it as well to hear the words\r\nFenellan's mouth had to say.  He called at an early hour of the Westward\r\ntidal flow at the Insurance Office looking over the stormy square of the\r\nfirst of Seamen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE LATEST OF MRS. BURMAN\r\n\r\nAfter cursory remarks about the business of the Office and his friend's\r\ncontributions to periodical literature, in which he was interested for as\r\nlong as he had assurance that the safe income depending upon official\r\nduties was not endangered by them, Victor kicked his heels to and fro.\r\nFenellan waited for him to lead.\r\n\r\n'Have you seen that man, her lawyer, again?'\r\n\r\n'I have dined with Mr. Carling:--capital claret.'\r\n\r\nEmptiness was in the reply.\r\n\r\nVictor curbed himself and said: 'By the way, you're not likely to have\r\ndealings with Blathenoy.  The fellow has a screw to the back of a shifty\r\neye; I see it at work to fix the look for business.  I shall sit on the\r\nBoard of my Bank.  One hears things.  He lives in style at Wrensham.  By\r\nthe way, Fredi has little Mab Mountney from Creckholt staying with her.\r\nYou said of little Mabsy--\"Here she comes into the room all pink and\r\nwhite, like a daisy.\"  She's the daisy still; reminds us of our girl at\r\nthat age.--So, then, we come to another dead block!'\r\n\r\n'Well, no; it's a chemist's shop, if that helps us on,' said Fenellan,\r\nsettling to a new posture in his chair.  'She's there of an afternoon for\r\nhours.'\r\n\r\n'You mean it's she?'\r\n\r\n'The lady.  I 'll tell you.  I have it from Carling, worthy man; and\r\nlawyers can be brought to untruss a point over a cup of claret.  He's a\r\nbit of a \"Mackenzie Man,\" as old aunts of mine used to say at home--a Man\r\nof Feeling.  Thinks he knows the world, from having sifted and sorted a\r\nlot of our dustbins; as the modern Realists imagine it's an exposition of\r\npositive human nature when they've pulled down our noses to the worst\r\nparts--if there's a worse where all are useful: but the Realism of the\r\ndogs is to have us by the nose:--excite it and befoul it, and you're\r\nfearfully credible!  You don't read that olfactory literature.  However,\r\nfriend Carling is a conciliatory carle.  Three or four days of the week\r\nthe lady, he says, drives to her chemist's, and there she sits in the\r\nshop; round the corner, as you enter; and sees all Charing in the shop\r\nlooking-glass at the back; herself a stranger spectacle, poor lady, if\r\nCarling's picture of her is not overdone; with her fashionable no-bonnet\r\nstriding the contribution chignon on the crown, and a huge square green\r\nshade over her forehead.  Sits hours long, and cocks her ears at orders\r\nof applicants for drugs across the counter, and sometimes catches wind\r\nof a prescription, and consults her chemist, and thinks she 'll try it\r\nherself.  It's a basket of medicine bottles driven to Regent's Park\r\npretty well every day.'\r\n\r\n'Ha! Regent's Park!' exclaimed Victor, and shook at recollections of the\r\ndistrict and the number of the house, dismal to him.  London buried the\r\nwoman deep until a mention of her sent her flaring over London.  'A\r\nchemist's shop!  She sits there?'\r\n\r\n'Mrs. Burman.  We pass by the shop.'\r\n\r\n'She had always a turn for drugs.--Not far from here, did you say?  And\r\nevery day! under a green shade?'\r\n\r\n'Dear fellow, don't be suggesting ballads; we'll go now,' said Fenellan.\r\n'It 's true it's like sitting on the banks of the Stygian waters.'\r\n\r\nHe spied at an obsequious watch, that told him it was time to quit the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n'You've done nothing?' Victor asked in a tone of no expectation.\r\n\r\n'Only to hear that her latest medical man is Themison.'\r\n\r\n'Where did you hear?'\r\n\r\n'Across the counter of Boyle and Luckwort, the lady's chemists.  I called\r\nthe day before yesterday, after you were here at our last Board Meeting.'\r\n\r\n'The Themison?'\r\n\r\n'The great Dr. Themison; who kills you kindlier than most, and is much in\r\nrequest for it.'\r\n\r\n'There's one of your echoes of Colney!' Victor cried.  'One gets dead\r\nsick of that worn-out old jibeing at doctors.  They don't kill, you know\r\nvery well.  It 's not to their interest to kill.  They may take the\r\nrelish out of life; and upon my word, I believe that helps to keep the\r\npatient living!'\r\n\r\nFenellan sent an eye of discreet comic penetration travelling through his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n'The City's mending; it's not the weary widow woman of the day when we\r\ncapsized the diurnal with your royal Old Veuve,' he said, as they trod\r\nthe pavement.  'Funny people, the English!  They give you all the\r\nprimeing possible for amusement and jollity, and devil a sentry-box for\r\nthe exercise of it; and if you shake a leg publicly, partner or not,\r\nyou're marched off to penitence.  I complain, that they have no\r\nphilosophical appreciation of human nature.'\r\n\r\n'We pass the shop?' Victor interrupted him.\r\n\r\n'You're in view of it in a minute.  And what a square, for recreative\r\ndancing!  And what a people, to be turning it into a place of political\r\nagitation!  And what a country, where from morning to night it's an\r\nendless wrangle about the first conditions of existence!  Old Colney\r\nseems right now and then: they 're the offspring of pirates, and they 've\r\ngot the manners and tastes of their progenitors, and the trick of\r\nquarrelling everlastingly over the booty.  I 'd have band-music here for\r\na couple of hours, three days of the week at the least; and down in the\r\nEast; and that forsaken North quarter of London; and the Baptist South\r\ntoo.  But just as those omnibus-wheels are the miserable music of this\r\nLondon of ours, it 's only too sadly true that the people are in the\r\nfirst rumble of the notion of the proper way to spend their lives.  Now\r\nyou see the shop: Boyle and Luckwort: there.'\r\n\r\nVictor looked.  He threw his coat open, and pulled the waistcoat, and\r\nswelled it, ahemming.  'That shop?' said he.  And presently: 'Fenellan,\r\nI'm not superstitious, I think.  Now listen; I declare to you, on the day\r\nof our drinking Old Veuve together last--you remember it,--I walked home\r\nup this way across the square, and I was about to step into that\r\nidentical shop, for some household prescription in my pocket, having\r\nforgotten Nataly's favourite City chemists Fenbird and Jay, when--I'm\r\nstating a fact--I distinctly--I 'm sure of the shop--felt myself plucked\r\nback by the elbow; pulled back the kind of pull when you have to put a\r\nfoot backward to keep your equilibrium.'\r\n\r\nSo does memory inspired by the sensations contribute an additional item\r\nfor the colouring of history.\r\n\r\nHe touched the elbow, showed a flitting face of crazed amazement in\r\namusement, and shrugged and half-laughed, dismissing the incident, as\r\nbeing perhaps, if his hearer chose to have it so, a gem of the rubbish\r\ntumbled into the dustcart out of a rather exceptional householder's\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nFenellan smiled indulgently.  'Queer things happen.  I recollect reading\r\nin my green youth of a clergyman, who mounted a pulpit of the port where\r\nhe was landed after his almost solitary rescue from a burning ship at\r\nmidnight in mid-sea, to inform his congregation, that he had overnight of\r\nthe catastrophe a personal Warning right in his ear from a Voice, when at\r\nhis bed or bunk-side, about to perform the beautiful ceremony of\r\nundressing: and the Rev. gentleman was to lie down in his full uniform,\r\nnot so much as to relieve himself of his boots, the Voice insisted twice;\r\nand he obeyed it, despite the discomfort to his poor feet; and he jumped\r\nup in his boots to the cry of Fire, and he got them providentially over\r\nthe scuffling deck straight at the first rush into the boat awaiting\r\nthem, and had them safe on and polished the day he preached the sermon of\r\ngratitude for the special deliverance.  There was a Warning!  and it\r\nmight well be called, as he called it, from within.  We're cared for,\r\nnever doubt.  Aide-toi.  Be ready dressed to help yourself in a calamity,\r\nor you'll not stand in boots at your next Sermon, contrasting with the\r\nburnt.  That sounds like the moral.'\r\n\r\n'She could have seen me,' Victor threw out an irritable suggestion.  The\r\nidea of the recent propinquity set hatred in motion.\r\n\r\n'Scarcely likely.  I'm told she sits looking on her lap, under the\r\nbeetling shade, until she hears an order for tinctures or powders, or a\r\nmixture that strikes her fancy.  It's possible to do more suicidal things\r\nthan sit the afternoons in a chemist's shop and see poor creatures get\r\ntheir different passports to Orcus.'\r\n\r\nVictor stepped mutely beneath the windows of the bellied glass-urns of\r\nchemical wash.  The woman might be inside there now!  She might have seen\r\nhis figure in the shop-mirror!  And she there!  The wonder of it all\r\nseemed to be, that his private history was not walking the streets.\r\nThe thinness of the partition concealing it, hardly guaranteed a day's\r\nimmunity: because this woman would live in London, in order to have her\r\nchoice of a central chemist's shop, where she could feed a ghastly\r\nimagination on the various recipes .  .  .  and while it would have been\r\nso much healthier for her to be living in a recess of the country!\r\n\r\nHe muttered: 'Diseases--drugs!'\r\n\r\nThose were the corresponding two strokes of the pendulum which kept the\r\nwoman going.\r\n\r\n'And deadly spite.'  That was the emanation of the monotonous horrible\r\nconflict, for which, and by which, the woman lived.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of the shop, he could not but think of her through\r\nthe feelings of a man scorched by a furnace.\r\n\r\nA little further on, he said: 'Poor soul!' He confessed to himself, that\r\nlatterly he had, he knew not why, been impatient with her, rancorous in\r\nthought, as never before.  He had hitherto aimed at a picturesque\r\ntolerance of her vindictiveness; under suffering, both at Craye and\r\nCreckholt; and he had been really forgiving.  He accused her of dragging\r\nhim down to humanity's lowest.\r\n\r\nBut if she did that, it argued the possession of a power of a sort.\r\n\r\nHer station in the chemist's shop he passed almost daily, appeared to him\r\nas a sudden and a terrific rush to the front; though it was only a short\r\ndrive from the house in Regent's Park; but having shaken-off that house,\r\nhe had pushed it back into mists, obliterated it.  The woman certainly\r\nhad a power.\r\n\r\nHe shot away to the power he knew of in himself; his capacity for winning\r\nmen in bodies, the host of them, when it came to an effort of his\r\nenergies: men and, individually, women.  Individually, the women were to\r\nbe counted on as well; warm supporters.\r\n\r\nIt was the admission of a doubt that he might expect to enroll them\r\ncollectively.  Eyeing the men, he felt his command of them.  Glancing at\r\ncongregated women, he had a chill.  The Wives and Spinsters in ghostly\r\njudicial assembly: that is, the phantom of the offended collective woman:\r\nthat is, the regnant Queen Idea issuing from our concourse of civilized\r\nlife to govern Society, and pronounce on the orderly, the tolerable, the\r\nlegal, and banish the rebellious: these maintained an aspect of the stand\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nDid Nataly read the case: namely, that the crowned collective woman is\r\nnot to be subdued?  And what are we to say of the indefinite but forcible\r\nAuthority, when we see it upholding Mrs. Burman to crush a woman like\r\nNataly!\r\n\r\nVictor's novel exercises in reflection were bringing him by hard degrees\r\nto conceive it to be the impalpable which has prevailing weight.  Not\r\nmany of our conquerors have scored their victories on the road of that\r\nindex: nor has duration been granted them to behold the minute measure of\r\nvalue left even tangible after the dust of the conquest subsides.  The\r\npassing by a shop where a broken old woman might be supposed to sit\r\nbeneath her green forehead-shade--Venetian-blind of a henbane-visage!--\r\nhad precipitated him into his first real grasp of the abstract verity:\r\nand it opens on to new realms, which are a new world to the practical\r\nmind.  But he made no advance.  He stopped in a fever of sensibility,\r\nto contemplate the powerful formless vapour rolling from a source that\r\nwas nothing other than yonder weak lonely woman.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the human nature of the man was dragged to the school of\r\nits truancy by circumstances, for him to learn the commonest of sums done\r\non a slate, in regard to payment of debts and the unrelaxing grip of the\r\ncreditor on the defaulter.  Debtors are always paying like those who are\r\nguilty of the easiest thing in life, the violation of Truth, they have\r\nmade themselves bondmen to pay, if not in substance, then in soul; and\r\nthe nipping of the soul goes on for as long as the concrete burden is\r\nundischarged.  You know the Liar; you must have seen him diminishing,\r\nuntil he has become a face without features, withdrawn to humanity's\r\npreliminary sketch (some half-dozen frayed threads of woeful outline on\r\nour original tapestry-web); and he who did the easiest of things, he must\r\nfrom such time sweat in being the prodigy of inventive nimbleness, up to\r\nthe day when he propitiates Truth by telling it again.  There is a\r\nrepentance that does reconstitute!  It may help to the traceing to\r\nsprings of a fable whereby men have been guided thus far out of the wood.\r\n\r\nVictor would have said truly that he loved Truth; that he paid every debt\r\nwith a scrupulous exactitude: money, of course; and prompt apologies for\r\na short brush of his temper.  Nay, he had such a conscience for the\r\nsmallest eruptions of a transient irritability, that the wish to say a\r\nfriendly mending word to the Punctilio donkey of London Bridge, softened\r\nhis retrospective view of the fall there, more than once.  Although this\r\nman was a presentation to mankind of the force in Nature which drives to\r\nunresting speed, which is the vitality of the heart seen at its beating\r\nafter a plucking of it from the body, he knew himself for the reverse of\r\nlawless; he inclined altogether to good citizenship.  So social a man\r\ncould not otherwise incline.  But when it came to the examination of\r\naccounts between Mrs. Burman and himself, spasms of physical revulsion,\r\nloathings, his excessive human nature, put her out of Court.  To men,\r\nit was impossible for him to speak the torments of those days of the\r\nmonstrous alliance.  The heavens were cognizant.  He pleaded his case\r\nin their accustomed hearing:--a youngster tempted by wealth, attracted,\r\nbesought, snared, revolted, etc.  And Mrs. Burman, when roused to\r\njealousy, had shown it by teazing him for a confession of his admiration\r\nof splendid points in the beautiful Nataly, the priceless fair woman\r\nliving under their roof, a contrast of very life, with the corpse and\r\nshroud; and she seen by him daily, singing with him, her breath about\r\nhim, her voice incessantly upon every chord of his being!\r\n\r\nHe pleaded successfully.  But the silence following the verdict was\r\nheavy; the silence contained an unheard thunder.  It was the sound, as\r\nwhen out of Court the public is dissatisfied with a verdict.  Are we\r\nexpected to commit a social outrage in exposing our whole case to the\r\npublic?--Imagine it for a moment as done.  Men are ours at a word--or at\r\nleast a word of invitation.  Women we woo; fluent smooth versions of our\r\ntortures, mixed with permissible courtship, win the individual woman.\r\nAnd that unreasoning collective woman, icy, deadly, condemns the poor\r\nracked wretch who so much as remembers them!  She is the enemy of\r\nNature.--Tell us how?  She is the slave of existing conventions.--\r\nAnd from what cause?  She is the artificial production of a state that\r\nexalts her so long as she sacrifices daily and hourly to the artificial.\r\n\r\nTherefore she sides with Mrs. Burman--the foe of Nature: who, with her\r\narts and gold lures, has now possession of the Law (the brass idol\r\nworshipped by the collective) to drive Nature into desolation.\r\n\r\nHe placed himself to the right of Mrs. Burman, for the world to behold\r\nthe couple: and he lent the world a sigh of disgust.\r\n\r\nWhat he could not do, as in other matters he did, was to rise above the\r\nsituation, in a splendid survey and rapid view of the means of reversing\r\nit.  He was too social to be a captain of the socially insurgent;\r\nimagination expired.\r\n\r\nBut having a courageous Nataly to second him!--how then?  It was the\r\nsuccour needed.  Then he would have been ready to teach the world that\r\nNature--honest Nature--is more to be prized than Convention: a new Era\r\nmight begin.\r\n\r\nThe thought was tonic for an instant and illuminated him springingly.  It\r\nsank, excused for the flaccidity by Nataly's want of common adventurous\r\ndaring.  She had not taken to Lakelands; she was purchasing furniture\r\nfrom a flowing purse with a heavy heart--unfeminine, one might say; she\r\npreferred to live obscurely; she did not, one had to think--but it was\r\nunjust: and yet the accusation, that she did not cheerfully make a strain\r\nand spurt on behalf of her child, pressed to be repeated.\r\n\r\nThese short glimpses at reflection in Victor were like the verberant\r\ntwang of a musical instrument that has had a smart blow, and wails away\r\nindependent of the player's cunning hand.  He would have said, that he\r\nwas more his natural self when the cunning hand played on him, to make\r\nhim praise and uplift his beloved: mightily would it have astonished him\r\nto contemplate with assured perception in his own person the Nature he\r\ninvoked.  But men invoking Nature, do not find in her the Holy Mother she\r\nin such case becomes to her daughters, whom she so persecutes.  Men call\r\non her for their defence, as a favourable witness: she is a note of their\r\nrhetoric.  They are not bettered by her sustainment; they have not, as\r\nwomen may have, her enaemic aid at a trying hour.  It is not an effort at\r\nepigram to say, that whom she scourges most she most supports.\r\n\r\nAn Opera-placard drew his next remark to Fenellan.\r\n\r\n'How Wagner seems to have stricken the Italians!  Well, now, the Germans\r\nhave their Emperor to head their armies, and I say that the German\r\nemperor has done less for their lasting fame and influence than Wagner\r\nhas done.  He has affected the French too; I trace him in Gounod's Romeo\r\net Juliette--and we don't gain by it; we have a poor remuneration for the\r\nmelody gone; think of the little shepherd's pipeing in Mireille; and\r\nthere's another in Sapho-delicious.  I held out against Wagner as long as\r\nI could.  The Italians don't much more than Wagnerize in exchange for the\r\nloss of melody.  They would be wiser in going back to Pergolese,\r\nCampagnole.  The Mefistofole was good--of the school of the foreign\r\nmaster.  Aida and Otello, no.  I confess to a weakness for the old\r\nbarleysugar of Bellini or a Donizetti-Serenade.  Aren't you seduced by\r\ncadences?  Never mind Wagner's tap of his paedagogue's baton--a cadence\r\ncatches me still.  Early taste for barley-sugar, perhaps!  There's a\r\nmarch in Verdi's Attila and I Lombardi, I declare I'm in military step\r\nwhen I hear them, as in the old days, after leaving the Opera.  Fredi\r\ntakes little Mab Mountney to her first Opera to-night.  Enough to make us\r\nold ones envious!  You remember your first Opera, Fenellan?  Sonnambula,\r\nwith me.  I tell you, it would task the highest poetry--say, require, if\r\nyou like--showing all that's noblest, splendidest, in a young man, to\r\ndescribe its effect on me.  I was dreaming of my box at the Opera for a\r\nyear after.  The Huguenots to-night.  Not the best suited for little\r\nMabsy; but she'll catch at the Rataplan.  Capital Opera; we used to think\r\nit the best, before we had Tannhauser and Lohengrin and the\r\nMeistersinger.'\r\n\r\nVictor hinted notes of the Conspiration Scene closing the Third Act of\r\nthe Huguenots.  That sombre Chorus brought Mrs. Burman before him.  He\r\ndrummed the Rataplan, which sent her flying.  The return of a lively\r\ndisposition for dinner and music completed his emancipation from the yoke\r\nof the baleful creature sitting half her days in the chemist's shop; save\r\nthat a thought of drugs brought the smell, and the smell the picture; she\r\nthreatened to be an apparition at any moment pervading him through his\r\nnostrils.  He spoke to Fenellan of hunger for dinner, a need for it;\r\nsingular in one whose appetite ran to the stroke of the hour abreast with\r\nArmandine's kitchen-clock.  Fenellan proposed a glass of sherry and\r\nbitters at his Club over the way.  He had forgotten a shower of black-\r\nballs (attributable to the conjurations of old Ate) on a certain past\r\nday.  Without word of refusal, Victor entered a wine-merchant's office,\r\nwhere he was unknown, and stating his wish for bitters and dry sherry,\r\npresently received the glass, drank, nodded to the administering clerk,\r\nnamed the person whom he had obliged and refreshed, and passed out,\r\nremarking to Fenellan: 'Colney on Clubs!  he's right; they're the\r\nmediaeval in modern times, our Baron's castles, minus the Baron; dead\r\nagainst public life and social duties.  Business excuses my City Clubs;\r\nbut I shall take my name off my Club up West.'\r\n\r\n'More like monasteries, with a Committee for Abbot, and Whist for the\r\nservices,' Fenellan said.  'Or tabernacles for the Chosen, and\r\nGrangousier playing Divinity behind the veil.  Well, they're social.'\r\n\r\n'Sectionally social, means anything but social, my friend.  However--and\r\nthe monastery had a bell for the wanderer!  Say, I'm penniless or\r\npoundless, up and down this walled desert of a street, I feel, I must\r\nfeel, these palaces--if we're Christian, not Jews: not that the Jews\r\nare uncharitable; they set an: example, in fact .  .  .  .  '\r\n\r\nHe rambled, amusingly to the complacent hearing of Fenellan, who thought\r\nof his pursuit of wealth and grand expenditure.\r\n\r\nVictor talked as a man having his mind at leaps beyond the subject.\r\nHe was nearing to the Idea he had seized and lost on London Bridge.\r\n\r\nThe desire for some good news wherewith to inspirit Nataly, withdrew him\r\nfrom his ineffectual chase.  He had nought to deliver; on the contrary,\r\na meditation concerning her comfort pledged him to concealment which was\r\nthe no step, or passive state, most abhorrent to him.\r\n\r\nHe snatched at the name of Themison.\r\n\r\nWith Dr. Themison fast in his grasp, there was a report of progress to be\r\nmade to Nataly; and not at all an empty report.\r\n\r\nThemison, then: he leaned on Themison.  The woman's doctor should have an\r\ninfluence approaching to authority with her.\r\n\r\nLand-values in the developing Colonies, formed his theme of discourse to\r\nFenellan: let Banks beware.\r\n\r\nFenellan saw him shudder and rub the back of his head.  'Feel the wind?'\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nVictor answered him with that humane thrill of the deep tones, which at\r\ntimes he had: 'No: don't be alarmed; I feel the devil.  If one has wealth\r\nand a desperate wish, he will speak.  All he does, is to make me more\r\ncharitable to those who give way to him.  I believe in a devil.'\r\n\r\n'Horns and tail?'\r\n\r\n'Bait and hook.'\r\n\r\n'I haven't wealth, and I wish only for dinner,' Fenellan said.\r\n\r\n'You know that Armandine is never two minutes late.  By the way, you\r\nhaven't wealth--you have me.'\r\n\r\n'And I thank God for you!' said Fenellan, acutely reminiscent of his\r\nhaving marked the spiritual adviser of Mrs. Burman, the Rev. Groseman\r\nButtermore, as a man who might be useful to his friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nDISCLOSES A STAGE ON THE DRIVE TO PARIS\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, an extremely disconcerting circumstance occurred:\r\nArmandine was ten minutes behind the hour with her dinner.  But the\r\nsurprise and stupefaction expressed by Victor, after glances at his\r\nwatch, were not so profound as Fenellan's, on finding himself exchangeing\r\nthe bow with a gentleman bearing the name of Dr. Themison.  His friend's\r\nrapidity in pushing the combinations he conceived, was known: Fenellan's\r\nwonder was not so much that Victor had astonished him again, as that he\r\nshould be called upon again to wonder at his astonishment.  He did; and\r\nhe observed the doctor and Victor and Nataly: aided by dropping remarks.\r\nBefore the evening was over, he gathered enough of the facts, and had to\r\nspeculate only on the designs.  Dr. Themison had received a visit from\r\nthe husband of Mrs. Victor Radnor concerning her state of health.  At an\r\ninterview with the lady, laughter greeted him; he was confused by her\r\ndenial of the imputation of a single ailment: but she, to recompose him,\r\nlet it be understood, that she was anxious about her husband's condition,\r\nhe being certainly overworked; and the husband's visit passed for a\r\ndevice on the part of the wife.  She admitted a willingness to try a\r\nchange of air, if it was deemed good for her husband.  Change of air was\r\nprescribed to each for both.  'Why not drive to Paris?' the doctor said,\r\nand Victor was taken with the phrase.\r\n\r\nHe told Fenellan at night that Mrs. Burman, he had heard, was by the sea,\r\non the South coast.  Which of her maladies might be in the ascendant,\r\nhe did not know.  He knew little.  He fancied that Dr. Themison was\r\nunsuspicious of the existence of a relationship between him and Mrs.\r\nBurman: and Fenellan opined, that there had been no communication upon\r\nprivate affairs.  What, then, was the object in going to Dr. Themison?\r\nHe treated her body merely; whereas the Rev. Groseman Buttermore could\r\nbe expected to impose upon her conduct.  Fenellan appreciated his own\r\ndiscernment of the superior uses to which a spiritual adviser may be put,\r\nand he too agreeably flattered himself for the corrective reflection to\r\nensue, that he had not done anything.  It disposed him to think a happy\r\npassivity more sagacious than a restless activity.  We should let Fortune\r\nperform her part at the wheel in working out her ends, should we not?--\r\nfor, ten to one, nine times out of ten we are thwarting her if we stretch\r\nout a hand.  And with the range of enjoyments possessed by Victor, why\r\nthis unceasing restlessness?  Why, when we are not near drowning, catch\r\nat apparent straws, which may be instruments having sharp edges?\r\nThemison, as Mrs. Burman's medical man, might tell the lady tales\r\nthat would irritate her bag of venom.\r\n\r\nRarely though Fenellan was the critic on his friend, the shadow cast over\r\nhis negligent hedonism by Victor's boiling pressure, drove him into the\r\nseat of judgement.  As a consequence, he was rather a dull table-guest in\r\nthe presence of Dr. Themison, whom their host had pricked to anticipate\r\nhigh entertainment from him.  He did nothing to bridge the crevasse and\r\nwarm the glacier air at table when the doctor, anecdotal intentionally to\r\ndraw him out, related a decorous but pungent story of one fair member of\r\na sweet new sisterhood in agitation against the fixed establishment of\r\nour chain-mail marriage-tie.  An anecdote of immediate diversion was\r\nwanted, expected: and Fenellan sat stupidly speculating upon whether the\r\ndoctor knew of a cupboard locked.  So that Dr. Themison was carried on by\r\nLady Grace Halley's humourous enthusiasm for the subject to dilate and\r\ndiscuss and specify, all in the irony of a judicial leaning to the side\r\nof the single-minded social adventurers, under an assumed accord with his\r\naudience; concluding: 'So there's an end of Divorce.'\r\n\r\n'By the trick of multiplication,' Fenellan, now reassured, was content to\r\nsay.  And that did not extinguish the cracker of a theme; handled very\r\ncarefully, as a thing of fire, it need scarce be remarked, three young\r\nwomen being present.\r\n\r\nNataly had eyes on her girl, and was pleased at an alertness shown by Mr.\r\nSowerby to second her by crossing the dialogue.  As regarded her personal\r\nfeelings, she was hardened, so long as the curtains were about her to\r\nkeep the world from bending black brows of inquisition upon one of its\r\nculprits.  But her anxiety was vigilant to guard her girl from an\r\ninfusion of any of the dread facts of life not coming through the\r\nmother's lips: and she was a woman having the feminine mind's pudency\r\nin that direction, which does not consent to the revealing of much.\r\nHere was the mother's dilemma: her girl--Victor's girl, as she had to\r\nthink in this instance,--the most cloudless of the young women of earth,\r\nseemed, and might be figured as really, at the falling of a crumb off the\r\ntable of knowledge, taken by the brain to shoot up to terrific heights of\r\nsurveyal; and there she rocked; and only her youthful healthiness brought\r\nher down to grass and flowers.  She had once or twice received the\r\nelectrical stimulus, to feel and be as lightning, from a seizure of facts\r\nin infinitesimal doses, guesses caught off maternal evasions or the\r\ncircuitous explanation of matters touching sex in here and there a\r\nnewspaper, harder to repress completely than sewer-gas in great cities:\r\nand her mother had seen, with an apprehensive pang of anguish, how\r\nwitheringly the scared young intelligence of the innocent creature\r\nshocked her sensibility.  She foresaw the need to such a flameful soul,\r\nas bride, wife, woman across the world, of the very princeliest of men in\r\ngifts of strength, for her sustainer and guide.  And the provident mother\r\nknew this peerless gentleman: but he had his wife.\r\n\r\nDelusions and the pain of the disillusioning were to be feared for the\r\nimaginative Nesta; though not so much as that on some future day of a\r\nperchance miserable yokemating--a subjection or an entanglement--the\r\nnobler passions might be summoned to rise for freedom, and strike a line\r\nto make their logically estimable sequence from a source not honourable\r\nbefore the public.  Constantly it had to be thought, that the girl was\r\nher father's child.\r\n\r\nAt present she had no passions; and her bent to the happiness she could\r\nso richly give, had drawn her sailing smoothly over the harbour-bar of\r\nmaidenhood; where many of her sisters are disconcerted to the loss of\r\nsimplicity.  If Nataly with her sleepless watchfulness and forecasts\r\npartook of the French mother, Nesta's Arcadian independence likened her\r\nsomewhat in manner to the Transatlantic version of the English girl.  Her\r\nhigh physical animation and the burden of themes it plucked for delivery\r\ncarried her flowing over impediments of virginal self-consciousness, to\r\nset her at her ease in the talk with men; she had not gone through the\r\nvarious Nursery exercises in dissimulation; she had no appearance of\r\npraying forgiveness of men for the original sin of being woman; and no\r\ntricks of lips or lids, or traitor scarlet on the cheeks, or assumptions\r\nof the frigid mask, or indicated reserve-cajoleries.  Neither ignorantly\r\nnor advisedly did she play on these or other bewitching strings of her\r\nsex, after the fashion of the stamped innocents, who are the boast of\r\nEnglishmen and matrons, and thrill societies with their winsome\r\ningenuousness; and who sometimes when unguarded meet an artful serenader,\r\nthat is a cloaked bandit, and is provoked by their performances, and\r\nknows anthropologically the nature behind the devious show; a sciential\r\nrascal; as little to be excluded from our modern circles as Eve's own old\r\ndeuce from Eden's garden whereupon, opportunity inviting, both the fool\r\nand the cunning, the pure donkey princess of insular eulogy, and the sham\r\none, are in a perilous pass.\r\n\r\nDamsels of the swiftness of mind of Nesta cannot be ignorant utterly amid\r\na world where the hints are hourly scattering seed of the inklings; when\r\nvileness is not at work up and down our thoroughfares, proclaiming its\r\nexistence with tableau and trumpet.  Nataly encountered her girl's\r\nquestions, much as one seeks to quiet an enemy.  The questions had soon\r\nceased.  Excepting repulsive and rejected details, there is little to be\r\nlearnt when a little is known: in populous communities, density only will\r\nkeep the little out.  Only stupidity will suppose that it can be done for\r\nthe livelier young.  English mothers forethoughtful for their girls, have\r\nto take choice of how to do battle with a rough-and-tumble Old England,\r\nthat lumbers bumping along, craving the precious things, which can be had\r\nbut in semblance under the conditions allowed by laziness to subsist, and\r\nso curst of its shifty inconsequence as to worship in the concrete an\r\nhypocrisy it abhors in the abstract.  Nataly could smuggle or confiscate\r\nhere and there a newspaper; she could not interdict or withhold every one\r\nof them, from a girl ardent to be in the race on all topics of popular\r\ninterest: and the newspapers are occasionally naked savages; the streets\r\nare imperfectly garmented even by day; and we have our stumbling social\r\nanecdotist, our spot-mouthed young man, our eminently silly woman; our\r\nslippery one; our slimy one, the Rahab of Society; not to speak of Mary\r\nthe maid and the footman William.  A vigilant mother has to contend with\r\nthese and the like in an increasing degree.  How best?\r\n\r\nThere is a method: one that Colney Durance advocated.  The girl's\r\nintelligence and sweet blood invited a trial of it.  Since, as he argued,\r\nwe cannot keep the poisonous matter out, mothers should prepare and\r\nstrengthen young women for the encounter with it, by lifting the veil,\r\nbaring the world, giving them knowledge to arm them for the fight they\r\nhave to sustain; and thereby preserve them further from the spiritual\r\ncollapse which follows the nursing of a false ideal of our life in\r\nyouth:--this being, Colney said, the prominent feminine disease of the\r\ntime, common to all our women; that is, all having leisure to shine in\r\nthe sun or wave in the wind as flowers of the garden.\r\n\r\nWhatever there was of wisdom in his view, he spoilt it for English\r\nhearing, by making use of his dry compressed sentences.  Besides he was a\r\nbachelor; therefore but a theorist.  And his illustrations of his theory\r\nwere grotesque; meditation on them extracted a corrosive acid to consume,\r\nin horrid derision, the sex, the nation, the race of man.  The satirist\r\ntoo devotedly loves his lash to be a persuasive teacher.  Nataly had\r\nexcuses to cover her reasons for not listening to him.\r\n\r\nOne reason was, as she discerned through her confusion at the thought,\r\nthat the day drew near for her speaking fully to Nesta; when, between\r\nwhat she then said and what she said now, a cruel contrast might strike\r\nthe girl and in toneing revelations now, to be more consonant with them\r\nthen;--in softening and shading the edges of social misconduct, it seemed\r\npainfully possible to be sowing in the girl's mind something like the\r\nreverse of moral precepts, even to smoothing the way to a rebelliousness\r\npartly or wholly similar to her own.  But Nataly's chief and her\r\nappeasing reason for pursuing the conventional system with this\r\nexceptional young creature, referred to the sentiments on that subject\r\nof the kind of young man whom a mother elects from among those present\r\nand eligible, as perhaps next to worthy to wed the girl, by virtue of\r\ngood promise in the moral department.  She had Mr. Dudley Sowerby under\r\nview; far from the man of her choice and still the practice of decorum,\r\ndiscretion, a pardonable fastidiousness, appears, if women may make any\r\nforecast of the behaviour of young men or may trust the faces they see,\r\nto, promise a future stability in the husband.  Assuredly a Dudley\r\nSowerby would be immensely startled to find in his bride a young woman\r\nmore than babily aware of the existence of one particular form of\r\nnaughtiness on earth.\r\n\r\nVictor was of no help: he had not an idea upon the right education of the\r\nyoung of the sex.  Repression and mystery, he considered wholesome for\r\ngirls; and he considered the enlightening of them--to some extent--a\r\nprudential measure for their defence; and premature instruction is a\r\nfire-water to their wild-in-woods understanding; and histrionic innocence\r\nis no doubt the bloom on corruption; also the facts of current human\r\nlife, in the crude of the reports or the cooked of the sermon in the\r\nnewspapers, are a noxious diet for our daughters; whom nevertheless we\r\ncannot hope to be feeding always on milk: and there is a time when their\r\nadorable pretty ignorance, if credibly it exists out of noodledom, is\r\nharmful:--but how beautiful the shining simplicity of our dear young\r\nEnglish girls!  He was one of the many men to whose minds women come in\r\npictures and are accepted much as they paint themselves.  Like his\r\nnumerous fellows, too, he required a conflict with them, and a worsting\r\nat it, to be taught, that they are not the mere live stock we scheme to\r\ndispose of for their good: unless Love should interpose, he would have\r\nexclaimed.  He broke from his fellows in his holy horror of a father's\r\nrunning counter to love.  Nesta had only to say, that she loved another,\r\nfor Dudley Sowerby to be withdrawn into the background of aspirants.\r\nBut love was unknown to the girl.\r\n\r\nOutwardly, the plan of the Drive to Paris had the look of Victor's\r\ntraditional hospitality.  Nataly smiled at her incorrigibly lagging\r\nintelligence of him, on hearing that he had invited a company: 'Lady\r\nGrace, for gaiety; Peridon and Catkin, fiddles; Dudley Sowerby and\r\nmyself, flutes; Barmby, intonation; in all, nine of us; and by the dear\r\nold Normandy route, for the sake of the voyage, as in old times; towers\r\nof Dieppe in the morning-light; and the lovely road to the capital!  Just\r\nthree days in Paris, and home by any of the other routes.  It's the drive\r\nwe want.  Boredom in wet weather, we defy; we have our Concert--an hour\r\nat night and we're sure of sleep.'  It had a sweet simple air, befitting\r\nhim; as when in bygone days they travelled with the joy of children.\r\nFor travelling shook Nataly out of her troubles and gave her something of\r\nthe child's inheritance of the wisdom of life--the living ever so little\r\nahead of ourselves; about as far as the fox in view of the hunt.  That is\r\nthe soul of us out for novelty, devouring as it runs, an endless feast;\r\nand the body is eagerly after it, recording the pleasures, a daily chase.\r\nRemembrance of them is almost a renewal, anticipation a revival.  She\r\nenraptured Victor with glimpses of the domestic fun she had ceased to\r\nshow sign of since the revelation of Lakelands.  Her only regret was on\r\naccount of the exclusion of Colney Durance from the party, because of\r\nhappy memories associating him with the Seine-land, and also that his\r\nbilious criticism of his countrymen was moderated by a trip to the\r\nContinent.  Fenellan reported Colney to be 'busy in the act of distilling\r\none of his Prussic acid essays.'  Fenellan would have jumped to go.  He\r\ninformed Victor, as a probe, that the business of the Life Insurance was\r\nat periods 'fearfully necrological!  Inexplicably, he was not invited.\r\nDid it mean, that he was growing dull?  He looked inside instead of out,\r\nand lost the clue.\r\n\r\nHis behaviour on the evening of the departure showed plainly what would\r\nhave befallen Mr. Sowerby on the expedition, had not he as well as Colney\r\nbeen excluded.  Two carriages and a cab conveyed the excursionists, as\r\nthey merrily called themselves, to the terminus.  They were Victor's\r\nguests; they had no trouble, no expense, none of the nipper reckonings\r\nwhich dog our pleasures; the state of pure bliss.  Fenellan's enviousness\r\ndrove him at the Rev. Mr. Barmby until the latter jumped to the seat\r\nbeside Nesta in her carriage, Mademoiselle de Seilles and Mr. Sowerby\r\nfacing them.  Lady Grace Halley, in the carriage behind, heard Nesta's\r\nlaugh; which Mr. Barmby had thought vacuous, beseeming little girls, that\r\nlaugh at nothings.  She questioned Fenellan.\r\n\r\n'Oh,' said he, 'I merely mentioned that the Rev. gentleman carries his\r\nmusical instrument at the bottom of his trunk.'\r\n\r\nShe smiled: 'And who are in the cab?'\r\n\r\n'Your fiddles are in the cab, in charge of Peridon and Catkin.  Those two\r\nwould have writhed like head and tail of a worm, at a division on the way\r\nto the station.  Point a finger at Peridon, you run Catkin through the\r\nbody.  They're a fabulous couple.'\r\n\r\nVictor cut him short.  'I deny that those two are absurd.'\r\n\r\n'And Catkin's toothache is a galvanic battery upon Peridon.'\r\n\r\nNataly strongly denied it.  Peridon and Catkin pertained to their genial\r\npicture of the dear sweet nest in life; a dale never traversed by the\r\nwithering breath they dreaded.\r\n\r\nFenellan then, to prove that he could be as bad in his way as Colney,\r\nfell to work on the absent Miss Priscilla Graves and Mr. Pempton, with a\r\npitchfork's exaltation of the sacred attachment of the divergently\r\nmeritorious couple, and a melancholy reference to implacable obstacles in\r\nthe principles of each.  The pair were offending the amatory corner in\r\nthe generous good sense of Nataly and Victor; they were not to be hotly\r\nprotected, though they were well enough liked for their qualities, except\r\nby Lady Grace, who revelled in the horrifying and scandalizing of Miss\r\nGraves.  Such a specimen of the Puritan middle English as Priscilla\r\nGraves, was eastwind on her skin, nausea to her gorge.  She wondered at\r\nhaving drifted into the neighbourhood of a person resembling in her\r\nrepellent formal chill virtuousness a windy belfry tower, down among\r\nthose districts of suburban London or appalling provincial towns passed\r\nnow and then with a shudder, where the funereal square bricks-up the\r\nChurch, that Arctic hen-mother sits on the square, and the moving dead\r\nare summoned to their round of penitential exercise by a monosyllabic\r\ntribulation-bell.  Fenellan's graphic sketch of the teetotaller woman\r\nseeing her admirer pursued by Eumenides flagons--abominations of\r\nemptiness--to the banks of the black river of suicides, where the one\r\nmost wretched light is Inebriation's nose; and of the vegetarian\r\nvioloncello's horror at his vision of the long procession of the flocks\r\nand herds into his lady's melodious Ark of a mouth, excited and delighted\r\nher antipathy.  She was amused to transports at the station, on hearing\r\nMr. Barmby, in a voice all ophicleide, remark: 'No, I carry no\r\ninstrument.'  The habitation of it at the bottom of his trunk, was not\r\nforgotten when it sounded.\r\n\r\nReclining in warmth on the deck of the vessel at night, she said, just\r\nunder Victor's ear: 'Where are those two?'\r\n\r\n'Bid me select the couple,' said he.\r\n\r\nShe rejoined: 'Silly man'; and sleepily gave him her hand for good night,\r\nand so paralyzed his arm, that he had to cover the continued junction by\r\nsaying more than he intended: 'If they come to an understanding!'\r\n\r\n'Plain enough on one side.'\r\n\r\n'You think it suitable?'\r\n\r\n'Perfection; and well-planned to let them discover it.'  'This is really\r\nmy favourite route; I love the saltwater and the night on deck.'\r\n\r\n'Go on.'\r\n\r\n'How?'\r\n\r\n'Number your loves.  It would tax your arithmetic.'\r\n\r\n'I can hate.'\r\n\r\n'Not me?'\r\n\r\nPositively the contrary, an impulsive squeeze of fingers declared it;\r\nand they broke the link, neither of them sensibly hurt; though a leaf\r\nor two of the ingenuities, which were her thoughts, turned over in the\r\nphantasies of the lady; and the gentleman was taught to feel that a never\r\nso slightly lengthened compression of the hand female shoots within us\r\nboth straight and far and round the corners.  There you have Nature, if\r\nyou want her naked in her elements, for a text.  He loved his Nataly\r\ntruly, even fervently, after the twenty years of union; he looked about\r\nat no other woman; it happened only that the touch of one, the chance\r\nwarm touch, put to motion the blind forces of our mother so remarkably\r\nsurcharging him.  But it was without kindling.  The lady, the much cooler\r\nperson, did nurse a bit of flame.  She had a whimsical liking for the man\r\nwho enjoyed simple things when commanding the luxuries; and it became a\r\nfascination, by extreme contrast, at the reminder of his adventurous\r\nenterprises in progress while he could so childishly enjoy.  Women who\r\ndance with the warrior-winner of battles, and hear him talk his ball-room\r\ntrifles to amuse, have similarly a smell of gunpowder to intoxicate them.\r\n\r\nFor him, a turn on the deck brought him into new skies.  Nataly lay in\r\nthe cabin.  She used to be where Lady Grace was lying.  A sort of\r\npleadable, transparent, harmless hallucination of the renewal of old\r\nservice induced him to refresh and settle the fair semi-slumberer's\r\npillow, and fix the tarpaulin over her silks and wraps; and bend his head\r\nto the soft mouth murmuring thanks.  The women who can dare the nuit\r\nblanche, and under stars; and have a taste for holiday larks after their\r\nthirtieth, are rare; they are precious.  Nataly nevertheless was approved\r\nfor guarding her throat from the nightwind.  And a softer southerly\r\nbreath never crossed Channel!  The very breeze he had wished for!  Luck\r\nwas with him.\r\n\r\nNesta sat by the rails of the vessel beside her Louise.  Mr. Sowerby in\r\npassing, exchanged a description of printed agreement with her, upon the\r\nbeauty of the night--a good neutral topic for the encounter of the sexes\r\nnot that he wanted it neutral; it furnished him with a vocabulary.  Once\r\nhe perceptibly washed his hands of dutiful politeness, in addressing\r\nMademoiselle de Seilles, likewise upon the beauty of the night; and the\r\nFrench lady, thinking--too conclusively from the breath on the glass at\r\nthe moment, as it is the Gallic habit--that if her dear Nesta must\r\nespouse one of the uninteresting creatures called men in her native land,\r\nit might as well be this as another, agreed that the night was very\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\n'He speaks grammatical French,' Nesta commented on his achievement.\r\n'He contrives in his walking not to wet his boots,' mademoiselle\r\nrejoined.\r\n\r\nMr. Peridon was a more welcome sample of the islanders, despite an\r\ninferior pretension to accent.  He burned to be near these ladies, and\r\nhe passed them but once.  His enthusiasm for Mademoiselle de Seilles was\r\nnotorious.  Gratefully the compliment was acknowledged by her, in her\r\ndemure fashion; with a reserve of comic intellectual contempt for the man\r\nwho could not see that women, or Frenchwomen, or eminently she among\r\nthem, must have their enthusiasm set springing in the breast before they\r\ncan be swayed by the most violent of outer gales.  And say, that she is\r\nuprooted;--he does but roll a log.  Mr. Peridon's efforts to perfect\r\nhimself in the French tongue touched her.\r\n\r\nA night of May leaning on June, is little more than a deliberate wink of\r\nthe eye of light.  Mr. Barmby, an exile from the ladies by reason of an\r\naddiction to tobacco, quitted the forepart of the vessel at the first\r\ngreying.  Now was the cloak of night worn threadbare, and grey astir for\r\nthe heralding of gold, day visibly ready to show its warmer throbs.\r\nThe gentle waves were just a stronger grey than the sky, perforce of an\r\ninterfusion that shifted gradations; they were silken, in places oily\r\ngrey; cold to drive the sight across their playful monotonousness for\r\nrefuge on any far fisher-sail.\r\n\r\nMiss Radnor was asleep, eyelids benignly down, lips mildly closed.\r\nThe girl's cheeks held colour to match a dawn yet unawakened though born.\r\nThey were in a nest shading amid silks of pale blue, and there was a\r\nlanguid flutter beneath her chin to the catch of the morn-breeze.\r\nBacchanal threads astray from a disorderly front-lock of rich brown hair\r\nwere alive over an eyebrow showing like a seal upon the lightest and\r\nsecurest of slumbers.\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby gazed, and devoutly.  Both the ladies were in their oblivion;\r\nthe younger quite saintly; but the couple inseparably framed, elevating\r\nto behold; a reproach to the reminiscence of pipes.  He was near; and\r\nquietly the eyelids of mademoiselle lifted on him.  Her look was grave,\r\nstraight, uninquiring, soon accurately perusing; an arrow of Artemis for\r\npenetration.  He went by, with the sound in the throat of a startled\r\nbush-bird taking to wing; he limped off some nail of the deck, as if that\r\nyoung Frenchwoman had turned the foot to a hoof.  Man could not be more\r\nguiltless, yet her look had perturbed him; nails conspired; in his\r\nvexation, he execrated tobacco.  And ask not why, where reason never was.\r\n\r\nNesta woke babbling on the subject she had relinquished for sleep.\r\nMademoiselle touched a feathery finger at her hair and hood during their\r\nsilvery French chimes.\r\n\r\nMr. Sowerby presented the risen morning to them, with encomiums, after\r\nthey had been observing every variation in it.  He spoke happily of the\r\npleasant passage, and of the agreeable night; particularly of the\r\nexcellent idea of the expedition by this long route at night; the\r\nprospect of which had disfigured him with his grimace of speculation--\r\napparently a sourness that did not exist.  Nesta had a singular notion,\r\ncoming of a girl's mingled observation and intuition, that the\r\nimpressions upon this gentleman were in arrear, did not strike him till\r\nlate.  Mademoiselle confirmed it when it was mentioned; she remembered to\r\nhave noticed the same in many small things.  And it was a pointed\r\nperception.\r\n\r\nVictor sent his girl down to Nataly, with a summons to hurry up and see\r\nsunlight over the waters.  Nataly came; she looked, and the outer wakened\r\nthe inner, she let the light look in on her, her old feelings danced to\r\nher eyes like a, string of bubbles in ascent.  'Victor, Victor, it seems\r\nonly yesterday that we crossed, twelve years back--was it?--and in May,\r\nand saw the shoal of porpoises, and five minutes after, Dieppe in view.\r\nDear French people!  I share your love for France.'\r\n\r\n'Home of our holidays!--the \"drives\"; and they may be the happiest.\r\nAnd fifty minutes later we were off the harbour; and Natata landed, a\r\nstranger; and at night she was the heroine of the town.'\r\n\r\nVictor turned to a stately gentleman and passed his name to Nataly: 'Sir\r\nRodwell Balchington, a neighbour of Lakelands!  She understood that Lady\r\nGrace Halley was acquainted with Sir Rodwell:--hence this dash of brine\r\nto her lips while she was drinking of happy memories, and Victor\r\nevidently was pluming himself upon his usual luck in the fortuitous\r\nencounter with an influential neighbour of Lakelands.  He told Sir\r\nRodwell the story of how they had met in the salle a manger of the hotel\r\nthe impresario of a Concert in the town, who had in his hand the doctor's\r\ncertificate of the incapacity of the chief cantatrice to appear, and\r\nwaved it, within a step of suicide.  'Well, to be brief, my wife--\"noble\r\ndame Anglaise,\" as the man announced her on the Concert platform,\r\nundertook one of the songs, and sang another of her own-pure contralto\r\nvoice, as you will say; with the result that there was a perfect tumult\r\nof enthusiasm.  Next day, the waiters of the hotel presented her with a\r\nbouquet of Spring flowers, white, and central violets.  It was in the\r\nParis papers, under the heading: Une amie d'outre Manche--I think that\r\nwas it?' he asked Nataly.\r\n\r\n'I forget,' said she.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at her: a cloud had risen.  He rallied her, spoke of the old\r\nNorman silver cross which the manager of the Concert had sent, humbly\r\nimploring her to accept the small memento of his gratitude.  She nodded\r\nan excellent artificial brightness.\r\n\r\nAnd there was the coast of France under young sunlight over the waters.\r\nOnce more her oft-petitioning wish through the years, that she had\r\nentered the ranks of professional singers, upon whom the moral scrutiny\r\nis not so microscopic, invaded her, resembling a tide-swell into rock-\r\ncaves, which have been filled before and left to emptiness, and will be\r\nleft to emptiness again.  Nataly had the intimation visiting us when,\r\nin a decline of physical power, the mind's ready vivacity to conjure\r\nillusions forsakes us; and it was, of a wall ahead, and a force impelling\r\nher against it, and no hope of deviation.  And this is the featureless\r\nthing, Destiny; not without eyes, if we have a conscience to throw them\r\ninto it to look at us.\r\n\r\nCounsel to her to live in the hour, came, as upon others on the vessel,\r\nfrom an active breath of the salt prompting to healthy hunger; and hardly\r\nless from the splendour of the low full sunlight on the waters, the\r\nskimming and dancing of the thousands of golden shells away from under\r\nthe globe of fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nA PATRIOT ABROAD\r\n\r\nNine days after his master's departure, Daniel Skepsey, a man of some\r\nrenown of late, as a subject of reports and comments in the newspapers,\r\nobtained a passport, for the identification, if need were, of his missing\r\nor misapprehended person in a foreign country, of the language of which\r\nthree unpronounceable words were knocking about his head to render the\r\nthought of the passport a staff of safety; and on the morning that\r\nfollowed he was at speed through Normandy, to meet his master rounding\r\nhomeward from Paris, at a town not to be spoken as it is written, by\r\nreason of the custom of the good people of the country, with whom we\r\nwould fain live on neighbourly terms:--yes, and they had proof of it,\r\nnot so very many years back, when they were enduring the worst which can\r\nbefall us--though Mr. Durance, to whom he was indebted for the writing of\r\nthe place of his destination large on a card, and the wording of the\r\nFrench sound beside it, besides the jotting down of trains and the\r\nstation for the change of railways, Mr. Durance could say, that the\r\nactive form of our sympathy consisted in the pouring of cheeses upon\r\nthem when they were prostrate and unable to resist!\r\n\r\nA kind gentleman, Mr. Durance, as Daniel Skepsey had recent cause to\r\nknow, but often exceedingly dark; not so patriotic as desireable, it was\r\nto be feared; and yet, strangely indeed, Mr. Durance had said cogent\r\nthings on the art of boxing and on manly exercises, and he hoped--he was\r\nemphatic in saying he hoped--we should be regenerated.  He must have\r\nmeant, that boxing--on a grand scale would contribute to it.  He said,\r\nthat a blow now and then was wholesome for us all.  He recommended a\r\nmonthly private whipping for old gentlemen who decline the use of the\r\ngloves, to disperse their humours; not excluding Judges and Magistrates:\r\nhe could hardly be in earnest.  He spoke in a clergyman's voice, and said\r\nit would be payment of good assurance money, beneficial to their souls:\r\nhe seemed to mean it.  He said, that old gentlemen were bottled vapours,\r\nand it was good for them to uncork them periodically.  He said, they\r\nshould be excused half the strokes if they danced nightly--they resented\r\nmotion.  He seemed sadly wanting in veneration.\r\n\r\nBut he might not positively intend what he said.  Skepsey could overlook\r\neverything he said, except the girding at England.  For where is a braver\r\npeople, notwithstanding appearances!  Skepsey knew of dozens of gallant\r\nbruisers, ready for the cry to strip to the belt; worthy, with a little\r\npublic encouragement, to rank beside their grandfathers of the Ring, in\r\nthe brilliant times when royalty and nobility countenanced the manly art,\r\nour nursery of heroes, and there was not the existing unhappy division of\r\nclasses.  He still trusted to convince Mr. Durance, by means of argument\r\nand happy instances, historical and immediate, that the English may\r\njustly consider themselves the elect of nations, for reasons better than\r\ntheir accumulation of the piles of gold-better than 'usurers' reasons,'\r\nas Mr. Durance called them.  Much that Mr. Durance had said at intervals\r\nwas, although remembered almost to the letter of the phrase, beyond his\r\ncomprehension, and he put it aside, with penitent blinking at his\r\ndeficiency.\r\n\r\nAll the while, he was hearing a rattle of voluble tongues around him, and\r\na shout of stations, intelligible as a wash of pebbles, and blocks in a\r\ntorrent.  Generally the men slouched when they were not running.  At\r\nDieppe he had noticed muscular fellows; he admitted them to be nimbler on\r\nthe legs than ours; and that may count both ways, he consoled a patriotic\r\nvanity by thinking; instantly rebuking the thought; for he had read\r\nchapters of Military History.  He sat eyeing the front row of figures in\r\nhis third-class carriage, musing on the kind of soldiers we might, heaven\r\ndesigning it, have to face, and how to beat them; until he gazed on\r\nRouen, knowing by the size of it and by what Mr. Durance had informed him\r\nof the city on the river, that it must be the very city of Rouen, not so\r\nmany years back a violated place, at the mercy of a foreign foe.  Strong\r\npity laid hold of Skepsey.  He fortified the heights for defence, but saw\r\nat a glance that it was the city for modern artillery to command, crush\r\nand enter.  He lost idea of these afflicted people as foes, merely\r\ncomplaining of their attacks on England, and their menaces in their\r\nJournals and pamphlets; and he renounced certain views of the country to\r\nbe marched over on the road by this route to Paris, for the dictation of\r\nterms of peace at the gates of the French capital, sparing them the\r\nshameful entry; and this after the rout of their attempt at an invasion\r\nof the Island!\r\n\r\nA man opposite him was looking amicably on his lively grey eyes.  Skepsey\r\nhanded a card from his pocket.  The man perused it, and crying: 'Dreux?'\r\nwaved out of the carriage-window at a westerly distance, naming Rouen as\r\nnot the place, not at all, totally other.  Thus we are taught, that a\r\nforeign General, ignorant of the language, must confine himself to\r\ndefensive operations at home; he would be a child in the hands of the\r\ncommonest man he meets.  Brilliant with thanks in signs, Skepsey drew\r\nfrom his friend a course of instruction in French names, for our\r\nnecessities on a line of march.  The roads to Great Britain's metropolis,\r\nand the supplies of forage and provision at every stage of a march on\r\nLondon, are marked in the military offices of these people; and that,\r\nwith their barking Journals, is a piece of knowledge to justify a\r\nbelligerent return for it.  Only we pray to be let live peacefully.\r\n\r\nFervently we pray it when this good man, a total stranger to us, conducts\r\nan ignorant foreigner from one station to another through the streets of\r\nRouen, after a short stoppage at the buffet and assistance in the\r\nidentification of coins; then, lifting his cap to us, retires.\r\n\r\nAnd why be dealing wounds and death?  It is a more blessed thing to keep\r\nthe Commandments.  But how is it possible to keep the Commandments if you\r\nhave a vexatious wife?\r\n\r\nMartha Skepsey had given him a son to show the hereditary energy in his\r\ncrying and coughing; and it was owing, he could plead, to her habits and\r\nher tongue, that he sometimes, that he might avoid the doing of worse--\r\nfor she wanted correction and was improved by it--courted the excitement\r\nof a short exhibition of skill, man to man, on publicans' first floors.\r\nHe could have told the magistrates so, in part apology for the\r\ncircumstances dragging him the other day, so recently, before his\r\nWorship; and he might have told it, if he had not remembered Captain\r\nDartrey Fenellan's words about treating women chivalrously which was\r\ninterpreted by Skepsey as correcting them, when called upon to do it,\r\nbut never exposing them only, if allowed to account for the circumstances\r\npushing us into the newspapers, we should not present so guilty a look\r\nbefore the public.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as to how far it is the duty of a man to serve his master,\r\nthere is likewise question: whether is he, while receiving reproof and\r\npunishment for excess of zeal in the service of his master, not to\r\nmention the welfare of the country, morally--without establishing it as a\r\nprinciple--exonerated?  Miss Graves might be asked save that one would\r\nnot voluntarily trouble a lady on such subjects.  But supposing, says the\r\nopposing counsel, now at work in Skepsey's conscience, supposing this\r\nact, for which, contraveneing the law of the land, you are reproved and\r\npunished, to be agreeable to you, how then?  We answer, supposing it--and\r\nwe take uncomplainingly the magistrate's reproof and punishment--morally\r\njustified can it be expected of us to have the sense of guilt, although\r\nwe wear and know we wear a guilty look before the public?\r\n\r\nHis master and the dear ladies would hear of it; perhaps they knew of it\r\nnow; with them would rest the settlement of the distressing inquiry.  The\r\nladies would be shocked ladies cannot bear any semblance of roughness,\r\nnot even with the gloves:--and knowing, as they must, that our practise\r\nof the manly art is for their protection.\r\n\r\nSkepsey's grievous prospect of the hour to come under judgement of a sex\r\nthat was ever a riddle unread, clouded him on the approach to Dreux.  He\r\nstudied the country and the people eagerly; he forbore to conduct great\r\nmilitary operations.  Mr. Durance had spoken of big battles round about\r\nthe town of Dreux; also of a wonderful Mausoleum there, not equally\r\ninteresting.  The little man was in deeper gloom than a day sobering on\r\ncrimson dusk when the train stopped and his quick ear caught the sound of\r\nthe station, as pronounced by his friend at Rouen.\r\n\r\nHe handed his card to the station-master.  A glance, and the latter\r\nsignalled to a porter, saying: 'Paradis'; and the porter laid hold of\r\nSkepsey's bag.  Skepsey's grasp was firm; he pulled, the porter pulled.\r\nSkepsey heard explanatory speech accompanying a wrench.  He wrenched back\r\nwith vigour, and in his own tongue exclaimed, that he held to the bag\r\nbecause his master's letters were in the bag, all the way from England.\r\nFor a minute, there was a downright trial of muscle and will: the porter\r\nappeared furiously excited, Skepsey had a look of cooled steel.  Then the\r\nFrenchman, requiring to shrug, gave way to the Englishman's eccentric\r\nobstinacy, and signified that he was his guide.  Quite so, and Skepsey\r\nshowed alacrity and confidence in following; he carried his bag.  But\r\nwith the remembrance of the kindly serviceable man at Rouen, he sought to\r\nconvey to the porter, that the terms of their association were cordial.\r\nA waving of the right hand to the heavens ratified the treaty on the\r\nFrench side.  Nods and smiles and gesticulations, with across-Channel\r\nvocables, as it were Dover cliffs to Calais sands and back, pleasantly\r\nbeguiled the way down to the Hotel du Paradis, under the Mausoleum\r\nheights, where Skepsey fumbled at his pocket for coin current; but the\r\nFrenchman, all shaken by a tornado of negation, clapped him on the\r\nshoulder, and sang him a quatrain.  Skepsey had in politeness to stand\r\nlistening, and blinking, plunged in the contrition of ignorance,\r\neclipsed.  He took it to signify something to the effect, that money\r\nshould not pass between friends.  It was the amatory farewell address of\r\nHenri IV. to his Charmante Gabrielle; and with\r\n\r\n                        'Perce de mille lords,\r\n                         L'honneur m'appelle\r\n                         Au champ de Mars,'\r\n\r\nthe Frenchman, in a backing of measured steps, apologized for his\r\nenforced withdrawal from the stranger who had captured his heart.\r\n\r\nSkepsey's card was taken in the passage of the hotel.  A clean-capped\r\nmaid, brave on the legs, like all he had seen of these people, preceded\r\nhim at quick march to an upper chamber.  When he descended, bag in hand,\r\nshe flung open the salon-door of a table d'hote, where a goodly number\r\nwere dining and chattering; waiters drew him along to the section\r\noccupied by his master's party.  A chair had been kept vacant for him;\r\nhis master waved a hand, his dear ladies graciously smiled; he struck the\r\nbag in front of a guardian foot, growing happy.  He could fancy they had\r\nnot seen the English newspapers.  And his next observation of the table\r\nshowed him wrecked and lost: Miss Nesta's face was the oval of a woeful O\r\nat his wild behaviour in England during their absence.  She smiled.\r\nSkepsey had nevertheless to consume his food--excellent, very tasty soup-\r\nwith the sour sauce of the thought that he must be tongue-tied in his\r\ndefence for the time of the dinner.\r\n\r\n'No, dear Skips, please! you are to enjoy yourself,' said Nesta.\r\n\r\nHe answered confusedly, trying to assure her that he was doing so,\r\nand he choked.\r\n\r\nHis master had fixed his arrival for twenty minutes earlier.  Skepsey\r\nspoke through a cough of long delays at stations.  The Rev. Septimus\r\nBarmby, officially peacemaker, sounded the consequent excuse for a\r\nbelated comer.  It was final; such is the power of sound.  Looks were\r\ncast from the French section of the table at the owner of the prodigious\r\norgan.  Some of the younger men, intent on the charms of Albion's\r\ndaughters, expressed in a, sign and a word or two alarm at what might be\r\nbeneath the flooring: and 'Pas encore Lui!' and 'Son avant-courrier!' and\r\nother flies of speech passed on a whiff, under politest of cover, not to\r\ngive offence.  But prodigies, claim attention.\r\n\r\nOur English, at the close of the dinner, consented to say it was good,\r\nwithout specifying a dish, because a selection of this or that would have\r\nseemed to italicize, and commit, them, in the presence of ladies, to a\r\nnotice of the matter of-course, beneath us, or the confession of a low\r\nsensual enjoyment; until Lady Grace Halley named the particular dressing\r\nof a tete de veau approvingly to Victor; and he stating, that he had\r\noffered a suggestion for the menu of the day, Nataly exclaimed, that she\r\nhad suspected it: upon which Mr. Sowerby praised the menu, Mr. Barmby,\r\nPeridon and Catkin named other dishes, there was the right after-dinner\r\nring in Victor's ears, thanks to the woman of the world who had travelled\r\nround to nature and led the shackled men to deliver themselves heartily.\r\nOne tap, and they are free.  That is, in the moments after dinner, when\r\nnature is at the gates with them.  Only, it must be a lady and a\r\nprevailing lady to give the tap.  They need (our English) and will for\r\nthe ages of the process of their transformation need a queen.\r\n\r\nSkepsey, bag in hand, obeyed the motion of his master's head and followed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe was presently back, to remain with the ladies during his master's\r\nperusal of letters.  Nataly had decreed that he was not to be troubled;\r\nso Nesta and mademoiselle besought him for a recital of his French\r\nadventures; and strange to say, he had nothing to tell.  The journey,\r\npregnant at the start, exciting in the course of it, was absolutely blank\r\nat the termination.  French people had been very kind; he could not say\r\nmore.  But there was more; there was a remarkable fulness, if only he\r\ncould subordinate it to narrative.  The little man did not know, that\r\ntime was wanted for imagination to make the roadway or riverway of a true\r\nstory, unless we press to invent; his mind had been too busy on the way\r\nfor him to clothe in speech his impressions of the passage of incidents\r\nat the call for them.  Things had happened, numbers of interesting minor\r\nthings, but they all slipped as water through the fingers; and he being\r\nof the band of honest creatures who will not accept a lift from fiction,\r\ndrearily he sat before the ladies, confessing to an emptiness he was far\r\nfrom feeling.\r\n\r\nNesta professed excessive disappointment.  'Now, if it had been in\r\nEngland, Skips!' she said, under her mother's gentle gloom of brows.\r\n\r\nHe made show of melancholy submission.\r\n\r\n'There, Skepsey, you have a good excuse, we are sure,' Nataly said.\r\n\r\nAnd women, when they are such ladies as these, are sent to prove to us\r\nthat they can be a blessing; instead of the dreadful cry to Providence\r\nfor the reason of the spread of the race of man by their means!  He\r\ndeclared his readiness, rejecting excuses, to state his case to them, but\r\nfor his fear of having it interpreted as an appeal for their kind aid in\r\nobtaining his master's forgiveness.  Mr. Durance had very considerately\r\npromised to intercede.  Skepsey dropped a hint or two of his naughty\r\nproceedings drily aware that their untutored antipathy to the manly art\r\nwould not permit of warmth.\r\n\r\nNesta said: 'Do you know, Skips, we saw a grand exhibition of fencing in\r\nParis.'\r\n\r\nHe sighed.  'Ladies can look on at fencing!  foils and masks!  Captain\r\nDartrey Fenellan has shown me, and says, the French are our masters at\r\nit.'  He bowed constrainedly to mademoiselle.\r\n\r\n'You box, M. Skepsey!' she said.\r\n\r\nHis melancholy increased: 'Much discouragement from Government, Society!\r\nIf ladies .  .  .  but I do not venture.  They are not against Games.\r\nBut these are not a protection .  .  .  to them, when needed; to the\r\ncountry.  The country seems asleep to its position.  Mr. Durance has\r\nremarked on it:--though I would not always quote Mr. Durance .  .  .\r\nindeed, he says, that England has invested an Old Maid's All in the\r\nMillennium, and is ruined if it delays to come.  \"Old Maid,\" I do not\r\nsee.  I do not--if I may presume to speak of myself in the same breath\r\nwith so clever a gentleman, agree with Mr. Durance in everything.  But\r\nthe chest-measurement of recruits, the stature of the men enlisted, prove\r\nthat we are losing the nursery of our soldiers.'\r\n\r\n'We are taking them out of the nursery, Skips, if you 're for quoting\r\nCaptain Dartrey,' said Nesta.  'We'll never haul down our flag, though,\r\nwhile we have him!'\r\n\r\n'Ah!  Captain Dartrey!' Skepsey was refreshed by the invocation of the\r\nname.\r\n\r\nA summons to his master's presence cut short something he was beginning\r\nto say about Captain Dartrey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nACCOUNTS FOR SKEPSEY'S MISCONDUCT, SHOWING HOW IT AFFECTED NATALY\r\n\r\nHis master opened on the bristling business.\r\n\r\n'What's this, of your name in the papers, your appearing before a\r\nmagistrate, and a fine?  Tell the tale shortly.'\r\n\r\nSkepsey fell upon his attitude for dialectical defence the modest form of\r\nthe two hands at rolling play and the head deferentially sidecast.  But\r\nknowing that he had gratified his personal tastes in the act of serving\r\nhis master's interests, an interfusion of sentiments plunged him into\r\nself-consciousness; an unwonted state with him, clogging to a simple\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n'First, sir, I would beg you to pardon the printing of your name beside\r\nmine .  .  .'\r\n\r\n'Tush: on with you.'\r\n\r\n'Only to say, necessitated by the circumstances of the case.  I read,\r\nthat there was laughter in the court at my exculpation of my conduct--\r\nas I have to call it; and there may have been.  I may have expressed\r\nmyself .  .  .  .  I have a strong feeling for the welfare of the\r\ncountry.'\r\n\r\n'So, it seems, you said to the magistrate.  Do you tell me, that the\r\ncause of your gross breach of the law, was a consideration for the\r\nwelfare of the country?  Run on the facts.'\r\n\r\n'The facts--I must have begun badly, sir.'  Skepsey rattled the dry facts\r\nin his head to right them.  From his not having begun well, they had\r\nbecome dry as things underfoot.  It was an error to have led off with the\r\nsentiments.  'Two very, two very respectable persons--respectable--were\r\ndesirous to witness a short display of my, my system, I would say; of my\r\nscience, they call it.'\r\n\r\n'Don't be nervous.  To the point; you went into a field five miles out of\r\nLondon, in broad day, and stood in a ring, the usual Tiff-raff about\r\nyou!'\r\n\r\n'With the gloves: and not for money, Sir: for the trial of skill; not\r\nvery many people.  I cannot quite see the breach of the law.'\r\n\r\n'So you told the magistrate.  You were fined for your inability to quite\r\nsee.  And you had to give security.'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Durance was kindly responsible for me, sir: an acquaintance of the\r\nmagistrate.'\r\n\r\n'This boxing of yours is a positive mania, Skepsey.  You must try to get\r\nthe better of it--must!  And my name too!  I'm to be proclaimed, as\r\nhaving in my service an inveterate pugilist--who breaks the law from\r\npatriotism!  Male or female, these very respectable persons--the people\r\nyour show was meant for?'\r\n\r\n'Male, sir.  Females!  .  .  .  that is, not the respectable ones.'\r\n\r\n'Take the opinion of the respectable ones for your standard of behaviour\r\nin future.'\r\n\r\n'It was a mere trial of skill, sir, to prove to one of the spectators,\r\nthat I could be as good as my word.  I wished I may say, to conciliate\r\nhim, partly.  He would not--he judged by size--credit me with .  .  .\r\nhe backed my adversary Jerry Scroom--a sturdy boxer, without the\r\nknowledge of the first principles.'\r\n\r\n'You beat him?'\r\n\r\n'I think I taught the man that I could instruct, sir; he was\r\ncomplimentary before we parted.  He thought I could not have lasted.\r\nAfter the second round, the police appeared.'\r\n\r\n'And you ran!'\r\n\r\n'No, sir; I had nothing on my conscience.'\r\n\r\n'Why not have had your pugilistic display in a publican's room in town,\r\nwhere you could have hammer-nailed and ding-donged to your heart's\r\ncontent for as long as you liked!'\r\n\r\n'That would have been preferable, from the point of view of safety from\r\nintrusion, I can admit-speaking humbly.  But one of the parties--I had a\r\nwish to gratify him--is a lover of old English times and habits and our\r\ncountry scenes.  He wanted it to take place on green grass.  We drove\r\nover Hampstead in three carts and a gig, as a company of pleasure--as it\r\nwas.  A very beautiful morning.  There was a rest at a public-house.  Mr.\r\nShaplow traces the misfortune to that.  Mr. Jarniman, I hear, thinks it\r\nwhat he calls a traitor in the camp.  I saw no sign; we were all merry\r\nand friendly.'\r\n\r\n'Jarniman?' said Victor sharply.  'Who is the Jarniman?'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Jarniman is, I am to understand from the acquaintance introducing\r\nus--a Mr. Shaplow I met in the train from Lakelands one day, and again at\r\nthe corner of a street near Drury Lane, a ham and beef shop kept by a\r\nMrs. Jarniman, a very stout lady, who does the chief carving in the shop,\r\nand is the mother of Mr. Jarniman: he is in a confidential place, highly\r\ntrusted.'  Skepsey looked up from the hands he soaped: 'He is a curious\r\nmixture; he has true enthusiasm for boxing, he believes in ghosts.  He\r\nmourns for the lost days of prize-fighting, he thinks that spectres are\r\non the increase.  He has a very large appetite, depressed spirits.  Mr.\r\nShaplow informs me he is a man of substance, in the service of a wealthy\r\nlady in poor health, expecting a legacy and her appearance to him.  He\r\nhas the look--Mr. Shaplow assures me he does not drink to excess: he is a\r\nslow drinker.'\r\n\r\nVictor straightened: 'Bad way of health, you said?'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Jarniman spoke of his expectations, as being immediate: he put it,\r\nthat he expected her spirit to be out for him to meet it any day--or\r\nnight.  He desires it.  He says, she has promised it--on oath, he says,\r\nand must feel that she must do her duty to him before she goes, if she is\r\nto appear to him with any countenance after.  But he is anxious for her\r\nin any case to show herself, and says, he should not have the heart to\r\nreproach her.  He has principles, a tear for suffering; he likes to be\r\nmade to cry.  Mrs. Jarniman, his mother, he is not married, is much the\r\nsame so far, except ghosts; she will not have them; except after strong\r\ntea, they come, she says, come to her bed.  She is foolish enough to\r\nsleep in a close-curtained bed.  But the poor lady is so exceedingly\r\nstout that a puff of cold would carry her off, she fears.'\r\n\r\nVictor stamped his foot.  'This man Jarniman serves a lady now in a--\r\nserious, does he say?  Was he precise?'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Jarniman spoke of a remarkable number of diseases; very complicated,\r\nhe says.  He has no opinion of doctors.  He says, that the lady's doctor\r\nand the chemist--she sits in a chemist's shop and swallows other people's\r\nprescriptions that take her fancy.  He says, her continuing to live is\r\nwonderful.  He has no reason to hurry her, only for the satisfaction of a\r\nnatural curiosity.'\r\n\r\n'He mentioned her name?'\r\n\r\n'No name, sir.'\r\n\r\nSkepsey's limpid grey eyes confirmed the negative to Victor, who was\r\nassured that the little man stood clean of any falsity.\r\n\r\n'You are not on equal terms.  You and the magistrate have helped him to\r\nknow who it is you serve, Skepsey.'\r\n\r\n'Would you please to direct me, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Another time.  Now go and ease your feet with a run over the town.  We\r\nhave music in half an hour.  That you like, I know.  See chiefly to\r\namusing yourself.'\r\n\r\nSkepsey turned to go; he murmured, that he had enjoyed his trip.\r\n\r\nVictor checked him: it was to ask whether this Jarniman had specified\r\none, any one of the numerous diseases afflicting his aged mistress.\r\n\r\nNow Jarniman had shocked Skepsey with his blunt titles for a couple of\r\nthe foremost maladies assailing the poor lady's decayed constitution: not\r\nto be mentioned, Skepsey's thought, in relation to ladies; whose organs\r\nand functions we, who pay them a proper homage by restricting them to the\r\nsphere so worthily occupied by their mothers up to the very oldest date,\r\nrespectfully curtain; their accepted masters are chivalrous to them,\r\ndeploring their need at times for the doctors and drugs.  He stood\r\nlooking most unhappy.  'She was to appear, sir, in a few--perhaps a week,\r\na month.'\r\n\r\nA nod dismissed him.\r\n\r\nThe fun of the expedition (and Dudley Sowerby had wound himself up to\r\nrelish it) was at night in the towns, when the sound of instrumental and\r\nvocal music attracted crowds beneath the windows of the hotel, and they\r\nheard zon, zon, violon, fete et basse; not bad fluting, excellent\r\nfiddling, such singing as a maestro, conducting his own Opera, would have\r\napproved.  So Victor said of his darlings' voices.  Nesta's and her\r\nmother's were a perfect combination; Mr. Barmby's trompe in union,\r\nsufficiently confirmed the popular impression, that they were artistes.\r\nThey had been ceremoniously ushered to their carriages, with expressions\r\nof gratitude, at the departure from Rouen; and the Boniface at Gisors had\r\nentreated them to stay another night, to give an entertainment.  Victor\r\ntook his pleasure in letting it be known, that they were a quiet English\r\nfamily, simply keeping-up the habits they practiced in Old England: all\r\nwere welcome to hear them while they were doing it; but they did not give\r\nentertainments.\r\n\r\nThe pride of the pleasure of reversing the general idea of English\r\ndulness among our neighbours, was perceived to have laid fast hold of\r\nDudley Sowerby at Dreux.  He was at the window from time to time,\r\ncounting heads below.  For this reason or a better, he begged Nesta to\r\nsupplant the flute duet with the soprano and contralto of the Helena\r\nsection of the Mefistofele, called the Serenade: La Luna immobile.  She\r\nconsulted her mother, and they sang it.  The crowds below, swollen to a\r\nblock of the street, were dead still, showing the instinctive good\r\nmanners of the people.  Then mademoiselle astonished them with a\r\nProvencal or Cevennes air, Huguenot, though she was Catholic; but it\r\nsuited her mezzo-soprano tones; and it rang massively of the martial-\r\nreligious.  To what heights of spiritual grandeur might not a Huguenot\r\nFrance have marched!  Dudley Sowerby, heedlessly, under an emotion that\r\ncould be stirred in him with force, by the soul of religion issuing\r\nthrough music, addressed his ejaculation to Lady Grace Halley.  She did\r\nnor shrug or snub him, but rejoined: 'I could go to battle with that song\r\nin the ears.'  She liked seeing him so happily transformed; and liked the\r\neffect of it on Nesta when his face shone in talking.  He was at home\r\nwith the girl's eyes, as he had never been.  A song expressing in one of\r\nthe combative and devotional, went to the springs of his blood; for he\r\nwas of an old warrior race, beneath the thick crust of imposed peaceful\r\nmaxims and commercial pursuits and habitual stiff correctness.  As much\r\nas wine, will music bring out the native bent of the civilized man: endow\r\nhim with language too.  He was as if unlocked; he met Nesta's eyes and\r\nran in a voluble interchange, that gave him flattering after-thoughts;\r\nand at the moment sensibly a new and assured, or to some extent assured,\r\nstation beside a girl so vivid; by which the young lady would be helped\r\nto perceive his unvoiced solider gifts.\r\n\r\nNataly observed them, thinking of Victor's mastering subtlety.  She had\r\nhoped (having clearly seen the sheep's eye in the shepherd) that Mr.\r\nBarmby would be watchful to act as a block between them; and therefore\r\nshe had stipulated for his presence on the journey.  She remembered\r\nVictor's rapid look of readiness to consent:--he reckoned how naturally\r\nMr. Barmby would serve as a foil to any younger man.  Mr. Barmby had\r\ntried all along to perform his part: he had always been thwarted; notably\r\nonce at Gisors, where by some cunning management he and mademoiselle\r\nfound themselves in the cell of the prisoner's Nail-wrought work while\r\nNesta had to take Sowerby's hand for help at a passage here and there\r\nalong the narrow outer castle-walls.  And Mr. Barmby, upon occasions, had\r\nset that dimple in Nesta's cheek quivering, though Simeon Fenellan was\r\nnot at hand, and there was no telling how it was done, beyond the\r\nevidence that Victor willed it so.\r\n\r\nFrom the day of the announcement of Lakelands, she had been brought more\r\ninto contact with his genius of dexterity and foresight than ever\r\npreviously: she had bent to the burden of it more; had seen herself and\r\neverybody else outstripped--herself, of course; she did not count in a\r\nstruggle with him.  But since that red dawn of Lakelands, it was almost\r\nas if he had descended to earth from the skies.  She now saw his\r\nmortality in the miraculous things he did.  The reason of it was, that\r\nthrough the perceptible various arts and shifts on her level, an opposing\r\nspirit had plainer view of his aim, to judge it.  She thought it a mean\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe power it had to hurry her with the strength of a torrent to an end\r\nshe dreaded, impressed her physically; so far subduing her mind, in\r\nconsequence, as to keep the idea of absolute resistance obscure, though\r\nher bosom heaved with the breath; but what was her own of a mind hung\r\nhovering above him, criticizing; and involuntarily, discomfortingly.\r\nShe could have prayed to be led blindly or blindly dashed on: she could\r\ntrust him for success; and her critical mind seemed at times a treachery.\r\nStill she was compelled to judge.\r\n\r\nWhen he said to her at night, pressing both her hands: 'This is the news\r\nof the day, my love!  It's death at last.  We shall soon be thanking\r\nheaven for freedom'; her fingers writhed upon his and gripped them in a\r\ntorture of remorse on his behalf.  A shattering throb of her heart gave\r\nher sight of herself as well.  For so it is with the woman who loves in\r\nsubjection, she may be a critic of the man, she is his accomplice.'\r\n\r\n'You have a letter, Victor?'\r\n\r\n'Confirmation all round: Fenellan, Themison, and now Skepsey.'\r\n\r\nHe told her the tale of Skepsey and Jarniman, colouring it, as any\r\ninterested animated conduit necessarily will.  Neither of them smiled.\r\n\r\nThe effort to think soberly exhausted and rolled her back on credulity.\r\n\r\nIt might not be to-day or next week or month: but so much testimony\r\npointed to a day within the horizon, surely!\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head to heaven for forgiveness.  The murderous hope stood\r\nup, stood out in forms and pictures.  There was one of a woman at her\r\nease at last in the reception of guests; contrasting with an ironic\r\nhaunting figure of the woman of queenly air and stature under a finger of\r\nscorn for a bold-faced impostor.  Nataly's lips twitched at the\r\nremembrance of quaint whimpers of complaint to the Fates, for directing\r\nthat a large instead of a rather diminutive woman should be the social\r\noffender fearing exposure.  Majesty in the criminal's dock, is a\r\nconfounding spectacle.  To the bosom of the majestic creature, all her\r\nglorious attributes have become the executioner's implements.  She must\r\nfor her soul's health believe that a day of release and exoneration\r\napproaches.\r\n\r\n'Barmby!--if my dear girl would like him best,' Victor said, in tenderest\r\nundertones, observing the shadowing variations of her face; and pierced\r\nher cruelly, past explanation or understanding;--not that she would have\r\nobjected to the Rev. Septimus as officiating clergyman.\r\n\r\nShe nodded.  Down rolled the first big tear.\r\n\r\nWe cry to women; Land, ho!--a land of palms after storms at sea; and at\r\nonce they inundate us with a deluge of eye-water.\r\n\r\n'Half a minute, dear Victor, not longer,' Nataly said, weeping, near on\r\nlaughing over his look of wanton abandonment to despair at sight of her\r\ntears.  'Don't mind me.  I am rather like Fenellan's laundress, the\r\ntearful woman whose professional apparatus was her soft heart and a cake\r\nof soap.  Skepsey has made his peace with you?'\r\n\r\nVictor answered: 'Yes, yes; I see what he has been about.  We're a mixed\r\nlot, all of us-the best!  You've noticed, Skepsey has no laugh: however\r\nabsurd the thing he tells you, not a smile!'\r\n\r\n'But you trust his eyes; you look fathoms into them.  Captain Dartrey\r\nthinks him one of the men most in earnest of any of his country.'\r\n\r\n'So Nataly of course thinks the same.  And he's a worthy little\r\nvelocipede, as Fenellan calls him.  One wishes Colney had been with us.\r\nOnly Colney!--pity one can't cut his talons for the space before they\r\ngrow again.'\r\n\r\nAy, and in the presence of Colney Durance, Victor would not have been so\r\nencouraging, half boyishly caressing, with Dudley Sowerby!  It was the\r\nvery manner to sow seed of imitativeness in the girl, devoted as she was\r\nto her father.  Nataly sighed, foreseeing evil, owning it a superstition,\r\nfeeling it a certainty.  We are easily prophets, sure of being justified,\r\nwhen the cleverness of schemes devoted to material ends appears most\r\ndelicately perfect.  History, the tales of households, the tombstone, are\r\nwith us to inspire.  In Nataly's bosom, the reproof of her inefficiency\r\nfor offering counsel where Victor for his soul's sake needed it, was\r\nbeginning to thunder at whiles as a reproach of unfittingness in his\r\nmate, worse than a public denunciation of the sin against Society.\r\n\r\nIt might be decreed that she and Society were to come to reconcilement.\r\nA pain previously thought of, never previously so realized, seized her at\r\nher next sight of Nesta.  She had not taken in her front mind the\r\ncontrast of the innocent one condemned to endure the shadow from which\r\nthe guilty was by a transient ceremony released.  Nature could at a push\r\nbe eloquent to defend the guilty.  Not a word of vindicating eloquence\r\nrose up to clear the innocent.  Nothing that she could do; no\r\ndevotedness, not any sacrifice, and no treaty of peace, no possible joy\r\nto come, nothing could remove the shadow from her child.  She dreamed of\r\nthe succour in eloquence, to charm the ears of chosen juries while a fact\r\nspoke over the population, with a relentless rolling out of its one hard\r\nword.  But eloquence, powerful on her behalf, was dumb when referred to\r\nNesta.  It seemed a cruel mystery.  How was it permitted by the Merciful\r\nDisposer!  .  .  .  Nataly's intellect and her reverence clashed.  They\r\nclash to the end of time if we persist in regarding the Spirit of Life as\r\na remote Externe, who plays the human figures, to bring about this or\r\nthat issue, instead of being beside us, within us, our breath, if we\r\nwill; marking on us where at each step we sink to the animal, mount to\r\nthe divine, we and ours who follow, offspring of body or mind.  She was\r\nin her error, from judgeing of the destiny of man by the fate of\r\nindividuals.  Chiefly her error was, to try to be thinking at all amid\r\nthe fevered tangle of her sensations.\r\n\r\nA darkness fell upon the troubled woman, and was thicker overhead when\r\nher warm blood had drawn her to some acceptance of the philosophy of\r\nexistence, in a savour of gratification at the prospect of her equal\r\nfooting with the world while yet she lived.  She hated herself for taking\r\npleasure in anything to be bestowed by a world so hap-hazard, ill-\r\nbalanced, unjust; she took it bitterly, with such naturalness as not to\r\nbe aware that it was irony and a poisonous irony moving her to welcome\r\nthe restorative ceremony because her largeness of person had a greater\r\nthan common need of the protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nCHIEFLY UPON THE THEME OF A YOUNG MAID'S IMAGININGS\r\n\r\nThat Mausoleum at Dreux may touch to lift us.  History, pleads for the\r\npride of the great discrowned Family giving her illumination there.  The\r\npride is reverently postured, the princely mourning-cloak it wears\r\nbecomingly braided at the hem with fair designs of our mortal humility in\r\nthe presence of the vanquisher; against whom, acknowledgeing a visible\r\nconquest of the dust, it sustains a placid contention in coloured glass\r\nand marbles.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Seilles, a fervid Orleanist, was thanked for having\r\nadvised the curvature of the route homeward to visit 'the spot of so\r\nimpressive a monument': as it, was phrased by the Rev. Septimus Barmby;\r\nwhose exposition to Nesta of the beautiful stained-glass pictures of\r\nincidents in the life of the crusading St. Louis, was toned to be\r\nlikewise impressive:--Colney Durance not being at hand to bewail the\r\npathos of his exhaustless 'whacking of the platitudes'; which still\r\nretain their tender parts, but cry unheard when there is no cynic near.\r\nMr. Barmby laid-on solemnly.\r\n\r\nProfessional devoutness is deemed more righteous on such occasions than\r\npoetic fire.  It robes us in the cloak of the place, as at a funeral.\r\nGenerally, Mr. Barmby found, and justly, that it is in superior\r\nestimation among his countrymen of all classes.  They are shown by\r\nexample how to look, think, speak; what to do.  Poets are disturbing;\r\nthey cannot be comfortably imitated, they are unsafe, not certainly the\r\nmetal, unless you have Laureates, entitled to speak by their pay and\r\ndecorations; and these are but one at a time-and a quotation may remind\r\nus of a parody, to convulse the sacred dome!  Established plain prose\r\nofficials do better for our English.  The audience moved round with heads\r\nof undertakers.\r\n\r\nVictor called to recollection Fenellan's 'Rev. Glendoveer' while Mr.\r\nBarmby pursued his discourse, uninterrupted by tripping wags.  And those\r\nwho have schemes, as well as those who are startled by the criticism in\r\nlaughter to discover that they have cause for shunning it, rejoice when\r\nwits are absent.  Mr. Sowerby and Nesta interchanged a comment on Mr.\r\nBarmby's remarks: The Fate of Princes!  The Paths of Glory!  St. Louis\r\nwas a very distant Roman Catholic monarch; and the young gentleman of\r\nEvangelical education could admire him as a Crusader.  St. Louis was for\r\nNesta a figure in the rich hues of royal Saintship softened to homeliness\r\nby tears.  She doated on a royalty crowned with the Saint's halo, that\r\nswam down to us to lift us through holy human showers.  She listened to\r\nMr. Barmby, hearing few sentences, lending his eloquence all she felt:\r\nhe rolled forth notes of a minster organ, accordant with the devotional\r\nservice she was holding mutely.  Mademoiselle upon St. Louis: 'Worthy to\r\nbe named King of Kings!' swept her to a fount of thoughts, where the\r\nthoughts are not yet shaped, are yet in the breast of the mother\r\nemotions.  Louise de Seilles had prepared her to be strangely and deeply\r\nmoved.  The girl had a heart of many strings, of high pitch, open to be\r\nmusical to simplest wandering airs or to the gales.  This crypt of the\r\nrecumbent sculptured figures and the coloured series of acts in the\r\npassage of the crowned Saint thrilled her as with sight of flame on an\r\naltar-piece of History.  But this King in the lines of the Crucifixion\r\nleading, gave her a lesson of life, not a message from death.  With such\r\na King, there would be union of the old order and the new, cessation to\r\npolitical turmoil: Radicalism, Socialism, all the monster names of things\r\nwith heads agape in these our days to gobble-up the venerable, obliterate\r\nthe beautiful, leave a stoniness of floods where field and garden were,\r\nwould be appeased, transfigured.  She hoped, she prayed for that glorious\r\nleader's advent.\r\n\r\nOn one subject, conceived by her only of late, and not intelligibly, not\r\ncommunicably: a subject thickly veiled; one which struck at her through\r\nher sex and must, she thought, ever be unnamed (the ardent young creature\r\nsaw it as a very thing torn by the winds to show hideous gleams of a body\r\nrageing with fire behind the veil): on this one subject, her hopes and\r\nprayers were dumb in her bosom.  It signified shame.  She knew not the\r\nhow, for she had no power to contemplate it: there was a torment of earth\r\nand a writhing of lurid dust-clouds about it at a glimpse.  But if the\r\nnew crusading Hero were to come attacking that--if some born prince nobly\r\nman would head the world to take away the withering scarlet from the face\r\nof women, she felt she could kiss the print of his feet upon the ground.\r\nMeanwhile she had enjoyment of her plunge into the inmost forest-well of\r\nmediaeval imaginativeness, where youthful minds of good aspiration\r\nthrough their obscurities find much akin to them.\r\n\r\nShe had an eye for little Skepsey too: unaware that these French Princes\r\nhad hurried him off to Agincourt, for another encounter with them and the\r\nold result--poor dear gentlemen, with whom we do so wish to be friendly!\r\nWhat amused her was, his evident fatigue in undergoing the slow parade,\r\nand sheer deference to his betters, as to the signification of a holiday\r\non arrested legs.  Dudley Sowerby's attention to him, in elucidating the\r\nscenes with historical scraps, greatly pleased her.  The Rev. Septimus of\r\ncourse occupied her chiefly.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle was always near, to receive his repeated expressions of\r\ngratitude for the route she had counselled.  Without personal objections\r\nto a well-meaning orderly man, whose pardonable error it was to be aiming\r\ntoo considerably higher than his head, she did but show him the voluble\r\nmuteness of a Frenchwoman's closed lips; not a smile at all, and\r\ncertainly no sign of hostility; when bowing to his reiterated compliment\r\nin the sentence of French.  Mr. Barmby had noticed (and a strong\r\nsentiment rendered him observant, unwontedly) a similar alert immobility\r\nof her lips, indicating foreign notions of this kind or that, in England:\r\nan all but imperceptible shortening or loss of corners at the mouth, upon\r\nmention of marriages of his clergy: particularly once, at his reading of\r\na lengthy report in a newspaper of a Wedding Ceremony involving his\r\nfavourite Bishop for bridegroom: a report to make one glow like Hymen\r\nrollicking the Torch after draining the bumper to the flying slipper.\r\nHe remembered the look, and how it seemed to intensify on the slumbering\r\nfeatures, at a statement, that his Bishop was a widower, entering into\r\nnuptials in his fifty-fourth year.  Why not?  But we ask it of Heaven and\r\nMan, why not?  Mademoiselle was pleasant: she was young or youngish; her\r\nown clergy were celibates, and--no, he could not argue the matter with a\r\nyoung or youngish person of her sex.  Could it be a reasonable woman--\r\na woman!--who, disapproved the holy nuptials of the pastors of the\r\nflocks?  But we are forbidden to imagine the conducting of an argument\r\nthereon with a lady.\r\n\r\nLuther .  .  .  but we are not in Luther's time:--Nature .  .  .  no,\r\nnor can there possibly be allusions to Nature.  Mr. Barmby wondered at\r\nProtestant parents taking a Papistical governess for their young flower\r\nof English womanhood.  However, she venerated St. Louis; he cordially\r\nalso; there they met; and he admitted, that she had, for a Frenchwoman,\r\na handsome face, and besides an agreeably artificial ingenuousness in\r\nthe looks which could be so politely dubious as to appear only dubiously\r\nadverse.\r\n\r\nThe spell upon Nesta was not blown away on English ground; and when her\r\nfather and mother were comparing their impressions, she could not but\r\nkeep guard over the deeper among her own.  At the Chateau de Gisors,\r\nleftward off Vernon on Seine, it had been one of romance and wonderment,\r\nwith inquisitive historic soundings of her knowledge and mademoiselle's,\r\na reverence for the prisoner's patient holy work, and picturings of his\r\nwatchful waiting daily, Nail in hand, for the heaven-sent sunlight on the\r\ncircular dungeon-wall through the slits of the meurtrieres.  But the\r\nMausoleum at Dreux spake religiously; it enfolded Mr. Barmby, his voice\r\nre-edified it.  The fact that he had discoursed there, though not a word\r\nof the discourse was remembered, allied him to the spirit of a day rather\r\nincreasing in sacredness as it receded and left her less the possessor of\r\nit, more the worshipper.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle had to say to herself: 'Impossible!' after seeing the drift\r\nof her dear Nesta's eyes in the wake of the colossal English clergyman.\r\nShe fed her incredulousness indignantly on the evidence confounding it.\r\nNataly was aware of unusual intonations, treble-stressed, in the Bethesda\r\nand the Galilee of Mr. Barmby on Concert evenings: as it were, the\r\ntowering wood-work of the cathedral organ in quake under emission of its\r\nmultitudinous outroar.  The 'Which?' of the Rev. Septimus, addressed to\r\nNesta, when song was demanded of him; and her 'Either'; and his gentle\r\nhesitation, upon a gaze at her for the directing choice, could not be\r\nunnoticed by women.\r\n\r\nDid he know a certain thing?--and dream of urging the suit, as an\r\nindulgent skipper of parental pages?\r\n\r\nSuch haunting interrogations were the conspirators' daggers out at any\r\ninstant, or leaping in sheath, against Nataly's peace of mind.  But she\r\ntrusted her girl's laughing side to rectify any little sentimental\r\noverbalancing.  She left the ground where maternal meditations are\r\nserious, at an image of Mr. Barmby knocking at Nesta's heart as a lover.\r\nWas it worth inquiry?\r\n\r\nA feminine look was trailed across the eyes of mademoiselle, with mention\r\nof Mr. Barmby's name.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle rippled her shoulders.  'We are at present much enamoured of\r\nBethesda.'\r\n\r\nThat watchfullest showing no alarm, the absurdity of the suspicion\r\nsmothered it.\r\n\r\nNataly had moreover to receive startling new guests:\r\n\r\nLady Rodwell Blachington: Mrs. Fanning, wife of the General: young Mrs.\r\nBlathenoy, wife of the great bill-broker: ladies of Wrensham and about.\r\nAnd it was a tasking of her energies equal to the buffeting of recurrent\r\nwaves on deep sea.  The ladies were eager for her entry into Lakelands.\r\nShe heard that Victor had appointed Lady Blachington's third son to the\r\ncoveted post of clerk in the Indian house of Inchling and Radnor.  These\r\nare the deluge days when even aristocracy will cry blessings on the man\r\nwho procures a commercial appointment for one of its younger sons\r\noffended and rebutted by the barrier of Examinations for the Civil\r\nService.  'To have our Adolphus under Mr. Victor Radnor's protection, is\r\na step!' Lady Blachington said.  Nataly was in an atmosphere of hints and\r\nrevealings.  There were City Dinners, to which one or other of the\r\nresidents about Lakelands had been taken before he sat at Victor's London\r\ntable.  He was already winning his way, apparently without effort, to be\r\nthe popular man of that neighbourhood.  A subterranean tide or a slipping\r\nof earth itself seemed bearing her on.  She had his promise indeed, that\r\nhe would not ask of her to enter Lakelands until the day of his freedom\r\nhad risen; but though she could trust to his word, the heart of the word\r\nwent out of it when she heard herself thanked by Lady Blachington (who\r\ncould so well excuse her at such a time of occupation for not returning\r\nher call, that she called in a friendly way a second time, warmly to\r\nthank her) for throwing open the Concert room at Lakelands in August, to\r\nan Entertainment in assistance of the funds for the purpose of erecting\r\nan East of London Clubhouse, where the children of the poor by day could\r\nplay, and their parents pass a disengaged evening.  Doubtless a worthy\r\nCharity.  Nataly was alive to the duties of wealth.  Had it been simply a\r\ndemand for a donation, she would not have shown that momentary pucker of\r\nthe brows, which Lady Blachington read as a contrast with the generous\r\nvivacity of the husband.\r\n\r\nNataly read a leaf of her fate in this announcement.  Nay, she beheld\r\nherself as the outer world wexedly beholds a creature swung along to the\r\ndoing of things against the better mind.  An outer world is thoughtless\r\nof situations which prepare us to meet the objectionable with a will\r\nbenumbed;--if we do not, as does that outer world, belong to the party of\r\nthe readily heroical.  She scourged her weakness: and the intimation of\r\nthe truth stood over her, more than ever manifest, that the deficiency\r\naffecting her character lay in her want of language.  A tongue to speak\r\nand contend, would have helped her to carve a clearer way.  But then\r\nagain, the tongue to speak must be one which could reproach, and strike\r\nat errors; fence, and continually summon resources to engage the\r\nelectrical vitality of a man like Victor.  It was an exultation of their\r\nlife together, a mark of his holiness for them both, that they had never\r\nbreathed a reproach upon one another.\r\n\r\nShe dropped away from ideas of remonstrance; faintly seeing, in her sigh\r\nof submission, that the deficiency affecting her character would have\r\nbeen supplied by a greater force of character, pressing either to speech\r\nor acts.  The confession of a fated inevitable in the mind, is weakness\r\nprostrate.  She knew it: but she could point to the manner of man she was\r\nmatched with; and it was not a poor excuse.\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby, she thought, deserved her gratitude in some degree for\r\nstepping between Mr. Sowerby and Nesta.  The girl not having\r\ninclinations, and the young gentleman being devoid of stratagem, they\r\nwere easily kept from the dangerous count of two.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle would have said, that the shepherd also had rarely if ever a\r\nminute quite alone with her lamb.  Incredulously she perceived signs of a\r\nshock.  The secret following the signs was betrayed by Nesta in return\r\nfor a tender grasp of hands and a droll flutter of eyelids.  Out it came,\r\non a nod first; then a dreary mention of a date, and an incident, to\r\nbring it nearer to comprehension.  Mr. Barmby--and decide who will\r\nwhether it is that Love was made to elude or that curates impelled by his\r\nfires are subtle as nether--had outwitted French watchfulness by stealing\r\nminutes enough on a day at Lakelands to declare himself.  And no wonder\r\nthe girl looked so forlorn: he had shivered her mediaeval forest-palace\r\nof illuminated glass, to leave her standing like a mountain hind, that\r\nsniffs the tainted gale off the crag of her first quick leap from hounds;\r\nher instincts alarmed, instead of rich imagination colouring and\r\nfostering.\r\n\r\nShe had no memory for his words; so, and truly, she told her Louise:\r\nmeaning that she had only a spiceless memory; especially for the word\r\nlove in her ears from the mouth of a man.\r\n\r\nThere had been a dream of it; with the life-awakening marvel it would be,\r\nthe humbleness it would bring to her soul beneath the golden clothing of\r\nher body: one of those faint formless dreams, which are as the bend of\r\ngrasses to the breath of a still twilight.  She lived too spiritedly to\r\nhang on any dream; and had moreover a muffled dread-shadow-sister to the\r\nvirginal desire--of this one, as of a fateful power that might drag her\r\ndown, disorder, discolour.  But now she had heard it: the word, the very\r\nword itself! in her own ears! addressed to her! in a man's voice!  The\r\nfirst utterance had been heard, and it was over; the chapter of the book\r\nof bulky promise of the splendours and mysteries;--the shimmering woods\r\nand bushy glades, and the descent of the shape celestial, and the\r\nrecognition--the mutual cry of affinity; and overhead the crimson\r\noutrolling of the flag of beneficent enterprises hand in hand, all was at\r\nan end.  These, then, are the deceptions our elders tell of!  That\r\nmasculine voice should herald a new world to the maiden.  The voice she\r\nhad heard did but rock to ruin the world she had been living in.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle prudently forbore from satirical remarks on his person or on\r\nhis conduct.  Nesta had nothing to defend: she walked in a bald waste.\r\n\r\n'Can I have been guilty of leading him to think .  .  .?' she said, in a\r\ntone that writhed, at a second discussion of this hapless affair.\r\n\r\n'They choose to think,' mademoiselle replied.  'It is he or another.  My\r\ndear and dearest, you have entered the field where shots fly thick, as\r\nthey do to soldiers in battle; and it is neither your fault nor any\r\none's, if you are hit.'\r\n\r\nNesta gazed at her, with a shy supplicating cry of 'Louise.'\r\n\r\nMademoiselle immediately answered the tone of entreaty.  'Has it happened\r\nto me?  I am of the age of eight and twenty; passable, to look at: yes,\r\nmy dear, I have gone through it.  To spare you the questions tormenting\r\nyou, I will tell you, that perhaps our experience of our feelings comes\r\nnigh on a kind of resemblance.  The first gentleman who did me the honour\r\nto inform me of his passion, was a hunchback.'\r\n\r\nNesta cried 'Oh!' in a veritable pang of sympathy, and clapped hands to\r\nher ears, to shut out Mr. Barmby's boom of the terrific word attacking\r\nLouise from that deformed one.\r\n\r\nHer disillusionment became of the sort which hears derision.  A girl of\r\nquick blood and active though unregulated intellect, she caught at the\r\ncomic of young women's hopes and experiences, in her fear of it.\r\n\r\n'My own precious poor dear Louise! what injustice there is in the world\r\nfor one like my Louise to have a hunchback to be the first .  .  .  !'\r\n\r\n'But, my dear, it did me no harm.'\r\n\r\n'But if it had been known!'\r\n\r\n'But it was known!'\r\n\r\nNesta controlled a shuddering: 'It is the knowledge of it in ourselves--\r\nthat it has ever happened;--you dear Louise, who deserve so much better!\r\nAnd one asks--Oh, why are we not left in peace!  And do look at the\r\nobjects it makes of us!'  Mademoiselle: could see, that the girl's\r\ndesperation had got hold of her humour for a life-buoy.  'It is really\r\nworse to have it unknown--when you are compelled to be his partner in\r\nsharing the secret, and feel as if it were a dreadful doll you conceal\r\nfor fear that everybody will laugh at its face.'\r\n\r\nShe resumed her seriousness: 'I find it so hard to be vexed with him and\r\nreally really like him.  For he is a good man; but he will not let one\r\nshake him off.  He distresses: because we can't quite meet as we did.\r\nLast Wednesday Concert evening, he kept away; and I am annoyed that I was\r\nglad.'\r\n\r\n'Moths have to pass through showers, and keep their pretty patterns from\r\ndamage as best they can,' said mademoiselle.\r\n\r\nNesta transformed herself into a disciple of Philosophy on the spot.\r\n'Yes, all these feelings of ours are moth-dust!  One feels them.  I\r\nsuppose they pass.  They must.  But tell me, Louise, dear soul, was your\r\npoor dear good little afflicted suitor--was he kindly pitied?'\r\n\r\n'Conformably with the regulations prescribed to young damsels who are in\r\nrequest to surrender the custody of their hands.  It is easy to commit a\r\ndangerous excess in the dispensing of that article they call pity of\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\n'And he--did he?--vowed to you he could not take No for an answer?'\r\n\r\nAt this ingenuous question, woefully uttered, mademoiselle was pricked,\r\nto smile pointedly.  Nesta had a tooth on her under-lip.  Then, shaking\r\nvapours to the winds, she said: 'It is an honour, to be asked; and we\r\ncannot be expected to consent.  So I shall wear through it.--Only I do\r\nwish that Mr. Fenellan would not call him The Inchcape Bell!' She\r\nmurmured this to herself.\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby was absent for two weeks.  'Can anything have offended him?'\r\nVictor inquired, in some consternation, appreciating the man's worth, and\r\nthe grand basso he was; together with the need for him at the Lakelands\r\nConcert in August.\r\n\r\nNataly wrote Mr. Barmby a direct invitation.  She had no reply.  Her\r\nspeculations were cut short by Victor, who handed her a brief note\r\naddressed to him and signed by the Rev. Septimus, petitioning for a\r\nprivate interview.\r\n\r\nThe formality of the request incensed Victor.  'Now, dear love, you see\r\nColney's meaning, when he says, there are people who have no intimacy in\r\nthem.  Here's a man who visits me regularly once a week or more, has been\r\nfamiliar for years--four, at least; and he wants to speak to me, and must\r\nobtain the \"privilege\" by special appointment!  What can be the meaning\r\nof it?'\r\n\r\n'You will hear to-morrow afternoon,' Nataly said, seeing one paved way to\r\nthe meaning--a too likely meaning. . . 'He hasn't been .  .  .  nothing\r\nabout Fredi, surely!'\r\n\r\n'I have had no information.'\r\n\r\n'Impossible!  Barmby has good sense; Bottesini can't intend to come\r\nscraping on that string.  But we won't lose him; he's one of us.  Barmby\r\ncounts for more at a Charity Concert than all the catalogue, and\r\nparticularly in the country.  But he's an excellent fellow--eh?'\r\n\r\n'That he is,' Nataly agreed.\r\n\r\nVictor despatched a cheerful curt consent to see Mr. Barmby privately on\r\nthe late afternoon of the day to follow.\r\n\r\nNesta, returning home from the park at that hour of the interview,\r\nignorant of Mr. Barmby's purpose though she was, had her fires\r\nextinguished by the rolling roar of curfew along the hall-passage,\r\nout of the library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nSUITORS FOR THE HAND OF NESTA VICTORIA\r\n\r\nWhen, upon the well-known quest, the delightful singer Orpheus took that\r\ndownward way, coming in sight of old Cerberus centiceps, he astutely\r\nfeigned inattention to the hostile appearances of the multiple beast, and\r\nwith a wave of his plectrum over the responsive lyre, he at the stroke\r\nraised voice.  This much you know.  It may be communicated to you, that\r\nthere was then beheld the most singular spectacle ever exhibited on the\r\ndizzy line of division between the living and the dead.  For those\r\nunaccustomed musical tones in the last thin whiff of our sustaining air\r\nwere so smartingly persuasive as to pierce to the vitals of the faithful\r\nOld Dog before his offended sentiments had leisure to rouse their heads\r\nagainst a beggar of a mortal.  The terrible sugariness which poured into\r\nhim worked like venom to cause an encounter and a wrestling: his battery\r\nof jaws expressed it.  They gaped.  At the same time, his eyeballs gave\r\nup.  All the Dog, that would have barked the breathing intruder an\r\nhundredfold back to earth, was one compulsory centurion yawn.  Tears,\r\nissue of the frightful internal wedding of the dulcet and the sour\r\n(a ravishing rather of the latter by the former), rolled off his muzzles.\r\n\r\nNow, if you are not for insisting that a magnificent simile shall be\r\ncomposed of exactly the like notes in another octave, you will catch the\r\nfine flavour of analogy and be wafted in a beat of wings across the scene\r\nof the application of the Rev. Septimus Barmby to Mr. Victor Radnor, that\r\nhe might enter the house in the guise of suitor for the hand of Nesta\r\nVictoria.  It is the excelling merit of similes and metaphors to spring\r\nus to vault over gaps and thickets and dreary places.  But, as with the\r\nvisits of Immortals, we must be ready to receive them.  Beware, moreover,\r\nof examining them too scrupulously: they have a trick of wearing to\r\nvapour if closely scanned.  Let it be gratefully for their aid.\r\n\r\nSo far the comparison is absolute, that Mr. Barmby passed: he was at\r\nliberty to pursue his quest.\r\n\r\nVictor could not explain how he had been brought to grant it.  He was at\r\npains to conceal the bewilderment Mr. Barmby had cast on him, and make\r\nNataly see the smallness of the grant:--both of them were unwilling to\r\nlose Barmby; there was not the slightest fear about Fredi, he said; and\r\nwhy should not poor Barmby have his chance with the others in the race!\r\n--and his Nataly knew that he hated to speak unkindly: he could cry the\r\nnegative like a crack of thunder in the City.  But such matters as these!\r\nand a man pleading merely for the right to see the girl!--and pleading in\r\na tone .  .  .  'I assure you, my love, he touched chords.'\r\n\r\n'Did he allude to advantages in the alliance with him?' Nataly asked\r\nsmoothly.\r\n\r\n'His passion--nothing else.  Candid enough.  And he had a tone--he has a\r\ntone, you know.  It 's not what he said.  Some allusion to belief in a\r\nfavourable opinion of him .  .  .  encouragement .  .  .  on the part of\r\nthe mama.  She would have him travelling with us!  I foresaw it.'\r\n\r\n'You were astonished when it came.'\r\n\r\n'We always are.'\r\n\r\nVictor taunted her softly with having encouraged Mr. Barmby.\r\n\r\nShe had thought in her heart--not seriously; on a sigh of despondency--\r\nthat Mr. Barmby espousing the girl would smooth a troubled prospect: and\r\na present resentment at her weakness rendered her shrewd to detect\r\nVictor's cunning to cover his own: a thing imaginable of him previously\r\nin sentimental matters, yet never accurately and so legibly printed on\r\nher mind.  It did not draw her to read him with a novel familiarity; it\r\ndrew her to be more sensible of foregone intimations of the man he was\r\n--irresistible in attack, not impregnably defensive.  Nor did he seem in\r\nthis instance humanely considerate: if mademoiselle's estimate of the\r\nmind of the girl was not wrong, then Mr. Barmby's position would be both\r\na ridiculous and a cruel one.  She had some silly final idea that the\r\npoor man might now serve permanently to check the more dreaded applicant:\r\na proof that her ordinary reflectiveness was blunted.\r\n\r\nNataly acknowledged, after rallying Victor for coming to have his\r\nweakness condoned, a justice in his counter-accusation, of a loss of her\r\nnatural cheerfulness, and promised amendment, with a steely smile, that\r\nhis lips mimicked fondly; and her smile softened.  To strengthen the dear\r\nsoul's hopes, he spoke, as one who had received the latest information,\r\nof Dr. Themison and surgeons; little conscious of the tragic depths he\r\nstruck or of the burden he gave her heart to bear.  Her look alarmed him.\r\nShe seemed to be hugging herself up to the tingling scalp, and was in a\r\nmoment marble to sight and touch.  She looked like the old engravings of\r\nmartyrs taking the bite of the jaws of flame at the stake.\r\n\r\nHe held her embraced, feeling her body as if it were in the awful grip of\r\nfingers from the outside of life.\r\n\r\nThe seizure was over before it could be called ominous.  When it was once\r\nover, and she had smiled again and rebuked him for excessive anxiety, his\r\napprehensions no longer troubled him, but subsided sensationally in wrath\r\nat the crippled woman who would not obey the dictate of her ailments\r\ninstantly to perish and spare this dear one annoyance.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, later than usual, he performed his usual mental penance for\r\nit.  In consequence, the wrath, and the wish, and the penitence, haunted\r\nhim, each swelling to possession of him in turn; until they united to\r\nhead a plunge into retrospects; which led to his reviewing the army of\r\ncharges against Mrs. Burman.\r\n\r\nAnd of this he grew ashamed, attributing it to the morbid indulgence in\r\nreflection: a disease never afflicting him anterior to the stupid fall on\r\nLondon Bridge.  He rubbed instinctively for the punctilio-bump, and could\r\ncheat his fancy to think a remainder of it there, just below, half an\r\ninch to the right of, the spot where a phrenologist, invited by Nataly in\r\nold days, had marked philo-progenitiveness on his capacious and enviable\r\ncerebrum.  He knew well it was a fancy.  But it was a fact also, that\r\nsince the day of the fall (never, save in merest glimpses, before that\r\nday), he had taken to look behind him, as though an eye had been knocked\r\nin the back of his head.\r\n\r\nThen, was that day of the announcement of Lakelands to Nataly, to be\r\naccounted a gloomy day?  He would not have it so.\r\n\r\nShe was happily occupied with her purchases of furniture, Fredi with her\r\nsinging lessons, and he with his business; a grasp of many ribands,\r\nreining-in or letting loose; always enjoyable in the act.  Recently only\r\nhad he known when at home, a relaxation, a positive pleasure in looking\r\nforward to the hours of the City office.  This was odd, but so it was;\r\nand looking homeward from the City, he had a sense of disappointment when\r\nit was not Concert evening.  The Cormyns, the Yatts, and Priscilla\r\nGraves, and Pempton, foolish fellow, and that bothering Barmby, and\r\nPeridon and Catkin, were the lineing of his nest.  Well, and so they had\r\nbeen before Lakelands rose.  What had induced!  .  .  .  he suddenly felt\r\nforeign to himself.  The shrouded figure of his lost Idea on London\r\nBridge went by.\r\n\r\nA peep into the folds of the shroud was granted him:--Is it a truth, that\r\nif we are great owners of money, we are so swollen with a force not\r\nnative to us, as to be precipitated into acts the downright contrary of\r\nour tastes?\r\n\r\nHe inquired it of his tastes, which have the bad habit of unmeasured\r\nphrasing when they are displeased, and so they yield no rational answer.\r\nStill he gave heed to violent extraneous harpings against money.\r\nEpigrams of Colney's; abuse of it and the owners of it by Socialist\r\norators reported in some newspaper corner; had him by the ears.\r\n\r\nThey ceased in the presence of Lady Grace Halley, who entered his office\r\nto tell him she was leaving town for Whinfold, her husband's family-seat,\r\nwhere the dear man lay in evil case.  She signified her resignation to\r\nthe decrees from above, saying generously:\r\n\r\n'You look troubled, my friend.  Any bad City news?'\r\n\r\n'I look troubled?' Victor said laughing, and bethought him of what the\r\ntrouble might be.  'City news would not cause the look.  Ah, yes;--I was\r\ntalking in the street to a friend of mine on horseback the other day, and\r\nhe kept noticing his horse's queer starts.  We spied half a dozen\r\nchildren in the gutter, at the tail of the horse, one of them plucking at\r\na hair.  \"Please, sir, may I have a hair out of your horse's tail?\"  said\r\nthe mite.  We patted the poor horse that grew a tail for urchins to pluck\r\nat.  Men come to the fathers about their girls.  It's my belief that\r\nmothers more easily say no.  If they learn the word as maids, you'll say!\r\nHowever, there's no fear about my girl.  Fredi's hard to snare.  And what\r\nbrings you Cityward?'\r\n\r\n'I want to know whether I shall do right in selling out of the Tiddler\r\nmine.'\r\n\r\n'You have multiplied your investment by ten.'\r\n\r\n'If it had been thousands!'\r\n\r\n'Clearly, you sell; always jump out of a mounted mine, unless you're at\r\nthe bottom of it.'\r\n\r\n'There are City-articles against the mine this morning--or I should have\r\nbeen on my way to Whinfold at this moment.  The shares are lower.'\r\n\r\n'The merry boys are at work to bring your balloon to the ground, that you\r\nmay quit it for them to ascend.  Tiddler has enemies, like the best of\r\nmines: or they may be named lovers, if you like.  And mines that have\r\ngone up, go down for a while before they rise again; it's an affair of\r\nundulations; rocket mines are not so healthy.  The stories are false, for\r\nthe time.  I had the latest from Dartrey Fenellan yesterday.  He's here\r\nnext month; some time in August.'\r\n\r\n'He is married, is he not?'\r\n\r\n'Was.'\r\n\r\nVictor's brevity sounded oddly to Lady Grace.\r\n\r\n'Is he not a soldier?' she said.\r\n\r\n'Soldiers and parsons!' Victor interjected.\r\n\r\nNow she saw.  She understood the portent of Mr. Barmby's hovering offer\r\nof the choice of songs, and the recent tremulousness of the welling\r\nBethesda.\r\n\r\nBut she had come about her own business; and after remarking, that when\r\nthere is a prize there must be competition, or England will have to lower\r\nher flag, she declared her resolve to stick to Tiddler, exclaiming: 'It's\r\nonly in mines that twenty times the stake is not a dream of the past!'\r\n\r\n'The Riviera green field on the rock is always open to you,' said Victor.\r\n\r\nShe put out her hand to be taken.  'Not if you back me here.  It really\r\nis not gambling when yours is the counsel I follow.  And if I'm to be a\r\nwidow, I shall have to lean on a friend, gifted like you.  I love\r\nadventure, danger;--well, if we two are in it; just to see my captain in\r\na storm.  And if the worst happens, we go down together.  It 's the\r\ndetestation of our deadly humdrum of modern life; some inherited love of\r\nfighting.'\r\n\r\n'Say, brandy.'\r\n\r\n'Does not Mr. Durance accuse you of an addiction to the brandy novel?'\r\n\r\n'Colney may call it what he pleases.  If I read fiction, let it be\r\nfiction; airier than hard fact.  If I see a ballet, my troop of short\r\nskirts must not go stepping like pavement policemen.  I can't read dull\r\nanalytical stuff or \"stylists\" when I want action--if I'm to give my mind\r\nto a story.  I can supply the reflections.  I'm English--if Colney 's\r\nright in saying we always come round to the story with the streak of\r\nsupernaturalism.\r\n\r\nI don't ask for bloodshed: that's what his \"brandy\" means.'\r\n\r\n'But Mr. Durance is right, we require a shedding; I confess I expect it\r\nwhere there's love; it's part of the balance, and justifies one's\r\nexcitement.  How otherwise do you get any real crisis?  I must read and\r\nlive something unlike this flat life around us.'\r\n\r\n'There's the Adam life and the Macadam life, Fenellan says.  Pass it in\r\nbooks, but in life we can have quite enough excitement coming out of our\r\nthoughts.  No brandy there!  And no fine name for personal predilections\r\nor things done in domino!'  Victor said, with his very pleasant face,\r\npressing her hand, to keep the act of long holding it in countenance and\r\nbring it to a well-punctuated conclusion: thinking involuntarily of the\r\nother fair woman, whose hand was his, and who betrayed a beaten visage\r\ndespite--or with that poor kind of--trust in her captain.  But the\r\nthought was not guilty of drawing comparisons.  'This is one that I could\r\ntrust, as captain or mate,' he pressed the hand again before dropping it.\r\n\r\n'You judge entirely by the surface, if you take me for a shifty person at\r\nthe trial,' said Lady Grace.\r\n\r\nSkepsey entered the room with one of his packets, and she was reminded of\r\ntrains and husbands.\r\n\r\nShe left Victor uncomfortably rufed: and how? for she had none of the\r\nphysical charms appealing peculiarly to the man who was taken with\r\ngrandeur of shape.  She belonged rather to the description physically\r\ndistasteful to him.\r\n\r\nIt is a critical comment on a civilization carelessly distilled from the\r\njealous East, when visits of fair women to City offices can have this\r\neffect.  If the sexes are separated for an hour, the place where one is\r\nexcluded or not common to see, becomes inflammable to that appearing\r\nspark.  He does outrage to a bona Dea: she to the monasticism of the\r\nCourt of Law: and he and she awaken unhallowed emotions.  Supposing,\r\nhowever, that western men were to de-orientalize their gleeful notions of\r\nher, and dis-Turk themselves by inviting the woman's voluble tongue to\r\nsisterly occupation there in the midst of the pleading Court, as in the\r\ndomestic circle: very soon would her eyes be harmless: unless directed\r\nupon us with intent.\r\n\r\nThat is the burning core of the great Question, our Armageddon in\r\nMorality: Is she moral?  Does she mean to be harmless?  Is she not\r\nuntamable Old Nature?  And when once on an equal footing with her lordly\r\nhalf, would not the spangled beauty, in a turn, like the realistic\r\ntransformation-trick of a pantomime, show herself to be that wanton old\r\nthing--the empress of disorderliness?  You have to recollect, as the\r\nConservative acutely suggests, that her timidities, at present urging her\r\nto support Establishments, pertain to her state of dependence.  The party\r\nviews of Conservatism are, must be, founded, we should remember, on an\r\nintimate acquaintance with her in the situations where she is almost\r\nunrestrictedly free and her laughter rings to confirm the sentences of\r\nclassical authors and Eastern sages.  Conservatives know what they are\r\nabout when they refuse to fling the last lattice of an ancient harem open\r\nto air and sun-the brutal dispersers of mystery, which would despoil an\r\nankle of its flying wink.\r\n\r\nVictor's opinions were those of the entrenched majority; objecting to the\r\noccult power of women, as we have the women now, while legislating to\r\nmaintain them so; and forbidding a step to a desperately wicked female\r\nworld lest the step should be to wickeder.  His opinions were in the\r\nbackground, rarely stirred; but the lady had brought them forward; and he\r\nfretted at his restlessness, vexed that it should be due to the intrusion\r\nof the sex instead of to the charms of the individual.  No sting of the\r\nsort had bothered him, he called to mind, on board the Channel boat-\r\nnothing to speak of.  'Why does she come here!  Why didn't she go to her\r\nhusband!  She gets into the City scramble blindfold, and catches at the\r\nnearest hand to help her out!  Nice woman enough.'  Yes, but he was\r\nannoyed with her for springing sensations that ran altogether heartless\r\nto the object, at the same time that they were disloyal to the dear woman\r\ntheir natural divinity.  And between him and that dear woman, since the\r\ncommunication made by Skepsey in the town of Dreux, nightly the dividing\r\nspirit of Mrs. Burman lay cold as a corpse.  They both felt her there.\r\nThey kissed coldly, pressed a hand, said good night.\r\n\r\nNext afternoon the announcement by Skepsey of the Hon. Dudley Sowerby,\r\nsurprised Victor's eyebrows at least, and caused him genially to review\r\nthe visit of Lady Grace.\r\n\r\nWhether or not Colney Durance drew his description of a sunken nobility\r\nfrom the 'sick falcon' distinguishing the handsome features of Mr.\r\nSowerby, that beaked invalid was particularly noticeable to Victor during\r\nthe statement of his case, although the young gentleman was far from\r\nbeing one, in Colney's words, to enliven the condition of domestic fowl\r\nwith an hereditary turn for 'preying'; eminently the reverse; he was of\r\ngood moral repute, a worker, a commendable citizen.  But there was the\r\nobligation upon him to speak--it is expected in such cases, if only as a\r\nformality--of his 'love': hard to do even in view and near to the\r\ndamsel's reddening cheeks: it perplexed him.  He dropped a veil on the\r\nbashful topic; his tone was the same as when he reverted to the material\r\npoints; his present income, his position in the great Bank of Shotts and\r\nCo., his prospects, the health of the heir to the Cantor earldom.  He\r\nconsidered that he spoke to a member of the City merchants, whose\r\npreference for the plain positive, upon the question of an alliance\r\nbetween families by marriage, lends them for once a resemblance to lords.\r\nWhen a person is not read by character, the position or profession is\r\ncalled on to supply raised print for the finger-ends to spell.\r\n\r\nHard on poor Fredi! was Victor's thought behind the smile he bent on this\r\nbald Cupid.  She deserved a more poetical lover!  His paternal sympathies\r\nfor the girl besought in love, revived his past feelings as a wooer;\r\nnothing but a dread of the influence of Mr. Barmby's toned eloquence upon\r\nthe girl, after her listening to Dudley Sowerby's addresses, checked his\r\ncontempt for the latter.  He could not despise the suitor he sided with\r\nagainst another and seemingly now a more dangerous.  Unable quite to\r\nrepress the sentiment, he proceeded immediately to put it to his uses.\r\nFor we have no need to be scrupulously formal and precise in the\r\nexposition of circumstances to a fellow who may thank the stars if such a\r\ngirl condescends to give him a hearing.  He had this idea through the\r\nconception of his girl's generosity.  And furthermore, the cognizant eye\r\nof a Lucretian Alma Mater having seat so strongly in Victor, demanded as\r\na right an effusion of the promising amorous graces on the part of the\r\nacceptable applicant to the post of husband of that peerless.  These\r\nbeing absent, evidently non-existent, it seemed sufficient for the\r\npresent, after the fashion of the young gentleman, to capitulate the few\r\nmaterial matters briefly.\r\n\r\nThey were dotted along with a fine disregard of the stateliness of the\r\nsum to be settled on Nesta Victoria, and with a distant but burning wish\r\nall the while, that the suitor had been one to touch his heart and open\r\nit, inspiriting it--as could have been done--to disclose for good and all\r\nthe things utterable.  Victor loved clear honesty, as he loved light: and\r\nthough he hated to be accused of not showing a clean face in the light,\r\nhe would have been moved and lifted to confess to a spot by the touch at\r\nhis heart.  Dudley Sowerby's deficiencies, however, were outweighed by\r\nthe palpable advantages of his birth, his prospects, and his good repute\r\nfor conduct; add thereto his gentlemanly manners.  Victor sighed again\r\nover his poor Fredi; and in telling Mr. Sowerby that the choice must be\r\nleft to her, he had the regrets of a man aware of his persuasive arts and\r\nhow they would be used, to think that he was actually making the choice.\r\n\r\nObserve how fatefully he who has a scheme is the engine of it; he is no\r\nlonger the man of his tastes or of his principles; he is on a line of\r\nrails for a terminus; and he may cast languishing eyes across waysides to\r\nright and left, he has doomed himself to proceed, with a self-devouring\r\nhunger for the half desired; probably manhood gone at the embrace of it.\r\nThis may be or not, but Nature has decreed to him the forfeit of\r\npleasure.  She bids us count the passage of a sober day for the service\r\nof the morrow; that is her system; and she would have us adopt it, to\r\nkeep in us the keen edge for cutting, which is the guarantee of\r\nenjoyment: doing otherwise, we lose ourselves in one or other of the\r\nfurious matrix instincts; we are blunt to all else.\r\n\r\nYoung Dudley fully agreed that the choice must be with Miss Radnor; he\r\nalluded to her virtues, her accomplishments.  He was waxing to\r\nfervidness.  He said he must expect competitors; adding, on a start, that\r\nhe was to say, from his mother, she, in the case of an intention to\r\npresent Miss Radnor at Court .  .  .  .\r\n\r\nVictor waved hand for a finish, looking as though, his head had come out\r\nof hot water.  He sacrificed Royalty to his necessities, under a kind of\r\nsneer at its functions: 'Court!  my girl?  But the arduous duties are\r\nover for the season.  We are a democratic people retaining the seductions\r\nof monarchy, as a friend says; and of course a girl may like to count\r\namong the flowers of the kingdom for a day, in the list of Court\r\npresentations; no harm.  Only there's plenty of time .  .  .  very young\r\ngirls have their heads turned--though I don't say, don't imagine, my girl\r\nwould.  By and by perhaps.'\r\n\r\nDudley was ushered into Mr. Inchling's room and introduced to the figure-\r\nhead of the Firm of Inchling, Pennergate, and Radnor: a respectable City\r\nmerchant indeed, whom Dudley could read-off in a glimpse of the downright\r\ncontrast to his partner.  He had heard casual remarks on the respectable\r\nCity of London merchant from Colney Durance.  A short analytical gaze at\r\nhim, helped to an estimate of the powers of the man who kept him up.  Mr.\r\nInchling was a florid City-feaster, descendant of a line of City\r\nmerchants, having features for a wife to identify; as drovers, they tell\r\nus, can single one from another of their round-bellied beasts.  Formerly\r\nthe leader of the Firm, he was now, after dreary fits of restiveness,\r\nkickings, false prophecies of ruin, Victor's obedient cart-horse.  He\r\nsighed in set terms for the old days of the Firm, when, like trouts in\r\nthe current, the Firm had only to gape for shoals of good things to\r\nfatten it: a tale of English prosperity in quiescence; narrated\r\ninterjectorily among the by-ways of the City, and wanting only metre to\r\nmake it our national Poem.\r\n\r\nMr. Inchling did not deny that grand mangers of golden oats were still\r\nsomehow constantly allotted to him.  His wife believed in Victor, and\r\ndeemed the loss of the balancing Pennergate a gain.  Since that\r\nlamentable loss, Mr. Inchling, under the irony of circumstances the Tory\r\nof Commerce, had trotted and gallopped whither driven, racing like mad\r\nagainst his will and the rival nations now in the field to force the\r\npace; a name for enterprise; the close commercial connection of a man who\r\nspeculated--who, to put it plainly, lived on his wits; hurried onward and\r\nonward; always doubting, munching, grumbling at satisfaction, in\r\nperplexity of the gratitude which is apprehensive of black Nemesis at a\r\nturn of the road,--to confound so wild a whip as Victor Radnor.  He had\r\nnever forgiven the youth's venture in India of an enormous purchase of\r\nCotton many years back, and which he had repudiated, though not his share\r\nof the hundreds of thousands realized before the refusal to ratify the\r\nbargain had come to Victor.  Mr. Inchling dated his first indigestion\r\nfrom that disquieting period.  He assented to the praise of Victor's\r\ngenius, admitting benefits; his heart refused to pardon, and consequently\r\nhis head wholly to trust, the man who robbed him of his quondam\r\ncomfortable feeling of security.  And if you will imagine the sprite of\r\nthe aggregate English Taxpayer personifying Steam as the malignant who\r\nhas despoiled him of the blessed Safety-Assurance he once had from his\r\nGod Neptune against invaders, you will comprehend the state of Mr.\r\nInchling's mind in regard to his terrific and bountiful, but very\r\ndisturbing partner.\r\n\r\nHe thanked heaven to his wife often, that he had nothing to do with North\r\nAmerican or South American mines and pastures or with South Africa and,\r\ngold and diamonds: and a wife must sometimes listen, mastering her inward\r\ncomparisons.  Dr. Schlesien had met and meditated on this example of the\r\nisland energy.  Mr. Inchling was not permitted by his wife to be much the\r\nguest of the Radnor household, because of the frequent meeting there with\r\nColney Durance; Colney's humour for satire being instantly in bristle at\r\nsight of his representative of English City merchants: 'over whom,' as he\r\nwrote of the venerable body, 'the disciplined and instructed Germans not\r\ndeviously march; whom acute and adventurous Americans, with half a cock\r\nof the eye in passing, compassionately outstrip.'  He and Dr. Schlesien\r\nagreed upon Mr. Inchling.  Meantime the latter gentleman did his part at\r\nthe tables of the wealthier City Companies, and retained his appearance\r\nof health; he was beginning to think, upon a calculation of the increased\r\ntreasures of those Companies and the country, that we, the Taxpayer,\r\nought not to leave it altogether to Providence to defend them;\r\nnotwithstanding the watchful care of us hitherto shown by our briny\r\nProvidence, to save us from anxiety and expense.  But there are, he said,\r\n'difficulties'; and the very word could stop him, as commonly when our\r\ndifficulty lies in the exercise of thinking.\r\n\r\nVictor's African room, containing large wall-maps of auriferous regions,\r\nwas inspected; and another, where clerks were busy over miscellaneous\r\nContinents.  Dudley Sowerby hoped he might win the maiden.\r\n\r\nHe and Victor walked in company Westward.  The shop of Boyle and\r\nLuckwort, chemists, was not passed on this occasion.  Dudley grieved that\r\nhe had to be absent from the next Concert for practise, owing to his\r\nengagement to his mother to go down to the family seat near Tunbridge\r\nWells.  Victor mentioned his relatives, the Duvidney maiden ladies,\r\nresiding near the Wells.  They measured the distance between Cronidge and\r\nMoorsedge, the two houses, as for half an hour on horseback.\r\n\r\nNesta told her father at home that the pair of them had been observed\r\nconfidentially arm in arm, and conversing so profoundly.\r\n\r\n'Who, do you think, was the topic?' Victor asked.\r\n\r\nShe would not chase the little blue butterfly of a guess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nETEXT EDITOR'S BOOKMARKS:\r\n\r\nAsk not why, where reason never was\r\nCover of action as an escape from perplexity\r\nHonest creatures who will not accept a lift from fiction\r\nJudgeing of the destiny of man by the fate of individuals\r\nMemory inspired by the sensations\r\nNature could at a push be eloquent to defend the guilty\r\nSatirist too devotedly loves his lash to be a persuasive teacher\r\nSlave of existing conventions\r\nStartled by the criticism in laughter\r\nThe impalpable which has prevailing weight\r\nThere is little to be learnt when a little is known\r\nThey kissed coldly, pressed a hand, said good night\r\nWho enjoyed simple things when commanding the luxuries\r\n\r\n\r\n[The End]",
