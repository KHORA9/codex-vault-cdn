They are almost entirely\r\nconcerned with political affairs, and more specifically with defining\r\nAmericanism. It will not be forgotten, however, that the life of Mr.\r\nWilson as President of the United States is but a short period compared\r\nwith the whole of his public career as professor of jurisprudence,\r\nhistory, and politics, as President of Princeton University, as Governor\r\nof New Jersey, as an orator, and as a writer of many books.\r\n\r\nSurprise has been expressed that a man, after reaching the age of fifty,\r\nshould be able to step from the \"quiet\" life of a teacher and author\r\ninto the resounding regions of politics; but Mr. Wilson's life as a\r\nscholar, professor, and author was not at all quiet in the sense of\r\nbeing easy or untouched with exciting chances and changes, and, in the\r\nsecond place, he carried into politics the steadying ideals and the\r\nmethodical habits of his former occupation.\r\n\r\nAs these addresses themselves prove, he has retained something of the\r\nteacher's interest in showing the relation between specific instances\r\nand the general forms of thought or action of which they are a part. Not\r\nfact alone, but principle, is what he seeks to discover to his\r\naudiences. In the addresses made in 1913 it is apparent that his main\r\neffort was to fasten attention upon the principles of international\r\njustice and good will and to restrain the impulses of those Americans\r\nwho were inclined to hasty action with reference to Mexico. From the\r\nbeginning of the Great War to a point not much earlier than our own\r\nentrance into the struggle, he counselled neutrality and inaction, with\r\nwhat motives one must judge from his statements and from events. Only a\r\nfew speeches belonging to this period have been included in the present\r\ncollection. When it became practically certain that war between the\r\nUnited States and Germany was inevitable, there came into his utterances\r\na new temper and a more direct kind of eloquence. With scarcely an\r\nexception, this collection includes every one of his addresses made\r\nbetween August, 1916, and February, 1918.\r\n\r\nSome of the addresses are state papers, read to Congress, and were\r\ncarefully composed. Others, delivered in various places, appear to have\r\nbeen more or less extemporaneous. All are full of their author's\r\npolitical philosophy, and many of them contain expressions of his\r\nopinions on general subjects, such as personal character and conduct.\r\n\r\nIn order more fully to appreciate the weight of experience and the\r\nmaturity of reflection which give value to his words, it will be worth\r\nwhile to consider Mr. Wilson's entire career as a scholar and man of\r\nletters, paying particular attention to the growth of his political\r\nideals and to the qualities of his style.\r\n\r\nTo be a literary artist, a writer must possess a constructive\r\nimagination. He must be a man of feeling and have the gift of imparting\r\nto others some share of his own emotions. On almost every page of\r\nPresident Wilson's writings, as in almost all his policies, whether\r\neducational or political, is stamped the evidence of shaping, visionary\r\npower. Those of us who have known him many years remember well that in\r\nhis daily thought and speech he habitually proceeded by this same poetic\r\nmethod, first growing warm with an idea and then by analogy and figure\r\nkindling a sympathetic heat in his hearers.\r\n\r\nThe subjects that may excite an artist's imagination are infinitely\r\nnumerous and belong to every variety of conceivable life. A Coleridge or\r\na Renan will make literature out of polemical theology; a Huxley will\r\nwrite on the physical basis of life with emotion and in such a way as to\r\ninfect others with his own feelings; a Macaulay or a Froude will give\r\nwhat color he please to the story of a nation and compel all but the\r\nmost wary readers to see as through his eyes. We are too much accustomed\r\nto reserve the title of literary artist for the creator of fiction,\r\nwhether in prose or in verse. Mr. Wilson is no less truly an artist\r\nbecause the vision that fires his imagination, the vision he has spent\r\nhis life in making clear to himself and others and is now striving to\r\nrealize in action, is a political conception. He has seen it in terms of\r\nlife, as a thing that grows, that speaks, that has faced dangers, that\r\nis full of promise, that has charm, that is fit to stir a man's blood\r\nand demand a world's devotion; no wonder he has warmed to it, no wonder\r\nhe has clothed it in the richest garments of diction and rhythm and\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nThere are small artists and great artists. Granted an equal portion of\r\nimagination and an equal command of verbal resources, and still there\r\nwill be this difference. It is an affair of more or less intellectual\r\ndepth and more or less character. If character were the only one of\r\nthese two things to be considered in the case of Mr. Wilson's writings,\r\none might with little or no hesitation predict that the best of them\r\nwould long remain classics. They are full of character, of a high and\r\nfine character. They have a tone peculiar to themselves, like a man's\r\nvoice, which is one of the most unmistakable properties of a man. It\r\nwould be no reflection on an author to say that his point of view in\r\nfundamental matters had changed in the course of thirty or forty years;\r\nbut the truth is that with reference to his great political ideal Mr.\r\nWilson's point of view has not widely changed. The scope of his survey\r\nhas been enlarged, he has filled up the intervening space with a\r\nthousand observations, he sees his object with a more penetrating and\r\ncommanding eye; but it is the same object that drew to itself his\r\nyouthful gaze, and has had its part in making him\r\n\r\n     \"The generous spirit, who, when brought\r\n      Among the tasks of real life, hath wrought\r\n      Upon the plan that pleased his boyish thought.\"\r\n\r\nThe world, in time, will judge of the amount of knowledge and the degree\r\nof purely intellectual force that Mr. Wilson has applied in his field of\r\nstudy. A contemporary cannot well pronounce such a judgment, especially\r\nif the province be not his own.\r\n\r\nIn the small space at my disposal I shall try, first, to say what I\r\nthink is the political conception or idea upon which Mr. Wilson has\r\nlooked so steadily and with so deep emotion that he has made of it a\r\npoetical subject. And then I shall venture to distinguish those\r\nprocesses of imagination, that artistic method, which we call style, by\r\nwhich he has elucidated its meaning for his readers so as to win for it\r\ntheir intelligent and moved regard. The inquiry will take into account\r\nhis earliest book, _Congressional Government_, published in 1885,\r\n_Division and Reunion_, 1893, _An Old Master and Other Political\r\nEssays_, 1893, _Mere Literature and Other Essays_, 1896, _George\r\nWashington_, 1897, _The State_, written 1889, rewritten 1898, _A History\r\nof the American People_, 1902, _Constitutional Government in the United\r\nStates_, 1908, and a volume, issued very recently in England, containing\r\nsome of the President's statements on the war and entitled _America and\r\nFreedom_.\r\n\r\nLike a strong current through these works runs the doctrine that in a\r\ngood government the law-making power should be also the administering\r\npower and should bear full and specific responsibility; safeguards\r\nagainst ill-considered action being provided in two directions, by the\r\npeople on the one hand, and on the other hand by law and custom, these\r\nlatter being considered historically, as an organic growth. He finds the\r\nelements and essentials of this doctrine in our Constitution, though\r\nsomewhat obscured by the old \"literary\" theory of checks and balances.\r\nHe finds it more fully acknowledged in the British Constitution. He\r\nfinds it originating in our English race, enunciated at Runnymede,\r\ndeveloping by a slow but natural growth in English history, sanctioned\r\nin the Petition of Right, the Revolution of 1688, and the Declaration of\r\nRights, achieved for us in our own Revolution, and illustrated by the\r\nimplied powers of Congress and the more directly exercised powers of the\r\nHouse of Commons. It is a corollary of this doctrine that the President\r\nof the United States, to whom in the veto and in his peculiar relations\r\nto the Senate our Constitution gives a very real legislative function,\r\nshould associate himself closely with Congress, not merely as one who\r\nmay annul but also as one who initiates policies and helps to translate\r\nthem into laws. In his _Congressional Government_, begun when he was a\r\nstudent in Princeton and finished before he was twenty-eight years old,\r\nMr. Wilson clearly indicates his dissatisfaction with the tradition\r\nwhich would set the executive apart from the legislative power as a\r\ncheck against it and not a cooeperating element; and it is a remarkable\r\nproof of the man's integrity and persistent personality that one of his\r\nfirst acts as President was to go before the Congress as if he were its\r\nagent.\r\n\r\nIf any proof of his democracy were required, one might point to his\r\nrather surprising statement, which he has repeated more than once, that\r\nthe chief value of Congressional debate is to arouse and inform public\r\nopinion. He regards the will of the people as the real source of\r\ngovernmental policy. Yet he is very impatient of those theories of the\r\nrights of man which found favor in France in the eighteenth century and\r\nhave been the mainspring of democratic movements on the Continent of\r\nEurope. He regards political liberty, as we know it in this country, as\r\na peculiar possession of the English race to which, in all that concerns\r\njurisprudence, we Americans belong.\r\n\r\nThe other safeguard against arbitrary action by the combined\r\nlegislative-administrative power is, he declares, national respect for\r\nthe spirit of those general legal conceptions which, through many\r\ncenturies, have been making themselves part and parcel of our racial\r\ninstinct. He perceives that the British Constitution, though unwritten,\r\nis as effective as ours and commands obedience fully as much as ours,\r\nand that both appeal to a certain ingrained legal sense, common to all\r\nthe English-speaking peoples. These peoples do not really have\r\nrevolutions. What we call the American Revolution was only the\r\nreaffirming of principles which were as precious in the eyes of most\r\nEnglishmen as they were in the eyes of Washington, Hamilton, and\r\nMadison, but which had been for a time and owing to peculiar\r\ncircumstances, neglected or contravened. Political development in this\r\nfamily of nations does not, he maintains, proceed by revolution, but by\r\nevolution. On all these points his _Constitutional Government in the\r\nUnited States_ is only a richer and more mature statement and\r\nillustration of the ideas expressed in his _Congressional Government_.\r\nThe main thesis of his _George Washington_ is that the great Virginian\r\nand first American was the truest Englishman of his time, a modern\r\nHampden or Eliot, a Burke in action. Again and again he pays respect to\r\nChief Justice Marshall, who represented, in our early history, the\r\nconception of law as something in its breadth and majesty older and more\r\nsacred than the decrees of any particular legislature, and yet capable\r\nof being so interpreted as to accommodate itself to progress. Mr. Wilson\r\nhas from the beginning been an admiring student of Burke. And if Burke\r\nhas been his study, Bagehot has been his schoolmaster. The choice of\r\nbook and teacher is significant. _Mere Literature_ shows how Mr. Wilson\r\nrevered them in 1896; his public life proves that he learned their\r\nlessons well. In _An Old Master and Other Essays_, he had already borne\r\nwitness to the genius of Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill, who, as\r\ncompared with Continental writers, illustrate in the field of economics\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon spirit of respect for customs that have grown by organic\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson's _Division and Reunion_ is an admirable treatment of a\r\nquestion upon which a Southerner might have been expected to write as a\r\nSoutherner. He has discussed it as an American. His well-known text-book\r\n_The State_, which has been revised and frequently reprinted, discusses\r\nthe chief theories of the origin of government, describes the\r\nadministrative systems of Greece and Rome and of the great nations of\r\nmedieval and modern Europe and of the United States, and treats in\r\ndetail of the functions and objects of government, with special\r\nreference to law and its workings. His _History of the American People_,\r\nthough it contains many passages of insight and has the charm that comes\r\nfrom intense appreciation of details, is too diffuse and repetitious. A\r\ngreat history should be a combination of a chronicle and a treatise; it\r\nshould be a record of facts and at the same time a philosophical\r\nexposition of an idea. Mr. Wilson's five-volume work is insufficient as\r\na chronicle and too long for an essay. Yet an essay it really is.\r\nMoreover, unless I myself am blinded by prejudice, it makes too much of\r\nthe errors committed by our government in the reconstruction period\r\nafter the Civil War. On the whole, with all their faults, the\r\nadministrations of Grant and Hayes accomplished a task of enormous\r\ndifficulty, with remarkably little impatience and intemperance. The\r\ndisadvantage of having been written originally under pressure in monthly\r\ninstalments, for a periodical, is clearly visible in the _History_.\r\nThere is a too constant effort to catch the eye with picturesque\r\ndescription. Nevertheless, in this book, as in the others, Mr. Wilson\r\nevokes in his readers a noble image of that government, constitutional,\r\ntraditional, democratic, self-developing, which, from the days of his\r\nyouth, aroused in him a poetic enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the way his imagination works and clothes itself in\r\nlanguage. The quality of his mind is poetic, and his style is highly\r\nfigurative. There have been very few professors, lecturing on abstruse\r\nsubjects, such as economics, jurisprudence, and politics, who have dared\r\nto give so free a rein to an instinct frankly artistic. In the early\r\ndays of his career, Mr. Wilson was invited to follow two courses which\r\nwere supposed to be inconsistent with each other. The so-called\r\n\"scientific\" method, much admired at that time even when applied to\r\nsubjects in which philosophic insight or a sense for beauty are the\r\nproper guides, was being urged upon the rising generation of scholars.\r\nPerhaps the Johns Hopkins University was the center of this impulse in\r\nAmerica; at least it was thought to be, though the source was almost\r\nwholly German. If he had had to be a dry-as-dust in order to be a writer\r\non politics and history, Mr. Wilson would have preferred to turn his\r\nattention to biography and literary criticism. But he promptly resolved\r\nto disregard the warnings of pedants and to be a man of letters\r\n_though_ a professor of history and politics. I well remember the\r\nirritation, sometimes amused and sometimes angry, with which he used to\r\nspeak of those who were persuaded that scholarship was in some way\r\ncontaminated by the touch of imagination or philosophy. He at least\r\nwould run the risk. And so he set himself to work cultivating the graces\r\nof style no less assiduously than the exactness of science. There is a\r\ndistinct filiation in his diction, by which, from Stevenson to Lamb and\r\nfrom Lamb to Sir Thomas Browne, one can trace it back to the quaint old\r\nprose writers of the seventeenth century. I remember his calling my\r\nattention, in 1890, or thereabouts, to the delightful stylistic\r\nqualities of those worthies. Many of his colors are from their\r\nink-horns, in which the pigments were of deep and varied hues. When he\r\nis sententious and didactic he seems to have caught something of\r\nEmerson's manner. And indeed there is in all his writings a flavor of\r\noptimism and a slightly dogmatic, even when thoroughly gentle and\r\npersuasive, tone which he has in common with the New England sage.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all these resemblances to older authors, Mr. Wilson\r\ngives proof in his style of a masterful independence. He is constantly\r\ndetermined to think for himself, to get to the bottom of his subject,\r\nand finally to express the matter in terms of his own personality.\r\nEspecially is this evident in his early works, where he struggles\r\nmanfully to be himself, even in the choice of words and phrases,\r\nweighing and analyzing the most current idioms and often making in them\r\nsome thoughtful alteration the better to express his exact meaning. His\r\nliterary training appears to have been almost wholly English. There are\r\nfew traces in his writings of any classical reading or of any first-hand\r\nacquaintance with French, German, or Italian authors. And indeed in the\r\nsubstance of his thought I wonder if he is sufficiently hospitable to\r\nforeign ideas, especially to the vast body of comment on the French\r\nRevolution. I imagine few Continental authorities would agree with him\r\nin his comparatively low estimate of the importance of that great\r\nmovement, which he seems to regard with almost unmitigated disapproval.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Wilson's addresses and public letters concerning the War he\r\nre-affirms his principles and applies them with high confidence to the\r\nfateful problems of this time. His tone has become vastly deeper and\r\nsounder since he made his great decision, and from his Speech to\r\nCongress, on February 3, 1917, to his recent Baltimore appeal, it has\r\nrung true to every good impulse in the hearts of our people. His letter\r\nto the Pope is in every way his master-piece, in style, in temper, and\r\nin power of thought. He has led his country to the place it ought to\r\noccupy, by the side of that other English democracy whose institutions,\r\nideals, and destiny are almost identical with our own, as he has\r\ndemonstrated in the writings of half a lifetime. Let us hope there was\r\nprophetic virtue in a passage of his _Constitutional Government_, where,\r\nspeaking of the relation between our several States and the Union that\r\nbinds them together, he says they \"may yet afford the world itself the\r\nmodel of federation and liberty it may in God's providence come to\r\nseek.\"\r\n\r\nNo one can rise from a perusal of the great mass of Mr. Wilson's\r\nwritings without an almost oppressive sense of his unremitting and\r\nstrenuous industry. From his senior year in college to the present day\r\nhe has borne the anxieties and responsibilities of authorship. The work\r\nhas been done with extreme conscientiousness in regard to accuracy and\r\nclearness of thinking and with sedulous care for justness and beauty of\r\nexpression. It might well crown a life with honor. And when we remember\r\nthe thousands of his college lectures and the hundreds of his\r\nmiscellaneous addresses which have found no record in print, when we\r\nrecall the labors of university administration which crowded upon him in\r\nmiddle life, when we consider the spectacle of his calm, prompt,\r\norderly, and energetic performance of public duty in these latter years,\r\nour admiration for the literary artist is enhanced by our profound\r\nrespect for the man.[A]\r\n\r\n[A] A considerable part of this Introduction appeared originally as an\r\narticle in _The Princeton Alumni Weekly_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT WILSON'S ADDRESSES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the Capitol, in Washington, March 4, 1913.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has been a change of government. It began two years ago, when the\r\nHouse of Representatives became Democratic by a decisive majority. It\r\nhas now been completed. The Senate about to assemble will also be\r\nDemocratic. The offices of President and Vice-President have been put\r\ninto the hands of Democrats. What does the change mean? That is the\r\nquestion that is uppermost in our minds to-day. That is the question I\r\nam going to try to answer, in order, if I may, to interpret the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nIt means much more than the mere success of a party. The success of a\r\nparty means little except when the Nation is using that party for a\r\nlarge and definite purpose. No one can mistake the purpose for which the\r\nNation now seeks to use the Democratic Party. It seeks to use it to\r\ninterpret a change in its own plans and point of view. Some old things\r\nwith which we had grown familiar, and which had begun to creep into the\r\nvery habit of our thought and of our lives, have altered their aspect as\r\nwe have latterly looked critically upon them, with fresh, awakened eyes;\r\nhave dropped their disguises and shown themselves alien and sinister.\r\nSome new things, as we look frankly upon them, willing to comprehend\r\ntheir real character, have come to assume the aspect of things long\r\nbelieved in and familiar, stuff of our own convictions. We have been\r\nrefreshed by a new insight into our own life.\r\n\r\nWe see that in many things that life is very great. It is incomparably\r\ngreat in its material aspects, in its body of wealth, in the diversity\r\nand sweep of its energy, in the industries which have been conceived\r\nand built up by the genius of individual men and the limitless\r\nenterprise of groups of men. It is great, also, very great, in its moral\r\nforce. Nowhere else in the world have noble men and women exhibited in\r\nmore striking forms the beauty and the energy of sympathy and\r\nhelpfulness and counsel in their efforts to rectify wrong, alleviate\r\nsuffering, and set the weak in the way of strength and hope. We have\r\nbuilt up, moreover, a great system of government, which has stood\r\nthrough a long age as in many respects a model for those who seek to set\r\nliberty upon foundations that will endure against fortuitous change,\r\nagainst storm and accident. Our life contains every great thing, and\r\ncontains it in rich abundance.\r\n\r\nBut the evil has come with the good, and much fine gold has been\r\ncorroded. With riches has come inexcusable waste. We have squandered a\r\ngreat part of what we might have used, and have not stopped to conserve\r\nthe exceeding bounty of nature, without which our genius for enterprise\r\nwould have been worthless and impotent, scorning to be careful,\r\nshamefully prodigal as well as admirably efficient. We have been proud\r\nof our industrial achievements, but we have not hitherto stopped\r\nthoughtfully enough to count the human cost, the cost of lives snuffed\r\nout, of energies overtaxed and broken, the fearful physical and\r\nspiritual cost to the men and women and children upon whom the dead\r\nweight and burden of it all has fallen pitilessly the years through. The\r\ngroans and agony of it all had not yet reached our ears, the solemn,\r\nmoving undertone of our life, coming up out of the mines and factories\r\nand out of every home where the struggle had its intimate and familiar\r\nseat. With the great Government went many deep secret things which we\r\ntoo long delayed to look into and scrutinize with candid, fearless\r\neyes. The great Government we loved has too often been made use of for\r\nprivate and selfish purposes, and those who used it had forgotten the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAt last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see\r\nthe bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and\r\nvital. With this vision we approach new affairs. Our duty is to cleanse,\r\nto reconsider, to restore, to correct the evil without impairing the\r\ngood, to purify and humanize every process of our common life without\r\nweakening or sentimentalizing it. There has been something crude and\r\nheartless and unfeeling in our haste to succeed and be great. Our\r\nthought has been \"Let every man look out for himself, let every\r\ngeneration look out for itself,\" while we reared giant machinery which\r\nmade it impossible that any but those who stood at the levers of control\r\nshould have a chance to look out for themselves. We had not forgotten\r\nour morals. We remembered well enough that we had set up a policy which\r\nwas meant to serve the humblest as well as the most powerful, with an\r\neye single to the standards of justice and fair play, and remembered it\r\nwith pride. But we were very heedless and in a hurry to be great.\r\n\r\nWe have come now to the sober second thought. The scales of heedlessness\r\nhave fallen from our eyes. We have made up our minds to square every\r\nprocess of our national life again with the standards we so proudly set\r\nup at the beginning and have always carried at our hearts. Our work is a\r\nwork of restoration.\r\n\r\nWe have itemized with some degree of particularity the things that ought\r\nto be altered and here are some of the chief items: A tariff which cuts\r\nus off from our proper part in the commerce of the world, violates the\r\njust principles of taxation, and makes the Government a facile\r\ninstrument in the hands of private interests; a banking and currency\r\nsystem based upon the necessity of the Government to sell its bonds\r\nfifty years ago and perfectly adapted to concentrating cash and\r\nrestricting credits; an industrial system which, take it on all its\r\nsides, financial as well as administrative, holds capital in leading\r\nstrings, restricts the liberties and limits the opportunities of labor,\r\nand exploits without renewing or conserving the natural resources of the\r\ncountry; a body of agricultural activities never yet given the\r\nefficiency of great business undertakings or served as it should be\r\nthrough the instrumentality of science taken directly to the farm, or\r\nafforded the facilities of credit best suited to its practical needs;\r\nwatercourses undeveloped, waste places unreclaimed, forests untended,\r\nfast disappearing without plan or prospect of renewal, unregarded waste\r\nheaps at every mine. We have studied, as perhaps no other nation has,\r\nthe most effective means of production, but we have not studied cost or\r\neconomy as we should, either as organizers of industry, as statesmen, or\r\nas individuals.\r\n\r\nNor have we studied and perfected the means by which government may be\r\nput at the service of humanity, in safeguarding the health of the\r\nNation, the health of its men and its women and its children, as well as\r\ntheir rights in the struggle for existence. This is no sentimental duty.\r\nThe firm basis of government is justice, not pity. These are matters of\r\njustice. There can be no equality of opportunity, the first essential of\r\njustice in the body politic, if men and women and children be not\r\nshielded in their lives, their very vitality, from the consequences of\r\ngreat industrial and social processes which they cannot alter, control,\r\nor singly cope with. Society must see to it that it does not itself\r\ncrush or weaken or damage its own constituent parts. The first duty of\r\nlaw is to keep sound the society it serves. Sanitary laws, pure-food\r\nlaws, and laws determining conditions of labor which individuals are\r\npowerless to determine for themselves are intimate parts of the very\r\nbusiness of justice and legal efficiency.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the things we ought to do, and not leave the others\r\nundone, the old-fashioned, never-to-be-neglected, fundamental\r\nsafeguarding of property and of individual right. This is the high\r\nenterprise of the new day: To lift everything that concerns our life as\r\na Nation to the light that shines from the hearthfire of every man's\r\nconscience and vision of the right. It is inconceivable that we should\r\ndo this as partisans; it is inconceivable we should do it in ignorance\r\nof the facts as they are or in blind haste. We shall restore, not\r\ndestroy. We shall deal with our economic system as it is and as it may\r\nbe modified, not as it might be if we had a clean sheet of paper to\r\nwrite upon; and step by step we shall make it what it should be, in the\r\nspirit of those who question their own wisdom and seek counsel and\r\nknowledge, not shallow self-satisfaction or the excitement of excursions\r\nwhither they cannot tell. Justice, and only justice, shall always be our\r\nmotto.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it will be no cool process of mere science. The Nation has been\r\ndeeply stirred, stirred by a solemn passion, stirred by the knowledge of\r\nwrong, of ideals lost, of government too often debauched and made an\r\ninstrument of evil. The feelings with which we face this new age of\r\nright and opportunity sweep across our heartstrings like some air out of\r\nGod's own presence, where justice and mercy are reconciled and the judge\r\nand the brother are one. We know our task to be no mere task of politics\r\nbut a task which shall search us through and through, whether we be able\r\nto understand our time and the need of our people, whether we be indeed\r\ntheir spokesmen and interpreters, whether we have the pure heart to\r\ncomprehend and the rectified will to choose our high course of action.\r\n\r\nThis is not a day of triumph; it is a day of dedication. Here muster,\r\nnot the forces of party, but the forces of humanity. Men's hearts wait\r\nupon us; men's lives hang in the balance; men's hopes call upon us to\r\nsay what we will do. Who shall live up to the great trust? Who dares\r\nfail to try? I summon all honest men, all patriotic, all forward-looking\r\nmen, to my side. God helping me, I will not fail them, if they will but\r\ncounsel and sustain me!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ADDRESS TO CONGRESS\r\n\r\n[Delivered at a joint session of the two Houses of Congress, at the\r\nbeginning of the first session of the Sixty-third Congress, April 8,\r\n1913.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. SPEAKER, MR. PRESIDENT, GENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nI am very glad indeed to have this opportunity to address the two Houses\r\ndirectly and to verify for myself the impression that the President of\r\nthe United States is a person, not a mere department of the Government\r\nhailing Congress from some isolated island of jealous power, sending\r\nmessages, not speaking naturally and with his own voice--that he is a\r\nhuman being trying to cooeperate with other human beings in a common\r\nservice. After this pleasant experience I shall feel quite normal in all\r\nour dealings with one another.[B]\r\n\r\nI have called the Congress together in extraordinary session because a\r\nduty was laid upon the party now in power at the recent elections which\r\nit ought to perform promptly, in order that the burden carried by the\r\npeople under existing law may be lightened as soon as possible and in\r\norder, also, that the business interests of the country may not be kept\r\ntoo long in suspense as to what the fiscal changes are to be to which\r\nthey will be required to adjust themselves. It is clear to the whole\r\ncountry that the tariff duties must be altered. They must be changed to\r\nmeet the radical alteration in the conditions of our economic life which\r\nthe country has witnessed within the last generation. While the whole\r\nface and method of our industrial and commercial life were being changed\r\nbeyond recognition the tariff schedules have remained what they were\r\nbefore the change began, or have moved in the direction they were given\r\nwhen no large circumstance of our industrial development was what it is\r\nto-day. Our task is to square them with the actual facts. The sooner\r\nthat is done the sooner we shall escape from suffering from the facts\r\nand the sooner our men of business will be free to thrive by the law of\r\nnature (the nature of free business) instead of by the law of\r\nlegislation and artificial arrangement.\r\n\r\nWe have seen tariff legislation wander very far afield in our day--very\r\nfar indeed from the field in which our prosperity might have had a\r\nnormal growth and stimulation. No one who looks the facts squarely in\r\nthe face or knows anything that lies beneath the surface of action can\r\nfail to perceive the principles upon which recent tariff legislation has\r\nbeen based. We long ago passed beyond the modest notion of \"protecting\"\r\nthe industries of the country and moved boldly forward to the idea that\r\nthey were entitled to the direct patronage of the Government. For a long\r\ntime--a time so long that the men now active in public policy hardly\r\nremember the conditions that preceded it--we have sought in our tariff\r\nschedules to give each group of manufacturers or producers what they\r\nthemselves thought that they needed in order to maintain a practically\r\nexclusive market as against the rest of the world. Consciously or\r\nunconsciously, we have built up a set of privileges and exemptions from\r\ncompetition behind which it was easy by any, even the crudest, forms of\r\ncombination to organize monopoly; until at last nothing is normal,\r\nnothing is obliged to stand the tests of efficiency and economy, in our\r\nworld of big business, but everything thrives by concerted arrangement.\r\nOnly new principles of action will save us from a final hard\r\ncrystallization of monopoly and a complete loss of the influences that\r\nquicken enterprise and keep independent energy alive.\r\n\r\nIt is plain what those principles must be. We must abolish everything\r\nthat bears even the semblance of privilege or of any kind of artificial\r\nadvantage, and put our business men and producers under the stimulation\r\nof a constant necessity to be efficient, economical, and enterprising,\r\nmasters of competitive supremacy, better workers and merchants than any\r\nin the world. Aside from the duties laid upon articles which we do not,\r\nand probably cannot, produce, therefore, and the duties laid upon\r\nluxuries and merely for the sake of the revenues they yield, the object\r\nof the tariff duties henceforth laid must be effective competition, the\r\nwhetting of American wits by contest with the wits of the rest of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIt would be unwise to move toward this end headlong, with reckless\r\nhaste, or with strokes that cut at the very roots of what has grown up\r\namongst us by long process and at our own invitation. It does not alter\r\na thing to upset it and break it and deprive it of a chance to change.\r\nIt destroys it. We must make changes in our fiscal laws, in our fiscal\r\nsystem, whose object is development, a more free and wholesome\r\ndevelopment, not revolution or upset or confusion. We must build up\r\ntrade, especially foreign trade. We need the outlet and the enlarged\r\nfield of energy more than we ever did before. We must build up industry\r\nas well, and must adopt freedom in the place of artificial stimulation\r\nonly so far as it will build, not pull down. In dealing with the tariff\r\nthe method by which this may be done will be a matter of judgment,\r\nexercised item by item. To some not accustomed to the excitements and\r\nresponsibilities of greater freedom our methods may in some respects\r\nand at some points seem heroic, but remedies may be heroic and yet be\r\nremedies. It is our business to make sure that they are genuine\r\nremedies. Our object is clear. If our motive is above just challenge and\r\nonly an occasional error of judgment is chargeable against us, we shall\r\nbe fortunate.\r\n\r\nWe are called upon to render the country a great service in more matters\r\nthan one. Our responsibility should be met and our methods should be\r\nthorough, as thorough as moderate and well considered, based upon the\r\nfacts as they are, and not worked out as if we were beginners. We are to\r\ndeal with the facts of our own day, with the facts of no other, and to\r\nmake laws which square with those facts. It is best, indeed it is\r\nnecessary, to begin with the tariff. I will urge nothing upon you now at\r\nthe opening of your session which can obscure that first object or\r\ndivert our energies from that clearly defined duty. At a later time I\r\nmay take the liberty of calling your attention to reforms which should\r\npress close upon the heels of the tariff changes, if not accompany them,\r\nof which the chief is the reform of our banking and currency laws; but\r\njust now I refrain. For the present, I put these matters on one side and\r\nthink only of this one thing--of the changes in our fiscal system which\r\nmay best serve to open once more the free channels of prosperity to a\r\ngreat people whom we would serve to the utmost and throughout both rank\r\nand file.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your courtesy.\r\n\r\n[B] It had been the practice of our Presidents to send their Messages to\r\nCongress and not to read them in person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS ON THE BANKING SYSTEM\r\n\r\n[Delivered at a joint session of the two Houses of Congress, June 23,\r\n1913.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. SPEAKER, MR. PRESIDENT, GENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nIt is under the compulsion of what seems to me a clear and imperative\r\nduty that I have a second time this session sought the privilege of\r\naddressing you in person. I know, of course, that the heated season of\r\nthe year is upon us, that work in these chambers and in the committee\r\nrooms is likely to become a burden as the season lengthens, and that\r\nevery consideration of personal convenience and personal comfort,\r\nperhaps, in the cases of some of us, considerations of personal health\r\neven, dictate an early conclusion of the deliberations of the session;\r\nbut there are occasions of public duty when these things which touch us\r\nprivately seem very small, when the work to be done is so pressing and\r\nso fraught with big consequence that we know that we are not at liberty\r\nto weigh against it any point of personal sacrifice. We are now in the\r\npresence of such an occasion. It is absolutely imperative that we should\r\ngive the business men of this country a banking and currency system by\r\nmeans of which they can make use of the freedom of enterprise and of\r\nindividual initiative which we are about to bestow upon them.\r\n\r\nWe are about to set them free; we must not leave them without the tools\r\nof action when they are free. We are about to set them free by removing\r\nthe trammels of the protective tariff. Ever since the Civil War they\r\nhave waited for this emancipation and for the free opportunities it\r\nwill bring with it. It has been reserved for us to give it to them. Some\r\nfell in love, indeed, with the slothful security of their dependence\r\nupon the Government; some took advantage of the shelter of the nursery\r\nto set up a mimic mastery of their own within its walls. Now both the\r\ntonic and the discipline of liberty and maturity are to ensue. There\r\nwill be some readjustments of purpose and point of view. There will\r\nfollow a period of expansion and new enterprise, freshly conceived. It\r\nis for us to determine now whether it shall be rapid and facile and of\r\neasy accomplishment. This it cannot be unless the resourceful business\r\nmen who are to deal with the new circumstances are to have at hand and\r\nready for use the instrumentalities and conveniences of free enterprise\r\nwhich independent men need when acting on their own initiative.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough to strike the shackles from business. The duty of\r\nstatesmanship is not negative merely. It is constructive also. We must\r\nshow that we understand what business needs and that we know how to\r\nsupply it. No man, however casual and superficial his observation of the\r\nconditions now prevailing in the country, can fail to see that one of\r\nthe chief things business needs now, and will need increasingly as it\r\ngains in scope and vigor in the years immediately ahead of us, is the\r\nproper means by which readily to vitalize its credit, corporate and\r\nindividual, and its originative brains. What will it profit us to be\r\nfree if we are not to have the best and most accessible\r\ninstrumentalities of commerce and enterprise? What will it profit us to\r\nbe quit of one kind of monopoly if we are to remain in the grip of\r\nanother and more effective kind? How are we to gain and keep the\r\nconfidence of the business community unless we show that we know how\r\nboth to aid and to protect it? What shall we say if we make fresh\r\nenterprise necessary and also make it very difficult by leaving all else\r\nexcept the tariff just as we found it? The tyrannies of business, big\r\nand little, lie within the field of credit. We know that. Shall we not\r\nact upon the knowledge? Do we not know how to act upon it? If a man\r\ncannot make his assets available at pleasure, his assets of capacity and\r\ncharacter and resource, what satisfaction is it to him to see\r\nopportunity beckoning to him on every hand, when others have the keys of\r\ncredit in their pockets and treat them as all but their own private\r\npossession? It is perfectly clear that it is our duty to supply the new\r\nbanking and currency system the country needs, and it will need it\r\nimmediately more than it has ever needed it before.\r\n\r\nThe only question is, When shall we supply it--now, or later, after the\r\ndemands shall have become reproaches that we were so dull and so slow?\r\nShall we hasten to change the tariff laws and then be laggards about\r\nmaking it possible and easy for the country to take advantage of the\r\nchange? There can be only one answer to that question. We must act now,\r\nat whatever sacrifice to ourselves. It is a duty which the circumstances\r\nforbid us to postpone. I should be recreant to my deepest convictions of\r\npublic obligation did I not press it upon you with solemn and urgent\r\ninsistence.\r\n\r\nThe principles upon which we should act are also clear. The country has\r\nsought and seen its path in this matter within the last few years--sees\r\nit more clearly now than it ever saw it before--much more clearly than\r\nwhen the last legislative proposals on the subject were made. We must\r\nhave a currency, not rigid as now, but readily, elastically responsive\r\nto sound credit, the expanding and contracting credits of everyday\r\ntransactions, the normal ebb and flow of personal and corporate\r\ndealings. Our banking laws must mobilize reserves; must not permit the\r\nconcentration anywhere in a few hands of the monetary resources of the\r\ncountry or their use for speculative purposes in such volume as to\r\nhinder or impede or stand in the way of other more legitimate, more\r\nfruitful uses. And the control of the system of banking and of issue\r\nwhich our new laws are to set up must be public, not private, must be\r\nvested in the Government itself, so that the banks may be the\r\ninstruments, not the masters, of business and of individual enterprise\r\nand initiative.\r\n\r\nThe committees of the Congress to which legislation of this character is\r\nreferred have devoted careful and dispassionate study to the means of\r\naccomplishing these objects. They have honored me by consulting me. They\r\nare ready to suggest action. I have come to you, as the head of the\r\nGovernment and the responsible leader of the party in power, to urge\r\naction now, while there is time to serve the country deliberately and as\r\nwe should, in a clear air of common counsel. I appeal to you with a deep\r\nconviction of duty. I believe that you share this conviction. I\r\ntherefore appeal to you with confidence. I am at your service without\r\nreserve to play my part in any way you may call upon me to play it in\r\nthis great enterprise of exigent reform which it will dignify and\r\ndistinguish us to perform and discredit us to neglect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT GETTYSBURG\r\n\r\n[Delivered in the presence of Union and Confederate veterans, on the\r\noccasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the battle, July 4, 1913.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIENDS AND FELLOW CITIZENS:\r\n\r\nI need not tell you what the Battle of Gettysburg meant. These gallant\r\nmen in blue and gray sit all about us here.[C] Many of them met upon\r\nthis ground in grim and deadly struggle. Upon these famous fields and\r\nhillsides their comrades died about them. In their presence it were an\r\nimpertinence to discourse upon how the battle went, how it ended, what\r\nit signified! But fifty years have gone by since then, and I crave the\r\nprivilege of speaking to you for a few minutes of what those fifty years\r\nhave meant.\r\n\r\nWhat _have_ they meant? They have meant peace and union and vigor, and\r\nthe maturity and might of a great nation. How wholesome and healing the\r\npeace has been! We have found one another again as brothers and comrades\r\nin arms, enemies no longer, generous friends rather, our battles long\r\npast, the quarrel forgotten--except that we shall not forget the\r\nsplendid valor, the manly devotion of the men then arrayed against one\r\nanother, now grasping hands and smiling into each other's eyes. How\r\ncomplete the union has become and how dear to all of us, how\r\nunquestioned, how benign and majestic, as State after State has been\r\nadded to this our great family of free men! How handsome the vigor, the\r\nmaturity, the might of the great Nation we love with undivided hearts;\r\nhow full of large and confident promise that a life will be wrought out\r\nthat will crown its strength with gracious justice and with a happy\r\nwelfare that will touch all alike with deep contentment! We are debtors\r\nto those fifty crowded years; they have made us heirs to a mighty\r\nheritage.\r\n\r\nBut do we deem the Nation complete and finished? These venerable men\r\ncrowding here to this famous field have set us a great example of\r\ndevotion and utter sacrifice. They were willing to die that the people\r\nmight live. But their task is done. Their day is turned into evening.\r\nThey look to us to perfect what they established. Their work is handed\r\non to us, to be done in another way, but not in another spirit. Our day\r\nis not over; it is upon us in full tide.\r\n\r\nHave affairs paused? Does the Nation stand still? Is what the fifty\r\nyears have wrought since those days of battle finished, rounded out, and\r\ncompleted? Here is a great people, great with every force that has ever\r\nbeaten in the lifeblood of mankind. And it is secure. There is no one\r\nwithin its borders, there is no power among the nations of the earth, to\r\nmake it afraid. But has it yet squared itself with its own great\r\nstandards set up at its birth, when it made that first noble, naive\r\nappeal to the moral judgment of mankind to take notice that a government\r\nhad now at last been established which was to serve men, not masters? It\r\nis secure in everything except the satisfaction that its life is right,\r\nadjusted to the uttermost to the standards of righteousness and\r\nhumanity. The days of sacrifice and cleansing are not closed. We have\r\nharder things to do than were done in the heroic days of war, because\r\nharder to see clearly, requiring more vision, more calm balance of\r\njudgment, a more candid searching of the very springs of right.\r\n\r\nLook around you upon the field of Gettysburg! Picture the array, the\r\nfierce heats and agony of battle, column hurled against column, battery\r\nbellowing to battery! Valor? Yes! Greater no man shall see in war; and\r\nself-sacrifice, and loss to the uttermost; the high recklessness of\r\nexalted devotion which does not count the cost. We are made by these\r\ntragic, epic things to know what it costs to make a nation--the blood\r\nand sacrifice of multitudes of unknown men lifted to a great stature in\r\nthe view of all generations by knowing no limit to their manly\r\nwillingness to serve. In armies thus marshaled from the ranks of free\r\nmen you will see, as it were, a nation embattled, the leaders and the\r\nled, and may know, if you will, how little except in form its action\r\ndiffers in days of peace from its action in days of war.\r\n\r\nMay we break camp now and be at ease? Are the forces that fight for the\r\nNation dispersed, disbanded, gone to their homes forgetful of the common\r\ncause? Are our forces disorganized, without constituted leaders and the\r\nmight of men consciously united because we contend, not with armies, but\r\nwith principalities and powers and wickedness in high places? Are we\r\ncontent to lie still? Does our union mean sympathy, our peace\r\ncontentment, our vigor right action, our maturity self-comprehension and\r\na clear confidence in choosing what we shall do? War fitted us for\r\naction, and action never ceases.\r\n\r\nI have been chosen the leader of the Nation. I cannot justify the choice\r\nby any qualities of my own, but so it has come about, and here I stand.\r\nWhom do I command? The ghostly hosts who fought upon these battlefields\r\nlong ago and are gone? These gallant gentlemen stricken in years whose\r\nfighting days, are over, their glory won? What are the orders for them,\r\nand who rallies them? I have in my mind another host, whom these set\r\nfree of civil strife in order that they might work out in days of peace\r\nand settled order the life of a great Nation. That host is the people\r\nthemselves, the great and the small, without class or difference of kind\r\nor race or origin; and undivided in interest, if we have but the vision\r\nto guide and direct them and order their lives aright in what we do. Our\r\nconstitutions are their articles of enlistment. The orders of the day\r\nare the laws upon our statute books. What we strive for is their\r\nfreedom, their right to lift themselves from day to day and behold the\r\nthings they have hoped for, and so make way for still better days for\r\nthose whom they love who are to come after them. The recruits are the\r\nlittle children crowding in. The quartermaster's stores are in the mines\r\nand forests and fields, in the shops and factories. Every day something\r\nmust be done to push the campaign forward; and it must be done by plan\r\nand with an eye to some great destiny.\r\n\r\nHow shall we hold such thoughts in our hearts and not be moved? I would\r\nnot have you live even to-day wholly in the past, but would wish to\r\nstand with you in the light that streams upon us now out of that great\r\nday gone by. Here is the nation God has builded by our hands. What shall\r\nwe do with it? Who stands ready to act again and always in the spirit of\r\nthis day of reunion and hope and patriotic fervor? The day of our\r\ncountry's life has but broadened into morning. Do not put uniforms by.\r\nPut the harness of the present on. Lift your eyes to the great tracts of\r\nlife yet to be conquered in the interest of righteous peace, of that\r\nprosperity which lies in a people's hearts and outlasts all wars and\r\nerrors of men. Come, let us be comrades and soldiers yet to serve our\r\nfellow-men in quiet counsel, where the blare of trumpets is neither\r\nheard nor heeded and where the things are done which make blessed the\r\nnations of the world in peace and righteousness and love.\r\n\r\n[C] The speech was made from a rostrum in the National Cemetery, on the\r\nbattlefield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS ON MEXICAN AFFAIRS\r\n\r\n[Delivered at a joint session of the two Houses of Congress, August 27,\r\n1913.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nIt is clearly my duty to lay before you, very fully and without\r\nreservation, the facts concerning our present relations with the\r\nRepublic of Mexico. The deplorable posture of affairs in Mexico I need\r\nnot describe,[D] but I deem it my duty to speak very frankly of what\r\nthis Government has done and should seek to do in fulfillment of its\r\nobligation to Mexico herself, as a friend and neighbor, and to American\r\ncitizens whose lives and vital interests are daily affected by the\r\ndistressing conditions which now obtain beyond our southern border.\r\n\r\nThose conditions touch us very nearly. Not merely because they lie at\r\nour very doors. That of course makes us more vividly and more constantly\r\nconscious of them, and every instinct of neighborly interest and\r\nsympathy is aroused and quickened by them; but that is only one element\r\nin the determination of our duty. We are glad to call ourselves the\r\nfriends of Mexico, and we shall, I hope, have many an occasion, in\r\nhappier times as well as in these days of trouble and confusion, to show\r\nthat our friendship is genuine and disinterested, capable of sacrifice\r\nand every generous manifestation. The peace, prosperity, and\r\ncontentment of Mexico mean more, much more, to us than merely an\r\nenlarged field for our commerce and enterprise. They mean an enlargement\r\nof the field of self-government and the realization of the hopes and\r\nrights of a nation with whose best aspirations, so long suppressed and\r\ndisappointed, we deeply sympathize. We shall yet prove to the Mexican\r\npeople that we know how to serve them without first thinking how we\r\nshall serve ourselves.\r\n\r\nBut we are not the only friends of Mexico. The whole world desires her\r\npeace and progress; and the whole world is interested as never before.\r\nMexico lies at last where all the world looks on. Central America is\r\nabout to be touched by the great routes of the world's trade and\r\nintercourse running free from ocean to ocean at the Isthmus. The future\r\nhas much in store for Mexico, as for all the States of Central America;\r\nbut the best gifts can come to her only if she be ready and free to\r\nreceive them and to enjoy them honorably. America in particular--America\r\nnorth and south and upon both continents--waits upon the development of\r\nMexico; and that development can be sound and lasting only if it be the\r\nproduct of a genuine freedom, a just and ordered government founded upon\r\nlaw. Only so can it be peaceful or fruitful of the benefits of peace.\r\nMexico has a great and enviable future before her, if only she choose\r\nand attain the paths of honest constitutional government.\r\n\r\nThe present circumstances of the Republic, I deeply regret to say, do\r\nnot seem to promise even the foundations of such a peace. We have waited\r\nmany months, months full of peril and anxiety, for the conditions there\r\nto improve, and they have not improved. They have grown worse, rather.\r\nThe territory in some sort controlled by the provisional authorities at\r\nMexico City has grown smaller, not larger. The prospect of the\r\npacification of the country, even by arms, has seemed to grow more and\r\nmore remote; and its pacification by the authorities at the capital is\r\nevidently impossible by any other means than force. Difficulties more\r\nand more entangle those who claim to constitute the legitimate\r\ngovernment of the Republic. They have not made good their claim in fact.\r\nTheir successes in the field have proved only temporary. War and\r\ndisorder, devastation and confusion, seem to threaten to become the\r\nsettled fortune of the distracted country. As friends we could wait no\r\nlonger for a solution which every week seemed further away. It was our\r\nduty at least to volunteer our good offices--to offer to assist, if we\r\nmight, in effecting some arrangement which would bring relief and peace\r\nand set up a universally acknowledged political authority there.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I took the liberty of sending the Hon. John Lind, formerly\r\ngovernor of Minnesota, as my personal spokesman and representative, to\r\nthe City of Mexico, with _the following instructions_:\r\n\r\n     Press very earnestly upon the attention of those who are now\r\n     exercising authority or wielding influence in Mexico the following\r\n     considerations and advice:\r\n\r\n     The Government of the United States does not feel at liberty any\r\n     longer to stand inactively by while it becomes daily more and more\r\n     evident that no real progress is being made towards the\r\n     establishment of a government at the City of Mexico which the\r\n     country will obey and respect.\r\n\r\n     The Government of the United States does not stand in the same case\r\n     with the other great Governments of the world in respect of what is\r\n     happening or what is likely to happen in Mexico. We offer our good\r\n     offices, not only because of our genuine desire to play the part of\r\n     a friend, but also because we are expected by the powers of the\r\n     world to act as Mexico's nearest friend.\r\n\r\n     We wish to act in these circumstances in the spirit of the most\r\n     earnest and disinterested friendship. It is our purpose in whatever\r\n     we do or propose in this perplexing and distressing situation not\r\n     only to pay the most scrupulous regard to the sovereignty and\r\n     independence of Mexico--that we take as a matter of course to which\r\n     we are bound by every obligation of right and honor--but also to\r\n     give every possible evidence that we act in the interest of Mexico\r\n     alone, and not in the interest of any person or body of persons who\r\n     may have personal or property claims in Mexico which they may feel\r\n     that they have the right to press. We are seeking to counsel Mexico\r\n     for her own good and in the interest of her own peace, and not for\r\n     any other purpose whatever. The Government of the United States\r\n     would deem itself discredited if it had any selfish or ulterior\r\n     purpose in transactions where the peace, happiness, and prosperity\r\n     of a whole people are involved. It is acting as its friendship for\r\n     Mexico, not as any selfish interest, dictates.\r\n\r\n     The present situation in Mexico is incompatible with the\r\n     fulfillment of international obligations on the part of Mexico,\r\n     with the civilized development of Mexico herself, and with the\r\n     maintenance of tolerable political and economic conditions in\r\n     Central America. It is upon no common occasion, therefore, that the\r\n     United States offers her counsel and assistance. All America cries\r\n     out for a settlement.\r\n\r\n     A satisfactory settlement seems to us to be conditioned on--\r\n\r\n     (_a_) An immediate cessation of fighting throughout Mexico, a\r\n     definite armistice solemnly entered into and scrupulously observed;\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Security given for an early and free election in which all\r\n     will agree to take part;\r\n\r\n     (_c_) The consent of Gen. Huerta to bind himself not to be a\r\n     candidate for election as President of the Republic at this\r\n     election; and\r\n\r\n     (_d_) The agreement of all parties to abide by the results of the\r\n     election and cooeperate in the most loyal way in organizing and\r\n     supporting the new administration.\r\n\r\n     The Government of the United States will be glad to play any part\r\n     in this settlement or in its carrying out which it can play\r\n     honorably and consistently with international right. It pledges\r\n     itself to recognize and in every way possible and proper to assist\r\n     the administration chosen and set up in Mexico in the way and on\r\n     the conditions suggested.\r\n\r\n     Taking all the existing conditions into consideration, the\r\n     Government of the United States can conceive of no reasons\r\n     sufficient to justify those who are now attempting to shape the\r\n     policy or exercise the authority of Mexico in declining the offices\r\n     of friendship thus offered. Can Mexico give the civilized world a\r\n     satisfactory reason for rejecting our good offices? If Mexico can\r\n     suggest any better way in which to show our friendship, serve the\r\n     people of Mexico, and meet our international obligations, we are\r\n     more than willing to consider the suggestion.\r\n\r\nMr. Lind executed his delicate and difficult mission with singular tact,\r\nfirmness, and good judgment, and made clear to the authorities at the\r\nCity of Mexico not only the purpose of his visit but also the spirit in\r\nwhich it had been undertaken. But the proposals he submitted were\r\nrejected, in a note the full text of which I take the liberty of laying\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\nI am led to believe that they were rejected partly because the\r\nauthorities at Mexico City had been grossly misinformed and misled upon\r\ntwo points. They did not realize the spirit of the American people in\r\nthis matter, their earnest friendliness and yet sober determination that\r\nsome just solution be found for the Mexican difficulties; and they did\r\nnot believe that the present administration spoke, through Mr. Lind, for\r\nthe people of the United States. The effect of this unfortunate\r\nmisunderstanding on their part is to leave them singularly isolated and\r\nwithout friends who can effectually aid them. So long as the\r\nmisunderstanding continues we can only await the time of their awakening\r\nto a realization of the actual facts. We cannot thrust our good offices\r\nupon them. The situation must be given a little more time to work itself\r\nout in the new circumstances; and I believe that only a little while\r\nwill be necessary. For the circumstances are new. The rejection of our\r\nfriendship makes them new and will inevitably bring its own alterations\r\nin the whole aspect of affairs. The actual situation of the authorities\r\nat Mexico City will presently be revealed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, what is it our duty to do? Clearly, everything that we do\r\nmust be rooted in patience and done with calm and disinterested\r\ndeliberation. Impatience on our part would be childish, and would be\r\nfraught with every risk of wrong and folly. We can afford to exercise\r\nthe self-restraint of a really great nation which realizes its own\r\nstrength and scorns to misuse it. It was our duty to offer our active\r\nassistance. It is now our duty to show what true neutrality will do to\r\nenable the people of Mexico to set their affairs in order again and wait\r\nfor a further opportunity to offer our friendly counsels. The door is\r\nnot closed against the resumption, either upon the initiative of Mexico\r\nor upon our own, of the effort to bring order out of the confusion by\r\nfriendly cooeperative action, should fortunate occasion offer.\r\n\r\nWhile we wait the contest of the rival forces will undoubtedly for a\r\nlittle while be sharper than ever, just because it will be plain that an\r\nend must be made of the existing situation, and that very promptly; and\r\nwith the increased activity of the contending factions will come, it is\r\nto be feared, increased danger to the non-combatants in Mexico as well\r\nas to those actually in the field of battle. The position of outsiders\r\nis always particularly trying and full of hazard where there is civil\r\nstrife and a whole country is upset. We should earnestly urge all\r\nAmericans to leave Mexico at once, and should assist them to get away in\r\nevery way possible--not because we would mean to slacken in the least\r\nour efforts to safeguard their lives and their interests, but because it\r\nis imperative that they should take no unnecessary risks when it is\r\nphysically possible for them to leave the country. We should let every\r\none who assumes to exercise authority in any part of Mexico know in the\r\nmost unequivocal way that we shall vigilantly watch the fortunes of\r\nthose Americans who cannot get away, and shall hold those responsible\r\nfor their sufferings and losses to a definite reckoning. That can be and\r\nwill be made plain beyond the possibility of a misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, I deem it my duty to exercise the authority conferred upon\r\nme by the law of March 14, 1912, to see to it that neither side to the\r\nstruggle now going on in Mexico receive any assistance from this side\r\nthe border. I shall follow the best practice of nations in the matter of\r\nneutrality by forbidding the exportation of arms or munitions of war of\r\nany kind from the United States to any part of the Republic of Mexico--a\r\npolicy suggested by several interesting precedents and certainly\r\ndictated by many manifest considerations of practical expediency. We\r\ncannot in the circumstances be the partisans of either party to the\r\ncontest that now distracts Mexico, or constitute ourselves the virtual\r\numpire between them.\r\n\r\nI am happy to say that several of the great Governments of the world\r\nhave given this Government their generous moral support in urging upon\r\nthe provisional authorities at the City of Mexico the acceptance of our\r\nproffered good offices in the spirit in which they were made. We have\r\nnot acted in this matter under the ordinary principles of international\r\nobligation. All the world expects us in such circumstances to act as\r\nMexico's nearest friend and intimate adviser. This is our immemorial\r\nrelation towards her. There is nowhere any serious question that we have\r\nthe moral right in the case or that we are acting in the interest of a\r\nfair settlement and of good government, not for the promotion of some\r\nselfish interest of our own. If further motive were necessary than our\r\nown good will towards a sister Republic and our own deep concern to see\r\npeace and order prevail in Central America, this consent of mankind to\r\nwhat we are attempting, this attitude of the great nations of the world\r\ntowards what we may attempt in dealing with this distressed people at\r\nour doors, should make us feel the more solemnly bound to go to the\r\nutmost length of patience and forbearance in this painful and anxious\r\nbusiness. The steady pressure of moral force will before many days break\r\nthe barriers of pride and prejudice down, and we shall triumph as\r\nMexico's friends sooner than we could triumph as her enemies--and how\r\nmuch more handsomely, with how much higher and finer satisfactions of\r\nconscience and of honor!\r\n\r\n[D] General Victoriano Huerta had, on Feb. 18, deposed President Madero,\r\nand had been, on the 20th, elected President by the Mexican Congress.\r\nThree days later Madero was assassinated while in the custody of the new\r\ngovernment. An army calling themselves Constitutionalists under General\r\nVilla, defeated the Mexican Federal forces in May. On August 20, Huerta\r\ndeclined the proposal of the United States government that he should\r\ncease to be a candidate for the Presidency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDERSTANDING AMERICA\r\n\r\n[Delivered at Philadelphia, Pa., on the occasion of the rededication of\r\nCongress Hall, Oct. 25, 1913. The United States Congress met in this\r\nhall till 1800. Here Washington was inaugurated the second time, and\r\nhere he made his farewell address to the American people. Here John\r\nAdams took the oath of office when he succeeded Washington. The hall,\r\nafter being long disused, was now restored and reopened. Before Mr.\r\nWilson spoke, Mr. Frank Miles Day, representing the committee of\r\narchitects, had referred to the \"delightful silence, order, gravity, and\r\npersonal dignity of manner\" observed by the Senators of the first\r\nCongress, and had said, \"They all appeared every morning full powdered,\r\nand dressed, as age or fancy might suggest, in the richest material.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUR HONOR, MR. CHAIRMAN, LADIES, AND GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nNo American could stand in this place to-day and think of the\r\ncircumstances which we are come together to celebrate without being most\r\nprofoundly stirred. There has come over me since I sat down here a sense\r\nof deep solemnity, because it has seemed to me that I saw ghosts\r\ncrowding--a great assemblage of spirits, no longer visible, but whose\r\ninfluence we still feel as we feel the molding power of history itself.\r\nThe men who sat in this hall, to whom we now look back with a touch of\r\ndeep sentiment, were men of flesh and blood, face to face with extremely\r\ndifficult problems. The population of the United States then was hardly\r\nthree times the present population of the city of Philadelphia, and yet\r\nthat was a Nation as this is a Nation, and the men who spoke for it were\r\nsetting their hands to a work which was to last, not only that their\r\npeople might be happy, but that an example might be lifted up for the\r\ninstruction of the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nI like to read the quaint old accounts such as Mr. Day has read to us\r\nthis afternoon. Strangers came then to America to see what the young\r\npeople that had sprung up here were like, and they found men in counsel\r\nwho knew how to construct governments. They found men deliberating here\r\nwho had none of the appearance of novices, none of the hesitation of men\r\nwho did not know whether the work they were doing was going to last or\r\nnot; men who addressed themselves to a problem of construction as\r\nfamiliarly as we attempt to carry out the traditions of a Government\r\nestablished these 137 years.\r\n\r\nI feel to-day the compulsion of these men, the compulsion of examples\r\nwhich were set up in this place. And of what do their examples remind\r\nus? They remind us not merely of public service but of public service\r\nshot through with principle and honor. They were not histrionic men.\r\nThey did not say--\r\n\r\n     Look upon us as upon those who shall hereafter be illustrious.\r\n\r\nThey said:\r\n\r\n     Look upon us who are doing the first free work of constitutional\r\n     liberty in the world, and who must do it in soberness and truth, or\r\n     it will not last.\r\n\r\nPolitics, ladies and gentlemen, is made up in just about equal parts of\r\ncomprehension and sympathy. No man ought to go into politics who does\r\nnot comprehend the task that he is going to attack. He may comprehend it\r\nso completely that it daunts him, that he doubts whether his own spirit\r\nis stout enough and his own mind able enough to attempt its great\r\nundertakings, but unless he comprehend it he ought not to enter it.\r\nAfter he has comprehended it, there should come into his mind those\r\nprofound impulses of sympathy which connect him with the rest of\r\nmankind, for politics is a business of interpretation, and no men are\r\nfit for it who do not see and seek more than their own advantage and\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nWe have stumbled upon many unhappy circumstances in the hundred years\r\nthat have gone by since the event that we are celebrating. Almost all of\r\nthem have come from self-centered men, men who saw in their own interest\r\nthe interest of the country, and who did not have vision enough to read\r\nit in wider terms, in the universal terms of equity and justice and the\r\nrights of mankind. I hear a great many people at Fourth of July\r\ncelebrations laud the Declaration of Independence who in between Julys\r\nshiver at the plain language of our bills of rights. The Declaration of\r\nIndependence was, indeed, the first audible breath of liberty, but the\r\nsubstance of liberty is written in such documents as the declaration of\r\nrights attached, for example, to the first constitution of Virginia,\r\nwhich was a model for the similar documents read elsewhere into our\r\ngreat fundamental charters. That document speaks in very plain terms.\r\nThe men of that generation did not hesitate to say that every people has\r\na right to choose its own forms of government--not once, but as often as\r\nit pleases--and to accommodate those forms of government to its existing\r\ninterests and circumstances. Not only to establish but to alter is the\r\nfundamental principle of self-government.\r\n\r\nWe are just as much under compulsion to study the particular\r\ncircumstances of our own day as the gentlemen were who sat in this hall\r\nand set us precedents, not of what to do but of how to do it. Liberty\r\ninheres in the circumstances of the day. Human happiness consists in the\r\nlife which human beings are leading at the time that they live. I can\r\nfeed my memory as happily upon the circumstances of the revolutionary\r\nand constitutional period as you can, but I cannot feed all my purposes\r\nwith them in Washington now. Every day problems arise which wear some\r\nnew phase and aspect, and I must fall back, if I would serve my\r\nconscience, upon those things which are fundamental rather than upon\r\nthose things which are superficial, and ask myself this question, How\r\nare you going to assist in some small part to give the American people\r\nand, by example, the peoples of the world more liberty, more happiness,\r\nmore substantial prosperity; and how are you going to make that\r\nprosperity a common heritage instead of a selfish possession? I came\r\nhere to-day partly in order to feed my own spirit. I did not come in\r\ncompliment. When I was asked to come I knew immediately upon the\r\nutterance of the invitation that I had to come, that to be absent would\r\nbe as if I refused to drink once more at the original fountains of\r\ninspiration for our own Government.\r\n\r\nThe men of the day which we now celebrate had a very great advantage\r\nover us, ladies and gentlemen, in this one particular: Life was simple\r\nin America then. All men shared the same circumstances in almost equal\r\ndegree. We think of Washington, for example, as an aristocrat, as a man\r\nseparated by training, separated by family and neighborhood tradition,\r\nfrom the ordinary people of the rank and file of the country. Have you\r\nforgotten the personal history of George Washington? Do you not know\r\nthat he struggled as poor boys now struggle for a meager and imperfect\r\neducation; that he worked at his surveyor's tasks in the lonely forests;\r\nthat he knew all the roughness, all the hardships, all the adventure,\r\nall the variety of the common life of that day; and that if he stood a\r\nlittle stiffly in this place, if he looked a little aloof, it was\r\nbecause life had dealt hardly with him? All his sinews had been\r\nstiffened by the rough work of making America. He was a man of the\r\npeople, whose touch had been with them since the day he saw the light\r\nfirst in the old Dominion of Virginia. And the men who came after him,\r\nmen, some of whom had drunk deep at the sources of philosophy and of\r\nstudy, were, nevertheless, also men who on this side of the water knew\r\nno complicated life but the simple life of primitive neighborhoods. Our\r\ntask is very much more difficult. That sympathy which alone interprets\r\npublic duty is more difficult for a public man to acquire now than it\r\nwas then, because we live in the midst of circumstances and conditions\r\ninfinitely complex.\r\n\r\nNo man can boast that he understands America. No man can boast that he\r\nhas lived the life of America, as almost every man who sat in this hall\r\nin those days could boast. No man can pretend that except by common\r\ncounsel he can gather into his consciousness what the varied life of\r\nthis people is. The duty that we have to keep open eyes and open hearts\r\nand accessible understandings is a very much more difficult duty to\r\nperform than it was in their day. Yet how much more important that it\r\nshould be performed, for fear we make infinite and irreparable blunders.\r\nThe city of Washington is in some respects self-contained, and it is\r\neasy there to forget what the rest of the United States is thinking\r\nabout. I count it a fortunate circumstance that almost all the windows\r\nof the White House and its offices open upon unoccupied spaces that\r\nstretch to the banks of the Potomac and then out into Virginia and on to\r\nthe heavens themselves, and that as I sit there I can constantly forget\r\nWashington and remember the United States. Not that I would intimate\r\nthat all of the United States lies south of Washington, but there is a\r\nserious thing back of my thought. If you think too much about being\r\nreelected, it is very difficult to be worth reelecting. You are so apt\r\nto forget that the comparatively small number of persons, numerous as\r\nthey seem to be when they swarm, who come to Washington to ask for\r\nthings, do not constitute an important proportion of the population of\r\nthe country, that it is constantly necessary to come away from\r\nWashington and renew one's contact with the people who do not swarm\r\nthere, who do not ask for anything, but who do trust you without their\r\npersonal counsel to do your duty. Unless a man gets these contacts he\r\ngrows weaker and weaker. He needs them as Hercules needed the touch of\r\nmother earth. If you lift him up too high or he lifts himself too high,\r\nhe loses the contact and therefore loses the inspiration.\r\n\r\nI love to think of those plain men, however far from plain their dress\r\nsometimes was, who assembled in this hall. One is startled to think of\r\nthe variety of costume and color which would now occur if we were let\r\nloose upon the fashions of that age. Men's lack of taste is largely\r\nconcealed now by the limitations of fashion. Yet these men, who\r\nsometimes dressed like the peacock, were, nevertheless, of the ordinary\r\nflight of their time. They were birds of a feather; they were birds come\r\nfrom a very simple breeding; they were much in the open heaven. They\r\nwere beginning, when there was so little to distract their attention, to\r\nshow that they could live upon fundamental principles of government. We\r\ntalk those principles, but we have not time to absorb them. We have not\r\ntime to let them into our blood, and thence have them translated into\r\nthe plain mandates of action.\r\n\r\nThe very smallness of this room, the very simplicity of it all, all the\r\nsuggestions which come from its restoration, are reassuring\r\nthings--things which it becomes a man to realize. Therefore my theme\r\nhere to-day, my only thought, is a very simple one. Do not let us go\r\nback to the annals of those sessions of Congress to find out what to do,\r\nbecause we live in another age and the circumstances are absolutely\r\ndifferent; but let us be men of that kind; let us feel at every turn\r\nthe compulsions of principle and of honor which thy felt; let us free\r\nour vision from temporary circumstances and look abroad at the horizon\r\nand take into our lungs the great air of freedom which has blown through\r\nthis country and stolen across the seas and blessed people everywhere;\r\nand, looking east and west and north and south, let us remind ourselves\r\nthat we are the custodians, in some degree, of the principles which have\r\nmade men free and governments just.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS BEFORE THE SOUTHERN COMMERCIAL CONGRESS\r\n\r\n[Delivered at Mobile, Alabama, October 27, 1913.]\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUR EXCELLENCY, MR. CHAIRMAN:\r\n\r\nIt is with unaffected pleasure that I find myself here to-day. I once\r\nbefore had the pleasure, in another southern city, of addressing the\r\nSouthern Commercial Congress. I then spoke of what the future seemed to\r\nhold in store for this region, which so many of us love and toward the\r\nfuture of which we all look forward with so much confidence and hope.\r\nBut another theme directed me here this time. I do not need to speak of\r\nthe South. She has, perhaps, acquired the gift of speaking for herself.\r\nI come because I want to speak of our present and prospective relations\r\nwith our neighbors to the south. I deemed it a public duty, as well as a\r\npersonal pleasure, to be here to express for myself and for the\r\nGovernment I represent the welcome we all feel to those who represent\r\nthe Latin-American States.\r\n\r\nThe future, ladies and gentlemen, is going to be very different for this\r\nhemisphere from the past. These States lying to the south of us, which\r\nhave always been our neighbors, will now be drawn closer to us by\r\ninnumerable ties, and, I hope, chief of all by the tie of a common\r\nunderstanding of each other. Interest does not tie nations together; it\r\nsometimes separates them. But sympathy and understanding does unite\r\nthem, and I believe that by the new route that is just about to be\r\nopened, while we physically cut two continents asunder, we spiritually\r\nunite them. It is a spiritual union which we seek.\r\n\r\nI wonder if you realize, I wonder if your imaginations have been filled\r\nwith the significance of the tides of commerce. Your Governor alluded in\r\nvery fit and striking terms to the voyage of Columbus, but Columbus took\r\nhis voyage under compulsion of circumstances. Constantinople had been\r\ncaptured by the Turks, and all the routes of trade with the East had\r\nbeen suddenly closed. If there was not a way across the Atlantic to open\r\nthose routes again, they were closed forever; and Columbus set out not\r\nto discover America, for he did not know that it existed, but to\r\ndiscover the eastern shores of Asia. He set sail for Cathay and stumbled\r\nupon America. With that change in the outlook of the world, what\r\nhappened? England, that had been at the back of Europe with an unknown\r\nsea behind her, found that all things had turned as if upon a pivot and\r\nshe was at the front of Europe; and since then all the tides of energy\r\nand enterprise that have issued out of Europe have seemed to be turned\r\nwestward across the Atlantic. But you will notice that they have turned\r\nwestward chiefly north of the Equator, and that it is the northern half\r\nof the globe that has seemed to be filled with the media of intercourse\r\nand of sympathy and of common understanding.\r\n\r\nDo you not see now what is about to happen? These great tides which have\r\nbeen running along parallels of latitude will now swing southward\r\nathwart parallels of latitude, and that opening gate at the Isthmus of\r\nPanama will open the world to a commerce that she has not known before,\r\na commerce of intelligence, of thought, and sympathy between North and\r\nSouth. The Latin-American States which, to their disadvantage, have been\r\noff the main lines will now be on the main lines. I feel that these\r\ngentlemen honoring us with their presence to-day will presently find\r\nthat some part, at any rate, of the center of gravity of the world has\r\nshifted. Do you realize that New York, for example, will be nearer the\r\nwestern coast of South America than she is now to the eastern coast of\r\nSouth America? Do you realize that a line drawn northward parallel with\r\nthe greater part of the western coast of South America will run only\r\nabout one hundred and fifty miles west of New York? The great bulk of\r\nSouth America, if you will look at your globes (not at your Mercator's\r\nprojection), lies eastward of the continent of North America. You will\r\nrealize that when you realize that the canal will run southeast, not\r\nsouthwest, and that when you get into the Pacific you will be farther\r\neast then you were when you left the Gulf of Mexico. These things are\r\nsignificant, therefore, of this, that we are closing one chapter in the\r\nhistory of the world and are opening another of great, unimaginable\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nThere is one peculiarity about the history of the Latin-American States\r\nwhich I am sure they are keenly aware of. You hear of \"concessions\" to\r\nforeign capitalists in Latin America. You do not hear of concessions to\r\nforeign capitalists in the United States. They are not granted\r\nconcessions. They are invited to make investments. The work is ours,\r\nthough they are welcome to invest in it. We do not ask them to supply\r\nthe capital and do the work. It is an invitation, not a privilege; and\r\nStates that are obliged, because their territory does not lie within the\r\nmain field of modern enterprise and action, to grant concessions are in\r\nthis condition, that foreign interests are apt to dominate their\r\ndomestic affairs, a condition of affairs always dangerous and apt to\r\nbecome intolerable. What these States are going to see, therefore, is an\r\nemancipation from the subordination, which has been inevitable, to\r\nforeign enterprise and an assertion of the splendid character which, in\r\nspite of these difficulties, they have again and again been able to\r\ndemonstrate. The dignity, the courage, the self-possession, the\r\nself-respect of the Latin-American States, their achievements in the\r\nface of all these adverse circumstances, deserve nothing but the\r\nadmiration and applause of the world. They have had harder bargains\r\ndriven with them in the matter of loans than any other peoples in the\r\nworld. Interest has been exacted of them that was not exacted of anybody\r\nelse, because the risk was said to be greater; and then securities were\r\ntaken that destroyed the risk--an admirable arrangement for those who\r\nwere forcing the terms! I rejoice in nothing so much as in the prospect\r\nthat they will now be emancipated from these conditions; and we ought to\r\nbe the first to take part in assisting in that emancipation. I think\r\nsome of these gentlemen have already had occasion to bear witness that\r\nthe Department of State in recent months has tried to serve them in that\r\nwise. In the future they will draw closer and closer to us because of\r\ncircumstances of which I wish to speak with moderation and, I hope,\r\nwithout indiscretion.\r\n\r\nWe must prove ourselves their friends and champions upon terms of\r\nequality and honor. You cannot be friends upon any other terms than upon\r\nthe terms of equality. You cannot be friends at all except upon the\r\nterms of honor. We must show ourselves friends by comprehending their\r\ninterest whether it squares with our own interest or not. It is a very\r\nperilous thing to determine the foreign policy of a nation in the terms\r\nof material interest. It not only is unfair to those with whom you are\r\ndealing, but it is degrading as regards your own actions.\r\n\r\nComprehension must be the soil in which shall grow all the fruits of\r\nfriendship, and there is a reason and a compulsion lying behind all this\r\nwhich is dearer than anything else to the thoughtful men of America. I\r\nmean the development of constitutional liberty in the world. Human\r\nrights, national integrity, and opportunity as against material\r\ninterests--that, ladies and gentlemen, is the issue which we now have to\r\nface. I want to take this occasion to say that the United States will\r\nnever again seek one additional foot of territory by conquest. She will\r\ndevote herself to showing that she knows how to make honorable and\r\nfruitful use of the territory she has, and she must regard it as one of\r\nthe duties of friendship to see that from no quarter are material\r\ninterests made superior to human liberty and national opportunity. I say\r\nthis, not with a single thought that anyone will gainsay it, but merely\r\nto fix in our consciousness what our real relationship with the rest of\r\nAmerica is. It is the relationship of a family of mankind devoted to the\r\ndevelopment of true constitutional liberty. We know that that is the\r\nsoil out of which the best enterprise springs. We know that this is a\r\ncause which we are making in common with our neighbors, because we have\r\nhad to make it for ourselves.\r\n\r\nReference has been made here to-day to some of the national problems\r\nwhich confront us as a nation. What is at the heart of all our national\r\nproblems? It is that we have seen the hand of material interest\r\nsometimes about to close upon our dearest rights and possessions. We\r\nhave seen material interests threaten constitutional freedom in the\r\nUnited States. Therefore we will now know how to sympathize with those\r\nin the rest of America who have to contend with such powers, not only\r\nwithin their borders but from outside their borders also.\r\n\r\nI know what the response of the thought and heart of America will be to\r\nthe program I have outlined, because America was created to realize a\r\nprogram like that. This is not America because it is rich. This is not\r\nAmerica because it has set up for a great population great\r\nopportunities of material prosperity. America is a name which sounds in\r\nthe ears of men everywhere as a synonym with individual opportunity\r\nbecause a synonym of individual liberty. I would rather belong to a poor\r\nnation that was free than to a rich nation that had ceased to be in love\r\nwith liberty. But we shall not be poor if we love liberty, because the\r\nnation that loves liberty truly sets every man free to do his best and\r\nbe his best, and that means the release of all the splendid energies of\r\na great people who think for themselves. A nation of employees cannot be\r\nfree any more than a nation of employers can be.\r\n\r\nIn emphasizing the points which must unite us in sympathy and in\r\nspiritual interest with the Latin-American peoples we are only\r\nemphasizing the points of our own life, and we should prove ourselves\r\nuntrue to our own traditions if we proved ourselves untrue friends to\r\nthem. Do not think, therefore, gentlemen, that the questions of the day\r\nare mere questions of policy and diplomacy. They are shot through with\r\nthe principles of life. We dare not turn from the principle that\r\nmorality and not expediency is the thing that must guide us and that we\r\nwill never condone iniquity because it is most convenient to do so. It\r\nseems to me that this is a day of infinite hope, of confidence in a\r\nfuture greater than the past has been, for I am fain to believe that in\r\nspite of all the things that we wish to correct the nineteenth century\r\nthat now lies behind us has brought us a long stage toward the time\r\nwhen, slowly ascending the tedious climb that leads to the final\r\nuplands, we shall get our ultimate view of the duties of mankind. We\r\nhave breasted a considerable part of that climb and shall presently--it\r\nmay be in a generation or two--come out upon those great heights where\r\nthere shines unobstructed the light of the justice of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF THE UNION\r\n\r\n[Address delivered at a joint session of the two Houses of Congress,\r\nDecember 2, 1913.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. SPEAKER, MR. PRESIDENT, GENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of my constitutional duty to \"give to the Congress\r\ninformation of the state of the Union,\" I take the liberty of addressing\r\nyou on several matters which ought, as it seems to me, particularly to\r\nengage the attention of your honorable bodies, as of all who study the\r\nwelfare and progress of the Nation.\r\n\r\nI shall ask your indulgence if I venture to depart in some degree from\r\nthe usual custom of setting before you in formal review the many matters\r\nwhich have engaged the attention and called for the action of the\r\nseveral departments of the Government or which look to them for early\r\ntreatment in the future, because the list is long, very long, and would\r\nsuffer in the abbreviation to which I should have to subject it. I shall\r\nsubmit to you the reports of the heads of the several departments, in\r\nwhich these subjects are set forth in careful detail, and beg that they\r\nmay receive the thoughtful attention of your committees and of all\r\nMembers of the Congress who may have the leisure to study them. Their\r\nobvious importance, as constituting the very substance of the business\r\nof the Government, makes comment and emphasis on my part unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe country, I am thankful to say, is at peace with all the world, and\r\nmany happy manifestations multiply about us of a growing cordiality and\r\nsense of community of interest among the nations, foreshadowing an age\r\nof settled peace and good will. More and more readily each decade do the\r\nnations manifest their willingness to bind themselves by solemn treaty\r\nto the processes of peace, the processes of frankness and fair\r\nconcession. So far the United States has stood at the front of such\r\nnegotiations. She will, I earnestly hope and confidently believe, give\r\nfresh proof of her sincere adherence to the cause of international\r\nfriendship by ratifying the several treaties of arbitration awaiting\r\nrenewal by the Senate. In addition to these, it has been the privilege\r\nof the Department of State to gain the assent, in principle, of no less\r\nthan thirty-one nations, representing four-fifths of the population of\r\nthe world, to the negotiation of treaties by which it shall be agreed\r\nthat whenever differences of interest or of policy arise which cannot be\r\nresolved by the ordinary processes of diplomacy they shall be publicly\r\nanalyzed, discussed, and reported upon by a tribunal chosen by the\r\nparties before either nation determines its course of action.\r\n\r\nThere is only one possible standard by which to determine controversies\r\nbetween the United States and other nations, and that is compounded of\r\nthese two elements: Our own honor and our obligations to the peace of\r\nthe world. A test so compounded ought easily to be made to govern both\r\nthe establishment of new treaty obligations and the interpretation of\r\nthose already assumed.\r\n\r\nThere is but one cloud upon our horizon. That has shown itself to the\r\nsouth of us, and hangs over Mexico. There can be no certain prospect of\r\npeace in America until Gen. Huerta has surrendered his usurped authority\r\nin Mexico; until it is understood on all hands, indeed, that such\r\npretended governments will not be countenanced or dealt with by the\r\nGovernment of the United States. We are the friends of constitutional\r\ngovernment in America; we are more than its friends, we are its\r\nchampions; because in no other way can our neighbors, to whom we would\r\nwish in every way to make proof of our friendship, work out their own\r\ndevelopment in peace and liberty. Mexico has no Government. The attempt\r\nto maintain one at the City of Mexico has broken down, and a mere\r\nmilitary despotism has been set up which has hardly more than the\r\nsemblance of national authority. It originated in the usurpation of\r\nVictoriano Huerta, who, after a brief attempt to play the part of\r\nconstitutional President, has at last cast aside even the pretense of\r\nlegal right and declared himself dictator. As a consequence, a condition\r\nof affairs now exists in Mexico which has made it doubtful whether even\r\nthe most elementary and fundamental rights either of her own people or\r\nof the citizens of other countries resident within her territory can\r\nlong be successfully safeguarded, and which threatens, if long\r\ncontinued, to imperil the interests of peace, order, and tolerable life\r\nin the lands immediately to the south of us. Even if the usurper had\r\nsucceeded in his purposes, in despite of the constitution of the\r\nRepublic and the rights of its people, he would have set up nothing but\r\na precarious and hateful power, which could have lasted but a little\r\nwhile, and whose eventual downfall would have left the country in a more\r\ndeplorable condition than ever. But he has not succeeded. He has\r\nforfeited the respect and the moral support even of those who were at\r\none time willing to see him succeed. Little by little he has been\r\ncompletely isolated. By a little every day his power and prestige are\r\ncrumbling and the collapse is not far away. We shall not, I believe, be\r\nobliged to alter our policy of watchful waiting. And then, when the end\r\ncomes, we shall hope to see constitutional order restored in distressed\r\nMexico by the concert and energy of such of her leaders as prefer the\r\nliberty of their people to their own ambitions.\r\n\r\nI turn to matters of domestic concern. You already have under\r\nconsideration a bill for the reform of our system of banking and\r\ncurrency, for which the country waits with impatience, as for something\r\nfundamental to its whole business life and necessary to set credit free\r\nfrom arbitrary and artificial restraints. I need not say how earnestly I\r\nhope for its early enactment into law. I take leave to beg that the\r\nwhole energy and attention of the Senate be concentrated upon it till\r\nthe matter is successfully disposed of. And yet I feel that the request\r\nis not needed--that the Members of that great House need no urging in\r\nthis service to the country.\r\n\r\nI present to you, in addition, the urgent necessity that special\r\nprovision be made also for facilitating the credits needed by the\r\nfarmers of the country. The pending currency bill does the farmers a\r\ngreat service. It puts them upon an equal footing with other business\r\nmen and masters of enterprise, as it should; and upon its passage they\r\nwill find themselves quit of many of the difficulties which now hamper\r\nthem in the field of credit. The farmers, of course, ask and should be\r\ngiven no special privilege, such as extending to them the credit of the\r\nGovernment itself. What they need and should obtain is legislation which\r\nwill make their own abundant and substantial credit resources available\r\nas a foundation for joint, concerted local action in their own behalf in\r\ngetting the capital they must use. It is to this we should now address\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nIt has, singularly enough, come to pass that we have allowed the\r\nindustry of our farms to lag behind the other activities of the country\r\nin its development. I need not stop to tell you how fundamental to the\r\nlife of the Nation is the production of its food. Our thoughts may\r\nordinarily be concentrated upon the cities and the hives of industry,\r\nupon the cries of the crowded market place and the clangor of the\r\nfactory, but it is from the quiet interspaces of the open valleys and\r\nthe free hillsides that we draw the sources of life and of prosperity,\r\nfrom the farm and the ranch, from the forest and the mine. Without these\r\nevery street would be silent, every office deserted, every factory\r\nfallen into disrepair. And yet the farmer does not stand upon the same\r\nfooting with the forester and the miner in the market of credit. He is\r\nthe servant of the seasons. Nature determines how long he must wait for\r\nhis crops, and will not be hurried in her processes. He may give his\r\nnote, but the season of its maturity depends upon the season when his\r\ncrop matures, lies at the gates of the market where his products are\r\nsold. And the security he gives is of a character not known in the\r\nbroker's office or as familiarly as it might be on the counter of the\r\nbanker.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural Department of the Government is seeking to assist as\r\nnever before to make farming an efficient business, of wide cooeperative\r\neffort, in quick touch with the markets for food-stuffs. The farmers and\r\nthe Government will henceforth work together as real partners in this\r\nfield, where we now begin to see our way very clearly and where many\r\nintelligent plans are already being put into execution. The Treasury of\r\nthe United States has, by a timely and well-considered distribution of\r\nits deposits, facilitated the moving of the crops in the present season\r\nand prevented the scarcity of available funds too often experienced at\r\nsuch times. But we must not allow ourselves to depend upon extraordinary\r\nexpedients. We must add the means by which the farmer may make his\r\ncredit constantly and easily available and command when he will the\r\ncapital by which to support and expand his business. We lag behind many\r\nother great countries of the modern world in attempting to do this.\r\nSystems of rural credit have been studied and developed on the other\r\nside of the water while we left our farmers to shift for themselves in\r\nthe ordinary money market. You have but to look about you in any rural\r\ndistrict to see the result, the handicap and embarrassment which have\r\nbeen put upon those who produce our food.\r\n\r\nConscious of this backwardness and neglect on our part, the Congress\r\nrecently authorized the creation of a special commission to study the\r\nvarious systems of rural credit which have been put into operation in\r\nEurope, and this commission is already prepared to report. Its report\r\nought to make it easier for us to determine what methods will be best\r\nsuited to our own farmers. I hope and believe that the committees of the\r\nSenate and House will address themselves selves to this matter with the\r\nmost fruitful results, and I believe that the studies and recently\r\nformed plans of the Department of Agriculture may be made to serve them\r\nvery greatly in their work of framing appropriate and adequate\r\nlegislation. It would be indiscreet and presumptuous in anyone to\r\ndogmatize upon so great and many-sided a question, but I feel confident\r\nthat common counsel will produce the results we must all desire.\r\n\r\nTurn from the farm to the world of business which centers in the city\r\nand in the factory, and I think that all thoughtful observers will agree\r\nthat the immediate service we owe the business communities of the\r\ncountry is to prevent private monopoly more effectually than it has yet\r\nbeen prevented. I think it will be easily agreed that we should let the\r\nSherman antitrust law stand, unaltered, as it is, with its debatable\r\nground about it, but that we should as much as possible reduce the area\r\nof that debatable ground by further and more explicit legislation; and\r\nshould also supplement that great act by legislation which will not\r\nonly clarify it but also facilitate its administration and make it\r\nfairer to all concerned. No doubt we shall all wish, and the country\r\nwill expect, this to be the central subject of our deliberations during\r\nthe present session; but it is a subject so many-sided and so deserving\r\nof careful and discriminating discussion that I shall take the liberty\r\nof addressing you upon it in a special message at a later date than\r\nthis. It is of capital importance that the business men of this country\r\nshould be relieved of all uncertainties of law with regard to their\r\nenterprises and investments and a clear path indicated which they can\r\ntravel without anxiety. It is as important that they should be relieved\r\nof embarrassment and set free to prosper as that private monopoly should\r\nbe destroyed. The ways of action should be thrown wide open.\r\n\r\nI turn to a subject which I hope can be handled promptly and without\r\nserious controversy of any kind. I mean the method of selecting nominees\r\nfor the Presidency of the United States. I feel confident that I do not\r\nmisinterpret the wishes or the expectations of the country when I urge\r\nthe prompt enactment of legislation which will provide for primary\r\nelections throughout the country at which the voters of the several\r\nparties may choose their nominees for the Presidency without the\r\nintervention of nominating conventions. I venture the suggestion that\r\nthis legislation should provide for the retention of party conventions,\r\nbut only for the purpose of declaring and accepting the verdict of the\r\nprimaries and formulating the platforms of the parties; and I suggest\r\nthat these conventions should consist not of delegates chosen for this\r\nsingle purpose, but of the nominees for Congress, the nominees for\r\nvacant seats in the Senate of the United States, the Senators whose\r\nterms have not yet closed, the national committees, and the candidates\r\nfor the Presidency themselves, in order that platforms may be framed by\r\nthose responsible to the people for carrying them into effect.\r\n\r\nThese are all matters of vital domestic concern, and besides them,\r\noutside the charmed circle of our own national life in which our\r\naffections command us, as well as our consciences, there stand out our\r\nobligations toward our territories over sea. Here we are trustees. Porto\r\nRico, Hawaii, the Philippines, are ours, indeed, but not ours to do what\r\nwe please with. Such territories, once regarded as mere possessions, are\r\nno longer to be selfishly exploited; they are part of the domain of\r\npublic conscience and of serviceable and enlightened statesmanship. We\r\nmust administer them for the people who live in them and with the same\r\nsense of responsibility to them as toward our own people in our domestic\r\naffairs. No doubt we shall successfully enough bind Porto Rico and the\r\nHawaiian Islands to ourselves by ties of justice and interest and\r\naffection, but the performance of our duty toward the Philippines is a\r\nmore difficult and debatable matter. We can satisfy the obligations of\r\ngenerous justice toward the people of Porto Rico by giving them the\r\nample and familiar rights and privileges accorded our own citizens in\r\nour own territories and our obligations toward the people of Hawaii by\r\nperfecting the provisions for self-government already granted them, but\r\nin the Philippines we must go further. We must hold steadily in view\r\ntheir ultimate independence, and we must move toward the time of that\r\nindependence as steadily as the way can be cleared and the foundations\r\nthoughtfully and permanently laid.\r\n\r\nActing under the authority conferred upon the President by Congress, I\r\nhave already accorded the people of the islands a majority in both\r\nhouses of their legislative body by appointing five instead of four\r\nnative citizens to the membership of the commission. I believe that in\r\nthis way we shall make proof of their capacity in counsel and their\r\nsense of responsibility in the exercise of political power, and that the\r\nsuccess of this step will be sure to clear our view for the steps which\r\nare to follow. Step by step we should extend and perfect the system of\r\nself-government in the islands, making test of them and modifying them\r\nas experience discloses their successes and their failures; that we\r\nshould more and more put under the control of the native citizens of the\r\narchipelago the essential instruments of their life, their local\r\ninstrumentalities of government, their schools, all the common interests\r\nof their communities, and so by counsel and experience set up a\r\ngovernment which all the world will see to be suitable to a people whose\r\naffairs are under their own control. At last, I hope and believe, we are\r\nbeginning to gain the confidence of the Filipino peoples. By their\r\ncounsel and experience, rather than by our own, we shall learn how best\r\nto serve them and how soon it will be possible and wise to withdraw our\r\nsupervision. Let us once find the path and set out with firm and\r\nconfident tread upon it and we shall not wander from it or linger upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nA duty faces us with regard to Alaska which seems to me very pressing\r\nand very imperative; perhaps I should say a double duty, for it concerns\r\nboth the political and the material development of the Territory. The\r\npeople of Alaska should be given the full Territorial form of\r\ngovernment, and Alaska, as a storehouse, should be unlocked. One key to\r\nit is a system of railways. These the Government should itself build and\r\nadminister, and the ports and terminals it should itself control in the\r\ninterest of all who wish to use them for the service and development of\r\nthe country and its people.\r\n\r\nBut the construction of railways is only the first step; is only\r\nthrusting in the key to the storehouse and throwing back the lock and\r\nopening the door. How the tempting resources of the country are to be\r\nexploited is another matter, to which I shall take the liberty of from\r\ntime to time calling your attention, for it is a policy which must be\r\nworked out by well-considered stages, not upon theory, but upon lines of\r\npractical expediency. It is part of our general problem of conservation.\r\nWe have a freer hand in working out the problem in Alaska than in the\r\nStates of the Union; and yet the principle and object are the same,\r\nwherever we touch it. We must use the resources of the country, not lock\r\nthem up. There need be no conflict or jealousy as between State and\r\nFederal authorities, for there can be no essential difference of purpose\r\nbetween them. The resources in question must be used, but not destroyed\r\nor wasted; used, but not monopolized upon any narrow idea of individual\r\nrights as against the abiding interests of communities. That a policy\r\ncan be worked out by conference and concession which will release these\r\nresources and yet not jeopard or dissipate them, I for one have no\r\ndoubt; and it can be done on lines of regulation which need be no less\r\nacceptable to the people and governments of the States concerned than to\r\nthe people and Government of the Nation at large, whose heritage these\r\nresources are. We must bend our counsels to this end. A common purpose\r\nought to make agreement easy.\r\n\r\nThree or four matters of special importance and significance I beg that\r\nyou will permit me to mention in closing.\r\n\r\nOur Bureau of Mines ought to be equipped and empowered to render even\r\nmore effectual service than it renders now in improving the conditions\r\nof mine labor and making the mines more economically productive as well\r\nas more safe. This is an all-important part of the work of\r\nconservation; and the conservation of human life and energy lies even\r\nnearer to our interest than the preservation from waste of our material\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nWe owe it, in mere justice to the railway employees of the country, to\r\nprovide for them a fair and effective employers' liability act; and a\r\nlaw that we can stand by in this matter will be no less to the advantage\r\nof those who administer the railroads of the country than to the\r\nadvantage of those whom they employ. The experience of a large number of\r\nthe States abundantly proves that.\r\n\r\nWe ought to devote ourselves to meeting pressing demands of plain\r\njustice like this as earnestly as to the accomplishment of political and\r\neconomic reforms. Social justice comes first. Law is the machinery for\r\nits realization and is vital only as it expresses and embodies it.\r\n\r\nAn international congress for the discussion of all questions that\r\naffect safety at sea is now sitting in London at the suggestion of our\r\nown Government. So soon as the conclusions of that congress can be\r\nlearned and considered we ought to address ourselves, among other\r\nthings, to the prompt alleviation of the very unsafe, unjust, and\r\nburdensome conditions which now surround the employment of sailors and\r\nrender it extremely difficult to obtain the services of spirited and\r\ncompetent men such as every ship needs if it is to be safely handled and\r\nbrought to port.\r\n\r\nMay I not express the very real pleasure I have experienced in\r\ncooeperating with this Congress and sharing with it the labors of common\r\nservice to which it has devoted itself so unreservedly during the past\r\nseven months of uncomplaining concentration upon the business of\r\nlegislation? Surely it is a proper and pertinent part of my report on\r\n\"the state of the Union\" to express my admiration for the diligence, the\r\ngood temper, and the full comprehension of public duty which has already\r\nbeen manifested by both the Houses; and I hope that it may not be\r\ndeemed an impertinent intrusion of myself into the picture if I say with\r\nhow much and how constant satisfaction I have availed myself of the\r\nprivilege of putting my time and energy at their disposal alike in\r\ncounsel and in action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRUSTS AND MONOPOLIES\r\n\r\n[Address delivered at a joint session of the two Houses of Congress,\r\nJanuary 20, 1914.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nIn my report \"on the state of the Union,\" which I had the privilege of\r\nreading to you on the 2d of December last, I ventured to reserve for\r\ndiscussion at a later date the subject of additional legislation\r\nregarding the very difficult and intricate matter of trusts and\r\nmonopolies. The time now seems opportune to turn to that great question;\r\nnot only because the currency legislation, which absorbed your attention\r\nand the attention of the country in December, is now disposed of, but\r\nalso because opinion seems to be clearing about us with singular\r\nrapidity in this other great field of action. In the matter of the\r\ncurrency it cleared suddenly and very happily after the much-debated Act\r\nwas passed; in respect of the monopolies which have multiplied about us\r\nand in regard to the various means by which they have been organized and\r\nmaintained it seems to be coming to a clear and all but universal\r\nagreement in anticipation of our action, as if by way of preparation,\r\nmaking the way easier to see and easier to set out upon with confidence\r\nand without confusion of counsel.\r\n\r\nLegislation has its atmosphere like everything else, and the atmosphere\r\nof accommodation and mutual understanding which we now breathe with so\r\nmuch refreshment is matter of sincere congratulation. It ought to make\r\nour task very much less difficult and embarrassing than it would have\r\nbeen had we been obliged to continue to act amidst the atmosphere of\r\nsuspicion and antagonism which has so long made it impossible to\r\napproach such questions with dispassionate fairness. Constructive\r\nlegislation, when successful, is always the embodiment of convincing\r\nexperience, and of the mature public opinion which finally springs out\r\nof that experience. Legislation is a business of interpretation, not of\r\norigination; and it is now plain what the opinion is to which we must\r\ngive effect in this matter. It is not recent or hasty opinion. It\r\nsprings out of the experience of a whole generation. It has clarified\r\nitself by long contest, and those who for a long time battled with it\r\nand sought to change it are now frankly and honorably yielding to it and\r\nseeking to conform their actions to it.\r\n\r\nThe great business men who organized and financed monopoly and those who\r\nadministered it in actual everyday transactions have year after year,\r\nuntil now, either denied its existence or justified it as necessary for\r\nthe effective maintenance and development of the vast business processes\r\nof the country in the modern circumstances of trade and manufacture and\r\nfinance; but all the while opinion has made head against them. The\r\naverage business man is convinced that the ways of liberty are also the\r\nways of peace and the ways of success as well; and at last the masters\r\nof business on the great scale have begun to yield their preference and\r\npurpose, perhaps their judgment also, in honorable surrender.\r\n\r\nWhat we are purposing to do, therefore, is, happily, not to hamper or\r\ninterfere with business as enlightened business men prefer to do it, or\r\nin any sense to put it under the ban. The antagonism between business\r\nand government is over. We are now about to give expression to the best\r\nbusiness judgment of America, to what we know to be the business\r\nconscience and honor of the land. The Government and business men are\r\nready to meet each other half-way in a common effort to square business\r\nmethods with both public opinion and the law. The best informed men of\r\nthe business world condemn the methods and processes and consequences of\r\nmonopoly as we condemn them; and the instinctive judgment of the vast\r\nmajority of business men everywhere goes with them. We shall now be\r\ntheir spokesmen. That is the strength of our position and the sure\r\nprophecy of what will ensue when our reasonable work is done.\r\n\r\nWhen serious contest ends, when men unite in opinion and purpose, those\r\nwho are to change their ways of business joining with those who ask for\r\nthe change, it is possible to effect it in the way in which prudent and\r\nthoughtful and patriotic men would wish to see it brought about with as\r\nfew, as slight, as easy and simple business readjustments as possible in\r\nthe circumstances, nothing essential disturbed, nothing torn up by the\r\nroots, no parts rent asunder which can be left in wholesome combination.\r\nFortunately, no measures of sweeping or novel change are necessary. It\r\nwill be understood that our object is _not_ to unsettle business or\r\nanywhere seriously to break its established courses athwart. On the\r\ncontrary, we desire the laws we are now about to pass to be the bulwarks\r\nand safeguards of industry against the forces that have disturbed it.\r\nWhat we have to do can be done in a new spirit, in thoughtful\r\nmoderation, without revolution of any untoward kind.\r\n\r\nWe are all agreed that \"private monopoly is indefensible and\r\nintolerable,\" and our program is founded upon that conviction. It will\r\nbe a comprehensive but not a radical or unacceptable program and these\r\nare its items, the changes which opinion deliberately sanctions and for\r\nwhich business waits:\r\n\r\nIt waits with acquiescence, in the first place, for laws which will\r\neffectually prohibit and prevent such interlockings of the _personnel_\r\nof the directorates of great corporations--banks and railroads,\r\nindustrial, commercial, and public service bodies--as in effect result\r\nin making those who borrow and those who lend practically one and the\r\nsame, those who sell and those who buy but the same persons trading with\r\none another under different names and in different combinations, and\r\nthose who affect to compete in fact partners and masters of some whole\r\nfield of business. Sufficient time should be allowed, of course, in\r\nwhich to effect these changes of organization without inconvenience or\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nSuch a prohibition will work much more than a mere negative good by\r\ncorrecting the serious evils which have arisen because, for example, the\r\nmen who have been the directing spirits of the great investment banks\r\nhave usurped the place which belongs to independent industrial\r\nmanagement working in its own behoof. It will bring new men, new\r\nenergies, a new spirit of initiative, new blood, into the management of\r\nour great business enterprises. It will open the field of industrial\r\ndevelopment and origination to scores of men who have been obliged to\r\nserve when their abilities entitled them to direct. It will immensely\r\nhearten the young men coming on and will greatly enrich the business\r\nactivities of the whole country.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, business men as well as those who direct public\r\naffairs now recognize, and recognize with painful clearness, the great\r\nharm and injustice which has been done to many, if not all, of the great\r\nrailroad systems of the country by the way in which they have been\r\nfinanced and their own distinctive interests subordinated to the\r\ninterests of the men who financed them and of other business enterprises\r\nwhich those men wished to promote. The country is ready, therefore, to\r\naccept, and accept with relief as well as approval, a law which will\r\nconfer upon the Interstate Commerce Commission the power to superintend\r\nand regulate the financial operations by which the railroads are\r\nhenceforth to be supplied with the money they need for their proper\r\ndevelopment to meet the rapidly growing requirements of the country for\r\nincreased and improved facilities of transportation. We cannot postpone\r\naction in this matter without leaving the railroads exposed to many\r\nserious handicaps and hazards; and the prosperity of the railroads and\r\nthe prosperity of the country are inseparably connected. Upon this\r\nquestion those who are chiefly responsible for the actual management and\r\noperation of the railroads have spoken very plainly and very earnestly,\r\nwith a purpose we ought to be quick to accept. It will be one step, and\r\na very important one, toward the necessary separation of the business of\r\nproduction from the business of transportation.\r\n\r\nThe business of the country awaits also, has long awaited and has\r\nsuffered because it could not obtain, further and more explicit\r\nlegislative definition of the policy and meaning of the existing\r\nantitrust law. Nothing hampers business like uncertainty. Nothing daunts\r\nor discourages it like the necessity to take chances, to run the risk of\r\nfalling under the condemnation of the law before it can make sure just\r\nwhat the law is. Surely we are sufficiently familiar with the actual\r\nprocesses and methods of monopoly and of the many hurtful restraints of\r\ntrade to make definition possible, at any rate up to the limits of what\r\nexperience has disclosed. These practices, being now abundantly\r\ndisclosed, can be explicitly and item by item forbidden by statute in\r\nsuch terms as will practically eliminate uncertainty, the law itself and\r\nthe penalty being made equally plain.\r\n\r\nAnd the business men of the country desire something more than that the\r\nmenace of legal process in these matters be made explicit and\r\nintelligible. They desire the advice, the definite guidance and\r\ninformation which can be supplied by an administrative body, an\r\ninterstate trade commission.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the country would instantly approve of such a commission.\r\nIt would not wish to see it empowered to make terms with monopoly or in\r\nany sort to assume control of business, as if the Government made itself\r\nresponsible. It demands such a commission only as an indispensable\r\ninstrument of information and publicity, as a clearing house for the\r\nfacts by which both the public mind and the managers of great business\r\nundertakings should be guided, and as an instrumentality for doing\r\njustice to business where the processes of the courts or the natural\r\nforces of correction outside the courts are inadequate to adjust the\r\nremedy to the wrong in a way that will meet all the equities and\r\ncircumstances of the case.\r\n\r\nProducing industries, for example, which have passed the point up to\r\nwhich combination may be consistent with the public interest and the\r\nfreedom of trade, cannot always be dissected into their component units\r\nas readily as railroad companies or similar organizations can be. Their\r\ndissolution by ordinary legal process may oftentimes involve financial\r\nconsequences likely to overwhelm the security market and bring upon it\r\nbreakdown and confusion. There ought to be an administrative commission\r\ncapable of directing and shaping such corrective processes, not only in\r\naid of the courts but also by independent suggestion, if necessary.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as our object and the spirit of our action in these matters is\r\nto meet business half-way in its processes of self-correction and\r\ndisturb its legitimate course as little as possible, we ought to see to\r\nit, and the judgment of practical and sagacious men of affairs\r\neverywhere would applaud us if we did see to it, that penalties and\r\npunishments should fall, not upon business itself, to its confusion and\r\ninterruption, but upon the individuals who use the instrumentalities of\r\nbusiness to do things which public policy and sound business practice\r\ncondemn. Every act of business is done at the command or upon the\r\ninitiative of some ascertainable person or group of persons. These\r\nshould be held individually responsible and the punishment should fall\r\nupon them, not upon the business organization of which they make illegal\r\nuse. It should be one of the main objects of our legislation to divest\r\nsuch persons of their corporate cloak and deal with them as with those\r\nwho do not represent their corporations, but merely by deliberate\r\nintention break the law. Business men the country through would, I am\r\nsure, applaud us if we were to take effectual steps to see that the\r\nofficers and directors of great business bodies were prevented from\r\nbringing them and the business of the country into disrepute and danger.\r\n\r\nOther questions remain which will need very thoughtful and practical\r\ntreatment. Enterprises, in these modern days of great individual\r\nfortunes, are oftentimes interlocked, not by being under the control of\r\nthe same directors, but by the fact that the greater part of their\r\ncorporate stock is owned by a single person or group of persons who are\r\nin some way ultimately related in interest. We are agreed, I take it,\r\nthat holding _companies_ should be prohibited, but what of the\r\ncontrolling private ownership of individuals or actually cooeperative\r\ngroups of individuals? Shall the private owners of capital stock be\r\nsuffered to be themselves in effect holding companies? We do not wish, I\r\nsuppose, to forbid the purchase of stocks by any person who pleases to\r\nbuy them in such quantities as he can afford, or in any way arbitrarily\r\nto limit the sale of stocks to bona fide purchasers. Shall we require\r\nthe owners of stock, when their voting power in several companies which\r\nought to be independent of one another would constitute actual control,\r\nto make election in which of them they will exercise their right to\r\nvote? This question I venture for your consideration.\r\n\r\nThere is another matter in which imperative considerations of justice\r\nand fair play suggest thoughtful remedial action. Not only do many of\r\nthe combinations effected or sought to be effected in the industrial\r\nworld work an injustice upon the public in general; they also directly\r\nand seriously injure the individuals who are put out of business in one\r\nunfair way or another by the many dislodging and exterminating forces of\r\ncombination. I hope that we shall agree in giving private individuals\r\nwho claim to have been injured by these processes the right to found\r\ntheir suits for redress upon the facts and judgments proved and entered\r\nin suits by the Government where the Government has upon its own\r\ninitiative sued the combinations complained of and won its suit, and\r\nthat the statute of limitations shall be suffered to run against such\r\nlitigants only from the date of the conclusion of the Government's\r\naction. It is not fair that the private litigant should be obliged to\r\nset up and establish again the facts which the Government has proved. He\r\ncannot afford, he has not the power, to make use of such processes of\r\ninquiry as the Government has command of. Thus shall individual justice\r\nbe done while the processes of business are rectified and squared with\r\nthe general conscience.\r\n\r\nI have laid the case before you, no doubt as it lies in your own mind,\r\nas it lies in the thought of the country. What must every candid man say\r\nof the suggestions I have laid before you, of the plain obligations of\r\nwhich I have reminded you? That these are new things for which the\r\ncountry is not prepared? No; but that they are old things, now familiar,\r\nand must of course be undertaken if we are to square our laws with the\r\nthought and desire of the country. Until these things are done,\r\nconscientious business men the country over will be unsatisfied. They\r\nare in these things our mentors and colleagues. We are now about to\r\nwrite the additional articles of our constitution of peace, the peace\r\nthat is honor and freedom and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPANAMA CANAL TOLLS\r\n\r\n[Address delivered at a joint session of the two Houses of Congress,\r\nMarch 5, 1914.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nI have come to you upon an errand which can be very briefly performed,\r\nbut I beg that you will not measure its importance by the number of\r\nsentences in which I state it. No communication I have addressed to the\r\nCongress carried with it graver or more far-reaching implications as to\r\nthe interest of the country, and I come now to speak upon a matter with\r\nregard to which I am charged in a peculiar degree, by the Constitution\r\nitself, with personal responsibility.\r\n\r\nI have come to ask you for the repeal of that provision of the Panama\r\nCanal Act of August 24, 1912, which exempts vessels engaged in the\r\ncoastwise trade of the United States from payment of tolls, and to urge\r\nupon you the justice, the wisdom, and the large policy of such a repeal\r\nwith the utmost earnestness of which I am capable.\r\n\r\nIn my own judgment, very fully considered and maturely formed, that\r\nexemption constitutes a mistaken economic policy from every point of\r\nview, and is, moreover, in plain contravention of the treaty with Great\r\nBritain concerning the canal concluded on November 18, 1901. But I have\r\nnot come to urge upon you my personal views. I have come to state to you\r\na fact and a situation. Whatever may be our own differences of opinion\r\nconcerning this much debated measure, its meaning is not debated outside\r\nthe United States. Everywhere else the language of the treaty is given\r\nbut one interpretation, and that interpretation precludes the exemption\r\nI am asking you to repeal. We consented to the treaty; its language we\r\naccepted, if we did not originate it; and we are too big, too powerful,\r\ntoo self-respecting a nation to interpret with a too strained or refined\r\nreading the words of our own promises just because we have power enough\r\nto give us leave to read them as we please. The large thing to do is the\r\nonly thing we can afford to do, a voluntary withdrawal from a position\r\neverywhere questioned and misunderstood. We ought to reverse our action\r\nwithout raising the question whether we were right or wrong, and so once\r\nmore deserve our reputation for generosity and for the redemption of\r\nevery obligation without quibble or hesitation.\r\n\r\nI ask this of you in support of the foreign policy of the\r\nadministration. I shall not know how to deal with other matters of even\r\ngreater delicacy and nearer consequence if you do not grant it to me in\r\nungrudging measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TAMPICO INCIDENT\r\n\r\n[Address delivered at a joint session of the two Houses of Congress,\r\nApril 20, 1914.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nIt is my duty to call your attention to a situation which has arisen in\r\nour dealings with General Victoriano Huerta at Mexico City which calls\r\nfor action, and to ask your advice and cooeperation in acting upon it. On\r\nthe 9th of April a paymaster of the U.S.S. _Dolphin_ landed at the\r\nIturbide Bridge landing at Tampico with a whaleboat and boat's crew to\r\ntake off certain supplies needed by his ship, and while engaged in\r\nloading the boat was arrested by an officer and squad of men of the army\r\nof General Huerta. Neither the paymaster nor anyone of the boat's crew\r\nwas armed. Two of the men were in the boat when the arrest took place\r\nand were obliged to leave it and submit to be taken into custody,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that the boat carried, both at her bow and at\r\nher stern, the flag of the United States. The officer who made the\r\narrest was proceeding up one of the streets of the town with his\r\nprisoners when met by an officer of higher authority, who ordered him to\r\nreturn to the landing and await orders; and within an hour and a half\r\nfrom the time of the arrest orders were received from the commander of\r\nthe Huertista forces at Tampico for the release of the paymaster and his\r\nmen. The release was followed by apologies from the commander and later\r\nby an expression of regret by General Huerta himself. General Huerta\r\nurged that martial law obtained at the time at Tampico; that orders had\r\nbeen issued that no one should be allowed to land at the Iturbide\r\nBridge; and that our sailors had no right to land there. Our naval\r\ncommanders at the port had not been notified of any such prohibition;\r\nand, even if they had been, the only justifiable course open to the\r\nlocal authorities would have been to request the paymaster and his crew\r\nto withdraw and to lodge a protest with the commanding officer of the\r\nfleet. Admiral Mayo regarded the arrest as so serious an affront that he\r\nwas not satisfied with the apologies offered, but demanded that the flag\r\nof the United States be saluted with special ceremony by the military\r\ncommander of the port.\r\n\r\nThe incident cannot be regarded as a trivial one, especially as two of\r\nthe men arrested were taken from the boat itself--that is to say, from\r\nthe territory of the United States--but had it stood by itself it might\r\nhave been attributed to the ignorance or arrogance of a single officer.\r\nUnfortunately, it was not an isolated case. A series of incidents have\r\nrecently occurred which cannot but create the impression that the\r\nrepresentatives of General Huerta were willing to go out of their way to\r\nshow disregard for the dignity and rights of this Government and felt\r\nperfectly safe in doing what they pleased, making free to show in many\r\nways their irritation and contempt. A few days after the incident at\r\nTampico an orderly from the U.S.S. _Minnesota_ was arrested at Vera Cruz\r\nwhile ashore in uniform to obtain the ship's mail, and was for a time\r\nthrown into jail. An official dispatch from this Government to its\r\nembassy at Mexico City was withheld by the authorities of the\r\ntelegraphic service until peremptorily demanded by our charge d'affaires\r\nin person. So far as I can learn, such wrongs and annoyances have been\r\nsuffered to occur only against representatives of the United States. I\r\nhave heard of no complaints from other Governments of similar treatment.\r\nSubsequent explanations and formal apologies did not and could not\r\nalter the popular impression, which it is possible it had been the\r\nobject of the Huertista authorities to create, that the Government of\r\nthe United States was being singled out, and might be singled out with\r\nimpunity, for slights and affronts in retaliation for its refusal to\r\nrecognize the pretensions of General Huerta to be regarded as the\r\nconstitutional provisional President of the Republic of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe manifest danger of such a situation was that such offenses might\r\ngrow from bad to worse until something happened of so gross and\r\nintolerable a sort as to lead directly and inevitably to armed conflict.\r\nIt was necessary that the apologies of General Huerta and his\r\nrepresentatives should go much further, that they should be such as to\r\nattract the attention of the whole population to their significance, and\r\nsuch as to impress upon General Huerta himself the necessity of seeing\r\nto it that no further occasion for explanations and professed regrets\r\nshould arise. I, therefore, felt it my duty to sustain Admiral Mayo in\r\nthe whole of his demand and to insist that the flag of the United States\r\nshould be saluted in such a way as to indicate a new spirit and attitude\r\non the part of the Huertistas.\r\n\r\nSuch a salute General Huerta has refused, and I have come to ask your\r\napproval and support in the course I now purpose to pursue.\r\n\r\nThis Government can, I earnestly hope, in no circumstances be forced\r\ninto war with the people of Mexico. Mexico is torn by civil strife. If\r\nwe are to accept the tests of its own constitution, it has no\r\ngovernment. General Huerta has set his power up in the City of Mexico,\r\nsuch as it is, without right and by methods for which there can be no\r\njustification. Only part of the country is under his control. If armed\r\nconflict should unhappily come as a result of his attitude of personal\r\nresentment toward this Government, we should be fighting only General\r\nHuerta and those who adhere to him and give him their support, and our\r\nobject would be only to restore to the people of the distracted Republic\r\nthe opportunity to set up again their own laws and their own government.\r\n\r\nBut I earnestly hope that war is not now in question. I believe that I\r\nspeak for the American people when I say that we do not desire to\r\ncontrol in any degree the affairs of our sister Republic. Our feeling\r\nfor the people of Mexico is one of deep and genuine friendship, and\r\neverything that we have so far done or refrained from doing has\r\nproceeded from our desire to help them, not to hinder or embarrass them.\r\nWe would not wish even to exercise the good offices of friendship\r\nwithout their welcome and consent. The people of Mexico are entitled to\r\nsettle their own domestic affairs in their own way, and we sincerely\r\ndesire to respect their right. The present situation need have none of\r\nthe grave implications of interference if we deal with it promptly,\r\nfirmly, and wisely.\r\n\r\nNo doubt I could do what is necessary in the circumstances to enforce\r\nrespect for our Government without recourse to the Congress, and yet not\r\nexceed my constitutional powers as President; but I do not wish to act\r\nin a matter possibly of so grave consequence except in close conference\r\nand cooeperation with both the Senate and House. I, therefore, come to\r\nask your approval that I should use the armed forces of the United\r\nStates in such ways and to such an extent as may be necessary to obtain\r\nfrom General Huerta and his adherents the fullest recognition of the\r\nrights and dignity of the United States, even amidst the distressing\r\nconditions now unhappily obtaining in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThere can in what we do be no thought of aggression or of selfish\r\naggrandizement. We seek to maintain the dignity and authority of the\r\nUnited States only because we wish always to keep our great influence\r\nunimpaired for the uses of liberty, both in the United States and\r\nwherever else it may be employed for the benefit of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE FIRMAMENT OF MEMORY\r\n\r\n[Address at the Services in Memory of those who lost their lives at Vera\r\nCruz, Mexico, delivered at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, May 11, 1914. The\r\nroster, of fifteen sailors and four marines, was presented by the\r\nSecretary of the Navy, Mr. Daniels.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. SECRETARY:\r\n\r\nI know that the feelings which characterize all who stand about me and\r\nthe whole Nation at this hour are not feelings which can be suitably\r\nexpressed in terms of attempted oratory or eloquence. They are things\r\ntoo deep for ordinary speech. For my own part, I have a singular mixture\r\nof feelings. The feeling that is uppermost is one of profound grief that\r\nthese lads should have had to go to their death; and yet there is mixed\r\nwith that grief a profound pride that they should have gone as they did,\r\nand, if I may say it out of my heart, a touch of envy of those who were\r\npermitted so quietly, so nobly, to do their duty. Have you thought of\r\nit, men? Here is the roster of the Navy--the list of the men, officers\r\nand enlisted men and marines--and suddenly there swim nineteen stars out\r\nof the list--men who have suddenly been lifted into a firmament of\r\nmemory where we shall always see their names shine, not because they\r\ncalled upon us to admire them, but because they served us, without\r\nasking any questions and in the performance of a duty which is laid upon\r\nus as well as upon them.\r\n\r\nDuty is not an uncommon thing, gentlemen. Men are performing it in the\r\nordinary walks of life all around us all the time, and they are making\r\ngreat sacrifices to perform it. What gives men like these peculiar\r\ndistinction is not merely that they did their duty, but that their duty\r\nhad nothing to do with them or their own personal and peculiar\r\ninterests. They did not give their lives for themselves. They gave their\r\nlives for us, because we called upon them as a Nation to perform an\r\nunexpected duty. That is the way in which men grow distinguished, and\r\nthat is the only way, by serving somebody else than themselves. And what\r\ngreater thing could you serve than a Nation such as this we love and are\r\nproud of? Are you sorry for these lads? Are you sorry for the way they\r\nwill be remembered? Does it not quicken your pulses to think of the list\r\nof them? I hope to God none of you may join the list, but if you do you\r\nwill join an immortal company.\r\n\r\nSo, while we are profoundly sorrowful, and while there goes out of our\r\nhearts a very deep and affectionate sympathy for the friends and\r\nrelatives of these lads who for the rest of their lives shall mourn\r\nthem, though with a touch of pride, we know why we do not go away from\r\nthis occasion cast down, but with our heads lifted and our eyes on the\r\nfuture of this country, with absolute confidence of how it will be\r\nworked out. Not only upon the mere vague future of this country, but\r\nupon the immediate future. We have gone down to Mexico to serve mankind\r\nif we can find out the way. We do not want to fight the Mexicans. We\r\nwant to serve the Mexicans if we can, because we know how we would like\r\nto be free, and how we would like to be served if there were friends\r\nstanding by in such case ready to serve us. A war of aggression is not a\r\nwar in which it is a proud thing to die, but a war of service is a thing\r\nin which it is a proud thing to die.\r\n\r\nNotice how truly these men were of our blood. I mean of our American\r\nblood, which is not drawn from any one country, which is not drawn from\r\nany one stock, which is not drawn from any one language of the modern\r\nworld; but free men everywhere have sent their sons and their brothers\r\nand their daughters to this country in order to make that great\r\ncompounded Nation which consists of all the sturdy elements and of all\r\nthe best elements of the whole globe. I listened again to this list of\r\nthe dead with a profound interest because of the mixture of the names,\r\nfor the names bear the marks of the several national stocks from which\r\nthese men came. But they are not Irishmen or Germans or Frenchmen or\r\nHebrews or Italians any more. They were not when they went to Vera Cruz;\r\nthey were Americans, every one of them, and with no difference in their\r\nAmericanism because of the stock from which they came. They were in a\r\npeculiar sense of our blood, and they proved it by showing that they\r\nwere of our spirit--that no matter what their derivation, no matter\r\nwhere their people came from, they thought and wished and did the things\r\nthat were American; and the flag under which they served was a flag in\r\nwhich all the blood of mankind is united to make a free Nation.\r\n\r\nWar, gentlemen, is only a sort of dramatic representation, a sort of\r\ndramatic symbol, of a thousand forms of duty. I never went into battle;\r\nI never was under fire; but I fancy that there are some things just as\r\nhard to do as to go under fire. I fancy that it is just as hard to do\r\nyour duty when men are sneering at you as when they are shooting at you.\r\nWhen they shoot at you, they can only take your natural life; when they\r\nsneer at you, they can wound your living heart, and men who are brave\r\nenough, steadfast enough, steady in their principles enough, to go about\r\ntheir duty with regard to their fellow-men, no matter whether there are\r\nhisses or cheers, men who can do what Rudyard Kipling in one of his\r\npoems wrote, \"Meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two\r\nimpostors just the same,\" are men for a nation to be proud of. Morally\r\nspeaking, disaster and triumph are impostors. The cheers of the moment\r\nare not what a man ought to think about, but the verdict of his\r\nconscience and of the consciences of mankind.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at you, I feel as if I also and we all were enlisted men.\r\nNot enlisted in your particular branch of the service, but enlisted to\r\nserve the country, no matter what may come, even though we may sacrifice\r\nour lives in the arduous endeavor. We are expected to put the utmost\r\nenergy of every power that we have into the service of our fellow-men,\r\nnever sparing ourselves, not condescending to think of what is going to\r\nhappen to ourselves, but ready, if need be, to go to the utter length of\r\ncomplete self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAs I stand and look at you to-day and think of these spirits that have\r\ngone from us, I know that the road is clearer for the future. These boys\r\nhave shown us the way, and it is easier to walk on it because they have\r\ngone before and shown us how. May God grant to all of us that vision of\r\npatriotic service which here in solemnity and grief and pride is borne\r\nin upon our hearts and consciences!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORIAL DAY ADDRESS\r\n\r\n[Delivered at the National Cemetery, Arlington, Va., May 30, 1914.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nI have not come here to-day with a prepared address. The committee in\r\ncharge of the exercises of the day have graciously excused me on the\r\ngrounds of public obligations from preparing such an address, but I will\r\nnot deny myself the privilege of joining with you in an expression of\r\ngratitude and admiration for the men who perished for the sake of the\r\nUnion. They do not need our praise. They do not need that our admiration\r\nshould sustain them. There is no immortality that is safer than theirs.\r\nWe come not for their sakes but for our own, in order that we may drink\r\nat the same springs of inspiration from which they themselves selves\r\ndrank.\r\n\r\nA peculiar privilege came to the men who fought for the Union. There is\r\nno other civil war in history, ladies and gentlemen, the stings of which\r\nwere removed before the men who did the fighting passed from the stage\r\nof life. So that we owe these men something more than a legal\r\nreestablishment of the Union. We owe them the spiritual reestablishment\r\nof the Union as well; for they not only reunited States, they reunited\r\nthe spirits of men. That is their unique achievement, unexampled\r\nanywhere else in the annals of mankind, that the very men whom they\r\novercame in battle join in praise and gratitude that the Union was\r\nsaved. There is something peculiarly beautiful and peculiarly touching\r\nabout that. Whenever a man who is still trying to devote himself to the\r\nservice of the Nation comes into a presence like this, or into a place\r\nlike this, his spirit must be peculiarly moved. A mandate is laid upon\r\nhim which seems to speak from the very graves themselves. Those who\r\nserve this Nation, whether in peace or in war, should serve it without\r\nthought of themselves. I can never speak in praise of war, ladies and\r\ngentlemen; you would not desire me to do so. But there is this peculiar\r\ndistinction belonging to the soldier, that he goes into an enterprise\r\nout of which he himself cannot get anything at all. He is giving\r\neverything that he hath, even his life, in order that others may live,\r\nnot in order that he himself may obtain gain and prosperity. And just so\r\nsoon as the tasks of peace are performed in the same spirit of\r\nself-sacrifice and devotion, peace societies will not be necessary. The\r\nvery organization and spirit of society will be a guaranty of peace.\r\n\r\nTherefore this peculiar thing comes about, that we can stand here and\r\npraise the memory of these soldiers in the interest of peace. They set\r\nus the example of self-sacrifice, which if followed in peace will make\r\nit unnecessary that men should follow war any more.\r\n\r\nWe are reputed to be somewhat careless in our discrimination between\r\nwords in the use of the English language, and yet it is interesting to\r\nnote that there are some words about which we are very careful. We\r\nbestow the adjective \"great\" somewhat indiscriminately. A man who has\r\nmade conquest of his fellow-men for his own gain may display such genius\r\nin war, such uncommon qualities of organization and leadership that we\r\nmay call him \"great,\" but there is a word which we reserve for men of\r\nanother kind and about which we are very careful; that is the word\r\n\"noble.\" We never call a man \"noble\" who serves only himself; and if you\r\nwill look about through all the nations of the world upon the statues\r\nthat men have erected--upon the inscribed tablets where they have\r\nwished to keep alive the memory of the citizens whom they desire most to\r\nhonor--you will find that almost without exception they have erected the\r\nstatue to those who had a splendid surplus of energy and devotion to\r\nspend upon their fellow-men. Nobility exists in America without patent.\r\nWe have no House of Lords, but we have a house of fame to which we\r\nelevate those who are the noble men of our race, who, forgetful of\r\nthemselves, study and serve the public interest, who have the courage to\r\nface any number and any kind of adversary, to speak what in their hearts\r\nthey believe to be the truth.\r\n\r\nWe admire physical courage, but we admire above all things else moral\r\ncourage. I believe that soldiers will bear me out in saying that both\r\ncome in time of battle. I take it that the moral courage comes in going\r\ninto the battle, and the physical courage in staying in. There are\r\nbattles which are just as hard to go into and just as hard to stay in as\r\nthe battles of arms, and if the man will but stay and think never of\r\nhimself there will come a time of grateful recollection when men will\r\nspeak of him not only with admiration but with that which goes deeper,\r\nwith affection and with reverence.\r\n\r\nSo that this flag calls upon us daily for service, and the more quiet\r\nand self-denying the service the greater the glory of the flag. We are\r\ndedicated to freedom, and that freedom means the freedom of the human\r\nspirit. All free spirits ought to congregate on an occasion like this to\r\ndo homage to the greatness of America as illustrated by the greatness of\r\nher sons.\r\n\r\nIt has been a privilege, ladies and gentlemen, to come and say these\r\nsimple words, which I am sure are merely putting your thought into\r\nlanguage. I thank you for the opportunity to lay this little wreath of\r\nmine upon these consecrated graves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOSING A CHAPTER\r\n\r\n[Address in which President Wilson accepted the Monument in Memory of\r\nthe Confederate Dead, at Arlington National Cemetery, June 4, 1914.].\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CHAIRMAN, MRS. MCLAURIN STEVENS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nI assure you that I am profoundly aware of the solemn significance of\r\nthe thing that has now taken place. The Daughters of the Confederacy\r\nhave presented a memorial of their dead to the Government of the United\r\nStates. I hope that you have noted the history of the conception of this\r\nidea. It was suggested by a President of the United States who had\r\nhimself been a distinguished officer in the Union Army. It was\r\nauthorized by an act of Congress of the United States. The corner-stone\r\nof the monument was laid by a President of the United States elevated to\r\nhis position by the votes of the party which had chiefly prided itself\r\nupon sustaining the war for the Union, and who, while Secretary of War,\r\nhad himself given authority to erect it. And, now, it has fallen to my\r\nlot to accept in the name of the great Government, which I am privileged\r\nfor the time to represent, this emblem of a reunited people. I am not so\r\nmuch happy as proud to participate in this capacity on such an\r\noccasion,--proud that I should represent such a people. Am I mistaken,\r\nladies and gentlemen, in supposing that nothing of this sort could have\r\noccurred in anything but a democracy? The people of a democracy are not\r\nrelated to their rulers as subjects are related to a government. They\r\nare themselves the sovereign authority, and as they are neighbors of\r\neach other, quickened by the same influences and moved by the same\r\nmotives, they can understand each other. They are shot through with some\r\nof the deepest and profoundest instincts of human sympathy. They choose\r\ntheir governments; they select their rulers; they live their own life,\r\nand they will not have that life disturbed and discolored by fraternal\r\nmisunderstandings. I know that a reuniting of spirits like this can take\r\nplace more quickly in our time than in any other because men are now\r\nunited by an easier transmission of those influences which make up the\r\nfoundations of peace and of mutual understanding, but no process can\r\nwork these effects unless there is a conducting medium. The conducting\r\nmedium in this instance is the united heart of a great people. I am not\r\ngoing to detain you by trying to repeat any of the eloquent thoughts\r\nwhich have moved us this afternoon, for I rejoice in the simplicity of\r\nthe task which is assigned to me. My privilege is this, ladies and\r\ngentlemen: To declare this chapter in the history of the United States\r\nclosed and ended, and I bid you turn with me with your faces to the\r\nfuture, quickened by the memories of the past, but with nothing to do\r\nwith the contests of the past, knowing, as we have shed our blood upon\r\nopposite sides, we now face and admire one another. I do not know how\r\nmany years ago it was that the _Century Dictionary_ was published, but I\r\nremember one day in the _Century Cyclopedia of Names_ I had occasion to\r\nturn to the name of Robert E. Lee, and I found him there in that book\r\npublished in New York City simply described as a great American general.\r\nThe generosity of our judgments did not begin to-day. The generosity of\r\nour judgment was made up soon after this great struggle was over. Men\r\ncame and sat together again in the Congress and united in all the\r\nefforts of peace and of government, and our solemn duty is to see that\r\neach one of us is in his own consciousness and in his own conduct a\r\nreplica of this great reunited people. It is our duty and our privilege\r\nto be like the country we represent and, speaking no word of malice, no\r\nword of criticism even, stand shoulder to shoulder to lift the burdens\r\nof mankind in the future and show the paths of freedom to all the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNAPOLIS COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS\r\n\r\n[Delivered before the Graduating Class of the United States Naval\r\nAcademy, Annapolis, Maryland, June 5, 1914.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. SUPERINTENDENT, YOUNG GENTLEMEN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of my life I have been associated with young\r\nmen, and on occasions it seems to me without number have faced bodies of\r\nyoungsters going out to take part in the activities of the world, but I\r\nhave a consciousness of a different significance in this occasion from\r\nthat which I have felt on other similar occasions. When I have faced the\r\ngraduating classes at universities I have felt that I was facing a great\r\nconjecture. They were going out into all sorts of pursuits and with\r\nevery degree of preparation for the particular thing they were expecting\r\nto do; some without any preparation at all, for they did not know what\r\nthey expected to do. But in facing you I am facing men who are trained\r\nfor a special thing. You know what you are going to do, and you are\r\nunder the eye of the whole Nation in doing it. For you, gentlemen, are\r\nto be part of the power of the Government of the United States. There is\r\na very deep and solemn significance in that fact, and I am sure that\r\nevery one of you feels it. The moral is perfectly obvious. Be ready and\r\nfit for anything that you have to do. And keep ready and fit. Do not\r\ngrow slack. Do not suppose that your education is over because you have\r\nreceived your diplomas from the academy. Your education has just begun.\r\nMoreover, you are to have a very peculiar privilege which not many of\r\nyour predecessors have had. You are yourselves going to become\r\nteachers. You are going to teach those 50,000 fellow-countrymen of yours\r\nwho are the enlisted men of the Navy. You are going to make them fitter\r\nto obey your orders and to serve the country. You are going to make them\r\nfitter to see what the orders mean in their outlook upon life and upon\r\nthe service; and that is a great privilege, for out of you is going the\r\nenergy and intelligence which are going to quicken the whole body of the\r\nUnited States Navy.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you upon that prospect, but I want to ask you not to get\r\nthe professional point of view. I would ask it of you if you were\r\nlawyers; I would ask it of you if you were merchants; I would ask it of\r\nyou whatever you expected to be. Do not get the professional point of\r\nview. There is nothing narrower or more unserviceable than the\r\nprofessional point of view, to have the attitude toward life that it\r\ncenters in your profession. It does not. Your profession is only one of\r\nthe many activities which are meant to keep the world straight, and to\r\nkeep the energy in its blood and in its muscle. We are all of us in this\r\nworld, as I understand it, to set forward the affairs of the whole\r\nworld, though we play a special part in that great function. The Navy\r\ngoes all over the world, and I think it is to be congratulated upon\r\nhaving that sort of illustration of what the world is and what it\r\ncontains; and inasmuch as you are going all over the world you ought to\r\nbe the better able to see the relation that your country bears to the\r\nrest of the world.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be one of your thoughts all the time that you are sample\r\nAmericans--not merely sample Navy men, not merely sample soldiers, but\r\nsample Americans--and that you have the point of view of America with\r\nregard to her Navy and her Army; that she is using them as the\r\ninstruments of civilization, not as the instruments of aggression. The\r\nidea of America is to serve humanity, and every time you let the Stars\r\nand Stripes free to the wind you ought to realize that that is in itself\r\na message that you are on an errand which other navies have sometimes\r\ntunes forgotten; not an errand of conquest, but an errand of service. I\r\nalways have the same thought when I look at the flag of the United\r\nStates, for I know something of the history of the struggle of mankind\r\nfor liberty. When I look at that flag it seems to me as if the white\r\nstripes were strips of parchment upon which are written the rights of\r\nman, and the red stripes the streams of blood by which those rights have\r\nbeen made good. Then in the little blue firmament in the corner have\r\nswung out the stars of the States of the American Union. So it is, as it\r\nwere, a sort of floating charter that has come down to us from\r\nRunnymede, when men said, \"We will not have masters; we will be a\r\npeople, and we will seek our own liberty.\"\r\n\r\nYou are not serving a government, gentlemen; you are serving a people.\r\nFor we who for the time being constitute the Government are merely\r\ninstruments for a little while in the hands of a great Nation which\r\nchooses whom it will to carry out its decrees and who invariably rejects\r\nthe man who forgets the ideals which it intended him to serve. So that I\r\nhope that wherever you go you will have a generous, comprehending love\r\nof the people you come into contact with, and will come back and tell\r\nus, if you can, what service the United States can render to the\r\nremotest parts of the world; tell us where you see men suffering; tell\r\nus where you think advice will lift them up; tell us where you think\r\nthat the counsel of statesmen may better the fortunes of unfortunate\r\nmen; always having it in mind that you are champions of what is right\r\nand fair all 'round for the public welfare, no matter where you are, and\r\nthat it is that you are ready to fight for and not merely on the drop\r\nof a hat or upon some slight punctilio, but that you are champions of\r\nyour fellow-men, particularly of that great body one hundred million\r\nstrong whom you represent in the United States.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think is the most lasting impression that those boys down at\r\nVera Cruz are going to leave? They have had to use some force--I pray\r\nGod it may not be necessary for them to use any more--but do you think\r\nthat the way they fought is going to be the most lasting impression?\r\nHave men not fought ever since the world began? Is there anything new in\r\nusing force? The new things in the world are the things that are\r\ndivorced from force. The things that show the moral compulsions of the\r\nhuman conscience, those are the things by which we have been building up\r\ncivilization, not by force. And the lasting impression that those boys\r\nare going to leave is this, that they exercise self-control; that they\r\nare ready and diligent to make the place where they went fitter to live\r\nin than they found it; that they regarded other people's rights; that\r\nthey did not strut and bluster, but went quietly, like self-respecting\r\ngentlemen, about their legitimate work. And the people of Vera Cruz, who\r\nfeared the Americans and despised the Americans, are going to get a very\r\ndifferent taste in their mouths about the whole thing when the boys of\r\nthe Navy and the Army come away. Is that not something to be proud of,\r\nthat you know how to use force like men of conscience and like\r\ngentlemen, serving your fellow-men and not trying to overcome them? Like\r\nthat gallant gentleman who has so long borne the heats and perplexities\r\nand distresses of the situation in Vera Cruz--Admiral Fletcher. I\r\nmention him, because his service there has been longer and so much of\r\nthe early perplexities fell upon him. I have been in almost daily\r\ncommunication with Admiral Fletcher, and I have tested his temper. I\r\nhave tested his discretion. I know that he is a man with a touch of\r\nstatesmanship about him, and he has grown bigger in my eye each day as I\r\nhave read his dispatches, for he has sought always to serve the thing he\r\nwas trying to do in the temper that we all recognize and love to believe\r\nis typically American.\r\n\r\nI challenge you youngsters to go out with these conceptions, knowing\r\nthat you are part of the Government and force of the United States and\r\nthat men will judge us by you. I am not afraid of the verdict. I cannot\r\nlook in your faces and doubt what it will be, but I want you to take\r\nthese great engines of force out onto the seas like adventurers enlisted\r\nfor the elevation of the spirit of the human race. For that is the only\r\ndistinction that America has. Other nations have been strong, other\r\nnations have piled wealth as high as the sky, but they have come into\r\ndisgrace because they used their force and their wealth for the\r\noppression of mankind and their own aggrandizement; and America will not\r\nbring glory to herself, but disgrace, by following the beaten paths of\r\nhistory. We must strike out upon new paths, and we must count upon you\r\ngentlemen to be the explorers who will carry this spirit and spread this\r\nmessage all over the seas and in every port of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nYou see, therefore, why I said that when I faced you I felt there was a\r\nspecial significance. I am not present on an occasion when you are about\r\nto scatter on various errands. You are all going on the same errand, and\r\nI like to feel bound with you in one common organization for the glory\r\nof America. And her glory goes deeper than all the tinsel, goes deeper\r\nthan the sound of guns and the clash of sabers; it goes down to the very\r\nfoundations of those things that have made the spirit of men free and\r\nhappy and content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEANING OF LIBERTY\r\n\r\n[Address at Independence Hall, Philadelphia, July 4, 1914.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CHAIRMAN AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:\r\n\r\nWe are assembled to celebrate the one hundred and thirty-eighth\r\nanniversary of the birth of the United States. I suppose that we can\r\nmore vividly realize the circumstances of that birth standing on this\r\nhistoric spot than it would be possible to realize them anywhere else.\r\nThe Declaration of Independence was written in Philadelphia; it was\r\nadopted in this historic building by which we stand. I have just had the\r\nprivilege of sitting in the chair of the great man who presided over the\r\ndeliberations of those who gave the declaration to the world. My hand\r\nrests at this moment upon the table upon which the declaration was\r\nsigned. We can feel that we are almost in the visible and tangible\r\npresence of a great historic transaction.\r\n\r\nHave you ever read the Declaration of Independence or attended with\r\nclose comprehension to the real character of it when you have heard it\r\nread? If you have, you will know that it is not a Fourth of July\r\noration. The Declaration of Independence was a document preliminary to\r\nwar. It was a vital piece of practical business, not a piece of\r\nrhetoric; and if you will pass beyond those preliminary passages which\r\nwe are accustomed to quote about the rights of men and read into the\r\nheart of the document you will see that it is very express and detailed,\r\nthat it consists of a series of definite specifications concerning\r\nactual public business of the day. Not the business of our day, for the\r\nmatter with which it deals is past, but the business of that first\r\nrevolution by which the Nation was set up, the business of 1776. Its\r\ngeneral statements, its general declarations cannot mean anything to us\r\nunless we append to it a similar specific body of particulars as to what\r\nwe consider the essential business of our own day.\r\n\r\nLiberty does not consist, my fellow-citizens, in mere general\r\ndeclarations of the rights of man. It consists in the translation of\r\nthose declarations into definite action. Therefore, standing here where\r\nthe declaration was adopted, reading its businesslike sentences, we\r\nought to ask ourselves what there is in it for us. There is nothing in\r\nit for us unless we can translate it into the terms of our own\r\nconditions and of our own lives. We must reduce it to what the lawyers\r\ncall a bill of particulars. It contains a bill of particulars, but the\r\nbill of particulars of 1776. If we would keep it alive, we must fill it\r\nwith a bill of particulars of the year 1914.\r\n\r\nThe task to which we have constantly to readdress ourselves is the task\r\nof proving that we are worthy of the men who drew this great declaration\r\nand know what they would have done in our circumstances. Patriotism\r\nconsists in some very practical things--practical in that they belong to\r\nthe life of every day, that they wear no extraordinary distinction about\r\nthem, that they are connected with commonplace duty. The way to be\r\npatriotic in America is not only to love America but to love the duty\r\nthat lies nearest to our hand and know that in performing it we are\r\nserving our country. There are some gentlemen in Washington, for\r\nexample, at this very moment who are showing themselves very patriotic\r\nin a way which does not attract wide attention but seems to belong to\r\nmere everyday obligations. The Members of the House and Senate who stay\r\nin hot Washington to maintain a quorum of the Houses and transact the\r\nall-important business of the Nation are doing an act of patriotism. I\r\nhonor them for it, and I am glad to stay there and stick by them until\r\nthe work is done.\r\n\r\nIt is patriotic, also, to learn what the facts of our national life are\r\nand to face them with candor. I have heard a great many facts stated\r\nabout the present business condition of this country, for example--a\r\ngreat many allegations of fact, at any rate, but the allegations do not\r\ntally with one another. And yet I know that truth always matches with\r\ntruth and when I find some insisting that everything is going wrong and\r\nothers insisting that everything is going right, and when I know from a\r\nwide observation of the general circumstances of the country taken as a\r\nwhole that things are going extremely well, I wonder what those who are\r\ncrying out that things are wrong are trying to do. Are they trying to\r\nserve the country, or are they trying to serve something smaller than\r\nthe country? Are they trying to put hope into the hearts of the men who\r\nwork and toil every day, or are they trying to plant discouragement and\r\ndespair in those hearts? And why do they cry that everything is wrong\r\nand yet do nothing to set it right? If they love America and anything is\r\nwrong amongst us, it is their business to put their hand with ours to\r\nthe task of setting it right. When the facts are known and acknowledged,\r\nthe duty of all patriotic men is to accept them in candor and to address\r\nthemselves hopefully and confidently to the common counsel which is\r\nnecessary to act upon them wisely and in universal concert.\r\n\r\nI have had some experiences in the last fourteen months which have not\r\nbeen entirely reassuring. It was universally admitted, for example, my\r\nfellow-citizens, that the banking system of this country needed\r\nreorganization. We set the best minds that we could find to the task of\r\ndiscovering the best method of reorganization. But we met with hardly\r\nanything but criticism from the bankers of the country; we met with\r\nhardly anything but resistance from the majority of those at least who\r\nspoke at all concerning the matter. And yet so soon as that act was\r\npassed there was a universal chorus of applause, and the very men who\r\nhad opposed the measure joined in that applause. If it was wrong the day\r\nbefore it was passed, why was it right the day after it was passed?\r\nWhere had been the candor of criticism not only, but the concert of\r\ncounsel which makes legislative action vigorous and safe and successful?\r\n\r\nIt is not patriotic to concert measures against one another; it is\r\npatriotic to concert measures for one another.\r\n\r\nIn one sense the Declaration of Independence has lost its significance.\r\nIt has lost its significance as a declaration of national independence.\r\nNobody outside of America believed when it was uttered that we could\r\nmake good our independence; now nobody anywhere would dare to doubt that\r\nwe are independent and can maintain our independence. As a declaration\r\nof independence, therefore, it is a mere historic document. Our\r\nindependence is a fact so stupendous that it can be measured only by the\r\nsize and energy and variety and wealth and power of one of the greatest\r\nnations in the world. But it is one thing to be independent and it is\r\nanother thing to know what to do with your independence. It is one thing\r\nto come to your majority and another thing to know what you are going to\r\ndo with your life and your energies; and one of the most serious\r\nquestions for sober-minded men to address themselves to in the United\r\nStates is this: What are we going to do with the influence and power of\r\nthis great Nation? Are we going to play the old role of using that power\r\nfor our aggrandizement and material benefit only? You know what that may\r\nmean. It may upon occasion mean that we shall use it to make the\r\npeoples of other nations suffer in the way in which we said it was\r\nintolerable to suffer when we uttered our Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nThe Department of State at Washington is constantly called upon to back\r\nup the commercial enterprises and the industrial enterprises of the\r\nUnited States in foreign countries, and it at one time went so far in\r\nthat direction that all its diplomacy came to be designated as \"dollar\r\ndiplomacy.\" It was called upon to support every man who wanted to earn\r\nanything anywhere if he was an American. But there ought to be a limit\r\nto that. There is no man who is more interested than I am in carrying\r\nthe enterprise of American business men to every quarter of the globe. I\r\nwas interested in it long before I was suspected of being a politician.\r\nI have been preaching it year after year as the great thing that lay in\r\nthe future for the United States, to show her wit and skill and\r\nenterprise and influence in every country in the world. But observe the\r\nlimit to all that which is laid upon us perhaps more than upon any other\r\nnation in the world. We set this Nation up, at any rate we professed to\r\nset it up, to vindicate the rights of men. We did not name any\r\ndifferences between one race and another. We did not set up any barriers\r\nagainst any particular people. We opened our gates to all the world and\r\nsaid, \"Let all men who wish to be free come to us and they will be\r\nwelcome.\" We said, \"This independence of ours is not a selfish thing for\r\nour own exclusive private use. It is for everybody to whom we can find\r\nthe means of extending it.\" We cannot with that oath taken in our youth,\r\nwe cannot with that great ideal set before us when we were a young\r\npeople and numbered only a scant 3,000,000, take upon ourselves, now\r\nthat we are 100,000,000 strong, any other conception of duty than we\r\nthen entertained. If American enterprise in foreign countries,\r\nparticularly in those foreign countries which are not strong enough to\r\nresist us, takes the shape of imposing upon and exploiting the mass of\r\nthe people of that country it ought to be checked and not encouraged. I\r\nam willing to get anything for an American that money and enterprise can\r\nobtain except the suppression of the rights of other men. I will not\r\nhelp any man buy a power which he ought not to exercise over his\r\nfellow-beings.\r\n\r\nYou know, my fellow-countrymen, what a big question there is in Mexico.\r\nEighty-five per cent of the Mexican people have never been allowed to\r\nhave any genuine participation in their own Government or to exercise\r\nany substantial rights with regard to the very land they live upon. All\r\nthe rights that men most desire have been exercised by the other fifteen\r\nper cent. Do you suppose that that circumstance is not sometimes in my\r\nthought? I know that the American people have a heart that will beat\r\njust as strong for those millions in Mexico as it will beat, or has\r\nbeaten, for any other millions elsewhere in the world, and that when\r\nonce they conceive what is at stake in Mexico they will know what ought\r\nto be done in Mexico. I hear a great deal said about the loss of\r\nproperty in Mexico and the loss of the lives of foreigners, and I\r\ndeplore these things with all my heart. Undoubtedly, upon the conclusion\r\nof the present disturbed conditions in Mexico those who have been\r\nunjustly deprived of their property or in any wise unjustly put upon\r\nought to be compensated. Men's individual rights have no doubt been\r\ninvaded, and the invasion of those rights has been attended by many\r\ndeplorable circumstances which ought sometime, in the proper way, to be\r\naccounted for. But back of it all is the struggle of a people to come\r\ninto its own, and while we look upon the incidents in the foreground\r\nlet us not forget the great tragic reality in the background which\r\ntowers above the whole picture.\r\n\r\nA patriotic American is a man who is not niggardly and selfish in the\r\nthings that he enjoys that make for human liberty and the rights of man.\r\nHe wants to share them with the whole world, and he is never so proud of\r\nthe great flag under which he lives as when it comes to mean to other\r\npeople as well as to himself a symbol of hope and liberty. I would be\r\nashamed of this flag if it ever did anything outside America that we\r\nwould not permit it to do inside of America.\r\n\r\nThe world is becoming more complicated every day, my fellow-citizens. No\r\nman ought to be foolish enough to think that he understands it all. And,\r\ntherefore, I am glad that there are some simple things in the world. One\r\nof the simple things is principle. Honesty is a perfectly simple thing.\r\nIt is hard for me to believe that in most circumstances when a man has a\r\nchoice of ways he does not know which is the right way and which is the\r\nwrong way. No man who has chosen the wrong way ought even to come into\r\nIndependence Square; it is holy ground which he ought not to tread upon.\r\nHe ought not to come where immortal voices have uttered the great\r\nsentences of such a document as this Declaration of Independence upon\r\nwhich rests the liberty of a whole nation.\r\n\r\nAnd so I say that it is patriotic sometimes to prefer the honor of the\r\ncountry to its material interest. Would you rather be deemed by all the\r\nnations of the world incapable of keeping your treaty obligations in\r\norder that you might have free tolls for American ships? The treaty\r\nunder which we gave up that right may have been a mistaken treaty, but\r\nthere was no mistake about its meaning.\r\n\r\nWhen I have made a promise as a man I try to keep it, and I know of no\r\nother rule permissible to a nation. The most distinguished nation in\r\nthe world is the nation that can and will keep its promises even to its\r\nown hurt. And I want to say parenthetically that I do not think anybody\r\nwas hurt. I cannot be enthusiastic for subsidies to a monopoly, but let\r\nthose who are enthusiastic for subsidies ask themselves whether they\r\nprefer subsidies to unsullied honor.\r\n\r\nThe most patriotic man, ladies and gentlemen, is sometimes the man who\r\ngoes in the direction that he thinks right even when he sees half the\r\nworld against him. It is the dictate of patriotism to sacrifice yourself\r\nif you think that that is the path of honor and of duty. Do not blame\r\nothers if they do not agree with you. Do not die with bitterness in your\r\nheart because you did not convince the rest of the world, but die happy\r\nbecause you believe that you tried to serve your country by not selling\r\nyour soul. Those were grim days, the days of 1776. Those gentlemen did\r\nnot attach their names to the Declaration of Independence on this table\r\nexpecting a holiday on the next day, and that 4th of July was not itself\r\na holiday. They attached their signatures to that significant document\r\nknowing that if they failed it was certain that every one of them would\r\nhang for the failure. They were committing treason in the interest of\r\nthe liberty of 3,000,000 people in America. All the rest of the world\r\nwas against them and smiled with cynical incredulity at the audacious\r\nundertaking. Do you think that if they could see this great Nation now\r\nthey would regret anything that they then did to draw the gaze of a\r\nhostile world upon them? Every idea must be started by somebody, and it\r\nis a lonely thing to start anything. Yet if it is in you, you must start\r\nit if you have a man's blood in you and if you love the country that you\r\nprofess to be working for.\r\n\r\nI am sometimes very much interested when I see gentlemen supposing that\r\npopularity is the way to success in America. The way to success in this\r\ngreat country, with its fair judgments, is to show that you are not\r\nafraid of anybody except God and his final verdict. If I did not believe\r\nthat, I would not believe in democracy. If I did not believe that, I\r\nwould not believe that people can govern themselves. If I did not\r\nbelieve that the moral judgment would be the last judgment, the final\r\njudgment, in the minds of men as well as the tribunal of God, I could\r\nnot believe in popular government. But I do believe these things, and,\r\ntherefore, I earnestly believe in the democracy not only of America but\r\nof every awakened people that wishes and intends to govern and control\r\nits own affairs.\r\n\r\nIt is very inspiring, my friends, to come to this that may be called the\r\noriginal fountain of independence and liberty in American and here drink\r\ndraughts of patriotic feeling which seem to renew the very blood in\r\none's veins. Down in Washington sometimes when the days are hot and the\r\nbusiness presses intolerably and there are so many things to do that it\r\ndoes not seem possible to do anything in the way it ought to be done, it\r\nis always possible to lift one's thought above the task of the moment\r\nand, as it were, to realize that great thing of which we are all parts,\r\nthe great body of American feeling and American principle. No man could\r\ndo the work that has to be done in Washington if he allowed himself to\r\nbe separated from that body of principle. He must make himself feel that\r\nhe is a part of the people of the United States, that he is trying to\r\nthink not only for them, but with them, and then he cannot feel lonely.\r\nHe not only cannot feel lonely but he cannot feel afraid of anything.\r\n\r\nMy dream is that as the years go on and the world knows more and more of\r\nAmerica it will also drink at these fountains of youth and renewal; that\r\nit also will turn to America for those moral inspirations which lie at\r\nthe basis of all freedom; that the world will never fear America unless\r\nit feels that it is engaged in some enterprise which is inconsistent\r\nwith the rights of humanity; and that America will come into the full\r\nlight of the day when all shall know that she puts human rights above\r\nall other rights and that her flag is the flag not only of America but\r\nof humanity.\r\n\r\nWhat other great people has devoted itself to this exalted ideal? To\r\nwhat other nation in the world can all eyes look for an instant sympathy\r\nthat thrills the whole body politic when men anywhere are fighting for\r\ntheir rights? I do not know that there will ever be a declaration of\r\nindependence and of grievances for mankind, but I believe that if any\r\nsuch document is ever drawn it will be drawn in the spirit of the\r\nAmerican Declaration of Independence, and that America has lifted high\r\nthe light which will shine unto all generations and guide the feet of\r\nmankind to the goal of justice and liberty and peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN NEUTRALITY\r\n\r\n[An appeal to the citizens of the Republic, requesting their assistance\r\nin maintaining a state of neutrality during the European War, August 20,\r\n1914.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN:\r\n\r\nI suppose that every thoughtful man in America has asked himself, during\r\nthese last troubled weeks, what influence the European war may exert\r\nupon the United States, and I take the liberty of addressing a few words\r\nto you in order to point out that it is entirely within our own choice\r\nwhat its effects upon us will be and to urge very earnestly upon you the\r\nsort of speech and conduct which will best safeguard the Nation against\r\ndistress and disaster.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the war upon the United States will depend upon what\r\nAmerican citizens say and do. Every man who really loves America will\r\nact and speak in the true spirit of neutrality, which is the spirit of\r\nimpartiality and fairness and friendliness to all concerned. The spirit\r\nof the Nation in this critical matter will be determined largely by what\r\nindividuals and society and those gathered in public meetings do and\r\nsay, upon what newspapers and magazines contain, upon what ministers\r\nutter in their pulpits, and men proclaim as their opinions on the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States are drawn from many nations, and chiefly\r\nfrom the nations now at war. It is natural and inevitable that there\r\nshould be the utmost variety of sympathy and desire among them with\r\nregard to the issues and circumstances of the conflict. Some will wish\r\none nation, others another, to succeed in the momentous struggle. It\r\nwill be easy to excite passion and difficult to allay it. Those\r\nresponsible for exciting it will assume a heavy responsibility,\r\nresponsibility for no less a thing than that the people of the United\r\nStates, whose love of their country and whose loyalty to its Government\r\nshould unite them as Americans all, bound in honor and affection to\r\nthink first of her and her interests, may be divided in camps of hostile\r\nopinion, hot against each other, involved in the war itself in impulse\r\nand opinion if not in action.\r\n\r\nSuch divisions among us would be fatal to our peace of mind and might\r\nseriously stand in the way of the proper performance of our duty as the\r\none great nation at peace, the one people holding itself ready to play a\r\npart of impartial mediation and speak the counsels of peace and\r\naccommodation, not as a partisan, but as a friend.\r\n\r\nI venture, therefore, my fellow countrymen, to speak a solemn word of\r\nwarning to you against that deepest, most subtle, most essential breach\r\nof neutrality which may spring out of partisanship, out of passionately\r\ntaking sides. The United States must be neutral in fact as well as in\r\nname during these days that are to try men's souls. We must be impartial\r\nin thought as well as in action, must put a curb upon our sentiments as\r\nwell as upon every transaction that might be construed as a preference\r\nof one party to the struggle before another.\r\n\r\nMy thought is of America. I am speaking, I feel sure, the earnest wish\r\nand purpose of every thoughtful American that this great country of\r\nours, which is, of course, the first in our thoughts and in our hearts,\r\nshould show herself in this time of peculiar trial a Nation fit beyond\r\nothers to exhibit the fine poise of undisturbed judgment, the dignity of\r\nself-control, the efficiency of dispassionate action; a Nation that\r\nneither sits in judgment upon others nor is disturbed in her own\r\ncounsels and which keeps herself fit and free to do what is honest and\r\ndisinterested and truly serviceable for the peace of the world.\r\n\r\nShall we not resolve to put upon ourselves the restraints which will\r\nbring to our people the happiness and the great and lasting influence\r\nfor peace we covet for them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPEAL FOR ADDITIONAL REVENUE\r\n\r\n[Address delivered at a joint session of the two Houses of Congress,\r\nSeptember 4, 1914.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nI come to you to-day to discharge a duty which I wish with all my heart\r\nI might have been spared; but it is a very clear duty, and therefore I\r\nperform it without hesitation or apology. I come to ask very earnestly\r\nthat additional revenue be provided for the Government.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of August there was, as compared with the corresponding\r\nmonth of last year, a falling off of $10,629,538 in the revenues\r\ncollected from customs. A continuation of this decrease in the same\r\nproportion throughout the current fiscal year would probably mean a loss\r\nof customs revenues of from sixty to one hundred millions. I need not\r\ntell you to what this falling off is due. It is due, in chief part, not\r\nto the reductions recently made in the customs duties, but to the great\r\ndecrease in importations; and that is due to the extraordinary extent of\r\nthe industrial area affected by the present war in Europe. Conditions\r\nhave arisen which no man foresaw; they affect the whole world of\r\ncommerce and economic production; and they must be faced and dealt with.\r\n\r\nIt would be very unwise to postpone dealing with them. Delay in such a\r\nmatter and in the particular circumstances in which we now find\r\nourselves as a nation might involve consequences of the most\r\nembarrassing and deplorable sort, for which I, for one, would not care\r\nto be responsible. It would be very dangerous in the present\r\ncircumstances to create a moment's doubt as to the strength and\r\nsufficiency of the Treasury of the United States, its ability to\r\nassist, to steady, and sustain the financial operations of the country's\r\nbusiness. If the Treasury is known, or even thought, to be weak, where\r\nwill be our peace of mind? The whole industrial activity of the country\r\nwould be chilled and demoralized. Just now the peculiarly difficult\r\nfinancial problems of the moment are being successfully dealt with, with\r\ngreat self-possession and good sense and very sound judgment; but they\r\nare only in process of being worked out. If the process of solution is\r\nto be completed, no one must be given reason to doubt the solidity and\r\nadequacy of the Treasury of the Government which stands behind the whole\r\nmethod by which our difficulties are being met and handled.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury itself could get along for a considerable period, no doubt,\r\nwithout immediate resort to new sources of taxation. But at what cost to\r\nthe business of the community? Approximately $75,000,000, a large part\r\nof the present Treasury balance, is now on deposit with national banks\r\ndistributed throughout the country. It is deposited, of course, on call.\r\nI need not point out to you what the probable consequences of\r\ninconvenience and distress and confusion would be if the diminishing\r\nincome of the Treasury should make it necessary rapidly to withdraw\r\nthese deposits. And yet without additional revenue that plainly might\r\nbecome necessary, and the time when it became necessary could not be\r\ncontrolled or determined by the convenience of the business of the\r\ncountry. It would have to be determined by the operations and\r\nnecessities of the Treasury itself. Such risks are not necessary and\r\nought not to be run. We cannot too scrupulously or carefully safeguard a\r\nfinancial situation which is at best, while war continues in Europe,\r\ndifficult and abnormal. Hesitation and delay are the worst forms of bad\r\npolicy under such conditions.\r\n\r\nAnd we ought not to borrow. We ought to resort to taxation, however we\r\nmay regret the necessity of putting additional temporary burdens on our\r\npeople. To sell bonds would be to make a most untimely and unjustifiable\r\ndemand on the money market; untimely, because this is manifestly not the\r\ntime to withdraw working capital from other uses to pay the Government's\r\nbills; unjustifiable, because unnecessary. The country is able to pay\r\nany just and reasonable taxes without distress. And to every other form\r\nof borrowing, whether for long periods or, for short, there is the same\r\nobjection. These are not the circumstances, this is at this particular\r\nmoment and in this particular exigency not the market, to borrow large\r\nsums of money. What we are seeking is to ease and assist every financial\r\ntransaction, not to add a single additional embarrassment to the\r\nsituation. The people of this country are both intelligent and\r\nprofoundly patriotic. They are ready to meet the present conditions in\r\nthe right way and to support the Government with generous self-denial.\r\nThey know and understand, and will be intolerant only of those who dodge\r\nresponsibility or are not frank with them.\r\n\r\nThe occasion is not of our own making. We had no part in making it. But\r\nit is here. It affects us as directly and palpably almost as if we were\r\nparticipants in the circumstances which gave rise to it. We must accept\r\nthe inevitable with calm judgment and unruffled spirits, like men\r\naccustomed to deal with the unexpected, habituated to take care of\r\nthemselves, masters of their own affairs and their own fortunes. We\r\nshall pay the bill, though we did not deliberately incur it.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet every demand upon the Treasury without delay or\r\nperadventure and in order to keep the Treasury strong, unquestionably\r\nstrong, and strong throughout the present anxieties, I respectfully\r\nurge that an additional revenue of $100,000,000 be raised through\r\ninternal taxes devised in your wisdom to meet the emergency. The only\r\nsuggestion I take the liberty of making is that such sources of revenue\r\nbe chosen as will begin to yield at once and yield with a certain and\r\nconstant flow.\r\n\r\nI cannot close without expressing the confidence with which I approach a\r\nCongress, with regard to this or any other matter, which has shown so\r\nuntiring a devotion to public duty, which has responded to the needs of\r\nthe Nation throughout a long season despite inevitable fatigue and\r\npersonal sacrifice, and so large a proportion of whose Members have\r\ndevoted their whole time and energy to the business of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OPINION OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\n[Address before the American Bar Association, in Continental Hall,\r\nOctober 20, 1914.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT, GENTLEMEN OF THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION:\r\n\r\nI am very deeply gratified by the greeting that your president has given\r\nme and by your response to it. My only strength lies in your confidence.\r\n\r\nWe stand now in a peculiar case. Our first thought, I suppose, as\r\nlawyers, is of international law, of those bonds of right and principle\r\nwhich draw the nations together and hold the community of the world to\r\nsome standards of action. We know that we see in international law, as\r\nit were, the moral processes by which law itself came into existence. I\r\nknow that as a lawyer I have myself at times felt that there was no real\r\ncomparison between the law of a nation and the law of nations, because\r\nthe latter lacked the sanction that gave the former strength and\r\nvalidity. And yet, if you look into the matter more closely, you will\r\nfind that the two have the same foundations, and that those foundations\r\nare more evident and conspicuous in our day than they have ever been\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the world is the mistress of the world; and the processes\r\nof international law are the slow processes by which opinion works its\r\nwill. What impresses me is the constant thought that that is the\r\ntribunal at the bar of which we all sit. I would call your attention,\r\nincidentally, to the circumstance that it does not observe the ordinary\r\nrules of evidence; which has sometimes suggested to me that the ordinary\r\nrules of evidence had shown some signs of growing antique. Everything,\r\nrumor included, is heard in this court, and the standard of judgment is\r\nnot so much the character of the testimony as the character of the\r\nwitness. The motives are disclosed, the purposes are conjectured, and\r\nthat opinion is finally accepted which seems to be, not the best founded\r\nin law, perhaps, but the best founded in integrity of character and of\r\nmorals. That is the process which is slowly working its will upon the\r\nworld; and what we should be watchful of is not so much jealous\r\ninterests as sound principles of action. The disinterested course is\r\nalways the biggest course to pursue not only, but it is in the long run\r\nthe most profitable course to pursue. If you can establish your\r\ncharacter, you can establish your credit.\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted to suggest to this association, in bidding them very\r\nhearty welcome to the city, is whether we sufficiently apply these same\r\nideas to the body of municipal law which we seek to administer.\r\nCitations seem to play so much larger a role now than principle. There\r\nwas a time when the thoughtful eye of the judge rested upon the changes\r\nof social circumstances and almost palpably saw the law arise out of\r\nhuman life. Have we got to a time when the only way to change law is by\r\nstatute? The changing of law by statute seems to me like mending a\r\ngarment with a patch, whereas law should grow by the life that is in it,\r\nnot by the life that is outside of it.\r\n\r\nI once said to a lawyer with whom I was discussing some question of\r\nprecedent, and in whose presence I was venturing to doubt the rational\r\nvalidity, at any rate, of the particular precedents he cited, \"After\r\nall, isn't our object justice?\" And he said, \"God forbid! We should be\r\nvery much confused if we made that our standard. Our standard is to find\r\nout what the rule has been and how the rule that has been applies to the\r\ncase that is.\" I should hate to think that the law was based entirely\r\nupon \"has beens.\" I should hate to think that the law did not derive its\r\nimpulse from looking forward rather than from looking backward, or,\r\nrather, that it did not derive its instruction from looking about and\r\nseeing what the circumstances of man actually are and what the impulses\r\nof justice necessarily are.\r\n\r\nUnderstand me, gentlemen, I am not venturing in this presence to impeach\r\nthe law. For the present, by the force of circumstances, I am in part\r\nthe embodiment of the law, and it would be very awkward to disavow\r\nmyself. But I do wish to make this intimation, that in this time of\r\nworld change, in this time when we are going to find out just how, in\r\nwhat particulars, and to what extent the real facts of human life and\r\nthe real moral judgments of mankind prevail, it is worth while looking\r\ninside our municipal law and seeing whether the judgments of the law are\r\nmade square with the moral judgments of mankind. For I believe that we\r\nare custodians, not of commands, but of a spirit. We are custodians of\r\nthe spirit of righteousness, of the spirit of equal-handed justice, of\r\nthe spirit of hope which believes in the perfectibility of the law with\r\nthe perfectibility of human life itself.\r\n\r\nPublic life, like private life, would be very dull and dry if it were\r\nnot for this belief in the essential beauty of the human spirit and the\r\nbelief that the human spirit could be translated into action and into\r\nordinance. Not entire. You cannot go any faster than you can advance the\r\naverage moral judgments of the mass, but you can go at least as fast as\r\nthat, and you can see to it that you do not lag behind the average moral\r\njudgments of the mass. I have in my life dealt with all sorts and\r\nconditions of men, and I have found that the flame of moral judgment\r\nburned just as bright in the man of humble life and limited experience\r\nas in the scholar and the man of affairs. And I would like his voice\r\nalways to be heard, not as a witness, not as speaking in his own case,\r\nbut as if he were the voice of men in general, in our courts of justice,\r\nas well as the voice of the lawyers, remembering what the law has been.\r\nMy hope is that, being stirred to the depths by the extraordinary\r\ncircumstances of the time in which we live, we may recover from those\r\ndepths something of a renewal of that vision of the law with which men\r\nmay be supposed to have started out in the old days of the oracles, who\r\ncommuned with the intimations of divinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POWER OF CHRISTIAN YOUNG MEN\r\n\r\n[Address at the Young Men's Christian Association's Celebration,\r\nPittsburgh, October 24, 1914.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT, MR. PORTER, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nI feel almost as if I were a truant, being away from Washington to-day,\r\nbut I thought that perhaps if I were absent the Congress would have the\r\nmore leisure to adjourn. I do not ordinarily open my office at\r\nWashington on Saturday. Being a schoolmaster, I am accustomed to a\r\nSaturday holiday, and I thought I could not better spend a holiday than\r\nby showing at least something of the true direction of my affections;\r\nfor by long association with the men who have worked for this\r\norganization I can say that it has enlisted my deep affection.\r\n\r\nI am interested in it for various reasons. First of all, because it is\r\nan association of young men. I have had a good deal to do with young men\r\nin my time, and I have formed an impression of them which I believe to\r\nbe contrary to the general impression. They are generally thought to be\r\narch radicals. As a matter of fact, they are the most conservative\r\npeople I have ever dealt with. Go to a college community and try to\r\nchange the least custom of that little world and find how the\r\nconservatives will rush at you. Moreover, young men are embarrassed by\r\nhaving inherited their fathers' opinions. I have often said that the use\r\nof a university is to make young gentlemen as unlike their fathers as\r\npossible. I do not say that with the least disrespect for the fathers;\r\nbut every man who is old enough to have a son in college is old enough\r\nto have become very seriously immersed in some particular business and\r\nis almost certain to have caught the point of view of that particular\r\nbusiness. And it is very useful to his son to be taken out of that\r\nnarrow circle, conducted to some high place where he may see the general\r\nmap of the world and of the interests of mankind, and there shown how\r\nbig the world is and how much of it his father may happen to have\r\nforgotten. It would be worth while for men, middle-aged and old, to\r\ndetach themselves more frequently from the things that command their\r\ndaily attention and to think of the sweeping tides of humanity.\r\n\r\nTherefore I am interested in this association, because it is intended to\r\nbring young men together before any crust has formed over them, before\r\nthey have been hardened to any particular occupation, before they have\r\ncaught an inveterate point of view; while they still have a searchlight\r\nthat they can swing and see what it reveals of all the circumstances of\r\nthe hidden world.\r\n\r\nI am the more interested in it because it is an association of young men\r\nwho are Christians. I wonder if we attach sufficient importance to\r\nChristianity as a mere instrumentality in the life of mankind. For one,\r\nI am not fond of thinking of Christianity as the means of saving\r\n_individual_ souls. I have always been very impatient of processes and\r\ninstitutions which said that their purpose was to put every man in the\r\nway of developing his character. My advice is: Do not think about your\r\ncharacter. If you will think about what you ought to do for other\r\npeople, your character will take care of itself. Character is a\r\nby-product, and any man who devotes himself to its cultivation in his\r\nown case will become a selfish prig. The only way your powers can become\r\ngreat is by exerting them outside the circle of your own narrow,\r\nspecial, selfish interests. And that is the reason of Christianity.\r\nChrist came into the world to save others, not to save himself; and no\r\nman is a true Christian who does not think constantly of how he can lift\r\nhis brother, how he can assist his friend, how he can enlighten mankind,\r\nhow he can make virtue the rule of conduct in the circle in which he\r\nlives. An association merely of young men might be an association that\r\nhad its energies put forth in every direction, but an association of\r\nChristian young men is an association meant to put its shoulders under\r\nthe world and lift it, so that other men may feel that they have\r\ncompanions in bearing the weight and heat of the day; that other men may\r\nknow that there are those who care for them, who would go into places of\r\ndifficulty and danger to rescue them, who regard themselves as their\r\nbrother's keeper.\r\n\r\nAnd, then, I am glad that it is an association. Every word of its title\r\nmeans an element of strength. Young men are strong. Christian young men\r\nare the strongest kind of young men, and when they associate themselves\r\ntogether they have the incomparable strength of organization. The Young\r\nMen's Christian Association once excited, perhaps it is not too much to\r\nsay, the hostility of the organized churches of the Christian world,\r\nbecause the movement looked as if it were so non-sectarian, as if it\r\nwere so outside the ecclesiastical field, that perhaps it was an effort\r\nto draw young men away from the churches and to substitute this\r\norganization for the great bodies of Christian people who joined\r\nthemselves in the Christian denominations. But after a while it appeared\r\nthat it was a great instrumentality that belonged to all the churches;\r\nthat it was a common instrument for sending the light of Christianity\r\nout into the world in its most practical form, drawing young men who\r\nwere strangers into places where they could have companionship that\r\nstimulated them and suggestions that kept them straight and occupations\r\nthat amused them without vicious practice; and then, by surrounding\r\nthemselves with an atmosphere of purity and of simplicity of life, catch\r\nsomething of a glimpse of the great ideal which Christ lifted when He\r\nwas elevated upon the cross.\r\n\r\nI remember hearing a very wise man say once, a man grown old in the\r\nservice of a great church, that he had never taught his son religion\r\ndogmatically at any time; that he and the boy's mother had agreed that\r\nif the atmosphere of that home did not make a Christian of the boy,\r\nnothing that they could say would make a Christian of him. They knew\r\nthat Christianity was catching, and if they did not have it, it would\r\nnot be communicated. If they did have it, it would penetrate while the\r\nboy slept, almost; while he was unconscious of the sweet influences that\r\nwere about him, while he reckoned nothing of instruction, but merely\r\nbreathed into his lungs the wholesome air of a Christian home. That is\r\nthe principle of the Young Men's Christian Association--to make a place\r\nwhere the atmosphere makes great ideals contagious. That is the reason\r\nthat I said, though I had forgotten that I said it, what is quoted on\r\nthe outer page of the program--that you can test a modern community by\r\nthe degree of its interest in its Young Men's Christian Association. You\r\ncan test whether it knows what road it wants to travel or not. You can\r\ntest whether it is deeply interested in the spiritual and essential\r\nprosperity of its rising generation. I know of no test that can be more\r\nconclusively put to a community than that.\r\n\r\nI want to suggest to the young men of this association that it is the\r\nduty of young men not only to combine for the things that are good, but\r\nto combine in a militant spirit. There is a fine passage in one of\r\nMilton's prose writings which I am sorry to say I cannot quote, but the\r\nmeaning of which I can give you, and it is worth hearing.[E] He says\r\nthat he has no patience with a cloistered virtue that does not go out\r\nand seek its adversary. Ah, how tired I am of the men who are merely on\r\nthe defensive, who hedge themselves in, who perhaps enlarge the hedge\r\nenough to include their little family circle and ward off all the evil\r\ninfluences of the world from that loved and hallowed group. How tired I\r\nam of the men whose virtue is selfish because it is merely\r\nself-protective! And how much I wish that men by the hundred thousand\r\nmight volunteer to go out and seek an adversary and subdue him!\r\n\r\nI have had the fortune to take part in affairs of a considerable variety\r\nof sorts, and I have tried to hate as few persons as possible, but there\r\nis an exquisite combination of contempt and hate that I have for a\r\nparticular kind of person, and that is the moral coward. I wish we could\r\ngive all our cowards a perpetual vacation. Let them go off and sit on\r\nthe side lines and see us play the game; and put them off the field if\r\nthey interfere with the game. They do nothing but harm, and they do it\r\nby that most subtle and fatal thing of all, that of taking the momentum\r\nand the spirit and the forward dash out of things. A man who is virtuous\r\nand a coward has no marketable virtue about him. The virtue, I repeat,\r\nwhich is merely self-defensive is not serviceable even, I suspect, to\r\nhimself. For how a man can swallow and not taste bad when he is a coward\r\nand thinking only of himself I cannot imagine.\r\n\r\nBe militant! Be an organization that is going to do things! If you can\r\nfind older men who will give you countenance and acceptable leadership,\r\nfollow them; but if you cannot, organize separately and dispense with\r\nthem. There are only two sorts of men worth associating with when\r\nsomething is to be done. Those are young men and men who never grow old.\r\nNow, if you find men who have grown old, about whom the crust has\r\nhardened, whose hinges are stiff, whose minds always have their eye over\r\nthe shoulder thinking of things as they _were_ done, do not have\r\nanything to do with them. It would not be Christian to exclude them from\r\nyour organization, but merely use them to pad the roll. If you can find\r\nolder men who will lead you acceptably and keep you in countenance, I am\r\nbound as an older man to advise you to follow them. But suit yourselves.\r\nDo not follow people that stand still. Just remind them that this is not\r\na statical proposition; it is a movement, and if they cannot get a move\r\non them they are not serviceable.\r\n\r\nLife, gentlemen--the life of society, the life of the world--has\r\nconstantly to be fed from the bottom. It has to be fed by those great\r\nsources of strength which are constantly rising in new generations. Red\r\nblood has to be pumped into it. New fiber has to be supplied. That is\r\nthe reason I have always said that I believed in popular institutions.\r\nIf you can guess beforehand whom your rulers are going to be, you can\r\nguess with a very great certainty that most of them will not be fit to\r\nrule. The beauty of popular institutions is that you do not know where\r\nthe man is going to come from, and you do not care so he is the right\r\nman. You do not know whether he will come from the avenue or from the\r\nalley. You do not know whether he will come from the city or the farm.\r\nYou do not know whether you will ever have heard that name before or\r\nnot. Therefore you do not limit at any point your supply of new\r\nstrength. You do not say it has got to come through the blood of a\r\nparticular family or through the processes of a particular training, or\r\nby anything except the native impulse and genius of the man himself. The\r\nhumblest hovel, therefore, may produce you your greatest man. A very\r\nhumble hovel did produce you one of your greatest men. That is the\r\nprocess of life, this constant surging up of the new strength of\r\nunnamed, unrecognized, uncatalogued men who are just getting into the\r\nrunning, who are just coming up from the masses of the unrecognized\r\nmultitude. You do not know when you will see above the level masses of\r\nthe crowd some great stature lifted head and shoulders above the rest,\r\nshouldering its way, not violently but gently, to the front and saying,\r\n\"Here am I; follow me.\" And his voice will be your voice, his thought\r\nwill be your thought, and you will follow him as if you were following\r\nthe best things in yourselves.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of an association of Christian young men I wonder that it\r\nhas not already turned the world upside down. I wonder, not that it has\r\ndone so much, for it has done a great deal, but that it has done so\r\nlittle; and I can only conjecture that it does not realize its own\r\nstrength. I can only imagine that it has not yet got its pace. I wish I\r\ncould believe, and I do believe, that at seventy it is just reaching its\r\nmajority, and that from this time on a dream greater even than George\r\nWilliams[F] ever dreamed will be realized in the great accumulating\r\nmomentum of Christian men throughout the world. For, gentlemen, this is\r\nan age in which the principles of men who utter public opinion dominate\r\nthe world. It makes no difference what is done for the time being. After\r\nthe struggle is over the jury will sit, and nobody can corrupt that\r\njury.\r\n\r\nAt one time I tried to write history. I did not know enough to write it,\r\nbut I knew from experience how hard it was to find an historian out, and\r\nI trusted I would not be found out. I used to have this comfortable\r\nthought as I saw men struggling in the public arena. I used to think to\r\nmyself, \"This is all very well and very interesting. You probably assess\r\nyourself in such and such a way. Those who are your partisans assess you\r\nthus and so. Those who are your opponents urge a different verdict. But\r\nit does not make very much difference, because after you are dead and\r\ngone some quiet historian will sit in a secluded room and tell mankind\r\nfor the rest of time just what to think about you, and his verdict, not\r\nthe verdict of your partisans and not the verdict of your opponents,\r\nwill be the verdict of posterity.\" I say that I used to say that to\r\nmyself. It very largely was not so. And yet it was true in this sense:\r\nIf the historian really speaks the judgment of the succeeding\r\ngeneration, then he really speaks the judgment also of the generations\r\nthat succeed it, and his assessment, made without the passion of the\r\ntime, made without partisan feeling in the matter--in other\r\ncircumstances, when the air is cool--is the judgment of mankind upon\r\nyour actions.\r\n\r\nNow, is it not very important that we who shall constitute a portion of\r\nthe jury should get our best judgments to work and base them upon\r\nChristian forbearance and Christian principles, upon the idea that it is\r\nimpossible by sophistication to establish that a thing that is wrong is\r\nright? And yet, while we are going to judge with the absolute standard\r\nof righteousness, we are going to judge with Christian feeling, being\r\nmen of a like sort ourselves, suffering the same temptations, having the\r\nsame weaknesses, knowing the same passions; and while we do not\r\ncondemn, we are going to seek to say and to live the truth. What I am\r\nhoping for is that these seventy years have just been a running start,\r\nand that now there will be a great rush of Christian principle upon the\r\nstrongholds of evil and of wrong in the world. Those strongholds are not\r\nas strong as they look. Almost every vicious man is afraid of society,\r\nand if you once open the door where he is, he will run. All you have to\r\ndo is to fight, not with cannon but with light.\r\n\r\nMay I illustrate it in this way? The Government of the United States has\r\njust succeeded in concluding a large number of treaties with the leading\r\nnations of the world, the sum and substance of which is this, that\r\nwhenever any trouble arises the light shall shine on it for a year\r\nbefore anything is done; and my prediction is that after the light has\r\nshone on it for a year it will not be necessary to do anything; that\r\nafter we know what happened, then we will know who was right and who was\r\nwrong. I believe that light is the greatest sanitary influence in the\r\nworld. That, I suppose, is scientific commonplace, because if you want\r\nto make a place wholesome the best instrument you can use is the sun; to\r\nlet his rays in, let him search out all the miasma that may lurk there.\r\nSo with moral light: It is the most wholesome and rectifying, as well as\r\nthe most revealing, thing in the world, provided it be genuine moral\r\nlight; not the light of inquisitiveness, not the light of the man who\r\nlikes to turn up ugly things, not the light of the man who disturbs what\r\nis corrupt for the mere sake of the sensation that he creates by\r\ndisturbing it, but the moral light, the light of the man who discloses\r\nit in order that all the sweet influences of the world may go in and\r\nmake it better.\r\n\r\nThat, in my judgment, is what the Young Men's Christian Association can\r\ndo. It can point out to its members the things that are wrong. It can\r\nguide the feet of those who are going astray; and when its members have\r\nrealized the power of the Christian principle, then they will not be men\r\nif they do not unite to see that the rest of the world experiences the\r\nsame emancipation and reaches the same happiness of release.\r\n\r\nI believe in the Young Men's Christian Association because I believe in\r\nthe progress of moral ideas in the world; and I do not know that I am\r\nsure of anything else. When you are after something and have formulated\r\nit and have done the very best thing you know how to do you have got to\r\nbe sure for the time being that that is the thing to do. But you are a\r\nfool if in the back of your head you do not know it is possible that you\r\nare mistaken. All that you can claim is that that is the thing as you\r\nsee it now and that you cannot stand still; that you must push forward\r\nthe things that are right. It may turn out that you made mistakes, but\r\nwhat you do know is your direction, and you are sure you are moving in\r\nthat way. I was once a college reformer, until discouraged, and I\r\nremember a classmate of mine saying, \"Why, man, can't you let anything\r\nalone?\" I said, \"I let everything alone that you can show me is not\r\nitself moving in the wrong direction, but I am not going to let those\r\nthings alone that I see are going downhill\"; and I borrowed this\r\nillustration from an ingenious writer. He says, \"If you have a post that\r\nis painted white and want to keep it white, you cannot let it alone; and\r\nif anybody says to you, 'Why don't you let that post alone,' you will\r\nsay, 'Because I want it to stay white, and therefore I have got to paint\r\nit at least every second year.'\" There isn't anything in this world that\r\nwill not change if you absolutely let it alone, and therefore you have\r\nconstantly to be attending to it to see that it is being taken care of\r\nin the right way and that, if it is part of the motive force of the\r\nworld, it is moving in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThat means that eternal vigilance is the price, not only of liberty, but\r\nof a great many other things. It is the price of everything that is\r\ngood. It is the price of one's own soul. It is the price of the souls of\r\nthe people you love; and when it comes down to the final reckoning you\r\nhave a standard that is immutable. What shall a man give in exchange for\r\nhis own soul? Will he sell that? Will he consent to see another man sell\r\nhis soul? Will he consent to see the conditions of his community such\r\nthat men's souls are debauched and trodden underfoot in the mire? What\r\nshall he give in exchange for his own soul, or any other man's soul? And\r\nsince the world, the world of affairs, the world of society, is nothing\r\nless and nothing more than all of us put together, it is a great\r\nenterprise for the salvation of the soul in this world as well as in the\r\nnext. There is a text in Scripture that has always interested me\r\nprofoundly. It says godliness is profitable in this life as well as in\r\nthe life that is to come; and if you do not start it in this life, it\r\nwill not reach the life that is to come. Your measurements, your\r\ndirections, your whole momentum, have to be established before you reach\r\nthe next world. This world is intended as the place in which we shall\r\nshow that we know how to grow in the stature of manliness and of\r\nrighteousness.\r\n\r\nI have come here to bid Godspeed to the great work of the Young Men's\r\nChristian Association. I love to think of the gathering force of such\r\nthings as this in the generations to come. If a man had to measure the\r\naccomplishments of society, the progress of reform, the speed of the\r\nworld's betterment, by the few little things that happened in his own\r\nlife, by the trifling things that he can contribute to accomplish, he\r\nwould indeed feel that the cost was much greater than the result. But no\r\nman can look at the past of the history of this world without seeing a\r\nvision of the future of the history of this world; and when you think of\r\nthe accumulated moral forces that have made one age better than another\r\nage in the progress of mankind, then you can open your eyes to the\r\nvision. You can see that age by age, though with a blind struggle in the\r\ndust of the road, though often mistaking the path and losing its way in\r\nthe mire, mankind is yet--sometimes with bloody hands and battered\r\nknees--nevertheless struggling step after step up the slow stages to the\r\nday when he shall live in the full light which shines upon the uplands,\r\nwhere all the light that illumines mankind shines direct from the face\r\nof God.\r\n\r\n[E] In the _Areopagitica_: \"I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered\r\nvirtue, unexercised and unbreathed, that never sallies out and sees her\r\nadversary, but slinks out of the race, where that immortal garland is to\r\nbe run for, not without dust and heat.\"\r\n\r\n[F] Sir George Williams, 1821-1905, an English philanthropist, founder\r\nof the Young Men's Christian Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL ADDRESS TO CONGRESS\r\n\r\n[Delivered at a joint session of the two Houses of Congress, December 8,\r\n1914.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nThe session upon which you are now entering will be the closing session\r\nof the Sixty-third Congress, a Congress, I venture to say, which will\r\nlong be remembered for the great body of thoughtful and constructive\r\nwork which it has done, in loyal response to the thought and needs of\r\nthe country. I should like in this address to review the notable record\r\nand try to make adequate assessment of it; but no doubt we stand too\r\nnear the work that has been done and are ourselves too much part of it\r\nto play the part of historians toward it.\r\n\r\nOur program of legislation with regard to the regulation of business is\r\nnow virtually complete. It has been put forth, as we intended, as a\r\nwhole, and leaves no conjecture as to what is to follow. The road at\r\nlast lies clear and firm before business. It is a road which it can\r\ntravel without fear or embarrassment. It is the road to ungrudged,\r\nunclouded success. In it every honest man, every man who believes that\r\nthe public interest is part of his own interest, may walk with perfect\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nMoreover, our thoughts are now more of the future than of the past.\r\nWhile we have worked at our tasks of peace the circumstances of the\r\nwhole age have been altered by war. What we have done for our own land\r\nand our own people we did with the best that was in us, whether of\r\ncharacter or of intelligence, with sober enthusiasm and a confidence in\r\nthe principles upon which we were acting which sustained us at every\r\nstep of the difficult undertaking; but it is done. It has passed from\r\nour hands. It is now an established part of the legislation of the\r\ncountry. Its usefulness, its effects will disclose themselves in\r\nexperience. What chiefly strikes us now, as we look about us during\r\nthese closing days of a year which will be forever memorable in the\r\nhistory of the world, is that we face new tasks, have been facing them\r\nthese six months, must face them in the months to come,--face them\r\nwithout partisan feeling, like men who have forgotten everything but a\r\ncommon duty and the fact that we are representatives of a great people\r\nwhose thought is not of us but of what America owes to herself and to\r\nall mankind in such circumstances as these upon which we look amazed and\r\nanxious.\r\n\r\nWar has interrupted the means of trade not only but also the processes\r\nof production. In Europe it is destroying men and resources wholesale\r\nand upon a scale unprecedented and appalling. There is reason to fear\r\nthat the time is near, if it be not already at hand, when several of the\r\ncountries of Europe will find it difficult to do for their people what\r\nthey have hitherto been always easily able to do,--many essential and\r\nfundamental things. At any rate, they will need our help and our\r\nmanifold services as they have never needed them before; and we should\r\nbe ready, more fit and ready than we have ever been.\r\n\r\nIt is of equal consequence that the nations whom Europe has usually\r\nsupplied with innumerable articles of manufacture and commerce of which\r\nthey are in constant need and without which their economic development\r\nhalts and stands still can now get only a small part of what they\r\nformerly imported and eagerly look to us to supply their all but empty\r\nmarkets. This is particularly true of our own neighbors, the States,\r\ngreat and small, of Central and South America. Their lines of trade have\r\nhitherto run chiefly athwart the seas, not to our ports but to the\r\nports of Great Britain and of the older continent of Europe. I do not\r\nstop to inquire why, or to make any comment on probable causes. What\r\ninterests us just now is not the explanation but the fact, and our duty\r\nand opportunity in the presence of it. Here are markets which we must\r\nsupply, and we must find the means of action. The United States, this\r\ngreat people for whom we speak and act, should be ready, as never\r\nbefore, to serve itself and to serve mankind; ready with its resources,\r\nits energies, its forces of production, and its means of distribution.\r\n\r\nIt is a very practical matter, a matter of ways and means. We have the\r\nresources, but are we fully ready to use them? And, if we can make ready\r\nwhat we have, have we the means at hand to distribute it? We are not\r\nfully ready; neither have we the means of distribution. We are willing,\r\nbut we are not fully able. We have the wish to serve and to serve\r\ngreatly, generously; but we are not prepared as we should be. We are not\r\nready to mobilize our resources at once. We are not prepared to use them\r\nimmediately and at their best, without delay and without waste.\r\n\r\nTo speak plainly, we have grossly erred in the way in which we have\r\nstunted and hindered the development of our merchant marine. And now,\r\nwhen we need ships, we have not got them. We have year after year\r\ndebated, without end or conclusion, the best policy to pursue with\r\nregard to the use of the ores and forests and water powers of our\r\nnational domain in the rich States of the West, when we should have\r\nacted; and they are still locked up. The key is still turned upon them,\r\nthe door shut fast at which thousands of vigorous men, full of\r\ninitiative, knock clamorously for admittance. The water power of our\r\nnavigable streams outside the national domain also, even in the eastern\r\nStates, where we have worked and planned for generations, is still not\r\nused as it might be, because we will and we won't; because the laws we\r\nhave made do not intelligently balance encouragement against restraint.\r\nWe withhold by regulation.\r\n\r\nI have come to ask you to remedy and correct these mistakes and\r\nomissions, even at this short session of a Congress which would\r\ncertainly seem to have done all the work that could reasonably be\r\nexpected of it. The time and the circumstances are extraordinary, and so\r\nmust our efforts be also.\r\n\r\nFortunately, two great measures, finely conceived, the one to unlock,\r\nwith proper safeguards, the resources of the national domain, the other\r\nto encourage the use of the navigable waters outside that domain for the\r\ngeneration of power, have already passed the House of Representatives\r\nand are ready for immediate consideration and action by the Senate. With\r\nthe deepest earnestness I urge their prompt passage. In them both we\r\nturn our backs upon hesitation and makeshift and formulate a genuine\r\npolicy of use and conservation, in the best sense of those words. We owe\r\nthe one measure not only to the people of that great western country for\r\nwhose free and systematic development, as it seems to me, our\r\nlegislation has done so little, but also to the people of the Nation as\r\na whole; and we as clearly owe the other in fulfillment of our repeated\r\npromises that the water power of the country should in fact as well as\r\nin name be put at the disposal of great industries which can make\r\neconomical and profitable use of it, the rights of the public being\r\nadequately guarded the while, and monopoly in the use prevented. To have\r\nbegun such measures and not completed them would indeed mar the record\r\nof this great Congress very seriously. I hope and confidently believe\r\nthat they will be completed.\r\n\r\nAnd there is another great piece of legislation which awaits and should\r\nreceive the sanction of the Senate: I mean the bill which gives a larger\r\nmeasure of self-government to the people of the Philippines. How better,\r\nin this time of anxious questioning and perplexed policy, could we show\r\nour confidence in the principles of liberty, as the source as well as\r\nthe expression of life, how better could we demonstrate our own\r\nself-possession and steadfastness in the courses of justice and\r\ndisinterestedness than by thus going calmly forward to fulfill our\r\npromises to a dependent people, who will now look more anxiously than\r\never to see whether we have indeed the liberality, the unselfishness,\r\nthe courage, the faith we have boasted and professed. I cannot believe\r\nthat the Senate will let this great measure of constructive justice\r\nawait the action of another Congress. Its passage would nobly crown the\r\nrecord of these two years of memorable labor.\r\n\r\nBut I think that you will agree with me that this does not complete the\r\ntoll of our duty. How are we to carry our goods to the empty markets of\r\nwhich I have spoken if we have not the ships? How are we to build up a\r\ngreat trade if we have not the certain and constant means of\r\ntransportation upon which all profitable and useful commerce depends?\r\nAnd how are we to get the ships if we wait for the trade to develop\r\nwithout them? To correct the many mistakes by which we have discouraged\r\nand all but destroyed the merchant marine of the country, to retrace the\r\nsteps by which we have, it seems almost deliberately, withdrawn our flag\r\nfrom the seas, except where, here and there, a ship of war is bidden\r\ncarry it or some wandering yacht displays it, would take a long time and\r\ninvolve many detailed items of legislation, and the trade which we ought\r\nimmediately to handle would disappear or find other channels while we\r\ndebated the items.\r\n\r\nThe case is not unlike that which confronted us when our own continent\r\nwas to be opened up to settlement and industry, and we needed long lines\r\nof railway, extended means of transportation prepared beforehand, if\r\ndevelopment was not to lag intolerably and wait interminably. We\r\nlavishly subsidized the building of transcontinental railroads. We look\r\nback upon that with regret now, because the subsidies led to many\r\nscandals of which we are ashamed; but we know that the railroads had to\r\nbe built, and if we had it to do over again we should of course build\r\nthem, but in another way. Therefore I propose another way of providing\r\nthe means of transportation, which must precede, not tardily follow, the\r\ndevelopment of our trade with our neighbor states of America. It may\r\nseem a reversal of the natural order of things, but it is true, that the\r\nroutes of trade must be actually opened--by many ships and regular\r\nsailings and moderate charges--before streams of merchandise will flow\r\nfreely and profitably through them.\r\n\r\nHence the pending shipping bill, discussed at the last session but as\r\nyet passed by neither House. In my judgment such legislation is\r\nimperatively needed and cannot wisely be postponed. The Government must\r\nopen these gates of trade, and open them wide; open them before it is\r\naltogether profitable to open them, or altogether reasonable to ask\r\nprivate capital to open them at a venture. It is not a question of the\r\nGovernment monopolizing the field. It should take action to make it\r\ncertain that transportation at reasonable rates will be promptly\r\nprovided, even where the carriage is not at first profitable; and then,\r\nwhen the carriage has become sufficiently profitable to attract and\r\nengage private capital, and engage it in abundance, the Government ought\r\nto withdraw. I very earnestly hope that the Congress will be of this\r\nopinion, and that both Houses will adopt this exceedingly important\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nThe great subject of rural credits still remains to be dealt with, and\r\nit is a matter of deep regret that the difficulties of the subject have\r\nseemed to render it impossible to complete a bill for passage at this\r\nsession. But it cannot be perfected yet, and therefore there are no\r\nother constructive measures the necessity for which I will at this time\r\ncall your attention to; but I would be negligent of a very manifest duty\r\nwere I not to call the attention of the Senate to the fact that the\r\nproposed convention for safety at sea awaits its confirmation and that\r\nthe limit fixed in the convention itself for its acceptance is the last\r\nday of the present month. The conference in which this 15 convention\r\noriginated was called by the United States; the representatives of the\r\nUnited States played a very influential part indeed in framing the\r\nprovisions of the proposed convention; and those provisions are in\r\nthemselves for the most part admirable. It would hardly be consistent\r\nwith the part we have played in the whole matter to let it drop and go\r\nby the board as if forgotten and neglected. It was ratified in May last\r\nby the German Government and in August by the Parliament of Great\r\nBritain. It marks a most hopeful and decided advance in international\r\ncivilization. We should show our earnest good faith in a great matter by\r\nadding our own acceptance of it.\r\n\r\nThere is another matter of which I must make special mention, if I am to\r\ndischarge my conscience, lest it should escape your attention. It may\r\nseem a very small thing. It affects only a single item of appropriation.\r\nBut many human lives and many great enterprises hang upon it. It is the\r\nmatter of making adequate provision for the survey and charting of our\r\ncoasts. It is immediately pressing and exigent in connection with the\r\nimmense coast line of Alaska, a coast line greater than that of the\r\nUnited States themselves, though it is also very important indeed with\r\nregard to the older coasts of the continent. We cannot use our great\r\nAlaskan domain, ships will not ply thither, if those coasts and their\r\nmany hidden dangers are not thoroughly surveyed and charted. The work is\r\nincomplete at almost every point. Ships and lives have been lost in\r\nthreading what were supposed to be well-known main channels. We have not\r\nprovided adequate vessels or adequate machinery for the survey and\r\ncharting. We have used old vessels that were not big enough or strong\r\nenough and which were so nearly unseaworthy that our inspectors would\r\nnot have allowed private owners to send them to sea. This is a matter\r\nwhich, as I have said, seems small, but is in reality very great. Its\r\nimportance has only to be looked into to be appreciated.\r\n\r\nBefore I close may I say a few words upon two topics, much discussed out\r\nof doors, upon which it is highly important that our judgments should be\r\nclear, definite, and steadfast?\r\n\r\nOne of these is economy in government expenditures. The duty of economy\r\nis not debatable. It is manifest and imperative. In the appropriations\r\nwe pass we are spending the money of the great people whose servants we\r\nare,--not our own. We are trustees and responsible stewards in the\r\nspending. The only thing debatable and upon which we should be careful\r\nto make our thought and purpose clear is the kind of economy demanded of\r\nus. I assert with the greatest confidence that the people of the United\r\nStates are not jealous of the amount their Government costs if they are\r\nsure that they get what they need and desire for the outlay, that the\r\nmoney is being spent for objects of which they approve, and that it is\r\nbeing applied with good business sense and management.\r\n\r\nGovernments grow, piecemeal, both in their tasks and in the means by\r\nwhich those tasks are to be performed, and very few Governments are\r\norganized, I venture to say, as wise and experienced business men would\r\norganize them if they had a clean sheet of paper to write upon.\r\nCertainly the Government of the United States is not. I think that it is\r\ngenerally agreed that there should be a systematic reorganization and\r\nreassembling of its parts so as to secure greater efficiency and effect\r\nconsiderable savings in expense. But the amount of money saved in that\r\nway would, I believe, though no doubt considerable in itself, running,\r\nit may be, into the millions, be relatively small,--small, I mean, in\r\nproportion to the total necessary outlays of the Government. It would be\r\nthoroughly worth effecting, as every saving would, great or small. Our\r\nduty is not altered by the scale of the saving. But my point is that the\r\npeople of the United States do not wish to curtail the activities of\r\nthis Government; they wish, rather, to enlarge them; and with every\r\nenlargement, with the mere growth, indeed, of the country itself, there\r\nmust come, of course, the inevitable increase of expense. The sort of\r\neconomy we ought to practice may be effected, and ought to be effected,\r\nby a careful study and assessment of the tasks to be performed; and the\r\nmoney spent ought to be made to yield the best possible returns in\r\nefficiency and achievement. And, like good stewards, we should so\r\naccount for every dollar of our appropriations as to make it perfectly\r\nevident what it was spent for and in what way it was spent.\r\n\r\nIt is not expenditure but extravagance that we should fear being\r\ncriticized for; not paying for the legitimate enterprises and\r\nundertakings of a great Government whose people command what it should\r\ndo, but adding what will benefit only a few or pouring money out for\r\nwhat need not have been undertaken at all or might have been postponed\r\nor better and more economically conceived and carried out. The Nation is\r\nnot niggardly; it is very generous. It will chide us only if we forget\r\nfor whom we pay money out and whose money it is we pay. These are large\r\nand general standards, but they are not very difficult of application to\r\nparticular cases.\r\n\r\nThe other topic I shall take leave to mention goes deeper into the\r\nprinciples of our national life and policy. It is the subject of\r\nnational defense.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be discussed without first answering some very searching\r\nquestions. It is said in some quarters that we are not prepared for war.\r\nWhat is meant by being prepared? Is it meant that we are not ready upon\r\nbrief notice to put a nation in the field, a nation of men trained to\r\narms? Of course we are not ready to do that; and we shall never be in\r\ntime of peace so long as we retain our present political principles and\r\ninstitutions. And what is it that it is suggested we should be prepared\r\nto do? To defend ourselves against attack? We have always found means to\r\ndo that, and shall find them whenever it is necessary without calling\r\nour people away from their necessary tasks to render compulsory military\r\nservice in times of peace.\r\n\r\nAllow me to speak with great plainness and directness upon this great\r\nmatter and to avow my convictions with deep earnestness. I have tried to\r\nknow what America is, what her people think, what they are, what they\r\nmost cherish and hold dear. I hope that some of their finer passions are\r\nin my own heart,--some of the great conceptions and desires which gave\r\nbirth to this Government and which have made the voice of this people a\r\nvoice of peace and hope and liberty among the peoples of the world, and\r\nthat, speaking my own thoughts, I shall, at least in part, speak theirs\r\nalso, however faintly and inadequately, upon this vital matter.\r\n\r\nWe are at peace with all the world. No one who speaks counsel based on\r\nfact or drawn from a just and candid interpretation of realities can say\r\nthat there is reason to fear that from any quarter our independence or\r\nthe integrity of our territory is threatened. Dread of the power of any\r\nother nation we are incapable of. We are not jealous of rivalry in the\r\nfields of commerce or of any other peaceful achievement. We mean to live\r\nour own lives as we will; but we mean also to let live. We are, indeed,\r\na true friend to all the nations of the world, because we threaten none,\r\ncovet the possessions of none, desire the overthrow of none. Our\r\nfriendship can be accepted and is accepted without reservation, because\r\nit is offered in a spirit and for a purpose which no one need ever\r\nquestion or suspect. Therein lies our greatness. We are the champions of\r\npeace and of concord. And we should be very jealous of this distinction\r\nwhich we have sought to earn. Just now we should be particularly jealous\r\nof it, because it is our dearest present hope that this character and\r\nreputation may presently, in God's providence, bring us an opportunity\r\nsuch as has seldom been vouchsafed any nation, the opportunity to\r\ncounsel and obtain peace in the world and reconciliation and a healing\r\nsettlement of many a matter that has cooled and interrupted the\r\nfriendship of nations. This is the time above all others when we should\r\nwish and resolve to keep our strength by self-possession, our influence\r\nby preserving our ancient principles of action.\r\n\r\nFrom the first we have had a clear and settled policy with regard to\r\nmilitary establishments. We never have had, and while we retain our\r\npresent principles and ideals we never shall have, a large standing\r\narmy. If asked, Are you ready to defend yourselves? we reply, Most\r\nassuredly, to the utmost; and yet we shall not turn America into a\r\nmilitary camp. We will not ask our young men to spend the best years of\r\ntheir lives making soldiers of themselves. There is another sort of\r\nenergy in us. It will know how to declare itself and make itself\r\neffective should occasion arise. And especially when half the world is\r\non fire we shall be careful to make our moral insurance against the\r\nspread of the conflagration very definite and certain and adequate\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nLet us remind ourselves, therefore, of the only thing we can do or will\r\ndo. We must depend in every time of national peril, in the future as in\r\nthe past, not upon a standing army, nor yet upon a reserve army, but\r\nupon a citizenry trained and accustomed to arms. It will be right\r\nenough, right American policy, based upon our accustomed principles and\r\npractices, to provide a system by which every citizen who will volunteer\r\nfor the training may be made familiar with the use of modern arms, the\r\nrudiments or drill and maneuver, and the maintenance and sanitation of\r\ncamps. We should encourage such training and make it a means of\r\ndiscipline which our young men will learn to value. It is right that we\r\nshould provide it not only, but that we should make it as attractive as\r\npossible, and so induce our young men to undergo it at such times as\r\nthey can command a little freedom and can seek the physical development\r\nthey need, for mere health's sake, if for nothing more. Every means by\r\nwhich such things can be stimulated is legitimate, and such a method\r\nsmacks of true American ideas. It is right, too, that the National Guard\r\nof the States should be developed and strengthened by every means which\r\nis not inconsistent with our obligations to our own people or with the\r\nestablished policy of our Government. And this, also, not because the\r\ntime or occasion specially calls for such measures, but because it\r\nshould be our constant policy to make these provisions for our national\r\npeace and safety.\r\n\r\nMore than this carries with it a reversal of the whole history and\r\ncharacter of our polity. More than this, proposed at this time, permit\r\nme to say, would mean merely that we had lost our self-possession, that\r\nwe had been thrown off our balance by a war with which we have nothing\r\nto do, whose causes cannot touch us, whose very existence affords us\r\nopportunities of friendship and disinterested service which should make\r\nus ashamed of any thought of hostility or fearful preparation for\r\ntrouble. This is assuredly the opportunity for which a people and a\r\ngovernment like ours were raised up, the opportunity not only to speak\r\nbut actually to embody and exemplify the counsels of peace and amity and\r\nthe lasting concord which is based on justice and fair and generous\r\ndealing.\r\n\r\nA powerful navy we have always regarded as our proper and natural means\r\nof defense; and it has always been of defense that we have thought,\r\nnever of aggression or of conquest. But who shall tell us now what sort\r\nof a navy to build? We shall take leave to be strong upon the seas, in\r\nthe future as in the past; and there will be no thought of offense or of\r\nprovocation in that. Our ships are our natural bulwarks. When will the\r\nexperts tell us just what kind we should construct--and when will they\r\nbe right for ten years together, if the relative efficiency of craft of\r\ndifferent kinds and uses continues to change as we have seen it change\r\nunder our very eyes in these last few months?\r\n\r\nBut I turn away from the subject. It is not new. There is no new need to\r\ndiscuss it. We shall not alter our attitude toward it because some\r\namongst us are nervous and excited. We shall easily and sensibly agree\r\nupon a policy of defense. The question has not changed its aspect\r\nbecause the times are not normal. Our policy will not be for an\r\noccasion. It will be conceived as a permanent and settled thing, which\r\nwe will pursue at all seasons, without haste and after a fashion\r\nperfectly consistent with the peace of the world, the abiding friendship\r\nof states, and the unhampered freedom of all with whom we deal. Let\r\nthere be no misconception. The country has been misinformed. We have not\r\nbeen negligent of national defense. We are not unmindful of the great\r\nresponsibility resting upon us. We shall learn and profit by the lesson\r\nof every experience and every new circumstance; and what is needed will\r\nbe adequately done.\r\n\r\nI close, as I began, by reminding you of the great tasks and duties of\r\npeace which challenge our best powers and invite us to build what will\r\nlast, the tasks to which we can address ourselves now and at all times\r\nwith free-hearted zest and with all the finest gifts of constructive\r\nwisdom we possess. To develop our life and our resources; to supply our\r\nown people, and the people of the world as their need arises, from the\r\nabundant plenty of our fields and our marts of trade; to enrich the\r\ncommerce of our own States and of the world with the products of our\r\nmines, our farms, and our factories, with the creations of our thought\r\nand the fruits of our character,--this is what will hold our attention\r\nand our enthusiasm steadily, now and in the years to come, as we strive\r\nto show in our life as a nation what liberty and the inspirations of an\r\nemancipated spirit may do for men and for societies, for individuals,\r\nfor states, and for mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MESSAGE\r\n\r\n[Returning to the House of Representatives without approval an act to\r\nregulate the immigration of aliens to and the residence of aliens in the\r\nUnited States.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nIt is with unaffected regret that I find myself constrained by clear\r\nconviction to return this bill (H.R. 6060, \"An act to regulate the\r\nimmigration of aliens to and the residence of aliens in the United\r\nStates\") without my signature. Not only do I feel it to be a very\r\nserious matter to exercise the power of veto in any case, because it\r\ninvolves opposing the single judgment of the President to the judgment\r\nof a majority of both the Houses of the Congress, a step which no man\r\nwho realizes his own liability to error can take without great\r\nhesitation, but also because this particular bill is in so many\r\nimportant respects admirable, well conceived, and desirable. Its\r\nenactment into law would undoubtedly enhance the efficiency and improve\r\nthe methods of handling the important branch of the public service to\r\nwhich it relates. But candor and a sense of duty with regard to the\r\nresponsibility so clearly imposed upon me by the Constitution in matters\r\nof legislation leave me no choice but to dissent.\r\n\r\nIn two particulars of vital consequence this bill embodies a radical\r\ndeparture from the traditional and long-established policy of this\r\ncountry, a policy in which our people have conceived the very character\r\nof their Government to be expressed, the very mission and spirit of the\r\nNation in respect of its relations to the peoples of the world outside\r\ntheir borders. It seeks to all but close entirely the gates of asylum\r\nwhich have always been open to those who could find nowhere else the\r\nright and opportunity of constitutional agitation for what they\r\nconceived to be the natural and inalienable rights of men; and it\r\nexcludes those to whom the opportunities of elementary education have\r\nbeen denied, without regard to their character, their purposes, or their\r\nnatural capacity.\r\n\r\nRestrictions like these, adopted earlier in our history as a Nation,\r\nwould very materially have altered the course and cooled the humane\r\nardors of our politics. The right of political asylum has brought to\r\nthis country many a man of noble character and elevated purpose who was\r\nmarked as an outlaw in his own less fortunate land, and who has yet\r\nbecome an ornament to our citizenship and to our public councils. The\r\nchildren and the compatriots of these illustrious Americans must stand\r\namazed to see the representatives of their Nation now resolved, in the\r\nfullness of our national strength and at the maturity of our great\r\ninstitutions, to risk turning such men back from our shores without test\r\nof quality or purpose. It is difficult for me to believe that the full\r\neffect of this feature of the bill was realized when it was framed and\r\nadopted, and it is impossible for me to assent to it in the form in\r\nwhich it is here cast.\r\n\r\nThe literacy test and the tests and restrictions which accompany it\r\nconstitute an even more radical change in the policy of the Nation.\r\nHitherto we have generously kept our doors open to all who were not\r\nunfitted by reason of disease or incapacity for self-support or such\r\npersonal records and antecedents as were likely to make them a menace to\r\nour peace and order or to the wholesome and essential relationships of\r\nlife. In this bill it is proposed to turn away from tests of character\r\nand of quality and impose tests which exclude and restrict; for the new\r\ntests here embodied are not tests of quality or of character or of\r\npersonal fitness, but tests of opportunity. Those who come seeking\r\nopportunity are not to be admitted unless they have already had one of\r\nthe chief of the opportunities they seek, the opportunity of education.\r\nThe object of such provisions is restriction, not selection.\r\n\r\nIf the people of this country have made up their minds to limit the\r\nnumber of immigrants by arbitrary tests and so reverse the policy of all\r\nthe generations of Americans that have gone before them, it is their\r\nright to do so. I am their servant and have no license to stand in their\r\nway. But I do not believe that they have. I respectfully submit that no\r\none can quote their mandate to that effect. Has any political party ever\r\navowed a policy of restriction in this fundamental matter, gone to the\r\ncountry on it, and been commissioned to control its legislation? Does\r\nthis bill rest upon the conscious and universal assent and desire of the\r\nAmerican people? I doubt it. It is because I doubt it that I make bold\r\nto dissent from it. I am willing to abide by the verdict, but not until\r\nit has been rendered. Let the platforms of parties speak out upon this\r\npolicy and the people pronounce their wish. The matter is too\r\nfundamental to be settled otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have no pride of opinion in this question. I am not foolish enough to\r\nprofess to know the wishes and ideals of America better than the body of\r\nher chosen representatives know them. I only want instruction direct\r\nfrom those whose fortunes, with ours and all men's, are involved.\r\n\r\nWOODROW WILSON.\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE HOUSE, _28 January, 1915_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS BEFORE THE UNITED STATES CHAMBER OF COMMERCE\r\n\r\n[Delivered in Washington, February 3, 1915.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nI feel that it is hardly fair to you for me to come in in this casual\r\nfashion among a body of men who have been seriously discussing great\r\nquestions, and it is hardly fair to me, because I come in cold, not\r\nhaving had the advantage of sharing the atmosphere of your deliberations\r\nand catching the feeling of your conference. Moreover, I hardly know\r\njust how to express my interest in the things you are undertaking. When\r\na man stands outside an organization and speaks to it he is too apt to\r\nhave the tone of outside commendation, as who should say, \"I would\r\ndesire to pat you on the back and say 'Good boys; you are doing well!'\"\r\nI would a great deal rather have you receive me as if for the time being\r\nI were one of your own number.\r\n\r\nBecause the longer I occupy the office that I now occupy the more I\r\nregret any lines of separation; the more I deplore any feeling that one\r\nset of men has one set of interests and another set of men another set\r\nof interests; the more I feel the solidarity of the Nation--the\r\nimpossibility of separating one interest from another without\r\nmisconceiving it; the necessity that we should all understand one\r\nanother, in order that we may understand ourselves.\r\n\r\nThere is an illustration which I have used a great many times. I will\r\nuse it again, because it is the most serviceable to my own mind. We\r\noften speak of a man who cannot find his way in some jungle or some\r\ndesert as having \"lost himself.\" Did you never reflect that that is the\r\nonly thing he has not lost? _He_ is _there_. He has lost the rest of the\r\nworld. He has no fixed point by which to steer. He does not know which\r\nis north, which is south, which is east, which is west; and if he did\r\nknow, he is so confused that he would not know in which of those\r\ndirections his goal lay. Therefore, following his heart, he walks in a\r\ngreat circle from right to left and comes back to where he started--to\r\nhimself again. To my mind that is a picture of the world. If you have\r\nlost sight of other interests and do not know the relation of your own\r\ninterests to those other interests, then you do not understand your own\r\ninterests, and have lost yourself. What you want is orientation,\r\nrelationship to the points of the compass; relationship to the other\r\npeople in the world; vital connections which you have for the time being\r\nsevered.\r\n\r\nI am particularly glad to express my admiration for the kind of\r\norganization which you have drawn together. I have attended banquets of\r\nchambers of commerce in various parts of the country and have got the\r\nimpression at each of those banquets that there was only one city in the\r\ncountry. It has seemed to me that those associations were meant in order\r\nto destroy men's perspective, in order to destroy their sense of\r\nrelative proportions. Worst of all, if I may be permitted to say so,\r\nthey were intended to boost something in particular. Boosting is a very\r\nunhandsome thing. Advancing enterprise is a very handsome thing, but to\r\nexaggerate local merits in order to create disproportion in the general\r\ndevelopment is not a particularly handsome thing or a particularly\r\nintelligent thing. A city cannot grow on the face of a great state like\r\na mushroom on that one spot. Its roots are throughout the state, and\r\nunless the state it is in, or the region it draws from, can itself\r\nthrive and pulse with life as a whole, the city can have no healthy\r\ngrowth. You forget the wide rootages of everything when you boost some\r\nparticular region. There are dangers which probably you all understand\r\nin the mere practice of advertisement. When a man begins to advertise\r\nhimself there are certain points that are somewhat exaggerated, and I\r\nhave noticed that men who exaggerate most, most quickly lose any proper\r\nconception of what their own proportions are. Therefore, these local\r\ncenters of enthusiasm may be local centers of mistake if they are not\r\nvery wisely guided and if they do not themselves realize their relations\r\nto the other centers of enthusiasm and of advancement.\r\n\r\nThe advantage about a Chamber of Commerce of the United States is that\r\nthere is only one way to boost the United States, and that is by seeing\r\nto it that the conditions under which business is done throughout the\r\nwhole country are the best possible conditions. There cannot be any\r\ndisproportion about that. If you draw your sap and your vitality from\r\nall quarters, then the more sap and vitality there is in you the more\r\nthere is in the commonwealth as a whole, and every time you lift at all\r\nyou lift the whole level of manufacturing and mercantile enterprise.\r\nMoreover, the advantage of it is that you cannot boost the United States\r\nin that way without understanding the United States. You learn a great\r\ndeal. I agreed with a colleague of mine in the Cabinet the other day\r\nthat we had never attended in our lives before a school to compare with\r\nthat we were now attending for the purpose of gaining a liberal\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nOf course, I learn a great many things that are not so, but the\r\ninteresting thing about that is this: Things that are not so do not\r\nmatch. If you hear enough of them, you see there is no pattern whatever;\r\nit is a crazy quilt. Whereas, the truth always matches, piece by piece,\r\nwith other parts of the truth. No man can lie consistently, and he\r\ncannot lie about everything if he talks to you long. I would guarantee\r\nthat if enough liars talked to you, you would get the truth; because the\r\nparts that they did not invent would match one another, and the parts\r\nthat they did invent would _not_ match one another. Talk long enough,\r\ntherefore, and see the connections clearly enough, and you can patch\r\ntogether the case as a whole. I had somewhat that experience about\r\nMexico, and that was about the only way in which I learned anything that\r\nwas true about it. For there had been vivid imaginations and many\r\nspecial interests which depicted things as they wished me to believe\r\nthem to be.\r\n\r\nSeriously, the task of this body is to match all the facts of business\r\nthroughout the country and to see the vast and consistent pattern of it.\r\nThat is the reason I think you are to be congratulated upon the fact\r\nthat you cannot do this thing without common counsel. There isn't any\r\nman who knows enough to comprehend the United States. It is cooeperative\r\neffort, necessarily. You cannot perform the functions of this Chamber of\r\nCommerce without drawing in not only a vast number of men, but men, and\r\na number of men, from every region and section of the country. The\r\nminute this association falls into the hands, if it ever should, of men\r\nfrom a single section or men with a single set of interests most at\r\nheart, it will go to seed and die. Its strength must come from the\r\nuttermost parts of the land and must be compounded of brains and\r\ncomprehensions of every sort. It is a very noble and handsome picture\r\nfor the imagination, and I have asked myself before I came here to-day,\r\nwhat relation you could bear to the Government of the United States and\r\nwhat relation the Government could bear to you?\r\n\r\nThere are two aspects and activities of the Government with which you\r\nwill naturally come into most direct contact. The first is the\r\nGovernment's power of inquiry, systematic and disinterested inquiry, and\r\nits power of scientific assistance. You get an illustration of the\r\nlatter, for example, in the Department of Agriculture. Has it occurred\r\nto you, I wonder, that we are just upon the eve of a time when our\r\nDepartment of Agriculture will be of infinite importance to the whole\r\nworld? There is a shortage of food in the world now. That shortage will\r\nbe much more serious a few months from now than it is now. It is\r\nnecessary that we should plant a great deal more; it is necessary that\r\nour lands should yield more per acre than they do now; it is necessary\r\nthat there should not be a plow or a spade idle in this country if the\r\nworld is to be fed. And the methods of our farmers must feed upon the\r\nscientific information to be derived from the State departments of\r\nagriculture, and from that taproot of all, the United States Department\r\nof Agriculture. The object and use of that department is to inform men\r\nof the latest developments and disclosures of science with regard to all\r\nthe processes by which soils can be put to their proper use and their\r\nfertility made the greatest possible. Similarly with the Bureau of\r\nStandards. It is ready to supply those things by which you can set\r\nnorms, you can set bases, for all the scientific processes of business.\r\n\r\nI have a great admiration for the scientific parts of the Government of\r\nthe United States, and it has amazed me that so few men have discovered\r\nthem. Here in these departments are quiet men, trained to the highest\r\ndegree of skill, serving for a petty remuneration along lines that are\r\ninfinitely useful to mankind; and yet in some cases they waited to be\r\ndiscovered until this Chamber of Commerce of the United States was\r\nestablished. Coming to this city, officers of that association found\r\nthat there were here things that were infinitely useful to them and with\r\nwhich the whole United States ought to be put into communication.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States is very properly a great\r\ninstrumentality of inquiry and information. One thing we are just\r\nbeginning to do that we ought to have done long ago: We ought long ago\r\nto have had our Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce. We ought long\r\nago to have sent the best eyes of the Government out into the world to\r\nsee where the opportunities and openings of American commerce and\r\nAmerican genius were to be found--men who were not sent out as the\r\ncommercial agents of any particular set of business men in the United\r\nStates, but who were eyes for the whole business community. I have been\r\nreading consular reports for twenty years. In what I came to regard as\r\nan evil day the Congressman from my district began to send me the\r\nconsular reports, and they ate up more and more of my time. They are\r\nvery interesting, but they are a good deal like what the old lady said\r\nof the dictionary, that it was very interesting but a little\r\ndisconnected. You get a picture of the world as if a spotlight were\r\nbeing dotted about over the surface of it. Here you see a glimpse of\r\nthis, and here you see a glimpse of that, and through the medium of some\r\nconsuls you do not see anything at all. Because the consul has to have\r\neyes and the consul has to know what he is looking for. A literary\r\nfriend of mine said that he used to believe in the maxim that\r\n\"everything comes to the man who waits,\" but he discovered after awhile\r\nby practical experience that it needed an additional clause, \"provided\r\nhe knows what he is waiting for.\" Unless you know what you are looking\r\nfor and have trained eyes to see it when it comes your way, it may pass\r\nyou unnoticed. We are just beginning to do, systematically and\r\nscientifically, what we ought long ago to have done, to employ the\r\nGovernment of the United States to survey the world in order that\r\nAmerican commerce might be guided.\r\n\r\nBut there are other ways of using the Government of the United States,\r\nways that have long been tried, though not always with conspicuous\r\nsuccess or fortunate results. You can use the Government of the United\r\nStates by influencing its legislation. That has been a very active\r\nindustry, but it has not always been managed in the interest of the\r\nwhole people. It is very instructive and useful for the Government of\r\nthe United States to have such means as you are ready to supply for\r\ngetting a sort of consensus of opinion which proceeds from no particular\r\nquarter and originates with no particular interest. Information is the\r\nvery foundation of all right action in legislation.\r\n\r\nI remember once, a good many years ago, I was attending one of the local\r\nchambers of commerce of the United States at a time when everybody was\r\ncomplaining that Congress was interfering with business. If you have\r\nheard that complaint recently and supposed that it was original with the\r\nmen who made it, you have not lived as long as I have. It has been going\r\non ever since I can remember. The complaint came most vigorously from\r\nmen who were interested in large corporate development. I took the\r\nliberty to say to that body of men, whom I did not know, that I took it\r\nfor granted that there were a great many lawyers among them, and that it\r\nwas likely that the more prominent of those lawyers were the intimate\r\nadvisors of the corporations of that region. I said that I had met a\r\ngreat many lawyers from whom the complaint had come most vigorously, not\r\nonly that there was too much legislation with regard to corporations,\r\nbut that it was ignorant legislation. I said, \"Now, the responsibility\r\nis with you. If the legislation is mistaken, you are on the inside and\r\nknow where the mistakes are being made. You know not only the innocent\r\nand right things that your corporations are doing, but you know the\r\nother things, too. Knowing how they are done, you can be expert advisors\r\nas to how the wrong things can be prevented. If, therefore, this thing\r\nis handled ignorantly, there is nobody to blame but yourselves.\" If we\r\non the outside cannot understand the thing and cannot get advice from\r\nthe inside, then we will have to do it with the flat hand and not with\r\nthe touch of skill and discrimination. Isn't that true? Men on the\r\ninside of business know how business is conducted and they cannot\r\ncomplain if men on the outside make mistakes about business if they do\r\nnot come from the inside and give the kind of advice which is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe trouble has been that when they came in the past--for I think the\r\nthing is changing very rapidly--they came with all their bristles out;\r\nthey came on the defensive; they came to see, not what they could\r\naccomplish, but what they could prevent. They did not come to guide;\r\nthey came to block. That is of no use whatever to the general body\r\npolitic. What has got to pervade us like a great motive power is that we\r\ncannot, and must not, separate our interests from one another, but must\r\npool our interests. A man who is trying to fight for his single hand is\r\nfighting against the community and not fighting with it. There are a\r\ngreat many dreadful things about war, as nobody needs to be told in this\r\nday of distress and of terror, but there is one thing about war which\r\nhas a very splendid side, and that is the consciousness that a whole\r\nnation gets that they must all act as a unit for a common end. And when\r\npeace is as handsome as war there will be no war. When men, I mean,\r\nengage in the pursuits of peace in the same spirit of self-sacrifice and\r\nof conscious service of the community with which, at any rate, the\r\ncommon soldier engages in war, then shall there be wars no more. You\r\nhave moved the vanguard for the United States in the purposes of this\r\nassociation just a little nearer that ideal. That is the reason I am\r\nhere, because I believe it.\r\n\r\nThere is a specific matter about which I, for one, want your advice. Let\r\nme say, if I may say it without disrespect, that I do not think you are\r\nprepared to give it right away. You will have to make some rather\r\nextended inquiries before you are ready to give it. What I am thinking\r\nof is competition in foreign markets as between the merchants of\r\ndifferent nations.\r\n\r\nI speak of the subject with a certain degree of hesitation, because the\r\nthing farthest from my thought is taking advantage of nations now\r\ndisabled from playing their full part in that competition, and seeking a\r\nsudden selfish advantage because they are for the time being disabled.\r\nPray believe me that we ought to eliminate all that thought from our\r\nminds and consider this matter as if we and the other nations now at war\r\nwere in the normal circumstances of commerce.\r\n\r\nThere is a normal circumstance of commerce in which we are apparently at\r\na disadvantage. Our anti-trust laws are thought by some to make it\r\nillegal for merchants in the United States to form combinations for the\r\npurpose of strengthening themselves in taking advantage of the\r\nopportunities of foreign trade. That is a very serious matter for this\r\nreason: There are some corporations, and some firms for all I know,\r\nwhose business is great enough and whose resources are abundant enough\r\nto enable them to establish selling agencies in foreign countries; to\r\nenable them to extend the long credits which in some cases are necessary\r\nin order to keep the trade they desire; to enable them, in other words,\r\nto organize their business in foreign territory in a way which the\r\nsmaller man cannot afford to do. His business has not grown big enough\r\nto permit him to establish selling agencies. The export commission\r\nmerchant, perhaps, taxes him a little too highly to make that an\r\navailable competitive means of conducting and extending his business.\r\n\r\nThe question arises, therefore, how are the smaller merchants, how are\r\nthe younger and weaker corporations going to get a foothold as against\r\nthe combinations which are permitted and even encouraged by foreign\r\ngovernments in this field of competition? There are governments which,\r\nas you know, distinctly encourage the formation of great combinations in\r\neach particular field of commerce in order to maintain selling agencies\r\nand to extend long credits, and to use and maintain the machinery which\r\nis necessary for the extension of business; and American merchants feel\r\nthat they are at a very considerable disadvantage in contending against\r\nthat. The matter has been many times brought to my attention, and I have\r\neach time suspended judgment. I want to be shown this: I want to be\r\nshown how such a combination can be made and conducted in a way which\r\nwill not close it against the use of everybody who wants to use it. A\r\ncombination has a tendency to exclude new members. When a group of men\r\nget control of a good thing, they do not see any particular point in\r\nletting other people into the good thing. What I would like very much to\r\nbe shown, therefore, is a method of cooeperation which is not a method of\r\ncombination. Not that the two words are mutually exclusive, but we have\r\ncome to have a special meaning attached to the word \"combination.\" Most\r\nof our combinations have a safety lock, and you have to know the\r\ncombination to get in. I want to know how these cooeperative methods can\r\nbe adopted for the benefit of everybody who wants to use them, and I say\r\nfrankly if I can be shown that, I am for them. If I cannot be shown\r\nthat, I am against them. I hasten to add that I hopefully expect I _can_\r\nbe shown that.\r\n\r\nYou, as I have just now intimated, probably cannot show it to me\r\noffhand, but by the methods which you have the means of using you\r\ncertainly ought to be able to throw a vast deal of light on the subject.\r\nBecause the minute you ask the small merchant, the small banker, the\r\ncountry man, how he looks upon these things and how he thinks they ought\r\nto be arranged in order that he can use them, if he is like some of the\r\nmen in country districts whom I know, he will turn out to have had a\r\ngood deal of thought upon that subject and to be able to make some very\r\ninteresting suggestions whose intelligence and comprehensiveness will\r\nsurprise some city gentlemen who think that only the cities understand\r\nthe business of the country. As a matter of fact, you do not have time\r\nto think in a city. It takes time to think. You can get what you call\r\nopinions by contagion in a city and get them very quickly, but you do\r\nnot always know where the germ came from. And you have no scientific\r\nlaboratory method by which to determine whether it is a good germ or a\r\nbad germ.\r\n\r\nThere are thinking spaces in this country, and some of the thinking done\r\nis very solid thinking indeed, the thinking of the sort of men that we\r\nall love best, who think for themselves, who do not see things as they\r\nare told to see them, but look at them and see them independently; who,\r\nif they are told they are white when they are black, plainly say that\r\nthey are black--men with eyes and with a courage back of those eyes to\r\ntell what they see. The country is full of those men. They have been\r\nsingularly reticent sometimes, singularly silent, but the country is\r\nfull of them. And what I rejoice in is that you have called them into\r\nthe ranks. For your methods are bound to be democratic in spite of you.\r\nI do not mean democratic with a big \"D,\" though I have a private\r\nconviction that you cannot be democratic with a small \"d\" long without\r\nbecoming democratic with a big \"D.\" Still that is just between\r\nourselves. The point is that when we have a _consensus_ of opinion, when\r\nwe have this common counsel, then the legislative processes of this\r\nGovernment will be infinitely illuminated.\r\n\r\nI used to wonder when I was Governor of one of the States of this great\r\ncountry where all the bills came from. Some of them had a very private\r\ncomplexion. I found upon inquiry--it was easy to find--that practically\r\nnine-tenths of the bills that were introduced had been handed to the\r\nmembers who introduced them by some constituent of theirs, had been\r\ndrawn up by some lawyer whom they might or might not know, and were\r\nintended to do something that would be beneficial to a particular set of\r\npersons. I do not mean, necessarily, beneficial in a way that would be\r\nhurtful to the rest; they may have been perfectly honest, but they came\r\nout of cubby-holes all over the State. They did not come out of public\r\nplaces where men had got together and compared views. They were not the\r\nproducts of common counsel, but the products of private counsel, a very\r\nnecessary process if there is no other, but a process which it would be\r\na very happy thing to dispense with if we could get another. And the\r\nonly other process is the process of common counsel.\r\n\r\nSome of the happiest experiences of my life have been like this. We had\r\nonce when I was president of a university to revise the whole course of\r\nstudy.[G] Courses of study are chronically in need of revision. A\r\ncommittee of, I believe, fourteen men was directed by the faculty of the\r\nuniversity to report a revised curriculum. Naturally, the men who had\r\nthe most ideas on the subject were picked out and, naturally, each man\r\ncame with a very definite notion of the kind of revision he wanted, and\r\none of the first discoveries we made was that no two of us wanted\r\nexactly the same revision. I went in there with all my war paint on to\r\nget the revision I wanted, and I dare say, though it was perhaps more\r\nskillfully concealed, the other men had their war paint on, too. We\r\ndiscussed the matter for six months. The result was a report which no\r\none of us had conceived or foreseen, but with which we were all\r\nabsolutely satisfied. There was not a man who had not learned in that\r\ncommittee more than he had ever known before about the subject, and who\r\nhad not willingly revised his prepossessions; who was not proud to be a\r\nparticipant in a genuine piece of common counsel. I have had several\r\nexperiences of that sort, and it has led me, whenever I confer, to hold\r\nmy particular opinion provisionally, as my contribution to go into the\r\nfinal result but not to dominate the final result.\r\n\r\nThat is the ideal of a government like ours, and an interesting thing is\r\nthat if you only talk about an idea that will not work long enough,\r\neverybody will see perfectly plainly that it will not work; whereas, if\r\nyou do not talk about it, and do not have a great many people talk about\r\nit, you are in danger of having the people who handle it think that it\r\nwill work. Many minds are necessary to compound a workable method of\r\nlife in a various and populous country; and as I think about the whole\r\nthing and picture the purposes, the infinitely difficult and complex\r\npurposes which we must conceive and carry out, not only does it\r\nminister to my own modesty, I hope, of opinion, but it also fills me\r\nwith a very great enthusiasm. It is a splendid thing to be part of a\r\ngreat wide-awake Nation. It is a splendid thing to know that your own\r\nstrength is infinitely multiplied by the strength of other men who love\r\nthe country as you do. It is a splendid thing to feel that the wholesome\r\nblood of a great country can be united in common purposes, and that by\r\nfrankly looking one another in the face and taking counsel with one\r\nanother, prejudices will drop away, handsome understandings will arise,\r\na universal spirit of service will be engendered, and that with this\r\nincreased sense of community of purpose will come a vastly enhanced\r\nindividual power of achievement; for we will be lifted by the whole mass\r\nof which we constitute a part.\r\n\r\nHave you never heard a great chorus of trained voices lift the voice of\r\nthe prima donna as if it soared with easy grace above the whole\r\nmelodious sound? It does not seem to come from the single throat that\r\nproduces it. It seems as if it were the perfect accent and crown of the\r\ngreat chorus. So it ought to be with the statesman. So it ought to be\r\nwith every man who tries to guide the counsels of a great nation. He\r\nshould feel that his voice is lifted upon the chorus and that it is only\r\nthe crown of the common theme.\r\n\r\n[G] This was at Princeton, in 1902 and 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO NATURALIZED CITIZENS\r\n\r\n[Address delivered at Convention Hall, Philadelphia, May 10, 1915. The\r\naudience included four thousand newly naturalized citizens. This speech\r\nattracted great attention because in it no reference was made to the\r\nsinking of the \"Lusitania,\" three days before.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. MAYOR, FELLOW-CITIZENS:\r\n\r\nIt warms my heart that you should give me such a reception; but it is\r\nnot of myself that I wish to think to-night, but of those who have just\r\nbecome citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis is the only country in the world which experiences this constant\r\nand repeated rebirth. Other countries depend upon the multiplication of\r\ntheir own native people. This country is constantly drinking strength\r\nout of new sources by the voluntary association with it of great bodies\r\nof strong men and forward-looking women out of other lands. And so by\r\nthe gift of the free will of independent people it is being constantly\r\nrenewed from generation to generation by the same process by which it\r\nwas originally created. It is as if humanity had determined to see to it\r\nthat this great Nation, founded for the benefit of humanity, should not\r\nlack for the allegiance of the people of the world.\r\n\r\nYou have just taken an oath of allegiance to the United States. Of\r\nallegiance to whom? Of allegiance to no one, unless it be God--certainly\r\nnot of allegiance to those who temporarily represent this great\r\nGovernment. You have taken an oath of allegiance to a great ideal, to a\r\ngreat body of principles, to a great hope of the human race. You have\r\nsaid, \"We are going to America not only to earn a living, not only to\r\nseek the things which it was more difficult to obtain where we were\r\nborn, but to help forward the great enterprises of the human spirit--to\r\nlet men know that everywhere in the world there are men who will cross\r\nstrange oceans and go where a speech is spoken which is alien to them if\r\nthey can but satisfy their quest for what their spirits crave; knowing\r\nthat whatever the speech there is but one longing and utterance of the\r\nhuman heart, and that is for liberty and justice.\" And while you bring\r\nall countries with you, you come with a purpose of leaving all other\r\ncountries behind you--bringing what is best of their spirit, but not\r\nlooking over your shoulders and seeking to perpetuate what you intended\r\nto leave behind in them. I certainly would not be one even to suggest\r\nthat a man cease to love the home of his birth and the nation of his\r\norigin--these things are very sacred and ought not to be put out of our\r\nhearts--but it is one thing to love the place where you were born and it\r\nis another thing to dedicate yourself to the place to which you go. You\r\ncannot dedicate yourself to America unless you become in every respect\r\nand with every purpose of your will thorough Americans. You cannot\r\nbecome thorough Americans if you think of yourselves in groups. America\r\ndoes not consist of groups. A man who thinks of himself as belonging to\r\na particular national group in America has not yet become an American,\r\nand the man who goes among you to trade upon your nationality is no\r\nworthy son to live under the Stars and Stripes.\r\n\r\nMy urgent advice to you would be, not only always to think first of\r\nAmerica, but always, also, to think first of humanity. You do not love\r\nhumanity if you seek to divide humanity into jealous camps. Humanity can\r\nbe welded together only by love, by sympathy, by justice, not by\r\njealousy and hatred. I am sorry for the man who seeks to make personal\r\ncapital out of the passions of his fellow-men. He has lost the touch\r\nand ideal of America, for America was created to unite mankind by those\r\npassions which lift and not by the passions which separate and debase.\r\nWe came to America, either ourselves or in the persons of our ancestors,\r\nto better the ideals of men, to make them see finer things than they had\r\nseen before, to get rid of the things that divide and to make sure of\r\nthe things that unite. It was but an historical accident no doubt that\r\nthis great country was called the \"United States\"; yet I am very\r\nthankful that it has that word \"United\" in its title, and the man who\r\nseeks to divide man from man, group from group, interest from interest\r\nin this great Union is striking at its very heart.\r\n\r\nIt is a very interesting circumstance to me, in thinking of those of you\r\nwho have just sworn allegiance to this great Government, that you were\r\ndrawn across the ocean by some beckoning finger of hope, by some belief,\r\nby some vision of a new kind of justice, by some expectation of a better\r\nkind of life. No doubt you have been disappointed in some of us. Some of\r\nus are very disappointing. No doubt you have found that justice in the\r\nUnited States goes only with a pure heart and a right purpose as it does\r\neverywhere else in the world. No doubt what you found here did not seem\r\ntouched for you, after all, with the complete beauty of the ideal which\r\nyou had conceived beforehand. But remember this: If we had grown at all\r\npoor in the ideal, you brought some of it with you. A man does not go\r\nout to seek the thing that is not in him. A man does not hope for the\r\nthing that he does not believe in, and if some of us have forgotten what\r\nAmerica believed in, you, at any rate, imported in your own hearts a\r\nrenewal of the belief. That is the reason that I, for one, make you\r\nwelcome. If I have in any degree forgotten what America was intended\r\nfor, I will thank God if you will remind me. I was born in America. You\r\ndreamed dreams of what America was to be, and I hope you brought the\r\ndreams with you. No man that does not see visions will ever realize any\r\nhigh hope or undertake any high enterprise. Just because you brought\r\ndreams with you, America is more likely to realize dreams such as you\r\nbrought. You are enriching us if you came expecting us to be better than\r\nwe are.\r\n\r\nSee, my friends, what that means. It means that Americans must have a\r\nconsciousness different from the consciousness of every other nation in\r\nthe world. I am not saying this with even the slightest thought of\r\ncriticism of other nations. You know how it is with a family. A family\r\ngets centered on itself if it is not careful and is less interested in\r\nthe neighbors than it is in its own members. So a nation that is not\r\nconstantly renewed out of new sources is apt to have the narrowness and\r\nprejudice of a family; whereas, America must have this consciousness,\r\nthat on all sides it touches elbows and touches hearts with all the\r\nnations of mankind. The example of America must be a special example.\r\nThe example of America must be the example not merely of peace because\r\nit will not fight, but of peace because peace is the healing and\r\nelevating influence of the world and strife is not. There is such a\r\nthing as a man being too proud to fight. There is such a thing as a\r\nnation being so right that it does not need to convince others by force\r\nthat it is right.\r\n\r\nYou have come into this great Nation voluntarily seeking something that\r\nwe have to give, and all that we have to give is this: We cannot exempt\r\nyou from work. No man is exempt from work anywhere in the world. We\r\ncannot exempt you from the strife and the heartbreaking burden of the\r\nstruggle of the day--that is common to mankind everywhere; we cannot\r\nexempt you from the loads that you must carry. We can only make them\r\nlight by the spirit in which they are carried. That is the spirit of\r\nhope, it is the spirit of liberty, it is the spirit of justice.\r\n\r\nWhen I was asked, therefore, by the Mayor and the committee that\r\naccompanied him to come up from Washington to meet this great company of\r\nnewly admitted citizens, I could not decline the invitation. I ought not\r\nto be away from Washington, and yet I feel that it has renewed my spirit\r\nas an American to be here. In Washington men tell you so many things\r\nevery day that are not so, and I like to come and stand in the presence\r\nof a great body of my fellow-citizens, whether they have been\r\nfellow-citizens a long time or a short time, and drink, as it were, out\r\nof the common fountains with them and go back feeling what you have so\r\ngenerously given me--the sense of your support and of the living\r\nvitality in your hearts of the great ideals which have made America the\r\nhope of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT MILWAUKEE\r\n\r\n[Between January 27 and February 3, 1916, President Wilson made a series\r\nof speeches in New York, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Chicago, Des\r\nMoines, Topeka, Kansas City, and St. Louis. The address made at\r\nMilwaukee, on January 31, has been chosen as representing the general\r\ntenor and spirit of the whole series.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CHAIRMAN AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:\r\n\r\nI need not inquire whether the citizens of Milwaukee and Wisconsin are\r\ninterested in the subject of my errand. The presence of this great body\r\nin this vast hall sufficiently attests your interest, but I want at the\r\noutset to remove a misapprehension that I fear may exist in your mind.\r\nThere is no sudden crisis; nothing new has happened; I am not out upon\r\nthis errand because of any unexpected situation. I have come to confer\r\nwith you upon a matter upon which it would, in any circumstances, be\r\nnecessary for us to confer when all the rest of the world is on fire and\r\nour own house is not fireproof. Everywhere the atmosphere of the world\r\nis thrilling with the passion of a disturbance such as the world has\r\nnever seen before, and it is wise, in the words just uttered by your\r\nchairman, that we should see that our own house is set in order and that\r\neverything is done to make certain that we shall not suffer by the\r\ngeneral conflagration.\r\n\r\nThere were some dangers to which this Nation seemed at the outset of the\r\nwar to be exposed, which, I think I can say with confidence, are now\r\npassed and overcome. America has drawn her blood and her strength out of\r\nalmost all the nations of the world. It is true of a great many of us\r\nthat there lies deep in our hearts the recollection of an origin which\r\nis not American. We are aware that our roots, our traditions, run back\r\ninto other national soils. There are songs that stir us; there are some\r\nfar-away historical recollections which engage our affections and stir\r\nour memories. We cannot forget our forbears; we cannot altogether ignore\r\nthe fact of our essential blood relationship; and at the outset of this\r\nwar it did look as if there were a division of domestic sentiment which\r\nmight lead us to some errors of judgment and some errors of action; but\r\nI, for one, believe that that danger is passed. I never doubted that the\r\ndanger was exaggerated, because I had learned long ago, and many of you\r\nwill corroborate me by your experience, that it is not the men who are\r\ndoing the talking always who represent the real sentiments of the\r\nNation. I for my part always feel a serene confidence in waiting for the\r\ndeclaration of the principles and sentiments of the men who are not\r\nvociferous, do not go about seeking to make trouble, do their own\r\nthinking, attend to their own business, and love their own country.\r\n\r\nI have at no time supposed that the men whose voices seemed to contain\r\nthe threat of division amongst us were really uttering the sentiments\r\neven of those whom they pretended to represent. I for my part have no\r\njealousy of family sentiment. I have no jealousy of that deep affection\r\nwhich runs back through long lineage. It would be a pity if we forget\r\nthe fine things that our ancestors have done. But I also know the magic\r\nof America; I also know the great principles which thrill men in the\r\nsingular body politic to which we belong in the United States. I know\r\nthe impulses which have drawn men to our shores. They have not come\r\nidly; they have not come without conscious purpose to be free; they have\r\nnot come without voluntary desire to unite themselves with the great\r\nnation on this side of the sea; and I know that whenever the test comes\r\nevery man's heart will be first for America. It was principle and\r\naffection and ambition and hope that drew men to these shores, and they\r\nare not going to forget the errand upon which they came and allow\r\nAmerica, the home of their refuge and hope, to suffer by any\r\nforgetfulness on their part. And so the trouble makers have shot their\r\nbolt, and it has been ineffectual. Some of them have been vociferous;\r\nall of them have been exceedingly irresponsible. Talk was cheap, and\r\nthat was all it cost them. They did not have to do anything. But you\r\nwill know without my telling you that the man whom for the time being\r\nyou have charged with the duties of President of the United States must\r\ntalk with a deep sense of responsibility, and he must remember, above\r\nall things else, the fine traditions of his office which some men seem\r\nto have forgotten. There is no precedent in American history for any\r\naction of aggression on the part of the United States or for any action\r\nwhich might mean that America is seeking to connect herself with the\r\ncontroversies on the other side of the water. Men who seek to provoke us\r\nto such action have forgotten the traditions of the United States, but\r\nit behooves those with whom you have entrusted office to remember the\r\ntraditions of the United States and to see to it that the actions of the\r\nGovernment are made to square with those traditions.\r\n\r\nBut there are other dangers, my fellow-citizens, which are not past and\r\nwhich have not been overcome, and they are dangers which we cannot\r\ncontrol. We can control irresponsible talkers amidst ourselves. All we\r\nhave got to do is to encourage them to hire a hall and their folly will\r\nbe abundantly advertised by themselves. But we cannot in this simple\r\nfashion control the dangers that surround us now and have surrounded us\r\nsince this titanic struggle on the other side of the water began. I say\r\non the other side of the water; you will ask me, \"On the other side of\r\nwhich water,\" for this great struggle has extended to all quarters of\r\nthe globe. There is no continent outside, I was about to say, of this\r\nWestern Hemisphere which is not touched with it, but I recollected as I\r\nbegan the sentence that a part of our own continent was touched with it,\r\nbecause it involves our neighbors to the north in Canada. There is no\r\npart of the world, except South America, to which the direct influences\r\nof this struggle have not extended, so that now we are completely\r\nsurrounded by this tremendous disturbance and you must realize what that\r\ninvolves.\r\n\r\nOur thoughts are concentrated upon our own affairs and our own relations\r\nto the rest of the world, but the thoughts of the men who are engaged in\r\nthis struggle are concentrated upon the struggle itself, and there is\r\ndaily and hourly danger that they will feel themselves constrained to do\r\nthings which are absolutely inconsistent with the rights of the United\r\nStates. They are not thinking of us. I am not criticising them for not\r\nthinking of us. I dare say if I were in their place neither would I\r\nthink of us. They believe that they are struggling for the lives and\r\nhonor of their nations, and that if the United States puts its interests\r\nin the path of this great struggle, she ought to know beforehand that\r\nthere is danger of very serious misunderstanding and difficulty. So that\r\nthe very uncalculating, unpremeditated, one might almost say accidental,\r\ncourse of affairs may touch us to the quick at any moment, and I want\r\nyou to realize that, standing in the midst of these difficulties, I feel\r\nthat I am charged with a double duty of the utmost difficulty. In the\r\nfirst place, I know that you are depending upon me to keep this Nation\r\nout of the war. So far I have done so, and I pledge you my word that,\r\nGod helping me, I will if it is possible. But you have laid another duty\r\nupon me. You have bidden me to see it that nothing stains or impairs\r\nthe honor of the United States, and that is a matter not within my\r\ncontrol; that depends upon what others do, not upon what the Government\r\nof the United States does. Therefore there may at any moment come a time\r\nwhen I cannot preserve both the honor and the peace of the United\r\nStates. Do not exact of me an impossible and contradictory thing, but\r\nstand ready and insistent that everybody who represents you should stand\r\nready to provide the necessary means for maintaining the honor of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nI sometimes think that it is true that no people ever went to war with\r\nanother people. Governments have gone to war with one another. Peoples,\r\nso far as I remember, have not, and this is a government of the people,\r\nand this people is not going to choose war. But we are not dealing with\r\npeople; we are dealing with Governments. We are dealing with Governments\r\nnow engaged in a great struggle, and therefore we do not know what a day\r\nor an hour will bring forth. All that we know is the character of our\r\nown duty. We do not want the question of peace and war, or the conduct\r\nof war, entrusted too entirely to our Government. We want war, if it\r\nmust come, to be something that springs out of the sentiments and\r\nprinciples and actions of the people themselves; and it is on that\r\naccount that I am counseling the Congress of the United States not to\r\ntake the advice of those who recommend that we should have, and have\r\nvery soon, a great standing Army, but, on the contrary, to see to it\r\nthat the citizens of this country are so trained and that the military\r\nequipment is so sufficiently provided for them that when they choose\r\nthey can take up arms and defend themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States makes the President the Commander\r\nin Chief of the Army and Navy of the Nation, but I do not want a big\r\nArmy subject to my personal command. If danger comes, I want to turn to\r\nyou and the rest of my fellow-countrymen and say, \"Men, are you ready?\"\r\nand I know what the response will be. I know that there will spring up\r\nout of the body of the Nation a great host of free men, and I want those\r\nmen not to be mere targets for shot and shell. I want them to know\r\nsomething of the arms they have in their hands. I want them to know\r\nsomething about how to guard against the diseases that creep into camps,\r\nwhere men are unaccustomed to live. I want them to know something of\r\nwhat the orders mean that they will be under when they enlist under arms\r\nfor the Government of the United States. I want them to be men who can\r\ncomprehend and easily and intelligently step into the duty of national\r\ndefense. That is the reason that I am urging upon the Congress of the\r\nUnited States at any rate the beginnings of a system by which we may\r\ngive a very considerable body of our fellow-citizens the necessary\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\nI have not forgotten the great National Guard of this country, but in\r\nthis country of 100,000,000 people there are only 129,000 men in the\r\nNational Guard; and the National Guard, fine as it is, is not subject to\r\nthe orders of the President of the United States. It is subject to the\r\norders of the Governors of the several States, and the Constitution\r\nitself says that the President has no right to withdraw them from their\r\nStates even, except in the case of actual invasion of the soil of the\r\nUnited States. I want the Congress of the United States to do a great\r\ndeal for the National Guard, but I do not see how the Congress of the\r\nUnited States can put the National Guard at the disposal of the national\r\nauthorities. Therefore it seems to me absolutely necessary that in\r\naddition to the National Guard there should be a considerable body of\r\nmen with some training in the military art who will have pledged\r\nthemselves to come at the call of the Nation.\r\n\r\nI have been told by those who have a greater knack at guessing\r\nstatistics than I have that there are probably several million men in\r\nthe United States who, either in this country or in other countries from\r\nwhich they have come to the United States, have received training in\r\narms. It may be; I do not know, and I suspect that they do not either,\r\nbut even if it be true, these men are not subject to the call of the\r\nFederal Government. They would have to be found; they would have to be\r\ninduced to enlist; they would have to be organized; their numbers are\r\nindefinite; and they would have to be equipped. Such are not the\r\nmaterials which we need. We want to know who these men are and where\r\nthey are and to have everything ready for them if they should come to\r\nour assistance. For we have now got down, not to the sentiment of\r\nnational defense, but to the business of national defense. It is a\r\nbusiness proposition and it must be treated as such. And there are\r\nabundant precedents for the proposals which have been made to the\r\nCongress. Even that arch-Democrat, Thomas Jefferson, believed that there\r\nought to be compulsory military training for the adult men of the\r\nNation, because he believed, as every true believer in democracy\r\nbelieves, that it is upon the voluntary action of the men of a great\r\nNation like this that it must depend for its military force.\r\n\r\nThere is another misapprehension that I want to remove from your minds:\r\nDo not think that I have come to talk to you about these things because\r\nI doubt whether they are going to be done or not. I do not doubt it for\r\na moment, but I believe that when great things of this sort are going to\r\nbe done the people of this country are entitled to know just what is\r\nbeing proposed. As a friend of mine says, I am not arguing with you; I\r\nam telling you. I am not trying to convert you to anything, because I\r\nknow that in your hearts you are converted already, but I want you to\r\nknow the motives of what is proposed and the character of what is\r\nproposed, in order that we should have only one attitude and counsel\r\nwith regard to this great matter.\r\n\r\nIt is being very sedulously spread abroad in this country that the\r\nimpulse back of all this is the desire of men who make the materials of\r\nwarfare to get money out of the Treasury of the United States. I wish\r\nthe people that say that could see meetings like this. Did you come here\r\nfor that purpose? Did you come here because you are interested to see\r\nsome of your fellow-citizens make money out of the present situation? Of\r\ncourse you did not. I am ready to admit that probably the equipment of\r\nthose men whom we are training will have to be bought from somebody, and\r\nI know that if the equipment is bought, it will have to be paid for; and\r\nI dare say somebody will make some money out of it. It is also true,\r\nladies and gentlemen, that there are men now, a great many men, in the\r\nbelligerent countries who are growing rich out of the sale of the\r\nmaterials needed by the armies of those countries. If the Government\r\nitself does not manufacture everything that an army needs, somebody has\r\ngot to make money out of it, and I for my part have been urging the\r\nCongress of the United States to make the necessary preparations by\r\nwhich the Government can manufacture armor plate and munitions, so that,\r\nbeing in the business itself and having the ability to manufacture all\r\nit needs, if it is put upon a business basis, it can at any rate keep\r\nthe price that it pays within moderate and reasonable limits. The\r\nGovernment of the United States is not going to be imposed upon by\r\nanybody, and you may rest assured, therefore, that while I believe you\r\nprefer that private capital and private initiative should bestir\r\nthemselves in these matters, it is also possible, and I assure you that\r\nit is most likely, that the Government of the United States will have\r\nadequate means of controlling this matter very thoroughly indeed. There\r\nneed be no fear on that side. Let nobody suppose that this is a\r\nmoney-making agitation. I would for one be ashamed to be such a dupe as\r\nto be engaged in it if it had any suspicion of that about it, but I am\r\nnot as innocent as I look; and I believe that I can say for my\r\ncolleagues in Washington that they are just as watchful in such matters\r\nas you would desire them to be.\r\n\r\nAnd there is another misapprehension that I do not wish you to\r\nentertain. Do not suppose that there is any new or sudden or recent\r\ninadequacy on the part of this Government in respect of preparation for\r\nnational defense. I have heard some gentlemen say that we had no coast\r\ndefenses worth talking about. Coast defenses are not nowadays\r\nadvertised, you understand, and they are not visible to the naked eye,\r\nso that if you passed them and nothing exploded, you would not know they\r\nwere there. The coast defenses of the United States, while not numerous\r\nenough, are equipped in the most modern and efficient fashion. You are\r\ntold that there has been some sort of neglect about the Navy. There has\r\nnot been any sort of neglect about the Navy. We have been slowly\r\nbuilding up a Navy which in quality is second to no navy in the world.\r\nThe only thing it lacks is quantity. In size it is the fourth navy in\r\nthe world, though I have heard it said by some gentlemen in this very\r\nregion that it was the second. In fighting force, though not in quality,\r\nit is reckoned by experts to be the fourth in rank in the world; and yet\r\nwhen I go on board those ships and see their equipment and talk with\r\ntheir officers I suspect that they could give an account of themselves\r\nwhich would raise them above the fourth class. It reminds me of that\r\nvery quaint saying of the old darky preacher, \"The Lord says unto Moses,\r\ncome fourth, and he came fifth and lost the race.\" But I think this Navy\r\nwould not come fourth in the race, but higher.\r\n\r\nWhat we are proposing now is not the sudden creation of a Navy, for we\r\nhave a splendid Navy, but the definite working out of a program by which\r\nwithin five years we shall bring the Navy to a fighting strength which\r\notherwise might have taken eight or ten years; along exactly the same\r\nlines of development that have been followed and followed diligently and\r\nintelligently for at least a decade past. There is no sudden panic,\r\nthere is no sudden change of plan; all that has happened is that we now\r\nsee that we ought more rapidly and more thoroughly than ever before to\r\ndo the things which have always been characteristic of America. For she\r\nhas always been proud of her Navy and has always been addicted to the\r\nprinciple that her citizenship must do the fighting on land. We are\r\nworking out American principle a little faster, because American pulses\r\nare beating a little faster, because the world is in a whirl, because\r\nthere are incalculable elements of trouble abroad which we cannot\r\ncontrol or alter. I would be derelict to the duty which you have laid\r\nupon me if I did not tell you that it was absolutely necessary to carry\r\nout our principles in this matter now and at once.\r\n\r\nAnd yet all the time, my fellow-citizens, I believe that in these things\r\nwe are merely interpreting the spirit of America. Who shall say what the\r\nspirit of America is? I have many times heard orators apostrophize this\r\nbeautiful flag which is the emblem of the Nation. I have many times\r\nheard orators and philosophers speak of the spirit which was resident in\r\nAmerica. I have always for my own part felt that it was an act of\r\naudacity to attempt to characterize anything of that kind, and when I\r\nhave been outside of the country in foreign lands and have been asked if\r\nthis, that, or the other was true of America I have habitually said,\r\n\"Nothing stated in general terms is true of America, because it is the\r\nmost variegated and varied and multiform land under the sun.\" Yet I know\r\nthat if you turn away from the physical aspects of the country, if you\r\nturn away from the variety of the strains of blood that make up our\r\ngreat population, if you turn away from the great variations of\r\noccupation and of interest among our fellow-citizens, there is a\r\nspiritual unity in America. I know that there are some things which stir\r\nevery heart in America, no matter what the racial derivation or the\r\nlocal environment, and one of the things that stirs every American is\r\nthe love of individual liberty. We do not stand for occupations. We do\r\nnot stand for material interests. We do not stand for any narrow\r\nconception even of political institutions; but we do stand for this,\r\nthat we are banded together in America to see to it that no man shall\r\nserve any master who is not of his own choosing. And we have been very\r\nliberal and generous about this idea. We have seen great peoples, for\r\nthe most part not of the same blood with ourselves, to the south of us\r\nbuild up polities in which this same idea pulsed and was regnant, this\r\nidea of free institutions and individual liberty, and when we have seen\r\nhands reached across the water from older political polities to\r\ninterfere with the development of free institutions on the Western\r\nHemisphere we have said: \"No; we are the champions of the freedom of\r\npopular sovereignty wherever it displays or exercises itself throughout\r\nboth Americas.\" We are the champions of a particular sort of freedom,\r\nthe sort of freedom which is the only foundation and guarantee of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nPeace lies in the hearts of great industrial and agricultural\r\npopulations, and we have arranged a government on this side of the water\r\nby which their preferences and their predilections and their interests\r\nare the mainsprings of government itself. And so when we prepare for\r\nnational defense we prepare for national political integrity; we prepare\r\nto take care of the great ideals which gave birth to this Government; we\r\nare going back in spirit and in energy to those great first generations\r\nin America, when men banded themselves together, though they were but a\r\nhandful upon a single coast of the Atlantic, to set up in the world the\r\nstandards which have ever since floated everywhere that Americans\r\nasserted the power of their Government. As I came along the line of the\r\nrailway to-day, I was touched to observe that everywhere, upon every\r\nrailway station, upon every house, where a flag could be procured, some\r\ntemporary standard had been raised from which there floated the stars\r\nand stripes. They seemed to have divined the errand upon which I had\r\ncome, to remind you that we must subordinate every individual interest\r\nand every local interest to assert once more, if it should be necessary\r\nto assert them, the great principles for which that flag stands.\r\n\r\nDo not deceive yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, as to where the colors\r\nof that flag came from. Those lines of red are lines of blood, nobly and\r\nunselfishly shed by men who loved the liberty of their fellow-men more\r\nthan they loved their own lives and fortunes. God forbid that we should\r\nhave to use the blood of America to freshen the color of that flag; but\r\nif it should ever be necessary again to assert the majesty and integrity\r\nof those ancient and honorable principles, that flag will be colored\r\nonce more, and in being colored will be glorified and purified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUBMARINE QUESTION\r\n\r\n[Address delivered at a joint session of the two Houses of Congress,\r\nApril 19, 1916.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nA situation has arisen in the foreign relations of the country of which\r\nit is my plain duty to inform you very frankly.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that in February, 1915, the Imperial German\r\nGovernment announced its intention to treat the waters surrounding Great\r\nBritain and Ireland as embraced within the seat of war and to destroy\r\nall merchant ships owned by its enemies that might be found within any\r\npart of that portion of the high seas, and that it warned all vessels,\r\nof neutral as well as of belligerent ownership, to keep out of the\r\nwaters it had thus proscribed or else enter them at their peril. The\r\nGovernment of the United States earnestly protested. It took the\r\nposition that such a policy could not be pursued without the practical\r\ncertainty of gross and palpable violations of the law of nations,\r\nparticularly if submarine craft were to be employed as its instruments,\r\ninasmuch as the rules prescribed by that law, rules founded upon\r\nprinciples of humanity and established for the protection of the lives\r\nof non-combatants at sea, could not in the nature of the case be\r\nobserved by such vessels. It based its protest on the ground that\r\npersons of neutral nationality and vessels of neutral ownership would be\r\nexposed to extreme and intolerable risks, and that no right to close any\r\npart of the high seas against their use or to expose them to such risks\r\ncould lawfully be asserted by any belligerent government. The law of\r\nnations in these matters, upon which the Government of the United States\r\nbased its protest, is not of recent origin or founded upon merely\r\narbitrary principles set up by convention. It is based, on the contrary,\r\nupon manifest and imperative principles of humanity and has long been\r\nestablished with the approval and by the express assent of all civilized\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the earnest protest of our Government, the Imperial\r\nGerman Government at once proceeded to carry out the policy it had\r\nannounced. It expressed the hope that the dangers involved, at any rate\r\nthe dangers to neutral vessels, would be reduced to a minimum by the\r\ninstructions which it had issued to its submarine commanders, and\r\nassured the Government of the United States that it would take every\r\npossible precaution both to respect the rights of neutrals and to\r\nsafeguard the lives of non-combatants.\r\n\r\nWhat has actually happened in the year which has since elapsed has shown\r\nthat those hopes were not justified, those assurances insusceptible of\r\nbeing fulfilled. In pursuance of the policy of submarine warfare against\r\nthe commerce of its adversaries, thus announced and entered upon by the\r\nImperial German Government in despite of the solemn protest of this\r\nGovernment, the commanders of German undersea vessels have attacked\r\nmerchant ships with greater and greater activity, not only upon the high\r\nseas surrounding Great Britain and Ireland but wherever they could\r\nencounter them, in a way that has grown more and more ruthless, more and\r\nmore indiscriminate as the months have gone by, less and less observant\r\nof restraints of any kind; and have delivered their attacks without\r\ncompunction against vessels of every nationality and bound upon every\r\nsort of errand. Vessels of neutral ownership, even vessels of neutral\r\nownership bound from neutral port to neutral port, have been destroyed\r\nalong with vessels of belligerent ownership in constantly increasing\r\nnumbers. Sometimes the merchantman attacked has been warned and summoned\r\nto surrender before being fired on or torpedoed; sometimes passengers or\r\ncrews have been vouchsafed the poor security of being allowed to take to\r\nthe ship's boats before she was sent to the bottom. But again and again\r\nno warning has been given, no escape even to the ship's boats allowed to\r\nthose on board. What this Government foresaw must happen has happened.\r\nTragedy has followed tragedy on the seas in such fashion, with such\r\nattendant circumstances, as to make it grossly evident that warfare of\r\nsuch a sort, if warfare it be, cannot be carried on without the most\r\npalpable violation of the dictates alike of right and of humanity.\r\nWhatever the disposition and intention of the Imperial German\r\nGovernment, it has manifestly proved impossible for it to keep such\r\nmethods of attack upon the commerce of its enemies within the bounds set\r\nby either the reason or the heart of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn February of the present year the Imperial German Government informed\r\nthis Government and the other neutral governments of the world that it\r\nhad reason to believe that the Government of Great Britain had armed all\r\nmerchant vessels of British ownership and had given them secret orders\r\nto attack any submarine of the enemy they might encounter upon the seas,\r\nand that the Imperial German Government felt justified in the\r\ncircumstances in treating all armed merchantmen of belligerent ownership\r\nas auxiliary vessels of war, which it would have the right to destroy\r\nwithout warning. The law of nations has long recognized the right of\r\nmerchantmen to carry arms for protection and to use them to repel\r\nattack, though to use them, in such circumstances, at their own risk;\r\nbut the Imperial German Government claimed the right to set these\r\nunderstandings aside in circumstances which it deemed extraordinary.\r\nEven the terms in which it announced its purpose thus still further to\r\nrelax the restraints it had previously professed its willingness and\r\ndesire to put upon the operations of its submarines carried the plain\r\nimplication that at least vessels which were not armed would still be\r\nexempt from destruction without warning and that personal safety would\r\nbe accorded their passengers and crews; but even that limitation, if it\r\nwas ever practicable to observe it, has in fact constituted no check at\r\nall upon the destruction of ships of every sort.\r\n\r\nAgain and again the Imperial German Government has given this Government\r\nits solemn assurances that at least passenger ships would not be thus\r\ndealt with, and yet it has again and again permitted its undersea\r\ncommanders to disregard those assurances with entire impunity. Great\r\nliners like the _Lusitania_ and the _Arabic_ and mere ferryboats like\r\nthe _Sussex_ have been attacked without a moment's warning, sometimes\r\nbefore they had even become aware that they were in the presence of an\r\narmed vessel of the enemy, and the lives of non-combatants, passengers\r\nand crew, have been sacrificed wholesale, in a manner which the\r\nGovernment of the United States cannot but regard as wanton and without\r\nthe slightest color of justification. No limit of any kind has in fact\r\nbeen set to the indiscriminate pursuit and destruction of merchantmen of\r\nall kinds and nationalities within the waters, constantly extending in\r\narea, where these operations have been carried on; and the roll of\r\nAmericans who have lost their lives on ships thus attacked and destroyed\r\nhas grown month by month until the ominous toll has mounted into the\r\nhundreds.\r\n\r\nOne of the latest and most shocking instances of this method of warfare\r\nwas that of the destruction of the French cross-Channel steamer\r\n_Sussex_. It must stand forth, as the sinking of the steamer _Lusitania_\r\ndid, as so singularly tragical and unjustifiable as to constitute a\r\ntruly terrible example of the inhumanity of submarine warfare as the\r\ncommanders of German vessels have for the past twelvemonth been\r\nconducting it. If this instance stood alone, some explanation, some\r\ndisavowal by the German Government, some evidence of criminal mistake or\r\nwilful disobedience on the part of the commander of the vessel that\r\nfired the torpedo might be sought or entertained; but unhappily it does\r\nnot stand alone. Recent events make the conclusion inevitable that it is\r\nonly one instance, even though it be one of the most extreme and\r\ndistressing instances, of the spirit and method of warfare which the\r\nImperial German Government has mistakenly adopted, and which from the\r\nfirst exposed that Government to the reproach of thrusting all neutral\r\nrights aside in pursuit of its immediate objects.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States has been very patient. At every\r\nstage of this distressing experience of tragedy after tragedy in which\r\nits own citizens were involved it has sought to be restrained from any\r\nextreme course of action or of protest by a thoughtful consideration of\r\nthe extraordinary circumstances of this unprecedented war, and actuated\r\nin all that it said or did by the sentiments of genuine friendship which\r\nthe people of the United States have always entertained and continue to\r\nentertain towards the German nation. It has of course accepted the\r\nsuccessive explanations and assurances of the Imperial German Government\r\nas given in entire sincerity and good faith, and has hoped, even against\r\nhope, that it would prove to be possible for the German Government so to\r\norder and control the acts of its naval commanders as to square its\r\npolicy with the principles of humanity as embodied in the law of\r\nnations. It has been willing to wait until the significance of the facts\r\nbecame absolutely unmistakable and susceptible of but one\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\nThat point has now unhappily been reached. The facts are susceptible of\r\nbut one interpretation. The Imperial German Government has been unable\r\nto put any limits or restraints upon its warfare against either freight\r\nor passenger ships. It has therefore become painfully evident that the\r\nposition which this Government took at the very outset is inevitable,\r\nnamely, that the use of submarines for the destruction of an enemy's\r\ncommerce is of necessity, because of the very character of the vessels\r\nemployed and the very methods of attack which their employment of course\r\ninvolves, incompatible with the principles of humanity, the long\r\nestablished and incontrovertible rights of neutrals, and the sacred\r\nimmunities of non-combatants.\r\n\r\nI have deemed it my duty, therefore, to say to the Imperial German\r\nGovernment that if it is still its purpose to prosecute relentless and\r\nindiscriminate warfare against vessels of commerce by the use of\r\nsubmarines, notwithstanding the now demonstrated impossibility of\r\nconducting that warfare in accordance with what the Government of the\r\nUnited States must consider the sacred and indisputable rules of\r\ninternational law and the universally recognized dictates of humanity,\r\nthe Government of the United States is at last forced to the conclusion\r\nthat there is but one course it can pursue; and that unless the Imperial\r\nGerman Government should now immediately declare and effect an\r\nabandonment of its present methods of warfare against passenger and\r\nfreight carrying vessels this Government can have no choice but to sever\r\ndiplomatic relations with the Government of the German Empire\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nThis decision I have arrived at with the keenest regret; the possibility\r\nof the action contemplated I am sure all thoughtful Americans will look\r\nforward to with unaffected reluctance. But we cannot forget that we are\r\nin some sort and by the force of circumstances the responsible spokesmen\r\nof the rights of humanity, and that we cannot remain silent while those\r\nrights seem in process of being swept utterly away in the maelstrom of\r\nthis terrible war. We owe it to a due regard for our own rights as a\r\nnation, to our sense of duty as a representative of the rights of\r\nneutrals the world over, and to a just conception of the rights of\r\nmankind to take this stand now with the utmost solemnity and firmness.\r\n\r\nI have taken it, and taken it in the confidence that it will meet with\r\nyour approval and support. All sober-minded men must unite in hoping\r\nthat the Imperial German Government, which has in other circumstances\r\nstood as the champion of all that we are now contending for in the\r\ninterest of humanity, may recognize the justice of our demands and meet\r\nthem in the spirit in which they are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN PRINCIPLES\r\n\r\n[Address delivered at the First Annual Assemblage of the League to\r\nEnforce Peace, May 27, 1916.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the invitation to be here to-night came to me, I was glad to accept\r\nit,--not because it offered me an opportunity to discuss the program of\r\nthe League,--that you will, I am sure, not expect of me,--but because\r\nthe desire of the whole world now turns eagerly, more and more eagerly,\r\ntowards the hope of peace, and there is just reason why we should take\r\nour part in counsel upon this great theme. It is right that I, as\r\nspokesman of our Government, should attempt to give expression to what I\r\nbelieve to be the thought and purpose of the people of the United States\r\nin this vital matter.\r\n\r\nThis great war that broke so suddenly upon the world two years ago, and\r\nwhich has swept within its flame so great a part of the civilized world,\r\nhas affected us very profoundly, and we are not only at liberty, it is\r\nperhaps our duty, to speak very frankly of it and of the great interests\r\nof civilization which it affects.\r\n\r\nWith its causes and its objects we are not concerned. The obscure\r\nfountains from which its stupendous flood has burst forth we are not\r\ninterested to search for or explore. But so great a flood, spread far\r\nand wide to every quarter of the globe, has of necessity engulfed many a\r\nfair province of right that lies very near to us. Our own rights as a\r\nNation, the liberties, the privileges, and the property of our people\r\nhave been profoundly affected. We are not mere disconnected lookers-on.\r\nThe longer the war lasts, the more deeply do we become concerned that\r\nit should be brought to an end and the world be permitted to resume its\r\nnormal life and course again. And when it does come to an end we shall\r\nbe as much concerned as the nations at war to see peace assume an aspect\r\nof permanence, give promise of days from which the anxiety of\r\nuncertainty shall be lifted, bring some assurance that peace and war\r\nshall always hereafter be reckoned part of the common interest of\r\nmankind. We are participants, whether we would or not, in the life of\r\nthe world. The interests of all nations are our own also. We are\r\npartners with the rest. What affects mankind is inevitably our affair as\r\nwell as the affair of the nations of Europe and of Asia.\r\n\r\nOne observation on the causes of the present war we are at liberty to\r\nmake, and to make it may throw some light forward upon the future, as\r\nwell as backward upon the past. It is plain that this war could have\r\ncome only as it did, suddenly and out of secret counsels, without\r\nwarning to the world, without discussion, without any of the deliberate\r\nmovements of counsel with which it would seem natural to approach so\r\nstupendous a contest. It is probable that if it had been foreseen just\r\nwhat would happen, just what alliances would be formed, just what forces\r\narrayed against one another, those who brought the great contest on\r\nwould have been glad to substitute conference for force. If we ourselves\r\nhad been afforded some opportunity to apprise the belligerents of the\r\nattitude which it would be our duty to take, of the policies and\r\npractices against which we would feel bound to use all our moral and\r\neconomic strength, and in certain circumstances even our physical\r\nstrength also, our own contribution to the counsel which might have\r\naverted the struggle would have been considered worth weighing and\r\nregarding.\r\n\r\nAnd the lesson which the shock of being taken by surprise in a matter so\r\ndeeply vital to all the nations of the world has made poignantly clear\r\nis, that the peace of the world must henceforth depend upon a new and\r\nmore wholesome diplomacy. Only when the great nations of the world have\r\nreached some sort of agreement as to what they hold to be fundamental to\r\ntheir common interest, and as to some feasible method of acting in\r\nconcert when any nation or group of nations seeks to disturb those\r\nfundamental things, can we feel that civilization is at last in a way of\r\njustifying its existence and claiming to be finally established. It is\r\nclear that nations must in the future be governed by the same high code\r\nof honor that we demand of individuals.\r\n\r\nWe must, indeed, in the very same breath with which we avow this\r\nconviction admit that we have ourselves upon occasion in the past been\r\noffenders against the law of diplomacy which we thus forecast; but our\r\nconviction is not the less clear, but rather the more clear, on that\r\naccount. If this war has accomplished nothing else for the benefit of\r\nthe world, it has at least disclosed a great moral necessity and set\r\nforward the thinking of the statesmen of the world by a whole age.\r\nRepeated utterances of the leading statesmen of most of the great\r\nnations now engaged in war have made it plain that their thought has\r\ncome to this, that the principle of public right must henceforth take\r\nprecedence over the individual interests of particular nations, and that\r\nthe nations of the world must in some way band themselves together to\r\nsee that that right prevails as against any sort of selfish aggression;\r\nthat henceforth alliance must not be set up against alliance,\r\nunderstanding against understanding, but that there must be a common\r\nagreement for a common object, and that at the heart of that common\r\nobject must lie the inviolable rights of peoples and of mankind. The\r\nnations of the world have become each other's neighbors. It is to their\r\ninterest that they should understand each other. In order that they may\r\nunderstand each other, it is imperative that they should agree to\r\ncooeperate in a common cause, and that they should so act that the\r\nguiding principle of that common cause shall be even-handed and\r\nimpartial justice.\r\n\r\nThis is undoubtedly the thought of America. This is what we ourselves\r\nwill say when there comes proper occasion to say it. In the dealings of\r\nnations with one another arbitrary force must be rejected and we must\r\nmove forward to the thought of the modern world, the thought of which\r\npeace is the very atmosphere. That thought constitutes a chief part of\r\nthe passionate conviction of America.\r\n\r\nWe believe these fundamental things: First, that every people has a\r\nright to choose the sovereignty under which they shall live. Like other\r\nnations, we have ourselves no doubt once and again offended against that\r\nprinciple when for a little while controlled by selfish passion, as our\r\nfranker historians have been honorable enough to admit; but it has\r\nbecome more and more our rule of life and action. Second, that the small\r\nstates of the world have a right to enjoy the same respect for their\r\nsovereignty and for their territorial integrity that great and powerful\r\nnations expect and insist upon. And, third, that the world has a right\r\nto be free from every disturbance of its peace that has its origin in\r\naggression and disregard of the rights of peoples and nations.\r\n\r\nSo sincerely do we believe in these things that I am sure that I speak\r\nthe mind and wish of the people of America when I say that the United\r\nStates is willing to become a partner in any feasible association of\r\nnations formed in order to realize these objects and make them secure\r\nagainst violation.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing that the United States wants for itself that any other\r\nnation has. We are willing, on the contrary, to limit ourselves along\r\nwith them to a prescribed course of duty and respect for the rights of\r\nothers which will check any selfish passion of our own, as it will check\r\nany aggressive impulse of theirs.\r\n\r\nIf it should ever be our privilege to suggest or initiate a movement for\r\npeace among the nations now at war, I am sure that the people of the\r\nUnited States would wish their Government to move along these lines:\r\nFirst, such a settlement with regard to their own immediate interests as\r\nthe belligerents may agree upon. We have nothing material of any kind to\r\nask for ourselves, and are quite aware that we are in no sense or degree\r\nparties to the present quarrel. Our interest is only in peace and its\r\nfuture guarantees. Second, an universal association of the nations to\r\nmaintain the inviolate security of the highway of the seas for the\r\ncommon and unhindered use of all the nations of the world, and to\r\nprevent any war begun either contrary to treaty covenants or without\r\nwarning and full submission of the causes to the opinion of the\r\nworld,--a virtual guarantee of territorial integrity and political\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nBut I did not come here, let me repeat, to discuss a program. I came\r\nonly to avow a creed and give expression to the confidence I feel that\r\nthe world is even now upon the eve of a great consummation, when some\r\ncommon force will be brought into existence which shall safeguard right\r\nas the first and most fundamental interest of all peoples and all\r\ngovernments, when coercion shall be summoned not to the service of\r\npolitical ambition or selfish hostility, but to the service of a common\r\norder, a common justice, and a common peace. God grant that the dawn of\r\nthat day of frank dealing and of settled peace, concord, and cooeperation\r\nmay be near at hand!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEMANDS OF RAILWAY EMPLOYEES\r\n\r\n[Address delivered at a joint session of the two Houses of Congress,\r\nAugust 29, 1916.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nI have come to you to seek your assistance in dealing with a very grave\r\nsituation which has arisen out of the demand of the employees of the\r\nrailroads engaged in freight train service that they be granted an\r\neight-hour working day, safeguarded by payment for an hour and a half of\r\nservice for every hour of work beyond the eight.\r\n\r\nThe matter has been agitated for more than a year. The public has been\r\nmade familiar with the demands of the men and the arguments urged in\r\nfavor of them, and even more familiar with the objections of the\r\nrailroads and their counter demand that certain privileges now enjoyed\r\nby their men and certain bases of payment worked out through many years\r\nof contest be reconsidered, especially in their relation to the adoption\r\nof an eight-hour day. The matter came some three weeks ago to a final\r\nissue and resulted in a complete deadlock between the parties. The means\r\nprovided by law for the mediation of the controversy failed and the\r\nmeans of arbitration for which the law provides were rejected. The\r\nrepresentatives of the railway executives proposed that the demands of\r\nthe men be submitted in their entirety to arbitration, along with\r\ncertain questions of readjustment as to pay and conditions of employment\r\nwhich seemed to them to be either closely associated with the demands or\r\nto call for reconsideration on their own merits; the men absolutely\r\ndeclined arbitration, especially if any of their established privileges\r\nwere by that means to be drawn again in question. The law in the matter\r\nput no compulsion upon them. The four hundred thousand men from whom the\r\ndemands proceeded had voted to strike if their demands were refused; the\r\nstrike was imminent; it has since been set for the fourth of September\r\nnext. It affects the men who man the freight trains on practically every\r\nrailway in the country. The freight service throughout the United States\r\nmust stand still until their places are filled, if, indeed, it should\r\nprove possible to fill them at all. Cities will be cut off from their\r\nfood supplies, the whole commerce of the nation will be paralyzed, men\r\nof every sort and occupation will be thrown out of employment, countless\r\nthousands will in all likelihood be brought, it may be, to the very\r\npoint of starvation, and a tragical national calamity brought on, to be\r\nadded to the other distresses of the time, because no basis of\r\naccommodation or settlement has been found.\r\n\r\nJust so soon as it became evident that mediation under the existing law\r\nhad failed and that arbitration had been rendered impossible by the\r\nattitude of the men, I considered it my duty to confer with the\r\nrepresentatives of both the railways and the brotherhoods, and myself\r\noffer mediation, not as an arbitrator, but merely as spokesman of the\r\nnation, in the interest of justice, indeed, and as a friend of both\r\nparties, but not as judge, only as the representative of one hundred\r\nmillions of men, women, and children who would pay the price, the\r\nincalculable price, of loss and suffering should these few men insist\r\nupon approaching and concluding the matters in controversy between them\r\nmerely as employers and employees, rather than as patriotic citizens of\r\nthe United States looking before and after and accepting the larger\r\nresponsibility which the public would put upon them.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me, in considering the subject-matter of the controversy,\r\nthat the whole spirit of the time and the preponderant evidence of\r\nrecent economic experience spoke for the eight-hour day. It has been\r\nadjudged by the thought and experience of recent years a thing upon\r\nwhich society is justified in insisting as in the interest of health,\r\nefficiency, contentment, and a general increase of economic vigor. The\r\nwhole presumption of modern experience would, it seemed to me, be in its\r\nfavor, whether there was arbitration or not, and the debatable points to\r\nsettle were those which arose out of the acceptance of the eight-hour\r\nday rather than those which affected its establishment. I, therefore,\r\nproposed that the eight-hour day be adopted by the railway managements\r\nand put into practice for the present as a substitute for the existing\r\nten-hour basis of pay and service; that I should appoint, with the\r\npermission of the Congress, a small commission to observe the results of\r\nthe change, carefully studying the figures of the altered operating\r\ncosts, not only, but also the conditions of labor under which the men\r\nworked and the operation of their existing agreements with the\r\nrailroads, with instructions to report the facts as they found them to\r\nthe Congress at the earliest possible day, but without recommendation;\r\nand that, after the facts had been thus disclosed, an adjustment should\r\nin some orderly manner be sought of all the matters now left unadjusted\r\nbetween the railroad managers and the men.\r\n\r\nThese proposals were exactly in line, it is interesting to note, with\r\nthe position taken by the Supreme Court of the United States when\r\nappealed to to protect certain litigants from the financial losses which\r\nthey confidently expected if they should submit to the regulation of\r\ntheir charges and of their methods of service by public legislation. The\r\nCourt has held that it would not undertake to form a judgment upon\r\nforecasts, but could base its action only upon actual experience; that\r\nit must be supplied with facts, not with calculations and opinions,\r\nhowever scientifically attempted. To undertake to arbitrate the question\r\nof the adoption of an eight-hour day in the light of results merely\r\nestimated and predicted would be to undertake an enterprise of\r\nconjecture. No wise man could undertake it, or, if he did undertake it,\r\ncould feel assured of his conclusions.\r\n\r\nI unhesitatingly offered the friendly services of the administration to\r\nthe railway managers to see to it that justice was done the railroads in\r\nthe outcome. I felt warranted in assuring them that no obstacle of law\r\nwould be suffered to stand in the way of their increasing their revenues\r\nto meet the expenses resulting from the change so far as the development\r\nof their business and of their administrative efficiency did not prove\r\nadequate to meet them. The public and the representatives of the public,\r\nI felt justified in assuring them, were disposed to nothing but justice\r\nin such cases and were willing to serve those who served them.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the brotherhoods accepted the plan; but the\r\nrepresentatives of the railroads declined to accept it. In the face of\r\nwhat I cannot but regard as the practical certainty that they will be\r\nultimately obliged to accept the eight-hour day by the concerted action\r\nof organized labor, backed by the favorable judgment of society, the\r\nrepresentatives of the railway management have felt justified in\r\ndeclining a peaceful settlement which would engage all the forces of\r\njustice, public and private, on their side to take care of the event.\r\nThey fear the hostile influence of shippers, who would be opposed to an\r\nincrease of freight rates (for which, however, of course, the public\r\nitself would pay); they apparently feel no confidence that the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission could withstand the objections that would\r\nbe made. They do not care to rely upon the friendly assurances of the\r\nCongress or the President. They have thought it best that they should be\r\nforced to yield, if they must yield, not by counsel, but by the\r\nsuffering of the country. While my conferences with them were in\r\nprogress, and when to all outward appearance those conferences had come\r\nto a standstill, the representatives of the brotherhoods suddenly acted\r\nand set the strike for the fourth of September.\r\n\r\nThe railway managers based their decision to reject my counsel in this\r\nmatter upon their conviction that they must at any cost to themselves or\r\nto the country stand firm for the principle of arbitration which the men\r\nhad rejected. I based my counsel upon the indisputable fact that there\r\nwas no means of obtaining arbitration. The law supplied none; earnest\r\nefforts at mediation had failed to influence the men in the least. To\r\nstand firm for the principle of arbitration and yet not get arbitration\r\nseemed to me futile, and something more than futile, because it involved\r\nincalculable distress to the country and consequences in some respects\r\nworse than those of war, and that in the midst of peace.\r\n\r\nI yield to no man in firm adherence, alike of conviction and of purpose,\r\nto the principle of arbitration in industrial disputes; but matters have\r\ncome to a sudden crisis in this particular dispute and the country had\r\nbeen caught unprovided with any practicable means of enforcing that\r\nconviction in practice (by whose fault we will not now stop to inquire).\r\nA situation had to be met whose elements and fixed conditions were\r\nindisputable. The practical and patriotic course to pursue, as it seemed\r\nto me, was to secure immediate peace by conceding the one thing in the\r\ndemands of the men which society itself and any arbitrators who\r\nrepresented public sentiment were most likely to approve, and\r\nimmediately lay the foundations for securing arbitration with regard to\r\neverything else involved. The event has confirmed that judgment.\r\n\r\nI was seeking to compose the present in order to safeguard the future;\r\nfor I wished an atmosphere of peace and friendly cooeperation in which to\r\ntake counsel with the representatives of the nation with regard to the\r\nbest means for providing, so far as it might prove possible to provide,\r\nagainst the recurrence of such unhappy situations in the future,--the\r\nbest and most practicable means of securing calm and fair arbitration of\r\nall industrial disputes in the days to come. This is assuredly the best\r\nway of vindicating a principle, namely, having failed to make certain of\r\nits observance in the present, to make certain of its observance in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nBut I could only propose. I could not govern the will of others who took\r\nan entirely different view of the circumstances of the case, who even\r\nrefused to admit the circumstances to be what they have turned out to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nHaving failed to bring the parties to this critical controversy to an\r\naccommodation, therefore, I turn to you, deeming it clearly our duty as\r\npublic servants to leave nothing undone that we can do to safeguard the\r\nlife and interests of the nation. In the spirit of such a purpose, I\r\nearnestly recommend the following legislation:\r\n\r\nFirst, immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative\r\nreorganization of the Interstate Commerce Commission along the lines\r\nembodied in the bill recently passed by the House of Representatives and\r\nnow awaiting action by the Senate; in order that the Commission may be\r\nenabled to deal with the many great and various duties now devolving\r\nupon it with a promptness and thoroughness which are with its present\r\nconstitution and means of action practically impossible.\r\n\r\nSecond, the establishment of an eight-hour day as the legal basis alike\r\nof work and of wages in the employment of all railway employees who are\r\nactually engaged in the work of operating trains in interstate\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\nThird, the authorization of the appointment by the President of a small\r\nbody of men to observe the actual results in experience of the adoption\r\nof the eight-hour day in railway transportation alike for the men and\r\nfor the railroads; its effects in the matter of operating costs, in the\r\napplication of the existing practices and agreements to the new\r\nconditions, and in all other practical aspects, with the provision that\r\nthe investigators shall report their conclusions to the Congress at the\r\nearliest possible date, but without recommendation as to legislative\r\naction; in order that the public may learn from an unprejudiced source\r\njust what actual developments have ensued.\r\n\r\nFourth, explicit approval by the Congress of the consideration by the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission of an increase of freight rates to meet\r\nsuch additional expenditures by the railroads as may have been rendered\r\nnecessary by the adoption of the eight-hour day and which have not been\r\noffset by administrative readjustments and economies, should the facts\r\ndisclosed justify the increase.\r\n\r\nFifth, an amendment of the existing federal statute which provides for\r\nthe mediation, conciliation, and arbitration of such controversies as\r\nthe present by adding to it a provision that in case the methods of\r\naccommodation now provided for should fail, a full public investigation\r\nof the merits of every such dispute shall be instituted and completed\r\nbefore a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted.\r\n\r\nAnd, sixth, the lodgment in the hands of the Executive of the power, in\r\ncase of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such\r\nrolling stock of the railways of the country as may be required for\r\nmilitary use and to operate them for military purposes, with authority\r\nto draft into the military service of the United States such train crews\r\nand administrative officials as the circumstances require for their safe\r\nand efficient use.\r\n\r\nThis last suggestion I make because we cannot in any circumstances\r\nsuffer the nation to be hampered in the essential matter of national\r\ndefense. At the present moment circumstances render this duty\r\nparticularly obvious. Almost the entire military force of the nation is\r\nstationed upon the Mexican border to guard our territory against hostile\r\nraids. It must be supplied, and steadily supplied, with whatever it\r\nneeds for its maintenance and efficiency. If it should be necessary for\r\npurposes of national defense to transfer any portion of it upon short\r\nnotice to some other part of the country, for reasons now unforeseen,\r\nample means of transportation must be available, and available without\r\ndelay. The power conferred in this matter should be carefully and\r\nexplicitly limited to cases of military necessity, but in all such cases\r\nit should be clear and ample.\r\n\r\nThere is one other thing we should do if we are true champions of\r\narbitration. We should make all arbitral awards judgments by record of a\r\ncourt of law in order that their interpretation and enforcement may lie,\r\nnot with one of the parties to the arbitration, but with an impartial\r\nand authoritative tribunal.\r\n\r\nThese things I urge upon you, not in haste or merely as a means of\r\nmeeting a present emergency, but as permanent and necessary additions to\r\nthe law of the land, suggested, indeed, by circumstances we had hoped\r\nnever to see, but imperative as well as just, if such emergencies are to\r\nbe prevented in the future. I feel that no extended argument is needed\r\nto commend them to your favorable consideration. They demonstrate\r\nthemselves. The time and the occasion only give emphasis to their\r\nimportance. We need them now and we shall continue to need them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH OF ACCEPTANCE\r\n\r\n[On being offered the nomination for President by the Democratic Party.\r\nDelivered at Shadow Lawn, Sea Girt, N.J., Saturday, September 2, 1916.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSENATOR JAMES, GENTLEMEN OF THE NOTIFICATION COMMITTEE, FELLOW-CITIZENS:\r\n\r\nI cannot accept the leadership and responsibility which the National\r\nDemocratic Convention has again, in such generous fashion, asked me to\r\naccept without first expressing my profound gratitude to the party for\r\nthe trust it reposes in me after four years of fiery trial in the midst\r\nof affairs of unprecedented difficulty, and the keen sense of added\r\nresponsibility with which this honor fills (I had almost said burdens)\r\nme as I think of the great issues of national life and policy involved\r\nin the present and immediate future conduct of our Government. I shall\r\nseek, as I have always sought, to justify the extraordinary confidence\r\nthus reposed in me by striving to purge my heart and purpose of every\r\npersonal and of every misleading party motive and devoting every energy\r\nI have to the service of the nation as a whole, praying that I may\r\ncontinue to have the counsel and support of all forward-looking men at\r\nevery turn of the difficult business.\r\n\r\nFor I do not doubt that the people of the United States will wish the\r\nDemocratic Party to continue in control of the Government. They are not\r\nin the habit of rejecting those who have actually served them for those\r\nwho are making doubtful and conjectural promises of service. Least of\r\nall are they likely to substitute those who promised to render them\r\nparticular services and proved false to that promise for those who have\r\nactually rendered those very services.\r\n\r\nBoasting is always an empty business, which pleases nobody but the\r\nboaster, and I have no disposition to boast of what the Democratic Party\r\nhas accomplished. It has merely done its duty. It has merely fulfilled\r\nits explicit promises. But there can be no violation of good taste in\r\ncalling attention to the manner in which those promises have been\r\ncarried out or in adverting to the interesting fact that many of the\r\nthings accomplished were what the opposition party had again and again\r\npromised to do but had left undone. Indeed that is manifestly part of\r\nthe business of this year of reckoning and assessment. There is no means\r\nof judging the future except by assessing the past. Constructive action\r\nmust be weighed against destructive comment and reaction. The Democrats\r\neither have or have not understood the varied interests of the country.\r\nThe test is contained in the record.\r\n\r\nWhat is that record? What were the Democrats called into power to do?\r\nWhat things had long waited to be done, and how did the Democrats do\r\nthem? It is a record of extraordinary length and variety, rich in\r\nelements of many kinds, but consistent in principle throughout and\r\nsusceptible of brief recital.\r\n\r\nThe Republican Party was put out of power because of failure, practical\r\nfailure and moral failure; because it had served special interests and\r\nnot the country at large; because, under the leadership of its preferred\r\nand established guides, of those who still make its choices, it had lost\r\ntouch with the thoughts and the needs of the nation and was living in a\r\npast age and under a fixed illusion, the illusion of greatness. It had\r\nframed tariff laws based upon a fear of foreign trade, a fundamental\r\ndoubt as to American skill, enterprise, and capacity, and a very tender\r\nregard for the profitable privileges of those who had gained control of\r\ndomestic markets and domestic credits; and yet had enacted anti-trust\r\nlaws which hampered the very things they meant to foster, which were\r\nstiff and inelastic, and in part unintelligible. It had permitted the\r\ncountry throughout the long period of its control to stagger from one\r\nfinancial crisis to another under the operation of a national banking\r\nlaw of its own framing which made stringency and panic certain and the\r\ncontrol of the larger business operations of the country by the bankers\r\nof a few reserve centers inevitable; had made as if it meant to reform\r\nthe law but had faint-heartedly failed in the attempt, because it could\r\nnot bring itself to do the one thing necessary to make the reform\r\ngenuine and effectual, namely, break up the control of small groups of\r\nbankers. It had been oblivious, or indifferent, to the fact that the\r\nfarmers, upon whom the country depends for its food and in the last\r\nanalysis for its prosperity, were without standing in the matter of\r\ncommercial credit, without the protection of standards in their market\r\ntransactions, and without systematic knowledge of the markets\r\nthemselves; that the laborers of the country, the great army of men who\r\nman the industries it was professing to father and promote, carried\r\ntheir labor as a mere commodity to market, were subject to restraint by\r\nnovel and drastic process in the courts, were without assurance of\r\ncompensation for industrial accidents, without federal assistance in\r\naccommodating labor disputes, and without national aid or advice in\r\nfinding the places and the industries in which their labor was most\r\nneeded. The country had no national system of road construction and\r\ndevelopment. Little intelligent attention was paid to the army, and not\r\nenough to the navy. The other republics of America distrusted us,\r\nbecause they found that we thought first of the profits of American\r\ninvestors and only as an afterthought of impartial justice and helpful\r\nfriendship. Its policy was provincial in all things; its purposes were\r\nout of harmony with the temper and purpose of the people and the timely\r\ndevelopment of the nation's interests.\r\n\r\nSo things stood when the Democratic Party came into power. How do they\r\nstand now? Alike in the domestic field and in the wide field of the\r\ncommerce of the world, American business and life and industry have been\r\nset free to move as they never moved before.\r\n\r\nThe tariff has been revised, not on the principle of repelling foreign\r\ntrade, but upon the principle of encouraging it, upon something like a\r\nfooting of equality with our own in respect of the terms of competition,\r\nand a Tariff Board has been created whose function it will be to keep\r\nthe relations of American with foreign business and industry under\r\nconstant observation, for the guidance alike of our business men and of\r\nour Congress. American energies are now directed towards the markets of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe laws against trusts have been clarified by definition, with a view\r\nto making it plain that they were not directed against big business but\r\nonly against unfair business and the pretense of competition where there\r\nwas none; and a Trade Commission has been created with powers of\r\nguidance and accommodation which have relieved business men of unfounded\r\nfears and set them upon the road of hopeful and confident enterprise.\r\n\r\nBy the Federal Reserve Act the supply of currency at the disposal of\r\nactive business has been rendered elastic, taking its volume, not from a\r\nfixed body of investment securities, but from the liquid assets of daily\r\ntrade; and these assets are assessed and accepted, not by distant groups\r\nof bankers in control of unavailable reserves, but by bankers at the\r\nmany centers of local exchange who are in touch with local conditions\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nEffective measures have been taken for the re-creation of an American\r\nmerchant marine and the revival of the American carrying trade\r\nindispensable to our emancipation from the control which foreigners have\r\nso long exercised over the opportunities, the routes, and the methods of\r\nour commerce with other countries.\r\n\r\nThe Interstate Commerce Commission is about to be reorganized to enable\r\nit to perform its great and important functions more promptly and more\r\nefficiently. We have created, extended and improved the service of the\r\nparcels post.\r\n\r\nSo much we have done for business. What other party has understood the\r\ntask so well or executed it so intelligently and energetically? What\r\nother party has attempted it at all? The Republican leaders, apparently,\r\nknow of no means of assisting business but \"protection.\" How to\r\nstimulate it and put it upon a new footing of energy and enterprise they\r\nhave not suggested.\r\n\r\nFor the farmers of the country we have virtually created commercial\r\ncredit, by means of the Federal Reserve Act and the Rural Credits Act.\r\nThey now have the standing of other business men in the money market. We\r\nhave successfully regulated speculation in \"futures\" and established\r\nstandards in the marketing of grains. By an intelligent Warehouse Act we\r\nhave assisted to make the standard crops available as never before both\r\nfor systematic marketing and as a security for loans from the banks. We\r\nhave greatly added to the work of neighborhood demonstration on the farm\r\nitself of improved methods of cultivation, and, through the intelligent\r\nextension of the functions of the Department of Agriculture, have made\r\nit possible for the farmer to learn systematically where his best\r\nmarkets are and how to get at them.\r\n\r\nThe workingmen of America have been given a veritable emancipation, by\r\nthe legal recognition of a man's labor as part of his life, and not a\r\nmere marketable commodity; by exempting labor organizations from\r\nprocesses of the courts which treated their members like fractional\r\nparts of mobs and not like accessible and responsible individuals; by\r\nreleasing our seamen from involuntary servitude; by making adequate\r\nprovision for compensation for industrial accidents; by providing\r\nsuitable machinery for mediation and conciliation in industrial\r\ndisputes; and by putting the Federal Department of Labor at the disposal\r\nof the workingman when in search of work.\r\n\r\nWe have effected the emancipation of the children of the country by\r\nreleasing them from hurtful labor. We have instituted a system of\r\nnational aid in the building of highroads such as the country has been\r\nfeeling after for a century. We have sought to equalize taxation by\r\nmeans of an equitable income tax. We have taken the steps that ought to\r\nhave been taken at the outset to open up the resources of Alaska. We\r\nhave provided for national defense upon a scale never before seriously\r\nproposed upon the responsibility of an entire political party. We have\r\ndriven the tariff lobby from cover and obliged it to substitute solid\r\nargument for private influence.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary recital must sound like a platform, a list of\r\nsanguine promises; but it is not. It is a record of promises made four\r\nyears ago and now actually redeemed in constructive legislation.\r\n\r\nThese things must profoundly disturb the thoughts and confound the plans\r\nof those who have made themselves believe that the Democratic Party\r\nneither understood nor was ready to assist the business of the country\r\nin the great enterprises which it is its evident and inevitable destiny\r\nto undertake and carry through. The breaking up of the lobby must\r\nespecially disconcert them: for it was through the lobby that they\r\nsought and were sure they had found the heart of things. The game of\r\nprivilege can be played successfully by no other means.\r\n\r\nThis record must equally astonish those who feared that the Democratic\r\nParty had not opened its heart to comprehend the demands of social\r\njustice. We have in four years come very near to carrying out the\r\nplatform of the Progressive Party as well as our own; for we also are\r\nprogressives.\r\n\r\nThere is one circumstance connected with this program which ought to be\r\nvery plainly stated. It was resisted at every step by the interests\r\nwhich the Republican Party had catered to and fostered at the expense of\r\nthe country, and these same interests are now earnestly praying for a\r\nreaction which will save their privileges,--for the restoration of their\r\nsworn friends to power before it is too late to recover what they have\r\nlost. They fought with particular desperation and infinite\r\nresourcefulness the reform of the banking and currency system, knowing\r\nthat to be the citadel of their control; and most anxiously are they\r\nhoping and planning for the amendment of the Federal Reserve Act by the\r\nconcentration of control in a single bank which the old familiar group\r\nof bankers can keep under their eye and direction. But while the \"big\r\nmen\" who used to write the tariffs and command the assistance of the\r\nTreasury have been hostile,--all but a few with vision,--the average\r\nbusiness man knows that he has been delivered, and that the fear that\r\nwas once every day in his heart, that the men who controlled credit and\r\ndirected enterprise from the committee rooms of Congress would crush\r\nhim, is there no more, and will not return,--unless the party that\r\nconsulted only the \"big men\" should return to power,--the party of\r\nmasterly inactivity and cunning resourcefulness in standing pat to\r\nresist change.\r\n\r\nThe Republican Party is just the party that _cannot_ meet the new\r\nconditions of a new age. It does not know the way and it does not wish\r\nnew conditions. It tried to break away from the old leaders and could\r\nnot. They still select its candidates and dictate its policy, still\r\nresist change, still hanker after the old conditions, still know no\r\nmethods of encouraging business but the old methods. When it changes its\r\nleaders and its purposes and brings its ideas up to date it will have\r\nthe right to ask the American people to give it power again; but not\r\nuntil then. A new age, an age of revolutionary change, needs new\r\npurposes and new ideas.\r\n\r\nIn foreign affairs we have been guided by principles clearly conceived\r\nand consistently lived up to. Perhaps they have not been fully\r\ncomprehended because they have hitherto governed international affairs\r\nonly in theory, not in practice. They are simple, obvious, easily\r\nstated, and fundamental to American ideals.\r\n\r\nWe have been neutral not only because it was the fixed and traditional\r\npolicy of the United States to stand aloof from the politics of Europe\r\nand because we had had no part either of action or of policy in the\r\ninfluences which brought on the present war, but also because it was\r\nmanifestly our duty to prevent, if it were possible, the indefinite\r\nextension of the fires of hate and desolation kindled by that terrible\r\nconflict and seek to serve mankind by reserving cur strength and our\r\nresources for the anxious and difficult days of restoration and healing\r\nwhich must follow, when peace will have to build its house anew.\r\n\r\nThe rights of our own citizens of course became involved: that was\r\ninevitable. Where they did this was our guiding principle: that property\r\nrights can be vindicated by claims for damages and no modern nation can\r\ndecline to arbitrate such claims; but the fundamental rights of humanity\r\ncannot be. The loss of life is irreparable. Neither can direct\r\nviolations of a nation's sovereignty await vindication in suits for\r\ndamages. The nation that violates these essential rights must expect to\r\nbe checked and called to account by direct challenge and resistance. It\r\nat once makes the quarrel in part our own. These are plain principles\r\nand we have never lost sight of them or departed from them, whatever the\r\nstress or the perplexity of circumstance or the provocation to hasty\r\nresentment. The record is clear and consistent throughout and stands\r\ndistinct and definite for anyone to judge who wishes to know the truth\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nThe seas were not broad enough to keep the infection of the conflict out\r\nof our own politics. The passions and intrigues of certain active groups\r\nand combinations of men amongst us who were born under foreign flags\r\ninjected the poison of disloyalty into our own most critical affairs,\r\nlaid violent hands upon many of our industries, and subjected us to the\r\nshame of divisions of sentiment and purpose in which America was\r\ncontemned and forgotten. It is part of the business of this year of\r\nreckoning and settlement to speak plainly and act with unmistakable\r\npurpose in rebuke of these things, in order that they may be forever\r\nhereafter impossible. I am the candidate of a party, but I am above all\r\nthings else an American citizen. I neither seek the favor nor fear the\r\ndispleasure of that small alien element amongst us which puts loyalty to\r\nany foreign power before loyalty to the United States.\r\n\r\nWhile Europe was at war our own continent, one of our own neighbors, was\r\nshaken by revolution. In that matter, too, principle was plain and it\r\nwas imperative that we should live up to it if we were to deserve the\r\ntrust of any real partisan of the right as free men see it. We have\r\nprofessed to believe, and we do believe, that the people of small and\r\nweak states have the right to expect to be dealt with exactly as the\r\npeople of big and powerful states would be. We have acted upon that\r\nprinciple in dealing with the people of Mexico.\r\n\r\nOur recent pursuit of bandits into Mexican territory was no violation of\r\nthat principle. We ventured to enter Mexican territory only because\r\nthere were no military forces in Mexico that could protect our border\r\nfrom hostile attack and our own people from violence, and we have\r\ncommitted there no single act of hostility or interference even with the\r\nsovereign authority of the Republic of Mexico herself. It was a plain\r\ncase of the violation of our own sovereignty which could not wait to be\r\nvindicated by damages and for which there was no other remedy. The\r\nauthorities of Mexico were powerless to prevent it.\r\n\r\nMany serious wrongs against the property, many irreparable wrongs\r\nagainst the persons of Americans have been committed within the\r\nterritory of Mexico herself during this confused revolution, wrongs\r\nwhich could not be effectually checked so long as there was no\r\nconstituted power in Mexico which was in a position to check them. We\r\ncould not act directly in that matter ourselves without denying Mexicans\r\nthe right to any revolution at all which disturbed us and making the\r\nemancipation of her own people await our own interest and convenience.\r\n\r\nFor it is their emancipation that they are seeking,--blindly, it may be,\r\nand as yet ineffectually, but with profound and passionate purpose and\r\nwithin their unquestionable right, apply what true American principle\r\nyou will,--any principle that an American would publicly avow. The\r\npeople of Mexico have not been suffered to own their own country or\r\ndirect their own institutions. Outsiders, men out of other nations and\r\nwith interests too often alien to their own, have dictated what their\r\nprivileges and opportunities should be and who should control their\r\nland, their lives, and their resources,--some of them Americans,\r\npressing for things they could never have got in their own country. The\r\nMexican people are entitled to attempt their liberty from such\r\ninfluences; and so long as I have anything to do with the action of our\r\ngreat Government I shall do everything in my power to prevent anyone\r\nstanding in their way. I know that this is hard for some persons to\r\nunderstand; but it is not hard for the plain people of the United States\r\nto understand. It is hard doctrine only for those who wish to get\r\nsomething for themselves out of Mexico. There are men, and noble women,\r\ntoo, not a few, of our own people, thank God! whose fortunes are\r\ninvested in great properties in Mexico who yet see the case with true\r\nvision and assess its issues with true American feeling. The rest can be\r\nleft for the present out of the reckoning until this enslaved people has\r\nhad its day of struggle towards the light. I have heard no one who was\r\nfree from such influences propose interference by the United States with\r\nthe internal affairs of Mexico. Certainly no friend of the Mexican\r\npeople has proposed it.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States are capable of great sympathies and a\r\nnoble pity in dealing with problems of this kind. As their spokesman and\r\nrepresentative, I have tried to act in the spirit they would wish me\r\nshow. The people of Mexico are striving for the rights that are\r\nfundamental to life and happiness,--15,000,000 oppressed men,\r\noverburdened women, and pitiful children in virtual bondage in their own\r\nhome of fertile lands and inexhaustible treasure! Some of the leaders of\r\nthe revolution may often have been mistaken and violent and selfish, but\r\nthe revolution itself was inevitable and is right. The unspeakable\r\nHuerta betrayed the very comrades he served, traitorously overthrew the\r\ngovernment of which he was a trusted part, impudently spoke for the very\r\nforces that had driven his people to the rebellion with which he had\r\npretended to sympathize. The men who overcame him and drove him out\r\nrepresent at least the fierce passion of reconstruction which lies at\r\nthe very heart of liberty; and so long as they represent, however\r\nimperfectly, such a struggle for deliverance, I am ready to serve their\r\nends when I can. So long as the power of recognition rests with me the\r\nGovernment of the United States will refuse to extend the hand of\r\nwelcome to any one who obtains power in a sister republic by treachery\r\nand violence. No permanency can be given the affairs of any republic by\r\na title based upon intrigue and assassination. I declared that to be the\r\npolicy of this Administration within three weeks after I assumed the\r\npresidency. I here again vow it. I am more interested in the fortunes of\r\noppressed men and pitiful women and children than in any property rights\r\nwhatever. Mistakes I have no doubt made in this perplexing business, but\r\nnot in purpose or object.\r\n\r\nMore is involved than the immediate destinies of Mexico and the\r\nrelations of the United States with a distressed and distracted people.\r\nAll America looks on. Test is now being made of us whether we be sincere\r\nlovers of popular liberty or not and are indeed to be trusted to respect\r\nnational sovereignty among our weaker neighbors. We have undertaken\r\nthese many years to play big brother to the republics of this\r\nhemisphere. This is the day of our test whether we mean, or have ever\r\nmeant, to play that part for our own benefit wholly or also for theirs.\r\nUpon the outcome of that test (its outcome in their minds, not in ours)\r\ndepends every relationship of the United States with Latin America,\r\nwhether in politics or in commerce and enterprise. These are great\r\nissues and lie at the heart of the gravest tasks of the future, tasks\r\nboth economic and political and very intimately inwrought with many of\r\nthe most vital of the new issues of the politics of the world. The\r\nrepublics of America have in the last three years been drawing together\r\nin a new spirit of accommodation, mutual understanding, and cordial\r\ncooeperation. Much of the politics of the world in the years to come will\r\ndepend upon their relationships with one another. It is a barren and\r\nprovincial statesmanship that loses sight of such things!\r\n\r\nThe future, the immediate future, will bring us squarely face to face\r\nwith many great and exacting problems which will search us through and\r\nthrough whether we be able and ready to play the part in the world that\r\nwe mean to play. It will not bring us into their presence slowly,\r\ngently, with ceremonious introduction, but suddenly and at once, the\r\nmoment the war in Europe is over. They will be new problems, most of\r\nthem; many will be old problems in a new setting and with new elements\r\nwhich we have never dealt with or reckoned the force and meaning of\r\nbefore. They will require for their solution new thinking, fresh courage\r\nand resourcefulness, and in some matters radical reconsiderations of\r\npolicy. We must be ready to mobilize our resources alike of brains and\r\nof materials.\r\n\r\nIt is not a future to be afraid of. It is, rather, a future to stimulate\r\nand excite us to the display of the best powers that are in us. We may\r\nenter it with confidence when we are sure that we understand it,--and we\r\nhave provided ourselves already with the means of understanding it.\r\n\r\nLook first at what it will be necessary that the nations of the world\r\nshould do to make the days to come tolerable and fit to live and work\r\nin; and then look at our part in what is to follow and our own duty of\r\npreparation. For we must be prepared both in resources and in policy.\r\n\r\nThere must be a just and settled peace, and we here in America must\r\ncontribute the full force of our enthusiasm and of our authority as a\r\nnation to the organization of that peace upon world-wide foundations\r\nthat cannot easily be shaken. No nation should be forced to take sides\r\nin any quarrel in which its own honor and integrity and the fortunes of\r\nits own people are not involved; but no nation can any longer remain\r\nneutral as against any wilful disturbance of the peace of the world. The\r\neffects of war can no longer be confined to the areas of battle. No\r\nnation stands wholly apart in interest when the life and interests of\r\nall nations are thrown into confusion and peril. If hopeful and generous\r\nenterprise is to be renewed, if the healing and helpful arts of life are\r\nindeed to be revived when peace comes again, a new atmosphere of justice\r\nand friendship must be generated by means the world has never tried\r\nbefore. The nations of the world must unite in joint guarantees that\r\nwhatever is done to disturb the whole world's life must first be tested\r\nin the court of the whole world's opinion before it is attempted.\r\n\r\nThese are the new foundations the world must build for itself, and we\r\nmust play our part in the reconstruction, generously and without too\r\nmuch thought of our separate interests. We must make ourselves ready to\r\nplay it intelligently, vigorously, and well.\r\n\r\nOne of the contributions we must make to the world's peace is this: We\r\nmust see to it that the people in our insular possessions are treated in\r\ntheir own lands as we would treat them here, and make the rule of the\r\nUnited States mean the same thing everywhere,--the same justice, the\r\nsame consideration for the essential rights of men.\r\n\r\nBesides contributing our ungrudging moral and practical support to the\r\nestablishment of peace throughout the world we must actively and\r\nintelligently prepare ourselves to do our full service in the trade and\r\nindustry which are to sustain and develop the life of the nations in the\r\ndays to come.\r\n\r\nWe have already been provident in this great matter and supplied\r\nourselves with the instrumentalities of prompt adjustment. We have\r\ncreated, in the Federal Trade Commission, a means of inquiry and of\r\naccommodation in the field of commerce which ought both to cooerdinate\r\nthe enterprises of our traders and manufacturers and to remove the\r\nbarriers of misunderstanding and of a too technical interpretation of\r\nthe law. In the new Tariff Commission we have added another\r\ninstrumentality of observation and adjustment which promises to be\r\nimmediately serviceable. The Trade Commission substitutes counsel and\r\naccommodation for the harsher processes of legal restraint, and the\r\nTariff Commission ought to substitute facts for prejudices and theories.\r\nOur exporters have for some time had the advantage of working in the new\r\nlight thrown upon foreign markets and opportunities of trade by the\r\nintelligent inquiries and activities of the Bureau of Foreign and\r\nDomestic Commerce which the Democratic Congress so wisely created in\r\n1912. The Tariff Commission completes the machinery by which we shall be\r\nenabled to open up our legislative policy to the facts as they develop.\r\n\r\nWe can no longer indulge our traditional provincialism. We are to play a\r\nleading part in the world drama whether we wish it or not. We shall\r\nlend, not borrow; act for ourselves, not imitate or follow; organize and\r\ninitiate, not peep about merely to see where we may get in.\r\n\r\nWe have already formulated and agreed upon a policy of law which will\r\nexplicitly remove the ban now supposed to rest upon cooeperation amongst\r\nour exporters in seeking and securing their proper place in the markets\r\nof the world. The field will be free, the instrumentalities at hand. It\r\nwill only remain for the masters of enterprise amongst us to act in\r\nenergetic concert, and for the Government of the United States to insist\r\nupon the maintenance throughout the world of those conditions of\r\nfairness and of even-handed justice in the commercial dealings of the\r\nnations with one another upon which, after all, in the last analysis,\r\nthe peace and ordered life of the world must ultimately depend.\r\n\r\nAt home also we must see to it that the men who plan and develop and\r\ndirect our business enterprises shall enjoy definite and settled\r\nconditions of law, a policy accommodated to the freest progress. We have\r\nset the just and necessary limits. We have put all kinds of unfair\r\ncompetition under the ban and penalty of the law. We have barred\r\nmonopoly. These fatal and ugly things being excluded, we must now\r\nquicken action and facilitate enterprise by every just means within our\r\nchoice. There will be peace in the business world, and, with peace,\r\nrevived confidence and life.\r\n\r\nWe ought both to husband and to develop our natural resources, our\r\nmines, our forests, our water power. I wish we could have made more\r\nprogress than we have made in this vital matter; and I call once more,\r\nwith the deepest earnestness and solicitude, upon the advocates of a\r\ncareful and provident conservation, on the one hand, and the advocates\r\nof a free and inviting field for private capital, on the other, to get\r\ntogether in a spirit of genuine accommodation and agreement and set this\r\ngreat policy forward at once.\r\n\r\nWe must hearten and quicken the spirit and efficiency of labor\r\nthroughout our whole industrial system by everywhere and in all\r\noccupations doing justice to the laborer, not only by paying a living\r\nwage but also by making all the conditions that surround labor what they\r\nought to be. And we must do more than justice. We must safeguard life\r\nand promote health and safety in every occupation in which they are\r\nthreatened or imperilled. That is more than justice, and better, because\r\nit is humanity and economy.\r\n\r\nWe must cooerdinate the railway systems of the country for national use,\r\nand must facilitate and promote their development with a view to that\r\ncooerdination and to their better adaptation as a whole to the life and\r\ntrade and defense of the nation. The life and industry of the country\r\ncan be free and unhampered only if these arteries are open, efficient,\r\nand complete.\r\n\r\nThus shall we stand ready to meet the future as circumstance and\r\ninternational policy effect their unfolding, whether the changes come\r\nslowly or come fast and without preface.\r\n\r\nI have not spoken explicitly, Gentlemen, of the platform adopted at St.\r\nLouis; but it has been implicit in all that I have said. I have sought\r\nto interpret its spirit and meaning. The people of the United States do\r\nnot need to be assured now that that platform is a definite pledge, a\r\npractical program. We have proved to them that our promises are made to\r\nbe kept.\r\n\r\nWe hold very definite ideals. We believe that the energy and initiative\r\nof our people have been too narrowly coached and superintended; that\r\nthey should be set free, as we have set them free, to disperse\r\nthemselves throughout the nation; that they should not be concentrated\r\nin the hands of a few powerful guides and guardians, as our opponents\r\nhave again and again, in effect if not in purpose, sought to concentrate\r\nthem. We believe, moreover,--who that looks about him now with\r\ncomprehending eye can fail to believe?--that the day of Little\r\nAmericanism, with its narrow horizons, when methods of \"protection\" and\r\nindustrial nursing were the chief study of our provincial statesmen, are\r\npast and gone and that a day of enterprise has at last dawned for the\r\nUnited States whose field is the wide world.\r\n\r\nWe hope to see the stimulus of that new day draw all America, the\r\nrepublics of both continents, on to a new life and energy and initiative\r\nin the great affairs of peace. We are Americans for Big America, and\r\nrejoice to look forward to the days in which America shall strive to\r\nstir the world without irritating it or drawing it on to new\r\nantagonisms, when the nations with which we deal shall at last come to\r\nsee upon what deep foundations of humanity and justice our passion for\r\npeace rests, and when all mankind shall look upon our great people with\r\na new sentiment of admiration, friendly rivalry and real affection, as\r\nupon a people who, though keen to succeed, seeks always to be at once\r\ngenerous and just and to whom humanity is dearer than profit or selfish\r\npower.\r\n\r\nUpon this record and in the faith of this purpose we go to the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN'S BEGINNINGS\r\n\r\n[Address delivered September 4, 1916, on the acceptance of a deed of\r\ngift to the Nation, by the Lincoln Farm Association, of the Lincoln\r\nBirthplace Farm, at Hodgenville, Kentucky.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo more significant memorial could have been presented to the nation\r\nthan this. It expresses so much of what is singular and noteworthy in\r\nthe history of the country; it suggests so many of the things that we\r\nprize most highly in our life and in our system of government. How\r\neloquent this little house within this shrine is of the vigor of\r\ndemocracy! There is nowhere in the land any home so remote, so humble,\r\nthat it may not contain the power of mind and heart and conscience to\r\nwhich nations yield and history submits its processes. Nature pays no\r\ntribute to aristocracy, subscribes to no creed of caste, renders fealty\r\nto no monarch or master of any name or kind. Genius is no snob. It does\r\nnot run after titles or seek by preference the high circles of society.\r\nIt affects humble company as well as great. It pays no special tribute\r\nto universities or learned societies or conventional standards of\r\ngreatness, but serenely chooses its own comrades, its own haunts, its\r\nown cradle even, and its own life of adventure and of training. Here is\r\nproof of it. This little hut was the cradle of one of the great sons of\r\nmen, a man of singular, delightful, vital genius who presently emerged\r\nupon the great stage of the nation's history, gaunt, shy, ungainly, but\r\ndominant and majestic, a natural ruler of men, himself inevitably the\r\ncentral figure of the great plot. No man can explain this, but every man\r\ncan see how it demonstrates the vigor of democracy, where every door is\r\nopen, in every hamlet and countryside, in city and wilderness alike,\r\nfor the ruler to emerge when he will and claim his leadership in the\r\nfree life. Such are the authentic proofs of the validity and vitality of\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nHere, no less, hides the mystery of democracy. Who shall guess this\r\nsecret of nature and providence and a free polity? Whatever the vigor\r\nand vitality of the stock from which he sprang, its mere vigor and\r\nsoundness do not explain where this man got his great heart that seemed\r\nto comprehend all mankind in its catholic and benignant sympathy, the\r\nmind that sat enthroned behind those brooding, melancholy eyes, whose\r\nvision swept many an horizon which those about him dreamed not of,--that\r\nmind that comprehended what it had never seen, and understood the\r\nlanguage of affairs with the ready ease of one to the manner born,--or\r\nthat nature which seemed in its varied richness to be the familiar of\r\nmen of every way of life. This is the sacred mystery of democracy, that\r\nits richest fruits spring up out of soils which no man has prepared and\r\nin circumstances amidst which they are the least expected. This is a\r\nplace alike of mystery and of reassurance.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that in a society ordered otherwise than our own Lincoln\r\ncould not have found himself or the path of fame and power upon which he\r\nwalked serenely to his death. In this place it is right that we should\r\nremind ourselves of the solid and striking facts upon which our faith in\r\ndemocracy is founded. Many another man besides Lincoln has served the\r\nnation in its highest places of counsel and of action whose origins were\r\nas humble as his. Though the greatest example of the universal energy,\r\nrichness, stimulation, and force of democracy, he is only one example\r\namong many. The permeating and all-pervasive virtue of the freedom which\r\nchallenges us in America to make the most of every gift and power we\r\npossess every page of our history serves to emphasize and illustrate.\r\nStanding here in this place, it seems almost the whole of the stirring\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nHere Lincoln had his beginnings. Here the end and consummation of that\r\ngreat life seem remote and a bit incredible. And yet there was no break\r\nanywhere between beginning and end, no lack of natural sequence\r\nanywhere. Nothing really incredible happened. Lincoln was unaffectedly\r\nas much at home in the White House as he was here. Do you share with me\r\nthe feeling, I wonder, that he was permanently at home nowhere? It seems\r\nto me that in the case of a man,--I would rather say of a spirit,--like\r\nLincoln the question _where_ he was is of little significance, that it\r\nis always _what_ he was that really arrests our thought and takes hold\r\nof our imagination. It is the spirit always that is sovereign. Lincoln,\r\nlike the rest of us, was put through the discipline of the world,--a\r\nvery rough and exacting discipline for him, an indispensable discipline\r\nfor every man who would know what he is about in the midst of the\r\nworld's affairs; but his spirit got only its schooling there. It did not\r\nderive its character or its vision from the experiences which brought it\r\nto its full revelation. The test of every American must always be, not\r\nwhere he is, but what he is. That, also, is of the essence of democracy,\r\nand is the moral of which this place is most gravely expressive.\r\n\r\nWe would like to think of men like Lincoln and Washington as typical\r\nAmericans, but no man can be typical who is so unusual as these great\r\nmen were. It was typical of American life that it should produce such\r\nmen with supreme indifference as to the manner in which it produced\r\nthem, and as readily here in this hut as amidst the little circle of\r\ncultivated gentlemen to whom Virginia owed so much in leadership and\r\nexample. And Lincoln and Washington were typical Americans in the use\r\nthey made of their genius. But there will be few such men at best, and\r\nwe will not look into the mystery of how and why they come. We will only\r\nkeep the door open for them always, and a hearty welcome,--after we have\r\nrecognized them.\r\n\r\nI have read many biographies of Lincoln; I have sought out with the\r\ngreatest interest the many intimate stories that are told of him, the\r\nnarratives of nearby friends, the sketches at close quarters, in which\r\nthose who had the privilege of being associated with him have tried to\r\ndepict for us the very man himself \"in his habit as he lived;\" but I\r\nhave nowhere found a real intimate of Lincoln's. I nowhere get the\r\nimpression in any narrative or reminiscence that the writer had in fact\r\npenetrated to the heart of his mystery, or that any man could penetrate\r\nto the heart of it. That brooding spirit had no real familiars. I get\r\nthe impression that it never spoke out in complete self-revelation, and\r\nthat it could not reveal itself completely to anyone. It was a very\r\nlonely spirit that looked out from underneath those shaggy brows and\r\ncomprehended men without fully communing with them, as if, in spite of\r\nall its genial efforts at comradeship, it dwelt apart, saw its visions\r\nof duty where no man looked on. There is a very holy and very terrible\r\nisolation for the conscience of every man who seeks to read the destiny\r\nin affairs for others as well as for himself, for a nation as well as\r\nfor individuals. That privacy no man can intrude upon. That lonely\r\nsearch of the spirit for the right perhaps no man can assist. This\r\nstrange child of the cabin kept company with invisible things, was born\r\ninto no intimacy but that of its own silently assembling and deploying\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nI have come here to-day, not to utter a eulogy on Lincoln; he stands in\r\nneed of none, but to endeavor to interpret the meaning of this gift to\r\nthe nation of the place of his birth and origin. Is not this an altar\r\nupon which we may forever keep alive the vestal fire of democracy as\r\nupon a shrine at which some of the deepest and most sacred hopes of\r\nmankind may from age to age be rekindled? For these hopes must\r\nconstantly be rekindled, and only those who live can rekindle them. The\r\nonly stuff that can retain the life-giving heat is the stuff of living\r\nhearts. And the hopes of mankind cannot be kept alive by words merely,\r\nby constitutions and doctrines of right and codes of liberty. The object\r\nof democracy is to transmute these into the life and action of society,\r\nthe self-denial and self-sacrifice of heroic men and women willing to\r\nmake their lives an embodiment of right and service and enlightened\r\npurpose. The commands of democracy are as imperative as its privileges\r\nand opportunities are wide and generous. Its compulsion is upon us. It\r\nwill be great and lift a great light for the guidance of the nations\r\nonly if we are great and carry that light high for the guidance of our\r\nown feet. We are not worthy to stand here unless we ourselves be in deed\r\nand in truth real democrats and servants of mankind, ready to give our\r\nvery lives for the freedom and justice and spiritual exaltation of the\r\ngreat nation which shelters and nurtures us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIUMPH OF WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE\r\n\r\n[Address at the Suffrage Convention, Atlantic City, New Jersey,\r\nSeptember 8, 1916.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAM PRESIDENT, LADIES OF THE ASSOCIATION:\r\n\r\nI have found it a real privilege to be here to-night and to listen to\r\nthe addresses which you have heard. Though you may not all of you\r\nbelieve it, I would a great deal rather hear somebody else speak than\r\nspeak myself; but I should feel that I was omitting a duty if I did not\r\naddress you to-night and say some of the things that have been in my\r\nthought as I realized the approach of this evening and the duty that\r\nwould fall upon me.\r\n\r\nThe astonishing thing about the movement which you represent is, not\r\nthat it has grown so slowly, but that it has grown so rapidly. No doubt\r\nfor those who have been a long time in the struggle, like your honored\r\npresident, it seems a long and arduous path that has been trodden, but\r\nwhen you think of the cumulating force of this movement in recent\r\ndecades, you must agree with me that it is one of the most astonishing\r\ntides in modern history. Two generations ago, no doubt Madam President\r\nwill agree with me in saying, it was a handful of women who were\r\nfighting this cause. Now it is a great multitude of women who are\r\nfighting it.\r\n\r\nAnd there are some interesting historical connections which I would like\r\nto attempt to point out to you. One of the most striking facts about the\r\nhistory of the United States is that at the outset it was a lawyers'\r\nhistory. Almost all of the questions to which America addressed itself,\r\nsay a hundred years ago, were legal questions, were questions of\r\nmethod, not questions of what you were going to do with your Government,\r\nbut questions of how you were going to constitute your Government,--how\r\nyou were going to balance the powers of the States and the Federal\r\nGovernment, how you were going to balance the claims of property against\r\nthe processes of liberty, how you were going to make your governments up\r\nso as to balance the parts against each other so that the legislature\r\nwould check the executive, and the executive the legislature, and the\r\ncourts both of them put together. The whole conception of government\r\nwhen the United States became a Nation was a mechanical conception of\r\ngovernment, and the mechanical conception of government which underlay\r\nit was the Newtonian theory of the universe. If you pick up the\r\nFederalist, some parts of it read like a treatise on astronomy instead\r\nof a treatise on government. They speak of the centrifugal and the\r\ncentripetal forces, and locate the President somewhere in a rotating\r\nsystem. The whole thing is a calculation of power and an adjustment of\r\nparts. There was a time when nobody but a lawyer could know enough to\r\nrun the Government of the United States, and a distinguished English\r\npublicist once remarked, speaking of the complexity of the American\r\nGovernment, that it was no proof of the excellence of the American\r\nConstitution that it had been successfully operated, because the\r\nAmericans could run any constitution. But there have been a great many\r\ntechnical difficulties in running it.\r\n\r\nAnd then something happened. A great question arose in this country\r\nwhich, though complicated with legal elements, was at bottom a human\r\nquestion, and nothing but a question of humanity. That was the slavery\r\nquestion. And is it not significant that it was then, and then for the\r\nfirst time, that women became prominent in politics in America? Not many\r\nwomen; those prominent in that day were so few that you can name them\r\nover in a brief catalogue, but, nevertheless, they then began to play a\r\npart in writing, not only, but in public speech, which was a very novel\r\npart for women to play in America. After the Civil War had settled some\r\nof what seemed to be the most difficult legal questions of our system,\r\nthe life of the Nation began not only to unfold, but to accumulate. Life\r\nin the United States was a comparatively simple matter at the time of\r\nthe Civil War. There was none of that underground struggle which is now\r\nso manifest to those who look only a little way beneath the surface.\r\nStories such as Dr. Davis has told to-night were uncommon in those\r\nsimpler days. The pressure of low wages, the agony of obscure and\r\nunremunerated toil, did not exist in America in anything like the same\r\nproportions that they exist now. And as our life has unfolded and\r\naccumulated, as the contacts of it have become hot, as the populations\r\nhave assembled in the cities, and the cool spaces of the country have\r\nbeen supplanted by the feverish urban areas, the whole nature of our\r\npolitical questions has been altered. They have ceased to be legal\r\nquestions. They have more and more become social questions, questions\r\nwith regard to the relations of human beings to one another,--not merely\r\ntheir legal relations, but their moral and spiritual relations to one\r\nanother. This has been most characteristic of American life in the last\r\nfew decades, and as these questions have assumed greater and greater\r\nprominence, the movement which this association represents has gathered\r\ncumulative force. So that, if anybody asks himself, \"What does this\r\ngathering force mean,\" if he knows anything about the history of the\r\ncountry, he knows that it means something that has not only come to\r\nstay, but has come with conquering power.\r\n\r\nI get a little impatient sometimes about the discussion of the channels\r\nand methods by which it is to prevail. It is going to prevail, and that\r\nis a very superficial and ignorant view of it which attributes it to\r\nmere social unrest. It is not merely because the women are discontented.\r\nIt is because the women have seen visions of duty, and that is something\r\nwhich we not only cannot resist, but, if we be true Americans, we do not\r\nwish to resist. America took its origin in visions of the human spirit,\r\nin aspirations for the deepest sort of liberty of the mind and of the\r\nheart, and as visions of that sort come up to the sight of those who are\r\nspiritually minded in America, America comes more and more into her\r\nbirthright and into the perfection of her development.\r\n\r\nSo that what we have to realize in dealing with forces of this sort is\r\nthat we are dealing with the substance of life itself. I have felt as I\r\nsat here to-night the wholesome contagion of the occasion. Almost every\r\nother time that I ever visited Atlantic City, I came to fight somebody.\r\nI hardly know how to conduct myself when I have not come to fight\r\nagainst anybody, but with somebody. I have come to suggest, among other\r\nthings, that when the forces of nature are steadily working and the tide\r\nis rising to meet the moon, you need not be afraid that it will not come\r\nto its flood. We feel the tide; we rejoice in the strength of it; and we\r\nshall not quarrel in the long run as to the method of it. Because, when\r\nyou are working with masses of men and organized bodies of opinion, you\r\nhave got to carry the organized body along. The whole art and practice\r\nof government consists not in moving individuals, but in moving masses.\r\nIt is all very well to run ahead and beckon, but, after all, you have\r\ngot to wait for the body to follow. I have not come to ask you to be\r\npatient, because you have been, but I have come to congratulate you that\r\nthere was a force behind you that will beyond any peradventure be\r\ntriumphant, and for which you can afford a little while to wait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TERMS OF PEACE\r\n\r\n[Address to the Senate of the United States, delivered January 22,\r\n1917.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE:\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth of December last I addressed an identic note to the\r\ngovernments of the nations now at war requesting them to state, more\r\ndefinitely than they had yet been stated by either group of\r\nbelligerents, the terms upon which they would deem it possible to make\r\npeace. I spoke on behalf of humanity and of the rights of all neutral\r\nnations like our own, many of whose most vital interests the war puts in\r\nconstant jeopardy. The Central Powers united in a reply which stated\r\nmerely that they were ready to meet their antagonists in conference to\r\ndiscuss terms of peace. The Entente Powers have replied much more\r\ndefinitely and have stated, in general terms, indeed, but with\r\nsufficient definiteness to imply details, the arrangements, guarantees,\r\nand acts of reparation which they deem to be the indispensable\r\nconditions of a satisfactory settlement. We are that much nearer a\r\ndefinite discussion of the peace which shall end the present war. We are\r\nthat much nearer the discussion of the international concert which must\r\nthereafter hold the world at peace. In every discussion of the peace\r\nthat must end this war it is taken for granted that that peace must be\r\nfollowed by some definite concert of power which will make it virtually\r\nimpossible that any such catastrophe should ever overwhelm us again.\r\nEvery lover of mankind, every sane and thoughtful man must take that for\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\nI have sought this opportunity to address you because I thought that I\r\nowed it to you, as the council associated with me in the final\r\ndetermination of our international obligations, to disclose to you\r\nwithout reserve the thought and purpose that have been taking form in my\r\nmind in regard to the duty of our Government in the days to come when it\r\nwill be necessary to lay afresh and upon a new plan the foundations of\r\npeace among the nations.\r\n\r\nIt is inconceivable that the people of the United States should play no\r\npart in that great enterprise. To take part in such a service will be\r\nthe opportunity for which they have sought to prepare themselves by the\r\nvery principles and purposes of their polity and the approved practices\r\nof their Government ever since the days when they set up a new nation in\r\nthe high and honorable hope that it might in all that it was and did\r\nshow mankind the way to liberty. They cannot in honor withhold the\r\nservice to which they are now about to be challenged. They do not wish\r\nto withhold it. But they owe it to themselves and to the other nations\r\nof the world to state the conditions under which they will feel free to\r\nrender it.\r\n\r\nThat service is nothing less than this, to add their authority and their\r\npower to the authority and force of other nations to guarantee peace and\r\njustice throughout the world. Such a settlement cannot now be long\r\npostponed. It is right that before it comes this Government should\r\nfrankly formulate the conditions upon which it would feel justified in\r\nasking our people to approve its formal and solemn adherence to a League\r\nfor Peace. I am here to attempt to state those conditions.\r\n\r\nThe present war must first be ended; but we owe it to candor and to a\r\njust regard for the opinion of mankind to say that, so far as our\r\nparticipation in guarantees of future peace is concerned, it makes a\r\ngreat deal of difference in what way and upon what terms it is ended.\r\nThe treaties and agreements which bring it to an end must embody terms\r\nwhich will create a peace that is worth guaranteeing and preserving, a\r\npeace that will win the approval of mankind, not merely a peace that\r\nwill serve the several interests and immediate aims of the nations\r\nengaged. We shall have no voice in determining what those terms shall\r\nbe, but we shall, I feel sure, have a voice in determining whether they\r\nshall be made lasting or not by the guarantees of a universal covenant;\r\nand our judgment upon what is fundamental and essential as a condition\r\nprecedent to permanency should be spoken now, not afterwards when it may\r\nbe too late.\r\n\r\nNo covenant of cooeperative peace that does not include the peoples of\r\nthe New World can suffice to keep the future safe against war; and yet\r\nthere is only one sort of peace that the peoples of America could join\r\nin guaranteeing. The elements of that peace must be elements that engage\r\nthe confidence and satisfy the principles of the American governments,\r\nelements consistent with their political faith and with the practical\r\nconvictions which the peoples of America have once for all embraced and\r\nundertaken to defend.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say that any American government would throw any\r\nobstacle in the way of any terms of peace the governments now at war\r\nmight agree upon, or seek to upset them when made, whatever they might\r\nbe. I only take it for granted that mere terms of peace between the\r\nbelligerents will not satisfy even the belligerents themselves. Mere\r\nagreements may not make peace secure. It will be absolutely necessary\r\nthat a force be created as a guarantor of the permanency of the\r\nsettlement so much greater than the force of any nation now engaged or\r\nany alliance hitherto formed or projected that no nation, no probable\r\ncombination of nations could face or withstand it. If the peace\r\npresently to be made is to endure, it must be a peace made secure by the\r\norganized major force of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the immediate peace agreed upon will determine whether it\r\nis a peace for which such a guarantee can be secured. The question upon\r\nwhich the whole future peace and policy of the world depends is this: Is\r\nthe present war a struggle for a just and secure peace, or only for a\r\nnew balance of power? If it be only a struggle for a new balance of\r\npower, who will guarantee, who can guarantee, the stable equilibrium of\r\nthe new arrangement? Only a tranquil Europe can be a stable Europe.\r\nThere must be, not a balance of power, but a community of power; not\r\norganized rivalries, but an organized common peace.\r\n\r\nFortunately we have received very explicit assurances on this point. The\r\nstatesmen of both of the groups of nations now arrayed against one\r\nanother have said, in terms that could not be misinterpreted, that it\r\nwas no part of the purpose they had in mind to crush their antagonists.\r\nBut the implications of these assurances may not be equally clear to\r\nall,--may not be the same on both sides of the water. I think it will be\r\nserviceable if I attempt to set forth what we understand them to be.\r\n\r\nThey imply, first of all, that it must be a peace without victory. It is\r\nnot pleasant to say this. I beg that I may be permitted to put my own\r\ninterpretation upon it and that it may be understood that no other\r\ninterpretation was in my thought. I am seeking only to face realities\r\nand to face them without soft concealments. Victory would mean peace\r\nforced upon the loser, a victor's terms imposed upon the vanquished. It\r\nwould be accepted in humiliation, under duress, at an intolerable\r\nsacrifice, and would leave a sting, a resentment, a bitter memory upon\r\nwhich terms of peace would rest, not permanently, but only as upon\r\nquicksand. Only a peace between equals can last. Only a peace the very\r\nprinciple of which is equality and a common participation in a common\r\nbenefit. The right state of mind, the right feeling between nations, is\r\nas necessary for a lasting peace as is the just settlement of vexed\r\nquestions of territory or of racial and national allegiance.\r\n\r\nThe equality of nations upon which peace must be founded if it is to\r\nlast must be an equality of rights; the guarantees exchanged must\r\nneither recognize nor imply a difference between big nations and small,\r\nbetween those that are powerful and those that are weak. Right must be\r\nbased upon the common strength, not upon the individual strength, of the\r\nnations upon whose concert peace will depend. Equality of territory or\r\nof resources there of course cannot be; nor any other sort of equality\r\nnot gained in the ordinary peaceful and legitimate development of the\r\npeoples themselves. But no one asks or expects anything more than an\r\nequality of rights. Mankind is looking now for freedom of life, not for\r\nequipoises of power.\r\n\r\nAnd there is a deeper thing involved than even equality of right among\r\norganized nations. No peace can last, or ought to last, which does not\r\nrecognize and accept the principle that governments derive all their\r\njust powers from the consent of the governed, and that no right anywhere\r\nexists to hand peoples about from sovereignty to sovereignty as if they\r\nwere property. I take it for granted, for instance, if I may venture\r\nupon a single example, that statesmen everywhere are agreed that there\r\nshould be a united, independent, and autonomous Poland, and that\r\nhenceforth inviolable security of life, of worship, and of industrial\r\nand social development should be guaranteed to all peoples who have\r\nlived hitherto under the power of governments devoted to a faith and\r\npurpose hostile to their own.\r\n\r\nI speak of this, not because of any desire to exalt an abstract\r\npolitical principle which has always been held very dear by those who\r\nhave sought to build up liberty in America, but for the same reason that\r\nI have spoken of the other conditions of peace which seem to me clearly\r\nindispensable,--because I wish frankly to uncover realities. Any peace\r\nwhich does not recognize and accept this principle will inevitably be\r\nupset. It will not rest upon the affections or the convictions of\r\nmankind. The ferment of spirit of whole populations will fight subtly\r\nand constantly against it, and all the world will sympathize. The world\r\ncan be at peace only if its life is stable, and there can be no\r\nstability where the will is in rebellion, where there is not\r\ntranquillity of spirit and a sense of justice, of freedom, and of right.\r\n\r\nSo far as practicable, moreover, every great people now struggling\r\ntowards a full development of its resources and of its powers should be\r\nassured a direct outlet to the great highways of the sea. Where this\r\ncannot be done by the cession of territory, it can no doubt be done by\r\nthe neutralization of direct rights of way under the general guarantee\r\nwhich will assure the peace itself. With a right comity of arrangement\r\nno nation need be shut away from free access to the open paths of the\r\nworld's commerce.\r\n\r\nAnd the paths of the sea must alike in law and in fact be free. The\r\nfreedom of the seas is the _sine qua non_ of peace, equality, and\r\ncooeperation. No doubt a somewhat radical reconsideration of many of the\r\nrules of international practice hitherto thought to be established may\r\nbe necessary in order to make the seas indeed free and common in\r\npractically all circumstances for the use of mankind, but the motive for\r\nsuch changes is convincing and compelling. There can be no trust or\r\nintimacy between the peoples of the world without them. The free,\r\nconstant, unthreatened intercourse of nations is an essential part of\r\nthe process of peace and of development. It need not be difficult either\r\nto define or to secure the freedom of the seas if the governments of the\r\nworld sincerely desire to come to an agreement concerning it.\r\n\r\nIt is a problem closely connected with the limitation of naval armaments\r\nand the cooeperation of the navies of the world in keeping the seas at\r\nonce free and safe. And the question of limiting naval armaments opens\r\nthe wider and perhaps more difficult question of the limitation of\r\narmies and of all programs of military preparation. Difficult and\r\ndelicate as these questions are, they must be faced with the utmost\r\ncandor and decided in a spirit of real accommodation if peace is to come\r\nwith healing in its wings, and come to stay. Peace cannot be had without\r\nconcession and sacrifice. There can be no sense of safety and equality\r\namong the nations if great preponderating armaments are henceforth to\r\ncontinue here and there to be built up and maintained. The statesmen of\r\nthe world must plan for peace and nations must adjust and accommodate\r\ntheir policy to it as they have planned for war and made ready for\r\npitiless contest and rivalry. The question of armaments, whether on land\r\nor sea, is the most immediately and intensely practical question\r\nconnected with the future fortunes of nations and of mankind.\r\n\r\nI have spoken upon these great matters without reserve and with the\r\nutmost explicitness because it has seemed to me to be necessary if the\r\nworld's yearning desire for peace was anywhere to find free voice and\r\nutterance. Perhaps I am the only person in high authority amongst all\r\nthe peoples of the world who is at liberty to speak and hold nothing\r\nback. I am speaking as an individual, and yet I am speaking also, of\r\ncourse, as the responsible head of a great government, and I feel\r\nconfident that I have said what the people of the United States would\r\nwish me to say. May I not add that I hope and believe that I am in\r\neffect speaking for liberals and friends of humanity in every nation and\r\nof every program of liberty? I would fain believe that I am speaking for\r\nthe silent mass of mankind everywhere who have as yet had no place or\r\nopportunity to speak their real hearts out concerning the death and ruin\r\nthey see to have come already upon the persons and the homes they hold\r\nmost dear.\r\n\r\nAnd in holding out the expectation that the people and Government of the\r\nUnited States will join the other civilized nations of the world in\r\nguaranteeing the permanence of peace upon such terms as I have named I\r\nspeak with the greater boldness and confidence because it is clear to\r\nevery man who can think that there is in this promise no breach in\r\neither our traditions or our policy as a nation, but a fulfilment,\r\nrather, of all that we have professed or striven for.\r\n\r\nI am proposing, as it were, that the nations should with one accord\r\nadopt the doctrine of President Monroe as the doctrine of the world:\r\nthat no nation should seek to extend its polity over any other nation or\r\npeople, but that every people should be left free to determine its own\r\npolity, its own way of development, unhindered, unthreatened, unafraid,\r\nthe little along with the great and powerful.\r\n\r\nI am proposing that all nations henceforth avoid entangling alliances\r\nwhich would draw them into competitions of power, catch them in a net of\r\nintrigue and selfish rivalry, and disturb their own affairs with\r\ninfluences intruded from without. There is no entangling alliance in a\r\nconcert of power. When all unite to act in the same sense and with the\r\nsame purpose all act in the common interest and are free to live their\r\nown lives under a common protection.\r\n\r\nI am proposing government by the consent of the governed; that freedom\r\nof the seas which in international conference after conference\r\nrepresentatives of the United States have urged with the eloquence of\r\nthose who are the convinced disciples of liberty; and that moderation of\r\narmaments which makes of armies and navies a power for order merely, not\r\nan instrument of aggression or of selfish violence.\r\n\r\nThese are American principles, American policies. We could stand for no\r\nothers. And they are also the principles and policies of forward looking\r\nmen and women everywhere, of every modern nation, of every enlightened\r\ncommunity. They are the principles of mankind and must prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEETING GERMANY'S CHALLENGE\r\n\r\n[Address delivered at a joint session of the two Houses of Congress,\r\nFebruary 3, 1917.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nThe Imperial German Government on the thirty-first of January announced\r\nto this Government and to the governments of the other neutral nations\r\nthat on and after the first day of February, the present month, it would\r\nadopt a policy with regard to the use of submarines against all shipping\r\nseeking to pass through certain designated areas of the high seas to\r\nwhich it is clearly my duty to call your attention.\r\n\r\nLet me remind the Congress that on the eighteenth of April last, in view\r\nof the sinking on the twenty-fourth of March of the cross-Channel\r\npassenger steamer _Sussex_ by a German submarine, without summons or\r\nwarning, and the consequent loss of the lives of several citizens of the\r\nUnited States who were passengers aboard her, this Government addressed\r\na note to the Imperial German Government in which it made the following\r\ndeclaration:\r\n\r\n\"If it is still the purpose of the Imperial Government to prosecute\r\nrelentless and indiscriminate warfare against vessels of commerce by the\r\nuse of submarines without regard to what the Government of the United\r\nStates must consider the sacred and indisputable rules of international\r\nlaw and the universally recognized dictates of humanity, the Government\r\nof the United States is at last forced to the conclusion that there is\r\nbut one course it can pursue. Unless the Imperial Government should now\r\nimmediately declare and effect an abandonment of its present methods of\r\nsubmarine warfare against passenger and freight-carrying vessels, the\r\nGovernment of the United States can have no choice but to sever\r\ndiplomatic relations with the German Empire altogether.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to this declaration the Imperial German Government gave this\r\nGovernment the following assurance:\r\n\r\n\"The German Government is prepared to do its utmost to confine the\r\noperations of war for the rest of its duration to the fighting forces of\r\nthe belligerents, thereby also insuring the freedom of the seas, a\r\nprinciple upon which the German Government believes, now as before, to\r\nbe in agreement with the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The German Government, guided by this idea, notifies the Government of\r\nthe United States that the German naval forces have received the\r\nfollowing orders: In accordance with the general principles of visit and\r\nsearch and destruction of merchant vessels recognized by international\r\nlaw, such vessels, both within and without the area declared as naval\r\nwar zone, shall not be sunk without warning and without saving human\r\nlives, unless these ships attempt to escape or offer resistance.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" it added, \"neutrals cannot expect that Germany, forced to fight\r\nfor her existence, shall, for the sake of neutral interest, restrict the\r\nuse of an effective weapon if her enemy is permitted to continue to\r\napply at will methods of warfare violating the rules of international\r\nlaw. Such a demand would be incompatible with the character of\r\nneutrality, and the German Government is convinced that the Government\r\nof the United States does not think of making such a demand, knowing\r\nthat the Government of the United States has repeatedly declared that it\r\nis determined to restore the principle of the freedom of the seas, from\r\nwhatever quarter it has been violated.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the Government of the United States replied on the eighth of\r\nMay, accepting, of course, the assurances given, but adding,\r\n\r\n\"The Government of the United States feels it necessary to state that it\r\ntakes it for granted that the Imperial German Government does not intend\r\nto imply that the maintenance of its newly announced policy is in any\r\nway contingent upon the course or result of diplomatic negotiations\r\nbetween the Government of the United States and any other belligerent\r\nGovernment, notwithstanding the fact that certain passages in the\r\nImperial Government's note of the fourth instant might appear to be\r\nsusceptible of that construction. In order, however, to avoid any\r\npossible misunderstanding, the Government of the United States notifies\r\nthe Imperial Government that it cannot for a moment entertain, much less\r\ndiscuss, a suggestion that respect by German naval authorities for the\r\nrights of citizens of the United States upon the high seas should in any\r\nway or in the slightest degree be made contingent upon the conduct of\r\nany other Government affecting the rights of neutrals and\r\nnon-combatants. Responsibility in such matters is single, not joint;\r\nabsolute, not relative.\"\r\n\r\nTo this note of the eighth of May the Imperial German Government made no\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nOn the thirty-first of January, the Wednesday of the present week, the\r\nGerman Ambassador handed to the Secretary of State, along with a formal\r\nnote, a memorandum which contains the following statement:\r\n\r\n\"The Imperial Government, therefore, does not doubt that the Government\r\nof the United States will understand the situation thus forced upon\r\nGermany by the Entente-Allies' brutal methods of war and by their\r\ndetermination to destroy the Central Powers, and that the Government of\r\nthe United States will further realize that the now openly disclosed\r\nintentions of the Entente-Allies give back to Germany the freedom of\r\naction which she reserved in her note addressed to the Government of the\r\nUnited States on May 4, 1916.\r\n\r\n\"Under these circumstances Germany will meet the illegal measures of her\r\nenemies by forcibly preventing after February 1, 1917, in a zone around\r\nGreat Britain, France, Italy, and in the Eastern Mediterranean all\r\nnavigation, that of neutrals included, from and to England and from and\r\nto France, etc., etc. All ships met within the zone will be sunk.\"\r\n\r\nI think that you will agree with me that, in view of this declaration,\r\nwhich suddenly and without prior intimation of any kind deliberately\r\nwithdraws the solemn assurance given in the Imperial Government's note\r\nof the fourth of May, 1916, this Government has no alternative\r\nconsistent with the dignity and honor of the United States but to take\r\nthe course which, in its note of the eighteenth of April, 1916, it\r\nannounced that it would take in the event that the German Government did\r\nnot declare and effect an abandonment of the methods of submarine\r\nwarfare which it was then employing and to which it now purposes again\r\nto resort.\r\n\r\nI have, therefore, directed the Secretary of State to announce to His\r\nExcellency the German Ambassador that all diplomatic relations between\r\nthe United States and the German Empire are severed, and that the\r\nAmerican Ambassador at Berlin will immediately be withdrawn; and, in\r\naccordance with this decision, to hand to His Excellency his passports.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this unexpected action of the German Government, this\r\nsudden and deeply deplorable renunciation of its assurances, given this\r\nGovernment at one of the most critical moments of tension in the\r\nrelations of the two governments, I refuse to believe that it is the\r\nintention of the German authorities to do in fact what they have warned\r\nus they will feel at liberty to do. I cannot bring myself to believe\r\nthat they will indeed pay no regard to the ancient friendship between\r\ntheir people and our own or to the solemn obligations which have been\r\nexchanged between them and destroy American ships and take the lives of\r\nAmerican citizens in the willful prosecution of the ruthless naval\r\nprogram they have announced their intention to adopt. Only actual overt\r\nacts on their part can make me believe it even now.\r\n\r\nIf this inveterate confidence on my part in the sobriety and prudent\r\nforesight of their purpose should unhappily prove unfounded; if American\r\nships and American lives should in fact be sacrificed by their naval\r\ncommanders in heedless contravention of the just and reasonable\r\nunderstandings of international law and the obvious dictates of\r\nhumanity, I shall take the liberty of coming again before the Congress,\r\nto ask that authority be given me to use any means that may be necessary\r\nfor the protection of our seamen and our people in the prosecution of\r\ntheir peaceful and legitimate errands on the high seas. I can do nothing\r\nless. I take it for granted that all neutral governments will take the\r\nsame course.\r\n\r\nWe do not desire any hostile conflict with the Imperial German\r\nGovernment. We are the sincere friends of the German people and\r\nearnestly desire to remain at peace with the Government which speaks for\r\nthem. We shall not believe that they are hostile to us unless and until\r\nwe are obliged to believe it; and we purpose nothing more than the\r\nreasonable defense of the undoubted rights of our people. We wish to\r\nserve no selfish ends. We seek merely to stand true alike in thought and\r\nin action to the immemorial principles of our people which I sought to\r\nexpress in my address to the Senate only two weeks ago,--seek merely to\r\nvindicate our right to liberty and justice and an unmolested life. These\r\nare the bases of peace, not war. God grant we may not be challenged to\r\ndefend them by acts of wilful injustice on the part of the Government of\r\nGermany!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR AUTHORITY\r\n\r\n[Address delivered at a joint session of the two Houses of Congress,\r\nFebruary 26, 1917.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nI have again asked the privilege of addressing you because we are moving\r\nthrough critical times during which it seems to me to be my duty to keep\r\nin close touch with the Houses of Congress, so that neither counsel nor\r\naction shall run at cross purposes between us.\r\n\r\nOn the third of February I officially informed you of the sudden and\r\nunexpected action of the Imperial German Government in declaring its\r\nintention to disregard the promises it had made to this Government in\r\nApril last and undertake immediate submarine operations against all\r\ncommerce, whether of belligerents or of neutrals, that should seek to\r\napproach Great Britain and Ireland, the Atlantic coasts of Europe, or\r\nthe harbors of the eastern Mediterranean, and to conduct those\r\noperations without regard to the established restrictions of\r\ninternational practice, without regard to any considerations of humanity\r\neven which might interfere with their object. That policy was forthwith\r\nput into practice. It has now been in active execution for nearly four\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nIts practical results are not yet fully disclosed. The commerce of other\r\nneutral nations is suffering severely, but not, perhaps, very much more\r\nseverely than it was already suffering before the first of February,\r\nwhen the new policy of the Imperial Government was put into operation.\r\nWe have asked the cooeperation of the other neutral governments to\r\nprevent these depredations, but so far none of them has thought it wise\r\nto join us in any common course of action. Our own commerce has\r\nsuffered, is suffering, rather in apprehension than in fact, rather\r\nbecause so many of our ships are timidly keeping to their home ports\r\nthan because American ships have been sunk.\r\n\r\nTwo American vessels have been sunk, the _Housatonic_ and the _Lyman M.\r\nLaw_. The case of the _Housatonic,_ which was carrying food-stuffs\r\nconsigned to a London firm, was essentially like the case of the _Fry_,\r\nin which, it will be recalled, the German Government admitted its\r\nliability for damages, and the lives of the crew, as in the case of the\r\n_Fry_, were safeguarded with reasonable care. The case of the _Law_,\r\nwhich was carrying lemon-box staves to Palermo, disclosed a ruthlessness\r\nof method which deserves grave condemnation, but was accompanied by no\r\ncircumstances which might not have been expected at any time in\r\nconnection with the use of the submarine against merchantmen as the\r\nGerman Government has used it.\r\n\r\nIn sum, therefore, the situation we find ourselves in with regard to the\r\nactual conduct of the German submarine warfare against commerce and its\r\neffects upon our own ships and people is substantially the same that it\r\nwas when I addressed you on the third of February, except for the tying\r\nup of our shipping in our own ports because of the unwillingness of our\r\nshipowners to risk their vessels at sea without insurance or adequate\r\nprotection, and the very serious congestion of our commerce which has\r\nresulted, a congestion which is growing rapidly more and more serious\r\nevery day. This in itself might presently accomplish, in effect, what\r\nthe new German submarine orders were meant to accomplish, so far as we\r\nare concerned. We can only say, therefore, that the overt act which I\r\nhave ventured to hope the German commanders would in fact avoid has not\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nBut, while this is happily true, it must be admitted that there have\r\nbeen certain additional indications and expressions of purpose on the\r\npart of the German press and the German authorities which have increased\r\nrather than lessened the impression that, if our ships and our people\r\nare spared, it will be because of fortunate circumstances or because the\r\ncommanders of the German submarines which they may happen to encounter\r\nexercise an unexpected discretion and restraint rather than because of\r\nthe instructions under which those commanders are acting. It would be\r\nfoolish to deny that the situation is fraught with the gravest\r\npossibilities and dangers. No thoughtful man can fail to see that the\r\nnecessity for definite action may come at any time, if we are in fact,\r\nand not in word merely, to defend our elementary rights as a neutral\r\nnation. It would be most imprudent to be unprepared.\r\n\r\nI cannot in such circumstances be unmindful of the fact that the\r\nexpiration of the term of the present Congress is immediately at hand,\r\nby constitutional limitation; and that it would in all likelihood\r\nrequire an unusual length of time to assemble and organize the Congress\r\nwhich is to succeed it. I feel that I ought, in view of that fact, to\r\nobtain from you full and immediate assurance of the authority which I\r\nmay need at any moment to exercise. No doubt I already possess that\r\nauthority without special warrant of law, by the plain implication of my\r\nconstitutional duties and powers; but I prefer, in the present\r\ncircumstances, not to act upon general implication. I wish to feel that\r\nthe authority and the power of the Congress are behind me in whatever it\r\nmay become necessary for me to do. We are jointly the servants of the\r\npeople and must act together and in their spirit, so far as we can\r\ndivine and interpret it.\r\n\r\nNo one doubts what it is our duty to do. We must defend our commerce\r\nand the lives of our people in the midst of the present trying\r\ncircumstances, with discretion but with clear and steadfast purpose.\r\nOnly the method and the extent remain to be chosen, upon the occasion,\r\nif occasion should indeed arise. Since it has unhappily proved\r\nimpossible to safeguard our neutral rights by diplomatic means against\r\nthe unwarranted infringements they are suffering at the hands of\r\nGermany, there may be no recourse but to _armed_ neutrality, which we\r\nshall know how to maintain and for which there is abundant American\r\nprecedent.\r\n\r\nIt is devoutly to be hoped that it will not be necessary to put armed\r\nforce anywhere into action. The American people do not desire it, and\r\nour desire is not different from theirs. I am sure that they will\r\nunderstand the spirit in which I am now acting, the purpose I hold\r\nnearest my heart and would wish to exhibit in everything I do. I am\r\nanxious that the people of the nations at war also should understand and\r\nnot mistrust us. I hope that I need give no further proofs and\r\nassurances than I have already given throughout nearly three years of\r\nanxious patience that I am the friend of peace and mean to preserve it\r\nfor America so long as I am able. I am not now proposing or\r\ncontemplating war or any steps that need lead to it. I merely request\r\nthat you will accord me by your own vote and definite bestowal the means\r\nand the authority to safeguard in practice the right of a great people\r\nwho are at peace and who are desirous of exercising none but the rights\r\nof peace to follow the pursuits of peace in quietness and good\r\nwill,--rights recognized time out of mind by all the civilized nations\r\nof the world. No course of my choosing or of theirs will lead to war.\r\nWar can come only by the wilful acts and aggressions of others.\r\n\r\nYou will understand why I can make no definite proposals or forecasts\r\nof action now and must ask for your supporting authority in the most\r\ngeneral terms. The form in which action may become necessary cannot yet\r\nbe foreseen. I believe that the people will be willing to trust me to\r\nact with restraint, with prudence, and in the true spirit of amity and\r\ngood faith that they have themselves displayed throughout these trying\r\nmonths; and it is in that belief that I request that you will authorize\r\nme to supply our merchant ships with defensive arms, should that become\r\nnecessary, and with the means of using them, and to employ any other\r\ninstrumentalities or methods that may be necessary and adequate to\r\nprotect our ships and our people in their legitimate and peaceful\r\npursuits on the seas. I request also that you will grant me at the same\r\ntime, along with the powers I ask, a sufficient credit to enable me to\r\nprovide adequate means of protection where they are lacking, including\r\nadequate insurance against the present war risks.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of our commerce and of the legitimate errands of our\r\npeople on the seas, but you will not be misled as to my main thought,\r\nthe thought that lies beneath these phrases and gives them dignity and\r\nweight. It is not of material interests merely that we are thinking. It\r\nis, rather, of fundamental human rights, chief of all the right of life\r\nitself. I am thinking, not only of the rights of Americans to go and\r\ncome about their proper business by way of the sea, but also of\r\nsomething much deeper, much more fundamental than that. I am thinking of\r\nthose rights of humanity without which there is no civilization. My\r\ntheme is of those great principles of compassion and of protection which\r\nmankind has sought to throw about human lives, the lives of\r\nnon-combatants, the lives of men who are peacefully at work keeping the\r\nindustrial processes of the world quick and vital, the lives of women\r\nand children and of those who supply the labor which ministers to their\r\nsustenance. We are speaking of no selfish material rights but of rights\r\nwhich our hearts support and whose foundation is that righteous passion\r\nfor justice upon which all law, all structures alike of family, of\r\nstate, and of mankind must rest, as upon the ultimate base of our\r\nexistence and our liberty. I cannot imagine any man with American\r\nprinciples at his heart hesitating to defend these things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\n[Washington, March 4, 1917.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FELLOW-CITIZENS:\r\n\r\nThe four years which have elapsed since last I stood in this place have\r\nbeen crowded with counsel and action of the most vital interest and\r\nconsequence. Perhaps no equal period in our history has been so fruitful\r\nof important reforms in our economic and industrial life or so full of\r\nsignificant changes in the spirit and purpose of our political action.\r\nWe have sought very thoughtfully to set our house in order, correct the\r\ngrosser errors and abuses of our industrial life, liberate and quicken\r\nthe processes of our national genius and energy, and lift our politics\r\nto a broader view of the people's essential interests. It is a record of\r\nsingular variety and singular distinction. But I shall not attempt to\r\nreview it. It speaks for itself and will be of increasing influence as\r\nthe years go by. This is not the time for retrospect. It is time,\r\nrather, to speak our thoughts and purposes concerning the present and\r\nthe immediate future.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have centered counsel and action with such unusual\r\nconcentration and success upon the great problems of domestic\r\nlegislation to which we addressed ourselves four years ago, other\r\nmatters have more and more forced themselves upon our attention, matters\r\nlying outside our own life as a nation and over which we had no control,\r\nbut which, despite our wish to keep free of them, have drawn us more and\r\nmore irresistibly into their own current and influence.\r\n\r\nIt has been impossible to avoid them. They have affected the life of\r\nthe whole world. They have shaken men everywhere with a passion and an\r\napprehension they never knew before. It has been hard to preserve calm\r\ncounsel while the thought of our own people swayed this way and that\r\nunder their influence. We are a composite and cosmopolitan people. We\r\nare of the blood of all the nations that are at war. The currents of our\r\nthoughts as well as the currents of our trade run quick at all seasons\r\nback and forth between us and them. The war inevitably set its mark from\r\nthe first alike upon our minds, our industries, our commerce, our\r\npolitics, and our social action. To be indifferent to it or independent\r\nof it was out of the question.\r\n\r\nAnd yet all the while we have been conscious that we were not part of\r\nit. In that consciousness, despite many divisions, we have drawn closer\r\ntogether. We have been deeply wronged upon the seas, but we have not\r\nwished to wrong or injure in return; have retained throughout the\r\nconsciousness of standing in some sort apart, intent upon an interest\r\nthat transcended the immediate issues of the war itself. As some of the\r\ninjuries done us have become intolerable we have still been clear that\r\nwe wished nothing for ourselves that we were not ready to demand for all\r\nmankind,--fair dealing, justice, the freedom to live and be at ease\r\nagainst organized wrong.\r\n\r\nIt is in this spirit and with this thought that we have grown more and\r\nmore aware, more and more certain that the part we wished to play was\r\nthe part of those who mean to vindicate and fortify peace. We have been\r\nobliged to arm ourselves to make good our claim to a certain minimum of\r\nright and of freedom of action. We stand firm in armed neutrality since\r\nit seems that in no other way we can demonstrate what it is we insist\r\nupon and cannot forego. We may even be drawn on, by circumstances, not\r\nby our own purpose or desire, to a more active assertion of our rights\r\nas we see them and a more immediate association with the great struggle\r\nitself. But nothing will alter our thought or our purpose. They are too\r\nclear to be obscured. They are too deeply rooted in the principles of\r\nour national life to be altered. We desire neither conquest nor\r\nadvantage. We wish nothing that can be had only at the cost of another\r\npeople. We have always professed unselfish purpose and we covet the\r\nopportunity to prove that our professions are sincere.\r\n\r\nThere are many things still to do at home, to clarify our own politics\r\nand give new vitality to the industrial processes of our own life, and\r\nwe shall do them as time and opportunity serve; but we realize that the\r\ngreatest things that remain to be done must be done with the whole world\r\nfor stage and in cooeperation with the wide, and universal forces of\r\nmankind, and we are making our spirits ready for those things. They will\r\nfollow in the immediate wake of the war itself and will set civilization\r\nup again. We are provincials no longer. The tragical events of the\r\nthirty months of vital turmoil through which we have just passed have\r\nmade us citizens of the world. There can be no turning back. Our own\r\nfortunes as a nation are involved, whether we would have it so or not.\r\n\r\nAnd yet we are not the less Americans on that account. We shall be the\r\nmore American if we but remain true to the principles in which we have\r\nbeen bred. They are not the principles of a province or of a single\r\ncontinent. We have known and boasted all along that they were the\r\nprinciples of a liberated mankind. These, therefore, are the things we\r\nshall stand for, whether in war or in peace:\r\n\r\nThat all nations are equally interested in the peace of the world and\r\nin the political stability of free peoples, and equally responsible for\r\ntheir maintenance;\r\n\r\nThat the essential principle of peace is the actual equality of nations\r\nin all matters of right or privilege;\r\n\r\nThat peace cannot securely or justly rest upon an armed balance of\r\npower;\r\n\r\nThat governments derive all their just powers from the consent of the\r\ngoverned and that no other powers should be supported by the common\r\nthought, purpose, or power of the family of nations.\r\n\r\nThat the seas should be equally free and safe for the use of all\r\npeoples, under rules set up by common agreement and consent, and that,\r\nso far as practicable, they should be accessible to all upon equal\r\nterms;\r\n\r\nThat national armaments should be limited to the necessities of national\r\norder and domestic safety;\r\n\r\nThat the community of interest and of power upon which peace must\r\nhenceforth depend imposes upon each nation the duty of seeing to it that\r\nall influences proceeding from its own citizens meant to encourage or\r\nassist revolution in other states should be sternly and effectually\r\nsuppressed and prevented.\r\n\r\nI need not argue these principles to you, my fellow-countrymen: they are\r\nyour own, part and parcel of your own thinking and your own motive in\r\naffairs. They spring up native amongst us. Upon this as a platform of\r\npurpose and of action we can stand together.\r\n\r\nAnd it is imperative that we should stand together. We are being forged\r\ninto a new unity amidst the fires that now blaze throughout the world.\r\nIn their ardent heat we shall, in God's providence, let us hope, be\r\npurged of faction and division, purified of the errant humors of party\r\nand of private interest, and shall stand forth in the days to come with\r\na new dignity of national pride and spirit. Let each man see to it that\r\nthe dedication is in his own heart, the high purpose of the Nation in\r\nhis own mind, ruler of his own will and desire.\r\n\r\nI stand here and have taken the high and solemn oath to which you have\r\nbeen audience because the people of the United States have chosen me for\r\nthis august delegation of power and have by their gracious judgment\r\nnamed me their leader in affairs. I know now what the task means. I\r\nrealize to the full the responsibility which it involves. I pray God I\r\nmay be given the wisdom and the prudence to do my duty in the true\r\nspirit of this great people. I am their servant and can succeed only as\r\nthey sustain and guide me by their confidence and their counsel. The\r\nthing I shall count upon, the thing without which neither counsel nor\r\naction will avail, is the unity of America,--an America united in\r\nfeeling, in purpose, and in its vision of duty, of opportunity, and of\r\nservice. We are to beware of all men who would turn the tasks and the\r\nnecessities of the Nation to their own private profit or use them for\r\nthe building up of private power; beware that no faction or disloyal\r\nintrigue break the harmony or embarrass the spirit of our people; beware\r\nthat our Government be kept pure and incorrupt in all its parts. United\r\nalike in the conception of our duty and in the high resolve to perform\r\nit in the face of all men, let us dedicate ourselves to the great task\r\nto which we must now set our hand. For myself I beg your tolerance, your\r\ncountenance, and your united aid. The shadows that now lie dark upon our\r\npath will soon be dispelled and we shall walk with the light all about\r\nus if we be but true to ourselves,--to ourselves as we have wished to be\r\nknown in the counsels of the world and in the thought of all those who\r\nlove liberty and justice and the right exalted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CALL TO WAR\r\n\r\n[Address delivered at a joint session of the two Houses of Congress,\r\nApril 2, 1917.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nI have called the Congress into extraordinary session because there are\r\nserious, very serious, choices of policy to be made, and made\r\nimmediately, which it was neither right nor constitutionally permissible\r\nthat I should assume the responsibility of making.\r\n\r\nOn the third of February last I officially laid before you the\r\nextraordinary announcement of the Imperial German Government that on and\r\nafter the first day of February it was its purpose to put aside all\r\nrestraints of law or of humanity and use its submarines to sink every\r\nvessel that sought to approach either the ports of Great Britain and\r\nIreland or the western coasts of Europe or any of the ports controlled\r\nby the enemies of Germany within the Mediterranean. That had seemed to\r\nbe the object of the German submarine warfare earlier in the war, but\r\nsince April of last year the Imperial Government had somewhat restrained\r\nthe commanders of its undersea craft in conformity with its promise then\r\ngiven to us that passenger boats should not be sunk and that due warning\r\nwould be given to all other vessels which its submarines might seek to\r\ndestroy, when no resistance was offered or escape attempted, and care\r\ntaken that their crews were given at least a fair chance to save their\r\nlives in their open boats. The precautions taken were meager and\r\nhaphazard enough, as was proved in distressing instance after instance\r\nin the progress of the cruel and unmanly business, but a certain degree\r\nof restraint was observed. The new policy has swept every restriction\r\naside. Vessels of every kind, whatever their flag, their character,\r\ntheir cargo, their destination, their errand, have been ruthlessly sent\r\nto the bottom without warning and without thought of help or mercy for\r\nthose on board, the vessels of friendly neutrals along with those of\r\nbelligerents. Even hospital ships and ships carrying relief to the\r\nsorely bereaved and stricken people of Belgium, though the latter were\r\nprovided with safe conduct through the proscribed areas by the German\r\nGovernment itself and were distinguished by unmistakable marks of\r\nidentity, have been sunk with the same reckless lack of compassion or of\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nI was for a little while unable to believe that such things would in\r\nfact be done by any government that had hitherto subscribed to the\r\nhumane practices of civilized nations. International law had its origin\r\nin the attempt to set up some law which would be respected and observed\r\nupon the seas, where no nation had right of dominion and where lay the\r\nfree highways of the world. By painful stage after stage has that law\r\nbeen built up, with meager enough results, indeed, after all was\r\naccomplished that could be accomplished, but always with a clear view,\r\nat least, of what the heart and conscience of mankind demanded. This\r\nminimum of right the German Government has swept aside under the plea of\r\nretaliation and necessity and because it had no weapons which it could\r\nuse at sea except these which it is impossible to employ as it is\r\nemploying them without throwing to the winds all scruples of humanity or\r\nof respect for the understandings that were supposed to underlie the\r\nintercourse of the world. I am not now thinking of the loss of property\r\ninvolved, immense and serious as that is, but only of the wanton and\r\nwholesale destruction of the lives of non-combatants, men, women, and\r\nchildren, engaged in pursuits which have always, even in the darkest\r\nperiods of modern history, been deemed innocent and legitimate. Property\r\ncan be paid for; the lives of peaceful and innocent people cannot be.\r\nThe present German submarine warfare against commerce is a warfare\r\nagainst mankind.\r\n\r\nIt is a war against all nations. American ships have been sunk, American\r\nlives taken, in ways which it has stirred us very deeply to learn of,\r\nbut the ships and people of other neutral and friendly nations have been\r\nsunk and overwhelmed in the waters in the same way. There has been no\r\ndiscrimination. The challenge is to all mankind. Each nation must decide\r\nfor itself how it will meet it. The choice we make for ourselves must be\r\nmade with a moderation of counsel and a temperateness of judgment\r\nbefitting our character and our motives as a nation. We must put excited\r\nfeeling away. Our motive will not be revenge or the victorious assertion\r\nof the physical might of the nation, but only the vindication of right,\r\nof human right, of which we are only a single champion.\r\n\r\nWhen I addressed the Congress on the twenty-sixth of February last I\r\nthought that it would suffice to assert our neutral rights with arms,\r\nour right to use the seas against unlawful interference, our right to\r\nkeep our people safe against unlawful violence. But armed neutrality, it\r\nnow appears, is impracticable. Because submarines are in effect outlaws\r\nwhen used as the German submarines have been used against merchant\r\nshipping, it is impossible to defend ships against their attacks as the\r\nlaw of nations has assumed that merchantmen would defend themselves\r\nagainst privateers or cruisers, visible craft giving chase upon the open\r\nsea. It is common prudence in such circumstances, grim, necessity\r\nindeed, to endeavor to destroy them before they have shown their own\r\nintention. They must be dealt with upon sight, if dealt with at all.\r\nThe German Government denies the right of neutrals to use arms at all\r\nwithin the areas of the sea which it has proscribed, even in the defense\r\nof rights which no modern publicist has ever before questioned their\r\nright to defend. The intimation is conveyed that the armed guards which\r\nwe have placed on our merchant ships will be treated as beyond the pale\r\nof law and subject to be dealt with as pirates would be. Armed\r\nneutrality is ineffectual enough at best; in such circumstances and in\r\nthe face of such pretensions it is worse than ineffectual: it is likely\r\nonly to produce what it was meant to prevent; it is practically certain\r\nto draw us into the war without either the rights or the effectiveness\r\nof belligerents. There is one choice we cannot make, we are incapable of\r\nmaking: we will not choose the path of submission and suffer the most\r\nsacred rights of our nation and our people to be ignored or violated.\r\nThe wrongs against which we now array ourselves are no common wrongs;\r\nthey cut to the very roots of human life.\r\n\r\nWith a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the\r\nstep I am taking and of the grave responsibilities which it involves,\r\nbut in unhesitating obedience to what I deem my constitutional duty, I\r\nadvise that the Congress declare the recent course of the Imperial\r\nGerman Government to be in fact nothing less than war against the\r\ngovernment and people of the United States; that it formally accept the\r\nstatus of belligerent which has thus been thrust upon it; and that it\r\ntake immediate steps not only to put the country in a more thorough\r\nstate of defense but also to exert all its power and employ all its\r\nresources to bring the Government of the German Empire to terms and end\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nWhat this will involve is clear. It will involve the utmost practicable\r\ncooeperation in counsel and action with the governments now at war with\r\nGermany, and, as incident to that, the extension to those governments of\r\nthe most liberal financial credits, in order that our resources may so\r\nfar as possible be added to theirs. It will involve the organization and\r\nmobilization of all the material resources of the country to supply the\r\nmaterials of war and serve the incidental needs of the nation in the\r\nmost abundant and yet the most economical and efficient way possible. It\r\nwill involve the immediate full equipment of the navy in all respects\r\nbut particularly in supplying it with the best means of dealing with the\r\nenemy's submarines. It will involve the immediate addition to the armed\r\nforces of the United States already provided for by law in case of war\r\nat least 500,000 men, who should, in my opinion, be chosen upon the\r\nprinciple of universal liability to service, and also the authorization\r\nof subsequent additional increments of equal force so soon as they may\r\nbe needed and can be handled in training. It will involve also, of\r\ncourse, the granting of adequate credits to the Government, sustained, I\r\nhope, so far as they can equitably be sustained by the present\r\ngeneration, by well conceived taxation.\r\n\r\nI say sustained so far as may be equitable by taxation because it seems\r\nto me that it would be most unwise to base the credits which will now be\r\nnecessary entirely on money borrowed. It is our duty, I most\r\nrespectfully urge, to protect our people so far as we may against the\r\nvery serious hardships and evils which would be likely to arise out of\r\nthe inflation which would be produced by vast loans.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out the measures by which these things are to be\r\naccomplished we should keep constantly in mind the wisdom of interfering\r\nas little as possible in our own preparation and in the equipment of\r\nour own military forces with the duty,--for it will be a very practical\r\nduty,--of supplying the nations already at war with Germany with the\r\nmaterials which they can obtain only from us or by our assistance. They\r\nare in the field and we should help them in every way to be effective\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nI shall take the liberty of suggesting, through the several executive\r\ndepartments of the Government, for the consideration of your committees,\r\nmeasures for the accomplishment of the several objects I have mentioned.\r\nI hope that it will be your pleasure to deal with them as having been\r\nframed after very careful thought by the branch of the Government upon\r\nwhich the responsibility of conducting the war and safeguarding the\r\nnation will most directly fall.\r\n\r\nWhile we do these things, these deeply momentous things, let us be very\r\nclear, and make very clear to all the world what our motives and our\r\nobjects are. My own thought has not been driven from its habitual and\r\nnormal course by the unhappy events of the last two months, and I do not\r\nbelieve that the thought of the nation has been altered or clouded by\r\nthem. I have exactly the same things in mind now that I had in mind when\r\nI addressed the Senate on the twenty-second of January last; the same\r\nthat I had in mind when I addressed the Congress on the third of\r\nFebruary and on the twenty-sixth of February. Our object now, as then,\r\nis to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the\r\nworld as against selfish, and autocratic power and to set up amongst the\r\nreally free and self-governed peoples of the world such a concert of\r\npurpose and of action as will henceforth ensure the observance of those\r\nprinciples. Neutrality is no longer feasible or desirable where the\r\npeace of the world is involved and the freedom of its peoples, and the\r\nmenace to that peace and freedom lies in the existence of autocratic\r\ngovernments backed by organized force which is controlled wholly by\r\ntheir will, not by the will of their people. We have seen the last of\r\nneutrality in such circumstances. We are at the beginning of an age in\r\nwhich it will be insisted that the same standards of conduct and of\r\nresponsibility for wrong done shall be observed among nations and their\r\ngovernments that are observed among the individual citizens of civilized\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nWe have no quarrel with the German people. We have no feeling towards\r\nthem but one of sympathy and friendship. It was not upon their impulse\r\nthat their government acted in entering this war. It was not with their\r\nprevious knowledge or approval. It was a war determined upon as wars\r\nused to be determined upon in the old, unhappy days when peoples were\r\nnowhere consulted by their rulers and wars were provoked and waged in\r\nthe interest of dynasties or of little groups of ambitious men who were\r\naccustomed to use their fellow-men as pawns and tools. Self-governed\r\nnations do not fill their neighbor states with spies or set the course\r\nof intrigue to bring about some critical posture of affairs which will\r\ngive them an opportunity to strike and make conquest. Such designs can\r\nbe successfully worked out only under cover and where no one has the\r\nright to ask questions. Cunningly contrived plans of deception or\r\naggression, carried, it may be, from generation to generation, can be\r\nworked out and kept from the light only within the privacy of courts or\r\nbehind the carefully guarded confidences of a narrow and privileged\r\nclass. They are happily impossible where public opinion commands and\r\ninsists upon full information concerning all the nation's affairs.\r\n\r\nA steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained except by a\r\npartnership of democratic nations. No autocratic government could be\r\ntrusted to keep faith within it or observe its covenants. It must be a\r\nleague of honor, a partnership of opinion. Intrigue would eat its vitals\r\naway; the plottings of inner circles who could plan what they would and\r\nrender account to no one would be a corruption seated at its very heart.\r\nOnly free peoples can hold their purpose and their honor steady to a\r\ncommon end and prefer the interests of mankind to any narrow interest of\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\nDoes not every American feel that assurance has been added to our hope\r\nfor the future peace of the world by the wonderful and heartening things\r\nthat have been happening within the last few weeks in Russia? Russia was\r\nknown by those who knew it best to have been always in fact democratic\r\nat heart, in all the vital habits of her thought, in all the intimate\r\nrelationships of her people that spoke their natural instinct, their\r\nhabitual attitude towards life. The autocracy that crowned the summit of\r\nher political structure, long as it had stood and terrible as was the\r\nreality of its power, was not in fact Russian in origin, character, or\r\npurpose; and now it has been shaken off and the great, generous Russian\r\npeople have been added in all their naive majesty and might to the\r\nforces that are fighting for freedom in the world, for justice, and for\r\npeace. Here is a fit partner for a League of Honor.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that has served to convince us that the Prussian\r\nautocracy was not and could never be our friend is that from the very\r\noutset of the present war it has filled our unsuspecting communities and\r\neven our offices of government with spies and set criminal intrigues\r\neverywhere afoot against our national unity of counsel, our peace within\r\nand without, our industries and our commerce. Indeed it is now evident\r\nthat its spies were here even before the war began; and it is unhappily\r\nnot a matter of conjecture but a fact proved in our courts of justice\r\nthat the intrigues which have more than once come perilously near to\r\ndisturbing the peace and dislocating the industries of the country have\r\nbeen carried on at the instigation, with the support, and even under the\r\npersonal direction of official agents of the Imperial Government\r\naccredited to the Government of the United States. Even in checking\r\nthese things and trying to extirpate them we have sought to put the most\r\ngenerous interpretation possible upon them because we knew that their\r\nsource lay, not in any hostile feeling or purpose of the German people\r\ntowards us (who were, no doubt as ignorant of them as we ourselves\r\nwere), but only in the selfish designs of a Government that did what it\r\npleased and told its people nothing. But they have played their part in\r\nserving to convince us at last that that Government entertains no real\r\nfriendship for us and means to act against our peace and security at its\r\nconvenience. That it means to stir up enemies against us at our very\r\ndoors the intercepted note to the German Minister at Mexico City is\r\neloquent evidence.\r\n\r\nWe are accepting this challenge of hostile purpose because we know that\r\nin such a government, following such methods, we can never have a\r\nfriend; and that in the presence of its organized power, always lying in\r\nwait to accomplish we know not what purpose, there can be no assured\r\nsecurity for the democratic governments of the world. We are now about\r\nto accept gauge of battle with this natural foe to liberty and shall, if\r\nnecessary, spend the whole force of the nation to check and nullify its\r\npretensions and its power. We are glad, now that we see the facts with\r\nno veil of false pretense about them, to fight thus for the ultimate\r\npeace of the world and for the liberation of its peoples, the German\r\npeoples included: for the rights of nations great and small and the\r\nprivilege of men everywhere to choose their way of life and of\r\nobedience. The world must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be\r\nplanted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no\r\nselfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no\r\nindemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices\r\nwe shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of\r\nmankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as\r\nsecure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.\r\n\r\nJust because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking\r\nnothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free\r\npeoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as\r\nbelligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio\r\nthe principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\r\n\r\nI have said nothing of the governments allied with the Imperial\r\nGovernment of Germany because they have not made war upon us or\r\nchallenged us to defend our right and our honor. The Austro-Hungarian\r\nGovernment has, indeed, avowed its unqualified endorsement and\r\nacceptance of the reckless and lawless submarine warfare adopted now\r\nwithout disguise by the Imperial German Government, and it has therefore\r\nnot been possible for this Government to receive Count Tarnowski, the\r\nAmbassador recently accredited to this Government by the Imperial and\r\nRoyal Government of Austria-Hungary; but that Government has not\r\nactually engaged in warfare against citizens of the United States on the\r\nseas, and I take the liberty, for the present at least, of postponing a\r\ndiscussion of our relations with the authorities at Vienna. We enter\r\nthis war only where we are clearly forced into it because there are no\r\nother means of defending our rights.\r\n\r\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in\r\na high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not\r\nin enmity towards a people or with the desire to bring any injury or\r\ndisadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible\r\ngovernment which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of\r\nright and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere\r\nfriends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the\r\nearly reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between\r\nus,--however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe\r\nthat this is spoken from our hearts. We have borne with their present\r\ngovernment through all these bitter months because of that\r\nfriendship,--exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise\r\nhave been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to\r\nprove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions towards the\r\nmillions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live\r\namongst us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it towards\r\nall who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the Government in\r\nthe hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as\r\nif they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be\r\nprompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be\r\nof a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will\r\nbe dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its\r\nhead at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance\r\nexcept from a lawless and malignant few.\r\n\r\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, Gentlemen of the Congress,\r\nwhich I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be,\r\nmany months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful\r\nthing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most\r\nterrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be\r\nin the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall\r\nfight for the things which we have always carried nearest our\r\nhearts,--for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority\r\nto have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties\r\nof small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of\r\nfree peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the\r\nworld itself at last free. To such a task we can dedicate our lives and\r\nour fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with\r\nthe pride of those who know that the day has come when America is\r\nprivileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave\r\nher birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured. God\r\nhelping her, she can do no other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\n[President Wilson's Address to his Fellow-Countrymen, April 16, 1917.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN:\r\n\r\nThe entrance of our own beloved country into the grim and terrible war\r\nfor democracy and human rights which has shaken the world creates so\r\nmany problems of national life and action which call for immediate\r\nconsideration and settlement that I hope you will permit me to address\r\nto you a few words of earnest counsel and appeal with regard to them.\r\n\r\nWe are rapidly putting our navy upon an effective war footing and are\r\nabout to create and equip a great army, but these are the simplest parts\r\nof the great task to which we have addressed ourselves. There is not a\r\nsingle selfish element, so far as I can see, in the cause we are\r\nfighting for. We are fighting for what we believe and wish to be the\r\nrights of mankind and for the future peace and security of the world. To\r\ndo this great thing worthily and successfully we must devote ourselves\r\nto the service without regard to profit or material advantage and with\r\nan energy and intelligence that will rise to the level of the enterprise\r\nitself. We must realize to the full how great the task is and how many\r\nthings, how many kinds and elements of capacity and service and\r\nself-sacrifice, it involves.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the things we must do, and do well, besides\r\nfighting,--the things without which mere fighting would be fruitless:\r\n\r\nWe must supply abundant food for ourselves and for our armies and our\r\nseamen not only, but also for a large part of the nations with whom we\r\nhave now made common cause, in whose support and by whose sides we shall\r\nbe fighting.\r\n\r\nWe must supply ships by the hundreds out of our shipyards to carry to\r\nthe other side of the sea, submarines or no submarines, what will every\r\nday be needed there, and abundant materials out of our fields and our\r\nmines and our factories with which not only to clothe and equip our own\r\nforces on land and sea but also to clothe and support our people for\r\nwhom the gallant fellows under arms can no longer work, to help clothe\r\nand equip the armies with which we are cooeperating in Europe, and to\r\nkeep the looms and manufactories there in raw material; coal to keep the\r\nfires going in ships at sea and in the furnaces of hundreds of factories\r\nacross the sea; steel out of which to make arms and ammunition both here\r\nand there; rails for worn-out railways back of the fighting fronts;\r\nlocomotives and rolling stock to take the place of those every day going\r\nto pieces; mules, horses, cattle for labor and for military service;\r\neverything with which the people of England and France and Italy and\r\nRussia have usually supplied themselves but cannot now afford the men,\r\nthe materials, or the machinery to make.\r\n\r\nIt is evident to every thinking man that our industries, on the farms,\r\nin the shipyards, in the mines, in the factories, must be made more\r\nprolific and more efficient than ever and that they must be more\r\neconomically managed and better adapted to the particular requirements\r\nof our task than they have been; and what I want to say is that the men\r\nand the women who devote their thought and their energy to these things\r\nwill be serving the country and conducting the fight for peace and\r\nfreedom just as truly and just as effectively as the men on the\r\nbattlefield or in the trenches. The industrial forces of the country,\r\nmen and women alike, will be a great national, a great international,\r\nService Army,--a notable and honored host engaged in the service of the\r\nnation and the world, the efficient friends and saviors of free men\r\neverywhere. Thousands, nay, hundreds of thousands, of men otherwise\r\nliable to military service will of right and of necessity be excused\r\nfrom that service and assigned to the fundamental, sustaining work of\r\nthe fields and factories and mines, and they will be as much part of the\r\ngreat patriotic forces of the nation as the men under fire.\r\n\r\nI take the liberty, therefore, of addressing this word to the farmers of\r\nthe country and to all who work on the farms: The supreme need of our\r\nown nation and of the nations with which we are cooeperating is an\r\nabundance of supplies, and especially of food-stuffs. The importance of\r\nan adequate food supply, especially for the present year, is\r\nsuperlative. Without abundant food, alike for the armies and the peoples\r\nnow at war, the whole great enterprise upon which we have embarked will\r\nbreak down and fail. The world's food reserves are low. Not only during\r\nthe present emergency but for some time after peace shall have come both\r\nour own people and a large proportion of the people of Europe must rely\r\nupon the harvests in America. Upon the farmers of this country,\r\ntherefore, in large measure, rests the fate of the war and the fate of\r\nthe nations. May the nation not count upon them to omit no step that\r\nwill increase the production of their land or that will bring about the\r\nmost effectual cooeperation in the sale and distribution of their\r\nproducts? The time is short. It is of the most imperative importance\r\nthat everything possible be done and done immediately to make sure of\r\nlarge harvests. I call upon young men and old alike and upon the\r\nable-bodied boys of the land to accept and act upon this duty--to turn\r\nin hosts to the farms and make certain that no pains and no labor is\r\nlacking in this great matter.\r\n\r\nI particularly appeal to the farmers of the South to plant abundant\r\nfood-stuffs as well as cotton. They can show their patriotism in no\r\nbetter or more convincing way than by resisting the great temptation of\r\nthe present price of cotton and helping, helping upon a great scale, to\r\nfeed the nation and the peoples everywhere who are fighting for their\r\nliberties and for our own. The variety of their crops will be the\r\nvisible measure of their comprehension of their national duty.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States and the governments of the several\r\nStates stand ready to cooeperate. They will do everything possible to\r\nassist farmers in securing an adequate supply of seed, an adequate force\r\nof laborers when they are most needed, at harvest time, and the means of\r\nexpediting shipments of fertilizers and farm machinery, as well as of\r\nthe crops themselves when harvested. The course of trade shall be as\r\nunhampered as it is possible to make it and there shall be no\r\nunwarranted manipulation of the nation's food supply by those who handle\r\nit on its way to the consumer. This is our opportunity to demonstrate\r\nthe efficiency of a great Democracy and we shall not fall short of it!\r\n\r\nThis let me say to the middlemen of every sort, whether they are\r\nhandling our food-stuffs or our raw materials of manufacture or the\r\nproducts of our mills and factories: The eyes of the country will be\r\nespecially upon you. This is your opportunity for signal service,\r\nefficient and disinterested. The country expects you, as it expects all\r\nothers, to forego unusual profits, to organize and expedite shipments of\r\nsupplies of every kind, but especially of food, with an eye to the\r\nservice you are rendering and in the spirit of those who enlist in the\r\nranks, for their people, not for themselves. I shall confidently expect\r\nyou to deserve and win the confidence of people of every sort and\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nTo the men who run the railways of the country, whether they be managers\r\nor operative employees, let me say that the railways are the arteries of\r\nthe nation's life and that upon them rests the immense responsibility of\r\nseeing to it that those arteries suffer no obstruction of any kind, no\r\ninefficiency or slackened power. To the merchant let me suggest the\r\nmotto, \"Small profits and quick service\"; and to the shipbuilder the\r\nthought that the life of the war depends upon him. The food and the war\r\nsupplies must be carried across the seas no matter how many ships are\r\nsent to the bottom. The places of those that go down must be supplied\r\nand supplied at once. To the miner let me say that he stands where the\r\nfarmer does: the work of the world waits on him. If he slackens or\r\nfails, armies and statesmen are helpless. He also is enlisted in the\r\ngreat Service Army. The manufacturer does not need to be told, I hope,\r\nthat the nation looks to him to speed and perfect every process; and I\r\nwant only to remind his employees that their service is absolutely\r\nindispensable and is counted on by every man who loves the country and\r\nits liberties.\r\n\r\nLet me suggest, also, that everyone who creates or cultivates a garden\r\nhelps, and helps greatly, to solve the problem of the feeding of the\r\nnations; and that every housewife who practices strict economy puts\r\nherself in the ranks of those who serve the nation. This is the time for\r\nAmerica to correct her unpardonable fault of wastefulness and\r\nextravagance. Let every man and every woman assume the duty of careful,\r\nprovident use and expenditure as a public duty, as a dictate of\r\npatriotism which no one can now expect ever to be excused or forgiven\r\nfor ignoring.\r\n\r\nIn the hope that this statement of the needs of the nation and of the\r\nworld in this hour of supreme crisis may stimulate those to whom it\r\ncomes and remind all who need reminder of the solemn duties of a time\r\nsuch as the world has never seen before, I beg that all editors and\r\npublishers everywhere will give as prominent publication and as wide\r\ncirculation as possible to this appeal. I venture to suggest, also, to\r\nall advertising agencies that they would perhaps render a very\r\nsubstantial and timely service to the country if they would give it\r\nwidespread repetition. And I hope that clergymen will not think the\r\ntheme of it an unworthy or inappropriate subject of comment and homily\r\nfrom their pulpits.\r\n\r\nThe supreme test of the nation has come. We must all speak, act, and\r\nserve together!\r\n\r\nWOODROW WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN PLOT\r\n\r\n[Speech in Washington Monument Grounds, June 14, 1917.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know now clearly, as we knew before we ourselves were engaged in the\r\nWar, that we are not enemies of the German people, and they are not our\r\nenemies. They did not originate, or desire, this hideous war, or wish\r\nthat we should be drawn into it, and we are vaguely conscious that we\r\nare fighting their cause, as they will some day see it themselves, as\r\nwell as our own. They themselves are in the grip of the same sinister\r\npower that has stretched its ugly talons out and drawn blood from us.\r\n\r\nThe War was begun by the military masters of Germany, who have proved\r\nthemselves to be also the masters of Austria-Hungary. These men never\r\nregarded nations as peoples of men, women, and children of like blood\r\nand frame as themselves, for whom Governments existed and in whom\r\nGovernments had their life. They regarded them merely as serviceable\r\norganizations, which they could, either by force or intrigue, bend or\r\ncorrupt to their own purpose. They regarded the smaller States,\r\nparticularly, and those peoples, who could be overwhelmed by force, as\r\ntheir natural tools and instruments of domination.\r\n\r\nTheir purpose had long been avowed. The statesmen of other nations, to\r\nwhom that purpose was incredible, paid little attention, and regarded\r\nwhat the German professors expounded in their class-rooms and the German\r\nwriters set forth to the world as the goal of German policy as rather\r\nthe dream of minds detached from practical affairs and the preposterous\r\nprivate conceptions of Germany's destiny than the actual plans of\r\nresponsible rulers. But the rulers of Germany knew all the while what\r\nconcrete plans, what well-advanced intrigue, lay at the back of what\r\nprofessors and writers were saying, and were glad to go forward\r\nunmolested, filling the thrones of the Balkan States with German\r\nprinces, putting German officers at the service of Turkey, developing\r\nplans of sedition and rebellion in India and Egypt, and setting their\r\nfires in Persia.\r\n\r\nThe demands made by Austria upon Serbia were a mere single step in the\r\nplan which compassed Europe and Asia from Berlin to Bagdad. They hoped\r\nthat these demands might not arouse Europe, but they meant to press\r\nthem, whether they did or not. For they thought themselves ready for the\r\nfinal issue of arms. Their plan was to throw a belt of German military\r\npower and political control across the very center of Europe and beyond\r\nthe Mediterranean into the heart of Asia, and Austria-Hungary was to be\r\nas much their tool and pawn as Serbia, Bulgaria, Turkey, or the\r\nponderous States of the East. Austria-Hungary, indeed, was to become a\r\npart of the Central German Empire, absorbed and dominated by the same\r\nforces and influences that originally cemented the German States\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe dream had its heart at Berlin. It could have had its heart nowhere\r\nelse. It rejected entirely the idea of the solidarity of race. The\r\nchoice of peoples played no part at all in the contemplated binding\r\ntogether of the racial and political units, which could keep together\r\nonly by force. And they actually carried the greater part of that\r\namazing plan into execution.\r\n\r\nLook how things stand. Austria, at their mercy, has acted, not upon its\r\nown initiative or upon the choice of its own people, but at Berlin's\r\ndictation ever since the War began. Its people now desire peace, but\r\nthey cannot have it until leave is granted from Berlin. The so-called\r\nCentral Powers are, in fact, but a single Power. Serbia is at its mercy\r\nshould its hand be but for a moment freed; Bulgaria consented to its\r\nwill; Rumania is overrun by the Turkish armies, which the Germans\r\ntrained into serving Germany, and the guns of the German warships lying\r\nin the harbor at Constantinople remind the Turkish statesmen every day\r\nthat they have no choice but to take their orders from Berlin.\r\n\r\nFrom Hamburg to the Persian Gulf the net is spread. Is it not easy to\r\nunderstand the eagerness for peace that has been manifested by Berlin\r\never since the snare was set and sprung? \"Peace, peace, peace\" has been\r\nthe talk of her Foreign Office for a year or more, not peace upon her\r\nown initiative, but upon the initiative of the nations over which she\r\nnow deems herself to hold the advantage. A little of the talk has been\r\npublic, but most of it has been private, through all sorts of channels.\r\nIt has come to me in all sorts of guises, but never with the terms\r\ndisclosed which the German Government would be willing to accept.\r\n\r\nThat Government has other valuable pawns in its hands besides those I\r\nhave mentioned. It still holds a valuable part of France, though with a\r\nslowly relaxing grasp, and practically the whole of Belgium. Its armies\r\npress close on Russia and overrun Poland. It cannot go farther--it dare\r\nnot go back. It wishes to close its bargain before it is too late and it\r\nhas little left to offer for the pound of flesh it will demand. The\r\nmilitary masters under whom Germany is bleeding see very clearly to what\r\npoint fate has brought them: if they fall back or are forced back an\r\ninch, their power abroad and at home will fall to pieces. It is their\r\npower at home of which they are thinking now more than of their power\r\nabroad. It is that power which is trembling under their very feet.\r\n\r\nDeep fear has entered their hearts. They have but one chance to\r\nperpetuate their military power, or even their controlling political\r\ninfluence. If they can secure peace now, with the immense advantage\r\nstill in their hands, they will have justified themselves before the\r\nGerman people. They will have gained by force what they promised to gain\r\nby it--an immense expansion of German power and an immense enlargement\r\nof German industrial and commercial opportunities. Their prestige will\r\nbe secure, and with their prestige their political power.\r\n\r\nIf they fail, their people will thrust them aside. A Government\r\naccountable to the people themselves will be set up in Germany, as has\r\nbeen the case in England, the United States, and France--in all great\r\ncountries of modern times except Germany. If they succeed they are safe,\r\nand Germany and the world are undone. If they fail, Germany is saved and\r\nthe world will be at peace. If they succeed, America will fall within\r\nthe menace, and we, and all the rest of the world, must remain armed, as\r\nthey will remain, and must make ready for the next step in their\r\naggression. If they fail, the world may unite for peace and Germany may\r\nbe of the union.\r\n\r\nDo you not now understand the new intrigue for peace, and why the\r\nmasters of Germany do not hesitate to use any agency that promises to\r\neffect their purpose, the deceit of nations? Their present particular\r\naim is to deceive all those who, throughout the world, stand for the\r\nrights of peoples and the self-government of nations, for they see what\r\nimmense strength the forces of justice and liberalism are gathering out\r\nof this war. They are employing Liberals in their enterprises. Let them\r\nonce succeed, and these men, now their tools, will be ground to powder\r\nbeneath the weight of the great military Empire; the Revolutionists of\r\nRussia will be cut off from all succour and the cooeperation of Western\r\nEurope, and a counter-revolution will be fostered and supported; Germany\r\nherself will lose her chance of freedom, and all Europe will arm for the\r\nnext final struggle.\r\n\r\nThe sinister intrigue is being no less actively conducted in this\r\ncountry than in Russia and in every country of Europe into which the\r\nagents and dupes of the Imperial German Government can get access. That\r\nGovernment has many spokesmen here, in places both high and low. They\r\nhave learned discretion; they keep within the law. It is opinion they\r\nutter now, not sedition. They proclaim the liberal purposes of their\r\nmasters, and they declare that this is a foreign war, which can touch\r\nAmerica with no danger either to her lands or institutions. They set\r\nEngland at the center of the stage, and talk of her ambition to assert\r\nher economic dominion throughout the world. They appeal to our ancient\r\ntradition of isolation, and seek to undermine the Government with false\r\nprofessions of loyalty to its principles.\r\n\r\nBut they will make no headway. Falsehood betrays them in every accent.\r\nThese facts are patent to all the world, and nowhere more plainly than\r\nin the United States, where we are accustomed to deal with facts, not\r\nsophistries; and the great fact that stands out above all the rest is\r\nthat this is a peoples' war for freedom, justice and self-government\r\namong all the nations of the world, a war to make the world safe for the\r\npeoples who live upon it, the German people included, and that with us\r\nrests the choice to break through all these hypocrisies, the patent\r\ncheats and masks of brute force, and help set the world free, or else\r\nstand aside and let it be dominated through sheer weight of arms and the\r\narbitrary choices of the self-constituted masters by the nation which\r\ncan maintain the biggest armies, the most irresistible armaments, a\r\npower to which the world has afforded no parallel, in the face of which\r\npolitical freedom must wither and perish.\r\n\r\nFor us there was but one choice. We have made it, and woe be to that\r\nman, or that group of men, that seeks to stand in our way in this day of\r\nhigh resolution, when every principle we hold dearest is to be\r\nvindicated and made secure for the salvation of the nation. We are ready\r\nto plead at the bar of history, and our flag shall wear a new luster.\r\nOnce more we shall make good with our lives and fortunes the great faith\r\nto which we are born, and a new glory shall shine in the face of our\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO THE POPE\r\n\r\n[This important and eloquent document, though signed by the Secretary of\r\nState, was of course authorized by the President, and indeed bears\r\ninternal marks of being his own composition. The Pope had made a plea\r\nfor peace, which was by our government deemed premature.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST 27, 1917.\r\n\r\nTO HIS HOLINESS BENEDICTUS XV, POPE:\r\n\r\nIn acknowledgment of the communication of Your Holiness to the\r\nbelligerent peoples, dated August 1, 1917, the President of the United\r\nStates requests me to transmit the following reply:\r\n\r\nEvery heart that has not been blinded and hardened by this terrible war\r\nmust be touched by this moving appeal of His Holiness the Pope, must\r\nfeel the dignity and force of the humane and generous motives which\r\nprompted it, and must fervently wish that we might take the path of\r\npeace he so persuasively points out. But it would be folly to take it if\r\nit does not in fact lead to the goal he proposes. Our response must be\r\nbased upon the stern facts and upon nothing else. It is not a mere\r\ncessation of arms he desires; it is a stable and enduring peace. This\r\nagony must not be gone through with again, and it must be a matter of\r\nvery sober judgment that will insure us against it.\r\n\r\nHis Holiness in substance proposes that we return to the status quo ante\r\nbellum, and that then there be a general condonation, disarmament, and a\r\nconcert of nations based upon an acceptance of the principle of\r\narbitration; that by a similar concert freedom of the seas be\r\nestablished; and that the territorial claims of France and Italy, the\r\nperplexing problems of the Balkan States, and the restitution of Poland\r\nbe left to such conciliatory adjustments as may be possible in the new\r\ntemper of such a peace, due regard being paid to the aspirations of the\r\npeoples whose political fortunes and affiliations will be involved.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that no part of this program can be successfully carried\r\nout unless the restitution of the status quo ante furnishes a firm and\r\nsatisfactory basis for it. The object of this war is to deliver the free\r\npeoples of the world from the menace and the actual power of a vast\r\nmilitary establishment controlled by an irresponsible government which,\r\nhaving secretly planned to dominate the world, proceeded to carry the\r\nplan out without regard either to the sacred obligations of treaty or\r\nthe long-established practices and long-cherished principles of\r\ninternational action and honor; which chose its own time for the war;\r\ndelivered its blow fiercely and suddenly; stopped at no barrier either\r\nof law or of mercy; swept a whole continent within the tide of\r\nblood--not the blood of soldiers only, but the blood of innocent women\r\nand children also and of the helpless poor; and now stands balked but\r\nnot defeated, the enemy of four-fifths of the world. This power is not\r\nthe German people. It is the ruthless master of the German people. It is\r\nno business of ours how that great people came under its control or\r\nsubmitted with temporary zest to the domination of its purpose; but it\r\nis our business to see to it that the history of the rest of the world\r\nis no longer left to its handling.\r\n\r\nTo deal with such a power by way of peace upon the plan proposed by His\r\nHoliness the Pope would, so far as we can see, involve a recuperation of\r\nits strength and a renewal of its policy; would make it necessary to\r\ncreate a permanent hostile combination of nations against the German\r\npeople who are its instruments; and would result in abandoning the\r\nnewborn Russia to the intrigue, the manifold subtle interference, and\r\nthe certain counter-revolution which would be attempted by all the\r\nmalign influences to which the German Government has of late accustomed\r\nthe world. Can peace be based upon a restitution of its power or upon\r\nany word of honor it could pledge in a treaty of settlement and\r\naccommodation?\r\n\r\nResponsible statesmen must now everywhere see, if they never saw before,\r\nthat no peace can rest securely upon political or economic restrictions\r\nmeant to benefit some nations and cripple or embarrass others, upon\r\nvindictive action of any sort, or any kind of revenge or deliberate\r\ninjury. The American people have suffered intolerable wrongs at the\r\nhands of the Imperial German Government, but they desire no reprisal\r\nupon the German people who have themselves suffered all things in this\r\nwar which they did not choose. They believe that peace should rest upon\r\nthe rights of peoples, not the rights of Governments--the rights of\r\npeoples great or small, weak or powerful--their equal right to freedom\r\nand security and self-government and to a participation upon fair terms\r\nin the economic opportunities of the world, the German people of course\r\nincluded if they will accept equality and not seek domination.\r\n\r\nThe test, therefore, of every plan of peace is this: Is it based upon\r\nthe faith of all the peoples involved or merely upon the word of an\r\nambitious and intriguing government on the one hand and of a group of\r\nfree peoples on the other? This is a test which goes to the root of the\r\nmatter; and it is the test which must be applied.\r\n\r\nThe purposes of the United States in this war are known to the whole\r\nworld, to every people to whom the truth has been permitted to come.\r\nThey do not need to be stated again. We seek no material advantage of\r\nany kind. We believe that the intolerable wrongs done in this war by\r\nthe furious and brutal power of the Imperial German Government ought to\r\nbe repaired, but not at the expense of the sovereignty of any\r\npeople--rather a vindication of the sovereignty both of those that are\r\nweak and of those that are strong. Punitive damages, the dismemberment\r\nof empires, the establishment of selfish and exclusive economic leagues,\r\nwe deem inexpedient and in the end worse than futile, no proper basis\r\nfor a peace of any kind, least of all for an enduring peace. That must\r\nbe based upon justice and fairness and the common rights of mankind.\r\n\r\nWe cannot take the word of the present rulers of Germany as a guaranty\r\nof anything that is to endure, unless explicitly supported by such\r\nconclusive evidence of the will and purpose of the German people\r\nthemselves as the other peoples of the world would be justified in\r\naccepting. Without such guaranties treaties of settlement, agreements\r\nfor disarmament, covenants to set up arbitration in the place of force,\r\nterritorial adjustments, reconstitutions of small nations, if made with\r\nthe German Government, no man, no nation could now depend on. We must\r\nawait some new evidence of the purposes of the great peoples of the\r\ncentral powers. God grant it may be given soon and in a way to restore\r\nthe confidence of all peoples everywhere in the faith of nations and the\r\npossibility of a covenanted peace.\r\n\r\nROBERT LANSING,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State of the United States of America_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLABOR MUST BE FREE\r\n\r\n[Address to the American Federation of Labor Convention, Buffalo, New\r\nYork, November 12, 1917.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT, DELEGATES OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR, LADIES AND\r\nGENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nI esteem it a great privilege and a real honor to be thus admitted to\r\nyour public counsels. When your executive committee paid me the\r\ncompliment of inviting me here I gladly accepted the invitation because\r\nit seems to me that this, above all other times in our history, is the\r\ntime for common counsel, for the drawing together not only of the\r\nenergies but of the minds of the Nation. I thought that it was a welcome\r\nopportunity for disclosing to you some of the thoughts that have been\r\ngathering in my mind during these last momentous months.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRITICAL TIME IN HISTORY\r\n\r\nI am introduced to you as the President of the United States, and yet I\r\nwould be pleased if you would put the thought of the office into the\r\nbackground and regard me as one of your fellow-citizens who has come\r\nhere to speak, not the words of authority, but the words of counsel; the\r\nwords which men should speak to one another who wish to be frank in a\r\nmoment more critical perhaps than the history of the world has ever yet\r\nknown; a moment when it is every man's duty to forget himself, to forget\r\nhis own interests, to fill himself with the nobility of a great national\r\nand world conception, and act upon a new platform elevated above the\r\nordinary affairs of life and lifted to where men have views of the long\r\ndestiny of mankind.\r\n\r\nI think that in order to realize just what this moment of counsel is it\r\nis very desirable that we should remind ourselves just how this war came\r\nabout and just what it is for. You can explain most wars very simply,\r\nbut the explanation of this is not so simple. Its roots run deep into\r\nall the obscure soils of history, and in my view this is the last\r\ndecisive issue between the old principle of power and the new principle\r\nof freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR STARTED BY GERMANY\r\n\r\nThe war was started by Germany. Her authorities deny that they started\r\nit, but I am willing to let the statement I have just made await the\r\nverdict of history. And the thing that needs to be explained is why\r\nGermany started the war. Remember what the position of Germany in the\r\nworld was--as enviable a position as any nation has ever occupied. The\r\nwhole world stood at admiration of her wonderful intellectual and\r\nmaterial achievements. All the intellectual men of the world went to\r\nschool to her. As a university man I have been surrounded by men trained\r\nin Germany, men who had resorted to Germany because nowhere else could\r\nthey get such thorough and searching training, particularly in the\r\nprinciples of science and the principles that underlie modern material\r\nachievement. Her men of science had made her industries perhaps the most\r\ncompetent industries of the world, and the label \"Made in Germany\" was a\r\nguarantee of good workmanship and of sound material. She had access to\r\nall the markets of the world, and every other nation who traded in those\r\nmarkets feared Germany because of her effective and almost irresistible\r\ncompetition. She had a \"place in the sun.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANY'S INDUSTRIAL GROWTH\r\n\r\nWhy was she not satisfied? What more did she want? There was nothing in\r\nthe world of peace that she did not already have and have in abundance.\r\nWe boast of the extraordinary pace of American advancement. We show with\r\npride the statistics of the increase of our industries and of the\r\npopulation of our cities. Well, those statistics did not match the\r\nrecent statistics of Germany. Her old cities took on youth and grew\r\nfaster than any American cities ever grew. Her old industries opened\r\ntheir eyes and saw a new world and went out for its conquest. And yet\r\nthe authorities of Germany were not satisfied.\r\n\r\nYou have one part of the answer to the question why she was not\r\nsatisfied in her methods of competition. There is no important industry\r\nin Germany upon which the Government has not laid its hands, to direct\r\nit and, when necessity arose, control it; and you have only to ask any\r\nman whom you meet who is familiar with the conditions that prevailed\r\nbefore the war in the matter of national competition to find out the\r\nmethods of competition which the German manufacturers and exporters used\r\nunder the patronage and support of the Government of Germany. You will\r\nfind that they were the same sorts of competition that we have tried to\r\nprevent by law within our own borders. If they could not sell their\r\ngoods cheaper than we could sell ours at a profit to themselves they\r\ncould get a subsidy from the Government which made it possible to sell\r\nthem cheaper anyhow, and the conditions of competition were thus\r\ncontrolled in large measure by the German Government itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nBERLIN-BAGDAD RAILWAY\r\n\r\nBut that did not satisfy the German Government. All the while there was\r\nlying behind its thought and in its dreams of the future a political\r\ncontrol which would enable it in the long run to dominate the labor and\r\nthe industry of the world. They were not content with success by\r\nsuperior achievement; they wanted success by authority. I suppose very\r\nfew of you have thought much about the Berlin-to-Bagdad Railway. The\r\nBerlin-Bagdad Railway was constructed in order to run the threat of\r\nforce down the flank of the industrial undertakings of half a dozen\r\nother countries; so that when German competition came in it would not be\r\nresisted too far, because there was always the possibility of getting\r\nGerman armies into the heart of that country quicker than any other\r\narmies could be got there.\r\n\r\nLook at the map of Europe now! Germany is thrusting upon us again and\r\nagain the discussion of peace talks,--about what? Talks about Belgium;\r\ntalks about northern France; talks about Alsace-Lorraine. Well, those\r\nare deeply interesting subjects to us and to them, but they are not the\r\nheart of the matter. Take the map and look at it. Germany has absolute\r\ncontrol of Austria-Hungary, practical control of the Balkan States,\r\ncontrol of Turkey, control of Asia Minor. I saw a map in which the whole\r\nthing was printed in appropriate black the other day, and the black\r\nstretched all the way from Hamburg to Bagdad--the bulk of German power\r\ninserted into the heart of the world. If she can keep that, she has kept\r\nall that her dreams contemplated when the war began. If she can keep\r\nthat, her power can disturb the world as long as she keeps it, always\r\nprovided, for I feel bound to put this proviso in--always provided the\r\npresent influences that control the German Government continue to\r\ncontrol it. I believe that the spirit of freedom can get into the hearts\r\nof Germans and find as fine a welcome there as it can find in any other\r\nhearts, but the spirit of freedom does not suit the plans of the\r\nPan-Germans. Power cannot be used with concentrated force against free\r\npeoples if it is used by free people.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACE RUMORS\r\n\r\nYou know how many intimations come to us from one of the central powers\r\nthat it is more anxious for peace than the chief central power, and you\r\nknow that it means that the people in that central power know that if\r\nthe war ends as it stands they will in effect themselves be vassals of\r\nGermany, notwithstanding that their populations are compounded of all\r\nthe peoples of that part of the world, and notwithstanding the fact that\r\nthey do not wish in their pride and proper spirit of nationality to be\r\nso absorbed and dominated. Germany is determined that the political\r\npower of the world shall belong to her. There have been such ambitions\r\nbefore. They have been in part realized, but never before have those\r\nambitions been based upon so exact and precise and scientific a plan of\r\ndomination.\r\n\r\nMay I not say that it is amazing to me that any group of persons should\r\nbe so ill-informed as to suppose, as some groups in Russia apparently\r\nsuppose, that any reforms planned in the interest of the people can live\r\nin the presence of a Germany powerful enough to undermine or overthrow\r\nthem by intrigue or force? Any body of free men that compounds with the\r\npresent German Government is compounding for its own destruction. But\r\nthat is not the whole of the story. Any man in America or anywhere else\r\nthat supposes that the free industry and enterprise of the world can\r\ncontinue if the Pan-German plan is achieved and German power fastened\r\nupon the world is as fatuous as the dreamers in Russia. What I am\r\nopposed to is not the feeling of the pacifists, but their stupidity. My\r\nheart is with them, but my mind has a contempt for them. I want peace,\r\nbut I know how to get it, and they do not.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONEL HOUSE'S MISSION\r\n\r\nYou will notice that I sent a friend of mine, Colonel House, to Europe,\r\nwho is as great a lover of peace as any man in the world; but I didn't\r\nsend him on a peace mission yet. I sent him to take part in a conference\r\nas to how the war was to be won, and he knows, as I know, that that is\r\nthe way to get peace, if you want it for more than a few minutes.\r\n\r\nAll of this is a preface to the conference that I have referred to with\r\nregard to what we are going to do. If we are true friends of freedom,\r\nour own or anybody else's, we will see that the power of this country\r\nand the productivity of this country is raised to its absolute maximum,\r\nand that absolutely nobody is allowed to stand in the way of it. When I\r\nsay that nobody is allowed to stand in the way I do not mean that they\r\nshall be prevented by the power of the Government but by the power of\r\nthe American spirit. Our duty, if we are to do this great thing and show\r\nAmerica to be what we believe her to be--the greatest hope and energy of\r\nthe world--is to stand together night and day until the job is finished.\r\n\r\n\r\nLABOR MUST BE FREE\r\n\r\nWhile we are fighting for freedom we must see, among other things, that\r\nlabor is free; and that means a number of interesting things. It means\r\nnot only that we must do what we have declared our purpose to do, see\r\nthat the conditions of labor are not rendered more onerous by the war,\r\nbut also that we shall see to it that the instrumentalities by which the\r\nconditions of labor are improved are not blocked or checked. That we\r\nmust do. That has been the matter about which I have taken pleasure in\r\nconferring from time to time with your president, Mr. Gompers; and if I\r\nmay be permitted to do so, I want to express my admiration of his\r\npatriotic courage, his large vision, and his statesmanlike sense of what\r\nhas to be done. I like to lay my mind alongside of a mind that knows how\r\nto pull in harness. The horses that kick over the traces will have to be\r\nput in corral.\r\n\r\nNow, to stand together means that nobody must interrupt the processes of\r\nour energy if the interruption can possibly be avoided without the\r\nabsolute invasion of freedom. To put it concretely, that means this:\r\nNobody has a right to stop the processes of labor until all the methods\r\nof conciliation and settlement have been exhausted. And I might as well\r\nsay right here that I am not talking to you alone. You sometimes stop\r\nthe courses of labor, but there are others who do the same, and I\r\nbelieve I am speaking from my own experience not only, but from the\r\nexperience of others when I say that you are reasonable in a larger\r\nnumber of cases than the capitalists. I am not saying these things to\r\nthem personally yet, because I have not had a chance, but they have to\r\nbe said, not in any spirit of criticism, but in order to clear the\r\natmosphere and come down to business. Everybody on both sides has now\r\ngot to transact business, and a settlement is never impossible when both\r\nsides want to do the square and right thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT HARD TO AVOID\r\n\r\nMoreover, a settlement is always hard to avoid when the parties can be\r\nbrought face to face. I can differ from a man much more radically when\r\nhe is not in the room than I can when he is in the room, because then\r\nthe awkward thing is he can come back at me and answer what I say. It is\r\nalways dangerous for a man to have the floor entirely to himself.\r\nTherefore, we must insist in every instance that the parties come into\r\neach other's presence and there discuss the issues between them, and not\r\nseparately in places which have no communication with each other. I\r\nalways like to remind myself of a delightful saying of an Englishman of\r\nthe past generation, Charles Lamb. He stuttered a little bit, and once\r\nwhen he was with a group of friends he spoke very harshly of some man\r\nwho was not present. One of his friends said: \"Why, Charles, I didn't\r\nknow that you knew so and so.\" \"O-o-oh,\" he said, \"I-I d-d-don't; I-I\r\ncan't h-h-h hate a m-m-man I-I know.\" There is a great deal of human\r\nnature, of very pleasant human nature, in the saying. It is hard to hate\r\na man you know. I may admit, parenthetically, that there are some\r\npoliticians whose methods I do not at all believe in, but they are jolly\r\ngood fellows, and if they only would not talk the wrong kind of politics\r\nto me, I would love to be with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO SYMPATHY WITH MOB SPIRIT\r\n\r\nSo it is all along the line, in serious matters and things less serious.\r\nWe are all of the same clay and spirit, and we can get together if we\r\ndesire to get together. Therefore, my counsel to you is this: Let us\r\nshow ourselves Americans by showing that we do not want to go off in\r\nseparate camps or groups by ourselves, but that we want to cooeperate\r\nwith all other classes and all other groups in the common enterprise\r\nwhich is to release the spirits of the world from bondage. I would be\r\nwilling to set that up as the final test of an American. That is the\r\nmeaning of democracy. I have been very much distressed, my\r\nfellow-citizens, by some of the things that have happened recently. The\r\nmob spirit is displaying itself here and there in this country. I have\r\nno sympathy with what some men are saying, but I have no sympathy with\r\nthe men who take their punishment into their own hands; and I want to\r\nsay to every man who does join such a mob that I do not recognize him as\r\nworthy of the free institutions of the United States. There are some\r\norganizations in this country whose object is anarchy and the\r\ndestruction of law, but I would not meet their efforts by making myself\r\npartner in destroying the law. I despise and hate their purposes as much\r\nas any man, but I respect the ancient processes of justice; and I would\r\nbe too proud not to see them done justice, however wrong they are.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUST OBEY COMMON COUNSEL\r\n\r\nSo I want to utter my earnest protest against any manifestation of the\r\nspirit of lawlessness anywhere or in any cause. Why, gentlemen, look\r\nwhat it means. We claim to be the greatest democratic people in the\r\nworld, and democracy means first of all that we can govern ourselves. If\r\nour men have not self-control, then they are not capable of that great\r\nthing which we call democratic government. A man who takes the law into\r\nhis own hands is not the right man to cooeperate in any formation or\r\ndevelopment of law and institutions, and some of the processes by which\r\nthe struggle between capital and labor is carried on are processes that\r\ncome very near to taking the law into your own hands. I do not mean for\r\na moment to compare them with what I have just been speaking of, but I\r\nwant you to see that they are mere gradations in this manifestation of\r\nthe unwillingness to cooeperate, and that the fundamental lesson of the\r\nwhole situation is that we must not only take common counsel, but that\r\nwe must yield to and obey common counsel. Not all of the\r\ninstrumentalities for this are at hand. I am hopeful that in the very\r\nnear future new instrumentalities may be organized by which we can see\r\nto it that various things that are now going on ought not to go on.\r\nThere are various processes of the dilution of labor and the unnecessary\r\nsubstitution of labor and the bidding in distant markets and unfairly\r\nupsetting the whole competition of labor which ought not to go on. I\r\nmean now on the part of employers, and we must interject some\r\ninstrumentality of cooeperation by which the fair thing will be done all\r\naround. I am hopeful that some such instrumentalities may be devised,\r\nbut whether they are or not, we must use those that we have and upon\r\nevery occasion where it is necessary have such an instrumentality\r\noriginated upon that occasion.\r\n\r\nSo, my fellow-citizens, the reason I came away from Washington is that I\r\nsometimes get lonely down there. So many people come to Washington who\r\nknow things that are not so, and so few people who know anything about\r\nwhat the people of the United States are thinking about. I have to come\r\naway and get reminded of the rest of the country. I have to come away\r\nand talk to men who are up against the real thing, and say to them, \"I\r\nam with you if you are with me.\" And the only test of being with me is\r\nnot to think about me personally at all, but merely to think of me as\r\nthe expression for the time being of the power and dignity and hope of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CALL FOR WAR WITH AUSTRIA-HUNGARY\r\n\r\n[Address delivered at a joint session of the two Houses of Congress,\r\nDecember 4, 1917.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nEight months have elapsed since I last had the honor of addressing you.\r\nThey have been months crowded with events of immense and grave\r\nsignificance for us. I shall not undertake to retail or even to\r\nsummarize those events. The practical particulars of the part we have\r\nplayed in them will be laid before you in the reports of the Executive\r\nDepartments. I shall discuss only our present outlook upon these vast\r\naffairs, our present duties, and the immediate means of accomplishing\r\nthe objects we shall hold always in view.\r\n\r\nI shall not go back to debate the causes of the war. The intolerable\r\nwrongs done and planned against us by the sinister masters of Germany\r\nhave long since become too grossly obvious and odious to every true\r\nAmerican to need to be rehearsed. But I shall ask you to consider again\r\nand with a very grave scrutiny our objectives and the measures by which\r\nwe mean to attain them; for the purpose of discussion here in this place\r\nis action, and our action must move straight towards definite ends. Our\r\nobject is, of course, to win the war; and we shall not slacken or suffer\r\nourselves to be diverted until it is won. But it is worth while asking\r\nand answering the question, When shall we consider the war won?\r\n\r\nFrom one point of view it is not necessary to broach this fundamental\r\nmatter. I do not doubt that the American people know what the war is\r\nabout and what sort of an outcome they will regard as a realization of\r\ntheir purpose in it. As a nation we are united in spirit and intention.\r\nI pay little heed to those who tell me otherwise. I hear the voices of\r\ndissent,--who does not? I hear the criticism and the clamor of the\r\nnoisily thoughtless and troublesome. I also see men here and there fling\r\nthemselves in impotent disloyalty against the calm, indomitable power of\r\nthe nation. I hear men debate peace who understand neither its nature\r\nnot the way in which we may attain it with uplifted eyes and unbroken\r\nspirits. But I know that none of these speaks for the nation. They do\r\nnot touch the heart of anything. They may safely be left to strut their\r\nuneasy hour and be forgotten.\r\n\r\nBut from another point of view I believe that it is necessary to say\r\nplainly what we here at the seat of action consider the war to be for\r\nand what part we mean to play in the settlement of its searching issues.\r\nWe are the spokesmen of the American people and they have a right to\r\nknow whether their purpose is ours. They desire peace by the overcoming\r\nof evil, by the defeat once for all of the sinister forces that\r\ninterrupt peace and render it impossible, and they wish to know how\r\nclosely our thought runs with theirs and what action we propose. They\r\nare impatient with those who desire peace by any sort of\r\ncompromise,--deeply and indignantly impatient,--but they will be equally\r\nimpatient with us if we do not make it plain to them what our objectives\r\nare and what we are planning for in seeking to make conquest of peace by\r\narms.\r\n\r\nI believe that I speak for them when I say two things: First, that this\r\nintolerable Thing of which the masters of Germany have shown us the ugly\r\nface, this menace of combined intrigue and force which we now see so\r\nclearly as the German power, a Thing without conscience or honor or\r\ncapacity for covenanted peace, must be crushed and, if it be not\r\nutterly brought to an end, at least shut out from the friendly\r\nintercourse of the nations; and, second, that when this Thing and its\r\npower are indeed defeated and the time comes that we can discuss\r\npeace,--when the German people have spokesmen whose word we can believe\r\nand when those spokesmen are ready in the name of their people to accept\r\nthe common judgment of the nations as to what shall henceforth be the\r\nbases of law and of covenant for the life of the world,--we shall be\r\nwilling and glad to pay the full price for peace, and pay it\r\nungrudgingly. We know what that price will be. It will be full,\r\nimpartial justice,--justice done at every point and to every nation that\r\nthe final settlement must affect, our enemies as well as our friends.\r\n\r\nYou catch, with me, the voices of humanity that are in the air. They\r\ngrow daily more audible, more articulate, more persuasive, and they come\r\nfrom the hearts of men everywhere. They insist that the war shall not\r\nend in vindictive action of any kind; that no nation or people shall be\r\nrobbed or punished because the irresponsible rulers of a single country\r\nhave themselves done deep and abominable wrong. It is this thought that\r\nhas been expressed in the formula \"No annexations, no contributions, no\r\npunitive indemnities.\" Just because this crude formula expresses the\r\ninstinctive judgment as to right of plain men everywhere it has been\r\nmade diligent use of by the masters of German intrigue to lead the\r\npeople of Russia astray--and the people of every other country their\r\nagents could reach, in order that a premature peace might be brought\r\nabout before autocracy has been taught its final and convincing lesson,\r\nand the people of the world put in control of their own destinies.\r\n\r\nBut the fact that a wrong use has been made of a just idea is no reason\r\nwhy a right use should not be made of it. It ought to be brought under\r\nthe patronage of its real friends. Let it be said again that autocracy\r\nmust first be shown the utter futility of its claims to power or\r\nleadership in the modern world. It is impossible to apply any standard\r\nof justice so long as such forces are unchecked and undefeated as the\r\npresent masters of Germany command. Not until that has been done can\r\nRight be set up as arbiter and peace-maker among the nations. But when\r\nthat has been done,--as, God willing, it assuredly will be,--we shall at\r\nlast be free to do an unprecedented thing, and this is the time to avow\r\nour purpose to do it. We shall be free to base peace on generosity and\r\njustice, to the exclusion of all selfish claims to advantage even on the\r\npart of the victors.\r\n\r\nLet there be no misunderstanding. Our present and immediate task is to\r\nwin the war, and nothing shall turn us aside from it until it is\r\naccomplished. Every power and resource we possess, whether of men, of\r\nmoney, or of materials, is being devoted and will continue to be devoted\r\nto that purpose until it is achieved. Those who desire to bring peace\r\nabout before that purpose is achieved I counsel to carry their advice\r\nelsewhere. We will not entertain it. We shall regard the war as won only\r\nwhen the German people say to us, through properly accredited\r\nrepresentatives, that they are ready to agree to a settlement based upon\r\njustice and the reparation of the wrongs their rulers have done. They\r\nhave done a wrong to Belgium which must be repaired. They have\r\nestablished a power over other lands and peoples than their own,--over\r\nthe great Empire of Austria-Hungary, over hitherto free Balkan states,\r\nover Turkey, and within Asia,--which must be relinquished.\r\n\r\nGermany's success by skill, by industry, by knowledge, by enterprise we\r\ndid not grudge or oppose, but admired, rather. She had built up for\r\nherself a real empire of trade and influence, secured by the peace of\r\nthe world. We were content to abide the rivalries of manufacture,\r\nscience, and commerce that were involved for us in her success and stand\r\nor fall as we had or did not have the brains and the initiative to\r\nsurpass her. But at the moment when she had conspicuously won her\r\ntriumphs of peace she threw them away, to establish in their stead what\r\nthe world will no longer permit to be established, military and\r\npolitical domination by arms, by which to oust where she could not excel\r\nthe rivals she most feared and hated. The peace we make must remedy that\r\nwrong. It must deliver the once fair lands and happy peoples of Belgium\r\nand northern France from the Prussian conquest and the Prussian menace,\r\nbut it must also deliver the peoples of Austria-Hungary, the peoples of\r\nthe Balkans, and the peoples of Turkey, alike in Europe and in Asia,\r\nfrom the impudent and alien dominion of the Prussian military and\r\ncommercial autocracy.\r\n\r\nWe owe it, however, to ourselves to say that we do not wish in any way\r\nto impair or to rearrange the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is no affair\r\nof ours what they do with their own life, either industrially or\r\npolitically. We do not purpose or desire to dictate to them in any way.\r\nWe only desire to see that their affairs are left in their own hands, in\r\nall matters, great or small. We shall hope to secure for the peoples of\r\nthe Balkan peninsula and for the people of the Turkish Empire the right\r\nand opportunity to make their own lives safe, their own fortunes secure\r\nagainst oppression or injustice and from the dictation of foreign courts\r\nor parties.\r\n\r\nAnd our attitude and purpose with regard to Germany herself are of a\r\nlike kind. We intend no wrong against the German Empire, no interference\r\nwith her internal affairs. We should deem either the one or the other\r\nabsolutely unjustifiable, absolutely contrary to the principles we have\r\nprofessed to live by and to hold most sacred throughout our life as a\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe people of Germany are being told by the men whom they now permit to\r\ndeceive them and to act as their masters that they are fighting for the\r\nvery life and existence of their Empire, a war of desperate self-defense\r\nagainst deliberate aggression. Nothing could be more grossly or wantonly\r\nfalse, and we must seek by the utmost openness and candor as to our real\r\naims to convince them of its falseness. We are in fact fighting for\r\ntheir emancipation from fear, along with our own,--from the fear as well\r\nas from the fact of unjust attack by neighbors or rivals or schemers\r\nafter world empire. No one is threatening the existence or the\r\nindependence or the peaceful enterprise of the German Empire.\r\n\r\nThe worst that can happen to the detriment of the German people is this,\r\nthat if they should still, after the war is over, continue to be obliged\r\nto live under ambitious and intriguing masters interested to disturb the\r\npeace of the world, men or classes of men whom the other peoples of the\r\nworld could not trust, it might be impossible to admit them to the\r\npartnership of nations which must henceforth guarantee the world's\r\npeace. That partnership must be a partnership of peoples, not a mere\r\npartnership of governments. It might be impossible, also, in such\r\nuntoward circumstances, to admit Germany to the free economic\r\nintercourse which must inevitably spring out of the other partnerships\r\nof a real peace. But there would be no aggression in that; and such a\r\nsituation, inevitable because of distrust, would in the very nature of\r\nthings sooner or later cure itself, by processes which would assuredly\r\nset in.\r\n\r\nThe wrongs, the very deep wrongs, committed in this war will have to be\r\nrighted. That of course. But they cannot and must not be righted by the\r\ncommission of similar wrongs against Germany and her allies. The world\r\nwill not permit the commission of similar wrongs as a means of\r\nreparation and settlement. Statesmen must by this time have learned that\r\nthe opinion of the world is everywhere wide awake and fully comprehends\r\nthe issues involved. No representative of any self-governed nation will\r\ndare disregard it by attempting any such covenants of selfishness and\r\ncompromise as were entered into at the Congress of Vienna. The thought\r\nof the plain people here and everywhere throughout the world, the people\r\nwho enjoy no privilege and have very simple and unsophisticated\r\nstandards of right and wrong, is the air all governments must henceforth\r\nbreathe if they would live. It is in the full disclosing light of that\r\nthought that all policies must be conceived and executed in this midday\r\nhour of the world's life. German rulers have been able to upset the\r\npeace of the world only because the German people were not suffered\r\nunder their tutelage to share the comradeship of the other peoples of\r\nthe world either in thought or in purpose. They were allowed to have no\r\nopinion of their own which might be set up as a rule of conduct for\r\nthose who exercised authority over them. But the congress that concludes\r\nthis war will feel the full strength of the tides that run now in the\r\nhearts and consciences of free men everywhere. Its conclusions will run\r\nwith those tides.\r\n\r\nAll these things have been true from the very beginning of this\r\nstupendous war; and I cannot help thinking that if they had been made\r\nplain at the very outset the sympathy and enthusiasm of the Russian\r\npeople might have been once for all enlisted on the side of the Allies,\r\nsuspicion and distrust swept away, and a real and lasting union of\r\npurpose effected. Had they believed these things at the very moment of\r\ntheir revolution and had they been confirmed in that belief since, the\r\nsad reverses which have recently marked the progress of their affairs\r\ntowards an ordered and stable government of free men might have been\r\navoided. The Russian people have been poisoned by the very same\r\nfalsehoods that have kept the German people in the dark, and the poison\r\nhas been administered by the very same hands. The only possible antidote\r\nis the truth. It cannot be uttered too plainly or too often.\r\n\r\nFrom every point of view, therefore, it has seemed to be my duty to\r\nspeak these declarations of purpose, to add these specific\r\ninterpretations to what I took the liberty of saying to the Senate in\r\nJanuary. Our entrance into the war has not altered our attitude towards\r\nthe settlement that must come when it is over. When I said in January\r\nthat the nations of the world were entitled not only to free pathways\r\nupon the sea but also to assured and unmolested access to those pathways\r\nI was thinking, and I am thinking now, not of the smaller and weaker\r\nnations alone, which need our countenance and support, but also of the\r\ngreat and powerful nations, and of our present enemies as well as our\r\npresent associates in the war. I was thinking, and am thinking now, of\r\nAustria herself, among the rest, as well as of Serbia and of Poland.\r\nJustice and equality of rights can be had only at a great price. We are\r\nseeking permanent, not temporary, foundations for the peace of the world\r\nand must seek them candidly and fearlessly. As always, the right will\r\nprove to be the expedient.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we do, then, to push this great war of freedom and justice to\r\nits righteous conclusion? We must clear away with a thorough hand all\r\nimpediments to success and we must make every adjustment of law that\r\nwill facilitate the full and free use of our whole capacity and force\r\nas a fighting unit.\r\n\r\nOne very embarrassing obstacle that stands in our way is that we are at\r\nwar with Germany but not with her allies. I therefore very earnestly\r\nrecommend that the Congress immediately declare the United States in a\r\nstate of war with Austria-Hungary. Does it seem strange to you that this\r\nshould be the conclusion of the argument I have just addressed to you?\r\nIt is not. It is in fact the inevitable logic of what I have said.\r\nAustria-Hungary is for the time being not her own mistress but simply\r\nthe vassal of the German Government. We must face the facts as they are\r\nand act upon them without sentiment in this stern business. The\r\ngovernment of Austria-Hungary is not acting upon its own initiative or\r\nin response to the wishes and feelings of its own peoples but as the\r\ninstrument of another nation. We must meet its force with our own and\r\nregard the Central Powers as but one. The war can be successfully\r\nconducted in no other way. The same logic would lead also to a\r\ndeclaration of war against Turkey and Bulgaria. They also are the tools\r\nof Germany. But they are mere tools and do not yet stand in the direct\r\npath of our necessary action. We shall go wherever the necessities of\r\nthis war carry us, but it seems to me that we should go only where\r\nimmediate and practical considerations lead us and not heed any others.\r\n\r\nThe financial and military measures which must be adopted will suggest\r\nthemselves as the war and its undertakings develop, but I will take the\r\nliberty of proposing to you certain other acts of legislation which seem\r\nto me to be needed for the support of the war and for the release of our\r\nwhole force and energy.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to extend in certain particulars the legislation\r\nof the last session with regard to alien enemies; and also necessary, I\r\nbelieve, to create a very definite and particular control over the\r\nentrance and departure of all persons into and from the United States.\r\n\r\nLegislation should be enacted defining as a criminal offense every\r\nwilful violation of the presidential proclamations relating to alien\r\nenemies promulgated under section 4067 of the Revised Statutes and\r\nproviding appropriate punishments; and women as well as men should be\r\nincluded under the terms of the acts placing restraints upon alien\r\nenemies. It is likely that as time goes on many alien enemies will be\r\nwilling to be fed and housed at the expense of the Government in the\r\ndetention camps and it would be the purpose of the legislation I have\r\nsuggested to confine offenders among them in penitentiaries and other\r\nsimilar institutions where they could be made to work as other criminals\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nRecent experience has convinced me that the Congress must go further in\r\nauthorizing the Government to set limits to prices. The law of supply\r\nand demand, I am sorry to say, has been replaced by the law of\r\nunrestrained selfishness. While we have eliminated profiteering in\r\nseveral branches of industry it still runs impudently rampant in others.\r\nThe farmers, for example, complain with a great deal of justice that,\r\nwhile the regulation of food prices restricts their incomes, no\r\nrestraints are placed upon the prices of most of the things they must\r\nthemselves purchase; and similar inequities obtain on all sides.\r\n\r\nIt is imperatively necessary that the consideration of the full use of\r\nthe water power of the country and also the consideration of the\r\nsystematic and yet economical development of such of the natural\r\nresources of the country as are still under the control of the federal\r\ngovernment should be immediately resumed and affirmatively and\r\nconstructively dealt with at the earliest possible moment. The pressing\r\nneed of such legislation is daily becoming more obvious.\r\n\r\nThe legislation proposed at the last session with regard to regulated\r\ncombinations among our exporters, in order to provide for our foreign\r\ntrade a more effective organization and method of cooeperation, ought by\r\nall means to be completed at this session.\r\n\r\nAnd I beg that the members of the House of Representatives will permit\r\nme to express the opinion that it will be impossible to deal in any but\r\na very wasteful and extravagant fashion with the enormous appropriations\r\nof the public moneys which must continue to be made, if the war is to be\r\nproperly sustained, unless the House will consent to return to its\r\nformer practice of initiating and preparing all appropriation bills\r\nthrough a single committee, in order that responsibility may be\r\ncentered, expenditures standardized and made uniform, and waste and\r\nduplication as much as possible avoided.\r\n\r\nAdditional legislation may also become necessary before the present\r\nCongress again adjourns in order to effect the most efficient\r\ncooerdination and operation of the railway and other transportation\r\nsystems of the country; but to that I shall, if circumstances should\r\ndemand, call the attention of the Congress upon another occasion.\r\n\r\nIf I have overlooked anything that ought to be done for the more\r\neffective conduct of the war, your own counsels will supply the\r\nomission. What I am perfectly clear about is that in the present session\r\nof the Congress our whole attention and energy should be concentrated on\r\nthe vigorous, rapid, and successful prosecution of the great task of\r\nwinning the war.\r\n\r\nWe can do this with all the greater zeal and enthusiasm because we know\r\nthat for us this is a war of high principle, debased by no selfish\r\nambition of conquest or spoliation; because we know, and all the world\r\nknows, that we have been forced into it to save the very institutions we\r\nlive under from corruption and destruction. The purposes of the Central\r\nPowers strike straight at the very heart of everything we believe in;\r\ntheir methods of warfare outrage every principle of humanity and of\r\nknightly honor; their intrigue has corrupted the very thought and spirit\r\nof many of our people; their sinister and secret diplomacy has sought to\r\ntake our very territory away from us and disrupt the Union of the\r\nStates. Our safety would be at an end, our honor forever sullied and\r\nbrought into contempt were we to permit their triumph. They are striking\r\nat the very existence of democracy and liberty.\r\n\r\nIt is because it is for us a war of high, disinterested purpose, in\r\nwhich all the free peoples of the world are banded together for the\r\nvindication of right, a war for the preservation of our nation and of\r\nall that it has held dear of principle and of purpose, that we feel\r\nourselves doubly constrained to propose for its outcome only that which\r\nis righteous and of irreproachable intention, for our foes as well as\r\nfor our friends. The cause being just and holy, the settlement must be\r\nof like motive and quality. For this we can fight, but for nothing less\r\nnoble or less worthy of our traditions. For this cause we entered the\r\nwar and for this cause will we battle until the last gun is fired.\r\n\r\nI have spoken plainly because this seems to me the time when it is most\r\nnecessary to speak plainly, in order that all the world may know that\r\neven in the heat and ardor of the struggle and when our whole thought is\r\nof carrying the war through to its end we have not forgotten any ideal\r\nor principle for which the name of America has been held in honor among\r\nthe nations and for which it has been our glory to contend in the great\r\ngenerations that went before us. A supreme moment of history has come.\r\nThe eyes of the people have been opened and they see. The hand of God is\r\nlaid upon the nations. He will show them favor, I devoutly believe, only\r\nif they rise to the clear heights of His own justice and mercy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION OF RAILWAYS\r\n\r\n[Address delivered at a joint session of the two Houses of Congress,\r\nJanuary 4, 1918.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nI have asked the privilege of addressing you in order to report to you\r\nthat on the twenty-eighth of December last, during the recess of the\r\nCongress, acting through the Secretary of War and under the authority\r\nconferred upon me by the Act of Congress approved August 29, 1916, I\r\ntook possession and assumed control of the railway lines of the country\r\nand the systems of water transportation under their control. This step\r\nseemed to be imperatively necessary in the interest of the public\r\nwelfare, in the presence of the great tasks of war with which we are now\r\ndealing. As our own experience develops difficulties and makes it clear\r\nwhat they are, I have deemed it my duty to remove those difficulties\r\nwherever I have the legal power to do so. To assume control of the vast\r\nrailway systems of the country is, I realize, a very great\r\nresponsibility, but to fail to do so in the existing circumstances would\r\nhave been a much greater. I assumed the less responsibility rather than\r\nthe weightier.\r\n\r\nI am sure that I am speaking the mind of all thoughtful Americans when I\r\nsay that it is our duty as the representatives of the nation to do\r\neverything that it is necessary to do to secure the complete\r\nmobilization of the whole resources of America by as rapid and effective\r\nmeans as can be found. Transportation supplies all the arteries of,\r\nmobilization. Unless it be under a single and unified direction, the\r\nwhole process of the nation's action is embarrassed.\r\n\r\nIt was in the true spirit of America, and it was right, that we should\r\nfirst try to effect the necessary unification under the voluntary action\r\nof those who were in charge of the great railway properties; and we did\r\ntry it. The directors of the railways responded to the need promptly and\r\ngenerously. The group of railway executives who were charged with the\r\ntask of actual cooerdination and general direction performed their\r\ndifficult duties with patriotic zeal and marked ability, as was to have\r\nbeen expected, and did, I believe, everything that it was possible for\r\nthem to do in the circumstances. If I have taken the task out of their\r\nhands, it has not been because of any dereliction or failure on their\r\npart but only because there were some things which the Government can do\r\nand private management cannot. We shall continue to value most highly\r\nthe advice and assistance of these gentlemen and I am sure we shall not\r\nfind them withholding it.\r\n\r\nIt had become unmistakably plain that only under government\r\nadministration can the entire equipment of the several systems of\r\ntransportation be fully and unreservedly thrown into a common service\r\nwithout injurious discrimination against particular properties. Only\r\nunder government administration can an absolutely unrestricted and\r\nunembarrassed common use be made of all tracks, terminals, terminal\r\nfacilities and equipment of every kind. Only under that authority can\r\nnew terminals be constructed and developed without regard to the\r\nrequirements or limitations of particular roads. But under government\r\nadministration all these things will be possible,--not instantly, but as\r\nfast as practical difficulties, which cannot be merely conjured away,\r\ngive way before the new management.\r\n\r\nThe common administration will be carried out with as little disturbance\r\nof the present operating organizations and personnel of the railways as\r\npossible. Nothing will be altered or disturbed which it is not necessary\r\nto disturb. We are serving the public interest and safeguarding the\r\npublic safety, but we are also regardful of the interest of those by\r\nwhom these great properties are owned and glad to avail ourselves of the\r\nexperience and trained ability of those who have been managing them. It\r\nis necessary that the transportation of troops and of war materials, of\r\nfood and of fuel, and of everything that is necessary for the full\r\nmobilization of the energies and resources of the country, should be\r\nfirst considered, but it is clearly in the public interest also that the\r\nordinary activities and the normal industrial and commercial life of the\r\ncountry should be interfered with and dislocated as little as possible,\r\nand the public may rest assured that the interest and convenience of the\r\nprivate shipper will be as carefully served and safeguarded as it is\r\npossible to serve and safeguard it in the present extraordinary\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nWhile the present authority of the Executive suffices for all purposes\r\nof administration, and while of course all private interests must for\r\nthe present give way to the public necessity, it is, I am sure you will\r\nagree with me, right and necessary that the owners and creditors of the\r\nrailways, the holders of their stocks and bonds, should receive from the\r\nGovernment an unqualified guarantee that their properties will be\r\nmaintained throughout the period of federal control in as good repair\r\nand as complete equipment as at present, and that the several roads will\r\nreceive under federal management such compensation as is equitable and\r\njust alike to their owners and to the general public. I would suggest\r\nthe average net railway operating income of the three years ending June\r\n30, 1917. I earnestly recommend that these guarantees be given by\r\nappropriate legislation, and given as promptly as circumstances permit.\r\n\r\nI need not point out the essential justice of such guarantees and their\r\ngreat influence and significance as elements in the present financial\r\nand industrial situation of the country. Indeed, one of the strong\r\narguments for assuming control of the railroads at this time is the\r\nfinancial argument. It is necessary that the values of railway\r\nsecurities should be justly and fairly protected and that the large\r\nfinancial operations every year necessary in connection with the\r\nmaintenance, operation and development of the roads should, during the\r\nperiod of the war, be wisely related to the financial operations of the\r\nGovernment. Our first duty is, of course, to conserve the common\r\ninterest and the common safety and to make certain that nothing stands\r\nin the way of the successful prosecution of the great war for liberty\r\nand justice, but it is also an obligation of public conscience and of\r\npublic honor that the private interests we disturb should be kept safe\r\nfrom unjust injury, and it is of the utmost consequence to the\r\nGovernment itself that all great financial operations should be\r\nstabilized and cooerdinated with the financial operations of the\r\nGovernment. No borrowing should run athwart the borrowings of the\r\nfederal treasury, and no fundamental industrial values should anywhere\r\nbe unnecessarily impaired. In the hands of many thousands of small\r\ninvestors in the country, as well as in national banks, in insurance\r\ncompanies, in savings banks, in trust companies, in financial agencies\r\nof every kind, railway securities, the sum total of which runs up to\r\nsome ten or eleven thousand millions, constitute a vital part of the\r\nstructure of credit, and the unquestioned solidity of that structure\r\nmust be maintained.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War and I easily agreed that, in view of the many\r\ncomplex interests which must be safeguarded and harmonized, as well as\r\nbecause of his exceptional experience and ability in this new field of\r\ngovernmental action, the Honorable William G. McAdoo was the right man\r\nto assume direct administrative control of this new executive task. At\r\nour request, he consented to assume the authority and duties of\r\norganizer and Director General of the new Railway Administration. He has\r\nassumed those duties and his work is in active progress.\r\n\r\nIt is probably too much to expect that even under the unified railway\r\nadministration which will now be possible sufficient economies can be\r\neffected in the operation of the railways to make it possible to add to\r\ntheir equipment and extend their operative facilities as much as the\r\npresent extraordinary demands upon their use will render desirable\r\nwithout resorting to the national treasury for the funds. If it is not\r\npossible, it will, of course, be necessary to resort to the Congress for\r\ngrants of money for that purpose. The Secretary of the Treasury will\r\nadvise with your committees with regard to this very practical aspect of\r\nthe matter. For the present, I suggest only the guarantees I have\r\nindicated and such appropriations as are necessary at the outset of this\r\ntask. I take the liberty of expressing the hope that the Congress may\r\ngrant these promptly and ungrudgingly. We are dealing with great matters\r\nand will, I am sure, deal with them greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONDITIONS OF PEACE\r\n\r\n[Address delivered at a joint session of the two Houses of Congress,\r\nJanuary 8, 1918.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nOnce more, as repeatedly before, the spokesmen of the Central Empires\r\nhave indicated their desire to discuss the objects of the war and the\r\npossible bases of a general peace. Parleys have been in progress at\r\nBrest-Litovsk between Russian representatives and representatives of the\r\nCentral Powers to which the attention of all the belligerents has been\r\ninvited for the purpose of ascertaining whether it may be possible to\r\nextend these parleys into a general conference with regard to terms of\r\npeace and settlement. The Russian representatives presented not only a\r\nperfectly definite statement of the principles upon which they would be\r\nwilling to conclude peace but also an equally definite program of the\r\nconcrete application of those principles. The representatives of the\r\nCentral Powers, on their part, presented an outline of settlement which,\r\nif much less definite, seemed susceptible of liberal interpretation\r\nuntil their specific program of practical terms was added. That program\r\nproposed no concessions at all either to the sovereignty of Russia or to\r\nthe preferences of the populations with whose fortunes it dealt, but\r\nmeant, in a word, that the Central Empires were to keep every foot of\r\nterritory their armed forces had occupied,--every province, every city,\r\nevery point of vantage,--as a permanent addition to their territories\r\nand their power. It is a reasonable conjecture that the general\r\nprinciples of settlement which they at first suggested originated with\r\nthe more liberal statesmen of Germany and Austria, the men who have\r\nbegun to feel the force of their own peoples' thought and purpose, while\r\nthe concrete terms of actual settlement came from the military leaders\r\nwho have no thought but to keep what they have got. The negotiations\r\nhave been broken off. The Russian representatives were sincere and in\r\nearnest. They cannot entertain such proposals of conquest and\r\ndomination.\r\n\r\nThe whole incident is full of significance. It is also full of\r\nperplexity. With whom are the Russian representatives dealing? For whom\r\nare the representatives of the Central Empires speaking? Are they\r\nspeaking for the majorities of their respective parliaments or for the\r\nminority parties, that military and imperialistic minority which has so\r\nfar dominated their whole policy and controlled the affairs of Turkey\r\nand of the Balkan states which have felt obliged to become their\r\nassociates in this war? The Russian representatives have insisted, very\r\njustly, very wisely, and in the true spirit of modern democracy, that\r\nthe conferences they have been holding with the Teutonic and Turkish\r\nstatesmen should be held within open, not closed, doors, and all the\r\nworld has been audience, as was desired. To whom have we been listening,\r\nthen? To those who speak the spirit and intention of the Resolutions of\r\nthe German Reichstag of the ninth of July last, the spirit and intention\r\nof the liberal leaders and parties of Germany, or to those who resist\r\nand defy that spirit and intention and insist upon conquest and\r\nsubjugation? Or are we listening, in fact, to both, unreconciled and in\r\nopen and hopeless contradiction? These are very serious and pregnant\r\nquestions. Upon the answer to them depends the peace of the world.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever the results of the parleys at Brest-Litovsk, whatever the\r\nconfusions of counsel and of purpose in the utterances of the spokesmen\r\nof the Central Empires, they have again attempted to acquaint the world\r\nwith their objects in the war and have again challenged their\r\nadversaries to say what their objects are and what sort of settlement\r\nthey would deem just and satisfactory. There is no good reason why that\r\nchallenge should not be responded to, and responded to with the utmost\r\ncandor. We did not wait for it. Not once, but again and again, we have\r\nlaid our whole thought and purpose before the world, not in general\r\nterms only, but each time with sufficient definition to make it clear\r\nwhat sort of definitive terms of settlement must necessarily spring out\r\nof them. Within the last week Mr. Lloyd George has spoken with admirable\r\ncandor and in admirable spirit for the people and Government of Great\r\nBritain. There is no confusion of counsel among the adversaries of the\r\nCentral Powers, no uncertainty of principle, no vagueness of detail. The\r\nonly secrecy of counsel, the only lack of fearless frankness, the only\r\nfailure to make definite statement of the objects of the war, lies with\r\nGermany and her Allies. The issues of life and death hang upon these\r\ndefinitions. No statesman who has the least conception of his\r\nresponsibility ought for a moment to permit himself to continue this\r\ntragical and appalling outpouring of blood and treasure unless he is\r\nsure beyond a peradventure that the objects of the vital sacrifice are\r\npart and parcel of the very life of society and that the people for whom\r\nhe speaks think them right and imperative as he does.\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, a voice calling for these definitions of principle\r\nand of purpose which is, it seems to me, more thrilling and more\r\ncompelling than any of the many moving voices with which the troubled\r\nair of the world is filled. It is the voice of the Russian people. They\r\nare prostrate and all but helpless, it would seem, before the grim power\r\nof Germany, which has hitherto known no relenting and no pity. Their\r\npower, apparently, is shattered. And yet their soul is not subservient.\r\nThey will not yield either in principle or in action. Their conception\r\nof what is right, of what it is humane and honorable for them to accept,\r\nhas been stated with a frankness, a largeness of view, a generosity of\r\nspirit, and a universal human sympathy which must challenge the\r\nadmiration of every friend of mankind; and they have refused to compound\r\ntheir ideals or desert others that they themselves may be safe. They\r\ncall to us to say what it is that we desire, in what, if in anything,\r\nour purpose and our spirit differ from theirs; and I believe that the\r\npeople of the United States would wish me to respond, with utter\r\nsimplicity and frankness. Whether their present leaders believe it or\r\nnot, it is our heartfelt desire and hope that some way may be opened\r\nwhereby we may be privileged to assist the people of Russia to attain\r\ntheir utmost hope of liberty and ordered peace.\r\n\r\nIt will be our wish and purpose that the processes of peace, when they\r\nare begun, shall be absolutely open and that they shall involve and\r\npermit henceforth no secret understandings of any kind. The day of\r\nconquest and aggrandizement is gone by; so is also the day of secret\r\ncovenants entered into in the interest of particular governments and\r\nlikely at some unlooked-for moment to upset the peace of the world. It\r\nis this happy fact, now clear to the view of every public man whose\r\nthoughts do not still linger in an age that is dead and gone, which\r\nmakes it possible for every nation whose purposes are consistent with\r\njustice and the peace of the world to avow now or at any other time the\r\nobjects it has in view.\r\n\r\nWe entered this war because violations of right had occurred which\r\ntouched us to the quick and made the life of our own people impossible\r\nunless they were corrected and the world secured once for all against\r\ntheir recurrence. What we demand in this war, therefore, is nothing\r\npeculiar to ourselves. It is that the world be made fit and safe to live\r\nin; and particularly that it be made safe for every peace-loving nation\r\nwhich, like our own, wishes to live its own life, determine its own\r\ninstitutions, be assured of justice and fair dealing by the other\r\npeoples of the world as against force and selfish aggression. All the\r\npeoples of the world are in effect partners in this interest, and for\r\nour own part we see very clearly that unless justice be done to others\r\nit will not be done to us. The program of the world's peace, therefore,\r\nis our program; and that program, the only possible program, as we see\r\nit, is this:\r\n\r\nI. Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there shall\r\nbe no private international understandings of any kind, but diplomacy\r\nshall proceed always frankly and in the public view.\r\n\r\nII. Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas, outside territorial\r\nwaters, alike in peace and in war, except as the seas may be closed in\r\nwhole or in part by international action for the enforcement of\r\ninternational covenants.\r\n\r\nIII. The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the\r\nestablishment of an equality of trade conditions among all the nations\r\nconsenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance.\r\n\r\nIV. Adequate guarantees given and taken that national armaments will be\r\nreduced to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety.\r\n\r\nV. A free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of all\r\ncolonial claims, based upon a strict observance of the principle that in\r\ndetermining all such questions of sovereignty the interests of the\r\npopulations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims\r\nof the government whose title is to be determined.\r\n\r\nVI. The evacuation of all Russian territory and such a settlement of all\r\nquestions affecting Russia as will secure the best and freest\r\ncooeperation of the other nations of the world in obtaining for her an\r\nunhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the independent\r\ndetermination of her own political development and national policy and\r\nassure her of a sincere welcome into the society of free nations under\r\ninstitutions of her own choosing; and, more than a welcome, assistance\r\nalso of every kind that she may need and may herself desire. The\r\ntreatment accorded Russia by her sister nations in the months to come\r\nwill be the acid test of their good will, of their comprehension of her\r\nneeds as distinguished from their own interests, and of their\r\nintelligent and unselfish sympathy.\r\n\r\nVII. Belgium, the whole world will agree, must be evacuated and\r\nrestored, without any attempt to limit the sovereignty which she enjoys\r\nin common with all other free nations. No other single act will serve as\r\nthis will serve to restore confidence among the nations in the laws\r\nwhich they have themselves set and determined for the government of\r\ntheir relations with one another. Without this healing act the whole\r\nstructure and validity of international law is forever impaired.\r\n\r\nVIII. All French territory should be freed and the invaded portions\r\nrestored, and the wrong done to France by Prussia in 1871 in the matter\r\nof Alsace-Lorraine, which has unsettled the peace of the world for\r\nnearly fifty years, should be righted, in order that peace may once more\r\nbe made secure in the interest of all.\r\n\r\nIX. A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be effected along\r\nclearly recognizable lines of nationality.\r\n\r\nX. The peoples of Austria-Hungary, whose place among the nations we wish\r\nto see safeguarded and assured, should be accorded the freest\r\nopportunity of autonomous development.\r\n\r\nXI. Rumania, Serbia, and Montenegro should be evacuated; occupied\r\nterritories restored; Serbia accorded free and secure access to the sea;\r\nand the relations of the several Balkan states to one another determined\r\nby friendly counsel along historically established lines of allegiance\r\nand nationality; and international guarantees of the political and\r\neconomic independence and territorial integrity of the several Balkan\r\nstates should be entered into.\r\n\r\nXII. The Turkish portions of the present Ottoman Empire should be\r\nassured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now\r\nunder Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and\r\nan absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development and the\r\nDardanelles should be permanently opened as a free passage to the ships\r\nand commerce of all nations under international guarantees.\r\n\r\nXIII. An independent Polish state should be erected which should include\r\nthe territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations, which\r\nshould be assured a free and secure access to the sea, and whose\r\npolitical and economic independence and territorial integrity should be\r\nguaranteed by international covenant.\r\n\r\nXIV. A general association of nations must be formed under specific\r\ncovenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political\r\nindependence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike.\r\n\r\nIn regard to these essential rectifications of wrong and assertions of\r\nright we feel ourselves to be intimate partners of all the governments\r\nand peoples associated together against the Imperialists. We cannot be\r\nseparated in interest or divided in purpose. We stand together until the\r\nend.\r\n\r\nFor such arrangements and covenants we are willing to fight and to\r\ncontinue to fight until they are achieved; but only because we wish the\r\nright to prevail and desire a just and stable peace such as can be\r\nsecured only by removing the chief provocations to war, which this\r\nprogram does remove. We have no jealousy of German greatness, and there\r\nis nothing in this program that impairs it. We grudge her no achievement\r\nor distinction of learning or of pacific enterprise such as have made\r\nher record very bright and very enviable. We do not wish to injure her\r\nor to block in any way her legitimate influence or power. We do not wish\r\nto fight her either with arms or with hostile arrangements of trade if\r\nshe is willing to associate herself with us and the other peace-loving\r\nnations of the world in covenants of justice and law and fair dealing.\r\nWe wish her only to accept a place of equality among the peoples of the\r\nworld,--the new world in which we now live,--instead of a place of\r\nmastery.\r\n\r\nNeither do we presume to suggest to her any alteration or modification\r\nof her institutions. But it is necessary, we must frankly say, and\r\nnecessary as a preliminary to any intelligent dealings with her on our\r\npart, that we should know whom her spokesmen speak for when they speak\r\nto us, whether for the Reichstag majority or for the military party and\r\nthe men whose creed is imperial domination.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken now, surely, in terms too concrete to admit of any\r\nfurther doubt or question. An evident principle runs through the whole\r\nprogram I have outlined. It is the principle of justice to all peoples\r\nand nationalities, and their right to live on equal terms of liberty and\r\nsafety with one another, whether they be strong or weak. Unless this\r\nprinciple be made its foundation no part of the structure of\r\ninternational justice can stand. The people of the United States could\r\nact upon no other principle; and to the vindication of this principle\r\nthey are ready to devote their lives, their honor, and everything that\r\nthey possess. The moral climax of this the culminating and final war for\r\nhuman liberty has come, and they are ready to put their own strength,\r\ntheir own highest purpose, their own integrity and devotion to the test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORCE TO THE UTMOST\r\n\r\n[Speech at the Opening of the Third Liberty Loan Campaign, delivered in\r\nthe Fifth Regiment Armory, Baltimore, April 6, 1918.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:\r\n\r\nThis is the anniversary of our acceptance of Germany's challenge to\r\nfight for our right to live and be free, and for the sacred rights of\r\nfreemen everywhere. The nation is awake. There is no need to call to it.\r\nWe know what the war must cost, our utmost sacrifice, the lives of our\r\nfittest men, and, if need be, all that we possess.\r\n\r\nThe loan we are met to discuss is one of the least parts of what we are\r\ncalled upon to give and to do, though in itself imperative. The people\r\nof the whole country are alive to the necessity of it, and are ready to\r\nlend to the utmost, even where it involves a sharp skimping and daily\r\nsacrifice to lend out of meagre earnings. They will look with\r\nreprobation and contempt upon those who can and will not, upon those who\r\ndemand a higher rate of interest, upon those who think of it as a mere\r\ncommercial transaction. I have not come, therefore, to urge the loan. I\r\nhave come only to give you, if I can, a more vivid conception of what it\r\nis for.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for this great war, the reason why it had to come, the need\r\nto fight it through, and the issues that hang upon its outcome, are more\r\nclearly disclosed now than ever before. It is easy to see just what this\r\nparticular loan means, because the cause we are fighting for stands more\r\nsharply revealed than at any previous crisis of the momentous struggle.\r\nThe man who knows least can now see plainly how the cause of justice\r\nstands, and what is the imperishable thing he is asked to invest in. Men\r\nin America may be more sure than they ever were before that the cause is\r\ntheir own, and that, if it should be lost, their own great nation's\r\nplace and mission in the world would be lost with it.\r\n\r\nI call you to witness, my fellow-countrymen, that at no stage of this\r\nterrible business have I judged the purposes of Germany intemperately. I\r\nshould be ashamed in the presence of affairs so grave, so fraught with\r\nthe destinies of mankind throughout all the world, to speak with\r\ntruculence, to use the weak language of hatred or vindictive purpose. We\r\nmust judge as we would be judged. I have sought to learn the objects\r\nGermany has in this war from the mouths of her own spokesmen, and to\r\ndeal as frankly with them as I wished them to deal with me. I have laid\r\nbare our own ideals, our own purposes, without reserve or doubtful\r\nphrase, and have asked them to say as plainly what it is that they seek.\r\n\r\nWe have ourselves proposed no injustice, no aggression. We are ready,\r\nwhenever the final reckoning is made, to be just to the German people,\r\ndeal fairly with the German power, as with all others. There can be no\r\ndifference between peoples in the final judgment, if it is indeed to be\r\na righteous judgment. To propose anything but justice, even-handed and\r\ndispassionate justice, to Germany at any time, whatever the outcome of\r\nthe war, would be to renounce and dishonor our own cause, for we ask\r\nnothing that we are not willing to accord.\r\n\r\nIt has been with this thought that I have sought to learn from those who\r\nspoke for Germany whether it was justice or dominion and the execution\r\nof their own will upon the other nations of the world that the German\r\nleaders were seeking. They have answered--answered in unmistakable\r\nterms. They have avowed that it was not justice, but dominion and the\r\nunhindered execution of their own will. The avowal has not come from\r\nGermany's statesmen. It has come from her military leaders, who are her\r\nreal rulers. Her statesmen have said that they wished peace, and were\r\nready to discuss its terms whenever their opponents were willing to sit\r\ndown at the conference table with them. Her present Chancellor has\r\nsaid--in indefinite and uncertain terms, indeed, and in phrases that\r\noften seem to deny their own meaning, but with as much plainness as he\r\nthought prudent--that he believed that peace should be based upon the\r\nprinciples which we had declared would be our own in the final\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nAt Brest-Litovsk her civilian delegates spoke in similar terms;\r\nprofessed their desire to conclude a fair peace and accord to the\r\npeoples with whose fortunes they were dealing the right to choose their\r\nown allegiances. But action accompanied and followed the profession.\r\nTheir military masters, the men who act for Germany and exhibit her\r\npurpose in execution, proclaimed a very different conclusion. We can not\r\nmistake what they have done--in Russia, in Finland, in the Ukraine, in\r\nRumania. The real test of their justice and fair play has come. From\r\nthis we may judge the rest.\r\n\r\nThey are enjoying in Russia a cheap triumph in which no brave or gallant\r\nnation can long take pride. A great people, helpless by their own act,\r\nlies for the time at their mercy. Their fair professions are forgotten.\r\nThey nowhere set up justice, but everywhere impose their power and\r\nexploit everything for their own use and aggrandizement, and the peoples\r\nof conquered provinces are invited to be free under their dominion!\r\n\r\nAre we not justified in believing that they would do the same things at\r\ntheir western front if they were not there face to face with armies\r\nwhom even their countless divisions cannot overcome? If, when they have\r\nfelt their check to be final, they should propose favorable and\r\nequitable terms with regard to Belgium and France and Italy, could they\r\nblame us if we concluded that they did so only to assure themselves of a\r\nfree hand in Russia and the East?\r\n\r\nTheir purpose is, undoubtedly, to make all the Slavic peoples, all the\r\nfree and ambitious nations of the Baltic Peninsula, all the lands that\r\nTurkey has dominated and misruled, subject to their will and ambition,\r\nand build upon that dominion an empire of force upon which they fancy\r\nthat they can then erect an empire of gain and commercial supremacy--an\r\nempire as hostile to the Americas as to the Europe which it will\r\noverawe--an empire which will ultimately master Persia, India, and the\r\npeoples of the Far East.\r\n\r\nIn such a program our ideals, the ideals of justice and humanity and\r\nliberty, the principle of the free self-determination of nations, upon\r\nwhich all the modern world insists, can play no part. They are rejected\r\nfor the ideals of power, for the principle that the strong must rule the\r\nweak, that trade must follow the flag, whether those to whom it is taken\r\nwelcome it or not, that the peoples of the world are to be made subject\r\nto the patronage and overlordship of those who have the power to enforce\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThat program once carried out, America and all who care or dare to stand\r\nwith her must arm and prepare themselves to contest the mastery of the\r\nworld--a mastery in which the rights of common men, the rights of women\r\nand of all who are weak, must for the time being be trodden underfoot\r\nand disregarded and the old, age-long struggle for freedom and right\r\nbegin again at its beginning. Everything that America has lived for and\r\nloved and grown great to vindicate and bring to a glorious realization\r\nwill have fallen in utter ruin and the gates of mercy once more\r\npitilessly shut upon mankind!\r\n\r\nThe thing is preposterous and impossible; and yet is not that what the\r\nwhole course and action of the German armies has meant wherever they\r\nhave moved? I do not wish, even in this moment of utter disillusionment,\r\nto judge harshly or unrighteously. I judge only what the German arms\r\nhave accomplished with unpitying thoroughness throughout every fair\r\nregion they have touched.\r\n\r\nWhat, then are we to do? For myself, I am ready, ready still, ready even\r\nnow, to discuss a fair and just and honest peace at any time that it is\r\nsincerely purposed--a peace in which the strong and the weak shall fare\r\nalike. But the answer, when I proposed such a peace, came from the\r\nGerman commanders in Russia and I cannot mistake the meaning of the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nI accept the challenge. I know that you accept it. All the world shall\r\nknow that you accept it. It shall appear in the utter sacrifice and\r\nself-forgetfulness with which we shall give all that we love and all\r\nthat we have to redeem the world and make it fit for free men like\r\nourselves to live in. This now is the meaning of all that we do. Let\r\neverything that we say, my fellow-countrymen, everything that we\r\nhenceforth plan and accomplish, ring true to this response till the\r\nmajesty and might of our concerted power shall fill the thought and\r\nutterly defeat the force of those who flout and misprize what we honor\r\nand hold dear.\r\n\r\nGermany has once more said that force, and force alone, shall decide\r\nwhether justice and peace shall reign in the affairs of men, whether\r\nright as America conceives it or dominion as she conceives it shall\r\ndetermine the destinies of mankind. There is, therefore, but one\r\nresponse possible from us: Force, force to the utmost, force without\r\nstint or limit, the righteous and triumphant force which shall make\r\nright the law of the world and cast every selfish dominion down in the\r\ndust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH READINGS FOR SCHOOLS\r\n\r\n     \"Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an\r\n     exact man.\"\r\n\r\n     _Bacon._\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"'Tis the good reader that makes the good book.\"\r\n\r\n     _Emerson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's President Wilson's Addresses, by Woodrow Wilson",
