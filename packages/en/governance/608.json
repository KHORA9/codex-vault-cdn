Hicetid.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey, who to states and governors of the Commonwealth direct their\r\nspeech, High Court of Parliament, or, wanting such access in a private\r\ncondition, write that which they foresee may advance the public good;\r\nI suppose them, as at the beginning of no mean endeavour, not a little\r\naltered and moved inwardly in their minds: some with doubt of what will\r\nbe the success, others with fear of what will be the censure; some with\r\nhope, others with confidence of what they have to speak. And me perhaps\r\neach of these dispositions, as the subject was whereon I entered,\r\nmay have at other times variously affected; and likely might in these\r\nforemost expressions now also disclose which of them swayed most, but\r\nthat the very attempt of this address thus made, and the thought of whom\r\nit hath recourse to, hath got the power within me to a passion, far more\r\nwelcome than incidental to a preface.\r\n\r\nWhich though I stay not to confess ere any ask, I shall be blameless, if\r\nit be no other than the joy and gratulation which it brings to all who\r\nwish and promote their country's liberty; whereof this whole discourse\r\nproposed will be a certain testimony, if not a trophy. For this is not\r\nthe liberty which we can hope, that no grievance ever should arise\r\nin the Commonwealth--that let no man in this world expect; but when\r\ncomplaints are freely heard, deeply considered and speedily reformed,\r\nthen is the utmost bound of civil liberty attained that wise men look\r\nfor. To which if I now manifest by the very sound of this which I shall\r\nutter, that we are already in good part arrived, and yet from such\r\na steep disadvantage of tyranny and superstition grounded into our\r\nprinciples as was beyond the manhood of a Roman recovery, it will be\r\nattributed first, as is most due, to the strong assistance of God our\r\ndeliverer, next to your faithful guidance and undaunted wisdom, Lords\r\nand Commons of England. Neither is it in God's esteem the diminution\r\nof his glory, when honourable things are spoken of good men and worthy\r\nmagistrates; which if I now first should begin to do, after so fair a\r\nprogress of your laudable deeds, and such a long obligement upon the\r\nwhole realm to your indefatigable virtues, I might be justly reckoned\r\namong the tardiest, and the unwillingest of them that praise ye.\r\n\r\nNevertheless there being three principal things, without which all\r\npraising is but courtship and flattery: First, when that only is praised\r\nwhich is solidly worth praise: next, when greatest likelihoods are\r\nbrought that such things are truly and really in those persons to whom\r\nthey are ascribed: the other, when he who praises, by showing that such\r\nhis actual persuasion is of whom he writes, can demonstrate that he\r\nflatters not; the former two of these I have heretofore endeavoured,\r\nrescuing the employment from him who went about to impair your merits\r\nwith a trivial and malignant encomium; the latter as belonging chiefly\r\nto mine own acquittal, that whom I so extolled I did not flatter, hath\r\nbeen reserved opportunely to this occasion.\r\n\r\nFor he who freely magnifies what hath been nobly done, and fears not to\r\ndeclare as freely what might be done better, gives ye the best covenant\r\nof his fidelity; and that his loyalest affection and his hope waits on\r\nyour proceedings. His highest praising is not flattery, and his plainest\r\nadvice is a kind of praising. For though I should affirm and hold by\r\nargument, that it would fare better with truth, with learning and the\r\nCommonwealth, if one of your published Orders, which I should name, were\r\ncalled in; yet at the same time it could not but much redound to the\r\nlustre of your mild and equal government, whenas private persons are\r\nhereby animated to think ye better pleased with public advice, than\r\nother statists have been delighted heretofore with public flattery. And\r\nmen will then see what difference there is between the magnanimity of a\r\ntriennial Parliament, and that jealous haughtiness of prelates and cabin\r\ncounsellors that usurped of late, whenas they shall observe ye in the\r\nmidst of your victories and successes more gently brooking written\r\nexceptions against a voted Order than other courts, which had produced\r\nnothing worth memory but the weak ostentation of wealth, would have\r\nendured the least signified dislike at any sudden proclamation.\r\n\r\nIf I should thus far presume upon the meek demeanour of your civil and\r\ngentle greatness, Lords and Commons, as what your published Order hath\r\ndirectly said, that to gainsay, I might defend myself with ease, if any\r\nshould accuse me of being new or insolent, did they but know how much\r\nbetter I find ye esteem it to imitate the old and elegant humanity of\r\nGreece, than the barbaric pride of a Hunnish and Norwegian stateliness.\r\nAnd out of those ages, to whose polite wisdom and letters we owe that we\r\nare not yet Goths and Jutlanders, I could name him who from his private\r\nhouse wrote that discourse to the Parliament of Athens, that persuades\r\nthem to change the form of democracy which was then established. Such\r\nhonour was done in those days to men who professed the study of wisdom\r\nand eloquence, not only in their own country, but in other lands, that\r\ncities and signiories heard them gladly, and with great respect, if they\r\nhad aught in public to admonish the state. Thus did Dion Prusaeus, a\r\nstranger and a private orator, counsel the Rhodians against a former\r\nedict; and I abound with other like examples, which to set here would be\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\nBut if from the industry of a life wholly dedicated to studious labours,\r\nand those natural endowments haply not the worst for two and fifty\r\ndegrees of northern latitude, so much must be derogated, as to count me\r\nnot equal to any of those who had this privilege, I would obtain to be\r\nthought not so inferior, as yourselves are superior to the most of them\r\nwho received their counsel: and how far you excel them, be assured,\r\nLords and Commons, there can no greater testimony appear, than when\r\nyour prudent spirit acknowledges and obeys the voice of reason from what\r\nquarter soever it be heard speaking; and renders ye as willing to\r\nrepeal any Act of your own setting forth, as any set forth by your\r\npredecessors.\r\n\r\nIf ye be thus resolved, as it were injury to think ye were not, I know\r\nnot what should withhold me from presenting ye with a fit instance\r\nwherein to show both that love of truth which ye eminently profess, and\r\nthat uprightness of your judgment which is not wont to be partial to\r\nyourselves; by judging over again that Order which ye have ordained to\r\nregulate printing:--that no book, pamphlet, or paper shall be henceforth\r\nprinted, unless the same be first approved and licensed by such, or at\r\nleast one of such, as shall be thereto appointed. For that part which\r\npreserves justly every man's copy to himself, or provides for the poor,\r\nI touch not, only wish they be not made pretences to abuse and persecute\r\nhonest and painful men, who offend not in either of these particulars.\r\nBut that other clause of licensing books, which we thought had died with\r\nhis brother quadragesimal and matrimonial when the prelates expired, I\r\nshall now attend with such a homily, as shall lay before ye, first the\r\ninventors of it to be those whom ye will be loath to own; next what is\r\nto be thought in general of reading, whatever sort the books be;\r\nand that this Order avails nothing to the suppressing of scandalous,\r\nseditious, and libellous books, which were mainly intended to be\r\nsuppressed. Last, that it will be primely to the discouragement of all\r\nlearning, and the stop of truth, not only by disexercising and blunting\r\nour abilities in what we know already, but by hindering and cropping\r\nthe discovery that might be yet further made both in religious and civil\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nI deny not, but that it is of greatest concernment in the Church and\r\nCommonwealth, to have a vigilant eye how books demean themselves as well\r\nas men; and thereafter to confine, imprison, and do sharpest justice on\r\nthem as malefactors. For books are not absolutely dead things, but do\r\ncontain a potency of life in them to be as active as that soul was whose\r\nprogeny they are; nay, they do preserve as in a vial the purest efficacy\r\nand extraction of that living intellect that bred them. I know they\r\nare as lively, and as vigorously productive, as those fabulous dragon's\r\nteeth; and being sown up and down, may chance to spring up armed men.\r\nAnd yet, on the other hand, unless wariness be used, as good almost kill\r\na man as kill a good book. Who kills a man kills a reasonable creature,\r\nGod's image; but he who destroys a good book, kills reason itself, kills\r\nthe image of God, as it were in the eye. Many a man lives a burden\r\nto the earth; but a good book is the precious life-blood of a master\r\nspirit, embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life. 'Tis\r\ntrue, no age can restore a life, whereof perhaps there is no great loss;\r\nand revolutions of ages do not oft recover the loss of a rejected truth,\r\nfor the want of which whole nations fare the worse.\r\n\r\nWe should be wary therefore what persecution we raise against the living\r\nlabours of public men, how we spill that seasoned life of man, preserved\r\nand stored up in books; since we see a kind of homicide may be thus\r\ncommitted, sometimes a martyrdom, and if it extend to the whole\r\nimpression, a kind of massacre; whereof the execution ends not in the\r\nslaying of an elemental life, but strikes at that ethereal and fifth\r\nessence, the breath of reason itself, slays an immortality rather than\r\na life. But lest I should be condemned of introducing license, while I\r\noppose licensing, I refuse not the pains to be so much historical,\r\nas will serve to show what hath been done by ancient and famous\r\ncommonwealths against this disorder, till the very time that this\r\nproject of licensing crept out of the Inquisition, was catched up by our\r\nprelates, and hath caught some of our presbyters.\r\n\r\nIn Athens, where books and wits were ever busier than in any other part\r\nof Greece, I find but only two sorts of writings which the magistrate\r\ncared to take notice of; those either blasphemous and atheistical, or\r\nlibellous. Thus the books of Protagoras were by the judges of Areopagus\r\ncommanded to be burnt, and himself banished the territory for a\r\ndiscourse begun with his confessing not to know WHETHER THERE WERE GODS,\r\nOR WHETHER NOT. And against defaming, it was decreed that none should\r\nbe traduced by name, as was the manner of Vetus Comoedia, whereby we may\r\nguess how they censured libelling. And this course was quick enough, as\r\nCicero writes, to quell both the desperate wits of other atheists,\r\nand the open way of defaming, as the event showed. Of other sects and\r\nopinions, though tending to voluptuousness, and the denying of divine\r\nProvidence, they took no heed.\r\n\r\nTherefore we do not read that either Epicurus, or that libertine school\r\nof Cyrene, or what the Cynic impudence uttered, was ever questioned\r\nby the laws. Neither is it recorded that the writings of those old\r\ncomedians were suppressed, though the acting of them were forbid; and\r\nthat Plato commended the reading of Aristophanes, the loosest of them\r\nall, to his royal scholar Dionysius, is commonly known, and may be\r\nexcused, if holy Chrysostom, as is reported, nightly studied so much the\r\nsame author and had the art to cleanse a scurrilous vehemence into the\r\nstyle of a rousing sermon.\r\n\r\nThat other leading city of Greece, Lacedaemon, considering that Lycurgus\r\ntheir lawgiver was so addicted to elegant learning, as to have been the\r\nfirst that brought out of Ionia the scattered works of Homer, and sent\r\nthe poet Thales from Crete to prepare and mollify the Spartan surliness\r\nwith his smooth songs and odes, the better to plant among them law and\r\ncivility, it is to be wondered how museless and unbookish they were,\r\nminding nought but the feats of war. There needed no licensing of books\r\namong them, for they disliked all but their own laconic apophthegms, and\r\ntook a slight occasion to chase Archilochus out of their city, perhaps\r\nfor composing in a higher strain than their own soldierly ballads and\r\nroundels could reach to. Or if it were for his broad verses, they were\r\nnot therein so cautious but they were as dissolute in their promiscuous\r\nconversing; whence Euripides affirms in Andromache, that their women\r\nwere all unchaste. Thus much may give us light after what sort of books\r\nwere prohibited among the Greeks.\r\n\r\nThe Romans also, for many ages trained up only to a military roughness\r\nresembling most the Lacedaemonian guise, knew of learning little but\r\nwhat their twelve Tables, and the Pontific College with their augurs\r\nand flamens taught them in religion and law; so unacquainted with other\r\nlearning, that when Carneades and Critolaus, with the Stoic Diogenes,\r\ncoming ambassadors to Rome, took thereby occasion to give the city a\r\ntaste of their philosophy, they were suspected for seducers by no less\r\na man than Cato the Censor, who moved it in the Senate to dismiss them\r\nspeedily, and to banish all such Attic babblers out of Italy. But Scipio\r\nand others of the noblest senators withstood him and his old Sabine\r\nausterity; honoured and admired the men; and the censor himself at\r\nlast, in his old age, fell to the study of that whereof before he was\r\nso scrupulous. And yet at the same time Naevius and Plautus, the first\r\nLatin comedians, had filled the city with all the borrowed scenes of\r\nMenander and Philemon. Then began to be considered there also what was\r\nto be done to libellous books and authors; for Naevius was quickly cast\r\ninto prison for his unbridled pen, and released by the tribunes upon\r\nhis recantation; we read also that libels were burnt, and the makers\r\npunished by Augustus. The like severity, no doubt, was used, if aught\r\nwere impiously written against their esteemed gods. Except in these two\r\npoints, how the world went in books, the magistrate kept no reckoning.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore Lucretius without impeachment versifies his Epicurism to\r\nMemmius, and had the honour to be set forth the second time by Cicero,\r\nso great a father of the Commonwealth; although himself disputes against\r\nthat opinion in his own writings. Nor was the satirical sharpness or\r\nnaked plainness of Lucilius, or Catullus, or Flaccus, by any order\r\nprohibited. And for matters of state, the story of Titus Livius, though\r\nit extolled that part which Pompey held, was not therefore suppressed by\r\nOctavius Caesar of the other faction. But that Naso was by him banished\r\nin his old age, for the wanton poems of his youth, was but a mere covert\r\nof state over some secret cause: and besides, the books were neither\r\nbanished nor called in. From hence we shall meet with little else but\r\ntyranny in the Roman empire, that we may not marvel, if not so often bad\r\nas good books were silenced. I shall therefore deem to have been large\r\nenough, in producing what among the ancients was punishable to write;\r\nsave only which, all other arguments were free to treat on.\r\n\r\nBy this time the emperors were become Christians, whose discipline in\r\nthis point I do not find to have been more severe than what was formerly\r\nin practice. The books of those whom they took to be grand heretics were\r\nexamined, refuted, and condemned in the general Councils; and not till\r\nthen were prohibited, or burnt, by authority of the emperor. As for the\r\nwritings of heathen authors, unless they were plain invectives against\r\nChristianity, as those of Porphyrius and Proclus, they met with no\r\ninterdict that can be cited, till about the year 400, in a Carthaginian\r\nCouncil, wherein bishops themselves were forbid to read the books of\r\nGentiles, but heresies they might read: while others long before them,\r\non the contrary, scrupled more the books of heretics than of Gentiles.\r\nAnd that the primitive Councils and bishops were wont only to declare\r\nwhat books were not commendable, passing no further, but leaving it to\r\neach one's conscience to read or to lay by, till after the year 800,\r\nis observed already by Padre Paolo, the great unmasker of the Trentine\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nAfter which time the Popes of Rome, engrossing what they pleased of\r\npolitical rule into their own hands, extended their dominion over men's\r\neyes, as they had before over their judgments, burning and prohibiting\r\nto be read what they fancied not; yet sparing in their censures, and the\r\nbooks not many which they so dealt with: till Martin V., by his bull,\r\nnot only prohibited, but was the first that excommunicated the reading\r\nof heretical books; for about that time Wickliffe and Huss, growing\r\nterrible, were they who first drove the Papal Court to a stricter policy\r\nof prohibiting. Which course Leo X. and his successors followed, until\r\nthe Council of Trent and the Spanish Inquisition engendering together\r\nbrought forth, or perfected, those Catalogues and expurging Indexes,\r\nthat rake through the entrails of many an old good author, with a\r\nviolation worse than any could be offered to his tomb. Nor did they stay\r\nin matters heretical, but any subject that was not to their palate,\r\nthey either condemned in a Prohibition, or had it straight into the new\r\npurgatory of an index.\r\n\r\nTo fill up the measure of encroachment, their last invention was to\r\nordain that no book, pamphlet, or paper should be printed (as if St.\r\nPeter had bequeathed them the keys of the press also out of Paradise)\r\nunless it were approved and licensed under the hands of two or three\r\nglutton friars. For example:\r\n\r\n     Let the Chancellor Cini be pleased to see if in this present\r\n     work be contained aught that may withstand the printing.\r\n\r\n     VINCENT RABBATTA,  Vicar of Florence.\r\n\r\n\r\n     I have seen this present work, and find nothing athwart the\r\n     Catholic faith and good manners: in witness whereof I\r\n     have given, etc.\r\n\r\n     NICOLO GINI,  Chancellor of Florence.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Attending the precedent relation, it is allowed that this\r\n     present work of Davanzati may be printed.\r\n\r\n     VINCENT RABBATTA,  etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n     It may be printed, July 15.\r\n\r\n     FRIAR SIMON MOMPEI D'AMELIA,\r\n     Chancellor of the Holy Office in Florence.\r\n\r\nSure they have a conceit, if he of the bottomless pit had not long since\r\nbroke prison, that this quadruple exorcism would bar him down. I fear\r\ntheir next design will be to get into their custody the licensing\r\nof that which they say Claudius intended, but went not through with.\r\nVouchsafe to see another of their forms, the Roman stamp:\r\n\r\n     Imprimatur, If it seem good to the reverend Master of the\r\n     Holy Palace.\r\n\r\n     BELCASTRO,  Vicegerent.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Imprimatur, Friar Nicolo Rodolphi, Master of the Holy Palace.\r\n\r\nSometimes five Imprimaturs are seen together dialogue-wise in the piazza\r\nof one title-page, complimenting and ducking each to other with their\r\nshaven reverences, whether the author, who stands by in perplexity at\r\nthe foot of his epistle, shall to the press or to the sponge. These\r\nare the pretty responsories, these are the dear antiphonies, that so\r\nbewitched of late our prelates and their chaplains with the goodly echo\r\nthey made; and besotted us to the gay imitation of a lordly Imprimatur,\r\none from Lambeth House, another from the west end of Paul's; so apishly\r\nRomanizing, that the word of command still was set down in Latin; as\r\nif the learned grammatical pen that wrote it would cast no ink without\r\nLatin; or perhaps, as they thought, because no vulgar tongue was worthy\r\nto express the pure conceit of an Imprimatur, but rather, as I hope, for\r\nthat our English, the language of men ever famous and foremost in the\r\nachievements of liberty, will not easily find servile letters enow to\r\nspell such a dictatory presumption English.\r\n\r\nAnd thus ye have the inventors and the original of book-licensing ripped\r\nup and drawn as lineally as any pedigree. We have it not, that can\r\nbe heard of, from any ancient state, or polity or church; nor by any\r\nstatute left us by our ancestors elder or later; nor from the modern\r\ncustom of any reformed city or church abroad, but from the most\r\nanti-christian council and the most tyrannous inquisition that ever\r\ninquired. Till then books were ever as freely admitted into the world\r\nas any other birth; the issue of the brain was no more stifled than the\r\nissue of the womb: no envious Juno sat cross-legged over the nativity\r\nof any man's intellectual offspring; but if it proved a monster, who\r\ndenies, but that it was justly burnt, or sunk into the sea? But that a\r\nbook, in worse condition than a peccant soul, should be to stand before\r\na jury ere it be born to the world, and undergo yet in darkness the\r\njudgment of Radamanth and his colleagues, ere it can pass the ferry\r\nbackward into light, was never heard before, till that mysterious\r\niniquity, provoked and troubled at the first entrance of Reformation,\r\nsought out new limbos and new hells wherein they might include our books\r\nalso within the number of their damned. And this was the rare morsel\r\nso officiously snatched up, and so ill-favouredly imitated by our\r\ninquisiturient bishops, and the attendant minorites their chaplains.\r\nThat ye like not now these most certain authors of this licensing order,\r\nand that all sinister intention was far distant from your thoughts, when\r\nye were importuned the passing it, all men who know the integrity of\r\nyour actions, and how ye honour truth, will clear ye readily.\r\n\r\nBut some will say, what though the inventors were bad, the thing for\r\nall that may be good? It may so; yet if that thing be no such deep\r\ninvention, but obvious, and easy for any man to light on, and yet best\r\nand wisest commonwealths through all ages and occasions have forborne\r\nto use it, and falsest seducers and oppressors of men were the first who\r\ntook it up, and to no other purpose but to obstruct and hinder the first\r\napproach of Reformation; I am of those who believe it will be a harder\r\nalchemy than Lullius ever knew, to sublimate any good use out of such\r\nan invention. Yet this only is what I request to gain from this reason,\r\nthat it may be held a dangerous and suspicious fruit, as certainly it\r\ndeserves, for the tree that bore it, until I can dissect one by one the\r\nproperties it has. But I have first to finish, as was propounded, what\r\nis to be thought in general of reading books, whatever sort they be, and\r\nwhether be more the benefit or the harm that thence proceeds.\r\n\r\nNot to insist upon the examples of Moses, Daniel, and Paul, who were\r\nskilful in all the learning of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Greeks,\r\nwhich could not probably be without reading their books of all sorts;\r\nin Paul especially, who thought it no defilement to insert into\r\nHoly Scripture the sentences of three Greek poets, and one of them a\r\ntragedian; the question was notwithstanding sometimes controverted among\r\nthe primitive doctors, but with great odds on that side which affirmed\r\nit both lawful and profitable; as was then evidently perceived, when\r\nJulian the Apostate and subtlest enemy to our faith made a decree\r\nforbidding Christians the study of heathen learning: for, said he, they\r\nwound us with our own weapons, and with our own arts and sciences they\r\novercome us. And indeed the Christians were put so to their shifts by\r\nthis crafty means, and so much in danger to decline into all ignorance,\r\nthat the two Apollinarii were fain, as a man may say, to coin all the\r\nseven liberal sciences out of the Bible, reducing it into divers\r\nforms of orations, poems, dialogues, even to the calculating of a new\r\nChristian grammar. But, saith the historian Socrates, the providence of\r\nGod provided better than the industry of Apollinarius and his son, by\r\ntaking away that illiterate law with the life of him who devised it. So\r\ngreat an injury they then held it to be deprived of Hellenic learning;\r\nand thought it a persecution more undermining, and secretly decaying the\r\nChurch, than the open cruelty of Decius or Diocletian.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps it was the same politic drift that the devil whipped St.\r\nJerome in a lenten dream, for reading Cicero; or else it was a phantasm\r\nbred by the fever which had then seized him. For had an angel been his\r\ndiscipliner, unless it were for dwelling too much upon Ciceronianisms,\r\nand had chastised the reading, not the vanity, it had been plainly\r\npartial; first to correct him for grave Cicero, and not for scurril\r\nPlautus, whom he confesses to have been reading, not long before; next\r\nto correct him only, and let so many more ancient fathers wax old in\r\nthose pleasant and florid studies without the lash of such a tutoring\r\napparition; insomuch that Basil teaches how some good use may be made\r\nof Margites, a sportful poem, not now extant, writ by Homer; and why not\r\nthen of Morgante, an Italian romance much to the same purpose?\r\n\r\nBut if it be agreed we shall be tried by visions, there is a vision\r\nrecorded by Eusebius, far ancienter than this tale of Jerome, to the\r\nnun Eustochium, and, besides, has nothing of a fever in it. Dionysius\r\nAlexandrinus was about the year 240 a person of great name in the Church\r\nfor piety and learning, who had wont to avail himself much against\r\nheretics by being conversant in their books; until a certain presbyter\r\nlaid it scrupulously to his conscience, how he durst venture himself\r\namong those defiling volumes. The worthy man, loath to give offence,\r\nfell into a new debate with himself what was to be thought; when\r\nsuddenly a vision sent from God (it is his own epistle that so avers it)\r\nconfirmed him in these words: READ ANY BOOKS WHATEVER COME TO THY HANDS,\r\nFOR THOU ART SUFFICIENT BOTH TO JUDGE ARIGHT AND TO EXAMINE EACH MATTER.\r\nTo this revelation he assented the sooner, as he confesses, because it\r\nwas answerable to that of the Apostle to the Thessalonians, PROVE ALL\r\nTHINGS, HOLD FAST THAT WHICH IS GOOD. And he might have added another\r\nremarkable saying of the same author: TO THE PURE, ALL THINGS ARE PURE;\r\nnot only meats and drinks, but all kind of knowledge whether of good or\r\nevil; the knowledge cannot defile, nor consequently the books, if the\r\nwill and conscience be not defiled.\r\n\r\nFor books are as meats and viands are; some of good, some of evil\r\nsubstance; and yet God, in that unapocryphal vision, said without\r\nexception, RISE, PETER, KILL AND EAT, leaving the choice to each man's\r\ndiscretion. Wholesome meats to a vitiated stomach differ little or\r\nnothing from unwholesome; and best books to a naughty mind are not\r\nunappliable to occasions of evil. Bad meats will scarce breed good\r\nnourishment in the healthiest concoction; but herein the difference is\r\nof bad books, that they to a discreet and judicious reader serve in\r\nmany respects to discover, to confute, to forewarn, and to illustrate.\r\nWhereof what better witness can ye expect I should produce, than one of\r\nyour own now sitting in Parliament, the chief of learned men reputed in\r\nthis land, Mr. Selden; whose volume of natural and national laws proves,\r\nnot only by great authorities brought together, but by exquisite reasons\r\nand theorems almost mathematically demonstrative, that all opinions, yea\r\nerrors, known, read, and collated, are of main service and assistance\r\ntoward the speedy attainment of what is truest. I conceive, therefore,\r\nthat when God did enlarge the universal diet of man's body, saving ever\r\nthe rules of temperance, he then also, as before, left arbitrary the\r\ndieting and repasting of our minds; as wherein every mature man might\r\nhave to exercise his own leading capacity.\r\n\r\nHow great a virtue is temperance, how much of moment through the whole\r\nlife of man! Yet God commits the managing so great a trust, without\r\nparticular law or prescription, wholly to the demeanour of every grown\r\nman. And therefore when he himself tabled the Jews from heaven, that\r\nomer, which was every man's daily portion of manna, is computed to have\r\nbeen more than might have well sufficed the heartiest feeder thrice as\r\nmany meals. For those actions which enter into a man, rather than issue\r\nout of him, and therefore defile not, God uses not to captivate under\r\na perpetual childhood of prescription, but trusts him with the gift\r\nof reason to be his own chooser; there were but little work left for\r\npreaching, if law and compulsion should grow so fast upon those things\r\nwhich heretofore were governed only by exhortation. Solomon informs us,\r\nthat much reading is a weariness to the flesh; but neither he nor other\r\ninspired author tells us that such or such reading is unlawful: yet\r\ncertainly had God thought good to limit us herein, it had been much more\r\nexpedient to have told us what was unlawful than what was wearisome.\r\nAs for the burning of those Ephesian books by St. Paul's converts;\r\n'tis replied the books were magic, the Syriac so renders them. It was\r\na private act, a voluntary act, and leaves us to a voluntary imitation:\r\nthe men in remorse burnt those books which were their own; the\r\nmagistrate by this example is not appointed; these men practised the\r\nbooks, another might perhaps have read them in some sort usefully.\r\n\r\nGood and evil we know in the field of this world grow up together almost\r\ninseparably; and the knowledge of good is so involved and interwoven\r\nwith the knowledge of evil, and in so many cunning resemblances hardly\r\nto be discerned, that those confused seeds which were imposed upon\r\nPsyche as an incessant labour to cull out, and sort asunder, were not\r\nmore intermixed. It was from out the rind of one apple tasted, that the\r\nknowledge of good and evil, as two twins cleaving together, leaped forth\r\ninto the world. And perhaps this is that doom which Adam fell into\r\nof knowing good and evil, that is to say of knowing good by evil. As\r\ntherefore the state of man now is; what wisdom can there be to choose,\r\nwhat continence to forbear without the knowledge of evil? He that can\r\napprehend and consider vice with all her baits and seeming pleasures,\r\nand yet abstain, and yet distinguish, and yet prefer that which is truly\r\nbetter, he is the true warfaring Christian.\r\n\r\nI cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue, unexercised and\r\nunbreathed, that never sallies out and sees her adversary but slinks out\r\nof the race, where that immortal garland is to be run for, not without\r\ndust and heat. Assuredly we bring not innocence into the world, we bring\r\nimpurity much rather; that which purifies us is trial, and trial is by\r\nwhat is contrary. That virtue therefore which is but a youngling in the\r\ncontemplation of evil, and knows not the utmost that vice promises to\r\nher followers, and rejects it, is but a blank virtue, not a pure; her\r\nwhiteness is but an excremental whiteness. Which was the reason why our\r\nsage and serious poet Spenser, whom I dare be known to think a better\r\nteacher than Scotus or Aquinas, describing true temperance under the\r\nperson of Guion, brings him in with his palmer through the cave of\r\nMammon, and the bower of earthly bliss, that he might see and know, and\r\nyet abstain. Since therefore the knowledge and survey of vice is in this\r\nworld so necessary to the constituting of human virtue, and the scanning\r\nof error to the confirmation of truth, how can we more safely, and with\r\nless danger, scout into the regions of sin and falsity than by reading\r\nall manner of tractates and hearing all manner of reason? And this is\r\nthe benefit which may be had of books promiscuously read.\r\n\r\nBut of the harm that may result hence three kinds are usually reckoned.\r\nFirst, is feared the infection that may spread; but then all human learning\r\nand controversy in religious points must remove out of the world, yea the\r\nBible itself; for that ofttimes relates blasphemy not nicely, it describes\r\nthe carnal sense of wicked men not unelegantly, it brings in holiest men\r\npassionately murmuring against Providence through all the arguments of\r\nEpicurus: in other great disputes it answers dubiously and darkly to the\r\ncommon reader. And ask a Talmudist what ails the modesty of his marginal\r\nKeri, that Moses and all the prophets cannot persuade him to pronounce the\r\ntextual Chetiv. For these causes we all know the Bible itself put by the\r\nPapist put by the Papist into the first rank of prohibited books. The\r\nancientest Fathers must be next removed, as Clement of Alexandria, and that\r\nEusebian book of Evangelic preparation, transmitting our ears through a\r\nhoard of heathenish obscenities to receive the Gospel. Who finds not that\r\nIrenaeus, Epiphanius, Jerome, and others discover more heresies than they\r\nwell confute, and that oft for heresy which is the truer opinion?\r\n\r\nNor boots it to say for these, and all the heathen writers of greatest\r\ninfection, if it must be thought so, with whom is bound up the life of\r\nhuman learning, that they writ in an unknown tongue, so long as we are\r\nsure those languages are known as well to the worst of men, who are both\r\nmost able and most diligent to instil the poison they suck, first into\r\nthe courts of princes, acquainting them with the choicest delights and\r\ncriticisms of sin. As perhaps did that Petronius whom Nero called his\r\nArbiter, the master of his revels; and the notorious ribald of Arezzo,\r\ndreaded and yet dear to the Italian courtiers. I name not him for\r\nposterity's sake, whom Henry VIII. named in merriment his vicar of hell.\r\nBy which compendious way all the contagion that foreign books can infuse\r\nwill find a passage to the people far easier and shorter than an\r\nIndian voyage, though it could be sailed either by the north of Cataio\r\neastward, or of Canada westward, while our Spanish licensing gags the\r\nEnglish press never so severely.\r\n\r\nBut on the other side that infection which is from books of controversy\r\nin religion is more doubtful and dangerous to the learned than to\r\nthe ignorant; and yet those books must be permitted untouched by the\r\nlicenser. It will be hard to instance where any ignorant man hath been\r\never seduced by papistical book in English, unless it were commended and\r\nexpounded to him by some of that clergy: and indeed all such tractates,\r\nwhether false or true, are as the prophecy of Isaiah was to the eunuch,\r\nnot to be UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT A GUIDE. But of our priests and doctors\r\nhow many have been corrupted by studying the comments of Jesuits and\r\nSorbonists, and how fast they could transfuse that corruption into the\r\npeople, our experience is both late and sad. It is not forgot, since the\r\nacute and distinct Arminius was perverted merely by the perusing of a\r\nnameless discourse written at Delft, which at first he took in hand to\r\nconfute.\r\n\r\nSeeing, therefore, that those books, and those in great abundance, which\r\nare likeliest to taint both life and doctrine, cannot be suppressed\r\nwithout the fall of learning and of all ability in disputation, and that\r\nthese books of either sort are most and soonest catching to the learned,\r\nfrom whom to the common people whatever is heretical or dissolute may\r\nquickly be conveyed, and that evil manners are as perfectly learnt\r\nwithout books a thousand other ways which cannot be stopped, and evil\r\ndoctrine not with books can propagate, except a teacher guide, which he\r\nmight also do without writing, and so beyond prohibiting, I am not able\r\nto unfold, how this cautelous enterprise of licensing can be exempted\r\nfrom the number of vain and impossible attempts. And he who were\r\npleasantly disposed could not well avoid to liken it to the exploit of\r\nthat gallant man who thought to pound up the crows by shutting his park\r\ngate.\r\n\r\nBesides another inconvenience, if learned men be the first receivers out\r\nof books and dispreaders both of vice and error, how shall the licensers\r\nthemselves be confided in, unless we can confer upon them, or they\r\nassume to themselves above all others in the land, the grace of\r\ninfallibility and uncorruptedness? And again, if it be true that a wise\r\nman, like a good refiner, can gather gold out of the drossiest volume,\r\nand that a fool will be a fool with the best book, yea or without book;\r\nthere is no reason that we should deprive a wise man of any advantage\r\nto his wisdom, while we seek to restrain from a fool, that which being\r\nrestrained will be no hindrance to his folly. For if there should be so\r\nmuch exactness always used to keep that from him which is unfit for his\r\nreading, we should in the judgment of Aristotle not only, but of Solomon\r\nand of our Saviour, not vouchsafe him good precepts, and by consequence\r\nnot willingly admit him to good books; as being certain that a wise man\r\nwill make better use of an idle pamphlet, than a fool will do of sacred\r\nScripture.\r\n\r\n'Tis next alleged we must not expose ourselves to temptations without\r\nnecessity, and next to that, not employ our time in vain things. To both\r\nthese objections one answer will serve, out of the grounds already laid,\r\nthat to all men such books are not temptations, nor vanities, but useful\r\ndrugs and materials wherewith to temper and compose effective and strong\r\nmedicines, which man's life cannot want. The rest, as children and\r\nchildish men, who have not the art to qualify and prepare these working\r\nminerals, well may be exhorted to forbear, but hindered forcibly they\r\ncannot be by all the licensing that Sainted Inquisition could ever yet\r\ncontrive. Which is what I promised to deliver next: that this order of\r\nlicensing conduces nothing to the end for which it was framed; and hath\r\nalmost prevented me by being clear already while thus much hath been\r\nexplaining. See the ingenuity of Truth, who, when she gets a free and\r\nwilling hand, opens herself faster than the pace of method and discourse\r\ncan overtake her.\r\n\r\nIt was the task which I began with, to show that no nation, or\r\nwell-instituted state, if they valued books at all, did ever use this\r\nway of licensing; and it might be answered, that this is a piece of\r\nprudence lately discovered. To which I return, that as it was a thing\r\nslight and obvious to think on, so if it had been difficult to find\r\nout, there wanted not among them long since who suggested such a course;\r\nwhich they not following, leave us a pattern of their judgment that it\r\nwas not the rest knowing, but the not approving, which was the cause of\r\ntheir not using it.\r\n\r\nPlato, a man of high authority, indeed, but least of all for his\r\nCommonwealth, in the book of his Laws, which no city ever yet received,\r\nfed his fancy by making many edicts to his airy burgomasters, which they\r\nwho otherwise admire him wish had been rather buried and excused in\r\nthe genial cups of an Academic night sitting. By which laws he seems to\r\ntolerate no kind of learning but by unalterable decree, consisting most\r\nof practical traditions, to the attainment whereof a library of smaller\r\nbulk than his own Dialogues would be abundant. And there also enacts,\r\nthat no poet should so much as read to any private man what he had\r\nwritten, until the judges and law-keepers had seen it, and allowed it.\r\nBut that Plato meant this law peculiarly to that commonwealth which\r\nhe had imagined, and to no other, is evident. Why was he not else a\r\nlawgiver to himself, but a transgressor, and to be expelled by his own\r\nmagistrates; both for the wanton epigrams and dialogues which he made,\r\nand his perpetual reading of Sophron Mimus and Aristophanes, books of\r\ngrossest infamy, and also for commending the latter of them, though\r\nhe were the malicious libeller of his chief friends, to be read by the\r\ntyrant Dionysius, who had little need of such trash to spend his\r\ntime on? But that he knew this licensing of poems had reference\r\nand dependence to many other provisos there set down in his fancied\r\nrepublic, which in this world could have no place: and so neither he\r\nhimself, nor any magistrate or city, ever imitated that course, which,\r\ntaken apart from those other collateral injunctions, must needs be vain\r\nand fruitless. For if they fell upon one kind of strictness, unless\r\ntheir care were equal to regulate all other things of like aptness to\r\ncorrupt the mind, that single endeavour they knew would be but a\r\nfond labour; to shut and fortify one gate against corruption, and be\r\nnecessitated to leave others round about wide open.\r\n\r\nIf we think to regulate printing, thereby to rectify manners, we must\r\nregulate all recreation and pastimes, all that is delightful to man.\r\nNo music must be heard, no song be set or sung, but what is grave and\r\nDoric. There must be licensing dancers, that no gesture, motion, or\r\ndeportment be taught our youth but what by their allowance shall be\r\nthought honest; for such Plato was provided of. It will ask more than\r\nthe work of twenty licensers to examine all the lutes, the violins, and\r\nthe guitars in every house; they must not be suffered to prattle as they\r\ndo, but must be licensed what they may say. And who shall silence all\r\nthe airs and madrigals that whisper softness in chambers? The windows\r\nalso, and the balconies must be thought on; there are shrewd books, with\r\ndangerous frontispieces, set to sale; who shall prohibit them, shall\r\ntwenty licensers? The villages also must have their visitors to inquire\r\nwhat lectures the bagpipe and the rebeck reads, even to the ballatry\r\nand the gamut of every municipal fiddler, for these are the countryman's\r\nArcadias, and his Monte Mayors.\r\n\r\nNext, what more national corruption, for which England hears ill abroad,\r\nthan household gluttony: who shall be the rectors of our daily rioting?\r\nAnd what shall be done to inhibit the multitudes that frequent those\r\nhouses where drunkenness is sold and harboured? Our garments also should\r\nbe referred to the licensing of some more sober workmasters to see\r\nthem cut into a less wanton garb. Who shall regulate all the mixed\r\nconversation of our youth, male and female together, as is the fashion\r\nof this country? Who shall still appoint what shall be discoursed, what\r\npresumed, and no further? Lastly, who shall forbid and separate all idle\r\nresort, all evil company? These things will be, and must be; but how\r\nthey shall be least hurtful, how least enticing, herein consists the\r\ngrave and governing wisdom of a state.\r\n\r\nTo sequester out of the world into Atlantic and Utopian polities, which\r\nnever can be drawn into use, will not mend our condition; but to ordain\r\nwisely as in this world of evil, in the midst whereof God hath placed\r\nus unavoidably. Nor is it Plato's licensing of books will do this, which\r\nnecessarily pulls along with it so many other kinds of licensing, as\r\nwill make us all both ridiculous and weary, and yet frustrate; but\r\nthose unwritten, or at least unconstraining, laws of virtuous education,\r\nreligious and civil nurture, which Plato there mentions as the bonds and\r\nligaments of the commonwealth, the pillars and the sustainers of every\r\nwritten statute; these they be which will bear chief sway in such\r\nmatters as these, when all licensing will be easily eluded. Impunity and\r\nremissness, for certain, are the bane of a commonwealth; but here the\r\ngreat art lies, to discern in what the law is to bid restraint and\r\npunishment, and in what things persuasion only is to work.\r\n\r\nIf every action, which is good or evil in man at ripe years, were to be\r\nunder pittance and prescription and compulsion, what were virtue but a\r\nname, what praise could be then due to well-doing, what gramercy to\r\nbe sober, just, or continent? Many there be that complain of divine\r\nProvidence for suffering Adam to transgress; foolish tongues! When\r\nGod gave him reason, he gave him freedom to choose, for reason is but\r\nchoosing; he had been else a mere artificial Adam, such an Adam as he is\r\nin the motions. We ourselves esteem not of that obedience, or love, or\r\ngift, which is of force: God therefore left him free, set before him a\r\nprovoking object, ever almost in his eyes; herein consisted his merit,\r\nherein the right of his reward, the praise of his abstinence. Wherefore\r\ndid he create passions within us, pleasures round about us, but that\r\nthese rightly tempered are the very ingredients of virtue?\r\n\r\nThey are not skilful considerers of human things, who imagine to remove\r\nsin by removing the matter of sin; for, besides that it is a huge heap\r\nincreasing under the very act of diminishing, though some part of it may\r\nfor a time be withdrawn from some persons, it cannot from all, in such a\r\nuniversal thing as books are; and when this is done, yet the sin remains\r\nentire. Though ye take from a covetous man all his treasure, he has yet\r\none jewel left, ye cannot bereave him of his covetousness. Banish all\r\nobjects of lust, shut up all youth into the severest discipline that can\r\nbe exercised in any hermitage, ye cannot make them chaste, that came not\r\nhither so; such great care and wisdom is required to the right managing\r\nof this point. Suppose we could expel sin by this means; look how much\r\nwe thus expel of sin, so much we expel of virtue: for the matter of them\r\nboth is the same; remove that, and ye remove them both alike.\r\n\r\nThis justifies the high providence of God, who, though he command us\r\ntemperance, justice, continence, yet pours out before us, even to a\r\nprofuseness, all desirable things, and gives us minds that can wander\r\nbeyond all limit and satiety. Why should we then affect a rigour\r\ncontrary to the manner of God and of nature, by abridging or scanting\r\nthose means, which books freely permitted are, both to the trial of\r\nvirtue and the exercise of truth? It would be better done, to learn\r\nthat the law must needs be frivolous, which goes to restrain things,\r\nuncertainly and yet equally working to good and to evil. And were I the\r\nchooser, a dream of well-doing should be preferred before many times\r\nas much the forcible hindrance of evil-doing. For God sure esteems the\r\ngrowth and completing of one virtuous person more than the restraint of\r\nten vicious.\r\n\r\nAnd albeit whatever thing we hear or see, sitting, walking, travelling,\r\nor conversing, may be fitly called our book, and is of the same effect\r\nthat writings are, yet grant the thing to be prohibited were only books,\r\nit appears that this Order hitherto is far insufficient to the end\r\nwhich it intends. Do we not see, not once or oftener, but weekly, that\r\ncontinued court-libel against the Parliament and City, printed, as the\r\nwet sheets can witness, and dispersed among us, for all that licensing\r\ncan do? Yet this is the prime service a man would think, wherein this\r\nOrder should give proof of itself. If it were executed, you'll say.\r\nBut certain, if execution be remiss or blindfold now, and in this\r\nparticular, what will it be hereafter and in other books? If then the\r\nOrder shall not be vain and frustrate, behold a new labour, Lords and\r\nCommons, ye must repeal and proscribe all scandalous and unlicensed\r\nbooks already printed and divulged; after ye have drawn them up into a\r\nlist, that all may know which are condemned, and which not; and ordain\r\nthat no foreign books be delivered out of custody, till they have\r\nbeen read over. This office will require the whole time of not a few\r\noverseers, and those no vulgar men. There be also books which are partly\r\nuseful and excellent, partly culpable and pernicious; this work will ask\r\nas many more officials, to make expurgations and expunctions, that the\r\ncommonwealth of learning be not damnified. In fine, when the multitude\r\nof books increase upon their hands, ye must be fain to catalogue all\r\nthose printers who are found frequently offending, and forbid the\r\nimportation of their whole suspected typography. In a word, that this\r\nyour Order may be exact and not deficient, ye must reform it perfectly\r\naccording to the model of Trent and Seville, which I know ye abhor to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nYet though ye should condescend to this, which God forbid, the Order\r\nstill would be but fruitless and defective to that end whereto ye meant\r\nit. If to prevent sects and schisms, who is so unread or so uncatechized\r\nin story, that hath not heard of many sects refusing books as a\r\nhindrance, and preserving their doctrine unmixed for many ages, only by\r\nunwritten traditions? The Christian faith, for that was once a schism,\r\nis not unknown to have spread all over Asia, ere any Gospel or Epistle\r\nwas seen in writing. If the amendment of manners be aimed at, look into\r\nItaly and Spain, whether those places be one scruple the better, the\r\nhonester, the wiser, the chaster, since all the inquisitional rigour\r\nthat hath been executed upon books.\r\n\r\nAnother reason, whereby to make it plain that this Order will miss\r\nthe end it seeks, consider by the quality which ought to be in every\r\nlicenser. It cannot be denied but that he who is made judge to sit upon\r\nthe birth or death of books, whether they may be wafted into this world\r\nor not, had need to be a man above the common measure, both studious,\r\nlearned, and judicious; there may be else no mean mistakes in the\r\ncensure of what is passable or not; which is also no mean injury. If\r\nhe be of such worth as behooves him, there cannot be a more tedious and\r\nunpleasing journey-work, a greater loss of time levied upon his head,\r\nthan to be made the perpetual reader of unchosen books and pamphlets,\r\nofttimes huge volumes. There is no book that is acceptable unless at\r\ncertain seasons; but to be enjoined the reading of that at all times,\r\nand in a hand scarce legible, whereof three pages would not down at any\r\ntime in the fairest print, is an imposition which I cannot believe\r\nhow he that values time and his own studies, or is but of a sensible\r\nnostril, should be able to endure. In this one thing I crave leave of\r\nthe present licensers to be pardoned for so thinking; who doubtless took\r\nthis office up, looking on it through their obedience to the Parliament,\r\nwhose command perhaps made all things seem easy and unlaborious to\r\nthem; but that this short trial hath wearied them out already, their\r\nown expressions and excuses to them who make so many journeys to solicit\r\ntheir licence are testimony enough. Seeing therefore those who now\r\npossess the employment by all evident signs wish themselves well rid of\r\nit; and that no man of worth, none that is not a plain unthrift of his\r\nown hours, is ever likely to succeed them, except he mean to put himself\r\nto the salary of a press corrector; we may easily foresee what kind of\r\nlicensers we are to expect hereafter, either ignorant, imperious, and\r\nremiss, or basely pecuniary. This is what I had to show, wherein this\r\nOrder cannot conduce to that end whereof it bears the intention.\r\n\r\nI lastly proceed from the no good it can do, to the manifest hurt it\r\ncauses, in being first the greatest discouragement and affront that can\r\nbe offered to learning, and to learned men.\r\n\r\nIt was the complaint and lamentation of prelates, upon every least\r\nbreath of a motion to remove pluralities, and distribute more equally\r\nChurch revenues, that then all learning would be for ever dashed and\r\ndiscouraged. But as for that opinion, I never found cause to think that\r\nthe tenth part of learning stood or fell with the clergy: nor could I\r\never but hold it for a sordid and unworthy speech of any churchman\r\nwho had a competency left him. If therefore ye be loath to dishearten\r\nutterly and discontent, not the mercenary crew of false pretenders to\r\nlearning, but the free and ingenuous sort of such as evidently were born\r\nto study, and love learning for itself, not for lucre or any other end\r\nbut the service of God and of truth, and perhaps that lasting fame and\r\nperpetuity of praise which God and good men have consented shall be the\r\nreward of those whose published labours advance the good of mankind;\r\nthen know that, so far to distrust the judgment and the honesty of one\r\nwho hath but a common repute in learning, and never yet offended, as not\r\nto count him fit to print his mind without a tutor and examiner, lest\r\nhe should drop a schism, or something of corruption, is the greatest\r\ndispleasure and indignity to a free and knowing spirit that can be put\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nWhat advantage is it to be a man, over it is to be a boy at school,\r\nif we have only escaped the ferula to come under the fescue of an\r\nImprimatur; if serious and elaborate writings, as if they were no more\r\nthan the theme of a grammar-lad under his pedagogue, must not be uttered\r\nwithout the cursory eyes of a temporizing and extemporizing licenser? He\r\nwho is not trusted with his own actions, his drift not being known to\r\nbe evil, and standing to the hazard of law and penalty, has no great\r\nargument to think himself reputed in the Commonwealth wherein he was\r\nborn for other than a fool or a foreigner. When a man writes to the\r\nworld, he summons up all his reason and deliberation to assist him; he\r\nsearches, meditates, is industrious, and likely consults and confers\r\nwith his judicious friends; after all which done he takes himself to be\r\ninformed in what he writes, as well as any that writ before him. If, in\r\nthis the most consummate act of his fidelity and ripeness, no years, no\r\nindustry, no former proof of his abilities can bring him to that state\r\nof maturity, as not to be still mistrusted and suspected, unless he\r\ncarry all his considerate diligence, all his midnight watchings and\r\nexpense of Palladian oil, to the hasty view of an unleisured licenser,\r\nperhaps much his younger, perhaps his inferior in judgment, perhaps one\r\nwho never knew the labour of bookwriting, and if he be not repulsed or\r\nslighted, must appear in print like a puny with his guardian, and his\r\ncensor's hand on the back of his title to be his bail and surety that he\r\nis no idiot or seducer, it cannot be but a dishonour and derogation to\r\nthe author, to the book, to the privilege and dignity of learning.\r\n\r\nAnd what if the author shall be one so copious of fancy, as to have many\r\nthings well worth the adding come into his mind after licensing, while\r\nthe book is yet under the press, which not seldom happens to the best\r\nand diligentest writers; and that perhaps a dozen times in one book? The\r\nprinter dares not go beyond his licensed copy; so often then must the\r\nauthor trudge to his leave-giver, that those his new insertions may be\r\nviewed; and many a jaunt will be made, ere that licenser, for it must be\r\nthe same man, can either be found, or found at leisure; meanwhile either\r\nthe press must stand still, which is no small damage, or the author lose\r\nhis accuratest thoughts, and send the book forth worse than he had made\r\nit, which to a diligent writer is the greatest melancholy and vexation\r\nthat can befall.\r\n\r\nAnd how can a man teach with authority, which is the life of teaching;\r\nhow can he be a doctor in his book as he ought to be, or else had better\r\nbe silent, whenas all he teaches, all he delivers, is but under the\r\ntuition, under the correction of his patriarchal licenser to blot or\r\nalter what precisely accords not with the hidebound humour which he\r\ncalls his judgment? When every acute reader, upon the first sight of a\r\npedantic licence, will be ready with these like words to ding the book\r\na quoit's distance from him: I hate a pupil teacher, I endure not an\r\ninstructor that comes to me under the wardship of an overseeing fist. I\r\nknow nothing of the licenser, but that I have his own hand here for his\r\narrogance; who shall warrant me his judgment? The State, sir, replies\r\nthe stationer, but has a quick return: The State shall be my governors,\r\nbut not my critics; they may be mistaken in the choice of a licenser,\r\nas easily as this licenser may be mistaken in an author; this is\r\nsome common stuff; and he might add from Sir Francis Bacon, THAT\r\nSUCH AUTHORIZED BOOKS ARE BUT THE LANGUAGE OF THE TIMES. For though a\r\nlicenser should happen to be judicious more than ordinary, which will\r\nbe a great jeopardy of the next succession, yet his very office and his\r\ncommission enjoins him to let pass nothing but what is vulgarly received\r\nalready.\r\n\r\nNay, which is more lamentable, if the work of any deceased author,\r\nthough never so famous in his lifetime and even to this day, come to\r\ntheir hands for licence to be printed, or reprinted, if there be found\r\nin his book one sentence of a venturous edge, uttered in the height\r\nof zeal (and who knows whether it might not be the dictate of a divine\r\nspirit?) yet not suiting with every low decrepit humour of their own,\r\nthough it were Knox himself, the reformer of a kingdom, that spake it,\r\nthey will not pardon him their dash: the sense of that great man shall\r\nto all posterity be lost, for the fearfulness or the presumptuous\r\nrashness of a perfunctory licenser. And to what an author this violence\r\nhath been lately done, and in what book of greatest consequence to be\r\nfaithfully published, I could now instance, but shall forbear till a\r\nmore convenient season.\r\n\r\nYet if these things be not resented seriously and timely by them who\r\nhave the remedy in their power, but that such iron-moulds as these shall\r\nhave authority to gnaw out the choicest periods of exquisitest books,\r\nand to commit such a treacherous fraud against the orphan remainders of\r\nworthiest men after death, the more sorrow will belong to that hapless\r\nrace of men, whose misfortune it is to have understanding. Henceforth\r\nlet no man care to learn, or care to be more than worldly-wise; for\r\ncertainly in higher matters to be ignorant and slothful, to be a common\r\nsteadfast dunce, will be the only pleasant life, and only in request.\r\n\r\nAnd it is a particular disesteem of every knowing person alive, and most\r\ninjurious to the written labours and monuments of the dead, so to me it\r\nseems an undervaluing and vilifying of the whole nation. I cannot set\r\nso light by all the invention, the art, the wit, the grave and solid\r\njudgment which is in England, as that it can be comprehended in any\r\ntwenty capacities how good soever, much less that it should not pass\r\nexcept their superintendence be over it, except it be sifted and\r\nstrained with their strainers, that it should be uncurrent without\r\ntheir manual stamp. Truth and understanding are not such wares as to be\r\nmonopolized and traded in by tickets and statutes and standards. We must\r\nnot think to make a staple commodity of all the knowledge in the land,\r\nto mark and licence it like our broadcloth and our woolpacks. What is it\r\nbut a servitude like that imposed by the Philistines, not to be allowed\r\nthe sharpening of our own axes and coulters, but we must repair from\r\nall quarters to twenty licensing forges? Had anyone written and divulged\r\nerroneous things and scandalous to honest life, misusing and forfeiting\r\nthe esteem had of his reason among men, if after conviction this only\r\ncensure were adjudged him that he should never henceforth write but\r\nwhat were first examined by an appointed officer, whose hand should be\r\nannexed to pass his credit for him that now he might be safely read; it\r\ncould not be apprehended less than a disgraceful punishment. Whence to\r\ninclude the whole nation, and those that never yet thus offended, under\r\nsuch a diffident and suspectful prohibition, may plainly be understood\r\nwhat a disparagement it is. So much the more, whenas debtors and\r\ndelinquents may walk abroad without a keeper, but unoffensive books must\r\nnot stir forth without a visible jailer in their title.\r\n\r\nNor is it to the common people less than a reproach; for if we be\r\nso jealous over them, as that we dare not trust them with an English\r\npamphlet, what do we but censure them for a giddy, vicious, and\r\nungrounded people; in such a sick and weak state of faith and\r\ndiscretion, as to be able to take nothing down but through the pipe of a\r\nlicenser? That this is care or love of them, we cannot pretend, whenas,\r\nin those popish places where the laity are most hated and despised, the\r\nsame strictness is used over them. Wisdom we cannot call it, because\r\nit stops but one breach of licence, nor that neither: whenas those\r\ncorruptions, which it seeks to prevent, break in faster at other doors\r\nwhich cannot be shut.\r\n\r\nAnd in conclusion it reflects to the disrepute of our ministers also, of\r\nwhose labours we should hope better, and of the proficiency which their\r\nflock reaps by them, than that after all this light of the Gospel which\r\nis, and is to be, and all this continual preaching, they should still be\r\nfrequented with such an unprincipled, unedified and laic rabble, as\r\nthat the whiff of every new pamphlet should stagger them out of their\r\ncatechism and Christian walking. This may have much reason to discourage\r\nthe ministers when such a low conceit is had of all their exhortations,\r\nand the benefiting of their hearers, as that they are not thought fit\r\nto be turned loose to three sheets of paper without a licenser; that all\r\nthe sermons, all the lectures preached, printed, vented in such numbers,\r\nand such volumes, as have now well nigh made all other books unsaleable,\r\nshould not be armour enough against one single Enchiridion, without the\r\ncastle of St. Angelo of an Imprimatur.\r\n\r\nAnd lest some should persuade ye, Lords and Commons, that these\r\narguments of learned men's discouragement at this your Order are mere\r\nflourishes, and not real, I could recount what I have seen and heard in\r\nother countries, where this kind of inquisition tyrannizes; when I have\r\nsat among their learned men, for that honour I had, and been counted\r\nhappy to be born in such a place of philosophic freedom, as they\r\nsupposed England was, while themselves did nothing but bemoan the\r\nservile condition into which learning amongst them was brought; that\r\nthis was it which had damped the glory of Italian wits; that nothing had\r\nbeen there written now these many years but flattery and fustian.\r\nThere it was that I found and visited the famous Galileo, grown old, a\r\nprisoner to the Inquisition, for thinking in astronomy otherwise than\r\nthe Franciscan and Dominican licensers thought. And though I knew\r\nthat England then was groaning loudest under the prelatical yoke,\r\nnevertheless I took it as a pledge of future happiness, that other\r\nnations were so persuaded of her liberty. Yet was it beyond my hope that\r\nthose worthies were then breathing in her air, who should be her leaders\r\nto such a deliverance, as shall never be forgotten by any revolution of\r\ntime that this world hath to finish. When that was once begun, it was as\r\nlittle in my fear that what words of complaint I heard among learned men\r\nof other parts uttered against the Inquisition, the same I should hear\r\nby as learned men at home, uttered in time of Parliament against an\r\norder of licensing; and that so generally that, when I had disclosed\r\nmyself a companion of their discontent, I might say, if without envy,\r\nthat he whom an honest quaestorship had endeared to the Sicilians was\r\nnot more by them importuned against Verres, than the favourable opinion\r\nwhich I had among many who honour ye, and are known and respected by ye,\r\nloaded me with entreaties and persuasions, that I would not despair to\r\nlay together that which just reason should bring into my mind, toward\r\nthe removal of an undeserved thraldom upon learning. That this is\r\nnot therefore the disburdening of a particular fancy, but the common\r\ngrievance of all those who had prepared their minds and studies\r\nabove the vulgar pitch to advance truth in others, and from others to\r\nentertain it, thus much may satisfy.\r\n\r\nAnd in their name I shall for neither friend nor foe conceal what\r\nthe general murmur is; that if it come to inquisitioning again and\r\nlicensing, and that we are so timorous of ourselves, and so suspicious\r\nof all men, as to fear each book and the shaking of every leaf, before\r\nwe know what the contents are; if some who but of late were little\r\nbetter than silenced from preaching shall come now to silence us from\r\nreading, except what they please, it cannot be guessed what is intended\r\nby some but a second tyranny over learning: and will soon put it out of\r\ncontroversy, that bishops and presbyters are the same to us, both name\r\nand thing. That those evils of prelaty, which before from five or six\r\nand twenty sees were distributively charged upon the whole people, will\r\nnow light wholly upon learning, is not obscure to us: whenas now the\r\npastor of a small unlearned parish on the sudden shall be exalted\r\narchbishop over a large diocese of books, and yet not remove, but keep\r\nhis other cure too, a mystical pluralist. He who but of late cried down\r\nthe sole ordination of every novice Bachelor of Art, and denied sole\r\njurisdiction over the simplest parishioner, shall now at home in his\r\nprivate chair assume both these over worthiest and excellentest books\r\nand ablest authors that write them.\r\n\r\nThis is not, ye Covenants and Protestations that we have made! this is\r\nnot to put down prelaty; this is but to chop an episcopacy; this is\r\nbut to translate the Palace Metropolitan from one kind of dominion into\r\nanother; this is but an old canonical sleight of commuting our penance.\r\nTo startle thus betimes at a mere unlicensed pamphlet will after a\r\nwhile be afraid of every conventicle, and a while after will make a\r\nconventicle of every Christian meeting. But I am certain that a State\r\ngoverned by the rules of justice and fortitude, or a Church built\r\nand founded upon the rock of faith and true knowledge, cannot be so\r\npusillanimous. While things are yet not constituted in religion, that\r\nfreedom of writing should be restrained by a discipline imitated from\r\nthe prelates and learnt by them from the Inquisition, to shut us up all\r\nagain into the breast of a licenser, must needs give cause of doubt and\r\ndiscouragement to all learned and religious men.\r\n\r\nWho cannot but discern the fineness of this politic drift, and who are\r\nthe contrivers; that while bishops were to be baited down, then all\r\npresses might be open; it was the people's birthright and privilege in\r\ntime of Parliament, it was the breaking forth of light. But now, the\r\nbishops abrogated and voided out of the Church, as if our Reformation\r\nsought no more but to make room for others into their seats under\r\nanother name, the episcopal arts begin to bud again, the cruse of truth\r\nmust run no more oil, liberty of printing must be enthralled again\r\nunder a prelatical commission of twenty, the privilege of the people\r\nnullified, and, which is worse, the freedom of learning must groan\r\nagain, and to her old fetters: all this the Parliament yet sitting.\r\nAlthough their own late arguments and defences against the prelates\r\nmight remember them, that this obstructing violence meets for the most\r\npart with an event utterly opposite to the end which it drives at:\r\ninstead of suppressing sects and schisms, it raises them and invests\r\nthem with a reputation. The punishing of wits enhances their authority,\r\nsaith the Viscount St. Albans; and a forbidden writing is thought to be\r\na certain spark of truth that flies up in the faces of them who seek\r\nto tread it out. This Order, therefore, may prove a nursing-mother to\r\nsects, but I shall easily show how it will be a step-dame to Truth: and\r\nfirst by disenabling us to the maintenance of what is known already.\r\n\r\nWell knows he who uses to consider, that our faith and knowledge thrives\r\nby exercise, as well as our limbs and complexion. Truth is compared in\r\nScripture to a streaming fountain; if her waters flow not in a perpetual\r\nprogression, they sicken into a muddy pool of conformity and tradition.\r\nA man may be a heretic in the truth; and if he believe things only\r\nbecause his pastor says so, or the Assembly so determines, without\r\nknowing other reason, though his belief be true, yet the very truth he\r\nholds becomes his heresy.\r\n\r\nThere is not any burden that some would gladlier post off to another\r\nthan the charge and care of their religion. There be--who knows not that\r\nthere be?--of Protestants and professors who live and die in as arrant\r\nan implicit faith as any lay Papist of Loretto. A wealthy man, addicted\r\nto his pleasure and to his profits, finds religion to be a traffic so\r\nentangled, and of so many piddling accounts, that of all mysteries he\r\ncannot skill to keep a stock going upon that trade. What should he do?\r\nfain he would have the name to be religious, fain he would bear up with\r\nhis neighbours in that. What does he therefore, but resolves to give\r\nover toiling, and to find himself out some factor, to whose care and\r\ncredit he may commit the whole managing of his religious affairs; some\r\ndivine of note and estimation that must be. To him he adheres, resigns\r\nthe whole warehouse of his religion, with all the locks and keys, into\r\nhis custody; and indeed makes the very person of that man his religion;\r\nesteems his associating with him a sufficient evidence and commendatory\r\nof his own piety. So that a man may say his religion is now no more\r\nwithin himself, but is become a dividual movable, and goes and comes\r\nnear him, according as that good man frequents the house. He entertains\r\nhim, gives him gifts, feasts him, lodges him; his religion comes home at\r\nnight, prays, is liberally supped, and sumptuously laid to sleep; rises,\r\nis saluted, and after the malmsey, or some well-spiced brewage, and\r\nbetter breakfasted than he whose morning appetite would have gladly fed\r\non green figs between Bethany and Jerusalem, his religion walks abroad\r\nat eight, and leaves his kind entertainer in the shop trading all day\r\nwithout his religion.\r\n\r\nAnother sort there be who, when they hear that all things shall be\r\nordered, all things regulated and settled, nothing written but what\r\npasses through the custom-house of certain publicans that have the\r\ntonnaging and poundaging of all free-spoken truth, will straight give\r\nthemselves up into your hands, make 'em and cut 'em out what religion ye\r\nplease: there be delights, there be recreations and jolly pastimes that\r\nwill fetch the day about from sun to sun, and rock the tedious year\r\nas in a delightful dream. What need they torture their heads with that\r\nwhich others have taken so strictly and so unalterably into their own\r\npurveying? These are the fruits which a dull ease and cessation of our\r\nknowledge will bring forth among the people. How goodly and how to be\r\nwished were such an obedient unanimity as this, what a fine conformity\r\nwould it starch us all into! Doubtless a staunch and solid piece of\r\nframework, as any January could freeze together.\r\n\r\nNor much better will be the consequence even among the clergy\r\nthemselves. It is no new thing never heard of before, for a parochial\r\nminister, who has his reward and is at his Hercules' pillars in a warm\r\nbenefice, to be easily inclinable, if he have nothing else that may\r\nrouse up his studies, to finish his circuit in an English Concordance\r\nand a topic folio, the gatherings and savings of a sober graduateship,\r\na Harmony and a Catena; treading the constant round of certain common\r\ndoctrinal heads, attended with their uses, motives, marks, and\r\nmeans, out of which, as out of an alphabet, or sol-fa, by forming and\r\ntransforming, joining and disjoining variously, a little bookcraft, and\r\ntwo hours' meditation, might furnish him unspeakably to the performance\r\nof more than a weekly charge of sermoning: not to reckon up the infinite\r\nhelps of interlinearies, breviaries, synopses, and other loitering gear.\r\nBut as for the multitude of sermons ready printed and piled up, on every\r\ntext that is not difficult, our London trading St. Thomas in his vestry,\r\nand add to boot St. Martin and St. Hugh, have not within their hallowed\r\nlimits more vendible ware of all sorts ready made: so that penury he\r\nnever need fear of pulpit provision, having where so plenteously to\r\nrefresh his magazine. But if his rear and flanks be not impaled, if his\r\nback door be not secured by the rigid licenser, but that a bold book\r\nmay now and then issue forth and give the assault to some of his old\r\ncollections in their trenches, it will concern him then to keep waking,\r\nto stand in watch, to set good guards and sentinels about his\r\nreceived opinions, to walk the round and counter-round with his fellow\r\ninspectors, fearing lest any of his flock be seduced, who also then\r\nwould be better instructed, better exercised and disciplined. And God\r\nsend that the fear of this diligence, which must then be used, do not\r\nmake us affect the laziness of a licensing Church.\r\n\r\nFor if we be sure we are in the right, and do not hold the truth\r\nguiltily, which becomes not, if we ourselves condemn not our own weak\r\nand frivolous teaching, and the people for an untaught and irreligious\r\ngadding rout, what can be more fair than when a man judicious, learned,\r\nand of a conscience, for aught we know, as good as theirs that taught\r\nus what we know, shall not privily from house to house, which is more\r\ndangerous, but openly by writing publish to the world what his opinion\r\nis, what his reasons, and wherefore that which is now thought cannot be\r\nsound? Christ urged it as wherewith to justify himself, that he preached\r\nin public; yet writing is more public than preaching; and more easy\r\nto refutation, if need be, there being so many whose business and\r\nprofession merely it is to be the champions of truth; which if they\r\nneglect, what can be imputed but their sloth, or unability?\r\n\r\nThus much we are hindered and disinured by this course of licensing,\r\ntoward the true knowledge of what we seem to know. For how much it hurts\r\nand hinders the licensers themselves in the calling of their ministry,\r\nmore than any secular employment, if they will discharge that office as\r\nthey ought, so that of necessity they must neglect either the one duty\r\nor the other, I insist not, because it is a particular, but leave it to\r\ntheir own conscience, how they will decide it there.\r\n\r\nThere is yet behind of what I purposed to lay open, the incredible loss\r\nand detriment that this plot of licensing puts us to; more than if some\r\nenemy at sea should stop up all our havens and ports and creeks, it\r\nhinders and retards the importation of our richest merchandise, truth;\r\nnay, it was first established and put in practice by Antichristian\r\nmalice and mystery on set purpose to extinguish, if it were possible,\r\nthe light of Reformation, and to settle falsehood; little differing from\r\nthat policy wherewith the Turk upholds his Alcoran, by the prohibition\r\nof printing. 'Tis not denied, but gladly confessed, we are to send our\r\nthanks and vows to Heaven louder than most of nations, for that great\r\nmeasure of truth which we enjoy, especially in those main points between\r\nus and the Pope, with his appurtenances the prelates: but he who thinks\r\nwe are to pitch our tent here, and have attained the utmost prospect of\r\nreformation that the mortal glass wherein we contemplate can show us,\r\ntill we come to beatific vision, that man by this very opinion declares\r\nthat he is yet far short of truth.\r\n\r\nTruth indeed came once into the world with her divine Master, and was\r\na perfect shape most glorious to look on: but when he ascended, and his\r\nApostles after him were laid asleep, then straight arose a wicked race\r\nof deceivers, who, as that story goes of the Egyptian Typhon with his\r\nconspirators, how they dealt with the good Osiris, took the virgin\r\nTruth, hewed her lovely form into a thousand pieces, and scattered them\r\nto the four winds. From that time ever since, the sad friends of Truth,\r\nsuch as durst appear, imitating the careful search that Isis made for\r\nthe mangled body of Osiris, went up and down gathering up limb by limb,\r\nstill as they could find them. We have not yet found them all, Lords and\r\nCommons, nor ever shall do, till her Master's second coming; he shall\r\nbring together every joint and member, and shall mould them into\r\nan immortal feature of loveliness and perfection. Suffer not these\r\nlicensing prohibitions to stand at every place of opportunity,\r\nforbidding and disturbing them that continue seeking, that continue to\r\ndo our obsequies to the torn body of our martyred saint.\r\n\r\nWe boast our light; but if we look not wisely on the sun itself, it\r\nsmites us into darkness. Who can discern those planets that are oft\r\ncombust, and those stars of brightest magnitude that rise and set with\r\nthe sun, until the opposite motion of their orbs bring them to such a\r\nplace in the firmament, where they may be seen evening or morning? The\r\nlight which we have gained was given us, not to be ever staring on, but\r\nby it to discover onward things more remote from our knowledge. It\r\nis not the unfrocking of a priest, the unmitring of a bishop, and the\r\nremoving him from off the presbyterian shoulders, that will make us a\r\nhappy nation. No, if other things as great in the Church, and in the\r\nrule of life both economical and political, be not looked into and\r\nreformed, we have looked so long upon the blaze that Zuinglius and\r\nCalvin hath beaconed up to us, that we are stark blind. There be who\r\nperpetually complain of schisms and sects, and make it such a calamity\r\nthat any man dissents from their maxims. 'Tis their own pride and\r\nignorance which causes the disturbing, who neither will hear with\r\nmeekness, nor can convince; yet all must be suppressed which is not\r\nfound in their Syntagma. They are the troublers, they are the dividers\r\nof unity, who neglect and permit not others to unite those dissevered\r\npieces which are yet wanting to the body of Truth. To be still searching\r\nwhat we know not by what we know, still closing up truth to truth as we\r\nfind it (for all her body is homogeneal and proportional), this is the\r\ngolden rule in theology as well as in arithmetic, and makes up the\r\nbest harmony in a Church; not the forced and outward union of cold, and\r\nneutral, and inwardly divided minds.\r\n\r\nLords and Commons of England! consider what nation it is whereof ye are,\r\nand whereof ye are the governors: a nation not slow and dull, but of a\r\nquick, ingenious and piercing spirit, acute to invent, subtle and sinewy\r\nto discourse, not beneath the reach of any point the highest that human\r\ncapacity can soar to. Therefore the studies of learning in her deepest\r\nsciences have been so ancient and so eminent among us, that writers of\r\ngood antiquity and ablest judgment have been persuaded that even the\r\nschool of Pythagoras and the Persian wisdom took beginning from the\r\nold philosophy of this island. And that wise and civil Roman, Julius\r\nAgricola, who governed once here for Caesar, preferred the natural wits\r\nof Britain before the laboured studies of the French. Nor is it for\r\nnothing that the grave and frugal Transylvanian sends out yearly from\r\nas far as the mountainous borders of Russia, and beyond the Hercynian\r\nwilderness, not their youth, but their staid men, to learn our language\r\nand our theologic arts.\r\n\r\nYet that which is above all this, the favour and the love of Heaven,\r\nwe have great argument to think in a peculiar manner propitious and\r\npropending towards us. Why else was this nation chosen before any other,\r\nthat out of her, as out of Sion, should be proclaimed and sounded forth\r\nthe first tidings and trumpet of Reformation to all Europe? And had it\r\nnot been the obstinate perverseness of our prelates against the divine\r\nand admirable spirit of Wickliff, to suppress him as a schismatic and\r\ninnovator, perhaps neither the Bohemian Huns and Jerome, no nor the name\r\nof Luther or of Calvin, had been ever known: the glory of reforming all\r\nour neighbours had been completely ours. But now, as our obdurate clergy\r\nhave with violence demeaned the matter, we are become hitherto the\r\nlatest and the backwardest scholars, of whom God offered to have made\r\nus the teachers. Now once again by all concurrence of signs, and by\r\nthe general instinct of holy and devout men, as they daily and solemnly\r\nexpress their thoughts, God is decreeing to begin some new and great\r\nperiod in his Church, even to the reforming of Reformation itself: what\r\ndoes he then but reveal himself to his servants, and as his manner is,\r\nfirst to his Englishmen? I say, as his manner is, first to us, though we\r\nmark not the method of his counsels, and are unworthy.\r\n\r\nBehold now this vast city: a city of refuge, the mansion house of\r\nliberty, encompassed and surrounded with his protection; the shop of war\r\nhath not there more anvils and hammers waking, to fashion out the plates\r\nand instruments of armed justice in defence of beleaguered truth, than\r\nthere be pens and heads there, sitting by their studious lamps, musing,\r\nsearching, revolving new notions and ideas wherewith to present, as with\r\ntheir homage and their fealty, the approaching Reformation: others as\r\nfast reading, trying all things, assenting to the force of reason and\r\nconvincement. What could a man require more from a nation so pliant and\r\nso prone to seek after knowledge? What wants there to such a towardly\r\nand pregnant soil, but wise and faithful labourers, to make a knowing\r\npeople, a nation of prophets, of sages, and of worthies? We reckon more\r\nthan five months yet to harvest; there need not be five weeks; had we\r\nbut eyes to lift up, the fields are white already.\r\n\r\nWhere there is much desire to learn, there of necessity will be much\r\narguing, much writing, many opinions; for opinion in good men is but\r\nknowledge in the making. Under these fantastic terrors of sect and\r\nschism, we wrong the earnest and zealous thirst after knowledge and\r\nunderstanding which God hath stirred up in this city. What some lament\r\nof, we rather should rejoice at, should rather praise this pious\r\nforwardness among men, to reassume the ill-deputed care of their\r\nreligion into their own hands again. A little generous prudence, a\r\nlittle forbearance of one another, and some grain of charity might win\r\nall these diligences to join, and unite in one general and brotherly\r\nsearch after truth; could we but forgo this prelatical tradition of\r\ncrowding free consciences and Christian liberties into canons and\r\nprecepts of men. I doubt not, if some great and worthy stranger should\r\ncome among us, wise to discern the mould and temper of a people, and how\r\nto govern it, observing the high hopes and aims, the diligent alacrity\r\nof our extended thoughts and reasonings in the pursuance of truth and\r\nfreedom, but that he would cry out as Pyrrhus did, admiring the Roman\r\ndocility and courage: If such were my Epirots, I would not despair the\r\ngreatest design that could be attempted, to make a Church or kingdom\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nYet these are the men cried out against for schismatics and sectaries;\r\nas if, while the temple of the Lord was building, some cutting, some\r\nsquaring the marble, others hewing the cedars, there should be a sort\r\nof irrational men who could not consider there must be many schisms and\r\nmany dissections made in the quarry and in the timber, ere the house\r\nof God can be built. And when every stone is laid artfully together,\r\nit cannot be united into a continuity, it can but be contiguous in\r\nthis world; neither can every piece of the building be of one form;\r\nnay rather the perfection consists in this, that, out of many\r\nmoderate varieties and brotherly dissimilitudes that are not vastly\r\ndisproportional, arises the goodly and the graceful symmetry that\r\ncommends the whole pile and structure.\r\n\r\nLet us therefore be more considerate builders, more wise in spiritual\r\narchitecture, when great reformation is expected. For now the time seems\r\ncome, wherein Moses the great prophet may sit in heaven rejoicing to\r\nsee that memorable and glorious wish of his fulfilled, when not only\r\nour seventy elders, but all the Lord's people, are become prophets. No\r\nmarvel then though some men, and some good men too perhaps, but young in\r\ngoodness, as Joshua then was, envy them. They fret, and out of their own\r\nweakness are in agony, lest these divisions and subdivisions will undo\r\nus. The adversary again applauds, and waits the hour: when they have\r\nbranched themselves out, saith he, small enough into parties and\r\npartitions, then will be our time. Fool! he sees not the firm root, out\r\nof which we all grow, though into branches: nor will beware until he\r\nsee our small divided maniples cutting through at every angle of his\r\nill-united and unwieldy brigade. And that we are to hope better of\r\nall these supposed sects and schisms, and that we shall not need that\r\nsolicitude, honest perhaps, though over-timorous, of them that vex in\r\nthis behalf, but shall laugh in the end at those malicious applauders of\r\nour differences, I have these reasons to persuade me.\r\n\r\nFirst, when a city shall be as it were besieged and blocked about, her\r\nnavigable river infested, inroads and incursions round, defiance and\r\nbattle oft rumoured to be marching up even to her walls and suburb\r\ntrenches, that then the people, or the greater part, more than at other\r\ntimes, wholly taken up with the study of highest and most important\r\nmatters to be reformed, should be disputing, reasoning, reading,\r\ninventing, discoursing, even to a rarity and admiration, things not\r\nbefore discoursed or written of, argues first a singular goodwill,\r\ncontentedness and confidence in your prudent foresight and safe\r\ngovernment, Lords and Commons; and from thence derives itself to a\r\ngallant bravery and well-grounded contempt of their enemies, as if there\r\nwere no small number of as great spirits among us, as his was, who when\r\nRome was nigh besieged by Hannibal, being in the city, bought that piece\r\nof ground at no cheap rate, whereon Hannibal himself encamped his own\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\nNext, it is a lively and cheerful presage of our happy success and\r\nvictory. For as in a body, when the blood is fresh, the spirits pure and\r\nvigorous, not only to vital but to rational faculties, and those in the\r\nacutest and the pertest operations of wit and subtlety, it argues in\r\nwhat good plight and constitution the body is; so when the cheerfulness\r\nof the people is so sprightly up, as that it has not only wherewith to\r\nguard well its own freedom and safety, but to spare, and to bestow upon\r\nthe solidest and sublimest points of controversy and new invention, it\r\nbetokens us not degenerated, nor drooping to a fatal decay, but casting\r\noff the old and wrinkled skin of corruption to outlive these pangs and\r\nwax young again, entering the glorious ways of truth and prosperous\r\nvirtue, destined to become great and honourable in these latter ages.\r\nMethinks I see in my mind a noble and puissant nation rousing herself\r\nlike a strong man after sleep, and shaking her invincible locks:\r\nmethinks I see her as an eagle mewing her mighty youth, and kindling\r\nher undazzled eyes at the full midday beam; purging and unscaling her\r\nlong-abused sight at the fountain itself of heavenly radiance; while the\r\nwhole noise of timorous and flocking birds, with those also that love\r\nthe twilight, flutter about, amazed at what she means, and in their\r\nenvious gabble would prognosticate a year of sects and schisms.\r\n\r\nWhat would ye do then? should ye suppress all this flowery crop of\r\nknowledge and new light sprung up and yet springing daily in this city?\r\nShould ye set an oligarchy of twenty engrossers over it, to bring a\r\nfamine upon our minds again, when we shall know nothing but what is\r\nmeasured to us by their bushel? Believe it, Lords and Commons, they\r\nwho counsel ye to such a suppressing do as good as bid ye suppress\r\nyourselves; and I will soon show how. If it be desired to know the\r\nimmediate cause of all this free writing and free speaking, there cannot\r\nbe assigned a truer than your own mild and free and humane government.\r\nIt is the liberty, Lords and Commons, which your own valorous and happy\r\ncounsels have purchased us, liberty which is the nurse of all great\r\nwits; this is that which hath rarefied and enlightened our spirits like\r\nthe influence of heaven; this is that which hath enfranchised, enlarged\r\nand lifted up our apprehensions, degrees above themselves.\r\n\r\nYe cannot make us now less capable, less knowing, less eagerly pursuing\r\nof the truth, unless ye first make yourselves, that made us so, less\r\nthe lovers, less the founders of our true liberty. We can grow ignorant\r\nagain, brutish, formal and slavish, as ye found us; but you then\r\nmust first become that which ye cannot be, oppressive, arbitrary and\r\ntyrannous, as they were from whom ye have freed us. That our hearts\r\nare now more capacious, our thoughts more erected to the search and\r\nexpectation of greatest and exactest things, is the issue of your own\r\nvirtue propagated in us; ye cannot suppress that, unless ye reinforce an\r\nabrogated and merciless law, that fathers may dispatch at will their own\r\nchildren. And who shall then stick closest to ye, and excite others?\r\nnot he who takes up arms for coat and conduct, and his four nobles of\r\nDanegelt. Although I dispraise not the defence of just immunities, yet\r\nlove my peace better, if that were all. Give me the liberty to know, to\r\nutter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties.\r\n\r\nWhat would be best advised, then, if it be found so hurtful and so\r\nunequal to suppress opinions for the newness or the unsuitableness to\r\na customary acceptance, will not be my task to say. I only shall repeat\r\nwhat I have learned from one of your own honourable number, a right\r\nnoble and pious lord, who, had he not sacrificed his life and fortunes\r\nto the Church and Commonwealth, we had not now missed and bewailed a\r\nworthy and undoubted patron of this argument. Ye know him, I am sure;\r\nyet I for honour's sake, and may it be eternal to him, shall name him,\r\nthe Lord Brook. He writing of episcopacy, and by the way treating of\r\nsects and schisms, left ye his vote, or rather now the last words of his\r\ndying charge, which I know will ever be of dear and honoured regard with\r\nye, so full of meekness and breathing charity, that next to his last\r\ntestament, who bequeathed love and peace to his disciples, I cannot\r\ncall to mind where I have read or heard words more mild and peaceful. He\r\nthere exhorts us to hear with patience and humility those, however\r\nthey be miscalled, that desire to live purely, in such a use of God's\r\nordinances, as the best guidance of their conscience gives them, and\r\nto tolerate them, though in some disconformity to ourselves. The book\r\nitself will tell us more at large, being published to the world, and\r\ndedicated to the Parliament by him who, both for his life and for his\r\ndeath, deserves that what advice he left be not laid by without perusal.\r\n\r\nAnd now the time in special is, by privilege to write and speak what may\r\nhelp to the further discussing of matters in agitation. The temple of\r\nJanus with his two controversial faces might now not unsignificantly be\r\nset open. And though all the winds of doctrine were let loose to\r\nplay upon the earth, so Truth be in the field, we do injuriously,\r\nby licensing and prohibiting, to misdoubt her strength. Let her and\r\nFalsehood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the worse, in a free and\r\nopen encounter? Her confuting is the best and surest suppressing. He who\r\nhears what praying there is for light and clearer knowledge to be sent\r\ndown among us, would think of other matters to be constituted beyond\r\nthe discipline of Geneva, framed and fabricked already to our hands. Yet\r\nwhen the new light which we beg for shines in upon us, there be who envy\r\nand oppose, if it come not first in at their casements. What a collusion\r\nis this, whenas we are exhorted by the wise man to use diligence, to\r\nseek for wisdom as for hidden treasures early and late, that another\r\norder shall enjoin us to know nothing but by statute? When a man hath\r\nbeen labouring the hardest labour in the deep mines of knowledge,\r\nhath furnished out his findings in all their equipage: drawn forth\r\nhis reasons as it were a battle ranged: scattered and defeated all\r\nobjections in his way; calls out his adversary into the plain, offers\r\nhim the advantage of wind and sun, if he please, only that he may try\r\nthe matter by dint of argument: for his opponents then to skulk, to lay\r\nambushments, to keep a narrow bridge of licensing where the challenger\r\nshould pass, though it be valour enough in soldiership, is but weakness\r\nand cowardice in the wars of Truth.\r\n\r\nFor who knows not that Truth is strong, next to the Almighty? She needs\r\nno policies, nor stratagems, nor licensings to make her victorious;\r\nthose are the shifts and the defences that error uses against her power.\r\nGive her but room, and do not bind her when she sleeps, for then she\r\nspeaks not true, as the old Proteus did, who spake oracles only when he\r\nwas caught and bound, but then rather she turns herself into all shapes,\r\nexcept her own, and perhaps tunes her voice according to the time, as\r\nMicaiah did before Ahab, until she be adjured into her own likeness. Yet\r\nis it not impossible that she may have more shapes than one. What else\r\nis all that rank of things indifferent, wherein Truth may be on this\r\nside or on the other, without being unlike herself? What but a vain\r\nshadow else is the abolition of those ordinances, that hand-writing\r\nnailed to the cross? What great purchase is this Christian liberty which\r\nPaul so often boasts of? His doctrine is, that he who eats or eats not,\r\nregards a day or regards it not, may do either to the Lord. How many\r\nother things might be tolerated in peace, and left to conscience, had we\r\nbut charity, and were it not the chief stronghold of our hypocrisy to be\r\never judging one another?\r\n\r\nI fear yet this iron yoke of outward conformity hath left a slavish\r\nprint upon our necks; the ghost of a linen decency yet haunts us.\r\nWe stumble and are impatient at the least dividing of one visible\r\ncongregation from another, though it be not in fundamentals; and\r\nthrough our forwardness to suppress, and our backwardness to recover\r\nany enthralled piece of truth out of the gripe of custom, we care not to\r\nkeep truth separated from truth, which is the fiercest rent and disunion\r\nof all. We do not see that, while we still affect by all means a rigid\r\nexternal formality, we may as soon fall again into a gross conforming\r\nstupidity, a stark and dead congealment of wood and hay and stubble,\r\nforced and frozen together, which is more to the sudden degenerating of\r\na Church than many subdichotomies of petty schisms.\r\n\r\nNot that I can think well of every light separation, or that all in a\r\nChurch is to be expected gold and silver and precious stones: it is not\r\npossible for man to sever the wheat from the tares, the good fish from\r\nthe other fry; that must be the Angels' ministry at the end of mortal\r\nthings. Yet if all cannot be of one mind--as who looks they should\r\nbe?--this doubtless is more wholesome, more prudent, and more Christian,\r\nthat many be tolerated, rather than all compelled. I mean not tolerated\r\npopery, and open superstition, which, as it extirpates all religions and\r\ncivil supremacies, so itself should be extirpate, provided first that\r\nall charitable and compassionate means be used to win and regain the\r\nweak and the misled: that also which is impious or evil absolutely\r\neither against faith or manners no law can possibly permit, that intends\r\nnot to unlaw itself: but those neighbouring differences, or rather\r\nindifferences, are what I speak of, whether in some point of doctrine\r\nor of discipline, which, though they may be many, yet need not interrupt\r\nTHE UNITY OF SPIRIT, if we could but find among us THE BOND OF PEACE.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile if any one would write, and bring his helpful hand to\r\nthe slow-moving Reformation which we labour under, if Truth have spoken\r\nto him before others, or but seemed at least to speak, who hath so\r\nbejesuited us that we should trouble that man with asking license to do\r\nso worthy a deed? and not consider this, that if it come to prohibiting,\r\nthere is not aught more likely to be prohibited than truth itself; whose\r\nfirst appearance to our eyes, bleared and dimmed with prejudice and\r\ncustom, is more unsightly and unplausible than many errors, even as the\r\nperson is of many a great man slight and contemptuous to see to. And\r\nwhat do they tell us vainly of new opinions, when this very opinion of\r\ntheirs, that none must be heard but whom they like, is the worst and\r\nnewest opinion of all others; and is the chief cause why sects and\r\nschisms do so much abound, and true knowledge is kept at distance from\r\nus; besides yet a greater danger which is in it.\r\n\r\nFor when God shakes a kingdom with strong and healthful commotions to\r\na general reforming, 'tis not untrue that many sectaries and false\r\nteachers are then busiest in seducing; but yet more true it is, that God\r\nthen raises to his own work men of rare abilities, and more than\r\ncommon industry, not only to look back and revise what hath been taught\r\nheretofore, but to gain further and go on some new enlightened steps in\r\nthe discovery of truth. For such is the order of God's enlightening his\r\nChurch, to dispense and deal out by degrees his beam, so as our earthly\r\neyes may best sustain it.\r\n\r\nNeither is God appointed and confined, where and out of what place these\r\nhis chosen shall be first heard to speak; for he sees not as man sees,\r\nchooses not as man chooses, lest we should devote ourselves again to set\r\nplaces, and assemblies, and outward callings of men; planting our faith\r\none while in the old Convocation house, and another while in the Chapel\r\nat Westminster; when all the faith and religion that shall be there\r\ncanonized is not sufficient without plain convincement, and the charity\r\nof patient instruction to supple the least bruise of conscience, to\r\nedify the meanest Christian, who desires to walk in the Spirit, and not\r\nin the letter of human trust, for all the number of voices that can be\r\nthere made; no, though Harry VII himself there, with all his liege tombs\r\nabout him, should lend them voices from the dead, to swell their number.\r\n\r\nAnd if the men be erroneous who appear to be the leading schismatics,\r\nwhat withholds us but our sloth, our self-will, and distrust in the\r\nright cause, that we do not give them gentle meetings and gentle\r\ndismissions, that we debate not and examine the matter thoroughly with\r\nliberal and frequent audience; if not for their sakes, yet for our own?\r\nseeing no man who hath tasted learning, but will confess the many ways\r\nof profiting by those who, not contented with stale receipts, are able\r\nto manage and set forth new positions to the world. And were they but as\r\nthe dust and cinders of our feet, so long as in that notion they may yet\r\nserve to polish and brighten the armoury of Truth, even for that respect\r\nthey were not utterly to be cast away. But if they be of those whom God\r\nhath fitted for the special use of these times with eminent and ample\r\ngifts, and those perhaps neither among the priests nor among the\r\nPharisees, and we in the haste of a precipitant zeal shall make no\r\ndistinction, but resolve to stop their mouths, because we fear they come\r\nwith new and dangerous opinions, as we commonly forejudge them ere we\r\nunderstand them; no less than woe to us, while, thinking thus to defend\r\nthe Gospel, we are found the persecutors.\r\n\r\nThere have been not a few since the beginning of this Parliament, both\r\nof the presbytery and others, who by their unlicensed books, to the\r\ncontempt of an Imprimatur, first broke that triple ice clung about our\r\nhearts, and taught the people to see day: I hope that none of those were\r\nthe persuaders to renew upon us this bondage which they themselves have\r\nwrought so much good by contemning. But if neither the check that Moses\r\ngave to young Joshua, nor the countermand which our Saviour gave\r\nto young John, who was so ready to prohibit those whom he thought\r\nunlicensed, be not enough to admonish our elders how unacceptable to\r\nGod their testy mood of prohibiting is; if neither their own remembrance\r\nwhat evil hath abounded in the Church by this set of licensing, and what\r\ngood they themselves have begun by transgressing it, be not enough,\r\nbut that they will persuade and execute the most Dominican part of the\r\nInquisition over us, and are already with one foot in the stirrup so\r\nactive at suppressing, it would be no unequal distribution in the first\r\nplace to suppress the suppressors themselves: whom the change of their\r\ncondition hath puffed up, more than their late experience of harder\r\ntimes hath made wise.\r\n\r\nAnd as for regulating the press, let no man think to have the honour\r\nof advising ye better than yourselves have done in that Order published\r\nnext before this, \"that no book be printed, unless the printer's and the\r\nauthor's name, or at least the printer's, be registered.\" Those which\r\notherwise come forth, if they be found mischievous and libellous, the\r\nfire and the executioner will be the timeliest and the most effectual\r\nremedy that man's prevention can use. For this authentic Spanish policy\r\nof licensing books, if I have said aught, will prove the most unlicensed\r\nbook itself within a short while; and was the immediate image of a Star\r\nChamber decree to that purpose made in those very times when that Court\r\ndid the rest of those her pious works, for which she is now fallen\r\nfrom the stars with Lucifer. Whereby ye may guess what kind of state\r\nprudence, what love of the people, what care of religion or good\r\nmanners there was at the contriving, although with singular hypocrisy\r\nit pretended to bind books to their good behaviour. And how it got the\r\nupper hand of your precedent Order so well constituted before, if we may\r\nbelieve those men whose profession gives them cause to inquire most,\r\nit may be doubted there was in it the fraud of some old patentees and\r\nmonopolizers in the trade of bookselling; who under pretence of the poor\r\nin their Company not to be defrauded, and the just retaining of each man\r\nhis several copy, which God forbid should be gainsaid, brought divers\r\nglossing colours to the House, which were indeed but colours, and\r\nserving to no end except it be to exercise a superiority over their\r\nneighbours; men who do not therefore labour in an honest profession\r\nto which learning is indebted, that they should be made other men's\r\nvassals. Another end is thought was aimed at by some of them in\r\nprocuring by petition this Order, that, having power in their hands,\r\nmalignant books might the easier scape abroad, as the event shows.\r\n\r\nBut of these sophisms and elenchs of merchandise I skill not. This I\r\nknow, that errors in a good government and in a bad are equally almost\r\nincident; for what magistrate may not be misinformed, and much the\r\nsooner, if liberty of printing be reduced into the power of a few? But\r\nto redress willingly and speedily what hath been erred, and in highest\r\nauthority to esteem a plain advertisement more than others have done a\r\nsumptuous bride, is a virtue (honoured Lords and Commons) answerable to\r\nyour highest actions, and whereof none can participate but greatest and\r\nwisest men.",
