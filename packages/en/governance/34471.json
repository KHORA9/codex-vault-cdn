LAWRENCE LOWELL.\r\n\r\n Set up and electrotyped. Published May, 1908. Reprinted June, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Norwood Press\r\n                J. S. Cushing Co.--Berwick & Smith Co.\r\n                        Norwood, Mass., U.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasured by the standards of duration, absence of violent commotions,\r\nmaintenance of law and order, general prosperity and contentment of the\r\npeople, and by the extent of its influence on the institutions and\r\npolitical thought of other lands, the English government has been one of\r\nthe most remarkable the world has ever known. An attempt, therefore, to\r\nstudy it at any salient epoch cannot be valueless; and the present is a\r\nsalient epoch, for the nation has now enjoyed something very near to\r\nmanhood suffrage in the boroughs for forty years, and throughout the\r\ncountry more than twenty years, a period long enough for democracy to\r\nproduce its primary if not its ultimate effects. Moreover, England has\r\none of the most interesting of popular governments, because it has had a\r\nfree development, little hampered by rigid constitutional devices. It is\r\nan organism constantly adapting itself to its environment, and hence in\r\nfull harmony with national conditions. An endeavour has been made in\r\nthese volumes to portray the present form of that organism and the\r\nforces which maintain its equilibrium.\r\n\r\nIn preparing a study of this kind one feels the need of limiting its\r\nscope, by reducing the denominator as Arthur Helps remarked. Hence the\r\nwork covers only the English government as it stands to-day; and\r\nfurther, only those institutions, national and local, that have a\r\ngeneral bearing. The British Constitution is full of exceptions, of\r\nlocal customs and special acts with which town clerks must be familiar.\r\nThey fill the path of these men with pitfalls, but they do not affect\r\nseriously the general principles of the government, and no attempt is\r\nmade to describe them here. Even the institutions of Scotland and\r\nIreland, interesting as they are in themselves, have been referred to\r\nonly so far as they relate to the national government or throw light\r\nupon its working.\r\n\r\nEven so limited, the subject is not without difficulties. The forces to\r\nbe studied do not lie upon the surface, and some of them are not\r\ndescribed in any document or found in any treatise. They can be learned\r\nonly from men connected with the machinery of public life. A student\r\nmust, therefore, rely largely upon conversations which he can use but\r\ncannot cite as authorities, and the soundness of his conclusions must be\r\nmeasured less by his references in footnotes than by the judgment of the\r\nsmall portion of the public that knows at first-hand the things whereof\r\nhe speaks. The precise effect of the various forces at work must be a\r\nmatter of opinion on which well-informed people may differ, and the\r\nwriter has drawn the picture as it appeared to him.\r\n\r\nTo undertake a study of this kind would be impossible without manifold\r\nassistance from others; and the writer is glad of this chance to express\r\nhis sense of obligation to the many persons who have given him help and\r\ninformation, men in public life belonging to different parties,\r\npermanent officials, national and local, officers of political\r\nassociations, jurists, publicists and many others. It is pleasant for\r\nhim to recall the constant courtesy with which he was treated, not\r\ninfrequently, in the case of local officers, without any introduction or\r\nclaim of any kind. Among many men to whom he owes much he desires to\r\nacknowledge his debt to Rt. Hon. Joseph Chamberlain, Lord Fitzmaurice,\r\nRt. Hon. John Morley, the late Sir William Harcourt, Lord Reay, Mr.\r\nFrederic Harrison, Sir William James Farrer, Sir Alexander Hargreaves\r\nBrown, Sir Frederick Pollock, Sir C. P. Lucas, Sir Horace Plunkett, Mr.\r\nSidney Webb, Mr. Graham Wallas, Dr. William Cunningham, Mr. Francis W.\r\nHirst, the late Capt. R. W. E. Middleton, Mr. A. E. Southall of the\r\nNational Union of Conservative Associations and Mr. Charles Geake of\r\nthe Liberal Publication Department.\r\n\r\nHis thanks are especially due to Professor A. V. Dicey, Sir Courtenay\r\nIlbert, Professor H. Morse Stephens, now of the University of\r\nCalifornia, and Professor W. B. Munro of Harvard University, who,\r\nbesides giving him information, have kindly read a part of the\r\nmanuscript or proof sheets and made many valuable suggestions. Above all\r\nhe feels the deepest gratitude to Rt. Hon. James Bryce, now happily\r\nBritish ambassador to the United States, the master and guide of all\r\nstudents of modern political systems, whose unwearied assistance,\r\ncounsel and encouragement have been a constant help throughout the\r\npreparation of this work, and who has read the whole of the proof sheets\r\nexcept the chapters that deal with the Empire. These friends have made\r\nthe writing of the book possible, and saved the author from many\r\nblunders. It is needless to say that none of them are in any way\r\nresponsible for any opinions in these pages; and in fact the writer has\r\ntried not to express, and so far as possible not to form, opinions on\r\nmatters of current party politics.\r\n\r\nThe writer is indebted also to a number of his students at Harvard, who\r\nhave made researches in several different subjects. While some of the\r\nmore important of these contributions have been referred to in the\r\nnotes, it has been impossible to do this in all cases. Finally he\r\ndesires to acknowledge the help he has received in his investigations\r\nfrom three assistants: Mr. Emerson David Fite, now of Yale University,\r\nMr. Robert Lee Hale, now of the Harvard Law School, and Mr. Thomas N.\r\nHoover of the Harvard Graduate School, the last of these having also\r\nverified the citations and prepared the index.\r\n\r\nAPRIL, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF

541\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE ON THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Different Meanings of the word Constitution.]\r\n\r\nDe Tocqueville declared that the English Constitution did not really\r\nexist,[1:1] and he said so because in his mind the word \"constitution\"\r\nmeant a perfectly definite thing to which nothing in England conformed.\r\nAn examination of modern governments shows, however, that the thing is\r\nby no means so definite as he had supposed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Document Embodying the Chief Institutions.]\r\n\r\nThe term \"constitution\" is usually applied to an attempt to embody in a\r\nsingle authoritative document, or a small group of documents, the\r\nfundamental political institutions of a state. But such an attempt is\r\nrarely, if ever, completely successful; and even if the constitution\r\nwhen framed covers all the main principles on which the government is\r\nbased, it often happens that they become modified in practice, or that\r\nother principles arise, so that the constitution no longer corresponds\r\nfully with the actual government of the country. In France, for example,\r\nthe principle that the cabinet can stay in office only so long as it\r\nretains the confidence of the popular chamber, the principle, in short,\r\nof a ministry responsible in the parliamentary sense, was not mentioned\r\nin the charters of 1814 or 1830, and yet it was certainly firmly\r\nestablished in the reign of Louis Philippe; and it is noteworthy that\r\nthis same principle, on which the whole political system of the English\r\nself-governing colonies is based, appears neither in the British North\r\nAmerican Act nor in the Australian Federation Act. The first of those\r\nstatutes, following the English tradition, speaks of the Privy Council\r\nfor Canada,[1:2] but never of the cabinet or the ministers; while the\r\nAustralian Act, going a step farther, refers to the Queen's Ministers of\r\nState,[1:3] but ignores their responsibility to the parliament.[2:1]\r\nAgain, in the United States, the provision that the electoral college\r\nshall choose the President has become so modified in practice that the\r\nelectors must vote for the candidate nominated by the party to which\r\nthey owe their own election. In choosing the President they have become,\r\nby the force of custom, as much a mere piece of mechanism as the Crown\r\nin England when giving its assent to acts passed by the two Houses of\r\nParliament. Their freedom of choice is as obsolete as the royal veto. So\r\nfar, therefore, as this meaning of the term is concerned, the\r\nconstitution of England differs from those of other countries rather in\r\ndegree than in kind. It differs in the fact that the documents, being\r\nmany statutes, are very numerous, and the part played by custom is\r\nunusually large.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Not Changeable by Ordinary Legislation.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rigid and Flexible Constitutions.]\r\n\r\nDe Tocqueville had more particularly in mind another meaning which is\r\ncommonly attached to the term \"constitution.\" It is that of an\r\ninstrument of special sanctity, distinct in character from all other\r\nlaws; and alterable only by a peculiar process, differing to a greater\r\nor less extent from the ordinary forms of legislation. The special\r\nsanctity is, of course, a matter of sentiment incapable of exact\r\ndefinition, and it may be said to belong to the British Constitution\r\nquite as much as to some others. The peculiar process of amendment, on\r\nthe other hand,--the separation of the so-called constituent and\r\nlaw-making powers,--upon which Mr. Bryce bases his division of\r\nconstitutions into rigid and flexible,[2:2] has had a long history and\r\nbeen much discussed; but although the contrast between the two types is\r\nhighly important, the creation of intermediate forms has made it less\r\nexact as a basis of classification. The later constitutions, and the\r\nmore recent practice, have tended to obscure the distinction. A\r\nseparation between the constituent and law-making powers does not, in\r\nfact, always exist in written constitutions. The Italian _Statuto_, for\r\ninstance, which contains no provision for amendment, can be, and in fact\r\nhas been, altered by the ordinary process of legislation;[3:1] and the\r\nsame thing was true of the French Charter of 1830.[3:2] The last Spanish\r\nconstitution omits all provision for amendment, but one may assume that\r\nif it lasts long enough to require amendment the changes will be made by\r\nordinary legislative process.\r\n\r\nFrom countries which can change their fundamental constitution by the\r\nordinary process of legislation we pass by almost imperceptible degrees\r\nto those where the constitutional and law-making powers are in\r\nsubstantially different hands. Thus the procedure for changing the\r\nconstitution in Prussia differs from that for the enactment of laws only\r\nby the requirement of two readings at an interval of twenty-one days.\r\nHere there is a difference legally perceptible between the methods of\r\nchanging the constitution and other laws; but it may be remarked that a\r\nprovision in the constitution to the effect that all laws should require\r\ntwo readings at an interval of twenty-one days, would not essentially\r\nchange the nature of the constitution, and yet in theory it would make\r\nthat constitution flexible instead of rigid. As it is, the fundamental\r\nlaws are quite as much under the control of the legislature in Prussia\r\nas they are in England.[3:3] This is almost equally true of France; for\r\nalthough the changes in her constitution are made by the National\r\nAssembly, composed of the two chambers sitting together, yet the\r\nAssembly can meet only after the two chambers have passed a concurrent\r\nresolution to that effect; and in fact the chambers are in the habit of\r\ndetermining beforehand by separate votes the amendments which shall be\r\nsubmitted to the Assembly. So that in France, also, the constitution is\r\nvirtually under the unrestricted control of the legislature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Distinction has Lost Practical Importance.]\r\n\r\nThe separation of constituent and law-making powers has been rendered of\r\nmuch less practical importance in some countries not only by making the\r\nprocess of amending the constitution more simple, but also by making the\r\nenactment of laws more complex. In Switzerland, for example, changes in\r\nthe Constitution of 1848 required a popular vote, while changes in the\r\nlaws did not; but after the referendum on ordinary laws was introduced\r\nin 1874, this distinction largely disappeared, and at the present day\r\nthe differences between the methods of passing constitutional amendments\r\nand ordinary laws are comparatively slight. In the case of ordinary laws\r\na popular vote is taken only on the petition of thirty thousand citizens\r\nor eight cantons, and the popular majority is decisive; whereas\r\nconstitutional amendments must be submitted to the people whether a\r\npetition is presented or not, and for their ratification a majority vote\r\nin more than half the cantons as well as a majority in the Confederation\r\nas a whole is required.[4:1]\r\n\r\nIn those European countries where the difference in the procedure for\r\nchanging constitutional and other laws is the most marked, the special\r\nformalities for the former consist in requiring more than a majority\r\nvote in the legislature, or that a general election shall take place\r\nbefore the amendment is finally adopted, or both. Now the last of those\r\nconditions is practically not unknown in England. There is a growing\r\nfeeling that no fundamental or far-reaching change ought to be made\r\nunless, as a result of a general election fought on that issue,\r\nParliament has received from the nation a mandate to make the change.\r\nSuch a doctrine does not affect the law, but it does affect that body\r\nof customs which is a not less vital part of the British Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe classical distinction between constituent and law-making powers, and\r\nhence between rigid and flexible constitutions, has also been somewhat\r\neffaced by extending the requirement of a special procedure to the\r\nenactment of certain classes of ordinary law. Thus in the German Empire\r\nthe only peculiar formality for amendments to the constitution is found\r\nin the provision that they are defeated by fourteen adverse votes in the\r\nBundesrath.[5:1] This gives Prussia with her seventeen votes a veto upon\r\nthem, but she has also a veto in the Bundesrath upon any measures\r\naffecting the army, the navy, customs-duties or excises.[5:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Growing Variety in Written Constitutions.]\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the last century written constitutions in Europe were\r\nframed for the most part upon the same model and were much alike, so\r\nthat a written constitution usually implied a definite type of limited\r\nmonarchy, where the same class of matters were removed from the direct\r\ncontrol of the legislature and placed, in theory at least, under special\r\nprotection. But now written constitutions all over the world have come\r\nto differ a great deal, some of them being simpler, and others more\r\ncomprehensive than of old. The constitutional laws of France, for\r\nexample, provide only for the bare organisation of the public\r\nauthorities, and can be amended virtually at will by the legislature;\r\nwhile the constitutions of Switzerland, Germany and the United States go\r\ninto great detail, and that of the United States can be amended only\r\nwith the greatest difficulty. The result is that the French\r\nconstitution, although written and technically rigid, bears from the\r\npoint of view of rigidity a far closer resemblance to the constitution\r\nof England than to that of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, therefore, that the distinction between constitutions\r\nwhich are flexible and those which are rigid, while valuable, has ceased\r\nto mark a contrast between widely separated groups; and that it might be\r\nwell to regard the distinction as one of degree rather than of kind.\r\nFrom this aspect it may be said that of late years constitutions have\r\ntended on the whole to become more flexible; and at the same time there\r\nhas been a tendency toward greater variations in flexibility, the\r\nconstitutions of England and of Hungary standing at one end of the\r\nscale, and that of the United States at the other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Constitution as a Supreme Law.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meaning of Law where the Common Law Prevails.]\r\n\r\nIf the term \"constitution\" does not necessarily imply that the so-called\r\nconstituent and law-making powers are in different hands, still less\r\ndoes it imply the existence of a law of superior obligation which\r\ncontrols legally the acts of the legislature. Before discussing that\r\nquestion, one must understand clearly what is meant by a law. In\r\nEngland, and in the countries that have inherited the Anglo-Norman\r\nsystem of jurisprudence, a law may be defined as a rule that will be\r\nenforced by the courts. This results from the fact that officers of the\r\ngovernment, like private persons, are subject to judicial process, and\r\nliable to have the legality of their actions examined and determined by\r\nthe ordinary tribunals. Hence a rule recognised as law by the courts\r\nwill be enforced against both officials and private citizens; and a rule\r\nwhich they do not recognise cannot be enforced at all, for they will\r\nentertain suits and prosecutions against officials who try to apply it,\r\nand will afford protection to individuals who resist them.[6:1] Assuming\r\nthis definition of law, the famous decision of Chief Justice\r\nMarshall[6:2] that an Act of Congress inconsistent with the Constitution\r\nof the United States must be treated as invalid was a logical necessity.\r\nThe Constitution was certainly intended to be a law, and as such it\r\ncould be enforced by the courts. But if that law came into conflict with\r\nanother law, an Act of Congress for example, the court must consider, as\r\nin any other case of conflict of laws, which law was of superior\r\nauthority; and there could be no doubt that the Constitution was the\r\nsuperior of the two. The same principle is applied in the British\r\ncolonies, when colonial acts come into collision with the Acts of\r\nParliament establishing the colonial government;[7:1] and it has been\r\nincorporated into the constitutions of the Spanish American republics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Where the Civil Law Prevails.]\r\n\r\nBut, except for those Latin countries which have copied it from the\r\nUnited States, the doctrine is almost entirely confined to the places\r\nwhere the Common Law prevails,[7:2] for elsewhere the same definition of\r\nlaw does not obtain. In accordance with the French interpretation of the\r\ntheory of the separation of powers, it is the general rule on the\r\ncontinent of Europe that the ordinary courts administer only private law\r\nbetween private citizens, and that questions affecting the rights and\r\nduties of public officials are withdrawn from their jurisdiction. Such\r\nquestions are now usually, though not universally, submitted to special\r\ntribunals known as administrative courts. The rules administered by\r\nthese tribunals are laws, but they form a distinct and separate branch\r\nof the law from that applied by the ordinary courts. On the continent,\r\ntherefore, a constitution may or may not be properly regarded as a law,\r\nbut even if it be so regarded it is not of necessity enforced by any\r\ncourt. On the contrary, if an ordinary court is not suffered to pass\r\nupon the legality of the actions of a policeman, it would be hardly\r\nrational that it should pass upon the validity of an act of the national\r\nlegislature; and it would be even more irrational to intrust any such\r\npower to the administrative courts which are under the influence of the\r\nexecutive branch of the government.[8:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Legal Restraints on Power of Legislature are Rare.]\r\n\r\nThe conception of a constitution as a law of superior obligation, which\r\nimposes legal restraints upon the action of the legislature, is really\r\nconfined to a very few countries, chiefly to America and the English\r\nself-governing colonies.[8:2] In Europe it has no proper place, for\r\nwhether a constitution in continental states be or be not regarded as a\r\nsupreme law, no body of men has, as a rule, been intrusted with legal\r\nauthority to enforce its provisions as against the legislature; and in\r\nEngland there is no law superior in obligation to an Act of Parliament.\r\nThere can, indeed, be no doubt that the Acts of Union with Scotland and\r\nIreland were intended to be, in part at least, forever binding, but as\r\nthey created no authority with power either to enforce or to amend the\r\nActs, the united Parliament assumed that, like its predecessors, it\r\npossessed unlimited sovereignty; and it has, in fact, altered material\r\nprovisions in each of those statutes.[8:3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sources of the English Constitution.]\r\n\r\nThe English Constitution--speaking, of course, of its form, not its\r\ncontent--differs, therefore, from those of most other European nations\r\nmore widely in method of expression than in essential nature and legal\r\neffect. They have been created usually as a result of a movement to\r\nchange fundamentally the political institutions of the country, and the\r\nnew plan has naturally been embodied in a document; but since the\r\nRestoration England has never revised her frame of government as a\r\nwhole, and hence has felt no need of codifying it. The national\r\npolitical institutions are to be found in statutes,[9:1] in customs\r\nwhich are enforced and developed by the courts and form a part of the\r\nCommon Law, and in customs strictly so called which have no legal\r\nvalidity whatever and cannot be enforced at law. These last are very\r\nappropriately called by Professor Dicey the conventions of the\r\nconstitution. The two chief peculiarities of the English Constitution\r\nare: first, that no laws are ear-marked as constitutional,--all laws can\r\nbe changed by Parliament, and hence it is futile to attempt to draw a\r\nsharp line between those laws which do and those which do not form a\r\npart of the constitution;--second, the large part played by customary\r\nrules, which are carefully followed, but which are entirely devoid of\r\nlegal sanction. Customs or conventions of this kind exist, and in the\r\nnature of things must to some extent exist, under all governments. In\r\nthe United States where they might, perhaps, be least expected, they\r\nhave, as already observed, transformed the presidential electors into a\r\nmere machine for registering the popular vote in the several states, and\r\nthis is only the most striking of the instances that might be\r\ncited.[9:2] England is peculiar, not because it has such conventions,\r\nbut because they are more abundant and all-pervasive than elsewhere. The\r\nmost familiar of them is, of course, the rule that the King must act on\r\nthe advice of his ministers, while they must resign or dissolve\r\nParliament when they lose the confidence of the majority in the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, however, to make a precise list of the conventions of\r\nthe constitution, for they are constantly changing by a natural process\r\nof growth and decay; and while some of them are universally accepted,\r\nothers are in a state of uncertainty. Hence one hears from time to time\r\na member of the Opposition assert that some action of the government is\r\nunconstitutional, meaning that it is an unusual breach of a principle\r\nwhich in his opinion ought to be recognised as inviolable. It was said,\r\nfor example, that the Parliament of 1900, having been elected on the\r\nissue of the South African war, was not justified in enacting measures\r\nof great importance on other subjects, but that a fresh mandate from the\r\nnation ought to be obtained by another general election. As claims of\r\nthis kind are in dispute, those customs alone can safely be said to be a\r\npart of the constitution which are generally assumed to be outside the\r\nrange of current political controversy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Relation of Law and Custom.]\r\n\r\nThe relation between law and custom in the English government is\r\ncharacteristic. From the very fact that the law consists of those rules\r\nwhich are enforced by the courts, it follows that the law,--including,\r\nof course, both the statutes and the Common Law,--is perfectly distinct\r\nfrom the conventions of the constitution; is quite independent of them,\r\nand is rigidly enforced. The conventions do not abrogate or obliterate\r\nlegal rights and privileges, but merely determine how they shall be\r\nexercised. The legal forms are scrupulously observed, and are as\r\nrequisite for the validity of an act as if custom had not affected their\r\nuse.[10:1] The power of the Crown, for example, to refuse its consent to\r\nbills passed by the two Houses of Parliament is obsolete, yet the right\r\nremains legally unimpaired. The royal assent is given to such bills with\r\nas much solemnity as if it were still discretionary, and without that\r\nformality a statute would have no validity whatever. Public law in\r\ncountries where it is administered not by the ordinary courts, but\r\nsolely by the executive, or with the aid of special tribunals composed\r\nof administrative officials, must of necessity contain a discretionary\r\nelement, and that element is always affected by political conventions.\r\nHence there is a likelihood that the line between law and convention\r\nwill become blurred, but this is not so in England. There the law and\r\nthe conventions of the constitution are each developing by processes\r\npeculiar to themselves, but the line between them remains permanently\r\nclear. The conventions are superimposed upon the law, and modify\r\npolitical relations without in the least affecting legal ones. In fact\r\nFreeman declared that the growth of the unwritten conventions of the\r\nconstitution began after the supremacy of the law had been firmly\r\nestablished by the revolution of 1688, and that they could not have been\r\nevolved if that condition had not existed.[11:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sanction of Custom.]\r\n\r\nThe question why the conventions of the constitution are so scrupulously\r\nfollowed, when they have no legal force, is not a simple one.\r\nImpeachment as a means of compelling the observance of traditions has,\r\nof course, long been obsolete. Professor Dicey maintains that the\r\nultimate sanction of these conventions lies in the fact that any\r\nministry or official violating them would be speedily brought into\r\nconflict with the law of the land as enforced by the courts.[11:2] He\r\ntakes as illustrations the omission to summon Parliament every year, and\r\nthe retention of office by a ministry against the will of the Commons\r\nwithout dissolving; and he shows in each case how the ministry would be\r\nbrought into conflict with the law by the failure to enact the annual\r\narmy bill or to pass the appropriations. He proves that in such cases\r\nthe wheels of government would be stopped by the regular operation of\r\nthe law; and that the House of Commons can readily bring about this\r\nresult if it pleases.[12:1] There is, however, another question, and\r\nthat is why the House is determined to exert its power so as to maintain\r\nthe conventions of the constitution as they stand to-day. It has long\r\npossessed the necessary authority, but the conventions were evolved\r\nslowly. The House of Representatives in Washington has the same power to\r\nstop appropriations, but it does not try to use it to force a\r\nresponsible ministry upon the President; a result which has, on the\r\nother hand, been brought about in France almost as conclusively as in\r\nEngland, and that without the sanction arising from the risk of conflict\r\nbetween the government and the courts. Any parliament could use its\r\nauthority if it chose to keep the ministry in office indefinitely, as\r\nwell as to make it responsible. It could pass a permanent army act,\r\ngrant the tea and income taxes for a term of years, charge all ordinary\r\nexpenses upon the Consolidated Fund, and so make the existing ministry\r\nwell-nigh independent of future parliaments.\r\n\r\nThe question seems to resolve itself into two parts: first, why a custom\r\nonce established is so tenaciously followed in England; and, second, why\r\nthe conventions have assumed their present form. In regard to the first\r\nit may be suggested that while the consequences mentioned by Professor\r\nDicey form, no doubt, the ultimate sanction of the most important\r\nconventions of the constitution, they are not the usual, or in fact the\r\nreal, motive for obedience; just as the dread of criminal punishment is\r\nnot the general motive for ordinary morality. The risk of imprisonment\r\nnever occurs, indeed, to people of high character, and in the same way\r\nthe ultimate sanctions of the law are not usually present in the minds\r\nof men in English public life. In the main the conventions are observed\r\nbecause they are a code of honour. They are, as it were, the rules of\r\nthe game, and the single class in the community which has hitherto had\r\nthe conduct of English public life almost entirely in its own hands is\r\nthe very class that is peculiarly sensitive to obligation of this kind.\r\nMoreover, the very fact that one class rules, by the sufferance of the\r\nwhole nation, as trustees for the public, makes that class exceedingly\r\ncareful not to violate the understandings on which the trust is held.\r\n\r\nThe key to the question why the conventions have assumed their present\r\nform is to be found mainly in Professor Dicey's remark[13:1] that all of\r\nthem exist for the sake of securing obedience to the deliberately\r\nexpressed will of the House of Commons, and ultimately to the will of\r\nthe nation. Their effect has been to bring the prerogatives of the Crown\r\nmore and more completely under the control of the cabinet, and the\r\ncabinet itself under the control of the House of Commons; to restrain\r\nthe opposition of the Lords to any policy on which the Commons backed by\r\nthe nation are determined; and, finally, through the power of\r\ndissolution to make the House of Commons itself reflect as nearly as may\r\nbe the views of the electorate. In England there is, in fact, only one\r\nconclusive means of expressing the popular will--that of an election to\r\nthe House of Commons; and in ordinary cases there is only one body that\r\nhas power to interpret that expression, the cabinet placed in office by\r\nthe House so elected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Effects of Custom.]\r\n\r\nProfessor Dicey has also pointed out a singular result of the\r\nconventions. If the growing power of the House of Commons, instead of\r\nbeing used to impose customary restraints on the exercise of authority\r\nby the Crown and the House of Lords, had been exerted to limit that\r\nauthority by law, the Crown and the House of Lords would have been far\r\nmore free to exercise at their discretion the powers still left in their\r\nhands; and hence the House of Commons could not have obtained its\r\npresent omnipotence. By leaving the prerogative substantially untouched\r\nby law, and requiring that it should be wielded by ministers responsible\r\nto them, the Commons have drawn into their own control all the powers\r\nof the sovereign that time has not rendered entirely obsolete.\r\n\r\nThe great part played by custom has had another effect upon English\r\npublic life. It has tended to develop a conservative temperament. If\r\nlaws are changed the new ones may have the same authority as the old;\r\nbut if customs are changed rapidly they lose their force altogether.\r\nStability is necessary for the very life of custom. The conventions of\r\nthe constitution could not exist without respect for precedent, and\r\nwhere the institutions and liberties of a country depend not upon a\r\nwritten code, but upon custom, there is a natural tendency to magnify\r\nthe importance of tradition and precedent in themselves. In England,\r\ntherefore, there is a peculiar veneration for custom, and a disposition\r\nto make as little change in it as is compatible with changing times. The\r\nresult is a constant tinkering, rather than remodelling, of outworn\r\ninstitutions,--a spirit which is strongly marked throughout the whole of\r\nEnglish public life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English System not Logical but Scientific.]\r\n\r\nCritics and apologists both assert that the English political system is\r\nnot logical; and the statement is true in the sense that the system was\r\nnot excogitated by an _a priori_ method. But on the other hand the very\r\nfact that it has grown up by a continual series of adaptations to\r\nexisting needs has made it on the whole more consistent with itself, has\r\nbrought each part more into harmony with the rest, than is the case in\r\nany other government. In this it is like a living organism. There are,\r\nno doubt, many small anomalies and survivals that mar the unity for the\r\npurpose of description; but these, like survivals of structure in\r\nanimals, like the splint bones in the leg of a horse for example, do not\r\ninterfere seriously with the action of the whole. It may be said that in\r\npolitics the Frenchman has tended in the past to draw logical\r\nconclusions from correct premises, and that his results have often been\r\nwrong, while the Englishman draws illogical conclusions from incorrect\r\npremises, and his results are commonly right. The fact being that all\r\nabstract propositions in politics are at best approximations, and an\r\nattempt to reason from them usually magnifies the inaccuracy. But in\r\nEngland the institutions being empirical have resulted from experience,\r\nalthough men have often tried to explain them afterwards by a somewhat\r\nartificial and incongruous process of reasoning. In this sense French\r\npolitical principles may be said to be the more logical, the English\r\ngovernment--not the theories about it--the more scientific. It is more\r\nimportant, therefore, to describe the organs of the English government\r\nand their relations to one another than to consider the traditional\r\nprinciples that have been supposed to underlie the system. But the very\r\nnature of the English government renders it peculiarly difficult to\r\nportray. As the laws that regulate its structure are overlaid by customs\r\nwhich moderate very greatly their operation without affecting their\r\nmeaning or their validity, it is necessary to describe separately the\r\nlegal and customary aspects of the constitution. It is almost\r\nunavoidable to pass in review first the legal organisation of each\r\ninstitution, and then its actual functions. Such a process is sometimes\r\ntedious, especially for a person already familiar with the subject, but\r\nan attempt has been made in the following pages to separate as far as\r\npossible the dry legal details from a discussion of the working forces,\r\nso that the former may be skipped by the judicious reader.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1:1] _La Democratie en Amerique_, I., Ch. vi.\r\n\r\n[1:2] 30-31 Vic., c. 3, Sec. 11.\r\n\r\n[1:3] 63-64 Vic., c. 12, Const., Secs. 64-65.\r\n\r\n[2:1] The provisions about the responsibility of the ministers are\r\nalmost identical in the constitutions of Belgium (Arts. 63, 64, 65, 88,\r\n89, 90) and Prussia (Arts. 44, 45, 60, 61); but in Belgium the cabinet\r\nis politically responsible to the chamber, while in Prussia it is not.\r\n\r\n[2:2] \"Studies in History and Jurisprudence,\" Essay III.\r\n\r\n[3:1] _Cf._ Brusa, _Italien_, in Marquardsen's _Handbuch des\r\nOeffentlichen Rechts_, 12-16, 181-82.\r\n\r\n[3:2] Professor Dicey points out (\"Law of the Constitution,\" 5 Ed., 116\r\nand Note 2) that De Tocqueville considered the Charter unalterable by\r\nreason of this omission, but that it was, in fact, changed like an\r\nordinary law.\r\n\r\n[3:3] For the purpose of the argument it is unimportant that Prussia is\r\nnot a sovereign state, and for sixteen years it did exist as an\r\nindependent sovereign state under its present constitution.\r\n\r\n[4:1] Constitutional amendments can also be proposed by popular\r\ninitiative, and ordinary laws cannot.\r\n\r\n[5:1] Const., Art. 78.\r\n\r\n[5:2] _Ibid._, Art. 5.\r\n\r\n[6:1] By far the best exposition of this matter is to be found in\r\nProfessor Dicey's \"Law of the Constitution.\" It is discussed more fully\r\nin Chapter xl., _infra_.\r\n\r\n[6:2] Marbury _vs._ Madison, 1 Cranch, 137.\r\n\r\n[7:1] The Australian Federation Act (Sec. 74) refers particularly to the\r\ndecision of such questions, limiting the right to bring them on appeal\r\nbefore the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\r\n\r\n[7:2] There are a few exceptions. Provisions giving such a power to the\r\ncourts are to be found in the constitutions of the little Swiss cantons\r\nof Uri (Art. 51) and Unterwalden nid dem Wald (Art. 43). The Swiss\r\nnational constitution, on the other hand (Art. 113), directs the Federal\r\nTribunal to apply every law enacted by the national legislature. Some\r\ndiscussion has taken place on the question in Germany. (See Brinton\r\nCoxe, \"Judicial Power and Unconstitutional Legislation,\" Ch. ix., and\r\nthe writer's \"Governments and Parties in Continental Europe,\" I.,\r\n282-84.) Curiously enough, a struggle over this question occurred in the\r\nTransvaal not long before the South African War (Bryce's \"Studies in\r\nHistory and Jurisprudence,\" 378; Kruger's \"Memoirs,\" 254-57). In his\r\nnext inaugural address President Kruger quoted Scripture to prove that\r\nthe principle of holding statutes unconstitutional had been invented by\r\nthe devil. (Kruger, 354-55.)\r\n\r\n[8:1] Esmein (_Elements de droit constitutionel_, 425-28) describes the\r\nvarious proposals made at different times in France for annulling\r\nunconstitutional laws. One of these, Sieyes's _jurie constitutionaire_,\r\nbears a curious resemblance to an institution for a somewhat analogous\r\npurpose in Athens: Goodwin, \"Demosthenes on the Crown,\" Essay II.,\r\n316-27.\r\n\r\n[8:2] It must be observed, also, that the English colonies are not\r\nlegally independent or sovereign states, and hence their parliaments are\r\nlegally subordinate legislatures. We may note in this connection that\r\nthe Swiss Federal Tribunal can hold unconstitutional laws of the cantons\r\nwhich violate the constitution either of the confederation or of the\r\ncanton.\r\n\r\n[8:3] Professor Dicey argued that the first Home Rule Bill if enacted\r\nmight have restricted the legal sovereignty of Parliament. \"England's\r\nCase against Home Rule,\" 238, _et seq._ This result was denied by the\r\nother side.

But all these are in legal effect simply\r\nstatutes.\r\n\r\n[9:2] Bryce, American Commonwealth, Ch. xxxiv.\r\n\r\n[10:1] The habit of collecting new or increased duties or excises as\r\nsoon as the resolution to impose them passes the House of Commons is an\r\napparent exception to this principle, for the taxes are not legally\r\npayable until laid by Act of Parliament. The object of the custom is to\r\nprevent a large loss of revenue by importations made after it is known\r\nthat the duty will be levied and before it goes into effect. The act\r\nwhen passed contains, of course, a clause authorising and thereby making\r\nlegal the collection from the date of the resolution, and if it fails to\r\npass the tax is refunded.\r\n\r\n[11:1] \"Growth of the English Constitution,\" 107, 112-13, 119.\r\n\r\n[11:2] \"Law of the Constitution,\" Ch. xv.\r\n\r\n[12:1] All this is true only of conventions that give effect to the will\r\nof the majority of the House of Commons, not of those that secure fair\r\nplay to the minority, which are in fact not less important.\r\n\r\n[13:1] \"Law of the Constitution,\" 360, 384.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.--CENTRAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE CROWN\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical liberty and romance in English history are both bound up with\r\nthe shifting fortunes of the throne. The strong hand of the Norman and\r\nAngevin kings welded the whole country into a nation, and on that\r\nfoundation were built the solid structures of a national Common Law, a\r\nnational Parliament, and a long series of national statutes. When in the\r\nfulness of time the Crown had accomplished its work of unification, it\r\ncame into conflict with Parliament, and after a series of convulsions,\r\nin which one king lost his head and another his throne, political\r\nevolution resumed its normal course. The House of Commons gradually drew\r\nthe royal authority under its control. But it did so without seriously\r\ncurtailing the legal powers of the Crown, and thus the King legally\r\nenjoys most of the attributes that belonged to his predecessors,\r\nalthough the exercise of his functions has passed into other hands. If\r\nthe personal authority of the monarch has become a shadow of its former\r\nmassiveness, the government is still conducted in his name, and largely\r\nby means of the legal rights attached to his office. With a study of the\r\nCrown, therefore, a description of English government most fittingly\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Title to the Crown.]\r\n\r\nEver since 1688, when James II., fleeing in fear of his life, \"withdrew\r\nhimself out of the kingdom, and thereby abdicated,\" the title to the\r\nCrown has been based entirely upon parliamentary enactment. At the\r\npresent day it rests upon the Act of Settlement of 1700,[16:1] which\r\nprovided that, in default of heirs of William and of Anne, the Crown\r\nshould pass to the Electress Sophia, and the heirs of her body, being\r\nProtestants. Sophia was the granddaughter of James I., through her\r\nmother, wife of the Elector Palatine; and while not his nearest heir,\r\nwas the nearest who was a Protestant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Rules of Succession.]\r\n\r\nThe rules of descent are in the main the same as those for the\r\ninheritance of land at Common Law.[17:1] That is, the title passes to\r\nthe eldest son; or, if he is not living, through him to his issue, male\r\nor female, as if he had himself died upon the throne. If the first son\r\nhas died without issue, then to, or through, the eldest son who is\r\nliving, or has issue living; and in default of any sons living, or\r\nleaving issue, then to, or through, the eldest daughter. The rule is,\r\nhowever, subject to the qualification that any one who is, or becomes, a\r\nCatholic is excluded from, and forfeits, the right to the Crown, which\r\nthen passes to the next heir. In order to insure a test that will make\r\nthis last provision effective, the sovereign is obliged to take an oath,\r\nabjuring the Catholic religion, in words which have proved offensive to\r\nmembers of that faith. After the accession of Edward VII., therefore,\r\nbut before his coronation, an effort was made to modify the form of the\r\noath, and a bill was introduced into the House of Lords for that\r\npurpose; but it was not then found possible to arrange a phrase\r\nsatisfactory to all parties, and the bill was dropped.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Incapacity of the Sovereign.]\r\n\r\nIn other monarchies permanent provision has been made by law for the\r\npossible incapacity of the monarch, whether by reason of infancy or\r\ninsanity. But this has never been done in England. Each case has been\r\ndealt with as it arose, and usually after it has arisen, so that, in\r\ndefault of any person competent to give the royal assent to bills,\r\nParliament has been driven into the legal absurdity of first passing a\r\nregency bill to confer such a power upon a regent, and then directing\r\nthe Chancellor to affix the Great Seal to a commission for giving assent\r\nto that bill. Until recent times it was also thought necessary to\r\nappoint officers, Lords Justices or others, to exercise the royal\r\npowers when the sovereign went out of the kingdom; but with the rapidity\r\nof modern travel and communication this has become unnecessary, and it\r\nhas not been done since the accession of Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Powers of the Crown.]\r\n\r\nThe authority of the English monarch may be considered from different\r\npoints of view, which must be taken up in succession; the first question\r\nbeing what power is legally vested in the Crown; the second how much of\r\nthat power can practically be exercised at all; the third how far the\r\npower of the Crown actually is, or may be, used in accordance with the\r\npersonal wishes of the King, and how far its exercise is really directed\r\nby his ministers; the fourth, how far their action is in turn controlled\r\nby Parliament. The first two questions, which form the subject of this\r\nchapter, cannot always be treated separately, for it is sometimes\r\nimpossible to be sure whether a power that cannot practically be\r\nexercised is or is not legally vested in the Crown. An attempt to make\r\nuse of any doubtful power would probably be resisted, and the legality\r\nof the act could be discussed in Parliament or determined by the law\r\ncourts; but it is very rare at the present day that any such attempt is\r\nmade. There are powers that have been disputed, or fallen into disuse,\r\nand that no government would ever think of reviving; and thus the\r\nquestion of law never having been settled, the legal right of the Crown\r\nto make use of them must remain uncertain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Prerogative.]\r\n\r\nThe authority of the Crown may be traced to two different sources. One\r\nof them is statutory, and comprises the various powers conferred upon\r\nthe Crown by Acts of Parliament. The other source gives rise to what is\r\nmore properly called the prerogative. This has been described by\r\nProfessor Dicey[18:1] as the original discretionary authority left at\r\nany moment in the hands of the King; in other words, what remains of the\r\nancient customary or Common Law powers inherent in the Crown. The\r\ndistinction is one not always perfectly easy to draw, for many parts of\r\nthe prerogative have been regulated and modified by statute, and in such\r\ncases it is not always clear whether the authority now exercised is\r\nderived from statute or from the prerogative. Nevertheless the\r\ndistinction is often important, because where the powers have been\r\nconferred by Parliament the Crown acts by virtue of a delegated\r\nauthority which lies wholly within the four corners of the statute, and\r\nexists only so far as it is expressly contained therein; while the\r\nprerogative not being circumscribed by any document is more indefinite,\r\nand capable of expanding or contracting with the progress of the suns.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Legislative Power.]\r\n\r\nAll legislative power is vested in the King in Parliament; that is, in\r\nthe King acting in concert with the two Houses. Legally, every act\r\nrequires the royal assent, and, indeed, the Houses can transact business\r\nonly during the pleasure of the Crown, which summons and prorogues them,\r\nand can at any moment dissolve the House of Commons. But it is important\r\nto note that by itself, and apart from Parliament, the Crown has to-day,\r\nwithin the United Kingdom,[19:1] no inherent legislative power whatever.\r\nThis was not always true, for legislation has at times been enacted by\r\nthe Crown alone in the form of ordinances or proclamations; but the\r\npractice may be said to have received its death-blow from the famous\r\nopinion of Lord Coke, \"that the King by his proclamation cannot create\r\nany offence which was not an offence before, for then he may alter the\r\nlaw of the land.\"[19:2] The English Crown has, therefore, no inherent\r\npower to make ordinances for completing the laws, such as is possessed\r\nby the chief magistrate in France and other continental states. This\r\ndoes not mean that it cannot make regulations for the conduct of\r\naffairs by its own servants, by Orders in Council, for example,\r\nestablishing regulations for the management of the Army, or prescribing\r\nexaminations for entrance to the civil service. These are merely rules\r\nsuch as any private employer might make in his own business, and differ\r\nentirely in their nature from ordinances which have the force of law,\r\nand are binding quite apart from any contract of employment.\r\n\r\nPower to make ordinances which have the force of law and are binding on\r\nthe whole community is, however, frequently given to the Crown[20:1] by\r\nstatute, notably in matters affecting public health, education, etc.,\r\nand the practice is constantly becoming more and more extensive, until\r\nat present the rules made in pursuance of such powers--known as\r\n\"statutory orders\"--are published every year in a volume similar in form\r\nto that containing the statutes. Some of these orders must be submitted\r\nto Parliament, but go into effect unless within a certain time an\r\naddress to the contrary is passed by one of the Houses, while others\r\ntake effect at once, or after a fixed period, and are laid upon the\r\ntables of the Houses in order to give formal notice of their adoption. A\r\nfuller description of these orders must, however, be postponed to the\r\nchapters that deal with Parliament. It is only necessary here to point\r\nout that in making such orders the Crown acts by virtue of a purely\r\ndelegated authority, and stands in the same position as a town council.\r\nThe orders are a species of subordinate legislation, and can be enacted\r\nonly in strict conformity with the statutes by which the power is\r\ngranted; and being delegated, not inherent in the Crown, a power of this\r\nkind does not fall within the prerogative in its narrower and more\r\nappropriate sense.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Executive Power.]\r\n\r\nThe Crown is at the head of the executive branch of the central\r\ngovernment, and carries out the laws, so far as their execution requires\r\nthe intervention of any national public authority. In fact all national\r\nexecutive power, whether regulated by statute, or forming strictly a\r\npart of the prerogative, is exercised in the name of the Crown, and by\r\nits authority, except when directly conferred by statute upon some\r\nofficer of the Crown, and in this case, as we shall see, it is exercised\r\nby that officer as a servant of the Crown, and under its direction and\r\ncontrol. Legally some of the executive powers are indeed vested in the\r\nCrown in Council--that is, in the King acting with his Privy\r\nCouncil--but as the Council has no independent authority, and consists,\r\nfor practical purposes, of the principal ministers appointed by the\r\nCrown, even these powers may be said to reside in the Crown alone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Appointments to Office.]\r\n\r\nAll national public officers, except some of the officials of the Houses\r\nof Parliament, and a few hereditary dignitaries whose duties are purely\r\nceremonial,[21:1] are appointed directly by the Crown or by the high\r\nstate officials whom it has itself appointed; and the Crown has also the\r\nright to remove them, barring a small number whose tenure is during good\r\nbehaviour. Of these last by far the most important are the judges, the\r\nmembers of the Council of India, and the Controller and Auditor General,\r\nno one of whom has any direct part in the executive government of the\r\nkingdom.[21:2] Now the right to appoint and remove involves the power to\r\ncontrol; and, therefore, it may be said in general that the whole\r\nexecutive machinery of the central government of England is under the\r\ndirection of the Crown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other Powers under the Prerogative.]\r\n\r\nThe Crown furthermore authorises under the sign manual the expenditure\r\nof public money in accordance with the appropriations made by\r\nParliament, and then expends the money. It can grant charters of\r\nincorporation, with powers not inconsistent with the law of the land, so\r\nfar as the right to do so has not been limited by statute; but in\r\nconsequence of the various reform acts, municipal corporation acts, and\r\nlocal government acts, no charter conferring political power can now be\r\ncreated except in pursuance of statute, while even commercial companies\r\nusually require privileges which can be given only by the same\r\nauthority.[22:1] The Crown grants all pardons, creates all peers, and\r\nconfers all titles and honours. As head of the Established Church of\r\nEngland it summons Convocation with a license to transact business\r\nspecified in advance. It virtually appoints the archbishops, bishops and\r\nmost of the deans and canons, and has in its gift many rectorships and\r\nother livings.[22:2] As head of the Army and Navy it raises and controls\r\nthe armed forces of the nation, and makes regulations for their\r\ngovernment, subject, of course, to the statutes and to the passage of\r\nthe Annual Army Act. It represents the empire in all external relations,\r\nand in all dealings with foreign powers. It has power to declare war,\r\nmake peace, and conclude treaties, save that, without the sanction of\r\nParliament, a treaty cannot impose a charge upon the people, or change\r\nthe law of the land, and it is doubtful how far without that sanction\r\nprivate rights can be sacrificed or territory ceded.[22:3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Executive Powers under Statutes.]\r\n\r\nJust as Parliament has often conferred legislative authority upon the\r\nCrown, so it has conferred executive power in addition to that possessed\r\nby virtue of the prerogative. I do not refer here to the cases where a\r\nstatute creates new public duties to be performed directly by the Crown\r\nand confers upon it the authority needed for the purpose. Such powers,\r\nalthough statutory, are exercised in the same way as those derived from\r\nthe prerogative. I refer to statutes that regulate the duties or\r\nprivileges of local and other bodies, and give to the Crown, not a\r\ndirect authority to carry out the law, but a power of supervision and\r\ncontrol. Statutes of this kind have become very common during the last\r\nhalf century in relation to such matters as local government, public\r\nhealth, pauperism, housing of the working-classes, education, tramways,\r\nelectric lighting and a host of other things. Even without an express\r\ngrant of authority, supervisory powers have often been conferred upon\r\nthe Crown by means of appropriations for local purposes which can be\r\napplied by the government at its discretion, and hence in accordance\r\nwith such regulations as it chooses to prescribe. This has been true,\r\nfor example, of the subsidies in aid of the local police, and of\r\neducation. By such methods the local authorities, and especially the\r\nsmaller ones, have been brought under the tutelage of the Crown to an\r\nextent quite unknown in the past.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wide Extent of the Powers of the Crown.]\r\n\r\nAll told, the executive authority of the Crown is, in the eye of the\r\nlaw, very wide, far wider than that of the chief magistrate in many\r\ncountries, and well-nigh as extensive as that now possessed by the\r\nmonarch in any government not an absolute despotism; and although the\r\nCrown has no inherent legislative power except in conjunction with\r\nParliament, it has been given by statute very large powers of\r\nsubordinate legislation. \"It would very much surprise people,\" as\r\nBagehot remarked in his incisive way, \"if they were only told how many\r\nthings the Queen could do without consulting Parliament . . . Not to\r\nmention other things, she could disband the army (by law she cannot\r\nengage more than a certain number of men, but she is not obliged to\r\nengage any men); she could dismiss all the officers, from the General\r\nCommanding-in-Chief downwards; she could dismiss all the sailors too;\r\nshe could sell off all our ships of war and all our naval stores; she\r\ncould make a peace by the sacrifice of Cornwall, and begin a war for the\r\nconquest of Brittany. She could make every citizen in the United\r\nKingdom, male or female, a peer; she could make every parish in the\r\nUnited Kingdom a 'university'; she could dismiss most of the civil\r\nservants; she could pardon all offenders. In a word, the Queen could by\r\nprerogative upset all the action of civil government within the\r\ngovernment.\"[24:1] We might add that the Crown could appoint bishops,\r\nand in many places clergymen, whose doctrines were repulsive to their\r\nflocks; could cause every dog to be muzzled, every pauper to eat leeks,\r\nevery child in the public elementary schools to study Welsh; and could\r\nmake all local improvements, such as tramways and electric light,\r\nwell-nigh impossible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Powers that have been Lost.]\r\n\r\nGreat as the prerogative is to-day, it was, in some directions, even\r\nmore extensive in the past, and men are in the habit of repeating the\r\nphrases derived from that past after they have lost their meaning. This\r\nis done by writers who are not under the slightest misapprehension in\r\nregard to the actual legal authority of the Crown. It is the habit, for\r\nexample, to speak of the Crown as the fountain of justice, and even an\r\nauthor so learned and accurate as Todd repeats Blackstone's statement\r\nthat \"By the fountain of justice, the law does not mean the author or\r\noriginal, but only the distributor. Justice is not derived from the\r\nking, as from his free gift, but he is the steward of the public, to\r\ndispense it to whom it is due. He is not the spring, but the reservoir,\r\nfrom whence right and equity are conducted by a thousand channels to\r\nevery individual.\"[24:2] Now apart from public prosecution by the state,\r\nwhich is less common in England than elsewhere, and the use of the\r\nKing's name in judicial process, the only legal connection of the Crown\r\nwith the distribution of justice to-day lies in the appointment of the\r\njudges; and to call it on that account the reservoir of justice is\r\nmerely fanciful. There was a time when the Crown was really the fountain\r\nor reservoir of justice, when it might fairly have been said to\r\nadminister justice by deputy. It created the Common Law courts, and\r\nafter the growth of civilisation had produced more refined and complex\r\nideas of justice it received petitions for the redress of wrongs not\r\nrecognised before, and established new courts to deal with them. Stubbs\r\nhas compared the process to that of the sun throwing off a series of\r\nnebulous envelopes, which rolled up into compact bodies, but left the\r\nold nucleus of light to assert its vitality, unimpaired by successive\r\nemanations.[25:1] In this way the courts of equity arose to give relief\r\nin cases where there was no remedy by the strict rules of the Common\r\nLaw, while the Star Chamber performed an analogous function in criminal\r\nmatters. This last tribunal came to be used as a political engine under\r\nthe Stuarts, and was abolished by statute[25:2] early in the struggle\r\nwith Charles I. With the fall of the Stuarts the power of the Crown to\r\ncreate new courts came to an end altogether. In 1689 the Bill of Rights\r\ndeclared the \"Court of Commissioners for Ecclesiastical Causes, and all\r\nother Commissions and Courts of a like Nature,\" illegal, and since that\r\ntime an Act of Parliament has been necessary to create any new court of\r\njustice in England.\r\n\r\nThe Crown has been deprived in the same way of other powers once\r\npossessed or claimed under the prerogative. The Bill of Rights, for\r\nexample, declared illegal the suspending or dispensing with laws, and\r\nthe maintenance of a standing army in time of peace without the consent\r\nof Parliament. Some powers have, from long disuse, become obsolete and\r\nhave been lost; such as the right to confer on boroughs the privilege of\r\nelecting members to the House of Commons;[25:3] and the power to create\r\nlife peers with votes in the House of Lords.[25:4] Other powers again,\r\nalthough legally unimpaired, have become obsolete in practice, and can\r\nno longer be exerted. The illustration commonly given of this is the\r\nright of the Crown to withhold its assent to a bill passed by\r\nParliament,--popularly called, or miscalled, the veto. The right has\r\nnot been exercised since the days of Queen Anne; but it may not be gone\r\nso completely beyond revival as is generally supposed. It could, of\r\ncourse, be used only on the advice of the ministry of the day, and under\r\nordinary circumstances a ministry willing to withhold the royal assent\r\nto a bill would be bound to treat the passage of that bill by the House\r\nof Commons as a ground for resignation or dissolution. One can imagine,\r\nhowever, a case where after a bill has passed the Commons the ministry\r\nshould resign, and the House of Lords should insist on passing the bill\r\nin spite of the opposition of the new cabinet. It would be rash to\r\nassert that in such a case the royal assent would not be withheld.\r\nSomething of the kind very nearly occurred in 1858, when the ministry\r\nthreatened to advise the Queen to withhold her assent to a private bill\r\nunless the Lords gave permission to the Board of Works to appear before\r\nthe private bill committee and oppose the plans.[26:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Powers of the Crown exercised by Ministers.]\r\n\r\nSince the accession of the House of Hanover the new powers conferred\r\nupon the Crown by statute have probably more than made up for the loss\r\nto the prerogative of powers which have either been restricted by the\r\nsame process or become obsolete by disuse. By far the greater part of\r\nthe prerogative, as it existed at that time, has remained legally vested\r\nin the Crown, and can be exercised to-day; but it is no longer used in\r\naccordance with the personal wishes of the sovereign. By a gradual\r\nprocess his authority has come more and more under the control of his\r\nministers, until it is now almost entirely in the hands of the cabinet,\r\nwhich is responsible to Parliament, and through Parliament to the\r\nnation. The cabinet is to-day the mainspring of the whole political\r\nsystem, and the clearest method of explaining the relations of the\r\ndifferent branches of the government to each other is to describe in\r\nsuccession their relations with the cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16:1] 12-13 Will.

The\r\nstory has been told by others far better than the writer could tell it,\r\nand the object here is only to note the results of that process in the\r\nexisting constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The King can do no Wrong at Law;]\r\n\r\nThe doctrine that \"the King can do no wrong\" had its beginnings as far\r\nback as the infancy of Henry III., and by degrees it grew until it\r\nbecame a cardinal principle of the constitution. Legally it means that\r\nhe cannot be adjudged guilty of wrong-doing, and hence that no\r\nproceedings can be brought against him. He cannot be prosecuted\r\ncriminally, or, without his own consent, sued civilly in tort or in\r\ncontract in any court in the land.[27:1] But clearly if the government\r\nis to be one of law, if public officers like private citizens are to be\r\nsubject to the courts, if the people are to be protected from arbitrary\r\npower, the servant who acts on behalf of the Crown must be held\r\nresponsible for illegal conduct from the consequences of which the King\r\nhimself is free. Hence the principle arose that the King's command is no\r\nexcuse for a wrongful act, and this is a firmly established maxim of the\r\nCommon Law in both civil and criminal proceedings.[27:2] To prevent\r\nroyal violations of the law, however, it is not enough to hold liable a\r\nservant who executes unlawful orders, if the master still has power to\r\ncommit offences directly. A further step must be taken by restraining\r\nthe Crown from acting without the mediation of a servant who can be made\r\naccountable, and for this reason Edward I. was informed that he could\r\nnot make an arrest in person.[28:1] But, as the kings and queens are not\r\nlikely to be tempted into personal assaults and trespasses, the\r\nprinciple that they can act only through agents has had little\r\nimportance from the point of view of their liability at law, although it\r\nis a matter of vital consequence in relation to their political\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: or in Politics.]\r\n\r\nThe doctrine that the King can do no wrong applies not only to legal\r\noffences, but also to political errors. The principle developed slowly,\r\nas a part of the long movement that has brought the royal authority\r\nunder the control of public opinion; not that the process was altogether\r\nconscious, or the steps deliberately planned, but taking constitutional\r\nhistory as a whole, we can see that it tended to a result, and in\r\nspeaking of this it is natural to use terms implying an intent which the\r\nactors did not really possess. To keep the Crown from actual violations\r\nof law was not always easy, but it was far more difficult to prevent it\r\nfrom using its undoubted prerogatives to carry out an unpopular policy.\r\nParliament could do something in a fitful and intermittent way by\r\nrefusing supplies or insisting upon the redress of particular\r\ngrievances, but that alone was not enough to secure harmony between the\r\nCrown and the other political forces of the day. There could, in the\r\nnature of things, be no appropriate penalty for royal misgovernment. In\r\nthe Middle Ages, indeed, a bad king or a weak king might lose his throne\r\nor even his life; but in more settled times such things could not take\r\nplace without a violent convulsion of the whole realm,--a truth only too\r\nwell illustrated by the events of the seventeenth century. An orderly\r\ngovernment cannot be founded on the basis of personal rule tempered by\r\nrevolution. Either the royal power must be exercised at the personal\r\nwill of the monarch, or else other persons who can be made accountable\r\nmust take part in his acts of state.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Minister Responsible for Each of his Acts.]\r\n\r\nAs early as the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the King's Council\r\nhad begun to encumber the affixing of the various seals with a series of\r\nformalities which involved the intervention of one or more royal\r\nofficers. The process continued until custom or statute required that\r\nalmost every public act which the Crown was in the habit of performing\r\ndirectly--except the appointment and removal of the great officers of\r\nstate themselves--must either be done in the Privy Council, or by means\r\nof an instrument authenticated by seals or countersignatures affixed by\r\none or more officers of state.[29:1] The object of these formalities was\r\nto protect the Crown from improvident grants, and to secure the\r\ninfluence of the Council over the administration,[29:2] rather than to\r\ncreate any responsibility to Parliament or the public; and yet it was\r\neasy to maintain, when the time was ripe, that the officer who sealed or\r\nsigned assumed thereby responsibility for the act. Then if a wrong was\r\ncommitted some one could be held to account; for misconduct some one\r\ncould be punished; for acts that were unpopular, or a policy that was\r\nodious, some one beneath the throne could be assailed; and if a strong\r\nexpression of resentment did not deter the offender, Parliament had as a\r\nlast resort the weapons of impeachment and bill of attainder. These\r\nweapons were a stage in the process of evolution, a stepping-stone in\r\nthe progress of parliamentary control, but they were far too rough to\r\nproduce a true accord between the Crown and Parliament; and when the\r\npolitical experiments of William and of Anne, fostered by the timely\r\naccident of two unkingly foreigners upon the throne, evolved at last the\r\nsystem of a responsible ministry in its present form, even impeachment\r\nbecame obsolete, or rather it lingered only as a means of retribution\r\nfor personal malfeasance in office.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nature of Modern Responsibility.]\r\n\r\nThe rules requiring seals or signatures to be affixed to royal acts,\r\nthough somewhat simplified, remain in force to-day, but they have ceased\r\nto be the real source of responsibility. The effort to fasten upon a\r\nparticular person the actual responsibility for each public act of the\r\nCrown by compelling some officer to put his approval of it on record,\r\nhas been superseded by the general principle that the responsibility\r\nmust always be imputed to a minister. Though ignorant of the matter at\r\nthe time it occurred, he becomes answerable if he retains his post after\r\nit comes to his knowledge; and even though not in office when the act\r\nwas done, yet if he is appointed in consequence of it, he assumes with\r\nthe office the responsibility for the act. This happened to Sir Robert\r\nPeel in 1834. Believing, as every one at that time did believe, that the\r\nKing had arbitrarily dismissed Lord Melbourne's cabinet, he said, \"I\r\nshould by my acceptance of the office of First Minister become\r\n_technically, if not morally_, responsible for the dissolution of the\r\npreceding government, although I had not the remotest concern in\r\nit.\"[30:1] The rule is so universal in its operation \"that there is not\r\na moment in the King's life, from his accession to his demise, during\r\nwhich there is not some one responsible to Parliament for his public\r\nconduct.\"[30:2] A minister is now politically responsible for everything\r\nthat occurs in his department, whether countersignature or seal is\r\naffixed by him or not; and all the ministers are jointly responsible for\r\nevery highly important political act. A minister whose policy is\r\ncondemned by Parliament is no longer punished, he resigns; and if the\r\naffair involves more than his personal conduct or competence, if it is\r\nof such moment that it ought to have engaged the attention of the\r\ncabinet, his colleagues resign with him. Thus punitive responsibility\r\nhas been replaced by political responsibility, and separate has been\r\nenlarged to joint responsibility.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The King must Follow the Advice of Ministers;]\r\n\r\nThe ministers, being responsible to Parliament for all the acts of the\r\nCrown, are obliged to refrain from things that they cannot justify, and\r\nto insist upon actions which they regard as necessary. In short, the\r\ncabinet must carry out its own policy; and to that policy the Crown must\r\nsubmit. The King may, of course, be able to persuade his ministers to\r\nabandon a policy of which he does not approve, and of his opportunities\r\nfor doing so we shall have more to say later; but if he cannot persuade\r\nthem, and, backed by a majority in Parliament, they insist upon their\r\nviews, he must yield. It is commonly said that he must give his\r\nministers his confidence, but it would be more accurate to say that he\r\nmust follow their advice. With the progress of the parliamentary system\r\nthis custom has grown more and more settled, the ministers assuming\r\ngreater control, and the Crown yielding more readily, not necessarily\r\nfrom any dread of the consequences, but from the force of habit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: or Find Others who will Accept Responsibility.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the older theory of parliamentary government, it was merely\r\nnecessary that the King should have ministers who would accept\r\nresponsibility for his acts; and, therefore, he might disregard their\r\nadvice if he could find others who were willing to adopt his policy, and\r\nassume responsibility for it. Such an alternative is a very remote\r\npossibility in England to-day. It could only be brought about in one of\r\ntwo ways.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it might be brought about by the dismissal of the\r\ncabinet. William IV. was long supposed to have dismissed arbitrarily\r\nLord Melbourne's cabinet in 1834, and for many years his action in so\r\ndoing was freely criticised; but on the publication of the Melbourne\r\nPapers[32:1] it appeared that the Prime Minister himself, meeting with\r\ngreat difficulty in carrying on the government, virtually suggested the\r\ndismissal to the King; and thus the incident was rather in the nature of\r\na resignation than a dismissal. The right to dismiss a ministry,\r\nalthough unquestionably within the legal prerogative of the Crown, seems\r\nto be regarded as one of those powers which the close responsibility of\r\nthe cabinet to the House of Commons has practically made obsolete. As in\r\nthe case of some other powers, however, it is hardly safe to predict\r\nthat it will never be used again, for circumstances might arise in which\r\nit was evident that the ministry and the House of Commons no longer\r\nrepresented the opinion of the country. Before Mr. Gladstone's last\r\nadministration few people would have hesitated to say that the House of\r\nLords would never again venture to reject a bill on which a House of\r\nCommons, fresh from a general election, was thoroughly in earnest, when\r\nthe subject of the bill had been one of the chief issues in that\r\nelection. Yet the Lords rejected the last Home Rule Bill of 1893,\r\nwithout losing popularity by so doing; and in 1906 it destroyed the\r\nEducation Bill. It is conceivable that under similar conditions the\r\nCrown might, by dismissing a ministry, force a dissolution, and appeal\r\nto the electorate. Such an event, though highly improbable, cannot be\r\nsaid to be impossible.\r\n\r\nThe dismissal of a ministry must, of course, be carefully distinguished\r\nfrom the dismissal of an individual minister. This would be done, as in\r\nthe case of Lord Palmerston,--the last of the kind that has\r\noccurred,--at the request of the Premier, and therefore not contrary to,\r\nbut in accordance with, the advice of the person chiefly responsible for\r\nthe acts of the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe other way in which a change of ministry could be brought about by\r\nthe Crown would be by a refusal to consent to some act which the\r\nministry deemed essential to their remaining in office. Some cases of\r\nthe exercise of such a right by the representative of the Crown have\r\ntaken place in the self-governing colonies, but they are not such as are\r\nlikely to occur in England. A request, for example, by the ministry to\r\nbe allowed to dissolve a colonial legislature has on several occasions\r\nbeen refused by the governor, usually on the ground that a general\r\nelection had recently been held, or that there was no important issue\r\npending between the parties which the people could properly be called\r\nupon to decide.[33:1] In England, on the other hand, such a request by a\r\nministry has never been refused since William Pitt in 1784 invented the\r\nprinciple that a government faced by a hostile majority in the House of\r\nCommons may appeal to the electorate instead of resigning; nor is it\r\nprobable that it will be refused, because the rules of political fair\r\nplay are so thoroughly understood among English statesmen that the power\r\nis not likely to be misused for party purposes.\r\n\r\nAn interesting discussion on the right of a colonial governor to reject\r\nthe advice of his ministers was raised in the case of Governor Darling\r\nof Victoria in 1865. The story has been often told. It grew out of a\r\nquarrel between the Assembly and the Legislative Council, which were\r\nboth elective, but happened to be on opposite sides in politics. The\r\nAssembly, wishing to enact a protective tariff, to which a majority of\r\nthe Council was known to be opposed, tacked it to the annual\r\nappropriation bill; and the Council, unable to amend such a bill,\r\nrejected it altogether. Thereupon the Governor, yielding to the pressure\r\nof his ministers, sanctioned the levy of the new duties, the issue of a\r\nloan, and the payment of official salaries, without the authority of any\r\nact regularly passed by both branches of the legislature. For\r\npermitting, on the advice of his ministers, such a violation of law,\r\nGovernor Darling was rebuked, and finally dismissed by the Secretary of\r\nState for the Colonies.[34:1] It is needless to say that no such\r\nsituation has ever arisen, or is likely to arise, in England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Selection of a New Premier.]\r\n\r\nThere is one matter in which the Crown cannot really be bound by the\r\nadvice of ministers, and that is in the selection of a Premier. It would\r\nbe obviously improper, not to say absurd, that the King in the selection\r\nof a new Prime Minister should be obliged to follow the opinion of the\r\nold one who has just resigned in consequence of a change of party in the\r\nHouse of Commons. That Mr. Balfour, for example, should have had the\r\nright to dictate whether Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman or Lord Rosebery\r\nshould be his successor would have been grotesque. There is usually one\r\nrecognised leader of the Opposition, and when that is the case the Crown\r\nmust intrust the formation of the new ministry to him. This was\r\nillustrated in 1880. Mr. Gladstone had, some years before, retired from\r\nthe leadership of the Liberals in Parliament, and the Queen, after their\r\nsuccess at the general election, sent for Lord Hartington, then leading\r\nthem in the House of Commons; but she found that Mr. Gladstone, who had\r\nreally led the party in the country to victory, was the only possible\r\nhead of a Liberal government.[34:2]\r\n\r\nIf the party that has obtained a majority in Parliament has no\r\nrecognised leader, the Crown may intrust the formation of a ministry to\r\nany one of its chief men who is willing to undertake the task; or if, as\r\nis sometimes the case, the parties have become more or less\r\ndisintegrated, so that only a coalition ministry can be formed, the\r\nCrown can send for the head of any one of the various groups. Not to\r\nspeak of earlier days, when the King had more freedom than at present in\r\nthe formation of his cabinets, it happened several times in the reign of\r\nQueen Victoria that the question who should be Prime Minister was\r\ndetermined by her personal choice. In 1852, for example, Lord\r\nAberdeen's coalition cabinet was formed by her desire.[35:1] In 1859 she\r\nselected Lord Palmerston rather than Lord John Russell;[35:2] and in\r\n1868 and 1894, when in each case the existing cabinet lost its head, she\r\nselected the minister who was to succeed, designating in the first case\r\nMr. Disraeli, and in the last Lord Rosebery.[35:3] Such opportunities,\r\nhowever, are likely to be less common in future, for it is altogether\r\nprobable that a party will prefer to choose its own leader rather than\r\nto leave the selection to the Crown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Selection of Other Ministers.]\r\n\r\nThe choice of the other members of the cabinet is a very different\r\nmatter; for although former sovereigns insisted on having a decisive\r\nvoice in the composition of the ministry, it may be said that with\r\nPeel's appointment to office in 1834 the principle was definitely\r\nestablished that the Prime Minister chooses his colleagues, and is\r\nresponsible for their selection.[35:4] The royal authority in this\r\nmatter gave a last dying flicker in the bed-chamber question of 1839,\r\nwhere Peel's clumsiness and the Queen's impetuosity gave rise to a\r\nmisunderstanding. Peel wished to replace some of the ladies attendant on\r\nthe Queen, who were exclusively Whigs, by Conservatives; and the Queen,\r\ngetting the impression that he intended to replace them all,\r\nrefused.[35:5] When Peel came into office two years later part of the\r\nWhig ladies retired and were replaced; and it has since been settled\r\nthat the Mistress of the Robes, like the Gentlemen of the Household,\r\nshall change with the administration, but that the other ladies shall\r\nremain. The Mistress of the Robes, however, must always be a duchess,\r\nand during the last years of the Queen's life it happened that there was\r\nno duchess who was a Liberal.\r\n\r\nAt the present day all persons whose offices are considered political\r\nare appointed in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister. This\r\ndoes not mean that the sovereign may not urge his own views, perhaps\r\nwith success, and on one occasion, at least, the Queen secured, it is\r\nsaid, a place in the cabinet for a former minister whom the incoming\r\nPremier had either forgotten or meant to leave out. It does mean,\r\nhowever, that if the minister insists upon his advice it must be\r\naccepted. More than once, for example, the Queen tried in vain to\r\nexclude from the Foreign Office Lord Palmerston, who was a constant\r\ngrief of mind to her. As Mr. Morley puts it in the chapter, in his \"Life\r\nof Walpole,\" which is understood to express Mr. Gladstone's views upon\r\nthe cabinet, \"Constitutional respect for the Crown would inspire a\r\nnatural regard for the personal wishes of the sovereign in\r\nrecommendations to office, but royal predilections or prejudices will\r\nundoubtedly be less and less able to stand against the Prime Minister's\r\nstrong view of the requirements of the public service.\"[36:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: For what Acts Ministers are Responsible.]\r\n\r\nThe responsibilities of the ministers may be classified as technical and\r\ncomplete. Thus for acts which happen before they come into office, and\r\nwhich they could not possibly have advised, they assume what may be\r\ncalled a technical, or perhaps a nominal, responsibility. A premier is\r\ntechnically responsible for his own selection; but as responsibility of\r\nthat kind means merely the obligation to resign on an adverse vote of\r\nthe House of Commons, and as he would be obliged to do this in any\r\nevent, he assumes no additional responsibility by reason of his own\r\nselection; and the same thing may be said of all acts which happen\r\nbefore the ministers come into power, and which they do not by accepting\r\noffice effectually sanction or condone. They become responsible, for\r\nexample, for the condition of the public departments of which they take\r\ncharge; and yet it may be for the very purpose of changing that\r\ncondition that they were put in office. In other words, there is a\r\ndifference between those things for which they are technically\r\nresponsible but not to blame, and those things which have been done by\r\ntheir advice, and for the consequence of which they may be said to be\r\nmorally or completely responsible. The distinction is unimportant from\r\nthe point of view of the conventions of the constitution, but its\r\npractical consequences are considerable as regards the position of the\r\ncabinet before Parliament and the public. Now the ministers are\r\ncompletely responsible for all political acts done by the Crown during\r\ntheir tenure of office, even those which appear to be most directly the\r\nwork of the sovereign himself. All communications with the\r\nrepresentatives of foreign powers, for example, pass through their\r\nhands. The creation of peers, the granting of honours, are now\r\nunquestionably subject to their advice; and although when King Edward's\r\nlist of coronation honours was announced in 1901, _The Times_ declared\r\nthat the names were the personal choice of the monarch, it took pains to\r\nadd that the constitutional responsibility must, of course, rest with\r\nthe ministers.[37:1]\r\n\r\nIn short, the ministers direct the action of the Crown in all matters\r\nrelating to the government. The King's speech on the opening of\r\nParliament is, of course, written by them; and they prepare any answers\r\nto addresses that may have a political character. All official letters\r\nand reports to the King, and all communications from him, must pass\r\nthrough the hands of one of their number. A letter addressed to the\r\nsovereign as such by a subject, or other private person, passes through\r\nthe office of the Home Secretary; and even peers, who have a\r\nconstitutional right to approach him, must make an appointment for the\r\ninterview through the same office. This does not mean that the Crown may\r\nnot consult any one it pleases. That question came up in relation to\r\nPrince Albert, whom the ministers at first held at arm's length, and\r\nwhose presence at their interviews with the Queen they refused for a\r\ncouple of years to permit, while he, on the other hand, called himself\r\nthe Queen's \"confidential adviser\" and \"permanent minister.\"[38:1]\r\nConfidential adviser he certainly was, but minister he certainly was\r\nnot, because in the nature of things he could not be responsible for her\r\nacts. Mr. Gladstone in his \"Gleanings of Past Years\"[38:2] seems to have\r\ndefined the true position of the Queen and Prince Consort when he said\r\nthat she has a right to take secret counsel with any one, subject only\r\nto the condition that it does not disturb her relation with her\r\nministers. She cannot, as a rule, consult the Opposition, because they\r\nare directly opposed to the ministry; but she can consult any one else,\r\nprovided it does not affect the responsibility of her ministers; that\r\nis, provided that in the end she follows their advice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Public and Private Acts of the Crown.]\r\n\r\nThe ministers are responsible for the public, not the private, acts of\r\nthe Crown; but it is sometimes hard to distinguish between the two.\r\nQueen Victoria, for example, had relatives on many of the thrones of\r\nEurope to whom it was absurd that she should not write private letters;\r\nwhile other crowned heads were constantly writing letters to her on\r\npublic business which they did not intend the ministers to see. The rule\r\nwas, therefore, adopted that all her correspondence with foreign\r\nsovereigns, not her relatives, should pass through the ministers'\r\nhands,--an arrangement which, though a necessary result of English\r\nresponsible government, was galling to the Queen, who was often made to\r\nexpress in her own handwriting opinions quite different from those which\r\nshe really held.[38:3] In domestic matters, also, it is hard to draw the\r\nline between what is public and what is private. The Queen's marriage,\r\nwhich was felt at the time to have a greater political importance than\r\nit would have to-day, was arranged by herself, without consultation with\r\nher ministers, and merely announced to them. On the other hand, when the\r\nPrincess Louise was betrothed to the Marquis of Lorne, Mr. Gladstone\r\nstated in the House of Commons that the marriage with a subject had not\r\nbeen decided upon without the advice of the ministers of the\r\nCrown.[39:1] The risk of a strong infusion of British blood in the veins\r\nof some future occupant of the throne is, it seems, a political matter,\r\nfor which the cabinet must hold itself responsible. But this is not true\r\nof purely social affairs. One of the chief functions of the Crown is\r\nthat connected with its duties as the head of the social life of the\r\ncapital. These duties the Queen virtually abandoned for many years after\r\nher husband's death; but although there were loud complaints on the part\r\nof the public, the question was not regarded as a political one for\r\nwhich the ministers could be called to account.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The King's Name not Brought into Public Controversy.]\r\n\r\nSince the King can do no wrong, he can do neither right nor wrong. He\r\nmust not be praised or blamed for political acts; nor must his ministers\r\nmake public the fact that any decision on a matter of state was actually\r\nmade by him.[39:2] His name must not be brought into political\r\ncontroversy in any way, or his personal wishes referred to in argument,\r\neither within or without Parliament.[39:3] This principle was not fully\r\nrecognized until after the accession of Queen Victoria. At the first\r\nelection of her reign the Tories complained, apparently with reason,\r\nthat the Whigs used her and her name as party weapons,[40:1] and three\r\nyears later we find Wellington referring to the Queen as the head of the\r\nparty opposed to the Conservatives.[40:2] Almost the only public acts\r\nthat can be done by the Crown before the public eye are ceremonies,\r\npublic functions, speeches which have no political character and deeds\r\nof kindness that are above criticism. When the Queen, for example, made\r\nher last visit to Ireland, the public were allowed to understand that it\r\nwas her own suggestion, and the same thing was true of her order\r\nallowing Irish soldiers to wear the shamrock, it being assumed that such\r\nacts could not have a political bearing, and would excite no hostile\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Actual Influence of the Sovereign.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the earlier theory of the constitution the ministers were\r\nthe counsellors of the King. It was for them to advise and for him to\r\ndecide. Now the parts are almost reversed. The King is consulted, but\r\nthe ministers decide. It is commonly said that, with the sovereign,\r\ninfluence has been substituted for power; or as Bagehot puts it in his\r\nown emphatic way, the Crown has \"three rights--the right to be\r\nconsulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn. And a king of\r\ngreat sense and sagacity would want no others.\"[40:3] But after the\r\nadvice and warning have been given the final decision must remain with\r\nthe ministers. It is for them to determine whether their opinion is of\r\nsuch importance that they feel obliged to insist upon it in spite of the\r\nobjections of the King, and if they do he must yield. Bagehot goes on to\r\ndescribe how effective the right to advise may become in the hands of a\r\nsage and experienced monarch, but he admits how small the chance must be\r\nthat the occupant of the throne will possess the qualities needed for\r\nmaking a good use of the right, and adds that the attempt of the\r\nordinary monarch to exercise it would probably do more harm than good.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He is Consulted after a Decision is Reached.]\r\n\r\nHistorians have often observed that the absence of the sovereign from\r\ncabinet meetings, since the accession of the House of Hanover, has been\r\na great factor in the growth of cabinet government. His absence had,\r\nindeed, three distinct effects. It helped to free the individual members\r\nof the cabinet from royal pressure; it made it easier for them to act as\r\na unit in their relations with the monarch; and it tended to remove him\r\nfrom the discussion of public policy until it had been formulated. This\r\nlast point is highly important, and has a bearing upon the influence of\r\nthe King to-day, because it is before the ministers have formed an\r\nopinion that his advice and warning are most effective. It is while some\r\nof them are reluctant and others are hesitating that the weight of his\r\nviews has the best chance of turning the scale. After the matter has\r\nbeen threshed out and an agreement reached the decision is far less\r\nlikely to be reversed, or even seriously modified, by his personal\r\npreferences.\r\n\r\nNow the sovereign is not usually consulted about matters of domestic\r\nlegislation and policy until the opinion of the cabinet has taken shape.\r\nFor although he is informed in general terms of what is done at cabinet\r\nmeetings, and sometimes discusses with a minister the proposed measures\r\nrelating to his department, yet a matter is commonly talked over and\r\nagreed upon by the ministers before it is submitted to him for approval.\r\nIn this way \"the sovereign is brought into contact only with the net\r\nresults of previous inquiry and deliberation,\"[41:1] and the views of\r\nthe cabinet are \"laid before\" him \"and before Parliament, as if they\r\nwere the views of one man.\"[41:2] Queen Victoria tried, indeed, to\r\ninsist upon the right of \"commenting on all proposals before they are\r\nmatured;\"[41:3] but apparently without much success. This was not\r\nequally true, however, of all departments of the government. On the\r\ncontrary, after a long struggle with Lord Palmerston, in which she\r\nsuffered many exasperating rebuffs, the autocratic foreign minister by\r\nhis impulsiveness and lack of perfect candour gave her at last an\r\nadvantage. She succeeded in establishing, by the memorandum of August,\r\n1850, the rule that she must be kept informed of foreign correspondence\r\nand despatches before they were sent, so that foreign matters should be\r\nintact and not already compromised when they were brought to her\r\nattention. Mr. Gladstone has criticised the principles laid down at that\r\ntime because they meant that the comments of the Premier on despatches\r\nwere to be made, not privately to the foreign minister, but after the\r\ndraft had been submitted to the Queen.[42:1] In other words, he\r\ncomplained that the Queen was consulted before the tenor of the despatch\r\nhad been finally settled between the Premier and the foreign minister.\r\nHis criticism seems, therefore, to be levelled at the practice of\r\nconsulting the Crown before the policy has been agreed upon by those who\r\nare responsible for it,[42:2] in this case the Prime Minister and the\r\nForeign Secretary, for despatches are not ordinarily brought before the\r\nfull cabinet for consideration.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity for an exertion of royal influence is much less in those\r\nmatters which are settled in cabinet meeting than in others. In the\r\nformer case the sovereign is not usually consulted until the question\r\nhas been thoroughly discussed, and the cabinet has reached a decision\r\nwhich is the more difficult to change because it is often the result of\r\na compromise, and has, therefore, something of the binding force of an\r\nagreement; whereas, in questions which are not brought directly before\r\nthe cabinet, the Crown when consulted has to overcome only the opinion,\r\nand perhaps the hasty opinion, of one or two ministers. This is true in\r\nsuch matters as the less important foreign relations, ecclesiastical and\r\nother patronage, and the ordinary executive work of the various\r\ndepartments. But herein another difference must be observed. The\r\nexecutive action of the government in domestic affairs is usually\r\nbrought under very close scrutiny by Parliament, and is subjected to a\r\ngalling fire there. Hence the minister, with the volley of questions\r\nlevelled at the Treasury Bench ever before his mind, finds it more\r\ndifficult in these affairs to yield his opinion to that of the monarch\r\nthan he does in the case of foreign negotiations, and of ecclesiastical,\r\njudicial and military patronage, which are not habitually discussed in\r\nParliament.[43:1] It would seem, therefore, that under ordinary\r\ncircumstances the personal influence of the King in political matters is\r\nnot likely to be very effectively asserted outside of foreign affairs,\r\nchurch patronage, and some other appointments to office.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Personal Influence of Queen Victoria.]\r\n\r\nAlthough one can perceive the general limitations upon the personal\r\ninfluence of the monarch imposed by the conditions under which it is\r\nexercised, one can never know how vigorously it is being used at the\r\nmoment; and, indeed, it is difficult to estimate its actual effect\r\nduring any comparatively recent period. There is no use in going back\r\nbeyond the reign of Queen Victoria, to times when the parliamentary\r\nsystem was so imperfectly developed that ministers sometimes gave\r\nindividual and contrary advice to the King;[43:2] and since the Queen\r\ncame to the throne very little has been published which throws light\r\nupon the subject. From the various memoirs and letters of her ministers\r\nalmost everything has been eliminated that bears upon the actual\r\ninfluence she exerted. Nevertheless certain facts appear. There can be\r\nno doubt that the personal opinions of the monarch were deemed of\r\ngreater importance at the time of the Queen's accession than they are\r\nto-day. Of late years, indeed, many popular writers have tended to\r\nneglect the royal influence altogether. With the love of broad\r\ngeneralisation, which is at once valuable and perilous in political\r\nphilosophy, publicists have been in the habit of speaking of the Queen\r\nas a figurehead; but statesmen who have seen the inner life of the\r\ncabinet know that the metaphor is inexact. Mr. Gladstone is reported to\r\nhave said that every treatise on the English government which he had\r\nread failed to estimate her actual influence at its true value; and in\r\nhis \"Gleanings of Past Years\"[44:1] he remarks, \"there is not a doubt\r\nthat the aggregate of direct influence normally exercised by the\r\nsovereign upon the counsels and proceedings of her ministers is\r\nconsiderable in amount, tends to permanence and solidity of action, and\r\nconfers much benefit on the country.\" Perhaps at a later period he might\r\nhave stated this less strongly; and although no final judgment can yet\r\nbe formed, one may venture an estimate of the Queen's influence in the\r\ndifferent branches of the government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In Domestic Policy.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of the Queen's personal preferences in the selection of the\r\nPrime Minister and his colleagues has already been discussed, and it may\r\nbe added that on two or three occasions a cabinet, instead of resigning\r\non a defeat in the Commons, dissolved Parliament in deference to her\r\nwishes;[44:2] but except for this it is hard to find definite traces of\r\nher influence upon the general domestic policy of the country. Yet in\r\nsome departments, at least, of the public service she took a very lively\r\ninterest. At times she was prodigal of suggestions and advice, which\r\nbore, as far as one can see, no positive fruit. She held her opinions\r\nstrongly, expressed them boldly, and was frank in her criticism of\r\nmeasures, but did not succeed apparently in persuading her ministers to\r\nabandon or even to modify them. On more than one occasion she used her\r\npersonal influence over the peers to prevent a disagreement between the\r\nHouses, but this was never done to give effect to her own personal\r\nviews, and in the case of the Irish Church Disestablishment Bill it was\r\ndone to secure the passage of a government measure with which she was\r\nnot herself in sympathy.[45:1] In short her personal influence in\r\ndomestic affairs, either in the form of initiating policy, or of\r\neffecting changes in that of her ministers, seems to have been very\r\nslight. To this statement, however, a couple of exceptions must be made,\r\nwhich relate to the Army and the Church. The Queen, who regarded the\r\nArmy as peculiarly dependent upon the sovereign, procured the\r\nappointment of a royal duke as Commander-in-Chief, and for a time she\r\nresisted successfully all attempts to change the vague relation of that\r\noffice to the Crown,[45:2] although in the end it was made completely\r\nsubordinate to the minister responsible to Parliament.[45:3] In the\r\nmatter of ecclesiastical appointments her opinions were expressed with\r\nstill greater effect, bishops and deans having in several cases been\r\nselected by her, sometimes in preference to candidates proposed by the\r\nPrime Minister.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In Foreign Affairs.]\r\n\r\nBut it was in foreign affairs that the Queen's efforts were most\r\nuntiring, and on the whole most successful, in spite of many\r\ndisappointments. For years she was opposed to Lord Palmerston's\r\naggressive attitude, and while she never effected a radical change of\r\npolicy, she appears at times to have softened it to some extent.[45:4]\r\nThroughout her reign she insisted upon the right to criticise\r\ndespatches, and not infrequently she caused changes to be made in them;\r\nsometimes, as in the European crisis of 1859-1861, by appealing from the\r\nForeign Secretary and the Prime Minister to the cabinet as a\r\nwhole.[46:1] The most famous case is that of the Trent Affair in 1861,\r\nwhere the changes made in a despatch, in accordance with the suggestions\r\nof the Prince Consort a few days before his death, avoided a danger of\r\nserious trouble with the United States. In foreign affairs, therefore,\r\nit is safe to conclude that while the Queen never initiated a policy,\r\nher influence had on several important occasions a perceptible effect in\r\nmodifying the policy of her ministers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes during the Queen's Reign.]\r\n\r\nIn the closing chapter of his biography of the Queen, Mr. Lee says that\r\nher \"personal influence was far greater at the end of her life than at\r\nher accession to the throne. Nevertheless it was a vague intangible\r\nelement in the political sphere, and was far removed from the solid\r\nremnants of personal power which had adhered to the sceptre of her\r\npredecessors.\"[46:2] No doubt her long experience, and the veneration\r\ndue to her age and unblemished character, caused her opinions to be\r\ntreated with growing respect; but there can be no doubt, also, that the\r\npolitical influence of the sovereign faded slowly to a narrower and\r\nfainter ray during her reign. One sees this in Peel's remark at her\r\naccession, that the personal character of a constitutional monarch\r\ncounteracts the levity of ministers and the blasts of democratic\r\npassions.[46:3] One sees it in the great importance attached at that\r\ntime to the persons surrounding the Queen, to the Ladies of the\r\nBedchamber, to the question of her private secretary, and to the\r\nposition of the Prince Consort. The Queen herself seems to have held\r\nviews about her own position that were drawn from the past rather than\r\nthe present.[46:4] At least this is the impression one forms, and it is\r\nfortified both by her defence of her seclusion in 1864, on the ground\r\nthat she had higher duties to discharge which she could not neglect\r\nwithout injury to the public service; and by her complaint that some of\r\nher ministers did not allow her time enough to consider and decide\r\npublic questions, when in reality the decision was not made by her at\r\nall. The Crown has been compared to a wheel turning inside the engine of\r\nstate with great rapidity, but producing little effect because\r\nunconnected with the rest of the machinery. This is, no doubt, an\r\nexaggeration; but the actual influence of Queen Victoria upon the course\r\nof political events was small as compared with the great industry and\r\nactivity she displayed. What the influence of the sovereign will be in\r\nthe future cannot be foretold with precision. It must depend largely\r\nupon the insight, the tact, the skill, the industry and the popularity\r\nof the monarch himself; and as regards any one department, upon his\r\ninterest in that department. The monarch is not likely to be inured to a\r\nlife of strenuous work, and yet in addition to the political routine,\r\nwhich is by no means small, his duties, social and ceremonial, are\r\ngreat. Moreover, with the highest qualifications for the throne, his\r\nopportunities must be very limited, for there is certainly no reason to\r\nexpect any growth in irresponsible political authority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Utility of the Monarchy; as a Political Force.]\r\n\r\nBagehot's views upon the utility of the monarchy have become classic.\r\nRecognising the small chance that an hereditary sovereign would possess\r\nthe qualities necessary to exert any great influence for good upon\r\npolitical questions, he did not deem the Crown of great value as a part\r\nof the machinery of the state; and he explained at some length how a\r\nparliamentary system of government could be made to work perfectly well\r\nin a republic, although up to that time such an experiment had never\r\nbeen tried. But he thought the Crown of the highest importance in\r\nEngland as the dignified part of the government. Writing shortly before\r\nthe Reform Bill of 1867, he dreaded the extension of democracy in Great\r\nBritain, for he had a low opinion of the political capacity of the\r\nEnglish masses. He felt that the good government of the country depended\r\nupon their remaining in a deferential attitude towards the classes\r\nfitted by nature to rule the state, and he regarded the Crown as one of\r\nthe strongest elements in keeping up that deferential attitude.\r\nAccording to his conception of English polity the lower classes believed\r\nthat the government was conducted by the Queen, whom they revered, while\r\nthe cabinet, unseen and unknown by the ignorant multitude, was thereby\r\nenabled to carry on a system which would be in danger of collapsing if\r\nthe public thoroughly understood its real nature. Whatever may have been\r\nthe case when Bagehot wrote, this state of things is certainly not true\r\nto-day. The English masses have more political intelligence than he\r\nsupposed, or more political education than when he wrote. A traveller in\r\nEngland does not meet to-day people who think that the country is\r\ngoverned by the King, nor does he find any ignorance about the cabinet,\r\nor any illusions about the part played by the chief leaders in\r\nParliament. The English workingman is now bombarded from the platform,\r\nin the newspapers and in political leaflets, with electioneering appeals\r\nwhich do not refer to the King, but discuss unceasingly the party\r\nleaders and their doings. The political action of the Crown is, in fact,\r\nless present to men's minds than it was half a century ago. Mr. Lee\r\ntells us that he was impressed by the outspoken criticism of the Queen's\r\nactions in the early and middle years of her reign.[48:1] To-day the\r\nsocial and ceremonial functions of the Crown attract quite as much\r\ninterest as ever; but as a political organ it has receded into the\r\nbackground, and occupies less public attention than it did formerly. The\r\nstranger can hardly fail to note how rarely he hears the name of the\r\nsovereign mentioned in connection with political matters; and when he\r\ndoes hear it the reference is only too apt to be made by way of\r\ncomplaint. If the foreign policy is unpopular, if there is delay in the\r\nformation of a cabinet, one may hear utterly unfounded rumours\r\nattributing the blame to the King. Even if a committee of inquiry is\r\nthought not to have probed some matter to the bottom, it is perhaps\r\nwhispered that persons in favour at court are involved. Fortunately such\r\nreports are uncommon. In general the growth of the doctrine of royal\r\nirresponsibility has removed the Crown farther and farther out of the\r\npublic sight, while the spread of democracy has made the masses more and\r\nmore familiar with the actual forces in public life. One may dismiss,\r\ntherefore, the idea that the Crown has any perceptible effect to-day in\r\nsecuring the loyalty of the English people, or their obedience to the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the government of England is inconceivable without\r\nthe parliamentary system, and no one has yet devised a method of working\r\nthat system without a central figure, powerless, no doubt, but beyond\r\nthe reach of party strife. European countries that had no kings have\r\nfelt constrained to adopt monarchs who might hold a sceptre which they\r\ncould not wield; and one nation, disliking kings, has been forced to set\r\nup a president with most of the attributes of royalty except the title.\r\nIf the English Crown is no longer the motive power of the ship of state,\r\nit is the spar on which the sail is bent, and as such it is not only a\r\nuseful but an essential part of the vessel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: As a Social and Moral Force.]\r\n\r\nThe social and ceremonial duties of the Crown are now its most\r\nconspicuous, if not its most important, functions. There can be no\r\nquestion that the influence of the Queen and her court was a powerful\r\nelement in the movement that raised the moral tone of society during the\r\nfirst half of the last century. But such an influence must vary with the\r\npersonal character of the monarch. It may be exerted for good or for\r\nevil; and it may not be so strong in the future as it has been in the\r\npast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: As a Pageant.]\r\n\r\nIn its relation to the masses royalty may be considered in another\r\naspect. Within a generation there has been a great growth of interest in\r\nceremony and dress. Antiquated customs and costumes have been revived,\r\nand matters of this kind are regarded by many people as of prime\r\nimportance. A kindred result of the same social force has been a marked\r\nincrease in what Bagehot called the spirit of deference, and what those\r\nwho dislike it call snobbishness--a tendency by no means confined to the\r\nBritish Isles. All this has exalted the regard for titles and offices,\r\nand enhanced the attractiveness of those who bear them. In prestige the\r\ntitled classes have profited thereby, and although their position is\r\nless and less dependent upon court favour, the royal family has also\r\nprofited directly. The presence of some one of its members is sought at\r\nceremonies of all kinds, whether it be the opening of a new building,\r\nthe inauguration of a charity, or an anniversary celebration at a\r\nuniversity. The attendance of the King on such occasions insures an\r\nextended report in all the newspapers of the country, and is, therefore,\r\na most effective form of advertisement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: As a Symbol.]\r\n\r\nA century or more ago people who had learned nothing from the history of\r\nGreece or Rome, and above all of Venice, were wont to assert that the\r\nsentiment of loyalty requires a person for its object. No one would make\r\nsuch a statement now. No one pretends that the English would be less\r\npatriotic under a republic; and yet with the strengthening conception of\r\nthe British Empire, the importance of the Crown as the symbol of\r\nimperial unity has been more keenly felt. To most countries the visible\r\nsymbol of the state is the flag; but curiously enough there is no\r\nBritish national flag. Different banners are used for different\r\npurposes; the King himself uses the Royal Standard; ships of war carry\r\nat the peak the White Ensign; naval reserve vessels fly the Blue Ensign,\r\nand merchantmen the Red Ensign; while the troops march, and Parliament\r\nmeets, under the Union Jack; and all of these are freely displayed on\r\noccasions of public rejoicing. There is a tendency at the moment to\r\nspeak of the Union Jack as the national flag, but a recent occurrence\r\nwill illustrate how far this is from being justified. A British subject\r\nresiding at Panama had been in the habit of flying the Red Ensign,\r\nuntil one day he hoisted in its place the Union Jack. Now, according to\r\nthe regulations the Jack is displayed from the consulates, and the\r\nBritish consul requested his patriotic fellow-citizen not to use it on\r\nhis private house. The question was finally referred to the British\r\nForeign Office, which in deference to a law of Panama forbidding all\r\nprivate display of alien flags, supported the position of the consul,\r\nbut refrained from expressing any opinion on the right of an English\r\ncitizen to hoist the Union Jack in foreign parts.[51:1] Each of the\r\nself-governing colonies has, moreover, its own flag, which consists of\r\nthe Union Jack with some distinctive emblem upon it. One of the first\r\nacts of the new Commonwealth of Australia was to adopt a separate flag\r\nof this kind. The government held a competition in designs, and some\r\nthirty thousand were presented. From these one was selected which showed\r\nat the same time the connection with the empire and the self-dependence\r\nof the commonwealth. It is the Union Jack with a southern cross and a\r\nsix-pointed star at one end,--a design that seems to have been more\r\nshocking to heraldic than to imperialist sensibilities.\r\n\r\nThe Crown is thus the only visible symbol of the union of the empire,\r\nand this has undoubtedly had no inconsiderable effect upon the reverence\r\nfelt for the throne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Popularity of the Monarchy.]\r\n\r\nWhatever the utility of the Crown may be at the present time, there is\r\nno doubt of its universal popularity. A generation ago, when the Queen,\r\nby her seclusion after the death of Prince Albert, neglected the social\r\nfunctions of the court, a number of people began to have serious doubts\r\non the subject. This was while republican ideals of the earlier type\r\nstill prevailed, and before men had learned that a republic is\r\nessentially a form of government, and not necessarily either better or\r\nworse than other forms. The small republican group in England thought\r\nthe monarchy useless and expensive; but people have now learned that\r\nrepublics are not economical, and that the real cost of maintaining the\r\nthrone is relatively small.[52:1] So that while the benefits derived\r\nfrom the Crown may not be estimated more highly, or admitted more\r\nuniversally than they were at that time, the objections to the monarchy\r\nhave almost entirely disappeared, and there is no republican sentiment\r\nleft to-day either in Parliament or the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27:1] If a person has a claim against the Crown for breach of contract,\r\nor because his property is in its possession, he may bring a Petition of\r\nRight, and the Crown on the advice of the Home Secretary will order the\r\npetition indorsed \"Let right be done,\" when the case proceeds like an\r\nordinary suit.\r\n\r\n[27:2] Anson, II., 4, 5, 42, 43, 278, 279, 476-80. But a servant of the\r\nCrown is not liable on its contracts, for he has made no contract\r\npersonally, and he cannot be compelled to carry out the contracts of the\r\nCrown. Gidley _vs._ Lord Palmerston, 3 B. & B., 284.

It would seem that in\r\nsuch a case the courts might have held that as the King could do no\r\nwrong, the wrongful act, and consequently the possession, was not his;\r\nin other words, that the agency could not be set up as a defence to the\r\nwrongful act.

About the functions of\r\nthe spleen, gentlemen, we know nothing. So much for the spleen.\" It is\r\nwith such feelings that one enters upon the task of writing a chapter\r\nupon the cabinet; although that body has become more and more, decade by\r\ndecade, the motive power of all political action. The fact is that the\r\ncabinet from its very nature can hardly have fixed traditions. In the\r\nfirst place, it has no legal status as an organ of government, but is an\r\ninformal body, unknown to the law, whose business is to bring about a\r\ncooperation among the different forces of the state without interfering\r\nwith their legal independence. Its action must, therefore, be of an\r\ninformal character. Then it meets in secret, and no records of its\r\nproceedings are kept, which would in itself make very difficult the\r\nestablishment and preservation of a tradition. This could, indeed,\r\nhappen only in case of a certain permanence among the members who could\r\nlearn and transmit its practice. But a new cabinet contains under\r\nordinary circumstances none of the members of its predecessor. A\r\nConservative minister knows nothing of the procedure under Liberal\r\nadministrations; and we find even a man of the experience of Sir Robert\r\nPeel asking Sir James Graham about the practice of a Liberal cabinet, of\r\nwhich that statesman--who at this time changed his party every\r\ndecade--had formerly been a member.[53:1] No doubt the mode of\r\ntransacting business varies a good deal from one cabinet to another,\r\ndepending to a great extent upon the personal qualities of the members.\r\nStill, the real nature of the work to be done, and hence the method of\r\ndoing it, have changed during the last half century less in the case of\r\nthe cabinet than of any of the other political organs of the state, and\r\none can observe certain general characteristics that may be noted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nature of the Cabinet.]\r\n\r\nThe conventions of the constitution have limited and regulated the\r\nexercise of all legal powers by the regular organs of the state in such\r\na way as to vest the main authority of the central government--the\r\ndriving and the steering force--in the hands of a body entirely unknown\r\nto the law. The members of the cabinet are now always the holders of\r\npublic offices created by law; but their possession of those offices by\r\nno means determines their activity as members of the cabinet. They have,\r\nindeed, two functions. Individually, as officials, they do the executive\r\nwork of the state and administer its departments; collectively they\r\ndirect the general policy of the government, and this they do\r\nirrespective of their individual authority as officials. Their several\r\nadministrative duties, and their collective functions are quite\r\ndistinct; and may, in the case of a particular person, have little or no\r\nconnection. The Lord Privy Seal, for example, has no administrative\r\nduties whatever; and it is conceivable that the work of other members\r\nmight not come before the cabinet during the whole life of the ministry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Functions of the Cabinet.]\r\n\r\nThe essential function of the cabinet is to coordinate and guide the\r\npolitical action of the different branches of the government, and thus\r\ncreate a consistent policy. Bagehot called it a hyphen that joins, a\r\nbuckle that fastens, the executive and legislative together; and in\r\nanother place he speaks of it as a committee of Parliament chosen to\r\nrule the nation. More strictly, it is a committee of the party that has\r\na majority in the House of Commons. The minority are not represented\r\nupon it; and in this it differs from every other parliamentary\r\ncommittee. The distinction is so obvious to us to-day, we are so\r\naccustomed to government by party wherever popular institutions\r\nprevail, that we are apt to forget the importance of the fact. Party\r\ngovernment as a system has developed comparatively recently; but it has\r\nnow become almost universal. The only exception among democratic\r\ncountries (that is, the only case where the executive body habitually\r\ncontains members of opposing parties) is in Switzerland. Still the\r\nsystem is carried to a greater extent in some countries than in others;\r\nand the amount of power concentrated in the hands of a single party\r\nleader, or a body of party leaders, varies very much. The President of\r\nthe United States, for example, is the representative of a party; but he\r\nrules the nation only in part. The legislature is neither in theory or\r\nin practice under his control; and this is so far true that even when\r\nCongress is of the same party as himself, neither he nor any committee\r\nof the party so controls both executive and legislative that any one\r\nbody can be said to rule the nation. But where the parliamentary system\r\nprevails, the cabinet, virtually combining in its own hands, as it does,\r\nthe legislative and executive authorities, may fairly be said to rule\r\nthe nation; although the degree in which this is true must depend upon\r\nthe extent of its real control over the legislature. Now, although the\r\nlegal power of the executive government is in some respects less in\r\nEngland than in most continental countries, the actual control of the\r\ncabinet over the legislature is greater than anywhere else.\r\n\r\nThe cabinet is selected by the party, not directly, but indirectly, yet\r\nfor that very reason represents it the better. Direct election is apt to\r\nmean strife within the party, resulting in a choice that represents the\r\nviews of one section as opposed to those of another, or else in a\r\ncompromise on colourless persons; while the existing indirect selection\r\nresults practically in taking the men, and all the men, who have forced\r\nthemselves into the front rank of the party and acquired influence in\r\nParliament. The minority of the House of Commons is not represented in\r\nthe cabinet; but the whole of the majority is now habitually\r\nrepresented, all the more prominent leaders from every section of the\r\nparty being admitted. In its essence, therefore, the cabinet is an\r\ninformal but permanent caucus of the parliamentary chiefs of the party\r\nin power--and it must be remembered that the chiefs of the party are all\r\nin Parliament. Its object is to secure the cohesion without which the\r\nparty cannot retain a majority in the House of Commons and remain in\r\npower. The machinery is one of wheels within wheels; the outside ring\r\nconsisting of the party that has a majority in the House of Commons; the\r\nnext ring being the ministry, which contains the men who are most active\r\nwithin that party; and the smallest of all being the cabinet, containing\r\nthe real leaders or chiefs. By this means is secured that unity of party\r\naction which depends upon placing the directing power in the hands of a\r\nbody small enough to agree, and influential enough to control. There\r\nhave, of course, been times when the majority was not sufficiently\r\nhomogeneous to unite in a cabinet; when a ministry of one party has\r\ndepended for its majority upon the support of a detached group holding\r\nthe balance of power. The Peelites in 1850, the Liberal Unionists in\r\n1886, and the Irish Nationalists in 1892 formed groups of this kind; but\r\nsuch a condition of things is in its nature temporary and transitional,\r\nand usually gives place to a coalition ministry, followed by party\r\namalgamation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Formation of the Cabinet.]\r\n\r\nThe statesman sent for by the Crown and intrusted with the formation of\r\na ministry becomes himself the Prime Minister, and selects his\r\ncolleagues. It may be added, also, that he has virtually power to\r\ndismiss a minister; that is, subject to his responsibility to the\r\ncabinet as a whole and to Parliament, he can request the Crown to\r\ndismiss a colleague--a request which the Crown cannot practically\r\nrefuse.[56:1] In the selection of the cabinet his choice is, however,\r\ndecidedly limited both as to persons and offices. In the first place,\r\nall the men still in active public life who served in the last cabinet\r\nof the party have a claim, a very strong claim, to sit in the new\r\ncabinet, and hence it is unusual to discard a man who is willing to\r\nreturn to office.[57:1] This in itself fills a goodly number of the\r\ncabinet positions. Then all the prominent leaders in Parliament, and\r\nespecially in the House of Commons, must be included. In fact, as Mr.\r\nBagehot puts it, the Prime Minister's independent choice extends rather\r\nto the division of the cabinet offices than to the choice of cabinet\r\nministers. Still, he has some latitude in regard to the men whom he will\r\nadmit; especially the younger men, who are appointed to offices in the\r\nministry but not in the cabinet, and this may be a matter of great\r\nmoment. One cannot tell, for example, how different the history of\r\nParliament in the middle of the century might have been had Peel decided\r\nto invite Disraeli to join his ministry in 1841.[57:2] Although the\r\nPrime Minister has by no means a free hand in the selection of his\r\ncolleagues, the task is often extremely difficult and vexatious. It is\r\nlike that of constructing a figure out of blocks which are too numerous\r\nfor the purpose, and which are not of shapes to fit perfectly together;\r\nfor with the selection of the members of the cabinet the difficulties\r\nare by no means over. The distribution of the offices among them may\r\nraise additional problems. One man will take only a particular office,\r\nwhile others may object to serving if he occupies that post. Where\r\nparties are a good deal broken up, or are evenly divided, obstacles like\r\nthese have sometimes prevented the formation of a cabinet altogether;\r\nand there is always some disappointment and consequent discontent on the\r\npart of men who thought themselves sufficiently prominent to be\r\nadmitted to the ministry, and whose chagrin may drive them into an\r\nindependent attitude.\r\n\r\nThere are, indeed, two ways in which an ambitious young member of the\r\nHouse of Commons can render his services indispensable to the Prime\r\nMinister. He must, of course, first get the ear of the House, and make\r\nhimself a power there. Then he may vote regularly with the party whips,\r\nsupport the leaders of his party on all occasions, and speak in their\r\nfavour whenever he can be of use to them. In that case he is likely to\r\nbe regarded as a promising young man of sound principles who can be\r\nrelied upon by his chiefs. Or, he may follow the opposite course of the\r\ncandid friend, criticising and even attacking the leader of his party,\r\nshowing the weak points in his arguments, and the errors in his policy.\r\nIn that case, if the young man has achieved so important a position that\r\nhe cannot be disregarded, he stands a good chance of being given an\r\noffice as a dangerous critic who must be conciliated and attached firmly\r\nto the government. The first of these methods is slower but safer. The\r\nsecond has sometimes been tried with startling success, notably in the\r\ncase of Lord Randolph Churchill; but it has also been tried too\r\nobviously, and without the necessary social or parliamentary influence;\r\nand when it does not succeed it is likely to leave its victim hopelessly\r\nstranded below the gangway.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Increase in Size.]\r\n\r\nThe number of members in the cabinet has varied very much at different\r\ntimes,[58:1] and of late years it has shown a marked tendency to\r\nincrease. William Pitt had only six colleagues. A generation ago the\r\ncabinets contained from a dozen to sixteen members; but they have now\r\nrun up to eighteen or twenty. There are several reasons for the change.\r\nIn the first place, as the sphere of the state activity extends and the\r\ngovernment grows more paternal, the range of affairs that come within\r\nthe action of the cabinet is greater; and hence from time to time there\r\nis need of admitting a representative of some fresh department to its\r\nconsultations. Then, on the political side, the development of the\r\nparliamentary system has made it necessary for the cabinet to have an\r\never stronger and stronger hold upon the House of Commons; and,\r\ntherefore, the different shades of feeling in the party that has a\r\nmajority in that House must be more and more fully represented in the\r\ncabinet. This alone would tend to increase the number of its members;\r\nbut far more important still is the fact that a seat in the cabinet has\r\nbecome the ambition of all the prominent men in Parliament. Consequently\r\nthe desire to be included is very great, and the disappointment\r\ncorrespondingly acute. For these various reasons there is a constant\r\npressure to increase the size of the cabinet. The result is not without\r\nits evils. A score of men cannot discuss and agree on a policy with the\r\nsame readiness as a dozen. There is more danger of delay when action\r\nmust be taken. There is a greater probability of long discussions that\r\nare inconclusive or result in a weak compromise. There is, in short, all\r\nthe lack of administrative efficiency which a larger body always\r\npresents; unless, indeed, that body is virtually guided and controlled\r\nby a small number of its own members. That some recent cabinets have\r\nbeen actually so controlled there can be little doubt; and this must\r\nbecome more and more the case as the cabinet grows larger, if it is to\r\nretain its great suppleness and strength. One sometimes hears of an\r\ninterior junto, or cabinet within the cabinet, that really determines\r\nthe policy. This is undoubtedly an exaggeration; a giving of formal\r\nshape to informal conferences among leaders on special questions, which\r\nhave always taken place; but it appears not improbable that if the\r\ngrowth in the size of the cabinet continues, some such interior nucleus\r\nmay develop which will bear to the cabinet something of the relation\r\nthat the cabinet now bears to the ministry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Offices in the Cabinet.]\r\n\r\nCertain offices always bring their holders into the cabinet. These are\r\nthe positions of First Lord of the Treasury (a post almost invariably\r\nheld either by the Prime Minister himself, or by the leader of the\r\nHouse of Commons if the Prime Minister is a peer and takes some other\r\noffice); Lord Chancellor (a great political as well as judicial office);\r\nthe great English executive offices, those of the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, the five Secretaries of State, and the First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty; and a couple of dignified positions without active\r\nadministrative duties, those of President of the Council and the Lord\r\nPrivy Seal. Certain other officers have been of late years always in the\r\ncabinet; such are the Presidents of the Board of Trade, the Local\r\nGovernment Board, and the Board of Education, and the Chief Secretary\r\nfor Ireland,--except when his nominal superior, the Lord Lieutenant for\r\nIreland, is himself a member. On the other hand, the Secretary for\r\nScotland and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster are usually in the\r\ncabinet; while the President of the Board of Agriculture and the\r\nPostmaster-General are often there; the First Commissioner of Works and\r\nthe Lord Chancellor for Ireland occasionally so. The tendency at the\r\npresent day is certainly in the direction of including the head of every\r\nconsiderable branch of the administration.\r\n\r\nThe counsel of a statesman who was incapacitated for the performance of\r\nsteady administrative work, or unwilling to undertake it, was\r\noccasionally secured in former times by giving him a seat in the cabinet\r\nwithout any office under the Crown. He then became what is known on the\r\ncontinent as a minister without portfolio. The last case of this kind in\r\nEngland was that of Lord John Russell in 1854-1856; but the same object\r\nis practically attained to-day by means of the office of Lord Privy\r\nSeal,[60:1] which involves no real administrative duties, and those of\r\nPresident of the Council,[60:2] and Chancellor of the Duchy of\r\nLancaster, where the duties are very light.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ministers must have Seats in Parliament.]\r\n\r\nAs the continental practice whereby ministers are allowed to address\r\nthe legislature, whether they have seats in it or not, is unknown in\r\nEngland, every member of the cabinet, and indeed of the ministry, must\r\nhave a seat in one or other House of Parliament;[61:1] the last\r\nexception being that of Mr. Gladstone, who held the office of Secretary\r\nof State for the Colonies during the last few months of Sir Robert\r\nPeel's administration in 1846, although he had failed of reelection to\r\nthe House of Commons.[61:2] The reason commonly given for such a\r\nlimitation in the selection of ministers is that otherwise they could\r\nnot be made responsible to Parliament, where they must be present in\r\norder to answer questions, and give information relating to their\r\ndepartments. From the standpoint of Parliament this is perfectly true,\r\nbut the converse is also true. The head of a department sits in the\r\nHouse of Commons quite as much in order to control the House, as in\r\norder that the House may control him. In his chapter on \"Changes of\r\nMinistry,\" Bagehot has shown how defenceless against attack any\r\ndepartment is sure to be without a spokesman in Parliament, and he cites\r\nas a forcible illustration the fate of the first Poor Law\r\nCommission.[61:3] All this applies, of course, only to the House of\r\nCommons, for although the presence of ministers in the House of Lords is\r\na convenience in debate, and an appropriate recognition of the legal\r\nequality of the two chambers, there is no responsibility to be secured\r\nthereby, and it is not the essential means of controlling the action of\r\nthe peers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cabinet System and Administrative Efficiency.]\r\n\r\nThe men who win places in the ministry have usually, although by no\r\nmeans invariably, made their mark in debate. It is a strange assumption\r\nthat a good talker must be a good administrator, and that a strong\r\ngovernment can be formed by parcelling out the offices among the leading\r\ndebaters in the legislative body. At first sight it appears as\r\nirrational as the other corollary of the parliamentary system, that the\r\npublic service is promoted by dismissing an excellent foreign minister,\r\nbecause the House of Commons does not like an unpopular clause in an\r\neducation bill. Any one with a sense of humour can point out the\r\nincongruities in any human organisation, whether it works in practice\r\nwell or ill. But there is, in fact, reason to expect that a leading\r\ndebater will make a good head of a department. Influence is rarely\r\nacquired over a body so permanent as the House of Commons by mere showy\r\neloquence. Real weight there must be based upon a knowledge of men, and\r\na power to master facts and grasp the essential points in a situation.\r\nIt must be based, in other words, upon the qualities most essential to a\r\ngood head of a department in a government where, as in England, the\r\ntechnical knowledge, the traditions, and the orderly conduct of affairs,\r\nare secured by a corps of highly efficient permanent officials. No doubt\r\nall leading debaters do not make good administrators. Sometimes a\r\nminister is negligent or ineffective, and occasionally he is rash. There\r\nare men, also, who have outlived their usefulness, or who were once\r\nthought very promising, and have not fulfilled their promise, but who\r\ncannot be discarded and must be given a post of more or less importance.\r\nThe system works, however, on the whole very well, and supplies to the\r\ngovernment offices a few extraordinary, and many fairly efficient,\r\nchiefs, although it puts some departments under the control of poor\r\nadministrators.\r\n\r\nThe power of creating peers would make it possible to select for the\r\nhead of a department a tried administrator altogether outside of the\r\nparliamentary field. Something like this was attempted in the recent\r\ncase of Lord Milner, who was offered, on Mr. Chamberlain's resignation,\r\nthe post of Secretary of State for the Colonies. Lord Milner was,\r\nindeed, a peer at the time the place was tendered to him, but he had\r\nattended in the House of Lords only to take his seat. He had never\r\nspoken or voted there, and in fact had had no parliamentary career, his\r\nnearest approach to St. Stephens having consisted in standing on one\r\noccasion as a candidate for the House of Commons without success.\r\n\r\nFormerly a statesman regularly began his official life as a\r\nparliamentary under-secretary; and he did not become the head of a\r\ndepartment, or win a seat in the cabinet, until he had in this way\r\nserved his apprenticeship in public administration--a practice which\r\nfurnished both a guarantee of experience and a test of executive\r\ncapacity. Of late years there have been a number of exceptions to this\r\nrule. Mr. Chamberlain, Lord Randolph Churchill, Mr. Morley and Mr.\r\nBirrell, for example, were admitted to the cabinet, and put at the head\r\nof great departments without any previous training in the service of the\r\ngovernment. As a rule, however, the old system is likely to prevail,\r\nbecause it is difficult for a man to make his mark in Parliament unless\r\nhe begins his work there very young; and the exceptions occur only in\r\ncases of men of great ability.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Need of Unity in the Cabinet.]\r\n\r\nIn the earlier part of the century, before the party system had\r\ndeveloped as fully as it has to-day, complete unity in the cabinet was\r\nmuch less necessary than it is now. At that time it was not uncommon to\r\nhave matters, sometimes very important ones, treated as open questions\r\nin the cabinet, and a good deal of discussion has taken place upon the\r\nadvantages and the evils of such a practice.[63:1] Members of the\r\ncabinet occasionally spoke and voted against government measures,\r\nalthough a difference carried to that length was always rare. One even\r\nfinds colleagues in the ministry standing as opposing candidates at an\r\nelection.[63:2] Such occurrences would be impossible to-day, because, as\r\nwill appear more fully when we come to treat of the political parties,\r\nparliamentary government in its present highly developed form requires\r\na very strong cohesion among the members of the majority in the House of\r\nCommons, and, therefore, absolute harmony, or the appearance of harmony,\r\namong their leaders. It is necessary to present a united front to the\r\nOpposition, but if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall\r\nprepare himself for the battle? Any one watching the course of events\r\nduring the early summer of 1903 must have observed how rapidly the\r\nprocess of disintegration went on in the Conservative party while it was\r\nknown that the ministers were at odds over the tariff. Party cohesion,\r\nboth in the House and in the cabinet, is, indeed, an essential feature\r\nof the parliamentary system; but since men, however united on general\r\nprinciples, do not by nature think alike in all things, differences of\r\nopinion must constantly arise within the cabinet itself.[64:1] Sometimes\r\nthey are pushed so far that they can be settled only by a division or\r\nvote, but this is exceptional, for the object of the members is, if\r\npossible, to agree, not to obtain a majority of voices and override the\r\nrest.[64:2] The work of every cabinet must, therefore, involve a series\r\nof compromises and concessions, the more so because the members\r\nrepresent the varying shades of opinion comprised in the party in power.\r\nA minister who belongs to one wing of the party may, in fact, be more\r\nnearly in accord with a member of the front Opposition Bench than with\r\nsome colleague who stands at the other political pole of opinion, and\r\nyet he will stay in the cabinet unless the measures proposed are such\r\nthat he feels conscientiously obliged to resign. So long as he remains\r\nin the government he will attempt to agree with his colleagues, but when\r\nhe has finally left them his personal opinions will take full course,\r\nand he may go off at a tangent. In this way the behaviour of an\r\nex-minister towards his former colleagues, which is sometimes attributed\r\nto rancour, may very well be due to a natural expansion of opinions\r\nwhich were held in check while he clung to the cabinet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Need of Secrecy.]\r\n\r\nMen engaged in a common cause who come together for the purpose of\r\nreaching an agreement usually succeed, provided their differences of\r\nopinion are not made public. But without secrecy harmony of views is\r\nwell-nigh unattainable; for if the contradictory opinions held by\r\nmembers of the cabinet were once made public it would be impossible\r\nafterwards to make the concessions necessary to a compromise, without\r\nthe loss of public reputation for consistency and force of character.\r\nMoreover a knowledge of the initial divergence of views among the\r\nministers would vastly increase the difficulty of rallying the whole\r\nparty in support of the policy finally adopted, and would offer\r\nvulnerable points to the attacks of the Opposition. Secrecy is,\r\ntherefore, an essential part of the parliamentary system, and hence it\r\nis the habit, while making public the fact that a meeting of the cabinet\r\nhas taken place, and the names of the members present, to give no\r\nstatement of the business transacted. Not only is no official notice of\r\nthe proceedings published, but it is no less important that they should\r\nnot be in any way divulged. In fact, by a well-recognised custom, it is\r\nhighly improper to refer in Parliament, or elsewhere, to what has been\r\nsaid or done at meetings of the cabinet, although reticence must at\r\ntimes place certain members in a very uncomfortable position.[65:1]\r\nOccasionally it becomes well-nigh intolerable. This is true where a\r\ncabinet breaks up owing to dissensions over an issue that excites keen\r\npublic interest, and in such cases the story of what happened may be\r\ntold in a way that would be thought inexcusable under other\r\ncircumstances.[66:1]\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the great public interest that attaches to the\r\ndecisions of the cabinet, and the great value that premature information\r\nwould have for journalists and speculators, it is astonishing how little\r\ncabinet secrets have leaked out. In curious contrast with this are the\r\nreports of select committees of Parliament, the contents of which are\r\noften known before the report is made,[66:2] probably in most cases not\r\nfrom any deliberate disclosure, but as a result of the piecing together\r\nof small bits of information, no one of which alone would seem to be a\r\nbetrayal of confidence. The reason this does not happen in the case of\r\ncabinets is no doubt to be sought in the complete reliance of the\r\nmembers upon one another, and their disbelief in the statements of any\r\none who pretends to have obtained information from a colleague. The best\r\nproof of the real silence of ministers is found in the fact that\r\nalthough on two or three occasions the press has been remarkably shrewd\r\nin guessing at probable decisions, members of the cabinet have seldom\r\nbeen guilty of talking indiscreetly. The one or two instances where it\r\nis alleged to have occurred have, indeed, acquired the sort of notoriety\r\nof exceptions that prove the rule.[66:3]\r\n\r\nAt one time, it seems, before the reign of Queen Victoria, minutes of\r\ncabinet meetings were kept, showing the opinions held, with the reasons\r\ngiven therefor, and these were transmitted to the King.[67:1] Even as\r\nlate as 1855 regular cabinet dinners took place, marked by the possible\r\nconvenience that no reports of the topics of discussion were sent to the\r\nsovereign, as in the case of more formal meetings.[67:2] At the present\r\nday he receives only a general statement of the matters discussed, with\r\nformal minutes of decisions that require his approval; and it would be\r\nconsidered improper to inform him of the conflicting opinions held by\r\nthe different ministers.[67:3] In fact no records of the cabinet are\r\nkept. This results in occasional differences of recollection on the\r\nquestion whether a definite conclusion was reached on certain matters or\r\nnot; but possible difficulties of that kind are probably of far less\r\nconsequence than the facility in compromising differences of opinion and\r\nreaching a harmonious conclusion that comes from the entire informality\r\nof the proceedings. So little formal, indeed, are the meetings that a\r\nperson not a member of the cabinet is occasionally brought in for\r\nconsultation. This occurred in 1848, for example, when the Duke of\r\nWellington attended a Liberal cabinet to give advice upon measures to be\r\ntaken in view of the danger of the Chartist riots.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Times of Meeting.]\r\n\r\nIt is an old practice, and obviously a necessary one, to hold one or\r\nmore meetings of the cabinet in the autumn to consider the measures to\r\nbe presented to Parliament during the coming session; to arrange, as it\r\nwere, the government's parliamentary programme. Other meetings are held\r\nfrom time to time whenever necessary; sometimes as often as once a week\r\nduring the session; occasionally even more frequently when urgent and\r\ndifficult matters are to be decided. After the session of Parliament\r\ncomes to an end in August, the ministers usually take their vacation in\r\ntravel, sport, or public speaking; and cabinet meetings are suspended\r\nunless political questions of a pressing nature arise.\r\n\r\nIn the rare cases where the cabinet is obliged to settle its policy by\r\nthe crude method of a division or vote, the voices of its members count\r\nalike; but questions are usually decided by preponderance of opinion,\r\nnot by votes; and the weight of the opinions of the ministers is\r\nnaturally very unequal. Such a difference must be particularly marked in\r\nthe large cabinets of the present day; and some of the members must be\r\nperfectly well aware that they are expected to follow rather than to\r\nlead. The relative influence of the different ministers over their\r\ncolleagues, both at the cabinet meetings and elsewhere, depends, of\r\ncourse, primarily upon their personal qualities; although the post\r\noccupied is, in some cases, not without importance. This is particularly\r\ntrue in the case of the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Prime Minister.]\r\n\r\nUntil 1906 the Prime Minister, like the cabinet itself, was unknown to\r\nthe law,[68:1] but the position has long been one of large though\r\nsomewhat ill-defined authority. It has grown with the growth of the\r\ncabinet itself; and, indeed, the administrations of the great Prime\r\nMinisters, such as Walpole, Pitt and Peel, are landmarks in the\r\nevolution of the system.[68:2] We have, fortunately, from two of the\r\nchief Prime Ministers in the latter half of the nineteenth century,\r\ndescriptions both of the cabinet and the premiership, which are\r\nauthoritative;[68:3] and although they do not add a great deal to what\r\nis popularly known, they enable us to state it with greater confidence.\r\n\r\nAt the meetings of the cabinet the Prime Minister as chairman is no\r\ndoubt merely _primus inter pares_. His opinion carries peculiar weight\r\nwith his colleagues mainly by the force it derives from his character,\r\nability, experience and reputation; but apart from cabinet meetings he\r\nhas an authority that is real, though not always the same or easy to\r\ndefine.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the Prime Minister has a considerable patronage at\r\nhis disposal. Subject to the limitations imposed by political\r\nexigencies, he virtually appoints all the members of the ministry. The\r\necclesiastical offices also, from the bishoprics to the larger livings\r\nin the gift of the Crown, are bestowed on his recommendation; and so as\r\na rule are peerages and other honours; and he has a general presumptive\r\nright to nominate to any new office that is established under the\r\nCrown.[69:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Supervision.]\r\n\r\nHe is both an official channel of communication and an informal\r\nmediator. The duties of the Prime Minister, if one may use the\r\nexpression, surround the cabinet. He stands in a sense between it and\r\nall the other forces in the state with which it may come into contact,\r\nand he even stands between it and its own members. Matters of\r\nexceptional importance ought to be brought to his attention before they\r\nare discussed in the cabinet; and any differences that may arise between\r\nany two ministers, or the departments over which they preside, should be\r\nsubmitted to him for decision, subject, of course, to a possible appeal\r\nto the cabinet. He is supposed to exercise a general supervision over\r\nall the departments. Nothing of moment that relates to the general\r\npolicy of the government, or that may affect seriously the efficiency of\r\nthe service, ought to be transacted without his advice. He has a right\r\nto expect, for example, to be consulted about the filling of the highest\r\nposts in the permanent civil service.[69:2] All this is true of every\r\nbranch of the government, but the foreign relations of the country are\r\nsubject to his oversight in a peculiar degree, for he is supposed to\r\nsee all the important despatches before they are sent, and be kept\r\nconstantly informed by the Foreign Secretary of the state of relations\r\nwith other powers.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which a Prime Minister actually supervises and controls\r\nthe several departments must, of course, vary in different cabinets. One\r\ncannot read the memoirs of Sir Robert Peel without seeing how closely he\r\nwatched, and how much he guided, every department of the\r\ngovernment.[70:1] A score of years later we find Lord Palmerston\r\nlamenting that when able men fill every post it is impossible for the\r\nPrime Minister to exercise the same decisive influence on public\r\npolicy;[70:2] and recently Lord Rosebery has told us that owing to the\r\nwidening of the activity of the government no Premier could, at the\r\npresent day, exert the control that Peel had over the various branches\r\nof the public service.[70:3] It is certain that a Prime Minister cannot\r\nmaintain such a control if his time is taken up by the conduct of a\r\nspecial department; and this, combined with some natural recklessness in\r\nspeech, accounts for the strange ignorance that Lord Salisbury displayed\r\nat times about the details of administration, as in the case when he\r\nexcused the lack of military preparation for the South African War on\r\nthe ground that the Boers had misled the British War Office by smuggling\r\nguns into the country in locomotives and munitions of war in\r\npianos.[70:4] It has been usual, therefore, for the Prime Minister to\r\ntake the office of First Lord of the Treasury, which involves very\r\nlittle administrative work, and leaves its occupant free for his more\r\ngeneral duties.[70:5]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He Represents the Cabinet.]\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister stands between the Crown and the cabinet; for\r\nalthough the King may, and sometimes does, communicate with a minister\r\nabout the affairs relating to his own department, it is the Premier who\r\nacts as the connecting link with the cabinet as a whole, and\r\ncommunicates to him their collective opinion. To such an extent is he\r\nthe representative of the cabinet in its relations to the Crown that\r\nwhereas the resignation of any other minister creates only a vacancy,\r\nthe resignation of a Premier dissolves the cabinet altogether; and even\r\nwhen his successor is selected from among his former colleagues, and not\r\nanother change is made, yet the loss of the Premier involves technically\r\nthe formation of a new cabinet.\r\n\r\nUnless the Prime Minister is a peer he represents the cabinet as a whole\r\nin the House of Commons, making there any statements of a general\r\nnature, such as relate, for example, to the amount of time the\r\ngovernment will need for its measures, or to the question of what bills\r\nit will proceed with, and how far the lack of time will compel it to\r\nabandon the rest. The other ministers usually speak only about matters\r\nin which they are directly concerned. They defend the appropriations,\r\nexplain the measures, and answer the questions relating to their own\r\ndepartments; but they do not ordinarily take any active part in the\r\ndiscussion of other subjects, unless a debate lasts for two or three\r\ndays, when one or more of them may be needed. They are, indeed, often so\r\nbusy in their own rooms at the House that it is not uncommon, when a\r\ngovernment measure of second-rate importance is in progress, to see the\r\nTreasury Bench entirely deserted except for the minister in charge of\r\nthe bill. But the Prime Minister must keep a careful watch on the\r\nprogress of all government measures; and he is expected to speak not\r\nonly on all general questions, but on all the most important government\r\nbills. He can do this, of course, only in the House of which he happens\r\nto be a member; and the strength of his all-pervading influence upon the\r\ngovernment depends to no slight extent upon the question whether he\r\nsits in the Lords or the Commons.\r\n\r\nAs the House of Commons is the place where the great battles of the\r\nparties are fought, a Prime Minister who is a peer is in something of\r\nthe position of a commander-in-chief who is not present with the forces\r\nin the field. He must send his directions from afar, and trust a\r\nlieutenant to carry them out. In such a case the leader of the House of\r\nCommons stands in something of the position of a deputy premier. He is,\r\nof necessity, constantly consulted by his colleagues in the House, and\r\nhe can, if so disposed, draw into his own hands a part of the authority\r\nbelonging to the head of the cabinet. As Mr. Gladstone remarked, \"The\r\noverweight, again, of the House of Commons is apt, other things being\r\nequal, to bring its Leader inconveniently near in power to a Prime\r\nMinister who is a peer. He can play off the House of Commons against his\r\nchief; and instances might be cited, though they are happily most rare,\r\nwhen he has served him very ugly tricks.\"[72:1] It is certainly true\r\nthat the Prime Ministers who have most dominated their cabinets, and\r\nhave had their administrations most fully under their control, have all\r\nbeen in the Commons. It may be added that a high authority has declared\r\nthat \"no administrations are so successful as those where the distance\r\nin parliamentary authority, party influence, and popular position,\r\nbetween the Prime Minister and his colleagues in the cabinet, is wide,\r\nrecognised and decisive.\"[72:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation of the Ministers to One Another.]\r\n\r\nNot only does the Prime Minister stand above and apart from his\r\ncolleagues, but they do not all stand upon one plane. The influence of a\r\nminister depends upon his personal force, but it may be affected by the\r\noffice that he holds, and perhaps by his nearness to the Prime Minister\r\nhimself; for although there is no formal interior junta, or cabinet\r\nwithin the cabinet, yet the Premier is apt to take counsel informally\r\nwith other leading ministers, and if he is a masterful man those who\r\ncan command or win his confidence have the better chance of shaping the\r\npolicy of the government while it is still formless and malleable. The\r\ncabinet, moreover, does not always act as a whole. It sometimes appoints\r\ncommittees to consider special subjects, and indeed it has an old and\r\nwell-established practice of appointing committees to prepare important\r\ngovernment bills.[73:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joint and Several Responsibility.]\r\n\r\nIt is commonly said that the ministers are severally responsible to\r\nParliament for the conduct of their own departments, and jointly\r\nresponsible for the general policy of the government. Like many other\r\nmaxims of the British Constitution, this has the advantage of being\r\nsufficiently vague to be capable of different interpretations at\r\ndifferent times. With the growth of the parliamentary system, and the\r\nmore clearly marked opposition between the parties, the joint\r\nresponsibility has in fact become greater and the several responsibility\r\nless. The last instances where a single minister resigned on an adverse\r\nvote of the House of Commons were those of Mr. Lowe, who retired from\r\nthe vice-presidency of the Committee on Education in 1864 in consequence\r\nof a vote charging him with improper mutilation of the reports of\r\ninspectors, and Lord Chancellor Westbury, who resigned in 1866 on\r\naccount of a vote censuring his grant of a pension to a registrar in\r\nbankruptcy charged with misconduct.[73:2] If at the present day the\r\ncause of complaint were a personal error on the part of the minister, he\r\nwould probably be brought to resign voluntarily before there was a\r\nchance of his resignation being forced by a hostile vote in the House;\r\nand if the question were one of policy, the government would, save in\r\nvery exceptional cases, assume the responsibility for that policy,\r\ntreating a hostile vote as showing a want of confidence in itself. The\r\nmajority in the House of Commons, on the other hand, while it may\r\nquestion, criticise and blame a minister in debate, is reluctant to\r\npermit a vote of censure upon him which is liable to involve the fall of\r\nthe ministry.[74:1]\r\n\r\nEach minister is responsible to the cabinet for the conduct of his\r\ndepartment. He is constantly meeting with problems which may involve\r\ncriticism in Parliament, and where a mistake might entail serious\r\nconsequences for the whole government. In such cases he must decide how\r\nfar he can assume to settle the question in accordance with his own\r\nopinion, and what matters he ought to bring before the cabinet. He must\r\nnot, on the one hand, take up its time in discussing trivialities, and\r\nhe must not, on the other, commit his colleagues to a course of action\r\nwhich really involves general policy. If in doubt he can, of course,\r\nconsult the Prime Minister; but in spite of this privilege annoying\r\nblunders must inevitably occur.\r\n\r\nA minister naturally has charge in the cabinet of the business relating\r\nto his own department, but how far he takes an active part in other\r\nthings will depend upon the interest that he feels in them. Lord\r\nPalmerston, for example, when Secretary for Foreign Affairs, took, as\r\nhis letters show, little interest in anything else; but when he became\r\nHome Secretary he took not only an active but a leading part in\r\ndirecting the foreign relations of the country. This he was fully\r\nentitled to do, because the cabinet is both an assemblage of ministers\r\nat the head of the separate branches of the administration, and a\r\ncouncil of state which must form a collective judgment upon the\r\nquestions submitted to it. A minister is, therefore, justified in\r\npressing his views on any subject, whether connected with his own\r\ndepartment or not; and on no other basis could collective responsibility\r\nbe maintained. The practice is particularly marked in the case of\r\nforeign affairs, which usually form a large part of the business at the\r\nmeetings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Treasury and Other Departments.]\r\n\r\nIt is not only on questions of general policy, brought before the\r\ncabinet, that differences of opinion between ministers may arise, for\r\nthere are many matters of current administration that affect more than\r\none department. In such cases the ministers concerned confer together,\r\nand if they cannot agree their differences must be submitted to the\r\nPrime Minister, and ultimately to the cabinet. There is, indeed, one\r\ndepartment which is continually brought into contact--one might almost\r\nsay conflict--with all the others; that is the Treasury. Any vigorous\r\nbranch of the public service always sees excellent reasons for\r\nincreasing its expenditure, and proposes to do so without much regard\r\nfor the needs of the other branches; while the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, who is obliged to find the money, must strive to restrict the\r\naggregate outlay. If he did not, the expenditure of the government would\r\ncertainly be extravagant. As a preliminary step to the preparation of\r\nthe budget the Treasury issues in the autumn a circular to the other\r\ndepartments asking for estimates of their expenses during the coming\r\nfiscal year. These are made up in the first instance by the permanent\r\nofficials, and then laid before the parliamentary head of the\r\ndepartment, who revises and perhaps reduces them. When they reach the\r\nTreasury they are scrutinised by the permanent officials there, and if\r\nanything is not clear, an explanation is sought from the department\r\nconcerned. The estimates are then submitted by the Treasury officials to\r\ntheir parliamentary chiefs, and if there is an objection to any item it\r\nis the duty of the Financial Secretary of the Treasury to confer with\r\nthe head of the department whose estimates are in question.[75:1] If the\r\nparliamentary head of the department does not agree with the Financial\r\nSecretary he may go to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and if they\r\ncannot settle the matter they must appeal to the Prime Minister and as\r\na last resort to the cabinet. Being placed in such a relation to his\r\ncolleagues, it is not unnatural that the Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nshould often differ with them. As Gladstone notes in his diary in 1865,\r\n\"Estimates always settled at the dagger's point.\"[76:1] Like other\r\ndifferences in the cabinet, these occasionally come to light, especially\r\nwhen they have been so sharp as to cause the Chancellor's resignation.\r\nLord Randolph Churchill resigned in 1886 because the cabinet insisted\r\nupon appropriations for the Army which he opposed; and Sir Michael\r\nHicks-Beach has told us recently that had it not been for the fact that\r\nhis protests against the growth of expenditure were received with\r\nindifference he might not have quitted the office.[76:2] One cause,\r\nmoreover, of the final resignation of Mr. Gladstone--who although not\r\nthen Chancellor of the Exchequer, always looked upon matters from the\r\nTreasury standpoint--was a difference of opinion between him and his\r\ncolleagues on the question of the cost of national defence.[76:3]\r\n\r\nWhatever the policy of the cabinet at any moment may be, the scale of\r\nexpenditure is ultimately determined by the feeling in the House of\r\nCommons, and this in turn depends upon the state of public opinion.\r\nExcept for a few short periods of extravagance, the seventy years that\r\nfollowed the close of the Napoleonic wars were marked by a decided\r\ntendency in favour of economy. People felt the pressure of taxation,\r\nworried little about the condition of the Army or the Navy, and had no\r\nstrong desire to increase the expenses of the government in any\r\ndirection. Latterly the tendency has been reversed. The country has felt\r\nrich; there have been a series of alarms about national defence, and at\r\nthe same time the general growth of paternalism has brought in a desire\r\nfor improvement and expenditure in many ways.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cabinet and the Ministry.]\r\n\r\nThe ministry is composed, as has already been pointed out, of an inner\r\npart that formulates the policy of the government, and an outer part\r\nthat follows the lines laid down; the inner part, or cabinet, containing\r\nthe more prominent party leaders, who are also holders of the principal\r\noffices of state, while the outer part consists of the heads of the less\r\nimportant departments, the parliamentary under-secretaries, the whips\r\nand the officers of the royal household. All of these persons are\r\nstrictly in the ministry, and resign with the cabinet; but the officers\r\nof the household have, as such, no political functions, and do not\r\nconcern us here. The heads of departments without seats in the cabinet\r\nhave become, with the increase in size of that body, very few. By far\r\nthe greater part of the ministers outside of the cabinet are the\r\nparliamentary under-secretaries, who have two distinct sets of duties,\r\none administrative and the other parliamentary. Their administrative\r\nduties vary very largely, mainly in accordance with personal\r\nconsiderations. Some of them are really active in their departments,\r\ndoing work which might fall upon the parliamentary chief, or upon the\r\npermanent under-secretary, while others have little or no administrative\r\nbusiness; but in any case the real object of their existence is to be\r\nfound on the parliamentary side. Whatever duties, parliamentary or\r\nadministrative, may be assigned to an under-secretary, he is strictly\r\nsubordinate to his chief, who retains both the authority and the\r\nresponsibility for the decision of all questions that arise in the\r\ndepartment;[77:1] although an active under-secretary in the Commons may\r\nsometimes attract more public notice than his real chief in the Lords.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly said that as a minister can speak only in the House of\r\nwhich he is a member, there must be two parliamentary representatives\r\nfor every department, one in each House. This, however, is not strictly\r\ntrue. Going back, for example, over the period of a generation, we find\r\nthat the Foreign, Colonial and Indian Offices have practically always\r\nbeen represented in both Houses.[78:1] The other great departments have,\r\nof course, always been represented in the Commons;[78:2] but the War\r\nOffice and the Admiralty have not always been represented in the Lords.\r\nThe Board of Trade has often, and the Local Government Board and Home\r\nOffice have usually, had no spokesman of their own there;[78:3] while\r\nall the parliamentary officers of the Treasury invariably sit in the\r\nCommons. The system of under-secretaries, therefore, is by no means\r\nalways used in order to give a representative to the department in both\r\nHouses. It not infrequently happens that both, or in the case of the War\r\nOffice and the Admiralty all three, representatives sit in the House of\r\nCommons. An under-secretary, even when he sits with his chief in the\r\nCommons, is, however, a convenience for those departments which have a\r\ngreat deal of business to attend to, and many questions to answer.\r\nMoreover, the large number of under-secretaryships has the advantage\r\nalready noticed of including within the ministry a considerable number\r\nof lesser party lights who have not achieved sufficient prominence to be\r\nincluded in the cabinet, and yet whose interest in the fortunes of the\r\nministry it is wise to secure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cabinet and the Privy Council.]\r\n\r\nOne of the great changes in administrative machinery that has taken\r\nplace in the civilised world within the last two hundred years is the\r\nsubstitution of an informal cabinet composed of the heads of\r\ndepartments, for a formal governing council of members who had\r\nthemselves no direct administrative duties. The form of the old council\r\nhas survived in England under the name of the Privy Council, but its\r\nfunctions have become a shadow. The Privy Council never meets as a whole\r\nnow except for ceremonial purposes. Its action is, indeed, still legally\r\nnecessary for the performance of many acts of state, such as the\r\nadoption of Orders in Council, and the like; but this is a formal\r\nmatter, requiring the presence of only three persons, who follow the\r\ndirections of a minister, for all cabinet ministers are members of the\r\nPrivy Council. The Council does real work to-day only through its\r\ncommittees. Of these the most notable is the Judicial Committee, which\r\nsits as a court of appeal in ecclesiastical and colonial cases, and will\r\nbe more fully described in a later chapter. Other committees, such as\r\nthose on trade and on education, have at times rendered great service to\r\nthe state, but the more important administrative committees have now\r\nbeen transformed into regular departments of the government. It is by no\r\nmeans certain, however, that the Privy Council may not, through its\r\ncommittees, become in the future an organ by means of which important\r\npolitical functions, especially in connection with the growth of the\r\nempire, will be evolved. At present it is mainly an honorary body. Its\r\nmembers are appointed for life, and bear the title of Right Honourable;\r\nand, indeed, of late years membership in the Council has been conferred\r\nas a sort of decoration for services in politics, literature, science,\r\nwar, or administration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Future of the Cabinet.]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was of opinion that the cabinet had \"found its final\r\nshape, attributes, functions, and permanent ordering,\"[79:1] and so far\r\nas its relation to Parliament alone is concerned, this may very well be\r\ntrue; but Parliament is gradually ceasing to be the one final arbiter in\r\npublic life. The cabinet is daily coming into closer contact with the\r\nnation, and what modifications that may entail we cannot foresee. It may\r\nbe observed, however, that while the members of the cabinet present a\r\nunited front, and say the same thing in Parliament, they do not always\r\nsay the same thing to the country. The ministers agree on a policy\r\nbefore announcing it in Parliament, but they are not always in the\r\nhabit of taking counsel together about the speeches that they make upon\r\nthe platform. Mr. Chamberlain's sudden declaration of a policy of\r\npreferential tariffs in his speech at Birmingham in 1903 is only an\r\nextreme example of what sometimes occurs. Absolute unanimity may not,\r\nindeed, prove to be so necessary to the ministers in order to maintain\r\ntheir authority before the people as it is to hold their position in the\r\nHouse of Commons.[80:1] But no serious changes in the structure of the\r\ncabinet are probable so long as parliamentary government continues in\r\nits present form; and it is too early to speculate on the changes that\r\nmay occur if the parliamentary system itself becomes modified under the\r\npressure of political parties acting in a democratic country.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[53:1] Parker, \"Sir Robert Peel,\" III., 496.\r\n\r\n[56:1] This is the opinion of two of the most prominent Prime Ministers\r\nof the century.

Lord Rosebery, who,\r\nafter being Prime Minister in 1895, was left out of the next Liberal\r\ncabinet in 1905, had taken himself out of the field by saying that he\r\ncould not serve in a ministry whose chief held the views on Home Rule\r\nthat Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman had expressed.\r\n\r\n[57:2] _Cf._ Parker, \"Sir Robert Peel,\" II., 486-89; III., 347-48.\r\n\r\n[58:1] Todd, \"Parl.

Bulwer, \"Life of\r\nPalmerston,\" I., 153 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[64:1] One cannot read Mr. Morley's \"Life of Gladstone\" without being\r\nstruck by the frequency of such differences. One feels that in his\r\ntwenty-five years of life in the cabinet Gladstone must have expended\r\nalmost as much effort in making his views prevail with his colleagues as\r\nin forcing them through Parliament.\r\n\r\n[64:2] In Gladstone's cabinet of 1880-1885 the practice of counting\r\nvotes was complained of, as an innovation. Morley, \"Life of Gladstone,\"\r\nIII., 5.\r\n\r\n[65:1] This obligation has been said to rest upon the cabinet minister's\r\noath of secrecy as a privy councillor (Todd, 2 Ed., II., 83-84, 240).\r\nBut this would seem to be another case of confusion between the law and\r\nthe conventions of the constitution. Although the permission of the\r\nsovereign must be obtained before proceedings in the cabinet can be made\r\npublic (_cf._ Hans., 3 Ser. CCCIV., 1182, 1186, 1189), yet in fact the\r\nduty of secrecy is not merely a legal obligation towards the sovereign\r\nwhich he can waive under the advice, for example, of a ministry of the\r\nother party. It is a moral duty towards one's colleagues, which ceases\r\nwhen by lapse of time, or otherwise, the reason for it has been removed;\r\nand the secrets must be kept from other privy councillors, the leaders\r\nof the Opposition for example, as well as from the rest of the world.\r\nSometimes sharp discussions have occurred on the limits of the\r\npermission given to reveal what has taken place at cabinet meetings.\r\nThis occurred after Mr. Chamberlain's resignation in 1886.

The title of an officer\r\noften gives no clear idea of his functions. The most striking case is\r\nthat of the Treasury, whose regular chief, from the time of Henry VIII.\r\nto the death of Anne, was the Lord High Treasurer. Since 1714 the office\r\nhas always been in commission; that is, its duties have been intrusted\r\nto a board composed of a number of Lords of the Treasury. But while the\r\nboard is still regularly constituted by Letters Patent whenever a new\r\nministry is formed, and still retains its legal authority, all political\r\npower has, in fact, passed from its hands. The board never meets, most\r\nof its members have little or no connection with the Treasury, and its\r\nfunctions are really performed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who\r\nis not now a chancellor, and does not control the work of what is more\r\nproperly called the Exchequer. Thus, by a strange process of evolution\r\nthe powers of the Lord High Treasurer have, by law, become vested in a\r\nboard; and by a still later custom they are actually wielded by quite a\r\ndifferent officer, whose title indicates neither his succession to the\r\nTreasurer nor the nature of his present duties.\r\n\r\nAlthough in origin and legal organisation the departments of state are\r\nvery unlike, yet the growth of custom, and the exigencies of\r\nparliamentary life, have, for practical purposes, forced almost all of\r\nthem into something very near one common type. Whatever the legal form\r\nof the authority at their head, the actual control is now in nearly\r\nevery case in the hands of a single responsible minister, usually\r\nassisted by one or more parliamentary subordinates, and supported by a\r\ncorps of permanent non-political officials, who carry on the work of the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Origin of the Departments.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Former Great Offices.]\r\n\r\nThe historical origin of most of the departments may be traced to one of\r\nthree sources: the great offices of an earlier time; the secretariat of\r\nstate; and the more recent boards and commissions. Many of the former\r\noffices of state survive as honorary posts, or with duties connected\r\nsolely with the royal household.[82:1] The only ones that are still in\r\ntouch with public administration are those of the Lord High Chancellor,\r\nwho has retained the greater part of his ancient authority; of the Lord\r\nHigh Treasurer, the transformations of whose office have already been\r\nmentioned; and of the Lord High Admiral, whose powers have also gone\r\ninto commission, and are vested in the Admiralty Board.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Secretariat of State.]\r\n\r\nThe secretariat is an old institution, although the standing of its\r\nmembers has varied much at different times. There are now five\r\nsecretaries of state, but their position is peculiar in this, that they\r\nall share, from a legal point of view, the same office; and except so\r\nfar as statutes have conferred special authority upon one or another,\r\neach of them can perform the duties of all the rest. During the greater\r\npart of the eighteenth century there were two secretaries, one for the\r\nnorthern and the other for the southern department, the former having\r\ncharge of the relations with the northern powers, the latter of those\r\nwith the southern powers together with home and colonial affairs. A\r\nseries of changes made at the end of the century resulted in an increase\r\nof the number of secretaries to three, and a redistribution of their\r\nwork, so that one had charge of foreign relations, another of home\r\naffairs, and the third of war and the colonies. The Crimean War brought\r\nabout in 1854 the separation of the colonial and war departments, with\r\nthe creation of a fourth secretary of state; and, finally, the mutiny in\r\nIndia, and the consequent transfer of the direct government of that\r\ncountry to the Crown, caused the appointment of a fifth secretary of\r\nstate to take charge of Indian affairs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Recent Boards and Commissions.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sham Boards.]\r\n\r\nThe third great source of public departments has been the creation in\r\ncomparatively recent times of a number of administrative boards or\r\ncommissions, whose duties (except in the case of the Board of Works) are\r\nnot primarily executive; that is, they are not concerned mainly with\r\ndirect administration, but rather with the supervision and control of\r\nlocal authorities and of bodies exercising functions of a public or a\r\nquasi-public nature. There are now five boards of this kind, the Board\r\nof Trade, the Local Government Board, the Board of Works, the Board of\r\nAgriculture, and the Board of Education. Some of them, the first and\r\nlast named, for example, have developed from committees of the Privy\r\nCouncil; while others have grown out of administrative commissions which\r\nwere not originally regarded as political, and had no representatives of\r\ntheir own in Parliament. Except in the case of the Board of Trade,[83:1]\r\nboth their organisation and their functions now rest upon\r\nstatutes,[83:2] and in general character they are all very much alike.\r\nEach of them consists of a president,[83:3] of the five secretaries of\r\nstate, and of other high dignitaries, such as the Lord President of the\r\nPrivy Council, the First Lord of the Treasury, or the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, and sometimes, in the case of the older boards, even of the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury and the Speaker of the House of Commons. But\r\nthe board never meets; the president alone constitutes a quorum, and he\r\nconducts the business of the department, with the assistance, in the\r\ncase of the Board of Trade, of the Local Government Board and the Board\r\nof Education, of a secretary who is not himself a member of the board,\r\nbut is, like the president, capable of sitting in the House of Commons,\r\nand occupies, in short, the position of a parliamentary under-secretary.\r\nIn practice, therefore, these boards are legal phantoms that provide\r\nimaginary colleagues for a single responsible minister; and, indeed, the\r\nonly department in the English government conducted by a board that\r\nreally meets for the transaction of business is the Admiralty.[84:1]\r\n\r\nA satirical observer has remarked that the English Constitution is a\r\nbundle of shams; and this is inevitable where law fails to keep pace\r\nwith custom--where the legal organisation has ceased to express the real\r\nworking of the system. But it is difficult to penetrate the motive for\r\ndeliberately constructing a sham; and yet that was done in the creation\r\nof the Board of Agriculture in 1889, and the Board of Education ten\r\nyears later. In the last case the measure was criticised upon this\r\nground;[84:2] and Sir John Gorst in reply said that, as there were other\r\nboards, the general desire of the House was thought to be in favour of a\r\nBoard of Education, and that, although these boards did not often meet,\r\nthey were potential.[84:3] He denied that the Committee of Council on\r\nEducation had never met, and referred to an occasion, about twenty years\r\nearlier, when it had been called together, and actually transacted\r\nbusiness.[84:4] A better statement of the reason, or rather the absence\r\nof any reason, for the creation of a sham board, was made with\r\ncharacteristic frankness by the Duke of Devonshire, who said, \"as far as\r\nI remember, the point was mooted when the bill was first prepared, but I\r\nquite admit that I am unable, at the present moment, to recollect the\r\nreasons which weighed in favour of a board rather than a secretariat. It\r\nhas the advantage, at all events, of numerous precedents, and it is\r\nperfectly well understood that there will be no board at all.\"[85:1]\r\n\r\nIn giving in this chapter a sketch of the executive departments nothing\r\nwill be said of those offices to which no substantial administrative\r\nduties, or none outside of the royal household, are attached. There are\r\nabout a dozen such posts, which are regarded as so far political that\r\ntheir holders retire upon a change of ministry; but they are omitted\r\nhere, because the object is to describe not the offices of state, but\r\nthe different branches of the public service and the distribution of\r\nbusiness among them. Most of the departments require for our purpose\r\nonly a few words, to point out the general nature of their duties and\r\nanything unusual in their structure or method of working. The functions\r\nof some others, such as the Colonial Office, the Local Government Board\r\nand the Board of Education, can be passed over rapidly, because they\r\nwill be treated more fully in the chapters devoted to the subjects under\r\ntheir control; while the Army, the Navy and the Treasury are described\r\nat greater length on account of the peculiarities in their organisation,\r\nand the fact that their work is not dealt with in any other part of the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Foreign Office.]\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Office has at its head a secretary of state, who, like the\r\nchief of every normal department, is supported by a parliamentary\r\nunder-secretary and also by a permanent staff consisting of an\r\nunder-secretary, several assistant under-secretaries--in this instance\r\nthree--besides clerks and other permanent officials. For convenience of\r\nadministration there are in the Foreign Office a number of departments,\r\nthe business being distributed among them partly on a geographical\r\nbasis, and partly according to the nature of the subject.[86:1] The\r\noffice has, of course, charge of foreign relations, controlling for that\r\npurpose the diplomatic representatives and the consuls. The only odd\r\nthing about its duties is the fact that in addition to the ordinary\r\nfunctions of a foreign office it governs certain dependencies of the\r\nCrown. The expansion of European influence over the less favoured\r\nportions of the globe has produced among other new things the\r\n\"protectorate,\" which involves, by a political fiction, an international\r\nas well as a philanthropic relation between the ruler and the ruled. The\r\nresult is that protectorates not closely connected with existing\r\ncolonies are administered by the Foreign Office. This has been true of a\r\nnumber of protectorates in Africa, and notably of Egypt, which is still\r\nnominally ruled by the Khedive under the suzerainty of the Turkish\r\nSultan, but is practically governed by a British agent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Position of the Foreign Secretary.]\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the relations with foreign powers requires from its very\r\nnature a peculiar method of procedure. Much of the work of the Foreign\r\nOffice consists, no doubt, in examining and pushing the private legal\r\nclaims of British subjects, and to some extent work of that kind has a\r\nroutine character. But apart from this there is comparatively little of\r\nthe detailed administration--so common in other departments--which,\r\ninvolving merely the application of settled principles to particular\r\ncases, can be conducted by subordinates without consulting the political\r\nchief. Much of the correspondence with foreign powers may entail serious\r\nconsequences, and hence must ordinarily be laid before the Secretary of\r\nState. The permanent officials play, therefore, a smaller part in the\r\nmanagement of affairs than in most branches of the public service, a\r\nmatter that will be discussed more fully in a subsequent chapter.[87:1]\r\nMoreover, the representatives at foreign courts are kept, by means of\r\nthe telegraph, under more constant instructions than formerly, and it\r\nhas become the habit in all countries to retain diplomatic negotiations\r\nvery closely in the hands of the home government. Even the functions of\r\nforeign envoys as the eyes and ears of the state have declined in\r\nimportance; and it has been observed that as gatherers of political\r\ninformation they have been largely superseded by the correspondents of\r\nthe press.\r\n\r\nAll this has the effect of concentrating the direction of foreign\r\nrelations in the hands of the Secretary of State. At the same time he is\r\nsingularly free from immediate parliamentary control. Diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence is ordinarily confidential, and it is usually a\r\nsufficient answer to any question in Parliament, touching foreign\r\nrelations, to say that the information sought cannot be given without\r\ndetriment to the public service. It follows that the presence of the\r\nminister in the House of Commons is less necessary than in the case of\r\nother departments; while his arduous duties make it hard for him to find\r\nthe time required for attendance at the long sittings. These facts,\r\ncoupled with the strange provision of law which permits only four of the\r\nfive secretaries of state to sit there, resulted in placing peers at the\r\nhead of the Foreign Office continuously from 1868 to 1905, the\r\nunder-secretary alone representing the department in the popular\r\nchamber. But if the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is less under\r\nthe direct control of Parliament than other ministers, he is more under\r\nthe control of his colleagues. We have already seen that every important\r\ndespatch ought to be submitted, before it is sent off, both to the Prime\r\nMinister and to the sovereign; and, as a rule, the telegrams, together\r\nwith correspondence of peculiar interest, are also circulated among all\r\nthe members of the cabinet.[88:1] In fact there is probably no\r\ndepartment where the executive action of the minister is so constantly\r\nbrought to the notice of his colleagues.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Colonial Office.]\r\n\r\nEver since England began to extend her dominion beyond the seas her\r\nforeign relations have been complicated by her distant possessions, and\r\nit is therefore natural to pass from the offices of the Secretary of\r\nState for Foreign Affairs on one side of the doorway in Downing Street\r\nto those of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the other. But it\r\nis needless to speak of the Colonial Office at length here, because the\r\ngovernment of the dependencies will form the subject of later chapters.\r\nThe Secretary of State for the Colonies is assisted by his parliamentary\r\nand permanent under-secretaries, and by a staff of subordinate\r\nofficials. There are in this office four permanent assistant\r\nunder-secretaries; one of whom has charge of questions of law, and also\r\nat present of business connected with Canada, Australasia and a number\r\nof islands; another of South Africa; a third of the East and West\r\nIndies, emigration, prisons and hospitals, with a mass of miscellaneous\r\nmatters; and the fourth of East and West Africa.[88:2] But the division\r\nof the colonies among these officers is not fixed, and varies to some\r\nextent with their personal experience. There are, in close connection\r\nwith the office, agents for each of the dependencies, those for the\r\nself-governing colonies being real representatives appointed by the\r\ncolonial governments, while the three who act on behalf of the crown\r\ncolonies are selected by the Colonial Office itself.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed that the Colonial Office has by no means charge of\r\nall the outlying dependencies of the British Crown. Besides the\r\nprotectorates governed by the Foreign Office, there are a number of\r\nsmaller places under the care of other departments. The Isle of Man and\r\nthe Channel Islands, for example, are under the Home Secretary; some\r\nsmall islets are used only for lighthouses by the Board of Trade; while\r\nby an official fiction the Island of Ascension is considered a vessel of\r\nwar, and as such is commanded by the Admiralty. But larger by far than\r\nany of these, more populous than all the other parts of the British\r\nEmpire put together, is India. It is not classed among the colonies, for\r\nthat term is confined to the places under the Colonial Office, and does\r\nnot extend to a country ruled by a distinct administrative system of its\r\nown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The India Office.]\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State for India has the usual parliamentary and\r\npermanent staff; but he has in addition a Council of India, composed of\r\nnot less than ten or more than fifteen members, appointed for a term of\r\nten years. In order to insure a familiarity with Indian conditions, it\r\nis provided that nine of the members must have lived in India within ten\r\nyears of their appointment.[89:1] The Council is a consultative body. It\r\nhas no power of initiative, but except for matters requiring secrecy or\r\nurgency (such as war and peace, or the relations of India with foreign\r\npowers or with the native states), all questions must be brought before\r\nit for consideration. The Secretary of State is not, however, bound by\r\nits decision, save in a few cases, of which the most important are the\r\nexpenditure of the Indian revenues, and the issue of Indian loans.[89:2]\r\n\r\nLegally, the government of India is directed by the Secretary of State\r\nand his Council. Even the laws made in India can be disallowed by the\r\nCrown on their advice; but in spite of the ease of communication\r\nfurnished by the telegraph, the internal affairs of the country are\r\nstill in the main managed by the authorities in India, happily without\r\nmuch interference from England. Parliament, moreover, exercises little\r\ncontrol over Indian administration. Some matters--the use of the Indian\r\nrevenues, for example, to pay for expeditions beyond the\r\nfrontier--require its consent; and in other cases notice of action taken\r\nmust be laid before it within a certain time. But the ordinary\r\nopportunities for bringing pressure to bear do not exist, because the\r\nsalary of the Secretary of State for India, being paid out of the Indian\r\nrevenues, does not furnish an occasion for a debate in Parliament; and\r\nalthough the Indian budget is regularly submitted, it does not need to\r\nbe approved. On one of the last days of the session, when the work of\r\nthe year is almost done, and the members are weary of attending, this\r\nbudget, which is merely a financial statement, is introduced, and in\r\norder to give an opportunity for debate a formal motion is made that the\r\nIndian accounts show such and such totals of receipts and expenses. A\r\ndiscussion follows on the part of members who deem themselves qualified\r\nto express opinions on the government of India, and then the vote is\r\npassed. An illustration of the small authority of Parliament in Indian\r\nmatters may be found in the fact that in 1891 (April 10) the House of\r\nCommons carried against the ministers a motion condemning the opium\r\nrevenue; and in 1893 (June 2) a resolution that the examinations for the\r\nIndian Civil Service ought to be held in India, as well as in England,\r\nwas carried in the same way; yet, on each occasion, the government after\r\nstudying the subject came to the conclusion that the opinion of the\r\nHouse had been wrong, and did not carry it into effect. Such a condition\r\nof things is highly fortunate, for there is probably no body of men less\r\nfitted to rule a people than a representative assembly elected in\r\nanother land by a different race.\r\n\r\nIf the vast colonial empire has complicated foreign relations it has\r\nalso caused England to become the greatest of maritime powers, with an\r\nenormous navy to protect her dependencies, her merchant ships, and not\r\nleast important, the routes of her food supply. The effective\r\norganisation of a naval force is, therefore, of more importance in her\r\ncase than in that of any other nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Admiralty.]\r\n\r\nIt has already been observed that the Admiralty is the only department\r\nof state conducted by a board that really meets for the transaction of\r\nbusiness, yet even in this case the statement may convey a false\r\nimpression of the character of the body. The board as created by Letters\r\nPatent under the Great Seal consists of a First Lord, four Naval Lords\r\nand a Civil Lord; but by a series of Orders in Council, and by the\r\npractice of the department, the parliamentary and permanent secretaries\r\nalso sit as members of the board.[91:1] The First Lord, the Civil Lord\r\nand the parliamentary secretary are capable of sitting in the House of\r\nCommons, and are, in fact, always members of one or other House of\r\nParliament. The permanent secretary is, as his name implies, a permanent\r\nofficial, and hence excluded from the House of Commons altogether. The\r\nNaval Lords, on the other hand, although eligible to Parliament,[91:2]\r\nare very rarely members,[91:3] and yet they are not permanent officials.\r\nThey occupy the anomalous position of non-political officials, who\r\nnevertheless retire upon the fall of the ministry. This does not mean\r\nthat they belong necessarily to the party in power, or that they may not\r\nbe reappointed under the commission issued when a new ministry comes\r\ninto office. In order to preserve a continuity of administration, and a\r\nknowledge of the work, the new patent usually includes one, and\r\nsometimes more, of the Naval Lords who served under the preceding\r\ncabinet, and commonly another who held the place under some earlier\r\nministry of the party that has taken office.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Position of the First Lord.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the language of the patent all of the members of the Board\r\nof Admiralty are equal in authority; but in fact the First Lord, who is\r\nalways in the cabinet, is held by Parliament responsible for the conduct\r\nof the department, and as the other members of the board can be changed\r\nif necessary on his recommendation, they must adopt the course which he\r\ncan justify in Parliament. With the evolution of the cabinet system,\r\ntherefore, the power of the First Lord has increased until he has become\r\npractically a minister of marine assisted by an advisory council. The\r\nrelation was sanctioned, not created, by Orders in Council of Jan. 14,\r\n1869, and March 19, 1872, which declared the First Lord responsible for\r\nall business of the Admiralty,[92:1] and thus \"the department now\r\npossesses more the character of a council with a supreme responsible\r\nhead than that of an administrative board.\"[92:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Other Lords.]\r\n\r\nThe Civil Lord and the financial or parliamentary secretary are\r\nsubordinate ministers, who occupy substantially the position of\r\nparliamentary under-secretaries. They are civilians, as is the permanent\r\nsecretary also; while the four Naval Lords are naval officers, usually\r\nof high rank, who bring an expert knowledge to bear upon the\r\nadministration of the department. But the members of the board, like the\r\ncabinet ministers, have individual as well as collective duties. By the\r\nOrders in Council of March 19, 1872, and March 10, 1882, and the\r\nregulations made in pursuance thereof, the work of the office is\r\ndistributed among the members of the board, each of whom is at the head\r\nof a branch of the service, and responsible for it to the First Lord. By\r\nvirtue of this arrangement the First Lord retains in his own hands the\r\ngeneral direction of political questions, and the appointment of flag\r\nofficers and the commanders of ships. The First Naval Lord, who is also\r\nthe principal adviser of his chief, has charge of strategical questions,\r\nthe distribution of the fleet, discipline, and the selection of the\r\nhigher officers not commanding ships. The Second Naval Lord has charge\r\nof the recruiting and education of officers and men, and the selection\r\nof the lower officers. The Third Naval Lord, who is the \"Controller,\"\r\nattends to the dockyards, and to construction, repairs and ordnance;\r\nwhile the Junior Naval Lord has charge of the transport and medical\r\nservice, and the victualling and coaling of the fleet. The Civil Lord\r\nattends to the civil establishments, and the contracts relating to\r\nstores and to land. The parliamentary secretary is responsible for\r\nfinance; and the permanent secretary for the personnel in the Admiralty\r\nOffice, for routine papers and correspondence and for the continuity of\r\nbusiness on the advent of a new board.[93:1]\r\n\r\nThus the actual administration of the Navy devolves upon the members of\r\nthe board charged with the superintendence of the different branches of\r\nthe service, while the full board meets frequently for the consideration\r\nof such questions as the First Lord wishes to refer to it.[93:2] There\r\nhave been at times complaints about the working of the board, and the\r\nexisting organisation is the result of gradual adaptations,[93:3] but at\r\nthe present day the system appears to be highly satisfactory, and in\r\nfact it is constantly held up as a model to the less fortunate chiefs of\r\nthe Army.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The War Office.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of the Crimean War.]\r\n\r\nThe organisation of the War Office has undergone far more changes than\r\nthat of the Admiralty, and has been the subject of a great deal more\r\ncriticism both in and out of Parliament.[93:4] Like other countries with\r\na popular form of government, England has found it hard to reconcile\r\nmilitary command and civil control. In the War Office, as in the\r\nAdmiralty, there has been a tendency to transfer supreme power gradually\r\nto the hands of the parliamentary chief; but owing to a number of\r\ncauses--one of which was the tenacity with which the Queen clung to the\r\nidea of a peculiar personal connection between the Crown and the\r\nArmy--the process of change in the War Office has been slow and halting.\r\nUp to the time of the Crimean War the Army was controlled by several\r\ndifferent authorities, whose relations to one another were not very\r\nclearly defined, and who were subordinate to no single administrative\r\nhead. This naturally produced friction and lack of efficiency, which\r\nwas forcibly brought to public attention by the sufferings of the\r\ntroops during the war. The result was the creation of a distinct\r\nSecretary of State for War, and the concentration in his hands of\r\nmost of the business relating to the Army; but the change was made\r\nwithout a thorough reorganisation of the War Office, and without\r\ndefining the relative authority of the Secretary of State and the\r\nCommander-in-Chief.[94:1] This last office was held at that time by the\r\nQueen's cousin, the Duke of Cambridge; and the fact that he was a royal\r\nduke, coupled with the Queen's feelings about the Army, threw an\r\nobstacle in the way of bringing the office fully under the control of\r\nthe Secretary. In 1870, however, the Queen was prevailed upon to issue\r\nan Order in Council providing that the Commander-in-Chief should be\r\ncompletely subordinate to the Secretary of State.[95:1] Unfortunately,\r\nthis order by no means settled either the organisation of the War\r\nOffice, or the relation between the Secretary and the Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Hartington's Commission.]\r\n\r\nA number of commissions have examined the subject, one of the most\r\nimportant of late years being Lord Hartington's Commission, which\r\nreported in 1890.[95:2] At that time[95:3] the Adjutant General, who was\r\ncharged with the general supervision of the military department, was the\r\nfirst staff officer of the Commander-in-Chief, and as such was\r\nresponsible to him for the efficiency of the forces; while the other\r\nprincipal military officers--the Quartermaster General, Military\r\nSecretary, Director of Artillery, Inspector of Fortifications, and\r\nDirector of Military Intelligence--were also immediately responsible not\r\nto the Secretary of State, but to the Commander-in-Chief, and approached\r\nthe latter through the Adjutant General. Thus, while all the officers in\r\nthe department were nominally subordinate to the Secretary of State,\r\npractically between him and them stood the Commander-in-Chief, who had\r\nthe privilege of approaching the Crown directly and without the\r\nintervention of the Secretary. The commission thought that such a system\r\nfailed to make the heads of the different branches of the service\r\neffectively responsible to the Secretary, or to provide any satisfactory\r\nsystem for giving him expert advice. They recommended, therefore, the\r\nvirtual abolition of the office of Commander-in-Chief, and a division of\r\nthe duties among a number of officers, who should be individually\r\nresponsible for their administrative work to the Secretary, and should\r\ncollectively advise him as a War Office Council. They recommended, in\r\nshort, a system not unlike that of the Admiralty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Changes of 1895.]\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary to bringing about a change of this kind Sir Henry\r\nCampbell-Bannerman, the Liberal Secretary of State for War, procured the\r\nresignation of the Duke of Cambridge in 1895, and Lord Wolseley was\r\nappointed Commander-in-Chief for five years. The Secretary then\r\nannounced a plan in accordance with the main principles suggested by the\r\nHartington Commission. But just at that time the Liberal administration\r\nfell,[96:1] and Lord Lansdowne, the new Secretary of State, made a\r\nchange in the plan, which left more power in the hands of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief. The policy thus adopted was embodied in an Order in\r\nCouncil of Nov. 21, 1895, followed by a memorandum setting out in\r\ngreater detail the duties of the heads of the different branches of the\r\nservice thereunder.[96:2] According to the new system the\r\nCommander-in-Chief exercised the general command, issued army orders,\r\ninspected troops, took charge of the distribution of the Army, and\r\nprepared strategical plans, having under him for that purpose the\r\nDirector of Military Intelligence. He was also to have the general\r\nsupervision of all the military departments, and to be the principal\r\nmilitary adviser of the Secretary of State, all important questions\r\ngoing to him before submission to the Secretary. The Adjutant General\r\nwas to have charge of the discipline and training of officers and men,\r\nand the patterns of their uniforms,--a matter which seems to involve as\r\nmany changes in fashion as a dressmaking establishment. The\r\nQuartermaster General had charge of food, forage, transports and\r\nremounts. The Inspector of Fortifications constructed and maintained\r\nforts, barracks, etc., and supervised the engineer corps. The Inspector\r\nGeneral of Ordnance looked after the supply of warlike stores and\r\nequipments, and each of these officers advised the Secretary of State on\r\nquestions connected with his department. The Financial Secretary had\r\ncharge of all questions of expenditure, and of the audit of accounts.\r\nUntil 1899 he was also at the head of the manufacturing departments, but\r\nby an order of that year they were transferred to the Inspector General\r\nof Ordnance, whose title was changed to Director. By the memorandum\r\nwhich followed the order a War Office Council was created, consisting of\r\nthe heads of the military departments, the under-secretaries of state,\r\nand the Financial Secretary, together with any other officers who might\r\nbe summoned; its function being to discuss subjects referred to it by\r\nthe Secretary of State. An Army Board, composed of the heads of the\r\nprincipal military departments, was also established, which was to\r\nreport upon promotions to the higher grades in the Army, upon estimates,\r\nand upon other questions submitted to it by the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Results.]\r\n\r\nThe two great changes made at this time were the modification in the\r\npowers of the Commander-in-Chief, and the creation of consultative\r\nboards in the War Office. Neither of them can be said to have attained\r\nthe object aimed at. The attempt to create advisory councils of that\r\nkind has been tried more than once, but after working usefully for a\r\ntime they have ceased to meet regularly and have fallen into disuse.\r\nThis appears to have been the case with the War Office Council and Army\r\nBoard created in 1895 and reorganized in 1899 and 1900.[97:1]\r\n\r\nThe position of Commander-in-Chief under the Order in Council of 1895\r\nhas been the subject of severe criticism. At the expiration of his term\r\nof five years, Lord Wolseley recorded in a memorandum his opinion that\r\nthe attempt to give the Commander-in-Chief a supervision over the\r\ndepartments of the War Office, and yet make their heads responsible to\r\nthe Secretary of State, involved a contradiction, and had resulted in\r\ndepriving the Commander-in-Chief of all effective control, and in making\r\nhis office a high-sounding title with no real responsibility. He\r\ninsisted that no army could be efficient unless the command, discipline\r\nand training of the troops were in the hands of one man, and that man a\r\nsoldier; and he urged that the Commander-in-Chief should either be made\r\nthe real head of the forces, or that the office should be abolished, and\r\nthe Secretary of State for War should be himself a military man.[98:1]\r\nThe only direct result that the memorandum had on the organisation of\r\nthe War Office was the reestablishmemt of the control of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief over the department of the Adjutant General by an\r\nOrder in Council on Nov. 4, 1901.[98:2] But a statement by Lord Wolseley\r\nof his views, in a speech in the House of Lords in March, 1901, led to\r\nan unseemly altercation with Lord Lansdowne, the late Secretary of State\r\nfor War, in which each sought to cast upon the other the blame for the\r\nlack of preparation for the war in South Africa.[98:3] The occurrence\r\nwould appear to show that the relations between the military and civil\r\nauthorities at the War Office are not yet upon a well-recognised or\r\nsatisfactory basis; and it shows also that this relation is very\r\ndifferent from that which ordinarily prevails between ministers and\r\ntheir expert officials. For reasons that will be explained in a later\r\nchapter, such a dispute in any other department would be well-nigh\r\ninconceivable. From a political point of view the Army and Navy officers\r\nare, in fact, in an exceptional situation. They are not subject to the\r\ngeneral rule which excludes from the House of Commons all office-holders\r\nwho are not ministers.[98:4] And just as military officers are allowed\r\nto play a part in politics forbidden to other public servants, so those\r\namong them who hold high administrative posts stand in a position\r\npeculiar to themselves, a position which in the case of the Admiralty is\r\ndefinite and satisfactory, although anomalous, but in the case of the\r\nArmy is not altogether definite or satisfactory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of the South African War.]\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of the War Office was put to a rude test by the South\r\nAfrican War, and some branches of the service did not stand the test\r\nvery well. The results recalled, although in different respects, the\r\nexperiences of the Crimean War. The commission on the war found that,\r\nboth as regards plans and stores, there had been a grave lack of\r\npreparation which was not wholly due to the suddenness of the\r\nemergency.[99:1] There was not merely a deficiency in warlike stores,\r\nsuch as guns[99:2] and ammunition for them,[99:3] cavalry-swords[99:4]\r\nand clothing;[99:5] but some of the stores were unfit for use. Such\r\nclothing, for example, as there was on hand six months before the war\r\nbroke out was all red and blue cloth, quite unsuitable for the campaign;\r\nand even after the manufacture of khaki suits had begun, changes were\r\nordered first in the material and then in the pattern.[99:6] More than\r\none third of the small arms ammunition on hand was found to be\r\nunserviceable and was discarded;[99:7] and all the reserve rifles were\r\nwrongly sighted, so that at a distance of five hundred yards they shot\r\neighteen inches to the right--an occurrence the more extraordinary\r\nbecause the government had been manufacturing those weapons for some\r\nyears, and never discovered the defect until after the war broke\r\nout.[99:8]\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to suppose that all the shortcomings in the South\r\nAfrican War arose from defects in the War Office. Some of them were of a\r\nkind certain to occur where a military organisation is suddenly expanded\r\nbeyond its normal size. Still, the errors already described certainly\r\nshowed a lack of efficiency, and they have led to a remodelling of the\r\noffice. In November, 1903, another commission was appointed for this\r\npurpose, and its principal recommendations[100:1] were put into effect\r\nin the course of the following year.[100:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Changes of 1904.]\r\n\r\nAccording to this last system, for which the Admiralty served as a\r\npattern, an Army Council has been formed, consisting of the Secretary of\r\nState for War, the parliamentary under-secretary, the Financial\r\nSecretary to the War Office, and of four military members. The post of\r\nCommander-in-Chief having been abolished, and that of Chief of Staff\r\ncreated instead, the four military members of the council are the Chief\r\nof Staff, the Adjutant General, the Quartermaster General, and the\r\nMaster General of Ordnance. By the terms of the Order in Council the\r\nmilitary members are responsible to the Secretary of State for so much\r\nof the business relating to the organisation, disposition, personnel,\r\narmament and maintenance of the Army as he assigns to them or each of\r\nthem, while the Financial Secretary is responsible for finance, and the\r\nparliamentary under-secretary for the other matters that are not\r\nstrictly military. The permanent under-secretary acts as secretary of\r\nthe council, which has also under its orders a new officer, the\r\nInspector General of the Forces, charged with the duty of reporting to\r\nit upon the results of its policy, and of inspecting and reporting upon\r\nthe training and efficiency of the troops, and the condition of the\r\nequipment and fortifications. But the Army Council has in the last\r\nresort only advisory powers, for the Secretary of State is expressly\r\ndeclared responsible to the Crown and to Parliament for all its\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lack of Initiative among Officers.]\r\n\r\nAn army, and especially a standing army, is liable during a long period\r\nof peace to fall into habits that impair its efficiency in war. One of\r\nthe chief criticisms made after the South African War related to the\r\nlack of initiative, and of capacity to assume responsibility, on the\r\npart of the officers both in the War Office and in the field.[100:3]\r\nNow, this is precisely the defect that one would expect to find under\r\nthe circumstances. With the traditions of strict discipline ingrained in\r\nmilitary men, there is a natural tendency in time of peace to regulate\r\neverything with precision, leaving to subordinate officers little\r\nindependence of action. And in fact the Committee on War Office\r\nOrganisation in 1901 reported that the Army was administered by means of\r\na vast system of minute regulations, which tended on the one hand to\r\nsuppress individuality and initiative, while on the other their\r\ninterpretation led to protracted references, and to absorbing the time\r\nof high officials by matters of routine.[101:1] The evidence presented\r\nto the Committee on the war in South Africa pointed to the same evil,\r\nfor it showed that the deficiencies of the officers arose from their\r\nbeing too much controlled and supervised during their training.[101:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Training.]\r\n\r\nThe excessive tendency to routine, and the consequent lack of\r\ninitiative, might be counteracted in some measure by a keen intellectual\r\ninterest in the profession on the part of the younger officers; but the\r\nmilitary education they receive is hardly of a character to stimulate\r\nsuch an interest. As a rule the candidates for commissions, after\r\nleaving the great public schools, such as Eton, Harrow and Rugby, where\r\nthe sons of the upper classes are educated, obtain admission to the\r\nmilitary academies by means of competitive examinations based upon the\r\ncurriculum of those schools. The ordinary time then spent in studying at\r\nWoolwich, where the engineer and artillery officers are taught, is two\r\nyears; that at Sandhurst, the school for the infantry and cavalry, was\r\neighteen months before the South African War, and later only a year.\r\nPeriods of this length are obviously too short to give a thorough\r\ntraining, or even a strong interest, in military science; and, in fact,\r\nthe object is rather to produce a good subaltern than a highly educated\r\nofficer.[102:1] If a man is ambitious for promotion he is expected to\r\npursue his studies by himself, or to attend the staff college, later in\r\nlife. Now, with the modern application of science to warfare, a military\r\nofficer has become a member of a learned profession. But in England the\r\npreliminary teaching is insufficient for this purpose; and what is more,\r\nthe conditions of the service are very unlike those of learned\r\nprofessions, and hardly such as to stimulate intellectual activity.\r\nMoreover, the private contributions to the mess, and the other expenses\r\nof an officer, are often so great that it is difficult for a man without\r\nprivate means to follow the Army as a career. In short, after the\r\nabolition of the purchase of commissions in 1871, the Army ceased to be\r\na caste without becoming a profession.[102:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advantages of the Navy.]\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Navy escapes some of the difficulties that beset the\r\nArmy is not due altogether to better organisation. The Navy has in many\r\nways great natural advantages as compared with the Army. Most civilians\r\nfeel that after a short experience they could lead a regiment, but few\r\nlandsmen have the hardihood to believe that they could ever command a\r\nship. The Navy is a mystery which ordinary men do not pretend to\r\nunderstand, and with which they do not attempt to interfere; and this is\r\na security for expert management. Again the Navy is less exposed to the\r\ndangers of peace. Warships are constantly in service. If they do not\r\nfight, at least they go to sea; and hence the Navy is far less likely\r\nthan the Army to suffer from the demoralising influence of minute and\r\nantiquated regulations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Training of Naval Officers.]\r\n\r\nThis has an effect also upon the training of naval officers. Under the\r\nold plan which is now being superseded, the theoretical education given\r\nthem was by no means high. The cadets destined for executive naval\r\nofficers entered \"The Britannia\" at the age of about fifteen, and spent\r\nthere a little less than a year and a half. They then had a service of\r\nabout three years at sea, where besides learning the practical side of\r\ntheir profession, they were expected to study elementary mathematics,\r\nmechanics, physics, navigation, surveying, etc. Then followed a couple\r\nof months at Greenwich preparing for the final examination in those\r\nsubjects; and, lastly, before receiving their commissions as\r\nsub-lieutenants, five or six months at Portsmouth studying pilotage,\r\ngunnery, and torpedo practice. Thus the average age for obtaining the\r\ncommission was not far from twenty years. The theoretical study pursued\r\nwas certainly not of an advanced character. In mathematics, for example,\r\nit did not include the calculus, or even conic sections. In fact,\r\naccording to the syllabus as revised in 1899, one of the optional\r\nsubjects which men who desired to go farther than the rest might pursue,\r\nif they desired, was projectiles, \"treated so as not to require a\r\nknowledge of conic sections.\"[103:1]\r\n\r\nThe principal changes made by the new plan, which began to go into\r\neffect in 1903, were, first, making the executive, engineer and marine,\r\nofficers more nearly into a single corps, and therefore giving them a\r\ncommon training until they reach the grade of sub-lieutenant; and,\r\nsecond, reducing the age for entering \"The Britannia\" to between twelve\r\nand thirteen. This last change enables the cadets to remain at the\r\nschool four years, and will, it is hoped, insure a sounder education.\r\nThey are then to get a training at sea for three years, followed by\r\nthree months at Greenwich and six at Portsmouth. At that point they are\r\nto receive their commissions as sub-lieutenants, and those who join the\r\nexecutive branch of the service will go to sea again, while the engineer\r\nand marine officers attend their respective colleges for some time\r\nlonger.[104:1] Whatever good effects the new plan may have in other\r\ndirections, it can hardly increase materially the scientific education\r\nof the cadet.\r\n\r\nBut if the education in the theory of naval science has not been carried\r\nfar, the junior naval officer has much greater opportunities for\r\nlearning the practice of his profession than the officer in the army. In\r\nfact, if not a master of naval science he becomes an excellent seaman,\r\nand this, in the opinion of many officers, is much the more important of\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Defence Committee.]\r\n\r\nOne of the chief criticisms of Lord Hartington's Commission on the\r\nadministration of the naval and military departments, bore upon the lack\r\nof combined plans of operation for the defence of the empire. They\r\nsuggested the formation of a naval and military council, to be presided\r\nover by the Prime Minister, and to consist of the parliamentary heads of\r\nthe two services, and their principal professional advisers.[104:2] In\r\npartial fulfilment of this recommendation a committee of the cabinet was\r\nformed, consisting of the Prime Minister, the parliamentary heads of the\r\nArmy and the Navy, the First Lord of the Treasury, with the addition, if\r\nneed be, of the Colonial Secretary. The committee was intended to deal\r\nwith questions unsettled between the two departments, matters in which a\r\njoint policy was advisable, and questions relating to the relative\r\nimportance of expenditures; and it differed from other committees in\r\nthat minutes were to be kept of its proceedings, and formally recorded\r\nby the departments. The committee seems, however, not to have fulfilled\r\nthe intentions of the Hartington Commission, for it has been openly\r\nstated in Parliament that it never met;[105:1] and even the Secretary\r\nof State for War admitted that it acted mainly with regard to estimates,\r\nand to questions within the War Office and the Admiralty, while, in his\r\nopinion, it ought to act on larger questions of policy. A new Defence\r\nCommittee was, therefore, created in 1903, to consist, besides members\r\nof the cabinet, of the most influential experts of the two services, and\r\nwhen necessary of representatives of the Indian and Colonial Offices.\r\nThe committee is intended to deal not only with estimates, but with\r\nlarger questions of military policy.[105:2] But whether this result will\r\nbe permanently attained, or whether the committee will meet with the\r\nusual fate, and find itself absorbed by details of administration and of\r\nexpenditure, is yet to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe departments of state that remain to be considered in this chapter\r\nneed not detain us long. They are all concerned with the internal\r\ngovernment of the kingdom, and so far as their work is of general\r\ninterest it will be touched upon again.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Home Office.]\r\n\r\nThe Home Office is a kind of residuary legatee. It is intrusted with all\r\nthe work of the secretariat that has not been especially assigned to the\r\nremaining secretaries of state, or to the other administrative\r\ndepartments. Its duties are, therefore, of a somewhat miscellaneous\r\ncharacter. As the heir to the residue of the secretariat, the Home\r\nSecretary is the principal channel of communication between the King and\r\nhis subjects, and countersigns the greater number of the King's acts. He\r\nreceives addresses and petitions addressed to the sovereign, and\r\npresents them if he thinks best. Among others he receives petitions of\r\nright--that is, claims to be allowed to sue the Crown--and consults the\r\nAttorney General about the answer to be given. Outlying places, such as\r\nthe Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, which are not from an\r\nadministrative point of view a part of the United Kingdom and yet are\r\nnot colonies, fall under his jurisdiction. He has charge of questions of\r\nnaturalisation and extradition. But more important still, the central\r\ncontrol over the police, not having been transferred to the Local\r\nGovernment Board, remains in his hands, and this gives him wide powers\r\nof supervision. The metropolitan police of London is, indeed,\r\nadministered directly by the national government under his immediate\r\ncontrol;[106:1] and although the police elsewhere is not under his\r\norders, yet the fact that the central government pays one half of the\r\ncost on condition his regulations are observed, enables him to prescribe\r\nthe organisation, equipment and discipline of the local police all over\r\nEngland. Moreover, all by-laws of counties and boroughs, except those\r\nrelating to nuisances, must be submitted to him for approval, and may on\r\nhis advice be disallowed by the Crown.[106:2] As a part of his authority\r\nin matters of police he manages the prisons, both the national prisons\r\nfor convicts and the county and borough gaols. He is responsible for the\r\nappointment and removal of recorders and stipendiary magistrates. He\r\nappoints the Director of Public Prosecutions, and makes regulations\r\nabout costs in criminal proceedings. By virtue of special statutes he\r\nsees to the enforcement of the acts relating to factories, mines,\r\nburial-grounds, inebriates, anatomy, vivisection, explosives, and other\r\nkindred matters.\r\n\r\nHe is assisted by a parliamentary under-secretary, and by a large staff\r\nof permanent officials, beginning with a permanent under-secretary, and\r\nincluding a prison commissioner, a metropolitan police commission, and a\r\nhost of inspectors for factories, mines, police, and so forth.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that although primarily responsible for public\r\norder, the Home Secretary is by no means a minister of the interior in\r\nthe continental sense, for apart from the police he has very little to\r\ndo with local government. The supervision of matters of that kind,\r\nalthough in part scattered among different departments, is mainly\r\nconcentrated in the hands of the Local Government Board. The Home\r\nSecretary has, on the other hand, some of the functions of a minister of\r\njustice; and this will be referred to again when we come to speak of the\r\nLaw Officers of the Crown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Board of Works.]\r\n\r\nThe Board of Works is not regarded as a department of great political\r\nimportance, and for this reason it presents one of the two or three\r\ncases where the minister has no parliamentary under-secretary. For a\r\nscore of years the public lands and buildings were under the care of a\r\nbody called the Commissioners of Woods and Forests; but in order to keep\r\nthe revenue from land separate from the expenditure upon buildings, and\r\nso bring the latter more completely under the control of Parliament, the\r\nduties were divided in 1852. The Commissioners of Woods, Forests and\r\nLand Revenues were made a permanent non-political body under the\r\nTreasury, while the Board of Works was established to take charge of the\r\nconstruction and maintenance of parks, palaces and other buildings. At\r\nthat time many of the public buildings were, in fact, committed to the\r\ncare of the departments that occupied them; but by a series of statutes\r\nthese have now been transferred almost wholly to the Board of Works.\r\nNow, although the amount of money that passes through its hands is very\r\nlarge, the board is by no means entirely free, for without the sanction\r\nof the Treasury it can undertake no work not directly ordered by\r\nParliament, and it can make no contracts for the erection of large\r\npublic buildings without submitting them to the same authority,[107:1]\r\nwhich also appoints the ordinary permanent staff of the office.[107:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Board of Trade.]\r\n\r\nThe Board of Trade occupies, on the contrary, a position of great and\r\ngrowing importance. It has had a long and chequered history, and\r\nalthough in the course of its career it has lost duties enough to keep\r\nan active department busy, these have been more than replaced under\r\nthat modern tendency toward state regulation of industry which is\r\nconstantly adding to its burdens. It deals not only with trade, but with\r\nmany of the chief agencies of trade, and especially with transportation.\r\nAs in the case of the three other boards to be described hereafter, the\r\nBoard of Trade is engaged not in direct administration, but in\r\nsupervising and regulating the action of private bodies and local\r\nauthorities, and in keeping a watch upon the enforcement of the law.\r\nSpeaking broadly, its powers have grown by the process of making it\r\nresponsible for the application of a great many statutes.\r\n\r\nIts functions may be classified roughly under the heads of collecting\r\ninformation, registration, inspection, and authorising acts or\r\nundertakings of a public nature; although any such classification is\r\nsadly confused by the fact that duties of more than one kind have been\r\nconferred upon the board in regard to the same subject-matter, and even\r\nby the same statute. To the first of these classes belong its functions\r\nin collecting and publishing statistics relating to domestic and foreign\r\ntrade, and giving advice on commercial matters to other departments of\r\nthe government. To that class belong also its functions as a labour\r\nbureau in preparing statistics about labour, wages and other matters\r\ntouching the interests of workingmen. In this connection it has power\r\nalso to act as a board of conciliation in labour disputes, and to name\r\narbitrators or conciliators. Under the head of registration may be\r\nmentioned its duties in maintaining the standards of weights and\r\nmeasures; registering joint-stock companies; examining and recording\r\npatents and trade-marks; and keeping a register of ships and seamen.\r\nUnder the head of inspection come its functions in ascertaining that\r\nmerchant vessels are in a seaworthy condition, and properly laden,\r\nofficered, manned and equipped; with the power to detain unseaworthy\r\ncraft. Under the same head may be classed its control over harbours, its\r\nduty to see to the enforcement of the laws relating to railways[109:1]\r\nand to inquire into the causes of railway accidents and disasters at\r\nsea. As an example of the final class of powers may be cited the fact\r\nthat the by-laws of a railway company require for their validity the\r\napproval of the board; but a far more important instance is to be found\r\nin its control over the building of new lines of railway, over new\r\nundertakings for the supply of water, gas and electric light, and over\r\nthe construction of tramways and light railways, the last being a recent\r\ninvention legally very different, but physically indistinguishable, from\r\ntramways. This control is exercised by means of provisional orders,\r\nprepared by the board after an investigation and a hearing of all the\r\npersons interested, and then confirmed by Parliament.[109:2] The\r\npetitioner is not, indeed, compelled to resort to a provisional order,\r\nbut may avoid the direct control of the Board of Trade by means of a\r\nprivate bill in Parliament. But a provisional order is far less\r\nexpensive; and even when the procedure is by private bill the board\r\nendeavours to exert its influence by scrutinising the bill, and bringing\r\nto the notice of the officers of the House any departures from the\r\ngeneral policy of legislation.[109:3] The result is that the board has\r\nan effective, although by no means an absolute, control over these\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nThe subject of bankruptcy has also been placed in the hands of the Board\r\nof Trade, and except for legal questions which come before the courts,\r\nit has the entire charge of the cases, maintaining for that purpose a\r\nstaff of inspectors, examiners and official receivers.\r\n\r\nThe nearest approach to actual administrative work intrusted to the\r\nboard is in the case of lighthouses, buoys and beacons, which are\r\nmaintained by Trinity House, an ancient corporation composed of\r\nself-elected brethren but financially under the control of the Board of\r\nTrade.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Local Government Board.]\r\n\r\nUntil the era of the Reform Bill local affairs in England were managed\r\nin the main by justices of the peace and town councillors, whose powers\r\nwere derived from a host of statutes covering many subjects in great\r\ndetail. These officers were kept rigorously within the limits of their\r\nauthority because the legality of their acts could be tested in the\r\ncourts of law; but they were almost entirely free from administrative\r\ncontrol. The first wide breach in the system was made by the Poor Law\r\nAmendment Act of 1834, which aimed at a reform in the method of giving\r\npoor relief, and set up for the purpose a commission to supervise the\r\nlocal bodies. The new commissioners, being vigorous and efficient,\r\naroused hostility, and as they were not permitted to sit in Parliament,\r\nthey found it hard to defend their policy. In fact the experience they\r\nwent through is used by Bagehot as an illustration of the impotence of\r\nan executive department without a representative in the House of\r\nCommons.[110:1] In 1847 the body was reorganised under the title of the\r\nPoor Law Board, with a responsible minister at its head, and thenceforth\r\nreceived from time to time additions to its duties. Various functions\r\nrelating to public health and local government had in the meanwhile been\r\nintrusted to the Home Secretary and the Privy Council; and, finally, in\r\n1871 the greater part of them were transferred to the Poor Law Board,\r\nwhich was given the name of Local Government Board.\r\n\r\nLegislation of this kind has entirely transformed the nature of English\r\nlocal government. Partly by bringing the exercise of existing powers\r\nunder the supervision of the central government, partly by subjecting to\r\nsystematic control the new powers called into life by the wants of the\r\ntime, the old system of local self-government--limited by law, but\r\nindependent of any administrative superior--has been replaced by a\r\nsystem where the local bodies, and especially those outside of the great\r\ntowns, are to a considerable extent under the tutelage of the state. The\r\nsubjection is not the same as that which prevails in other European\r\ncountries, and it is not so great, but it is in some respects more\r\nnearly akin to the continental system than to that of England in the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\nExcept for such matters as police, education, and the supply of\r\ntransportation, light and water, the control over the local authorities\r\nis almost entirely vested in the Local Government Board; but as the\r\nsubject of local government, and therefore the powers of the board, will\r\nbe considered at some length in another part of this book, we do not\r\nneed to enumerate its functions here. We need only point out that it has\r\nthe unusual number of five assistant under-secretaries, and a large\r\nstaff of clerks, auditors and inspectors. But although the amount of\r\nhead work to be done, and therefore the number of permanent officials of\r\nhigh grade, is large, yet from a political point of view the department\r\nis not regarded as of the first class.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Board of Agriculture.]\r\n\r\nThe creation in 1889 of a new department of state to attend to the\r\nmatters that have been transferred from various commissions to the Board\r\nof Agriculture hardly seems to have been necessary; and, indeed, the\r\nboard is not important enough to require a parliamentary\r\nunder-secretary. It has inherited the duty of shaking the dry bones of\r\nancient tenures by dealing with such subjects as the commutation of\r\ntithes, the enfranchisement of copyhold, the enclosure of commons,\r\nallotments to labourers, and the improvement of land by limited owners.\r\nThe control of fisheries, the promotion of agriculture and the\r\nprevention of contagious diseases among animals are also placed under\r\nits care, and it has been given power, or rather authority, to muzzle\r\ndogs and destroy the Colorado beetle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Board of Education.]\r\n\r\nThe Board of Education is the youngest of all the boards, but in reality\r\nit is only a committee of the Privy Council reorganised with some\r\nadditional powers. The most remarkable thing about the act creating\r\nit--apart from the erection of a sham board--is the extent of the\r\nauthority delegated to the executive. Instead of prescribing minutely\r\nthe organisation and functions of the department of education, the act\r\nempowered the government, in its discretion, to set up such a\r\nconsultative committee as it saw fit, and to transfer to the board any\r\neducational duties of the Charity Commissioners or the Board of\r\nAgriculture that it thought best.[112:1] Both of these powers have been\r\nexercised by Orders in Council of Aug. 7, 1900, and the Consultative\r\nCommittee has been made to consist of representatives selected by the\r\nuniversities and by other bodies interested in education. But the\r\nsubject of public education will be treated in subsequent chapters, and\r\nit is enough here to note that by means of elaborate regulations,\r\ncommonly known as the Education Code, the board prescribes the\r\ninstruction to be given in all schools aided by public money;[112:2]\r\nthat it inspects endowed or private secondary schools at their\r\nrequest;[112:3] and that it has charge of the museums at South\r\nKensington and Bethnal Green, and of the Geological Museum and Survey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Post Office.]\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the national government the Post Office has\r\ntwo functions. It is a great administrative department which conducts a\r\nhuge business, with a minister at its head; and it is a source of\r\nincome, its gross receipts forming about one seventh of the total\r\nrevenues of the United Kingdom, its disbursements only about one tenth\r\nof the total expenditure. For that reason it is under a financial\r\ncontrol by the Treasury so strict as to leave very little chance for\r\nindependent action, and this renders the position of Postmaster General\r\nfar less important than it would otherwise be. The office has been\r\nregarded as political since 1837; but until 1866 the holder could not\r\nsit in the House of Commons, and since that time he has occasionally\r\nbeen a peer, the Post Office in such a case being usually represented in\r\nthe Commons by the Financial Secretary of the Treasury. The duties of\r\nthe Postmaster General are minutely prescribed by statute, and while he\r\nhas power to make regulations for the management of the postal service,\r\nit is not easy to make substantial changes or improvements without\r\naffecting the receipts or the expenses, and when that is done he comes\r\nat once under the control of the Treasury. The rates of postage, for\r\nexample, and the compensation for carrying the mails, when not fixed by\r\nAct of Parliament, are subject to the approval of the Treasury; and so\r\nare the purchase or sale of land, and any lease of the right to carry on\r\na telegraph or telephone business. The same approval is also required\r\nfor his regulations touching money-orders, post office savings-banks,\r\nand the telegraph, although in these cases the revenue would not appear\r\nto be necessarily involved. In short, as Sir William Anson puts\r\nit,[113:1] \"The Postmaster General is no more than the acting manager of\r\na great business, with little discretionary power except in the exercise\r\nof the very considerable patronage of his office.\"[113:2]\r\n\r\nThe business of the department is certainly enormous, the number of\r\npersons employed being little short of two hundred thousand. In addition\r\nto the usual work of transmitting letters, books, parcels and\r\nmoney-orders, the Post Office in England maintains savings-banks, with\r\ndeposits of about 150,000,000_l._; and it has been given exclusive\r\ncontrol of the telegraph by provisions which have been held to include\r\nthe telephone also. But while the administration of the telegraph has\r\nbeen retained by the government in its own hands, the right to conduct\r\nthe telephone business was granted, by means of temporary licenses, to\r\nprivate companies, and to some extent to local authorities also; and the\r\ngovernment has only recently decided to take over the management as soon\r\nas the licenses expire.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[82:1] Such are the offices of the Lord Steward and the Lord\r\nChamberlain, the latter having in his charge also the censorship of\r\nplays and theatrical performances.\r\n\r\n[83:1] The name of the Board of Trade is now statutory (25-26 Vic., c.\r\n69, Sec. 2; 52-53 Vic., c. 63, Sec. 12, cl. 8). Its composition,\r\nhowever, is fixed not by statute but by Order in Council at the\r\nbeginning of each reign, save that an act of 1867 (30-31 Vic., c. 72)\r\nabolished the office of Vice-President, and provided instead that one of\r\nthe secretaries to the board might sit in Parliament.\r\n\r\n[83:2] For the organisation of the Board of Works, see 14-15 Vic., c.\r\n42; 37-38 Vic., c. 84; for the Local Government Board, 34-35 Vic., c.\r\n70; Board of Agriculture, 52-53 Vic., c. 30; Board of Education, 62-63\r\nVic., c. 33.\r\n\r\n[83:3] In the case of the Board of Works he is styled First\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\n[84:1] The Council of India, described hereafter, has some of the\r\ncharacteristics of a board.\r\n\r\n[84:2] Hans., 4 Ser.

LXX., 353. There may have been good reasons for not\r\ncreating a sixth secretary of state, and among them the fact that a\r\nsecretary of state receives a salary of 5000_l._, while the president of\r\nthe board receives 2000_l._ But, as Mr. Bryce pointed out (Hans., 4 Ser.\r\nLXXIII., 632), a secretary might have been appointed who, like the\r\nSecretary for Scotland, should not be a secretary of state. The salary\r\nof the Secretary for Scotland is, in fact, 2000_l._\r\n\r\n[86:1] Until a few years ago the departments were: (1) the Eastern\r\n(Eastern Europe and Central Asia); (2) Western (Western Europe,\r\nNorthwest Africa and the Pacific Islands); (3) American and Asiatic\r\n(which includes China, Japan and Siam); (4) Consular (including East and\r\nWest Africa); (5) Commercial; (6) The Chief Clerk's (which has charge of\r\nfinancial business); (7) The Library (with the papers of the office);\r\n(8) The Treaty Department.

The militia are a little more like regular troops than the\r\nvolunteers. They are formally enlisted and their period of training is\r\nlonger. None of the auxiliary forces can be ordered out of the United\r\nKingdom; but while the volunteers are intended solely to support the\r\nregular army in defending the country in case of invasion, the militia\r\nhave always offered their services in time of war, and have often been\r\nused for garrison duty both at home and abroad, and even for field\r\nservice abroad. The yeomanry are a body of cavalry forming part of the\r\nmilitia. A royal commission on the militia and volunteers reported in\r\n1904 that both of these forces were unfit to take the field against a\r\nregular army; that the period of training ought to be increased in each\r\ncase; and that a home defence army, capable of protecting the United\r\nKingdom in the absence of the greater part of the regular army could be\r\nraised only by universal compulsory military service.

He has, however, now\r\nbeen in the cabinet continuously since 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE TREASURY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important of all the departments, and the one that exhibits in\r\nthe highest degree the merits of the English government, is the\r\nTreasury. It is the central department of the administration, which\r\nkeeps in touch with all the others, and maintains a constant financial\r\ncontrol over them. But before considering how that is done it may be\r\nwell to explain the process by which money flows in and out of the\r\nnational purse. The part played by Parliament in the imposition of\r\ntaxes, and the authorisation of expenditure by means of appropriations,\r\nwill be described in chapter XIV, and we are concerned here only with\r\nthe machinery for collecting those taxes, and giving effect to the\r\nappropriations.[115:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Consolidated Fund and the Bank of England.]\r\n\r\nUntil the Commonwealth, taxes were, as a rule, granted to the King, who\r\nused the proceeds to carry on the government as he saw fit; but under\r\nCharles II. Parliament began to appropriate parts of the revenue for\r\nspecific purposes, and after the revolution of 1688 this developed into\r\na comprehensive system, so that the whole revenue was appropriated, to\r\nbe used only for the objects, and in the sums, designated by\r\nParliament.[115:2] It was the custom, however, to appropriate for\r\nspecific objects the proceeds of particular taxes, a practice that made\r\nthe public accounts needlessly complex. In 1787 William Pitt, following\r\nearlier partial experiments, simplified matters by creating a single\r\nConsolidated Fund into which all revenues from every source were\r\nturned, and from which all payments were made.[116:1] The Consolidated\r\nFund is deposited in the Bank of England and the Bank of Ireland, which\r\nhave a right to use it like any other deposit, and perform, in fact, for\r\nthe government much the same service that an ordinary bank does for a\r\nmerchant. This method of dealing with the national finances continued\r\nsubstantially intact until a few years ago,[116:2] when it was\r\ncomplicated by two innovations, one of which allows a department to use\r\nincidental revenues, under the name of \"appropriations in aid,\" to\r\ndefray expenses, and the other sets aside certain parts of the national\r\nincome to supplement local taxation, in each case without passing\r\nthrough the Consolidated Fund.[116:3] The second of these exceptions is\r\ndue to the great increase of local expenditure, and the narrow range of\r\nlocal taxation, which have caused a demand for national subventions, and\r\nhave resulted in setting apart for the purpose the proceeds of specific\r\nsources of revenue. In this way the income from the local taxation\r\nlicenses, and a portion of the income from the death duties and the\r\nduties on spirits and beer, are now collected by the central government\r\nand paid directly into the Local Taxation Account.[116:4] But saving\r\nthese cases, all the national receipts are paid into, and all the\r\ndisbursements are made from, the Consolidated Fund.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Method of Getting Money into the Consolidated Fund.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sources of Revenue.]\r\n\r\nThe financial procedure of the Treasury is now regulated by the\r\nExchequer and Audit Departments Act of 1866,[117:1] and the Public\r\nAccounts and Charges Act of 1891.[117:2] By these acts the gross\r\nrevenue--after making the deductions already mentioned--is paid into the\r\n\"account of His Majesty's Exchequer,\" at the Banks of England and\r\nIreland, to be used as a single fund. The three chief collectors of\r\nrevenue are the Commissioners of Customs, the Commissioners of Inland\r\nRevenue and the Post Office. With the growth of the principles of free\r\ntrade the customs duties became confined to coffee, chicory, cocoa,\r\ndried fruit, tea, tobacco, wine, and a number of articles, such as\r\nspirits, on which duties are laid to countervail the excise upon similar\r\narticles produced at home. To these were added at the time of the South\r\nAfrican War an export duty on coal, and import duties on sugar and\r\ngrain, the last being again dropped in 1903, while the coal duty was\r\nrepealed in 1906. Under normal fiscal conditions in times of peace, the\r\ncustoms duties yield about one fifth of the total revenue, the receipts\r\nbeing mainly from tobacco, tea and spirits. The gross receipts from the\r\nPost Office (including the telegraphs) form about one seventh of the\r\nrevenue, but this is really misleading, because three quarters of those\r\nreceipts are paid out again for the expenses of the department. All but\r\na very small fraction of the remaining receipts come through the\r\nCommissioners of Inland Revenue, and their sources of income are of a\r\nmiscellaneous character. The largest item is the excise, mainly on beer\r\nand spirits, which yields more than a quarter of the total national\r\nrevenue.[117:3] The next largest is the income tax, which varies very\r\nmuch from time to time, and has produced during the last score of years\r\nfrom one seventh to one quarter of the total revenue. Then there are the\r\ndeath duties, a progressive tax on property passing at death, which\r\nyield one tenth of the revenue. The ancient land-tax, and the\r\ninhabited-house duty produce comparatively small sums; and, finally,\r\nthere are the stamp duties on all kinds of transactions, articles and\r\nlicenses which yield all together about one twelfth of the revenue. Some\r\nof the license fees collected under the head of excise are so small as\r\nto appear rather vexatious than productive, such as one guinea for the\r\ndisplay of armorial bearings not used upon a carriage, fifteen shillings\r\nfor a license to have a manservant, or keep a carriage with less than\r\nfour wheels, and fourpence a day for the privilege of occasionally\r\nselling tobacco.[118:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Permanent and Annual Taxes.]\r\n\r\nNeither the expenditure nor the proceeds of taxes being absolutely\r\nconstant, it is necessary, in order to maintain a close balance between\r\nthem, to adjust the sources of revenue to some extent from year to year,\r\nand this is done by means of a small number of variable charges. Most of\r\nthe taxes are imposed by permanent statutes, changed only at long\r\nintervals, but the rates of assessment under the tea duty and the income\r\ntax are fixed each year in the annual Finance Act; and since 1894\r\ncertain additional duties on beer and spirits have also been laid for a\r\nyear at a time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Accuracy of the Budget.]\r\n\r\nIt has been the aim of English statesmen to make the revenue and\r\nexpenditure of each year balance one another as closely as possible, and\r\ntheir skill in doing so has been extraordinary. While the South African\r\nWar was raging such a result was naturally impossible, but during the\r\npreceding twenty-five years the difference between receipts and\r\nexpenditures (including payments on account of the debt) was never more\r\nthan about four per cent, and in fifteen of those years it did not\r\nexceed one and a half per cent. The taxes are, indeed, of such a\r\ncharacter that it is possible to forecast their proceeds with great\r\naccuracy. The Chancellor of the Exchequer intends to make his\r\ncalculations so as to leave a margin of safety, and yet during the\r\nperiod under consideration the difference between the estimated and\r\nactual receipts was never more than about three and a half per\r\ncent.[119:1]\r\n\r\nAccurate fiscal administration is very much promoted by the rule that\r\nany part of an appropriation unexpended at the end of the financial year\r\nin which it is voted shall lapse, and cannot afterwards be used unless\r\nit is granted afresh by Parliament.[119:2] The rule has been thought to\r\nlead to wastefulness by provoking improvident haste in spending the\r\nwhole appropriation before March 31.[119:3] But such an evil is surely\r\nfar smaller than that of allowing the appropriations to run on, with the\r\nresult, well known in France, for example, that the annual accounts\r\ncannot be finally made up, and the extent of the deficit determined,\r\nuntil several years have passed.\r\n\r\nLike all other excellent things devised by men, the English system of\r\nfinance is not without its drawbacks. If it promotes careful\r\nadministration, and rivets attention upon any increase in the budget, it\r\nalso makes the revenue inelastic in emergencies. A great deal has been\r\nsaid in Parliament of late about broadening the basis of taxation, but\r\nthat is a very difficult thing to do suddenly, without dislocating the\r\ncommercial as well as the fiscal system; and while the existing taxes\r\nare elastic up to a certain point, an attempt to raise them too much\r\nwould diminish rather than increase their productiveness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Method of Getting Money out of the Consolidated Fund.]\r\n\r\nJust as there are two kinds of taxes, one permanent and the other\r\nannual, so there are two classes of expenditure, one regulated by\r\nstanding laws, and the other by annual appropriations. All the ordinary\r\nexpenses of the government require parliamentary sanction every year,\r\nboth on the theory that the money collected from the nation ought not to\r\nbe spent without the consent of its representatives, and also in order\r\nthat Parliament may be able to oversee the administration and criticise\r\nit in every session. But there are certain matters that ought to be kept\r\naloof from current politics, and ought not to be brought in question in\r\nthe heat of party conflict. The principal charges that have been\r\nregarded in this light are the interest on the national debt, the Civil\r\nList or personal provision for the King, annuities for the royal family,\r\ncertain pensions, and the salaries of the judges, of the Comptroller and\r\nAuditor General, of the Speaker, and of a few officers of lesser\r\nimportance. These charges amount to nearly one quarter of the total\r\nexpenditures; and they are called Consolidated Fund charges, because by\r\nstatute they are paid directly out of the Consolidated Fund without the\r\nneed of any further action by Parliament. The other expenditures are for\r\nwhat are known as the supply services, because the appropriations for\r\nthem are voted by the House of Commons in Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\nThe administrative procedure for getting money out of the Consolidated\r\nFund to pay the Consolidated Fund charges and the supply services is not\r\nprecisely the same. In the case of the supply services a royal order for\r\nthe amounts appropriated by Parliament is made under the King's sign\r\nmanual, countersigned by two of the Commissioners of the Treasury. The\r\nTreasury then requires the Comptroller and Auditor General to grant\r\ncredits at the Banks of England and Ireland for those amounts, and if\r\nsatisfied that the authority from Parliament is complete, he makes an\r\norder on the banks granting the credits. From time to time the Treasury\r\nrequests the banks to transfer to the various supply accounts, for\r\ndisbursement, sums of money not exceeding the credits so granted.[121:1]\r\nThe procedure in the case of Consolidated Fund charges differs from this\r\nonly in the fact that a royal order is not needed, and the Comptroller\r\nand Auditor General, on the requisition of the Treasury, grants\r\nquarterly credits for the amounts prescribed by statute.[121:2] By this\r\nprocess a highly effective security is provided that no money shall be\r\nspent without the authority of Parliament. The Consolidated Fund is\r\ndeposited in the banks of England and Ireland, which are liable if any\r\nof it is withdrawn without an order from the Comptroller and Auditor\r\nGeneral, while that officer is given the same independence as the\r\njudges. Like them he is appointed during good behaviour, with a salary\r\ncharged upon the Consolidated Fund. The security is not absolutely\r\nperfect, for there are some moneys, such as the appropriations in aid,\r\nthat do not pass through the Consolidated Fund; and as no foresight can\r\nbe unfailing, the government is given a limited power to meet unforeseen\r\ncontingencies, and to cover expenses that have inevitably proved larger\r\nthan was anticipated.[121:3] But all matters of this kind are fully\r\nreported to Parliament by the Comptroller and Auditor General.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Audit of the Accounts.]\r\n\r\nThe Treasury lays before Parliament annually the Finance Accounts of the\r\npreceding year, while the Comptroller and Auditor General submits at a\r\nlater date a separate report. Therein he examines the Consolidated Fund\r\ncharges, and makes for the supply services more elaborate statements,\r\ncalled the Appropriation Accounts, in three volumes, relating to the\r\nArmy, the Navy and the civil service. The accounts are rendered to him\r\nby the several departments, and after auditing them he transmits them to\r\nthe House of Commons with his comments.[121:4]\r\n\r\nThe money granted by Parliament is divided into votes, of which there\r\nare in all about one hundred and forty.[122:1] In the estimates these\r\nvotes are subdivided into subheads and items; but the votes would appear\r\nto be the only limitation expressly placed by Parliament upon\r\nexpenditure; for the Annual Appropriation Act provides that the sums\r\ngranted shall be deemed to be appropriated \"for the services and\r\npurposes expressed in Schedule (B) annexed\" thereto, and that schedule\r\ngives a list of the votes, but not of the subheads or items.\r\nNevertheless, the Comptroller and Auditor General is enjoined by the\r\nExchequer and Audit Departments Act of 1866 to ascertain whether the\r\nmoney expended has been applied to the purpose or purposes for which\r\neach grant was intended to provide,[122:2] and hence the reports that he\r\nsubmits note the excess or saving with the reasons therefor, under each\r\nsubhead, and sometimes, as in the case of votes for the construction of\r\nnew buildings, under each item. He adds, also, his own comments wherever\r\nit seems to him necessary to do so. All this is done, even where the\r\nsaving under one subhead more than counterbalances the excess under\r\nanother in the same vote. When that happens, however, no action by\r\nParliament is required; but if the total amount of a vote has been\r\noverspent, the excess is entirely unauthorised, and must be covered by a\r\ndeficiency appropriation, which Parliament grants upon the reports of\r\nthe Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee on Accounts of the\r\nHouse of Commons. To the last rule there is one exception. In order to\r\nfacilitate the administration of the Army and Navy, the Annual\r\nAppropriation Act declares that the Treasury may authorise expenditure,\r\nnot provided for, to be defrayed temporarily out of any surplus effected\r\nupon other votes in each of those departments; and the Act goes on to\r\nrecite and sanction the transfers of surplus so authorised by the\r\nTreasury in the last year for which the accounts are complete.[123:1]\r\nThis brings us to another important question, that of the financial\r\ncontrol of the Treasury over the other branches of the administration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treasury Control over Other Departments.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Control over Estimates.]\r\n\r\nThere has been a great deal of discussion about Treasury control over\r\nthe receipt and expenditure of public money. In the case of the receipts\r\nit is a simple matter, for the financial control over the Post Office\r\nhas already been described, and the other great revenue departments are,\r\nas will shortly be explained, virtually subordinate to the Treasury. The\r\nquestion of control over expenditure is far more complicated. Committees\r\nof the House of Commons have, at different times, collected evidence on\r\nthe subject,[123:2] but the statements made have often been vague, and\r\ntend to confuse the control of the Treasury over the estimates, with its\r\ncontrol over expenditure after the appropriations have been voted by\r\nParliament. The control over the estimates has been discussed in the\r\npreceding chapter. It is only necessary here to repeat that such a\r\ncontrol is by no means absolute, because any important question of\r\nexpenditure becomes a question of policy to be decided, in case of\r\ndisagreement, by the Prime Minister or the cabinet; and to point out\r\nthat the departments supported by their political chiefs are usually too\r\nstrong for the Treasury to resist.[123:3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Control over Expenditure.]\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that after the appropriations had been voted the\r\ndepartments would be free in expending them, subject only to their\r\nresponsibility to Parliament; but this is not altogether true. In the\r\nfirst place a statute sometimes requires that the expenses of a\r\ndepartment shall be sanctioned by the Treasury.[124:1] Then it is not\r\ninfrequently provided that the salaries shall be fixed by the Treasury,\r\nor that alterations in the establishment shall require its consent.\r\nMoreover, the salaries of certain grades of clerks are regulated by\r\nOrders in Council,[124:2] which are changed only on the advice of the\r\nTreasury. Apart, however, from statutes and Orders in Council there is a\r\ngeneral customary principle forbidding any increase in the civil\r\nestablishment of a department,--that is, any increase in the number or\r\nsalary of permanent officials,--without the approval of the Treasury;\r\nand this although the appropriations would not be exceeded.[124:3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Transfer of a Surplus.]\r\n\r\nOver certain departments the control is even more extensive, for not\r\nonly do the contracts made by the Post Office require its approval, but\r\ncontracts entered into by the Board of Works are also the subject of\r\ndiscussion between the Treasury and the First Commissioner.[124:4] In\r\nthe case of the Army and Navy the fact that the Treasury can authorise a\r\ntransfer of the surplus under one vote to cover a deficiency under\r\nanother gives it a certain authority; and, indeed, its sanction is to\r\nsome extent sought even for transfers between subheads of the same vote.\r\nThis last is, of course, a matter of custom rather than of law, and\r\npractice differs in the two services. The Admiralty, which always plays\r\nthe part of the good boy, comes very frequently to the Treasury for\r\npermission to make transfers between subheads before it acts; while the\r\nArmy, save in exceptional cases, comes only at the end of the year for a\r\nformal approval.[125:1] The exceptional cases are, however, numerous.\r\nThey sometimes extend even to separate items, and are regulated by a\r\ncode of rules made by the Treasury and the department.[125:2] Every\r\nexcess, for example, of a certain size in an item for a new building,\r\nthe payment of any excess to a contractor, the discharge of a loss, or\r\nthe insertion of a new item, require the sanction of the Treasury; and\r\nin fact the Appropriation Accounts of the Army and Navy are followed by\r\nmany pages of correspondence on matters of this kind between the\r\nTreasury and the department. In the case of the civil services, where\r\nthe Treasury has no authority to sanction transfers between votes, the\r\nsystem is less elaborate and the correspondence is not printed in full.\r\nStill there are frequent references in the accounts to Treasury letters\r\nsanctioning expenditures under subheads or items, especially in relation\r\nto such matters as salaries, the purchase of land, large excesses over\r\nestimates for construction, the abandonment of claims, and unforeseen\r\nexpenditures.[125:3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of Treasury Control.]\r\n\r\nThe control by the Treasury is sometimes vexatious in small\r\nmatters,[126:1] but it does not seriously hamper the administration, or\r\nimpair the efficiency of the service;[126:2] and while it can hardly\r\nprevent an expenditure on which a department is seriously\r\ndetermined,[126:3] the very need of consultation can hardly fail to act\r\nas a restraint upon extravagance.[126:4]\r\n\r\nIn addition to its control over the application of the sums voted by\r\nParliament, and its authority to permit the use of appropriations for\r\npurposes not contemplated in the estimates, the Treasury has a limited\r\npower to open the national purse in case of necessity when no grant has\r\nbeen made by Parliament. For this purpose it has three sources of supply\r\nat its disposal: the Treasury Chest Fund, limited to 1,000,000_l._, may\r\nbe used to make temporary advances for carrying on the public service,\r\nto be repaid out of sums afterwards appropriated; the Civil\r\nContingencies Fund, limited to 120,000_l._, is available on similar\r\nterms for unforeseen contingencies and deficiencies; and, finally, any\r\nincidental receipts, not granted by Parliament as appropriations in aid,\r\nmay be used as such under the authority of a Treasury minute to be laid\r\nbefore the Houses.[126:5]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Organisation of the Treasury.]\r\n\r\nIn the remarks on the history of the Treasury Board, at the beginning of\r\nthe last chapter, it was pointed out that the board no longer meets.\r\nThe Treasury minutes are still drawn up in the name of \"My Lords,\" but\r\nthis is merely the survival of a form, and all the members of the board,\r\nexcept the Chancellor of the Exchequer, have ceased to take part in\r\ndirecting the financial administration. The three junior lords have at\r\ntimes some small departmental duties, but their real functions are to\r\nact as assistants to the Parliamentary or Patronage Secretary, who is\r\nthe chief government whip in the House of Commons. All the four whips\r\nreceive salaries from the state on the theory that it is their duty to\r\nkeep a House, or in other words to insure the presence of a quorum,\r\nwhile the supplies are being voted. But in fact they are officers, not\r\nof the state, but of the party in power, and it is their business to see\r\nthat whenever a vote is taken in which the ministry is interested, their\r\npartisans are present in greater force than those of the Opposition. The\r\nrelation of the First Lord to the Treasury is anomalous. He is usually\r\nthe Prime Minister, and as such is supposed to keep a general\r\nsupervision upon all branches of the administration, and to act as a\r\nsort of umpire between the different ministers, and, therefore, between\r\nthe Treasury and the other departments. But whether he is Prime Minister\r\nor not he has a real connection with the Treasury. The functions of that\r\noffice cover a much wider field than its name would imply, including\r\nsubjects of a most miscellaneous character; and while the finances are\r\nentirely under the charge of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,--who is,\r\nin fact, the Minister of Finance, with the Financial Secretary of the\r\nTreasury as his parliamentary under-secretary,--the First Lord may be\r\nsaid, speaking very roughly, to be at the head of the outlying\r\ndepartments which are not concerned with financial affairs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Subordinate Departments.]\r\n\r\nThe Treasury has been described as a superintending and controlling\r\noffice that has properly no administrative functions;[127:1] and this,\r\nin a sense, is true, for even in money matters its duty as an organised\r\ndepartment is financial direction and control, not the actual\r\ncollection and disbursement of the revenue. It prepares the budget,\r\nreviewing the estimates submitted to it, and devising the means of\r\ndefraying them; it supervises the collection of the revenue, and keeps\r\nwatch over the expenditure. In this work the political chiefs are\r\nassisted by a body of clerks, headed by the permanent under-secretary,\r\nwhose office is generally regarded as the highest in the permanent civil\r\nservice. The offices that have direct charge of the collection of\r\nrevenue have separate organisations with distinct staffs of permanent\r\nofficials; but, except for the Post Office, they have no political\r\nchiefs of their own, and are in fact subordinate branches of the\r\nTreasury. The four great offices of this kind are the Post Office, which\r\nhas already been described; and the departments of Customs, of Inland\r\nRevenue, and of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues, each of which is\r\nmanaged by commissioners who are members of the permanent civil service,\r\nand do not change with changes of ministry.[128:1]\r\n\r\nThe Treasury bears a similar relation to the departments that deal with\r\npurely fiscal payments, the National Debt Office, the Public Works Loan\r\nBoard, and the Paymaster General's Office, through which almost all\r\ndisbursements are now made. For, although the Paymaster General is a\r\npolitical officer, he has ceased to have any real connection with his\r\ndepartment, and it is administered under the direction of the\r\nTreasury.[129:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Outlying Departments.]\r\n\r\nBesides the departments subordinate to the Treasury, there are a number\r\nof outlying departments more or less closely connected with it which\r\nhave already been referred to as having nothing to do with financial\r\naffairs; and, indeed, one may say that in theory, at least, every branch\r\nof the public service--except the Ecclesiastical and Charity\r\nCommissions[129:2]--that does not have a political chief of its own, and\r\nis not connected with some other department, is under the supervision of\r\nthe Treasury and represented in Parliament thereby. But while the\r\ncommissioners, or other heads of such offices, are as a rule appointed\r\non the recommendation of the First Lord, or of the Prime Minister, the\r\ndegree of control exercised over them by the Treasury varies a great\r\ndeal; and in some cases its responsibility, apart from regulating the\r\namount of expenditure, is somewhat illusory. Several institutions in\r\nthis position are intended to be entirely outside the range of party\r\ncontroversy; and the boards of trustees of the British Museum, the\r\nNational Gallery, and the National Portrait Gallery habitually contain\r\nmembers of Parliament who would never think of resigning their posts by\r\nreason of a change of ministry. The principal outlying departments of\r\nthe Treasury directly connected with national administration, are: the\r\nCivil Service Commission, which examines the candidates for the various\r\nbranches of the civil service; the Parliamentary Counsel's office, which\r\ndrafts all the bills introduced by the ministers; and the stationery\r\noffice, which does all the government printing.\r\n\r\nThroughout a great part of the nineteenth century the influence of the\r\ncommercial classes was strong, the government was conducted on strict\r\nbusiness principles, and the Treasury as the representative of those\r\nprinciples was the keystone of the administrative arch, or to change the\r\nmetaphor, the axle on which the machinery of the state revolved. For a\r\nlong time, indeed, there was a marked tendency to consider the office of\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer as the most important in the cabinet after\r\nthat of the Prime Minister, to regard the person who held it as heir\r\npresumptive to the premiership, and to make him leader in the House of\r\nCommons when his chief was a peer. But with the waning desire for\r\neconomy, and the growth of other interests, the Treasury has to some\r\nextent lost its predominant position. A symptom of this may be seen in\r\nthe fact that during the last dozen years of Lord Salisbury's\r\nadministrations, the Commons were led, not by the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, but by a First Lord of the Treasury appointed for the\r\npurpose. The turning point came at the beginning of that period, when\r\nLord Randolph Churchill in 1886 quarrelled with his colleagues over the\r\nestimates for the Army. The occurrence did not produce, but it did mark,\r\na change in the tone of public opinion; and although the Treasury will\r\nno doubt maintain its control over the details of expenditure, one\r\ncannot feel certain that its head will regain the powerful influence\r\nupon general or financial policy exerted thirty years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[115:1] An excellent description of the existing financial procedure may\r\nbe found in Sir Courtney Ilbert's \"Legislative Methods and Forms,\"\r\n284-99.\r\n\r\n[115:2] This did not apply to the hereditary revenues of the Crown\r\nuntil, with the exception of the revenues belonging to the Duchies of\r\nLancaster and Cornwall, they were surrendered by George III., in return\r\nfor a fixed Civil List.\r\n\r\n[116:1] 27 Geo. III., c. 13.\r\n\r\n[116:2] The rule had not been absolutely without exceptions, for the\r\nMercantile Marine Fund, derived from port charges on vessels, was used\r\nto defray part of the expenses of the Board of Trade without going\r\nthrough the Consolidated Fund. _Cf._ 2d Rep. Com. on Civil Estab., Com.\r\nPapers, 1888, XXVII., 1, Qs. 18211-26. In 1898 this process was\r\nrestricted to the maintenance of lighthouses, buoys and beacons. It may\r\nbe observed, also, that the Act of 1891 concerning \"appropriations in\r\naid\" (54-55 Vic., c. 24, Sec. 2) declares that it merely gives statutory\r\nauthority to an existing practice. Such appropriations are now regularly\r\ngranted by Parliament in aid of the votes for the services in which they\r\noccur. The amount in aid of each vote is fixed, and listed in a separate\r\ncolumn in the schedule to the Appropriation Act, only the excess above\r\nthat amount being paid into the Consolidated Fund.\r\n\r\n[116:3] Ilbert, \"Legislative Methods and Forms,\" 294-95; Glen, \"Law of\r\nPublic Health,\" 1343, 1344.\r\n\r\n[116:4] This innovation has been vigorously criticised as tending to\r\nconfuse the national accounts.

Of\r\nlate years it has shown a steady tendency to increase. In 1899, the year\r\nbefore the war, it was 2_l._ 13_s._ 6_d._; and in 1902 it was 3_l._\r\n8_s._ 8_d._, the expenditure being 4_l._ 13_s._ 11_d._ Between 1857 and\r\n1900 the national debt was reduced by gradual payments from\r\n837,144,597_l._ to 628,978,783_l._ In 1902 it had increased in\r\nconsequence of the South African War to 747,911,107_l._\r\n\r\n[119:2] For the history of this rule see Todd, \"Parl.

In 1901, for example, in a case where the War\r\nOffice, without exceeding its total vote, but before seeking the\r\napproval of the Treasury, paid to a contractor an addition of 1000_l._\r\nupon a contract for which no item appeared in the votes of the year, the\r\nCommittee of Accounts remarked, \"Your Committee deprecate in the\r\nstrongest manner any diversion of Parliamentary funds without Treasury\r\nsanction.\" 3d Rep.

It collects also some other bits of hereditary revenue;\r\nbut the total amount of its receipts is small, and the commissioners are\r\nonly two in number. The Customs Establishment, which collects all duties\r\non imports and exports, is managed by a chairman, a deputy chairman and\r\none other commissioner; and, finally, the Inland Revenue Office, which\r\ncollects the excises, and all the other national taxes, is a huge\r\nconcern, and has at its head a chairman, deputy chairman and two other\r\ncommissioners. This department was formed by uniting the boards of\r\nExcise, of Taxes and of Stamps; and it has been suggested that the\r\ndepartments of Customs and of Inland Revenue should be combined, but\r\nthat has been thought inadvisable. (_Cf._ 3d Rep. Com. on Civil Estabs.,\r\nCom. Papers, 1889, XXI., 1.)\r\n\r\n[129:1] The Chancellor of the Exchequer is also _ex officio_ Master of\r\nthe Mint.\r\n\r\n[129:2] The Ecclesiastical Commission manages the episcopal estates and\r\nother church property, using the revenues to pay the income of the\r\nbishops, and to promote the work of the Established Church in poor and\r\npopulous places. It is not connected with any department of the\r\ngovernment, and in fact is rather an institution belonging to the Church\r\nthan a branch of the public service. The commissioners include all the\r\nbishops, several cabinet ministers, and a number of other laymen, of\r\nwhom a couple sit in Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Charity Commission, a body possessing semi-judicial powers in the\r\nregulation of charitable trusts, occupies a position more like that of\r\nan administrative department. Of the four commissioners one is unpaid,\r\nand represents the body in Parliament.\r\n\r\nThese two commissions are, therefore, in the anomalous position of\r\nhaving been deliberately provided with spokesmen in Parliament, who are\r\nnot responsible ministers of the Crown. The British Museum, the National\r\nGallery, and the National Portrait Gallery are in this respect in the\r\nsame situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS OFFICES\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Government and the Administration of Law.]\r\n\r\nThere is in England no single officer corresponding to the minister of\r\njustice, or attorney general, in other countries, some of the duties\r\nperformed by them elsewhere being divided in England among a number of\r\nauthorities, while others are not performed at all. The principal\r\nofficers who fill this important gap are the Lord Chancellor, the Law\r\nOfficers of the Crown, and the Director of Public Prosecutions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Lord Chancellor.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest political dignitary in the British government, the one\r\nendowed by law with the most exalted and most diverse functions, the\r\nonly great officer of state who has retained his ancient rights, the man\r\nwho defies the doctrine of the separation of powers more than any other\r\npersonage on earth, is the Lord Chancellor. Apart from his duties as a\r\njudge, as the presiding officer of the House of Lords, and as a member\r\nof the cabinet, all of which have been or will be described in other\r\nplaces, he has many powers of a miscellaneous character connected for\r\nthe most part with the administration of the law.[131:1] He is, for\r\nexample, at the head of the Crown Office in Chancery. This, as the place\r\nwhere the Great Seal is affixed, is legally and formally, although not\r\npolitically, important. The Commissioners in Lunacy, also, report to\r\nhim. The regulations relating to public prosecutions require his\r\napproval, and the control of the Land Registry Office devolves mainly\r\nupon him. Almost all the judicial patronage, moreover, is in his hands,\r\nfor he is consulted about the highest posts, the selection of the puisne\r\njudges of the High Court is made on his recommendation, and he appoints\r\nand removes the county court judges and justices of the peace.[132:1]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Lord Chancellor is a party leader, and is at once an active\r\nmember of the legislative, the executive and the judicial branches of\r\nthe government, the evils that might be supposed to result from such a\r\ncombination of powers in the same hands do not in fact appear. He might,\r\nindeed, when sitting in the Judicial Committee, or in the House of\r\nLords, be called upon to construe a statute which he had a share in\r\nenacting, but this does no great harm. The really serious matter is a\r\nconfusion of the executive and judicial powers, the sitting in judgment\r\nby a political officer upon a question on which he has acted, or which\r\nmay affect his future action, in an administrative capacity. But since\r\nthe Chancellor never holds court alone at the present day, such a\r\nquestion could come before him only in the Court of Appeal, the House of\r\nLords, or the Judicial Committee, where he sits with other judges, who\r\nhave no connection with the ministry. Moreover, the Chancellor, although\r\nthe legal member of the cabinet, is not its sole, nor indeed its\r\nofficial, legal adviser; and the government would never think of acting\r\nupon any doubtful point of law without obtaining the opinion of the Law\r\nOfficers of the Crown. These gentlemen hold no judicial position; and\r\ncuriously enough, while a part of the ministry, are never in the\r\ncabinet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Law Officers of the Crown.]\r\n\r\nThe principal Law Officers of the Crown are the Attorney General, and\r\nthe Solicitor General, who is his colleague and substitute.[133:1]\r\nTheir opinion on questions of law may be asked by the government, and by\r\nany department, although many of the departments are provided with\r\npermanent legal counsel of their own whose advice is sufficient for all\r\nordinary matters. The Attorney and Solicitor General conduct personally\r\na few prosecutions of unusual importance, file criminal informations,\r\nand appear in cases where the rights of the Crown are involved, or where\r\ntheir intervention is necessary to protect charitable endowments. They\r\ndefend in Parliament the legality of the government's action, and\r\nexplain incomprehensible legal points in its measures. While they are no\r\nlonger permitted to engage in private practice, their salaries and fees\r\nare so large[133:2] that these posts are among the great political\r\nprizes for lawyers who have made their mark in the warfare of the House\r\nof Commons,[133:3] prizes the greater because, in addition to the direct\r\nemoluments, they confer a presumptive claim to the very highest places\r\non the bench that may become vacant while the party is in power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Public Prosecutions in England.]\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that the Law Officers of the Crown conduct in\r\nperson only a few criminal cases of unusual importance. In other\r\ncountries the prosecution of offenders is the affair of the state, and\r\nis conducted in all the courts great and small by public officers. This\r\nis true in Scotland also, where the matter is in the hands of a body of\r\nofficers, known as procurators fiscal, with the Lord Advocate at their\r\nhead; and even in Ireland a similar system has developed informally by\r\nthe employment of crown counsel acting under the control of the Attorney\r\nGeneral for that kingdom. But in England criminal prosecutions in the\r\nvast majority of cases are still, in theory at least, conducted by\r\nprivate persons.[134:1] Any one, whether a person injured or not, may\r\nprosecute the offender.[134:2] As a rule the examining magistrate, after\r\ncommitting the accused for trial, binds some one over to\r\nprosecute--either the complainant, the person injured, a policeman, the\r\nmagistrate's own clerk, or a solicitor employed for the purpose. The\r\ncase is usually conducted by the solicitor to the local magistrate, but\r\nthe person bound over may employ his own counsel to take charge of it.\r\nThe costs of the trial are, however, at the present day, allowed by the\r\ncourt, and paid out of the national treasury, under regulations made by\r\nthe Home Secretary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Director of Public Prosecutions.]\r\n\r\nIt has always been the habit for the Attorney General to conduct great\r\nstate trials, cases, for example, of high treason; and it gradually came\r\nto be the practice for the legal officers attached to the different\r\ndepartments to prosecute in certain other cases, such as offences\r\nagainst the coinage. But about the middle of the last century there\r\narose a demand for a general system of state prosecutions under the\r\ncharge of a ministry of justice.[134:3] This movement culminated, or\r\nevaporated, in the Acts of 1879 and 1884,[134:4] whereby the Solicitor\r\nto the Treasury, who is the permanent legal adviser of that department,\r\nand is also charged with a number of other duties of a legal nature, has\r\nbeen made the Director of Public Prosecutions. The regulations governing\r\nhis actions in this capacity are made by the Attorney General with the\r\napproval of the Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary. They provide in\r\nsubstance[134:5] that he shall prosecute in all capital cases, in\r\noffences against the coinage, cases of fraudulent bankruptcy, cases\r\nwhere he is directed to do so by the Attorney General or the Home\r\nSecretary, and cases where such action appears to him necessary in the\r\npublic interest. He may employ counsel to conduct both the cases that he\r\nbrings, and any other criminal proceedings before the high courts where\r\nno counsel has been retained; and he may also assist a private\r\nprosecutor by authorising special expenses for evidence or counsel. It\r\nis his duty to give advice to the clerks of justices of the peace, and\r\nto police officers; and, finally, he is in all these matters subject to\r\nthe control of the Attorney General.\r\n\r\nThe Director of Public Prosecutions makes to Parliament an annual report\r\nof his doings, enlivened by narratives of the most interesting cases.\r\nBut in spite of his activity the vast bulk of the prosecutions are\r\nconducted as of old under private direction; for out of the many\r\nthousands of criminal cases tried every year, only from three hundred\r\nand fifty to five hundred are in his charge, and the number shows no\r\nmarked tendency to increase.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to justify the statement that no single officer\r\nexercises any considerable part of the functions of a minister of\r\njustice. Such duties are not only divided among a number of persons, but\r\nscattered in small fragments among different departments. An\r\nillustration of this is furnished by the Return of Public Prosecutions,\r\nwhich is submitted to Parliament by the Home Secretary, and bears his\r\nsignature on the first page; while the return itself is signed by the\r\nDirector of Public Prosecutions, and dated from the Treasury. Gneist, in\r\nhis work on the English administrative system, portrays the Lord\r\nChancellor as the minister of justice for civil, and the Home Secretary\r\nfor criminal, matters,[135:1] but such a generalisation is overstrained\r\nand misleading, and it is safer to assert that when the English bring\r\nconfusion into any administrative department they usually succeed in\r\nconfounding utterly all general principles, and making all general\r\nstatements inaccurate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Church.]\r\n\r\nIf there is no minister of justice in England, still less is there a\r\nminister of religion such as is commonly found in countries that possess\r\nestablished churches. The government of the Church of England will be\r\ntreated in another chapter, and it is only necessary here to point out\r\nthat although a strictly national institution, often deeply involved in\r\npolitical controversy, the Church is in many ways singularly free from\r\nthe control of the executive government. It is, no doubt, regulated by\r\nlaws that cannot be altered without the authority of Parliament. Its\r\norganisation, its ritual, and its articles of faith can be changed only\r\nby statute. But in administrative affairs its dependence upon the state\r\nis very much less. The King is, indeed, its supreme head; he virtually\r\nappoints the bishops and other high dignitaries, and his assent is\r\nnecessary to the exercise of their limited powers by the Convocations of\r\nthe two provinces.[136:1] Beyond this, however, the Crown does not\r\ninterfere in the government of the Church, or the discipline of its\r\nmembers, which are left under the charge of its own officers.\r\nProceedings against a clergyman for doctrinal errors or violation of the\r\nritual can be taken only with the consent of the bishop, the government\r\nhaving no part in it; and although the Crown appoints a portion of the\r\nmembers of the Ecclesiastical Commission, which manages much of the\r\nChurch property, the bishops form a large majority of the body, and the\r\ncommission itself is not subordinate to any minister of state. The only\r\ncontrol, therefore, exercised by the cabinet upon the administration of\r\nthe Church is to be found in the restraint upon Convocation, and in the\r\nfact that the responsibility for the selection of high ecclesiastics\r\nrests with the Prime Minister, who, curiously enough, is not\r\nnecessarily, and in the last two cabinets actually has not been, a\r\nmember of the Church of England. The Prime Minister also nominates the\r\nincumbents of a number of large livings, while the Lord Chancellor\r\npresents to several hundred others that happen to lie in the gift of\r\nthe Crown.[137:1] Except for these things no minister is responsible for\r\nthe conduct of the Church or of its members.\r\n\r\nThe connection between Church and State in England is thus a peculiar\r\none. In some ways the relation is very close, but it is rather\r\nlegislative and judicial than administrative. The Church is minutely\r\nregulated by state laws, the judge of its principal tribunal must be\r\nconfirmed by the Crown, and appeals lie to a secular court;[137:2] but\r\nit lives upon its own revenues without any grant from Parliament, and\r\nalthough its highest officers are appointed by the state, and sit in the\r\nupper House of Parliament, yet once appointed, they, like all the rest\r\nof the clergy, are practically free from the supervision and control of\r\nthe executive government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scotland.]\r\n\r\nThese are all the public offices in the English government that it is\r\nnecessary to mention. A description of the peculiar institutions of\r\nScotland and Ireland is not within the scope of this book, except so far\r\nas they affect the central government. Until twenty years ago the\r\nconnection of the government with matters relating exclusively to\r\nScotland was maintained chiefly through the Home Office, but the Lord\r\nAdvocate was virtually the parliamentary under-secretary for Scotch\r\nbusiness, and took entire charge of it, unless his chief was a\r\nScotchman, and cared to assert himself. In 1885 a Secretary for Scotland\r\nwas created, one might perhaps say revived, and to him were intrusted\r\nfor that kingdom duties corresponding to those discharged in England by\r\nthe Home Office, the Local Government Board and the Board of Education.\r\nIn fact he may be said to be the general representative for Scotch\r\npurposes of all the various civil departments of state; and in\r\nparticular he is at the head of the Scotch Local Government Board and\r\nthe Scotch Education Department. He is not one of the secretaries of\r\nstate and receives a much smaller salary than they do, but he is a\r\nmember of the ministry, usually, though not invariably, with a seat in\r\nthe cabinet, and he is always a member of one or the other House of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the relations of England to Scotland and to Ireland\r\nis striking. By the Act of Union of 1707 England and Scotland became one\r\nstate, with a common Parliament and a common executive government, but\r\npolitical differences have not been obliterated. The Act of Union\r\npreserved the ecclesiastical and legal institutions of Scotland; and at\r\nthe present day she has her own established church, which is\r\nPresbyterian; her own system of education, which is quite different from\r\nthe English; and her own system of law, based upon the Civil not the\r\nCommon Law, and adorned by a nomenclature so disfigured as to pass for\r\nher own. With such differences as these it has been not uncommon for\r\nParliament, even where the same legislative principles were to be\r\napplied on both sides of the Tweed, to enact them in separate statutes,\r\neach adapted to the institutions of the country in which it is to\r\noperate. Socially, also, the fusion has not been complete. Every\r\nScotchman is an Englishman, but an Englishman is not a Scotchman. The\r\nScotch regard themselves as an elect race who are entitled to all the\r\nrights of Englishmen and to their own privileges besides. All English\r\noffices ought to be open to them, but Scotch posts are the natural\r\nheritage of the Scots. They take part freely in the debates on\r\nlegislation affecting England alone, but in their opinion acts confined\r\nto Scotland ought to be, and in fact they are in the main, governed by\r\nthe opinion of the Scotch members. Such a condition is due partly to the\r\nfact that Scotch institutions and ideas are sufficiently distinct from\r\nthose of England to require separate treatment, and not different enough\r\nto excite repugnance. It is due in part also to the fact that the\r\nScotch are both a homogeneous and a practical people, so that all\r\nclasses can unite in common opinions about religion, politics and social\r\njustice. The result is that Scotland is governed by Scotchmen in\r\naccordance with Scotch ideas, while Ireland has been governed by\r\nEnglishmen, and until recently, in accordance with English ideas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ireland.]\r\n\r\nThe Act of Union with Ireland in 1801 abolished the Irish Parliament,\r\nand vested the whole legislative power for the United Kingdom in the\r\njoint Parliament at Westminster; but the executive government for\r\nIreland was left at Dublin. It is conducted in the name of the Lord\r\nLieutenant as the representative of the Crown.[139:1] The work is\r\nnominally done by him in his Privy Council, subject to such instructions\r\nas may be sent to him by the English government through the Home\r\nSecretary. In practice, however, matters have worked out very\r\ndifferently, for the administration of Ireland has been far too\r\nimportant to rest under the wing of the Home Office. The Lord Lieutenant\r\nis always a great nobleman, and he is expected to keep up a vice-regal\r\nstate, sometimes at an expense exceeding his enormous salary of\r\n20,000_l._ a year; but he is not ordinarily the real head of the Irish\r\nOffice. Since 1868 he has been a member of the cabinet less than eleven\r\nyears, whereas his Chief Secretary has been in the cabinet during the\r\nwhole of that period, except from 1882 to 1885, and for three other\r\nintervals that were very brief. Moreover, the Chief Secretary is always\r\na member of the House of Commons, where he must defend the\r\nadministration of Ireland against the attacks of the Irish members, and\r\noften of the English Opposition also. Thus it has come about that the\r\nChief Secretary habitually plays the part of minister for Ireland, and\r\nis practically the ruler of the country. He is at the head of the Irish\r\nLocal Government Board, Congested Districts Board and Department of\r\nAgriculture and Technical Instruction, and in general he is held\r\nresponsible for all administration of a political character, except in\r\nthe case of the revenue and the Irish Board of Works, which are under\r\nthe direct control of the Treasury.[140:1] He possesses, indeed, not\r\nonly the authority vested in a number of ministers in England, but also\r\npowers not conferred upon them at all. During the greater part of the\r\ntime since the Union in 1801, Ireland has been subject to a long series\r\nof coercion acts, temporary in duration, but renewed at short intervals\r\nunder different names.[140:2] The provisions have varied, but the object\r\nhas always been to arm the Irish government with extraordinary and\r\narbitrary powers for the suppression of disorder. Moreover, the police\r\nof Ireland, instead of being, as in England and Scotland, under the\r\ncontrol of the local authorities, is under the direct orders of Dublin\r\nCastle. This force, the Royal Irish Constabulary, contains over twelve\r\nthousand men, a number twice as large in proportion to the population as\r\nthat of the police in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Causes of Misgovernment.]\r\n\r\nThe administration of Ireland has been the conspicuous failure of the\r\nEnglish government. Its history for a century has been a long tale of\r\nexpedients, palliations and concessions, which have never availed to\r\nsecure either permanent good order or the contentment and loyalty of the\r\ninhabitants. Each step has been taken, not of foresight, but under\r\npressure. The repressive measures have been avowedly temporary, devised\r\nto meet an emergency, not part of a permanent policy; while concessions,\r\nwhich if granted earlier might have had more effect, have only come when\r\nattention to the matter has been compelled by signs of widespread and\r\ngrievous discontent. Catholic emancipation was virtually won by the\r\nClare election; disestablishment of the Anglican Church was hastened by\r\nthe Fenian movement; the Home Rule Bill followed the growth of the Irish\r\nparliamentary party, culminating in Parnell's hold upon the balance of\r\npower in the House of Commons; and the land laws have resulted from\r\nagrarian agitation. It has been said that the same thing is true of\r\nEnglish reforms, that Parliament seldom gives redress until a wrong has\r\nbeen brought forcibly to its notice, and this is no doubt a natural if\r\nnot an inevitable result of the parliamentary form of government. It is\r\na part of the general tendency to treat symptoms rather than causes, to\r\nwhich we shall have occasion to refer again. But while Parliament, now\r\nthat all classes are represented there, is certain to be made aware of\r\nan English grievance long before it has become intolerable, it is by no\r\nmeans so keenly sensitive to an Irish one. The fact is that Irish\r\nproblems lie beyond the experience of the English member and his\r\nconstituents. Being unable to distinguish readily a real grievance from\r\nan unreasonable demand, he does not heed it until he is obliged to; and\r\nthe cabinet, with its hands already full, is not inclined to burn its\r\nfingers with matters in which the House is not deeply or generally\r\ninterested. All this is merely one of many illustrations of the truth\r\nthat parliamentary government can work well only so far as the nation\r\nitself is fairly homogeneous in its political aspirations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulty of the Problem.]\r\n\r\nBut if the parliamentary system has proved an instrument ill-fitted for\r\nruling Ireland, it is also true that the problem has been one of extreme\r\ndifficulty. English statesmen might have repeated what Lord Durham said\r\nof Canada in his famous report: \"I expected to find a contest between a\r\ngovernment and a people. I found two nations warring in the bosom of a\r\nsingle state.\"[141:1] For centuries Ireland has remained a conquered\r\nland without a thorough fusion of the victors and the vanquished; the\r\nnative stock has been subjected without being assimilated, and the\r\ndifference of race has been intensified by a difference of creed. The\r\nCelt still looks upon his Saxon landlord, and upon the Orangemen in\r\nUlster, as aliens, and upon the constabulary as the garrison of a\r\nforeign power. This has not only made the management of Ireland an\r\nexceedingly hard thing for an English government to carry on, but it\r\nalso stands in the way of any other solution of the problem. To allow\r\nthe Irish to govern themselves means putting the under dog on top and\r\nthe upper dog underneath. The difficulty has been further increased by a\r\ndeep-seated divergence in the conceptions of law and justice. Unlike\r\nScotland, Ireland has the English system of jurisprudence. Her courts\r\nare modelled on those at Westminster, and administer the English Common\r\nLaw, while most of the statutes affecting civil rights are the same.\r\nBut, as men have often pointed out, there are in times of agitation two\r\nlaws, and two governments, in the country; on one side the English law,\r\nadministered by the English government through its officials, and on the\r\nother a hostile system resting upon very different principles, and\r\napplied by an extra-legal political organisation, but in fact more\r\nvigorously enforced than the first, and often more in harmony with the\r\npopular sense of justice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Land Question.]\r\n\r\nThe divergence between the legal conceptions of the English and Irish is\r\nmost marked in the case of land. According to the ideas of Englishmen,\r\nand of Irish landlords, the land belongs to the owner, and apart from\r\nspecial statutory provisions, the tenant has only a contractual right of\r\npossession, during the continuance, and subject to the terms, of his\r\ncontract. But the tenants feel that, subject to somewhat indefinite\r\nduties towards the landlord in the way of rent, they have rights in the\r\nland, of which their forbears were robbed, and which they have reclaimed\r\nfrom the waste.[142:1] Such a difference is fundamental, and cannot be\r\nadjusted to the satisfaction of both parties. People speak of the hunger\r\nof the Irish for land, as if that were the cause of the difficulty, but\r\nthe Irishman has no general land-hunger. When he has emigrated to\r\nAmerica, instead of going, like the Swede, to the great open prairies\r\nwhere any industrious man can easily own a farm, he has settled, like\r\nthe landless Hebrew, in the great cities. What the Irish want is Irish\r\nland, and to this they think they have a right.\r\n\r\nVarious remedies for solving the relation of landlord and tenant have\r\nbeen tried. First came the Act of 1860, which based that relation\r\nstrictly upon contract, though restraining to some extent its\r\nenforcement by summary eviction. Ten years later the Act of 1870\r\nproceeded upon quite a different principle, for it extended the Ulster\r\ntenant-right over the whole country, giving to the tenant a salable\r\nproperty in his holding. It granted, even to a tenant from year to year,\r\na claim against his landlord for disturbance; and it conferred a right\r\nto compensation for past as well as future improvements. But these\r\nprovisions did not set the questions at rest. Later followed in 1881 the\r\njudicial reduction of rents,--the fixing by public authority of fair\r\nrents as they were called. But here trouble arose on both sides. If the\r\nlandlord's views were right, and the land belonged absolutely to him, it\r\nwas clearly unjust to deprive him of its market value in rent, and he\r\nwas entitled to feel that the government was giving away his property to\r\nsmooth its own political difficulties.[143:1] On the other hand, the\r\nfair rents did not end the matter for the tenant. The English, deeply\r\nimpressed with the sanctity of contract, meant the new rents to be paid\r\nas rents are paid in England; but the Irishman, living in what might\r\nalmost be called a world of status, and brought up under a system of\r\nrack rent, had far less respect for contract, and regarded rents as\r\nthings to be paid approximately rather than exactly. The result was more\r\nfriction, and a further judicial reduction in 1887. Finally, after a\r\nseries of land-purchase acts designed to promote peasant proprietorship,\r\nbut too limited in scope to affect general social conditions, had been\r\ntried, a number of landlords and some of the Irish leaders held a\r\nconference in 1902, and virtually agreed that as both parties claimed\r\nrights in the land, the government should pay the landlord for it and\r\ntransfer it to the tenant, an arrangement the more easy because by that\r\ntime the landlords' interest had fallen greatly in value. The government\r\nundertook to carry out the plan by the Land Purchase Act of 1903, making\r\nnot indeed an immediate gift, but a loan of its credit, and charging the\r\ntenant a low rent which is expected eventually to repay the advance, and\r\nleave him the owner of the land.[144:1] Since that time the purchase and\r\ndistribution of estates, under the act, has been going on, but the\r\nprocess naturally takes time, and as might be expected, it has been far\r\nmore rapid in the prosperous than in the poor parts of the country. One\r\nmay hope that by this means the land question will in time be solved,\r\nbut he must have a blind faith who believes that with it the Irish\r\nquestion will disappear.\r\n\r\nA crude outline of the land legislation has been given simply to show\r\nthe enormous difficulty of governing a country where the legal\r\nconceptions of rulers and ruled are irreconcilable, and yet that is\r\nprecisely the kind of obstacle that arises at every step in the Irish\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[131:1] He has some powers that have no relation to the law, such as the\r\nappointment to a large number of Crown livings; and in this connection\r\nit may be noted that the offices of Lord Chancellor of Great Britain and\r\nLord Lieutenant of Ireland are the only ones that cannot be held by\r\nRoman Catholics. The subject is not free from doubt. See Anson, II.,\r\n158, and the debate in 1891, Hans., 3 Ser. CCCXLIX., 1733 _et seq._ On\r\nthat occasion the House of Commons refused to remove any disability that\r\nmight exist.\r\n\r\n[132:1] The list of justices of the peace for each county is in practice\r\ndrawn up by the Lord Lieutenant, except in Lancashire, where it is made\r\nby the Chancellor of the Duchy, and that list is almost always adopted\r\nby the Lord Chancellor. No little controversy has, however, arisen of\r\nlate over this subject.\r\n\r\n[133:1] There are also a Lord Advocate and a Solicitor General for\r\nScotland, and an Attorney General and a Solicitor General for Ireland.\r\n\r\n[133:2] The salary of the Attorney General is 7000_l._; that of the\r\nSolicitor General 6000_l._; and the fees in each case amount to about\r\n1000_l._ more.\r\n\r\n[133:3] The Solicitor General for Scotland, and the Attorney and\r\nSolicitor General for Ireland, although political officers who change\r\nwith the ministry, are not always in Parliament.\r\n\r\n[134:1] See the excellent chapter on prosecution in Maitland's \"Justice\r\nand Police.\"\r\n\r\n[134:2] The prosecution is, however, in the name of the King, and the\r\nAttorney General can put a stop to it by _nolle prosequi_ if he\r\nconsiders it vexatious.\r\n\r\n[134:3] In an article in the _Fortnightly Review_ for March, 1873,\r\nentitled, \"The Organisation of a Legal Department of Government,\" Mr.\r\nBryce showed the need, and sketched the outline, for such a ministry.\r\n\r\n[134:4] 42-43 Vic., c. 22; 47-48 Vic., c. 58.\r\n\r\n[134:5] Com.

Hans., Ser.\r\nCXLIX., 1409-86.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE PERMANENT CIVIL SERVICE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sharp Distinction between Political and Non-Political\r\nOfficials.]\r\n\r\nThe history of the permanent civil service would be one of the most\r\ninstructive chapters in the long story of English constitutional\r\ndevelopment, but unfortunately it has never been written. The nation has\r\nbeen saved from a bureaucracy, such as prevails over the greater part of\r\nEurope, on the one hand, and from the American spoils system on the\r\nother, by the sharp distinction between political and non-political\r\nofficials. The former are trained in Parliament, not in administrative\r\nroutine. They direct the general policy of the government, or at least\r\nthey have the power to direct it, are entirely responsible for it, and\r\ngo out of office with the cabinet; while the non-political officials\r\nremain at their posts without regard to party changes, are thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the whole field of administration, and carry out in detail\r\nthe policy adopted by the ministry of the day. The distinction has\r\narisen gradually with the growth of the parliamentary system.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Exclusion of Non-Political Officials from Parliament.]\r\n\r\nA dread of the power of the King to control Parliament, by a\r\ndistribution of offices and pensions among its members, gave rise to a\r\nprovision, in the Act of Settlement of 1700, that after the accession of\r\nthe House of Hanover no person holding an office or place of profit\r\nunder the Crown should be capable of sitting in the House of\r\nCommons.[145:1] But before this act took effect the disadvantages of\r\nexcluding entirely from the House the great officers of state was\r\nperceived. The provision was, therefore, modified so as to shut out\r\nabsolutely only the holders of new offices created after Oct. 25, 1705,\r\nand of certain specified posts already existing. Members of the House of\r\nCommons appointed to other offices were to lose their seats, but be\r\ncapable of reelection.[146:1] As there were many old offices the number\r\nof placemen in Parliament continued large, and no sharp line was drawn\r\nat once between the great officers of state and their subordinates. But\r\ntwo processes went on which in time rendered the distinction effective.\r\nWhen a new office of a political nature was created it became the habit\r\nto make a special statutory provision permitting the holder to sit in\r\nthe House of Commons; and, on the other hand, place bills were passed\r\nfrom time to time excluding from Parliament whole classes of officials\r\nof a lower grade. These acts apply, for example, to all the clerks in\r\nmany of the government departments,[146:2] and together with the\r\nprovision excluding the holders of all new offices created since 1705,\r\nthey cover a large part of all the officials under the rank of\r\nminister.[146:3] The distinction between the offices which are and those\r\nwhich are not compatible with a seat in the House of Commons, is made\r\ncomplete by the regulations of the service itself. These cannot render\r\nvoid an election to the House which is not invalid by statute. They\r\ncannot make the holding of office a disqualification for Parliament, but\r\nthey can make a seat in Parliament a reason for the loss of office. They\r\ncan and do provide that if any civil servant intends to be a candidate\r\nhe must resign his office when he first issues his address to the\r\nelectors.[146:4]\r\n\r\nIf it were not for three or four ministers, such as the Irish Law\r\nOfficers, who are expected to get themselves elected to Parliament if\r\nthey can, but whose tenure of their positions does not depend upon their\r\ndoing so, one might say that the public service is divided into\r\npolitical officers who must sit in Parliament, and non-political\r\nofficers who must not.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Permanent Officials take no Active Part in Politics.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: But are not Disfranchised]\r\n\r\nIn a popular government, based upon party, the exclusion of the\r\nsubordinate civil servants from the legislature is an essential\r\ncondition both of their abstaining from active politics and of their\r\npermanence of tenure. But it does not by itself necessarily involve\r\neither of those results. This is clear from the example of the United\r\nStates, where office-holders of all grades are excluded from Congress by\r\nthe provisions of the Constitution, but by no means refrain from party\r\nwarfare. The keeping out of politics, however, and the permanence of\r\ntenure must, in the long run, go together; for it is manifest that\r\noffice can be held regardless of party changes only in case the holders\r\ndo not take an active part in bringing those changes to pass; and if, on\r\nthe other hand, they are doomed to lose their places on a defeat at the\r\npolls of the party in power, they will certainly do their utmost to\r\navert such a defeat. In England the abstinence and the permanence have\r\nbeen attained, and it is noteworthy that they are both secured by the\r\nforce of opinion hardening into tradition, and not by the sanction of\r\nlaw.[147:1] At one time, indeed, large classes of public servants were\r\ndeprived of the parliamentary franchise. An Act of 1782, for\r\nexample,[147:2] withdrew the right to vote from officers employed in\r\ncollecting excises, customs and other duties, and from postmasters; but\r\nthese disqualifications were removed in 1868.[147:3] The police, also,\r\nwere, by a series of acts, deprived of the franchise in the\r\nconstituencies where they held office. Except as regards Ireland,\r\nhowever, these statutes were, in their turn, repealed in 1887;[148:1]\r\nand the only disqualifications now attaching to public officials relate\r\nto such positions as those of returning officers at elections.[148:2]\r\n\r\nEngland enfranchised her officials at the very time when she was\r\nenlarging the suffrage and the number of office-holders. In some other\r\ncountries the political danger of a large class of government employees\r\nhas been keenly felt. This has been particularly true of the new\r\ndemocracies in Australia with their armies of public servants on the\r\nstate railroads; and, indeed, the pressure constantly brought to bear in\r\nthe legislature in favour of this class caused Victoria in 1903 to\r\nreadjust her election laws.[148:3] The employees of the government have\r\nnot been disfranchised altogether, but they have been deprived of the\r\nright to vote in the regular constituencies, and have been allotted one\r\nrepresentative in the legislative council and two in the assembly to be\r\nelected entirely by their own class. They have, therefore, their\r\nspokesmen in the legislature, but they are no longer able to influence\r\nthe other members as of old.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of Giving them Votes.]\r\n\r\nIn England these dangers are by no means unknown; but they have not\r\ntaken the form of work done by civil servants for purely party ends.\r\nFrom that evil the country has been almost wholly free; for although all\r\noffice-holders, not directly connected with the conduct of elections,\r\nhave now a legal right to vote, and are quite at liberty to do so, it is\r\na well-settled principle that those who are non-political--that is, all\r\nwho are not ministers--must not be active in party politics. They must\r\nnot, for example, work in a party organisation, serve on the committee\r\nof a candidate for Parliament, canvass in his interest, or make speeches\r\non general politics. All this is so thoroughly recognised that one\r\nrarely hears complaints of irregular conduct, or even of actions of a\r\ndoubtful propriety. In this connection it is worthy of note that the\r\nrevenue officers were disfranchised in 1782 at their own request. At\r\nthat time the government controlled through them seventy seats in the\r\nHouse of Commons, and Lord North sent them notice that it would go hard\r\nwith them if they did not support his party. His opponents sent them a\r\nsimilar warning, and the result was that in self-protection they sent up\r\na strong petition asking for exclusion from the franchise.[149:1] The\r\nbill to reenfranchise them was carried in 1868 against the wishes of the\r\ngovernment of the day.[149:2] But on that occasion, and in 1874, when\r\nthe acts imposing penalties upon their taking an active part at\r\nelections were repealed, it was perfectly well understood that they\r\nwould not be permitted to go into party politics, and that the\r\ngovernment was entitled to make regulations on the subject.[149:3] Those\r\nregulations are still in force,[149:4] and it is only by maintaining\r\nthem that the civil servants can continue to enjoy both permanence of\r\ntenure and the right to vote.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attempts to Improve their Position.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Dockyards.]\r\n\r\nThe danger arising from the votes of public servants has been felt in a\r\ndifferent way. While the government employees have kept clear of party\r\npolitics, they have in some cases used their electoral rights to bring\r\npressure to bear upon members of Parliament in favour of increasing\r\ntheir own pay and improving the conditions of their work. This has been\r\npeculiarly true of the dockyards. The members of the half dozen boroughs\r\nwhere the state maintains great shops for the construction and repair of\r\nwarships are always urging the interests of the workmen; and they do it\r\nwith so little regard to the national finances, or to the question\r\nwhether they are elected as supporters or opponents of the ministry,\r\nthat they have become a byword in Parliament under the name of\r\n\"dockyard-members.\"[149:5]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other Officials.]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the difficulty has not been confined to the dockyards. At\r\nthe time when the revenue and post-office employees were enfranchised,\r\nDisraeli dreaded their use of the franchise for the purpose of raising\r\ntheir salaries;[150:1] and Gladstone said he was not afraid of\r\ngovernment influence, or of an influence in favour of one political\r\nparty or another, but of class influence, \"which in his opinion was the\r\ngreat reproach of the Reformed Parliament.\"[150:2] These fears have not\r\nproved groundless. As early as 1875 it was recognised that the salaries\r\npaid by the government were above the market rate;[150:3] and ever since\r\nthe officials in the revenue and postal departments obtained the right\r\nto vote, pressure on behalf of their interests has been brought to bear\r\nby them upon members of Parliament, and by the latter upon the\r\ngovernment. Complaints of this have been constant.[150:4] It has been a\r\nsource of criticism that members should have attended meetings of civil\r\nservants held to demand an increase of pay,[150:5] and that they should\r\nreceive whips urging their attendance at the House when questions of\r\nthis sort are to come up.[150:6] Owing to the concentration of\r\ngovernment employees in London the pressure upon the metropolitan\r\nmembers is particularly severe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Recent Efforts of Postal Officials for More Pay.]\r\n\r\nFor nearly a score of years a continuous effort has been made in\r\nParliament to secure the appointment of a committee to inquire into the\r\npay of postal and telegraph employees, and into grievances which are\r\nsaid to exist in the service. The government has in part yielded, in\r\npart resisted; but in trying to prevent pressure upon members of\r\nParliament, it took at one time a step that furnished a fresh cause of\r\ncomplaint. The story of this movement illustrates forcibly the dangers\r\nof the situation. In 1892 the Postmaster General, Sir James Fergusson,\r\ncalled the attention of the House of Commons to a circular addressed by\r\nan association of telegraph clerks to candidates at the general\r\nelection, asking whether if elected they would vote for a committee to\r\ninquire into the working of the service.[151:1] He then sent to the\r\nclerks an official warning that it is improper for government employees\r\nto try to extract promises from candidates with reference to their pay\r\nor duties.[151:2] Nevertheless two of the clerks, Clery and Cheesman,\r\nwho had been chairman and secretary of the meeting which had voted to\r\nissue the circular, signed a statement that the notice by the Postmaster\r\nGeneral \"does not affect the policy of the Association.\" Immediately\r\nafter the election these two men were dismissed.[151:3] That became a\r\ngrievance in itself, and year after year attempts were made in\r\nParliament to have them reinstated. Shortly after they had been\r\ndismissed Mr. Gladstone came into office; and he made a vague statement\r\nto the effect that the government intended to place no restraint upon\r\nthe civil servants beyond the rule forbidding them to take an active\r\npart in political contests.[151:4] But it would seem that Fergusson's\r\nwarning circular was not cancelled,[151:5] and certainly Clery and\r\nCheesman were not taken back.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Demand for a Parliamentary Committee.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pressure Brought to Bear.]\r\n\r\nThe motions for a parliamentary committee to inquire into the conditions\r\nof the service were kept up; and in 1895 the government gave way so far\r\nas to appoint a commission, composed mainly of officials drawn from\r\nvarious departments, which reported in 1897 recommending some increases\r\nof pay both in the postal and in the telegraph service. These were at\r\nonce adopted, and in fact further concessions were made shortly\r\nafterward, but still the agitation did not cease. The employees would be\r\nsatisfied with nothing but a parliamentary committee, no doubt for the\r\nsame reason that led the government to refuse it, namely the pressure to\r\nwhich members of Parliament were subject,[152:1] and the additional\r\nforce that pressure would have if brought to a focus upon the persons\r\nselected to serve on a committee.[152:2] Year after year grievances on\r\none side, and on the other charges of almost intolerable pressure were\r\nrepeated. In 1898 the interest centred in a motion to the effect that\r\npublic servants in the Post Office were deprived of their political\r\nrights. A long debate took place in which the whole history of the\r\nsubject was reviewed,[152:3] and Hanbury, the Financial Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, exclaimed, \"We have done away with personal and individual\r\nbribery, but there is a still worse form of bribery, and that is when a\r\nman asks a candidate to buy his vote out of the public purse.\"[152:4] In\r\n1903 Mr. Austen Chamberlain stated that members had come to him, not\r\nfrom one side of the House alone, to seek from him, in his position as\r\nPostmaster General, protection in the discharge of their public duties\r\nagainst the pressure sought to be put upon them by the employees of the\r\nPost Office.[152:5] He consented, however, to appoint a commission of\r\nbusiness men to advise him about the wages of employees; but again there\r\nwas a protest against any committee of inquiry not composed of members\r\nof Parliament.[152:6] The report of the commission was followed in 1904\r\nby a debate of the usual character.[152:7] Finally in 1906 the new\r\nLiberal ministry yielded, and a select committee was appointed.[152:8]\r\n\r\nThere are now employed in the postal and telegraph services about two\r\nhundred thousand persons, who have votes enough, when organised, to be\r\nan important factor at elections in many constituencies, and to turn the\r\nscale in some of them. If their influence is exerted only to raise wages\r\nin a service recruited by competitive examination,[153:1] the evil is\r\nnot of the first magnitude; but it is not difficult to perceive that\r\nsuch a power might be used in directions highly detrimental to the\r\nstate. There is no reason to expect the pressure to grow less, and\r\nmutterings are sometimes heard about the necessity of taking the\r\nfranchise away from government employees. That would be the only\r\neffective remedy, and the time may not be far distant when it will have\r\nto be considered seriously.\r\n\r\nAs we shall have occasion to see hereafter, the pressure in behalf of\r\nindividuals is comparatively small, and it is characteristic of modern\r\nEnglish parliamentary government that political influence should be used\r\nto promote class rather than personal interests.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Permanence of Tenure of Officials.]\r\n\r\nPermanence of tenure in the English civil service, like the abstinence\r\nfrom partly politics, is secured by custom, not by law, for the\r\nofficials with whom we are concerned here are appointed during pleasure,\r\nand can legally be dismissed at any time for any cause. Now, although\r\nthe removal, for partisan motives, of officials who would be classed\r\nto-day as permanent and non-political, has not been altogether unknown\r\nin England, yet it was never a general practice. The reason that the\r\nspoils system--that is, the wholesale discharge of officials on a change\r\nof party--obtained no foothold is not to be found in any peculiarly\r\nexalted sense, inherent in the British character, that every public\r\noffice is a sacred trust. That conception is of comparatively modern\r\norigin; for in the eighteenth century the abuse of patronage, and even\r\nthe grosser forms of political corruption, were shamelessly practised.\r\nIt is rather to be sought in quite a different sentiment, the sentiment\r\nthat a man has a vested interest in the office that he holds. This\r\nfeeling is constantly giving rise, both in public and private affairs,\r\nto a demand for the compensation of persons displaced or injured by a\r\nchange of methods which seems strange to a foreigner.[154:1] The claim\r\nby publicans for compensation when their licenses are not renewed, a\r\nclaim recognised by the Act of 1904, is based upon the same sentiment\r\nand causes the traveller to inquire how any one can, as the result of a\r\nlicense ostensibly temporary, have a vested right to help other people\r\nto get drunk.\r\n\r\nThe habit of discharging officials on party grounds never having become\r\nestablished, it was not unnatural that with the growth of the\r\nparliamentary system the line between the changing political chiefs and\r\ntheir permanent subordinates should be more and more clearly marked, and\r\nthis process has gone on until at the present day the dismissal of the\r\nlatter on political grounds is practically unheard of, either in\r\nnational or local administration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Former Party Patronage.]\r\n\r\nWhile the discharge of public servants on political grounds never became\r\na settled custom in England, such vacancies as occurred in the natural\r\ncourse of events were freely used in former times to confer favours on\r\npolitical and personal friends, or to reward party services. Such a\r\npractice was regarded as obvious, and it continued unchecked until after\r\nthe first Reform Act. It was particularly bad in Ireland, where Peel,\r\nwho was Chief Secretary from 1812 to 1818, took great credit to himself\r\nfor breaking up the habit of treating the Irish patronage as the\r\nperquisite of the leading families, and for dispensing it on public\r\ngrounds, that is, using it to secure political support for the party in\r\npower.[155:1] That the patronage was used for the same purpose in\r\nEngland at that period may be seen in the reports and evidence laid\r\nbefore Parliament in 1855, 1860 and 1873 after a different system had\r\nbegun to take its place.[155:2] It was no doubt an effective means of\r\nprocuring political service, and Lord John Russell speaks of the Tories\r\nin 1819 as apparently invincible from long possession of government\r\npatronage, spreading over the Church, the Law, the Army, the Navy, and\r\nthe colonies.[155:3] The support most needed by the ministry was that of\r\nmembers of the House of Commons, and they received in return places for\r\nconstituents who had been, or might become, influential at elections.\r\nThus it came about that the greater part of the appointments, especially\r\nto local offices, were made through the members of Parliament.[155:4]\r\nThe system hampered the efficiency of administration, and harassed the\r\nministers. Writing in 1829, the Duke of Wellington used words that might\r\nhave been applied to other countries at a later time,--\"The whole system\r\nof the patronage of the government,\" he wrote, \"is in my opinion\r\nerroneous. Certain members claim a right to dispose of everything that\r\nfalls vacant within the town or county which they represent; and this is\r\nso much a matter of right that they now claim the patronage whether they\r\nsupport upon every occasion, or now and then, or when not required, or\r\nentirely oppose; and in fact the only question about local patronage is\r\nwhether it shall be given to the disposal of one gentleman or\r\nanother.\"[156:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Introduction of Examinations.]\r\n\r\nAt last a revulsion of feeling took place. Between 1834 and 1841 pass\r\nexaminations, which discarded utterly incompetent candidates, were\r\nestablished in some of the departments, and in several cases even\r\ncompetitive examinations were introduced. But the great impulse toward a\r\nnew method of appointment dates from 1853, and it came from two\r\ndifferent quarters. In that year the charter of the East India Company\r\nwas renewed, and Parliament was not disposed to continue the privilege\r\nhitherto enjoyed by the directors of making appointments to\r\nHaileybury--the preparatory school for the civil service in India. A\r\ncommission, with Macaulay at its head, reported in the following year\r\nthat appointments to the Indian service ought to be made on the basis of\r\nan open competitive examination of a scholastic character. The plan was\r\nat once adopted, Haileybury was abandoned, and with some changes in\r\ndetail, the system of examination recommended by the commission has been\r\nin operation ever since.[156:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Open Competition.]\r\n\r\nIn 1853, also, Sir Stafford Northcote and Sir Charles Trevelyan, who\r\nwere selected by Mr. Gladstone to inquire into the condition of the\r\ncivil service in England, reported in favour of a system of appointment\r\nby open competitive examination. The new method met with far more\r\nopposition at home than in India, and made its way much more slowly.\r\nForeseeing obstacles in the House of Commons, Lord Palmerston's\r\ngovernment determined to proceed, not by legislation, but by executive\r\norder, resorting to Parliament only for the necessary appropriation. An\r\nOrder in Council was accordingly made on May 21, 1855,[156:3] creating a\r\nbody of three Civil Service Commissioners,[156:4] who were to examine\r\nall candidates for the junior positions in the various departments of\r\nthe civil service. The reform was not at the outset very radical, for\r\npolitical nomination was not abolished, and the examinations--not\r\nnecessarily competitive--were to be arranged in accordance with the\r\ndesires of the heads of the different departments. The change could\r\nprogress, therefore, only so fast as the ministers in charge of the\r\nvarious state offices might be convinced of its value; but from this\r\ntime the new method gained favour steadily with high administrative\r\nofficials, with Parliament and with the public. In 1859[157:1] it was\r\nenacted that (except for appointments made directly by the Crown, and\r\nposts where professional or other peculiar qualifications were required)\r\nno person thereafter appointed should, for the purpose of superannuation\r\npensions, be deemed to have served in the permanent civil service of the\r\nstate unless admitted with a certificate from the Civil Service\r\nCommissioners. In 1860 a parliamentary committee reported that limited\r\ncompetition ought to supersede mere pass examinations, and that open\r\ncompetition, which does away entirely with the privilege of nomination,\r\nwas better than either.[157:2] The committee, however, did not think the\r\ntime ripe for taking this last step, and the general principle of open\r\ncompetition was not established until June 4, 1870. An Order in Council\r\nof that date,[157:3] which is still the basis of the system of\r\nexaminations, provides that (except for offices to which the holder is\r\nappointed directly by the Crown, situations filled by promotion, and\r\npositions requiring professional or other peculiar qualifications, where\r\nthe examinations may be wholly or partly dispensed with) no person shall\r\nbe employed in any department of the civil service until he has been\r\ntested by the Civil Service Commissioners, and reported by them\r\nqualified to be admitted on probation.[157:4] It provides further that\r\nthe appointments named in Schedule A, annexed to the Order, must be\r\nmade by open competitive examination; and this list has been extended\r\nfrom time to time until it covers the greater part of the positions\r\nwhere the work does not require peculiar qualifications, or is not of a\r\nconfidential nature, or of a distinctly inferior or manual character\r\nlike that of attendants, messengers, workmen, etc.[158:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Test of Capacity rather than Fitness.]\r\n\r\nSince the general introduction of open competition, by the Order in\r\nCouncil of 1870, two tendencies have been at work which are not\r\nunconnected. The first is towards simplification, by grouping positions\r\nthat have similar duties into large classes, with a single competition\r\nfor each class, and thus diminishing the number of examinations for\r\nseparate positions.[158:2] The second is the tendency so to examine the\r\ncandidates as to test their general ability and attainments, and hence\r\ntheir capacity to become useful in the positions assigned to them,\r\nrather than the technical knowledge they possess.[159:1] This\r\ndistinction marks an important difference between the system of civil\r\nservice examinations as it exists in the United States, and the form\r\nwhich the system has assumed in England. For in the United States the\r\nobject is almost entirely to discover the immediate fitness of the\r\ncandidates for the work they are expected to do; in England the object\r\nin most cases is to measure what their ability to do the work will be\r\nafter they have learned it. The difference arises partly from the fact\r\nthat in America the examinations were superimposed upon a custom of\r\nrotation in office and spoils, while in England permanence of tenure was\r\nalready the rule; and partly from the fact that the system is applied in\r\nAmerica mainly to positions requiring routine or clerical work, whereas\r\nin England it affects also positions involving, directly or\r\nprospectively, a much greater amount of discretion and responsibility.\r\nNow, it is clear that if men are to be selected young for a lifelong\r\ncareer, especially if that career involves responsible administrative\r\nwork, any acquaintance with the details of the duties to be performed,\r\nand any present fitness for the position, are of far less consequence\r\nthan a thorough education, keen intelligence and capacity for\r\ndevelopment. Proceeding upon this assumption, Macaulay's commission on\r\nthe Indian Civil Service laid down two principles: first, that young men\r\nadmitted to that service ought to have the best general education\r\nEngland could give; and, second, that ambitious men should not be led to\r\nspend time in special study which would be useless if they were not\r\nsuccessful in the competition. The commission urged, therefore, that the\r\nexaminations should be closely fitted to the studies pursued in the\r\nEnglish universities. This plan was adopted, and although at one time\r\nthe age of admission, and with it the standard, was lowered, they were\r\nafterwards restored; and the same principle is now also applied to the\r\nhigher grades in the home service. For the lower positions in that\r\nservice, where the work is of a clerical nature, and hence less\r\ndiscretion and responsibility are involved, it was formerly the habit to\r\nmake the examinations more of a test of immediate preparation for the\r\nduties of the office; but this, as we shall see, has recently been\r\nreplaced by a system based upon Macaulay's ideas, though applied, of\r\ncourse, to an inferior scale of education.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Different Grades in the Civil Service.]\r\n\r\nThe permanent officials of a typical department comprise a permanent\r\nunder-secretary at the head, and one or more assistant under-secretaries\r\nand chiefs of branches. These offices are treated as not subject to\r\nexamination under the Order of 1870, either because they are filled by\r\npromotion, or on the ground that the positions require peculiar\r\nqualifications.[160:1] As a matter of fact such posts are by no means\r\nalways filled by promotion, and persons are sometimes selected for them\r\nwho are outside of the service altogether. Next in rank come the\r\nprincipal clerks; but they are recruited entirely by promotion from the\r\nfirst-class clerks, who are, therefore, the highest grade of officials\r\nentering the service by competitive examination. Below them are the men\r\nnow properly called clerks of the second division, although the title of\r\nthis class of civil servants has been changed so often that one finds\r\nstrange variations of nomenclature in the different departments. Below\r\nthese again come the assistant clerks (abstractor class), and finally\r\nthe boy clerks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Origin.]\r\n\r\nThe sharp separation of the clerks into classes, with distinct\r\nexaminations for each class, did not arise at once. The first\r\nexaminations under the original order of 1855 were required only for a\r\n\"junior situation in any department,\" and they were not the same in the\r\ndifferent departments. They were elementary affairs,[161:1] evidently\r\ndesigned to sift out incompetence rather than to test superiority; for\r\nit must be observed that in only a very small proportion of these\r\nexaminations was there even a limited competition.[161:2] When, however,\r\nthe Order of 1870 extended the admission examinations to all positions\r\nin the service, not specially excepted or filled by promotion, and set\r\nup the principle of open competition, it became necessary to distinguish\r\nbetween the higher posts, involving discretionary powers and requiring a\r\nliberal education, and the lower ones where the duties are of a clerical\r\nkind; to distinguish, in other words, between the administrator and the\r\nclerk. Such a distinction was made by the commissioners in their\r\nearliest regulations under the Order of 1870,[161:3] the two classes\r\nbeing recruited separately by examinations of different character, the\r\nfirst of which was adapted to university graduates, and the second to\r\nyoung men from commercial life. At the outset the line was drawn\r\nsomewhat at haphazard without sufficient attention to the real nature of\r\nthe work to be done, and it was readjusted several times before it\r\nassumed its present form.[161:4]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Exceptional Positions.]\r\n\r\nAside from the regular grades of clerks recruited by open competition,\r\nthere are various kinds of inspectors, clerks and other special\r\nofficials, appointed after open competition, limited competition, pass\r\nexamination or no examination at all. In fact the departments are full\r\nof anomalies, some of them the necessary result of peculiar conditions\r\nof service, and others due apparently to no very rational cause. The\r\nreader will, no doubt, be sufficiently wearied by a description of the\r\nmore common methods of examination, without going into the\r\neccentricities of the system. It may be convenient to consider first the\r\nopen competitions, and then the appointments that are made in other\r\nways.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The First-class Clerkships.]\r\n\r\nThe highest posts in the permanent civil service to which admission is\r\nobtained by competitive examination are known as the first-class\r\nclerkships. In 1895 the examinations for these positions and for the\r\nIndian Civil Service were consolidated, and in the following year those\r\nfor the Eastern Cadets[162:1] were added; so that a single annual\r\ncompetition is now the gateway to all three careers, the successful\r\ncandidates being allowed, in the order of their rank at the\r\nexamination, to choose the service they will enter. In spite of the\r\nsmaller pay the first men on the list have usually selected the home\r\nservice, because the life is more agreeable; and so far as the vacancies\r\nmake it possible they are assigned to the particular department they\r\nprefer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Entrance Examinations.]\r\n\r\nAlthough these positions are called clerkships, the work is not of a\r\nclerical, but of an administrative, and in the upper grades of a highly\r\nresponsible, character. The aim of the commissioners is, therefore, to\r\nrecruit young men of thorough general education for an important and\r\nlifelong administrative career. With this object the candidates are\r\nrequired to be between twenty-two and twenty-four years of age, and the\r\nexamination, which has no direct connection with their subsequent\r\nduties, is closely fitted to the courses of study in the universities.\r\nAs a matter of fact the papers in mathematics and natural science are\r\nbased upon the requirements for honour degrees at Cambridge, the papers\r\nin classical and other subjects upon those at Oxford; and thus it\r\nhappens that by far the larger part of the successful candidates come\r\nfrom one or other of these two great universities.[163:1] The range of\r\nsubjects is naturally large, and a candidate is allowed to offer as many\r\nas he pleases, but by an ingenious system of marking a thorough\r\nknowledge of a few subjects is made to yield a higher aggregate of marks\r\nthan a superficial acquaintance with a larger number.[163:2] The\r\nexamination papers are set, and the books are read, by well-known\r\nscholars, instructors at the universities and others, who are selected\r\nfor the purpose. That the papers are severe any one may convince\r\nhimself by looking at them. Moreover the number of candidates, which is\r\ntwo or three times as large as the vacancies in all three services\r\ntogether, insures a rigorous competition; and the result is that the\r\ncandidates who win the appointments are men of education and\r\nintellectual power. They belong to the type that forms the kernel of the\r\nprofessions; and many of them enter the civil service simply because\r\nthey have not the means to enable them to wait long enough to achieve\r\nsuccess in a professional career. They form an excellent corps of\r\nadministrators, although the time has not come to express an opinion on\r\nthe question whether they will prove the best material from which to\r\ndraw the permanent under-secretaries and the other staff officers at the\r\nhead of the different services. As yet few of them have attained\r\npositions of this grade, but it must be remembered that they have only\r\nrecently begun to reach an age when they could be expected to do so.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Social Effect.]\r\n\r\nWhen the government was considering the introduction of competitive\r\nexaminations, in 1854, fears were expressed that such a system would\r\nresult in driving the aristocracy out of the civil service, and\r\nreplacing it by a lower social class.[164:1] Mr. Gladstone himself did\r\nnot share that belief. On the contrary, he thought the plan would give\r\nto the highly educated class a stronger hold than ever upon the higher\r\npositions in the service.[164:2] In this he proved a better prophet than\r\nhis critics. By far the greater part of the successful competitors for\r\nthe Class I clerkships now come, as we have seen, from Oxford and\r\nCambridge; and the men educated at those universities are still drawn\r\nchiefly from the upper classes, from the aristocracy, the gentry, the\r\nsons of clergymen, of lawyers, of doctors, and of rich merchants who\r\nhave made, or who hope to make, their way into the higher strata of\r\nsociety. Men of more humble extraction go, as a rule, to the provincial\r\ncolleges. The Civil Service Commissioners have given in some of their\r\nannual reports the occupations of the fathers of the successful\r\ncandidates at the chief open competitions; and while in the case of the\r\njoint examination for the Class I clerkships and the Indian Civil\r\nService the list includes no peers, and does include some tradesmen, yet\r\non the whole it consists of persons belonging to the upper and the upper\r\nmiddle class. Thus it has come about that competitive examinations,\r\ninstead of having a levelling tendency, by throwing the service open to\r\na crowd of quick-witted youths without breeding, has helped to\r\nstrengthen the hold of the upper classes upon the government, by\r\nreserving most of the important posts for men trained in the old\r\naristocratic seats of learning. In this connection it may be observed\r\nthat the highest positions in the civil service are often held by men of\r\nnoble blood, and it has sometimes happened that the permanent\r\nunder-secretary has been a man of higher social position than his\r\npolitical chief. Sir Robert Herbert and Sir Courtenay Boyle, for\r\nexample, who were recently the permanent heads of the Colonial Office\r\nand the Board of Trade, were scions of ancient families in England and\r\nIreland; and the latter had at one time as his political chief Mr.\r\nMundella, who had begun life as a printer's devil.[165:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Second Division Clerkships.]\r\n\r\nRanking below the Class I clerkships, there is a large body of persons\r\nwhose work is mainly clerical. These are known as the second division\r\nclerks, and they are recruited by open competition. The standard of\r\neducation required by the examination is naturally much less high than\r\nin the case of the first-class clerks, and the candidates are\r\nconsequently younger, the competition being now limited to youths\r\nbetween seventeen and twenty years of age.[165:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nature of Examinations.]\r\n\r\nAs the work done by the second division is of the same general character\r\nas that performed by clerks in commercial houses, the examination was at\r\nfirst devised on the supposition that the candidates would have a\r\ncommercial training, and it was adapted to test their immediate fitness\r\nfor that work. Besides the elementary general subjects of writing,\r\nEnglish composition, arithmetic, geography and English history, it\r\ncovered copying, indexing, digesting returns and bookkeeping. Such a\r\ntest was not inappropriate in the earlier days, when appointments were\r\nmade by nomination and the object of the examination was simply to\r\neliminate individual appointees who were unfit for their duties; but it\r\nwas continued long after the system of open competition, with its crowd\r\nof eager young candidates almost devoid of actual commercial training,\r\nhad brought in a very different state of things. In 1896 the Association\r\nof Head Masters pointed out, in a memorandum, the bad effect produced on\r\ngeneral education. They showed that, in order to improve their chance of\r\nsuccess, boys were prematurely taken from school and placed in the hands\r\nof crammers to acquire \"a high degree of polish upon a rather low though\r\nuseful order of accomplishment\"; and they asked that the examination\r\nmight be brought more into line with the curriculum of the schools. This\r\nwas done, without giving up the former methods altogether, by\r\nintroducing a number of options, so that a candidate need offer only the\r\nsubjects ordinarily taught in a secondary school.[166:1] The result in\r\nthe future will no doubt be to make proficiency in regular school work\r\nthe real test for appointment, and thus, in accordance with Macaulay's\r\nprinciple, to base the selection upon general education instead of\r\ntechnical knowledge.\r\n\r\nUnlike the first-class clerks, the clerks of the second division are\r\ndrawn mainly from the middle and lower middle classes, and their\r\neducation has been obtained in the grammar schools and other schools of\r\na similar kind. Although a distinct corps, recruited by a different\r\nexamination, and intended for a lower grade of work, they are not\r\naltogether cut off from the higher positions. After eight years of\r\nservice they can, in exceptional cases, be promoted to first-class\r\nclerkships, and this is sometimes done. But as the number of second\r\ndivision clerks appointed each year is about three hundred, and the\r\nnumber promoted to first-class clerkships is on the average only about\r\nfour, the chance of reaching that grade is very small.[167:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assistant Clerks.]\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years a new grade, called assistant clerks\r\n(abstractor class), has been formed, recruited at present by competitive\r\nexaminations among the boy clerks. The work is chiefly in the nature of\r\ncopying, but an assistant clerk may for special merit be appointed to\r\nthe second division without competing in the examination.[167:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Boy Clerks.]\r\n\r\nThe lowest grade of officials recruited in common for a number of\r\ndepartments is that of boy clerks.[167:3] These come from much the same\r\nclass in the community as the clerks of the second division, and the\r\ncompetitive examination, though more elementary, is of the same\r\ncharacter,[167:4] the limits of age being fifteen and seventeen years.\r\nThe employment is essentially temporary, and in fact boy clerks are not\r\nretained after they are twenty; but the position is a step towards\r\nfurther advancement, for the boy clerks alone can compete for the\r\nassistant clerkships, and if they go into the examination for the second\r\ndivision a credit for the service they have done is added to the marks\r\nthey obtain. Yet the examination for boy clerks is one of the few\r\ncompetitions for a large number of positions, where the quantity of\r\ncandidates is insufficient.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other Competitive Examinations.]\r\n\r\nBesides the open competitions for the general grades of clerks, there\r\nare many others for special classes of employees in the different\r\ndepartments. Some of these positions require no peculiar qualifications,\r\nand there is no obvious reason for having a number of separate\r\nexaminations differing slightly from one another; but certain\r\ndepartments still cling to their own schemes, and the Post Office to\r\nseveral schemes. All this is being gradually simplified, by having the\r\nsame examination for a number of distinct services, that for the second\r\ndivision clerks, for example, being now used for recruiting the clerks\r\nin the Custom House.[168:1] The examinations for the second division\r\ncould, probably, be combined with those for clerks in the Customs and\r\nInland Revenue, just as a combination has been made in the case of the\r\nfirst-class clerkships, the Indian Civil Service and the Eastern\r\nCadets--and that will, no doubt, be the tendency in the future. The same\r\ncriticism does not, of course, apply to all the examinations. Some of\r\nthem require very different degrees of education; for others, such as\r\nthose for draughtsmen, law clerks, and many more, professional or\r\ntechnical training is obviously necessary; while certain positions are\r\nreserved for women. Each of these examinations is governed by\r\nregulations prescribing the age of the candidates, the fee to be paid,\r\nand the subjects included, but it is clearly needless for our purpose to\r\nfollow them in detail.[168:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Limited Competition.]\r\n\r\nIn most of the departments there are positions in the permanent civil\r\nservice not filled by competition, because the kind of experience and\r\ncapacity needed cannot be tested, or fully tested, by examination; and\r\nin that case the examination may be wholly or partially dispensed with\r\nunder Clause VII of the Order in Council of 1870. There are other\r\npositions where open competition is inapplicable because the places to\r\nbe filled are not numerous enough, or sufficiently tempting, to attract\r\ncompetitors at large; or, because, as in the case of the higher class\r\nclerks in the Foreign Office, of attaches of legation, and of inspectors\r\nof various kinds, the work is of a delicate and confidential nature, and\r\ncan be intrusted only to persons whose character is well known. In such\r\ncases it is common to have competitive examinations limited to\r\ncandidates selected for the purpose.[169:1] Even a limited competition\r\nhas a tendency to raise the standard, but it must be remembered that in\r\norder to obtain a chance to compete in such cases some influence, direct\r\nor indirect, is indispensable; although the power of nomination does\r\nnot, in fact, appear to be abused for political purposes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nomination with a Pass Examination.]\r\n\r\nThere are positions for which no competition is held, but where a single\r\nperson is nominated subject to an examination to test his competence.\r\nSome of these places might very well be open to competition, and,\r\nindeed, there are still strange anomalies in various branches of the\r\ncivil service; the strangest being the fact that the employees of the\r\nEducation Department are, almost invariably, appointed without any\r\nexamination at all, and this is true not only of inspectors, whose work\r\nrequires peculiar qualifications, but even of clerks of the abstractor\r\nclass. There are, however, positions in the civil service where the\r\ntechnical knowledge or experience needed are really such as to render a\r\ncompetition difficult. Even in manual occupations this is believed to be\r\nthe case. In the royal dockyards, for example, although the apprentices\r\nare recruited by open competition, the artificers are appointed subject\r\nto a pass examination touching only their skill in their trade, while\r\nthe foremen are usually selected by a limited competition which includes\r\nsomething more. Provincial postmasters also form a class by themselves.\r\nUntil a few years ago they owed their positions to political influence;\r\nfor long after the members of Parliament had lost all control over other\r\nappointments, they retained the power to fill any vacancies that might\r\noccur in the postal service within their constituencies, provided, of\r\ncourse, they belonged to the party in power. But this last remnant of\r\nparliamentary patronage was abolished in 1896, and provincial\r\npostmasters are now appointed on the recommendation of the surveyors of\r\nthe postal districts.[170:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nomination without Examination.]\r\n\r\nFinally there are the appointments made entirely without examination of\r\nany kind, either because examination is dispensed with under Clause VII\r\nof the Order in Council of 1870, or because the position is one excepted\r\naltogether from the operation of the Order. Such posts are chiefly at\r\nthe top or at the bottom of the service. They include positions of\r\nresponsibility at one end of the scale; and those of messengers,[170:2]\r\nporters and servants at the other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Promotions.]\r\n\r\nPolitical influence has not only ceased almost entirely to affect\r\nappointments to office, but it has also been very nearly eliminated in\r\nthe matter of promotion. The struggle on this subject began as early as\r\n1847, and the government has been strong enough to declare that an\r\neffort to bring influence to bear will be treated as an offence on the\r\npart of the employee; or as the minutes adopted by the Treasury in 1867,\r\nand by the Admiralty a couple of years later, ingeniously and forcibly\r\nexpress it, the attempt by a public officer to support his application\r\nby any solicitation on the part of members of Parliament, or other\r\npersons of influence, \"will be treated . . . as an admission on the part\r\nof such officer that his case is not good upon its merits.\"[171:1]\r\nThese measures seem to have had the desired effect.[171:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why the Civil Service was Easily Freed from Political\r\nInfluence.]\r\n\r\nIf we seek to understand how it happened that the baneful influence of\r\npolitical patronage in the civil service, which had been dominant in\r\nEngland in the eighteenth century, was thrown off with comparative ease\r\na hundred years later, while in some other nations that influence was,\r\nat the same period, growing in strength, and has proved extremely\r\ntenacious; if we seek to explain this contrast, we must take account of\r\na striking peculiarity of English public life at the present day that\r\nhas come with the evolution of the parliamentary system. For reasons\r\nthat will be discussed hereafter a member of the majority of the House\r\nof Commons votes on the side of the government with singular constancy;\r\nand as compared with most other countries under a popular form of\r\ngovernment politics turn to an unusual extent upon public questions. The\r\nHouse is engaged in almost ceaseless battles between the two front\r\nbenches with the ranks of their followers marshalled behind them; and\r\nthe battles are over public matters. Questions affecting private,\r\npersonal or local interests occupy a relatively small share of the\r\nattention of the member of Parliament. He is primarily the\r\nrepresentative of a national party elected to support or oppose the\r\ncabinet, rather than the delegate of a district sent to watch over the\r\ninterests of his constituents, and push the claims of influential\r\nelectors. The defence, said to have been triumphantly made elsewhere, by\r\na member accused of absence from important divisions, that he had\r\nprocured more favours for his constituency than any other\r\nrepresentative, could not be pleaded as an excuse in England. Hence the\r\nministry is not compelled to enlist personal support either in the\r\nlegislature or at the polls, by an appeal to private gratitude. It can\r\nafford to turn a deaf ear to solicitations for patronage, and stand\r\nupon its public policy alone. In short, the enormous strength of party,\r\nin the legitimate sense of a body of men combined for a common public\r\nobject, has enabled the government to do what it could not have done so\r\neasily had party required the support of artificial props. The political\r\ncondition that has strengthened the government for this work is not in\r\nitself an unmixed good. It brings with it evils, which will be noticed\r\nin due course; but to its credit must be placed the purification of the\r\ncivil service.\r\n\r\nAt the outset ministers feared that the change would meet with\r\nresistance in Parliament, but using one's influence to procure favours\r\nfor others is not a wholly agreeable task, especially when more\r\nsupplicants are disappointed than gratified. The reform brought to the\r\nHouse of Commons relief from pressure by importunate constituents, and\r\nall the later steps have been taken with the approval of the members\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pensions.]\r\n\r\nWith the elimination of politics the civil service has become a career,\r\nsteady and free from risk. But the salaries are not high in relation to\r\nthe capacity required, and as a rule they begin low with a small\r\nincrement for each year of service. They are not large enough to provide\r\nfor illness and old age; and, hence, along with the progress of reform\r\nthere grew up a demand for pensions. The law on the subject, although\r\nfrequently amended, is still based upon the Superannuation Act of 1859,\r\nwhich grants to \"persons who shall have served in an established\r\ncapacity in the permanent civil service of the state\" for ten years, and\r\nretire at sixty years of age or by reason of infirmity, a pension equal\r\nto ten sixtieths of their final salary. For every additional year of\r\nservice another sixtieth is added up to a maximum of forty sixtieths.\r\nProvision has been made, also, for the case of injuries received in the\r\npublic service; while more recent statutes have authorised gratuities to\r\nwomen employees upon marriage--an allowance apparently given, as in the\r\ncase of the other grants, rather in a spirit of commiseration, than in\r\norder to encourage matrimony.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[145:1] 12-13 Will.

The Order of 1870 requires a certificate\r\nof qualification from the Civil Service Commissioners as a condition of\r\nemployment in \"any situation or appointment in any department of the\r\ncivil service,\" not specially excepted from the operation of the Order.\r\nThe exceptions were enumerated in Schedule B, and are those described in\r\nthe parenthesis of the sentence to which this is a note. The order\r\noriginally applied, therefore, to all other positions whatever their\r\nnature; but by Sec. 8 the chief authorities of any department were given\r\npower, with the concurrence of the Treasury, to add to the schedules, or\r\nwithdraw situations therefrom; and this power has been used to add to\r\nSchedule B, and thus exempt from examination altogether a number of\r\npositions, almost exclusively menial, such as those of messengers,\r\nporters, charwomen, etc. The Orders in Council and Treasury Minutes\r\nrelating to the civil service may be found at the end of the Civil\r\nService Year Book.\r\n\r\n[158:1] Schedule A at first contained a list, not of situations, but of\r\ndepartments; so that the system of open competition applied to all the\r\npositions (not specially expected) in some departments, and to none of\r\nthose in others. This irrational classification recurs constantly in the\r\nhistory of the civil service examinations, but in the case of open\r\ncompetitions it has been changed under the reserved power to modify\r\nSchedule A. Clerkships, and other posts, in departments not previously\r\nincluded, have been added to the schedule; while large classes of\r\nsituations have been withdrawn therefrom. These are, for the most part,\r\nmanual occupations, such as office keepers, messengers, porters,\r\nforemen, artisans, labourers, matrons and domestic servants. Some of\r\nthem, as explained in the preceding note, have been exempted from\r\nexamination altogether, and for the rest the candidates are nominated\r\nsubject to a pass examination, or a limited competition. The\r\nrequirements in the case of the more important classes among them will\r\nbe described in a later part of this chapter.\r\n\r\n[158:2] _Cf._ 45 Rep. Civil Serv. Comrs., Com.

The commission found that in fact the examination was\r\nnot in general required. (Com. Papers, 1875, XXIII., 1, p. 6.)\r\n\r\n[161:1] They covered reading, writing and arithmetic, often dictation,\r\nprecis, geography, English history, Latin and French, sometimes\r\nbookkeeping, and occasionally something more; 3d Rep. of Civil Serv.\r\nComrs., Com.

Papers, 1871, XVII., 1, App.\r\n1.\r\n\r\n[161:4] In 1873 a Committee on Civil Service Expenditure suggested\r\nabolishing the distinction altogether, and having a single examination\r\nfor admission to each department, the men to stand upon an equality as\r\nregards subsequent promotion by merit. (3d Rep., Com. Papers, 1873,\r\nVII., 415, p. iv.) No action was taken on this recommendation; and two\r\nyears later Playfair's Commission on Admission to the Civil Service\r\nreported (Com. Papers, 1875, XXIII., 1) that the distinction between a\r\nhigher division to do the responsible work, and a lower division to do\r\nthe routine work, ought to be maintained. But they criticised the\r\nexisting division into Classes I and II, on the ground that there was no\r\npossibility of promotion from the second to the first, and that the\r\ndistinction did not correspond with the real difference in the nature of\r\nthe work, so that mechanical work was done by the first class and\r\nresponsible work by the second, while the clerks in some of the\r\ndepartments belonged wholly to one class. They recommended that there\r\nshould be in every department a lower division of men and boy clerks;\r\nthat its members should serve in any department to which they were\r\nappointed or transferred; and that after ten years' service they might,\r\nif they had shown exceptional capacity, be promoted to the upper\r\ndivision. These recommendations were embodied in the Order in Council of\r\nFeb. 12, 1876. The organisation of the civil service was thereby\r\nsimplified and improved, but it was still imperfect. The Commission on\r\nCivil Establishments, in their second report, in 1888 (Com. Papers,\r\n1888, XXVII., 1), said that in practice the work of the two divisions\r\nhad overlapped, and the line between them had been drawn too low. They\r\nsuggested also that the name of the lower division should be changed to\r\nsecond division. This was carried into effect by an Order in Council of\r\nMarch 21, 1890, which constituted the second division of the civil\r\nservice, with a higher grade to be reached by promotion, and made the\r\nboy clerks into a separate division. The rules affecting the second\r\ndivision have since been embodied in a new Order in Council of Nov. 29,\r\n1898, amended by another Order of Sept. 15, 1902. The first division,\r\nknown as Class I of the Civil Service, was regulated afresh by an Order\r\nin Council of Aug. 15, 1890, which created there also an upper grade to\r\nbe reached by promotion.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that appointments made as the result of competitive\r\nexamination are not absolute at once, but are probationary for a certain\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n[162:1] These are the men entering the civil service of the Eastern\r\ncolonies, Ceylon, Hong Kong, the Federated Malay States, etc.\r\n\r\n[163:1] Of the 514 successful candidates for the Class I clerkships, the\r\nIndian Civil Service and the Eastern Cadets, from 1896 to 1900\r\ninclusive, 262 had studied at Oxford, 148 at Cambridge, 83 at other\r\nuniversities in the United Kingdom, 7 in colonial and Indian\r\nuniversities, and 14 in no university at all. (45th Rep. of the Civil\r\nServ. Comrs., Com. Papers, 1901, XVIII., 129, pp. lxxix-lxxxii.) The\r\nproportion from Oxford and Cambridge in the Class I clerkships alone\r\nwould be somewhat larger still. The later reports of the Civil Service\r\nCommission show that these proportions have not been very much changed.\r\n\r\n[163:2] A more detailed statement of the method of conducting the\r\nexamination and its results may be found in Lowell and Stephens,\r\n\"Colonial Civil Service.\"\r\n\r\n[164:1] Morley, \"Life of Gladstone,\" I., 511.\r\n\r\n[164:2] In a letter to Lord John Russell he wrote: \"It must be\r\nremembered that an essential part of any such plan as it is now under\r\ndiscussion is the separation of _work_, wherever it can be made, into\r\nmechanical and intellectual, a separation which will open to the highly\r\neducated class a career, and give them a command over all the higher\r\nparts of the civil service, which up to this time they have never\r\nenjoyed.\" _Ibid._, 649.\r\n\r\n[165:1] For Mundella's origin see Davidson, \"Eminent English Liberals,\"\r\nCh. xii.; Hinton, \"English Radical Leaders,\" Ch. viii.\r\n\r\n[165:2] As in all such cases, the upper limit is extended to some extent\r\nfor men who have served the public in a military or other capacity.\r\n\r\n[166:1] 45th Rep. Civil Serv. Comrs., Com. Papers, 1901, XVIII., 129,\r\npp. lxxiii-iv. Under the present regulations, writing (with copying),\r\narithmetic and English composition are required; and of the eight\r\noptional subjects--precis (including indexing and adjusting of returns),\r\nbookkeeping and shorthand, geography and English history, Latin, French,\r\nGerman, elementary mathematics (plane geometry and algebra), and\r\nchemistry and physics--not more than four may be offered, including not\r\nmore than two of the three languages.\r\n\r\n[167:1] During the thirteen years from 1886 to 1898, inclusive, 147\r\nfirst-class clerks were appointed by open competition, 34 were promoted\r\nfrom the second division (or the corresponding class that preceded it),\r\nand 8 came from other sources (virtually by transfer from distinct\r\nservices). During the same period 123 second division clerks were\r\npromoted to other posts carrying an increase of salary. Com. Papers,\r\n1899, LXXVII., 751. From the later reports of the Civil Service\r\nCommissioners it would appear that the proportion of first-class\r\nclerkships filled by promotion does not increase.\r\n\r\n[167:2] Order in Council, Nov. 29, 1898, Sec. 15.\r\n\r\n[167:3] Or boy copyists.

Any work, therefore,\r\ncarried on at the present day without the assistance of experts is\r\ncertain to be more or less inefficient. But, on the other hand, experts\r\nacting alone tend to take disproportionate views, and to get more or\r\nless out of touch with the common sense of the rest of the world. They\r\nare apt to exaggerate the importance of technical questions as compared\r\nwith others of a more general nature--a tendency which leads either to\r\nhobbies, or, where the organism is less vigorous, to officialism and red\r\ntape. These evils have become so marked in the case of some governments\r\nas to give rise to the ill name of bureaucracy. In order, therefore, to\r\nproduce really good results, and avoid the dangers of inefficiency on\r\nthe one hand, and of bureaucracy on the other, it is necessary to have\r\nin any administration a proper combination of experts and men of the\r\nworld. Now, of all the existing political traditions in England, the\r\nleast known to the public, and yet one of those most deserving\r\nattention, is that which governs the relation between the expert and the\r\nlayman.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Judge and Jury.]\r\n\r\nThe first branch of the English government to reach a high point of\r\ndevelopment was that which dealt with the administration of justice; and\r\nit is here that we first see the cooperation of professional and lay\r\nelements. They appear in the form of judge and jury; and in that form\r\nthey have worked together from the Middle Ages to the present day. The\r\njudge, a royal officer of high rank, supplies the expert knowledge,\r\nwhile the lay influence is exerted by means of a panel of twelve men of\r\naverage ignorance, drawn from the community by lot for the occasion; and\r\nalthough this is not the usual method of combining the two elements,\r\ntheir reciprocal control has certainly been effective.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Justice of the Peace and his Clerk.]\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, in the superior courts of law alone that the\r\nprinciple made itself felt. Its working, if less evident on the surface,\r\nmay be traced no less clearly in the exercise of petty jurisdiction by\r\nthe justices of the peace sitting without a jury. But here the mutual\r\nrelation of the two elements was reversed. The justice of the peace was\r\nin most cases a landowner, a country gentleman, not skilled in law. In\r\nthe earlier period the commission included a number of trained lawyers,\r\nwho were said to be of the quorum, because without the presence of one\r\nof them the justices were not by law competent to act.[174:1] But in\r\nprocess of time the trained lawyers ceased to be appointed, while the\r\nnames of almost all the justices came to be inserted in the quorum\r\nclause;[174:2] and thus it happened that judicial authority was vested\r\nin a squire who knew little of the law he was called upon to administer.\r\nBut the justice supplied, in fact, the lay, not the professional,\r\nelement in his own court; the requisite legal knowledge being usually\r\nfurnished by his clerk, who was learned in the law; or, at least,\r\nlearned in the duties of the justice of the peace as set forth in the\r\nstatutes and in the manuals published for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe office of clerk of the peace for the county must be of considerable\r\nage, for it is referred to in a statute of Richard II. in 1388.[174:3]\r\nBut besides this office, which is a public one, it has been the habit\r\ntime out of memory for an active justice to retain a private clerk of\r\nhis own to assist him when acting as a single magistrate; such a clerk\r\nbeing paid partly out of the justice's pocket, partly from the fees\r\nthat accrued.[175:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: As Portrayed in Literature.]\r\n\r\nMore important than the age of these offices is the question of the real\r\npower exerted by their holders. That the influence of a clerk over the\r\njustice who employed him has long been both great and notorious is clear\r\nfrom the frequent references to it in literature. Early in the\r\nseventeenth century Fletcher, in \"The Elder Brother,\" makes Miramont say\r\nto Brissac:[175:2]--\r\n\r\n     \"Thou monstrous piece of ignorance in office!\r\n      Thou that hast no more knowledge than thy Clerk infuses.\"\r\n\r\nNear the end of that century the same idea was expressed with singular\r\nfrankness in a manual on \"The Office of the Clerk of the Peace,\"\r\npublished in 1682. In an address \"to the reader,\" which precedes the\r\nsecond part of the volume, the author explains the object of the book.\r\nAfter saying of the justices of the peace that their birth is a glory to\r\ntheir seats, he continues:--\r\n\r\n\"But divers of these Gentlemen having not been conversant in the\r\nPractice of the Ordinary Courts of Justice, often in the absence of\r\nthose worthy Persons, who be associated with them for their Learning in\r\nthe Law, meet with many difficulties and discouragements.\"\r\n\r\nComing down to the eighteenth century there is the case of Squire\r\nWestern and his clerk in \"Tom Jones\"; and later in the same novel the\r\nscene in the inn at Upton, where the strange justice is unwilling to act\r\nbecause he has not with him his book or his clerk. The reader will\r\nprobably remember Justice Foxley and his clerk in \"Redgauntlet\"; and\r\nalso Dickens's burlesque of the relation in the scene at Ipswich, where\r\nafter much whispering between the justice (Mr. Nupkins) and his clerk\r\n(Mr. Jinks) the magistrate says to Mr. Pickwick:--\r\n\r\n\"An information has been sworn before me that it is apprehended you are\r\ngoing to fight a duel, and that the other man, Tupman, is your aider and\r\nabettor in it. Therefore--eh, Mr. Jinks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, I call upon you both to--I think that's the course, Mr.\r\nJinks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"To--to--what, Mr. Jinks?\" said the magistrate pettishly.\r\n\r\n\"To find bail, Sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Therefore, I call upon you both--as I was about to say, when I was\r\ninterrupted by my clerk--to find bail.\"\r\n\r\nThe satire here is particularly keen, because before the public the\r\nmagistrate always takes the whole credit to himself, and is very\r\nsensitive about having the world believe that he is under the control of\r\nhis clerk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lay Chief with Expert Subordinate an English Usage.]\r\n\r\nLeslie Stephen, I think, remarks somewhere that the characteristic\r\nfeature of the English system of government is a justice of the peace\r\nwho is a gentleman, with a clerk who knows the law; and certainly the\r\nrelationship between the titular holder of a public post, enjoying the\r\nhonours, and assuming the responsibility, of office, and a subordinate,\r\nwho, without attracting attention, supplies the technical knowledge and\r\nlargely directs the conduct of his chief, extends throughout the English\r\ngovernment from the Treasury Bench to the borough council. Perhaps,\r\nindeed, it is not altogether fanciful to attribute the ease with which\r\nthe principle has become established in the national government to the\r\nfact that the members of Parliament, and the ministers as well, have\r\nbeen drawn in the past mainly from the same class as the justices of\r\nthe peace, and have brought with them to a larger sphere the traditions\r\nof the local magistrate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of Permanent Officials in the Colonial Office.]\r\n\r\nThe extent of the control exerted in the national administration by the\r\npermanent officials is forcibly illustrated by the history of the\r\nColonial Office. My colleague, Professor Edward Channing, has pointed\r\nout to me that the records of the American colonies reveal how largely\r\nthe Committee for Trade and Plantations was in the hands of Blathwayt,\r\nits secretary. In spite of all the violent political upheavals of the\r\ntime that functionary retained his post without interruption from the\r\nlatter part of the reign of Charles II. until some years after the\r\nrevolution of 1688; and if a colony wanted anything done by the home\r\ngovernment it was he that must be persuaded, sometimes by inducements of\r\na pecuniary nature.\r\n\r\nThe power, but happily not the corruption, of the permanent officials in\r\nthe Colonial Office can be traced still more clearly at a much later\r\ntime. In 1839 Lord Durham, in his famous \"Report on the Affairs of\r\nBritish North America,\" complains that owing to the repeated changes in\r\nthe political chiefs of the Colonial Office, the real management of the\r\ncolonies fell into the hands of \"the permanent but utterly irresponsible\r\nmembers of the office\"; and he quotes from a report made in the\r\npreceding year by a select committee of the Assembly of Upper Canada, to\r\nshow that this was felt by the colonists themselves as a\r\ngrievance.[177:1] The group of English colonial reformers, with whom\r\nLord Durham was associated, held the same opinion. Gibbon Wakefield\r\ntells us, in his \"View of the Art of Colonization\" that \"The great\r\nbulk, accordingly, of the labours of the office are performed, as\r\nthe greater portion of its legislative and executive authority is\r\nnecessarily wielded, by the permanent under-secretary and the\r\nsuperior clerks.\"[177:2] Wakefield and his school disapproved of the\r\ncolonial policy of the day, and disliked cordially the permanent\r\nofficials and their methods. \"Our colonial system of government,\"\r\nWakefield adds, \"is the bureaucratic, spoiled by being grafted on\r\nto free institutions.\"[178:1] He had a special aversion for Sir\r\nJames Stephen--long the legal adviser, and afterwards permanent\r\nunder-secretary, to the Colonial Office--whom he regarded as the\r\narchetype, if not the founder, of the class of officials that had become\r\nthe real arbiters of the destinies of the colonial empire.[178:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Mothercountry.]\r\n\r\nWakefield quotes from Charles Buller's \"Responsible Government for\r\nColonies\" (a work published in 1840, but at that time already out of\r\nprint), an extract entitled \"Mr. Mothercountry, of the Colonial\r\nOffice.\"[178:3] Parliament, Buller declares, takes no interest in the\r\ncolonies, and exercises no efficient control over the administration and\r\nlegislation affecting them; and hence the supremacy of England really\r\nresides in the Colonial Office. But the Secretary of State holds a\r\nshifting position. Perplexed by the vast variety of questions presented\r\nto him, he is obliged at the outset to rely on one or other of the\r\npermanent officials, and the official who thus directs the action of the\r\nBritish government Buller calls \"Mr. Mothercountry.\" He is familiar with\r\nevery detail of his business, and handles with unfaltering hand the\r\npiles of papers at which his superiors quail. He knows the policy which\r\nprevious actions render necessary; but he never appears to dictate. A\r\nnew Secretary of State intends to be independent, but something turns up\r\nthat obliges him to consult Mr. Mothercountry. He is pleased with the\r\nready and unobtrusive advice which takes a great deal of trouble off his\r\nhands. If things go well, his confidence in Mr. Mothercountry rises. If\r\nbadly, that official alone can get him out of the colonial or\r\nparliamentary scrape; and the more independent he is the more scrapes he\r\nfalls into. Buller goes on to point out the faults of Mr. Mothercountry;\r\nhis love of routine, his tendency to follow precedent, his dislike of\r\ninnovation, and his dread of being criticised.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Memoirs of Colonial Officials.]\r\n\r\nAny one, with even a slight knowledge of government offices in England,\r\nwill recognise that the portrait of Mr. Mothercountry and his influence\r\nis hardly overdrawn, in cases where the political chief either holds his\r\nplace for a short time, or is not a man of commanding ability. The\r\nimpression of the critics of colonial administration is, indeed,\r\nstrikingly reenforced in this respect by memoirs of the permanent\r\nofficials themselves; although some allowance must, no doubt, be made\r\nfor a natural overestimate of their own importance.[179:1] Sir Henry\r\nTaylor confided to the world in his autobiography a number of remarks\r\nthat throw light on the internal working of the Colonial Office in the\r\nsecond quarter of the century. While never its permanent\r\nunder-secretary, he was for a great many years a highly influential\r\nperson there, as may be seen from the fact that early in his career he\r\ndrew up, on his own judgment, a despatch recalling a governor, which the\r\nsecretary signed.[179:2] Taylor tells us that Lords Goderich and Howick,\r\nwho became the political chiefs of the Colonial Office in 1831, were\r\n\"not more in pupilage than it is necessary and natural that men should\r\nbe who are new to their work.\"[179:3] He says that when Lord Stanley was\r\nappointed Secretary of State, in 1833, he asked no advice from his\r\nsubordinates, and a measure he prepared was blown into the air by the\r\nHouse of Commons; whereupon he had recourse to Mr. Stephen,[179:4] \"who\r\nfor so many years might better have been called the Colonial Department\r\nitself than the 'Counsel to the Colonial Department.'\"[179:5] A little\r\nlater he repeats this last statement, saying that while Lord Glenelg was\r\nSecretary \"Stephen virtually ruled the Colonial Empire.\"[179:6] Taylor's\r\nown influence was shown when complaints were made of his administration\r\nof the West Indies. The House of Commons appointed a committee of\r\ninquiry, and the report of that committee, with the exception of the\r\nlast few sentences, was entirely drawn up by Taylor himself.[180:1]\r\n\r\nSir Frederick Rogers (afterwards Lord Blachford), who was permanent\r\nunder-secretary from 1860 to 1871, has left in his letters suggestive\r\ncomments upon most of his political chiefs. The Duke of Newcastle, he\r\nsays, is \"very ready to accept your conclusions, very clear in his own\r\ndirections, and extremely careful (which I respect very highly) never to\r\nthrow back on a subordinate any shadow of responsibility for advice that\r\nhe has once accepted.\"[180:2] \"Cardwell,\" he remarks, \"is happily\r\nabsent, though not so much as I could wish\";[180:3] and, finally, he\r\nwrites that he likes Lord Granville, who \"is very pleasant and friendly,\r\nand I think will not meddle beyond what is required to keep us clear of\r\npolitical slips.\"[180:4] Some people outside of the office evidently\r\nthought that the secretaries of state had not meddled overmuch, for\r\nGeorge Higginbottom, afterwards Chief Justice of Victoria, once remarked\r\nin the Assembly, \"It might be said with perfect truth that the million\r\nand a half of Englishmen who inhabit these colonies, and who during the\r\nlast fifteen years have believed they possessed self-government, have\r\nbeen really governed during the whole of that time by a person named\r\nRogers\";[180:5] and in the same vein Rees, in his \"Life and Times of Sir\r\nGeorge Grey,\" refers to Sir Robert Herbert (permanent under-secretary\r\nfrom 1871 to 1892) as the man who \"controls the destinies of the\r\nColonial Office.\"[180:6]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of Permanent Officials in Other Departments.]\r\n\r\nWith the growing interest in the empire, there has come a change; but\r\nuntil a very recent period the fact that British statesmen knew little\r\nof the subject, and did not care much more, no doubt made the power of\r\nthe permanent officials peculiarly great in the Colonial Office.\r\n\r\nTheir influence, however, upon the policy of the government in the\r\nother departments, if less absolute, has nevertheless been very large.\r\nThis impression one obtains both from published documents, and from\r\nprivate conversations, although the former alone can be cited as\r\nevidence. As far back as 1845 we find the Lord Lieutenant speaking of\r\nthe permanent under-secretary as \"the main-spring of your government in\r\nIreland.\"[181:1] But more important than scattered statements of this\r\nkind is the information derived from the testimony taken by\r\nparliamentary committees of inquiry. One cannot read, for example, the\r\nevidence collected in 1900 by the Committee on Municipal Trading[181:2]\r\nwithout being convinced that not only the efficiency, but also in large\r\nmeasure the current policy, of the Board of Trade depended upon the\r\npermanent official at its head, and this is true of every branch of the\r\nadministration.[181:3] Sir Lyon Playfair gave the reason for it when he\r\nsaid: \"The secretary being a very busy man is very apt to take the\r\nadvice of the clerk who has been looking over all the details and the\r\ncorrespondence before it comes to him.\"[182:1] A superior, indeed,\r\nlacking the time to become thoroughly familiar with the facts, must be\r\nto a great extent in the hands of a trusted subordinate who has them all\r\nat his fingers' ends. It is the common case of the layman and his\r\nconfidential expert; and it must be observed in this connection that\r\nwith exacting parliamentary and other duties, the cabinet ministers\r\ncannot devote all their time to the work of their departments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theoretical Relation of Political and Permanent Heads.]\r\n\r\nThe theoretical relation between the political chief and his permanent\r\nsubordinate is a simple one. The political chief furnishes the lay\r\nelement in the concern. His function is to bring the administration into\r\nharmony with the general sense of the community and especially of\r\nParliament. He must keep it in accord with the views of the majority in\r\nthe House of Commons, and conversely he must defend it when criticised,\r\nand protect it against injury by any ill-considered action of the House.\r\nHe is also a critic charged with the duty of rooting out old abuses,\r\ncorrecting the tendency to red tape and routine, and preventing the\r\ndepartment from going to sleep or falling into ruts; and, being at the\r\nhead, it is for him, after weighing the opinion of the experts, to\r\ndecide upon the general policy to be pursued. The permanent officials,\r\non the other hand, are to give their advice upon the questions that\r\narise, so as to enable the chief to reach a wise conclusion and keep him\r\nfrom falling into mistakes. When he has made his decision they are to\r\ncarry it out; and they must keep the department running by doing the\r\nroutine work. In short the chief lays down the general policy, while his\r\nsubordinates give him the benefit of their advice, and attend to the\r\ndetails. It is easy enough to state a principle of this kind, but in\r\npractice it is very hard to draw the line. The work of a public\r\ndepartment consists of a vast mass of administrative detail, the\r\nimportance of which is not self-evident until some strain is brought to\r\nbear upon it; and all the acts done, however trifling in themselves,\r\nform precedents, which accumulate silently until they become as\r\nimmovable as the rocks of the geologic strata. To know how far the\r\nopinion of an expert must be followed, and how far it may be overruled;\r\nto know what is really general policy, and what is mere detail; to know\r\nthese things is the most valuable art in life. The capacity of an\r\nadministrator on a large scale depends upon what he attends to himself,\r\nand what he commits to others. But the political chief of a department\r\nis so situated that it is difficult for him to determine what questions\r\nhe will reserve for himself and what he will leave to his subordinates.\r\nTo understand why that is the case it is necessary to know something of\r\nthe procedure in the government offices.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Procedure in the Public Departments.]\r\n\r\nThe method of doing business in a public office is of necessity more\r\nelaborate than in a private concern. There is more responsibility for\r\nthe work done; more subjection to public criticism in small matters; and\r\na stronger obligation to treat every one alike, which means a more\r\nstrict adherence to precedent. All this entails a complicated machinery\r\nthat is less needed in private business, where a man can say that if he\r\nmakes a mistake the loss falls upon himself and is no other person's\r\naffair. In a public office, therefore, more writing is done, more things\r\nare preserved and recorded, than in a private business, and there are\r\nmore steps in a single transaction.[183:1] Now although the procedure in\r\nthe English departments varies somewhat in detail, the general practice\r\nis much the same throughout the public service.\r\n\r\nWhen a minister wishes to prepare a measure for Parliament, or to make\r\nany change in administrative policy, he consults the permanent\r\nunder-secretary and any other officials especially familiar with the\r\nsubject; if, indeed, the matter has not been suggested to him by them.\r\nHe weighs their advice, and states his conclusion to the permanent\r\nunder-secretary, who in turn gives his directions to the proper\r\nsubordinates for carrying it into effect. In such a case the procedure\r\nis obvious; but by far the greater part of the action in the central\r\noffices begins at the other end, and comes from the contact of the\r\ngovernment with the public, or from questions that arise in the course\r\nof administration. When anything of this kind occurs, whether it be in\r\nthe form of a despatch, a petition, a complaint, a request for\r\ninstructions, or a communication of any sort, it is sent by the official\r\ncharged with the opening of correspondence to the principal, or senior,\r\nclerk within whose province it falls. The senior clerk intrusts it to\r\none of the junior first-class clerks in his division. He examines the\r\npaper, and unless it is of such a purely routine character that he feels\r\nauthorised to dispose of it, he affixes to it a minute or memorandum,\r\nwhich gives a history of the matter, the precedents in similar cases,\r\nand any other information that may assist his superiors in reaching a\r\ndecision, commonly adding a suggestion of the course to be pursued. The\r\npaper then goes back to the senior clerk, who inspects it, and if the\r\nquestion is of small consequence approves the minute or directs a\r\ndifferent disposition, subscribing his initials. If the affair is more\r\nweighty, he adds his own comments in the form of a second minute, and\r\ntransmits the paper to the permanent under-secretary.[184:1] That\r\nofficer, as the permanent head of the department, gives the final\r\ndirections,[184:2] and returns the paper, unless the matter is of great\r\nimportance, or involves a new question of policy, or is likely to give\r\nrise to discussion in Parliament, when he submits it to his political\r\nchief with a further minute of his own.[184:3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Each Official a Reader for his Superior.]\r\n\r\nEach permanent official thus performs a double service for his\r\nimmediate superior. He collects all the material that bears upon a\r\nquestion, presenting it in such a form that a decision can be readily\r\nand quickly made; and he acts to a certain extent as a reader, examining\r\na mass of papers that the superior would be quite unable to go through,\r\nand making up his own mind how far they contain anything that requires\r\nhis chief's attention.[185:1] This system runs throughout the\r\ndepartment, from the junior first-class clerks to the parliamentary\r\nhead, each official deciding what he will submit to his superior; in the\r\nsame way that the minister himself determines what matters he will\r\nsettle on his own authority, and what he had better lay before the\r\ncabinet. No doubt a subordinate in undertaking to decide a question\r\noccasionally makes a mistake for which the minister must assume the\r\nresponsibility; but that is not a serious danger. The besetting sin of\r\nbureaucracy is the tendency to refer too much to a higher authority,\r\nwhich cannot become familiar with the facts of each case, and finds its\r\nonly refuge in clinging to hard and fast rules. It is fortunate,\r\ntherefore, that the growth in the machinery of central administration in\r\nEngland has been accompanied by greater deconcentration within the\r\ndepartments.[185:2] The process has not been without effect on the\r\nposition of the permanent under-secretary. By relieving him of detail it\r\nhas made him more free to devote his attention to general policy; and,\r\nin fact, a departmental committee reported a few years ago that he ought\r\n\"to divest himself of all but the most important matters in which the\r\napplication of a new principle is involved.\" No question, the report\r\ncontinued, ought to reach him until it has been threshed out by the\r\nresponsible head of a division, and is ripe for decision. \"The permanent\r\nsecretary should be able to devote himself to such work as conferring\r\nwith and advising his Parliamentary chiefs, framing or elaborating\r\nproposals for new legislation or administrative reform, considering all\r\nquestions in Parliament, receiving members of Parliament, or\r\nrepresentatives of the Public on questions of difficulty, and generally\r\ncontrolling and directing the conduct of the Department.\"[186:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Differences between the Departments.]\r\n\r\nThe point to which deconcentration is carried is not the same in all\r\nbranches of the public service. Mr. Gladstone declared that the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer could not take as active a part as other\r\nministers in the current business of his department;[186:2] while in the\r\nForeign Office, on the other hand, it has been the tradition that the\r\nSecretary of State ought to see almost everything. No doubt this is in\r\npart due to the very nature of diplomatic relations, but there can also\r\nbe no doubt that in the past it has been carried much too far. When Mr.\r\nHammond was under-secretary for foreign affairs he insisted on making\r\nthe first minute on all papers in the office.[186:3] A change has been\r\nmade in this respect, and the practice brought more into accord with\r\nthat which prevails in other departments;[186:4] but the Foreign\r\nSecretary is still expected to give his personal attention to a greater\r\nmass of detail than other ministers.[186:5]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of the Procedure on the Power of Officials.]\r\n\r\nNow any subordinate who determines what questions he may decide himself,\r\nand what he will refer to his superiors, and who prepares the materials\r\nfor a final judgment in the cases that he does refer, is certain to\r\nexert a great deal of influence. The permanent under-secretary, holding\r\nhis position, as he does, for an indefinite period, devoting his whole\r\ntime to the work, and becoming thoroughly familiar with the affairs of\r\nhis department, can, no doubt, regulate the class of questions that\r\nshall be referred to him, and can acquire complete control over the\r\nadministration. But the minister, who is usually unfamiliar with the\r\ndepartment to which he is assigned, who remains at its head a\r\ncomparatively short time, and whose attention is largely engrossed by\r\nthe more exciting scenes enacted in the cabinet, in Parliament, and on\r\nthe platform, must, unless gifted with extraordinary executive capacity,\r\nbe to a considerable extent in the hands of his permanent subordinates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Need of Mutual Confidence between Political and Permanent\r\nHeads.]\r\n\r\nThe smooth working of a system of this kind evidently depends upon the\r\nexistence of mutual respect and confidence between the minister and the\r\npermanent under-secretary. If the minister, knowing that the\r\nunder-secretary does not share his own political views, fails to treat\r\nhim with perfect frankness, or if, after one party has been long in\r\npower, the permanent officials have little sympathy with a new ministry\r\nfrom the other party, and do not give it their active and cordial help,\r\nthen mistakes are certain to be made, the efficiency of the service\r\nsuffers, and the plans of the government are likely to miscarry. The\r\npermanent under-secretary ought to feel, and in fact does feel, a\r\ntemporary allegiance to his chief, although of a different political\r\nparty. He gives his advice frankly until the chief has reached a\r\ndecision, and then he carries that out loyally. Confidential\r\ncommunications--and they are numberless--he treats as sacred even from\r\nthe next parliamentary chief. If one minister prepares a measure which\r\nnever sees the light, the permanent under-secretary might refuse to show\r\nthe documents to the succeeding minister, and the latter would\r\nrecognise the propriety of such a course. The minister on his part\r\nseeks the advice of the under-secretary on all questions that arise,\r\nmaking allowance for bias due to preconceived political or personal\r\nconviction. This does not mean that if a government comes into power\r\npledged to a definite policy, such as Home Rule or a preferential\r\ntariff, the under-secretary would be consulted about the general\r\nprinciple. In a case of that kind the policy has been settled in\r\nParliament or by a general election, and the advice of the permanent\r\nofficials would be limited to the details of the measure proposed.\r\n\r\nThe system has, of course, its limits. There are cases where the known\r\nopinions of the under-secretary would make it almost impossible for him\r\nto conduct a certain policy effectively. When the Conservatives, for\r\nexample, came into office in 1895 with a policy of coercion for Ireland,\r\nthey found as permanent Irish under-secretary Sir Robert Hamilton, who\r\nwas known to be a strong Home Ruler, and believing that it would be very\r\ndifficult for them to govern the country through his agency, they\r\npromoted him out of the way; such cases must sometimes occur, but they\r\nare extremely rare. It is, indeed, astonishing how far the system can be\r\ncarried; to what an extent an under-secretary can act as the loyal\r\nadviser and administrator for chiefs of totally different political\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Actual Relation Depends on Personality.]\r\n\r\nThe actual relations between the minister and the permanent\r\nunder-secretary depend in any particular case very much upon the\r\npersonality of the men. Peel and Gladstone, for example, maintained a\r\nclose supervision and control over the departments under their charge,\r\nwhile John Bright felt that his real field of usefulness was in the\r\nHouse of Commons, and left the affairs of the Board of Trade almost\r\naltogether in the hands of the permanent officials. The system naturally\r\nworks at its best when minister and under-secretary are both strong,\r\ngood-tempered men, when each is active, but recognises clearly the\r\nprovince of the other. The saying has become almost proverbial that the\r\nmost valuable minister is one who knows nothing about his department\r\nwhen appointed, and like most paradoxes it contains a distorted truth. A\r\ngood minister must be a good administrator, but he must look to results,\r\nand not suppose that he knows as much about the technical side of the\r\nwork as his permanent subordinate. For, as Bagehot quotes Sir George\r\nCornwall Lewis, \"It is not the business of a Cabinet Minister to work\r\nhis department. His business is to see that it is properly\r\nworked.\"[189:1] If he attempts to go beyond his province, to be dogmatic\r\nand to interfere in details, he will cause friction and probably come to\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Methods of Controlling a Minister.]\r\n\r\nThe permanent officials have, indeed, several means of controlling a\r\nminister who ventures to disregard them. They have been heard to say\r\nthat a fool, if given rope enough, will hang himself. If he does not\r\ncare for their advice they need not tender it, and then he is sure to\r\nmake mistakes for which he alone will be held responsible. If, on the\r\nother hand, he tries, with the best intentions, to go too much into\r\ndetail, nothing is easier than the trick, familiar, probably, to every\r\nbureaucracy, of overwhelming him with detail. He wishes to decide\r\nquestions himself. The papers bearing upon them are brought to him in\r\never-increasing piles, until he finds himself hopelessly unable to cope\r\nwith the mass of documents, and virtually surrenders at discretion. Then\r\nthere are the means of control arising from the audit of accounts and\r\nfrom questions in Parliament. The permanent under-secretary points out\r\nto his chief that an expenditure he proposes is likely to be disallowed\r\nby the auditor, or that an action he suggests may very well give rise to\r\nan embarrassing question in the House of Commons, and to these things a\r\nminister is highly sensitive. Questions afford, indeed, a means of\r\nmutual control, for the permanent officials are usually far more afraid\r\nof the House of Commons than the minister is himself, and tend to be\r\nreticent in preparing answers.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury Bench is not so omniscient as it appears when answering\r\nquestions in the House. After notice of a question has been given, the\r\nmaterials for a reply are prepared, and often the answer itself is drawn\r\nup, by some permanent official in the department. Sometimes the minister\r\nmerely reads the answer as it has been placed in his hands, but more\r\ncommonly while keeping the substance, he puts it into words of his own\r\nthat he thinks better suited to the temper of the House. The labour of\r\nworking up the answers to innumerable questions on every conceivable\r\nsubject, and of every degree of importance and triviality, is in the\r\naggregate very great, and places a heavy burden upon the permanent\r\nofficials during the session of Parliament. But no satisfactory method\r\nof limiting the privilege has yet been devised, and although abused, it\r\nhas the effect of keeping the administration up to the mark. The system\r\naffords an opportunity for constant public criticism, and while it gives\r\nthe permanent officials some control over the minister, it is, on the\r\nother hand, a most effective means of preventing the growth of a\r\nbureaucratic spirit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evils where a Minister is Inactive.]\r\n\r\nIf the permanent officials can restrain a minister from interfering\r\novermuch, there is no similar means of preventing him from neglecting\r\nhis duties. Yet in that case the service suffers. It is apt to become\r\nnumbed and bureaucratic. Permanent officials tend to follow precedent,\r\nand, indeed, the force of precedent furnishes the basis of their power,\r\nbut the tendency to be too rigid in their rules is the curse of all\r\ntheir tribe. They shrink from innovation, rarely making a new precedent\r\nthemselves. This is particularly true in the lesser offices, giving\r\nrise, at times, to complaint; and the political chief has to insist upon\r\nthe need of making exceptions in hard cases, without allowing the hard\r\ncases themselves to make bad law. The surest remedy for an excess of\r\nroutine is a parliamentary head who is interested in the department, and\r\nwith him a permanent under-secretary of large calibre and wide\r\nexperience in affairs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of Permanent Officials not Increasing.]\r\n\r\nSpeaking in 1884 about the Reform Bill then pending, Sir Stafford\r\nNorthcote predicted that an extension of the franchise would increase\r\nthe power of the permanent officials;[191:1] and many people think that\r\nthe prophecy has been fulfilled. But this would seem to be one of the\r\ncases where an impression is due not so much to a real change of\r\nconditions, as to the fact that a state of things already existing has\r\nbecome recognised. The power of the civil service has undoubtedly grown\r\nvery much within the last hundred years; owing partly to the fact that\r\nthe ministers, instead of being primarily administrators, have become\r\nlegislators, engrossed by the work of Parliament and by general\r\npolitics; partly to the much shorter periods for which they hold office.\r\nDuring the one hundred and two years from 1721 to 1823 there were\r\nnineteen chancellors of the exchequer; of whom five held office for more\r\nthan ten years apiece, the aggregate length of their services being\r\nseventy-eight years. In the eighty-two years from 1823 to 1905,\r\ntwenty-three men held the office, one of them for thirteen years,\r\nanother for nine, and no one else for more than about six years. The\r\neffect of such a shortening of the minister's tenure of office upon the\r\nposition of his permanent subordinates is self-evident. But the present\r\nconditions of political life have now existed with little change for a\r\ngeneration; and, in the opinion of men well qualified to form a\r\njudgment, the power of the permanent officials, while varying from time\r\nto time with the personnel of the ministry, has not of late years shown\r\nany general tendency to increase.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Self-Effacement of the Civil Servants.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the civil servant enjoys a great deal of the substance of\r\npower, yet he purports to act only under the directions of his political\r\nchief. Sir Stafford Northcote was admonished early in his career by Mr.\r\nGladstone \"that references from the Opposition Bench to opinions of the\r\npermanent officers of Government, in contradiction to the opinion of the\r\nMinister who is responsible in the matter at issue, were contrary to\r\nrule and to convenience.\"[192:1] If this were not so the principle of\r\nministerial responsibility could hardly be maintained. The minister is\r\nalone responsible for everything done in his department, and he receives\r\nall the credit and all the blame. The civil servant never talks in\r\npublic about the policy of his department,[192:2] never claims anything\r\ndone there as his own work; and, on the other hand, the minister ought\r\nnot to attribute blunders or misconduct to a subordinate unless prepared\r\nat the same time to announce his discharge. This rule is not, indeed,\r\nalways observed in the military services, for within a few years the\r\nHouse of Lords has heard the late Secretary of State for War and the\r\nCommander-in-Chief charge each other with the responsibility for the\r\nlack of preparation in South Africa;[192:3] and in 1901 the First Lord\r\nof the Admiralty in the House of Lords laid the blame for the capsizing\r\nof the royal yacht at her launching upon the naval constructor, while\r\npraising, at the same time, his skill in designing battleships.[192:4]\r\nIn the civil services the principle has been, as a rule, very strictly\r\nfollowed; although here, also, in the case of Sir Antony MacDonnell, the\r\nunder-secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, an exception occurred\r\nwhich caused no small stir at the time.[192:5] Nor is the\r\nresponsibility of the minister merely formal and conventional, for the\r\nmistakes of the officials in his department go into the great balance of\r\ngood and evil report, whereby the reputation of the cabinet is made, and\r\nits fate at the next election is determined. In short, the permanent\r\nofficial, like the King, can do no wrong. Both are shielded by the\r\nresponsibility of the minister, and in fact it may happen that a policy\r\nadopted, let us say by the Foreign Office, which is popularly attributed\r\nto the personal wishes of the King, is in reality the work of some\r\npermanent subordinate.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago the public was not aware of the power of the civil\r\nservants, and Parliament, regarding them as clerks, paid little\r\nattention to them. But now that their importance has come to be\r\nunderstood there is, in the opinion of some of their own members, a\r\ndanger that they will be made too prominent, that the screen which\r\nprotects them from the public gaze will be partly drawn aside, and that\r\nthey will thereby lose their complete irresponsibility, and with it\r\ntheir permanence and their non-political character. Whether such a\r\ndanger will prove serious is at present only a matter for conjecture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Honours Conferred upon Civil Servants.]\r\n\r\nWhile the permanent official can win no credit for particular acts, a\r\nlife of exceptional service does not pass unrecognised. Sir Robert Peel,\r\nwho appreciated their importance, lamented that honours were not\r\nconferred upon them more freely.[194:1] Such a complaint could hardly be\r\nmade to-day, for a number of them are knighted every year, and\r\noccasionally a permanent under-secretary, on retiring from office, is\r\neven raised to the peerage. In spite of self-effacement, therefore, the\r\ncareer of a permanent official is honourable and attractive. If he is\r\ndebarred from the excitement and the glory of the political arena, he is\r\nspared its hazards, its vexations, and its disappointments. He wields\r\ngreat power, takes a real part in shaping the destinies of the nation,\r\nand if capable and fortunate he may end his days in the subdued lustre\r\nof the House of Lords.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[174:1] _Cf._ Gneist, \"Self-Government in England,\" 3 Auf., 196-97.\r\n\r\n[174:2] Blackstone, Bk.

(Hans., 4 Ser. LXXVIII., 32, 237, 239.) It was\r\npointed out that if the political chiefs of the Army and Navy want to\r\nincrease their expenditure they cannot be blocked by the Treasury\r\nclerks. They can confer with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and if he\r\nwill not consent, they can appeal to the Prime Minister, and ultimately\r\nto the cabinet. Nevertheless it is true that if the political chief does\r\nnot consider a matter of first-class importance--and many of the most\r\nfar-reaching matters do not appear so at the time--or does not want to\r\nfight about it, the opinion of the Treasury officials may prevail, even\r\nto the extent of blocking useful reforms that cost a little money.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if a matter is fought out between the political chiefs, their\r\nopinions may very well be derived from their permanent subordinates.\r\nWhen the subject of Treasury control was investigated by the Committee\r\non Civil Establishments, Sir Reginald (now Lord) Welby was asked, \"Is\r\nnot this question not so much between political ministers as between\r\npermanent heads of departments?\" He answered \"Yes, but the permanent\r\nheads of departments to (_sic_) convince their political chiefs behind\r\nwhom they fight,\" and added that the political chiefs commonly support\r\ntheir subordinates.

In the summer of 1904, believing\r\nthat he had the approval of Mr. Wyndham, the Chief Secretary, in so\r\ndoing, he assisted Lord Dunraven to formulate the policy of devolution\r\nin Ireland. But Mr. Wyndham hastened to make public his disapproval of\r\nthat policy as soon as the plan appeared in the press. When Parliament\r\nmet in February, 1905, Mr. Wyndham, in reply to questions of the Irish\r\nUnionists, stated these facts, adding that Sir Antony MacDonnell had\r\nbeen censured by the cabinet, which was, however, thoroughly satisfied\r\nthat his conduct was not open to the imputation of disloyalty. (Hans. 4\r\nSer. CXLI., 324-26.) The occurrence gave rise to a good deal of hot\r\ndiscussion in both Houses of Parliament in the latter half of February,\r\nin the course of which Mr. Wyndham said that he could not invite such a\r\nman as Sir Antony MacDonnell to come and help him as a clerical\r\nassistant, that he was invited rather as a colleague than as a mere\r\nunder-secretary. (Hans. 4 Ser. CXLI., 650, and see Lord Lansdowne's\r\nremarks, _Ibid._, 461.) The letters that passed between Mr. Wyndham and\r\nSir Antony MacDonnell at the time of his appointment were then produced,\r\nand they contain a stipulation couched in language that can fairly be\r\ninterpreted as implying either a position of exceptional importance, or\r\nmerely such influence as an under-secretary possessing the full\r\nconfidence of his chief might enjoy. (Hans. 4 Ser. CXLI., 979-81.) The\r\ndebate led to the resignation of Mr. Wyndham; and his successor, Mr.\r\nLong, as well as Mr. Balfour, insisted that no agreement made with Sir\r\nAntony gave him a position different from that of other\r\nunder-secretaries in the civil service. (Hans. 4 Ser. CXLI., 995;\r\nCXLII., 1225-26; CXLIV., 647-48, 1278-79). An aftermath of the trouble\r\ncame in the autumn of 1906 when Mr. Long challenged Sir Antony\r\nMacDonnell to publish any letters bearing upon the events of 1904-1905,\r\nbut these the Conservative government, when in power, had declined to\r\nproduce in Parliament. (The _Times_, Aug. 30, 31, Sept. 1, 4, 1906.)\r\nCorrespondence of this nature cannot, of course, be published, at the\r\ngood pleasure of the possessor. The whole episode illustrates clearly\r\nthe difficulties that arise when a parliamentary chief fails to assume\r\ncomplete responsibility for everything that happens in his department.\r\nIt shows also that the relations between the political chief and his\r\npermanent subordinate are fixed by the nature of the parliamentary\r\nsystem, and cannot be effectively changed in special cases.\r\n\r\n[194:1] Parker, \"Sir Robert Peel,\" II., 35-36.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF COMMONS\r\n\r\n_Constituencies and Voters_\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Electors and Constituencies Offer Distinct Problems.]\r\n\r\nThe composition of any representative body involves two separate things;\r\nthe electors and the constituencies. During the first part of the\r\nnineteenth century public attention outside of England was mainly\r\nconcentrated upon the electors, or in other words upon the extension of\r\nthe franchise. But now that something like universal suffrage has been\r\nintroduced into most of the countries which have a popular element in\r\ntheir government, the franchise is little discussed, and much more is\r\nsaid about the constituencies, that is, the method of combining the\r\nvoters into groups. The change is largely due to discontent with some of\r\nthe results of democracy, a feeling which finds vent in widespread\r\ncriticism of representative institutions.[195:1]\r\n\r\nIt was formerly assumed that the interests of the masses of the people\r\nwere fundamentally identical; and hence the mode in which the electors\r\nwere grouped was comparatively unimportant, the main question being the\r\nenlargement of the basis of representation. We have now learned that the\r\nformation of the constituencies offers a distinct problem with grave\r\npractical effects, and popular government not having brought the\r\nmillennium that was foretold, men seek a remedy in different methods of\r\ncombining the voters. We constantly see discussions of this subject. We\r\nhear of the relative advantage of _scrutin d'arrondissement_ and\r\n_scrutin de liste_; that is, single electoral districts or large areas\r\nchoosing a number of representatives apiece. We hear about the grouping\r\nof voters on the basis of their natural economic relations into urban\r\nand rural constituencies; or on the basis of wealth, as in the\r\nthree-class system of Prussia. We hear suggestions of possible grouping\r\non the basis of occupations;[196:1] and a vast amount of literature has\r\nbeen published to prove the advantage of a grouping on the basis of\r\nopinions, by some form of proportional representation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How Treated in England.]\r\n\r\nIn England the two questions of the electors and the constituencies,\r\nalthough usually considered, and made the subject of legislation, at the\r\nsame time, have always been kept distinct. Each of the great series of\r\nmeasures of parliamentary reform has touched both subjects, but in\r\nunequal degree; and, in fact, it was really the state of the\r\nconstituencies that forced both problems upon public attention.\r\n\r\nThe Reform Act of 1832 brought in a general franchise for boroughs in\r\nplace of the multifarious, and on the whole highly exclusive, privileges\r\nwhich had existed before. It also changed, though in a less radical way,\r\nthe franchise in the counties. But as a political measure its greatest\r\nimportance lay in its effect upon the constituencies by the\r\nredistribution of seats. It took from small boroughs in various stages\r\nof decay and rottenness one hundred and forty-three seats, and gave them\r\nto the counties, and to new large towns hitherto unrepresented. The Act\r\nof 1867, on the other hand, while transferring seats to some extent, was\r\nmainly a measure for extending greatly the borough franchise. In 1884\r\nand 1885 both subjects were dealt with radically. By the Act of 1884 the\r\nfranchise for counties was much enlarged; and by that of 1885 the\r\ndistribution of seats was reorganised upon a basis closely akin to equal\r\nelectoral districts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Constituencies.]\r\n\r\nThe constituencies for the English Parliament are of three kinds;\r\ncounties, boroughs and universities. The last are quite different from\r\nthe others in nature and franchise, and a word may be said about them\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Universities.]\r\n\r\nOxford and Cambridge were given two seats apiece by James I. The\r\nUniversity of Dublin, which had already one seat, obtained another by\r\nthe Reform Act of 1832; and, finally, the Act of 1868 gave one member to\r\nLondon University, one to Glasgow and Aberdeen combined, and another to\r\nEdinburgh and St. Andrews. The franchise for the universities belongs in\r\ngeneral to the registered graduates.[197:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Reform Act of 1832.]\r\n\r\nUntil 1832 each county, and each borough that had the privilege of being\r\nrepresented, elected, as a rule, two members of Parliament. This,\r\nhowever, was not true of the Scotch boroughs, which were, with few\r\nexceptions, grouped into districts returning a single member apiece; a\r\nsystem that has been maintained to the present day. Some of the English\r\nboroughs had been given the right of electing members by the Tudors and\r\nthe early Stuarts, not because they were places of importance, but, on\r\nthe contrary, because they were not populous, and their members could be\r\neasily controlled by the Crown--the electoral rights being commonly\r\nvested in the governing council, which was a close corporation. Other\r\nboroughs that had once been places of consequence had, in the course of\r\ntime, fallen into decay. So that by the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury many members of the House represented no substantial\r\ncommunities, and were really appointed either by small self-perpetuating\r\nbodies, or by patrons, who, owning the land, controlled the votes of the\r\nfew electors in the constituency. This condition of things was made\r\nscandalous by the open practice of selling elections to Parliament for\r\ncash; and the demand for reform, which had been checked by the long\r\nstruggle with France, began again after the peace, culminating finally\r\nin the Reform Act of 1832.[197:2] The object of this measure was to\r\nremove a manifest abuse, rather than to reorganise the representation\r\nof the country on a new basis, and it applied to the conditions a\r\nsomewhat rough and inexact remedy. The boroughs with less than two\r\nthousand population by the census of 1821 were disfranchised altogether,\r\nthose with more than two thousand and less than four thousand lost one\r\nmember, and the seats thus obtained were divided about equally between\r\nthe counties and the new large towns that had hitherto been\r\nunrepresented.[198:1] But the constituencies still remained very uneven\r\nin population--and, indeed, the framers of the act had no desire for\r\nequal electoral districts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Reform Act of 1867.]\r\n\r\nThe same process was continued by the Act of 1867, which again took\r\nmembers from little towns and gave them to larger ones and to the\r\ncounties. While there was no general attempt to make the number of\r\nrepresentatives proportional to the size of a constituency, a few\r\nof the largest provincial towns were given three members; and in\r\nthat connection an interesting experiment was tried. With the\r\nobject of providing for minority representation, the electors in\r\nthe boroughs returning three members--the so-called three-cornered\r\nconstituencies--were allowed to vote for only two candidates apiece.\r\nThis resulted in diminishing the real representation of the borough, as\r\ncompared with the rest of the country. If Manchester, for example, was\r\nLiberal, she would probably be represented by two Liberals and one\r\nConservative. But in a party division the Conservative would neutralise\r\none of the Liberals, so that Manchester would count for only one vote,\r\nand would, therefore, have only half as much weight as a much smaller\r\nborough with two members both belonging to the same party. The\r\nexperiment gave so little satisfaction that it was afterward abandoned;\r\nand it is chiefly interesting to-day because the effort to organise a\r\nlarge party majority so as to compass the election of all three members\r\ngave rise to the Birmingham Caucus, whose birth and whose progeny will\r\nbe described in a subsequent chapter. Except for the few three-member\r\nconstituencies, and a much larger number of boroughs having only a\r\nsingle seat, the constituencies still returned two members apiece; and\r\nthis continued to be the rule until the third and last of the great\r\nmeasures of parliamentary reform.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Reform Act of 1885.]\r\n\r\nThe Redistribution Act of 1885, although, like all English measures of\r\nreform, to some extent a compromise between the old ideas and the new,\r\nrested upon the principle of equal electoral districts each returning a\r\nsingle member. The proportion of one seat for every 54,000 people was\r\nroughly taken as the basis of representation; and in order to adapt the\r\nprinciple to the existing system with the least possible change,\r\nboroughs with less than 15,000 inhabitants were disfranchised\r\naltogether, and became, for electoral purposes, simply a part of the\r\ncounty in which they were situated. Boroughs with more than 15,000 and\r\nless than 50,000 people were allowed to retain, or if hitherto\r\nunrepresented were given, one member; those with more than 50,000 and\r\nless than 165,000, two members; those above 165,000 three members, with\r\nan additional member for every 50,000 people more. The same general\r\nprinciple was followed in the counties.[199:1]\r\n\r\nThe boroughs that had hitherto elected two members, and were entitled to\r\nthe same number under the new scheme, remained single constituencies for\r\nthe election of those two members. Of these boroughs there are\r\ntwenty-three,[199:2] which, with the City of London, and the three\r\nuniversities (Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin), makes in all twenty-seven\r\ncases where two members are elected together. All the other\r\nconstituencies are single-member districts, a result which was brought\r\nabout by a partition of the counties, of boroughs with more than two\r\nmembers, and of the new boroughs with only two members, into separate\r\nelectoral divisions, each with its own distinctive name.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to note that the Reforms of 1832 and 1867 did not\r\nchange the total number of members of the House, but merely\r\nredistributed the existing 658 seats. By the disfranchisement, after\r\n1867, for corrupt practices, of four boroughs returning six members, the\r\nnumber was reduced to 652; and the Reform Act of 1885 increased it to\r\n670, where it has since remained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inequalities in Representation.]\r\n\r\nThe distribution of seats under the Act of 1885 was only a rough\r\napproximation to equal electoral districts; and in time it has become\r\nfar less close, until to-day the difference in the size of the\r\nconstituencies is very great. The smallest is the borough of Newry in\r\nIreland, which had at the census of 1901 a population of only 13,137;\r\nor, if we leave Ireland aside on account of its peculiar conditions, the\r\nsmallest in Great Britain is the city of Durham with a population of\r\n14,935; while the largest is the southern division of the County of\r\nEssex, with 217,030 inhabitants; so that the largest constituency to-day\r\nis nearly fifteen times as populous as the smallest.[200:1] Nor are the\r\ninequalities confined to extreme cases; for they exist in lesser degree\r\nthroughout the electoral body, many of the constituencies being two or\r\nthree times as large as many others.\r\n\r\nBut unless one assumes that the exact equivalence of all votes is a\r\nfundamental principle of political justice, differences of this kind are\r\nof little consequence, provided one part of the community, or rather one\r\nset of opinions or interests, is not distinctly over-represented at the\r\nexpense of another. Now, in Parliament an over-representation of this\r\nkind does exist; not, indeed, in regard to the different social classes\r\nor economic interests in the nation--for inequalities of that sort are\r\nnot marked enough to be important--but between the different parts of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Over-Representation of Ireland.]\r\n\r\nSome parts of Great Britain have grown very rapidly, while the\r\npopulation of Ireland has actually diminished during the last half\r\ncentury; and the result is that whereas in the United Kingdom as a whole\r\nthere is now, on the average, one member of Parliament for every 62,703\r\npeople, England has only one for every 66,971; and Ireland one for every\r\n44,147. If a redistribution of seats were to be made in strict\r\nproportion to population, Ireland would therefore lose thirty members,\r\nand England would gain about as many, while Scotland would gain one\r\nseat, and Wales would lose three.\r\n\r\nThe question of the proportional representation of England and Ireland\r\nis a burning one, because the parliamentary system cannot work well\r\nunless one party has a majority which can give to the ministry a stable\r\nsupport. But eighty of the Irish members are Nationalists, who do not\r\nbelong to either of the great parties, and may at any general election\r\nacquire a balance of power, and cause confusion in politics, as they did\r\nafter the election of 1885. The loss of twenty-five seats, which they\r\nwould suffer by a reduction of the Irish representation, would\r\nmaterially lessen that danger. The Conservative government was\r\nconstantly urged by its supporters to make the transfer of seats from\r\nIreland to England, and was actually preparing to do so at the time it\r\nresigned in 1905. On behalf of Ireland it was argued that this would be\r\na violation of the Act of Union, which was in the nature of a treaty,\r\nand allotted to Ireland one hundred members in the House of\r\nCommons.[201:1] On the other hand the advocates of the policy replied\r\nthat the terms of the Act of Union cannot be forever binding under a\r\nchange of circumstances; they referred to the fact that in 1868 the\r\nChurch of England was disestablished in Ireland, notwithstanding the\r\nprovision in the Act for its perpetual establishment there;[201:2] and\r\nthey said that conditions had so changed as to justify a redistribution\r\nof seats. The Irish, however, claim that the great bulk of their people\r\nwanted disestablishment, and that Ireland could waive provisions made in\r\nher behalf; but it may be urged that the provision about the Church was\r\nmade for the benefit not of Ireland, or its people, but of a minority\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe formation in England of new constituencies for the seats transferred\r\nwould raise great practical difficulties. Even if it did not involve a\r\ngeneral redistribution bill, it would necessitate changing many of the\r\ndistricts. Quite apart from the danger of incurring a charge of\r\ngerrymandering for party purposes, there would be a host of personal\r\ninterests of members of Parliament to be considered. Each member\r\naffected would be anxious that the change should not make his seat less\r\nsecure than before; and claims of this sort have peculiar weight in a\r\ncountry where, as in England, the sitting member has almost a\r\nprescriptive right to renomination by his party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of the English Method of Distributing Seats.]\r\n\r\nThe English practice of rearranging the constituencies, and apportioning\r\nthe representatives among them, only at long intervals, of treating a\r\nbill for the purpose as an exceptional measure of great political\r\nimportance, instead of the natural result of each new census, has the\r\nadvantage of preventing frequent temptations to gerrymander. But, on the\r\nother hand, it raises the matter of electoral districts to the height of\r\na constitutional, and almost a revolutionary, question, preceded\r\nsometimes by long and serious agitation, and always fought over on party\r\ngrounds. This is a perpetual difficulty, for the shifting of population,\r\nwhich must always be changing the ratio of representation, will from\r\ntime to time make a redistribution of seats inevitable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Franchise.]\r\n\r\nThe extension of the franchise was long a grave constitutional question\r\nalso, but it has now been so nearly worked out that it can hardly be\r\nregarded in that light in future. Before the Reform Act of 1832 the\r\nfranchise in the counties depended entirely upon the ownership of land,\r\nan old statute of 1429,[202:1] having confined the right of voting to\r\nforty-shilling freeholders; that is, to men who owned an estate of\r\ninheritance, or at least a life estate, in land of the annual value of\r\nforty shillings.[203:1]\r\n\r\nIn the boroughs the franchise was based upon no uniform principle, but\r\nvaried according to the custom or charter of the borough. Sometimes it\r\ndepended upon the tenure of land; and, since residence was by no means\r\nalways necessary, it might happen that the voters did not live in the\r\nplace, and there were even cases where members were returned to\r\nParliament by boroughs that had no longer a single inhabitant. Sometimes\r\nthe right belonged to the governing body of the town; sometimes to all\r\nthe freemen; sometimes to all householders who paid local taxes; and in\r\none place, at least, it extended to all the inhabitants. In these last\r\ncases the franchise was actually wider before the Reform Act of 1832\r\nthan it was afterward, so that although the act enlarged the electorate\r\nvery much on the whole, and preserved the rights of all existing voters,\r\nit narrowed the franchise seriously for the future in a few\r\nplaces.[203:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reform Act of 1832.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Counties.]\r\n\r\nIn the counties the Act of 1832 continued to treat the right to vote as\r\ndependent upon the tenure of land, although in some ways restricting and\r\nin others much more largely extending it. In order to prevent the\r\nmanufacture of forty-shilling freeholders for electoral purposes, the\r\nact provided that a voter must have been in possession of his land for\r\nsix months, unless it came to him by descent, devise, marriage or\r\npromotion to an office;[203:3] and, also, that if he held only a life\r\nestate he must either have acquired it by one of these methods, or must\r\nbe in actual occupation, unless again it was of the clear yearly value\r\nof ten pounds.[203:4] On the other hand the act extended the right of\r\nvoting in counties to persons entitled to copyholds, and leaseholds for\r\nsixty years, of the annual value of ten pounds; to leaseholds for twenty\r\nyears of the value of fifty pounds; and to leaseholds of fifty pounds\r\nannual value without regard to the length of the term, if the tenant was\r\nin actual occupation of the land.[204:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Boroughs.]\r\n\r\nIn the boroughs the Reform Act wrought a complete change. Except that it\r\npreserved the personal rights of living voters,[204:2] and retained the\r\nprivileges of freemen in towns where they existed,[204:3] it swept away\r\nall the old qualifications,[204:4] and replaced them by a single new\r\nfranchise based exclusively upon the tenure, or rather the occupation,\r\nof land. The new qualification was uniform throughout England, and\r\nincluded every man who occupied, as owner or tenant, a house, shop, or\r\nother building, worth, with the land, ten pounds a year. But while the\r\nfranchise in the boroughs was thus based, like that in the counties,\r\nupon land, the effect was entirely different, and was intended to be so.\r\nIt has been said that the framers of the act meant the county members to\r\nrepresent property, and the borough members to represent numbers. The\r\nboroughs, as will appear later, did not really stand for numbers, but\r\nthe counties did certainly represent property, and that in spite of the\r\nChandos Clause which admitted fifty-pound leaseholders and was resisted\r\nby the authors of the bill. The electorate in the counties consisted of\r\nthe landholders with a few large farmers, while in the towns it\r\ncomprised the great middle class.\r\n\r\nLater in the same session acts of a similar nature were passed for\r\nScotland[204:5] and Ireland;[204:6] and in fact it was the practice\r\nuntil 1884 to deal with the franchise in the three kingdoms by separate\r\nstatutes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of the Act of 1832.]\r\n\r\nAs the practice of keeping a register of persons entitled to vote at\r\nparliamentary elections did not begin until this time, it is impossible\r\nto say precisely how much the Act of 1832 increased the size of the\r\nelectorate. But from returns made just prior to the passage of the\r\nAct,[205:1] it would appear that the number of borough electors in\r\nEngland and Wales was then about 180,000; whereas immediately after the\r\nAct had gone into effect it was 282,398.[205:2] The total increase in\r\nthe borough electorate, which was the one chiefly affected, was\r\ntherefore about 100,000, and a great part of this increase consisted of\r\nthe voters in the large towns that had been given seats for the first\r\ntime by the Act.\r\n\r\nThe new system was in no sense either democratic or proportionate to\r\npopulation. The average ratio of electors to population for the whole\r\nUnited Kingdom was about one in thirty; but the variation in different\r\nconstituencies and different parts of the kingdom was very great. In the\r\nEnglish and Welsh counties the ratio ran all the way from one in five in\r\nWestmoreland, to one in thirty-seven in Lancashire, one in thirty-nine\r\nin Middlesex, and one in sixty in Merioneth. In the English and Welsh\r\nboroughs it ran from nearly one in four in Bedford and Aylesbury, where\r\npractically all adult males were voters, to one in forty-five in the\r\nmanufacturing towns. In Scotland even a smaller part of the population\r\nenjoyed the franchise. In the counties the ratio ran from one in\r\ntwenty-four in Selkirk, to one in ninety-seven in Sutherland; and in\r\nboroughs or districts, from one in twenty in the Elgin district, to one\r\nin forty in that of Linlithgow. In the Irish counties it ran from one in\r\nfifty-eight in Carlow, to one in two hundred and sixty-one in Tyrone;\r\nand in the boroughs from one in nine in Carrickfergus and Waterford, to\r\none in fifty-three in Tralee.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of members of Parliament to population was far more\r\nuneven still. As reformers at a later date were constantly pointing out,\r\none half of the borough population of England was contained in sixteen\r\nboroughs, and elected only thirty-four members; the other half,\r\nnumbering less than two and a half millions, still returning two hundred\r\nand ninety-three members; while the counties with eight millions of\r\npeople returned one hundred and forty-four members. Thus it happened\r\nthat less than one fifth of the population in England elected nearly one\r\nhalf of the representatives; and as these came from the boroughs it can\r\nhardly be said that the borough members represented numbers.[206:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Later Reform Bills.]\r\n\r\nMr. G. Lowes Dickinson, in his \"Development of Parliament during the\r\nNineteenth Century,\"[206:2] has pointed out that while the framers of\r\nthe Act of 1832 had not the least intention of introducing democracy,\r\nthe measure itself could not have furnished a permanent settlement of\r\nthe franchise, and was destined inevitably to lead to further steps in\r\nthe direction of universal suffrage. The first step was a slight\r\nreduction, in 1850, of the amounts required for the qualification of\r\nvoters in Ireland.[206:3] This was followed by a series of moderate\r\nEnglish reform bills, which failed to pass the House of Commons.[206:4]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Act of 1867.]\r\n\r\nIn 1867 Disraeli, who had educated his reluctant party until it accepted\r\nthe political need of extending the franchise, brought in a bill with\r\nelaborate safeguards against the predominance of the masses. Under the\r\nexisting law a small fraction of the working classes had votes in the\r\nboroughs;[206:5] and it was Disraeli's intention to admit a larger\r\nnumber of the more prosperous workingmen without giving them an\r\noverwhelming weight in the electorate. But the parliamentary situation\r\nwas peculiar. The Conservative government, which had come into power\r\nonly through the quarrels of its opponents, had not a majority in the\r\nHouse of Commons, and could not insist upon its own policy; while the\r\nLiberals were not under the sense of responsibility that comes with\r\noffice. The result was that the bill was transformed by amendments, the\r\nsafeguards proposed by the cabinet were swept away, and a far longer\r\nstride toward universal suffrage was taken than any one had expected.\r\n\r\nIn the counties the Act of 1867[207:1] reduced the ten-pound\r\nqualification for owners and long leaseholders to five pounds, and\r\ncreated a new twelve-pound occupation franchise. But a far greater\r\nextension was made in the boroughs, where two new franchises were\r\nintroduced. The most important of these was that of the \"householder,\"\r\nwhereby a vote was given to every man who occupied, as owner or tenant\r\nfor twelve months, a dwelling-house, or any part of a house used as a\r\nseparate dwelling, without regard to its value.[207:2] The other\r\nfranchise admitted lodgers who occupied for the same period lodgings of\r\nthe clear value, unfurnished, of ten pounds a year.[208:1] In the\r\ncourse of the next session acts, in general similar, were passed for\r\nScotland and Ireland.[208:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its Effects.]\r\n\r\nFrom 1832 to 1862, in spite of the general gain in wealth, the electors\r\nhad increased very little faster than the population; in England and\r\nWales, indeed, the voters remained about one twentieth of the\r\npeople,[208:3] while in Scotland they had risen only from one thirty\r\nseventh to one thirtieth.[208:4] But the Acts of 1867 and 1868 almost\r\ndoubled the electorate. In the counties the voters, who numbered 768,705\r\njust before those acts, were, by 1871, 1,055,467; while the borough\r\nvoters increased from 602,088 to 1,470,956.[208:5]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Act of 1884.]\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the qualifications for voting could not long remain\r\nfar wider in one class of constituencies than in another; that the\r\nfranchise of the boroughs must, in time, be extended to the counties.\r\nThis was done in 1884,[208:6] and the change more than doubled the\r\ncounty electorate. The franchise, therefore, is now substantially\r\nuniform throughout the United Kingdom, except that certain owners and\r\nleaseholders have a right to vote in counties, and that in some old\r\ntowns the freemen still possess the suffrage. Inasmuch as most of the\r\nboroughs are included in counties, the occupier, householder, or lodger\r\nwould be entitled on the same qualifying property to vote in both; and\r\nhence a man in a borough would have two votes at an election, while\r\nanother man with the same qualification outside of the borough would\r\nhave only one. To avoid this result it is provided that a man shall not\r\nbe entitled to vote at an election for a county in respect of the\r\noccupation of a dwelling-house, lodging, land or tenement in a\r\nborough;[209:1] but he may vote in the county on account of the\r\nownership of land in a borough which he does not occupy, or on account\r\nof land which he both owns and occupies if he occupies other land in the\r\nborough sufficient to qualify him there.[209:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Existing Qualifications.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the franchise is now substantially uniform, it is not exactly\r\nthe same for the different parts of the United Kingdom; nor is it by any\r\nmeans simple. The latest acts have not codified the law. It must still\r\nbe sought in many statutes, whose provisions are so complicated, and\r\noften obscure, that they can be understood only by studying the\r\ninterpretation put upon them by the courts. The reader who wishes to\r\nascertain the law on a special point must refer to treatises upon the\r\nsubject, such as Rogers on \"Elections.\" It will be enough for our\r\npurpose to summarise the various franchises as they exist to-day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Property.]\r\n\r\nThere are two qualifications which are not universal. One of these,\r\nrelating to property rights in land, applies only to counties, and to\r\nsome extent to boroughs which are counties in themselves.[209:3] It\r\nconfers the right to vote on owners of land[210:1] of forty shillings\r\nyearly value, who hold an estate of inheritance; or who hold an estate\r\nfor life, and are in actual occupation of the land, or have acquired it\r\nby some means other than purchase, or whose land is of five pounds clear\r\nyearly value.[210:2] Under this franchise come, also, the leaseholders\r\nof land of five pounds yearly value if the original term was not less\r\nthan sixty years, and fifty pounds value if the term was not less than\r\ntwenty years.[210:3] The corresponding qualifications for Scotland and\r\nIreland are slightly different in their conditions and in the values\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Freemen.]\r\n\r\nThe other franchise which is not universal is that of freemen in those\r\ntowns where they had a right to vote before 1832. The privilege still\r\nexists in a number of old boroughs, but, except in the City of London,\r\nis confined to freemen who have become such by birth or apprenticeship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occupiers, Householders, and Lodgers.]\r\n\r\nThe three remaining franchises are universal, though not precisely\r\nuniform. They are those of the ten-pound occupiers, the householders,\r\nand the lodgers. The first of these gives the right to vote to a man who\r\noccupies, as owner or tenant, any land or tenement of the clear yearly\r\nvalue of ten pounds. The second confers the right on a man who occupies,\r\nas owner or tenant, any dwelling-house, or part of a house used as a\r\nseparate dwelling, without regard to its value. The qualification\r\nextends also to men who are not owners or tenants, but who occupy by\r\nvirtue of an office, service, or employment, a dwelling-house in which\r\nthe employer does not himself reside. The third of these franchises\r\nconfers the right to vote upon a man who occupies lodgings of the value,\r\nunfurnished, of ten pounds a year.\r\n\r\nThe application of these franchises to particular cases has given rise\r\nto a great amount of litigation, and in particular the courts have found\r\nit almost impossible to distinguish between a householder and a lodger.\r\nFor the general reader, who is concerned with the study of the English\r\ngovernment, and not with the effort to get the largest possible number\r\nof party members registered, such questions have little interest; but\r\nthere are two or three matters that ought to be noted, because they have\r\nan important bearing on the actual size of the electorate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Period of Occupation.]\r\n\r\nOne matter of political consequence relates to the period of occupation\r\nrequired. Owners of land in counties, who have acquired it by descent,\r\nmarriage, promotion to an office, etc., are not required to have owned\r\nit for any period. All other owners must have held the title for six\r\ncalendar months before the 15th of July preceding the registration; and\r\nall other voters, except freemen, must have been in occupation of the\r\nqualifying premises, or some other premises within the same\r\nconstituency, for one year preceding the 15th of July.[211:1] This, of\r\ncourse, has the effect of disqualifying entirely persons whose\r\noccupation has not been continuous for the whole of that year, and as\r\nthe register does not take effect until the 1st of January following,\r\nand then remains in effect a whole year, voters who have moved to\r\nanother part of the country within eighteen months after their year of\r\noccupation can vote only by a journey back to their former place of\r\nabode.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Residence.]\r\n\r\nA second matter that must be noticed is the question of residence.\r\nBefore the Reform Act of 1832 the qualification for counties was based\r\nupon ownership; that for boroughs varied very much; but in those places\r\nwhere the franchise was broad it was based mainly upon residence. This\r\ndistinction has, to some extent, persisted. In general it may be said\r\nthat for English and Scotch counties, and in Ireland for both boroughs\r\nand counties, residence is not required, except so far as the occupation\r\nof a dwelling-house or lodging may involve residence and this is not\r\nnecessarily the case.[211:2]\r\n\r\nIn English boroughs a voter must have resided for six calendar months\r\nprevious to the 15th of July in the borough, or within seven miles\r\nthereof;[212:1] and in Scotland he must have resided there for a whole\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe requirement of residence does not, however, imply quite so much as\r\nmight appear, because, according to English law, the possession of a\r\nchamber in which a man occasionally sleeps, and to which he can return\r\nat any time, is enough to constitute residence; and, hence, he may have\r\na residence in more than one place.[212:2] In the counties, therefore,\r\nresidence is unnecessary, and even in the boroughs the requirement of\r\nresidence does not limit a man to voting in a single constituency. The\r\nimportance of this will shortly be pointed out.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Payment of Rates.]\r\n\r\nThe third matter to be noticed is the question of rating. We have\r\nalready observed that at one time the personal payment of rates by the\r\nvoter was much discussed, and was regarded as an important guarantee of\r\ncharacter.[212:3] In England poor rates are assessed upon the occupiers,\r\nnot the owners, of the property, and it is still provided that all\r\nvoters whose qualification depends upon the occupation of land (except\r\nlodgers, who are not from the legal point of view occupiers) must have\r\nbeen rated and must have paid their rates.[212:4] But this means only\r\nthat the rates must have been paid on their behalf; and the practice of\r\ncompounding by the landlord for small tenements is so universal that\r\npractically the landlord pays the rates in almost all cases where the\r\noccupiers would be likely to fail to do so. In England, therefore, the\r\nrequirement that the rates must have been paid has little or no effect\r\non the electorate. In Scotland, on the other hand, this is not the case.\r\nThere the rates are divided between the owner and the occupier, and the\r\npractice of compounding does not exist. The result is that many\r\noccupiers are omitted from the parliamentary register every year on\r\naccount of their failure to pay rates. For the whole of Scotland the\r\nnumber reaches fifty thousand.[213:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Actual Extent of the Suffrage.]\r\n\r\nA comparison of the number of electors on the register with the total\r\npopulation shows that England is not very far to-day from manhood\r\nsuffrage. The ratio is about one in six,[213:2] whereas the normal\r\nproportion of males above the age of twenty-one years (making no\r\nallowance for paupers, criminals, and other persons disqualified by the\r\nlaws of all countries), is somewhat less than one in four. The only\r\nclasses excluded from the franchise are domestic servants, bachelors\r\nliving with their parents and occupying no premises on their own\r\naccount, and persons whose change of abode deprives them of a vote. Now,\r\nthese are not necessarily the worst political elements in the community.\r\nNo doubt the provision requiring twelve months' occupation excludes\r\nvagrants, but it also excludes excellent artisans who migrate with\r\nchanges of trade, and other persons whose calling compels them to move\r\nfrom place to place. In 1902 a school-teacher, in a plaintive letter to\r\n_The Times_,[213:3] described how he had never been able to vote at a\r\ngeneral election. He had graduated with honours from his university, was\r\nnearly forty years old, married, and prosperous; but his very success in\r\nhis profession, by involving changes of residence, had always cost him\r\nthe right to vote. It is a common saying that many respectable people\r\nare disfranchised from this cause, although the slums, which move\r\nlittle, are not.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the franchise is, indeed, historical rather\r\nthan rational. It is complicated, uncertain, expensive in the machinery\r\nrequired, and excludes a certain number of people whom there is no\r\nreason for excluding, while it admits many people who ought not to be\r\nadmitted if any one is to be debarred. But the hardship or injustice\r\naffects individuals alone. No considerable class in the community is\r\naggrieved, and neither political party is now anxious to extend the\r\nfranchise. The Conservatives are not by tradition in favour of such a\r\ncourse, and leading Liberals have come to realise that any further\r\nextension would be likely to benefit their opponents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plural Voting.]\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no urgent demand for a closer approach to manhood\r\nsuffrage, there has long been a strong desire to restrict each man to a\r\nsingle vote. That a man should have a vote in two different\r\nconstituencies is as clearly a breach of political equality as if he had\r\ntwo votes in the same place; and for this reason, as well as from the\r\nfact that most of the men who have more than one vote are Conservatives,\r\na demand for the abolition of plural voting has been for many years an\r\narticle in the Liberal programme. So far as the franchise is not\r\ndependent upon residence there is nothing to prevent a man from voting\r\nin every constituency where he possesses a qualification.[214:1] Now for\r\nthe counties and the universities residence is not necessary; and even\r\nin the boroughs, where it is required, plural voting is restrained only\r\nin part, because a man may have more than one residence, and because\r\nresidence within seven miles of the borough is enough, so that the men\r\nwho carry on their business in the town and live in the suburbs are\r\nqualified in the borough by reason of their offices or workshops, and in\r\na suburban borough or the county by reason of their dwellings.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to determine how many persons are entitled to vote in\r\nmore than one constituency, or how much they affect the result of\r\nelections. In a return of resident and non-resident voters made to\r\nParliament in 1888,[214:2] it appeared, as was natural, that the\r\nproportion of the latter was greatest among the freeholders in the\r\ncounties, nearly one quarter of whom were non-residents. In all there\r\nwere about two hundred thousand non-resident voters in England and\r\nWales. This is between four and five per cent. of the total electorate,\r\nwhich does not seem an important fraction; but it fails to express the\r\nfull effect of plural voting, because it does not include the persons\r\nwho have more than one residence, or who live outside the limits of a\r\nborough but within seven miles of it, or those again who reside in a\r\nborough that forms part of a county and are qualified to vote in both.\r\nMoreover, the men with more than one vote, although a small proportion\r\nof the whole electorate of the kingdom, are quite numerous enough to\r\nturn the scale in a close constituency.\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of the new Liberal ministry in the session of\r\n1906, was to bring in a bill to abolish plural voting altogether. This\r\ncould not be done simply by making residence a condition of the\r\nfranchise, because in England a man may have more than one residence.\r\nThe measure provided, therefore, that the voter must elect in which of\r\nthe places where he possessed a qualification he would be registered,\r\nand forbade him to vote anywhere else. The bill was passed by the House\r\nof Commons, but rejected forthwith by the Lords.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Number of Electors by Classes.]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe the number of voters registered under the\r\ndifferent franchises. In 1906 the figures for the United Kingdom were as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n     Owners           579,827\r\n     Occupiers      6,357,817\r\n     Lodgers          226,191\r\n     Freemen, etc.     57,728\r\n     Univs.            45,150\r\n                    ---------\r\n     Total          7,266,706\r\n\r\nBy far the greater part of the voters are registered as occupiers, a\r\nclass which includes both the householders and the ten-pound occupiers.\r\nThe table contains a surprisingly small number of lodgers; and this is\r\ndue to the fact that whereas the lists of owners and freemen are\r\nvirtually permanent, and the list of occupiers is made up by the\r\noverseers of the poor from the rate-book,[216:1] a lodger alone must\r\nmake every year a personal application to be registered.[216:2] The\r\nresult is that no one seeks to be enrolled as a lodger if he has any\r\nother franchise; and no doubt many lodgers, who have no other\r\nqualification, neglect to register at all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disqualifications for Voting.]\r\n\r\nA characteristic, although not in itself a very important peculiarity of\r\nthe English electoral law, is the rule depriving peers of the right to\r\nvote;[216:3] and in fact the Commons still profess to be highly jealous\r\nof any part taken in electoral campaigns by members of the House of\r\nLords.[216:4] In other respects the disqualifications for voting in\r\nEngland are now much the same as in other countries. There are the usual\r\nrules excluding aliens, infants, idiots, paupers, convicts, and persons\r\nwho have been guilty of corrupt practices at elections. Formerly there\r\nwere also provisions excluding large classes of public officers, but\r\nthese have been repealed, except in the case of the Irish police, of\r\ncertain officers directly concerned in the conduct of elections, and of\r\npersons employed and paid by the candidates.\r\n\r\nWomen cannot vote for members of Parliament, although they possess the\r\nfranchise for almost all local elections. This question has of late\r\naroused much interest. Although both of the political parties have at\r\ntimes adopted resolutions in favour of woman suffrage, the leading men\r\nin both are divided about it, and the Labour Party may be said to be the\r\nonly political organisation of men in England that want it heartily. But\r\nmany women are agitating for it very vigorously, and the most\r\nenthusiastic of them have sought martyrdom by refusing to pay taxes, by\r\ncreating a disturbance in the ladies' gallery of the House of Commons,\r\nand by getting arrested for speech-making in the Palace Yard. They are\r\nknown as Suffragettes, and evidently have faith in the old adage that\r\nParliament never redresses grievances until they are brought forcibly to\r\nits notice. Women will no doubt ultimately obtain the suffrage if they\r\nare substantially united in wanting it, and the principle is certainly\r\nmaking great headway among them in England to-day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Registration.]\r\n\r\nIt is not enough that a man possesses the requisite qualifications for\r\nthe franchise. His name must also be upon the register of voters for the\r\nconstituency, and the process of compiling the register is cumbrous and\r\nexpensive. This is due in part to the complicated nature of the various\r\nfranchises, which may involve intricate questions of law and of fact,\r\nand partly to the practice of leaving the duty of proving claims and\r\nobjections mainly in the hands of private individuals. The lists are\r\nmade up in the first instance by the overseers of the poor in each\r\nparish; but any person whose name is omitted may claim to have it\r\ninserted, and any person whose name is on the lists may file an\r\nobjection to any other name which he thinks ought not to have been\r\nincluded. These claims and objections are heard in September by the\r\nRevising Barrister--a barrister of not less than seven years' standing,\r\nappointed for the purpose by the judge in whose circuit the constituency\r\nlies, and paid by the Treasury. It is his duty to revise the register by\r\nadding the names of persons who prove their claims, and by striking off\r\nnames improperly inserted. In doing this he is not limited to names\r\nagainst which objections have been filed, for he has a right to make\r\ninquiries and summon witnesses on his own motion.[217:1] In practice,\r\nhowever, the cases are prepared beforehand, and argued before him, by\r\nthe local agents of the two political parties, whose object is to get\r\nthe names of their partisans on to the register and keep off those of\r\ntheir opponents.\r\n\r\nThe process is repeated every year, and the work and cost involved are\r\nconsiderable, the money being provided by the candidate for Parliament,\r\nor by means of subscriptions to the party funds. This is one of the\r\nthings that makes elections expensive; and it helps to explain the\r\ndesire of each party in a constituency to have a candidate at all times,\r\neven when an election is not impending. In Scotland registration is far\r\nless of a burden upon the parties, and costs the candidate very little,\r\nbecause the qualifications of all the voters, except the lodgers, are\r\ninvestigated by a public officer, called the assessor, and a corps of\r\nassistants, with the result that there are few claims or objections for\r\nthe political agents to contest. There seems to be no self-evident\r\nreason why this should not be done everywhere, and for every class of\r\nvoter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[195:1] This feeling was forcibly expressed by Godkin in his essay on\r\n\"The Decline of Legislatures.\"\r\n\r\n[196:1] This is elaborately discussed by Charles Benoist, _La Crise de\r\nl'Etat Moderne_.\r\n\r\n[197:1] For \"keeping one's name on the books\" the university sometimes\r\nrequires a fee which diminishes seriously the number of graduates\r\nentitled to vote either for Parliament or on academic questions.

The Borough of Wandsworth,\r\nfor example, had, in 1901, a population of 179,877. These figures are\r\ntaken from single-member constituencies; for it so happens that the\r\ntwo-member boroughs, when their population is divided by two, are\r\nneither among the largest or the smallest.

Papers, 1866, LVII., 47, p. 5. In\r\nScotland the proportion was 18.3 per cent. _Ibid._, 805, p. 12.\r\n\r\n[207:1] 30-31 Vic., c. 102.\r\n\r\n[207:2] One of the safeguards in the bill was the provision that\r\nhouseholders must be separately rated for the relief of the poor, and\r\nmust have paid their rates; and in order to insure personal payment by\r\nthe householder, the Act forbade the common practice of rating the owner\r\nof dwellings in lieu of the occupier. But the practice saved the local\r\nauthorities much trouble. It enabled them to receive the rates in a\r\nsingle payment from the owner of a number of houses, instead of\r\ncollecting small sums from many tenants; and they were in the habit of\r\nallowing a commission or rebate to owners who paid in this way.\r\n\r\nThe convenience of the old practice was so great that in 1869 it was\r\nagain permitted; and the Act (32-33 Vic., c. 41) also provided that such\r\na payment by the owner should be deemed a payment by the occupier for\r\nthe purpose of the franchise, thus sweeping away the safeguard of\r\npersonal payment of rates.\r\n\r\nThe practice is called compounding for rates, and the tenant whose rates\r\nwere paid by the landlord was the subject of fierce discussion under the\r\nname of \"compound householder,\" although it was in fact the rate, and\r\nnot the house or the holder thereof, that was compounded.\r\n\r\n[208:1] It will be observed that the 10_l._ occupier differed from the\r\nhouseholder in the fact that he might occupy any shop, warehouse, or\r\nother building, whereas the householder was qualified only by a\r\ndwelling-house. On the other hand, the premises occupied by a 10_l._\r\noccupier must be of the clear yearly value of 10_l._, whereas the\r\nhouseholder was qualified without regard to the value of the house.\r\n\r\nBy the Act of 1867 the householder might occupy any part of a house used\r\nas a separate dwelling; while the 10_l._ occupier must occupy a whole\r\nbuilding. This difference was, however, done away with in 1878 by an act\r\n(41-42 Vic., c. 26, Sec. 5), which provided that the occupation might be\r\nof any separate part of the building, if that part were of the yearly\r\nvalue of 10_l._.\r\n\r\n[208:2] 31-32 Vic., cc. 48, 49.\r\n\r\n[208:3] They ran from a little less than one in twenty-one to a little\r\nmore than one in twenty. _Cf._ Com.

The extension of the franchise in Ireland in 1850\r\nnearly trebled the number of county voters there, in spite of the\r\nfalling off in population.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed that the growth in registered voters is not an exact\r\nmeasure of the increase in the number of persons qualified for the\r\nfranchise, because with the organisation of the political parties there\r\nhas been a greater and greater effort to make every man register who is\r\nentitled to do so.\r\n\r\n[208:5] Com.

In all counties, and in Scotch and Irish boroughs, the\r\nreturning officer is the sheriff or his deputy. In English boroughs he\r\nis the mayor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Procedure at Elections.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Before the Ballot Act.]\r\n\r\nUntil 1872 candidates for Parliament were nominated _viva voce_ at the\r\nhustings,--a temporary platform erected for the purpose. If more names\r\nwere proposed than there were seats to be filled, the election was said\r\nto be contested, and a show of hands was called for. Many of the persons\r\npresent were probably not entitled to vote, but that was of no\r\nimportance, because the show of hands was merely formal, and a poll was\r\nalways demanded. A time for taking it was then fixed, extending over a\r\nnumber of days, during which the electors declared their votes publicly.\r\nThis gave a chance for bribery, for the intimidation of voters, and for\r\ndisturbances of various kinds, not seldom deliberately planned. The\r\ndisorderly scenes that accompanied an election have often been described\r\nboth in histories, and in novels such as \"The Pickwick Papers\" and\r\n\"Coningsby,\" written by men familiar with the old polling days. In 1872\r\nthe method of conducting elections was changed by the Ballot Act,[219:1]\r\nwhich introduced secret voting, and made the procedure more orderly in\r\nmany other respects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Existing Procedure.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nomination.]\r\n\r\nNominations are now made in writing by proposer, seconder, and eight\r\nothers, all registered voters. If only one person is nominated for a\r\nseat, the candidate, or candidates if it be a two-member constituency,\r\nare at once declared elected; nor is this a hypothetical case, because,\r\nfor reasons that will be described hereafter, usually more than one\r\nfourth, and sometimes more than one third, of the seats are not\r\ncontested at a general election.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Election Days.]\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the election is contested, a day is fixed for the\r\npoll; for voting is now confined to a single day in each constituency.\r\nIt is not the same day in all of them, on account of the latitude still\r\ngiven to the returning officer. He has a right, within certain limits\r\nwhich are different for counties and boroughs, to determine how many\r\ndays shall elapse between his receipt of the writ and the election (that\r\nis, the nomination) and how many between the election and the\r\npoll.[220:1] The result is that in boroughs the voting may take place\r\nanywhere from four to eight days after the receipt of the writ; and in\r\ncounties anywhere from six to seventeen days. Now, as the writs are sent\r\nout by mail at the same time, the voting at the general election covers\r\na period of more than two weeks.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that such a power to arrange the order of elections\r\nwould be used by the returning officer to help his own party, and this\r\nis said to be done, not systematically over the country, but in\r\nparticular places. The multiplicity of election days has another and\r\nmore important political effect; for it gives time to the out-voters, as\r\nthe non-residents are called, to get from one constituency to another,\r\nand thus it facilitates voting in more than one place. For this reason\r\nthe Liberal party--which is opposed to plural voting--has demanded in\r\nits platform that all elections should take place on the same day. To\r\nthis it has been objected that the change would, by lengthening the\r\nelectoral period in the boroughs, increase the fatigue and cost to\r\nborough candidates; and in view of the rate at which labour and money\r\nare expended on such occasions the objection is not altogether without\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Method of Voting.]\r\n\r\nFor the convenience of voting the constituency is divided into a number\r\nof polling districts; and when an election is contested, the vote is\r\ntaken in these districts between eight in the morning and eight in the\r\nevening of the appointed day. The method of voting under the Australian\r\nsystem of secret ballot, which was adopted in 1872, need not be\r\ndescribed, because in some form its use has become well-nigh universal\r\nin civilised countries.[221:1] It may be noted, however, that the Ballot\r\nAct has never been extended to the universities, where voting is still\r\ndone orally, or by means of a voting paper tendered at the polls by\r\nanother elector to whom it has been intrusted.[221:2] In fact most of\r\nthe university votes are given by proxy--a practice which was introduced\r\nin 1861,[221:3] and would be abolished by the ballot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Legislation against Corruption.]\r\n\r\nBefore the Reform Act of 1832, huge sums of money were sometimes\r\nexpended at parliamentary elections, and bribery and corruption were\r\nrife. Nor did the disfranchisement of rotten boroughs, and the extension\r\nof the franchise, by any means put an entire stop to the practice. Even\r\nas late as 1880 the special commissions appointed to inquire into the\r\nconduct of a number of boroughs, for which election petitions had been\r\nfiled, found a bad state of affairs.[221:4] In Macclesfield and\r\nSandwich about half the voters had been guilty of bribery and other\r\ncorrupt practices;[222:1] and as a result of the investigation those two\r\nboroughs, which were decidedly the worst, were entirely disfranchised. A\r\nseries of attempts have been made to root out the evil by legislation.\r\nThey have been more and more elaborate, and reached their culmination in\r\nthe Corrupt and Illegal Practices Act of 1883.[222:2] These laws seek to\r\nrestrain improper conduct at elections by several methods; first, by\r\nforbidding altogether certain classes of acts, which either interfere\r\ndirectly with the purity of elections, or have proved a source of\r\ninordinate expense; second, by limiting the total amount that can be\r\nspent, and the purposes for which it can be used; third, by requiring\r\nthat disbursements shall be made through one recognised agent, who is\r\nobliged to return to the government a full account thereof; and, fourth,\r\nby imposing for violation of these provisions penalties, political and\r\nother, inflicted not only by criminal process, but also summarily by the\r\ntribunal that tries the validity of a controverted election.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Corrupt Practices.]\r\n\r\nThe most demoralising acts forbidden by law are known as corrupt\r\npractices. They are bribery, treating, undue influence, and\r\npersonation.[222:3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bribery.]\r\n\r\nBribery at elections is, of course, criminal in all countries; and in\r\nEngland the offence is defined in great detail, for just as there are\r\nseven recognised kinds of lies, so the English statutes describe seven\r\ndistinct methods by which bribery can be committed.[222:4] It is\r\nunnecessary for anybody who is not engaged in electoral work to remember\r\nthese; and it is enough here to point out that they include a promise,\r\nor endeavour, to procure any office or employment for a voter in order\r\nto influence his vote.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treating.]\r\n\r\nTreating differs from bribery in the fact that bribery involves a\r\ncontract for a vote, express or implied, whereas the person who treats\r\nobtains no promise from the voter, and relies only upon his general\r\nsense of gratitude. But, as one of the judges remarked in the trial of\r\nan election petition some years ago, it is difficult in the large\r\nconstituencies of the present day to bribe successfully, while a small\r\namount of treating is sufficient to procure a great deal of\r\npopularity.[223:1] This is particularly true in England, where the habit\r\nof treating is made easy by the existence of sharp class distinctions.\r\nTreating was forbidden as long ago as the days of William III., and it\r\nis now defined[223:2] as giving, or paying the expense of giving, \"any\r\nmeat, drink, entertainment or provision to or for any person for the\r\npurpose of corruptly influencing that person or any other person to give\r\nor refrain from giving his vote.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Undue Influence.]\r\n\r\nUndue influence is defined by the Act of 1883[223:3] as making use, or\r\nthreatening to make use, of any force, violence, or restraint, or\r\ninflicting, or threatening to inflict, any temporal or spiritual injury\r\non any person in order to influence, or on account of, his vote; or by\r\nduress or fraud impeding the free exercise of the franchise by any man.\r\nThese provisions cover threats by an employer to discharge\r\nworkmen,[223:4] and the denunciation by priests of spiritual penalties\r\non political opponents.[223:5]\r\n\r\nPersonation it is unnecessary to describe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Corrupt Practices avoid the Election.]\r\n\r\nAll these corrupt practices are criminal offences punishable by fine or\r\nimprisonment, and by the loss of political rights for seven\r\nyears.[223:6] What is more important for our purpose, they are liable to\r\ncost the member his seat; for if upon the trial of a controverted\r\nelection the court reports that any corrupt practice has been committed\r\nby the candidate, or that bribery or personation has been committed with\r\nhis knowledge and consent, his election is void, and he is forever\r\nincapable of being elected to Parliament by that constituency.[224:1]\r\nMoreover, if the election court reports that a corrupt practice has been\r\ncommitted by his agents, although he may be personally quite innocent,\r\nhis election is void, and he is incapable of being chosen by that\r\nconstituency for seven years.[224:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: But only if done by the Candidate or his Agents.]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that in order to set aside an election, the corrupt\r\npractice must be brought home to the candidate, personally or through\r\nhis agents. In accordance with the older traditions of English public\r\nlife, the election is regarded as the affair of the candidates alone.\r\nThe action of party organisations, or other bodies, is not taken into\r\naccount,[224:3] and their conduct has no effect upon the result, unless\r\ntheir relations with the candidate have been such as to make them his\r\nagents. So long as a political association is urging the general\r\ninterests of the party, rather than supporting a particular candidate,\r\nhe is not responsible for their acts. It has been held, for example,\r\nthat a candidate is not responsible for treating by such an association,\r\nalthough he was present and spoke at the meeting where it was done, if\r\nit was got up by them for their own purposes, and not to assist in his\r\nelection.[224:4] It has been held, also, that a payment by a party\r\norganisation of bills for music and beer at public meetings, previous to\r\nan election, and even the candidate's subscription to their funds, need\r\nnot be included in his election expenses, unless the organisation was a\r\nsham supported by him.[224:5]\r\n\r\nIn all such cases it is difficult to prove agency to the satisfaction of\r\nan election court. The time must come in any election, however, when the\r\nlocal party association by active assistance to the candidate becomes\r\nhis agent.[225:1] But this is not true of other bodies less directly\r\nconnected with the party organisation, which are, nevertheless, in the\r\nhabit of doing a great deal of work at elections. Thus it has been held\r\nthat a Licensed Victuallers Association, having a distinct and direct\r\ninterest in the election, did not become the agent of the candidate,\r\nalthough it played an important part in the campaign.[225:2] That this\r\nleaves a door wide open for corrupt influence is self-evident.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Corruption.]\r\n\r\nTo the general principle that a corrupt practice must be brought home to\r\nthe candidate there is one exception. If bribery, treating, personation,\r\nintimidation, or undue influence, whether physical or ecclesiastical,\r\nhas been general in the constituency--that is, so extensive that the\r\nvoting could not have been the free expression of the will of the\r\nelectorate--the result of the election is invalid at common law,\r\nalthough neither the candidate nor his agent are directly\r\nimplicated.[225:3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Distinction between Corrupt and Illegal Practices.]\r\n\r\nBesides corrupt practices, certain other acts are forbidden under the\r\nname of illegal practices; but the provisions relating to them are\r\nmainly designed to restrain the expense of elections, and will be\r\ndescribed under that head. The essential distinction between the two\r\npractices is much like that which lawyers were formerly in the habit of\r\ndrawing in the case of crimes between _malum prohibitum_ and _malum in\r\nse_. A corrupt practice involves moral turpitude, and it is necessary to\r\nprove a corrupt intent.[225:4] A gift to a voter, for example, is not\r\nbribery unless it is made for the purpose of influencing his vote; but\r\nan illegal practice is simply an act forbidden by statute, and as\r\nsuch--in the case, for instance, of a payment of expenses above the\r\nmaximum fixed by law--is illegal without regard to the motive with which\r\nit is done. For this reason a corrupt practice cannot be\r\nexcused,[226:1] while the election court may grant relief from the\r\nconsequences of an illegal practice where it is trivial in itself, and\r\nwas committed without the connivance of the candidate who took all\r\nreasonable means to prevent it; or where, although the direct act of the\r\ncandidate or his election agent, it arose from inadvertence, accidental\r\nmiscalculation, or other reasonable cause; or, finally, where a failure\r\nto make a return of expenses has been due to illness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Practices Tending to Lower the Tone of Elections.]\r\n\r\nSome acts which, without involving great expense, tend to lower the tone\r\nof elections, are treated as illegal practices, and forbidden by\r\nstatute. Such are the use for committee rooms[226:2] of premises where\r\nliquor is sold, and the furnishing of voters with cockades, ribbons, or\r\nother marks of distinction,[226:3] a proceeding which is believed to\r\nengender broils.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Restraint of Expenditure.]\r\n\r\nOther acts apparently harmless are prohibited in order to prevent\r\nextravagance. The most curious example of this is the provision\r\nforbidding the use of hired carriages to take voters to the\r\npolls.[226:4] Such a rule may seem unnecessary; but before the Act of\r\n1883, by which it was enacted, thousands of pounds were said to have\r\nbeen spent in certain cases for the conveyance of electors. The Act does\r\nnot forbid the use of carriages, but only of hired ones; and the result\r\nis that the private carriages and motor cars of wealthy partisans,\r\nsometimes blazoned with ancient armorial bearings, are placed at the\r\ndisposal of the candidate. In fact in estimating the chances of an\r\nelection one constantly hears that the Conservative has the advantage of\r\na larger number of carriages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Authorised Expenses.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Employment.]\r\n\r\nBut by far the most systematic effort to restrain extravagance at\r\nelections is found in the provisions that prescribe on the one hand the\r\nobjects of expenditure, and on the other its total amount. A schedule to\r\nthe Act of 1883 enumerates the objects for which expenses may be\r\nlegally incurred, and the first part of the schedule deals with the\r\npersons who may be employed. These are: one election agent;[227:1] a\r\npolling agent to watch the voting at each polling station; and clerks\r\nand messengers in proportion to population, the allowance being somewhat\r\nmore liberal in counties than in boroughs on account of the greater area\r\nof the constituency. The act provides that, except as authorised by this\r\nschedule, no person shall be employed for pay;[227:2] and that no paid\r\nemployee shall vote.[227:3] It may be noticed that among the list of\r\npersons who can be employed, canvassers are not mentioned, and hence the\r\nuse of paid canvassers is illegal.[227:4] Now, as canvassing, that is\r\nthe personal solicitation of votes, is by far the most effective part of\r\nthe work done at an election, each candidate is always assisted by an\r\narmy of volunteers. Wherever possible he is also helped by the agents of\r\nother constituencies, or of distinct associations, who, not being paid\r\nby him, and in fact, receiving no additional pay for their services on\r\nthis occasion, are not within the prohibition of the law.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other Expenses.]\r\n\r\nThe other expenditures authorised by the schedule are printing,\r\nadvertising, stationery, postage, and the like; public meetings; one\r\ncommittee room for every five hundred electors;[227:5] and miscellaneous\r\nexpenses not exceeding two hundred pounds for matters not otherwise\r\nillegal. The candidate is also allowed to incur personal expenses for\r\ntravelling and hotel bills;[227:6] and, finally, there are the charges\r\nof the returning officer for the cost of erecting polling booths, the\r\npayment of persons on duty thereat, and the other expenses attending the\r\nelection.[227:7] These last charges are divided between the candidates\r\nand they are by no means small, as may be seen from the fact that at\r\nthe general election of 1900 they amounted, for the whole United\r\nKingdom, to 150,278_l._ 10_s._ 11_d._, or nearly one fifth of the whole\r\nexpense incurred.[228:1] The National Liberal Federation has, indeed,\r\nrepeatedly urged in its programme that such charges ought to be defrayed\r\nby the state, instead of being a burden upon the candidates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Maximum Expenditure.]\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce the cost of elections, Parliament has not only\r\nenumerated the objects for which money may be used, but has also set a\r\nmaximum limit to the amount that may be spent.[228:2] In the case of\r\nboroughs this is fixed at three hundred and fifty pounds if the\r\nregistered electors do not exceed two thousand, with an additional\r\nthirty pounds for every thousand electors above that number. In the\r\ncounties the scale is somewhat higher, six hundred and fifty pounds\r\nbeing allowed where the registered electors do not exceed two thousand,\r\nwith sixty pounds for each thousand electors more.[228:3] These sums do\r\nnot, however, represent the total cost, for they include neither the\r\npersonal expenses of the candidate to an amount of one hundred pounds,\r\nnor the charges of the returning officers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Penalties for Illegal Payments.]\r\n\r\nThe rules in regard to election expenses are furnished with sanctions of\r\nthe same nature as those attached to corrupt practices, although the\r\npenalties are less severe. In addition to the criminal punishments that\r\nmay be inflicted, it is provided that a candidate, or his election\r\nagent, who violates those rules shall be guilty of an illegal\r\npractice;[228:4] and that if a candidate is guilty, personally or by his\r\nagents, of an illegal practice (from the consequences of which he has\r\nnot been relieved as heretofore described) he shall lose his seat, and\r\ncannot be elected by the same constituency during the life of that\r\nParliament.[228:5]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Election Agent.]\r\n\r\nIt is one thing to make elaborate regulations about election expenses,\r\nand it is quite a different thing to insure their observance. The device\r\nadopted for this purpose in England is that of requiring each candidate\r\nto appoint an election agent, who is responsible for the disbursements.\r\nExcept for the personal expenses of the candidate, to an amount not\r\nexceeding one hundred pounds, no payment of election expenses can be\r\nmade by the candidate, or by any person on his behalf, except through\r\nthe election agent,[229:1] and no contract for any such expenses is\r\nvalid unless made by him.[229:2] Within thirty-five days after the\r\nelection the agent must give to the returning officer an account of all\r\nhis payments, and of all sums that he has received from the candidate or\r\nany one else, for the purposes of the campaign; and the candidate must\r\ncertify that the account is true to the best of his knowledge and\r\nbelief.[229:3]\r\n\r\nThe class of person selected for this duty is not only a matter of great\r\nimportance to the candidate, but upon it depends also in large measure\r\nthe purity of elections. A candidate may act as his own election agent,\r\nbut this is rarely done. Usually, though by no means invariably, he\r\ntakes the paid secretary of the local political association, who has the\r\nadvantage of knowing the constituency better than any one else; and the\r\nPractical Manual for Parliamentary Elections, issued by the Conservative\r\nparty, advises that course.[229:4] Rogers, on the other hand, in his\r\nwork on Elections,[229:5] warns candidates that it is unwise to select\r\nsuch persons, because \"when this is done attempts are frequently made to\r\nsaddle the candidate with responsibility for the acts of the association\r\nand its members.\" \"A further danger,\" he remarks, \"arises in such cases\r\nof the election expenses being confused with or concealed under\r\nregistration or other expenses of the association.\" With the modern\r\norganisation of parties a confusion of that kind is liable to occur in\r\nany event; and perhaps it is not so much dreaded by candidates as the\r\nauthor of the text-book on elections might imply. In spite of any\r\ndangers that may lurk in the practice, it is not only common, but\r\napparently growing; and in fact the occupation of a paid secretary and\r\nagent has developed into a profession whose characteristics will be\r\ndiscussed in the chapters on party organisations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Election Court.]\r\n\r\nFormerly the validity of elections was decided by the House of Commons\r\nitself, with the natural consequence that politics were a large factor\r\nin the result. To such an extent was this true that the fall of Sir\r\nRobert Walpole was brought about by a hostile vote on an election case.\r\nIn 1770 the matter was placed by statute in the hands of select\r\ncommittees of the House; but that did not put an end to political bias,\r\nand finally in 1868, the trial of election petitions, whether filed on\r\nthe ground of a miscount, or of corrupt or illegal practices, was\r\ncommitted to a judicial body. The tribunal now consists of two judges of\r\nthe King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice, selected by the\r\nother judges of that division.[230:1]\r\n\r\nA defeated candidate, or any voter, may present to the court a petition\r\nstating the grounds on which he claims that the election is invalid, and\r\nthe case is then tried, witnesses are examined, and costs are awarded,\r\naccording to the usual course of judicial proceedings. The decision\r\ntakes the form of a report to the Speaker of the House of Commons, but\r\nit is really a final judgment upon the questions involved, for if the\r\ncourt finds that corrupt or illegal practices have taken place, the\r\nreport has the effect not merely of avoiding the election, but of\r\nsubjecting the candidate, and any guilty persons, to the political\r\nincapacities which those practices entail.[230:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Results of the Corrupt Practices Act.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reduction of Expense.]\r\n\r\nSo far as the reduction of the cost of elections is concerned, the\r\nEnglish method of dealing with the subject has certainly been\r\nsuccessful. According to the returns laid before Parliament, the total\r\naggregate expenses incurred by candidates throughout the United Kingdom\r\nat the general election of 1880--the last that took place before the\r\nCorrupt Practices Act of 1883--was 1,736,781_l._; at the next election\r\nin 1885 it fell to 1,026,645_l._, and on every subsequent occasion it\r\nhas been less than that. In 1900 it was 777,429_l._, which is not far\r\nfrom the average in these days. The expense of English elections is,\r\nhowever, far from small to-day. In 1900 the average cost for the United\r\nKingdom in constituencies that were not uncontested was four shillings\r\nand four pence, for every vote cast.[231:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Returns of Expenses Sometimes Incomplete.]\r\n\r\nMoreover the returns undoubtedly do not in every case include all that\r\nis spent. A recent series of letters to _The Times_, under the title\r\n\"The worries of a parliamentary representative,\" throws light on this\r\nsubject.[231:2] It opened with a letter from the member for a Welsh\r\nborough complaining that about a month after he had signed the return of\r\nhis election expenses he received a note from his agent in regard to\r\nclaims by workers at the election; that upon his refusal to pay any such\r\nclaims in violation of the Corrupt Practices Act the agent wrote asking\r\nwhether he would or would not fulfil the obligations made on his behalf\r\nduring the election. His continued refusal, the member declared, had\r\nmade him unpopular with many of his former supporters, who were now\r\ntrying to prevent his renomination. In answer to this charge the agent,\r\nin a letter to _The Times_, explained that all he had meant was that the\r\nmember \"should find some way--legal, of course--of expressing his\r\ngratitude to men who had worked splendidly in his cause;\" and he added\r\nthat this way had eventually been found, its name being \"undoubted\r\ndistress.\" In his reply in _The Times_ the member denied that his relief\r\nof distress in the constituency had any relation to the election, or was\r\na mode of expressing gratitude to men who had worked for him. It would\r\nbe rash to assert that indirect means of rewarding party workers are not\r\noften found; and in fact another election agent stated in a letter to\r\n_The Times_[231:3] in the course of the foregoing controversy, that\r\npromises of such a nature, made in behalf of the candidate, were\r\nunfortunately too common.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ease of Evasion.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficult to Prove Agency;]\r\n\r\nApart from occasional acts involving direct violations of the Corrupt\r\nPractices Act by the candidate himself, the statute has holes through\r\nwhich others can pass so readily that an election agent has been known\r\nto speak of the return of expenses as largely a farce. In fact the\r\nelaborate provisions of the law can easily be evaded if the candidate\r\nand his agent have a mind to do so. If they only keep their eyes shut\r\ntight enough, and are sufficiently ignorant of what goes on, it is very\r\ndifficult to connect them with corrupt or illegal practices in such a\r\nway as to avoid the election.[232:1] An agent from another constituency\r\nmay pay the railway fares of out-voters. The Primrose League, or some\r\nother body, may give picnics, teas and what not, which would be corrupt\r\ntreating if done by the candidate, but for which he is not held\r\nresponsible. The brewers may furnish free beer in public houses where\r\nvoters are collected before going to the polls, and yet the candidate\r\nhas done nothing to forfeit his seat. Nor is this an imaginary danger;\r\nfor, with the introduction of what is known as the tied-house system,\r\nthe publicans have come under the control of the great brewing\r\nestablishments, which have to-day a huge stake in the results of\r\nparliamentary elections. Agency, in short, is a very difficult thing to\r\nestablish in such cases. As Rogers, who devotes a whole chapter to the\r\nsubject, remarks: \"It is to conceal agency, and so to relieve the\r\ncandidate from the consequences of corruption practised on his behalf,\r\nthat efforts of unscrupulous men engaged in the conduct of an election\r\nhave been generally directed, and it is not too much to say that an\r\nelection inquiry has been more frequently baffled from a failure in the\r\nproof of agency than from all other causes put together.\"[232:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Or Know When Election Period Begins.]\r\n\r\nThen there is the uncertainty when the election period begins, and hence\r\nwhat payments must be included in the return of election expenses. The\r\nAct of 1883 defines a candidate, unless the context otherwise requires,\r\nas one who is nominated or declared to be such on or after the issue of\r\nthe writ or the dissolution or vacancy in consequence of which it is\r\nissued.[233:1] But clearly this does not mean that a corrupt act\r\ncommitted earlier will not avoid the election. On the contrary it is\r\nsettled by repeated decisions that a man may become a candidate, and his\r\nelection expenses may begin, before that date;[233:2] although it is\r\nimpossible to lay down any hard and fast limit of time.[233:3] A great\r\ndeal must depend on the nature of the expense itself. Registration, for\r\nexample, is something entirely distinct from the election, and the cost\r\nof registration, whenever incurred, need not be included in the return\r\nof expenses.[233:4] On the other hand proof of the actual purchase of a\r\nvote at any time would certainly cost the candidate his seat.[233:5]\r\nBetween these two extremes there are a great many acts whose character\r\nis affected by the proximity of an election. A subscription to a local\r\npolitical organisation, made when the dissolution was impending, has\r\nbeen held to be a part of the election expenses,[233:6] when it would\r\nnot be so under other circumstances;[233:7] and in the same way the\r\nquestion whether a gift of money or food to relieve distress in the\r\nconstituency is or is not made with a corrupt purpose of influencing\r\nvotes may depend upon the expectation of an election in the near\r\nfuture.[233:8]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nursing Constituencies.]\r\n\r\nAs general elections in England come at irregular intervals, and at\r\nshort notice, it is common to select candidates without regard to the\r\nprospect of a dissolution, sometimes years before it occurs; and in fact\r\nthe sitting member, having a presumptive right to stand again, is\r\nregarded in the light of a permanent candidate. Under these conditions\r\nit is the habit in most places for a candidate, who can afford it, to\r\ningratiate himself with his constituents by subscribing liberally to\r\npublic and charitable objects; and since a payment to be corrupt must be\r\nmade for the purpose of influencing particular voters[234:1]\r\nsubscriptions of this kind are not deemed corrupt; nor, unless given\r\nnear the time of an election, are they election expenses or illegal\r\npayments.[234:2] The practice is called nursing a constituency, and it\r\ntakes a great variety of forms, from a subscription for a cricket club\r\nto the founding of a hospital. The sums expended vary very much with the\r\nnature of the place and the wealth of the candidate, and no one knows\r\nhow large they are in the aggregate, because men do not state publicly\r\nwhat they give in this way; but as far as one can form an opinion, it\r\nwould appear that such gifts by a member of Parliament commonly amount\r\nto a number of hundred pounds a year. It is obvious that the custom of\r\nnursing, combined with the uncertainty about the time when the election\r\nperiod begins, opens a door to abuse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulty in Getting Evidence.]\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty in a strict enforcement of the election laws is\r\nconnected with the proof of the offence. A witness cannot, indeed,\r\nrefuse to give evidence on the ground that it will incriminate him, for\r\nthe law provides that he must testify; and if he tells the truth he is\r\nentitled to a certificate of indemnity, which protects him against\r\nprosecution.[234:3] But the facts that tend to establish bribery, for\r\nexample, are directly known, as a rule, only to persons who have the\r\nstrongest motives for concealing them; and the same thing is true to a\r\ngreater or less extent of other breaches of the election law. It is\r\nclear, therefore, that if the offence must be proved by legally\r\ncompetent evidence beyond reasonable doubt, as in criminal cases, an\r\nelection procured by improper means may well stand, just as many\r\ncriminals escape punishment; and this brings us to another question,\r\nthat of the efficiency of the election courts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Merits of the Election Courts.]\r\n\r\nThe system of sending petitions for trial to a couple of judges selected\r\nby the bench itself has provided a court as free as any human tribunal\r\ncan be from the party bias that always affects the decisions of such\r\nquestions by a legislative body.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Defects.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Expense of Petitions.]\r\n\r\nBut no institution is altogether without defects. A select committee on\r\nthe subject of election petitions reported in 1898 that the grievances\r\nalleged to exist in the present system related to delay, to the expense\r\ninvolved, and to the lack of security for costs in favour of the\r\nsuccessful party; and it recommended some changes in procedure to\r\nimprove these matters.[235:1] The expense of an election trial is\r\nundoubtedly great--sometimes thousands of pounds--and since the charges\r\nare borne by the litigants, and a favourable judgment involves a fresh\r\nelection, while the trial itself is likely to entail a certain amount of\r\nunpopularity, it is not surprising that a defeated candidate hesitates\r\nto file a petition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Uncertainty of the Result.]\r\n\r\nWith all respect to the select committee of the House of Commons, it\r\nwould seem to a foreign observer that the defects it reported are not\r\nthe only ones to be found in the existing system. The bringing of\r\nelection petitions is discouraged not only by the cost involved, but\r\nalso by uncertainty both in the result and in the grounds on which it\r\nwill be based. A candidate may feel convinced that his defeat was due to\r\ncorruption practised by his opponent, by the publicans, and by the local\r\npolitical organisation, and yet the court, finding some of these charges\r\nunproved, may think it unnecessary to inquire into others because much\r\ngraver questions are decisive of the case; the graver matter being\r\nthat, contrary to the provision forbidding \"marks of distinction,\" the\r\ndefendant's agent furnished his supporters with cards to wear in their\r\nhats.[236:1] Where serious corrupt practices are charged, the election\r\nmay be set aside on account of the payment of a railway fare to an\r\nout-voter.[236:2] And in a case where the facts stated by the court\r\nportrayed a bacchanalian orgy in the form of a drunken procession\r\nthrough the streets, headed by the candidate himself in a barouche, with\r\nsome direct evidence that he offered free drink to the crowd, the judges\r\nfound that there was no sufficient evidence of treating; but avoided the\r\nelection on account of the payment of two shillings for conveying a\r\nvoter to the polls.[236:3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attitude of the Judges.]\r\n\r\nSuch results are thoroughly unsatisfactory for both parties; to the\r\ndefeated party because he loses his seat; to the successful party\r\nbecause he does not want to have an election, which he believes to be\r\nvitiated by gross corruption, set aside on account of a trivial breach\r\nof the law. The main difficulty seems to lie in the attitude of mind of\r\nthe judges. They require a degree of proof of corrupt intent, which is\r\nvery proper in criminal cases, but which would seem to be out of place\r\nin an election petition. On a charge, for example, that an agent of the\r\ncandidate, to whom pay was promised, had voted, it was held necessary to\r\nprove an actual express promise of payment, and not such an implied\r\npromise as would support a civil action.[236:4] So, also, where a\r\ncandidate named Lowles caused to be distributed among the poor, some\r\ntime before an election, his own visiting cards exchangeable for food,\r\nand it was announced in a newspaper that gifts of food had been arranged\r\nby the Unionist candidate, one of the judges said: \"I cannot bring\r\nmyself to believe in the circumstances of this case that the motive of\r\nMr. Lowles in giving away the tickets, months before any election was\r\nimminent; was to influence voters.\"[237:1] Nor is this an isolated\r\ninstance. Where soup and coal tickets were distributed largely at the\r\nexpense of a candidate, who reminded voters, when the election came on\r\nsome months later, that he had given away soup, the court said that\r\n\"although . . . it would have been more prudent for the Respondent had\r\nhe kept aloof from the immediate distribution of the relief, we cannot\r\ninfer, from the evidence before us, that his motive or conduct was\r\ncorrupt.\"[237:2]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty seems to lie to some extent in the fact that a report of\r\ncorrupt or illegal practices by the court involves not only the setting\r\naside of an election, but the same loss of political rights as would\r\nfollow upon a conviction;[237:3] and, hence, the judges tend to require\r\nthe kind of evidence that would support a criminal prosecution.\r\nMoreover, they seem to find it incredible that a candidate for\r\nParliament can be guilty of the grosser kind of offences. One feels this\r\nvery strongly in reading the opinions in election cases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How Much Corruption Still Exists.]\r\n\r\nIf the present system of trying election petitions is not a complete\r\nsuccess, it is nevertheless certain that the old electoral abuses have\r\nbeen very much reduced. There is a current impression both in England\r\nand elsewhere that the bribery of voters in Great Britain has been\r\nentirely rooted out. But any one familiar with English elections knows\r\nthat this is by no means altogether true.[237:4] That the cases where\r\ngross corruption occurs are not made public by means of election\r\npetitions is due, partly to the reluctance to bring such petitions which\r\nhas already been pointed out, and partly to the fact that where bribery\r\nis extensive both sides are usually guilty. Bribery in England is\r\ndisappearing. In by far the greater part of the constituencies it does\r\nnot exist, and the elections are, on the whole, pure; but in a few\r\nplaces the old traditions still persist. These are mostly boroughs in\r\nthe South of England containing a considerable number of ancient\r\nfreemen, among whom corruption is sometimes widespread. The writer has\r\nheard the number of such places estimated by persons in a position to\r\nknow the facts at a score or two dozen. The names of several of them are\r\nwell known to every one who takes an active part in electoral work; but\r\neven in these boroughs the increase in the number of voters has lowered\r\nthe price paid for votes, and in some of them the practice is slowly\r\ndying out. It is only fair to add that it does not receive any\r\ncountenance or encouragement from the central authorities of the great\r\npolitical organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[219:1] 35-36 Vic., c. 33.\r\n\r\n[220:1] He must, within a day after receiving the writ in boroughs and\r\ntwo days in counties, give notice of the day of election. This must be\r\nnot less than three days in boroughs, or four in counties, after the\r\nnotice is given; and must be in boroughs within four days of the receipt\r\nof the writ, and counties within nine days. If, on the day fixed for\r\nnomination, the election is contested, he must appoint for the polling a\r\ndate falling within the next three days in boroughs, and not less than\r\ntwo nor more than six days distant in counties.\r\n\r\n[221:1] \"In one only of the three kingdoms the ballot helped to make a\r\ntruly vital difference; it dislodged the political power of the Irish\r\nlandlord.

Incurable insanity was a\r\ndisqualification at Common Law, and so by statute is confinement in a\r\nlunatic hospital. But it would seem that a temporary lunatic, if at\r\nlarge, is not incompetent to sit and vote.\r\n\r\nPeers are also excluded; and this is true even of those Scotch peers\r\nwho, not having been chosen among the sixteen representatives of the\r\npeerage of Scotland, have no right to sit in the House of Lords. There\r\nis one exception, however, to the rule that peers are ineligible to the\r\nHouse of Commons, for a peer of Ireland, who is not selected to\r\nrepresent that kingdom in the House of Lords, may sit for any county or\r\nborough in Great Britain, but not for an Irish constituency. The rule\r\nexcluding peers is sometimes a hardship on a rising young man\r\ntransferred by the death of his father from the active battlefield of\r\npolitics in the House of Commons to the dignified seclusion of the House\r\nof Lords. But it has had, on the other hand, some effect in preventing\r\nthe House of Commons from absorbing all the political life of the\r\ncountry, and has thus helped to maintain the vitality of the House of\r\nLords. Among the peers there have always been men of great national\r\nauthority who would have preferred to sit in the other House. It is safe\r\nto say that in the year 1900 two of the statesmen who possessed the\r\ngreatest influence with the people--Lord Salisbury and Lord\r\nRosebery--would have been in the House of Commons had it not been for\r\nthe rule excluding peers.\r\n\r\nThe clergy of the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England, and\r\nministers of the Church of Scotland, are disqualified by statute;[240:1]\r\nbut these provisions do not include dissenting ministers; and it may be\r\nadded that at the present day a clergyman of the Church of England may\r\nby unfrocking himself remove his disqualification.[240:2]\r\n\r\nAs in most other countries, there are in England rules disqualifying\r\npersons who, by assuming certain relations with the government, or by\r\nmisconduct, have rendered themselves unfit to serve; such are government\r\ncontractors, and holders of pensions not granted for civil or diplomatic\r\nservices; bankrupts,[240:3] and persons convicted of treason or of\r\nfelony, or guilty of corrupt practices.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Office-holders.]\r\n\r\nThe exclusion of permanent officials has already been discussed; and it\r\nwill be remembered that by the compromise effected in the reign of Queen\r\nAnne the holders of certain specified offices, or of any offices created\r\nafter Oct. 25, 1705, are absolutely disqualified; while a member\r\naccepting any other office from the Crown loses his seat, but can be\r\nreelected.[240:4] It will be remembered, also, that by later statutes or\r\nby custom all holders of civil offices not distinctly political are now\r\nexcluded from the House of Commons; and so are the judges of the higher\r\ncourts, and most of those in the lower ones.\r\n\r\nNow the offices held by ministers are either old offices within the\r\nmeaning of the Act of Anne, and therefore compatible with a seat in\r\nParliament, or new offices that have been taken out of the rule by\r\nspecial statutes passed usually when the office was created. This is\r\nnot, indeed, universally true; for by special provision of statute only\r\nfour of the five secretaries of state, and four of their\r\nunder-secretaries, can sit in the House of Commons at one time. With\r\nthat limitation every minister is capable of sitting; but on his\r\nappointment he loses his seat, and must go back to his constituents for\r\na new election. The last rule, however, like every other, has its\r\nexceptions. The under-secretaries of state occupy _old_ offices, but as\r\nthey do not accept them _from_ the Crown they are not obliged to undergo\r\na fresh election on their appointment; and they are not, in fact, in the\r\nhabit of doing so.[241:1] The same privilege has been extended by\r\nstatute to the Financial Secretary of the War Office. There is, indeed,\r\nno self-evident reason to-day why it should not be extended to all the\r\nministers. The original fear of influence on the part of the Crown no\r\nlonger applies; and the only important effect of the rule is that if a\r\nnew cabinet comes into power when Parliament is in session, all business\r\nthere has to be suspended while the ministers are seeking reelection. A\r\nnumber of attempts have been made to do away with the rule, and they\r\nhave been supported by very eminent statesmen, but they have been\r\nconstantly defeated, mainly on the ground that a constituency, having\r\nelected a man while he was in an independent position, has a right to\r\nreconsider its choice when he assumes the burden of public\r\noffice.[241:2] Such reasoning is characteristic of English political\r\nlife. It either proves nothing or it proves too much, for if it is\r\nsound, the same principle applies with quite as much force to the\r\nunder-secretaries, and with a great deal more force to the Speaker.\r\nThis objection to a change was avoided, while a part of the practical\r\ninconvenience was removed, by a provision in the Reform Act of 1867 that\r\na person who has been elected to Parliament since he became a minister\r\nshall not vacate his seat on account of accepting a different office in\r\nthe ministry.[242:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extinct Disqualifications.]\r\n\r\nFormerly there were a number of other qualifications and\r\ndisqualifications that have now been swept away, such as the requirement\r\nof ownership of land, and of residence in the constituency,[242:2] and\r\nthe provision for oaths and declarations intended mainly to exclude\r\nRoman Catholics. It is curious that after the disabilities of the Roman\r\nCatholics were removed in 1829 the oath continued to be an impediment to\r\nthe admission of Jews and atheists, although it had never been aimed at\r\nthem. In each case the law was changed, but only after the matter had\r\nbeen brought somewhat violently to the attention of the House. The last\r\nreligious impediment was taken away in 1888 at the conclusion of the\r\nunseemly wrangle with Mr. Bradlaugh.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resignation.]\r\n\r\nA disqualification not only prevents a person from sitting in the House,\r\nbut is also the only way in which he can voluntarily get out of it. A\r\nman cannot resign his seat, and hence the regular method of\r\naccomplishing the same result is the acceptance of a disqualifying\r\noffice. Two or three sinecures are retained for that purpose, the best\r\nknown being the stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds, a position which\r\nthe member desiring to leave Parliament applies for, accepts, and\r\nimmediately gives up. The place is, in fact, not an office, but an exit.\r\nIt may be added that the House has power, for reasons satisfactory to\r\nitself, to declare a seat vacant, and to expel a member.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Privileges of the House.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Freedom from Arrest.]\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to say much here about the privileges of the House of\r\nCommons. Most of them are matters of historical rather than present\r\npolitical significance. At the opening of each new Parliament, the\r\nSpeaker, after being confirmed by the Crown, demands the ancient and\r\nundoubted rights and privileges of the Commons, the most important of\r\nwhich are freedom from arrest and liberty of speech. The freedom from\r\narrest, which is enjoyed by members during the session and forty days\r\nbefore and after it, does not protect a member from the consequences of\r\nany indictable offence, or of contempt of court; nor in civil actions\r\ndoes it now prevent any process against him except arrest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Liberty of Speech.]\r\n\r\nFreedom of speech was not acquired without a long struggle; but since\r\nthe Bill of Rights of 1689 it has been a settled principle that \"the\r\nfreedom of speech, and debates or proceedings in Parliament, ought not\r\nto be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament.\"\r\nA man cannot, therefore, be prosecuted criminally, or made civilly\r\nresponsible, for anything he has said in the House; although the House\r\nitself may punish what it deems an abuse of the forms of debate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Publication of Debates.]\r\n\r\nCuriously enough the privilege of free speech in the House does not\r\nnecessarily include the right to publish that speech outside. This\r\nmatter has had an eventful history. Until about one hundred years ago\r\nthe House attempted to prevent the report of its debates in the public\r\npress, and in the course of the struggle became entangled in the\r\nmemorable controversy with Wilkes. The question has never been dealt\r\nwith by legislation, and it is still assumed that the House might\r\ndeclare the publication of its debates a breach of privilege, and put a\r\nstop to it. But the struggle came to an end because the House changed\r\nits mind. Instead of objecting to the publication of the debates it\r\ncame, in time, to desire it; and whereas it had attempted earlier to\r\nkeep out reporters, it now strove to protect them.\r\n\r\nThe privilege of free speech covered only words uttered in the House and\r\nmatter printed for circulation among the members alone. It did not\r\nextend to the printing of a speech, or to documents intended for\r\ngeneral distribution even though issued by order of the House itself;\r\nand in its later attempt to insist upon its right of publication, as in\r\nits earlier effort to insist upon its right to prevent publication, the\r\nHouse came into conflict with the judiciary. In the case of Stockdale\r\n_v_. Hansard[244:1] the Queen's Bench held that a publisher might be\r\nliable in damages to a person injured by defamatory matter contained in\r\na report made to the House of Commons, although the printing was ordered\r\nby the House itself. The question was then set at rest by a\r\nstatute[244:2] providing that publication by order of either House\r\nshould be a defence to any civil or criminal proceedings. But this has\r\nno effect upon the newspapers, and although a fair account of a debate\r\npublished in the ordinary course of reporting is not in itself\r\nlibellous, even if it contain defamatory matter, yet a faithful report\r\nof a speech published with a malicious intent is still libellous, and it\r\nis never safe to go to a jury on a question of intent.\r\n\r\nIf the attitude of the House of Commons toward the publication of its\r\ndebates has changed entirely, it is because its relation to the public\r\nhas undergone a complete transformation. Every member of Parliament\r\nto-day is seeking for the approbation of his constituents, and far from\r\ndreading publication of what he says in the House, his effort is rather\r\nto attract attention to himself by the reports in the local press of his\r\nremarks in Parliament. Moreover, the House as a whole depends more than\r\never upon popular support; and one may find a striking illustration of\r\nthe way the same thing produces different political effects under\r\ndifferent conditions by observing that while the cabinet would lose\r\nauthority if its discussions were not secret, Parliament would suffer if\r\nits debates were not public.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Privilege in the Courts of Law.]\r\n\r\nSir William Anson remarks that \"The Privileges of Parliament, like the\r\nPrerogative of the Crown, are rights conferred by Law, and as such their\r\nlimits are ascertainable and determinable, like the limits of other\r\nrights, by the Courts of Law.\"[245:1] This principle has not always\r\nbeen accepted by the House, which has on several occasions come into\r\ncollision with the courts; but the latter have always maintained, and\r\nmaintained successfully, that when a question involving a privilege of\r\nthe House comes before them for decision, it is their duty to ascertain\r\nwhether the privilege exists or not, and to determine its effect upon\r\nthe case before them. They have further maintained that they must decide\r\nthe question for themselves, and that a claim to the privilege on the\r\npart of the House is not conclusive.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the authority of the courts is incomplete; for the House\r\nhas a right to order a man committed to prison for contempt, and the\r\nquestion what constitutes a contempt is so far within the discretion of\r\nthe House that the court will not order the prisoner set at liberty on\r\n_habeas corpus_ where the return to the writ simply states that he is\r\ncommitted for contempt by order of the House. Referring to this subject,\r\nProfessor Dicey says: \"The powers exercised by the Houses, and\r\nespecially in practice by the House of Commons, make a near approach to\r\nan authority above that of the ordinary law of the land.\"[245:2] Such a\r\npower, however, is exceedingly unlikely to be used in any dissension\r\nwith the courts to-day; and if it were used, the courts would be almost\r\ncertain to win, because the commitment by the House terminates with the\r\nsession.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summons and Dissolution.]\r\n\r\nThere remain to be considered only the methods of calling Parliament\r\ntogether, and of putting an end to its labours.\r\n\r\nParliament can be summoned and dissolved, and its sessions can be opened\r\nand closed by the Crown alone, the only legal restraint upon the\r\narbitrary power of the sovereign in the matter being the Act of William\r\nand Mary, which provides that a new Parliament shall be summoned within\r\nthree years after a dissolution.[245:3] This statute is now, of course,\r\nunnecessary; and, in fact, the same proclamation which dissolves one\r\nParliament always announces the issue of writs for the election of\r\nanother. If Parliament is not dissolved by the Crown, its term expires\r\nat the end of the seven years prescribed by the Septennial Act of 1716;\r\nbut, as a matter of fact, Parliament never dies a natural death, and if\r\nits life is not cut off earlier, a dissolution takes place shortly\r\nbefore the end of the seven years.\r\n\r\nUntil 1867 the death of a sovereign always wrought a dissolution of\r\nParliament; but this rule, which depended more on ancient theory than on\r\nmodern convenience, was abolished by the Reform Act of that year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prorogation and Adjournment.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect on Unfinished Business.]\r\n\r\nWhile a session can be brought to a close only by prorogation, either\r\nhouse may adjourn for any period at its pleasure, subject only to the\r\nright of the Crown to terminate an adjournment of more than fourteen\r\ndays. Although a prorogation is made by the Crown, and adjournment by\r\nthe House itself, practically both are virtually in the hands of the\r\nministry to-day, and the really important difference between them is\r\nthat a prorogation terminates all unfinished business, while an\r\nadjournment does not. For that reason a government which has business\r\nthat it cannot put through during the regular session, and does not want\r\nto abandon, will sometimes resort to an adjournment instead of a\r\nprorogation. This was done, for example, in 1902 in order to complete\r\nthe stages of the Education Bill in the autumn, and again in 1906\r\nchiefly in order that the House of Lords might consider the pending\r\ngovernment measures. The wisdom of the rule that the close of the\r\nsession puts an end to all measures that have not finished their course\r\nin both Houses is not so clear in the case of Parliament, as in that of\r\nlegislative bodies where a vast number of measures are brought in by\r\nirresponsible members. In such bodies the rule may result in killing a\r\ngreat many bills that had better die, but in Parliament this is far less\r\ntrue. Almost all important legislation relating to public affairs is now\r\nintroduced by the ministers; and every year measures to which both they\r\nand the House have devoted much time and thought are killed by the\r\nclose of the session. A day comes when the leader of the House arises\r\nand states what bills he is obliged by lack of time to drop, a process\r\ncommonly known as the slaughter of the innocents. The necessity would\r\nseem to be unfortunate.\r\n\r\nIn fact the House of Commons spends so much time in debating each bill\r\nthat it gets through its work slowly; and whereas many other popular\r\nchambers are reproached with legislating too much, Parliament is accused\r\nof legislating too little. Moreover the House of Commons suffers less\r\nfrom an excess of the easy good nature, which, in America at least, is\r\nthe parent of many ill-considered and unwise laws; yet the present rule\r\ndoes act as a serious check upon the persistent member with a mission,\r\nand perhaps it kills off, on the whole, more bad bills than good ones.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suspending Private Bills.]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a class of measures on which the rule, if carried out\r\nstrictly, would have a distinctly injurious effect. These are the\r\nprivate bills--a term applied to projects which relate to private or\r\nlocal interests, such as bills for the extension of a railway, or for\r\nauthority to supply water, gas, tramways and the like. Legislation of\r\nthat kind is, as we shall see, conducted in Parliament by a\r\nsemi-judicial process, and as it is highly expensive for both sides, it\r\nwould be unreasonable that the closing of the session, for reasons quite\r\nunconnected with these matters, should oblige the promoters and\r\nobjectors to incur the cost of beginning proceedings all over again. In\r\npractice this seldom happens, for in the few cases where such a bill\r\ncannot be completed before the end of the session it is usually\r\nsuspended by a special order providing that the stages it has already\r\npassed shall be formally taken at the opening of the next session, so\r\nthat the bill really begins its progress again at the point it had\r\nalready reached. When, as in 1895, Parliament comes to an untimely end\r\nin the midst of a session, a general provision of this kind is made\r\nsuspending all unfinished private bills, and thus a great deal of\r\nunnecessary hardship is avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[239:1] In a couple of instances natives of India have been elected.\r\n\r\n[240:1] The question was raised in 1801 in the famous case of Horne\r\nTooke, and set at rest for the future by an Act of that year: 41 Geo.\r\nIII., c. 63.

Apart from occasional meetings at other places during the Middle\r\nAges, the Mother of Parliaments has sat close to this spot for more than\r\nsix hundred years. Except for old Westminster Hall, almost the whole of\r\nthe present structure was, indeed, built after the fire of 1834. Yet if\r\nit contains little that is really venerable, save memories, the smoke of\r\nLondon has given to the gothic panelling of the outer walls the dignity\r\nof apparent age. The interior has a more modern air, for it is not only\r\nwell planned with a view to its present use, but in some parts it\r\nexpresses with peculiar fitness the purposes it serves. From opposite\r\nsides of the large central lobby corridors lead to the two Houses, but\r\nthe hall of the Lords seems designed for ornament, that of the Commons\r\nfor doing work. The House of Commons is seventy-five feet long by\r\nforty-five feet wide and forty-one feet high, panelled in dark oak, and\r\nlit by long stained glass windows and sky-lights in the ceiling. From\r\nthe main entrance a broad aisle runs the whole length of the chamber,\r\nwith the clerks' table filling nearly the whole upper end of it, and\r\nbeyond this a raised chair for the Speaker with a canopy over his head.\r\nFacing the aisle on each side long rows of high-backed benches, covered\r\nwith dark green leather, slope upward tier above tier to the walls of\r\nthe room; and through them, at right angles to the aisle, a narrow\r\npassage, known as the gangway, cuts across the House. There is also a\r\ngallery running all around the room, the part of it facing the Speaker\r\nbeing given up to strangers, while the front rows at the opposite end\r\nbelong to the reporters, and behind them there stands, before a still\r\nhigher gallery, a heavy screen, like those erected in Turkish mosques to\r\nconceal the presence of women, and used here for the same purpose. The\r\nstructure and arrangement of a legislative chamber are not without\r\ninfluence upon the mode of transacting business. The whole number of\r\nseats in the House of Commons is far from large, not large enough for\r\nall the members. The two side galleries are reserved for them, but they\r\nare very narrow, containing only a little more than one hundred seats\r\napiece, and although they are occupied on very crowded nights, they are\r\npractically useless for any one who intends to take part in debate. A\r\nsmall portion of the space under the strangers' gallery is also\r\nappropriated for visitors, and the rest of the floor contains only three\r\nhundred and sixty seats, enough for little more than one half of the six\r\nhundred and seventy members of the House. During the greater part of the\r\ntime even those seats are not filled, for they are adapted only for the\r\ntransaction of the business of the House. They are merely benches with\r\nno means for writing. If a member wants to carry on his correspondence,\r\nhe goes to the library, or to one of the other rooms near by. In the\r\nHouse he can only speak, listen, and applaud.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attendance Often Small.]\r\n\r\nOn a great occasion, like the introduction by Mr. Gladstone of his first\r\nHome Rule Bill, every seat in the House is taken. At the opening of an\r\nordinary sitting, also, while questions to the ministers are asked and\r\nanswered, and at a time when the leaders of the two great parties are\r\nspeaking about a measure of general interest, most of the seats on the\r\nfloor are occupied; but as soon as the lesser lights arise the members\r\nbegin to drop off, going to the lobby, the library, the smoking-room,\r\nthe dining-room, or the terrace. Nor is it always the lesser lights\r\nalone that speak to nearly empty benches, or rather to the reporters'\r\ngallery. The writer well remembers, on the first occasion when he saw\r\nthe House, now more than twenty years ago, that Sir William Harcourt,\r\nthen Home Secretary, made a speech an hour and three quarters long upon\r\na bill which he had brought in to reform the government of London, and\r\nthat, during a great part of the time, the only persons present besides\r\nthe officers of the House, were the Lord Mayor, the Chairman of the\r\nMetropolitan Board of Works, and a casual who sat on one of the upper\r\nbenches behind the minister. This is the smallest number of members the\r\nwriter has ever beheld in the House, but to see only a score or two on\r\nthe benches is by no means unusual. Many more, however, although not\r\nwithin ear-shot, are potentially present. Forty members constitute a\r\nquorum, but if any one suggests that they are not there, electric bells\r\nare rung all over the building, summoning the members into the House, a\r\ntwo-minute sand-glass is turned, and the members are not counted until\r\nit has run out. The same process takes place whenever a division--that\r\nis a vote by count--is challenged.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of This on Debates.]\r\n\r\nThe small size of the chamber makes it easy to hear an ordinary tone of\r\nvoice; and this, coupled with the still smaller attendance, discourages\r\nflights of oratory or popular eloquence, and gives to the debates a\r\nbusinesslike and almost conversational character. Moreover, the very\r\nfact that members do not stay in the House if not interested in what is\r\nbeing said, prevents the distracting hum of conversation which is\r\nsometimes annoying in other representative bodies. All this makes the\r\nspectator feel that the members are present for public business and\r\nnothing else. Except for occasional scenes enacted for the most part by\r\nthe Irish members, the proceedings are orderly, and respect for the\r\ndignity of the House, and the authority of the chair, are almost\r\nuniversal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Arrangement of Seats.]\r\n\r\nEven the arrangement of seats in the House is not without its bearing\r\nupon political life; and although a small matter, it affords another\r\nillustration of the principle that an institution which, instead of\r\nbeing deliberately planned, is evolved slowly, will develop in harmony\r\nwith its environment, or force its environment into harmony with itself.\r\nThe front bench at the upper end of the aisle, close at the right hand\r\nof the Speaker, is called the Treasury Bench, and is reserved for the\r\nministers; the corresponding bench on the other side being occupied by\r\nthe former ministers of the party now in Opposition. Behind these two\r\nbenches sit for the most part men whose fidelity to their respective\r\nparties is undoubted, members whose allegiance is less absolute\r\ngenerally preferring seats below the gangway on either side.\r\n\r\nOf course, on a crowded night members cannot always find seats that\r\nexpress their exact sentiments. Still, the arrangement is fairly well\r\npreserved, especially in the case of prominent men, with whom it is\r\nsometimes a matter of no little consideration.[251:1] Any group that\r\ndesires to emphasise its freedom from regular party control always sits\r\nbelow the gangway. The Fourth Party, for example, sat in 1884 below the\r\ngangway on the Opposition side, the Labour Party has sat there since the\r\nelection of 1906, and the same position is occupied by the Irish\r\nNationalists under every ministry; while the Liberal Unionists at the\r\ntime of their breach with Mr. Gladstone over his first Home Rule Bill\r\ntook up their seats below the gangway on the government side. The House\r\nat a great debate resembles a martial array, with the leaders face to\r\nface in the van, supported by their troops in ranks behind them. The\r\nminister leans over the table, and points in indignation or in scorn at\r\nthe \"honourable gentlemen opposite.\" All this expresses the idea of\r\nparty government, and lends a dramatic effect to parliamentary warfare.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mode of Treating the Subject of Procedure.]\r\n\r\nNowhere in the whole range of British institutions does the interaction\r\nof law and custom baffle any attempt at logical description so much as\r\nin the case of procedure in Parliament. The cabinet, which is becoming\r\nmore and more exclusively the motive force in all important legislative\r\naction, is not, indeed, so completely unknown to the rules of the House\r\nas it is to the statute-book; and yet a study of the rules alone would\r\ngive but a faint idea of the authority of the Treasury Bench. On the\r\nother hand, it is impossible to understand how the government is\r\nattacked, and how it carries through its plans, unless one is familiar\r\nwith the rules themselves. At the present day the discussions connected\r\nwith appropriations, for example, turn little on financial questions,\r\nand are used mainly as an opportunity for criticising administrative\r\nconduct; but to understand how this is done, and to what extent the\r\ngovernment has sought to limit the practice, a knowledge of the process\r\nof granting supply is essential.\r\n\r\nThe actual working of the House of Commons involves three problems:\r\nfirst, the regular forms of procedure; second, the action of the cabinet\r\nand of private members, operating subject to those forms; and third, the\r\nmethods by which the cabinet maintains a control over its own\r\nsupporters, and through them over the House itself. To deal with these\r\nthree matters together would involve so much confusion, that it has\r\nseemed better to take up one of them at a time. This chapter and the two\r\nsucceeding ones are, therefore, devoted solely to the organisation of\r\nthe House and the forms of procedure on public matters, the relation of\r\nthe government to the work of the House being described in the chapters\r\nthat follow, while the machinery for keeping the majority compact and\r\nunder the lead of the Treasury Bench will be dealt with at a later stage\r\nunder the head of \"Party Organisation in Parliament.\" Legislation for\r\nprivate and local objects, which has had a peculiar and instructive\r\ndevelopment, is treated in a chapter by itself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Method of Voting.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A division.]\r\n\r\nBefore describing the organisation and procedure of the House it may be\r\nwell to explain the method of voting, because frequent reference must be\r\nmade to it, and the terms are technical. After stating the question to\r\nbe voted upon, the Speaker, or the Chairman, calls in the ordinary way\r\nfor the ayes and noes. According to the apparent preponderance of voices\r\nhe then says, \"I think the ayes (or noes) have it.\" If no objection is\r\nraised, he adds a moment later, \"The ayes (or noes) have it,\" and the\r\nvote is so recorded. If, on the other hand, any of the minority doubt\r\nthe result, or wish the numbers and names recorded, they cry out\r\ncontrary to the Speaker, \"The noes (or ayes) have it.\" Whereupon the\r\nSpeaker directs strangers to withdraw (except from the places reserved\r\nfor them), the division bells are rung all over the building, the\r\ntwo-minute sand-glass is turned, and when it has run the doors are\r\nlocked, and the question and vote are repeated in the same way.[253:1]\r\nIf the Speaker's opinion of the result is again challenged--and this is\r\nalmost always done--he orders a division of the House, that is, he\r\ndirects the ayes to go to the right, the noes to the left; and he\r\nappoints two tellers from each side, one of each pair to count the ayes,\r\nand the other the noes, in order to check one another. The ayes then go\r\ninto the lobby that runs parallel to the House on the Speaker's right,\r\nthe noes into that on his left; and until 1906 every member in the\r\nHouse, except the Speaker, was obliged to go into one lobby or the\r\nother, unless he was physically disabled, when his vote might be counted\r\nin the House.[253:2] The tellers, standing at the door of each lobby,\r\ncount the members as they pass between them in returning to the House,\r\nwhile clerks at tables in the lobbies take down their names.\r\n\r\nEver since 1836, when the method of taking a division assumed its\r\npresent form, the names of members voting on each side have been printed\r\nand preserved, although curiously enough these division lists are not\r\nincluded among the parliamentary papers. The process may seem a clumsy\r\nway of counting votes, but under the system in force until 1906 it took,\r\non the average, only twenty minutes, and under the new system, whereby\r\nthe recording of names begins when the sand-glass is turned, it takes\r\nnot much more than half as long. This is less time than would be\r\nconsumed by a roll-call, and the system has been found so satisfactory\r\nthat it was adopted by the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nUntil recently a division was the only means, apart from an oral vote,\r\nof taking the sense of the House; and any one member could force a\r\ndivision by challenging the result of an oral vote, or rather any two\r\nmembers could do so, for a division cannot take place unless two tellers\r\ncan be found for each side. In 1888, however, as a part of the movement\r\nto prevent obstruction and waste of time, the Speaker or Chairman was\r\nempowered, if he thinks a division frivolously or vexatiously claimed,\r\nto call upon the ayes and noes to rise in their places. He can then\r\ncount them, and declare the result;[254:1] but this is in fact rarely\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nThe names of the men selected as tellers indicate the political nature\r\nof the vote. If the government intend to treat the question, I will not\r\nsay as one of confidence, (for there are cases of secondary importance\r\nwhere a ministry may be beaten without feeling that they have lost the\r\nconfidence of the House and must resign), but if they intend to treat it\r\nas one where an adverse vote is a defeat for them, if they desire to\r\nrally their followers to vote solidly upon it, then the government whips\r\nare appointed tellers. If in the same way the Opposition want to treat\r\nit as a party question, their whips are appointed tellers upon the\r\nother side. But if on one side or the other this is not the case,\r\nprivate members who have made or seconded the motion or taken an active\r\npart in debate are selected by the chair as tellers, and if so any\r\nmember may, without disloyalty to his party, vote according to his own\r\nunaided convictions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Standing and Sessional Orders.]\r\n\r\nLike other legislative bodies the House of Commons has printed rules,\r\nand the most important of these, the standing orders, are published\r\nevery year among the parliamentary papers. But the standing orders are\r\nby no means a code of procedure, for they cover only a fraction, and so\r\nfar as they relate to public business a small fraction, of the\r\nsubject.[255:1] The procedure rests essentially upon custom, to be\r\ngathered in part from precedents and the rulings of Speakers, in part\r\nfrom unrecorded tradition known by personal experience. Many standing\r\norders have, in fact, been adopted from time to time in order to modify\r\nor forbid an existing practice, and hence their effect is mainly\r\nnegative. No particular formality is required for the adoption of these\r\nrules, but in 1902, when extensive changes were made, the proposals were\r\nread several times, and were, in fact, submitted to a procedure similar\r\nto that for the enactment of a bill.[255:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Standing Orders Endure from One Parliament to Another.]\r\n\r\nThe standing orders differ from the rules of legislative bodies in some\r\nother countries in two important respects. In the first place they do\r\nnot have to be adopted afresh by each new House of Commons, but once\r\nestablished they continue in force from Parliament to Parliament until\r\nrepealed. There are, indeed, sessional orders which require to be\r\nrenewed at the beginning of each session, and sometimes a new rule after\r\nproving its utility in this way is given the permanent form of a\r\nstanding order. Orders or resolutions without any fixed duration are\r\nalso adopted at times. These expire upon prorogation, but it sometimes\r\nhappens that without being formally revived they continue to be observed\r\nas a part of customary practice of the House.[256:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: They Can be Suspended by a Simple Vote.]\r\n\r\nThe second peculiarity of the standing orders lies in the fact that they\r\ncan be suspended by a simple majority vote. Notice of a motion for that\r\npurpose is usually required and given, but it may be dispensed with; and\r\nit is not even necessary to refer in the motion to the standing orders\r\nat all. Any order or resolution, inconsistent with their terms, has, if\r\nadopted, the effect of suspending them,[256:2] and the House is, in\r\nfact, constantly adopting special orders which change the course of\r\nprocedure as prescribed by the standing orders or the customary\r\npractice. This has often been done when the government has needed to\r\ntake, for its own measures, part of the time allotted to private\r\nmembers, or has wanted to extend the sitting beyond the usual hour. Many\r\nof these cases are now provided for by the new rules adopted in 1902;\r\nbut the most effective form of cutting short debate, the process known\r\nas the \"guillotine,\" although now regulated by standing order in the\r\ncase of supply,[256:3] is still applied in the case of all other bills\r\nsolely by a special order of the House adopted for a particular bill on\r\nthe motion of a minister.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tendency of Changes in the Standing Orders.]\r\n\r\nMost of the changes in the standing orders made during the last fifty\r\nyears have been aimed at preserving order, or preventing waste of time,\r\nor altering the distribution of time.[256:4] Those of the first class,\r\nsuch as the provisions authorising the suspension of a member for\r\ndisorder, arose from the conduct of the Irish members, and may be\r\nregarded as an accident unconnected with the normal evolution of the\r\nparliamentary system. This is not true of the rules designed to prevent\r\nwaste of time; for although the provisions to cut off debate grew out of\r\nIrish obstruction, the subsequent history of closure has shown that some\r\nprocess of this kind was certain to come sooner or later in the natural\r\ncourse of things, and that the Irish merely hastened it.[257:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Efforts to Save Time.]\r\n\r\nThe changes made in order to save time are commonly attributed to the\r\nincrease in the amount of business the House is called upon to despatch,\r\nand if in that business be included the enlarged control of the House\r\nover administrative detail by means of questions and otherwise, this is\r\nundoubtedly true, but so far as legislation is concerned, it would be\r\nmore accurate to attribute the changes to the fact that it requires more\r\ntime to transact business than it did formerly. There are a far larger\r\nnumber of members who want to interrogate and criticise the ministers,\r\nand to take part in debate. The pages of Hansard are more numerous in\r\nproportion to those of the statute-book. Now the old procedure was very\r\nelaborate. In the passage of an ordinary public bill through the House\r\nthere were, apart from amendments, more than a score of different steps,\r\nupon each of which debate might take place, and a division might be\r\nclaimed. Then motions to adjourn, and other dilatory tactics could be\r\nused indefinitely. Moreover, the general rule that amendments and\r\ndebate must be relevant to the question before the House[258:1] was\r\nsubject to wide exceptions, if, indeed, there could be said to be any\r\nsuch general rule at all. The debate upon a dilatory motion, for\r\nexample, was not limited to the motion itself;[258:2] and every time a\r\nmotion was made to go into Committee of the Whole on Supply, any\r\ngrievance could be brought forward and discussed.[258:3]\r\n\r\nAll this was unimportant so long as the battles between the parties were\r\nconfined to occasional full-dress debates, and the rest of the time was\r\ndevoted to the real work of legislation. But when systematic obstruction\r\narose, and when without any intent to obstruct it became the recognised\r\nbusiness of the Opposition to oppose, and in the case of measures that\r\naroused strong party feeling to oppose at every step, the opportunities\r\nfor doing so were too numerous to endure. Some of the steps in the\r\nenactment of a bill, such as engrossment,[258:4] passage,[258:5] and\r\nfirst and second reading in the Committee of the Whole,[258:6] have been\r\ndiscontinued altogether. Others, such as taking up the consideration of\r\na bill,[258:7] or going into Committee of the Whole on a bill,[258:8] or\r\nbringing up a report from Committee of the Whole,[258:9] are taken as a\r\nmatter of course without question put. In other cases again the question\r\nis put, but no debate is allowed.[258:10] With the same object debate\r\nupon a dilatory motion has been limited to the subject-matter of the\r\nmotion, and the Speaker or Chairman has been empowered to forbid debate\r\nupon it, or even to refuse to put the question at all, if he considers\r\nthe motion an abuse of the rules of the House.[258:11]\r\n\r\nThe opportunities for criticising the government both in going into\r\nCommittee of Supply, and by other means, have also been limited in\r\nvarious ways, and above all the system of cutting short debate by means\r\nof closure has been brought of late years to a condition of great\r\nefficiency. These matters, and the distribution of time between the\r\ngovernment and private members will be considered more fully hereafter,\r\nand it is only necessary to remark now that the tendencies noted are\r\npermanent, because although a party while in Opposition may object to\r\nchanges in the rules that enhance the control of the government over the\r\nconduct and time of the House, it finds itself compelled to maintain\r\nthem when it comes into office. The tendencies are, in fact, the natural\r\nresult of the more and more exclusive responsibility of the ministry for\r\nall public action, legislative as well as executive.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Speaker.]\r\n\r\nThe Commons are always summoned to the bar in the House of Lords to hear\r\nany formal communication from the Crown, and when after a general\r\nelection they meet on the day appointed, they are summoned there to hear\r\nthe formal opening of the new Parliament. They are then desired in the\r\nname of the sovereign to choose a Speaker, and retire to their chamber\r\nfor the purpose. As soon as he has been chosen, the mace is placed on\r\nthe table before him, as a symbol of his authority and a token that the\r\nCommons are sitting as a House. But he is still only Speaker-elect,\r\nuntil the next day, when, followed by the Commons, he again presents\r\nhimself at the bar of the Lords, announces his election, and asks for\r\nthe royal confirmation, which is now, of course, never refused.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Election.]\r\n\r\nIf only one person is nominated for Speaker, he is called to the chair\r\nwithout a vote. If more than one, they are voted upon successively, a\r\nmajority being required for election.[259:1] The proposer and seconder\r\nare always private members, for it is considered more fitting that the\r\nministers should not be prominent in the matter.[259:2] The Speaker is,\r\nhowever, always selected by the government of the day, and a new Speaker\r\nis always taken from the ranks of the party in power. Sometimes the\r\nelection is not uncontested, and this happened when Mr. Gully was chosen\r\nin 1895. But although the Speaker may have been opposed when first\r\nchosen, and although he is elected only for the duration of the\r\nParliament, it has now become the invariable habit to reelect him so\r\nlong as he is willing to serve. The last cases where a Speaker's\r\nreelection was opposed occurred in 1833 and 1835, and on the second of\r\nthose occasions he was defeated. The principle is well illustrated by\r\nthe career of Mr. Gully. He was elected by a small majority, during the\r\nlast few months of a moribund Liberal cabinet. His selection had not\r\npleased the Conservatives, and he was warned that they held themselves\r\nat liberty not to reelect him if they came to power in the next\r\nParliament. Contrary to the ordinary rule his constituency was contested\r\nat the next general election, but although the Conservatives obtained a\r\nlarge majority in the new Parliament, he was returned to the chair\r\nwithout opposition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Powers over Debate.]\r\n\r\nThe Speaker is purely a presiding officer. He has nothing to do with\r\nappointing any committees, or guiding the House in its work. He is not a\r\nleader but an umpire, otherwise he could not remain in the chair through\r\nchanges of party. As an umpire, however, his powers are very great, and\r\nin some cases under the modern changes in the standing orders they are\r\nautocratic. He decides, for example, whether a motion to closure debate\r\nmay be put, or whether it is an infringement of the rights of the\r\nminority;[260:1] he can refuse to entertain a dilatory motion if he\r\nconsiders it an abuse of the rules of the House;[260:2] and he can stop\r\nthe speech of a member who \"persists in irrelevance, or tedious\r\nrepetition.\"[260:3] Moreover, from his decision on those matters, or on\r\nany points of order, there is no appeal.[260:4] The House can suspend or\r\nchange its own rules by a simple majority vote, but it cannot in a\r\nconcrete case override the Speaker's construction of them.[260:5] This\r\nis a general principle of English parliamentary law, which is applied\r\nin almost all public bodies.[261:1] It may render a conscientious man\r\nmore careful in his rulings, but it certainly places in his hands\r\nenormous power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Power to Preserve Order.]\r\n\r\nFamiliarity with representative bodies seems to breed contempt, for the\r\nlast half century has been marked by an increase of disorderly scenes in\r\nthe legislatures of many countries. In England such things were brought\r\nabout by the growth of the Irish Home Rule party, which regarded the\r\ngovernment of Ireland by the British Parliament as unjust on principle,\r\nand oppressive in fact; and which, to say the least, was not distressed\r\nby loss of dignity on the part of the House of Commons. In 1880 the\r\nSpeaker was given the power to repress disorder, now embodied, with\r\nsubsequent modifications, in Standing Order 18. He can name a member who\r\ndisregards his authority or obstructs business, and then a motion is in\r\norder, to be decided at once without amendment or debate, to suspend\r\nthat member.[261:2] When the standing orders were revised in 1902 they\r\ncontained a clause prescribing the duration of the suspension for the\r\nfirst and subsequent offences, but this was struck out during the\r\ndiscussion, and a suspension is now indeterminate. It is obvious that to\r\na party, in a hopeless minority, which denies the authority of\r\nParliament, a disorderly scene followed by a suspension, and an\r\nopportunity to go home and make stirring speeches, may not be an\r\nundesirable form of protest.\r\n\r\nApart from occasional outbursts chiefly, though not exclusively, on the\r\npart of the Irish members, a stranger in the gallery is much impressed\r\nby the respect paid to the Speaker, and by his moral control over the\r\nHouse.[262:1] His emoluments are in proportion to the dignity of his\r\nposition. He enjoys a salary of five thousand pounds a year, with an\r\nofficial residence in the Houses of Parliament and other perquisites;\r\nand although standing aloof from political leadership, he is regarded as\r\nthe first commoner of the realm. He is, indeed, on the threshold of the\r\nHouse of Lords, for it has been the habit of late years to make him a\r\npeer when he retires.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He Votes Only in Case of a Tie.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Chairman of Committees.]\r\n\r\nAs late as 1870 the Speaker occasionally took part in debate, when the\r\nHouse was in Committee of the Whole where he does not preside;[262:2]\r\nbut it would now be thought inconsistent with his position of absolute\r\nimpartiality to speak or vote in committee. He therefore never votes\r\nunless he is obliged to do so by a tie occurring when he is in the\r\nchair. It is commonly said that he always gives his casting vote in such\r\ncases so as to keep the question open; but this is not strictly true.\r\nWhen, however, his vote involves a final decision, he bases it, not upon\r\nhis personal opinion of the merits of the measure, but upon the probable\r\nintention of the House as shown by its previous action, or upon some\r\ngeneral constitutional principle;[262:3] and it may be added that the\r\nchairman of a Committee of the Whole, when called upon to break a tie,\r\nfollows the same practice.[262:4] The chair in Committee of the Whole is\r\nregularly taken by the Chairman of the Committee of Ways and\r\nMeans--commonly called for that reason the Chairman of Committees--who,\r\nlike the Speaker, withdraws, on his appointment, from political\r\ncontests, speaking and voting in the House nowadays only on questions\r\nrelating to private bills. He is nominated at the beginning of the\r\nParliament by the ministry, from among their prominent supporters, and\r\nretires from the position when they resign. Considering that his duties\r\nconsist in presiding, like the Speaker, with strict impartiality, and in\r\na purely non-partisan supervision of private bill legislation, it is\r\nsomewhat strange that he should go in and out of office with the\r\ncabinet, but in fact one hears no criticism of his conduct on that\r\nscore, largely, no doubt, because he always takes the Speaker as his\r\nmodel. Since 1855 he has acted as deputy speaker, when the Speaker is\r\nunavoidably absent,[263:1] and in order to prevent any possible\r\ninconvenience from the absence of both of these officers from the House,\r\nor of the Chairman of Ways and Means from the Committee of the Whole,\r\nprovision was made in 1902 for the election of a deputy chairman who can\r\nfill the vacant place.[263:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other Officers of the House.]\r\n\r\nThe only other officers of the House that need be mentioned here are the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms, who acts as the executive officer and chief of police\r\nof the House under the direction of the Speaker; the Clerk of the House;\r\nand the Counsel to Mr. Speaker, who is a legal adviser, and has\r\nimportant duties in connection with private bill legislation. It is a\r\ncurious survival that the Sergeant-at-Arms,[263:3] and the Clerk of the\r\nHouse with his chief assistants,[263:4] are appointed by the Crown, and\r\nhold office permanently. Their work is, of course, of a non-partisan\r\ncharacter, and they do not always belong to the party of the ministry\r\nthat appoints them. Sir Courtenay Ilbert, for example, the present Clerk\r\nof the House, although a Liberal, was appointed by the Conservative\r\ngovernment, and not by way of promotion in the service of the House, for\r\nhe was at the time Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[251:1] The question where the Peelites should sit in 1852 was much\r\ndiscussed among themselves.

Under the\r\nnew rule adopted in 1906 the Speaker orders the lobby to be cleared, and\r\nthe members begin to pass through it at once.\r\n\r\n[253:2] To refuse to do so has been treated as such a disregard of the\r\nauthority of the chair as will justify suspending the member. May,\r\n\"Parl. Practice,\" 10 Ed., 338.\r\n\r\nOn March 5, 1901, twelve Irish Nationalists, who refused to go into the\r\nlobby because they had had no chance to speak when the closure was moved\r\non a vote on account, were suspended; Hans. 4 Ser. XC., 692-96; and on\r\nAug. 5, 1904, the Welsh members refused to vote as a protest against the\r\nuse of closure on the Education (Local Authorities Defaults) Bill. After\r\nthey had persisted so far that the Chairman reported the matter to the\r\nHouse, they consented to withdraw altogether, and no further steps were\r\ntaken against them. Hans. 4 Ser. CXXXIX., 1259-68.\r\n\r\n[254:1] S.O. 30.\r\n\r\n[255:1] The standing orders relating to private business are much more\r\nelaborate and come far nearer to a code of procedure.\r\n\r\n[255:2] This had not been the practice earlier; but the discussion of\r\nchanges in the standing orders has sometimes been very long. In 1882 the\r\nnew rules, which dealt with closure, the suspension of disorderly\r\nmembers and the creation of standing committees, were debated for\r\nthirty-three days. On the other hand, a change was made in 1901 on the\r\nmotion of a private member, at a single sitting. Hans. 4 Ser. XCII.,\r\n555-75. In 1906 the changes were referred to a select committee and then\r\neach of them adopted on a motion by the government. Hans. 4 Ser. CLV.,\r\n197 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[256:1] May, 145.\r\n\r\n[256:2] _Ibid._, 145.\r\n\r\n[256:3] S.O. 15.\r\n\r\n[256:4] In his excellent _Recht und Technik des Englischen\r\nParlamentarismus_--the only systematic history of procedure in the House\r\nof Commons--Dr. Redlich dwells on two tendencies in the evolution of the\r\nstanding orders since 1832. One of these consists in giving to the\r\nministry an ever greater control over the time, and hence over the\r\nactivity, of the House; the other in keeping the House more and more\r\nstrictly to its prearranged order of business for the day. Now the\r\nmanifestations of this last tendency, which he makes very clear, can\r\nalso be classed as changes made to save time or to arrange the\r\ndistribution of time. Whether in the form of forbidding motions to vary\r\nthe prescribed order of business, or to confine amendments and debate to\r\nmatters relevant to the main question, or to exclude dilatory motions\r\nand others that open an indefinite field for discussion, they have the\r\neffect either of preventing waste of time by debating trivial questions\r\nor matters that the House does not care to take up, or of preventing the\r\nuse for some other purpose of time allotted to the government or to a\r\nprivate member.\r\n\r\nSince this was written Dr. Redlich's book has happily been translated\r\ninto English, but as the English edition has not yet been received the\r\nreferences to the German edition are left unchanged.\r\n\r\n[257:1] This is also Dr. Redlich's opinion, _Recht und Technik_, 246.\r\n\r\n[258:1] May, 299.\r\n\r\n[258:2] _Ibid._, 301.\r\n\r\n[258:3] _Ibid._, 571.\r\n\r\n[258:4] _Ibid._, 471.\r\n\r\n[258:5] _Ibid._, 472-3.\r\n\r\n[258:6] S.O. 36.\r\n\r\n[258:7] S.O. 40.\r\n\r\n[258:8] S.O. 32, 51.\r\n\r\n[258:9] S.O. 53.\r\n\r\n[258:10] _E.g._ S.O. 1 (7), 18, 26, 31, 91.\r\n\r\n[258:11] S.O. 22, 23.\r\n\r\n[259:1] May, 151.\r\n\r\n[259:2] _Cf. ibid._, 150, note 3.\r\n\r\n[260:1] S.O. 26.\r\n\r\n[260:2] S.O. 23.\r\n\r\n[260:3] S.O. 19.\r\n\r\n[260:4] But the Speaker himself may submit a question to the judgment of\r\nthe House.

CCLVIII., 10, 14. On the occasion when\r\nSpeaker Brand made this ruling he intimated that a member making on the\r\nspot a motion to disagree with it would be guilty of disregarding the\r\nauthority of the chair, and liable to suspension under the standing\r\norders. _Ibid._, 9.\r\n\r\n[261:1] The Lord Chancellor has far less power as presiding officer of\r\nthe House of Lords.

If a member who is suspended refuses to leave the\r\nHouse, the Speaker may, on his own authority, suspend him for the\r\nremainder of the session. _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[262:1] In 1902 the provision, common in continental legislatures, which\r\nauthorises the Speaker to suspend the sitting, in case of grave\r\ndisorder, was embodied in S.O. 21. This has been used only once, on May\r\n22, 1905, when the Opposition, thinking it was the duty of the Prime\r\nMinister to give an immediate explanation, refused with great disorder\r\nto hear another member of the government. (Hans. 4 Ser. CXLVI.,\r\n1061-72.)

It has neither the time, the patience nor the knowledge\r\nrequired. Its sittings ought not to be frittered away in discussing\r\nproposals that have no chance of success; while measures that are to be\r\nbrought before the whole body ought to be threshed out beforehand, their\r\nprovisions carefully weighed and put into precise language, objections,\r\nif possible, met by concession and compromise, or brought to a sharp\r\ndifference of principle. In short, they ought to be put into such a\r\nshape that the assembly is only called upon to decide a small number of\r\nperfectly definite questions. To enable it to do so intelligently it may\r\nbe necessary also to collect information about doubtful facts. Modern\r\nassemblies have sought to accomplish these results mainly by committees\r\nof some kind; and in England where the parliamentary form of government\r\nhas reached a higher development than anywhere else, the chief\r\ninstrument for the purpose is that informal joint committee of the\r\nHouses, known as the cabinet. But unless Parliament were to be very\r\nnearly reduced to the role of criticising the ministers, and answering\r\nyes or no to a series of questions propounded by them, it must do a part\r\nof its work through other committees. The reasons why those committees\r\nhave not become--as in some other European nations that have adopted the\r\nsystem of a responsible ministry--dangerous rivals of the cabinet, at\r\ntimes frustrating its objects and undermining its authority, will be\r\ndiscussed in the chapters on the relation between the cabinet and the\r\nHouse of Commons. We must consider here their organisation and duties.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Committee of the Whole.]\r\n\r\nThe most important committee, the Committee of the Whole, is not in this\r\nsense a committee at all. It is simply the House itself acting under\r\nspecial forms of procedure; the chief differences being that the\r\nChairman of Committees presides, and that the rule of the House\r\nforbidding a member to speak more than once on the same question does\r\nnot apply. But the fact that a member can speak more than once makes it\r\na real convenience for the purpose for which it is chiefly used, that\r\nis, the consideration of measures in detail, such as the discussion and\r\namendment of the separate clauses of a bill, or the debates upon\r\ndifferent items of appropriations. The Committee of the Whole has had a\r\nlong history.[265:1] It is called by different names according to the\r\nsubject-matter with which it deals. For ordinary bills it is called\r\nsimply the Committee of the Whole. When engaged upon appropriations it\r\nis called Committee of the Whole on Supply, or in common parlance the\r\nCommittee of Supply. When providing money to meet the appropriations it\r\nis called the Committee of Ways and Means; and when reviewing the\r\nrevenue accounts of India it is named from that subject. The committees\r\nof the whole called by these names are so far distinct that each of them\r\ncan deal only with its own affairs, and the House must go into committee\r\nagain in order to take up any other matter. But the simple Committee of\r\nthe Whole can take up one bill after another which has been referred to\r\nit without reporting to the House and being reconstituted.[265:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Select Committees.]\r\n\r\nOf the real committees the most numerous are the select committees.\r\nTheir normal size is fifteen members, although they are often smaller,\r\nand occasionally, by special leave of the House,[265:3] they are\r\nsomewhat larger. They may be nominated from the floor, and elected by\r\nthe House,[265:4] or chosen by ballot; but in order to avoid loss of\r\ntime, and to secure impartiality, the appointment of a part, at least,\r\nof the members is usually intrusted to the Committee of Selection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Committee of Selection.]\r\n\r\nSome of the select committees are appointed regularly every year, and\r\nare therefore known as sessional committees. One of these, the Committee\r\nof Selection, has already been mentioned. It has been enlarged from time\r\nto time, and now consists of eleven members, chosen by the House itself\r\nat the beginning of the session.[266:1] The members are, in fact,\r\ndesignated by an understanding between the leaders of the two great\r\nparties in the House. But the object is to create an impartial body, and\r\nso far is this object attained that in the memoir of Sir John Mowbray,\r\nwho was its chairman continuously for thirty-two years, we are told that\r\ndivisions in the committee are rare, and never on party lines.[266:2]\r\nIts duties, so far as public business is concerned, consist in\r\nappointing members of select and standing committees. It appoints also\r\nthe committees on all private and local bills, and divides those bills\r\namong them.[266:3] This is, indeed, the primary object of its existence,\r\nbut, together with a description of the various committees employed in\r\nprivate bill legislation, it must be postponed to a later chapter. It\r\nmay, however, save confusion in the mind of a reader unfamiliar with\r\nparliamentary practice to insist here upon the distinction between a\r\nprivate member's bill and a private bill. The former is a bill of a\r\npublic nature introduced by a private member, whereas a private bill is\r\none dealing only with a matter of private, personal, or local interest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other Sessional Committees.]\r\n\r\nThe remaining sessional committees are the Committee on Public\r\nAccounts,[266:4] which goes through the report of the Auditor and\r\nComptroller General, considers in detail objections to the legality of\r\nany expenditures by the public departments, examines witnesses thereon,\r\nand reports to the House; the Committee on Public Petitions, appointed\r\nto inspect the numerous petitions presented to the House;[266:5] and\r\nthe Committee on the Kitchen and Refreshment Rooms, which has\r\nimportance for the members of the House, though not for the general\r\npublic.[267:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other Select Committees.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Object.]\r\n\r\nThe other select committees are created to consider some special matter\r\nthat is referred to them, either a bill, or a subject upon which the\r\nHouse wishes to institute an inquiry.[267:2] In either case the chief\r\nobject of the committee is to obtain and sift information. Even where a\r\nparticular bill is referred to it the primary object is not to take the\r\nplace of debate in the House, and in fact by the present practice a\r\nselect committee saves no step in procedure, a bill when reported by it\r\ngoing to the Committee of the Whole for discussion in detail, precisely\r\nas if no select committee had been appointed.[267:3] Select committees\r\nare the organs, and the only organs, of the House for collecting\r\nevidence and examining witnesses;[267:4] and hence they are commonly\r\ngiven power to send for persons, papers and records. They summon before\r\nthem people whose testimony they wish to obtain; but although a man of\r\nprominence, or a recognised authority on the subject, would, no doubt,\r\nbe summoned at his own request, there is nothing in their procedure in\r\nthe least corresponding to the public hearings customary throughout the\r\nUnited States, where anybody is at liberty to attend and express his\r\nviews--a practice that deserves far more attention than it has yet\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Procedure.]\r\n\r\nIn select committees the procedure follows as closely as possible that\r\nof a Committee of the Whole;[268:1] but they choose their own chairman,\r\nwho has no vote except in case of a tie. They keep minutes, not only of\r\ntheir own proceedings, but also of all evidence taken before them; and\r\nthese, together with the report of their conclusions, are laid before\r\nthe House,[268:2] and published among the parliamentary papers of the\r\nsession. Strictly speaking, a minority report is unknown to English\r\nparliamentary usage, although the habit of placing upon select\r\ncommittees representatives of the various groups of opinion in the House\r\nmakes a disagreement about the report very common. Practically, however,\r\nthe minority attain the same object by moving a substitute for the\r\nreport prepared by the majority, and as the standing orders provide that\r\nevery division in a select committee must be entered upon its\r\nminutes,[268:3] the substitute with the names of those who voted for it,\r\nare submitted to the House, and have the effect of a minority report.\r\n\r\nThe fact that men with all shades of opinions sit upon these committees,\r\nand have an opportunity to examine the witnesses, lifts their reports,\r\nand still more the evidence they collect, above the plane of mere party\r\ndocuments, and gives them a far greater permanent value. Many committees\r\nare not directly concerned with legislation, that is, with a bill\r\nactually pending, but only with inquiry into some grievance, some\r\nalleged defect in the law or in administration, yet their reports often\r\nlay the foundation for future statutes; and, indeed, a large part of the\r\nlegislative or administrative reforms carried out by one or both of the\r\ngreat parties in the state, have been based upon the reports of select\r\ncommittees or royal commissions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joint Committees.]\r\n\r\nFrom obvious motives of convenience joint select committees from the\r\nLords and Commons have been occasionally appointed,[269:1] but owing to\r\nthe different standing of the two Houses they are used chiefly for\r\nprivate bills, and for regulating the intercourse between the two\r\nbodies.[269:2] The principal exceptions of late years have been the\r\njoint committees on statute law revision bills and on the subject of\r\nmunicipal trading.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Standing or Grand Committees.]\r\n\r\nAs the pressure for time in the House of Commons grew more intense,\r\nselect committees that collected information were not enough. Something\r\nwas needed that would save debate in the House, and for this purpose\r\nresolutions were adopted on Dec. 1, 1882, for setting up two large\r\ncommittees on bills relating to law and to trade, whose deliberations\r\nshould take the place of debate in the Committee of the Whole. Such\r\ncommittees were at first an experiment, tried for a couple of sessions,\r\nbut in 1888 they were revived by standing orders, and made permanent\r\norgans of the House.[269:3] As distinguished from select committees,\r\nwhich expire when they have made a report upon the special matters\r\ncommitted to their charge, they were made standing bodies, lasting\r\nthroughout the session, and considering all the bills from time to time\r\nreferred to them; one of them being created to deal with bills relating\r\nto law, courts of justice, and legal procedure; the other with those\r\nrelating to trade, shipping, manufactures, agriculture, and fishing.\r\nThey consist of not less than sixty nor more than eighty members of the\r\nHouse, appointed by the Committee of Selection, which has power to\r\ndischarge members and substitute others during the course of the\r\nsession. In order to secure the presence of persons who may throw light\r\non any particular bill, the same committee can also appoint not more\r\nthan fifteen additional members for the consideration of that bill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Procedure.]\r\n\r\nA peculiar provision was made for the designation of the chairman. At\r\nthe beginning of each session the Committee of Selection appoints a\r\nchairman's panel of not less than four nor more than six members, and\r\nthis body selects from among its members the chairmen of the standing\r\ncommittees[270:1]--a device intended to secure continuity of traditions\r\nand experience in the presiding officer. For the rest, the standing\r\norders prescribed that the procedure in standing committees should be\r\nthe same as in select committees;[270:2] but it would be more accurate\r\nto say, as May does,[270:3] that their proceedings were assimilated, as\r\nfar as possible, to those of a Committee of the Whole House, for they\r\nwere created to do precisely the same work.[270:4] They were to collect\r\nno evidence, examine no witnesses, but simply to debate the clauses of\r\nthe bill in detail, being in fact a substitute for the Committee of the\r\nWhole; that step in the procedure upon a bill being entirely omitted\r\nwhen a bill goes to a standing committee. For this reason they are\r\nminiatures of the House itself, representing all the parties there in\r\nproportion to their numbers. They are samples that stand for the\r\ncomplete House, and like the Committee of the Whole they do not report\r\ntheir opinions, but report the bills referred to them with or without\r\namendments.\r\n\r\nIn one respect only does their position differ materially from that of a\r\nCommittee of the Whole. If the Committee of the Whole makes any\r\namendments in a bill, they can be considered again, and further\r\namendments can be made, upon the report stage. But if it makes no\r\namendments, there is no report stage. This was equally true of the\r\nstanding committees, so that if they did not amend a bill referred to\r\nthem, the House never had an opportunity to do so, but must pass or\r\nreject the bill as first introduced; and, in fact, standing committees\r\nhave been charged with refraining from minor changes in order to prevent\r\namendments, which might hinder or delay the passage of the bill, from\r\nbeing proposed in the House itself.[270:5] This raised so much objection\r\nthat in 1901 the standing orders were changed so as to require a report\r\nstage in the House on all bills from standing committees whether amended\r\nor not.[271:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kind of Bills Referred to Them.]\r\n\r\nThe standing committees were designed primarily to deal with a technical\r\nclass of bills, where the discussion of details would not be of general\r\ninterest.[271:2] For reasons that will be described hereafter, it has\r\nbeen recognised that the bills referred to them ought to be of a\r\nnon-contentious nature, that contentious measures, which arouse strong\r\nparty feelings, are not suited for their consideration. This is the\r\ngeneral principle, not always observed in practice, and there is\r\nsometimes a sharp difference of opinion upon the question whether a\r\nparticular bill is contentious or not.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Utility.]\r\n\r\nWithin their limits the utility of the standing committees in\r\nlegislation cannot be doubted. On the average about one seventh of the\r\npublic bills enacted year by year have passed through their hands, and\r\nthe proportion has shown a slight tendency to increase.[271:3] Moreover,\r\nthe pressure for time in the House of Commons has become so great that a\r\nbill has a better chance of getting through if referred to a standing\r\ncommittee than if it has to undergo the ordeal of a long debate in\r\nCommittee of the Whole. Every year the government is obliged by lack of\r\ntime to drop something like one third of the bills it has introduced,\r\nbut those of its bills that are referred to the standing committees\r\nrarely fail to be enacted. In the case of bills brought in by private\r\nmembers the contrast is even more striking; for while scarcely one tenth\r\nof all such bills become law, more than one half of those among them\r\nfortunate enough to reach a standing committee are enacted.[271:4] In\r\nfact these committees furnish by far the best chance of passing private\r\nmembers' bills through the House of Commons.[272:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Standing Committee for Scotland.]\r\n\r\nWhen the two great committees were revived in 1888, motions were made to\r\ncreate others to consider bills relating to Scotland and Wales. The\r\nmotions were all rejected at the time; but in 1894 the Liberal\r\ngovernment took the matter up in the case of Scotland, and in that year\r\nand the next carried resolutions establishing such a committee for the\r\nsession. It consisted of all the members for Scotch constituencies,\r\nseventy-two in number, and of fifteen or twenty others appointed by the\r\ncommittee of selection. On each occasion the plan was vigorously\r\nopposed,[272:2] the chief objections being; that it tended toward\r\nlegislative dismemberment of the United Kingdom; that such a committee\r\nwould not, like the other standing committees, reflect fairly the\r\nproportion of the parties in the House, because two thirds of the Scotch\r\nmembers were Liberals;[272:3] and that the bills referred to it would\r\nnot be exclusively of a non-contentious nature. When the Conservatives\r\ncame to power they quietly dropped this committee. Even had they felt no\r\nother reason for doing so, it would, no doubt, have been enough that, in\r\nspite of considerable losses at the general election of 1895, the\r\nLiberals were still in a majority among the Scotch members. The creation\r\nof such a body illustrates, however, the exceptional position of\r\nScotland in the British Parliament; and any one who has followed a\r\ndebate on an ordinary Scotch bill, and observed how largely it is\r\nconfined to Scotch members, will realise that practically the resolution\r\nof 1894 did little more than sanction formally by means of a standing\r\ncommittee the kind of discussion that habitually takes place in the\r\nCommittee of the Whole.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Four Standing Committees of 1907.]\r\n\r\nWith a view to enlarging the legislative capacity of Parliament a select\r\ncommittee on Procedure in the House of Commons reported on May 25, 1906,\r\nin favour of increasing the number of standing committees from two to\r\nfour, and making the reference of bills to them the normal, instead of\r\nan exceptional, proceeding. In pursuance of this recommendation the\r\nHouse on April 16, 1907, changed standing orders 46, 47, and 48[273:1]\r\nso that there should be four standing committees, one of which is in\r\neffect the former Scotch Committee, while the other three are to\r\nconsider any bills that may be referred to them, and not as heretofore\r\nonly those relating to law or to trade.[273:2] All bills, except money\r\nbills and bills for confirming provisional orders, are to be referred to\r\none of the standing committees, unless the House otherwise order on a\r\nmotion to be decided without amendment or debate; and the bills are to\r\nbe distributed among the committees by the Speaker.\r\n\r\nThe object of the change was to give a better chance of enactment for\r\nmeasures which there is not time to debate in Committee of the Whole;\r\nand the provision that the House may vote not to send a bill to a\r\nstanding committee was designed chiefly for the great party measures of\r\nthe government which must always be debated in the House itself. The new\r\nprocedure has not been in operation long enough to judge of its effects,\r\nbut something will be said of its relation to the parliamentary form of\r\ngovernment in the chapter on the \"Cabinet's Control of the Commons.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Procedure on Public Bills.]\r\n\r\nThe steps through which an ordinary public bill must still pass are very\r\nnumerous, but while formerly a debate and division might take place at\r\neach of them, of late years the opportunity for this--and practically\r\nthe number of steps--has been much reduced by causing some of them to be\r\ntaken as a matter of course without a vote, and by permitting no debate\r\non others. This is well illustrated at the outset of a bill's career,\r\nwhere, indeed, an old complex procedure and a later and simpler one\r\ncontinue to exist side by side.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Introduction and First Reading.]\r\n\r\nA bill may be introduced in one of three ways. A motion may be made for\r\nan order for leave to bring it in, accompanied by a speech explaining\r\nits objects, and followed by a debate and vote. This was formerly the\r\nonly method, and debates lasting over several days have occurred at this\r\nstage.[274:1] Amendments might be moved hostile to the provisions of the\r\nbill. In fact the adoption of such an amendment to a militia bill caused\r\nthe fall of Lord John Russell's ministry in 1852. Now only important\r\ngovernment bills are introduced in that way; for by a standing order\r\nadopted in 1888 a motion to bring in a bill may be made at the\r\ncommencement of public business, and after brief explanatory statements\r\nby the mover and one opponent the Speaker may put the question.[274:2]\r\nFrom the length of time taken by the speeches this is known as the\r\nten-minute rule. After an order to bring in a bill has been obtained in\r\neither of these ways, the question that the bill be read a first time is\r\nvoted upon without amendment or debate.[274:3] Finally, in 1902, a still\r\nmore expeditious process was established. It permits a member to present\r\nhis bill, which is read a first time without any order or vote of the\r\nHouse whatever.[274:4]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second Reading.]\r\n\r\nThe next step, and, except on great party measures, the first occasion\r\nfor a debate, is the second reading. This is the proper stage for a\r\ndiscussion of the general principles of the bill, not of its details,\r\nand amendments to the several clauses are not in order. The methods of\r\nopposing the second reading are somewhat technical. The form of the\r\nquestion is \"that this bill be _now_ read a second time\"; and a negative\r\nvote does not kill the bill, because it does not prevent a motion to\r\nread it being made on a subsequent day.[274:5]\r\n\r\nIn order to shelve the bill without forcing a direct vote upon it, the\r\nhabit formerly prevailed of moving the previous question;[275:1] but\r\nthis was open to the same objection, and had, in fact, the effect of the\r\nAmerican practice of moving to lay the bill upon the table. A similar\r\ndifficulty arises when an amendment is moved stating some special reason\r\nfor not reading the bill. It may express the sense of the House, but it\r\ndoes not necessarily dispose of the measure. Of late years, therefore,\r\nit has been customary to move that the bill be read this day six months,\r\nor three months, the date being such as to fall beyond the end of the\r\nsession. On the general principle that a question which the House has\r\ndecided cannot be raised again, such a vote kills the bill. Nor does it\r\nmake any difference that the House happens to be sitting at the end of\r\nsix months, for that date is treated as a sort of Greek calends that\r\nnever comes.[275:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Committee of the Whole.]\r\n\r\nAfter the second reading a bill, until 1907, went normally to the\r\nCommittee of the Whole, with or without instructions,[275:3] and now it\r\ngoes there if the House so decides. When the order of the day for the\r\nCommittee of the Whole is reached the Speaker leaves the chair, and the\r\nHouse goes into committee without question put.[275:4] This is the stage\r\nfor consideration of the bill in detail, and the clauses are taken up\r\none after another, the amendments to each clause being disposed of in\r\ntheir order. Then new clauses may be proposed, and finally the bill is\r\nreported back to the House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reference to a Select Committee]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: or Standing Committee.]\r\n\r\nNormally a bill goes either to the Committee of the Whole or to a\r\nstanding committee, but after it has been read a second time a motion\r\nmay be made to refer it to a select committee. Such a reference simply\r\nadds a step to the journey of the bill, for when reported it goes to a\r\nstanding committee or to the Committee of the Whole. A standing\r\ncommittee, on the other hand, is, as already explained, a substitute for\r\nthe Committee of the Whole. It deals with the bill in precisely the same\r\nway, reporting it back to the House amended or unchanged.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Report.]\r\n\r\nWhen a bill has been reported from the Committee of the Whole with\r\namendments,[276:1] and when it has been reported from a standing\r\ncommittee whether amended or not,[276:2] it is considered by the House\r\nin detail, upon what is known as the report stage. The object is to give\r\nthe House an opportunity to review the work done in committee, and see\r\nwhether it wishes to maintain the amendments there adopted. But the\r\nHouse is not restricted to confirming or reversing the changes made in\r\nthe bill, and although the process of going through the measure clause\r\nby clause is not repeated, fresh amendments may be proposed and new\r\nclauses added.[276:3]\r\n\r\nIf the bill is reported from a Committee of the Whole without\r\namendments, it is assumed that the details are satisfactory to the\r\nHouse, and there is no report stage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Third Reading.]\r\n\r\nThe next, and now the last, stage of a bill in the House of Commons is\r\nthe third reading. Like the second reading, this raises only the\r\nquestion whether or not the House approves of the measure as a whole,\r\nand the moves for compassing its defeat are the same. Verbal amendments\r\nalone are in order, and any substantial alteration can be brought about\r\nonly by moving to recommit.\r\n\r\nUsually the several steps in the enactment of a bill are taken on\r\ndifferent days,[277:1] but there is nothing in the rules of the House of\r\nCommons to require this, and urgent measures have at times passed\r\nthrough all their stages in both Houses in one day. The last case was\r\nthat of the Explosive Substances Bill passed in 1883 under the pressure\r\nof the dynamite scare.[277:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lords' Amendments.]\r\n\r\nWhen a bill passed by one House is amended by the other, it is sent back\r\nfor the consideration of those amendments. If they are agreed to, the\r\nbill is ready for the royal assent. If not, the bill is returned, and a\r\ncommittee is appointed to frame a message to the other House, stating\r\nthe reasons for disagreement.[277:3] The other House may, of course,\r\nwaive its amendments, insist upon them or modify them, and the bill\r\nmight thus, with new changes, go back and forth between the Houses\r\nindefinitely. Formerly it was the habit, when the Houses failed to\r\nagree, to appoint managers to hold a conference, but this practice has\r\nfallen into disuse,[277:4] and in the case of government bills--almost\r\nall important bills to-day are government bills--negotiations are\r\ncarried on between the ministers and the leading peers who oppose them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summary of the Procedure.]\r\n\r\nLeaving out of account the first reading, which rarely involves a real\r\ndebate, the ordinary course of a public bill through the House of\r\nCommons gives, therefore, an opportunity for two debates upon its\r\ngeneral merits, and between them two discussions of its details, or one\r\ndebate upon the details if that one results in no changes, or if the\r\nbill has been referred to a standing committee. When the House desires\r\nto collect evidence it does so after approving of the general\r\nprinciple, and before taking up the details. Stated in this way the\r\nwhole matter is plain and rational enough. It is, in fact, one of the\r\nmany striking examples of adaptation in the English political system. A\r\ncollection of rules that appear cumbrous and antiquated, and that even\r\nnow are well-nigh incomprehensible when described in all their involved\r\ntechnicality, have been pruned away until they furnish a procedure\r\nalmost as simple, direct and appropriate as any one could devise. Many\r\nold forms remain, but they have been shorn of their meaning, and often\r\namount to nothing but entries in the journal. Even the first reading,\r\nwhich seems anomalous, has its use. A real debate at that stage occurs\r\nonly in the case of great party measures, where both sides of the House\r\nwant to be familiar with the scope of the bill, the objections that may\r\nbe made to it, and the way it strikes the public, before the first\r\neffective debate upon its merits opens. The procedure upon money bills,\r\nwhich appears at first sight still more arbitrary, and complex, is\r\nperfectly rational also, and the differences from the method of passing\r\nordinary measures arise from the nature of the case. There can be no\r\ndoubt about the general principle of the annual appropriation bill.\r\nSupplies must be voted to carry on the government, and the only\r\nquestions arise over particular grants. Hence there is no object in\r\nopening with a first or second reading, and the procedure begins in\r\ncommittee. But in order to understand how this works out one must again\r\ngo back to the technical rules.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[265:1] _Cf._ Redlich, 474-78.\r\n\r\n[265:2] S.O. 33.\r\n\r\n[265:3] _Cf._ S.O. 55.\r\n\r\n[265:4] _Cf._ S.O. 56-57.\r\n\r\n[266:1] Standing Orders (relative to private business), 98.\r\n\r\n[266:2] \"Seventy Years at Westminster,\" 267 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[266:3] _Ibid._, 103-15.\r\n\r\n[266:4] S.O. 75.\r\n\r\n[266:5] S.O. 76-80.\r\n\r\n[267:1] \"At the commencement of every session an order is made 'That a\r\ncommittee of privileges be appointed,' but no members have been\r\nnominated to it since 1847.\" \"Manual of Procedure of the House of\r\nCommons,\" prepared in 1904 by Sir Courtenay Ilbert, Clerk of the House,\r\nSec. 110.

It will be\r\nremembered that, with some exceptions already described, all the\r\nnational revenues are first paid into the Consolidated Fund, and then\r\ndrawn out of it to meet the expenditures of the government. The\r\nfinancial work of Parliament, like that of the administration, turns,\r\ntherefore, upon the processes of getting money into and out of that\r\nfund. The second process comes first in the order of parliamentary\r\nbusiness, and its nature is fixed by two standing orders, which date\r\nfrom the early years of the eighteenth century. One of them, adopted in\r\n1707, provides that the House will not proceed upon any petition or\r\nmotion for granting money but in Committee of the Whole House;[279:1]\r\nthe other, that it will not receive any petition, or proceed upon any\r\nmotion, for a grant or charge upon the public revenue unless recommended\r\nfrom the Crown.[279:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Rule that Appropriations Require Consent of the Crown.]\r\n\r\nThis last rule, first adopted by a resolution in 1706, and made a\r\nstanding order in 1713,[279:3] was designed to prevent improvident\r\nexpenditure on private initiative. It has proved not only an invaluable\r\nprotection to the Treasury, but a bulwark for the authority of the\r\nministry.[280:1] Its importance has been so well recognised that it has\r\nbeen embodied in the fundamental laws of the self-governing\r\ncolonies;[280:2] while some foreign countries, like France and Italy,\r\nthat have copied the forms of parliamentary government, without always\r\nperceiving the foundation on which they rest, have suffered not a little\r\nfrom its absence.[280:3]\r\n\r\nEven in England the rule has been at times evaded. About the middle of\r\nthe last century, it was the habit to bring in bills involving the\r\nexpenditure of public funds, and avoid a violation of the rule by\r\ninserting a clause that the expenses incurred should be \"defrayed out of\r\nmoneys to be hereafter voted by Parliament.\" But a vote in favour of\r\nsuch a bill was clearly an expression of opinion that well-nigh\r\ncompelled the ministers to include the expense in their next estimates.\r\nThis practice was stopped in 1866 by changing the standing order so as\r\nto provide that the House will not \"proceed upon any motion for a grant\r\nor charge upon the public revenue, whether payable out of the\r\nconsolidated fund, or out of moneys to be provided by Parliament, unless\r\nrecommended from the Crown.\"[280:4] The change, however, does not\r\nabsolutely prevent the House from forcing the hands of the government. A\r\nresolution can be passed in abstract and general terms in favour of a\r\ncertain kind of expenditure, the construction of harbours of refuge, for\r\nexample; or an address to the Crown can be adopted asking for an\r\nexpenditure, and promising \"that this House will make good the same,\" a\r\nprocedure followed in erecting statues on the death of great leaders of\r\nthe House.[281:1]\r\n\r\nAs late as 1877 Mr. Gladstone lamented the loss of financial control by\r\nthe Crown, complaining that, by addresses, resolutions, and even bills,\r\nthe House pledged itself to expenditure for local claims or the\r\ninterests of classes and individuals, and that the government was\r\nmorally bound to redeem the pledges. This he thought was carried so far\r\nas to be a great public mischief.[281:2] Whether such a statement was an\r\nexaggeration at that time or not, it would hardly be repeated now; for\r\non the one hand the control of the cabinet over the House, and on the\r\nother the obstacles encountered by private members in passing measures,\r\nhave increased so much that it is very difficult, without the help of\r\nthe Treasury Bench, to get the House to adopt anything to which there is\r\nserious opposition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Rule Prevents Increase of the Estimates.]\r\n\r\nAlthough in terms the rule applies only to a motion for making a grant,\r\nit has been construed to cover any amendment for increasing a grant\r\nbeyond the amount recommended from the Crown,[281:3]--an extension\r\ncertainly needed to protect both the Treasury and the authority of the\r\nministers. When, therefore, the minister moves that a sum of money be\r\ngranted for a definite purpose, no amendment is in order either to\r\nincrease that sum or to alter its destination.[281:4] But the rule does\r\nnot forbid a reduction. It follows that if any member deems the sum\r\nnamed too small, his only course is to move to reduce it in order to\r\ndraw attention to its insufficiency. Reductions of one hundred pounds\r\nare, in fact, constantly moved to make an occasion for discussing some\r\ngrievance connected with the service in question, and they afford a\r\nready means of protest, free from peril to the Treasury.[282:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Rule is Applied to Taxes.]\r\n\r\nA still greater extension of the rule is made in its application to\r\ntaxes; but this depends not upon the standing order, but upon a general\r\nconstitutional principle which has gradually been evolved therefrom. The\r\nprinciple has, in fact, been expanded until it may be stated in the\r\ngeneral form that no motion can be made to raise or expend national\r\nrevenue without a recommendation from the Crown, or to increase the sum\r\nasked for by the Crown. The government has accordingly the exclusive\r\nright to propose fresh national taxation, whether in the form of new\r\ntaxes or of higher rates for existing ones,[282:2] and no private member\r\ncan move to augment the taxes so proposed.[282:3] He can, however, move\r\nto reduce them, and he is even free to bring in a bill to repeal or\r\nreduce taxes which the government has not proposed to touch.[283:1]\r\nMoreover, as the principle merely forbids him to urge an increase of the\r\nburdens upon the people beyond the point at which they stand, or the\r\npoint at which the ministers propose to place them, he can, when the\r\ngovernment suggests a reduction of a tax, move an amendment to reduce it\r\nless,[283:2] and when the government brings in a plan for a revision of\r\ntaxation, he can move to substitute a somewhat different tax for the one\r\nproposed, provided the amount of revenue yielded will not be\r\ngreater.[283:3] But these rights are seldom used, and almost never with\r\nsuccess; otherwise they would, no doubt, be found objectionable and\r\nswept away.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons, at the present day, certainly stimulates\r\nextravagance, rather than economy; but this is done by opinions\r\nexpressed in debate, not by specific proposals made by the members. It\r\nis done by criticising the administration, by complaints, for example,\r\nthat the Army and Navy are insufficient for the defence of the empire.\r\nThe result is a growth in the budgets prepared by the ministry; but this\r\nis a very different thing from expenditure directly caused by the\r\nirresponsible action of private members. The former is deliberate and\r\nreflects public opinion, the latter may originate in personal or local\r\nfeelings, and then be adopted through heedless good nature or skilful\r\nlog-rolling.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Committee of Supply.]\r\n\r\nAs grants of money can be taken up only in Committee of the Whole, and\r\nonly on the recommendation of the Crown,--that is, of a minister--the\r\nHouse resolves itself, early in the session, into Committee of the Whole\r\non Supply, to consider the estimates submitted by the government.[283:4]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Consolidated Fund Charges.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Estimates for the Supply Services.]\r\n\r\nNow it will be remembered that certain charges, such as the interest on\r\nthe national debt, the royal civil list, and the salaries of the judges,\r\nare payable by statute out of the Consolidated Fund, and hence do not\r\nrequire an annual vote of Parliament, or come before the Committee of\r\nSupply. The estimates for the rest of the expenditures for the coming\r\nyear, known as the supply services, are divided into three parts,\r\nrelating to the Army, the Navy, and the civil services. The last of the\r\nthree is divided into classes, and all of them are divided into grants\r\nor votes, which are in turn subdivided into subheads and items. Each\r\ngrant is the subject of a separate vote in Committee of Supply, and\r\namendments may be moved to omit or reduce any item therein.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Votes on Account.]\r\n\r\nThe English financial system aims at precision. It is deemed of great\r\nimportance that the estimates should be as accurate as they can be made,\r\nand hence they must be prepared as short a time as possible before going\r\ninto effect. They are made up in the several departments late in the\r\nautumn, then submitted for revision to the Treasury, and laid before\r\nParliament shortly after it meets about the middle of February. But as\r\nthe financial year begins on April 1, it is manifest that the Committee\r\nof Supply cannot finish its discussion of them by that time. With the\r\nwork it must do in passing upon supplementary estimates for the current\r\nyear, it can, in fact, make little progress with those of the coming\r\nyear during March, and yet money must be spent, and there must be legal\r\nauthority to spend it, especially as the unspent balances of\r\nappropriations lapse at the close of the financial year in which they\r\nare voted. The committee, therefore, passes votes on account to cover\r\nthe time until the regular appropriations are made. The reader will,\r\nperhaps, recall the fact that in the military and naval services an\r\nexcess on one grant may, with the approval of the Treasury, be used to\r\ncover deficiencies on other grants, and hence it is the habit in the\r\ncase of those services to vote in March the grant for the pay and wages\r\nof the men for the whole year, and use the money so obtained for all\r\npurposes until the appropriations have been completed. In the civil\r\nservices, where this is not allowed, votes on account are passed for all\r\nthe grants, large enough to carry on the government for four or five\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Supplementary Grants.]\r\n\r\nWith the utmost effort at accuracy in the estimates they will always\r\nprove to be insufficient in some branch of the service, or an unexpected\r\nneed for expenditure will arise; and to provide funds in such cases\r\nsupplementary estimates must be presented and voted before the close of\r\nthe financial year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Excess Grants.]\r\n\r\nThere may also be other expenses outside the estimates, which have, by\r\nthe authority vested in the Treasury, been temporarily met by advances\r\nfrom the Civil Contingencies Fund or the Treasury Chest Fund, or from\r\nextra receipts of the department. These do not require an immediate\r\nappropriation; but they are reported to the Committee on Public Accounts\r\nat the next regular session after the close of the financial year, and\r\nthen presented to the Committee of Supply to be covered at once by an\r\nexcess grant.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of March, therefore, the Committee of Supply must pass\r\nthe supplementary grants for the year then coming to a close, the excess\r\ngrants for the preceding year, the votes on account for the coming year,\r\nand make such progress as it can with the regular estimates for that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Consolidated Fund Acts.]\r\n\r\nBut the committee merely passes and reports to the House resolutions in\r\nfavour of those grants, and the money cannot be paid out of the\r\nConsolidated Fund without the authority of a statute. The next step is\r\ntaken in the Committee of the Whole on Ways and Means, where on the\r\nmotion of a minister another resolution is passed, that to make good the\r\nsupply already voted, the sum required be granted out of the\r\nConsolidated Fund. This in turn must be reported to and confirmed by the\r\nHouse.[285:1] A bill called a Consolidated Fund Bill is then brought in\r\nto give effect to the resolution. The bill, with the separate grants\r\nannexed in a schedule, goes through the ordinary stages; but the time\r\nspent upon it is short, because its only object being to authorise the\r\nissue of money to cover the supply already voted, no amendment can be\r\nmoved to reduce the amount, or change the destination, of the\r\ngrants.[286:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Appropriation Act.]\r\n\r\nThe first Consolidated Fund Act must be passed in time to receive the\r\nroyal assent before April 1. One or two more follow from time to time as\r\nthe Committee of Supply makes its way slowly through the\r\nestimates.[286:2] Finally, after the whole supply for the year has been\r\nvoted, the Appropriation Bill is brought in, which sums up and embodies\r\nall the grants for the services of the year, prescribes their\r\napplication by means of the schedules annexed, and authorises their\r\npayment out of the Consolidated Fund. This is usually passed on the last\r\nday of the session.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Budget.]\r\n\r\nSo much for the process of getting money out of the Consolidated Fund.\r\nThat of getting money into the fund goes on at the same time, but\r\nindependently. It is usually early in April that the Chancellor\r\nintroduces his budget in the Committee of Ways and Means. In an\r\nelaborate speech he reviews the finances of the past year, comparing the\r\nresults with the estimates, and dealing with the state of trade and the\r\nnational debt. He then refers to the estimates already submitted, and\r\ncoming to the gist of his speech, and the part of it that is awaited\r\nwith curiosity, he explains how he proposes to raise the revenue\r\nrequired to meet the expenditures. As he could have no right to take the\r\nfloor without a motion before the House, he concludes by moving one or\r\nmore of a series of resolutions containing the changes in taxation, or\r\nthe continuation of temporary taxes, that he desires.\r\n\r\nAbout three quarters of the revenue is derived from permanent taxes,\r\nwhich are rarely changed, and require no action by Parliament from year\r\nto year. But in order to adjust the income closely to expenses, certain\r\ntaxes are voted for a year at a time, their rates being raised or\r\nlowered as may be required to balance the budget. For many years the\r\nonly imposts so treated were the income tax and the duty on tea; one of\r\nthem being regarded as a direct tax levied upon property, and the other\r\nas an indirect tax resting upon the mass of the people. Recently,\r\nhowever, the duties on tobacco, beer and spirits, and the corresponding\r\nexcises on beer and spirits, have been increased, and the additions so\r\nmade have been voted from year to year.\r\n\r\nThe budget speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer is followed by a\r\ngeneral discussion of the questions he has raised, and either at once,\r\nor on subsequent days, by debates and votes upon the resolutions he has\r\nbrought in. The resolutions when adopted are reported to the House for\r\nratification, but as in the case of supply, they have no legal effect\r\nuntil enacted in the form of a statute. Perhaps it would be more correct\r\nto say that they have no legal validity; because in order to prevent\r\nlarge importations made to avoid a projected increase in a duty, it is\r\ncustomary to prescribe in the resolution a date near at hand when the\r\ntax shall take effect, and to collect it from that date if the\r\nresolution has been agreed to by the House on report. The collection is\r\nquite unauthorised by law at the time, but it is afterward ratified by a\r\nstatute which fixes the same date for the operation of the tax; and this\r\ngives the transaction complete legal validity, because Parliament has\r\npower to pass a retroactive law. If for any reason the provision for the\r\ntax fails of enactment, the duties that have been collected are, of\r\ncourse, refunded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Finance Act.]\r\n\r\nIt was formerly the habit to include in the fiscal resolutions based\r\nupon the budget, and in the act to give them effect, the annual and\r\ntemporary taxes alone; the permanent taxes, and especially those imposed\r\nrather for economic reasons than for the purpose of revenue, being dealt\r\nwith by special acts.[287:1] But the use of taxation for revenue only,\r\nand still more a quarrel with the House of Lords, brought about a change\r\nof system. In 1860 the government determined to repeal the paper duties,\r\nwhich hindered the publication of cheap newspapers, and were decried as\r\na tax on knowledge. The loss of revenue was taken into account in the\r\nfinancial plans of the year; but according to custom the repeal of the\r\nduties was contained in a separate bill by itself. The Lords, after\r\npassing the act to give effect to the rest of the budget, rejected this\r\nbill. At the moment the Commons could do nothing save express their\r\nopinions; but the next year they included the repeal of the paper duties\r\nin the annual tax bill, and the Lords were constrained to pass it; for\r\nalthough the Peers do not formally admit the claim of the Commons that\r\nthey must accept or reject money bills without alteration, they never\r\nventure to amend them. The policy of including all the taxes in one bill\r\nhas developed into a permanent practice, and under the name of the\r\nFinance Bill this now includes all fiscal regulations relating both to\r\nthe revenue and to the national debt.[288:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Public Accounts.]\r\n\r\nThe whole initiative, as regards both revenue and expenditure, lies with\r\nthe government alone. The House has merely power to reject or reduce the\r\namounts asked for, and it uses that power very little. Financially, its\r\nwork is rather supervision than direction; and its real usefulness\r\nconsists in securing publicity and criticism rather than in controlling\r\nexpenditure. It is the tribunal where at the opening of the financial\r\nyear the ministers must explain and justify every detail of their fiscal\r\npolicy, and where at its close they must render an account of their\r\nstewardship. This last duty is highly important. The House receives\r\nevery year reports of the administration of the finances from three\r\nindependent bodies, or to be more accurate, it receives two distinct\r\nsets of accounts and one report.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Finance Accounts.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible after the close of the financial year, the Treasury\r\nsubmits the Finance Accounts, which cover all receipts paid into, and\r\nall issues out of, the Consolidated Fund, giving the sources from which\r\nthe revenue was derived and the purpose for which the issues were\r\nmade.[289:1] As these accounts are based, not upon the sums expended by\r\nthe different branches of the government, but upon the amounts\r\ntransferred to their credit at the Banks of England and Ireland, they\r\ncan be compiled quickly; and, in fact, they are laid before Parliament\r\nnear the end of June, about three months after the close of the\r\nfinancial year to which they relate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Appropriation Accounts.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Comptroller and Auditor General--who holds his office\r\nduring good behaviour, with a salary paid by statute directly out of the\r\nConsolidated Fund, and who considers himself in no sense a servant of\r\nthe Treasury, but an officer responsible to the House of\r\nCommons[289:2]--examines the accounts of the several departments. This\r\nis a matter requiring much time, and it is not until the opening of the\r\nnext regular session that he presents what are known as the\r\nAppropriation Accounts,[289:3] covering in great detail the actual\r\nexpenditures in all the supply services, with his reports and comments\r\nthereon.[289:4]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Committee of Public Accounts.]\r\n\r\nHis accounts and reports are referred to the Committee of Public\r\nAccounts, which consists of eleven members of the House chosen at the\r\nbeginning of the session,[289:5] and includes the Financial Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, some one who has held a similar office under the\r\nopposite party, and other men interested in the subject. It inspects the\r\naccounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General's notes of the reason\r\nwhy more or less than the estimate was spent on each item. It inquires\r\ninto the items that need further explanation, examining for the purpose\r\nthe auditing officers of the departments, and other persons; and it\r\nmakes a series of reports to the House, which refer in detail to the\r\ncases where an excess grant must be made by Parliament, or a transfer\r\nbetween grants in the military departments must be approved.[290:1]\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Public Accounts has undoubtedly great influence in\r\nkeeping the expenditures very strictly within the appropriations, and\r\nfrom time to time it expresses its opinions strongly about any laxity in\r\nthat respect--remarks that are not forgotten by the officials. But there\r\nhas been much complaint that the House itself, while criticising the\r\nadministrative conduct of the government freely in the discussion of the\r\nestimates, takes little interest in their financial aspect; and,\r\ntherefore, the recent Committee on National Expenditure has suggested\r\nthat one day, at least, should be set apart for the discussion of the\r\nreport of the Committee on Public Accounts.[290:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indian Revenue Accounts.]\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of anomalous cases where, by statute, the estimates\r\nfor a service are not voted by Parliament, but the accounts are\r\nafterward submitted to it for approval. This is true of India; and the\r\nprovision is a wise one, for it allows the government of that country to\r\nbe conducted by the authorities on the spot, who are alone competent to\r\ndo it, and yet it reserves to the House of Commons an opportunity for\r\nsupervision and criticism. On one of the last days of the session a\r\nmotion is made to go into Committee of the Whole to consider these\r\naccounts, and on that motion a general debate on Indian affairs is in\r\norder. In the committee itself only a formal motion is made certifying\r\nthe total revenue and expenditure, and debate is confined to the\r\neconomic and financial condition of the dependency.[291:1] In the same\r\nway the expenses of Greenwich Hospital are, by statute, defrayed out of\r\nits revenues, but the accounts are submitted to the House annually, with\r\na resolution for their approval.[291:2]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[279:1] S.O. 67.\r\n\r\n[279:2] S.O. 66. May (527) points out that these two rules, together\r\nwith S.O. 68, adopted in 1715, that the House will receive no petition\r\nfor compounding a revenue debt due to the Crown without a certificate\r\nfrom the proper officer stating the facts, were for more than a century\r\nthe only standing orders of the House.\r\n\r\n[279:3] Todd, \"Parl.

There was the famous case\r\nin 1895 when a motion was made to reduce the salary of the Secretary of\r\nState for War to draw attention to the alleged lack of supply of\r\ncordite. The defeat of the government in this case furnished the\r\noccasion for the resignation of Lord Rosebery's cabinet. (Hans. 4 Ser.\r\nXXXIV., 1685-1711, 1742.)\r\n\r\nIn 1904 Mr. Redmond, the leader of the Irish Nationalists, moved to\r\nreduce by 100_l._ the appropriation for education in Ireland, and\r\nobtained a majority of 141 to 130. Mr. Balfour, declining to treat the\r\nmatter seriously, remarked that the Irish leader had succeeded in\r\nreducing the grant to Ireland by 100_l._; to which the latter replied\r\nthat defeating the government at a cost of 100_l._ was money well spent.\r\n(Hans. 4 Ser. CXXXI., 1141-47.)\r\n\r\nAgain in 1906 a motion to reduce by 100_l._ the appropriation for the\r\nIrish Land Commission was carried by a vote of 199 to 196. (Hans. 4 Ser.\r\nCXLIX., 1459-86.) After some reflection the government decided that it\r\nwas not a sufficient cause either for resignation or dissolution,\r\nalthough the ministry was undoubtedly losing its hold upon the country.\r\nIn each of these three cases the defeat of the government was an\r\naccident, the result of a \"snap vote.\"\r\n\r\n[282:2] May, 532-33, 589.

They have been driven to do so partly as\r\na defence against wilful obstruction by minorities, and partly as a\r\nmeans of getting through their work. Although following the path with\r\ngreat reluctance, the House of Commons has been no exception to the\r\nrule. With the evolution of popular government it has become more\r\nrepresentative and less self-contained. Formerly an important public\r\nmeasure gave rise to one great debate, conducted mainly by the leading\r\nmen, and the vote that followed was deemed to settle the question. The\r\ncase had been argued, Parliament had rendered its verdict, and that\r\nended the matter. But now every one has his eye upon the country\r\noutside. The ordinary member is not satisfied to have the case argued\r\nwell; he wants to take part in the argument himself. He wants the\r\npublic, and especially his own constituents, to see that he is active,\r\ncapable, and to some extent prominent.[292:1] He watches, therefore, his\r\nchance to express his views at some stage in the proceedings.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the strategy of the leaders of the Opposition has changed.\r\nThey are not trying merely to persuade the House, or to register their\r\nprotests there. They are speaking to the nation, striving to convince\r\nthe voters of the righteousness of their cause, and of the earnestness,\r\ndevotion, and tenacity with which they are urging it. Hence they take\r\nevery opportunity for resistance offered by the rules, and fight\r\ndoggedly at every step. Just as in war the great battle that settled a\r\ncampaign has been replaced by a long series of stubborn contests behind\r\nintrenchments; so in the important issues of parliamentary warfare, the\r\nsingle conclusive debate has given way to many struggles that take place\r\nwhenever the rules afford a means of resistance. This may not be done\r\nfor the sake of obstruction or delay, but it consumes time, and it has\r\nmade some process of cutting off debate and reaching a vote an absolute\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First Used in 1881.]\r\n\r\nThe first resort to such a process was brought about by deliberate\r\nobstruction. This had been felt to be an evil for a dozen years,[293:1]\r\nand was made intolerable by the tactics of the Irish members in opposing\r\nthe introduction of the coercion bill of 1881. Several nights of debate\r\nwere followed by a continuous session of forty-one hours; when the\r\nSpeaker, on his return to the chair, of which he had been for a time\r\nrelieved by his deputy, interrupting the discussion, said that the\r\ndignity, the credit and the authority of the House were threatened, and\r\nthat he was satisfied he should but carry out its will by putting the\r\nquestion forthwith.[293:2] His action was not authorised by standing\r\norder or by precedent, but whether justifiable or not, it marked an\r\nepoch in parliamentary history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Urgency Resolution of 1881.]\r\n\r\nBrand, the Speaker, had not come to his decision without consulting\r\nGladstone, then Prime Minister; and had made his action conditional upon\r\nthe introduction of some regular process for coping with\r\nobstruction.[293:3] Gladstone at once gave notice of an urgency\r\nresolution, which was speedily adopted, thanks to the suspension of all\r\nthe Irish members for interrupting debate contrary to the orders of the\r\nchair. The resolution enabled a minister to move that the state of\r\npublic business with regard to any pending measure was urgent. This\r\nmotion was to be put forthwith without debate, and if carried by a\r\nmajority of three to one in a House of not less than three hundred\r\nmembers, was to vest in the Speaker, for the purpose of proceeding with\r\nsuch measure, all the powers of the House for the regulation of its\r\nbusiness.[294:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Urgency Rules.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Closure Rule of 1882.]\r\n\r\nThe language was vague, but the intent was clear. The urgency resolution\r\nsanctioned for the future the authority recently assumed by the chair.\r\nThe Speaker, however, not wishing to make what might appear to be an\r\narbitrary use of his new powers, laid before the House a number of rules\r\nby which he should be guided;[294:2] and these have furnished the\r\nsuggestions for much of the later procedure for curtailing\r\ndebate.[294:3] The one dealing with the primary object of the resolution\r\nprovided that when it appeared to the Speaker, or to the Chairman in\r\nCommittee of Supply or Ways and Means, to be the general sense of the\r\nHouse that the question should be put, he might so inform the House, and\r\nthen a motion made to that effect should be voted upon without debate,\r\nand if carried by a majority of three to one, the original question\r\nshould be put forthwith. The urgency motion was used at once to push\r\nthrough a couple of bills relating to Ireland; but the resolution\r\nexpired with the session, and after being revived for a short time the\r\nnext year, it was replaced in the autumn of 1882 by a standing order\r\nbased upon the Speaker's rules.[295:1] The new order made, however, two\r\nchanges in the procedure. Instead of being applicable only after urgency\r\nhad been voted, on a motion by a minister, in regard to some particular\r\nmeasure, it could be used at any time; and instead of requiring a vote\r\nof three to one, it required either a bare majority, if two hundred\r\naffirmative votes were cast, or one hundred affirmative votes, if there\r\nwere less than forty votes against it. Instead, therefore, of being a\r\nweapon that could be used only in cases of exceptional obstruction by a\r\nsmall group, it became a process applicable at any time to limit debate\r\nby the minority. But although apparently a regular part of the procedure\r\nof the House, the motion to cut off further debate could be made only on\r\nthe suggestion of the Speaker, and this vested in him an arbitrary\r\ninitiative which he was loth to exercise. The standing order was, in\r\nfact, put into operation on two occasions only, on Feb. 24, 1885, and on\r\nFeb. 17, 1887.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Closure Rule of 1887.]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty that had been felt in using the procedure was avoided by\r\nthe adoption in 1887 of a new standing order[295:2] transferring the\r\ninitiative to the members of the House, while securing fair play to\r\nminorities by leaving with the Speaker a power of veto. The rule\r\nprovides that any member may claim to move that the question pending be\r\nnow put, \"and unless it shall appear to the chair that such motion is an\r\nabuse of the rules of the House, or an infringement of the rights of the\r\nminority,\" it shall be put forthwith. If carried, the pending question,\r\nand following it the main question before the House, with all others\r\ndepending upon it, must be put without further amendment or\r\ndebate.[295:3] The process, now entitled for the first time \"closure,\"\r\nwas modified in 1888, so that the only requirement about the size of\r\nthe majority was that one hundred votes must be cast in the affirmative.\r\nIn this form it has ever since remained, and it has been freely used,\r\nhaving been actually applied from one score to four score times each\r\nyear.[296:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Speaker's Consent.]\r\n\r\nThe requirement of the Speaker's assent has proved to be no mere\r\nformality. This is especially true where closure has been moved by\r\nprivate members, for his consent, or that of the Chairman of Committees,\r\nhas been refused in one third of such cases.[296:2] Largely for that\r\nreason, no doubt, the use of closure by private members has become far\r\nless common than it was formerly. During the first ten years after 1887\r\nit was moved by private members on the average about forty times a year,\r\nbut since that period the average has been only twelve. Even in the case\r\nof motions made by a minister, consent has often been withheld. It\r\nhappened very frequently during the earlier years, but of late has been\r\nmuch less common.[296:3] Evidently the Treasury Bench and the Speaker\r\nhave come to adopt very nearly the same standard for determining when a\r\nmatter has been sufficiently debated. To a spectator in the gallery the\r\ndiscussion seems to proceed until the House must be thoroughly weary of\r\nit before closure is moved; and, indeed, the House itself very rarely\r\nrejects the motion when it gets a chance to vote upon it--a fact which\r\nshows that if the Speaker had not power to withhold his consent, the\r\nmajority would cut short debate more drastically than it does now. But\r\nalthough debate may have gone on until the House is weary, and the\r\nbenches are nearly empty, until the speeches consist mainly of the\r\nreiteration of arguments in less incisive form, yet there are almost\r\nalways members who are longing in vain for a chance to make a few\r\nremarks. In great debates the order of the chief speakers on each side\r\nis commonly arranged between the whips, and given to the presiding\r\nofficer; who usually follows it, though not without occasional\r\nexceptions. For the rest he gives the preference, among the members who\r\ntry to catch his eye, to those who have the ear of the House, or who are\r\nlikely to say something worth hearing, not forgetting to call on a new\r\nman who rises to make his maiden speech. By seizing on the dull hours,\r\nwhen the House is not full, an undistinguished member can often get his\r\nchance. Still, there are many men who sit impatiently with what they\r\nbelieve to be effective little speeches ready to be fired off upon an\r\nappreciative public, and see their chance slipping away.[297:1] Perhaps\r\nthey are bores, but on them the closure falls as a blight, and they\r\nraise the bitter cry of the curtailment of the rights of private\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Closure at the End of a Sitting.]\r\n\r\nThe closure can be moved at any time, even when a member is speaking,\r\nbut perhaps its most effective use is at the close of the sitting. A\r\nstanding order adopted in 1888 provides[297:2] that when the hour\r\narrives for the cessation of debate--technically known as the\r\ninterruption of business,--the closure may be moved upon the main\r\nquestion under consideration, with all others dependent upon it. This\r\ngives an opportunity of finishing a bit of work without appearing to cut\r\noff discussion arbitrarily, and it is especially valuable now that the\r\nnew rules of 1902 have established on four days of the week[297:3] two\r\nregular sittings with an interruption at the end of each.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Guillotine.]\r\n\r\nWhile the closure is effective in bringing to an end debate on a single\r\nquestion, or in getting past some one particularly difficult point in\r\nthe career of a bill, it is quite inadequate for passing a great,\r\ncomplicated government measure that provokes relentless opposition. Here\r\nit is as useless as the sword of Hercules against the Hydra. Amendments\r\nbristle by the score at every clause, and spring up faster than they can\r\nbe cut off. The motion that certain words \"stand part of a clause,\" or\r\nthat a \"clause stand part of the bill,\" was intended to work like the\r\nhero's hot iron, because if the motion is adopted no amendment can\r\nafterward be moved to that word or that clause. But in practice such\r\nmotions cannot be used ruthlessly. The government discovered the\r\ninsufficiency of the closure under the Standing Order of 1887, during\r\nthe debates on the very bill whose enactment it had been adopted to\r\nsecure, and resorted to a procedure which had already been used by Mr.\r\nGladstone on a couple of Irish coercion bills in 1881.[298:1] Five days\r\nhad been consumed on the first reading of the Irish Crimes Act of 1887,\r\nseven on the second reading, and fifteen days more had been spent in\r\nCommittee of the Whole on four out of the twenty clauses of the bill;\r\nwhen the government moved that at ten o'clock on June 17, being the end\r\nof the next week, the Chairman should, without further debate, put all\r\nquestions necessary to bring the committee stage to an end.[298:2] The\r\nmotion was adopted, and from its trenchant operation the process was\r\nknown as the \"guillotine.\" It served its purpose, but from the point of\r\nview of parliamentary deliberation it was a very imperfect instrument,\r\nfor all the clauses after the sixth were put to vote without amendment\r\nor debate.[299:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Closure by Compartments.]\r\n\r\nThe defect of the guillotine, that it resulted in needlessly long\r\ndiscussions on a few early clauses, to the entire neglect of the rest,\r\nwas largely remedied in the case of the Home Rule Bill of 1893. After\r\ntwenty-eight nights had been spent in committee on the first four\r\nclauses, the House, on June 30, adopted a resolution that debate on\r\nclauses five to eight should close on July 6, on clauses nine to\r\ntwenty-six on July 13, on clauses twenty-seven to forty on July 20, and\r\non the postponed and new clauses on July 27.[299:2] This form of\r\nprocedure, sometimes called closure by compartments, has the merit of\r\ndistributing the discussion over different parts of the measure, and of\r\naffording at least a probability that any provision exciting general\r\ninterest will receive some measure of attention. It was used again on\r\nthe Evicted Tenants Bill in 1894,[299:3] and the Education Bill in\r\n1902;[299:4] and may now be said to have become a regular, because a\r\nnecessary, practice in the case of difficult and hotly contested\r\nmeasures. But save in the case of supply, it has been the subject of a\r\nspecial resolution passed for a particular bill, under what have been\r\ntreated as exceptional conditions, and it has found no mention in the\r\nstanding orders.[299:5]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Closure of Supply.]\r\n\r\nThe guillotine has been applied more systematically to supply. Formerly\r\nthe estimates were taken in their order, with the result that much time\r\nwas wasted early in the session over trivial matters, like the repairs\r\nof royal palaces in Class I.; while great appropriations of important\r\ndepartments were rushed through at the fag end of the session.[300:1]\r\nBut at the instance of Mr. Balfour a sessional order was passed in 1896\r\nallowing in that session twenty days for supply, with a provision for\r\ntaking a vote, without further debate, on every grant left when the days\r\nexpired, the time allowed being, he thought, about the average amount\r\nheretofore devoted to the subject.[300:2] As the grants in supply,\r\nunlike the clauses of a bill, can be brought before the House in any\r\norder that the minister may choose, there was not the same need of a\r\nclosure by compartments; but in order to remove any fear that the\r\ngovernment might hold back certain appropriations, Mr. Balfour said that\r\nthe important grants, and those which any group of members wanted to\r\ndiscuss, would be taken first.[300:3] The resolution was renewed from\r\nyear to year[300:4] until by the new rules of 1902 it was permanently\r\nembodied in the standing orders.[300:5]\r\n\r\nAs the rule now stands, twenty days,[300:6] all to come before Aug. 5,\r\nare allotted for the consideration of the estimates,[300:7] and on the\r\ndays so allotted no other business can be taken before midnight.[300:8]\r\nAt ten o'clock on the last day but one the Chairman must put to vote\r\nevery question needed to dispose of the grant under consideration; and\r\nthen put in succession all the outstanding grants by classes, those in\r\neach class being taken together and put as a single question. At ten\r\no'clock on the last day the Speaker follows the same process for closing\r\nthe report stage of the estimates.\r\n\r\nThe real object of the debates in supply at the present day is not\r\nfinancial discussion, but criticism of the administration of the\r\ndepartments, their work being brought under review as their estimates\r\nare considered.[301:1] In that light the new procedure has worked very\r\nwell. Complaint has been made that the government no longer cares what\r\ngrants are brought forward for debate--leaving that to the\r\nOpposition,--or how long the discussion upon them may take, or whether\r\nit ends with a vote upon them or not, knowing very well that all these\r\ngrants must be adopted under closure when the twenty days expire.[301:2]\r\nThis is perfectly true; but on the other hand the procedure gives the\r\nfullest opportunity for criticising the administration, and forcing a\r\ndiscussion of grievances, the matters to be criticised being selected by\r\nthe critics themselves. Although the Opposition, as in duty bound,\r\nresisted the adoption of some portions of the rule, it may be safely\r\nsaid that the rule itself will not be repealed by any government that\r\nmay come to power.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[292:1] Lecky attributed what he called \"the enormous and portentous\r\ndevelopment of parliamentary speaking\" partly to the scenes of violence\r\nand obstruction, which have weakened both the respect for the House and\r\nthe timidity that imposed a restraint on idle speech; partly to the\r\ngrowth of the provincial press which reports members in full in their\r\nown constituencies; and partly to the vast increase in stump oratory\r\nwhich has given nearly all members a fatal facility. (\"Democracy and\r\nLiberty,\" I., 146-47.)

This process was, indeed,\r\nemployed by Mr. Gladstone to pass two Irish bills in that very session.\r\n\r\n[295:1] A number of new rules were added at this time, and the standing\r\norders were rearranged and put into their present sequence. Com. Papers,\r\n1882, LII., 139, 243. The standing order on this subject became No. 14.\r\n\r\n[295:2] The Standing Order of 1882 was not repealed until 1888.\r\n\r\n[295:3] In the same way a motion may be made to put forthwith the\r\nquestion that certain words stand part of a clause, or that a clause\r\nstand part of the bill, and this cuts off summarily all amendments to\r\nthose words or that clause. These standing orders are now Nos. 26 and\r\n27.\r\n\r\n[296:1] Owing partly to the extension of an automatic form of closure,\r\nto be explained hereafter, the applications in 1903 fell to thirteen.\r\n\r\n[296:2] From 1887 to 1905, inclusive, the closure was moved by private\r\nmembers 517 times, and consent was refused in 178 of these cases. The\r\nproportion of refusals is almost uniform throughout the period, rather\r\nincreasing during the last few years.\r\n\r\nClosure has failed for lack of 100 affirmative votes only once in the\r\nlast ten years. That was in 1905.\r\n\r\n[296:3] From 1887 to 1896, inclusive, the closure was moved by the\r\ngovernment 313 times, and consent was withheld in 52 of these cases.\r\nFrom 1897 to 1905 it was so moved 338 times, but consent was withheld\r\nonly 23 times.\r\n\r\n[297:1] _Cf._ Palgrave, \"The House of Commons,\" Ed. of 1878, 41-42.\r\n\r\n[297:2] Now S.O. 1 (4).\r\n\r\n[297:3] It is commonly stated that closure cannot be used in a standing\r\ncommittee, (Ilbert, \"Manual,\" Secs. 80, note, 135 note); but it was done\r\non July 12, 1901, in the Standing Committee on Law; and although the\r\npersons aggrieved stated that they should bring the matter to the\r\nattention of the House, they did not feel confidence enough in their\r\ncase to do so. (See _The Times_, July 17, 1901, and the Political Notes\r\nin the number for July 13. Curiously enough the incident is not\r\nmentioned in the report of the meeting of the committee in that number.)\r\nFor other statements of its use in a standing committee, _cf._ 2d Rep.\r\nof Sel. Com. on House of Commons (Procedure), May 25, 1906, Qs. 418,\r\n420.\r\n\r\nSince this was written closure in standing committees has been\r\nsanctioned by a change in the standing orders; twenty affirmative votes\r\nbeing required.\r\n\r\n[298:1] After giving notice of his intention to do so, he moved, on Feb.\r\n21, 1881, that all clauses and amendments of the Protection of Life and\r\nProperty (Ireland) Bill should be put to vote in Committee of the Whole\r\nat twelve o'clock that night. This was done, and repeated upon the\r\nreport stage of the bill (Hans. 3 Ser. CCLVIII., 1092, 1344, 1392, 1472,\r\n1608, 1665, 1672-75). The same process was adopted a few days later for\r\nthe Peace Preservation (Ireland) Bill. (Hans. 3 Ser. CCLIX., 657, 659,\r\n691-95,697, 740, 762-65.)\r\n\r\n[298:2] Hans. 3 Ser.

As the number of such grants is usually little short\r\nof one hundred, the time wasted in walking through the lobbies on the\r\nlast night might be monstrous. To avoid this a rule was adopted in 1901\r\nthat when the allotted time expired, all the remaining grants in any one\r\nclass should be put to vote together. Hans. 4 Ser.

Days devoted to supplementary\r\nestimates or votes of credit are not included; nor are those days on\r\nwhich the question must be put that the Speaker leave the chair, because\r\nthose days are really occupied not by the votes of supply, but by\r\ngeneral criticism of the government.

On\r\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday the House now meets at a\r\nquarter before three, and sits until half-past eleven, when it is\r\nautomatically adjourned unless business specially exempted is under\r\nconsideration. But the sitting is divided by the mystic hour of a\r\nquarter past eight into two parts which are reserved on certain days for\r\nquite different kinds of business. On Friday the House sits from noon\r\ntill half-past five, and on Saturday it does not meet at all unless by\r\nspecial vote on very rare occasions.[302:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interruption of Business.]\r\n\r\nWith the exception to be noted in a moment, all business upon which the\r\nHouse may be engaged is interrupted at half-past five o'clock on Friday,\r\nand eleven on other days; but unopposed business may still be taken up\r\nuntil the hour arrives for adjournment. During that interval the orders\r\nof the day are read, and each of them may in turn be debated and even\r\nvoted upon, unless a division is challenged, or some member\r\nobjects.[303:1] In short, work can be done after the time for\r\ninterruption only by universal consent, a single member having power to\r\nprevent the consideration of any measure to which he is opposed. Yet a\r\ncertain amount of business is transacted at these times; and, in fact, a\r\nprivate member's bill would stand little chance, even if no one had any\r\nserious objection to it, unless it could pass through some of its stages\r\nin this way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Exceptions Thereto.]\r\n\r\nTo the rule that no opposed business can be taken after eleven o'clock\r\nthere is an important exception. A minister may move at the beginning of\r\nthe afternoon sitting that any specified business shall not be\r\ninterrupted at that hour, and the question must be put without amendment\r\nor debate. This is often done toward the close of the session, and\r\nresults in sittings that run far into the night. Bills originating in\r\nCommittee of Ways and Means, and proceedings taken in pursuance of a\r\nstatute[304:1] or standing order, are also exempted from the rules about\r\ninterruption, about taking up no opposed business after eleven o'clock,\r\nand about adjournment at half-past eleven o'clock.[304:2] It must be\r\nremembered also that closure may be moved after the hour for\r\ninterruption has struck.[304:3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Order of Business for the Day.]\r\n\r\nThe first sitting of each day is opened with prayer. The Speaker then\r\ntakes the chair, and certain formal or routine business that occupies\r\nlittle time is taken up in the following order.\r\n\r\n1. Private business, that is, bills relating to private or local\r\nmatters. Private business, which is unopposed, and therefore takes no\r\nappreciable time, is taken up first. Opposed private business is not\r\ntaken up at all on Friday, and if not finished by three o'clock on other\r\ndays is postponed to a quarter past eight on such day as the Chairman of\r\nWays and Means may determine.[304:4]\r\n\r\n2. Presentation of public petitions (if presented orally instead of\r\nbeing dropped silently into a bag behind the Speaker's chair). As a rule\r\nno debate is in order, and hence this process is also short,[304:5] and\r\nmust be finished by three o'clock.[304:6]\r\n\r\n3. At that hour, on the afternoon sittings, the important business of\r\nputting questions to ministers begins.[305:1] The character and\r\npolitical effect of these questions will be examined in Chapter XVIII,\r\nbut from the point of view of parliamentary time it may be noted that\r\nthe practice has grown so much during the last thirty years as to\r\nrequire some limitation. In 1901 the questions asked numbered 7180, and\r\nconsumed 119 hours, or the equivalent of fifteen parliamentary days of\r\neight hours each.[305:2] The new rules of 1902 sought to check the\r\ntendency in two ways; by giving the option of requiring an oral or a\r\nwritten answer, the question in the former case being marked in the\r\nnotice paper with an asterisk; and by fixing a strict limit to the time\r\nconsumed. Forty minutes are allowed for putting questions, the answers\r\nto those not reached by a quarter before four, like the answers to\r\nquestions not starred, being printed with the votes of the day.[305:3]\r\n\r\n4. If there is a vacant moment before three o'clock, or between the time\r\nquestions come to an end and a quarter before four o'clock, it may be\r\nused by motions for unopposed returns, for leave of absence, or for\r\nsimilar unopposed matters that would otherwise have to be taken up after\r\nthe interruption of business.[305:4]\r\n\r\n5. Immediately after questions, a member rising in his place may make\r\nthe portentous motion \"for the adjournment of the House for the purpose\r\nof discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance.\"[305:5]\r\nThis is usually, but not necessarily, made in consequence of a highly\r\nunsatisfactory answer that has just been given to a question. It may\r\nseem strange to move to adjourn before serious business has begun, but\r\nas such a motion has not been carried for nearly a score of years that\r\nfeature is unimportant, and its real significance in giving a chance to\r\ndiscuss at short notice some action of the government will be explained\r\nin Chapter XVIII. Formerly the debate upon the motion took place\r\nimmediately; but now the member merely obtains--by the support of forty\r\nmembers, or by vote of the House--leave to make his motion, while the\r\ndebate itself is postponed to a quarter past eight o'clock.\r\n\r\n6. Then come what are called \"matters taken at the commencement of\r\npublic business.\" These are the presentation of bills without an order\r\nof the House or under the ten-minute rule, and motions by a minister\r\nrelating to the conduct of business to be decided without amendment or\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n7. Finally comes the regular business of the sitting, in the form of\r\nnotices of motions or orders of the day. The distinction between these\r\ntwo classes of business is not easy to explain with precision;[306:1]\r\nbut for our purpose it is unimportant, except so far as one class has\r\nprecedence over the other. Now the government has authority to arrange\r\nthe order of its own business as it pleases;[306:2] and in relation to\r\nprivate members, orders of the day practically mean bills, and notices\r\nof motion mean resolutions and other matters that are not bills. The\r\napplication of the distinction comes, therefore, to this, that of the\r\nsittings set apart for private members, Friday is reserved for their\r\nbills, and Tuesdays and Wednesdays after a quarter past eight o'clock\r\nfor their other motions.[306:3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Order at Evening Sittings.]\r\n\r\nAt a quarter past eight o'clock the first business is a motion for\r\nadjournment on an urgent matter of public business, in the occasional\r\ninstances where leave has been obtained at the afternoon sitting to make\r\nit. Next follows any postponed private business that may have been\r\nassigned to that evening; and then come the notices of motions and\r\norders of the day.\r\n\r\nBy the new arrangement with its definite time for certain business, the\r\nwork of the House is better distributed. There is no longer the same\r\ndanger that the discussion of a private bill or of a motion to adjourn,\r\nor an interminable series of questions, will unexpectedly cut a great\r\npiece out of the hours when the House is most crowded, and the leading\r\nmen are waiting to debate a great public measure. At the afternoon\r\nsitting the regular business of the day is reached at a quarter before\r\nfour, or very little later, and it proceeds without interruption until a\r\nquarter before eight. After that hour--unless there is an opposed\r\nprivate bill, which does not often take long, or by chance a motion to\r\nadjourn--the regular business, which may not be the same as at the\r\nafternoon sitting, begins again, and goes on until eleven. With the\r\nhabits of slack attendance when nothing is expected, and the necessity\r\nfor a presence in force when a division that touches the Treasury Bench\r\nmay be taken, it is a matter of no small import to be able to forecast\r\nthe business of a sitting.\r\n\r\nThe severe pressure for time has thus brought about a minute allotment\r\nof the hours at each sitting for definite kinds of business, and the\r\nsame cause has produced a similar, although less exact, distribution in\r\nthe work of the session as a whole.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Order of Business for the Session.]\r\n\r\nThe regular session of Parliament opens about the beginning of February,\r\nand the first business is the address in reply to the King's speech.\r\nFormerly it was an elaborate affair, which referred to the clauses of\r\nthe speech in succession, but since 1890 it has taken the form of a\r\nsingle resolution expressing simply the thanks of the Commons for his\r\nMajesty's most gracious speech. Amendments are moved by the various\r\nsections of the Opposition in the shape of additions thereto, pointing\r\nout how the government has done things it ought not to have done, and\r\nleft undone things it ought to have done; and even members of the\r\nmajority, who are disgruntled because their pet hobbies have been left\r\nunnoticed, follow the same course. The debates on the address take\r\npractically the whole time of the House for two or three weeks.[308:1]\r\nAs soon as they are over, the Committee of Supply is set up, and sits\r\none or two days each week, the rest of the sittings being taken up with\r\ngovernment measures, and with business introduced by private members.\r\n\r\nHope springs eternal in the legislative breast, and every assembly\r\nundertakes more work than it can accomplish thoroughly. In some\r\nlegislatures this results in a headlong rushing through of measures\r\nalmost without discussion at the end of the session. But while, under\r\nclosure by compartments and the supply rule, this may be true in England\r\nof certain clauses of bills and of large parts of the appropriations, it\r\nis not true of bills as a whole. Parliament is, primarily, a forum for\r\ndebate, rather than a machine for legislation, and bills that cannot be\r\ndiscussed at some length are dropped. After the Whitsuntide recess every\r\nyear, the leader of the House announces that owing to lack of time the\r\ngovernment has found it necessary to abandon such and such measures, a\r\nproceeding familiarly known as the slaughter of the innocents. But it is\r\nnot their own bills alone that the ministers are obliged to slay. In\r\norder to get through their own remaining work they have long been in the\r\nhabit of taking by special order, after the Easter recess, a part of the\r\nsittings reserved for private members, and of seizing all the rest soon\r\nafter Whitsuntide. The practice was regulated and made systematic by the\r\nnew rules of 1902; but this brings us to the relation of the cabinet and\r\nof private members to the work of the House, which forms the subject of\r\nthe following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[302:1] Until 1888 the regular hour of meeting on Monday, Tuesday,\r\nThursday, and Friday was a quarter before four o'clock; but as there was\r\nno provision for adjournment at any fixed hour, debate on a subject\r\nmight go on indefinitely; and, in fact, all-night sittings were common.\r\nIn 1879 a standing order had been adopted that no opposed business, not\r\nspecially exempted, should be taken up after half-past twelve; but this\r\ndid not put a stop to a business in hand at that hour. Owing to the\r\nfatigue caused by late sittings (Temple, \"Life in Parliament,\" 184-85),\r\na standing order was adopted in 1888 changing the hour of meeting on\r\nthose four days to three o'clock, and providing that at midnight the\r\nbusiness under consideration should, unless specially exempted, be\r\ninterrupted; that no other opposed business should thereafter be taken\r\nup; and that the House should adjourn not later than one o'clock. The\r\nhours of sitting on Wednesday were left as before at from noon to six\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\nFor some time it had been the habit, especially in the latter part of\r\nthe session, to break the day occasionally into two sittings, the\r\nearlier one beginning at two o'clock, and being called a morning\r\nsitting. After 1888 these two sittings were held from two until seven,\r\nand from nine until twelve (S.O. of March 7, 1888), the days being\r\ncommonly Tuesdays and Fridays.\r\n\r\nNow although the system of two sittings a day, with a considerable\r\ninterval for dinner, involved beginning at an hour in the afternoon\r\ninconveniently early for men in the active work of a business or\r\nprofession, it had certain manifest advantages, and was made the\r\nuniversal practice in 1902. At that time the standing orders were\r\nextensively revised, and in particular the subject of the sittings, with\r\nthe order of business thereat, was remodelled. For the sake of giving\r\nmembers a chance to pass what is known as the week-end in the country,\r\nthe short day was transferred from Wednesday to Friday, the House\r\nmeeting on that day at twelve, and adjourning automatically at six (S.O.\r\n2); while each of the other four working days was divided into afternoon\r\nand evening sittings, the first from two until half-past seven, and the\r\nother from nine until one (S.O. 1). Finally in 1906 another change of\r\nhours was made, without, however, any essential alteration in the method\r\nof doing business. The inconvenience of early attendance at the House\r\nwas avoided by changing the hour of meeting on Monday, Tuesday,\r\nWednesday, and Thursday to quarter before three, while the hour for the\r\nadjournment was changed to half-past eleven, and a part of the time then\r\nlost was made up by abolishing the formal interval of an hour and a half\r\nfor dinner. But although there is now one continuous sitting on each of\r\nthese days, the order of business arranged for the two sittings has been\r\nretained, the break coming at a quarter past eight. The hour of\r\nadjournment on Friday was changed at the same time to half-past five.\r\n\r\n[303:1] May, 209. Business which is merely formal, or which follows as\r\nof course from action already taken by the House, may be transacted in\r\nspite of objection. May, 210.\r\n\r\n[304:1] Under this head is included action upon statutory orders, where\r\nthe act provides, as it usually does, that the order shall be laid\r\nbefore Parliament, and shall not go into effect if either House adopts\r\nan address with that object. Without this exception to the rule the\r\nHouse would have no real opportunity to adopt such an address, unless\r\nthe government chose to give part of its time for the purpose.

S.O.\r\n9 (3).\r\n\r\n[305:4] In practice a motion for a new writ of election is usually made\r\nbefore questions, and the introduction of a new member follows them.\r\nIlbert, Sec. 47 note.\r\n\r\n[305:5] S.O. 10.\r\n\r\n[306:1] Ilbert, Sec. 41 note. Technically an order of the day is a\r\nmatter which is set down for a particular day by an order of the House;\r\na notice of motion is a motion set down for the day by notice given by a\r\nmember without any order of the House; but under the present rules an\r\norder of the House is made in many cases without any actual vote, or\r\neven the opportunity for a vote, the proceedings being in fact much the\r\nsame as in the case of a notice of motion. The distinction remains,\r\nhowever, as a means of classifying different kinds of business.\r\n\r\n[306:2] S.O. 5.\r\n\r\n[306:3] S.O. 4.\r\n\r\n[308:1] As Redlich remarks (_Recht und Technik_, 315-16), the speech\r\nhaving a general political character, debate and amendment are not\r\nlimited by any rule of relevancy, but stray over every kind of political\r\ngrievance or aspiration and the whole foreign and domestic policy of the\r\ngovernment. He points out that until 1880 the debate rarely took more\r\nthan a couple of days, but since that time the number of sittings\r\ndevoted to it has run from six to sixteen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE CABINET'S CONTROL OF THE COMMONS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Body of Men can say only Yes or No.]\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of collective action every body of men is in the plight\r\nof M. Noirtier de Villefort in \"Monte Cristo,\" who was completely\r\nparalysed except for one eye. Like him it has only a single faculty,\r\nthat of saying Yes or No. Individually the members may express the most\r\ninvolved opinions, the most complex and divergent sentiments, but when\r\nit comes to voting, the body can vote only Yes or No. Some one makes a\r\nmotion, some one else moves an amendment, perhaps other amendments are\r\nsuperimposed, but on each amendment in turn, and finally on the main\r\nquestion, the body simply votes for or against. Where a body acts by\r\nplurality it can, of course, choose which of several propositions it\r\nwill adopt, which of several persons, for example, it will elect.[309:1]\r\nBut this depends upon the same general principle, that the body can act\r\ncollectively only on propositions laid before it by an individual, or a\r\ngroup of men acting together as an individual. Ordinarily it can only\r\nanswer Yes or No to questions laid before it one at a time in that way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Framing the Question.]\r\n\r\nObviously, therefore, it is of vital importance to know who has power to\r\nask the question; and, in fact, one of the great arts in managing bodies\r\nof men consists in so framing questions as to get the best possible\r\nchance of a favourable reply. In small bodies that have limited\r\nfunctions and an abundance of time, the members are free to propose any\r\nquestions they please; but in large assemblies, all of whose proceedings\r\nare of necessity slower, this freedom is curtailed by lack of time,\r\nespecially if the range of activities is wide. Hence the legislatures of\r\nall great states have been constrained to adopt some process for\r\nrestricting or sifting the proposals or bills of their members. The most\r\ncommon device is that of referring the bills to committees, which can\r\npractically eliminate those that have no serious chance of success, and\r\ncan amend others, putting them into a more acceptable form. In such\r\ncases the committees enjoy, if not the exclusive privilege of proposing\r\nquestions to the legislature, at least the primary right of framing the\r\nquestions that are to be submitted, and this gives them a momentous\r\npower. An organisation by committees is the most natural evolution of a\r\nlegislative body, if there is nothing to obstruct it. Now in Parliament\r\nthere has been something to obstruct it, and that is the system of a\r\nresponsible ministry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cabinet.]\r\n\r\nThe cabinet has been said to be a committee, and the most important\r\ncommittee of the House; but it is really far more. Unlike an ordinary\r\ncommittee, it does not have the bills of members referred to it. On the\r\ncontrary it has the sole right to initiate, as well as to frame, the\r\nmeasures it submits to the House; and these comprise, in fact, almost\r\nall the important bills that are enacted. By far the greater part of\r\nlegislation originates, therefore, exclusively with the ministers. The\r\nsystem of a responsible ministry has obstructed the growth of\r\ncommittees; because, in the case of government measures, the chief\r\nfunction of such committees, that of sifting bills and putting them into\r\nproper shape, is performed by the cabinet itself; and also because, as\r\nwill be shown hereafter, the authority of the cabinet would be weakened\r\nif other bodies, not necessarily in accord with it, had power to modify\r\nits proposals. In this connection it may be observed that in the domain\r\nof private and local bills, where the responsibility of the cabinet\r\ndoes not extend, there has developed a most elaborate and complete set\r\nof committees, to which all such bills are referred.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Subjects Treated in this Chapter.]\r\n\r\nThe relation of the cabinet to the House of Commons may be conveniently\r\ntreated under three heads: the initiative left to private members; the\r\ndirect control of the cabinet over legislation with its effects; and the\r\ncontrol of the House over the administration and the general policy of\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Private Members' Bills.]\r\n\r\nIt may appear strange that the existence of a responsible ministry\r\nshould obstruct the growth of committees on public bills brought in by\r\nprivate members. Nevertheless it has done so; partly by reducing those\r\nbills to a position of secondary importance; and partly because if the\r\ncommittees were under the control of the government the private member\r\nwould be even more helpless than he is now, and if they were not they\r\nmight be at times inconvenient rivals to the ministry. As the House of\r\nCommons is organised, therefore, the committees play a minor part. The\r\nmost important legislation of a public nature originates with the\r\nministers, and is entirely in their charge, save for an occasional\r\nreference to a committee under exceptional circumstances; while private\r\nmembers are free to bring their public bills before the House,\r\nunfettered by any committee, provided they can find a chance to do so in\r\nthe extremely meagre allowance of time at their disposal. In short the\r\nCommons have solved the question of time by giving most of it to the\r\ngovernment to use as it pleases, and leaving the private members to\r\nscramble for the rest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Time Allotted to Private Members.]\r\n\r\nUnder the new rules of 1902 and 1906 government business has precedence,\r\nfrom the opening of the session until Easter, at every sitting, except\r\nafter a quarter past eight o'clock on Tuesday and Wednesday and at the\r\nsitting on Friday. Until Easter, therefore, these three periods in the\r\nweek are reserved for the private members. Between Easter and\r\nWhitsuntide the government is given the whole of Tuesday for its own\r\nuse, and after Whitsuntide it has all the time except the third and\r\nfourth Fridays next following.[312:1] As the private members have no\r\ntime reserved for them until the close of the debate on the address, the\r\narrangement gives them in a normal year about thirty parts of the\r\nsession out of a couple of hundred. It must be remembered also that the\r\npart of a sitting after quarter past eight is shorter than that which\r\ngoes before; is never, on private members' nights, prolonged beyond the\r\nhour of interruption; and is liable to be broken into by opposed private\r\nbills, and motions to adjourn on a matter of urgent public\r\nimportance.[312:2] It is clear, therefore, that the share of time\r\nreserved for private members is small. But although their lamentations\r\nover confiscation of their sittings by the government have been\r\nconstant, the actual time at their disposal has not, in fact, been\r\nseriously diminished of late years. An examination of the parliamentary\r\npapers shows that in the ten years from 1878 to 1887 government business\r\nactually had precedence on the average in eighty-three per cent. of the\r\nsittings, and during the following decade in about eighty-four and a\r\nhalf per cent.[312:3] This is very little less than the proportion that\r\nnow prevails. The recent rules have merely sanctioned by permanent\r\nstanding order a practice that had long been followed in an irregular\r\nway by special resolutions adopted during the course of the session.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ballot for Days.]\r\n\r\nWhen, as Hobbes remarked, there is not enough of any article to satisfy\r\neverybody, and no one has authority to apportion it, the most obvious\r\nmeans of distribution is the lot. This primitive method is still\r\nemployed for dividing among the private members the time reserved for\r\ntheir use. Their sittings are devoted to two different objects. On\r\nTuesday and Wednesday evenings notices of motions have precedence, while\r\nFriday is the day for bills. At the beginning of a session members who\r\nwant to introduce bills send in their names, and in the order in which\r\nthe lots are drawn they set down their bills for second reading on a\r\nFriday, selecting, of course, the earliest unoccupied day. In this way\r\nevery Friday before Whitsuntide is taken, and although there will\r\nprobably not be time to deal with more than one bill in a day, less\r\nsuccessful competitors place their measures second or third on the\r\nlists, hoping that they may be reached.\r\n\r\nThe first bill on the list usually comes to a vote on the second\r\nreading, but when that point has been passed it is difficult to find an\r\nopportunity for any of its subsequent steps. A reference to a standing\r\ncommittee affords the best chance, because it avoids the committee stage\r\nin the House. If a bill is not so referred, it is almost certainly\r\ndoomed, unless it can pass some of its stages, unopposed, after the hour\r\nfor the interruption of business; and, in fact, any bill is well-nigh\r\nhopeless that does not take at least one step in this way.[313:1] On the\r\ntwo Fridays remaining after Whitsuntide private members' bills are given\r\nprecedence in the order of their progress,[313:2] the most advanced\r\nobtaining the right of way. The leader of the House may, however, star\r\nany bill, that is, give to it a fraction of the government time, but\r\nthis is very rarely done, and never till near the close of a session.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Insignificance of Private Members' Legislation.]\r\n\r\nAs there are only about a dozen Fridays before Whitsuntide, a private\r\nmember must be very fortunate in the ballot, or he must have a number of\r\nfriends interested in the same bill, to get it started with any prospect\r\nof success; and even then there is scarcely a hope of carrying it\r\nthrough if a single member opposes it persistently at every point. Ten\r\nor fifteen such bills are enacted a year, and of these only a couple\r\nprovoke enough difference of opinion to lead to a division during their\r\ncourse in the House.[314:1] But while many private members loudly bewail\r\ntheir wrongs, they make no organised effort for mutual protection. These\r\nmen are, in fact, separate units without a basis for combination. They\r\nhave not even that spirit of the golden rule, which does much harm in\r\nlegislation. They show neither the good nature, nor the instinct for\r\nlog-rolling, which prompts men to vote for one another's bills, hoping\r\nfor like favours in return. Hence their labours produce little fruit,\r\neither sweet or bitter. In short, the public legislation initiated by\r\nprivate members is neither large in amount, nor important in character,\r\nand it cannot be passed against serious opposition,--a condition that\r\ntends to become more marked as time goes on.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Private Members' Motions.]\r\n\r\nThe privilege on the part of private members of bringing forward motions\r\non Tuesday or Wednesday evenings is, like that of having bills\r\nconsidered on Friday, determined by lot; with this difference, that a\r\nnotice of motion cannot be given more than four motion days ahead, and\r\nhence the first ballot covers only two weeks, and is followed by fresh\r\nballoting every week until Easter.[314:2] In order to improve the chance\r\nof getting a hearing, a number of members interested in the same\r\nquestion will often send in their names, with the understanding that any\r\none of them who is lucky enough to be drawn shall set down the motion.\r\nThis practice was introduced by the Irishmen; but it has now become\r\ncommon among members of all kinds who take, or wish to appear to take,\r\nan interest in a subject. It is called \"syndicating,\" and has resulted\r\nin making the motions not infrequently reflect the views of a\r\nconsiderable section of the House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Nature and Effect.]\r\n\r\nThe motions on these nights take the form of resolutions, and are of\r\nevery kind. Some of them express aspirations of an abstract nature, such\r\nas that the government ought to encourage cotton-growing in the British\r\ncolonies, or that the greater part of the cost of training teachers\r\nought to be borne by the national exchequer.[315:1] Others demand more\r\ndefinite legislation about matters on which the parties are not prepared\r\nto take sides. A motion, for example, was carried in 1904 that the\r\nfranchise for members of Parliament ought to be extended to women. But a\r\nresolution adopted in that way, without opposition from the government,\r\nis commonly regarded as a mere aspiration, and has hardly a perceptible\r\neffect. Others again deal with the hobbies of individuals, and in that\r\ncase the members are apt to go home, so that after an hour or two of\r\ndesultory talk the House is counted out for lack of a quorum; the\r\nfrequency with which that occurs depending, of course, upon the amount\r\nof general interest attaching to the motions that happen to appear on\r\nthe list.[315:2] Finally there are motions which attack the cabinet or\r\nits policy, motions, for example, condemning preferential tariffs on\r\nfood, or the control by the central government of the police in Ireland.\r\nMotions of that sort are, of course, strenuously resisted by the\r\nTreasury Bench, and they will be discussed hereafter when we come to the\r\nmethods of criticising the action of the ministry.[315:3] Apart from\r\ncases of this last class, the motions of private members have even less\r\npractical importance than their bills. Occasionally a real popular\r\ndemand may find expression in that way, but it is uncommon, and the\r\nchief value of the Tuesday and Wednesday evening sittings would seem to\r\nlie in helping to keep alive the salutary fiction that members of\r\nParliament still possess a substantial power of independent action.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Control of the Cabinet over Legislation.]\r\n\r\nAll the sittings not reserved for private members are at the disposal of\r\nthe government, and it can arrange the order of its business as it\r\nthinks best.[316:1] The responsibility of the ministers for legislation\r\nis a comparatively recent matter.[316:2] Before the Reform Act of 1832\r\ntheir functions were chiefly executive; but the rapid demand for great\r\nremedial measures, and later the complexity of legislation due to the\r\nextended control and supervision by the administrative departments, and\r\nnot least the concentration of power in the cabinet by the growth of the\r\nparliamentary system, brought about a change. By the middle of the\r\ncentury that change was recognised, and at the present day the ministers\r\nwould treat the rejection of any of their important measures as\r\nequivalent to a vote of want of confidence.[316:3]\r\n\r\nMoreover, the government is responsible not only for introducing a bill,\r\nbut also for failing to do so. At a meeting in the autumn the cabinet\r\ndecides upon the measures it intends to bring forward, and announces\r\nthem in the King's speech at the opening of the session. Amendments to\r\nthe address in reply are moved expressing regret that His Majesty has\r\nnot referred to some measure that is desired, and if such an amendment\r\nwere carried it would almost certainly cause the downfall of the\r\nministry. This happened, indeed, in 1886, when the resignation of Lord\r\nSalisbury's cabinet was brought about by the adoption of an amendment\r\nregretting that the speech announced no measure for providing\r\nagricultural labourers with land.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amendments to Government Bills.]\r\n\r\nFollowing upon the responsibility for the introduction and passage of\r\nall important measures has come an increasing control by the ministers\r\nover the details of their measures. It was formerly maintained that the\r\nHouse could exercise a great deal of freedom in amending bills, without\r\nimplying a loss of general confidence in the cabinet.[317:1] But of late\r\namendments carried against the opposition of the Treasury Bench have\r\nbeen extremely rare.[317:2] In fact only four such cases have occurred\r\nin the last ten years. This does not mean that the debates on the\r\ndetails of bills are fruitless. On the contrary, it often happens that\r\nthe discussion exposes defects of which the government was not aware, or\r\nreveals an unsuspected but widespread hostility to some provision; and\r\nwhen this happens the minister in charge of the bill often declares that\r\nhe will accept an amendment, or undertakes to prepare a clause to meet\r\nthe objection which has been pointed out.[317:3] But it does mean that\r\nthe changes in their bills are made by the ministers themselves after\r\nhearing the debate, and that an amendment, even of small consequence,\r\ncan seldom be carried without their consent. This is the natural outcome\r\nof the principle that the cabinet is completely responsible for the\r\nprincipal public measures, and hence must be able to control all their\r\nprovisions so long as it remains in office.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation of the Cabinet to the Committees.]\r\n\r\nFrom the same point of view the relation of the government to the\r\nvarious committees of the House is a matter of great importance. If the\r\ncabinet is to be responsible for the policy of the state, and must\r\nresign when defeated, it is manifestly entitled to frame the policy on\r\nwhich it stands. But if, as in some countries that have copied the\r\nparliamentary form of government, and notably in France, the bills of\r\nthe cabinet are referred for consideration and amendment to committees\r\nnot under its control, then it may have to face the alternative of\r\nopposing its own bill on account of the amendments made therein, or of\r\nstanding upon a measure of which it can no longer wholly approve. It may\r\nbe put in the awkward position of defending a policy that has been\r\nforced upon it, instead of one of its own selection. Such a condition of\r\nthings has sapped the authority of the ministry, and weakened the\r\ngovernment in more than one nation of continental Europe.[318:1] This\r\ndanger has been avoided in England by the very limited use of committees\r\non public bills, and by the influence of the Treasury Bench over those\r\nthat exist.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Controversial Bills not Referred to Committees.]\r\n\r\nThe most important government bills, and especially those of a highly\r\ncontroversial nature, are not referred to committees at all. They are\r\ndebated only in the House itself; and in Committee of the Whole, which\r\nis merely the House sitting with slightly different rules, and not a\r\ncommittee in the sense in which the word is used in this chapter. To\r\nselect committees few public bills are referred, and those as a rule are\r\ncertainly not of a controversial character.[319:1] The only difficulty\r\narises in the case of the standing committees. When he first proposed\r\nthese in 1882, Mr. Gladstone said that they were not intended to\r\nconsider measures of a partisan character;[319:2] and it has been\r\ngenerally recognised ever since that very contentious bills ought not to\r\nbe referred to them.[319:3] A long debate on the subject took place\r\nrecently, on the occasion when the bill to restrict alien immigration\r\nwas sent to the Standing Committee on Law in 1904.[319:4] All the\r\nmembers who took part in the discussions, except Mr. Chamberlain,[319:5]\r\nagreed on the general principle; but they did not agree upon any test of\r\ncontentiousness, and were sharply divided on the question whether the\r\nAliens Bill was contentious or not. Mr. Balfour himself took the ground\r\nthat the controversial character of a bill is a matter of degree, and\r\nthat this bill was near the border line. The obstacles in its path\r\nproved in the end so serious that it had to be dropped for the session.\r\n\r\nThat a bill is non-contentious clearly does not mean that it is\r\nunopposed, or even that the opposition has no connection with party.\r\nEvery one of the six government bills referred to standing committees in\r\n1899, for example, had a party vote at some stage in its passage\r\nthrough the House.[320:1] These committees are expected to deal, not\r\nwith questions of political principle, but with details that require\r\ntechnical skill or careful consideration, in bills where the general\r\nprinciple is either non-contentious, or may be regarded as settled by\r\nthe House itself. They were intended to be used for measures on which\r\nthe committee stage is not likely to raise any important questions of\r\npolicy. The original intention, however, has not been wholly carried\r\nout. Highly contentious bills have not infrequently been \"sent\r\nupstairs,\"[320:2] as the expression goes, although this has never been\r\ndone in the case of the most important government measures. Many people\r\nfeel that the departure is unfortunate, and hence there was no little\r\nopposition in 1907 to raising the number of standing committees to four,\r\nand providing that all bills should be referred to them unless the House\r\nordered otherwise. An amendment, to the report of the committee, that\r\nthe provision should not apply to bills containing general controversial\r\nmatter was rejected by a strict party vote,[320:3] and the change in\r\nprocedure was put through the House itself by the use of closure.[320:4]\r\nIf the standing committees were confined to non-contentious measures,\r\nthey could create no serious embarrassment for the ministry, even if\r\nquite free from its control.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Party Complexion of Committees.]\r\n\r\nBut in fact the committees are a good deal under the influence of the\r\ngovernment. In the first place the government party is always given a\r\nmajority of the members. Formerly it had on select committees a majority\r\nof one only,[320:5] but now it has become a general rule that both\r\nselect and standing committees shall reflect as nearly as may be the\r\nparty complexion of the House itself. Thus in 1894, when the parties\r\nwere nearly evenly balanced in the House, the government majority on the\r\ncommittees was usually very small, but after the Conservatives came into\r\npower with a much larger majority, their share of members in the\r\ncommittees was correspondingly great.[321:1] The standing committees,\r\nand often the select committees also, are appointed by the Committee of\r\nSelection, which contains usually six adherents of the party in power,\r\nand five from the other side of the House. But they are members of great\r\nexperience. They know the principles they are expected to apply, and\r\nwith their discretion in the choice of individuals the ministers make no\r\nattempt to interfere.[321:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of the Government in Committees.]\r\n\r\nThe mere possession of a majority upon a committee is not always enough,\r\nunless the government can bring pressure to bear upon its followers. In\r\nselect committees on bills this is not a matter of much consequence,\r\nbecause, as we have seen, they rarely have charge of important, or at\r\nleast of contentious, measures. In select committees of inquiry one\r\nhears nothing of pressure--to the credit of statesmen be it said--and\r\nalthough the report of an English committee or commission of inquiry is\r\noften a variation on the theme that \"no one did anything wrong, but they\r\nhad better not do it again,\" still there are reports that contain\r\nsevere criticism on the public administration.[322:1] In the standing\r\ncommittees the influence of the government is palpable. In fact these\r\ncommittees, when dealing with government bills, are miniatures of the\r\nHouse in arrangement as well as in composition. There are the same rows\r\nof benches facing each other; and the minister in charge of the bill\r\nsits in the corner seat at the chairman's right hand, accepting, or\r\nrefusing to accept, amendments on behalf of the government.[322:2]\r\nAbsent members are fetched in the same way to take part in\r\ndivisions;[322:3] and when the Conservatives were in power, whips were\r\nsometimes issued imploring them to be present on the morrow, because an\r\nimportant vote was expected. The Liberals do not do this, and often have\r\ntrouble in getting their partisans to attend. Moreover, a difficulty\r\nsometimes arises from the fact that the members who are most strongly\r\ninterested in a bill and hence least under the control of the\r\nminister--the Labour men or the Irish Nationalists, for example, in the\r\ncase of bills affecting their constituents--attend far more regularly\r\nthan the rest. But although the influence of the government over a\r\nstanding committee is distinctly less than over the House itself,[322:4]\r\nit is certainly very considerable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Few Party Votes in Committees.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless the voting in both select and standing committees runs\r\nlittle on party lines, decidedly less than it does in the House itself.\r\nTaking two recent years, 1894 and 1899, for which the writer has had\r\nstatistics prepared, it appears that in 1894 there were in the select\r\ncommittees twenty-three party votes out of eighty-four divisions; and\r\nin the Standing Committees on Law and Trade[323:1] there were only\r\nseven divisions in all, of which only two were on party lines; whereas\r\nin the House itself there were one hundred and eighty-four party votes\r\nout of a total of two hundred and forty-six divisions. Moreover, the\r\nparty votes in committees were mainly confined to a very few subjects.\r\nThus seventeen of the twenty-three party votes in the select committees\r\nwere given in the committee on the work of the Charity Commission, and\r\nfour of the remainder were in that on Scotch Feus and Building\r\nLeases.[323:2] For 1899 the comparison is even more striking. In the\r\nselect committees there was one party vote out of sixty-three divisions;\r\nin the standing committees six out of fifty-three--and those six were\r\nall on one bill[323:3]--while in the House there were two hundred and\r\nforty-two party votes out of three hundred and fifty-seven\r\ndivisions.[323:4]\r\n\r\nThe reasons why the votes run on party lines less in the committees than\r\nin the House itself are self-evident. First there is the fact that the\r\nmost contentious measures, those where party feeling runs highest, are\r\nnot referred to committees. Another reason, not less important, is that\r\na defeat of the government, even in a standing committee, cannot\r\ndirectly imperil the life of the ministry, and hence the final means of\r\npressure is lacking. In fact an amendment is occasionally carried\r\nagainst the government in a standing committee, and in that case the\r\nminister either makes up his mind to accept the change or tries to get\r\nit reversed in the House on report. But this very condition, which is\r\nembarrassing for the minister, shows that there is a limit to the work\r\nstanding committees can be set to do, without imperilling the authority\r\nof the cabinet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suggestion of a Committee on the Estimates.]\r\n\r\nA similar danger would attend the use of committees on the estimates.\r\nThe creation of such committees has often been suggested,[324:1] and for\r\na very good reason. The debates on the estimates in the House of Commons\r\nhave become an opportunity for criticising the conduct of the\r\nadministration, while the financial aspect of the matter, the question\r\nwhether the grants are excessive and ought to be reduced or not, has\r\nlargely fallen out of sight. It has not unnaturally been felt that this\r\nfunction, which the House itself is disinclined to discharge, might be\r\neffectively performed by a select or standing committee. But if the\r\ncommittee were really to revise the estimates, it would, like the\r\ncommittees on the budget in continental parliaments, encroach upon the\r\npower of the government to frame its own budget. It would imperil the\r\nexclusive initiative in money matters, which is the corner-stone both of\r\nsound finance, and of the authority of a responsible ministry. That the\r\nCommittee on Accounts should scrutinise the disbursements with care, to\r\nsee that they correspond with the votes, is most salutary; and that\r\nspecial committees should be appointed from time to time, to review the\r\nexpenditures, and suggest possible lines of saving, is also excellent.\r\nThese are in the nature of criticism of past actions, with suggestions\r\nof a general character for the future, and they do not affect the\r\nfreedom of the cabinet to lay down its own policy and prepare its own\r\nbudget.\r\n\r\nThe last committee on national expenditure reported in 1903 in favour of\r\nhaving a select committee examine each year one class or portion of the\r\nestimates; but there was a sharp difference of opinion on the question\r\nwhether such a committee would or would not interfere with the\r\nresponsibility of ministers, and the recommendation was adopted only by\r\na vote of seven to five.[325:1] In view of the experience in other\r\ncountries, one cannot help feeling that the minority was right; that\r\nwhile the proposed committee would be far less of a thorn in the side of\r\nthe Treasury Bench than one on the estimates as a whole, yet that if it\r\nreally exerted any authority, and ventured to report reductions, it\r\nwould stand to just that extent in a position of antagonism and rivalry\r\nwith the ministers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Legislative Capacity of Parliament has been Reached.]\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Gladstone's objects in proposing the standing committees was\r\nto increase the legislative capacity of the House, by enabling it to do\r\na part of its work by sections sitting at the same time.[325:2] Such a\r\nprocess of making one worm into two by cutting it in halves is well\r\nenough with an organism whose nervous system is not too highly\r\ncentralised; and in England it seems to have been carried about as far\r\nas is consistent with a responsible ministry. The standing committees\r\nhave to some extent fulfilled this purpose, but it is extremely doubtful\r\nwhether they can wisely be charged with bills of a more contentious\r\nnature than are sent to them now. In order to increase the legislative\r\noutput the number of standing committees was raised to four, on April\r\n16, 1907, with a provision that bills should be regularly referred to\r\nthem unless the House directed the contrary. How far this change will\r\nresult in placing in their hands more controversial bills, and how far\r\nit will increase the power of the House to pass laws, remains to be\r\nseen. There can be no doubt, however, that the legislative capacity of\r\nParliament is limited; and the limit would appear to be well-nigh\r\nreached, unless private members are to lose their remnant of time, or\r\ndebate is to be still further restricted, so that the members will no\r\nlonger be free, until closure is moved, to speak at such length as they\r\nplease, and to discuss every conceivable detail, great or small, often\r\nseveral times over. But upon the preservation of these things the\r\nposition of the House of Commons largely depends.\r\n\r\nTo say that at present the cabinet legislates with the advice and\r\nconsent of Parliament would hardly be an exaggeration; and it is only\r\nthe right of private members to bring in a few motions and bills of\r\ntheir own, and to criticise government measures, or propose amendments\r\nto them, freely, that prevents legislation from being the work of a mere\r\nautomatic majority. It does not follow that the action of the cabinet is\r\narbitrary; that it springs from personal judgment divorced from all\r\ndependence on popular or parliamentary opinion. The cabinet has its\r\nfinger always on the pulse of the House of Commons, and especially of\r\nits own majority there; and it is ever on the watch for expressions of\r\npublic feeling outside. Its function is in large part to sum up and\r\nformulate the desires of its supporters, but the majority must accept\r\nits conclusions, and in carrying them out becomes well-nigh automatic.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[309:1] Curiously enough, such a procedure is unknown in the House of\r\nCommons, and the term itself is unfamiliar. It means in the case of an\r\nelection, for example, that a candidate to be successful need only have\r\nmore votes than any one else, whereas election by majority means that he\r\nmust have more than half of the votes cast. The proposal for a second\r\nballot in elections to Parliament involves requiring a majority instead\r\nof a plurality on the first ballot.\r\n\r\n[312:1] S.O. 4. In his account of the evolution of procedure in the\r\nHouse of Commons (_Recht und Technik des Englischen Parlamentarismus_,\r\n_Buch I., Abs. 2_), Redlich traces the history of the practice of\r\nreserving particular days for the government, which began in 1811.\r\n\r\n[312:2] It is a mistake to lay too much stress upon the exact proportion\r\nof time allotted to private members and to the government; because much\r\nof the time of each is devoted to the same purpose. One of the uses to\r\nwhich private members' evenings are put is criticism of the conduct of\r\nthe ministry, but this is also the principal object of the debates upon\r\nthe address, upon the estimates in Committee of Supply, upon motions to\r\nadjourn and on other occasions.\r\n\r\n[312:3] These figures are taken from the return made for ten years in\r\n1888, and the subsequent annual returns, making due allowance for the\r\ncases of two short sittings instead of a long one in a day. An exact\r\ncomputation by hours would be difficult. The evening sittings are\r\nshorter than the average sittings, but so were the old Wednesday\r\nsittings reserved for private members.\r\n\r\n[313:1] As Redlich observes (_Recht und Technik_, 206) the introduction\r\nof the twelve-o'clock rule for the interruption of business brought in\r\nthe habit of talking out a bill before midnight, and blocking bills\r\nafter midnight, two of the great obstacles to legislation by private\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n[313:2] S.O. 6.\r\n\r\n[314:1] Although the time at the disposal of private members has not\r\nchanged much of late years, the number of these bills enacted, and\r\nespecially of those enacted against opposition, has diminished sensibly.\r\nIn the decade from 1878 to 1887 about twenty-three such bills were\r\npassed a year, and on four or five of these divisions took place.\r\n\r\n[314:2] S.O. 7. Ilbert, \"Manual,\" Secs. 45, 119.\r\n\r\n[315:1] The following examples are all taken from the session of 1904.\r\n\r\n[315:2] In 1903, for example, the House was counted out for want of a\r\nquorum on seven out of the seventeen private members' nights; while in\r\n1904 this happened only once, and then after the first motion had been\r\nvoted down.\r\n\r\n[315:3] On March 22 and 28, 1905, the ministers, with their followers,\r\ntook no part in the debates or divisions on the motions of private\r\nmembers condemning their attitude on the fiscal question, and they paid\r\nno attention to the votes. This event, which was unprecedented, will be\r\ndiscussed later.\r\n\r\n[316:1] S.O. 5.\r\n\r\n[316:2] _Cf._ Todd, \"Parl. Govt. in England,\" II., 368.

But in the case of standing committees the\r\napportionment is decidedly accurate. In fact one of the chief objections\r\nto a standing committee for Scotland, composed mainly of Scotch members,\r\nwas that it would not reflect the proportion of parties in the House. In\r\nthe debate Mr. Balfour remarked that this \"is not merely the traditional\r\npractice, but a practice absolutely necessary if we are to maintain\r\nGovernmental responsibility in matters of legislation.\" He asked what\r\nwould be the position of the government with standing committees of\r\nwhich they did not happen to possess the confidence. The committee would\r\nsend back a bill changed, and then the minister must either drop the\r\nbill, or accept it as it is, or reverse the changes on the report stage.\r\nSuch a position would, as he said, be intolerable, and would make\r\nlegislation by a responsible ministry an absurdity. (Hans. 4 Ser. XXII.,\r\n1132, 1135-36.) _Cf._ Second Rep. Com. on House of Commons (Procedure),\r\nMay 25, 1906, Q. 100.\r\n\r\n[321:2] Hans. 3 Ser. CCCXXXIX., 126. The chairmen of the standing\r\ncommittees are intended, like the Speaker, to be strictly impartial.\r\nThey are selected by and from the Chairman's Panel, which contains three\r\nmembers from each side of the House; and a member of the Opposition\r\noften presides when a government bill is discussed.\r\n\r\n[322:1] Notably in recent years that of 1903 on the War in South Africa,\r\nCom.

It reported upon only one bill,\r\nthat on Local Government for Scotland, and on this there were no less\r\nthan sixty-three divisions, of which twenty-one were party votes.\r\n\r\n[323:2] Both of the party votes in the standing committees of Law and\r\nTrade in 1894 were on the Church Patronage Bill, which was not a\r\ngovernment bill.\r\n\r\n[323:3] The Agriculture and Technical Education (Ireland) Bill.\r\n\r\n[323:4] The method of making these computations is the same as that\r\ndescribed in the chapter on \"The Strength of Party Ties,\" and the\r\ndivisions in the committees are taken from their reports in the blue\r\nbooks for the year.\r\n\r\nThe figures may be presented in other ways which give much the same\r\nresult. If we take only the party in power, to see in what proportion of\r\ndivisions it cast a party vote--paying no attention to the votes of the\r\nmembers of the Opposition--we find it as follows:--\r\n\r\n     1894:  House 81%;  Select Coms. 49%;  Stand.

Law & Trade 43%\r\n\r\nThe proportion of divisions where neither party cast a party vote were\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n     1894:  House 4.13%;  Select Coms. 25%;  Stand. Coms.

If the cabinet to-day legislates with the\r\nadvice and consent of the House, it administers subject to its constant\r\nsupervision and criticism. In both cases the relation is fundamentally\r\nthe same. In both the English system seems to be approximating more and\r\nmore to a condition where the cabinet initiates everything, frames its\r\nown policy, submits that policy to a searching criticism in the House,\r\nand adopts such suggestions as it deems best; but where the House, after\r\nall this has been done, must accept the acts and proposals of the\r\ngovernment as they stand, or pass a vote of censure, and take the\r\nchances of a change of ministry or a dissolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It Rarely directs Administrative Action.]\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to prevent the House of Commons from adopting an\r\naddress or resolution calling upon the government for specific\r\nadministrative action; and it has been occasionally, though not often,\r\ndone.[327:1] Under the present rules of procedure there are few\r\nopportunities for a direct vote of this kind, the chief occasions when\r\nit is in order being the evening sittings reserved for private members'\r\nmotions. On these and other occasions resolutions asking for executive\r\naction are sometimes brought forward,[327:2] but they are rarely\r\ncarried against the opposition of the cabinet. In fact it does not seem\r\nto have occurred at all in the last ten years, while in the preceding\r\nten years it occurred only four times; and it so happened that in the\r\nlast three of those cases, at least, the government did not carry out\r\nthe wishes of the House.[328:1] Such votes are not likely to be common\r\nin the future, because the modern principle of responsibility requires\r\nthat the ministers should be free to act and be held to account for what\r\nthey do, rather than that they should be given explicit directions in\r\nregard to their duties.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It Criticises Freely the Conduct of the Government.]\r\n\r\nIf the House of Commons does not often pass votes asking for executive\r\naction in the future, its members criticise the conduct of the\r\ngovernment in the past freely and constantly. The opportunities for\r\ndoing so are, indeed, manifold. There is first the address in answer to\r\nthe King's speech at the opening of the session; then the questions day\r\nby day give a chance, if not for direct criticism, at least for calling\r\nthe ministers to account; then there are the motions to adjourn; the\r\nprivate members' motions; the debates on going into the Committees of\r\nSupply and Ways and Means; the discussions in the Committee of Supply\r\nitself; the debates on the Consolidated Fund Resolutions, on the\r\nAppropriation Bill, on the Budget, and on the motions to adjourn for the\r\nholidays; and, finally, the formal motions of want of confidence. The\r\nway in which these various occasions are used to bring the acts of the\r\nministers to the attention of Parliament needs explanation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Individual Criticism and Collective Censure.]\r\n\r\nBut first it is important to distinguish between individual criticism by\r\nmembers, and collective censure by vote of the House. The former,\r\nwhether coming from the seats behind the Treasury Bench, or from the\r\nopposite side of the floor, is in the nature of a caution to the\r\nministers, an expression of personal opinion that is likely to find more\r\nor less of an echo outside of Parliament. It does not in itself imperil\r\nthe position of the government at the moment, although the errors of the\r\nministers pointed out in this way go into the great balance of account\r\non which the nation renders its verdict at the next general election.\r\nBut a collective censure by vote of the House may mean immediate\r\nresignation. Now the system of a responsible ministry implies the\r\nalternation in power of two parties holding different views upon the\r\nquestions of the day. If it does not imply this; if the fall of one\r\ncabinet is followed by the appointment of another with a similar policy;\r\nthen public life will revolve about the personal ambitions and intrigues\r\nof leading politicians,--a condition that has caused much of the\r\ndiscredit now attached to the parliamentary system in some continental\r\nstates. But if a change of ministry involves the transfer of power to an\r\nOpposition with quite a different programme, it is clear that the change\r\nought not to take place until the nation has declared, either at the\r\npolls, or through its representatives in the House of Commons, that it\r\nwishes that result. The ministers ought, therefore, to stand or fall\r\nupon their general policy, upon their whole record, or upon some one\r\nquestion that in permanent consequence outweighs everything else, not\r\nupon a particular act of secondary importance. Moreover the judgment\r\nought to be given after mature deliberation, not in the heat of a\r\ndebate upon some political blunder brought suddenly to the notice of the\r\nHouse. Exactly the reverse of this occurs under the French system of\r\ninterpellations. By that procedure a single act of the government can be\r\nmade the subject of a debate ending with motions condemning or\r\njustifying the occurrence; and great ingenuity is sometimes displayed in\r\nso framing the motions as to catch the votes of members, who, although\r\nsupporters of the cabinet, cannot approve of the act in question.[330:1]\r\nHow a resort to similar tactics in the House of Commons has been more\r\nand more barred out, will be seen in the following pages, which describe\r\nthe different methods of bringing the conduct of the ministers before\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Address in Reply to the King's Speech.]\r\n\r\nThe first two or three weeks of an ordinary session are taken up with a\r\ndebate on the address in reply to the King's speech. The address\r\nprovides a field for a series of political battles, fought over the\r\namendments that are brought forward. There are a dozen or more of these\r\nevery year; many of them urging the need of legislation that is not\r\nforeshadowed in the speech; others relating to purely administrative\r\nmatters arising in foreign or domestic affairs. Sometimes they deal with\r\nlarge questions of public policy, like the extension of the frontier of\r\nIndia, or the maintenance of the integrity of China. But this is by no\r\nmeans always true; and amendments are moved, for example, drawing\r\nattention to the grievances of the postal and telegraph clerks, or\r\ncomplaining of the government for failure to prosecute the directors of\r\na blasted financial scheme or for the releasing or refusing to release\r\npersons convicted of crimes connected with political agitation in\r\nIreland. In some of these cases particular acts are brought before the\r\nbar of the House; and it is usually impossible to avoid a direct vote\r\nupon them. But they are not recent events, or unexpectedly sprung upon\r\nParliament. They have almost always aroused a good deal of public\r\nattention, and formed the subject of no little discussion. The\r\ngovernment has, therefore, plenty of time to prepare its defence, to\r\nsound and marshal its followers; and it does not, in fact, suffer\r\ndefeats on administrative questions brought forward in this way. Twice\r\nin more than twenty years the government tellers have found themselves\r\nin a minority on an amendment to the address, but neither case involved\r\nan executive act. The first, in 1886, was an amendment expressing regret\r\nthat the speech had announced no measure for the relief of agricultural\r\nlabourers. Under the peculiar state of parties Lord Salisbury's cabinet\r\ntook the defeat as a vote of want of confidence and resigned. The other\r\ncase occurred in 1894, when an amendment aimed at the power of the Lords\r\nto reject bills passed by the Commons was carried against the government\r\non the motion of some of its own followers; but it was clearly not the\r\nkind of vote that involves the downfall of a ministry.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, the address is essentially a time for the discussion\r\nof questions of general policy, it is, no doubt, an occasion when\r\nparticular acts may be brought up for judgment, and a direct vote forced\r\nupon them, although not in the way that is most embarrassing for a\r\ncabinet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Questions to Ministers.]\r\n\r\nIsolated examples of questions addressed to ministers can be found far\r\nback in the eighteenth century, but the habit did not become common\r\nuntil about sixty years ago. At that period one hundred or more\r\nquestions were asked in the course of a session, and the first\r\nregulations were made regarding the time and method of putting\r\nthem.[331:1] Thereafter the practice grew so fast that in the seventies\r\nover one thousand were asked in a session, and by the end of the century\r\nit had increased to about five thousand. In form questions are simply\r\nrequests for information. They must contain no argument, no statement of\r\nfact not needed to make their purport clear, and they must be addressed\r\nto that minister in the House in whose province the subject-matter of\r\nthe inquiry falls.[332:1] They cover almost every conceivable field; the\r\nintentions of ministers in the conduct of the business of the House;\r\nacts done by officials of all grades in every department of the public\r\nservice; and even events that might be expected to give rise to action\r\nby the government. The process of answering questions gives to the\r\nTreasury Bench an air of omniscience not wholly deserved, for notice of\r\nthe question to be asked is sent in a day or two in advance so as to\r\ngive time for the permanent subordinates to hunt up the matter, and\r\nsupply their chief with the facts required.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Motives for Asking Them.]\r\n\r\nQuestions are asked from various motives; sometimes simply to obtain\r\ninformation; sometimes to show to constituents the assiduity of their\r\nmember, or to exhibit his opinions; sometimes to draw public attention\r\nto a grievance; sometimes to embarrass the government, or make a telling\r\npoint; and at times a question is asked by a supporter of the minister\r\nin order to give him a chance to bring out a fact effectively. But\r\nwhatever the personal motive may be, the system provides a method of\r\ndragging before the House any act or omission by the departments of\r\nstate, and of turning a searchlight upon every corner of the public\r\nservice. The privilege is easily abused, but it helps very much to keep\r\nthe administration of the country up to the mark, and it is a great\r\nsafeguard against negligent or arbitrary conduct, or the growth of that\r\nbureaucratic arrogance which is quite unknown in England. The minister\r\nis not, of course, obliged to answer, but unless he can plead an obvious\r\nreason of public policy why he should not do so, as is often the case in\r\nforeign affairs, a refusal would look like an attempt to conceal, and\r\nwould have a bad effect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Not followed by Debate or Vote.]\r\n\r\nNow while questions furnish a most effective means of bringing\r\nadministrative errors to the notice of the House they afford no\r\nopportunity for passing judgment upon them; and thereby they avoid the\r\ndangers of the French custom of interpellations. A question in England\r\nis not even followed by a debate. Often, indeed, the member says that\r\nhis inquiry has not been fully answered, or interjects a remark,\r\nobjection or further question; but this is never allowed to grow into a\r\ndiscussion, and when the habit of asking supplementary questions becomes\r\ntoo common the ministers refuse to answer them altogether, to the\r\ntemporary exasperation of the Opposition, or the Speaker himself checks\r\nthem, enforcing the rule against introducing matter of argument. If no\r\ndebate is in order, neither is a vote; and hence questions furnish a\r\nmeans of drawing public attention to an act, but not for collective\r\ncensure of it by the House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Motions to Adjourn.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their History.]\r\n\r\nAlthough a question cannot give rise directly to a discussion or a vote,\r\nyet a motion, followed both by a debate and a division, may result from\r\na question. This is the \"motion to adjourn for the purpose of discussing\r\na definite matter of urgent public importance,\" which is commonly, but\r\nby no means always, provoked by an answer to a question. It has had a\r\ncurious history. There is in the House of Commons no principle of\r\nuniversal application requiring debate to be confined to the subject of\r\nthe motion before the House, and great latitude was formerly permitted\r\nin the discussion of motions to adjourn.[333:1] Taking advantage of this\r\nfact it became the habit to create an opportunity for debating some\r\nmatter that could not be brought forward in the ordinary course of\r\nprocedure, by moving the adjournment before the orders of the day had\r\nbeen taken up; and the object being merely debate, the motion was almost\r\nalways withdrawn after it had served its purpose. In 1877 motions of\r\nthis kind began to be used, much against the inclination of the Speaker,\r\nto bring on a debate where the answer to a question had been\r\nunsatisfactory; and about the same time they ceased to be regularly\r\nwithdrawn.[334:1] A few years later, indeed, it became common to push\r\nthese motions to a division. Before 1881 this seems to have been done in\r\nonly two instances,[334:2] but in that year it was done seven times, and\r\nthe motions themselves rose to the unprecedented number of nineteen.\r\nMembers were beginning to regard the motion to adjourn as a privilege,\r\nwhile the freedom with which it could be used opened a door for abuse.\r\nThe government, however, speedily restricted the practice by regulations\r\nthat dealt with different kinds of motions to adjourn in different ways.\r\nThe motion to adjourn for the Easter or Whitsuntide recess was left\r\nuntouched, and still gives rise, as we shall see, to a miscellaneous\r\ndiscussion of many things. Upon a motion to adjourn, made, on the other\r\nhand, while the House is engaged upon the business of the day, debate\r\nwas, by a standing order of 1882, confined strictly to the question of\r\nadjournment;[334:3] and, finally, the motion to adjourn, made before the\r\norders of the day have been taken up, was hedged about by limitations\r\npeculiar to itself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Motion to Adjourn to Discuss an Urgent Public Matter.]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's Urgency Resolution of 1881 gave to the Speaker control\r\nover the business of the House so long as the matter declared urgent was\r\nunder consideration; and in framing rules for the exercise of his power\r\nthe Speaker laid down a principle that was embodied in a standing order\r\nin the autumn of 1882.[334:4] The order, which is still in force\r\nto-day, provides that a motion to adjourn shall not be made before\r\ntaking up the business of the day, except by leave of the House, unless\r\nforty members rise in their places to support it, or ten members rise,\r\nand the House, on a division, decides that the motion shall be made. It\r\nprovides, also, that the motion can be made only \"for the purpose of\r\ndiscussing a definite matter of urgent public importance.\"[335:1] The\r\nstanding order of 1882 prevented waste of time by a frivolous or\r\neccentric use of the motion to adjourn, but did not prevent any\r\nconsiderable body of opponents from using it to bring the ministers to\r\naccount. This may be seen from the fact that in the twenty years\r\nfollowing the adoption of the order the motion was made one hundred and\r\nforty-six times, and in just one half of those cases it was pushed to a\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Object of the Motion.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the motion is almost invariably made by an opponent of the\r\nministry, the object is not always censure. Sometimes it is made in\r\norder to obtain fuller information than can be given by an answer to a\r\nquestion; sometimes in order to rivet attention on a subject; and, as we\r\nhave seen, it is often withdrawn or negatived without a division. Yet it\r\ndoes furnish a method by which, without notice, a debate can be\r\nprecipitated and a vote taken upon a specific act or omission of the\r\ngovernment; and this is after all its chief importance. The motion\r\nbears, therefore, a certain resemblance to the French interpellation,\r\nbut the difference in form is of the utmost consequence. There is in\r\nEngland no chance to frame the motion, as in France, to express subtle\r\nshades of meaning. It cannot be so drafted that conscientious members of\r\nthe dominant party may feel obliged to vote for it, although it implies\r\na condemnation of the government. The motion to adjourn does not,\r\nindeed, express in terms any judgment upon the subject-matter of the\r\ndebate, and a supporter of the cabinet can, without inconsistency, state\r\nhis opinion that the ministers have blundered, and then vote against\r\nthe adjournment. The motion has, in fact, been carried only twice; once\r\non May 10, 1881, before the Standing Order of 1882, in a very thin\r\nHouse, when the government did not oppose it;[336:1] and a second time\r\non July 5, 1887, after the debate over the arrest of Miss Cass. In\r\nneither case did any minister resign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its Danger.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Under the Rules of 1902 and 1906.]\r\n\r\nStill the motion to adjourn is a source of danger to the cabinet. Cool\r\nas English public men are, and strong as the bonds of party have become,\r\nit would be rash to predict that the House of Commons will not be\r\ncarried away again as it was in the case of Miss Cass, and that the\r\ncabinet would not regard a vote to adjourn as a censure implying lack of\r\nconfidence. The danger has been slightly reduced by the rules of 1902.\r\nBy a change in the standing orders adopted in that year, and slightly\r\nmodified in 1906, the motion can be made only when the putting of\r\nquestions is finished at three o'clock, and then it stands over for\r\ndebate until a quarter past eight of the same day. By this arrangement\r\nthe government escapes the risk of surprise. It has five hours, after\r\nnotice of the debate, in which to prepare its case, ascertain the\r\nopinion of its followers, persuade the doubtful, and rally the faithful.\r\nThen the debate comes on at an hour when the attendance is habitually\r\nsmall, instead of a time when the House is always full.[336:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Blocking Orders.]\r\n\r\nMoreover a motion to adjourn for the purpose of discussing a matter of\r\nurgent public importance can, in the case of any particular subject, be\r\nprevented altogether, if necessary, by a very simple device. There is a\r\ngeneral principle of parliamentary law in England that no question on\r\nwhich the House has rendered a decision shall be brought before it a\r\nsecond time in the same session; and in the Commons--although not in the\r\nLords--the principle has been extended by rulings of the Speakers to\r\nforbid the anticipation of questions of which notice has already been\r\ngiven. Nor is it necessary that a definite time for taking the matter up\r\nshould have been fixed.[337:1] It is enough that the notice of a motion\r\nshould have been given, no matter how remote may be the chance that the\r\nmember who gave the notice will ever be able to bring his motion before\r\nthe House. By merely giving notice of a motion, which he has no\r\nintention of calling up, any member can, therefore, prevent a subject\r\nfrom being brought forward either by a motion to adjourn, or by a\r\nsubsequent private member's motion, or in the course of the debate on\r\nadjournment for the Easter or Whitsuntide recess. A \"blocking motion\" of\r\nthis kind is thus an effectual barrier against a motion to adjourn which\r\nmight place the government in an awkward position.\r\n\r\nComplaints of the use of blocking motions have been often made, and in\r\n1904 there was no little discussion of the subject.[337:2] There were\r\nsaid to be on the notice paper, without any day assigned for their\r\nconsideration, thirty-four notices of motion, relating among other\r\nthings to fiscal reform, Macedonia, the Congo State, Thibet, the\r\nreorganisation of the War Office, Chinese labour in South Africa, public\r\nhealth, military training, local and other taxation, and the system of\r\nblocking motions itself.[337:3] It was asserted that motions of this\r\nkind were set down by supporters of the Treasury Bench after\r\nconsultation with the government whip. Mr. Balfour did not deny the\r\ncharge, but said that he never inquired into consultations of that\r\nkind.[338:1] He thought that \"there ought to be no limitation of the\r\npowers of the House to discuss anything upon a motion for adjournment\r\nfor the holidays\"; but he was more cautious in giving an opinion about\r\nmotions to adjourn to discuss a matter of urgent public importance. The\r\ngovernment dislikes these motions, because they consume precious time,\r\nand because they can be used on all occasions to raise awkward questions\r\non which the cabinet may be unwilling to show its hand or supply facts.\r\nThere is, however, another serious objection to them. The House ought to\r\nbe at liberty to criticise the ministry freely at all times, but that\r\nthe discussion should be followed by a vote, expressing, however\r\nindirectly, a judgment on the matter, involves a possible danger to the\r\nparliamentary form of government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Private Members' Motions.]\r\n\r\nThe most direct method by which the acts of the ministers can be brought\r\nbefore Parliament, and a vote taken upon them, is that of private\r\nmembers' motions. These may, and often do, contain an explicit\r\ncondemnation of some part of the policy or administrative conduct of the\r\ngovernment. But the effectiveness of such motions as a means of passing\r\njudgment upon the Treasury Bench is not in reality great, and that for\r\nseveral reasons. There are in all only about seventeen evenings reserved\r\nfor the purpose, and it is rare that more than one motion reaches a vote\r\nin an evening. Nor are those few occasions all used to take the\r\ngovernment to task. The right to make a motion is determined by the\r\nballot, and the fortunate member is free to raise any question he\r\npleases. Being one of the rare chances for private initiative, he often\r\nuses it to bring forward some favourite project of his own. Several of\r\nthese evenings are thus devoted every year to discussing aspirations\r\nthat lie outside the field of party politics, and do not affect the\r\nposition of the cabinet. The number of motions aimed at the government\r\nis, therefore, not large, and unless many members are interested in\r\ncriticising the same thing, it is a mere chance what is brought forward\r\nfor discussion. Then all the private members' evenings come in the early\r\npart of the year; and notices of the motions must be given four evenings\r\nin advance. It follows that they can hardly deal with current questions\r\nthat arise after the session is well under way, and this is in itself a\r\nvery serious limitation upon their importance as a means of bringing the\r\nministers to account.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Means of Avoiding Them.]\r\n\r\nIn case of necessity a hostile vote on a private member's motion can\r\nusually be avoided. The member has but one evening, and the ministers\r\ncould no doubt prolong the debate until the moment of interruption, and\r\nthen defeat an attempt at closure. But this does not appear to be done,\r\nand might be regarded as showing too much fear of the result. Sometimes,\r\nalso, a motion can be blocked, although that is not so easy as in the\r\ncase of a motion to adjourn, because the private member has as early an\r\nopportunity as the blocker to give notice of his motion.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, other means of defence; and, in fact, the\r\npossibility of escaping a disastrous vote on a private member's motion\r\nhas been recently illustrated in the case of the fiscal question in a\r\nvery striking way, for during the sessions of 1904 and 1905 such motions\r\nwere used persistently in a vain attempt to get a decisive expression of\r\nopinion on that question. On May 18, 1904, a motion was made against any\r\nprotective tax on food, which the government met by an amendment that it\r\nwas not necessary to discuss the question. As there were a number of\r\nUnionists who objected to a tax on food, but did not want to upset the\r\ngovernment, the amendment was carried. Early in the next session another\r\ninconvenient motion of a similar kind was shelved by the previous\r\nquestion; and, finally, Mr. Balfour decided that he could avoid the\r\nconsequences of a wager of battle by simply refusing to fight. On March\r\n22 and 28, 1905, followed by most of his supporters, he absented himself\r\nfrom the debates and divisions on private members' motions touching\r\nthis subject, although on the second occasion the motion condemned in\r\ndirect terms the policy of the government. He explained that he took\r\nthis course because the subject ought not to be discussed on party\r\nlines, and could not be dealt with by the existing Parliament, which had\r\nno mandate from the nation for the purpose. He added that if the House\r\nwas allowed on private members' nights to act without the ordinary\r\nmachinery of party management, the conclusions at which it might arrive\r\nwould be treated as expressions of opinion which do not govern\r\npolicy.[340:1] In other words, he claimed that the ministers might\r\ndecline to take part in the proceedings on private members' motions, and\r\ndisregard the votes passed. His attitude was severely criticised, and\r\nmay have damaged the ministry in the eyes of the public, but that he\r\nshould have been able to assume it shows the impotence of motions of\r\nthat kind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rarely Carried Against the Ministers.]\r\n\r\nAs lately as twenty years ago motions made by private members were not\r\ninfrequently carried against the opposition of the government--on the\r\naverage nearly once a year. Like all other votes hostile to the\r\nministers, however, they have become more rare, and in fact the last\r\ncase of the kind occurred in 1893. But if private members' motions have\r\nnot of late proved effectual, as a means of bringing some special part\r\nof the conduct of the government before the judgment of the House, and\r\nobtaining a test vote upon it, this may not hereafter be true in every\r\ncase. They certainly furnish possible exception to the principle that in\r\nits relations with the government the House of Commons passes judgment\r\nonly upon the measures which the ministers choose to bring forward, or\r\nupon their policy and administrative record as a whole.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Debate on Going into Supply.]\r\n\r\nAmendments to the address, motions to adjourn and private members'\r\nmotions, are almost the only occasions at the present time when\r\ncriticism of the government's action can be followed by a vote upon the\r\nact criticised. Formerly there was another opportunity as constant and\r\nprolific as any of them. This came when the House resolved itself into\r\nCommittee of the Whole on Supply. Before taking up supply on any day a\r\nmotion had to be made that the Speaker do leave the chair; and in\r\naccordance, it was said, with the ancient doctrine that redress of\r\ngrievances should be considered before supply, any subject not requiring\r\na substantive motion, or not a matter of detail properly discussed in\r\nthe committee itself, could be debated either on the principal motion,\r\nor on an amendment framed for the purpose.[341:1] This gave frequent\r\nopportunities, throughout the greater part of the session, not only for\r\nfinding fault with the conduct of the government, but also for taking\r\nthe sense of the House thereon by means of amendments to the motion that\r\nthe Speaker do leave the chair.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How Limited in 1882.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In 1896 and 1902.]\r\n\r\nThe practice opened the door to a vexatious waste of time, and in 1882\r\nit was limited by a standing order, which provided that on Monday or\r\nThursday the Speaker should leave the chair without question put (and\r\ntherefore without amendment or debate) unless on first going into supply\r\non the estimates for the Army, Navy, or civil service, or on a vote of\r\ncredit, an amendment should be moved, or question raised, relating to\r\nthe estimates proposed to be taken in supply.[341:2] Tuesdays and\r\nWednesdays were at that time private members' days, and whenever they\r\nwere seized by the government, and used for supply, it was the habit to\r\nextend the order to them by special vote.[341:3] This left Friday as the\r\nonly day on which the motion that the Speaker do leave the chair was\r\nopen to amendment and debate.[341:4] Finally, in 1896, when a fixed\r\nnumber of days were allotted to supply, the standing order was extended\r\nto Friday also.\r\n\r\nIt was done at first by a sessional order; but this was renewed from\r\nyear to year, until it was made permanent by the rules of 1902.[342:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of the Present Practice.]\r\n\r\nAt present the Speaker leaves the chair without putting any question,\r\nexcept on going into supply for the first time on the Army, Navy and\r\ncivil service estimates; and on these three occasions the rule that\r\ndiscussion and amendment must relate to the estimates in that branch of\r\nsupply about to be taken up is very strictly applied.[342:2] Moreover,\r\nonly a single amendment to the motion that the Speaker do leave the\r\nchair can be moved, because the amendment takes the form that certain\r\nwords in the motion be left out in order to substitute others, and the\r\nquestion is put to the House whether the words proposed to be left out\r\nshall stand. If, therefore, the amendment is negatived, the House has\r\ndecided that those words shall stand part of the question, and no other\r\namendment to omit them can afterward be proposed.[342:3] Debate,\r\nhowever, may and usually does continue upon the main question. But the\r\nHouse can hardly reject the motion that the Speaker do leave the chair;\r\nand, in fact, such a vote, although perhaps a general reflection upon\r\nthe ministry, could not, after a miscellaneous debate upon many topics,\r\nbe regarded as expressing an opinion upon any particular subject.\r\n\r\nIt follows that (besides the extraordinary case of a vote of credit)\r\nthere are every year three occasions set apart for general discussion of\r\nall matters germane to the three great branches of supply, on each of\r\nwhich a single vote can be taken upon some special grievance or question\r\nof policy. Formerly the amendment that obtained the right of way\r\ndepended largely upon the accident of catching the Speaker's eye,[342:4]\r\nbut now, like the motions on private members' nights, it is determined\r\nby the blinder justice of the lot.[342:5] The amendments relate to all\r\nmanner of things, such as the system of enlistment for the Army, the\r\nnumber of artillery horses, the insufficient manning of the fleet, the\r\ndesirability of an international agreement for a reduction in\r\nship-building, the refusal of the Post Office to grant telephone\r\nlicenses to municipalities, the inequitable fiscal treatment of\r\nScotland, and the defective state of primary education in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe three general debates upon the motions to go into Committee of\r\nSupply upon the estimates still afford an excellent chance for\r\ncriticising the government, but the limitations upon amendments, and the\r\nconditions under which they are proposed, has reduced the opportunity\r\nfor a decisive condemnation of any part of its conduct almost to\r\nnothing. Until a score of years ago the ministers were, indeed, beaten\r\nnearly every session upon some amendment on going into supply, but since\r\n1891 this has not happened once.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amendments on Going into Ways and Means.]\r\n\r\nAfter the general rule forbidding debate and amendment on going into\r\nCommittee of Supply had been extended to Friday, it occurred to Mr.\r\nGibson Bowles, an enterprising mentor of the government, that a similar\r\nuse might be made of the motion to go into Committee of Ways and Means.\r\nAccordingly in the regular session of 1900, and in the special session\r\nin December of that year, he moved amendments to the motion, but the\r\npractice grieved the Treasury Bench and was stopped by a change in the\r\nstanding orders made in 1901.[343:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Debate in the Committee of Supply as a Means of Criticism.]\r\n\r\nIn proposing his new procedure for supply in 1896, Mr. Balfour spoke of\r\nthe belief that the object of debating the appropriations is to secure\r\neconomical administration, as an ancient superstition no longer at all\r\ntrue. Members, he said, now move reductions in order to get from\r\nministers a promise of future increase; and the danger is that the\r\nHouse will urge too much extravagance. He insisted that the real object\r\nof the Committee of Supply is the chance it affords to private members\r\nof criticising the executive and administrative action of the\r\ngovernment; that it is an open platform for members, where the\r\nministers, for the sake of getting their appropriations passed, are\r\nbound to keep a quorum.[344:1] This is, indeed, manifest to any one\r\nfamiliar with the debates upon the estimates. They are not to any great\r\nextent discussions of financial questions, of what the nation can, or\r\ncannot, afford to do. They are a long series of criticisms upon the\r\npolicy of the ministers, and the conduct of the departments under their\r\ncontrol. From this point of view Mr. Balfour suggested a method of\r\nmaking the debates more valuable. He described the futility of the old\r\nsystem of taking up the estimates in their numerical order, pointing out\r\nhow much time was wasted every year in discussing the earlier votes in\r\nClass I.,--repairs of royal palaces, etc.,--while some of the largest\r\nappropriations were always hurried through with little comment at the\r\nfag end of the session. He promised in future to bring forward the\r\nimportant votes in the earlier part of the year, and in fact to give\r\nprecedence to estimates that any group of members might wish to\r\ndiscuss.[344:2]\r\n\r\nAdding together the days regularly allotted to supply under the standing\r\norder, the additional sittings used for the purpose, and those devoted\r\nto supplementary estimates,[344:3] the better part of more than thirty\r\ndays are spent every year in Committee of Supply. This would appear to\r\ngive time enough for a thorough overhauling of many branches of the\r\nadministration; and under Mr. Balfour's practice, which will, no doubt,\r\nbe followed by future cabinets, the question what departments shall be\r\nexamined is determined by the critics themselves.\r\n\r\nThe debates in the Committee of Supply must be relevant to the estimates\r\nunder consideration, that is, they must be confined to the particular\r\nvote then before the House, and the conduct of the government connected\r\ntherewith. The greater part of the time is therefore taken up with a\r\ndiscussion of small details of administration. But there are certain\r\nvotes that give a chance to review the broader questions of policy. As\r\nthe grants made to the Army and Navy for one purpose can, with the\r\nconsent of the Treasury, be used for another, the debate on the great\r\nvotes for the pay of the men is allowed to range over the general policy\r\nand management of the service concerned.[345:1] The items for the\r\nsalaries of the ministers give a similar, though less comprehensive,\r\nchance to examine the policy pursued in their several departments; and\r\nin order to raise a debate of that kind it is common to move to reduce\r\nthe salary of a minister by one hundred pounds. If an excessive\r\nproportion of the time devoted to supply is consumed in the ventilation\r\nof small grievances, that is due to the fact that the criticism is\r\nconducted, in the main, by individual members of the House, and not by\r\nan organised opposition; but at least it has the merit of keeping the\r\nadministration in all its details highly sensitive to public opinion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amendments in Supply as an Expression of Opinion.]\r\n\r\nThe debates in supply afford an excellent opportunity for criticising\r\nthe acts of the government, but the divisions in supply are not an\r\neffective means of expressing the judgment of the House upon those acts.\r\nThe items of appropriation are grouped into votes, each of which, as its\r\nname implies, is passed as a single vote; and every vote contains so\r\nmany items that the House cannot reject it entirely.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the only amendment in order is a motion to reduce the vote,\r\nby omitting a particular item or otherwise. Now a reduction may be moved\r\neither because the House really objects to the appropriation, or as a\r\nmeans of expressing condemnation of some act of the government connected\r\nwith the item in question. Even in these days of extravagance the House\r\noccasionally objects to an appropriation on the ground that it is\r\nunnecessary or excessive, or because it disapproves of the purpose\r\naltogether. In such cases the Chancellor of the Exchequer is apt to\r\nwithdraw the estimate or consent to the reduction. In fact, there have\r\nbeen only two instances in the last twenty years where a reduction was\r\nmade for this reason without the consent of the government, and only one\r\nwhere it was carried against their opposition.[346:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reductions used as a Protest.]\r\n\r\nA reduction is often moved, on the other hand, to emphasise some\r\ngrievance, some act of the administration that is the subject of\r\ncomplaint. But such a motion is not an effective means of testing the\r\nopinion of the House upon the matter in debate. When, for example, a\r\nreduction of a minister's salary is proposed in order to draw attention\r\nto a shortcoming in his department, the supporters of the cabinet almost\r\ninvariably vote against the reduction without regard to their opinion\r\nupon the shortcoming in question; and they are perfectly right in so\r\ndoing. They would be quite justified, and quite logical, in refusing to\r\nvote the reduction in salary, while saying that the act complained of\r\nhad been a mistake and ought not to occur again. An amendment of that\r\nkind is, therefore, seldom carried; and then usually by accident. It has\r\nhappened only four times in a score of years. On June 14, 1895, when\r\nLord Rosebery's cabinet was struggling for its life, with only a\r\nmajority of a dozen in the Commons, it was beaten on an amendment\r\nreducing the appropriation for the Parliament buildings by five hundred\r\npounds to call attention to the quantity of rooms occupied by officials\r\nof the House. The number of members who took part in the division was so\r\nsmall--the vote being sixty-three to forty-three--that the result must\r\nbe regarded as a fluke, rather than as an expression of opinion by the\r\nHouse. A week later the government was defeated again on an amendment to\r\nreduce the salary of the Secretary of State for War by one hundred\r\npounds to draw attention to an alleged lack of supply of cordite. This\r\nwas done by a trick. Enough Conservatives to turn the scale were brought\r\ninto the House, by way of the terrace, without the knowledge of the\r\nwhips on either side. Under ordinary circumstances the ministers would\r\nnot have paid much attention to such a division, but their position in\r\nthis case was so precarious and so uncomfortable, that they took\r\nadvantage of the occurrence to resign. The third instance happened in\r\n1904 when the grant for the Commissioners of National Education in\r\nIreland was reduced by one hundred pounds as a protest against a\r\ncircular they had issued which limited the teaching of the Irish\r\nlanguage in the schools. It was a \"snap\" vote, coming suddenly after a\r\nvery short debate. Had the ministers foreseen the division they could\r\neasily have called in enough of their followers to change the\r\nmajority;[348:1] and, in fact, they seem to have disregarded the vote\r\naltogether, save that they expended for Irish education one hundred\r\npounds less than they had intended. The last case was in 1905, when the\r\nappropriation for the Irish Land Commission was reduced by one hundred\r\npounds as a protest against the administration of the Land Act of 1903.\r\nThis was serious, and the government considered its position for a\r\ncouple of days, but decided for the moment neither to resign nor\r\ndissolve.[348:2]\r\n\r\nManifestly the debates in Committee of Supply offer a very wide field\r\nfor individual criticism, while they give little chance for collective\r\ncondemnation of the matters criticised. This is even more obvious in\r\ncertain other forms of procedure that are yet to be considered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Debates on the Finance Bill;]\r\n\r\nThe debates upon the resolutions embodying the proposals of the budget,\r\nand upon the Finance Bill that carries them into effect, are governed by\r\nthe ordinary rules of debate upon bills, and are confined to the\r\nquestions immediately before the House.[348:3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: on the Budget;]\r\n\r\nBut in introducing his budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer makes a\r\nstatement covering the income and expenditure of the current and coming\r\nyears, and incidentally reviewing the economic condition of the country\r\nand the state of trade. The debate that ensues may wander as far as the\r\nstatement itself, regardless of the particular resolution on which it is\r\nnominally based. This gives a chance to examine fully the financial\r\npolicy--but only the financial policy--of the government; without,\r\nhowever, any corresponding means of expressing the judgment of the House\r\nthereon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: on the Consolidated Fund Bills.]\r\n\r\nIn his treatise on parliamentary practice, Sir Thomas Erskine May states\r\nthat debate and amendment on the stages of Consolidated Fund Bills \"must\r\nbe relevant to the bill, and must be confined to the conduct or action\r\nof those who receive or administer the grants specified in the\r\nbill.\"[349:1] The first part of this statement is true of the committee\r\nstage. Debate and amendment must then be strictly relevant; and as the\r\nobject of the bills is simply to authorise the issue out of the\r\nConsolidated Fund of the sums required to meet the grants already voted,\r\nand to provide that those grants must be used for the purposes for which\r\nthey are made, no criticism of administrative conduct is in\r\norder.[349:2] The proceedings in committee are, therefore, brief. The\r\nlatter part of May's statement applies to the second and third readings,\r\nbut as the bills cover the grants that support practically every branch\r\nof the government, except the India Office,[349:3] the acts of almost\r\nany department can be discussed at those stages. The occasions are, as a\r\nrule, freely used for the purpose. Sometimes the debate is of a\r\nmiscellaneous character, and runs off into small details, but more\r\ncommonly it turns upon a few large questions of domestic, colonial or\r\nforeign policy that have aroused general interest.[349:4] Amendments\r\ncan, indeed, be moved, and they may range as far as the debate itself.\r\nThe procedure would appear, therefore, to resemble that of going into\r\nCommittee of Supply. But the House is aware that it must pass the bills,\r\nand although a division on the reading is often taken, the negative\r\nvotes are usually confined to the Irish members, who are more anxious to\r\nimpede than to make use of the parliamentary system. In the rare cases\r\nwhere amendments have been moved the object is simply to concentrate\r\ndiscussion upon some particular question,[350:1] and they have seldom,\r\nif ever, been carried.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Debates on Adjournment for Easter and Whitsuntide.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking case of an opportunity for criticising the\r\ngovernment, without any means of condemning its action, is furnished by\r\nthe motion to adjourn over Easter or Whitsuntide. According to the old\r\npractice about adjournment, the rule of relevancy does not apply in\r\nthese cases, and hence the discussion may, and in fact does, wander\r\nwherever the members please. It is of a heterogeneous nature, touching\r\nupon many subjects. But as the Speakers have ruled that no amendment is\r\nin order, except on the time of adjournment,[350:2] the motion which\r\nprovides the excuse for a debate is always adopted as it stands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Motion of Want of Confidence.]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing comprise all the ordinary means of criticising the conduct\r\nof the government. The leader of the Opposition has one more. He can at\r\nany time claim to move a vote of want of confidence, and within\r\nreasonable limits the leader of the House will always assign a day for\r\nthe purpose. But this is quite a different matter from the criticism of\r\nparticular acts of which we have been speaking. Whatever the precise\r\nform of the motion may be, the object is to turn the ministry out, and\r\nevery member goes into one or the other lobby, according to his desire\r\nthat the cabinet shall stand or fall. The judgment of the House is\r\npassed not upon any one act or question of policy, but distinctly upon\r\nthe record of the ministry as a whole; and a defeat must be immediately\r\nfollowed by resignation or dissolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Freedom of Criticism.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulty in Passing Judgment.]\r\n\r\nFrom this survey of the various methods by which the ministers can be\r\ncalled to account in the House of Commons, it is clear that the\r\nopportunities to air grievances, to suggest reforms, and to criticise\r\nthe government for both large matters and small, for their general\r\npolicy and their least administrative acts, are many and constant. If\r\nless numerous than formerly, they are in practice quite as useful. For\r\nthe object they serve, that of turning a searchlight upon the\r\ngovernment, and keeping the public informed of its conduct, they are\r\nabundant. On the other hand, the opportunities to pass judgment upon\r\nparticular acts of the ministers have diminished very much, and there is\r\na marked tendency to make a definite expression of opinion on such\r\nmatters by vote of the House more and more difficult. Such a tendency is\r\nentirely in accord with the true principle of parliamentary government.\r\nThere ought to be the fullest opportunity for criticism; but the cabinet\r\nmust be free not only to frame its own policy, but also to carry that\r\npolicy out, and it ought not to be shackled, or thrust out, so long as\r\nits conduct of affairs is on the whole satisfactory to the nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Illustrated by the Debates on Fiscal Policy.]\r\n\r\nSo far we have considered primarily the functions of the House in\r\nrelation to administrative matters, but, except for the bills brought in\r\nby the government, what has been said applies equally to its control\r\nover the general policy of the cabinet, for its means of criticising and\r\npassing judgment are the same. How far the ministers are free to-day to\r\nframe the programme on which they will take their stand, and how hard it\r\nis to force an issue on a question that they do not choose to bring\r\nforward, may be seen from the recent history of the debates on the\r\nfiscal question. A considerable number of Unionists were strongly\r\nopposed to a return to protective duties in any form, and especially to\r\na taxation of food. There were enough of them to turn the scale, so that\r\nif a division could have been taken at any time on the fiscal question\r\nalone, the House would in all probability have voted in favour of\r\nmaintaining the existing system. On the other hand, most of the\r\nfree-food Unionists, being heartily in accord with the cabinet on other\r\nmatters, desired to keep it in power so long as it adopted no fiscal\r\npolicy hostile to their principles; and therefore they were anxious not\r\nto vote against the government if they could conscientiously abstain\r\nfrom doing so. Under these circumstances the Liberals sought by every\r\nmeans to force a direct vote upon the fiscal question, while Mr. Balfour\r\ncautiously avoided any definite statement of policy himself, and strove\r\nto prevent the House from expressing a distinct opinion on the subject.\r\nHe took the ground that until the cabinet announced a fiscal programme\r\nthe only form in which the attitude of the ministers on the question\r\ncould properly come before Parliament was that of a general motion of\r\nwant of confidence in them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In 1903.]\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain broached his plan of preferential tariffs in a speech at\r\nBirmingham on May 15, 1903. By that time it was just too late in the\r\nyear to bring forward a private member's motion on the subject; so that\r\nthe first debate upon it took place on the motion to adjourn over\r\nWhitsuntide,[352:1] when no amendment or vote expressing the opinion of\r\nthe House was in order. This was May 28. The next opportunity for\r\nextensive discussion came on June 9 over the Finance Bill; but the\r\nSpeaker ruled, that as the government had made no proposals for a change\r\nof fiscal policy, such changes could not be brought into the debate on\r\nthat bill.[352:2] The Opposition then resorted to a motion to adjourn.\r\nBut it was not easy to treat as an urgent matter the question of\r\nadopting a policy, which the ministers declared the existing Parliament\r\nincompetent to adopt, and the Opposition insisted ought never to be\r\nadopted at all. The Liberals solved the difficulty by taking advantage\r\nof a recent occurrence, and on June 17 moved to adjourn to discuss a\r\nmisunderstanding of the tariff speeches of Mr. Balfour and Mr.\r\nChamberlain by the premier of New South Wales. The Speaker, however,\r\nruled that a general debate of the fiscal question did not come within\r\nthe terms of the motion, although a motion of wider scope might have\r\nbeen made. The adjournment was, of course, rejected, and by a vote of\r\n252 to 132.[352:3] Both on this and on later occasions, Mr. Balfour,\r\nwhile refusing to give any of the government's time for the discussion\r\nof fiscal policy as such, expressed his entire readiness to assign a day\r\nfor a formal motion of lack of confidence;[353:1] but the Liberals did\r\nnot accept the offer. They said, and with truth, that a vote of censure\r\nwould not test the opinion of the House on the fiscal question; and they\r\nknew that it would result in an overwhelming defeat for them. Finally,\r\non Aug. 11, the Speaker ruled that, as no official act of any minister\r\nwas involved, the question could not be debated on the second reading of\r\nthe Appropriation Bill.[353:2] And thus, although there were many\r\nquestions put on the subject, and some incidental discussion during the\r\ndebates on other matters, the session of 1903 came to an end without any\r\nvote on fiscal policy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In 1904.]\r\n\r\nWhen the House met again great changes had taken place in the ministry.\r\nBoth Mr. Chamberlain and his strongest opponents had resigned, and it\r\nwas certain that the cabinet would take no positive attitude on the\r\nfiscal question during the life of the Parliament. Yet the Liberals had\r\nseveral means of extracting a vote on the subject, which they had lacked\r\nin the second half of the preceding session. They began at once with the\r\ndebate on the address, by moving that the removal of protective duties\r\nhas conduced to the welfare of the population, and that any return to\r\nthem would be injurious. The wording was not well adapted to drive a\r\nwedge into the government majority, for the ministers repudiated the\r\ncharge that they contemplated protection. Only twenty-one Unionists\r\nvoted for the amendment, which was rejected by 327 to 276.[353:3] Then\r\ncame, on March 9, a private member's motion to the effect that the House\r\nexpresses its condemnation of the continual agitation in favour of a\r\nprotective tariff encouraged by the ministers. This also was not well\r\nconceived, and was rejected by 289 to 243, nineteen Unionists voting\r\nagainst the government. On May 18 another private member's motion came\r\non; which stated that the House, believing a protective tariff on food\r\nburdensome to the people, welcomes the declaration that the government\r\nis opposed to it. It was a more dangerous attack, which the ministers\r\nmet by moving an amendment that it was unnecessary to discuss the\r\nquestion. They succeeded by about the same majority as on the other\r\noccasions, for the amendment was carried by a vote of 306 to 251,\r\nseventeen Unionists in the minority.[354:1]\r\n\r\nAt last the Liberals asked for a day to move a vote of censure, and Aug.\r\n1 was set apart for the purpose. The motion expressed regret that\r\ncertain ministers had accepted official positions in the Liberal\r\nUnionist Association, which had recently declared its adhesion to the\r\npolicy of preferential duties, involving the taxation of food. But the\r\nform of the motion was unimportant, and the result illustrates the\r\nnature of a vote of want of confidence, and the futility of using it to\r\ntest the opinion of the House on any particular question of policy. No\r\none voted against the ministers who was not prepared to turn them out,\r\nand the motion was rejected by a vote of 288 to 210.[354:2] Only one\r\nmember classed as a Unionist voted for it, while of those who had gone\r\ninto the Opposition lobby on previous occasions one voted with the\r\ngovernment, and the rest absented themselves. Although the fiscal\r\nquestion had been debated several times,[354:3] the Opposition had again\r\nbeen baffled throughout the session in their efforts to get a vote upon\r\nits merits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In 1905.]\r\n\r\nThe result in the following year was the same, but the tactics were\r\ndifferent. The first private member's motion on the subject was shelved\r\nby the previous question, and the government dealt with the subsequent\r\nones by the novel device, already described, of staying away from the\r\ndivision altogether. Mr. Balfour virtually took the ground that a vote\r\non which the government exerted no pressure could not be regarded as a\r\ntrue expression of the opinion of the House, and might therefore be\r\nignored--an extension, although by no means an illogical extension, of\r\nthe accepted doctrines of the constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliament the Great Inquest of the Nation.]\r\n\r\nThe system of a responsible ministry can develop in a normal and healthy\r\nway only in case the legislative body is divided into two parties, and\r\nunder those conditions it is the inevitable consequence of the system\r\nthat Parliament cannot support the cabinet on one question and oppose it\r\non another. The programme of the ministers must be accepted or rejected\r\nas a whole, and hence the power of initiative, both legislative and\r\nexecutive, must rest entirely with them. This is clearly the tendency in\r\nParliament at the present day.[355:1] The House of Commons is finding\r\nmore and more difficulty in passing any effective vote, except a vote of\r\ncensure. It tends to lose all powers except the power to criticise and\r\nthe power to sentence to death. Parliament has been called the great\r\ninquest of the nation, and for that purpose its functions have of late\r\nbeen rather enlarged than impaired. Nor are the inquisitors confined to\r\nany one section of the House, for while that part is played chiefly by\r\nthe Opposition, the government often receives a caution from its own\r\nsupporters also. If the parliamentary system has made the cabinet of the\r\nday autocratic, it is an autocracy exerted with the utmost publicity,\r\nunder a constant fire of criticism; and tempered by the force of public\r\nopinion, the risk of a vote of want of confidence, and the prospects of\r\nthe next election.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[327:1] For a collection of instances from 1807 to 1874 see Todd, \"Parl.\r\nGovt. in England,\" I., 422-28, 449-50.\r\n\r\n[327:2] In the year 1904, for example, there were three motions clearly\r\nof this character. The first two (in favour of paying unskilled\r\ngovernment workmen the standard rate of wages, and against granting\r\npermits for the vivisection of dogs) did not come to a vote; while the\r\nthird (calling upon the government to encourage cotton growing in\r\nAfrica) was agreed to without a division.\r\n\r\n[328:1] It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between censure of past\r\naction, and a direction for the future; but, if we exclude votes\r\nindirectly implying censure, by a reduction of an appropriation, or an\r\nadjournment of the House, the only instances since 1886 where a vote\r\nrelating in express terms to either of these things has been carried\r\nagainst the opposition of the government, have been as follows: On June\r\n12, 1888, a resolution was adopted that redundant officials ought to be\r\ntransferred to other departments, although a Royal Commission was\r\nalready considering the subject. On April 30, 1889, a vote was passed\r\ncondemning the Indian fiscal system for encouraging the opium trade; and\r\nanother vote to the same effect was carried, on going into the Committee\r\nof Supply on April 10, 1891. A commission appointed by the government\r\nreported in favour of the existing system which was thereupon\r\nmaintained. (Com. Papers, 1894, LX., 583; LXI.; LXII.; 1895, XLII., 31\r\n_et seq._; _cf._ 1892, LVIII.; and 1893, LXVI.) Finally, on June 3,\r\n1893, it was voted that the examinations for the Indian Civil Service\r\nought to be held in India as well as in England; but, after collecting\r\nthe opinions of Indian officials, which were almost wholly adverse to\r\nthe change, the government decided not to make it (Com. Papers, 1893,\r\nLXIV., 869; 1894, LX., 1), and so informed the House, Hans. 4 Ser.\r\nXXIV., 1537.\r\n\r\n[330:1] Cf. Dupriez, _Les Ministres_, II., 440-45.

Those three were negatived\r\nby an oral vote, and were not pushed to an actual division. In the next\r\nfive years, up to the adoption of the Standing Order of 1882, the\r\nmotions numbered sixty-four, and only eighteen of them were withdrawn,\r\nwhile twelve (one in 1878, seven in 1881, and four in 1882) were pushed\r\nto a division. For these and many other facts relating to these motions\r\nto adjourn I am indebted to my students at Harvard, Messrs. O. M.\r\nDickerson and E.

In 1903 there were only three of them, and\r\nin 1904 seven; but in 1905, when Mr. Balfour's cabinet was manifestly\r\nlosing its hold upon the country, the number rose to nine. Incidentally\r\nthe change of rule has tended to shift the debates on those motions into\r\nthe time reserved for private members, for the debate must occur at the\r\nevening sitting, and in the earlier part of the session two of the four\r\nevening sittings belong to the private members.\r\n\r\n[337:1] May, 264-65, 286.\r\n\r\n[337:2] _E.g._ Hans. 4 Ser.

With this may be contrasted the\r\nReport of the Select Committee on Procedure in Supply in 1888 (Com.\r\nPapers, 1888, XII., 27), which said that the debates on the estimates\r\nwere an effective means, both of criticising the administration and of\r\ncontrolling expenditure. It expressed the opinion that although the\r\nestimates were not often actually reduced, the discussion prevented\r\nfuture extravagance. For the condition at the present day see the Report\r\nof the Committee on National Expenditure, and the evidence thereto\r\nannexed (Com.

Papers, 1888, XII., 27). A list of those from 1887\r\nthrough 1901 in Appendix 1, of the first report of the Committee on\r\nNational Expenditure (Com. Papers, 1902, VII., 15. _Cf._ Return of\r\nDivisions in Supply, 1891-1901. Com. Papers, 1902, LXXXII., 139). There\r\nwere eighteen reductions in the twenty years covered by the earlier\r\nreport, eleven in the fourteen years next following. Of those eleven,\r\nfour were cases where estimates were withdrawn by the government (two of\r\nthem supplementary estimates, afterward voted as regular estimates for\r\nthe next year), three were reductions moved by the government because\r\nthe expenditure had become unnecessary, another was a reduction accepted\r\nby the government, two more were the two cases mentioned in the text,\r\nand the remaining one was moved to call attention to a grievance, _i.e._\r\nthe number of rooms in the Parliament buildings occupied by officers of\r\nthe House. This last case, together with the reduction of the salary of\r\nthe Secretary of State for War (which occurred in 1895, but is not\r\nmentioned in the list), is described hereafter in the text.\r\n\r\n[348:1] The vote was 141 to 130. (Hans. 4 Ser. CXXXI., 1141-50.)\r\n\r\n[348:2] The vote was 199 to 196. (Hans. 4 Ser.

What is more, it is small, and markedly\r\nsmaller than in the past. In the decade beginning with 1868, ninety-four\r\ngovernment bills on the average became law each year, but of late the\r\nnumber has not been half so large, and private members' bills have\r\nfallen off in about the same proportion. The fact is that a growth in\r\nthe number of members who want to take part in debate, a more minute\r\ncriticism, and a more systematic opposition, have made the process of\r\npassing a bill through the House increasingly difficult. This is\r\nparticularly true of measures that are long or complicated, for the\r\ngreater the length the more the pegs on which to hang amendments.[356:1]\r\nNow the difficulty of passing laws has had an effect both on the form of\r\nthe statutes and on the content of legislation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Drafting of Bills.]\r\n\r\nA public bill introduced by a private member may be drafted by him, or\r\nby counsel he has employed for the purpose. There is no systematic\r\nsupervision over such bills,[356:2] no stage at which their drafting is\r\nreviewed, and whether well or ill drawn, they are not likely to be much\r\nimproved in their passage through Parliament. Government bills, on the\r\nother hand, which relate to England, and are not of a purely formal and\r\nroutine character,[356:3] are now all drafted by the Parliamentary\r\nCounsel to the Treasury, or by his assistants under his\r\ndirection.[357:1] They are prepared under instructions from, and after\r\nconsultations with, the departments concerned, and are sometimes recast\r\nseveral times before they are introduced into Parliament. They are then\r\nassailed by a host of critics, both in and out of the Houses; some of\r\nthem trying to pick flaws in a measure which they want to destroy; while\r\nothers, who are not opposed to the general principle involved, discover\r\nprovisions that affect their interests, based, perhaps, on local custom\r\nor privilege. The objections raised may not have been entirely foreseen,\r\nor may prove of greater political importance than was supposed, and\r\nhence amendments and new clauses are adopted during the debates in\r\ncommittee. These changes are usually made with the consent of the\r\nminister in charge of the bill, and the Parliamentary Counsel, as well\r\nas the permanent head of the department concerned, is often present\r\nunder the gallery to give his advice; but still the amendments mar the\r\nfair handicraft of the draftsman, and an effort has to be made to\r\nimprove the text either on the report stage or in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defects of Form.]\r\n\r\nSir Courtenay Ilbert attributes the defects of form in the English\r\nstatutes of the present day chiefly to the battering that a bill must\r\nalmost necessarily encounter in passing through the House of Commons,\r\nand to the fact that an Act of Parliament is essentially a creature of\r\ncompromise.[357:2] Yet there would seem to be other difficulties arising\r\nfrom the conditions under which legislation is conducted.\r\n\r\nThe Parliamentary Counsel's office has certainly improved the statutes\r\nvery much by making them more concise, uniform and orderly; but their\r\nform is far from perfect. Two objects must be aimed at in drafting an\r\nact; one that it shall be intelligible to the persons who are compelled\r\nto obey it; and the other that the courts which interpret it, or the\r\ncounsel who are called upon to advise upon it, shall be able to\r\nascertain its precise meaning with certainty. Now to a layman, and even\r\nto a foreign lawyer, an English act is often difficult to understand,\r\nand sometimes misleading. To penetrate its intent one must frequently be\r\nfamiliar with all previous legislation on the subject. It is no doubt\r\ntrue that \"No statute is completely intelligible as an isolated\r\nenactment. Every statute is a chapter, or a fragment of a chapter, of a\r\nbody of law.\"[358:1] Still it does not seem necessary that English acts\r\nshould be quite so obscure as they often are. Nor, judging from the\r\namount of litigation that sometimes occurs over their interpretation,\r\ndoes this defect appear to be always counterbalanced by remarkable legal\r\ncertainty. The most celebrated case is that of the Education Act of\r\n1902. After the provision for the payment of religious instruction in\r\nthe church schools out of local rates had provoked dogged resistance,\r\nand the magistrates had enforced it against recalcitrant rate-payers for\r\na couple of years, the matter was brought before the higher courts by\r\nthe refusal of the County Council for the West Riding of Yorkshire to\r\nmake the payment; and the majority of the Court of Appeal was of opinion\r\nthat the statute did not oblige it to do so.[358:2] The House of Lords\r\nreversed the decision;[358:3] but for Parliament to pass the Act in such\r\na form that the Court of Appeal could regard it as failing to effect\r\nwhat everybody knew to be one of its main objects is surely an amazing\r\nexample of bad drafting. Nor was this the result of amendments in the\r\nHouse of Commons, for the provision in question went through unchanged;\r\nand although in this case the fault is said not to lie at the door of\r\nthe Parliamentary Counsel, it shows none the less the defects of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Defects Arise;]\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked that the limited capacity of Parliament\r\nfor law-making affects both the form and the content of its acts; and\r\nthis is one of many elements in a complex problem. The lack of time for\r\ncomprehensive legislation, the political temperament of the nation, and\r\nthe exigencies of a responsible ministry have each a marked influence on\r\nthe form and the substance of the statutes; and, indeed, all these\r\nfactors act and react upon one another.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: from Difficulty of Legislating;]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of passing long or complicated measures makes the\r\nminister insist that his bill shall be as short as possible,[359:1] and\r\nhence it must include no clauses not absolutely necessary for the object\r\nhe has in view. The draftsman, therefore, disturbs existing statutes as\r\nlittle as he can, either in the way of revising or incorporating their\r\nprovisions. If he must embody earlier enactments in his draft, he does\r\nso by referring to them, rather than by repeating them.[359:2] The\r\npractice of legislation by reference, which is a source of no small\r\ninconvenience in using the statutes, has been carried very far. In fact\r\nthere is a long series of \"Clauses Acts\" on various subjects, not\r\nenacted with an independent legislative force of their own, but placed\r\non the statute book as standard provisions to be embodied in subsequent\r\nacts by reference express or implied.[359:3] The desire to have the bill\r\nshort has also given a strong impulse to the practice of removing\r\ndetails from the body of the act, and massing them in schedules at its\r\nclose.[359:4] This is an advantage to the minister who has charge of the\r\nbill, because while it does not withdraw the matters in the schedules\r\nfrom the control of the House, it does make them less conspicuous and\r\nconcentrates the attention of the members on the principal questions of\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: from Political Temperament;]\r\n\r\nA similar result, although one that concerns more directly the substance\r\nthan the form of the statutes, may be traced to a conservative\r\ntradition in legislation. It is commonly said that in industrial matters\r\nEnglishmen do not appreciate the value of the scrap-heap, that they tend\r\nto use old-fashioned machinery when it would be better to discard it\r\naltogether. If they dislike to abandon a machine, they have a still\r\ngreater aversion to repealing an Act of Parliament. Every Briton happily\r\nbelieves that it is better to readjust the institutions of a country\r\nslowly, than to pull them down and build anew; and there being no line\r\nbetween the institutions that are fundamental, and those that are not, a\r\nfragment of the veneration for the British Constitution attaches to\r\nevery statute; and, indeed, to custom also. This helps to make the\r\nlegislator cautious, and his work tentative. Moreover, there is a great\r\nrespect for vested rights, and for that matter for vested habits, and\r\nsometimes vested abuses. Sir Courtenay Ilbert tells us how much\r\nsolicitude is aroused by the probable effect of a bill on the peculiar\r\ncircumstances of the parish of Ockley-cum-Withypool, or the emoluments\r\nof the beadle of Little Peddlington.[360:1] Too much attention seems to\r\nbe paid at times to such interests when they conflict with those of the\r\npublic; and this brings up the third factor in the problem, that of\r\ncabinet responsibility, which has a marked influence on both the form\r\nand the content of legislation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reform-sponsibility of Ministers.]\r\n\r\nIf the parliamentary system, as it has developed in England, intrusts\r\nthe active conduct of legislation and administration to the ministry of\r\nthe day, and thereby concentrates enormous political power in the hands\r\nof a few men, it does so among a highly individualistic people. The\r\nministers wield their great authority on two conditions. One is that\r\nthey must retain an absolute hold upon their own majority, and the other\r\nis that their rule must be tempered by liberty of criticism. They must\r\nexplain everything they do, they must defend it against the attacks of\r\nthe whole House, and justify it to the satisfaction of almost all their\r\nfollowers. The result is that they try to bring into their measures\r\nnothing that might furnish a needless target for critics, or prove a\r\ncause of offence to any of their supporters.\r\n\r\nRestraint, in some form, is the price paid for power; and great strength\r\nin one direction is apt to conceal weakness in another. An English\r\nministry with a good majority at its back appears omnipotent. It\r\nannounces its policy, forces through its bills against the protests of\r\nthe Opposition, and even against appeals from members on its own side\r\nnot to put pressure upon them. But the power it exerts is in large part\r\nthe resultant of other forces less openly displayed. If, on pain of\r\ndisloyalty, and for fear of handing the government over to the\r\nadversary, the private adherent of the party in power must follow the\r\nwhips in critical divisions, the ministers, on their part, are sometimes\r\ncompelled by an insistent group of their supporters to adopt one\r\nmeasure, or to mutilate or abandon another. They cannot disregard the\r\nserious objections of any considerable section of their own followers,\r\nand this has become more and more true with the evolution of the\r\nparliamentary system. Half a century ago they might win as many votes\r\nfrom the other side of the House as they lost on their own, but that is\r\nrarely possible to-day. They must now carry with them on every question\r\nsubstantially the whole of their party.[361:1] Their omnipotence is\r\ntherefore a very limited and cautious omnipotence, and this has shown\r\nitself, especially under the late Conservative government, in the meagre\r\nannual production of statutes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revision and Codification of Statutes.]\r\n\r\nIf the legislation of a country is to consist, not in passing\r\ncomprehensive laws dealing with a whole subject, but in making\r\nprogressive changes by tinkering and patching the existing acts, it\r\nwould seem an obvious convenience to issue from time to time new\r\neditions of those acts compiled in a more compact and intelligible form.\r\nIt would be a great advantage to have frequent revisions or\r\ncodification of the statutes on a subject, not involving a change of\r\nsubstance, but merely a simplification of form. But such a process of\r\nconsolidation has not been common in England. A great deal of labour was\r\nexpended on this object by several commissions during the nineteenth\r\ncentury; but the only positive results have been the production of two\r\neditions of revised statutes--being simply the statutes at large\r\nrearranged with the parts no longer in force omitted--and the passage of\r\na limited number of acts consolidating the statutes on certain\r\nsubjects.[362:1] Such acts are not easy to pass, because, as Sir\r\nCourtenay Ilbert remarks, \"It is difficult to disabuse the average\r\nmember of Parliament of the notion that the introduction of a\r\nconsolidation bill affords a suitable opportunity for proposing\r\namendments, to satisfy him that reenactment does not mean approval or\r\nperpetuation of the existing law, or to convince him that attempts to\r\ncombine substantial amendment with consolidation almost inevitably spell\r\nfailure in both.\"[362:2] The process has neither been extended to so\r\nmany subjects, nor repeated at such short intervals, as might be wished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Temporary Laws.]\r\n\r\nAnother curious result of the difficulty of enacting laws may be seen in\r\nthe long list of temporary statutes, continued in force from time to\r\ntime, sometimes for many years. Some of these are acts of a transitory\r\nnature, designed to cover an emergency, or to deal with an ephemeral\r\nstate of things. Laws of that kind expire with the conditions that\r\ncalled them forth. But the English temporary acts often relate to\r\npermanent matters. That a statute of an experimental character should be\r\nenacted at the outset for a limited period is natural enough, but when\r\nthe period has come to an end, and the experiment has proved a success,\r\none would expect to see the law reenacted in an enduring form. In\r\nEngland, however, there is passed every year an Expiring Laws\r\nContinuance Act, giving another twelve-month's lease of life to a list\r\nof acts appended in a schedule, many of which are already old. One or\r\ntwo have already reached the age of threescore years and ten; and among\r\nthe list are still found the Ballot Act of 1872, with most of the\r\nstatutes of the last half century that regulate the conduct of\r\nelections. The reason for the existence of perpetual temporary laws is\r\nto be found, no doubt, in the fact that in this form they can be\r\ncontinued almost without opposition, while an attempt to enact them as\r\npermanent statutes would give rise to great debates with a host of\r\namendments, and consume a vast deal of the one thing whereof the\r\nministry has never enough--that is time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Delegation of Legislative Power.]\r\n\r\nThe limited capacity of Parliament to pass statutes is not felt as a\r\npressing evil, because the period of great remedial legislation is over.\r\nThe transition from the political and industrial conditions of the\r\neighteenth century has been accomplished, and the consequent change in\r\nlaws and institutions has been, in the main, effected. The demand for\r\nradical legislation is, therefore, comparatively small, and for the time\r\nat least the process of making law can afford to run slow. Yet it may be\r\ndoubted whether, with the great extension in the sphere of government,\r\nParliament could be suffered to move at its present pace were it not for\r\nthe growing practice of delegating legislative power. We hear much talk\r\nabout the need for a devolution of the power of Parliament on\r\nsubordinate representative bodies, but the tendency is not mainly in\r\nthat direction. The authority of this kind vested in the county councils\r\nby recent statutes is small, too small to affect the question. The real\r\ndelegation has been in favour of the administrative departments of the\r\ncentral government, and this involves a striking departure from\r\nAnglo-Saxon traditions, with a distinct approach to the practice of\r\ncontinental countries.[363:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Statutory Orders.]\r\n\r\nFormerly an English statute went into great detail, attempting to\r\nprovide expressly for every question that could possibly arise. Its\r\ninterpretation, or its applicability to a special case, could be\r\ndetermined only by the courts, while its defects could be remedied, or\r\nits omissions filled up, only by another statute. It contained in itself\r\nthe complete expression of the legislative will. But of late it has\r\nbecome more and more common for Parliament to embody in a statute only\r\ngeneral provisions, and give to some public department a power to make\r\nregulations for completing the details, and applying the act to\r\nparticular cases. These regulations--known as statutory orders--cover a\r\ngreat variety of subjects, and govern not only the duties of officials,\r\nand the administration of public affairs, both national and local, but\r\nalso the conduct of individuals in the management of their own concerns.\r\nThey prescribe, for example, how many persons can live on canal-boats,\r\nthe number of cubic feet of air in factories, the precautions that must\r\nbe taken for cleanliness in dairies, what per cent of water may be\r\ncontained in genuine butter, and under an authority of this kind a\r\ngeneral order was issued in 1900 for muzzling all the dogs in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Control of Parliament over Provisional Orders.]\r\n\r\nParliament usually attempts to retain a control, or at least an\r\noversight, of the orders made by the public departments under the\r\nauthority delegated to them in this way. Sometimes the order is issued\r\nunder a power that is provisional only, and does not become operative\r\nuntil confirmed by a statute. This is usually, though not\r\ninvariably,[364:1] true of rights granted to private companies or local\r\nauthorities to construct works of public utility, such as waterworks,\r\ngas-works, tramways, and the like.[364:2] Provisional orders of that\r\nkind do not involve any true delegation of legislative power, because\r\nthey derive their validity, not from the act of the department, but from\r\nthe statutes by which they are confirmed; and they are included among\r\nthe Acts of Parliament, and not the statutory orders of the year.\r\nPractically, however, they are almost always confirmed without\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Over Statutory Orders.]\r\n\r\nParliamentary control over statutory orders strictly so called, which\r\ninvolve a real delegation of legislative power, is commonly maintained\r\nby requiring them to be reported to the two Houses; and in order to give\r\nan opportunity for preliminary criticism, the regulation, or a draft\r\nthereof, must sometimes be laid on the table for a certain time before\r\nit becomes operative.[365:1] Moreover, control by Parliament is often\r\nexpressly reserved by providing that if, within forty days, either House\r\npresents an address to the Crown against a draft or order, then the\r\norder shall not be made, or in case it has already gone into effect it\r\nshall thenceforth be void.[365:2] An address under such a provision is\r\nexempted from the rule about the interruption of business in the House\r\nof Commons, and hence can be moved by a private member at the close of\r\nthe sitting on any evening, without taking his chance in drawing lots,\r\nor appealing to the government for a part of its time.[365:3] As a\r\nmatter of fact, motions of this kind are uncommon, and are rarely, if\r\never, successful; although the frequency with which the statutory orders\r\nare revised by the departments would seem to show that the officials who\r\nmake them are highly sensitive to outside opinion.\r\n\r\nSince 1893 the statutory orders of each year have been regularly\r\npublished like the Acts of Parliament;[365:4] and an idea of their\r\nnumber may be derived from the fact that they always fill one, and often\r\ntwo, large volumes, each much thicker than the present emaciated book of\r\nthe Public General Acts.[366:1] In spite of the potential control\r\nretained by the Houses over statutory orders, the growing habit of\r\ndelegating authority to make them involves a substantial transfer of\r\npower from Parliament to the executive branch of the government, a\r\ntransfer due in part to the increasing difficulty in legislation.\r\n\r\nThe existing relation between the cabinet and the House of Commons has\r\nthus had a number of distinct, and at first sight contradictory,\r\neffects. While placing the initiative for almost all important\r\nlegislation in the hands of the ministers, it has tended to reduce the\r\nnumber and completeness of the laws they can carry through; and on the\r\nother hand it has helped to invest them with a power of subordinate or\r\nsecondary legislation quite foreign to English traditions. This is true\r\nof public matters, but in regard to private and local acts the relation\r\nof the cabinet to Parliament, and hence the effects of that relation,\r\nare wholly different.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[356:1] _Cf._ Ilbert, \"Legislative Methods and Forms,\" 217.\r\n\r\n[356:2] Ilbert, _Ibid._, 90-91.

Measures, for example, touching matters of general interest\r\naffecting the whole metropolis have been passed as public bills; and\r\nthis has been true to a smaller extent of other places; while bills\r\nregulating affairs of less importance for those very areas have been\r\ntreated as private. In fact the same subject has at different times been\r\ndealt with by public and private bills; the question which procedure\r\nshould be followed depending upon the uncertain standard of the degree\r\nin which the public interest was involved.[368:1] With these exceptions\r\nit may be said that every bill introduced for the benefit of any person,\r\ncompany or locality, is, for the purposes of procedure, a private bill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Procedure on Private Bills.]\r\n\r\nThe standing orders that govern procedure upon private bills are much\r\nmore elaborate and comprehensive than those relating to public bills.\r\nThey fill in print five times as many pages; and although custom and\r\nprecedent play an important part, still the printed rules approach very\r\nnearly to a code of private bill procedure.[368:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Petition and Notice.]\r\n\r\nBefore a private bill is introduced, a petition therefor is drawn up,\r\nand in order to give any one interested an opportunity to prepare his\r\nobjections, notice of the petition must be given, in October or\r\nNovember, in _The Gazette_, in appropriate local newspapers, and in some\r\ncases by posters upon the roadside. Personal notice must also be served\r\nin December upon the owners of land directly affected, and if the\r\npetition is for leave to build a tramway, the consent of the local\r\nauthority must be obtained.[369:1] Plans of the work proposed must also\r\nbe deposited for inspection both at Westminster and with some local\r\nofficer.[369:2] The petition, with the bill itself, must be filed on or\r\nbefore Dec. 17 in the Private Bill Office of the House, and a copy must\r\nbe delivered to the Treasury, the Local Government Board, the Post\r\nOffice, and to any other department whose duties relate to the subject\r\ninvolved.[369:3] The petitioner is also required to file estimates of\r\ncost, and to deposit a sum equal to four or five per cent. of the\r\nproposed expenditures as a guarantee fund for the benefit of persons who\r\nmay be injured by a commencement, and failure to complete, the\r\nwork.[369:4]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Examiners of Petitions.]\r\n\r\nThe next step is to make sure that these preliminary regulations have\r\nbeen obeyed. It is done by paid officers of the House called Examiners\r\nof Petitions for Private Bills,[369:5] and since 1855 the two Houses\r\nhave appointed the same persons to that post, so that the process is\r\ngone through only once.[369:6] The petitioner must prove before the\r\nexaminer that he has complied with the standing orders; and any person\r\naffected has a right to be heard on the question, if he has filed a\r\nmemorial of his intention to appear. The examiner certifies that the\r\nstanding orders have been followed, or reports in what respect they have\r\nbeen disregarded.[369:7]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Legislative and Judicial Aspects of the Procedure.]\r\n\r\nPrivate bill procedure has both a legislative and a judicial aspect. The\r\nfinal aim being the passage of an act, a private bill goes through all\r\nthe stages of a public bill, and the records of its progress appear in\r\nthe journals of the House. But the procedure is also regarded as a\r\ncontroversy between the promoters and opponents of the measure, and this\r\ninvolves an additional process of a judicial character. For that purpose\r\nthe full records of the case are preserved in the Private Bill Office,\r\nwhere they are open to public inspection. The preliminary steps already\r\ndescribed are intended chiefly to prepare the case for the judicial\r\ntrial, and to give opponents a chance to make ready their defence. They\r\ncorrespond to the pleadings in the clerk's office of a court; and they\r\nare conducted by a parliamentary agent who performs the duties of a\r\nsolicitor in a law suit.[370:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Introduction of the Bill.]\r\n\r\nThe preliminaries over, the bill is ready to be introduced, and the\r\nfirst thing is to arrange in which House it shall begin its career. This\r\nis decided at a conference between the Chairmen of Committees of the two\r\nHouses, or in practice by the gentlemen who act as their legal advisers,\r\nthe Counsel to Mr. Speaker and the Counsel to the Lord Chairman of\r\nCommittees.[370:2] All these proceedings take place before the usual\r\ndate for the meeting of Parliament, so that when it assembles the bills\r\ncan be brought in at once.[370:3]\r\n\r\nIf the examiner reports that the standing orders have been complied\r\nwith, the bill is presented forthwith by being laid upon the table of\r\nthe House. If not, his report is referred to the Committee on Standing\r\nOrders, composed of eleven members chosen by the House itself at the\r\nopening of the session.[371:1] This committee reports whether the\r\nomission is of such a nature that under the circumstances it ought to be\r\nexcused or not; and the report is almost always adopted by the House. In\r\ncase the omission is excused the bill is presented by being laid upon\r\nthe table; and every bill is deemed when presented to have been read a\r\nfirst time.[371:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second Reading.]\r\n\r\nOn the next stage, the second reading, a debate may take place upon the\r\ngeneral principle involved, and a bill is sometimes rejected at this\r\npoint, either because it is inconsistent with public policy, or because\r\nopponents whose interests are involved have been able to persuade a\r\nmajority of the members to vote against it. Instructions to the\r\ncommittee about the provisions to be inserted in the bill can also be\r\nadopted at that time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Private Bill Committees.]\r\n\r\nThe committee stage of the bill, for the consideration of its provisions\r\nin detail, is devolved upon a private bill committee. Here takes place\r\nthe judicial process, or trial of the controversy between conflicting\r\ninterests, which presents the peculiar feature of the English procedure.\r\nUntil near the middle of the nineteenth century the committees for\r\nprivate bills were made up on the same principle as select committees on\r\nother matters. They consisted in large part of supporters and opponents\r\nof the measure. But in 1837 the Lords began to form their private bill\r\ncommittee of a small number of wholly impartial members,--a practice\r\nwhich was adopted by the Commons for railway bills in 1844, and for all\r\nother private bills in 1855.[371:3] The system of committees in the two\r\nHouses is now very much the same,[372:1] the order of proceeding in the\r\nCommons being as follows: All opposed private bills, except those\r\nrelating to railways and canals, divorce, and police and sanitary\r\nmatters, are referred under the rules to the Committee of Selection,\r\nwhich divides them into groups and refers each group to a separate\r\ncommittee, consisting of a chairman and three members not locally or\r\notherwise interested, all of whom it appoints for the purpose.[372:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Railway and Canal Bills.]\r\n\r\nIn order to secure greater uniformity in the private acts relating to\r\nrailways, a general committee on railway and canal bills was created in\r\n1854.[372:3] It is appointed every year by the Committee of Selection,\r\nand to it are referred all bills of that kind. But it does not take\r\ncharge of them itself. It merely divides them into groups, and then acts\r\nas a chairman's panel; that is, it refers the bills to separate\r\ncommittees, the chairman of which it selects from its own ranks, the\r\nother three members being appointed by the Committee of\r\nSelection.[372:4]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Police and Sanitary Bills.]\r\n\r\nWith the same object of obtaining uniformity, all bills promoted by\r\nlocal authorities for police and sanitary purposes were referred after\r\n1881 to a single committee. In this case, however, the bills were not\r\ntoo numerous to be considered by the committee itself, although to\r\nrelieve pressure it was, in 1892, enlarged to eleven members, and\r\nauthorised to bisect itself for the more rapid despatch of business.\r\nCuriously enough the committee was discontinued for some years, but,\r\nafter loud complaints about exceptional powers granted by private acts,\r\nit was revived by sessional order in 1903, and intrusted with all police\r\nand sanitary bills which contain powers \"in conflict with, deviation\r\nfrom, or excess of, the general law.\"[373:1]\r\n\r\nA committee on divorce bills is still provided for in the rules, but\r\nsince the power of granting divorces in England and Scotland has been\r\nentirely transferred to the courts, bills of this kind have become rare.\r\nWhile the various private bill committees are thus formed in slightly\r\ndifferent ways, their mode of dealing with the measures that come before\r\nthem is the same.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Locus Standi._]\r\n\r\nThe bills referred to these committees have been described as \"opposed,\"\r\nbut that implies an opponent, and means, not an objector in the House,\r\nbut an outside contestant on the basis of interest, for the chief object\r\nof these committees is a judicial hearing of opposing parties. If there\r\nis no opponent, so that the question is solely whether the privileges\r\nsought are consistent with the public welfare, the bill is said to be\r\nunopposed, and goes through quite a different procedure to be described\r\nhereafter. Plainly, therefore, the question who may oppose a bill, and\r\non what grounds, is of vital importance. A person who enjoys the right\r\nis said to have a _locus standi_; and the first question to be decided\r\nis whether an opponent does or does not have it.\r\n\r\nNow, any one who wishes to oppose a bill must, on or before Feb. 12,\r\nfile a petition in the Private Bill Office, stating the ground of his\r\nobjection,[373:2] and if the promoters contest his right to\r\nappear,[373:3] the question of _locus standi_ is decided by the Court of\r\nReferees, consisting of the Chairman of Ways and Means, the Deputy\r\nChairman, and not less than seven members of the House appointed by the\r\nSpeaker. The Counsel to Mr. Speaker assists the court, but sits now only\r\nas an assessor.[373:4] The principal divergence in the procedure of the\r\ntwo Houses arises at this point, for questions of _locus standi_ are\r\ndetermined in the House of Lords by the committee that considers the\r\nbill; and there is some difference of opinion about the relative merits\r\nof the two systems.[374:1] In both Houses the decisions are governed\r\npartly by express provisions in the standing orders,[374:2] and partly\r\nby precedents that have hardened into rules.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grounds of _Locus Standi_.]\r\n\r\nIn order to have a _locus standi_, an opponent must, as a rule, show\r\nthat the bill may affect his property or business. He must prove a\r\npersonal interest distinct from that of the rest of the community.\r\nMoreover, it is a general principle that, except on the ground of some\r\nspecial injury to themselves, both individuals and public boards are\r\nprecluded from opposing before a private bill committee a public body on\r\nwhich they are represented. If, for example, a borough proposes to\r\nconstruct and work a tramway, an omnibus company has a right to be heard\r\nin opposition, but a rate-payer who believes that the plan will be\r\nfinancially disastrous has not.[374:3]\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, unnecessary to describe here all the kinds of private\r\ninterest that will furnish a _locus standi_.[374:4] But in general, it\r\nmay be said that the right is enjoyed by all persons whose land is to be\r\ncompulsorily taken; by the owners and occupiers of buildings along the\r\nline of a proposed tramway; by traders affected by the tolls, fares, or\r\nrates proposed;[374:5] by public authorities; and sometimes by\r\ninhabitants acting on behalf of a county, town, or district, that is or\r\nmay be affected. Competition, also, is a ground for _locus standi_,\r\nalthough the right to appear is usually confined to monopolies, to\r\norganisations that represent the trade as a whole, or to individuals\r\nwhose business is important enough to represent that trade;[375:1]\r\nmoreover the privilege is extended by the standing orders to chambers of\r\nagriculture, commerce or shipping.[375:2] While, therefore, the rules of\r\n_locus standi_ are not perfectly logical, they are distinctly based upon\r\nprivate interest, individual or collective, and not upon the general\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hearing before the Committee.]\r\n\r\nThe hearing of the parties before the committee follows the pattern of a\r\ntrial in a court of law, even to the standing of the counsel employed.\r\nUp to this point the parties have been represented by parliamentary\r\nagents, who, although not necessarily attorneys or solicitors, hold a\r\nsimilar position, and must be registered in the Private Bill\r\nOffice.[375:3] The actual hearings, however, like trials in court, are\r\nconducted by barristers. The fees, which are large, attract a high order\r\nof talent, and in fact the practice before private bill committees has\r\nbecome almost a distinct branch of the profession, the counsel who\r\npursue it being known as the parliamentary bar.[375:4] The proceedings\r\nare strictly judicial in form, the barristers examining and\r\ncross-examining the witnesses and making the arguments in the ordinary\r\nway. Moreover, if either party has vexatiously subjected the other to\r\nexpense, the committee can award costs like a court of law, and this is\r\noccasionally done.[375:5]\r\n\r\nThe first thing taken up is the preamble, the hearing upon this\r\ninvolving the general merits of the bill, so that if the committee is\r\nof opinion that promoters have failed to prove that part of their case,\r\nit reports at once against the bill. Otherwise the clauses are taken up\r\nin order, and the committee reports the bill with or without amendments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Committee and Public Policy.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the peculiar function of the committee consists in passing upon\r\nthe conflicting claims of the parties that appear before it, the\r\nquestion whether the public welfare will be promoted by the enactment of\r\nthe bill must be considered also. This is, of course, one of the chief\r\nthings that the promoters must prove; but the committee seeks no\r\nevidence on its own account, nor can it permit a private person who has\r\nno _locus standi_ to address it on the subject. In the interest of\r\npublic policy, however, some safeguards have been devised. In the first\r\nplace the standing orders direct that in various classes of measures\r\ncertain provisions must be inserted. These relate to such matters as the\r\nlevel of roads, grade crossings, the amount of mortgages, the time for\r\ncompleting works, deposits to secure completion, minimum rates of fare,\r\nthe application of general railway acts, leaving open spaces for\r\nrecreation in enclosure bills, and the erection in London of new\r\nworkmen's dwellings to replace others that are torn down. In some cases\r\nalso the committee must report specially any unusual provisions\r\ncontained in the bill, notably in relation to the borrowing powers of\r\nlocal authorities.\r\n\r\nMoreover, on some questions the committee has the benefit of advice from\r\npublic officials. That private bills must be filed with one or more of\r\nthe public departments has already been pointed out. In a few cases the\r\ndepartments are directed to submit to Parliament a report upon the\r\nbill,[376:1] and they are always at liberty to do so. Under the rules\r\nthese communications are referred to the committees,[376:2] which are\r\nrequired to notice in their reports the recommendations of the\r\ndepartments, and state the reasons for dissent where they have not been\r\nfollowed.[376:3] Occasionally, representatives of the departments\r\nappear before the committees;[377:1] and, what is more important, a\r\ngeneral oversight of private bill legislation, with the right to make\r\nsuggestions, is maintained by the officers of the Houses.[377:2] This is\r\nespecially true of the Counsel to Mr. Speaker, and of the Chairman of\r\nCommittees and his counsel in the House of Lords; but the question how\r\neffective their supervision is must be deferred until the results of the\r\nsystem are discussed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unopposed Bills.]\r\n\r\nUnopposed bills, that is bills where no adverse petition has been filed,\r\nor where the petitioner has not proved a _locus standi_, do not involve\r\na judicial trial between contestants, but only an examination with a\r\nview to the public interest.[377:3] They are, therefore, referred to\r\nquite a different committee. Until 1903 it consisted of the Chairman, or\r\nDeputy Chairman, of the Committee of Ways and Means, and the Counsel to\r\nMr. Speaker, assisted usually, but not always, by one other member of\r\nthe House.[377:4] The Select Committee of 1902 on Private Business was\r\nof opinion that a body with so much authority ought to be strengthened\r\nby the addition of more members directly responsible to the\r\nHouse,[377:5] and in partial fulfilment of its recommendations the\r\nstanding orders provided in the following year that the Committee on\r\nUnopposed Bills should consist of the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of\r\nWays and Means, of two other members of the House, appointed by the\r\nCommittee of Selection, and of the Counsel to Mr. Speaker.[378:1]\r\n\r\nThe bills having already been read through by the Speaker's Counsel, and\r\nin part by the Chairman of Ways and Means, the committee goes over them\r\nrapidly with the promoters, discussing chiefly such points as have been\r\nraised by the Speaker's Counsel, and by any reports from government\r\ndepartments.[378:2] If any other question should come up involving a new\r\nand important matter of public policy, the Chairman, who was already\r\noverworked, would formerly have avoided the responsibility of deciding\r\nit himself by reporting to the House, as he has power to do,[378:3] that\r\nthe bill ought to be treated as opposed;[378:4] and this although there\r\nwas no one to conduct the opposition.[378:5] One of the objects of\r\nstrengthening the committee was to put it in a position to decide all\r\nsuch questions itself. As a matter of fact the committee often makes\r\namendments in a bill, but seldom reports that it ought not to pass.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Report and Consideration.]\r\n\r\nAfter a bill, whether opposed or not, has been reported, the House, if\r\ndissatisfied, may recommit it either as a whole or with reference to\r\nparticular clauses, and with or without instructions. When this does not\r\nhappen, and it is unusual, the bill, if reported without amendment, and\r\nnot a railway or tramway bill, stands ready for its third reading. If,\r\non the other hand, it has been amended by the committee, or is a railway\r\nor tramway bill, it is ordered to lie upon the table for consideration\r\non report.[378:6] At that stage amendments may be proposed, or a motion\r\nmay be made to recommit, but in order to insure that the standing orders\r\nare complied with, both by the private bill committee and by the House\r\nitself, the consideration cannot take place until the Chairman of Ways\r\nand Means has informed the House that this is the case; nor can any\r\namendments be offered until the Committee on Standing Orders has\r\nreported upon them, if the Chairman thinks it proper that they should do\r\nso.[379:1]\r\n\r\nThe last stage is that of third reading where only verbal amendments are\r\nin order.[379:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Private Bills in the Lords.]\r\n\r\nAfter passing through one House a private bill goes to the other, and\r\nthere is the usual process for reaching an agreement upon amendments. It\r\nis needless to trace here the course of a private bill in the\r\nLords.[379:3] The procedure is essentially the same as in the Commons,\r\nand the only differences of any consequence have already been mentioned\r\nin the text or in the notes. A great deal of discussion has taken place\r\nupon the wisdom of having two separate hearings before the private\r\ncommittees of the two Houses.[379:4] It has been suggested that a second\r\nhearing is needless, and that time and expense would be saved by having\r\na single trial before a joint committee. On the other hand it is urged\r\nthat where a bill is objectionable or defective the second hearing gives\r\na better chance to reject or improve it; and that as a matter of fact\r\nthe parties often accept the decision of the first committee, or\r\ncompromise their differences, only about one third of the bills opposed\r\nin one house being opposed again in the other.[379:5]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Special Procedure for Scotland.]\r\n\r\nThe inconvenience and expense of a trial before a committee in London\r\nled to a strong demand for hearings in Scotland upon private bills\r\nrelating to that kingdom, and in 1899 a statute was enacted for that\r\npurpose.[380:1] The Act and the general orders made in pursuance\r\nthereof, provide that, instead of following the ordinary procedure,\r\npromoters of Scotch private bills shall, in April or December, file a\r\npetition with the Secretary for Scotland for a draft provisional order\r\ndeposited therewith. They must also comply with rules similar to those\r\nin force for private bills about giving notice, and filing copies and\r\nplans with the government departments. The draft order is submitted to\r\nthe Chairmen of Committees of the two Houses. If either of them is of\r\nopinion that it affects interests outside of Scotland, or is of such a\r\ncharacter, or raises such a question of policy, that it ought not to be\r\ndealt with in the new way, then it takes the regular course of an\r\nEnglish private bill. If not, the order follows the new Scotch\r\nprocedure. The two Chairmen assign an examiner to see that the general\r\norders about notice, and other matters, have been observed, the final\r\npower of dispensation in case of non-compliance resting also in their\r\nhands. After these preliminary steps have been taken, the petition is\r\nready to begin its active career.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scotch Private Bill committees.]\r\n\r\nIf the petition is not opposed, the Secretary for Scotland may, after\r\nconsidering the reports of the public departments, make the provisional\r\norder, as prayed for or with amendments. In short, he takes the place of\r\na committee on unopposed private bills. If, on the other hand, he thinks\r\nan inquiry ought to be held, or if the petition is opposed, he sends it\r\nto a commission selected on a curious plan designed to retain the work\r\nas far as possible in parliamentary hands. The difficulty, on one side,\r\nof getting members of Parliament to undertake such a service, and the\r\ndesire, on the other, to retain a close connection with the Houses,\r\nresulted in a compromise between a parliamentary committee and a\r\npermanent commission.[381:1] Each House provides a panel of its own\r\nmembers, that of the Commons consisting of not more than fifteen members\r\nappointed by the Committee of Selection.[381:2] There is also an extra\r\nparliamentary panel of twenty men appointed for a term of five years by\r\nthe two Chairmen and the Secretary for Scotland. The commission upon\r\nevery petition consists of four persons taken from these panels, the\r\nChairmen of Committees selecting two from the panel of each House, if\r\npossible; if not, they appoint as many of the four as they can from the\r\ntwo House panels indiscriminately, the remainder in any case being taken\r\nby the Secretary from the extra parliamentary panel.[381:3] The\r\ncommission so formed holds its sessions, of course, in Scotland,\r\nproceeds like a committee upon an opposed private bill, and has power to\r\ndecide all questions of _locus standi_. It reports to the Secretary\r\nwhether the provisional order should be issued and in what form; and he\r\nacts accordingly.[381:4]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Confirmation by Parliament.]\r\n\r\nThe order of the Secretary, whether opposed or unopposed, is not final,\r\nbut provisional only, and requires confirmation by Parliament. He brings\r\nin a bill to confirm it, and if the order was not opposed in Scotland,\r\nor is not opposed in Parliament, it is treated as if it had already gone\r\nthrough all the stages up to and including committee, and is ordered to\r\nbe considered as if reported from a committee of the House. But the\r\nright of the parties to a hearing in Parliament as the final court of\r\nappeal has been to some extent preserved, for a petition may be\r\npresented against any order that has been opposed, or has been the\r\nsubject of a local inquiry, in Scotland, and in that case a motion may\r\nbe made to refer the bill to a joint committee, which hears the parties\r\nas in the case of an ordinary private bill, but reports to both Houses.\r\nThe question of permitting an appeal to a parliamentary committee in\r\nLondon was much discussed at the time, and the bill as finally passed\r\nreserved the right, limiting it to a single hearing before a joint\r\ncommittee, instead of two hearings before separate committees of each\r\nHouse as in the case of an ordinary private bill. The promoter,\r\nmoreover, as well as the opponent, has a right to appeal to Parliament.\r\nIf his draft order is refused, he may, without going through the other\r\npreliminary steps, file it in the form of a substitute bill in the\r\nproper public office, and proceed with it like a private bill.[382:1]\r\n\r\nThe Scotch procedure has thus the effect of a compulsory arbitration in\r\nScotland, preceding a possible trial at Westminster. It appears,\r\nhowever, that a Scotch confirmation bill is in fact seldom opposed in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ireland and Wales.]\r\n\r\nTwo years after the Scotch statute was passed, similar acts were\r\nproposed for Ireland and for Wales, but neither of them was passed. A\r\nselect committee on a Welsh bill of this kind reported in 1904 that the\r\nScotch procedure as it stood was not adapted to Wales, and that any\r\ndesire in England for a less costly procedure than now existed would\r\nbest be met by an extension of the system of provisional orders. The\r\ncommittee remarked that while most of the witnesses examined thought the\r\nScotch Act had worked well on the whole, some of them believed there had\r\nbeen no saving of expense in the case of large schemes. This was\r\nattributed by the witnesses mainly to the cost of bringing counsel and\r\nexperts from London, and in fact, the evidence showed no little\r\ndifference of opinion about the advantages of the new procedure in\r\nseveral respects.[382:2] In Ireland there is another obstacle to the\r\nadoption of the Scotch Act; for while local hearings on private bills\r\nwould have especial value beyond St. George's Channel, the Nationalists\r\ndo not want any form of devolution that leaves the final management of\r\nIrish affairs in the hands of the British Parliament.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Provisional Orders.]\r\n\r\nThe vast amount of private legislation enacted in England every year is\r\ndue in large measure to the absence of general statutes upon subjects\r\nthat would seem to be ripe for them. Year after year private bills are\r\npassed on the same subject, until a policy is established which might\r\nwell be crystallised into a general law, leaving the controversies that\r\narise in its application to be settled by a body of purely judicial\r\ncharacter; or, as in continental countries, a final power of dealing\r\nwith these matters might, subject to rules fixed by law, be vested in\r\nthe administrative departments. That many costly bills in Parliament\r\nwould be saved by passing appropriate statutes has been\r\nsuggested,[383:1] yet the process goes on slowly, and so far as it has\r\nbeen carried it is for the most part incomplete. During the last fifty\r\nyears central administrative authority in local and other matters has\r\nincreased enormously, but in conferring powers upon public departments\r\nParliament has been reluctant to give up its own ultimate control over\r\nparticular cases. This is especially true of the compulsory sale of land\r\nfor public purposes; for property in land still retains a peculiar\r\nsanctity in England.[383:2]\r\n\r\nParliament has, no doubt, in many cases, delegated to the administrative\r\norgans of the state a final authority to grant special powers to local\r\nbodies or private companies, or at least to sanction their use;[383:3]\r\nbut in other cases the grant must be laid before the Houses, and does\r\nnot go into effect if either of them passes a resolution of\r\ndisapproval.[383:4] Sometimes if opposed,[384:1] and more often whether\r\nopposed or not, the orders conferring the powers must be submitted to\r\nParliament for a formal ratification. This is the origin of provisional\r\norders. They are issued by a government office under the authority of\r\nstatutes, but they are merely provisional until confirmed by Parliament.\r\nExcept the Treasury, the Admiralty, and the Indian and Colonial Offices,\r\nwhich can hardly come into direct touch with local affairs, almost all\r\nthe important departments, and even the county councils, have been given\r\nsome powers of this kind; and they cover all manner of subjects that\r\nwould otherwise be dealt with by private bills.[384:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Procedure upon Provisional Orders.]\r\n\r\nProvisional orders are begun by an application to the department that\r\nhas power to issue them, and although the standing orders do not as a\r\nrule apply to these applications,[384:3] yet, by the enabling acts, or\r\nby the instructions issued by the departments themselves, similar\r\nregulations about notices, deposit of plans, consent of local\r\nauthorities, and so forth, are enforced. The department usually holds,\r\nby means of an inspector, an inquiry on the spot; and either in this or\r\nin some other way objectors who are interested are given a chance to\r\npresent their case. Upon the report of the inspector, and such other\r\ninformation as it obtains, the department decides whether it will make\r\nthe order or not.\r\n\r\nThe orders made are then arranged in groups according to their subjects,\r\nand each group is scheduled to a confirming bill, which is introduced\r\ninto Parliament like a public bill by the minister at the head of the\r\ndepartment. But it is not treated as a public bill, still less as a\r\ngovernment bill.\r\n\r\nThe minister does not try to force it through; he does not put pressure\r\nupon his followers by having the government whips act as tellers in a\r\ndivision. The measure is treated as a group of private bills, except\r\nthat if an order is unopposed an officer of the department appears in\r\nsupport of it before the committee. The bill is read a first time, sent\r\nto the examiner, read a second time and referred to the Committee of\r\nSelection or the Committee on Railway and Canal Bills. Then if no\r\npetition has been filed against any of the orders in the bill it goes to\r\nthe Committee on Unopposed Private Bills; otherwise it goes, with all\r\nthe orders it contains, to an ordinary private bill committee which\r\ngives a hearing in the usual form to the promoters and opponents of the\r\norders that are opposed.[385:1] Finally, the bill goes through the\r\nregular stages in the House.[385:2] In fact the standing orders\r\ndirect[385:3] that provisional order bills, after being reported, shall\r\nbe subject to the same rules as private bills, except so far as the\r\npayment of fees by the promoters is concerned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advantages of Provisional Orders.]\r\n\r\nThe question of fees is a very important matter. It is one of the chief\r\nreasons for resorting to a provisional order; because the fees charged\r\nby the Houses to the promoters of private bills are heavy, and in the\r\ncase of unopposed bills they form a large part of the cost of obtaining\r\nthe act. An unopposed provisional order is, therefore, very much less\r\nexpensive than an unopposed private bill; and although, with the large\r\nfees of counsel and expert witnesses, an opposed order may cost as much\r\nor even more than an opposed bill, it has the benefit of the presumption\r\narising from the action of the department. Moreover, provisional orders,\r\neven if contested before the department, are not commonly opposed in the\r\nHouse. In the four years from 1898 to 1901 less than one tenth of the\r\nprovisional orders were opposed in Parliament, and only one of them\r\nfailed to pass.[386:1] It is, indeed, noteworthy that of the 2520\r\nprovisional orders issued by the Local Government Board from 1872 to\r\n1902 only 23 were rejected by Parliament.[386:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defects of Private Bill Legislation.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Expense.]\r\n\r\nThe system of private bill legislation, like the rest of man's\r\nhandiwork, is not altogether without defects. One of these is the\r\ncostliness of the procedure. A local governing body that wants to do\r\nsome obvious and necessary public duty, such as to take land for the\r\npurpose of a new street or schoolhouse, must go to the expense of\r\ngetting a provisional order; or if the object happens to be one not\r\ncovered by any statute for provisional orders, it must incur the greater\r\ncost of promoting a private bill; and in either case the owner, if\r\ndetermined to fight to the bitter end, can force the expense up to a\r\nconsiderable sum. In the House of Commons there is a fee for almost\r\nevery step that is taken by the promoters of a private bill; the minimum\r\nfees for the various stages in the House itself taken together are never\r\nless than thirty-five pounds, and they increase according to the amount\r\ninvolved, up to four times as much. There is, moreover, a fee of ten\r\npounds for each day that the committee sits, if the promoters appear by\r\ncounsel, and of five pounds if they do not. Fees on a smaller scale are\r\nalso charged to opponents. Altogether the annual receipts of the House\r\nof Commons from private bill legislation average over forty thousand\r\npounds, while its expenses on that account are less than twelve\r\nthousand.[386:3] In the House of Lords the fees are arranged somewhat\r\ndifferently, but they are, on the whole, about as large;[386:4] so that\r\nthe parliamentary charges on the smallest unopposed private bill amount\r\nto over one hundred and ninety pounds. Then there are the expenses of\r\nparliamentary and local agents, of printing, advertising, and, in the\r\ncase of opposed bills, of counsel, witnesses, and experts. Sometimes,\r\nall this makes a very large sum. Birmingham, for example, spent\r\n44,750_l._ in 1892 in promoting a single bill.[387:1]\r\n\r\nThe total amount spent by local authorities in the United Kingdom during\r\nthe seven years from 1892 to 1898 in promoting and opposing private\r\nbills was 1,396,407_l._, while private companies expended for the same\r\npurpose 2,806,813_l._. Adding the smaller sums spent on provisional\r\norders, and those paid out by harbour and dock boards, the grand total\r\nconsumed in private legislation was 4,496,834_l._[387:2] The cost of\r\nopposed bills cannot be materially reduced by Parliament if the present\r\nsystem is to be maintained; and while this is not true of unopposed\r\nbills, it has been argued that high fees are an earnest of good faith\r\nand tend to check private speculation in concessions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neglect of the Public Interest.]\r\n\r\nA second defect in the system is a lack of sufficient attention to the\r\ninterests of the public. As early as 1865 it struck observers that,\r\napart from certain partial safeguards, the public had no friend in this\r\nclass of legislation.[387:3]\r\n\r\nThe fact is that private bill committees are chiefly occupied by a\r\nhearing between conflicting interests, in which a citizen whose only\r\nmotive for appearing is the general welfare has no _locus\r\nstandi_.[387:4] Moreover, they are shifting tribunals, whose decisions\r\nare uncertain, and whose very nature renders a consistent policy\r\nextremely difficult. In fact it is this uncertainty that often causes\r\npromoters to try the chance of a private bill, rather than apply for a\r\nprovisional order on the same subject to a public department that is\r\ntrying to enforce a well-known policy at variance in some respects with\r\nthe powers the promoter is seeking to obtain.\r\n\r\nThe committees are sometimes willing to grant new and unusual powers,\r\nwithout enough regard for the ultimate effect of the precedent they\r\ncreate. This has been specially true in the case of borough councils,\r\nand was a cause of no small complaint before the Committee on Municipal\r\nTrading in 1900.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of the Standing Orders.]\r\n\r\nThere are, indeed, certain means of preserving uniformity of action that\r\nare more or less effective. The first of these are the standing orders,\r\nwhich lay down some rules for the guidance of the committees, and\r\nprescribe a few provisions that must be inserted in certain classes of\r\nbills. They do not, however, go very far.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clauses Acts and Model Bills.]\r\n\r\nThen there are the clauses acts, of various kinds, which are practically\r\nalways incorporated--though not without additions or exceptions--in\r\nprivate bills on the subjects with which they deal. There are, also, the\r\nmodel bills, which have been carefully drawn up as standards for the\r\ncommittees to follow, although they are by no means obliged to do so.\r\nBut all these things tend merely to maintain uniformity in legislation\r\nof a well-recognised type, along familiar lines. They have little effect\r\nin cases where a request is made for new and unusual powers. Cases of\r\nthat kind are not, indeed, wholly without supervision. If a bill deals\r\nwith local police or health, it goes before the Police and Sanitary\r\nCommittee created by the House of Commons for the very purpose of\r\npreserving a consistent policy in such matters, and of no small use in\r\nthat way.[388:1] But this is true only for a very limited class of\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Government Departments.]\r\n\r\nThe only general oversight comes from the government departments, and\r\nthe officers of Parliament. It has already been pointed out that all\r\nprivate bills must be referred to one or more of the departments, and\r\nthat these are sometimes obliged, and always at liberty, to make reports\r\nupon them. The reports go to the private bill committees, which are\r\nrequired to notice the recommendations therein in their own reports to\r\nthe House. The suggestions cannot, therefore, be entirely ignored, but\r\nthe departments have no means of enforcing them. The Home Office is,\r\nindeed, always represented before the Committee on Police and Sanitary\r\nBills,[389:1] but it is rarely asked to attend before others;[389:2]\r\nand, in general, it may be said that for a department to communicate\r\nwith the committees save by its written reports is somewhat\r\nexceptional.[389:3] On novel questions of policy, moreover, the\r\ndepartments seem to follow rather than lead the private bill\r\ncommittees.[389:4]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chairman of Ways and Means.]\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Houses of Parliament have a more effective\r\ninfluence. Under the standing orders of the Commons all private bills\r\nmust be shown to the Chairman of Ways and Means, both before they are\r\nconsidered by a committee and after any amendments have been\r\nmade.[389:5] When sitting in the Committee on Unopposed Bills, he\r\nfrequently requires the agent of the promoters to omit or insert\r\nclauses,[389:6] and occasionally he draws the attention of the chairman\r\nof a private bill committee to an extraordinary provision; but he does\r\nnot feel it his duty to try to secure a general uniformity in private\r\nbills.[389:7] In fact, he is so busy that he can examine personally only\r\na small part of them.[389:8] The appointment of a Deputy Chairman has\r\nbeen an assistance in this way.[389:9] But the work is mainly done by\r\nthe Counsel to Mr. Speaker, who reads all the bills; makes a careful\r\nanalysis of them, noting the reports from the government departments;\r\nsees the agents about any amendments he has to suggest; and calls the\r\nattention of the Chairman of Ways and Means to any matters that may\r\nrequire it.[389:10] Sometimes he is consulted by the chairman of a\r\nprivate bill committee;[390:1] while the paid referee, on account of his\r\nlarge experience, had formerly some influence with the committees.[390:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Lord Chairman.]\r\n\r\nBut by far the most important officer of Parliament in this respect is\r\nthe Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords, the Lord Chairman, as\r\nhe is called. Being less busy with public affairs than the House\r\nChairman, he is able to devote much more time to private bill\r\nlegislation. He examines all the bills, even reading those introduced\r\ninto the House of Commons before the Speaker's Counsel sees them;[390:3]\r\nand he is in constant communication with the Chairman of Ways and Means,\r\nand with the government departments.[390:4] He does not, as a rule, act\r\ndirectly upon the private bill committees,[390:5] but he confers with\r\nthe promoters of the bills or their agents, and explains to them what\r\nchanges he requires them to make. In such cases the promoters usually\r\ncomply with his wishes. In fact they are practically obliged to do so or\r\nwithdraw their bill, because the second and third readings of private\r\nbills in the House of Lords are always moved by the Lord Chairman, who\r\nwould simply refuse to act if his advice were not accepted. Of course,\r\nsome other peer might make the motion and carry it, but this is said to\r\nhave happened only once within living memory.[390:6] The Lord Chairman\r\nexamines provisional orders less thoroughly, and if they contain\r\nobjectionable provisions he confers with the department that is\r\nresponsible for them rather than with the promoters.[390:7]\r\n\r\nThe greatest obstacles which the Lord Chairman meets with come from what\r\nare known as \"agreed clauses,\" that is, clauses agreed upon between\r\nopponents and promoters of the bill. These in most cases are accepted\r\nwithout much examination by the private bill committees. The Lord\r\nChairman tries to strike them out when he deems them against public\r\npolicy; but this is not always easy, because it may be an injustice to\r\none of the parties who has consented not to urge or oppose other\r\nprovisions on the faith of those clauses. Moreover, even if the clauses\r\nare struck out of the bill, they may still be operative in fact, as the\r\npersons interested often feel bound in honour to carry them out. The\r\nmatter has a very important bearing on the subject of municipal\r\ntrading,[391:1] that is, the supply of public utilities by companies and\r\npublic bodies, and it will be noticed hereafter in that connection. It\r\nis curious that the protection of the public interest in private bill\r\nlegislation should depend very largely on the action of one man, and\r\nthat man not the holder of a representative office or responsible to the\r\npublic, but a member of an hereditary chamber who practically holds his\r\npost as long as he pleases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Merits of the System.]\r\n\r\nIf the English system of private bill legislation has its defects, they\r\nare far more than outweighed by its merits. The curse of most\r\nrepresentative bodies at the present day is the tendency of the members\r\nto urge the interests of their localities or their constituents. It is\r\nthis more than anything else that has brought legislatures into\r\ndiscredit, and has made them appear to be concerned with a tangled skein\r\nof private interests rather than with the public welfare.[391:2] It is\r\nthis that makes possible the American boss, who draws his resources from\r\nhis profession of private bill broker. Now the very essence of the\r\nEnglish system lies in the fact that it tends to remove private and\r\nlocal bills from the general field of political discussion, and thus\r\nhelps to rivet the attention of Parliament upon public matters. A\r\nministry stands or falls upon its general legislative and\r\nadministrative record, and not because it has offended one member by\r\nopposing the demands of a powerful company, and another by ignoring the\r\ndesires of a borough council.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It Depends on the Support of the Committees by the House.]\r\n\r\nSuch a condition would not be possible unless Parliament was willing to\r\nleave private legislation in the main to small impartial committees, and\r\nabide by their judgment. If this were not true--and it would not be true\r\nin most other legislatures--the promoters and opponents of the bill\r\nwould attempt to forestall or reverse the decisions of the committees on\r\nthe floor of the House, and would try to enlist the support of the\r\nmembers in their favour. That is, indeed, occasionally done, and has\r\ncalled forth no small complaint. Perhaps the most notable instance of\r\nlate years was that of the bills for the organisation of companies to\r\nsupply electric power in Durham and South Wales. The bills were opposed\r\non the ground both of public policy and of local interest, and were\r\nrejected by the House of Commons in 1899 under the powerful influence of\r\nthe Association of Municipal Corporations. Public feeling was, however,\r\naroused, and the bills were passed in 1901.\r\n\r\nIn the very nature of things Parliament must have power to overrule the\r\nprivate bill committees, and sometimes does so, but the permanence of\r\nthe system depends upon the fact that it is not done often. The\r\nquestion, therefore, whether there is a growing tendency to override the\r\ncommittees is a very interesting one. Such meagre statistics as have\r\nbeen collected would appear to show that there has been a slight\r\nincrease in the number of bills opposed on second and third reading, and\r\nin the number of instructions to committees that have been moved,[392:1]\r\nas well as in the amount of time spent in the House in debating these\r\nmatters.[392:2] It seems, also, to be the general opinion of men in\r\nclose touch with private bill practice, that the habit of overruling the\r\ncommittees has gained ground of late years, but fortunately not to any\r\ndangerous extent.[393:1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[367:1] For the History of this subject see Clifford's \"History of\r\nPrivate Bill Legislation.\"\r\n\r\n[367:2] The distinction between public and private bills, and public and\r\nprivate acts is not the same. The former depends upon the nature of the\r\nprocedure in Parliament; while acts are classified as (1) Public General\r\nActs, (2) Local Acts, which have the same legal effect as public acts,\r\nbut apply only to a particular locality, and may relate to an organ of\r\nlocal government or a company; (3) Private Acts--now few in\r\nnumber--which are of a personal nature, and are not taken notice of by\r\ncourts unless specially pleaded. With some exceptions that will appear\r\nsufficiently in the text, the acts in classes (2) and (3) do, and those\r\nin class (1) do not, go through the procedure of private bills.\r\n\r\n[368:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hybrid Bills.]\r\n\r\n_Cf._ May, 634-43. Ilbert, \"Leg. Methods and Forms,\" 29-32. Moreover, as\r\nmeasures intended primarily to affect particular places, may, on account\r\nof their far-reaching importance, be treated as public bills, so others\r\ndesigned for public objects may interfere in a peculiar way with private\r\ninterests. Measures of either kind are sometimes, under the name of\r\n\"Hybrid Bills,\" put through a mixed procedure. They are introduced as\r\npublic bills, and then referred to a private bill committee, which is,\r\nhowever, larger than an ordinary committee of that kind, the members\r\nbeing appointed partly by the House and partly by the Committee of\r\nSelection. A procedure of this sort is required in the case of bills of\r\nthe London County Council for raising loans (S.O.P.B. 194).\r\n\r\n[368:2] To distinguish between the two classes of standing orders the\r\nnumbers of those relating to public business are printed in the\r\nparliamentary papers in bold-faced type. But in the footnotes to this\r\nbook those relating to private business are referred to as S.O.P.B. The\r\nreferences are to the standing orders as revised in 1903, because a\r\nnumber of changes were made in that year in pursuance of the\r\nrecommendations of the Select Committee of 1902. The statements in this\r\nchapter relate to the procedure in the House of Commons; for the\r\npractice in the House of Lords is so nearly the same in almost all\r\nessential points, that it is enough to indicate the more important\r\ndifferences in the text or in the notes. A memorandum on the differences\r\nin detail may be found in the Report of the Committee on Private\r\nBusiness (Com. Papers, 1902, VII., 321, App. 15).\r\n\r\n[369:1] The rules about notice are contained in S.O.P.B. 3-22.

Each phase has left a trace\r\nupon its organisation or functions, or upon the privileges of its\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Composition of the House.]\r\n\r\nBefore the Reformation the ecclesiastics in the House of Lords,[394:2]\r\nincluding the abbots and priors, usually outnumbered the laymen; but\r\nupon the dissolution of the monasteries, and the disappearance therewith\r\nof the abbots and priors, the proportions were reversed, and the\r\nhereditary element became predominant. At present the House contains\r\nseveral kinds of members, for it must be remembered that every peer has\r\nnot a right to sit, and all members of the House are not in every\r\nrespect peers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Hereditary Peers.]\r\n\r\nFirst there are the peers with hereditary seats. They are the peers of\r\nEngland, created before the union with Scotland in 1707; the peers of\r\nGreat Britain created between that time and the union with Ireland in\r\n1801; and the peers of the United Kingdom created thereafter. They rank\r\nas dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts, and barons, whose precedence,\r\nwith that of their wives and children, furnishes abundant interest to\r\nthose who care for such things. The Crown, that is, the ministry of the\r\nday, has unlimited power to create hereditary peerages with any rules of\r\ndescent known to the law in the case of estates in land,[395:1] and\r\nsince the accession of George III. the power has been freely used. All\r\nbut seventy-four out of nearly six hundred seats belong to this class,\r\nwhich is now the only channel for an increase in the membership of the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Representative Peers of Scotland.]\r\n\r\nWhen the union with Scotland was made in 1707, the Scotch peers were\r\nmore numerous in proportion to population than the English; and\r\ntherefore, instead of admitting them all to the House of Lords, it was\r\nprovided that they should elect sixteen representatives of their order\r\nfor the duration of each Parliament. No provision was made for the\r\ncreation of new Scotch peers, so that with the dying out of peerages,\r\nand the giving of hereditary seats to Scotch noblemen by creating them\r\npeers of the United Kingdom,[395:2] the number of Scotch peers who have\r\nno seats in their own right has fallen from one hundred and sixty-five\r\nto thirty-three. Within another generation they may not be more than\r\nenough to furnish the sixteen representatives.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Ireland.]\r\n\r\nThe same problem arose upon the union with Ireland a hundred years\r\nlater; but the Scotch precedent was not followed in all respects; for\r\nthe act provided that the Irish peers should elect twenty-eight of their\r\nnumber representatives for life, and an arrangement was also made for\r\nperpetuating the nobility of Ireland within certain limits. Not more\r\nthan one new Irish peerage was to be created for every three that became\r\nextinct, until the number--exclusive of those having hereditary seats in\r\nthe House of Lords under other titles--had fallen to one hundred, a\r\nlimit above which it can never be raised.[396:1] There is another\r\nimportant difference between the Scotch and Irish peers. The former are\r\nwholly excluded from the House of Commons, but the latter can sit for\r\nany constituency in Great Britain, though not in Ireland. Under this\r\nprovision Irish peers have, in fact, often sat in the Commons, the most\r\nfamous case being that of Lord Palmerston. The Irish peerage thus\r\naffords an opportunity to ennoble a statesman, without putting an end to\r\nhis political career in the popular chamber.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Bishops.]\r\n\r\nThe dissolution of the monasteries, by removing the abbots and priors\r\nfrom the House of Lords, left the bishops the only spiritual peers; and\r\nas such they have held their seats to the present day. By the time the\r\nunion with Scotland was made, the established church of that kingdom was\r\nPresbyterian in form, and no Scotch ecclesiastics were added to the\r\nHouse of Lords. But the Irish established church was Episcopal and\r\nProtestant, and hence at the union with Ireland in 1801 four places were\r\ngiven to her bishops, who filled them by rotation sitting for a session\r\napiece. With the disestablishment of the Irish Church in 1869 its\r\nrepresentatives vanished from Parliament, leaving the English prelates\r\nas the only spiritual peers in the House of Lords.[396:2] Meanwhile the\r\ngreater attention paid to the needs of the Church has brought about the\r\ncreation of new bishoprics in England; but in order not to increase the\r\nnumber of spiritual peers, it has been provided that while the\r\nArchbishops of Canterbury and York, with the Bishops of London, Durham,\r\nand Winchester, shall always have seats in the House of Lords, of the\r\nrest only the twenty-one shall sit who are seniors in the order of\r\nappointment.[396:3] The spiritual peers are members of the House solely\r\nby virtue of their office, and so long as they retain it. Except, in\r\nfact, for the five great sees they are members only by virtue of\r\nseniority in office. At times the Nonconformists have tried to exclude\r\nthem altogether; but with the growth in the number of lay peers their\r\nrelative importance has diminished, and it is not probable that they\r\nwill be removed, unless as part of a larger movement for the reform of\r\nthe House of Lords, or the disestablishment of the Church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Life Peers.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Case of Baron Wensleydale.]\r\n\r\nSince the House of Lords is not only a legislative chamber, but also the\r\nhighest court of appeal for the British Isles, it is well that it should\r\ncontain at all times the legal talent required for the purpose. An\r\nobvious method of accomplishing the result, without permanently\r\nenlarging the House, or hampering the career of heirs who may not have\r\nthe wealth to support the dignity, is by giving seats for life to\r\neminent judges. With this object Sir James Parke, a distinguished baron\r\nof the Court of Exchequer, received in 1856 a patent as Baron\r\nWensleydale for life. Much learning has been expended upon the question\r\nwhether the Crown has ever exercised the power to create a life peer\r\nwith a seat in the House of Lords,[397:1] and whether, if it ever\r\nexisted, the power has become obsolete; but the Wensleydale case was\r\nsettled by a vote of the House that the Letters Patent did not enable\r\nthe grantee to sit and vote in Parliament. Sir James Parke was thereupon\r\ncreated Baron Wensleydale with an hereditary title, and the appointment\r\nof Law Lords as life peers was postponed a score of years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Lords of Appeal.]\r\n\r\nAt last the need for increasing the legal members of the House became so\r\nclear that in 1876 an act was passed to authorise the appointment of\r\ntwo, and ultimately of four, Lords of Appeal in Ordinary for\r\nlife.[397:2] They hold the position, and enjoy a salary of six thousand\r\npounds, on the same tenure as other judges; and since 1887 they have\r\nalso had a right to sit in the House as long as they live, irrespective\r\nof their tenure of the office. The motive for their creation was simply\r\nto strengthen the House of Lords as a court of appeal. Proposals for\r\nlife peerages on a more extended scale have also been made in connection\r\nwith plans to reform the House of Lords as a branch of Parliament. So\r\nfar these have come to nothing; and, as we shall see hereafter, it is by\r\nno means clear that they would attain the end in view, or that, if they\r\ndid, they would be wise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The House Determines the Qualification of its Members.]\r\n\r\nThe authority of the House of Lords to determine the validity of new\r\npatents has already been referred to in connection with the Wensleydale\r\ncase. It is also empowered by statute to pass upon the election of\r\nScotch and Irish representative peers. Disputed claims to the succession\r\nof hereditary peerages, on the other hand, may be settled by the Crown\r\non its own authority, but it is the habit at the present day to refer\r\nthese likewise for decision to the Lords.[398:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disqualifications.]\r\n\r\nInfants, aliens, bankrupts, and persons under sentence for grave\r\noffences, are incapable of sitting in the House of Lords;[398:2] and\r\ninstances occurred in the seventeenth century of special sentence of\r\nexclusion by the House itself. But more important from a political point\r\nof view than the disqualifications for the upper chamber is the fact\r\nthat a peer cannot escape from the peerage. This is sometimes a\r\nmisfortune when a man, who has made his mark in the House of Commons,\r\nhas an obscure greatness thrust upon him by the untimely death of his\r\nfather. In such a case he loses at once and forever his seat in the\r\nHouse where the active warfare of politics goes on, and this although he\r\nmay be a Scotch peer, who has no seat in the House of Lords. The\r\nquestion was debated at some length in 1895, when Lord Selborne tried to\r\nretain his seat in the Commons by omitting to apply for a writ of\r\nsummons as a peer; but the Commons decided that he could not do\r\nso.[398:3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Personal Privileges of the Peers.]\r\n\r\nBesides the liberty of speech and freedom from arrest which they\r\npossess in common with the members of the other House, the peers, partly\r\nin memory of their position as councillors of the Crown, partly as an\r\naftermath of feudal conditions, retain certain personal privileges, of\r\nsmall political importance, but sometimes of interest to the person\r\nconcerned. One of these is the right of access to the sovereign for the\r\npurpose of an audience on public affairs. Another is the right to be\r\ntried by their peers in all cases of treason or felony.[399:1] If\r\nParliament is in session, the trial is conducted by the whole House of\r\nLords, presided over by the Lord High Steward appointed by the Crown. If\r\nnot it takes place in the court of the Lord High Steward, to which,\r\nhowever, all the peers are summoned.[399:2] The privilege extends to the\r\nScotch and Irish peers, whether chosen to sit in the House of Lords or\r\nnot; to the life peers; to peeresses in their own right; and to the\r\nwives and widows of peers, unless they have \"disparaged\" themselves by a\r\nsecond marriage with a commoner; but it does not extend to the bishops,\r\nor to Irish peers while members of the House of Commons.[399:3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Functions of the House.]\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords is both a coordinate branch of Parliament and a court\r\nof law. Its duties as a court of appeal will be described in another\r\nchapter with the rest of the national judicial system, and its original\r\njurisdiction, in the trial of peers and of impeachments brought by the\r\nHouse of Commons, is no longer of much consequence. The evolution of the\r\npolitical responsibility of ministers has made impeachment a clumsy and\r\nuseless device for getting rid of an official, while the greater\r\nefficiency of the criminal law has made it needless for punishing an\r\noffender; and in fact the last case where it was used was that of Lord\r\nMelville, one hundred years ago. It may be noted, however, in this\r\nconnection that the House still retains the right to require the\r\nattendance of the judges, not only when acting in a judicial capacity,\r\nbut on all occasions when it may need their advice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Money Bills.]\r\n\r\nSince the House is a coordinate branch of the legislature, every act of\r\nParliament requires its assent, and although in practice it is far less\r\npowerful than the House of Commons, the only subject on which the\r\nlimitations of its authority can be stated with precision is that of\r\nfinance. As far back as 1671 the Commons resolved \"That, in all aids\r\ngiven to the King, by the Commons, the Rate or Tax ought not to be\r\naltered by the Lords\";[400:1] and in 1678 they adopted another\r\nresolution that all bills granting supplies \"ought to begin with the\r\nCommons. And that it is the undoubted and sole right of the Commons, to\r\ndirect, limit, and appoint, in such Bills, the Ends, Purposes,\r\nConsiderations, Conditions, Limitations, and Qualifications of such\r\nGrants; which ought not to be changed, or altered by the House of\r\nLords.\"[400:2] The Commons have clung to this principle ever since,\r\nenforcing it by a refusal to consider bills in which the Lords have\r\ninserted or amended financial provisions; and although the Lords have\r\nnever expressly admitted the claim, they have in fact submitted to\r\nit.[400:3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Paper Duties Bill in 1860.]\r\n\r\nThe upper House can, of course, reject a money bill altogether, but the\r\nhistory of the last case where they did so shows the futility of such a\r\npower by itself. In 1860 the ministry brought in a bill to repeal the\r\nduties on paper, which hindered the development of a cheap newspaper\r\npress, and the Lords rejected it in spite of the fact that the budget\r\nalready passed imposed additional taxation to make up for the loss of\r\nrevenue from paper. The next year the repeal of the paper duties was\r\nsimply included in the annual tax bill, and forced through in that way.\r\nIt is now the regular practice to include all the taxation in one bill,\r\nand as the peers never venture to reject as a whole either this, or any\r\nof the great measures granting supplies, it is truly said that the\r\nHouse of Lords cannot initiate or amend, and practically cannot reject,\r\nany money bill. The principle applies not only to the national receipts\r\nand expenditures, but also to local rates,[401:1] but it does not apply\r\nto revenues of the Crown or the Church, nor at the present day to\r\npenalties or fees not payable into the Exchequer.[401:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tacking.]\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that the Commons could carry any piece of\r\nlegislation by tacking it to a money bill. This was formerly done; but\r\nthe Lords have long had a standing order forbidding such a practice, and\r\nno attempt has been made of late years to revive it.[401:3] Moreover the\r\nrule about money bills is not strictly enforced where the financial\r\nprovision is merely incidental to general legislation. The Lords are\r\nfree to omit such a clause altogether,[401:4] or if it is so interwoven\r\nwith the rest of the measure that it cannot be treated separately, the\r\nCommons have often waived their rights and taken into consideration\r\namendments made by the Lords.[401:5] For the sake of convenience they\r\nhave gone farther still, for they suffer expedients to be used, that\r\nreally evade, while recognising, their privilege. Bills are sometimes\r\nintroduced in the House of Lords with financial provisions which are\r\nstruck out on third reading. In the Commons these provisions are printed\r\nas ghosts, underlined or in brackets, to indicate that they are not at\r\nthe moment a part of the bill, but that a motion will be made in\r\ncommittee to reinsert them.[401:6] What is more, the Commons have\r\nadopted a standing order that it will not insist on its privileges in\r\nthe case of private, or provisional order, bills which impose tolls, or\r\nauthorise rates by local authorities for local purposes.[401:7]\r\n\r\nThe rule about money bills applies only to measures actually before\r\nParliament. It does not prevent the House of Lords from expressing an\r\nopinion upon financial matters either in debate or by resolution, or\r\nfrom inquiring into them by means of select committees.[402:1] In 1903,\r\nindeed, was seen the curious spectacle of the House of Lords debating\r\nfreely Mr. Chamberlain's fiscal policy, while the Opposition in the\r\nCommons was striving almost in vain for an opportunity to do so.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Officers of the House of Lords.]\r\n\r\nExcept when a peer is being tried the Lord Chancellor presides over the\r\nHouse. In practice he is always made a peer, but this is not a legal\r\nnecessity, and, in fact, the woolsack, on which he sits, is commonly\r\nsaid not to be within the House itself. Perhaps for this very reason he\r\nhas not the authority of the Speaker of the Commons in ruling upon\r\npoints of order. He does not even decide which peer shall speak, but if\r\nmore than one rise at once, and refuse to give way, the question who\r\nshall have the floor is decided by the House itself, if necessary by\r\ndivision.[402:2] Order in debate, also, is enforced not by him but by\r\nthe Lords themselves. Moreover, he has no casting vote, and it is\r\ncharacteristic of his position that the peers do not address him, but\r\nspeak to \"My Lords.\" In short, his functions are limited to formal\r\nproceedings, and even in these he can be overruled by the House.[402:3]\r\nIf a peer he can, of course, as such, take part in debate; but otherwise\r\nnot. During his absence one of the deputy speakers, appointed by the\r\nCrown, takes his place, or if none of these be present the House\r\nappoints a speaker _pro tempore_.[402:4]\r\n\r\nThe other principal officers of the House are the Lord Chairman of\r\nCommittees, chosen by the House itself, who presides in Committee of the\r\nWhole, and who, as we have seen, has great influence over private bill\r\nlegislation; the Clerk of the Parliaments, who acts as Clerk of the\r\nHouse; the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, who acts as messenger of\r\nthe House on great and formal occasions; and the Sergeant-at-Arms; all\r\nthese last three being appointed by the Crown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quorum.]\r\n\r\nThe quorum of the House is fixed at the absurdly small number of three,\r\nbut this is to some extent delusive, for the presence of thirty Lords is\r\nnecessary for an effectual division upon any stage of a bill. Formerly\r\nthe House occasionally imposed fines upon its absent members, a practice\r\nthat has fallen into disuse. The privilege of voting by proxy has also\r\ndisappeared. It was abolished by standing order in 1868.[403:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Procedure.]\r\n\r\nThe procedure upon bills is in general similar to that in the House of\r\nCommons. There are two readings, and then a Committee of the Whole,\r\nfollowed by a third reading; and there is the familiar rule that no\r\nmember can speak more than once to the same question, except in\r\nCommittee of the Whole. The chief difference from the Commons consists\r\nin the rule adopted in recent years for referring bills after the\r\ncommittee stage, and before report, to a standing committee appointed by\r\nthe Committee of Selection.[403:2] This gives an opportunity to revise\r\nthe drafting of a bill that has been battered out of shape in its\r\npassage through Parliament. As a matter of practice, however, the\r\nreference to a standing committee is usually omitted, for the Lords are\r\nquite in the habit of shortening the process of legislation by special\r\nvote of the House. The committee stage is often left out altogether; and\r\nin money bills this always is done. On the appropriation bills, indeed,\r\nthere is rarely any debate, and all the stages are not infrequently\r\ntaken on one day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Peers have Abundance of Time.]\r\n\r\nThe Lords have no constituents to impress, and hence there are not so\r\nmany members as in the Commons who want to take part in debate.\r\nMoreover, they are not obliged to devote a large part of their time to\r\nsupply and to the budget; and as their chamber is not the place where\r\nthe great political battles are fought, the Opposition does not oppose\r\nat every possible step. They can, therefore, get through their work at\r\nleisure. They make use, indeed, of select and sessional committees in\r\nmuch the same way as the Commons; but, having time enough to consider\r\nevery bill in Committee of the Whole, they do not need time-saving\r\nmachinery like the Standing Committees on Law and Trade. For the same\r\nreason, and because there is no disposition to wilful obstruction, they\r\ndo not require and do not have a closure to cut off debate. Their\r\nsittings also are short. On Wednesday and Saturday they seldom meet at\r\nall, while on other days their usual hour of meeting is half-past four,\r\nand they rarely sit after dinner-time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Action is Little Fettered by Rules.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the very fact that the fate of ministers does not\r\nhang upon their votes renders possible a much larger freedom of action\r\nthan in the Commons. There is not the same need of precaution against\r\nhasty, ill-considered motions, or against votes that might embarrass the\r\ngovernment without implying a real lack of confidence. Hence there is no\r\nrestriction upon the motions that can be brought forward, save that\r\nnotice must be given beforehand;[404:1] and any question to a minister\r\nmay be followed by a general debate, provided again that notice of the\r\nquestion has been given in the orders of the day.[404:2]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[394:1] The best history of the House is Pike's \"Constitutional History\r\nof the House of Lords.\"\r\n\r\n[394:2] The question whether they sat by virtue of their tenure of land,\r\nor of their offices in the Church, has been a subject of some\r\ndiscussion. _Cf._ Pike, 151 _et seq._ Anson, I., 220-22.\r\n\r\n[395:1] And possibly with others. _Cf._ Anson, I., 197-200.\r\n\r\n[395:2] At one time the House of Lords held that a Scotch peer could not\r\nbe given an hereditary seat as a peer of Great Britain; but this\r\ndecision was afterwards reversed.

In the\r\nold unreformed days the Lords and Commons were in general accord,\r\nbecause both were controlled by a territorial aristocracy whose chief\r\nmembers were peers. That element remained, no doubt, strong in the\r\nCommons after the Act of 1832, but it was no longer overmastering, and\r\nit had to use its authority in a more popular spirit, so that the two\r\nHouses ceased to be controlled by the same force. By bringing about this\r\nresult the Reform Act drew attention to the fact that an hereditary\r\nbody, however great the personal influence of its members, could not in\r\nnineteenth century England be the equal in corporate authority of a\r\nrepresentative chamber. It became apparent that the House of Lords might\r\non important issues differ in opinion from the House of Commons, and\r\nthat in such cases an enduring desire of the nation, as expressed in the\r\nrepresentative chamber, must prevail.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Power of the Lords Thereafter.]\r\n\r\nThis did not mean that the House of Lords must submit to everything that\r\nthe Commons chose to ordain; that it was to become a mere fifth wheel of\r\nthe coach; on the contrary, in matters not of great importance, or on\r\nwhich the Commons were not thoroughly in earnest, it exercised its own\r\njudgment, sometimes in cases that caused no little friction between the\r\nHouses. In 1860, for example, it rejected the bill to repeal the duties\r\non paper; in 1871 it refused to concur in the abolition of the purchase\r\nof commissions in the Army; and in 1880 it rejected the bill to\r\ncompensate evicted Irish tenants. In all these cases the policy of the\r\nHouse of Commons was ultimately carried out; and the peers recognised\r\nfully that their action on great measures was tentative; that they must\r\nnot go too far; and that if public opinion was persistent they must in\r\nthe end give way. As Mr. Sidney Low well says: \"The House of Lords, ever\r\nsince the struggle over the great Reform Bill, has been haunted by a\r\nsuspicion that it exists on sufferance.\"[406:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The House of Lords is Conservative.]\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that it represents, in the main, the interests of\r\nproperty, and especially of landed property, the House of Lords tends\r\nnaturally to be conservative, in the sense that it is adverse to popular\r\ndemands which appear dangerous to interests of that kind, or indeed to\r\nthe established order of things; but more than this, the peerage as a\r\nmass tends from its social position in the nation to gravitate toward\r\nthe political party that clings to the nobility and the Church as\r\npillars of the state. During the half century that followed the first\r\nReform Act, the Liberals were in power much the greater part of the\r\ntime, and they created by far the larger number of peers;[406:2] yet the\r\nHouse of Lords remained firmly Conservative throughout; for even Liberal\r\npeers--and still more their descendants--are drawn by a steady current\r\nto the other side; a current that was accelerated, but not caused, by\r\nthe Home Rule Bill.\r\n\r\nThe House is, in fact, overwhelmingly Conservative. Of the hereditary\r\npeers more than four fifths belong to the Unionist party; and the\r\ndisproportion is increased by the representatives from Scotland and\r\nIreland. In the case of Ireland this is the inevitable result of the\r\nmethod of choosing, because elections occur only one at a time on the\r\ndeath of a representative peer, and his successor is always taken from\r\nthe dominant--that is, the Unionist--party. In Scotland, there being no\r\nprovision for minority representation, the same result takes place, the\r\nmajority electing all the sixteen peers for the Parliament from its own\r\nside; and thus the representative peers from both kingdoms, forty-four\r\nin number, are Unionists to a man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meaning of the Term \"Conservative.\"]\r\n\r\nIt is commonly said that the House of Lords is a conservative body which\r\nacts as a drag on hasty legislation, and holds back until the nation\r\nshows clearly that it has made up its mind. This is undoubtedly true,\r\nand if it were the whole truth the limited authority retained by the\r\nHouse would provoke no strong resentment in any quarter; but it is only\r\na part of the truth. The word \"conservative\" has two distinct meanings\r\nin England, according as it is spelled with a small or a capital C. The\r\nfirst signifies an aversion to change; the second, one of the two great\r\npolitical parties in the state. Now, for more than a generation after\r\nthe Reform Act of 1832 these two meanings of the word were not very far\r\napart. The Conservative party was to such an extent the party of\r\nresistance to change as to make plausible, if not accurate, Macaulay's\r\ncomparison of the two parties that divided the nation to the fore and\r\nhind legs of a stag, the Liberals being always in advance, and the\r\nConservatives following their footsteps at a distance. The simile\r\nexpressed one aspect of a not uncommon feeling, that the direction of\r\nthe national policy rested normally with the Liberals, but that when\r\nthey went too fast the Conservatives would come to power for a short\r\ntime, while the country adjusted itself to its new conditions. That\r\nunder these circumstances the House of Lords should act with the\r\nConservative party, and should help them to play the part of a brake\r\nfrom time to time, not in order to stop, but only to slow down, the\r\ncoach on a hill, was natural, and not open to serious objection. But\r\nDisraeli's constant preaching against a merely negative policy, coupled\r\nwith the need of seeking for working-class support after the extension\r\nof the franchise by the Reform Act of 1867, led to the abandonment by\r\nthe Tories of the attitude of resistance to change. Even if it be true\r\nthat the new Tory democracy is, on the whole, less progressive than the\r\nLiberal party, it is certainly not opposed to all progress. In more than\r\none direction, indeed, it is distinctly more favourable to change. If\r\nthe stag has not become double-headed, he has, at least, learned to walk\r\nwith either end in front; and this change in the Tory party has had a\r\nmarked effect upon the position of the House of Lords.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The House has Become a Tool of the Conservative Party.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Conservatives have outgrown their negative attitude of\r\nresistance to change, and have become an aggressive party with a\r\npositive policy, they have retained and even strengthened their control\r\nof the House of Lords. The House has not, of course, lost all volition\r\nso completely as merely to register the commands of the Unionist\r\nleaders. To some extent it has its own opinions, which are now more\r\nconservative than theirs; and even when they are in power it amends the\r\nlesser details of their bills with a good deal of freedom, sometimes\r\nmaking its own views prevail. In 1899, for example, it struck out of the\r\nLondon Local Government Bill the provision allowing women to vote for\r\nthe borough councils, a change that the Commons accepted with\r\nreluctance; and in 1902 it succeeded in making amendments to the\r\nElementary Education Bill, which threw upon the rates the burden of\r\ncurrent repairs in the Church schools, and preserved some control by the\r\nbishops over religious instruction therein.\r\n\r\nBut while the House of Lords has a will of its own in smaller questions,\r\non the great party struggles that rend the country it throws its weight\r\nwholly on the side of the Tories, and plays into their hands. Thus, from\r\n1892 to 1895, and again in 1906,--the only two occasions on which the\r\nLiberals have been in office for a score of years,--the House of Lords\r\nused its power boldly to hobble the government. That it did so to help\r\nthe Unionist party, and not simply from conservative objection to\r\nchange, is curiously brought out by its treatment of the principal\r\nmeasures of 1906. Besides the Education Bill, where the conflict of\r\nopinion lay very deep, two other government measures that aroused some\r\nfeeling came to it from the Commons. One of them, the Trades Dispute\r\nBill, which provided that a trade union should not be liable to suit for\r\nany action it might take during a strike, was certainly a radical\r\nmeasure, and one to which a chamber of conservative temperament might\r\nwell object; but the Lords passed it without amendment. The other, the\r\nPlural Voting Bill, designed to prevent a man from voting in more than\r\none place, involved no very profound question of principle, and made no\r\nvery far-reaching change in English institutions, but was a bone of\r\ncontention between the parties because it affected the chances of\r\nelection in close districts. This bill the House of Lords summarily\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that since the Reform Act of 1832 government by party has\r\nbecome highly developed; and although the differences between the\r\nprinciples of the two parties may be less fundamental than they were\r\nformerly, the voting in Parliament runs very much more strictly on party\r\nlines.[409:1] Politics have become more completely a battle between\r\nparties, in which it is more difficult than ever to avoid taking sides,\r\nwhile the combatants try to make use of every weapon within their reach.\r\nNow the very accentuation of party has made it easier for the peers to\r\nresist a Liberal ministry, because in doing so they are evidently\r\nopposing, not the people as a whole, but only a part of the people, and\r\na part that is a majority by a very small fraction. In this way it has\r\nhappened that the House of Lords, without ceasing to have an opinion of\r\nits own on other matters, has become for party purposes an instrument in\r\nthe hands of the Tory leaders, who use it as a bishop or knight of their\r\nown colour on the chess-board of party politics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Position of the House in Forcing a Referendum.]\r\n\r\nA cabinet never thinks of resigning on account of the hostility of the\r\nLords; nor is its position directly affected by their action.\r\nIndirectly, however, it may be very seriously impaired, if the peers,\r\nclaiming that the government is not really in accord with the\r\nelectorate, reject important measures, and thereby challenge a\r\ndissolution of Parliament. By doing so they may reduce a ministry, that\r\nis not in a condition to dissolve, to a state of political impotence,\r\nboth in fact and in the eyes of the nation. This was true of the Liberal\r\nadministration in 1893-94, when the peers rejected the Home Rule Bill,\r\nand made amendments that struck at the root of the Parish Councils and\r\nEmployers' Liability Bills, changing the latter in a manner so vital\r\nthat the government finally withdrew the measure altogether. The\r\nLiberals protested that the House of Lords thwarted the will of the\r\npeople, and ought to be ended or mended. The alliteration helped to make\r\nthe phrase a catchword, but the cry excited popular enthusiasm so little\r\nthat at the dissolution in 1895 the country upheld the same party as the\r\nHouse of Lords, and returned a large Unionist majority to Parliament.\r\n\r\nFor the Lords to appeal to the people at a moment when the people were\r\nof their party was naturally not an unpopular thing to do, and for some\r\ntime after the fall of Lord Rosebery's government they rather gained\r\nthan lost ground in the esteem of the public. The Conservatives, indeed,\r\ndeclared that the House had renewed its youth, and had become once more\r\nan important organ of the state by asserting its right to appealing from\r\nthe cabinet and the majority in the Commons to the nation itself. The\r\nLords were said to have attained the function of demanding a sort of\r\nreferendum on measures of exceptional gravity; but useful as such a\r\nfunction might be, if in the nature of things a possible one, the\r\nexisting House of Lords cannot really exercise it, because their object\r\nin doing so is essentially partisan. In attempting to appeal to the\r\nelectorate, they act at the behest of one party alone. Thus in 1893 the\r\nLords were quite ready to force the issue whether the cabinet retained\r\nthe confidence of the country; but in 1905 when a series of adverse\r\nby-elections made it exceedingly doubtful whether the Conservative\r\ngovernment had not lost its popularity, nothing was further from their\r\nintention than to cause a dissolution.\r\n\r\nNow, a power to provoke a referendum or appeal to the people, which is\r\nalways used in favour of one party and against the other, however\r\npopular it may be at a given moment, and however much it may be\r\npermanently satisfactory to the party that it helps, cannot fail in the\r\nlong run to be exceedingly annoying to its rival; nor is it likely to\r\ncommend itself to the great mass of thinking men as a just and\r\nstatesmanlike institution. The House of Lords is a permanent handicap in\r\nfavour of the Tories, which is believed to have helped them even in\r\nelections for the House of Commons. The workingmen have been told that\r\nalthough the Conservatives promise them less, they are better able to\r\nfulfil their promises than the Liberals who cannot control the House of\r\nLords. These things must be borne in mind in discussing a possible\r\nreform of the upper House; but before coming to that question it will be\r\nwell to look at the Lords under some other aspects--at their\r\nnon-partisan activity, their treatment of private members' bills, and of\r\nprivate bill legislation, and at the personal influence of the leading\r\npeers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Non-political Legislation.]\r\n\r\nSo far we have considered only government bills, backed by the authority\r\nof a responsible ministry, which the upper House must treat with\r\ncircumspection. The Lords do not feel the same restraint in regard to\r\nprivate members' bills sent to them from the Commons. These lie beyond\r\nthe immediate range of party conflicts, and although they may\r\noccasionally deal with important subjects, neither the cabinet nor the\r\nparties take sides officially upon them. The Lords can, therefore, amend\r\nor reject them without fear; but it has become so difficult for a\r\nprivate member to get through the Commons any bill to which there is\r\nserious opposition, that this function of the upper House is not of\r\ngreat use. Still less vital is its power to initiate measures. In order\r\nthe better to employ the time of the Commons the government introduces\r\nsome of its secondary bills first in the Lords;[412:1] but measures\r\nproposed by individual peers have little chance of success. It is hard\r\nenough for a private member of the Commons to put his bill through its\r\nstages in that House, with all the sittings reserved for the purpose in\r\nthe earlier part of the session; and it is even harder to pass a bill\r\nbrought from the Lords at a later date. The result is that of the few\r\nprivate members' bills enacted each session only about one sixth\r\noriginate with the peers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Private Bill Legislation.]\r\n\r\nThe relation of the House of Lords to private bill legislation is very\r\ndifferent, for bills of that kind are in a region quite outside of\r\npolitics. In their case, as already observed, the action of the Lords\r\nis, if anything, even more important than that of the Commons; and, in\r\nfact, the private bill committees of the upper House inspire in general\r\na greater confidence, because the members are men of more\r\nexperience.[412:2] While, therefore, the House of Lords occupies a\r\nsubordinate place in regard to public measures of all kinds, and a\r\nposition of marked inferiority in the case of government bills, in\r\nprivate and local legislation, which in England is of great importance,\r\nits activity is constant and highly useful.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Personal Influence of the Peers.]\r\n\r\nThe personal influence of the Lords is far greater than their collective\r\nauthority. With the waning of the landed gentry the respect for the old\r\nterritorial aristocracy has been replaced by a veneration for titles,\r\nand this has inured to the benefit of the peerage. One sees it even in\r\nbusiness affairs, although the Lords as a class are little qualified by\r\nexperience for dealing with matters of that kind, the nobility having\r\nuntil recently been debarred by tradition from commercial life. One of\r\nthe devices of that arch promoter Hooley for inducing the public to\r\nembark in his schemes was to include a number of peers in his list of\r\ndirectors--guinea-pig directors, as they were called, because their most\r\nvisible function was to pocket a guinea for attendance at each meeting.\r\nThe Hooley revelations some years ago checked this practice; but the\r\nfact that it should have existed shows the confidence that titles were\r\nbelieved to inspire among a large class of investors.\r\n\r\nThe glamour of rank appears to be if anything more dazzling as one\r\ndescends in the social scale; and a scion of a noble family, even when\r\nhe has no landed interest at his back, is usually a strong Parliamentary\r\ncandidate in a working-class constituency. The extension of the\r\nfranchise has thus rather increased than diminished the influence of the\r\nnobility. The House of Commons, no doubt, makes a show of insisting that\r\nthe peers shall take no part in general elections; but they are,\r\nnevertheless, active in politics and even in great electioneering\r\norganisations, particularly in those that stand, like the Primrose\r\nLeague, a little outside of the regular party machinery. When a general\r\nelection is not in progress the leaders of the House of Lords speak\r\nconstantly in public; and at the present day speeches from the platform\r\nare reported in the daily press quite as fully, and read at least as\r\nwidely, as those delivered in the House of Commons. A foreigner is\r\nimpressed by the popular confidence in those peers who have attained a\r\nposition in the forefront of politics. There seems to be a feeling that\r\nthey are raised above the scrimmage of public life; that in rank,\r\nwealth, and reputation they possess already the goal of ambition, and\r\nare beyond the reach of the temptations that beset the ordinary man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reform of the House of Lords.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Objects of Reform.]\r\n\r\nThe adoption by the Lords, in the autumn of 1906, of amendments to the\r\nEducation Bill, so contrary to its spirit that they were rejected in the\r\nCommons by an overwhelming majority without any attempt at compromise,\r\nhas brought the question of a reform of the upper House again\r\nprominently before the country. No one would now think of creating the\r\nHouse of Lords as it stands; but, as Mr. (now Lord) Courtney remarks,\r\n\"The public judgment may long tolerate a machine which works without\r\nunnecessary friction, although it would not construct it in the same\r\nfashion if it had to be for the first time devised.\"[414:1] This is\r\nparticularly true if it is difficult to propose something that would\r\nwork better; and therefore in discussing the reform of the House of\r\nLords it is important to have clearly in mind the objects to be\r\nattained. Now, there are four possible objects of a reform: to make the\r\nHouse less powerful; to make it more powerful; to change the nature of\r\nits power; or to bring it into greater harmony with the popular elements\r\nin the state; and it may be interesting to examine these objects in\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To Reduce the Power of the House.]\r\n\r\nThe National Liberal Federation has repeatedly passed resolutions in\r\nfavour of restricting what is called the veto of the House of Lords.\r\nThis is most natural, for besides the objection in principle to\r\nhereditary legislators, there is the galling fact that the House is\r\nalways hostile to the Liberal party. No one would suggest that so long\r\nas a second chamber is suffered to exist it should be wholly deprived of\r\nthe right to reject or amend bills sent to it from the Commons. It is\r\nproposed, however, that the veto shall not be repeated after a certain\r\ninterval, and the vital question is what that interval shall be. A\r\nprovision that the Lords should not reject a bill passed by the Commons\r\nin two successive Parliaments, would probably be a mere legal\r\nratification of their present constitutional position; for although,\r\nafter a fresh general election has proved that the cabinet retains the\r\nconfidence of the nation, the Lords may refuse a second time to enact\r\none of its measures, they have never done so, and are not very likely to\r\nventure so far. A provision, on the other hand, that the Lords should\r\nnot reject or amend a bill passed by the Commons in two successive\r\nsessions of the same Parliament would mean that except in the last\r\nsession of an expiring Parliament, they could reject or amend seriously\r\nno government bill, whether convinced that the nation approved of it or\r\nnot.[415:1] This would be almost equivalent to an entire abolition of\r\nthe second chamber so far as government measures are concerned, because\r\nthe shred of authority left would amount to little more than that of\r\nrequiring the ministers to reconsider their position, which they could\r\nhardly do without stultifying themselves. The President of the French\r\nRepublic has a similar right in relation to the chambers, but it is\r\nnever exercised. A change of this kind could certainly be made, but\r\nwhether it would be wise or not is another question.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if a rule that the Lords should not reject or amend a\r\ngovernment bill passed by the Commons in two successive sessions did not\r\nvirtually destroy the power of the House of Lords altogether, it would\r\nnot accomplish the object of the Liberals. It would not put them upon a\r\nfooting of equality with the Conservatives, for it would mean that it\r\nwould take them two sessions to pass any legislation of a far-reaching\r\ncharacter, while the Conservatives could do it in one.\r\n\r\nWe are not concerned now with the question of reducing the power of the\r\nhereditary members of the House, by introducing other members in their\r\nstead; but of reducing the power of the House as a whole. Those persons\r\nwho are seriously interested in reforming the composition of the body\r\nare usually more anxious to increase than to diminish its authority, and\r\nit would be somewhat strange to make the House of Lords more\r\nrepresentative or more popular, while at the same time taking away the\r\nlast remnants of its power in political questions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To Increase its Power.]\r\n\r\nIn considering suggestions to reform the House of Lords for the sake of\r\nincreasing its efficiency we are met by the question whether with a\r\nparliamentary system, that is with government by party, as highly\r\ndeveloped as it is in England, a more powerful upper House is possible.\r\nFifty years ago second chambers were defended on the ground that they\r\nacted as a drag on radical legislation. But, as we have seen, the House\r\nof Lords does not really perform that function. It does not try to check\r\nlegislation by one of the parties, and only under peculiar circumstances\r\ncan it seriously restrain the other. Nor could any upper House render\r\nthat service effectively in England to-day. The fact is that although\r\nhistorically the position of the House of Lords may have been the\r\nconsequence of its hereditary, non-representative character, it is now\r\ndoomed to its present condition by the inexorable logic of a political\r\nsystem. Its limitations in dealing with government bills are imposed by\r\nthe principle of a ministry responsible to the popular chamber, and\r\nworking through highly developed parties; its inability to exert a\r\nsubstantial influence upon other public legislation is the result, not\r\nof its own inherent weakness, but of the condition of the House of\r\nCommons; while in private bill legislation, which lies outside the\r\ndomain of politics, it shares in full measure the authority of a\r\ncoordinate branch of Parliament.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To Change the Nature of its Power.]\r\n\r\nThe same reasoning would apply to any proposal to alter in character the\r\npowers exercised by the Lords. The channels of possible activity of any\r\nsecond chamber are fixed in England by the system itself, and they are\r\nnot far from the ones in which the House of Lords now moves. The House\r\ncould, no doubt, be shorn of the remnant of political authority that it\r\nstill wields, and it could be deprived of its right to take part in\r\nprivate bill legislation; but it would seem that, except by merely\r\nreducing their extent, the nature of its powers cannot be very\r\nmaterially changed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To Bring it into Harmony with the Nation.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Creation of Peers.]\r\n\r\nDuring the generation following the Reform Act of 1832, men spoke of the\r\npossibility of making new peers as a sufficient safeguard against\r\nobstinacy on the part of the upper House. It was felt that a ministry\r\nwith the nation at its back could, if necessary, force the Lords to\r\nyield by advising the Crown to create peers enough to turn the scale.\r\nLord Grey's government proposed to do this as a last resort to pass the\r\nReform Bill of 1832, and obtained the consent of William IV.; but the\r\nthreat was enough, and the Lords gave way. Such a drastic means of\r\ncoercion is probably useless to-day; and would be only a temporary\r\nremedy. It is really not with the Commons that the House of Lords now\r\ncomes into serious conflict, but with the cabinet which represents, or\r\nclaims to represent, the nation, or to be more accurate the major part\r\nof the nation; and no creation of peers would be made to force a bill\r\nthrough the House of Lords unless the party in power had a mandate from\r\nthe people to pass it. This is the real meaning of the saying that the\r\nHouse of Lords can force a referendum, or appeal to the nation, on a\r\nmeasure to which they object. A creation of peers to swamp the upper\r\nHouse would, therefore, not be tried until a general election had proved\r\nthe persistent will of the electorate upon the measure in question, and\r\nthen the Lords would in any case submit. Differences of opinion may, of\r\ncourse, arise on the question whether there is sufficient evidence of\r\nthe popular will or not. In 1893, for example, the Liberals contended\r\nthat the preceding general election had been carried on the issue of\r\nHome Rule, while the Conservatives insisted that it had really turned on\r\nother matters; and the same thing happened in the case of the Education\r\nBill of 1906. Such a discussion may be conducted with heat, but\r\nespecially with the enormous number of peers now required to turn a\r\nmajority in their House, there is little danger of precipitate action.\r\nIt is one of many cases where the conventions of the Constitution may\r\nappear to be strained, but where one may be sure they will not be\r\nbroken.[417:1]\r\n\r\nMoreover, if the creation of peers were within the region of practical\r\npolitics to-day, it would be only a temporary remedy for existing\r\ngrievances. Contrary to the prevalent opinion, Lord John Russell thought\r\nthat in 1832 the authority of the House of Lords suffered, on the whole,\r\nmore from the abstention of its members under threat, than it would have\r\nfrom an actual creation of peers that might have brought it into harmony\r\nwith the people. He remarks that the Tory majority of eighty, hostile to\r\nLord Grey's government, was held back by Wellington, but employed by\r\nLyndhurst to kill unpretending but useful measures.[418:1] Subsequent\r\nevents have shown the impossibility of maintaining harmony between the\r\nHouses by a single creation of peers, for had a batch of Lord Grey's\r\nsupporters been given seats in the Lords in 1832, the House would have\r\nbeen heavily Conservative again within a generation.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty to-day is not so much that the peers are permanently out\r\nof accord with the nation, as that they are bound to one of the two\r\nparties into which the country is divided. A mere reduction in the size\r\nof the Tory majority would do little or no good; nor would the\r\ndifficulty be solved if the majority were transferred to the other\r\nparty, or even if it shifted at different periods. In a country governed\r\nby party as strictly as England is to-day, the majority in the upper\r\nHouse must at any one time belong to one side or the other. If the\r\nmajority shifted, there would not be permanent irritation in the same\r\nquarter; but first one side, and then the other, would complain that the\r\nLords thwarted the popular will. While, therefore, the occasional\r\ncreation of a large number of peers, either hereditary or for life,\r\nmight, at a sacrifice of the self-respect of the House of Lords, produce\r\nfor the moment a greater similarity of views between the two branches of\r\nParliament, a constant political harmony could be attained only by such\r\nadditions to the upper House by each new set of ministers as would make\r\nit a mere tool in their hands. In short, an upper House in a true\r\nparliamentary system cannot be brought into constant accord with the\r\ndominant party of the day without destroying its independence\r\naltogether; and to make the House of Lords a mere tool in the hands of\r\nevery cabinet would be well-nigh impossible and politically absurd.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reform in the Composition of the House.]\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the creation of peers is true also of any other method\r\nof changing the membership of the House. Suggestions for reforming its\r\ncomposition have been based mainly upon the desire to reduce the\r\nhereditary element, and supply its place by representative men selected\r\nin other ways. The House contains, of course, many drones, who have\r\ninherited the right, without the desire, for public work. Either they do\r\nnot attend at all, or they come only to swell a foregone majority upon\r\nsome measure that has attracted popular interest. They give no time or\r\nthought to the work of the House, and their votes, on the rare occasions\r\nwhen they are cast, are peculiarly exasperating to their opponents. As\r\nthe regular attendants at the sittings are few, it has been suggested\r\nthat the English, like the Scotch and Irish, nobility should choose\r\nrepresentatives of their own order, and that the rest should have no\r\nright to vote. Just as the Scotch and Irish representative peers are\r\nsolidly Unionist, so a change of this kind would merely result in\r\nincreasing the Conservative majority of the House, unless some principle\r\nof minority representation were adopted, in which case the majority,\r\nthough numerically smaller, would be equally constant and more subject\r\nto party dictation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it has been proposed to make the House more broadly\r\nrepresentative of the nation by a more or less extended creation of life\r\npeers, nominated, in part, perhaps, by sundry public bodies in the\r\nUnited Kingdom. It may be doubted, however, whether life peers are\r\nneeded to increase the eminence or, in one sense, the representative\r\ncharacter of the House. The peerage has been opened freely to men\r\ndistinguished in various fields; and while many men without wealth have\r\ndoubtless been precluded from an honour that would burden their\r\ndescendants, many others have come in. The number of hereditary members\r\nof the House has increased nearly, although not quite, in proportion to\r\npopulation; and only about one fourth of the present members sit by\r\nvirtue of titles dating before 1800. A large share of the creations have\r\nbeen made for political service; but others have been conferred in\r\nconsequence of wealth amassed in commercial and industrial pursuits; the\r\nmost distinguished lawyers and soldiers have always been rewarded by a\r\npeerage; and so in more recent times have a few men of eminence in\r\nscience and literature. A body that contains, or has recently contained,\r\nsuch men as Tennyson, Acton, Kelvin, Lister, Rayleigh, and many more,\r\ncan bear comparison in personal distinction with any legislative chamber\r\nthe world has ever known. Therefore one may fairly doubt whether the\r\ndefect to be remedied by a creation of life peers is either a lack of\r\nbrains in the House, or a failure of its members to represent the deeper\r\ncurrents of national life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reform Unlikely to Add Much Strength.]\r\n\r\nBut the personal distinction of members, in fields outside of public\r\naffairs, has very little connection with the political power of a body;\r\nand the House of Lords itself furnishes one of the most striking proofs\r\nof that fact. The men whose names have been mentioned have taken no part\r\nin the work of the House, and such people rarely do. Moreover, if they\r\ntake part they rarely do it well. Occasionally such a man may have a\r\nchance to say something on the subject of his own profession that\r\ncarries weight. The speech of Lord Roberts in July, 1905, for example,\r\nabout the inefficiency of the British Army, was considered a very\r\nimpressive utterance, but, except for the rule of office that sealed his\r\nmouth in any other place, he might have delivered it with just as much\r\neffect elsewhere. Men who would be created life peers on account of\r\ntheir distinction in other lines would either take no interest in\r\npolitics, or would take it so late in life that they would rarely carry\r\nweight with the public. Such influence and repute as the House of Lords\r\nnow possesses is derived not from the personal fame of the members but\r\nfrom the social lustre of the peerage, and no creation of life peers\r\nwould be likely to add anything to that. The authority of a public body\r\ndepends not upon the eminence but upon the political following of its\r\nmembers; and it is self-evident that no leading English statesman in the\r\nfull tide of his vigour and popularity would willingly exchange a seat\r\nin the House of Commons for an appointment for life in any second\r\nchamber, so that a House of Lords constructed on these principles would\r\nbecome in large part an asylum for decrepit politicians.\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion of a similar kind is that the House should be\r\nremodelled upon the lines of the Privy Council, but the Privy Council\r\nto-day as a working body is nothing but the ministry, the other members\r\nattending only on ceremonial occasions. It is a mere instrument of\r\ngovernment in the hands of the cabinet; nor, so far as English politics\r\nare concerned, can it very well be anything else. The proposal that\r\ncolonial members should sit in the House of Lords is interesting from\r\nother points of view, but clearly it could not be applied in the case of\r\ndomestic legislation. That the will of the House of Commons on English\r\nquestions should be thwarted by representatives from other parts of the\r\nempire would be far more unfortunate than to have it thwarted by\r\nhereditary English nobles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other Probable Results.]\r\n\r\nBut if a change in the composition of the House of Lords would be very\r\nunlikely to raise its political position as a whole, it might well\r\nreduce the personal influence of individual peers. If the House came to\r\nbe regarded as mainly a collection of persons holding seats for life,\r\nthe social position of its members might be very different from that of\r\nan hereditary nobility. A radical reform in the composition of the House\r\nmight also very well produce a change of another kind. Perhaps the most\r\nimportant function of the House of Lords at the present day, and\r\nprobably the chief privilege of its members, comes from the fact that it\r\nis largely a reservoir of ministers of state. By the present traditions\r\nministers must be all taken from one House or the other; and a large\r\nproportion of them are always taken from the peers. This gives a\r\nnobleman, who is sincerely interested in public life, even if of\r\nsomewhat slender ability, a fair prospect of obtaining a position of\r\nhonour and usefulness. Now, if a number of life peers were to be\r\ncreated, it would clearly be possible to confer a title upon a man for\r\nthe purpose of making him a minister. If this were done commonly, it\r\nmight affect not only the position of the existing peers, but also that\r\nof the House of Commons. For a man not born to a coronet would be able\r\nto achieve a high office of state without an apprenticeship in the\r\npopular chamber. Thus a channel might be opened for a direct connection\r\nbetween the cabinet and the political forces of the nation without the\r\nmediation of the House of Commons. The change might be a first step in\r\nlessening the authority of Parliament, because cabinets, as will be\r\nexplained in the following chapter, being really made or destroyed by\r\nthe popular voice uttered in general elections, much of the power of the\r\nHouse of Commons is based upon the fact that it is the sole recruiting\r\nground for all ministers not hereditary peers.\r\n\r\nUnsatisfactory, therefore, as the present position of the House of Lords\r\nis to many people in England, the difficulties that surround the\r\nquestion of reform are very great; and a half-unconscious perception of\r\nthese explains in large part the fact that although proposals to reform\r\nthe House have been made of late years by leading men of every shade of\r\npolitical opinion, none of them has borne fruit, or even taken the shape\r\nof a definite plan commanding any considerable amount of support. To\r\nreform the House of Lords, or to create some other satisfactory second\r\nchamber may not be an impossible task, but it is one that will require\r\nconstructive statesmanship in a high degree; and to obtain the best\r\nchance of success it ought to be undertaken at the most unlikely time, a\r\ntime when the question provokes no passionate interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[406:1] \"The Governance of England,\" 218.\r\n\r\n[406:2] In 1830 the House of Lords contained 326 hereditary members.\r\nFrom that time until the fall of Mr. Gladstone's cabinet, in 1885, the\r\nLiberals made 198 additions to these members; and during the same period\r\nthe Conservatives made 70. Since 1885 the Conservatives have been in\r\npower by far the greater part of the time, and their creations of peers\r\nhave been correspondingly more numerous.\r\n\r\n[409:1] See the chapter on \"The Strength of Party Ties,\" _infra_.\r\n\r\n[412:1] When the Liberals are in power this is not much use for bills\r\nwhich the Lords are likely to amend seriously, because the amendments\r\nwould have to be reversed in the Commons at a cost of much time.\r\n\r\n[412:2] Rep. of Com. on Priv. Bill Legislation, Com. Papers, 1888, XVI.,\r\n1.\r\n\r\n[414:1] \"The Working Constitution,\" 120.\r\n\r\n[415:1] Probably the advocates of this policy would not want to apply it\r\nin the case of private bill legislation.\r\n\r\n[417:1] The power to create peers enough to swamp the House has a\r\npotential value. It could be used once for all to abolish or transform\r\nthe body, and this fact has, no doubt, its effect on the general\r\nattitude of the members, but that does not affect the argument that as a\r\nmeans of maintaining harmony between the Houses the power is useless.\r\n\r\n[418:1] \"Recollections and Suggestions,\" 110-11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE CABINET AND THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Transfer of Power from Parliament to the People.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its Causes; (1) the Growth of Power of the Cabinet.]\r\n\r\nIf the predominance of the House of Commons has been lessened by a\r\ndelegation of authority to the cabinet, it has been weakened also by the\r\ntransfer of power directly to the electorate. The two tendencies are\r\nnot, indeed, unconnected. The transfer of power to the electorate is due\r\nin part to the growing influence of the ministers, to the recognition\r\nthat policy is mainly directed, not by Parliament, but by them. The\r\ncabinet now rules the nation by and with the advice and consent of\r\nParliament; and for that very reason the nation wishes to decide what\r\ncabinet it shall be that rules. No doubt the ministry depends for its\r\nexistence upon the good pleasure of the House of Commons; but it really\r\ngets its commission from the country as the result of a general\r\nelection. Even if its life should be cut short by the Commons, the new\r\ncabinet would not now rest for support upon that Parliament; but would\r\nat once dissolve and seek a fresh majority from the electors. This was\r\nby no means true forty years ago. The Parliament elected in 1852, which\r\nsat a little more than four years, supported during the first half of\r\nthat time a coalition ministry of Liberals and Peelites, and during the\r\nsecond half a ministry of Liberals alone. The following Parliament\r\naffords an even better illustration. It met in 1857 with a large\r\nmajority for the Liberal cabinet of Lord Palmerston; but in less than a\r\nyear he was defeated and resigned, to be succeeded by the Conservatives\r\nunder Lord Derby, who carried on the government for another year before\r\ndissolving. The case of the next Conservative administration is more\r\nstriking still. Coming into office in 1866, in face of a hostile\r\nmajority, strongly Liberal, but hopelessly divided upon questions of\r\nreform, it remained in power more than two years, and brought to pass a\r\ndrastic extension of the franchise before it dissolved Parliament.\r\nNothing of the kind has occurred since that time. Every subsequent\r\nchange of ministry has either been the immediate consequence of a\r\ngeneral election, or if not, the new cabinet has kept the old Parliament\r\ntogether only so long as was absolutely necessary to dispose of current\r\nbusiness, and has then appealed to the people. Practically, therefore, a\r\nchange of ministry to-day is either the result of, or is at once\r\nratified by, a general election.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (2) The Increase of the Electorate.]\r\n\r\nThe decline in the power of the House is partly due also to the\r\nextension of the franchise, and the consequent growth in size of the\r\nelectorate, which has become so large that the voters cannot be reached\r\nby private or personal contact, but only by publicity. A cynic might\r\nwell say that if oligarchy fosters intrigue, democracy is based upon\r\nadvertisement, for in order to control the electorate it is no longer\r\nenough, as it was a hundred years ago, to be backed by a few influential\r\npatrons or to enlist the support of the members of Parliament. The\r\nimmense mass of the voters must be addressed, and hence public questions\r\nmust be discussed not only in Parliament, but in the ears of the people\r\nat large.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (3) The Control by Public Opinion.]\r\n\r\nA third reason why power tends to pass away from the House is the\r\ngreater control exerted in political affairs by public opinion, in\r\nconsequence of the rapid means of disseminating knowledge and of forming\r\nand expressing a judgment. Whatever may be the importance of the\r\neditorial columns of the daily press in creating, or giving voice to,\r\nthe general sentiment--and there is reason to suppose that editorials\r\nare of less consequence in both respects than they were formerly--it is\r\ncertainly clear that the multiplication of cheap newspapers has made it\r\npossible for vastly larger numbers of men to become rapidly acquainted\r\nwith current events; while the post and telegraph, and the habit of\r\norganisation, have made it much more easy for them to express their\r\nviews. A debate, a vote, or a scene, that occurs in Parliament late at\r\nnight is brought home to the whole country at breakfast the next\r\nmorning, and prominent constituents, clubs, committees and the like, can\r\npraise or censure, encourage or admonish, their member for his vote\r\nbefore the next sitting of the House. Rousseau's charge that the English\r\nwere free only at the moment of electing a Parliament, and then were in\r\nbondage during the whole of its term, was by no means really true when\r\nhe wrote it, and is far less true to-day. It is for this reason that\r\nthere has ceased to be any clamour for annual Parliaments, almost the\r\nonly one of the famous six points in the People's Charter that has not\r\nbeen substantially achieved.[425:1] Parliaments have not grown shorter.\r\nOn the contrary, in the twenty years from 1832 to 1852, when the cry of\r\nthe Chartists was heard, the average duration of Parliaments was four\r\nyears, and since the extension of the suffrage in 1868 they have\r\naveraged four years and three-quarters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its Manifestations.]\r\n\r\nThe passing of political power from the House of Commons to the people\r\nis shown by many unmistakable signs, and by none more clearly than by\r\nthe frequent reference in Parliament itself to the opinions of the \"man\r\nin the street.\" He is said to fear this, or be shocked by that, or\r\nexpect the other; and the House is supposed to pay some regard to his\r\nviews, not because he is peculiarly gifted with knowledge, experience,\r\nor wisdom, in greater measure than the members themselves. Far from it.\r\nHe is cited as a specimen of average humanity; the person to whom\r\nCarlyle referred when he spoke of modern Parliaments with twenty-seven\r\nmillions, mostly fools, listening to them.[425:2] The members of the\r\nHouse are supposed to heed him because they are his representatives; for\r\nhe is taken as a type of the voter of fair intelligence. In fact he is\r\nthe personification of what is believed to be outside opinion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Doctrine of Mandate.]\r\n\r\nAnother sign of the times is found in the doctrine, now sanctioned by\r\nthe highest authority, that Parliament cannot legislate on a new\r\nquestion of vital importance without a mandate from the nation. The\r\ntheory that the individual representative is a mere delegate of his\r\nconstituents, so that he is bound to resign and submit to reelection if\r\nhe changes his views, has long been a subject of discussion; but the\r\nidea that Parliament as a whole exercises a delegated authority in the\r\nsense that it is morally restrained from dealing with questions that\r\nhave not been laid before the people at the preceding general election\r\nwould formerly have been regarded as a dangerous political heresy. Yet\r\nduring the recent agitation in regard to fiscal policy, Mr. Balfour,\r\nwhile repudiating the suggestion that the existing Parliament, having\r\nbeen elected on the single issue of the South African War, ought to be\r\ndissolved when peace was made,[426:1] refused to grant time for a debate\r\non free food, on the ground that it would be constitutionally improper\r\nfor Parliament to act on the question until it had been submitted to the\r\npeople at a general election,[426:2] and that it would be unwise for the\r\nHouse to discuss a subject on which it could not act.[426:3]\r\n\r\nBased upon a similar principle is the claim reiterated by the Opposition\r\nduring the latter part of Mr. Balfour's administration, that, although\r\nsupported by a majority in the House of Commons, he ought to resign,\r\nbecause a long series of by-elections had shown that he had lost the\r\nconfidence of the country. His retention of office under those\r\nconditions was said to be contrary to the spirit of the\r\nConstitution;[426:4] and Mr. Balfour's resignation late in 1905, when\r\nParliament was not in session, involved an acknowledgment, if not of the\r\nnecessity, at least of the propriety, of withdrawing from office in\r\nsuch a case. Former cabinets have sometimes broken up on account of\r\ndissensions among their members, or the impossibility of maintaining an\r\nefficient government; but there has been no previous instance of a\r\ncabinet, supported by a majority in Parliament, which has resigned\r\napparently in consequence of a change of popular sentiment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Waning Interest in Reports of Debates.]\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most ominous sign that power is passing away from the\r\nHouse is the slowly waning interest in parliamentary debates. In the\r\neighteenth century the House strove to prevent the publication of its\r\ndiscussions. Now the debates are printed under a contract with the\r\ngovernment, which provides that no speech shall be reported at less than\r\none third of its actual length;[427:1] and most of the members like to\r\nappear in the newspapers as prominently as they can. But, if the desire\r\nof the members to be reported is still increasing, the eagerness of the\r\npublic to read what they say is less keen. Men who are thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the reporters' gallery tell us that the demand for long\r\nreports of speeches in Parliament has declined, and that editors find it\r\nfor their interest to cut them down, often substituting for the remarks\r\nof the members themselves descriptive sketches of what took\r\nplace.[427:2] One cause of this is, no doubt, the length of the debates,\r\nand the number of minor speakers taking part, which tends naturally to\r\ndull the popular craving to read them. Then there is the fact that\r\nParliament is no longer the only place where the party leaders make\r\nnotable speeches. In short, the predominance of the House of Commons as\r\nthe great forum for the discussion of public questions has been\r\nundermined by the rise and growth of the platform.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: History of the Platform.]\r\n\r\nAfter a long slumber the habit of speaking at public meetings revived\r\nabout the middle of the eighteenth century;[428:1] and a little later it\r\nwas taken up, in connection with the early political associations, as a\r\nsystematic means of agitation in the hope of bringing pressure to bear\r\nupon Parliament. At an early time leaders of the party in opposition\r\nwere present; but after the outbreak of the French Revolution public\r\nmeetings came to be used mainly by the working classes, and were\r\nregarded as seditious. Men who took part in them were prosecuted, and\r\nacts were passed to suppress them. These were so effective that by the\r\nopening of the next century political meetings had ceased to be held;\r\nexcept at elections, when some of the candidates for Parliament made\r\nspeeches to their constituents. The repressive statutes were, however,\r\ntemporary, and, although they were reenacted more than once, the\r\nmeetings revived during the intervals of freedom. The last of these\r\nspecial statutes, one of the famous Six Acts of 1819, expired in 1825,\r\nand from that time the platform entered upon a fresh career, marked by\r\nthree new features: the participation of all classes; the organised\r\neffort to bring about a definite political change by a legitimate\r\ncreation of public opinion; and the growing use of public speaking by\r\nparliamentary leaders as a regular engine of party warfare. Moreover,\r\nthe influence of the platform was much enlarged by the practice, which\r\nbegan shortly before that time, of reporting the meetings and speeches\r\nat considerable length in the provincial press.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Platform and Popular Movements for Reform.]\r\n\r\nThe first movement at this period in which the platform played a leading\r\npart was conducted by the Catholic Association in Ireland, and ended in\r\nthe removal of Catholic disabilities by the Act of 1829. But far more\r\nimportant examples of the use of public meetings are to be found in\r\nEngland. Throughout the agitation that accompanied the passage of the\r\nReform Act of 1832, public meetings were innumerable, and the platform\r\nwas raised to a dignity and influence much greater than ever before. In\r\nfact its position as a recognised power in English public life began at\r\nthat time. Its rapid advance in good repute was much helped by the fact\r\nthat during the struggle for reform it was used mainly to strengthen the\r\nhands of the ministry; but this was not yet its characteristic function.\r\nFor the next score of years it was chiefly employed in attempts to force\r\nupon the attention of Parliament, by popular agitation, measures which\r\ndid not otherwise receive serious consideration. Two efforts of the kind\r\nare especially noteworthy. One of them, that of the Anti-Corn-Law\r\nLeague, by the completeness of its organisation, by the cohesion and\r\neloquence of its leaders, by confining its attention to one point, and\r\nby good fortune, succeeded in accomplishing its object. The other, that\r\nof the Chartists, lacking these advantages, failed; and although most of\r\nthe demands of the Chartists were afterward obtained, that was the\r\nresult not of their endeavours, but of other causes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Platform and the Ministers.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the platform was used more and more freely by the\r\nparliamentary leaders, but this came gradually. Pitt spoke only in the\r\nHouse of Commons; and in fact until a few years before the Reform Bill\r\nalmost no minister, except Canning, made political speeches outside, and\r\nhis were addressed mainly to his own constituents. In 1823, however, he\r\ndelivered a speech at Plymouth, in which for the first time a statement\r\nabout foreign policy was made by a minister in public, and five years\r\nlater the change in the government's policy about Catholic disabilities\r\nwas announced at a banquet. With the reform movement the ministers began\r\nto take the public a little more into their confidence. At the general\r\nelection of 1831, Lord John Russell made the first public speech\r\nintended as an election cry,[429:1] and aroused an echo at meetings\r\nthroughout the land. In the same year Lord Grey talked about the bill at\r\nthe Lord Mayor's dinner, a festivity that became in after years a\r\nregular occasion for announcements of government policy. From that time\r\nthe use of the platform grew rapidly in favour with the cabinet. In 1834\r\nLord Brougham made the unfortunate series of harangues in Scotland that\r\nwrecked his political career. A little later Lord Melbourne explained\r\nhis own dismissal in a public speech; and Peel, on taking office,\r\ndeclared his policy in an address to his constituents. So important a\r\nmatter, indeed, did the platform become in public life, that Lord\r\nMelbourne, referring to the performances of Brougham and O'Connell,\r\nspoke of the vacation as a trying time.[430:1] Thereafter the platform\r\nwas constantly used both by ministers and leaders of the Opposition to\r\nbring public opinion to their side.\r\n\r\nAs usual in English politics, practice outran theory; for so late as\r\n1886 Mr. Gladstone, in answer to a remonstrance from the Queen, felt it\r\nnecessary to excuse himself for making speeches outside of his\r\nconstituency, on the ground that in doing so he was merely following the\r\nexample of the Conservatives.[430:2] Yet in 1879 he had set the nation\r\nablaze by his Midlothian campaign; and although his orations there were\r\ndelivered as a candidate for the seat, they were, and must have been\r\nintended to be, published by the newspapers all over the country.[430:3]\r\nIt was, in fact, at this very time that Lord Hartington spoke of the far\r\ngreater interest taken in public speeches than in debates in\r\nParliament.[430:4] Not that the platform became at once of especial\r\nvalue to the party leaders. On the contrary, it was at first used much\r\nmore frequently by the Anti-Corn-Law League, the Chartists and others.\r\nBut since the introduction of something very near manhood suffrage,\r\nwhich began in 1868, great popular movements, unconnected with party\r\npolitics, have become well-nigh impossible. In a real democracy there is\r\nlittle use in trying to overawe the government by a display of physical\r\nforce, and hence an agitation has for its natural object the winning of\r\nvotes. But the House of Commons has now been brought so fully into\r\naccord with the masses of the people that any strong popular sentiment\r\nis certain to find immediate expression there. Once in the House it is\r\non the edge of a whirlpool, for even if it originates quite outside of\r\nthe existing parties, and gives rise, at first, to a new political\r\ngroup, it can hardly fail, as it gathers headway, to be drawn into the\r\ncurrent of one of the two great parties, and find a place in their\r\nprogramme. Now in any question connected with party politics the highest\r\ninterest attaches to the speeches of the party leaders, both because\r\nthey are the standard bearers in the fight, and because they are the men\r\nwho have power, or at the next turn of the wheel will have power, to\r\ngive effect to their opinions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Public Speaking now Universal.]\r\n\r\nThe platform has thus had a perfectly natural evolution. So long as\r\nelections to the House of Commons were controlled by a small number of\r\npersons, public speaking could be effective only occasionally, when\r\npopular feeling could be deeply stirred over some grievance; and it was\r\nemployed chiefly by outsiders in an effort to force the hands of\r\nParliament. This was in part true even after 1832. But when the suffrage\r\nwas more widely extended in 1868, so that elections depended upon the\r\ngood-will of the masses, it became necessary for any one with political\r\naspirations to reach the public at large, and the most obvious means of\r\nso doing was from the platform. Speeches by candidates at elections\r\nbecame universal, and in order not to let the flame of loyalty burn low,\r\nit has been increasingly common to fan it at other times, by the talking\r\nof members to their constituents, and still more by addresses to the\r\nwhole community on the part of leaders of national reputation. Public\r\nspeaking has, therefore, become constant, without regard to the\r\nexistence of any issue of unusual prominence. James Russell Lowell long\r\nago made a remark to the effect that democracy is government by\r\ndeclamation, and certainly household suffrage has loosened the tongues\r\nof public men. An observer at the present day is struck by the fluency\r\nof Englishmen upon their feet, and by the free use of humour as a means\r\nof emphasis, instead of the sonorous phrases formerly styled oratory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Platform has Increased the Influence of Party Leaders.]\r\n\r\nIt has now become a settled custom for the cabinet ministers and the\r\nleaders of the parliamentary Opposition to make a business of speaking\r\nduring the late autumn and the spring recess; and the habit tends to\r\nmagnify their power, for they are the only persons who have fully the\r\near of the public. Except for a few important utterances, the debates in\r\nParliament are not very widely read; editorials in the press are read\r\nsolely by members of one political faith; the remarks of private members\r\nto their constituents are published only in the local papers; but public\r\nspeeches by the chief ministers, and to a less extent those by the\r\nprincipal leaders of the Opposition, are printed at great length by the\r\nnewspapers of both parties, and are read everywhere.[432:1]\r\n\r\nMoreover, the platform gives a greater freedom than the floor of the\r\nHouse. The ministers do not want to bring before Parliament a policy\r\nthey are not immediately prepared to push through, nor would it be easy\r\nto find time amid the business of a session to do so. It is not\r\naltogether an accident, it is rather a sign of the times, that Mr.\r\nChamberlain broached his plan of preferential tariffs, not in\r\nParliament, but at a public meeting in Birmingham. It was, indeed, a\r\nstrange thing to see an ardent discussion on a most important question\r\nconducted in public meetings and in the press, while the ministers were\r\nstriving to prevent debate upon it in the House of Commons. It was a\r\nmark of the limitation which the course of events has placed upon\r\nParliament. The platform has brought the ministers face to face with the\r\npeople, and this has increased the political importance of both. Not\r\nonly is the electorate the ultimate arbiter in political matters, but\r\nthe platform has in some degree supplanted the House as the forum where\r\npublic questions are discussed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its Benefits.]\r\n\r\nFrequent public addresses by the men in whom the whole responsibility\r\nfor the conduct of national affairs is concentrated, and by those who\r\nwill be responsible when the next change of ministry occurs, cannot fail\r\nto educate the voters, and quicken their interest in all the political\r\nissues of the day. Moreover, the process is not confined to the\r\nintermittent periods of election, but goes on all the time; and although\r\nthe practice, brought into vogue by the Anti-Corn-Law League, of joint\r\ndebates at public meetings has not taken permanent root in England, the\r\nsame result is reached in another way, because the party leaders answer\r\none another's speeches from different platforms, and if the listeners\r\nare not identical, the public reads both arguments. Sir Henry Maine\r\nspoke of the tendency to look upon politics as a \"deeply interesting\r\ngame, a never-ending cricket-match between Blue and Yellow\";[433:1] and\r\nthe fact that this aspect of the matter is more marked in England than\r\nanywhere else makes English politics the most interesting, and the most\r\neasy to follow, in the world. The rulers of the country, and those who\r\nboth have been and will be her rulers, fight at close range across a\r\ntable for six months of the year, and during the rest of the time they\r\ncarry on the ceaseless war by public speaking. As in the Athenian\r\ndemocracy, the citizens witness a constant struggle among rival\r\nstatesmen for supremacy, but in England they are merely spectators until\r\na general election summons them to give their verdict. One can hardly\r\nconceive of a system better calculated to stimulate interest in politics\r\nwithout instability in the government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its Perils.]\r\n\r\nBut if the platform educates the voter, it has its dangers also.\r\nBismarck is reported to have said that the qualities of the orator are\r\nnot only unlike, but incompatible with, those of the statesman; and\r\ncertainly the continual need of taking the public into one's confidence\r\nis hard to reconcile with the execution of far-reaching plans for the\r\nnational welfare, for until the results are in sight, these cannot be\r\nmade intelligible to the mass of the people. The English statesman is\r\ncalled upon at all times to show his hand, at the risk of seeming\r\ndisingenuous or secretive if he does not do so. His whole policy is\r\nanalysed and criticised; the seeds he plants are dug up prematurely to\r\nsee if they are sprouting. Hence he is under a strong temptation to take\r\na stand that will win immediately popular approval. In short, he lives\r\nin a glass house, which is likely to mean a very respectable but rather\r\nsuperficial life.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in the custom of speaking from the platform there lurks a\r\ndanger to the system of cabinet government; for that system is based\r\nupon the principle that the initiative in public policy rests with the\r\nministers, and the main issue decided at a general election is whether\r\nthe cabinet shall remain in power. Now ministers have not always been in\r\nthe habit of arranging what shall be said upon the platform with the\r\nsame care as what measures shall be brought before Parliament. But in\r\nview of the present importance of the platform it is obvious that if the\r\ncabinet system is to continue, the ministers must present a unanimous\r\nfront to the public as well as to Parliament; and this consideration\r\nleads to a study of the function of party in the English political\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[425:1] The six points were: universal suffrage, annual Parliaments,\r\nequal electoral districts, abolition of property qualification, vote by\r\nballot, and payment of members. Of all these demands annual Parliaments\r\nand payment of members alone have not been substantially attained.\r\n\r\n[425:2] \"Latter Day Pamphlets: The Stump Orator,\" No. 5.\r\n\r\n[426:1] _E.g._ Hans. 4 Ser.

Social psychology has also come\r\ninto view, and attempts have been made to explain the psychology of\r\nnational traits, and of abnormal or unhealthy popular movements, notably\r\nmobs. But the normal forces that govern the ordinary conduct of men in\r\ntheir public relations have scarcely received any scientific treatment\r\nat all. In short, we are almost wholly lacking in a psychology of\r\npolitical parties, the few scattered remarks in Maine's \"Popular\r\nGovernment\" being, perhaps, still the nearest approach to such a thing\r\nthat we possess.[435:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Although Parties are Universal.]\r\n\r\nThe absence of treatises on the subject is all the more remarkable\r\nbecause the phenomena to be studied are almost universal in modern\r\ngovernments that contain a popular element. Experience has, indeed,\r\nshown that democracy in a great country, where the number of voters is\r\nnecessarily large, involves the permanent existence of political\r\nparties; and it would not be hard to demonstrate that this must in the\r\nnature of things be the case. That parties exist, and are likely to\r\ncontinue to do so, has provoked general attention. By all statesmen they\r\nare recognised as a factor to be reckoned with in public life; and,\r\nindeed, efforts have been made in various places to deal with them by\r\nlaw. In the United States, for example, the local caucuses, or\r\nconventions of the parties, and their methods of nominating candidates,\r\nhave of late years been regulated by statute; while in Switzerland and\r\nBelgium, elaborate schemes of proportional representation have been put\r\ninto operation to insure a fair share of seats to the groups in the\r\nminority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Modern View of Parties.]\r\n\r\nBut if political parties have become well-nigh universal at the present\r\ntime, they are comparatively new in their modern form. No one in the\r\neighteenth century foresaw party government as it exists to-day,\r\nenfolding the whole surface of public life in its constant ebb and flow.\r\nAn occasional man like Burke could speak of party without\r\ncondemnation;[436:1] but with most writers on political philosophy\r\nparties were commonly called factions, and were assumed to be subversive\r\nof good order and the public welfare. Men looked at the history with\r\nwhich they were familiar; the struggles for supremacy at Athens and at\r\nRome; the Guelphs and Ghibelines exiling one another in the Italian\r\nrepublics; the riots in the Netherlands; the civil war and the political\r\nstrife of the seventeenth century in England. It was not unnatural that\r\nwith such examples before their eyes they should have regarded parties\r\nas fatal to the prosperity of the state. To them the idea of a party\r\nopposed to the government was associated with a band of selfish\r\nintriguers, or a movement that endangered the public peace and the\r\nsecurity of political institutions.\r\n\r\nForeign observers, indeed, point out that for nearly three hundred years\r\npolitical parties have existed in England, as they have not in\r\ncontinental countries; and that the procedure of the House of Commons\r\nhas consistently protected the Opposition in its attacks upon the\r\ngovernment.[437:1] This is true, and there is no doubt that even in the\r\nseventeenth century party struggles were carried on both in Parliament\r\nand by pamphlets and public speeches, with a freedom unknown in most\r\nother nations; but still they were a very different thing from what they\r\nare now. They were never far removed from violence. When the Opposition\r\nof those days did not actually lead to bloodshed, it was perilously near\r\nto plots and insurrection; and the fallen minister, who was driven from\r\npower by popular feeling or the hostility of Parliament, passed under\r\nthe shadow at least of the scaffold. Danby was impeached, and\r\nShaftesbury, his rival, died a refugee in Holland. With the accession of\r\nthe House of Hanover, and the vanishing of the old issues, political\r\nviolence subsided. The parties degenerated into personal factions among\r\nthe ruling class; and true parties were evolved slowly by the new\r\nproblems of a later generation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"His Majesty's Opposition.\"]\r\n\r\nThe expression, \"His Majesty's Opposition,\" said to have been coined by\r\nJohn Cam Hobhouse before the Reform Bill,[437:2] would not have been\r\nunderstood at an earlier period; and it embodies the greatest\r\ncontribution of the nineteenth century to the art of government--that of\r\na party out of power which is recognised as perfectly loyal to the\r\ninstitutions of the state, and ready at any moment to come into office\r\nwithout a shock to the political traditions of the nation. In countries\r\nwhere popular control of public affairs has endured long enough to be\r\nfirmly established, an Opposition is not regarded as in its nature\r\nunpatriotic. On the contrary, the party in power has no desire to see\r\nthe Opposition disappear. It wants to remain in power itself, and for\r\nthat reason it wants to keep a majority of the people on its side; but\r\nit knows well that if the Opposition were to become so enfeebled as to\r\nbe no longer formidable, rifts would soon appear in its own ranks. In\r\nthe newer democracies, such as France and Italy, there are large bodies\r\nof men whose aims are revolutionary, whose object is to change the\r\nexisting form of government, although not necessarily by violent means.\r\nThese men are termed \"irreconcilables,\" and so long as they maintain\r\nthat attitude, quiet political life with a peaceful alternation of\r\nparties in power is an impossibility.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conditions of Good Party Government.]\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the Opposition as a legitimate body, entitled to\r\nattain to power by persuasion, is a primary condition of the success of\r\nthe party system, and therefore of popular government on a large scale.\r\nOther conditions of success follow from this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opposition must not be Revolutionary.]\r\n\r\nIf the Opposition is not to be regarded as revolutionary, its objects\r\nmust not be of that character, either in the eyes of its own adherents,\r\nor in those of other people. As Professor Dicey has put it, parties must\r\nbe divided upon real differences, which are important, but not\r\nfundamental. There is, of course, no self-evident line to mark off those\r\nthings that are revolutionary or fundamental; and herein lies an\r\nincidental advantage of a written constitution restricting the\r\ncompetence of the legislature, for it draws just such a line, and goes\r\nfar to confine the immediate energies of the parties to questions that\r\nare admitted not to be revolutionary.[438:1] In the absence of a\r\nconstitution of that kind, party activity must be limited to a\r\nconventional field, which is regarded by the public opinion of the day\r\nas fairly within the range of practical politics. Clearly the issues\r\nmust not involve vital matters, such as life or confiscation. When,\r\nduring the progress of the French Revolution, an orator argued in favour\r\nof the responsibility of the ministers, and added \"By responsibility we\r\nmean death,\" he advocated a principle inconsistent with the peaceful\r\nalternation of parties in power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lines of Cleavage must not be Social.]\r\n\r\nFor the same reason there is grave danger when the lines of cleavage of\r\nthe parties coincide with those between the different social classes in\r\nthe community, because one side is likely to believe that the other is\r\nshaking the foundations of society, and passions are kindled like those\r\nthat blaze in civil war. This is true whenever the parties are separated\r\nby any of the deeper feelings that divide mankind sharply into groups;\r\nand especially when two or three such feelings follow the same channel.\r\nThe chief difficulty with Irish Nationalism, as a factor in English\r\npolitics, lies in the fact that to a great extent the line of cleavage\r\nis at once racial, religious, social, and economic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Issues must be Based on Public Matters.]\r\n\r\nIn order that the warfare of parties may be not only safe, but healthy,\r\nit must be based upon a real difference of opinion about the needs of\r\nthe community as a whole. In so far as it is waged, not for public\r\nobjects, but for the private gain, whether of individuals, or of\r\nclasses, or of collective interests, rich or poor, to that extent\r\npolitics will degenerate into a scramble of self-seekers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation of Parties to Political Institutions.]\r\n\r\nBefore inquiring how far these conditions have been fulfilled in England\r\nwe must consider the form that party has assumed there, and the\r\ninstitutions to which it has given birth. England is, in fact, the only\r\nlarge country in which the political institutions and the party system\r\nare thoroughly in harmony.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In America.]\r\n\r\nThe framers of the Constitution of the United States did not foresee the\r\nrole that party was to play in popular government,[439:1] and they made\r\nno provision for it in their plan; yet they established a system in\r\nwhich parties were a necessity. It was from the first inevitable, and\r\nsoon became clear, that the real selection of the President would not be\r\nleft to the judgment of the electoral college--a result made the more\r\ncertain, first, by providing that the members should assemble by States,\r\nand hence should not meet together as a whole for deliberation; and\r\nsecond, by excluding from the college all congressmen and holders of\r\nfederal offices, that is, all the leading men in national public\r\nlife.[440:1] If the electoral college was not really to select the\r\nPresident, it must become a mere machine for registering the results of\r\na popular vote throughout the nation, and the candidates for the\r\npresidency must be designated beforehand in some way.\r\n\r\nIn a small district where the voters are few, and an interchange of\r\nopinions naturally takes place by informal conference, public officers\r\nmay be elected by popular vote without the existence of any machinery\r\nfor nomination; but in a large constituency, where the voters are not\r\npersonally acquainted with each other, men who have the same objects in\r\nview must get together, agree upon a candidate, and recommend him to the\r\npublic. Otherwise votes will be thrown away by scattering them, and it\r\nwill be mere chance whether the result corresponds with the real wishes\r\nof the voters or not. In short, there must be some process for\r\nnominating candidates; that is, some party organisation; and the larger\r\nthe electorate the more imperative the need of it. Now the electorate\r\nthat practically chooses the President of the United States is by far\r\nthe largest single constituency that has ever existed in the world. It\r\nis, in fact, noteworthy that democracy throughout Europe adheres to the\r\ncustom of dividing the country for political purposes into comparatively\r\nsmall electorates; while in the United States it is the habit to make\r\nwhole communities single constituencies for the choice of their chief\r\nmagistrates--state governors or national president--a condition of\r\nthings that involves elaborate party machinery for nomination, and\r\nhence the creation of huge party organisations on a popular basis.\r\n\r\nThe form of government in the United States has thus made parties\r\ninevitable; and yet they were furnished with no opportunity for the\r\nexercise of their functions by the regular organs of the state. There\r\nwere no means provided whereby a party could formulate and carry through\r\nits policy, select its candidates for high office, or insure that they\r\nshould be treated as the real leaders of the party and able to control\r\nits action.[441:1] The machinery of party, therefore, from the national\r\nconvention to the legislative caucus, has perforce been created outside\r\nthe framework of the government, and cannot be nicely adjusted thereto.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In Continental Europe.]\r\n\r\nThe European countries, on the other hand, that have adopted the English\r\nparliamentary system, have usually copied those features, like the\r\nresponsibility of the ministers, which were most readily perceived,\r\nwithout acquiring at the same time the substructure on which the system\r\nrests, the procedure which prevents friction, or the national traditions\r\nwhich supply the motive power. The result has been that a form of\r\ngovernment well fitted to the great English parties has proved very\r\nimperfectly suited to the numerous political groups that exist in most\r\nof the continental legislatures.[441:2] In France the conditions have\r\nindeed changed much in the last few years, the procedure has been\r\ngradually better adapted to the parliamentary system, and the\r\nministries have gained in stability; but as yet the difficulties are by\r\nno means overcome. In some of the smaller countries, such as Belgium and\r\nSwitzerland, the organs of government and the system of parties are less\r\ninconsistent; in Belgium because she followed British precedents more\r\nfaithfully; in Switzerland because she was enabled by her small size,\r\ncoupled with a federal structure, to create a novel polity of her own,\r\nin which parties are given no constitutional sphere of action, and play\r\nan unusually subordinate part. In none of these countries, however, is\r\nthe form of government so fully consonant with the party system as it is\r\nin Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English Parliamentary System Grew out of Parties.]\r\n\r\nIn England the party system is no more in accord with the strictly legal\r\ninstitutions, with King, Lords and Commons, than it is elsewhere; but it\r\nis in absolute harmony with those conventions, which, although quite\r\nunknown to the law, make up the actual working constitution of the\r\nstate. It is in harmony with them because they were created by the\r\nwarfare of parties, were evolved out of party life. Government by a\r\nresponsible ministry was not the inevitable consequence of the long\r\nstruggle between the House of Commons and the Crown. Some other means\r\nmight very well have been devised for taking the executive power out of\r\nthe personal control of the King. It was rather the result of the\r\ncondition of the House itself; for it is inconceivable that this form of\r\ngovernment should have appeared if Parliament had not been divided into\r\nWhigs and Tories. In fact the whole plan would be senseless if parties\r\ndid not exist. The reason for the resignation of a ministry upon the\r\nrejection of a measure it has proposed is that the defeat indicates a\r\ngeneral loss of confidence in the policy of the party in power, and the\r\npreference for another body of leaders with a different policy. If this\r\nwere not so, the Swiss practice of remaining in office, but yielding on\r\nthe point at issue, would be far more sensible. The parliamentary system\r\nis thus a rational expression of the division of the ruling chamber into\r\ntwo parties.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It has Made Parties Stronger.]\r\n\r\nNeither the parliamentary system nor the party system, neither the\r\nresponsibility of ministers to the House of Commons nor the permanent\r\ndivision into two parties, grew up in a day. Throughout the eighteenth\r\ncentury the principle of cabinet responsibility was but dimly\r\nrecognised; while parties at times disintegrated, and the wheels of\r\ngovernment were kept going by means of corruption, which has served in\r\nall ages as a lubricant for ill-adjusted political machinery. But little\r\nby little, with halting steps, the rivalry of parties built up the\r\nresponsibility of ministers, and this in turn helped to perpetuate the\r\nparty divisions; for the parliamentary system, like every rational form\r\nof government, reacts upon and strengthens the conditions of its own\r\nexistence. It is based upon party, and by the law of its nature tends to\r\naccentuate party. Ministers perceived that their security depended upon\r\nstanding together, presenting a united front, and prevailing upon their\r\nfriends to do the same. The leaders of the Opposition learned also that\r\ntheir chance of attaining to power was improved by pursuing a similar\r\ncourse. In this way two parties are arrayed against one another\r\ncontinually, while every member of Parliament finds himself powerfully\r\ndrawn to enlist under one banner or the other, and follow it on all\r\noccasions. He cannot consider measures simply on their merits, but must\r\ntake into account the ultimate effect of his vote. As soon as men\r\nrecognise that the defeat of a government bill means a change of\r\nministry, the pressure is great to sacrifice personal opinions on that\r\nbill to the greater principles for which the party stands; and the more\r\nfully the system develops, the clearer becomes the incompatibility\r\nbetween voting as the member of Parliament pleases on particular\r\nmeasures, and maintaining in power the party he approves. In short, the\r\naction of the House of Commons has tended to become more and more party\r\naction, with the ministers, as we have already seen, gradually drawing\r\nthe initiative in legislation, and the control over procedure, more and\r\nmore into their own hands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It is Government by Party.]\r\n\r\nThe English government is builded as a city that is in unity with\r\nitself, and party is an integral part of the fabric. Party works,\r\ntherefore, inside, instead of outside, the regular political\r\ninstitutions. In fact, so far as Parliament is concerned, the machinery\r\nof party and of government are not merely in accord; they are one and\r\nthe same thing. The party cabal has become the Treasury Bench. The\r\nministers are the party chiefs, selected not artificially but by natural\r\nprominence, and the majority in the House of Commons, which legislates,\r\nappropriates money, supervises and controls the administration, and\r\nsustains or discards ministers, is the party itself acting under the\r\nguidance of those chiefs. The parliamentary system, as it has grown up\r\nspontaneously in England, is in its origin and nature government by\r\nparty, sanctioned and refined by custom. In that respect it differs, not\r\nonly from national political systems elsewhere, but also from British\r\nlocal government. This last is not an outgrowth of party, but, like most\r\nof the existing popular institutions in other countries, was designed,\r\nnot evolved. In it, as we shall see hereafter, party has no organic\r\nconnection with the ruling bodies, and has not the same controlling\r\nauthority as in national affairs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It can Thrive only with Two Parties.]\r\n\r\nIf the existence of a responsible ministry normally involves government\r\nby party, it also requires as a condition of success that there shall be\r\nonly two parties. The ills that have flowed from the subdivision of the\r\nFrench, the Italian and other parliaments, into a number of groups are\r\nnow an oft-told tale. The consequences there are very different from\r\nthose that occur where the executive is not responsible to the\r\nlegislature. In this last case the presence of several groups may result\r\nin the election of a president, a council or an assembly, representing a\r\nminority of the voters, and if so the popular will may not be truly\r\nexpressed. Yet the government will go on unshaken until the next\r\nperiodic election. But with similar conditions under the parliamentary\r\nsystem the administration itself will be weak, its position unstable,\r\nits tenure of office dependent upon the pleasure of a group that may be\r\nready to sacrifice everything else for a single object. Parnell was\r\nquite right in his reckoning that if he could keep the Home Rulers\r\ntogether until they held the balance of power in the House, one or other\r\nof the great parties must make terms with them, or parliamentary\r\ngovernment would be unworkable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opposition not Entirely Genuine.]\r\n\r\nIn the English system the initiative in most matters of importance has\r\ncome into the hands of the cabinet ministers, as the representatives and\r\nleaders of the predominant party. It is their business to propose, and\r\nit is the business of the Opposition to oppose. But the attitude of the\r\nlatter is not quite spontaneous. On rare occasions it congratulates the\r\ngovernment upon some action, which it supports heartily. More commonly\r\nit seeks to criticise everything, to find all imaginable faults.\r\nImpotent to legislate, it tries to prevent the majority from doing so;\r\nnot content with expressing its views and registering a protest, it\r\nraises the same objections at every stage in the passage of a bill; and\r\nsometimes strives to delay and even to destroy measures which it would\r\nitself enact if in power. Its immediate object is, in fact, to discredit\r\nthe cabinet. Now this sounds mischievous, and would be so were\r\nParliament the ultimate political authority. But the parties are really\r\nin the position of barristers arguing a case before a jury, that jury\r\nbeing the national electorate; and experience has shown, contrary to the\r\nprepossessions of non-professional legal reformers in all ages, that the\r\nbest method of attaining justice is to have a strong advocate argue on\r\neach side before an impartial umpire. Unfortunately the jurymen in this\r\ncase are not impartial, and the arguments are largely addressed to their\r\ninterests, but that is a difficulty inseparable from democracy, or,\r\nindeed, from any form of government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Waste of Capacity.]\r\n\r\nAnother result of party government that is constantly decried is the\r\nwaste of capacity it involves. Why, it is asked, should an excellent\r\nadministrator leave his post, because some measure quite unconnected\r\nwith his department--a measure, it may be, that he has himself opposed\r\nin the cabinet--is rejected by the House of Commons? Such a system\r\ninterferes with that continuity of policy which is often essential to\r\nsuccess both in foreign and internal affairs, and this is, no doubt, an\r\nevil; but owing to the presence of a highly trained body of permanent\r\nofficials, who carry on the traditions and largely control the policy of\r\nthe departments, it is not so important in England as one might suppose.\r\nThe system also debars one half of the talent in public life from the\r\nservice of the state; but this misfortune is one that, for one reason or\r\nanother, has existed to some extent in all countries at all times. The\r\nidea of a state where all the ablest men in the land join, without\r\nregard to political opinions, to devote the best of their talents to the\r\npublic service, is enchanting, but it has never been permanently\r\nrealised anywhere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Issues not Decided solely on their Merits.]\r\n\r\nAnother criticism levelled at party government in England arises from\r\nthe impossibility of supporting the party in power on one issue and\r\nopposing it on another. A voter at the last election who objected\r\nstrongly to any change in fiscal policy, and equally strongly to any\r\nconcessions on the subject of Home Rule, found himself on the horns of a\r\ndilemma. He was compelled to make up his mind which issue he thought\r\nmost important, and trust to Providence about the other. In a party\r\ngovernment, where the cabinet must resign if any of its vital measures\r\nare rejected, those measures cannot be considered by individuals on\r\ntheir merits. The policy of one party or the other must be supported as\r\na whole. This is certainly a limitation on personal freedom of action,\r\nand it acts as a restraint just to the extent that the government is\r\nconducted strictly on party lines. The party system certainly involves\r\ncompromise of opinion; but then there is some compromise required for\r\nthe enactment of every public measure, whether parties exist or not, for\r\nit never happens that the legislators who vote for any bill are all\r\nperfectly satisfied with every one of its clauses.\r\n\r\nGovernment by party is not an ideal regimen. Like everything else it\r\ncontains both good and evil. A political organisation, indeed, that\r\navoided all strife and all waste would certainly be impossible, and\r\nwould probably, by relaxing effort and sapping the springs of human\r\nnature, prove undesirable. As yet it is too early to strike a final\r\nbalance between the merits and the defects of the party system in\r\nEngland, and it would be hopeless to attempt it here. Both good and evil\r\nwill appear more fully as we proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[435:1] Rohmer's _Lehre von den politischen Parteien_, which attempts to\r\nexplain the division into parties by natural differences of temperament\r\ncorresponding to the four periods of man's life, is highly suggestive,\r\nbut is rather philosophic than psychological; and like most\r\nphilosophical treatises on political subjects it is based upon the\r\nwriter's own time and place rather than upon a study of human nature\r\nunder different conditions.\r\n\r\n[436:1] In his oft-quoted, but very brief, remarks in the \"Observations\r\non 'The Present State of the Nation,'\" and \"Thoughts on the Cause of the\r\nPresent Discontents.\" But twenty-five years later in a letter to Richard\r\nBurke he falls into the current talk about the evils of domination by a\r\nfaction.\r\n\r\n[437:1] _E.g._ Redlich, _Recht und Technik_, 74-79.\r\n\r\n[437:2] _Cf._ Review of his unpublished \"Recollections of a Long Life,\"\r\nin the _Edinburgh Review_, April, 1871, p. 301.\r\n\r\n[438:1] Neither in France nor in Italy does the constitution really\r\nperform that service; because in each case it does little more than fix\r\nthe framework of the government, without placing an effective restraint\r\nupon legislative action; and because the constitution itself is not felt\r\nto be morally binding by the irreconcilables.\r\n\r\n[439:1] For the views of these men on the relation of parties or\r\n\"factions\" to public life see \"The Federalist,\" No. 10, written by\r\nMadison.\r\n\r\n[440:1] Professor Max Farrand has pointed out to me that the question of\r\nhaving the electors for the whole country meet in one place was\r\ndiscussed in the Constitutional Convention, and was rejected in favour\r\nof the present plan, because under the latter, \"As the Electors would\r\nvote at the same time throughout the U.S. and at so great a distance\r\nfrom each other, the great evil of cabal was avoided.\" G. Hunt's\r\n\"Writings of Madison,\" IV., 365-66. Cabal had a vague and spectral\r\nmeaning, but covered anything in the nature of party. The exclusion from\r\nthe electoral college of members of Congress and federal office-holders\r\nwas defended on the same ground. _Cf._ \"The Federalist,\" No. 68.\r\n\r\n[441:1] In his \"Rise and Growth of American Politics,\" a book full of\r\npenetrating suggestions, Mr. Henry Jones Ford has argued that party\r\nexists in America in order to bring about an accord among public bodies\r\nthat were made independent by the Constitution; to force into harmonious\r\naction the various representatives of the people. Professor Goodnow\r\ndevelops the same idea from a different standpoint in his \"Politics and\r\nAdministration.\" But, especially in view of the comparatively small\r\naccord among public bodies, or harmonious action of the public\r\nrepresentatives, and the enormous influence of parties in elections, it\r\nseems to the writer more correct to say that parties in America exist\r\nmainly for the selection of candidates.\r\n\r\n[441:2] This subject is treated in Dupriez's admirable work _Les\r\nMinistres_, in Bodley's \"France,\" and in the writer's \"Governments and\r\nParties in Continental Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nPARTY ORGANISATION IN PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Need of Whips.]\r\n\r\nIn every legislative body a vote is supposed to express the sense of the\r\nHouse, and there is a universal fiction that all the members are\r\nconstantly present; but this is often far from being the fact; and it\r\nalways behooves any one interested in a particular matter to expend no\r\nsmall amount of labour in making sure that those persons who agree with\r\nhim are on hand when the decisive moment comes. All this applies with\r\npeculiar force to the House of Commons; for not only the fate of the\r\nparticular measure under consideration, but the very life of the\r\nministry itself, may depend upon a single division; and it is the more\r\ntrue because the average attendance, while a debate is going on, is\r\nunusually small. When the division bell rings, two minutes are, indeed,\r\ngiven for the members to rush in from the lobbies, the library, the\r\nsmoking and dining rooms, and the terrace, yet the government cannot\r\ntrust to luck for the presence of enough of its followers in the\r\nprecincts of the House to make up a majority. There must be someone\r\nwhose duty it is to see that they are within call.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Who They Are.]\r\n\r\nThe duty of keeping the members of a party on hand is performed by the\r\nwhips, whose name is abbreviated from the men who act as whippers-in at\r\na fox-hunt. They are all members of the House, and those on the\r\ngovernment side receive salaries from the public purse on the theory\r\nthat it is their business to \"keep a house\" during supply; that is, to\r\ninsure the presence of a quorum, so that the appropriations may be\r\nvoted. The chief government whip holds the office of Parliamentary\r\nSecretary to the Treasury, with a salary of 2000_l._ Formerly he was\r\noften called simply the Secretary of the Treasury--an expression\r\noccasionally confusing to the readers of books written a generation ago.\r\nHe is sometimes called, also, Patronage Secretary of the Treasury; and\r\nin old times no small part of his functions consisted in distributing\r\npatronage, in the days when it was freely employed to secure the support\r\nof members of Parliament. In fact he is still a channel for the\r\ndisposition of such minor patronage as remains in the gift of the Prime\r\nMinister, including the creation of lesser titles. He is assisted by\r\nthree other members, who hold the office of Junior Lords of the\r\nTreasury, with the salary of 1000_l._ apiece.[449:1] As has already been\r\nexplained, the Treasury Board never meets, so that the duties of the\r\nJunior Lords are to-day almost entirely confined to acting as whips;\r\nand, to enable them to do that more effectively, one of them is always a\r\nScotch member. The position of whip is one of great importance, but it\r\nentails some sacrifices, for by custom the whips take no part in debate,\r\nand although their work is felt throughout the House, it is little seen\r\nby the public. The chief whip, however, is often given afterwards a\r\nposition in the ministry, or otherwise rewarded.\r\n\r\nThe Opposition also has its whips, usually three in number, whose\r\nposition is important; though not so important as that of the government\r\nwhips, because while a failure to have the full strength of the party\r\npresent may be unfortunate, it cannot, as in the case of the government,\r\nbe disastrous. Naturally the Opposition whips have no salaries, but they\r\nare sustained by the hope that their turn will come.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duties of the Whips.]\r\n\r\nThe government whips act as the aides-de-camp, and intelligence\r\ndepartment, of the leader of the House. In the former capacity they\r\narrange for him with the whips on the other side those matters in which\r\nit is a convenience to have an understanding. The membership of select\r\ncommittees, for example, is generally settled between the chief whips\r\non the two sides of the House; and the time when the test vote on some\r\ngreat measure will take place is usually arranged beforehand in the same\r\nway.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: They bring in the Members.]\r\n\r\nWhen an important division is likely to occur, each side musters its\r\nwhole force for a great trial of strength; and not only the majority,\r\nbut the size of the majority, is a matter of importance to the\r\nministers, for it shows how completely they can depend upon the support\r\nof their followers. But it is not on vital questions alone that the\r\ngovernment must avoid being beaten, because a defeat, even though not\r\nsuch a one as would cause resignation, nevertheless weakens to some\r\nextent the credit of the cabinet. It gives the public the impression\r\nthat the ministers are losing popularity; either that their followers\r\nare becoming rebellious and voting against them, or, at least, that they\r\nare so far indifferent or disaffected as to stay away. Nothing succeeds\r\nlike success; and it is a maxim in politics as well as in war that one\r\nmust maintain a reputation for being invincible. Any defeat of the\r\ngovernment always causes cheers of triumph among the Opposition; and\r\nespecially of late years, when defeats have become more rare, it is a\r\nthing that requires explanation.\r\n\r\nThe whips must, therefore, always keep a majority within sound of the\r\ndivision bell whenever any business that may affect the government is\r\nunder consideration. For this purpose they are in the habit of sending\r\nout almost every day to all their supporters lithographed notices\r\nstating that a vote on such and such a matter is likely to come on, and\r\nrequesting the attendance of the member. These notices are underscored,\r\nin accordance with the importance of attendance, from a single line,\r\nmeaning that the whip desires the member's attendance, to four lines, or\r\na couple of very thick lines, which mean \"come on pain of being thought\r\na deserter.\" In fact the receipt of messages of this kind is the test of\r\nparty membership. In 1844 a correspondence on the subject took place\r\nbetween Peel and Disraeli shortly before the final breach occurred.\r\nDisraeli, who had been criticising the policy of the government in\r\nIreland and Servia, was not sent the usual whips, and protested on the\r\nground that he had not ceased to be a member of the party.[451:1]\r\n\r\nAll this is not so important in the case of the Opposition; for, the\r\nconsequences of being caught napping are not so serious. It is enough\r\nfor them to summon their full force from time to time, when a good\r\nchance for a large vote occurs. The proceedings of their whips,\r\ntherefore, though generally the same, are somewhat less systematic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: They must Know that the Members are Present.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Snap Votes.]\r\n\r\nThe whips act also as an intelligence department for the government\r\nleader. It is their business not only to summon the members of the party\r\nto the House, but to know that they are there. By the door leading to\r\nthe coat room, through which the members ordinarily enter the House from\r\nPalace Yard, there are seats; and here may always be seen one of the\r\ngovernment whips, and often one from the Opposition. Each of them takes\r\nnote of every member who goes in and out, sometimes remonstrating with\r\nhim if he is leaving without sufficient reason. By this means the whip\r\nis expected to be able, at any moment, to tell just how large a majority\r\nthe government has within the precincts of the House; and on the most\r\nimportant divisions the whip sees that every member of the party, who is\r\nwell, is either present or paired. Of course, the same thoroughness\r\ncannot be attained on smaller questions; and although the government\r\nwhip tries to have constantly on hand more members of his own party than\r\nof the Opposition, it is not always possible to do so. He may have\r\nexpected a vote to take place at a given hour, and sent out a notice to\r\nevery one to be present at that time, and the debate may suddenly show\r\nsigns of coming to an end earlier. In that case it is usually possible\r\nto get some member of the government to talk against time while the\r\nneeded members are fetched in. At times even this resource fails, and\r\nthe government is occasionally defeated on what is known as \"a snap\r\nvote.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: That of 1895.]\r\n\r\nHumorous anecdotes are told of frantic attempts to bring in the members,\r\nand of practical jokes in trying to prevent it;[452:1] but the only one\r\nof these cases that led to serious results occurred in 1895. The Liberal\r\ngovernment had been desperately clinging for life to a small majority of\r\nabout a dozen, when there came on for debate a motion to reduce the\r\nsalary of the Secretary of State for War, made in order to draw\r\nattention to an alleged lack of cordite. The whips sitting by the\r\nregular entrance of the House had in their tally the usual majority for\r\nthe government; but a score of Tories had gone from the Palace Yard\r\ndirectly to the terrace, without passing through the ordinary coat-room\r\nentrance. When the division bell rang they came straight from the\r\nterrace to the House, and to the surprise no less of the tellers than of\r\nevery one else, the government was defeated by a few votes. This was\r\nclearly a \"snap\" division, which would not ordinarily have been treated\r\nas showing a lack of confidence in the ministry. But the time comes when\r\na tired man in the sea would rather drown than cling longer; and that\r\nwas the position of Lord Rosebery's government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Whips must Know the Temper of the Party.]\r\n\r\nThe whips keep in constant touch with the members of their party. It is\r\ntheir business to detect the least sign of disaffection or discontent;\r\nto know the disposition of every member of the party on every measure of\r\nimportance to the ministry, reporting it constantly to their chief. A\r\nmember of the party, indeed, who feels that he cannot vote for a\r\ngovernment measure, or that he must vote for an amendment to it, is\r\nexpected to notify the whip. If there are few men in that position, so\r\nthat the majority of the government is ample, and the result is not in\r\ndanger, the whip will make no objection. A novice in the strangers'\r\ngallery, who hears three or four men on the government side attack one\r\nof its measures vigorously, sometimes thinks that there is a serious\r\nrisk of defeat; but if he watched the countenance of the chief whip on\r\nthe extreme end of the Treasury Bench, he would see no sign of anxiety,\r\nand when the division takes place the majority of the government is\r\nabout the normal size. The fact is that the whip has known all along\r\njust how many men behind him would vote against the government, just how\r\nmany would stay away, and that it really made no difference.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Methods of Pressure on Members.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fear of Dissolution.]\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the majority of the government is narrow, or the\r\nnumber of refractory members is considerable, the whip will try to\r\nreason with them; and in a crisis, where a hostile vote will be followed\r\nby a dissolution, or by a resignation of the ministry which involves, of\r\ncourse, a dissolution, his reasoning is likely to be effective; for no\r\nmember wants to face unnecessarily the expense of a general election, or\r\nthe risk of losing his seat. The strength of motives of this kind\r\nnaturally depends very much upon his tenure of the seat. If, as\r\nsometimes happens, he is the only member of the party who has a good\r\nchance of carrying the seat, or if his local or personal influence there\r\nis so strong that he is certain to carry it, he will hold a position of\r\nmore than usual independence. But this is rarely the case.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Action of Constituents.]\r\n\r\nNor is the fear of dissolution the only means by which pressure can be\r\nbrought to bear upon a member who strays too far from the party fold.\r\nHis constituents, or the local party association--which for this purpose\r\nis much the same thing--can be relied upon to do something. Any direct\r\nattempt by the whips to bring pressure upon a member through his\r\nconstituents would be likely to irritate, and do more harm than good.\r\nBut it is easy enough, in various ways, to let the constituents know\r\nthat the member is not thoroughly supporting his party; and unless his\r\nvote against the government is cast in the interest of the constituents\r\nthemselves, they are not likely to have much sympathy with his\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Social Influence.]\r\n\r\nAnother means of pressure is found in social influence, which counts for\r\nmuch in English public life; and for that reason it is considered\r\nimportant to have as chief whip a man of high social standing as well as\r\nof pleasant manners and general popularity. The power of social\r\ninfluence has always been great in England, more particularly among the\r\nConservatives. In 1853, Disraeli, who was trying hard to build up the\r\nTory party, and had at the time little else to build it with, urged the\r\nimportance of Lord Derby's asking all his followers in Parliament to\r\ndinner in the course of the session.[454:1] Nor does the use of\r\ninfluence of this kind appear to have declined. It has been said of late\r\nyears that if a Unionist did not vote with his party, he was not invited\r\nto the functions at the Foreign Office; and the weakness of the Liberals\r\nfor nearly a score of years after the split over Home Rule was due in no\r\nsmall part to the fact that they had very little social influence at\r\ntheir command. A sudden political conversion some years ago was\r\nattributed to disappointment of the member at the small number of\r\ninvitations received through Liberal connections; and the change of\r\nfaith no doubt met its reward, for it was followed in time by\r\nknighthood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Payment of Election Expenses.]\r\n\r\nFinally the whips have, upon a certain number of members, a claim\r\narising from gratitude. Elections are expensive for the candidate, and\r\nit is not always easy to find a man who is ready to incur the needful\r\ncost and trouble, especially when the chance of success is not large.\r\nUnder these conditions the central office of the party, which is under\r\nthe control of the leaders and the whip, will often contribute toward a\r\ncandidate's expenses. It is done most frequently in well-nigh hopeless\r\nconstituencies, and therefore the proportion of men who have received\r\nsuch aid is much greater among defeated than among elected candidates;\r\nalthough the cases are by no means confined to the former class. How\r\noften aid is given, and in what cases it is given, is never known, for\r\nthe whip naturally keeps his own counsel about the matter; but the\r\nnumber of members on each side of the House, a part of whose election\r\nexpenses have been paid from the party treasury, is not inconsiderable.\r\nUpon these men the whips have, of course, a strong claim which can be\r\nused to secure their attendance and votes when needed.\r\n\r\nIf all the means of pressure which the whips can bring to bear are\r\nunavailing, and the supporters of the government who propose to vote\r\nagainst it are enough to turn the scale, or if the whips report that the\r\ndissatisfaction is widespread, the cabinet will, if possible, modify its\r\nposition. This is said to have been the real cause of the apparent\r\nsurrender of the Liberal ministry to the demands of the Labour Party\r\nupon the bill to regulate the liability of trade unions in 1906. The\r\nwhips found that many of their own followers had pledged themselves so\r\ndeeply that they could not support the government bill as it stood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Whips as Tellers.]\r\n\r\nWhen the government is interested in the result of a vote, it informs\r\nthe Speaker that it would like its whips appointed tellers in the\r\ndivision, a suggestion with which he always complies. This is the sign\r\nthat the ministers are calling for the support of all their followers,\r\nand that the division is to be upon party lines. Often in the course of\r\na debate upon some amendment to a government bill, one hears a member,\r\nrising behind the Treasury Bench, appeal to the leader of the House not\r\nto put pressure upon his supporters on that question. He means that the\r\ngovernment whips shall not be made the tellers, in which case each\r\nmember is free to vote as he thinks best without a breach of party\r\nloyalty, and the result, whatever it may be, is not regarded as a defeat\r\nfor the cabinet. Occasionally this is done, but not often; because on\r\nthe question so treated the government, in abandoning its leadership, is\r\nexposed to a charge of weakness; and also because it is unsafe to do it\r\nunless the ministers are quite indifferent about the result, for the\r\neffect of the pressure on the votes of many members is very great.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No Other Party Machinery in Parliament.]\r\n\r\nThe whips may be said to constitute the only regular party organisation\r\nin the House of Commons, unless we include under that description the\r\ntwo front benches. The very fact, indeed, that the ministry and the\r\nleaders of the Opposition furnish in themselves the real party machinery\r\nof the House, avoids the need of any other. The ministers prepare and\r\ncarry out the programme of the party in power, while a small coterie of\r\nleaders on the other side devise the plans for opposing them. The front\r\nbench thus does the work of a party committee or council, and in neither\r\nof the great parties is there anything resembling a general caucus for\r\nthe discussion and determination of party policy. Sometimes a great\r\nmeeting of the adherents of the party in Parliament is called at one of\r\nthe political clubs or elsewhere, when the leaders address their\r\nfollowers. But it is held to exhort, not to consult; and, in fact,\r\nsurprise is sometimes expressed by private members that the chiefs take\r\nthem so little into their confidence.[456:1]\r\n\r\nThe organisation of the two great parties in Parliament has almost a\r\nmilitary character, with the cabinet as the general staff, and the\r\nleader of the House as the commander in the field. This is naturally far\r\nless true of lesser groups, which have not the tradition of cabinet\r\nleadership to keep them in line. In their case a real caucus of the\r\nparty, to consider the position it shall assume in a crisis, is not\r\nunknown. Two particularly celebrated meetings of that kind took place\r\nwithin a few years of each other: one held by the Liberal Unionists\r\nbefore the vote on the Home Rule Bill in 1886; the other the meeting of\r\nthe Irish Nationalists which deposed Parnell from the leadership of the\r\nparty in 1890.\r\n\r\nA caucus of one of the two great parties has occasionally been held to\r\nselect a leader in the House, in those rare cases where it has found\r\nitself in Opposition without a chief. This happened, for example, in\r\n1899, when the post of leader having been left vacant by the retirement\r\nof Sir William Harcourt therefrom in the preceding December, the Liberal\r\nmembers of the House met on the day before the opening of the session,\r\nand chose Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman to succeed him. Sir Henry\r\nthenceforward led the party in the Commons, and became, in due course,\r\nPrime Minister, when the Liberals came to power in 1905. Except,\r\nhowever, for an accident of that sort, neither of the two great parties\r\nhas any machinery for choosing its chiefs, or deciding upon its course\r\nof action. The leaders, and when the party comes to power the ministers,\r\nare, no doubt, indirectly selected by the party itself, for they are the\r\nmen who have shown themselves able to win its confidence, and command\r\nits support. But the choice is not made by any formal vote; nor is it\r\nalways precisely such as would result from a vote. The Prime Minister,\r\nif not himself in the Commons, appoints the leader of the House and his\r\nprincipal lieutenants, being guided in the choice by his own estimate of\r\ntheir hold upon the party, and by the advice of the other chiefs. When\r\nappointed, the leader leads, and the party follows.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[449:1] Formerly the Parliamentary Groom in Waiting acted also as a\r\nwhip; but the office was abolished in 1892.\r\n\r\n[451:1] Parker, \"Sir Robert Peel,\" III., 144-47.\r\n\r\n[452:1] Macdonagh, \"Book of Parliament,\" 372-78.\r\n\r\n[454:1] Malmesbury, \"Memoirs of an Ex-Minister,\" I., 382.\r\n\r\n[456:1] See, for example, Sir Richard Temple, \"Life in Parliament,\" and\r\nespecially pp. 39-40.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nNON-PARTY ORGANISATIONS OUTSIDE OF PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Different Kinds of Political Organisations.]\r\n\r\nThe political organisations outside the walls of Parliament may, for\r\nconvenience, be classified under four heads; although the groups so set\r\napart are not always perfectly distinct, and a particular organisation\r\nis sometimes on the border line between two different groups. These four\r\nheads are:--\r\n\r\n1. Non-party organisations, whose object is to carry into effect some\r\none project or line of policy, but not to obtain control of the general\r\ngovernment, or to act as an independent political group in the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\n2. Local party organisations, each confined to one locality, whose\r\nprimary object is to nominate party candidates and carry the elections\r\nin that place, although they may incidentally bring their influence to\r\nbear on the national policy of the party.\r\n\r\n3. National party organisations, whose object is to propagate the\r\nprinciples of the party, to aid in carrying the elections throughout the\r\ncountry, and also to formulate and control to a greater or less extent\r\nthe national party policy. Of the organisations formed for such a\r\npurpose, the most famous was early dubbed by its foes the \"Caucus,\" and\r\nunder that title the career of these bodies on the Liberal and the\r\nConservative side will be described in Chapters XXIX. and XXX., the\r\nLabour Party being treated in a later chapter by itself.\r\n\r\n4. Ancillary party organisations. These are handmaids to the party,\r\nwhich make no pretence of trying to direct its policy, but confine\r\nthemselves to the work of extending its popularity, promoting its\r\ninterests, and preparing the way for its success at the polls. They will\r\nbe discussed hereafter, but a few words must be said here about the most\r\nimportant of them all, because without a knowledge of its character, the\r\nhistory of the caucus, with which it has come into contact, can hardly\r\nbe understood. It is the central association, or central office, of the\r\nparty, composed of paid officials and agents, with or without the help\r\nof a group of wealthy and influential men. It raises and disburses the\r\ncampaign funds of the party, and takes charge of general electioneering\r\ninterests; but it always acts in close concert with the party leaders\r\nand the whips, and is, in fact, under their immediate direction and\r\ncontrol. The central office is thus a branch of the whip's office, which\r\nattends to the work outside of Parliament, and it is really managed by a\r\nprincipal agent or secretary directly responsible to the parliamentary\r\nchiefs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: They are Distinct from the Organs of State.]\r\n\r\nUnlike the instruments of party inside of Parliament, all of these four\r\nclasses of exterior political organisation are wholly unconnected with\r\nthe constitutional organs of government; save that the central office is\r\ndirected by the whip. Outside of Parliament, as in the United States,\r\nthe organisation of parties is artificial or voluntary, that is, the\r\nmechanism stands quite apart from that of the state, and its effect\r\nthereon is from without, not from within. From this fact have flowed\r\nimportant consequences that will be noted hereafter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Non-Party Organisations.]\r\n\r\nAmong the different kinds of political organisation those here called\r\nnon-partisan are by far the oldest. Yet the term itself may be\r\nmisleading. It does not mean that they have confined their efforts to\r\ncultivating an abstract public opinion in favour of their dogmas, for\r\nthey have often sought to elect to Parliament men who would advocate\r\nthem there. Nor does it mean that they have had no connection with the\r\nexisting parties, for sometimes one of the parties has countenanced and\r\nsupported their views, and in that case they have thrown their influence\r\nin favour of the candidates of that party. The term is used simply to\r\ndenote a body whose primary object is not to achieve victory for a\r\nregular political party. Curiously enough, such a group of persons often\r\ncomes nearer than the great parties of the present day to Burke's\r\ndefinition of party as \"a body of men united for promoting by their\r\njoint endeavours the national interest upon some particular principle in\r\nwhich they are all agreed.\" For each of the leading parties includes men\r\nwho are not wholly at one in their principles. Party aims are\r\ncomplicated and confused, and are attained only by a series of\r\ncompromises, in which the ultimate principle is sometimes obscured by\r\nthe means employed to reach it. A party in modern parliamentary\r\ngovernment would be more accurately defined as a body of men united by\r\nthe intent of sustaining a common ministry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Early History.]\r\n\r\nVarious organisations of the kind termed here \"non-partisan\" arose\r\nduring the latter part of the eighteenth century. The first of these of\r\nany great importance appears to have been the Society for Supporting the\r\nBill of Rights, founded in 1769 to assist Wilkes in his controversy with\r\nthe House of Commons, and in general to maintain the public liberties\r\nand demand an extension of the popular element in the constitution.\r\nFinding that the society was used to promote the personal ambition of\r\nWilkes, some of the leading members withdrew, and founded the\r\nConstitutional Society with the same objects. Ten years later county\r\nassociations were formed, and conventions composed of delegates\r\ntherefrom met in London in 1780 and 1781 to petition for the redress of\r\npublic grievances. Other societies were established about the same time,\r\nand they were not always of a radical character. The Protestant\r\nAssociation, for example, was formed under the lead of Lord George\r\nGordon to maintain the disabilities of the Roman Catholics, and brought\r\nabout the riots of June, 1780, which are still called by his name.\r\n\r\nThe political societies of those days were short-lived, and most of them\r\ndied soon; but the outbreak of the French Revolution sowed the seed for\r\na fresh crop. In 1791 the working classes of the metropolis organised\r\nthe London Corresponding Society, and the next year men of less extreme\r\nviews founded the Society of the Friends of the People to promote\r\nmoderate reform. Whether radical or moderate, however, associations of\r\nthat kind could not live in those troublous times. The repulsion and\r\nalarm provoked by the course of events in France were too strong to be\r\nresisted, and a number of repressive statutes were passed to break them\r\nup. First came an Act of 1794 to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, then\r\nin the following session another to prevent seditious meetings, and,\r\nfinally, a statute of 1799, which suppressed the London Corresponding\r\nSociety by name, and any others that were organised with branches. These\r\nacts and a series of prosecutions drove out of existence all the\r\nsocieties aiming at political reform; and during a few years, while the\r\nstruggle with France was at its height, the course of domestic politics\r\nwas unvexed by such movements. But the distress that followed the wars\r\nof Napoleon caused another resort to associations, which was again met\r\nby hostile legislation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Catholic Association, and Movements for Reform.]\r\n\r\nThe repressive statutes were, however, temporary, and when the last of\r\nthem expired in 1825, the way for popular organisations was again free.\r\nThe Catholic Association had already been formed in Ireland to procure\r\nthe removal of religious disabilities, and just as it disbanded, with\r\nits object won, in 1829, the shadow of the coming Reform Act brought\r\nforth a number of new political societies in England. In that very year\r\nThomas Atwood founded at Birmingham the Political Union for the\r\nProtection of Public Rights, with the object of promoting parliamentary\r\nreform; and after the introduction of the Reform Bill similar unions,\r\nformed to support it, sprang up all over the country. An attempt was\r\neven made to affiliate them together in a great national organisation;\r\nbut the government declared the plan illegal, and it was abandoned.\r\nAmong the most interesting of the societies of this kind were those\r\norganised in London. Here, in 1831, the National Union of the Working\r\nClasses was founded by artisans, disciples of Robert Owen, commonly\r\nknown as the \"Rotundanists,\" from the name of the hall where their\r\nmeetings were held. But Francis Place, the tailor, a notable figure in\r\nthe agitations of the day, had no sympathy with the socialistic ideas of\r\nthese men, and dreaded the effect of their society upon the fate of the\r\nReform Bill. He had a much keener insight into the real situation, and\r\nstarted as a counterstroke the National Political Union, with the sole\r\nobject of supplying in London the popular impulse needed, in his\r\nopinion, to push the measure through.[462:1] The Bill was no sooner\r\npassed than the many associations, which had been founded upon a union\r\nof the middle and lower classes to effect a particular reform, began to\r\ndie out.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Anti-Slavery Societies.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile two successive organisations of a non-partisan, and, indeed,\r\nof a non-political, character, had been carrying a purely humanitarian\r\nmovement to a triumphant end. The Committee for the Abolition of the\r\nSlave Trade was formed in 1787, and strove, by the collection of\r\nevidence, by petitions, pamphlets and corresponding local committees, to\r\nenlighten public opinion and persuade Parliament. After working for a\r\nscore of years, supported by the tireless efforts of Wilberforce in the\r\nHouse of Commons, it prevailed at last upon Parliament to suppress the\r\nslave-trade by the Acts of 1806 and 1807. Sixteen years thereafter the\r\nAnti-Slavery Society was formed to urge the entire abolition of slavery\r\nthroughout the British dominions, and this it brought about in 1833, the\r\nstrength of its advocates in the Commons, backed by popular agitation\r\noutside, being great enough to compel Lord Grey's government to bring in\r\na bill for the purpose.[462:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Non-Party Organisations after 1832.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Chartists.]\r\n\r\nSince 1832 the non-party organisations have been, on the whole, more\r\npermanent, and more widely extended than before; and, with some marked\r\nexceptions like that of the Chartists, they have tended to rely less\r\nupon a display of physical force, and more upon appeals to the\r\nelectorate--a change following naturally enough upon the enlargement of\r\nthe franchise. Chartism developed out of a large number of separate\r\nlocal organisations of workingmen, who realised that they had gained no\r\npolitical power from the Reform Act, and demanded a reform of Parliament\r\nin a really democratic spirit. The movement took its name from the\r\nPeople's Charter, with its six points, published in 1838 by the London\r\nWorking Men's Association. To this the various local bodies adhered,\r\nsending the next year delegates to a great People's Parliament in\r\nLondon. But the violence of the language used by the Chartists opened a\r\ndoor for prosecution; the leaders became frightened, and for the moment\r\nthe agitation lost its force. In 1840 it was reorganised, and was\r\nsupported by several hundred affiliated bodies. From first to last,\r\nhowever, it was weakened by dissensions among the leaders, relating both\r\nto the methods of operation and to subordinate issues. The movement\r\nculminated in 1848, in the mass meeting on Kennington Common, which was\r\nto form in procession, and present a mammoth petition to Parliament. The\r\nplan had caused grave anxiety; troops were brought up, thousands of\r\nspecial constables were sworn in; but at the last minute Feargus\r\nO'Connor, the leader of the Chartists, lost his nerve, and gave up the\r\nprocession. The great demonstration was a fiasco, and soon after the\r\nwhole movement collapsed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Anti-Corn-Law League.]\r\n\r\nOne of the many reasons for the failure of Chartism was the existence at\r\nthe same time of the most successful non-partisan organisation that\r\nEngland has ever known, the Anti-Corn-Law League. This, like the\r\nAnti-Slavery Association of an earlier day, was formed to advocate a\r\nsingle specific reform, and to its steadfast fidelity to that principle\r\nits success was largely due. It excluded rigidly all questions of party\r\npolitics, and in fact its most prominent leader, Cobden, always retained\r\na profound distrust of both parties. The reform embodied, however, in\r\nthe eyes of its votaries, both an economic and a moral principle, so\r\nthat they were able to appeal at the same time to the pocket and the\r\nconscience of the nation--a combination that goaded Carlyle into his\r\nreference to Cobden as an inspired bagman preaching a calico millennium.\r\nAs the League appealed to more than one motive, so it used freely more\r\nthan one means of making the appeal. After a number of local\r\nassociations had been formed, a meeting of delegates from these, held in\r\n1839, founded the League, which proceeded to organise branches all over\r\nthe country, sent forth speakers and lecturers, worked the press,\r\ncollected information, issued pamphlets by the ton, petitioned\r\nParliament, and strove to elect candidates who would support its views.\r\nAll this was done upon a huge scale with indefatigable energy. The\r\nmovement derived its force from the middle-class manufacturers, but they\r\nstrained every nerve to indoctrinate the working classes in the cities,\r\nand later the rural population, until at last public opinion was so far\r\nwon that the crisis caused by the failure of the Irish potato crop\r\nbrought about the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. The League had done\r\nits work and dissolved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other Non-Partisan Associations.]\r\n\r\nThere have been, and still are, a large number of other associations of\r\na non-partisan character, which bestir themselves about some political\r\nquestion. Often they exist in pairs to advocate opposing views, like the\r\nMarriage Law Reform Association, and the Marriage Law Defence Union, the\r\nImperial Vaccination League, and the National Anti-Vaccination League.\r\nThese associations are of many different kinds. Some of them are\r\norganised for other objects, concerning themselves with legislation only\r\nincidentally, and taking no part at elections, like the Association of\r\nChambers of Commerce, and the Association of Municipal Corporations.\r\nSome exist primarily for other purposes, but are very active in\r\npolitics, like certain of the trade unions;[464:1] others are formed\r\nsolely for the diffusion of political doctrines, but generally abstain\r\nfrom direct electoral work, like the Fabian Society, with its socialist\r\nideals; and, finally, there are organisations which, although not\r\nprimarily partisan, in fact exert themselves vigorously to help the\r\ncandidates of one of the great parties. To the last class belongs the\r\nLiberation Society, formerly very active in urging the disestablishment\r\nof the Church, and throwing its influence in favour of the Liberals; and\r\nalso its opponent, the Committee for Church Defence, equally strong on\r\nthe side of the Conservatives. More active than either of them at the\r\npresent day is the Free Church Federation, which has been brought into\r\nthe political arena by its repugnance to the Education Act of 1902. In\r\nthe same category must be placed the National Trade Defence Association,\r\nan organisation formed by the liquor dealers to resist temperance\r\nlegislation, and perhaps Mr. Chamberlain's recent Tariff Reform League,\r\nboth of which support the Tories. It so happens that the societies that\r\noppose the last two bodies are not so consistently devoted to the\r\nLiberals. Then there are societies of another type formed for a\r\ntransitory purpose in foreign affairs: such as the Eastern Question\r\nAssociation of 1876, which opposed Disraeli's Turkish policy, and the\r\npresent Balkan Committee working for freedom in Macedonia.\r\n\r\nAll associations that attempt to influence elections are in the habit of\r\ncatechising the candidates and publishing their answers, sometimes\r\nproducing a decided effect upon the vote. Now it may be suggested that\r\nsocieties which take an active part in elections, and always throw their\r\ninfluence on the same side, ought not to be classed as non-partisan, but\r\nrather as adjuncts to the great parties; and yet they differ from the\r\ntrue ancillary organisations because their primary object as societies\r\n(whatever the personal aim of individual members may be) is not to place\r\nthe party in power, but to carry through a particular policy with which\r\nthat party happens to be more nearly in sympathy than its rival.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[462:1] Graham Wallas, in his \"Life of Francis Place,\" gives a graphic\r\ndescription of the movements in London.\r\n\r\n[462:2] For these movements see Clarkson's \"History of the Slave Trade,\"\r\n\"The Life of Wilberforce,\" by his sons, and \"The Memoirs of Sir T.\r\nFowell Buxton.\"\r\n\r\n[464:1] This does not refer to the political labour organisations that\r\nhave grown out of the trade unions, but must now be classed as regular\r\nparties. For the earlier political activity of the trade unions, as\r\nsuch, see Sidney and Beatrice Webb, \"Industrial Democracy,\" I., 247 _et\r\nseq._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nLOCAL PARTY ORGANISATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nContrasted with those bodies which are non-partisan, but extend over the\r\nwhole country, or at least over an indefinite area, stand the local\r\nparty organisations. Before the Reform Act of 1832 local organisations\r\nsuch as exist to-day for the election of parliamentary candidates were\r\nalmost unknown. They would, indeed, have been of little use in most of\r\nthe old electorates. Not to speak of the rotten boroughs, which were\r\nsold for cash, a large number of the smaller constituencies were pocket\r\nboroughs, in the hands of patrons who would not have suffered any one\r\nelse to influence the voters. In 1807, when Lord Palmerston was elected\r\nto Parliament for Newtown in the Isle of Wight, Sir Leonard Holmes, who\r\ncontrolled the seat, made a stipulation that he should \"never, even for\r\nan election, set foot in the place. So jealous was the patron lest any\r\nattempt should be made to get a new interest in the borough.\"[466:1]\r\n\r\nEven in the counties the voters were so much under the personal lead of\r\nthe landowners that party machinery would have been superfluous. A few\r\nof the large boroughs had, indeed, an extended franchise and a wide\r\nelectorate. Most notable among them was Westminster, and here a real\r\npolitical organisation for the election of members to Parliament existed\r\nfor some years before the great reform. It was, however, conducted in\r\nthe interest neither of the Whigs, nor of the Tories, but of Radical\r\nReformers, who were truly independent of both parties.[466:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Origin.]\r\n\r\nWith the extension of the franchise a change began in the political\r\nstatus of the voters. In many constituencies it was no longer enough to\r\nsecure the support of a few influential persons; and the winning of a\r\nseat by either party depended upon getting as many of its adherents as\r\npossible upon the voting lists. The watchword of the new era was given\r\nby Sir Robert Peel in his celebrated advice to the electors of Tamworth\r\nin 1841, \"Register, register, register!\" It was the more important for\r\nthe parties to take the matter in hand, because disputes about the\r\ncomplex electoral qualifications, instead of being settled on the\r\ninitiative of the state, were left to be fought out before the revising\r\nbarrister by the voters themselves, who were apt to be very negligent\r\nunless some one made a systematic effort to set them in motion. It was\r\nnot less necessary for the parties to keep the matter constantly in\r\nhand, because, the duration of Parliament being uncertain, it could not\r\nbe put off until shortly before the election. The lists must be kept\r\nalways full in view of a possible dissolution. Often the work was done\r\non behalf of the sitting member or the prospective candidate by his\r\nagent on the spot, without any formal organisation. But this was not\r\nalways true, and, in fact, the Reform Bill was no sooner enacted than\r\nlocal registration societies began to be formed, which for some years\r\nincreased rapidly in number among both Liberals and Conservatives.[467:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Early Objects.]\r\n\r\nThe primary object of the registration societies was to get the names of\r\ntheir partisans on to the lists, and keep those of their opponents off;\r\nand they are said to have done it with more zeal than fairness, often\r\nwith unjust results, for any claim or objection, though really\r\nill-founded, was likely to be allowed by the revising barrister if\r\nunopposed.[468:1] From registration a natural step led to canvassing at\r\nelection time; that is, seeking the voters in their own homes;\r\npersuading the doubtful; when possible, converting the unbelieving; and,\r\nabove all, making sure that the faithful came to the polls. This had\r\nalways been done by the candidates in popular constituencies; and now\r\nthe registration societies furnished a nucleus for the purpose, with a\r\nmass of information about the persons to be canvassed, already acquired\r\nin making up the voting lists. The nomination of candidates did not\r\nnecessarily form any part of their functions. The old theory prevailed,\r\nof which traces may be found all through English life, that the\r\ncandidate offered himself for election, or was recommended by some\r\ninfluential friend. The idea that he ought to be designated by the\r\nvoters of his party had not arisen; nor did the local societies, which\r\nwere merely self-constituted bodies, claim any right to speak for those\r\nvoters. No doubt they often selected and recommended candidates; but\r\nthey did so as a group of individuals whose opinions carried weight, not\r\nas a council representing the party.\r\n\r\nThe time was coming, however, when another extension of the franchise,\r\nand the growth of democratic ideas, would bring a demand for the\r\norganisation of the societies on a representative basis. The change\r\nbegan almost immediately after the passage of the Reform Act of 1867;\r\nand the occasion--it cannot properly be called the cause--of the\r\nmovement is curious. When discussion in England was busy with Hare's\r\nplan for proportional representation, which John Stuart Mill hailed as\r\nthe salvation of society, serious voices were heard to object to the\r\nscheme on the ground that it would lead to the growth of party\r\norganisations, and would place the voter in the grip of a political\r\nmachine.[469:1] It is, therefore, interesting to note that the first\r\noutcry in England against actual party machinery was directed at an\r\norganisation which sprang from the minute grain of minority\r\nrepresentation in the Act of 1867.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Birmingham Caucus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its Object.]\r\n\r\nBy the Reform Act of 1867 the great towns of Liverpool, Manchester,\r\nBirmingham and Leeds were given three members of Parliament apiece; but\r\nin order to provide some representation for the minority, the Lords\r\ninserted, and the Commons accepted, a clause that no elector in those\r\ntowns should vote for more than two candidates.[469:2] Much foresight\r\nwas not required to perceive that if one of those towns elected two\r\nLiberals and a Conservative, two of her members would neutralise each\r\nother on a party division, and her weight would be only one vote; while\r\na much smaller town that chose two members of the same party in the\r\nordinary way would count for two in a division. Such a result seemed to\r\nthe Radicals of Birmingham a violation of the democratic principle, and\r\nthey were determined to prevent it if possible. They had on their side\r\nmore than three fifths of the voters, or more than half as many again as\r\ntheir opponents, and this was enough to carry all three seats if their\r\nvotes were evenly distributed between three candidates. But to give to\r\nthree candidates the same number of votes when each elector could vote\r\nfor only two of them was not an easy thing to do, and failure might\r\nmean the loss of two seats. Very careful planning was required for\r\nsuccess, very strict discipline among the voters, and hence a keen\r\ninterest in the result among the mass of the people and perfect\r\nconfidence in the party managers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its Formation.]\r\n\r\nTo provide the machinery needed, Mr. William Harris, the Secretary of\r\nthe Birmingham Liberal Association, a self-constituted election\r\ncommittee of the familiar type, proposed to transform that body into a\r\nrepresentative party organisation; which was forthwith done in October,\r\n1867. The new rules provided that every Liberal subscribing a shilling\r\nshould be a member of the association, and that an annual meeting of the\r\nmembers should choose the officers and twenty members to serve upon an\r\nexecutive committee. This committee, which had charge of the general\r\nbusiness of the association, was to consist of the four officers and\r\ntwenty members already mentioned, of twenty more to be chosen by the\r\nMidland branch of the National Reform League when formed, and of three\r\nmembers chosen by a ward committee to be elected by the members of the\r\nassociation in each ward. According to a common English custom the\r\ncommittee had power to add to its members four more persons chosen, or,\r\nas the expression goes, coopted, by itself. There was also a larger\r\nbody, consisting of the whole executive committee and of not more than\r\ntwenty-four members elected by each of the ward committees. It was\r\nofficially called the general committee, but was commonly known from the\r\napproximate number of its members as \"The Four Hundred.\" It was to have\r\ncontrol of the policy of the association, and to nominate the three\r\nLiberal candidates for Parliament in the borough.[470:1]\r\n\r\nThe number of Liberal voters in each of the several wards was then\r\ncarefully ascertained; and those in one ward were directed to vote for A\r\nand B; those of another for A and C; those of a third for B and C; and\r\nso on, in such a way that the total votes cast for each of the three\r\ncandidates should be as nearly as possible the same. Protests were, of\r\ncourse, made against voting by dictation. It offended the sense of\r\npersonal independence; but the great mass of Liberals voted as they were\r\ntold, and all three of the candidates were elected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its Early Victories.]\r\n\r\nThe association had accomplished a great feat. Three Liberals had been\r\nsent to Parliament from Birmingham in spite of the minority\r\nrepresentation clause. But a chance for another victory of the same kind\r\ndid not come again until the dissolution six years later; and at first\r\nthe managers were less fortunate in the elections to the school board.\r\nThe Education Act of 1870 provided for cumulative voting at the election\r\nof these bodies; that is, the elector might cast all the votes to which\r\nhe was entitled for one candidate, or distribute them in any way he\r\npleased. The system made it possible for very small minorities to elect\r\none or more candidates, and the Liberal Association, in trying to elude\r\nits effects, as they had done in the case of the parliamentary election,\r\nattempted too much and carried only a minority of the board. For a time\r\nthe organisation languished; but it was soon recalled to a more vigorous\r\nlife than ever.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its Revival in 1873.]\r\n\r\nIn 1873 the association was revived for the purpose of getting control\r\nof the municipal government of the town, and introducing a more\r\nprogressive policy in its administration. Two names are especially\r\nassociated with the new departure, that of Mr. Schnadhorst, the\r\nsecretary of the association, who had a genius for organising, and that\r\nof Mr. Chamberlain, who was the leading spirit of the movement, and\r\nbecame the mayor of the borough in the following autumn. These men\r\nproceeded to reconstruct the association on a slightly different, and\r\napparently even more democratic, plan. Taking the wards as the sole\r\nbasis of the fabric, an annual meeting was held in each ward, at which\r\nany Liberals residing there might take part. They were entitled to do\r\nso whether voters or not, and without regard to any subscription,\r\nprovided they signified their adherence to the objects and organisation\r\nof the association, a statement which was understood to imply a\r\nwillingness to accept the decisions of the majority. The meeting elected\r\na committee, a chairman and a secretary for the ward; three persons to\r\nserve with those two officers upon the executive committee of the\r\ncentral association; and a number of persons, fixed in 1877 at thirty,\r\nto serve on the general committee. The central executive committee\r\ncontained, in addition to the five members so elected in each ward, the\r\nfour officers of the association, and thirty members coopted by itself.\r\nIt chose seven of its own members, who with the four officers formed a\r\nmanagement sub-committee of eleven. The general committee of the\r\nassociation was composed, as before, of the whole executive committee,\r\ntogether with the thirty representatives from each ward; and, as there\r\nwere sixteen wards, it numbered by 1877 five hundred and ninety-four\r\nmembers; and was known as the \"Six Hundred\" of Birmingham. It had power\r\nto determine the policy of the association, and to nominate the\r\ncandidates for Parliament and the school board. The members of the town\r\ncouncil, on the other hand, being elected by wards, were nominated by\r\nthe ward committees; but the whole association was bound to support\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its Efficiency.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the new organisation of the Liberal Association.[472:1] Its\r\nefficiency as an engine for controlling elections is proved by the fact\r\nthat during the four years from 1873 to 1876, inclusive, it carried all\r\nthree seats in Parliament in spite of the provision for minority\r\nrepresentation, a majority of the school board at each election in spite\r\nof the provision for cumulative voting, and all but two of the\r\nsixty-eight members elected to the town council during that\r\nperiod.[472:2] The association was, indeed, well constructed for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of every political organisation based upon primary\r\nmeetings, an attempt to wrest the control from those who held it was a\r\ndifficult undertaking. To be successful more than half the wards must be\r\ncaptured at one time, and that in the face of vigilant men, who knew all\r\nthe ropes, who had the management sub-committee in their hands, and who\r\nby means of cooptation could convert a narrow majority into a larger\r\none, and thus perpetuate their own power. On the other hand, a revolt\r\nagainst the nominations actually made was well-nigh precluded by the\r\nagreement virtually entered into on joining the association, to abide by\r\nthe decision of the majority. It has been said that for a dozen years\r\nthe men who conducted the organisation sent travelling companions to one\r\nward meeting after another to insure the election of their supporters to\r\nthe various committees.[473:1] Whether this be true or not, it is\r\ncertain that the power of the managers was never overturned. Their rule\r\nhas, indeed, been prolonged over such a period that it must be\r\nattributed both to the excellence of the mechanism and to their own\r\npopularity. Throughout the many vicissitudes of his long career, from\r\nhis early years of advanced radicalism, through his breach with Mr.\r\nGladstone over the Home Rule Bill, his subsequent junction with the\r\nConservatives, and finally his advocacy of a wholly new policy about\r\npreferential tariffs, Mr. Chamberlain has never failed to carry every\r\none of the parliamentary seats in Birmingham for his own adherents. Such\r\na result shows a power which nothing but a strong personal hold upon the\r\npeople, and a hold coupled with a highly efficient organisation, could\r\nhave secured.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Criticisms of the System.]\r\n\r\nThe system adopted by the Liberals in Birmingham was copied in other\r\nplaces, and soon became the subject of vehement discussion, the\r\narguments for and against it being the same that are commonly used in\r\nthe case of every party organisation. Its adversaries declared that it\r\nthrew absolute power into the hands of men with time to devote to\r\nworking the machinery; that it set up a tyranny which crushed out\r\nindividuality, extinguished free discussion of opinions, destroyed\r\nindependence in public life, caused a loss of variety and fertility in\r\nLiberalism, and brought party politics into municipal affairs where they\r\nought not to be.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its Defence.]\r\n\r\nTo these criticisms the advocates of the system replied that the\r\nassociation was conducted by the men with the most public spirit,\r\nbecause they were willing to devote time and thought to the work; that\r\nit could not create a tyranny, because the ward meetings were open to\r\nall Liberals, who could at any time overthrow the management if they\r\nchose; that, in regard to independence, every Liberal had a right to\r\nspeak freely at the ward meetings, to persuade his fellows to adopt his\r\nviews if he could, and that this is the only right he ought to enjoy,\r\nbecause \"a minority has no right to thwart a majority in determining the\r\ncourse of Liberal policy.\" They insisted that the association was simply\r\n\"a method by which those who believe in human progress . . . can take\r\ncounsel together; come to an agreement as to their nearest duty; and\r\ngive their decisions practical effect in the legislation of their town\r\nand country.\" They claimed that such men \"are bound to select\r\nrepresentatives who will support the definite measures they believe to\r\nbe immediately necessary for the peace and prosperity of the\r\nland.\"[474:1] In short the Radicals of Birmingham looked upon themselves\r\nas reformers with a mission to fulfil, and felt the impatience--perhaps\r\none may say intolerance--which men in that position always feel for the\r\nhesitating, the wavering, and the independent members of their own\r\nparty. To the Radicals the association appeared as an effective\r\ninstrument for putting their ideals into practice, and seemed wholly\r\ngood; while others, who had not the same faith in the end to be\r\nattained, felt keenly the evils which the organisation actually\r\ninvolved, and still more the abuses to which it might give rise in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Caucus and Town Politics.]\r\n\r\nIn regard to the charge of bringing politics into municipal affairs the\r\nRadicals boldly justified their course, insisting that they stood for a\r\ndefinite progressive policy in local, as well as in national,\r\naffairs.[475:1] Under the lead of Mr. Chamberlain, who was elected mayor\r\nof Birmingham in the autumn of 1873--the same year in which the\r\nassociation was revived--the town council entered upon a period of great\r\nactivity. It improved the ordinary public services, such as paving and\r\nsanitation; reorganised the health department; and inaugurated an\r\nefficient system of sewerage with a large filtration farm, which was, at\r\nleast, a great improvement on what had gone before. It undertook also a\r\nnumber of public works of a class now called \"municipal trading.\" The\r\nfirst of these was the supply of gas, both for lighting the streets and\r\nfor private use. There were at the time two gas companies in Birmingham,\r\nand Mr. Chamberlain persuaded the council that the town could make a\r\nprofit by buying their property, and conducting the business itself. A\r\nbargain was struck with the companies, and the purchase was made. It was\r\nno sooner done than a proposal was made to apply the same principle to\r\nwater, which was also in the hands of a private company. In this case,\r\nhowever, the object was not profit, but an improvement of the supply\r\nwith a view to better health, for a large part of the population still\r\ndepended upon wells, many of them, of course, in a dangerous condition.\r\nAgain a bargain was made with the company, and the water passed in turn\r\nunder public control.\r\n\r\nFinally an ambitious plan was adopted for improving the appearance of\r\nthe town. Parliament has enacted a long series of statutes intended to\r\nsecure better houses for the working classes. One of them, the Artisans\r\nand Labourers Dwellings Improvement Act of 1875,[475:2] empowered any\r\ntown, if authorised by a provisional order of the Local Government\r\nBoard confirmed by Parliament, to expropriate at its fair market value\r\nan unhealthy area, that is, a district where the crowding together or\r\nbad condition of the houses, and the want of light and air, were such as\r\nto be dangerous to health. The town was to prepare a scheme for laying\r\nout new streets and otherwise improving the area, and was authorised to\r\nsell or let any part of the land on condition that the purchasers should\r\ncarry the scheme into effect. Now Birmingham, like many of the English\r\nmanufacturing places, had grown up in a squalid way, a network of narrow\r\nstreets, devoid of space or dignity; and in the centre was a great slum\r\nwith a high death-rate. This last, a region of more than ninety acres in\r\nextent, was taken under the Act; a broad thoroughfare, named, in\r\nrecognition of its public origin, \"Corporation Street,\" was laid out,\r\nand the land bordering upon it let on long ground leases for commercial\r\nbuildings. The original intention had been to erect new houses for the\r\npeople whose dwellings had been destroyed; but this part of the plan was\r\nin the main abandoned, on the ground that houses enough were provided by\r\nprivate enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe management by a town of its gas and water supply, the purchase and\r\nlease of large tracts of land, are steps in the direction of what is\r\nknown to-day as municipal socialism; and they provoked a difference of\r\nopinion that still exists, both upon the wisdom of the policy in\r\ngeneral, and upon the extent to which it can be profitably carried. The\r\nproblem will be discussed hereafter, but we must note here that the\r\nRadicals of Birmingham believed it to be a political issue, which\r\njustified the use of party organisation as much as the issues that arose\r\nin Parliament. They felt in the same way about the administration of the\r\nnew school law. In their eyes all these things formed part of a great\r\nRadical policy of which they were the protagonists.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Spread of Associations on the Birmingham Model.]\r\n\r\nThe Birmingham Radicals had faith, not only in their political aims, but\r\nalso in the means they had devised for carrying them out. They did no\r\nlittle missionary work in other towns, urging the Liberals to introduce\r\nlocal representative associations on a democratic basis after the\r\nBirmingham pattern. In spite of opposition the idea was received with\r\nsuch favour that by the end of 1878 about one hundred bodies of this\r\nkind existed in different places.[477:1] The movement was reenforced by\r\nthe foundation, in 1877, of the National Liberal Federation, whose\r\nhistory will form the subject of a later chapter. This body admitted to\r\nmembership only associations of a democratic character, and its\r\ninfluence was strongly felt. The Birmingham leaders, who controlled the\r\nFederation, naturally desired to increase its power by extending the\r\nnumber of affiliated bodies as much as possible; while the local\r\nassociations found an advantage in joining it as soon as it became a\r\nfactor in Liberal politics. Moreover, after the split in the party over\r\nthe Home Rule Bill, in 1886, when the Federation took the side of Mr.\r\nGladstone's followers against Mr. Chamberlain, the former became\r\ninterested in making the organisation as widely representative and\r\npopular as possible. These various motives gave successive impulses,\r\nwith the result that by 1886 the Federation comprised two hundred and\r\nfifty-five local associations, and by 1888 seven hundred and\r\nsixteen.[477:2] The rules of the Federation, under the title of the\r\n\"Objects\" for which it exists, still open with the words \"To assist in\r\nthe organisation throughout the country of Liberal Associations based on\r\npopular representation,\" and the rules are preceded by a statement which\r\nsays, _All associations, thus constituted, are eligible for\r\naffiliation_. Although the statement goes on to declare that \"No\r\ninterference with the local independence of the Federated Associations\r\nis involved. Each association arranges the details of its own\r\norganisation, and administers its own affairs.\" Still it has always been\r\nassumed that the local bodies were to be popular in character. In fact\r\nthe old self-appointed committees were hardly compatible with the\r\ndemocratic spirit brought in by the Reform Act of 1867, and in the\r\nboroughs they soon gave way to representative bodies with a popular\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\nThe process was much less rapid in the country constituencies,[478:1]\r\nfor not until 1884 was the franchise in these enlarged as it had been in\r\nthe boroughs in 1867, and when that had been done the traditional\r\nauthority of the squire and the parson presented an obstacle that\r\nyielded slowly. Even now Conservative candidates are returned unopposed\r\nmore frequently in the counties than in the boroughs, especially in the\r\nrural counties of the south. Often it was found impossible to establish\r\na Liberal association in each parish, and a local correspondent was, and\r\nin some cases still is, a necessary substitute. But the growth of\r\ndemocratic ideas, the practice of popular election, the change in\r\neconomic conditions caused by the decay of agricultural prosperity and\r\nthe desire to live in cities, with the consequent scarcity of rural\r\nlabour, have, by reducing the patriarchal influence of the landlord over\r\nhis people, paved the way for representative political organisations. At\r\nthe present day associations democratic in form exist in almost every\r\nparliamentary constituency, whether borough or county, where the number\r\nof Liberal voters is not so small, or the chance of success at elections\r\nis not so desperate, that the district is what is sometimes officially\r\ncalled derelict.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Existing Organisation of Local Liberal Associations.]\r\n\r\nThe constitutions of the local Liberal associations are not precisely\r\nuniform, nor, apart from the general principle that they ought to be\r\nbased upon popular representation, is any pressure exerted to make them\r\nalike. The Liberals in each place are at liberty to organise themselves\r\nas they please; and in this connection it may be observed that all\r\npolitical societies are treated as purely voluntary, that is, the state\r\nmakes no attempt to regulate them by law. The provisions in regard to\r\nprimaries and the nomination of candidates by party conventions, which\r\nhave become universal in the United States, are entirely foreign to\r\nEnglish ideas, and would be regarded with astonishment and aversion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Draft Rules.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rural Districts.]\r\n\r\nBut while the Federation does not strive to enforce uniform regulations,\r\nit issues a pamphlet of \"Notes and Hints for the Guidance of Liberals,\"\r\ncovering organisations both in rural villages and in towns, and\r\ncontaining drafts of rules, which may be taken as typical. The pamphlet\r\nsuggests that in rural districts there should be normally, in each\r\nparish or polling district, a self-appointed committee with power to add\r\nto its own members. The term \"committee\" is used because the members,\r\nbeing few, can do most of the work directly, instead of delegating it to\r\na smaller body. In reality the committee is the whole association for\r\nthe parish, and although the draft rules do not expressly so provide,\r\nthe intention is clear that it shall include all known Liberals there,\r\nwhether voters or not. It must meet at least six times in the year; and\r\nelects a chairman, treasurer, honorary secretary, and any sub-committees\r\nthat may be needed. It appoints, also, in proportion to population,\r\ndelegates to the Liberal association for the parliamentary division,\r\nwhich selects the candidate of the party for the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Small Towns.]\r\n\r\nFor small towns without wards the model organisation is similar, except\r\nthat the primary body is called an association, and meets only once a\r\nyear, unless convened at other times on the request of twelve members;\r\ncurrent business being transacted by an executive committee composed of\r\nthe officers, and of a certain number of other members chosen at the\r\nannual meeting. Above the associations for the parish or polling\r\ndistrict, and the small town, comes an association for the parliamentary\r\ndivision of the county in which they are situated. This is often, though\r\nnot always, purely a representative body, without any mass meeting of\r\nmembers. It has a council, composed mainly of delegates chosen from the\r\nparishes, towns, or other primary districts, roughly in proportion to\r\npopulation; and an executive committee, sometimes elected entirely by\r\nthe council, sometimes containing delegates from the districts. Finally\r\nit has its officers who are members of both these bodies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Large Towns.]\r\n\r\nFor large towns, that are divided into wards, the draft rules follow\r\nmore closely the Birmingham plan. They provide in each ward for a\r\ncommittee or association designed to include every man who is disposed\r\nto help the Liberal cause. This body elects its officers, the other\r\nmembers of its executive committee, and delegates to the general\r\ncommittee for the town according to population. The association for the\r\nwhole town meets annually to choose its officers, some members of the\r\ngeneral committee, and, in case the town is not a parliamentary borough,\r\ndelegates to the association for the division of the county. The\r\nassociation for the town is managed, as is usually the case in all\r\norganisations of this kind, by three distinct authorities. First, the\r\nofficers, who attend to current administration. Second, the executive\r\ncommittee, which consists of these officers, of the three officers of\r\neach ward, and of members chosen by the general committee. Third, the\r\ngeneral committee itself, which determines the policy to be pursued, and\r\nis composed of members elected in part by the ward committees and in\r\npart by the annual meeting of the whole association for the town. In\r\nparliamentary boroughs the general committee--often known as the\r\nCouncil, and sometimes as the Liberal Two Hundred, or whatever the\r\nnearest hundred may be--nominates the party candidate for the House of\r\nCommons, on the recommendation of the executive committee, and subject\r\nto final adoption at a meeting of the association. But in fact the\r\nexecutive committee, in all Liberal associations for parliamentary\r\nconstituencies, either selects the candidate, and asks for a formal\r\napproval by the council, or lays before that body two or three names to\r\nchoose from. In any case the meeting of the whole association is merely\r\na grand ratification gathering held for applause, not for consultation.\r\nThe effect is like that of the ancient proclamation, \"this is your king\r\nan' it please you.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Variations in Different Places.]\r\n\r\nThe draft rules prepared by the Federation are merely typical, and\r\nalthough in their general outlines they give a very fair idea of the\r\norganisation of local associations throughout the country, there are\r\nendless variations in detail and in nomenclature. If, indeed, the\r\nconstitutions of a number of these bodies are examined at random, no two\r\nof them will probably be found exactly alike. It may be observed that\r\nthe draft rules make no provision for cooptation, an arrangement that\r\nappears nevertheless in the rules of many local associations. Nor do\r\nthey require the payment of any subscription as a condition for\r\nmembership; but this again is not infrequently done, the sum required\r\nrunning from a nominal amount up as high as five shillings. Sometimes\r\nthe payment is a condition for any participation in the organisation;\r\nsometimes it is not needed for voting in the ward or district meetings,\r\nbut confers a right to vote in the general meetings of the association,\r\nor to be elected to the committees by cooptation. Occasionally Liberal\r\nmembers of the town council and school board have _ex officio_ seats on\r\nthe council of the association; or local Liberal clubs, although not\r\nstrictly democratic, are given a representation upon it. But owing to\r\nthe fact, which will be explained hereafter, that the competition for\r\nnomination to Parliament is not very keen, and hence there is rarely a\r\nclose canvass of the members of the committees, all these differences in\r\ndetail are of little practical importance. The essential point is that\r\nin almost every English parliamentary constituency, whether county or\r\nborough, where the chance of carrying the election is fair, there is\r\nto-day an association of a representative and nominally, at least, of a\r\ndemocratic character. It contains habitually the three organs, of\r\nofficers, executive committee, and council; while in the great towns\r\nthat have several seats there is a still larger organisation comprising\r\nall the parliamentary divisions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Paid Agents.]\r\n\r\nIt is an old custom for parliamentary candidates to employ paid agents,\r\nusually solicitors by profession, to take charge of the election, and\r\nwith the growth of popular organisations the business has assumed in\r\nmost places a more systematic form. The association for each\r\nparliamentary division, and sometimes for a smaller district, has a paid\r\nas well as an honorary secretary. His duties are many, for he is the\r\nmaid-of-all-work of the organisation, and is known by the comprehensive\r\ntitle of Liberal Agent for that division. He acts as clerk for the\r\nassociation, organises committees for wards or polling districts,\r\nsupervises subordinate agents, arranges public meetings, gives advice\r\nand assistance wherever needed, canvasses the voters, attends to their\r\nregistration, and conducts the hearings before the Revising Barrister.\r\nHe is also usually appointed by the candidate his statutory election\r\nagent; and, if so, he takes general charge of the whole campaign, having\r\nunder him a band of clerks, sub-agents, and messengers, and a small army\r\nof volunteer canvassers. He is an important factor in politics; for upon\r\nhis skill as an organiser, and his tact and good sense in conducting the\r\nfight, the result of the election may often depend.\r\n\r\nThese agents have been said to be the only professional politicians in\r\nEngland; and in one sense that is true, for they are the only class of\r\nmen who make a living out of party politics; but the expression is\r\ninappropriate, because they are not politicians at all in the sense in\r\nwhich the term is used in other countries. They have nothing to do with\r\nthe direction of politics; they merely help to elect a candidate in\r\nwhose selection they have no voice; and although their advice may have\r\nweight, their duty is solely to carry out the instructions of others.\r\nLike all other permanent officials in England, their actual influence\r\ndepends upon circumstances. If a chairman is capable and active, the\r\npower of the agent will not be so great as in the more common case where\r\nthe chairman leans very much upon him. The agents, in short, are more\r\nnearly akin to the permanent official than to the politician. In fact\r\nthey have no political aspirations for themselves, for they are not of\r\nthe class from which members of Parliament are taken.\r\n\r\nTheir salaries, which vary much, run all the way from forty pounds to\r\nfour hundred pounds, with about one hundred and fifty pounds as the\r\naverage, the scale of pay having risen somewhat of late years. They must\r\nbe thoroughly familiar with the law of registration and election, and\r\nare commonly recruited from solicitors with a small practice, or from\r\naccountants; although many of them--perhaps nearly one half--finding\r\nthat their work as agents fills their whole time, have given up all\r\nother business. The occupation tends, indeed, to become a profession by\r\nitself; one to which a man devotes his life after he has once entered\r\nit. The Liberal agents have a national association of their own,\r\ncontaining some two hundred and fifty members, and a few years ago, in\r\norder to maintain a higher standard, a smaller society was formed, which\r\nissues certificates of qualification. The association meets every year\r\nat the time of the meeting of the National Liberal Federation, and such\r\nof the agents attend as can afford to go, or can get their employers to\r\npay their expenses. They meet usually about one hundred and fifty\r\nstrong, and are given a breakfast at which they are addressed by the\r\nchief whip, and by the leader of the party in Parliament or some other\r\nprominent member; for their importance is now thoroughly appreciated.\r\nThus there has arisen in English political life a class of men whose\r\ncounterpart exists in no other country. They occupy in the party a\r\nposition not unlike that of the non-commissioned officers in the army.\r\nTheir work is essential to success, but they have no hope of promotion\r\nbeyond their own grade. Their position is perfectly well understood, and\r\nthey tend to surround it with professional safeguards and supports.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Liberal Agents in Scotland.]\r\n\r\nIn Scotland political associations with paid agents have developed more\r\nslowly than in England; partly because a great deal of the work\r\nconnected with registration, which falls upon the party agents in\r\nEngland, is done by the public authorities north of the Tweed; and\r\npartly because it was the old Scotch habit to have election business,\r\nlike everything else, conducted for the candidate by his regular\r\nattorney. The result is that although there are many Liberal\r\nassociations in Scotland, and the agents have tended to become a class\r\nso far as to form a society among themselves, they have as a rule much\r\nless work to do than in England, and are still usually paid almost\r\nentirely out of the candidate's own pocket. Hence, when he is defeated,\r\nand gives up the fight, the constituency is apt to lose its agent\r\naltogether, and become derelict.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conservative Local Organisations.]\r\n\r\nContrary to the prevailing opinion, the Conservatives have, in the\r\nmatter of party organisation, been more than once the first in the\r\nfield; and although their machinery has neither been so democratic nor\r\nattracted so much attention as that of the Liberals, it has been on the\r\nwhole more effective. The Reform Act of 1832 was no sooner passed than\r\nthey began energetically to form registration societies; and the\r\nextension of the borough franchise in 1867 brought a renewed activity.\r\nThey tried at once to enlist the interest, and win the support, of the\r\nworkingmen who had been made voters in large numbers. At the general\r\nelection of the following year they worked in vain, but in a short time\r\nthey succeeded so well, that at the next election, in 1874, they\r\nobtained a majority in the House of Commons for the first time since\r\n1841. Their victory was, indeed, commonly attributed to their superior\r\norganisation, a fact which gave a powerful incentive to the adoption by\r\ntheir rivals of Mr. Chamberlain's plan for a National Liberal\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Growth after 1867.]\r\n\r\nConservative associations of a modern type had, indeed, been formed in\r\nsome places long before 1867,[484:1] but the Act of that year gave a new\r\nand vigorous impulse. It had hardly been enacted when local\r\nassociations, largely composed of workingmen, sprang up, especially in\r\nthe manufacturing districts of the north. Some of them were very large,\r\nthe one at Bradford, for example, had, by 1872, twenty-five hundred\r\nmembers, and was believed to have caused the change in the politics of\r\nthe place.[485:1] The associations increased rapidly in number. In 1871\r\nthere were two hundred and eighty-nine of them; in 1872, three hundred\r\nand forty-eight; in 1873, four hundred and seven; in 1874, four hundred\r\nand forty-seven; in 1875, four hundred and seventy-two, besides two\r\nhundred and twenty-eight branch associations; and in 1876 the number of\r\nConservative associations of every kind in England and Wales was nearly\r\neight hundred.[485:2] A considerable part of them were composed almost\r\nentirely of the artisan class. Many societies had, indeed, been\r\norganised under the name of Conservative Working Men's Associations, and\r\nthese had set up a separate national union among themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: They Become Representative.]\r\n\r\nThe associations formed at this time seem to have been voluntary bodies\r\nwithout a representative character, and in fact some of them were turned\r\ninto clubs, in order to make them more attractive, or, according to the\r\nexpression then used, to enable the members to obtain recreation as well\r\nas knowledge. But if the new Conservative associations were unlike the\r\nBirmingham Caucus, the size of their membership made them also very\r\nunlike the old registration societies. The object was not now merely to\r\nsee that the faithful were properly registered, but to recruit\r\nsupporters, stimulate enthusiasm, and discipline a fighting force among\r\nthe masses of the people. The Conservatives are more easily led by\r\nauthority than the Liberals, but the time was at hand when even among\r\nthem more democratic forms were needed. After Mr. Gladstone's victory at\r\nthe elections of 1880 a cry was again heard that the result was due to\r\nbetter organisation; in this case to the Birmingham Caucus, and\r\ncuriously enough to the paid agents which it employed.[486:1] The\r\nmovement among the Conservatives towards more popular forms of party\r\nmachinery began with the associations in the large towns, which felt\r\nkeenly the competition of the Liberal hundreds with their closely knit\r\nfabric of representative committees based on open meetings in the wards.\r\nIn these places the Conservatives copied the organisation of their\r\nrivals, and thence the fashion spread gradually over the country,\r\nreceiving an additional impetus in 1887, when the National Union of\r\nConservative Associations was itself remodelled upon a wider basis, with\r\na series of representative councils.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Existing Conservative Local Organisations.]\r\n\r\nLike the National Liberal Federation, the Conservative central office\r\nhas issued draft rules to serve as models for local associations, and\r\nthey may be regarded as typical. In the case of a borough the ward\r\npolling district, or such other subdivision as shall be found\r\nconvenient, is suggested as the primary unit. In each of these there is\r\nto be a branch association, composed of all the Conservatives in the\r\ndistrict who subscribe not less than one shilling to its funds. The\r\nbranch association, at a mass meeting of its members, is to elect a\r\npresident, a chairman, an honorary secretary and a treasurer, a\r\ncommittee to manage its affairs, and representatives to the central\r\ncommittee for the borough, in the proportion of one for every two\r\nhundred voters upon the parliamentary register. The central association\r\nfor the whole borough is to consist of the members of the various\r\nbranches. It is to hold general meetings for the choice of its\r\nofficers; but it is to be managed by a central committee composed of the\r\nofficers and representatives of the branch associations, together with\r\nthe officers of any Conservative clubs in the borough, and\r\nrepresentatives of the local Habitations of the Primrose League. This\r\ncommittee, being large, is authorised to delegate any of its powers to\r\nan executive committee, and other sub-committees, subject to\r\nratification of their acts. In order to stimulate the necessary\r\nsubscriptions, the rules provide, in accordance with a common\r\nConservative practice, that all members who contribute not less than one\r\nguinea a year shall be styled Vice-President; but in this case they are\r\ngiven no power, and the title is their sole reward. The model rules for\r\nthe parliamentary division of a county are framed upon the same lines,\r\nexcept that, when possible, associations are to be organised in each\r\nparish. This involves an additional wheel in the machinery, the\r\nparochial meetings electing the committee for the polling district; and\r\nthe district meeting, which consists of all the members of the parish\r\nassociations, electing the central committee for the parliamentary\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Complex Type--Bradford.]\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the Liberal party, the model rules issued by the\r\ncentral office are merely typical, and although the general principles\r\nof organisation in the different local bodies are the same, there are\r\ngreat variations in detail. The Conservative Association of Bradford may\r\nbe taken as a good example of the more complex forms. Here the\r\ngeographical elements are the polling district, the ward, the three\r\nparliamentary divisions, and the borough as a whole; the committees in\r\neach of these being constructed by a combination of direct election, and\r\nof representation both of the smaller units and of clubs. Thus the\r\npolling district has a committee, composed of all the members of the\r\nparty therein, which elects, besides its own officers, ten\r\nrepresentatives to the ward association--of whom three are designated to\r\nserve on the ward executive--five representatives to the council for the\r\nparliamentary division, and two to the general council for the borough.\r\nThe ward association consists of the officers and representatives of the\r\npolling districts; of representatives of any constitutional associations\r\nwithin the ward; and of subscribers to the amount of five shillings a\r\nyear. It has an executive committee composed of the officers for the\r\nward, and of the officers and representatives of the polling districts.\r\nThe chief business of the ward association is registration, and the\r\nnomination and election of candidates for the city council, the\r\nmunicipal contests in Bradford being conducted on party lines. The\r\ndivisional association consists of all persons who subscribe a shilling,\r\nor are enrolled as members of a polling district committee. Its business\r\nis conducted by a council containing the officers and five other members\r\nchosen at the annual mass meeting, the officers of ward and polling\r\ndistrict associations, and representatives both from those associations,\r\nand from Conservative clubs. It acts, however, largely by means of\r\nsub-committees.\r\n\r\nFinally the general association for the borough, with a similar\r\nqualification for membership, has, besides the ordinary officers, a long\r\nlist of vice-chairmen, which includes all persons subscribing two pounds\r\na year to its funds. The general council is composed of all these\r\nofficers, of representatives from the divisions, polling districts and\r\nclubs, and in addition, of all men who pay one guinea a year--another\r\ninstance of giving special privileges to the larger subscribers. The\r\nexecutive for the borough, styled the Finance and General Purposes\r\nCommittee, consists of thirty members elected by the council; of\r\nrepresentatives of the two leading clubs; of officers of the divisional\r\nassociations; and of all the officers of the central association,\r\nincluding the vice-chairmen. Now, in 1900, the vice-chairmen formed a\r\nmajority of the committee, and many of them must have acquired the\r\nposition by reason of subscriptions to the funds. This is important not\r\nonly because the management of the association as a whole is really in\r\nthe hands of the General Purposes Committee, but especially because the\r\nrules require the divisional councils to invite that committee to be\r\npresent for consultation at the meetings held for the selection of\r\nparliamentary candidates. The privilege so conferred is, however, merely\r\npotential, for it is almost universally the case in Conservative\r\nassociations that the nomination of candidates for the House of Commons\r\nis arranged by the executive body or by a sub-committee thereof, and is\r\nsimply accepted by the council.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extent of Conservative Associations.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Paid Agents.]\r\n\r\nConservative associations of a popular character, with subordinate\r\nbranches more or less fully developed, now exist in almost every\r\nparliamentary constituency in England and Wales, and in all but a few of\r\nthose in Scotland, the central office of the party being engaged in a\r\nceaseless effort to perfect the organisation wherever it remains\r\nincomplete. Unless in a very feeble state, the associations have their\r\nprofessional secretaries or agents, who are paid, on the average, a\r\nlittle higher salaries than their Liberal rivals, and are, therefore, it\r\nis claimed, on the whole, a better grade of men. The Conservative, like\r\nthe Liberal, agents have societies of their own; a mutual benevolent\r\nsociety, and a national association with subordinate branches which\r\nadmits members only on examination.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Similarity of Liberal and Conservative Associations.]\r\n\r\nAt the present day local party organisation has been brought to a high\r\nstate of efficiency in England, each party having covered almost the\r\nwhole of Great Britain with a tessellated pavement of associations.\r\nThese are especially complete in the boroughs, for on both sides the\r\nmachinery in the rural parts of counties is less fully developed. The\r\nConservatives have done their work a little more thoroughly than the\r\nLiberals, because with more rich men in their ranks they have larger\r\nresources in money, and can maintain paid agents in more constituencies\r\nwhere the chance of success is small. In general character the local\r\nassociations of the two parties do not differ greatly, the most obvious\r\ncontrasts being the common use of cooptation by the Liberals, and the\r\nspecial privileges accorded to the larger subscribers among the\r\nConservatives. But neither of these things is universal, and in their\r\nessential features the local organisations of both parties are framed\r\nupon the same general principles. Both of them are democratic in form,\r\nadmitting all adherents of the party, or all who pay a small\r\nsubscription. Both are in form representative, the affairs of the\r\nassociations being managed by a series of councils and committees,\r\ncomposed mainly of delegates whose authority is based ultimately upon\r\nmass meetings of all the members.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[466:1] Bulwer, \"Life of Palmerston,\" I., 23-24.\r\n\r\n[466:2] _Cf._ Wallas, \"Life of Francis Place,\" Chs. ii., v.\r\n\r\n[467:1] By 1837 Conservative registration societies had become common\r\nthroughout the country.

Mr.\r\nOstrogorski appears to look on democracy, and on party machinery in\r\nparticular, from the outside, as something artificial and weird, rather\r\nthan the natural result of human conduct under the existing conditions.\r\nHe does not seem to put himself quite in the shoes of Mr. Chamberlain,\r\nMr. Gladstone, Mr. Schnadhorst, Lord Randolph Churchill, Lord Salisbury,\r\nCaptain Middleton, or other men who have come into contact with the\r\nparty organisations, and ask what he himself would, or might, have done\r\nin the same position. Hence his analysis has a slight air of unreality,\r\nand does not wholly approve itself as a study of ordinary political\r\nmotives. But apart from this criticism, the work is admirably done, and\r\nis an invaluable contribution to political science.\r\n\r\n[468:1] Ostrogorski, I., 156-58.\r\n\r\n[469:1] Trevelyan, \"A Few Remarks on Mr. Hare's Scheme of\r\nRepresentation.\" _Macmillan_, April, 1862; Bagehot, \"English\r\nConstitution,\" 1 Ed., 188-94; and see Hans. 3 Ser.

Part\r\nof its stock in trade is the pretence that it is more powerful, and more\r\nwidely representative, than it really is. Much of its success depends\r\nupon the old Chinese military policy of scaring the enemy by an imposing\r\nappearance before the fight begins. In ordinary times of public\r\ninattention the _vox populi_ may be manufactured by a small number of\r\npersons, for the mass of the people are rarely interested until an issue\r\nhas been presented to them, and the framing of that issue, which may be\r\nby far the most important step in the whole process, is often done at a\r\nmeeting of half a dozen men. All the members of the party may have a\r\nright to attend that meeting, but they will not do so, or if they do the\r\nprivate conference will take place earlier, and the meeting will simply\r\ndecide upon the acceptance of plans prepared beforehand. This is a law\r\nof human nature resulting from the fact that a large assembly can only\r\nsay Yes or No. It does not mean that the desires of the public are\r\nperverted, for as a rule it has none that are strong or definite. It\r\nmeans that the number of people who care enough to take an active part\r\nin the formative stage is small, and in the long run they get control of\r\nthe wires whether as an elected or a self-constituted committee. The\r\nsham consists in making it appear that the plan proposed expresses the\r\npreconceived wish of a large body of people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Local Associations Controlled by a Few Men.]\r\n\r\nIn England the element of sham in the party organisations is as great as\r\nit is elsewhere. Although the council of a local association is a\r\nnumerous body, and gives the appearance of a highly popular institution,\r\nthe association, as a whole, usually contains among its enrolled members\r\nnot more than one tenth, or at most one fifth of the voters belonging to\r\nthe party; and the meetings for the election of delegates to the various\r\ncouncils and committees are thinly attended.[492:1] The organisation is,\r\nin fact, managed, as a rule, by a few men influenced to a greater or\r\nless extent by the paid agent. They are often, especially among the\r\nLiberals, tradesmen or even workingmen, who take an active interest in\r\npolitics, without cherishing any parliamentary aspirations for\r\nthemselves, or any political ambition unless it be for municipal office;\r\nbut they like, especially if Conservatives, to take for their chairman a\r\nman of higher social position. Moreover, there seems to be little\r\nrivalry for the positions that give a control of the body. On the\r\ncontrary, one is much more impressed in ordinary times by the efforts of\r\nan organising secretary, spurred on from above, to interest people in\r\nforming associations in unpromising districts, than by struggles for\r\npower in the most active associations. In England the stage at which\r\npublic interest awakes is the election, the process of selecting the\r\ncandidates arousing little attention. While, therefore, the franchise is\r\nwide, and the number of people who vote is very great, the nomination is\r\nreally made by a body of men no larger than the voters in an ordinary\r\nborough before 1832.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Possibility of their Capture.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: For Personal Motives.]\r\n\r\nOne might suppose that under such conditions it would be easy for a\r\nsmall knot of adroit and persistent men, or even for a single\r\nresourceful manipulator, to capture a local association; but in normal\r\ntimes there is little incentive to do so. To explain fully why this is\r\nthe case would anticipate much that remains to be said about the social\r\nand political traditions of England. Yet some of the reasons can readily\r\nbe suggested. The expense of maintaining the organisation and a seat in\r\nParliament is large, and the funds must be provided by somebody. If they\r\nare subscribed from public spirit by local men who do not want the seat\r\nthemselves, those persons will naturally control the association. If\r\nthey are defrayed by the candidate, or member of Parliament, then under\r\nordinary circumstances he will control so far as his own seat is\r\nconcerned; and by nursing and courting the constituency, or by his\r\npolitical reputation, he will probably have built up a popularity among\r\nthe voters which the association cannot defy. The expense limits,\r\ntherefore, the class of persons who might want to capture the\r\nassociation in order to control the nomination to the House of Commons;\r\nnor among those who could afford the cost is there much object in so\r\ndoing. If, as in some other countries, nominations were confined by law\r\nor by custom to residents of the constituency, the rivalry between two\r\nor three aspirants for the honour might become intense; but in England\r\nthe local man has little advantage over a stranger, and if the party\r\nassociation in his own place is unwilling to accept him, the expenditure\r\nof labour, time and money required to capture it would probably be much\r\ngreater than would procure him a nomination elsewhere. Apart from the\r\npersonal privilege of sitting in the House there are no strong selfish\r\nmotives for getting control of a local organisation. The member of\r\nParliament has no patronage to distribute among the men to whom he owes\r\nhis seat; and although the association may lead to the town council, or\r\neven the honourable post of a justice of the peace, these are not in\r\nthemselves objects of keen emulation, nor are they stepping-stones to\r\nhigher things beyond.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: For Political Objects.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is no object under ordinary circumstances in capturing a\r\nlocal association with a view to promoting a political policy; for the\r\npolicy of the party is directed by the parliamentary leaders, in the\r\ncabinet or on the front Opposition Bench, and the local party voter has,\r\nas a rule, little sympathy for the member who weakens the party by\r\nthwarting them. There are, however, cases of deep political cleavage in\r\nthe party ranks before the leaders have agreed upon a policy, when there\r\nmay be the strongest incentive to capture the local organisations in\r\norder to turn the scale. The breach among the Liberals over the first\r\nHome Rule Bill was an example of that kind, and had Mr. Gladstone given\r\na longer premonition of his plans there would, no doubt, have been a\r\nstruggle for the control of the local Liberal associations all over the\r\ncountry. The recent agitation for fiscal reform furnished another\r\ninstance of the same kind, and a very striking one; because the\r\nConservative leader not only took no positive stand on the question, but\r\nintimated that the party could adopt no definite policy on the subject\r\nuntil the next election. Under these conditions the attitude of the\r\nlocal Conservative organisations became of the utmost importance, and it\r\nis said that a systematic effort was made by the members of the Tariff\r\nReform League to capture them in the interest of the reform. Certainly\r\nmany of them showed that they held very definite opinions on the point,\r\nsometimes absolutely opposed to those of their sitting member.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation of an M.P. to his Association.]\r\n\r\nConnected with this question is another: that of the relation of a\r\nmember of Parliament to the association of his constituency. In the\r\nearly days of the Birmingham Caucus, shortly after it had begun to\r\nspread over England, a case of friction between a sitting member and the\r\nlocal association occurred, which caused much controversy and no little\r\nalarm. The caucus was the bugbear of the day, and men feared that it was\r\nabout to turn the representative into a mere instrument to register the\r\ndecisions of a party machine--an anxiety heightened by the fact that the\r\nnew associations were in the hands of the Radical wing of the party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Case of Mr. Forster.]\r\n\r\nMr. W. E. Forster, in carrying through Parliament the Education Act of\r\n1870, had offended the more extreme Radicals, because the act did not\r\nprovide that education supported by public rates should be compulsory\r\nand free, and because, in their eyes, it treated the Church schools with\r\ntoo much favour. Although opposed by the Radicals, he was reelected for\r\nBradford in 1874 by the help of Conservative votes; but in 1878 he came\r\ninto collision with the Liberal association which had just been formed\r\nthere. One of its rules provided that any one proposed for nomination to\r\nParliament must give an assurance to the general committee that he would\r\nabide by their decision in regard to the selection of the candidate. To\r\nthat condition Mr. Forster refused to submit, denying the right of any\r\nassociation to come between him and his constituents. The association\r\ninsisted upon its rule, and the controversy in Bradford provoked a\r\ndiscussion in the public press of the country. In the end the matter was\r\ncompromised by changing the rule so as to read that such an assurance\r\n\"may be required\" instead of \"shall be required,\" and Mr. Forster\r\nallowed his name to be submitted to the general committee. He had won\r\nhis point, for he had been nominated without giving the assurance; but\r\nhis troubles with the association were not at an end. In 1882 he\r\nresigned from Mr. Gladstone's ministry because he disapproved of the\r\nso-called Kilmainham treaty, and before long the quarrel broke out\r\nagain, continuing until his death in 1886.[495:1] The particular\r\nprovision which gave occasion to the dispute in 1878 has not proved a\r\npermanent source of difficulty, for the local associations have not been\r\nin the habit of demanding a pledge of that kind, and on the other hand\r\nthe ordinary rules of fair play require that a man who allows his name\r\nto be proposed for nomination shall abide by the decision of the body to\r\nwhich he submits it, unless he feels that he has been unjustly treated,\r\nor unless some important question of policy is involved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Local Pressure on Members Neither New nor Systematic.]\r\n\r\nA much more important matter is the control exerted by the local party\r\nassociation over its representative in the House of Commons, whether by\r\nurging him to take a particular line of action, by refusing a\r\nrenomination, or even by the more drastic measure of requesting his\r\nresignation in case he fails to comply with its opinion. Mr. Ostrogorski\r\nlays great stress upon the quarrel in 1885 between the Liberal\r\nassociation in Newcastle and Mr. Joseph Cowen, who had taken a highly\r\nindependent attitude in Parliament, and had not given a consistent\r\nsupport to the Liberal cabinet.[496:1] No one would assert that an\r\nassociation, any more than an individual voter, is bound to support a\r\ncandidate of whose views and conduct in public affairs it seriously\r\ndisapproves, because he is an estimable person. Yet this was very nearly\r\nthe relation of Mr. Cowen to the local association. Voters and\r\norganisations must consider the opinions as well as the personality of\r\nthe candidate, and this they may well do without reducing him to a mere\r\nmouthpiece of their wishes.\r\n\r\nBut in order to determine the real import of an attempt to fetter the\r\nindependence of a member of Parliament, one must consider how far it\r\nintroduced a new practice into English politics, and for what purposes\r\nthe claim of the association to call the member to account has been\r\nused. The question whether a member of Parliament is the agent of his\r\nconstituents, morally bound to carry out their wishes, or whether he is\r\nto act solely according to his own opinion of the interest of the whole\r\nkingdom, is as old as Burke's famous discussion with the electors of\r\nBristol. The latter view always has been, and still is, the prevailing\r\none in theory; but the charge that the representatives have become mere\r\ndelegates has been constantly cropping up. In 1849, for example, very\r\nnearly at the high-water mark of independence in Parliament, and long\r\nbefore the party machine had been thought of, there were complaints\r\nabout the thraldom of members to their constituents.[496:2] A member\r\nmust always have been more or less in bondage in the proprietary\r\nboroughs, and this continued in some places after the first Reform Act.\r\nAs late as 1857 Sir Stafford Northcote gave up his seat for Dudley\r\nbecause he found that he practically represented Lord Ward.[496:3] The\r\nexercise of control over their member by influential constituents is,\r\ntherefore, not a new thing, and the advent of the modern party\r\nassociations has not, as men feared, developed it into a system. No\r\ndoubt the Liberal caucus in the days of its youth tried to bring an\r\norganised pressure to bear upon the members,[497:1] but this has\r\ndiminished rather than increased of late years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Question When a Member Ought to Resign.]\r\n\r\nThe question under what circumstances a member ought to resign his seat\r\nis one which always has been, and always will be, perplexing. The\r\ndoctrine that he must resign simply because the local party association\r\nasks him to do so can be confidently asserted to have made little or no\r\nheadway in either of the two great parties. But that a member who has\r\npledged himself expressly or tacitly to the support of a certain policy,\r\nand then changes his mind, may, in some cases, be bound in honour to go\r\nback to his constituents, would hardly be denied. Whether such an\r\nobligation has arisen or not must depend upon the circumstances, and\r\nupon the definiteness and importance of the pledge or understanding.\r\nWhen Peel decided to bring in the bill for Catholic Emancipation, to\r\nwhich he had previously been openly opposed, he felt constrained to\r\nresign his seat for Oxford, and was defeated for reelection to his great\r\ngrief;[497:2] but he did not feel under a similar duty when converted to\r\nthe repeal of the Corn Laws, and was reproached on that account by\r\nDisraeli.[497:3]\r\n\r\nA candidate who seeks election as a member of a party, or as a supporter\r\nof a cabinet, may well be considered to have given a general pledge to\r\nremain in the party or to support that cabinet, so that if he ceases\r\nentirely to do so he may be bound to resign. This is the form in which\r\nthe question has arisen of late between members and local associations,\r\nbut both obligation and actual practice are as unsettled to-day as\r\nsimilar questions have been in the past. When the South African War\r\nbroke out a few members on the government side of the House felt unable\r\nto support the cabinet on that question. One of them, Sir Edward Clarke,\r\nwho sat for Plymouth, was requested by the Conservative association of\r\nthe borough to resign, and did so,[498:1] provoking comment favourable\r\nand otherwise. The same action was proposed in the case of Mr. (now\r\nLord) Courtney; but he took the ground that as a Liberal Unionist he had\r\nprofessed to support the cabinet only on the issue of Home Rule, and had\r\ncaused his independence upon other matters to be clearly understood. The\r\nmotion to request his resignation was defeated in the Liberal Unionist\r\nassociation of his constituency,[498:2] but he was not renominated at\r\nthe next general election. In the same Parliament Mr. (now Sir) George\r\nDoughty, who, for other reasons, crossed the floor from the Liberal to\r\nthe government side, resigned his seat at Great Grimsby, and was\r\nreelected by an increased majority. While in the following Parliament\r\nSir Michael Foster and Mr. Winston Churchill crossed in the opposite\r\ndirection, without feeling bound to resign. The former, representing a\r\nuniversity, had, indeed, stated at the election that he was by no means\r\na strict party man, and retained his seat after a good deal of\r\nreflection.[498:3] Other cases of a radical change of policy could be\r\ncited, but these are enough to show that local party organisations have\r\nnot fastened on their members chains that can be used with certainty to\r\nwithdraw them from their seats even in so strong a case as an open\r\nbreach with their party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Refusal to Renominate.]\r\n\r\nThe refusal of support for reelection, by men of decisive influence in a\r\nconstituency, on the ground that they cannot approve the course pursued\r\nby their representative, is a thing that must always happen; although it\r\ndid not take the form of withholding a nomination by a party association\r\nuntil bodies of that kind came into being. A refusal made by powerful\r\nindividuals was not less effective because they were not styled a\r\nrepresentative committee. But such refusals, by whomsoever made, have\r\nalways been rare. Nothing, indeed, impresses a foreign observer of\r\nBritish politics more than the universal recognition of the claim of a\r\nsitting member to renomination. So far as his own party is concerned his\r\ntenure of office is good behaviour, and at the present day the local\r\nassociation very seldom fails to renominate him, save in two cases; one\r\nwhere his course of action has been nearly tantamount to a change of\r\nparty, a going over to the enemy; the other where the party itself is\r\ndeeply cleft over a vital question on which the leaders have given an\r\nuncertain sound. This last was true in the general election of 1906,\r\nwhen several of the local party organisations were sharply divided upon\r\nthe issue of fiscal policy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of Local Associations Used for Party Cohesion.]\r\n\r\nThe fear that the local associations, by dictating to their member a\r\ngiven course of action, by requesting his resignation, or by refusing\r\nhim renomination, would degrade him to the position of the delegate of a\r\nlocal party machine has certainly not been realised; and it is not less\r\ninstructive to observe the purposes for which such influence as they\r\npossess has actually been used. A stranger might have expected that it\r\nwould be employed to promote local interests. But that has not been the\r\ncase. No doubt members of Parliament, like all other popular\r\nrepresentatives, are affected by the special interests of their\r\nconstituents. On matters that touch these they must consider the welfare\r\nof their own locality. A measure like the Agricultural Rates Act of\r\n1896, for example, which by relieving agricultural land from a part of\r\nits burden of rates, and making up the loss to the local authority from\r\nthe National Treasury, changed the incidence of taxation between town\r\nand country, is sure, for local reasons, to detach some members from\r\ntheir regular party allegiance. But with the absence of national grants\r\nfor local improvements, and with the judicial procedure for private bill\r\nlegislation, the occasions, outside of the dockyard towns, where\r\ndistinctly local interests come into play are not numerous. Moreover, in\r\nthose cases the member is affected by the impression his action is\r\nlikely to have upon the bulk of his constituents, or by the solicitation\r\nof a body that represents special interests, rather than by pressure\r\nfrom his local party association. Nor does the latter, at the present\r\nday, commonly try to enforce upon him the particular views held by its\r\nmanagers upon matters of public policy. On the contrary such action as\r\nit takes is, and has been from the beginning, almost wholly confined to\r\nurging him to support the leaders of the party.[500:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reasons for This.]\r\n\r\nThat the local associations act, not on behalf of local interests or\r\nopinions, but for the cohesion of the party as a whole, is the result of\r\nmany causes, and not least among them of the fact that the member is\r\ncommonly not a resident of the place for which he stands. This makes it\r\neasy for him to look upon himself as a representative of the nation at\r\nlarge, rather than a delegate of a borough. It saves him also from\r\nparochial sympathies and prejudices; and above all it relieves him from\r\nthe necessity, he would otherwise be under, of serving an apprenticeship\r\nin the local association, and coming into Parliament a product of the\r\nmachine. Another cause is the strength of national party ties, and the\r\ngreater strictness of party discipline, of which more will be said\r\nhereafter. The local associations have fallen in with this tendency, and\r\nany substantial control they have acquired over their members has been\r\nexerted to make them follow, not local wishes, but the party leaders.\r\nBagehot has remarked somewhere that the House of Commons has been saved\r\nfrom becoming a collection of delegates from local constituencies by the\r\nspirit of deference; but at the present day it is due in even larger\r\nmeasure to the spirit of party. That spirit has prevented the\r\npredominance of local interests which is the curse of many legislative\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[492:1] Ostrogorski, I., 332-33.\r\n\r\n[495:1] Ostrogorski, I., 194-203, 228-30.

The Tories had formed, some years earlier,\r\nthe National Union of Conservative Associations, and their great victory\r\nof 1874, attributed largely to better organisation, had made the time\r\nripe for a more vigorous combination on the Liberal side. Moreover, the\r\nnew associations framed on the Birmingham pattern had already shown the\r\npossibility of concerted action on national questions; for they had held\r\nsimultaneously a large number of indignation meetings to denounce the\r\nBulgarian atrocities. In May, 1877, therefore, they were invited to send\r\ndelegates to a conference at Birmingham to form a national party\r\norganisation. The call for the meeting contained a clear statement of\r\nits purpose. \"The essential feature of the proposed Federation,\" it\r\ndeclared, \"is the principle which must henceforth govern the action of\r\nLiberals as a political party--namely, the direct participation of all\r\nmembers of the party in the direction, and in the selection of those\r\nparticular measures of reform and of progress to which priority shall be\r\ngiven. This object can be secured only by the organisation of the party\r\nupon a representative basis.\"[501:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Proceedings Thereat.]\r\n\r\nThe conference was attended by delegates from ninety-five local\r\nassociations, and Mr. Chamberlain, who had entered Parliament the year\r\nbefore, was called to the chair. In his opening speech he propounded\r\nwith even greater distinctness the object of the plan. \"We hope,\" he\r\nsaid, \"that the time is not distant when we may see a meeting of what\r\nwill be a really Liberal Parliament, outside the Imperial Legislature,\r\nand, unlike it, elected by universal suffrage, and with some regard for\r\na fair distribution of political power.\" After speaking of the need of\r\ntrusting to the popular initiative in framing the immediate policy of\r\nthe party, he continued: \"Our association will be founded on the belief\r\nthat the Liberals in the country are more united than their leaders, and\r\nthat they have attained a pretty clear conception of what are the\r\nchanges in our Constitution which they believe will be beneficial to the\r\ncountry; that we may obtain their adoption by a little gentle pressure\r\nwhich concerted action may enable us to bring to bear, and that in this\r\nway we may exert a great influence on the future policy of the Liberal\r\nparty.\" In the ensuing debates the same point of view was emphasised by\r\nMr. William Harris, the founder of the Liberal \"Four Hundred\" in\r\nBirmingham, who declared that \"The enfranchisement of the great mass of\r\nthe people in towns had given the power of controlling representation\r\ninto the hands of the people, but the direction of the policy of the\r\nparty, the inauguration of measures to be submitted to Parliament, and\r\nthe determination of questions on which the people should be asked to\r\nagitate, had been confined to the people who had managed the Liberal\r\nparty; and it was, no doubt, the dissatisfaction of the Liberals with\r\nthis state of things which led to the inaction of the Liberal party at\r\nthe last election. . . . To find a remedy for this state of things was\r\nthe object they invited the representatives present to consider that\r\nmorning. . . . Why should they not at once and for all form a federation\r\nwhich, by collecting together the opinions of the majority of the people\r\nin all the great centres of political activity, should be able to speak\r\non whatever questions arose with the full authority of the national\r\nvoice.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief business of the conference was the adoption--without\r\namendment--of the constitution which had been prepared beforehand. Mr.\r\nChamberlain was then elected president of the Federation with great\r\nenthusiasm. A number of vice-presidents were taken from other towns; but\r\nthe treasurer and honorary secretary were also citizens of Birmingham,\r\nwhile Mr. Schnadhorst, the great organiser, whose hand had been at work\r\nthroughout the movement, became at once the active secretary. In short,\r\nall the offices of any real importance were retained in the town that\r\nhad given birth to the Federation and was to control its movements for\r\nsome years to come.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Gladstone's Benediction.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aim of the Federation.]\r\n\r\nThe makers of the Federation had taken pains to secure for their plan\r\nthe sanction of Mr. Gladstone, whose name, in spite of his resignation\r\nof the Liberal leadership, carried more weight than that of any one else\r\nin the party. He was present in Birmingham on the day of the conference,\r\nand in the evening addressed a public meeting. After stating that, in\r\npoint of organisation, the Conservatives had for years been ahead, and\r\nwould remain ahead so long as the Liberals adhered like them to a method\r\nof arbitrary selection of the representatives of party, founded mainly\r\nupon the power of the purse, he declared that it was, in his opinion, to\r\nthe honour of Birmingham that she had \"held up the banner of a wider and\r\nof a holier principle\"; and he rejoiced that the large attendance of\r\nrepresentatives of constituencies showed a disposition to adopt this\r\nadmirable principle. Thus he gave the new organisation his blessing and\r\nbade it God-speed.[503:1] The public meeting ended with a resolution\r\nmoved by Mr. Chamberlain, and adopted unanimously, which put into formal\r\nterms the aim of the movement, already so clearly set forth in debate.\r\nIt said that, as the opinion of the people should have a full and direct\r\nexpression in framing and supporting the policy of the Liberal party,\r\nthis meeting heartily approves of the proposal of a Federation of\r\nLiberal Associations. In short, it was made perfectly evident at every\r\nstep in the genesis of the Federation, in the call for a conference, in\r\nthe speeches made thereat, and in the final resolution which closed the\r\nproceedings, that the new organisation was intended to take an\r\nimportant, and perhaps the leading, hand in directing the policy of the\r\nparty. It was expected to be, as Mr. Chamberlain expressed it, a Liberal\r\nparliament outside the imperial legislature; not, indeed, doing the work\r\nof that body, but arranging what work it should do, or rather what work\r\nthe Liberal members should bring before it, and what attitude they\r\nshould assume. By this process the initiative on all the greater issues,\r\nso far as the Liberal party was concerned, would be largely transferred\r\nfrom the Treasury Bench to the Federation. This was, indeed, expressly\r\nstated by some of the speakers as their principal desire, and with such\r\nan avowed object it is not surprising that the new machine for the\r\nmanufacture of Liberal policy should have been popularly called the\r\nCaucus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its Constitution.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Council.]\r\n\r\nThe constitution adopted at the conference provided for a great\r\nrepresentative assembly of the Federation, called the Council, composed\r\nentirely of delegates from the local associations, roughly in proportion\r\nto the population of their towns or districts. If the population was\r\nunder fifty thousand the association was entitled to five\r\nrepresentatives; if between fifty and one hundred thousand to ten; and\r\nif larger still to twenty representatives. The Council was to hold an\r\nannual meeting at which the president, vice-president, treasurer, and\r\nhonorary secretary, were to be elected. Special meetings could also be\r\ncalled by the officers. Each annual meeting was to decide upon the place\r\nat which the next should be held, and in order to awake enthusiasm for\r\nthe party all over the country it has been the habit, from that day to\r\nthis, to hold the annual meeting at one after another of the chief\r\nprovincial towns.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The General Committee.]\r\n\r\nThe constitution set up one other body, partly but not wholly\r\nrepresentative in character. It was called the General Committee, and\r\nconsisted of the officers of the Federation; of delegates from the\r\nassociations, two in number if the town or district had less than fifty\r\nthousand people, three if it had between fifty and one hundred, five if\r\nit had over one hundred thousand; and finally of not more than\r\ntwenty-five additional members chosen by the Committee itself. The\r\nprincipal functions of the Committee were: to aid in the formation of\r\nlocal associations based on popular representation (no others being\r\nadmitted to membership in the Federation); and to submit to the\r\nassociations political questions upon which united action might be\r\nconsidered desirable. Unlike the Council, which was to visit different\r\nplaces, the General Committee was to meet in Birmingham until it decided\r\notherwise. It was empowered to elect its own chairman, and it chose Mr.\r\nWilliam Harris of that town, the father of the first representative\r\nassociation established there in 1868.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Federation Begins Actively.]\r\n\r\nThe Federation does not seem at first to have been universally\r\nattractive, even to the local associations formed after the Birmingham\r\npattern, for it was joined at the outset by only about half as many of\r\nthem as had sent delegates to the conference. But by January, 1879, when\r\nthe first meeting of the Council was held at Leeds, the number had risen\r\nto one hundred and one. In its report at that meeting the General\r\nCommittee showed that it had been very active. It had held no less than\r\nfive sessions, and on the subject of the Eastern question it had stirred\r\nup many public meetings, and had organised a great deputation of local\r\ndelegates to the Liberal leaders in the two Houses of Parliament. The\r\nCommittee believed that its labours had not been fruitless, for the\r\nreport said: \"In regulating the action of the Liberal party, both in\r\nand out of Parliament, in bringing about closer union between leaders\r\nand followers . . . the efforts of the Federation resulted in a great\r\nand important measure of success. . . . But for the Liberal action,\r\nlargely stimulated and guided by the Federated Liberal Associations, we\r\nshould unquestionably have been at war with Russia.\" Mr. Chamberlain in\r\nhis presidential address at the meeting of the Council at Leeds,\r\nspeaking of any possible attempt to avoid a programme of domestic\r\npolicy, when the Liberals again came to power, remarked: \"I think we\r\nshall be justified in saying to Lord Hartington[506:1] that concession\r\nis a virtue that gains by being reciprocal.\" At this time the Radicals\r\nand the Whigs, or Liberals of the older type, still formed mutually\r\ndistrustful wings of the party, and the Federation was the organ of the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nIn its regular session the Council passed no vote on public policy; but,\r\nat the public meeting in the evening, resolutions were adopted against\r\nthe foreign policy of the Conservative government, and in favour of\r\npeace, retrenchment, and reform. At the meeting at Darlington in the\r\nfollowing year a similar course was followed. Clearly the Federation was\r\ntaking very seriously its mission as a spur to the Liberal steed; but\r\nequally clearly it was not as yet seeking to act as a parliament outside\r\nof the imperial legislature, and the centre of gravity was at this time\r\nnot in the Council, but in the General Committee.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Chamberlain Enters the Cabinet.]\r\n\r\nBefore the third meeting of the Council took place in January, 1881, an\r\nevent had occurred that changed essentially the attitude of the\r\nFederation. The general election of 1880 had placed the Liberals in\r\noffice with Mr. Gladstone at their head, and Mr. Chamberlain had been\r\ngiven a seat in the cabinet. It is commonly stated that his connection\r\nwith the Federation was not the cause of his selection, and this is no\r\ndoubt perfectly true in the sense that it was not the direct reason for\r\noffering him the seat. It is, indeed, well known that the choice lay\r\nbetween him and Sir Charles Dilke.[507:1] But as Mr. Chamberlain had sat\r\nless than four years in Parliament, and had never been in the ministry,\r\nit can hardly be denied that his position at the head of the new Liberal\r\norganisation, which had attracted so much attention throughout the\r\ncountry, was one of the factors in the political prominence that brought\r\nhim within reach of the cabinet. His new office necessarily brought a\r\nchange in his relation to the Federation. It was obviously unfitting for\r\nhim to remain the chief officer of a body that might be used to bring\r\npressure to bear upon Parliament and even upon his colleagues. He\r\ntherefore resigned the post of president, and was succeeded by his\r\nfriend and fellow-citizen Mr. Jesse Collings;[507:2] but he continued\r\nuntil the Liberal split in 1886 to make the principal speech at the\r\nevening public meeting held in connection with the annual session of the\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Federation Begins to Act as an Outside Parliament.]\r\n\r\nThe Federation lost none of its momentum from the change of ministry. On\r\nthe contrary its activity increased, and in fact it began at this time\r\nto try its hand at framing a programme for the party in a rudimentary\r\nway. At its meeting in Birmingham in January, 1881, the Council passed,\r\namong other resolutions, one that urged upon the government the need of\r\ndealing at the earliest possible moment with various reforms, such as\r\nthe amendment of the land laws, the extension of the franchise in rural\r\ndistricts, the redistribution of seats, and the creation of\r\nrepresentative institutions in the counties. Similar resolutions were\r\npassed at the next annual meeting, which took place at Liverpool in\r\nOctober of the same year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It Puts Pressure upon Members of Parliament.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the activity of the General Committee about current political\r\nquestions continued; especially in the form of inciting local\r\nassociations to constrain their representatives to vote with the\r\ncabinet. The annual report to the meeting of the Council at Liverpool\r\nsaid that some Liberals had been disposed to propose or support\r\namendments which struck at the vital principle of the Irish Land Bill,\r\nwhile others abstained from voting. The Committee had thereupon decided\r\nthat its \"duty could be most properly and efficiently discharged by\r\ninviting the Liberal constituencies to bring legitimate pressure to bear\r\nupon those of their representatives, who, in a great national crisis,\r\nhad failed to support the government.\" A circular was, therefore, issued\r\nto the federated associations which excited much complaint amongst the\r\nmembers of Parliament, but produced the desired effect.[508:1] When the\r\nbill was threatened with amendments of the House of Lords a meeting of\r\ndelegates was called to attack the peers. This, in the opinion of the\r\nCommittee, also had an effect, and helped to pass the bill.[508:2]\r\n\r\nThe systematic obstruction by Mr. Parnell and his followers in the\r\nCommons, and Mr. Gladstone's plan in 1882 for a new procedure which\r\nwould enable the House to cut off debate, gave a fresh occasion for\r\nbringing the pressure of the federated associations to bear. A circular\r\nwas sent out, and at once a large majority of them passed resolutions in\r\nsupport of the government's plan.[508:3] The General Committee held\r\nmeetings also in connection with the Irish Coercion Act of that year,\r\nand sustained the cabinet heartily, while at the same time suggesting\r\namendments. Some of these were adopted, and as the Committee\r\ncomplacently remarked, \"The Federation may thus claim the credit of\r\nhaving on the one hand strengthened and guided public opinion in support\r\nof measures deemed necessary for the maintenance of order; and on the\r\nother of having sought to mitigate the severity of the proposed\r\nenactments.\"[509:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It calls a General Conference of the Party.]\r\n\r\nIn 1883 the Federation took up energetically the extension of the\r\nfranchise in the counties. It called a great conference of delegates at\r\nLeeds; acting on this occasion in cooperation with the National Reform\r\nUnion of Manchester and the London and Counties Liberal Union, two rival\r\norganisations, which were, however, more local and less aggressive, and\r\nwaned slowly before the greater vigour of the Federation.[509:2] The\r\ndelegates met two thousand strong, representing more than five hundred\r\nassociations, and adopted resolutions declaring that it was the duty of\r\nthe government at the next session of Parliament to introduce bills to\r\nextend the county franchise and redistribute seats. Another conference\r\nin Scotland passed similar votes. \"Taken together,\" the General\r\nCommittee say in their annual report, \"they represent the great bulk of\r\nthe Liberal party throughout Great Britain . . . and . . . it is not too\r\nmuch to expect that such an expression of opinion will exercise decisive\r\nweight with the Members of the Government in the arrangement of their\r\nmeasures.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its Claims at This Time.]\r\n\r\nThese examples show the attitude and the activity of the Federation\r\nduring the first Liberal ministry that held office after its formation.\r\nIt claimed to represent, or perhaps one ought to say it claimed that it\r\nwould when fully developed represent and that it could immediately\r\nevoke, the opinion of the whole Liberal party in the country. It was,\r\ntherefore, convinced that it ought to exert a great influence upon the\r\ncabinet in the framing of measures; and it believed that it did so.\r\nThere is no need of reviewing further the history of the Federation\r\nduring this period, for its position remained unchanged until Mr.\r\nGladstone brought in his Home Rule Bill in 1886. But on two points the\r\naction of the Council is noteworthy in connection with its subsequent\r\ncareer. The resolutions passed at the annual meetings began to cover a\r\nwider field. This was especially true after the downfall of the Liberal\r\ngovernment, in 1885, when they assumed the proportions of a full\r\nprogramme of internal reforms.[510:1] Then again amendments to the\r\nresolutions offered were moved from the floor. In 1883, for example, an\r\namendment in favour of woman suffrage was carried; and in 1885 another\r\ndemanding local option in regulating the sale of liquor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Struggle over Home Rule.]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's ministry having resigned in consequence of a defeat on\r\nthe budget, the Conservatives came to power in June, 1885, and the\r\ngeneral election at the end of the year, with the political upheavals to\r\nwhich it gave rise, proved a turning-point in the history of the Caucus.\r\nThe election left both parties without a working majority; for the\r\nConservatives and Home Rulers together almost exactly balanced the\r\nLiberals. In January the Conservatives were beaten on the address with\r\nthe help of Irish votes, and Mr. Gladstone, returning to office,\r\nprepared a bill for a separate Parliament in Ireland. Some members of\r\nthe moderate wing of the party had already left him during the debate on\r\nthe address; and in March, while the Home Rule Bill and its complement,\r\nthe Irish Land Bill, were under discussion in the cabinet, several of\r\nthe ministers, including Mr. Chamberlain, resigned, one of their chief\r\nstumbling blocks being the exclusion of Irish representatives from the\r\nHouse of Commons. A struggle began at once for the control of the\r\nNational Liberal Federation. On one side stood Mr. Gladstone with his\r\ncabinet, the official leaders of the party; on the other Mr.\r\nChamberlain, hitherto the hero and idol of the Caucus, which he had\r\nnurtured and made great, which had treated him as its special\r\nrepresentative in the cabinet, and had passed each year a vote to\r\nwelcome him when he came to make his speech. He had declared in\r\nParliament not long before that he was not the Caucus,[511:1] but it\r\ncertainly expressed his views, and he fought its battles. During the\r\nlate election he had made the country ring with appeals for the reforms\r\nadvocated in its programme, especially the demand for labourers'\r\nallotments, embodied in the cry for \"three acres and a cow.\" The Caucus\r\nwas the weapon of the Radical wing of the party, while he was the\r\ngreatest Radical champion, and although Kitson, the president of the\r\nFederation, was against him, the majority of the officers were on his\r\nside, among them William Harris, the founder of popular party\r\norganisation in Birmingham and still the chairman of the General\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Chamberlain is Defeated in the Council;]\r\n\r\nOn April 6, two days before Mr. Gladstone brought in the Home Rule Bill,\r\nthe officers sent a circular to the federated associations asking them\r\nto consider the proposals of the government, as soon as they were made\r\nknown, with a view to an expression of opinion by the Liberal party. A\r\nspecial meeting of the Council was then summoned to meet in London on\r\nMay 15. There Mr. Harris moved a resolution drawn up by the officers,\r\nand expressing Mr. Chamberlain's ideas. It approved of giving the people\r\nof Ireland a large control over their own affairs by means of a\r\nlegislative assembly; but, while declaring the confidence of the Council\r\nin Mr. Gladstone, requested him to amend his bill by retaining the Irish\r\nrepresentatives at Westminster. The resolution was met by an amendment\r\nmoved by the followers of the Prime Minister, commending the Home Rule\r\nBill, thanking him for it, and assuring him of support in the present\r\ncrisis. After a long and eager discussion the amendment was carried by\r\nan overwhelming majority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and Withdraws from the Federation.]\r\n\r\nThe result, so far as the Federation was concerned, was decisive. Six\r\nmembers of the General Committee, including Mr. Harris,[511:2] thereupon\r\nresigned; and several influential public men, among them Mr.\r\nChamberlain, withdrew from the organisation. But the mass of the people\r\nthink on broad lines, delight in strong contrasts easily understood, and\r\nhave little sympathy with a half-way group that stands between the two\r\nopposing parties in the state. Hence like the Peelites in 1846, and the\r\nFree Trade Conservatives in 1905, the Liberal Unionists in 1886 were a\r\nbody in which the members of Parliament were many and their following in\r\nthe country comparatively few. The personal secessions from the\r\nFederation were not numerous, and not a single local association left\r\nthe fold.[512:1] But the break soon became incurable. The opponents of\r\nthe Home Rule Bill ceased to be regarded by their former companions in\r\narms as members of the party, and were constrained to leave the Liberal\r\nassociations;[512:2] while Mr. Chamberlain in conjunction not only with\r\nhis Radical friends, but with all the Liberals who could not follow Mr.\r\nGladstone's Irish policy, including even Lord Hartington and the Whigs,\r\nfounded a new organisation upon the old model, called the Liberal\r\nUnionist Association.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New Position of the Federation.]\r\n\r\nThe National Liberal Federation did not save Mr. Gladstone and his\r\nadherents from defeat at the general election of 1886; but they had\r\nobtained control of the organisation, and must find out what to do with\r\nit. If a power, it had also been a source of anxiety, and under the\r\nwrong management it might again be used to put pressure on the members\r\nof Parliament, and even on the leaders themselves. It was useful and\r\nmust be cajoled; but it was also dangerous and must be kept in check.\r\nLike a colt, it must be treated kindly, but must be broken to harness,\r\nand above all the reins must not be allowed to get into strange hands\r\nlest it learn bad tricks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Removal to London.]\r\n\r\nObviously the offices of the Federation could remain no longer at\r\nBirmingham, because in spite of the loss of his organisation Mr.\r\nChamberlain still controlled the city so completely that his candidates\r\ncarried every seat there at the election of 1886. The offices were,\r\ntherefore, moved to London, where they were established in the same\r\nbuilding with the Liberal Central Association--the body that acts in\r\nconjunction with the party whips--and what is more, M. Schnadhorst, the\r\npaid secretary of the Federation, who had taken Mr. Gladstone's side at\r\nthe time of the split, was also appointed honorary secretary of the\r\nAssociation. This arrangement, which lasted until he retired in 1894,\r\nand has continued ever since under his successor Mr. Hudson, was not\r\nmentioned at the time in the printed reports of the General Committee,\r\nbut its effects in bringing the leaders of the party into close touch\r\nwith the management of the Federation can readily be imagined. Another\r\nlink of the same kind was soon made. The General Committee had always\r\nbeen in the habit of distributing political literature, and in 1887 a\r\npublication department was created under the direction of a joint\r\ncommittee consisting of two representatives of the Central Association,\r\nand two of the Federation.[513:1] All these changes brought the\r\nFederation nearer to the party chiefs, and gave it also a more national\r\nstamp.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Federation Broadened.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time the constitution was slightly modified. The principal\r\nchanges adopted in 1887 were: making the representation on the Council\r\nmore nearly proportional to population; giving to each association for a\r\nwhole constituency three votes in the General Committee, and to all\r\nothers one vote apiece without regard to size; and lastly providing for\r\ndistrict federations, especially for Wales, the Home Counties and\r\nLondon, which should be represented as separate organisations upon the\r\ngoverning bodies. The object of these changes appears to have been to\r\nmake the Federation attractive to all Liberals throughout the country,\r\nfor it had hitherto been regarded as preeminently an instrument of the\r\nRadical wing of the party, and many local associations had held aloof.\r\nThe managers now tried to induce them to join in order to make the\r\nFederation as fully representative of the whole party as possible. In\r\nthis they were successful in a high degree, as may be seen from the fact\r\nthat the federated associations, which numbered in 1886, before the\r\nsplit over Home Rule, only two hundred and fifty-five, rose in two years\r\nto seven hundred and sixteen.[514:1] In carrying out this object there\r\nwas no need of opening the door to local associations not framed upon a\r\npopular and representative basis, because societies of that kind had\r\nalready been entirely superseded.[514:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation to the Party Leaders.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Federation, breaking away from Mr. Chamberlain, chose the side\r\nof Mr. Gladstone, the leaders of the party took it at once under their\r\npatronage, and began to show a keen interest in its proceedings. Not\r\nonly did Mr. Gladstone address almost every year a great public meeting\r\nheld in the evening during the session of the Council, as Mr.\r\nChamberlain had been in the habit of doing before 1886; but other\r\nleaders of the party attended the meetings of the Council itself, and\r\nformer cabinet ministers made speeches there in moving, seconding or\r\nsupporting the resolutions. This practice magnified the apparent\r\nimportance of the Federation, and lasted until the Liberals came into\r\noffice again in 1892.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resolution of the Council]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Nottingham Programme.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Council, meeting as before in one after another of the\r\ngreat provincial towns, continued to adopt a series of resolutions\r\nsetting forth the policy of the Liberal party. The embarrassment that\r\nmight come from this in the future was not fully perceived at the time,\r\nand there was at first no attempt to discourage it. In fact a statement\r\nof the objects of the Federation published with the new rules in 1887\r\nrepeated the words originally written ten years earlier: \"the essential\r\nfeature of the Federation is the participation of all members of the\r\nparty in the formation and direction of its policy, and in the selection\r\nof those particular measures of reform and progress to which priority\r\nshall be given.\"[514:3] The resolutions became, in fact, more and more\r\ncomprehensive, because the Council was naturally in the habit each year\r\nof reaffirming its previous votes about internal reforms, and adding new\r\nones, the older expressions of opinion being after a while condensed\r\ninto what was known as the \"omnibus resolution.\" At the meeting held at\r\nNottingham in 1887 a series of resolutions were adopted condemning\r\ncoercion, urging Home Rule, the principle of one man one vote,\r\nregistration reform, disestablishment of the Church in Wales, and the\r\nneed of reform in the land laws, in labourers' allotments, county\r\ngovernment, local option, London municipal government, and free\r\neducation. The resolutions were talked about as a programme for the\r\nparty, and the managers began to see that a danger was involved, but\r\napparently as yet only the danger of splitting the party. The General\r\nCommittee, therefore, in its next annual report, after speaking of the\r\ninfluence exerted by the Federation, remarked: \"A force so great and so\r\noverwhelming requires to be directed with the utmost care and judgment,\r\nand your Committee asks for the support of the Federated Associations in\r\napplying it only to questions of a practical character, with regard to\r\nwhich there is a general consensus of opinion in the party. . . . Much\r\nhas been said and written of the Nottingham programme. Neither the\r\nresolutions submitted at Nottingham, nor the resolutions which are\r\nsubmitted at the present meetings of the Council, are intended to\r\nconstitute a political programme. The resolutions which were submitted\r\nlast year, and those which will be submitted this year, refer to\r\nsubjects upon which there is a general consensus of opinion in the\r\nLiberal ranks. Every question added which is not thus approved tends to\r\ndivide and to weaken the party.\"[515:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amendments Ruled Out of Order.]\r\n\r\nThe principle that resolutions on which there was not a general\r\nconsensus of opinion ought not to be adopted by the Council was given a\r\nvery definite application at that meeting. A motion stood upon the\r\nagenda in favour of one man one vote, and the payment out of the public\r\nrates of returning officers' expenses. The president, Sir James Kitson,\r\nstated that a delegate wished to add the question of the payment of\r\nmembers, but he must rule that it should be sent up by one of the\r\nfederated associations with a request for inclusion in next year's\r\nprogramme. As the agenda was prepared by the General Committee, the\r\naction of the president was in effect a ruling that a question not\r\nplaced by that committee upon the paper could not be proposed from the\r\nfloor. A little later in the meeting he took the same position when a\r\nmember wanted to bring forward the grievances of the Scotch\r\ncrofters.[516:1]\r\n\r\nThe ruling was a complete innovation, for amendments of a similar\r\ncharacter had not only been adopted by the Council in former years, in\r\n1883 and 1885, for example; but in the great struggle for the control of\r\nthe Federation in 1886, the defeat of Mr. Chamberlain had been brought\r\nabout by an amendment in favour of the Home Rule Bill, which was carried\r\nin the Council by a large majority. The conditions, however, had\r\nchanged. A freedom of making motions that was harmless when the\r\nFederation contained only one extreme wing of the Liberals, became a\r\nvery different thing when it comprised all the elements in their ranks,\r\nand the ruling was now essential if motions were not to be made that\r\nmight divide or weaken the party. It was repeated the next year when a\r\ndelegate sought to add to the omnibus resolution a rider on the question\r\nof the eight-hour day;[516:2] and it was confirmed by the new president,\r\nDr. Spence Watson, in 1891.[516:3] In fact, Dr. Watson in his opening\r\naddress at the meeting explained that in his opinion the exclusion of\r\nany alteration or amendment of the resolutions submitted to the Council\r\narose from the very nature of the case;[516:4] and thereafter the rule\r\nwas firmly established in the proceedings of the body.\r\n\r\nThree matters, however, deserve a brief notice in this connection.\r\nFirst, the rule has never been applied to the General Committee. At its\r\nmeetings amendments may be freely moved and carried; but then the\r\nGeneral Committee has power merely to discuss public questions, not to\r\nexpress definitely the opinion of the party.[517:1] Second, the rule in\r\nthe Council would seem to apply only to amendments that may provoke a\r\ndifference of opinion. At the meeting of 1889, for example, immediately\r\nafter the eight-hour day amendment had been ruled out of order, another\r\ndeclaring \"that Welsh disestablishment and disendowment should be dealt\r\nwith as soon as Irish Home Rule is attained,\" was adopted, without\r\nobjection from the president, with the unanimous approval of the\r\nmeeting.[517:2] Third, the rule in the Council applies only to\r\nresolutions affecting the Liberal programme. It has not been applied to\r\nsuch a matter as a revision of the rules of the Federation, and in 1896\r\nand 1897 several motions to amend proposals relating to the rules were\r\nmade, and one of them, which occasioned a count of votes, was carried by\r\na narrow majority.[517:3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resolutions and Speakers Cut and Dried.]\r\n\r\nWith no questions submitted, save those on which there was believed to\r\nbe a general consensus of opinion in the Liberal ranks, and no\r\namendments allowed, serious dissent about the adoption of the\r\nresolutions never occurred. Nor was there much real discussion. In\r\naccordance with a common English custom an agenda paper was distributed\r\nbefore the meeting, which contained not only a list of the resolutions\r\nto be brought forward, but also the names of the proposer, the seconder,\r\nand sometimes a third or fourth man who would support each of them. Now\r\nthese persons were expected to make speeches long enough to fill\r\ntogether nearly the whole of the sitting; and hence the other delegates,\r\nalthough at liberty to take part, did not often feel inclined to make,\r\nupon an unopposed resolution, remarks that in the presence of one or two\r\nthousand people must be in the nature of an harangue. As a rule,\r\ntherefore, the proceedings followed closely the agenda; a resolution was\r\nproposed, seconded, and supported as had been arranged, and was then\r\ncarried unanimously.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions the duty of preparing the resolutions for the\r\nCouncil, by drawing up the agenda, was of prime importance. If the\r\nFederation was no longer used, as in the days when it was guided from\r\nBirmingham, to press forward a policy upon which all Liberals were not\r\nagreed, it might now be supposed to speak with a more authoritative\r\nvoice on behalf of the whole party; and while its votes were passed by\r\ncommon consent, the right to select the questions which should be\r\npresented for general acceptance conferred no small power. Nominally\r\nthis function was intrusted to the General Committee, but that body,\r\nwhich was far too large for such a task, had been in the habit of\r\ndelegating the preliminary work to a few of its own members under the\r\ntitle of the General Purposes Committee,[518:1] and in 1890 amendments\r\nto the rules of the Federation were proposed chiefly in order to confer\r\nthe power definitely upon the smaller body. They provided that the\r\nGeneral Purposes Committee should consist of the officers of the\r\nFederation, and of not more than twenty other members elected by the\r\nGeneral Committee; that it should prepare the business for meetings of\r\nthe Council, and generally carry on the affairs of the Federation.\r\nAlthough the change involved a concentration of power it was adopted at\r\nthe time without opposition,[518:2] but was the cause of heart-burning\r\nat a later date.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Process of Preparing Resolutions.]\r\n\r\nIn his opening speech the next year the President explained the\r\nfunctions of the Council. \"From the earliest time,\" he said, \"it has\r\nbeen the practice and the rule of these meetings to make certain\r\ndeclarations. Some of us think those declarations are a little too\r\nnumerous already. Some of us are afraid that the declarations partake\r\nsomewhat of the character of a programme. Some of us look back to the\r\ngood old time when we took up one burning question and fought it, and\r\nfought it until we carried it into law. In the first place this is a\r\nbusiness meeting for the purpose of receiving the report. In the second\r\nplace it has come to be a meeting for making certain declarations. It is\r\nnot--and I wish to be particularly clear upon this point--for the\r\ndiscussion of subjects. But you will say 'The National Liberal\r\nFederation not to discuss subjects!' Certainly it can, and certainly it\r\ndoes. It does not discuss them at the annual meeting. It does discuss\r\nthem at the General Committee meetings, and at the conferences held from\r\ntime to time.[519:1] Great dissatisfaction is found with the fact that\r\nthere are rules affecting the Federation. No federation, no society of\r\nany kind, could ever exist without rules. There must be absolute rules\r\nof procedure, and one of the rules of the proceedings of these meetings\r\nhas been that beforehand the General Purposes Committee sends out to\r\nevery association which is federated--between 800 and 900--to ascertain\r\nwhat the wishes of that association may be. From the replies it\r\nreceives, from prior resolutions, from the business which has been\r\ntransacted at the General Committee meetings of the Federation and at\r\nthe conferences, the General Purposes Committee prepares the resolutions\r\nwhich are submitted, and those resolutions are either accepted or\r\nrejected. They are not altered or amended. That arises from the very\r\nnature of the case. . . . It is absolutely impossible to discuss\r\nquestions in which great numbers of men take a great interest and hold\r\ndifferent views in a gathering of this character. The first discussion\r\nmust take place in the individual associations. The individual\r\nassociations must send up their delegates to our General Committee\r\nmeetings and conferences, and the matter must be threshed out there, and\r\nthere must be clear evidence as to the question having received general\r\nacceptance before it comes to a meeting of this kind.\" Then, after\r\nreferring to the question of an eight-hour day, about which the\r\nassociations showed a wide difference of opinion, he added: \"Do you\r\nthink we wish to stifle discussion? Why, discussion is the very\r\nlife-blood of Liberalism. We long for discussion of all questions. We\r\nwish to have further discussion of this question, a discussion searching\r\nout to the very bottom of the matter. We don't want a hap-hazard\r\ndiscussion in a great meeting where it is absolutely impossible that men\r\ncan give their real opinions, can argue the question out, and go down to\r\nthe roots of the matter.\"[520:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contrast with the Original Plan.]\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to express more forcibly the change that had come\r\nover the Federation, in the functions, and still more in the aims, of\r\nthe Council meetings. According to the original plan the Federation was\r\nto be a true Liberal parliament outside the imperial legislature; and it\r\nwas a far cry from that conception to a body voting, without amendment\r\nor real debate, ratifications of measures prearranged by a small\r\ncommittee, and found by previous inquiry to express the universal\r\nsentiment of the party. If the Federation, with its General Purposes\r\nCommittee, its General Committee and its Council, still remained a\r\nshadow of a Liberal parliament, it was one somewhat after the model of\r\nNapoleon's legislature with its Council of State, its Tribunate, and its\r\nLegislative Assembly, where one body prepared the laws, another debated,\r\nand a third voted them.[520:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Newcastle Programme.]\r\n\r\nAs the General Purposes Committee placed upon the agenda for the Council\r\nonly resolutions on which the party was believed to be united, it is not\r\nstrange that they were invariably carried, and almost always with\r\nsubstantial unanimity. The surprising thing is the number of questions\r\non which the whole body of Liberals appeared to agree; but it must be\r\nremembered that the party was in Opposition, so that neither the\r\nleaders, nor any one else, could make any effort at present to put into\r\neffect the resolutions that had been voted. They expressed merely\r\naspirations, and the impulse of every one was to assent to any proposal\r\nfor a reform to which he had no fixed objection. This was the more true\r\nbecause all assemblies of that kind are attended most largely by the\r\nardent or advanced members of the organisation, the more moderate\r\nelements caring far less to be present. The resolutions, therefore,\r\nincreased until they reached high-water mark at the very meeting of\r\n1891,[521:1] where Dr. Spence Watson in his opening address said he\r\nthought them too numerous already. From the town where the Council met\r\nthat year the resolutions became known as the \"Newcastle Programme.\" At\r\nthe evening meeting Mr. Gladstone took up, one after another, most of\r\nthe subjects included therein, and dwelt upon the importance of each of\r\nthem; but before doing so he remarked that when the Liberals came to\r\npower they would want the additional virtue of patience, because with\r\nthe surfeit of work to be done it would be difficult to choose proper\r\nsubjects of immediate attention.[521:2]\r\n\r\nThe virtue of patience was needed very soon. The Council had met at\r\nNewcastle in October, 1891. Owing to a change in the date of meeting, it\r\nwas not called together again until January, 1893; and in the meanwhile\r\na Liberal ministry had come into office. The Council took up no new\r\nquestions, and passed a single modest resolution relating to the party\r\npolicy, saying \"That this Council confirms the series of Resolutions\r\nknown as 'the Newcastle Programme,' and confidently expects that Mr.\r\nGladstone's government will promptly introduce into the House of Commons\r\nBills embodying Reforms which have been declared again and again by\r\nthis Council to be essential to the welfare of the people of the United\r\nKingdom.\"[522:1] As the reforms contained in the Newcastle Programme\r\ncould hardly have been embodied in statutes in less than ten years by a\r\ncabinet with a large and homogeneous majority, the demand that bills\r\nupon all those subjects should be promptly introduced by a ministry with\r\na very narrow majority, and depending for its life upon the support of\r\nIrish votes, showed the need of patience rather than its presence. In\r\nfact most of the speakers at the meeting emphasised the reforms in which\r\nthey were especially interested, and the rest urged the importance of\r\nthe whole array.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its Effects.]\r\n\r\nThe wealth of the programme speedily caused embarrassment to the leaders\r\nof the party. Home Rule, as every one admitted, was entitled to the\r\nfirst place; but after that had been put on the shelf by the House of\r\nLords difficulties arose, for the Liberals in the House of Commons were\r\nnot all of one mind. Some of them were more interested in one reform,\r\nsome in another, and each had an equal right to feel that his subject\r\nhad been accepted as an essential part of the Liberal policy deserving\r\nimmediate attention. People said that the traditional division into\r\nparties was passing away, that the parties were falling apart into\r\ngroups, like those in continental legislatures. The assertion was\r\nfrequently repeated, although it was disproved by the constancy with\r\nwhich the ministers were supported by their followers in a House of\r\nCommons where the defection of a dozen members at any moment would have\r\nturned the scale. Month after month the whips came regularly to the\r\ntable with their slight margin of Liberal votes. In fact the government\r\ndefeats on minor matters were less frequent than in Mr. Gladstone's\r\nprevious administration; and no defeat on a question of political\r\nimportance occurred until June, 1895, when it was accomplished by the\r\ntrick of bringing Conservatives secretly into the House through the\r\nterrace. After that defeat the ministers resigned, not because their\r\nfollowers had ceased to vote with them, but because they were weary of\r\na hopeless struggle. Nevertheless the Newcastle Programme with its\r\nmagnificent promises had been a source of weakness to them. It\r\nrestrained their freedom of action, and forced their hands. In short, it\r\nhampered their initiative in party policy, and it caused disappointment\r\namong their followers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Rosebery's Criticism.]\r\n\r\nLord Rosebery, who had succeeded Mr. Gladstone as Prime Minister in\r\n1894, felt the bad effects of the Newcastle Programme. At the public\r\nmeeting, held when the Council met in January, 1895, he spoke of the\r\nfunction of the Federation in threshing out the issues lying before the\r\nparty, and that of the cabinet in winnowing them, selecting from a vast\r\nfield the bills to be brought forward in the session. \"Now, this\r\nprogramme,\" he went on, \"as it stands now, without any addition, would\r\nrequire many energetic years in which a strong Government, supported by\r\na united and powerful Liberal Party, would have to do their best to\r\ncarry into effect (_sic_). But what is sometimes forgotten is this--that\r\nwe cannot pass all the measures of this programme simultaneously. . . .\r\nWhilst this process of winnowing is going on, all Cabinet Ministers are\r\nsubject to a bombardment of correspondence . . . by appeals, some of\r\nthem menacing, some of them coaxing and cajoling, but all of them\r\nextremely earnest, and praying that the particular hobby of the writer\r\nshall be made the first Government Bill. . . . Any delay in pushing\r\nforward each measure that has been recorded in what is called the\r\nNewcastle programme implies, we are told, the alienation of all the\r\nearnest and thoughtful members of the Liberal Party--in fact, the\r\nbackbone of the Liberal Party. And I have come to the conclusion that\r\nthe Liberal Party is extremely rich in backbones.\"[523:1]\r\n\r\nAt the public meeting in the following year, after the fall of his\r\ngovernment, he spoke even more plainly. He said there had been complaint\r\nthat officialdom had crept into the National Liberal Federation. His own\r\nexperience was that it played a very subordinate part there, and if he\r\nhad a secret hope on the subject, it was that officialdom might have a\r\nlittle more to do with the organisation. \"I remember two occasions on\r\nwhich the National Liberal Federation took the bit between its teeth\r\nand, certainly uninspired by officialdom, took very remarkable action.\r\nThe first occasion was when it made at Newcastle a programme, a very\r\ncelebrated expression of faith which, I confess, was in my opinion too\r\nlong for practical purposes.\"[524:1] Later in alluding to the fall of\r\nhis ministry he asked: \"Why did it fall? It fell because, with a\r\nchivalrous sense of honour too rare in politics, and with inadequate\r\nmeans, it determined to fulfil all the pledges that it had given in\r\nOpposition. It had, I think, given too many pledges--partly owing to\r\nyou, Dr. Spence Watson. It had, I think, assumed too many\r\nresponsibilities, it had taken a burden too heavy for its back, or the\r\nback of any Government or any Parliament, to bear.\"[524:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Programme Cut Down after 1894.]\r\n\r\nThe lesson of the Newcastle Programme had not been in vain. Already in\r\n1895 the \"omnibus resolution,\" which, by way of comprehensive reform,\r\nthreatened the interests of the landlord, the manufacturer, the mine\r\nowner, the Church, and the House of Lords, had been omitted, although\r\nmost of the matters covered by it were made the subject of special\r\nvotes. The next year the programme was left out altogether. Apart from\r\nresolutions criticising the Conservative government for its foreign\r\npolicy in Armenia and Egypt, and stating on what terms an education bill\r\nought to be based, the only vote dealing with the policy of the Liberal\r\nparty declared simply, \"That this Council reaffirms its adherence to the\r\nprinciples for which the Federation has always contended,\" a confession\r\nof faith not likely to cause acute discomfort to a future cabinet. As\r\nthe years went by the pressure for specific reforms was too strong to be\r\nresisted, and resolutions dealing with them were adopted; but they have\r\nnever again reached anything resembling the range, the well-nigh\r\nrevolutionary proportions, or the suicidal capacity, of the Newcastle\r\nProgramme.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Complaints that the Whips Control the Federation.]\r\n\r\nA political, like a military, defeat is apt to cause mutual\r\nrecriminations. If Lord Rosebery lamented that the leaders in Parliament\r\nhad been overburdened by the programme of the Federation, there were\r\nRadicals aggrieved by the control which, in their opinion, the leaders,\r\nacting through the whips and the Liberal Central Association, had\r\nacquired over the Federation. The complaints were so loud, and so much\r\ndiscussed in the press, that Dr. Spence Watson felt constrained to deal\r\nwith them in his presidential address. The charge was that by having the\r\nsame quarters, and the same secretary (Mr. Hudson) the Federation had\r\nbeen fused with and merged into the Central Association. This, he\r\ninsisted, was absolutely incorrect, the two organisations having duties\r\nwhich lay quite apart one from the other; and he defended the existing\r\nconnection between them as a good business arrangement, which had\r\nresulted in much better work.[525:1] The charge in another form was that\r\nthe General Purposes Committee, in preparing the resolutions for the\r\nCouncil, was swayed by the whips by means of Mr. Hudson. Of this he\r\nsaid: \"We are told that the resolutions are not genuine; that they are\r\nforced upon us by the Whips through the secretary, Mr. Hudson. No man\r\nadmires the work of Mr. Hudson more than I do, because no man sees more\r\nof his work. I think Mr. Hudson, if he were so disposed, which I imagine\r\nis very far from his disposition, would find it very difficult to impose\r\nthe will of the Whips upon us. We are not exactly the men to be dealt\r\nwith in that way. Now, gentlemen, I wish to put this quite plainly.\r\nThere is not a grain of truth in it. I have written down these words\r\nbecause I wish to be precise. I assert that not a single resolution has\r\never, at all events since 1886, been suggested, hinted at, drawn,\r\naltered, or manipulated by any Whip or leader whatsoever.\"[525:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Power Concentrated in an Executive Committee in 1896.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the statement was no doubt true, and would perhaps continue to\r\nbe true, the efficiency of the party might well depend upon having the\r\nresolutions of the Council prepared by a small body of men of proved\r\ndiscretion, who would insert nothing embarrassing to the leaders. In\r\nview of the experience with the Newcastle Programme it might be wise to\r\ntake even greater care in the selection of men who could understand the\r\nsituation of the front bench, and to increase their powers. At a meeting\r\nof the General Committee, at Leeds, in December, 1895, a vote was passed\r\ninstructing the General Purposes Committee \"to consider whether the\r\nmachinery of the Federation can be made more representative and\r\ndemocratic.\" Democracy is a principle in whose name strange things are\r\ndone; and in accordance with this vote a plan was reported for a\r\nrevision of the rules, in which the principal changes proposed would\r\nstrengthen the hands of the General Purposes Committee, renamed the\r\nExecutive Committee. That body was directed to invite expressions of\r\nopinion from the federated associations about the subjects to be brought\r\nbefore the Council; was confirmed in its power to frame the resolutions\r\nto be submitted;[526:1] and was given authority to decide any questions\r\nof procedure that might arise during the sessions of the Council.[526:2]\r\nIn order, as the General Committee said in their report, to \"afford an\r\nopportunity for the ventilation of views upon subjects not dealt with in\r\nthe resolutions,\" it was provided that upon the motion to adopt the\r\nannual report \"the Council shall be open for the free discussion of any\r\nmatter affecting the policy and principles of the Liberal party.\" A mere\r\nchance to talk supplies a useful safety valve, without doing harm; and\r\nin this case the talk could not be followed by an expression of opinion\r\non the part of the Council, for no vote would be in order save to\r\naccept, or reject, or refer back, the annual report.[526:3] The\r\ndiscussion would be like that in the House of Commons on the motion to\r\nadjourn over Easter.\r\n\r\nHitherto the action of the General Committee had been entirely free, but\r\nthe revised rules intrusted the Executive Committee with the duty of\r\npreparing the business for that body as well as for the Council; not,\r\nindeed, in the same absolute way, for any federated association could\r\npropose an amendment or further resolution, provided they gave notice\r\nthereof to the secretary five days, at least, before the meeting.\r\nMoreover the Executive Committee was given power to nominate its own\r\nmembers. Every association had also a right to make nominations, but\r\nthese were not, like those of the Executive Committee, circulated among\r\nthe local associations before the meeting.[527:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Members of Parliament Excluded Therefrom.]\r\n\r\nFinally, members of Parliament were declared ineligible to the Executive\r\nCommittee. To a question why they were excluded, the chairman of the\r\nGeneral Committee \"replied that it had always been considered desirable\r\nthat when a man became a Member of Parliament he should retire from the\r\nExecutive, and that they should be free from all thought of outside\r\ninfluence.\"[527:2] The answer does not make it perfectly clear whether\r\nthe object of the provision was to free the members of Parliament from\r\nthe influence of the Committee, or the Committee from the influence of\r\nthe members. Both results were in fact attained. The members of the\r\nHouse were left to the sole tutelage of the whips, so far as the\r\nFederation was concerned, for since 1886 it had ceased altogether from\r\nthe practice of stirring up local associations to bring pressure to\r\nbear upon their representatives;[528:1] and, on the other hand, the new\r\nrule removed any opportunity for a member of Parliament to use, or\r\nappear to use, the Committee for his own political advancement.[528:2]\r\nLord Randolph Churchill's doings in the National Union of Conservative\r\nAssociations--to be related in the next chapter--was still fresh in\r\nmen's minds. It is, indeed, a striking fact that from the time when the\r\nLiberals came to power in 1892 the leaders ceased for some years to\r\nattend even the sittings of the Council, which were left wholly to the\r\nlesser lights.[528:3] One of the chiefs spoke at a public evening\r\nmeeting; but they all stayed away from the Council itself where business\r\nwas transacted, thus depriving it of the weight that came from having\r\nits words sanctioned by the presence of the real leaders of the party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opposition to the Changes.]\r\n\r\nDuring the debate on the new rules in the Council,[528:4] a number of\r\namendments were moved, which aimed at preventing the concentration of\r\npower in the hands of the General and Executive Committees. Of this\r\nnature were motions that the Executive Committee should be chosen by the\r\nCouncil; that amendments to the agenda and further resolutions might be\r\nproposed at Council meetings; that the agenda should be prepared by the\r\nGeneral, instead of the Executive, Committee; and that the Executive\r\nCommittee should not have power to nominate its own members. As these\r\namendments struck at the very root of the revision, none of them were\r\ncarried, and in fact the new rules were adopted without substantial\r\nalteration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Renewed Discussion in 1897 and 1898.]\r\n\r\nAt the meeting in the following year, 1897, the same questions were\r\nraised again. Changes in the rules were proposed, similar in character\r\nto the amendments rejected in 1896, and brought forward with the same\r\nobject. They were urged on the ground that the control ought to be taken\r\nfrom the hands of the few and placed in the hands of the many, that at\r\npresent \"the whole thing was wire-pulled from the top,\" that the Liberal\r\nparty had got out of touch with the Labour party, and that the\r\nassociations had not so much opportunity as they ought to have to bring\r\nmatters before the Council. In the end the proposals were shelved by\r\nbeing referred to the Executive Committee.[529:1] The next report of the\r\nGeneral Committee treated the matter with great frankness: \"The Annual\r\nCouncil Meeting,\" we read, \"must either be (_a_) an open conference for\r\nthe debate of multitudinous questions about which the party has come to\r\nno agreement, or (_b_) an Assembly of a declaratory character to\r\nemphasise matters upon which the party are agreed. The former function\r\nis impossible, if merely because the Council may consist of more than a\r\nthousand persons sitting for less than a dozen hours. . . . It is\r\ninevitable (and there is no reason why it should not be frankly\r\nrecognised) that the business of the Council Meeting should be more or\r\nless 'cut and dried' beforehand. . . . These resolutions are intended to\r\ninform the party leaders of the subjects in dealing with which they may\r\nrely upon the support of the party as a whole. The Federation does not\r\ninterfere with the time or order in which questions should be taken up.\r\nThat is the province of the leaders of the party.\"[529:2]\r\n\r\nThe report went on to discuss the occult question: Who was responsible\r\nfor the Newcastle Programme? \"The Federation,\" it said, \"had steadily\r\nrefused to formulate a political programme. . . . How then did the\r\nNewcastle Programme come into existence? No Newcastle Programme was ever\r\nframed by the Federation or by any one connected with it.\" The Council\r\nmerely passed a number of resolutions urging reforms, all of which had\r\nbeen demanded at previous meetings. \"But the resolutions of this\r\nparticular meeting received a special significance from the fact that\r\n. . . to the surprise of every one, our great leader, Mr. Gladstone\r\n. . . took up _seriatim_ the resolutions which had been passed at the\r\nCouncil Meetings and gave them the weight of his direct approval. The\r\nnewspapers at once spoke of the Newcastle Programme.\"[530:1] Poor Mr.\r\nGladstone! It seems that by taking the action of the Federation too\r\nseriously, he became quite unconsciously[530:2] the unfortunate author\r\nof the Newcastle Programme.\r\n\r\nA few members protested vehemently in favour of the changes they had\r\nproposed in the rules, but the report of the General Committee was\r\nadopted with only two dissentients; and thus the opposition to the\r\nconcentration of power in the hands of a small executive body was laid\r\nto rest. But it must be observed that if the direction of the Federation\r\nis in the hands of a few men, their power is exerted, not to incite, but\r\nto restrain the Council, not to use it to carry through a policy of\r\ntheir own, but to prevent it from doing something indiscreet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Discussion in the Press.]\r\n\r\nThe ill-starred Newcastle Programme, and the concentration of authority\r\nwithin the Liberal organisation to which it gave rise, provoked\r\ndiscussion in the press as well as in the Federation itself, with the\r\ncontending views painted in higher colours. One can find articles\r\nwritten to prove that the political machine had taken the place of\r\npublic opinion;[530:3] or that the Federation acted at the instigation\r\nof the whips, was as much subject to the Liberal Government as the Board\r\nof Trade, and was used by the leaders to register opinions upon\r\nquestions on which the party itself was divided;[531:1] or finally that\r\nthe Federation had become an anti-democratic juggernaut, which elevated\r\nthe aristocratic elements in the party and killed enthusiasm.[531:2]\r\nOpinions of this kind are exaggerated, springing from dread of the\r\norganisation, or disappointment at the results achieved.\r\n\r\nAnother writer tells us more calmly that the evolution of Liberal policy\r\ngoes through three stages: first, a free discussion in the General\r\nCommittee, which shows the trend if not the balance of opinion, but\r\nwhich does not add articles to the party programme, because the\r\nFederation does not act by majorities, and all the associations may not\r\nhave sent delegates to the committee; second, the adoption by the\r\nCouncil, without amendment or real debate, of resolutions which have\r\nbeen found to command the assent of practically the whole party; and\r\nthird, the unfettered selection by the Liberal cabinet from among those\r\nresolutions, of the measures they think it best to bring before\r\nParliament.[531:3] The writer states correctly the theory of the matter;\r\nand sees clearly that although the General Committee is allowed to\r\ndiscuss very freely and to act by majority, its decisions are not\r\nconsidered authoritative, while the Council which speaks in the name of\r\nthe party is not permitted to deal at all with questions that might\r\narouse a serious difference of opinion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The General Committee and Council at Work.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Example in the Boer War.]\r\n\r\nThe actual working of the National Liberal Federation is well\r\nillustrated by its action in regard to the Boer War, a matter on which\r\nthe Liberals were divided. At a meeting of the General Committee in\r\nDecember, 1899, a resolution was proposed, saying that there was much to\r\ndeplore in the conduct of negotiations with President Kruger, and that\r\nin making peace due regard must be paid to the wishes of all sections of\r\nthe South African population; but avoiding carefully any statement\r\nwhether the war was inevitable or not. A second clause simply praised\r\nthe soldiers and expressed sympathy with the sufferers. A motion was\r\nmade to add somewhat incongruously in the clause a recital that \"a wise\r\nstatesmanship could and should have avoided\" the war, and it was carried\r\nby 114 votes to 94.[532:1] But this was treated merely as the opinion of\r\nthe persons present, not as binding the party; and when the agenda was\r\nprepared for the meeting of the Council in the following March, the\r\nExecutive Committee, wishing to avoid points of difference, omitted the\r\nwords that had been inserted. The principal resolution relating to the\r\nwar was introduced in the Council by a speech in which the mover\r\nvirtually threw the blame for the war upon the Boers. This raised a\r\nstorm of dissent, and speakers took the other side with no mild\r\nlanguage. But an amendment could not be moved, and after the most\r\ncontradictory opinions had been uttered the resolution was adopted\r\nunanimously.[532:2] The members of the General Committee, therefore,\r\nexpressed their views individually and collectively, but ineffectually,\r\nwhile in the larger assembly the members could personally declare their\r\nopinions, but the Council as a whole could not. It could only pass a\r\nresolution carefully drawn so as to conceal the differences of opinion\r\nthat existed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Selection of the Party Leader.]\r\n\r\nAt one time the Federation was tempted to lay its hand on a matter even\r\nmore delicate than the formulation of party policy, and that is the\r\nselection of the party leader. On Dec. 13, 1898, Sir William Harcourt's\r\nresignation of the Liberal leadership in the House of Commons was made\r\npublic, and it so happened that the General Committee met three days\r\nlater. There a motion was made requesting him to reconsider his\r\nposition, and another \"That, in the opinion of this meeting, the\r\nquestion of the leadership of the Liberal party should be taken into\r\nimmediate consideration, and calls upon the leaders to close up their\r\nranks.\" In deference, however, to a strong feeling that the motions did\r\nnot come within the functions of the Federation they were\r\nwithdrawn;[533:1] and before the Council met the Liberals in the House\r\nof Commons had chosen Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman as their leader. The\r\ndecision in the Committee was wise, for the success of parliamentary\r\ngovernment depends upon the fact that the leaders in the Commons possess\r\nthe influence required to command the support of their followers, and\r\nthis can be secured only by having them selected, formally or\r\ninformally, by the members of the party in Parliament. A man chosen by a\r\npopular body outside might well be quite unable to lead the House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Federation is Muzzled.]\r\n\r\nThe National Liberal Federation has now had a history of thirty years,\r\nand it has proved very different from what it was originally intended to\r\nbe. As an organisation it is highly useful to the party in many ways. It\r\ndoes valuable work in promoting local organisation, in distributing\r\nparty literature, in collecting information, and in keeping the Liberal\r\nworkers throughout the country alert. Even the Council does good service\r\nin arousing enthusiasm, and preserving an appearance of participation by\r\nthe rank and file in the management of party affairs. But as a Liberal\r\nparliament outside of the imperial legislature, which directs the policy\r\nof the party, the Federation is a sham. The General Committee can debate\r\nand act freely, but the lack of a sufficiently representative character,\r\nand the almost invariable absence of all the leading Liberals,[533:2]\r\ndeprives its deliberations of any real might; while the Council is\r\neffectively muzzled. Its resolutions are carefully prepared so as to\r\nexpress no opinions on which every one does not agree, and hence they\r\ndeclare nothing that every one did not know already. Nevertheless it\r\ninvolves some dangers. Popular excitement on some question might force\r\nthe Executive Committee to bring in unwise resolutions; the Council\r\nitself might become roused, and by a change in the rules tear off the\r\nmuzzle; and it is not inconceivable that a man with popular talents and\r\na demagogic temperament might capture the organisation, and use it to\r\ncombat the leaders and thrust himself into power.\r\n\r\nTo a person unfamiliar with the hopes and fears inspired by the Caucus a\r\ngeneration ago, a discussion of this length about a body that wields\r\nvery little real power may seem like a long chapter on the snakes in\r\nIceland; but there are a couple of good reasons for treating the subject\r\nthoroughly. The very fact that the Caucus was regarded as the coming\r\nform of democracy, destined to undermine the older political\r\ninstitutions of the nation, makes its subsequent history important, for\r\nit shows that among a highly practical people democratic theories about\r\ndirect expression of the popular will yield to the exigencies of actual\r\npublic life. The story of the Caucus illustrates also the central\r\nconception of this book, that in the English parliamentary system\r\nleadership must be in the hands of the parliamentary leaders. We have\r\nseen this principle at work in the House of Commons, and a popular\r\norganisation, in attempting to direct party policy, strove against it in\r\nvain. That the result is not an accident may be seen from the experience\r\nof the Conservative party, where a similar movement, not less dramatic\r\nat times, has travelled through different paths to the same end.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[501:1] These and the following statements are taken from the official\r\n\"Proceedings attending the formation of the National Federation of\r\nLiberal Associations with Report of Conference held in Birmingham on\r\nThursday, May 31, 1877.\" Since this chapter was written, \"The National\r\nLiberal Federation, from its Commencement to the General Election of\r\n1906,\" has been published by Dr. Robert Spence Watson, for many years\r\nits president.

After\r\nsome preliminary meetings it was definitely formed at a conference in\r\nNovember, 1867, where delegates from fifty-four towns and the University\r\nof London were present.[535:1] Here a constitution was adopted, which,\r\nwith the amendments made in the first few years, contained the following\r\nprovisions. Any Conservative or Constitutional association might be\r\nadmitted to the Union on payment of one guinea a year, and would then be\r\nentitled to send two delegates to the Conference. This last body was the\r\ngreat representative assembly of the Union. Like the Council of the\r\nNational Liberal Federation it was to meet in a different place each\r\nyear,[535:2] and was composed of the two delegates from each subscribing\r\nassociation, of the officers of the Union, and of such honorary members\r\nas were also members of the Council. The Council was the executive body\r\nof the Union, and consisted of the president, treasurer, and trustees;\r\nof twenty-four members elected by the Conference; of not more than\r\ntwenty nominated by the principal provincial associations; and of such\r\nmembers of the Consultative Committee as were willing to act, the last\r\nbeing a body formed out of vice-presidents and honorary members to which\r\ndifficult questions could be referred.\r\n\r\nIn order to attract money, it was provided that any one subscribing a\r\nguinea a year should be an honorary member of the Union, that the\r\nsubscribers of five guineas a year should be vice-presidents with seats\r\n_ex officio_ in the Conference, and that any one subscribing twenty\r\nguineas should be a vice-president for life. In order to attract titles\r\nprovision was made for the election of a patron and ten vice-patrons of\r\nthe Union. These methods of procuring the countenance of rank and wealth\r\nwere not tried in vain. In 1869 Lord Derby became the patron of the\r\nUnion, and on his death he was succeeded by the Duke of Richmond. In the\r\nreport of the Council in 1872 we read, \"the total number of\r\nvice-presidents is now 365, among whom are 66 noblemen, and 143 past and\r\npresent members of the House of Commons.\" The honorary members at the\r\nsame time numbered 219.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Objects of the Union.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It did not Try to Guide Party Policy.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the National Union was much older than the National Liberal\r\nFederation, it attracted far less notice. During its earlier years,\r\nindeed, the Conferences were very small affairs. At the second\r\nConference, for example, in 1868, there were present only three officers\r\nand four delegates, and in the two following years respectively only\r\nthirty-six and thirty-five persons all told. The chief reason, however,\r\nwhy the Union made so much less stir than the Federation, lies in the\r\nnature of the work it undertook to do. The Federation was a weapon of\r\nmilitant radicalism, designed to carry into effect an aggressive public\r\npolicy, and was considered a serious menace to old institutions; but the\r\nUnion was intended merely as an instrument for helping the Conservative\r\nparty to win victories at the elections. Its object was to strengthen\r\nthe hands of local associations; while its work consisted chiefly in\r\nhelping to form such associations, and in giving information.[537:1]\r\nFor this purpose, it kept a register of all Conservative associations,\r\nso that it could act as their London agency; it offered suggestions, was\r\nready to give advice, printed and distributed pamphlets, and arranged\r\nfor speeches and lectures.[537:2] The Union made no claim to direct the\r\npolicy of the party. At the meeting in 1867, when the Constitution was\r\nadopted, one speaker said that \"unless the Union was managed by the\r\nleaders of the Conservative party it would have no force and no effect\r\nwhatever,\" and this was given as a reason for making the honorary\r\nmembers eligible to the Council.[537:3] The matter was put in a nutshell\r\nsome years later by Mr. Cecil Raikes, one of the founders, when he said\r\nthat \"the Union had been organised rather as what he might call a\r\nhandmaid to the party, than to usurp the functions of party\r\nleadership.\"[537:4] In fact, for the first nine years the Conference\r\npassed no resolutions of a political character at all, and those which\r\nit adopted during the decade that followed expressed little more than\r\nconfidence in the leaders of the party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its Relation to the Party Leaders.]\r\n\r\nMr. (afterwards Sir John) Gorst, who had presided at the first\r\nConference in 1867, was appointed in 1870 principal agent of the\r\nparty--that is, the head, under the whips, of the Conservative Central\r\nOffice--and in order to connect the new representative organisation with\r\nthe old centralised one he was made the next year honorary secretary of\r\nthe Union.[537:5] The policy was soon carried farther. In their report\r\nfor 1872 the Council said: \"Since the last conference, an arrangement\r\nhas been made by which the work of the Union has been more closely\r\nincorporated with that of the party generally, and its offices have been\r\nremoved to the headquarters of the party in Parliament Street. This\r\narrangement has been productive of the most satisfactory results, not\r\nonly by having brought the Union into more direct contact with the\r\nleaders of the party, and thereby enhancing the value of its operations,\r\nbut also by greatly reducing its working expenses.\" At an early stage of\r\nits existence, therefore, the Union took for its honorary secretary an\r\nofficer responsible through the whips to the leaders of the party in\r\nParliament, and this was openly proclaimed an advantage. No secret was\r\nmade of the fact that the Union was expected to follow, not to lead; for\r\nat the banquet held in connection with the Conference that same year the\r\nEarl of Shrewsbury, in proposing a toast to the Army, said, \"The duty of\r\na soldier is obedience, and discipline is the great characteristic of\r\nthe army and navy, and I may also say that in a like manner it is\r\ncharacteristic of the Conservative Union.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Conference of 1872.]\r\n\r\nThe Conference held in 1872 seems to have been the first that attracted\r\nmuch public attention, and it was notable for two things. Mr. Disraeli\r\nhad insisted that the working classes were by nature conservative, and\r\nthat the extension of the franchise would bring an accession of strength\r\nto his party. His opponents, assuming that Liberalism was a corollary of\r\ndemocracy, had laughed at the idea; and although his followers had\r\nexpended much energy in organising Conservative workingmen's\r\nassociations, the results of the election of 1868 appeared to have\r\ndisproved his theory. But the meeting in 1872 showed that among the\r\nartisans Tories were by no means rare. In connection with the\r\nConference, which was held in London, a great banquet was given at the\r\nCrystal Palace, and this caused Mr. Cecil Raikes, the chairman of the\r\nCouncil, to remark: \"a few years ago\" everybody said \"that if a\r\nConservative workingman could be found he ought to be put in a glass\r\ncase. We have found for him the largest glass case in England to-night.\"\r\nThe banquet was also notable for a speech by Mr. Disraeli, which was\r\nridiculed at the time on account of the characteristically grandiloquent\r\nphrase, \"You have nothing to trust to but your own energy and the\r\nsublime instinct of an ancient people.\"[539:1] Nevertheless it was a\r\nremarkable speech, for it laid down the main principles of Tory policy\r\nfor the next thirty years and more, a feat that is probably without\r\nparallel in modern history.[539:2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Complaints that the Union was not Representative.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Conservative party carried the country at the general\r\nelection of 1874, and Mr. Disraeli, for the first time, came into power\r\nwith a majority at his back, popular interest in the Union grew slowly.\r\nAs late as 1878 not more than two hundred and sixty-six out of the nine\r\nhundred and fifty Conservative associations were affiliated to the\r\nUnion, and delegates from only forty-seven of them attended the\r\nConference.[539:3] Yet complaints were already heard that foreshadowed\r\nthe strife to come in the future. In 1876 Mr. Gorst, the honorary\r\nsecretary, but no longer the principal agent of the party, proposed to\r\nreorganise the Council by making it more representative in\r\ncharacter.[539:4] His suggestion was opposed by Mr. Raikes, and was\r\nvoted down. The next year, however, he returned to the subject, moving\r\nfirst to abolish the Consultative Committee altogether, and then that\r\nits members should not sit on the Council. He withdrew these motions on\r\nthe understanding that the Council would consider the matter; and\r\nalthough other persons also urged that the Council should be\r\nstrengthened by becoming a more representative body, the only action\r\ntaken at this meeting was to provide that the Council itself should not\r\npropose for reelection more than two thirds of its retiring members.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes in its Rules.]\r\n\r\nMr. Gorst resigned his position as honorary secretary in November, and\r\nin spite of continued criticism of the Council on the ground that it was\r\nto a great extent self-elected,[540:1] nothing was done to change its\r\ncomposition until after the Liberals had won the general election of\r\n1880. Under the pressure of the defeat the Conference of that year\r\nadopted a new set of rules drawn up by the Council itself. They provided\r\nthat the associations should be represented at the Conference in\r\nproportion to their size; that the members of the Consultative Committee\r\nshould no longer sit on the Council; and that instead of the twenty\r\nmembers of the Council nominated by the principal associations, who were\r\nsaid to attend little, the Council itself should add twelve persons to\r\nits number. This plan of cooptation was destined to open the door for a\r\nmost audacious attempt to capture the organisation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Fourth Party.]\r\n\r\nThe chance for a new man to distinguish himself in Parliament comes in\r\nOpposition. As Mr. Winston Churchill remarks in the life of his father:\r\n\"There is small scope for a supporter of a Government. The Whips do not\r\nwant speeches, but votes. The Ministers regard an oration in their\r\npraise or defence as only one degree less tiresome than an\r\nattack.\"[540:2] But in the Opposition free lances are applauded if they\r\nassault the Treasury Bench from any quarter. Moreover, although the game\r\nof politics in England is played under a conventional code of rules\r\nwhich are scrupulously observed, a skilful player can achieve a rapid\r\nprominence by violating the rules boldly, if he has great ability, high\r\nsocial rank, or wins the ear of the people. These truths were turned to\r\nadvantage in the Parliament which sat from 1880 to 1885 by Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill and his small band of friends, who, in contradistinction to\r\nthe Liberals, Conservatives, and Irish Home Rulers, came to be known as\r\nthe Fourth Party. The general election of 1880 had brought Mr. Gladstone\r\nback to power, and in the course of this administration he was obliged\r\nto face unexpectedly many delicate and difficult questions. The\r\nConservative Opposition was led by Sir Stafford Northcote, a man of\r\ndecorous rather than combative temperament, who had been Mr. Gladstone's\r\nprivate secretary in early life, and was not inclined to carry\r\nparliamentary contests to extremes. The conditions were favourable to a\r\nsmall body of members, something between knights errant and banditti,\r\nwho fought as guerillas under the Conservative banner, but attacked on\r\noccasion their own leaders with magnanimous impartiality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its Origin and Policy.]\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Party began in one of those accidents that happen in\r\nirregular warfare.[541:1] The Bradlaugh case, involving the thorny\r\nquestion whether a professed atheist could qualify in the House of\r\nCommons by affirmation or oath, vexed the whole life of the Parliament,\r\nand brought together in the opening days Sir Henry Wolff, Mr. John\r\nGorst, Lord Randolph Churchill, and Mr. Arthur Balfour. This case, in\r\nwhich they played successfully upon the feelings of the House, made them\r\nat once conspicuous, and taught them the value of concerted action. With\r\na short interruption, caused by a difference of opinion about the Irish\r\nCoercion Bill of 1881, the friends acted in harmony for four years. They\r\nhad no formal programme, and no one of them was recognised as the chief,\r\nbut it was understood that they should defend one another when attacked,\r\nand they were in the habit of dining together to arrange a common plan\r\nof action. They took a vigorous part in all debates, criticised the\r\ngovernment unsparingly, and under the pretence of assisting to perfect\r\nits measures, spun out the discussions and obstructed progress. They\r\nshowed great skill in baiting Mr. Gladstone, and when delay was their\r\nobject, in drawing him by turns into long explanations in response to\r\nplausible questions about the clauses of his bills. Their\r\naggressiveness, and their profession of popular principles under the\r\nname of Tory democracy, spread their reputation in the country, and gave\r\nthem an importance out of proportion to their number or their direct\r\ninfluence in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its Attacks on the Tory Leaders.]\r\n\r\nThroughout its career the Fourth Party assumed to be independent of the\r\nregular Conservative leaders in the House. At times it went much\r\nfarther, accusing them of indecision and an inability to lead, which\r\ndisorganised the party. Lord Beaconsfield's death in 1881 left the\r\nConservatives with no single recognised leader; for Lord Salisbury was\r\nchosen by the Tory peers leader of the House of Lords; and Sir Stafford\r\nNorthcote remained, as he had been in Lord Beaconsfield's last years,\r\nthe leader in the House of Commons, neither of them being regarded as\r\nsuperior in authority to the other. The members of the Fourth Party\r\nasserted that this dual leadership, by causing uncertainty in the\r\ncounsels of the party, was disastrous; and they soon settled upon Sir\r\nStafford Northcote as the object of their censure. The attack upon him\r\nculminated in April, 1883, when his selection to unveil the statue of\r\nLord Beaconsfield seemed to indicate that he was to be the future\r\npremier whenever the Conservatives might come to power. On that occasion\r\nLord Randolph Churchill published a couple of letters in _The Times_ in\r\nwhich he spoke of Sir Stafford in strong terms, and declared that Lord\r\nSalisbury was the only man capable of taking the lead. These he followed\r\nup by an article in the _Fortnightly Review_ for May, entitled \"Elijah's\r\nMantle,\" describing the decay of the Conservative party, setting forth\r\nhis ideas of Tory democracy as a means of regeneration, designating Lord\r\nSalisbury as the proper heir to Lord Beaconsfield's mantle, but\r\nrevealing at the same time his confidence in his own fitness for\r\ncommand. His quarrel with his chief in the House of Commons did not\r\nimpair his popularity in the country; while his speeches, with their\r\ninvective against prominent Liberals, and their appeals for the support\r\nof the masses, caught the fancy of the Tory crowds. Hitherto he had\r\ndecried Sir Stafford Northcote and praised Lord Salisbury, but he now\r\nembarked upon an adventure that brought him into sharp conflict with the\r\nlatter. Mr. Balfour, being Lord Salisbury's nephew, could not follow in\r\nthe new path, and before long opposed his former comrade, while the\r\nother two members of the Fourth Party continued to support him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Randolph Churchill's Plan to Capture the Union.]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1883 Lord Randolph Churchill conceived the bold plan of\r\ngetting control of the National Union of Conservative Associations, and\r\nmaking it, under his guidance, a great political force in the party.\r\nComplaints had already been made, as we have seen, that the Council,\r\ninstead of being truly representative, was in the hands of a small\r\nself-elected group of men. In fact the Council had been managed in\r\nconcert with the leaders of the party in Parliament; while the real\r\ndirection of electoral matters was vested in the \"Central Committee,\" a\r\nbody quite distinct from the Union, created at the instance of Lord\r\nBeaconsfield after the defeat of 1880 to devise means of improving the\r\nparty organisation. The Committee had become permanent, and, working\r\nunder the whips, had exclusive charge of the ample sums subscribed for\r\ncampaign expenses. In order to achieve any large measure of independent\r\npower the National Union must have pecuniary resources, and hence, as a\r\npart of his plan, Lord Randolph Churchill determined to obtain for it a\r\nshare of the funds in the possession of the Central Committee.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Conference at Birmingham in 1883.]\r\n\r\nThe three friends were already members of the Council. Sir Henry Wolff\r\nhad been there from the beginning. Mr. Gorst, who had taken an active\r\npart in its work in the past, had recently been given a seat again as\r\nvice-chairman; and Lord Randolph Churchill had been elected a coopted\r\nmember in 1882 by the casting vote of the chairman, Lord Percy. The\r\nfirst scene in the drama was arranged for the Conference held at\r\nBirmingham on Oct. 2, 1883. There, when the usual motion was made to\r\nadopt the annual report, a Mr. Hudson moved a rider directing \"the\r\nCouncil for the ensuing year to take such steps as may be requisite for\r\nsecuring to the National Union its legitimate influence in the party\r\norganisation.\" He said that the Conservative workingmen should not be\r\nled by the nose, and that the Union ought to have the management of its\r\nown policy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Randolph Churchill's Speech.]\r\n\r\nLord Randolph Churchill supported the rider in a characteristic speech,\r\nin which he described how the Central Committee had drawn into their own\r\nhands all the powers and available resources of the party. \"From that\r\nday to this,\" he went on, \"in spite of constant efforts on the part of\r\nmany members of your Council, in spite of a friction which has been\r\ngoing on ever since, your Council has been kept in a state of tutelage,\r\nyou have been called upon year by year to elect a Council, which does\r\nnot advise, and an Executive which does not administer. . . . I should\r\nlike to see the control of the party organisation taken out of the hands\r\nof a self-elected body, and placed in the hands of an elected\r\nbody.\"[544:1] He intimated that the Central Committee had used money at\r\nthe last election for corrupt purposes, and declared that such practices\r\nwould not cease until the party funds were managed openly. Finally, he\r\nsaid that the Conservative party would never gain power until it gained\r\nthe confidence of the working classes, who must, therefore, be invited\r\nto take a share, and a real share, in the party government. Several men\r\nspoke on the other side, among them Lord Percy, who repudiated the\r\ncharge that the Central Committee had spent money corruptly. He said\r\nthat he and others had been members both of that Committee and of the\r\nCouncil, and that there was a constant interchange of ideas between the\r\ntwo bodies. He was willing, however, to accept the rider upon the\r\nunderstanding that the Conference was not committed to any of the modes\r\nof carrying it out that had been suggested. The rider was then adopted\r\nunanimously.[545:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He becomes Chairman of the Council.]\r\n\r\nLord Randolph Churchill was elected to the Council, and so were many of\r\nhis opponents. The parties were, in fact, nearly evenly balanced, but he\r\nand his friends had the great advantage of a definite, well-arranged\r\nplan. Twelve coopted members were to be chosen, and by presenting the\r\nnames of prominent men from the large towns, to whom his opponents found\r\nit hard to object, Lord Randolph secured a small but decisive majority\r\non the Council. At the first meeting in December he procured the\r\nappointment of a committee to consider the best means of carrying into\r\neffect the rider passed at the Conference. The committee was composed\r\nmainly of his friends, and at once elected him its chairman, although\r\naccording to the custom that had been followed hitherto the chairman of\r\nthe Council, Lord Percy, should have presided in all the committees.\r\nEarly in January, 1884, the committee had an interview with Lord\r\nSalisbury, and brought to his notice the uneasiness that prevailed about\r\nthe party organisation, and the desire of the Union to obtain its\r\nlegitimate share of influence in the management. Lord Salisbury took the\r\nmatter under consideration. Meanwhile, on February 1, when the committee\r\nreported progress to the Council, Lord Percy protested against his\r\nexclusion from the chair, and motions were made to the effect that he\r\nought to preside at meetings of committees; but they were rejected by\r\nclose votes. Thereupon he resigned his position as chairman of the\r\nCouncil, and as he refused to withdraw his resignation, Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill was, on Feb. 15, chosen to succeed him by seventeen votes to\r\nfifteen for Mr. Chaplin. Lord Salisbury, however, ignoring the change of\r\nchairman, still communicated with the Council through Lord Percy, which\r\nexasperated Lord Randolph's partisans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Salisbury's Letter of Feb. 29, 1884.]\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 29, Lord Salisbury, in a letter to Lord Randolph Churchill,\r\nreplied, on behalf of himself and Sir Stafford Northcote, to the\r\nsuggestions that had been made to him in January. He began by observing\r\nthat no proposals had been put forward by the Union, beyond the\r\nrepresentation that the Council had not opportunity of concurring\r\nlargely enough in the practical organisation of the party. \"It appears\r\nto us,\" he continued, \"that that organisation is, and must remain in all\r\nits essential features, local. But there is still much work which a\r\ncentral body, like the Council of the National Union, can perform with\r\ngreat advantage to the party. It is the representative of many\r\nAssociations on whom, in their respective constituencies, the work of\r\nthe party greatly depends. It can superintend and stimulate their\r\nexertions; furnish them with advice, and in some measure, with funds;\r\nprovide them with lecturers; aid them in the improvement and development\r\nof the local press; and help them in perfecting the machinery by which\r\nthe registration is conducted, and the arrangements for providing\r\nvolunteer agency at Election times. It will have special opportunity of\r\npressing upon the local associations which it represents, the paramount\r\nduty of selecting, in time, the candidates who are to come forward at\r\nthe dissolution. This field of work seems to us large--as large as the\r\nnature of the case permits.\" But he added that any proposal which the\r\nCouncil might desire to submit would receive their attentive\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It is Misconstrued by Lord Randolph.]\r\n\r\nThe letter was, no doubt, intended to enumerate in substance the very\r\nfunctions that the Council had hitherto performed; but the committee\r\naffected to receive it with joy as a complete acceptance of their plan.\r\nThey prepared a report to the Council, stating that the duties which,\r\naccording to Lord Salisbury's letter, ought to devolve upon the Council,\r\nwere such as, with the exception of lecturers, they had not hitherto\r\nbeen permitted to undertake. \"The Council,\" they went on, \"will, no\r\ndoubt, perceive that for the proper discharge of these duties, now\r\nimposed upon them by the leaders of the party, the provision of\r\nconsiderable funds becomes a matter of first-class necessity.\" They\r\nought, therefore, to claim a definite sum out of the funds in the hands\r\nof the Central Committee, from which they had as yet received only\r\nirregular and uncertain contributions. The report recommended that a\r\nsmall executive committee be appointed with directions to carry out Lord\r\nSalisbury's scheme, to incur liability for urgent expenditure, to enter\r\ninto communication with all the local associations in order to learn\r\nabout their candidates, elections, funds, and agents, and to invite from\r\nthose associations the \"fullest and freest communication of all\r\ninformation bearing upon political and parliamentary questions as viewed\r\nin the localities.\" All questions involving large and general principles\r\nof party policy were to be reserved for the determination of the\r\nCouncil, but the chairman and vice-chairman were to be authorised to\r\nperform all ordinary executive acts between meetings. It is needless to\r\npoint out the imitation of the National Liberal Federation as it worked\r\nat that time, or the great power that these changes would throw into the\r\nhands of Lord Randolph Churchill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Further Correspondence.]\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury was informed of the report, and hastened to remove any\r\nmisapprehension. In a letter to Lord Randolph, on March 6, he said he\r\nhad not contemplated that the Union should in any way take the place of\r\nthe Central Committee, and he hoped there was no chance of their paths\r\ncrossing. Lord Randolph replied that he feared that hope might be\r\ndisappointed. \"In a struggle between a popular body and a close\r\ncorporation, the latter, I am happy to say, in these days goes to the\r\nwall.\"[547:1] A correspondence took place also between Lord Salisbury\r\nand Lord Percy, in the course of which the former wrote: \"the Central\r\nCommittee represents the leaders, by whom it is appointed. So far as\r\nthose duties are concerned which attach, and always have attached, to\r\nthe leaders of the party, and depend on their sanction, these can only\r\nbe delegated to gentlemen whom we appoint.\" He said that in his opinion\r\nno change in this respect would be desirable, and that he could not\r\nthink the adoption of the report would be expedient. Lord Percy laid the\r\nletter before the Council, and moved that the report should not be\r\naccepted, but his motion was rejected by a vote of nineteen to fourteen;\r\nthe report was then adopted, and the committee was instructed to confer\r\nwith the leaders of the party as to the best way of carrying out the\r\nplans foreshadowed in their letters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Salisbury's Letter of April 1, 1884.]\r\n\r\nThe temper of the leaders may be imagined, and may well excuse a step,\r\nwhich was, nevertheless, a mistake, because it offended members of the\r\nCouncil of local importance,[548:1] who had probably intended no\r\ndisrespect to Lord Salisbury. Three days after the adoption of the\r\nreport a curt letter came from Mr. Bartley, the principal agent of the\r\nparty, giving the National Union notice to quit the offices occupied\r\njointly with the Central Committee. Lord Randolph Churchill displayed no\r\nopen resentment at this; but treating the objections of the leaders as\r\nif they applied only to the details of the report, he proposed to modify\r\nit in part, especially by a change which showed that the general\r\nquestions of policy reserved for the Council were to relate not to\r\npublic affairs, but merely to party organisation. He held also a\r\nconference with Lord Salisbury, which was again an occasion for\r\nmisunderstanding; for on April 1 that nobleman wrote that as he and Sir\r\nStafford Northcote had already expressed their disapproval of the\r\nreport, they could not consider it further in the absence of\r\nexplanation, but that some passages had been explained at the\r\nconference, and it had been made clear that the National Union did not\r\nintend to trench on the province of the Central Committee, or take any\r\ncourse on political questions not acceptable to the leaders of the\r\nparty. It was very satisfactory, the letter said, to find the Council\r\nagreeing that matters hitherto disposed of by the leaders and the whips\r\nmust remain in their hands, including the expenditure of the funds\r\nstanding in the name of the Central Committee. Lord Salisbury then went\r\non to describe the proper functions of the Council in language evidently\r\nintended to cover the same ground as his letter of Feb. 29.[549:1] He\r\nadded that to insure complete unity of action it was desirable to have\r\nthe whips sit _ex officio_ on the Council, and be present at the\r\nmeetings of all committees; and he ended by saying that under the\r\ncircumstances a separation of establishments would not be necessary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Randolph's Caustic Reply.]\r\n\r\nLord Randolph called at once a meeting of the committee on organisation,\r\nand although only three members besides himself were present, he sent to\r\nLord Salisbury, in the name of the committee, a letter unique in English\r\npolitical annals. The document is long, but the following extracts may\r\nserve to show its meaning and portray its tone: \"It is quite clear to\r\nus,\" it said, \"that . . . we have hopelessly failed to convey to your\r\nmind anything like an appreciation, either of the significance of the\r\nmovement which the National Union commenced at Birmingham in October\r\nlast, or of the unfortunate effect which a neglect or a repression\r\nof that movement by the leaders of the party would have upon the\r\nConservative cause. The resolution of the Conference at Birmingham . . .\r\nsignified that the old methods of party organisation, namely, the\r\ncontrol of parliamentary elections, by the leader, the whip, the paid\r\nagent drawing their resources from secret funds, which were suitable to\r\nthe manipulation of the ten pound householder were utterly obsolete and\r\nwould not secure the confidence of the masses of the people who were\r\nenfranchised by Mr. Disraeli's Reform Bill. . . . The delegates at the\r\nConference were evidently of opinion that . . . the organisation of the\r\nparty would have to become an imitation . . . of the Birmingham Caucus.\r\nThe Caucus may be, perhaps, a name of evil sound and omen in the ears of\r\naristocratic and privileged classes, but it is undeniably the only form\r\nof political organisation which can collect, guide, and control for\r\ncommon objects, large masses of electors. . . . It appeared at first,\r\nfrom a letter which we had the honour of receiving from you on the 29th\r\nFebruary, that your Lordship and Sir Stafford Northcote entered fully\r\nand sympathetically into the wishes of the Council.[550:1] . . . The\r\nCouncil, however, committed the serious error of imagining that your\r\nLordship and Sir Stafford Northcote were in earnest, in wishing them to\r\nbecome a real source of usefulness to the party. . . . The Council have\r\nbeen rudely undeceived . . . the precise language of your former letter\r\nof the 29th February is totally abandoned, and refuge taken in vague,\r\nfoggy, and utterly intangible suggestions. Finally, in order that the\r\nCouncil of the National Union may be completely and for ever reduced to\r\nits ancient condition of dependence upon, and servility to certain\r\nirresponsible persons who find favour in your eyes, you demand that the\r\nwhips of the party, . . . should sit _ex officio_ on the Council. . . .\r\nIt may be that the powerful and secret influences which have hitherto\r\nbeen unsuccessfully at work on the Council with the knowledge and\r\nconsent of your Lordship and Sir Stafford Northcote, may at last be\r\neffectual in reducing the National Union to its former make-believe and\r\nimpotent condition; in that case we shall know what steps to take to\r\nclear ourselves of all responsibility for the failure of an attempt to\r\navert the misfortunes and reverses which will, we are certain, under the\r\npresent effete system of wire-pulling and secret organisation, overtake\r\nand attend the Conservative party at a general election.\"\r\n\r\nA copy of the letter was read to the Council the next day, when a motion\r\nwas made regretting its disrespectful and improper tone, and declining\r\nto accept any responsibility for it. This was defeated by a vote of\r\nnineteen to thirteen, and then an executive committee was appointed to\r\ncarry out the recommendations in the report.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Negotiations Reopened,]\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that after receiving a letter of that kind Lord\r\nSalisbury would have had no more to do with Lord Randolph Churchill\r\nforever, and would have refused to hold further communication with the\r\nCouncil; but politics makes strange bedfellows, especially in a\r\nparliamentary form of government. Lord Salisbury could not afford to\r\nalienate a body which represented a considerable fraction of the\r\nConservatives in the country; while it would have been folly for Lord\r\nRandolph to burn the bridges behind him. Negotiations were, therefore,\r\nopened through a third person, very nearly on the lines of Lord\r\nSalisbury's letter of April 1, except that three thousand pounds a year\r\nwere to be paid to the National Union; and an understanding was nearly\r\nreached, when an event took place which broke it off for a time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and Interrupted.]\r\n\r\nMr. J. M. Maclean, one of Lord Randolph's supporters in the Council,\r\nwhose object had been simply to supplant Sir Stafford Northcote, became\r\nalarmed lest the movement might result in supplanting Lord Salisbury\r\nalso, or might cause a real breach in the party. Not being aware of the\r\npending negotiations, he moved at a meeting of the Council on May 2 the\r\nappointment of a committee to confer with the Central Committee in order\r\nto secure harmony and united action.[552:1] Although letters were read\r\nshowing that steps already taken would probably lead to an\r\nunderstanding, and although Lord Randolph told Mr. Maclean that he\r\nshould regard the motion as one of want of confidence, the latter\r\npersisted, and, as several of Lord Randolph's friends were absent,\r\ncarried his proposal by a vote of seventeen to thirteen. Lord Randolph\r\nthen resigned as chairman of the Council; but his popularity in the\r\ncountry was great, and there was a widespread feeling of regret at a\r\nquarrel among influential members of the party. A conference of chairmen\r\nof the Conservative associations in eight of the chief provincial towns\r\nacted as peacemaker. It drew up a memorandum regretting the lack of\r\nharmony, suggested an arrangement very similar to that almost reached in\r\nthe negotiations recently broken off, and submitted that if these\r\nsuggestions were accepted Lord Randolph should withdraw his resignation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Truce Effected.]\r\n\r\nThe memorandum was laid before the Council at a meeting on May 16, and\r\nLord Randolph was unanimously reelected chairman. At the same meeting,\r\nthe committee, composed mainly of Lord Randolph's opponents, which had\r\nbeen appointed to confer with the Central Committee, reported that they\r\nhad effected an agreement. Again the terms were almost precisely the\r\nones indicated by Lord Salisbury in his letter of April 1, save for the\r\npayment of three thousand pounds a year to the Union.[552:2] Coming from\r\nthis source it is not surprising that they were unsatisfactory to Lord\r\nRandolph's friends, and they were referred back for further\r\nconsideration to the committee reenforced by new members. A month\r\nelapsed, and at a meeting on June 13 the committee reported that they\r\nhad suggested some changes, which the leaders would not accept.[553:1]\r\nThe matter was again recommitted, but finally on June 27, the committee\r\nreported that they had made an agreement on the lines of the earlier\r\nplan, and this was adopted as it stood.\r\n\r\nExcept for a moderate annual subsidy, Lord Randolph Churchill had really\r\nobtained nothing for the National Union.[553:2] Personally he had become\r\nthe leading figure of what purported to be the great representative\r\norganisation of the party, for the chairman of the Council was the most\r\nimportant officer in the Union; but the position of the organisation\r\nitself remained substantially unchanged. The agreement that had been\r\nreached was, however, merely a truce, and both sides canvassed eagerly\r\nthe delegates to the approaching Conference, each hoping for a decisive\r\nvictory that would give undisputed control of the Council.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Conference at Sheffield.]\r\n\r\nThe Conference of the National Union for 1884 met at Sheffield on July\r\n23. It was unusually well attended, with some four hundred and fifty\r\ndelegates in the hall, representing two hundred and thirty-four\r\nassociations. In his speech on presenting the report of the Council Lord\r\nRandolph described the dissensions that had occurred, and begged the\r\ndelegates to elect members who would support one side or the other. His\r\nobject, he said, had been to establish a bona fide popular organisation,\r\nbringing its influence to bear right up to the centre of affairs, so\r\nthat the Tory party might be a self-governing party; but as yet this had\r\nbeen successfully thwarted by those who possessed influence. The speech\r\nwas followed by a fierce debate, ending, of course, in the adoption of\r\nthe report. The real interest of the meeting centred in the ballot for\r\nthe Council, and before that began a change was made in the method of\r\nelection. Instead of choosing twenty-four members, and allowing them to\r\nadd twelve more to their number, a resolution was adopted, whereby all\r\nthirty-six were elected directly by the Conference, thus making the\r\nballot there conclusive upon the complexion of the Council. Judging from\r\nthe action of the Conference on certain minor questions of organisation,\r\nand from the size of Lord Randolph's personal vote for the Council, he\r\nhad the sympathy of a majority of the delegates; but they did not, as he\r\nhad hoped, divide on a sharp line for one side or the other. Lord\r\nRandolph himself received 346 votes, while the next highest on the list,\r\nalthough his supporter, received only 298. When, however, the result was\r\nannounced, his friends formed only a small majority on the Council.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Randolph Makes his Peace and Abandons the Union.]\r\n\r\nLord Randolph Churchill had won a victory; but a victory that was little\r\nbetter than a drawn battle. His own reelection as chairman was assured,\r\nand for the moment he controlled the Council, but his control would be\r\nneither undisputed nor certain to endure. He could use the Union in a\r\nway that would be highly uncomfortable for Lord Salisbury, but he had\r\nnot captured it so completely that he could do with it as he pleased.\r\nAgain it was for the interest of both sides to make peace, and the\r\nnegotiations were completed in a few days. The Central Committee was in\r\nform abolished; the Primrose League, recently founded by the Fourth\r\nParty, was recognised by the leaders; Lord Randolph withdrew from the\r\nchairmanship of the Council; and mutual confidence and harmony of action\r\nwere restored. These appear to have been the nominal conditions.[555:1]\r\nWhether the real terms were ever definitely stated, or were merely left\r\nin the shape of a tacit understanding, it is at present impossible to\r\nsay. The practical upshot was that the Fourth Party was broken up; Lord\r\nRandolph abandoned the National Union to its fate, acted in concert with\r\nthe parliamentary leaders, and was given a seat in the cabinet when the\r\nConservatives next came to power. The reconciliation was sealed by a\r\ndinner given by Lord Salisbury to the Council of the Union.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Later Career.]\r\n\r\nThe subsequent career of Lord Randolph Churchill may be told in a few\r\nwords. In the reorganisation of the Union he took no part, and, indeed,\r\nhe ceased before long to attend the meetings of the Council altogether.\r\nBut when Lord Salisbury formed a ministry in June, 1885, he was offered\r\nthe post of Secretary of State for India, with a seat in the cabinet. He\r\nmade it a condition of acceptance that Sir Stafford Northcote should\r\ncease to lead in the House of Commons. Lord Salisbury, who had been\r\nhitherto loyal to Sir Stafford, hesitated, but at last the old statesman\r\nwas transferred to the oblivion of the House of Lords, and Sir Michael\r\nHicks-Beach took his place as leader of the Commons. Lord Randolph's\r\nsuccess had been extraordinary, but he was destined to reach even\r\ngreater eminence in the near future. The Home Rule Bill, in the session\r\nof 1886, gave him a chance to increase his reputation as a debater, and\r\nwhen the general elections following the rejection of that bill brought\r\na new Conservative government into office, he was given the position of\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer with the leadership of the House of Commons.\r\nHis popularity in the country was greater than ever; his appearance on\r\nthe platform at a Conference of the National Union, on Oct. 26, 1886,\r\n\"was the signal for a tremendous outburst of long-sustained\r\ncheering,\"[555:2] and addresses were presented to him from several\r\nhundred associations. But he overestimated his personal power, and is\r\ncommonly supposed to have thought that one more quarrel would leave him\r\nmaster of the party. His battle-ground was unfortunately chosen, for he\r\ntook his stand in the cabinet for a reduction of the army and navy\r\nestimates, at a time when the national desire for economy was on the\r\nwane. His colleagues did not agree with him, and on Dec. 20 he tendered\r\nhis resignation to the Prime Minister. He was apparently confident of\r\ncoming out victorious; but Mr. Goshen, a Liberal Unionist, took his\r\nplace, and the government went on without him.[556:1] He failed to\r\nrealise that a conflict in 1884 with the leaders of the Conservative\r\nparty in the Houses of Parliament, two men neither of whom had yet\r\nproved his capacity to be at the head of the cabinet or won the full\r\nconfidence of the country, was a very different thing from a quarrel in\r\n1886 with the government of the nation, at a time when it stood in the\r\neyes of the majority of the people as the bulwark against disunion. His\r\nmiscalculation was fatal, and during the few years of his life that were\r\nleft he never regained a position of political importance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reconstruction of the National Union.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the National Union underwent a transformation. The leaders of\r\nthe party were determined that it should not be captured again, or used\r\nto force their hand. But any changes must be made without losing the\r\nsemblance of a democratic organisation; and, in fact, it was believed\r\nthat if the Union were in reality broadly popular it would be more\r\ninclined to follow the leaders of the party, and less easily captured,\r\nthan if it represented only a fraction of the local associations. In\r\nthis respect the position bore some resemblance to that of the National\r\nLiberal Federation after the Home Rule struggle a year later. The time\r\nwas propitious for reconstructing the Union, because the redistribution\r\nact of 1885 had marked off the constituencies on new lines, and thus\r\ninvolved the formation of many of the local associations afresh. It is\r\ninteresting to note that the changes provoked no struggle between those\r\nelements in the Union which had recently been in conflict; and, indeed,\r\nthe dissensions ceased with the withdrawal of Lord Randolph Churchill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The First Changes; 1885.]\r\n\r\nThe first alterations, made in 1885, were designed merely to give the\r\nUnion a broader basis, and the Council a more representative character.\r\nThe most important provision was that every Conservative association\r\nshould be affiliated without the need of any formal action. The Union\r\nthus came to be a really national party organisation in a way that it\r\nhad never been before, the report for 1887 stating that the affiliated\r\nassociations numbered 1100. The changes of 1885 did not affect seriously\r\nthe structure of the Union, or its relation to the whip's office, but\r\nthese questions were taken up at once by three men. One of them was Sir\r\nAlbert Rollit, who drafted and carried through a new set of rules.\r\nAnother was Captain Middleton, who devised the scheme on which those\r\nrules were based. He was appointed principal agent of the party in 1885,\r\nand in 1886 was made honorary secretary of the Union. He continued to\r\nhold both positions until 1903, and so far as the success of the\r\nConservatives at the polls during the period of their ascendency was the\r\nresult of political organisation, it was due to him more than to any one\r\nelse. The third was Mr. Southall, who became in 1886, and has ever since\r\nremained, the secretary of the Union. His constant cooperation with\r\nCaptain Middleton removed the severe friction that had existed between\r\nthe Union and the whip's office, and enabled them to work in perfect\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The New Organisation.]\r\n\r\nThe new rules were adopted at a special conference held in May, 1886, at\r\nwhich more than six hundred delegates were present. Slightly modified so\r\nfar as the National Union itself is concerned in 1887, and as regards\r\nthe divisional unions in 1888, 1889, and 1890, they remained in force\r\nuntil 1906; and hence they governed the organisation of the Conservative\r\nparty during the period of greatest and longest prosperity that it has\r\nknown since the Reform Act of 1832. They recite that the objects of the\r\nUnion are: to form a centre of united action, communication, and\r\ncooperation, among associations; to promote the organisation of\r\nassociations; to spread Conservative principles; and to enable\r\nassociations to give expression to Conservative feeling by petitions and\r\nresolutions. They provide that the chief association of each\r\nconstituency in England and Wales shall be a member of the Union without\r\npayment, while any other association or club with fifty members may be\r\nadmitted on paying one guinea a year;[558:1] and that any person may be\r\nadmitted as an honorary member or vice-president on payment of a sum\r\nappropriate to those dignities.[558:2] The Conference was made to\r\nconsist of the officers and honorary members, and of delegates from\r\nsubscribing associations, from the ten new divisional unions, and from\r\nthe chief organisations of Scotland and Ireland.[558:3] The Council was\r\ncomposed of the president and trustees; of one of the whips, and the\r\nprincipal agent of the party; of twenty-one members elected by the\r\nConference; and of the chairman and three representatives elected by\r\neach of the divisional unions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ten Divisional Unions.]\r\n\r\nWithin the National Union, which included only England and Wales, there\r\nwere created ten new territorial divisions; and a provincial or\r\ndivisional union consisted of all the members of the National Union,\r\nwhether associations or individuals, within that division. It had its\r\nannual meeting corresponding to the Conference, and its council.[559:1]\r\nIn fact, it was intended to be a miniature of the National Union itself,\r\nwith similar structure and functions.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of the National Union, and its subordinate branches, looks\r\nformidable; but it has not proved in practice so complex as it appears.\r\nThe principal change was the creation of the provincial or divisional\r\nunions, which were interposed between the local associations and the\r\ncentral Conference and Council. The object in creating them was said to\r\nbe the development of local effort as essential to the success of the\r\nparty. Representation, it was pointed out, thus passed by graduated\r\nsteps from the individual elector, through the branch or district\r\nassociations and clubs, and through the central associations in each\r\nconstituency to the provincial councils, to be summed up in the\r\nConference and Council of the whole Union.[559:2] Perhaps the words\r\n\"strained\" or \"filtered\" would, better than \"passed,\" have signified the\r\nreal intention, for the divisional unions were designed as a safeguard\r\nagainst popular caprice and personal ambition. They were expected to act\r\nlike water-tight compartments, as it was believed that all ten divisions\r\nwould not go mad at once, and that any man would find it very hard to\r\ncapture enough of them, one at a time, to control the Union. They did\r\nnot, however, develop any vigorous life of their own, and have not had\r\ncorporate solidity enough to maintain separate deliberative bodies. The\r\nannual meetings have been little more than an occasion for an address by\r\nthe president. In short, the divisions did not turn out to be of much\r\nconsequence as a basis for representative party gatherings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Concentration of Power.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the divisions did not prove important from a deliberative point\r\nof view, they have had a very distinct value for administrative\r\npurposes, and have been distinctly convenient as districts for the\r\nspread of Conservative doctrines. Moreover, they have furnished a means\r\nfor controlling the party from headquarters, and a channel through which\r\nit could be kept in touch with the whip's office. This was darkly hinted\r\nat when, on behalf of the committee that framed the new rules, a hope\r\nwas expressed that \"In your local associations, in the provincial\r\nunions, and in the National Union, and with the help also of the\r\nprincipal whip and the principal agent of the party, you will have a\r\nchain of assistance, experience and authority, which will bind together\r\nour party.\" One of the whips and the principal agent of the party were,\r\nindeed, given seats _ex officio_ not only upon the Council of the\r\nNational Union itself, but both upon the Council and the Executive\r\nCommittee of each of its divisions. This was, of course, part of the\r\n\"chain of assistance, experience and authority which will bind together\r\nour party.\"\r\n\r\nAnother provision in the rules relating to the divisional unions has\r\nalso proved important in this respect. It is one that contemplated the\r\nemployment as divisional secretary of a sub-agent of the central office\r\nwithout cost. By doing this the division saved both salary and rent;\r\nwhile the principal agent, who represented the leaders and the whips,\r\nhad in the secretary an agent selected and paid by him. The relation was\r\nthe more useful because the habit of changing every year the president\r\nof the divisional union, and the chairman of its council, prevented any\r\none from acquiring a large influence, except the secretary, who was\r\npermanent. The arrangement was made in most of the divisions. Even where\r\nit was not, the secretary acted as though he were a subordinate of\r\nCaptain Middleton, and being in constant communication with the local\r\nagents, he could give information about political matters throughout his\r\ndivision, thus keeping the principal agent in touch with the whole\r\norganisation of the party. Personally popular and tactful, Captain\r\nMiddleton was enabled by his relation to the divisional agents, by\r\nclose cooperation with the National Union, with the Conservative clubs,\r\nand with other ancillary bodies, to draw all the threads of the\r\nConservative organisation into his office without provoking jealousy, or\r\nappearing to exert more power than naturally belonged to his office. The\r\nresult was that while he held the place of principal agent the\r\nConservative organisation was a highly efficient administrative machine,\r\nworking in perfect harmony with the leaders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resolutions on Political Questions]\r\n\r\nAny popular party organisation in England involves two dangers, one\r\npersonal and the other political; one that a man may use it for selfish\r\npurposes; the other that it may force upon the leaders a policy which\r\nthey were not prepared to adopt. We have seen how this second peril\r\nactually confronted the Liberal Ministry in the form of the Newcastle\r\nProgramme, and how it was met by muzzling the Council of the National\r\nLiberal Federation. In the National Union the difficulty has been solved\r\nin a very different way. Until 1885 the Conference passed no resolutions\r\non general policy, save in the form of expressing confidence in the\r\nleaders, or congratulating them on their exploits; but in that year,\r\nwhen an effort was made to give to the Union the appearance of a free\r\npopular organisation, confessions of faith on current politics began.\r\nResolutions of this kind soon became numerous and included demands to\r\nwhich the Conservative leaders could not assent, such as woman suffrage,\r\nand fair trade, that is, protection in a modified form.[561:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: are Free;]\r\n\r\nBut, except for occasional cases where a delegate was persuaded to\r\nwithdraw his motion, or where it was shelved by the previous question on\r\nthe ground that a vote on the subject would be impolitic, no attempt has\r\nbeen made by the managers to fetter the free expression of opinion. The\r\nConservative leaders, however, made it clear almost at once that they\r\ndid not take the action of the Conference very seriously. In 1887 it\r\nadopted resolutions in favour of fair trade, woman suffrage, and\r\nreforms in the tenure and sale of Church livings; but although Lord\r\nSalisbury, then Prime Minister, in a public speech immediately afterward\r\nsaid, \"More and more in this day political leading and the making of\r\npolitical opinion must be a matter of local effort,\" and although he\r\nreferred to agricultural distress, and the forthcoming budget, he made\r\nno allusion to fair trade, or for that matter to woman suffrage or\r\nChurch livings.[562:1] There was, at first, no doubt, some dread of the\r\neffect the resolutions might have on the public, and on several\r\noccasions the chairman called attention to the fact that among the\r\ndelegates were men connected with the press, warning them not to report\r\nthe proceedings.[562:2] At one time, in fact, an unofficial proposal was\r\nmade to forbid the passing of resolutions altogether. In 1889 a delegate\r\nmoved that although general questions of policy might be discussed, no\r\nvote should in future be taken upon them. The fair trade resolution of\r\n1887, which had provoked criticism, was referred to, and several\r\ngentlemen said they wished to prevent a repetition of that incident. The\r\nmatter was referred to the Council, which reported in the following year\r\nthat they had considered both this suggestion and another that no\r\nresolution should be placed upon the agenda without the consent of the\r\nCouncil; but that they had decided to recommend no change in the rules,\r\nexcept an increase in the number of days prior to the Conference that\r\nnotice of a motion must be sent in. They went even further, and advised\r\nthat reporters for the press should be admitted to the meetings, which\r\nwas done forthwith.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: but are Ignored.]\r\n\r\nThe proceedings at the Conference of the National Union are thus quite\r\nfree. Any delegate or other member has a right, on giving the prescribed\r\nnotice, to prepare a resolution on any subject, and amendments can be\r\nmoved upon the spot. The result has been a large number of declarations\r\nof opinion on public questions, not always consistent or unopposed. A\r\nresolution in favour of woman suffrage was adopted in 1887, 1891, and\r\n1894, and then defeated in 1897 by a substantial majority. The action of\r\nthe Conference is not fettered; it is ignored. Some great nobleman\r\npresides, and one of the party leaders usually addresses a public\r\nmeeting in the evening; but statesmen of the first rank take no part in\r\nthe regular proceedings, which have, therefore, no political weight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Fiscal Question.]\r\n\r\nA proof of the small importance attached to the votes is furnished by\r\nthe history of the movement for fair trade or preferential tariffs.\r\nResolutions in favour of such a policy were passed over and over again,\r\nbut they did not bring the question even within the range of active\r\npolitical issues until Mr. Chamberlain made his speech on the subject to\r\nhis constituents at Birmingham in the spring of 1903. The meeting of the\r\nConference at Sheffield in the following October then awoke a real\r\ninterest; and yet the proceedings at that very meeting show how the\r\nNational Union shrank from a decided stand at a critical moment. The\r\nsituation was extraordinary. Mr. Chamberlain had taken his stand for a\r\npreferential tariff in favour of the colonies, including a duty on\r\ngrain, and had recently resigned from the cabinet to advocate his views\r\nmore freely before the country; while other ministers had resigned\r\nbecause they could not abandon the principle of free trade. Mr. Balfour\r\nhad expressed no definite opinion, and was expected to make a statement\r\non the subject at a public meeting after the close of the first day's\r\nsession of the Union. Under these circumstances a resolution was placed\r\nupon the agenda which stated the need for reconsidering the fiscal\r\nsystem, thanked the Prime Minister for instituting an inquiry on the\r\nsubject, and welcomed the policy of retaliatory tariffs he had\r\nforeshadowed. To this Mr. Chaplin moved a rider favouring explicitly Mr.\r\nChamberlain's views; while Sir John Gorst stood ready to move another\r\nagainst any protective duty on food. During the afternoon the fiscal\r\nquestion was hotly debated, and, judging by the way the free trade\r\nspeakers were interrupted, a large majority of those present must have\r\nagreed with Mr. Chamberlain's opinions; but in order not to pass a vote\r\nbefore hearing the Prime Minister, the debate was adjourned until the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Mr. Balfour declared himself in favour of a retaliatory\r\ntariff as a means of commercial bargaining with other nations, but said\r\nthat a tax on food was not within the limits of practical politics. When\r\nthe debate was resumed the next morning, Mr. Chaplin withdrew his rider,\r\non the ground that it might look like a resolution hostile to the Prime\r\nMinister; and Sir John Gorst said that Mr. Balfour's statement was so\r\nfar satisfactory that he should make no motion. Thus the sharp\r\ndifferences of opinion that seethed in the Conference were calmed on the\r\nsurface, and the original resolution was adopted unanimously, only a\r\ncouple of staunch free traders abstaining from the vote. If ever an\r\nEnglish political organisation had a chance to determine the policy of\r\nthe party it was on this occasion, and a decisive majority was\r\nundoubtedly on Mr. Chaplin's side. Yet this Conference which had often\r\nvoted for fair trade when the ministers would have none of it, shrank\r\nfrom saying what it thought when the ministers were undecided. A\r\nstronger proof could hardly be found that the National Union is\r\npowerless to direct the policy of the party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Organisation Breaks Down after 1903.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the popular character of the National Union was unreal, as\r\nregards both administrative machinery and the formulation of political\r\nopinion, the system worked well so long as the Conservatives were in the\r\nascendent, and Captain Middleton remained in control. But he had\r\nconcentrated the whole management so completely in his own hands that\r\nthe machinery could not run smoothly of itself after he retired in 1903.\r\nHis successor, instead of consulting the officers of the Union,\r\nproceeded as if the Central Office was all-powerful, and thus lost touch\r\nwith the Union and the local associations. Moreover, the sub-agents in\r\nsome of the divisions were not wisely chosen, and caused friction rather\r\nthan harmony in the party. Complaints became loud, and found expression\r\nat the meeting of the Conference at Newcastle in November, 1905, where\r\na resolution was adopted \"that in the opinion of this Conference the\r\nmanagement of the Central Conservative Association in London is\r\ndefective, and needs revising; and for this purpose a popularly elected\r\ncommittee should be appointed to cooperate with the Conservative Whips.\"\r\nThe principal agent thereupon resigned; and the resolution of the\r\nConference, followed by the disastrous defeat at the general election in\r\nthe January following, led to another reorganisation of the party in\r\n1906.\r\n\r\nWhen a ministry that has been in power is beaten at the polls, much of\r\nthe blame is always laid at the door of the party organisation, and a\r\ncry is raised for its reform upon a more democratic basis. The movement\r\non this occasion is interesting enough to merit a little study, because\r\nit furnishes the latest illustration of the way a demand for popular\r\ncontrol within the party is constantly cropping up in England, and of\r\nthe obstacles that it meets. As in earlier cases, the party machinery\r\nwas not so largely responsible as some people asserted. Still it had\r\nfallen out of repair. Besides the dislocation at headquarters, the local\r\nassociations had been neglected in many places; many Tory members of\r\nParliament having come to feel that the country was normally\r\nConservative, and that their own seats were safe, had done little or\r\nnothing to keep the local organisations in working order; while for a\r\ntime some associations had not dared to meet, knowing that any\r\ndiscussion would bring to light sharp differences of opinion on the\r\nquestion of fiscal policy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes of 1906.]\r\n\r\nThe election of January, 1906, was no sooner over than the whips and the\r\nofficers of the National Union set to work to overhaul the party\r\nmachinery. In the first place they created an advisory committee of\r\nseven persons, charged, indeed, with no executive powers, but with the\r\nduty of advising the whip, and thus keeping the leaders in touch with\r\nthe currents of opinion in the party. The committee consisted of the\r\nchief whip, three persons selected by him, and three chosen by the\r\nNational Union.[566:1] In the second place they transferred a number of\r\nfunctions from the Central Office to the Union, together with a staff of\r\nclerks to carry them out, and a grant of money from the funds to defray\r\nthe expense; the most important function so transferred being the entire\r\nsupervision of local organisations, the supply of speakers over the\r\ncountry, and the publication of party literature, the last two of these\r\nhaving been hitherto only to a very small extent in the hands of the\r\nUnion. They worked out also a plan for changes in the organisation of\r\nthe National Union itself, which were discussed and adopted at a special\r\nconference in London.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Conference in July.]\r\n\r\nThe Conference met on July 27; and after a unanimous vote in favour of\r\nthe fiscal policy of the party leaders had been passed, an attack was\r\nmade upon the Central Office in the form of a motion that it ought to be\r\nbrought under more effective popular control. The supporters of the\r\nmotion pointed out that in the new advisory committee the\r\nrepresentatives of the National Union were in a minority; that the\r\ncommittee had authority merely to tender advice; and that even this\r\nfunction did not extend to party finance, to the recommendation of\r\ncandidates for Parliament, or to patronage of any kind. They repeated\r\nthe charge, familiar even before the days of Lord Randolph Churchill,\r\nthat the party was a democracy managed by aristocratic methods, that the\r\nleaders ought to trust it more and suspect it less, and that the Central\r\nOffice had not its confidence. In short the demand was the old one for a\r\nmore popular control of the party machinery. Sir Alexander Acland-Hood,\r\nthe chief whip, met it by stating frankly that the finances were a\r\ndelicate and confidential matter, which must be in the hands of one man;\r\nand--referring to the new advisory body of seven--he said that it would\r\nbe disastrous to have the party managed by a committee. The party could\r\nstand many things, but in his judgment it could not stand a caucus.\r\nPolicy must, he said, be initiated by the leaders; no leader and no whip\r\nwould submit to anything else. Although the demand for greater popular\r\ncontrol had been greeted with applause, it was evident that the\r\nprevailing sentiment of the meeting was with the chief whip, and the\r\nmotion was finally withdrawn; not, however, without an intimation that\r\nit would be renewed in the near future.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The New Rules of 1906.]\r\n\r\nThe special Conference then went on to debate and adopt the new set of\r\nrules, the most important change involved being the enlargement of the\r\nCentral Council by the direct representation thereon of the counties and\r\nboroughs, the former in the proportion of one member for every fifty\r\nthousand voters, the latter in that of one for every twenty-five\r\nthousand. This, it was thought, would make the body more truly\r\nrepresentative, by freeing it both from the control of a small group of\r\nmen, and from the tendency of every annual Conference to choose persons\r\nwhose names were known in the part of the country where the Conference\r\nhappened to meet.[567:1] The only other change of importance related to\r\nthe provincial divisions. These were made more elastic by a provision\r\nthat any one or more counties might be erected into a separate division.\r\nTheir internal organisation was also remodelled; and the arrangement for\r\nfurnishing sub-agents of the Central Office as their secretaries, free\r\nof charge, was abolished, partly because it had ceased to work\r\nsmoothly, and partly because many members of the Union felt that it kept\r\nthem in leading strings.[568:1] The discussion of the divisional\r\ncouncils brought up an interesting question. By the rules of the\r\nNational Union honorary members had already a right to attend the\r\nConference without votes;[568:2] and by the new rules they were given\r\nfull membership in the councils of the provincial divisions. When\r\nstrenuous objection was made to this as undemocratic, a delegate replied\r\nthat if money was the root of all evil, it was also the source of all\r\npower; and that in order to get money it was necessary to do something\r\nfor the men who gave it. The clause was the subject of the only vote at\r\nthe Conference close enough to require a count, and the new provision\r\nwas adopted by 148 to 103. In other respects the existing rules, though\r\nmuch changed in detail, were not altered in their essential\r\nfeatures.[568:3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Probable Effect.]\r\n\r\nThe new arrangements have increased the functions of the National Union,\r\nwhile the enlargement of the Council will, no doubt, change its method\r\nof work, and may possibly make it more useful as an organ for\r\ninterpreting the feelings of the party. But it is highly improbable that\r\nthese things will cause any substantial change in the relation of the\r\norganisation to the leaders in Parliament. There are still several means\r\nof controlling the Union, and preventing it from getting out of hand.\r\nOne of these is furnished by the party war chest, or campaign fund, over\r\nwhich Lord Randolph Churchill tried in vain to get a large share of\r\ncontrol. It is disbursed by the Central Office, and its distribution\r\nholds many constituencies in a state of more or less dependence.\r\n\r\nThen again, even in the last reorganisation, the recommendation of\r\ncandidates for Parliament to places seeking for them has been retained\r\nunder the exclusive control of the Central Office, instead of being\r\nallowed to pass into the hands of the National Union; and this is in\r\nitself no small source of power. As a further security against capture\r\nof the Union, the practice was established in 1889 of changing the\r\nchairman of the Council every year, so that no one could acquire\r\ninfluence enough to be dangerous. Moreover, fidelity upon the Council\r\nhas often brought its reward in the form of a seat in Parliament, or of\r\na baronetcy. So far these various precautions have been effective. Since\r\n1884 no one has attempted to get control of the Union for his personal\r\nadvantage. Certainly the capture of the organisation has been made more\r\ndifficult than it was formerly, but it would be rash to predict that it\r\nis altogether impossible. Nor would it be safe to say that the Union\r\nwill never embarrass the leaders by laying down a definite course of\r\npolicy and insisting that the leaders should adopt it; this, however,\r\nnever has happened, and there appears no more reason to expect it in the\r\nfuture than in the past.\r\n\r\nThe National Unions both in England and Scotland[569:1] have very\r\nimportant functions, which they perform with great efficiency; but they\r\nare really electioneering bodies. Their work is to promote local\r\norganisation, to arouse interest, to propagate Conservative doctrines,\r\nand this they do exceedingly well by means of departments for the\r\npublication of party literature and for providing lecturers. The English\r\nUnion has established also a political library in London, which collects\r\na large amount of information, including the speeches and records of all\r\nthe leading men in public life. But as organs for the popular control of\r\nthe party, for formulating opinion, and for ascertaining and giving\r\neffect to the wishes of the rank and file, these bodies are mere\r\npretences. Both the National Liberal Federation and the National Union\r\nof Conservative Associations have been sources of anxiety to the party\r\nleaders, but for the time, at least, both have been made harmless. The\r\nprocess in each case has not been the same, although the results are not\r\nunlike. Both are shams, but with this difference that the Conservative\r\norganisation is a transparent, and the Liberal an opaque, sham.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[535:1] The reports of the first three Conferences are found only in the\r\nmanuscript minutes of proceedings. Reports of the fourth to the ninth\r\nConference inclusive were printed. Since that time only the reports of\r\nthe Council and the programmes for the Conferences have been published.\r\n\r\n[535:2] In the original constitution it was to meet every third year in\r\nLondon, but this was changed in 1868. It will be observed that the\r\nConference corresponds to the Council of the National Liberal\r\nFederation; and the Council, although a much smaller body, to the\r\nGeneral Committee of the Federation.\r\n\r\n[537:1] _Cf._ Statement made at first Conference, 1868, and Rep. of the\r\nCouncil at the Conference of 1875.\r\n\r\n[537:2] _Cf._ Leaflet No. 1, 1876.\r\n\r\n[537:3] Manuscript minutes, p. 57.\r\n\r\n[537:4] Rep. of the Conference of 1873.\r\n\r\n[537:5] Rep. of the Council for 1871. He held the post of principal\r\nagent through the general election of 1874 which his efforts helped much\r\nto win. In 1881 he took the position again, and at that time was made a\r\nvice-chairman of the Council so as to bring the Union into cooperation\r\nwith the whips' office. (Rep. of the Council for 1881.)\r\n\r\n[539:1] Punch made the expression the subject of a cartoon.\r\n\r\n[539:2] Curiously enough he suggested one principle which has only\r\nrecently been taken up seriously by Conservative leaders. Among the\r\nthree great objects of the party he placed the upholding of the empire,\r\nand in speaking of this he said that when self-government was given to\r\nthe colonies, it ought to have been with provisions for an imperial\r\ntariff, common defence, and some representative council in London.\r\n\r\n[539:3] Rep. of Conference of 1878. But many of the local associations\r\nmay have been branches with less than one hundred members, and therefore\r\nnot admissible under the rules.\r\n\r\n[539:4] The need of a reorganisation of the party on a more popular\r\nbasis was afterward urged by Mr. Gorst and Sir Henry Drummond Wolff in\r\nan article entitled \"The State of the Opposition,\" _Fortnightly Review_,\r\nNovember, 1882.\r\n\r\n[540:1] _E.g._, by Dr. Evans. Rep. of Conference of 1878.\r\n\r\n[540:2] \"Lord Randolph Churchill,\" I., 69.\r\n\r\n[541:1] The best accounts of the Fourth Party are to be found in Winston\r\nChurchill's \"Life of Lord Randolph Churchill,\" I., Ch. iii., and in\r\nthree articles by Harold E. Gorst entitled \"The Story of the Fourth\r\nParty\" in the _Nineteenth Century_ for November, and December, 1902 and\r\nJanuary, 1903, afterward republished as a book. These accounts are\r\nwritten by the sons of two of the members of the group, and may be taken\r\nto express the views of those two members.\r\n\r\n[544:1] These words are taken from the manuscript report of the\r\nConference in the records of the National Union. The language is more\r\nbrief, and differs in unimportant details from that quoted in Winston\r\nChurchill's life of Lord Randolph.\r\n\r\n[545:1] A motion was also carried unanimously requesting the Council to\r\nconsider a method of electing its members, such that the associations\r\nmight be represented upon it by delegates.\r\n\r\n[547:1] These two letters do not appear in the report of the Council,\r\nbut are quoted by Mr. Winston Churchill.\r\n\r\n[548:1] Winston Churchill, \"Lord Randolph Churchill,\" I., 318.\r\n\r\n[549:1] \"It appears to us that these objects may be defined to be the\r\nsame as those for which the Associations themselves are working. The\r\nchief object for which the Associations exist is to keep alive and\r\nextend Conservative convictions, and so to increase the number of\r\nConservative voters. This is done by acting on opinion through various\r\nchannels; by the establishment of clubs, by holding meetings, by\r\nsecuring the assistance of speakers and lecturers, and by the\r\ncirculation of printed matter in defence of Conservative opinions, by\r\ncollecting the facts required for the use of Conservative speakers and\r\nwriters, and by the invigoration of the local press.\r\n\r\n\"In all these efforts it is the function of the Council of the National\r\nUnion to aid, stimulate and guide the Associations it represents.\r\n\r\n\"Much valuable work may also be done through the Associations, by\r\nwatching the registration and, at election time, by providing volunteer\r\ncanvassers and volunteer conveyance.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter and the reply to it are printed in full in Winston\r\nChurchill's \"Lord Randolph Churchill,\" I., App. II.\r\n\r\n[550:1] Here follows a rehearsal of the functions Lord Salisbury had\r\nascribed to the Council, which are pronounced to have been clear,\r\ndefinite, and satisfactory. The assurance with which they are assumed to\r\nmean something quite different from what his Lordship must have intended\r\nis one of the marvellous things about the affair.\r\n\r\n[552:1] Maclean's own account of the matter is given in his\r\n\"Recollections of Westminster and India,\" 68-79.\r\n\r\n[552:2] The terms were briefly as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. The two bodies to occupy the same offices.\r\n\r\n2. The Union to attend to the formation and maintenance of local\r\nassociations. The agents of the Central Committee to assist in this and\r\nreport to the Union through the principal agent.\r\n\r\n3. Parliamentary elections, the recommendation of candidates, and\r\nquestions of general policy, to be outside the province of the Union.\r\n\r\n4. The Union to publish literature as it may desire, and to provide\r\nspeakers.\r\n\r\n5. The Council to help the party leaders to organise public meetings,\r\nand circulate pamphlets.\r\n\r\n6. The Central Committee to allot a sum of money to be paid annually to\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\n7. The chief whip and the principal agent to have seats on the Council,\r\nand the chief whip to sit on all committees.\r\n\r\n8. If the chief whip thinks any action of the Union inconsistent with\r\nthe welfare of party, the matter to be referred to the leaders for\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n9. The leaders of the party to appoint one or two members of the Council\r\non the Central Committee.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed that this arrangement gave the leaders of the party\r\nmore formal power of control over the Union than ever.\r\n\r\n[553:1] The changes were the omission of Nos. 1 and 9; and that the\r\nchief whip should have merely a right to be present at all the\r\ncommittees, instead of being a member of them.\r\n\r\n[553:2] Mr. Winston Churchill (I., 324, 331) and Mr. Ostrogorski\r\nattribute a larger measure of success to Lord Randolph, but that opinion\r\nseems to me inconsistent with the correspondence, the reports of the\r\ncommittees and the proceedings of the Council, which are set forth in\r\nthe printed report laid before the next Conference.\r\n\r\n[555:1] Winston Churchill, \"Lord Randolph Churchill,\" I., 356-59.\r\n\r\n[555:2] _The Times_ of Oct. 27, 1886, p. 6, c. 3.\r\n\r\n[556:1] Mr. Winston Churchill's account of the occurrence is extremely\r\ninteresting; but the motives he attributes to his father do not seem\r\nwholly consistent with one another.\r\n\r\n[558:1] For workingmen's clubs with less than one hundred members the\r\nfee is only half as large.\r\n\r\n[558:2] The sums required for these offices are the same as when the\r\nUnion was originally formed. The subscriptions from associations go one\r\nhalf each to the National and divisional unions; those of individuals go\r\nwholly to the divisional union except in the case of life payments,\r\nwhich are made to the National Union, one half of the interest being\r\npaid over to the division.\r\n\r\n[558:3] To these the principal paid agent, or secretary, in each English\r\nor Welsh constituency was added in 1892. This has not been a matter of\r\nmuch importance, because few of them can afford to attend.\r\n\r\n[559:1] All the Conservative members of Parliament for constituencies in\r\nthe division were given the right to attend the annual meeting, and were\r\nmade members of the Council.\r\n\r\n[559:2] Rep. of the Council, October, 1886.\r\n\r\n[561:1] These were both passed in 1887 and at intervals thereafter.\r\n\r\n[562:1] _The Times_, Nov. 24, 1887.\r\n\r\n[562:2] _E.g._ Rep. of the Conference in October, 1886.\r\n\r\n[566:1] In the original plan these were to be chosen by the Council; but\r\nat the special Conference in July it was agreed that they should be\r\nelected at the annual Conference.\r\n\r\n[567:1] Under the new rules the Central Council--previously called\r\nsimply the Council--consists of the president and trustees of the\r\nNational Union; the chief whip and the principal agent of the party; one\r\nrepresentative for every fifty thousand voters, or fraction thereof, in\r\neach county, chosen at the meeting of the provincial division by the\r\ndelegates of the county thereat; one representative for every complete\r\ntwenty-five thousand voters in each parliamentary borough that contains\r\nso many, chosen by the central council of the borough; twenty-one\r\nmembers elected annually by the Conference; the chairman, honorary\r\nsecretary, and two representatives from the National Society of\r\nConservative Agents; one representative from each of the eight local\r\nassociations of Conservative agents; and two representatives apiece from\r\nthe Association of Conservative Clubs, the National Conservative League,\r\nand the United Club. The Council as thus enlarged contains nearly two\r\nhundred members.\r\n\r\n[568:1] Opinion on this question was by no means unanimous. One or two\r\ndivisions wanted to retain the former system on the score of economy,\r\nand the chief whip agreed to allow them to do so for a time.\r\n\r\n[568:2] Rule V.\r\n\r\n[568:3] By the new rules the Conference consists of the officers of the\r\nUnion, and the members of the Central Council; of the honorary members\r\nof the Union, who have, however, no vote; of the Conservative members of\r\nboth Houses of Parliament; of the officers of each provincial division;\r\nof the chairman, the paid agent, and three representatives of the\r\ncentral association in each constituency; of one representative for each\r\nsubscribing association or club; and of twenty representatives apiece\r\nfrom Scotland and Ireland.\r\n\r\n[569:1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Caucus is Largely a Sham.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Scotch National Union.]\r\n\r\nThe Union hitherto described covers England and Wales alone, although\r\nthe Scotch and Irish organisations are entitled to send to the\r\nConference twenty delegates apiece. North of the Tweed there is a\r\nseparate National Union of Conservative Associations for Scotland. It is\r\na copy of the English body, but except for the twenty delegates is\r\nentirely independent. It has a conference which adopts resolutions as\r\nineffective as those passed farther south. It has six territorial\r\ndivisions; but, owing to the fact that Scotland is in the main Liberal,\r\nseveral of these are not very vigorous, and do not raise money enough to\r\nhave councils of their own. All the divisions are very much under the\r\ncontrol of the Central Council of the Scotch Union, to which they send\r\ntheir reports for approval. They are, indeed, largely ornamental.\r\n\r\nBut if the National Union for Scotland is independent of the English\r\nUnion it is by no means free from the influence of the whip's office.\r\nThe party agent for Scotland, who has a right to attend--although\r\nwithout a vote--all meetings of the central and divisional councils and\r\ntheir committees, is appointed by the principal agent in London, and,\r\nlike the secretaries of the divisions in England, is practically his\r\nsubordinate. In this way the whip and the principal agent, acting\r\nthrough the agent for Scotland and the local agents, and fortified by\r\nsubsidies at election times, maintain a real control over the whole\r\nparty organisation throughout the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the Right Hon.

In the\r\nfirst place, he wishes to place on record an accurate narrative of some\r\nof the principal events which have occurred in Egypt and in the Soudan\r\nsince 1876; he has had access to all the documents in the Foreign\r\nOffices of both Cairo and London; and has been in close communication\r\nwith every one who has taken a leading part in Egyptian affairs during\r\nthe period of which he writes.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, he wishes to explain the results which have accrued\r\nto Egypt from the British occupation of the country in 1882. Such a\r\nshowing of tangible results of twenty-five years' experience renders the\r\nwork of tremendous value to any nation facing similar problems in her\r\nown dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe work is divided into the following seven parts: Part I, Ismail\r\nPasha, 1863-1879; Part II, The Arabi Revolt, August 1879 to August 1883;\r\nPart III, The Soudan, 1882-1907 (including the story of Gordon's journey\r\nto Khartoum, the Relief Expedition, and the Evacuation of the Soudan);\r\nPart IV, The Egyptian Puzzle; Part V, British Policy in Egypt; Part VI,\r\nThe Reforms; and Part VII, The Future of Egypt.\r\n\r\n     \"A record of practical and humane statesmanship for which it\r\n     would be hard to find an exact parallel.
