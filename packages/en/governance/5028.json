Arthur\r\nDecember 6, 1881\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:\r\n\r\nAn appalling calamity has befallen the American people since their chosen\r\nrepresentatives last met in the halls where you are now assembled. We might\r\nelse recall with unalloyed content the rare prosperity with which\r\nthroughout the year the nation has been blessed. Its harvests have been\r\nplenteous; its varied industries have thriven; the health of its people has\r\nbeen preserved; it has maintained with foreign governments the undisturbed\r\nrelations of amity and peace. For these manifestations of His favor we owe\r\nto Him who holds our destiny in His hands the tribute of our grateful\r\ndevotion.\r\n\r\nTo that mysterious exercise of His will which has taken from us the loved\r\nand illustrious citizen who was but lately the head of the nation we bow in\r\nsorrow and submission.\r\n\r\nThe memory of his exalted character, of his noble achievements, and of his\r\npatriotic life will be treasured forever as a sacred possession of the\r\nwhole people.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of his death drew from foreign governments and peoples\r\ntributes of sympathy and sorrow which history will record as signal tokens\r\nof the kinship of nations and the federation of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of good will between our own Government and that of Great\r\nBritain was never more marked than at present. In recognition of this\r\npleasing fact I directed, on the occasion of the late centennial\r\ncelebration at Yorktown, that a salute be given to the British flag.\r\n\r\nSave for the correspondence to which I shall refer hereafter in relation to\r\nthe proposed canal across the Isthmus of Panama, little has occurred worthy\r\nof mention in the diplomatic relations of the two countries.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year the Fortune Bay claims were satisfactorily settled by the\r\nBritish Government paying in full the sum of 15,000 pounds, most of which\r\nhas been already distributed. As the terms of the settlement included\r\ncompensation for injuries suffered by our fishermen at Aspee Bay, there has\r\nbeen retained from the gross award a sum which is deemed adequate for those\r\nclaims.\r\n\r\nThe participation of Americans in the exhibitions at Melbourne and Sydney\r\nwill be approvingly mentioned in the reports of the two exhibitions, soon\r\nto be presented to Congress. They will disclose the readiness of our\r\ncountrymen to make successful competition in distant fields of enterprise.\r\n\r\nNegotiations for an international copyright convention are in hopeful\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThe surrender of Sitting Bull and his forces upon the Canadian frontier has\r\nallayed apprehension, although bodies of British Indians still cross the\r\nborder in quest of sustenance. Upon this subject a correspondence has been\r\nopened which promises an adequate understanding. Our troops have orders to\r\navoid meanwhile all collisions with alien Indians.\r\n\r\nThe presence at the Yorktown celebration of representatives of the French\r\nRepublic and descendants of Lafayette and of his gallant compatriots who\r\nwere our allies in the Revolution has served to strengthen the spirit of\r\ngood will which has always existed between the two nations.\r\n\r\nYou will be furnished with the proceedings of the Bimetallic Conference\r\nheld during the summer at the city of Paris. No accord was reached, but a\r\nvaluable interchange of views was had, and the conference will next year be\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\nAt the Electrical Exhibition and Congress, also held at Paris, this country\r\nwas creditably represented by eminent specialists, who, in the absence of\r\nan appropriation, generously lent their efficient aid at the instance of\r\nthe State Department. While our exhibitors in this almost distinctively\r\nAmerican field of achievement have won several valuable awards, I recommend\r\nthat Congress provide for the repayment of the personal expenses incurred\r\nin the public interest by the honorary commissioners and delegates.\r\n\r\nNo new questions respecting the status of our naturalized citizens in\r\nGermany have arisen during the year, and the causes of complaint,\r\nespecially in Alsace and Lorraine, have practically ceased through the\r\nliberal action of the Imperial Government in accepting our often-expressed\r\nviews on the subject. The application of the treaty of 1868 to the lately\r\nacquired Rhenish provinces has received very earnest attention, and a\r\ndefinite and lasting agreement on this point is confidently expected. The\r\nparticipation of the descendants of Baron von Steuben in the Yorktown\r\nfestivities, and their subsequent reception by their American kinsmen,\r\nstrikingly evinced the ties of good will which unite the German people and\r\nour own.\r\n\r\nOur intercourse with Spain has been friendly. An agreement concluded in\r\nFebruary last fixes a term for the labors of the Spanish and American\r\nClaims Commission. The Spanish Government has been requested to pay the\r\nlate awards of that Commission, and will, it is believed, accede to the\r\nrequest as promptly and courteously as on former occasions.\r\n\r\nBy recent legislation onerous fines have been imposed upon American\r\nshipping in Spanish and colonial ports for slight irregularities in\r\nmanifests. One case of hardship is specially worthy of attention. The bark\r\nMasonic, bound for Japan, entered Manila in distress, and is there sought\r\nto be confiscated under Spanish revenue laws for an alleged shortage in her\r\ntransshipped cargo. Though efforts for her relief have thus far proved\r\nunavailing, it is expected that the whole matter will be adjusted in a\r\nfriendly spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Senate resolutions of condolence on the assassination of the Czar\r\nAlexander II were appropriately communicated to the Russian Government,\r\nwhich in turn has expressed its sympathy in our late national bereavement.\r\nIt is desirable that our cordial relations with Russia should be\r\nstrengthened by proper engagements assuring to peaceable Americans who\r\nvisit the Empire the consideration which is due to them as citizens of a\r\nfriendly state. This is especially needful with respect to American\r\nIsraelites, whose classification with the native Hebrews has evoked\r\nenergetic remonstrances from this Government.\r\n\r\nA supplementary consular agreement with Italy has been sanctioned and\r\nproclaimed, which puts at rest conflicts of jurisdiction in the case of\r\ncrimes on shipboard.\r\n\r\nSeveral important international conferences have been held in Italy during\r\nthe year. At the Geographical Congress of Venice, the Beneficence Congress\r\nof Milan, and the Hygienic Congress of Turin this country was represented\r\nby delegates from branches of the public service or by private citizens\r\nduly accredited in an honorary capacity. It is hoped that Congress will\r\ngive such prominence to the results of their participation as they may seem\r\nto deserve.\r\n\r\nThe abolition of all discriminating duties against such colonial\r\nproductions of the Dutch East Indies as are imported hither from Holland\r\nhas been already considered by Congress. I trust that at the present\r\nsession the matter may be favorably concluded.\r\n\r\nThe insecurity of life and property in many parts of Turkey has given rise\r\nto correspondence with the Porte looking particularly to the better\r\nprotection of American missionaries in the Empire. The condemned murderer\r\nof the eminent missionary Dr. Justin W. Parsons has not yet been executed,\r\nalthough this Government has repeatedly demanded that exemplary justice be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss Government has again solicited the good offices of our diplomatic\r\nand consular agents for the protection of its citizens in countries where\r\nit is not itself represented. This request has, within proper limits, been\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\nOur agents in Switzerland have been instructed to protest against the\r\nconduct of the authorities of certain communes in permitting the emigration\r\nto this country of criminals and other objectionable persons. Several such\r\npersons, through the cooperation of the commissioners of emigration at New\r\nYork, have been sent back by the steamers which brought them. A continuance\r\nof this course may prove a more effectual remedy than diplomatic\r\nremonstrance.\r\n\r\nTreaties of commerce and navigation and for the regulation of consular\r\nprivileges have been concluded with Roumania and Servia since their\r\nadmission into the family of European States.\r\n\r\nAs is natural with contiguous states having like institutions and like aims\r\nof advancement and development, the friendship of the United States and\r\nMexico has been constantly maintained. This Government has lost no occasion\r\nof encouraging the Mexican Government to a beneficial realization of the\r\nmutual advantages which will result from more intimate commercial\r\nintercourse and from the opening of the rich interior of Mexico to railway\r\nenterprise. I deem it important that means be provided to restrain the\r\nlawlessness unfortunately so common on the frontier and to suppress the\r\nforays of the reservation Indians on either side of the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nThe neighboring States of Central America have preserved internal peace,\r\nand their outward relations toward us have been those of intimate\r\nfriendship. There are encouraging signs of their growing disposition to\r\nsubordinate their local interests to those which are common to them by\r\nreason of their geographical relations.\r\n\r\nThe boundary dispute between Guatemala and Mexico has afforded this\r\nGovernment an opportunity to exercise its good offices for preventing a\r\nrupture between those States and for procuring a peaceable solution of the\r\nquestion. I cherish strong hope that in view of our relations of amity with\r\nboth countries our friendly counsels may prevail.\r\n\r\nA special envoy of Guatemala has brought to me the condolences of his\r\nGovernment and people on the death of President Garfield.\r\n\r\nThe Costa Rican Government lately framed an engagement with Colombia for\r\nsettling by arbitration the boundary question between those countries,\r\nproviding that the post of arbitrator should be offered successively to the\r\nKing of the Belgians, the King of Spain, and the President of the Argentine\r\nConfederation. The King of the Belgians has declined to act, but I am not\r\nas yet advised of the action of the King of Spain. As we have certain\r\ninterests in the disputed territory which are protected by our treaty\r\nengagements with one of the parties, it is important that the arbitration\r\nshould not without our consent affect our rights, and this Government has\r\naccordingly thought proper to make its views known to the parties to the\r\nagreement, as well as to intimate them to the Belgian and Spanish\r\nGovernments.\r\n\r\nThe questions growing out of the proposed interoceanic waterway across the\r\nIsthmus of Panama are of grave national importance. This Government has not\r\nbeen unmindful of the solemn obligations imposed upon it by its compact of\r\n1846 with Colombia, as the independent and sovereign mistress of the\r\nterritory crossed by the canal, and has sought to render them effective by\r\nfresh engagements with the Colombian Republic looking to their practical\r\nexecution. The negotiations to this end, after they had reached what\r\nappeared to be a mutually satisfactory solution here, were met in Colombia\r\nby a disavowal of the powers which its envoy had assumed and by a proposal\r\nfor renewed negotiation on a modified basis.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile this Government learned that Colombia had proposed to the\r\nEuropean powers to join in a guaranty of the neutrality of the proposed\r\nPanama canal--a guaranty which would be in direct contravention of our\r\nobligation as the sole guarantor of the integrity of Colombian territory\r\nand of the neutrality of the canal itself. My lamented predecessor felt it\r\nhis duty to place before the European powers the reasons which make the\r\nprior guaranty of the United States indispensable, and for which the\r\ninterjection of any foreign guaranty might be regarded as a superfluous and\r\nunfriendly act.\r\n\r\nForeseeing the probable reliance of the British Government on the\r\nprovisions of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty of 1850 as affording room for a\r\nshare in the guaranties which the United States covenanted with Colombia\r\nfour years before, I have not hesitated to supplement the action of my\r\npredecessor by proposing to Her Majesty's Government the modification of\r\nthat instrument and the abrogation of such clauses thereof as do not\r\ncomport with the obligations of the United States toward Colombia or with\r\nthe vital needs of the two friendly parties to the compact.\r\n\r\nThis Government sees with great concern the continuance of the hostile\r\nrelations between Chile, Bolivia, and Peru. An early peace between these\r\nRepublics is much to be desired, not only that they may themselves be\r\nspared further misery and bloodshed, but because their continued antagonism\r\nthreatens consequences which are, in my judgment, dangerous to the\r\ninterests of republican government on this continent and calculated to\r\ndestroy the best elements of our free and peaceful civilization.\r\n\r\nAs in the present excited condition of popular feeling in these countries\r\nthere has been serious misapprehension of the position of the United\r\nStates, and as separate diplomatic intercourse with each through\r\nindependent ministers is sometimes subject, owing to the want of prompt\r\nreciprocal communication, to temporary misunderstanding, I have deemed it\r\njudicious at the present time to send a special envoy accredited to all and\r\neach of them, and furnished with general instructions which will, I trust,\r\nenable him to bring these powers into friendly relations.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Venezuela maintains its attitude of warm friendship and\r\ncontinues with great regularity its payment of the monthly quota of the\r\ndiplomatic debt. Without suggesting the direction in which Congress should\r\nact, I ask its attention to the pending questions affecting the\r\ndistribution of the sums thus far received.\r\n\r\nThe relations between Venezuela and France growing out of the same debt\r\nhave been for some time past in an unsatisfactory state, and this\r\nGovernment, as the neighbor and one of the largest creditors of Venezuela,\r\nhas interposed its influence with the French Government with the view of\r\nproducing a friendly and honorable adjustment.\r\n\r\nI regret that the commercial interests between the United States and\r\nBrazil, from which great advantages were hoped a year ago, have suffered\r\nfrom the withdrawal of the American lines of communication between the\r\nBrazilian ports and our own.\r\n\r\nThrough the efforts of our minister resident at Buenos Ayres and the United\r\nStates minister at Santiago, a treaty has been concluded between the\r\nArgentine Republic and Chile, disposing of the long-pending Patagonian\r\nboundary question. It is a matter of congratulation that our Government has\r\nbeen afforded the opportunity of successfully exerting its good influence\r\nfor the prevention of disagreements between these Republics of the American\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nI am glad to inform you that the treaties lately negotiated with China have\r\nbeen duly ratified on both sides and the exchange made at Peking.\r\nLegislation is necessary to carry their provisions into effect. The prompt\r\nand friendly spirit with which the Chinese Government, at the request of\r\nthe United States, conceded the modification of existing treaties should\r\nsecure careful regard for the interests and susceptibilities of that\r\nGovernment in the enactment of any laws relating to Chinese immigration.\r\n\r\nThose clauses of the treaties which forbid the participation of citizens or\r\nvessels of the United States in the opium trade will doubtless receive your\r\napproval. They will attest the sincere interest which our people and\r\nGovernment feel in the commendable efforts of the Chinese Government to put\r\na stop to this demoralizing and destructive traffic.\r\n\r\nIn relation both to China and Japan some changes are desirable in our\r\npresent system of consular jurisdiction. I hope at some future time to lay\r\nbefore you a scheme for its improvement in the entire East.\r\n\r\nThe intimacy between our own country and Japan, the most advanced of the\r\nEastern nations, continues to be cordial. I am advised that the Emperor\r\ncontemplates the establishment of full constitutional government, and that\r\nhe has already summoned a parliamentary congress for the purpose of\r\neffecting the change. Such a remarkable step toward complete assimilation\r\nwith the Western system can not fail to bring Japan into closer and more\r\nbeneficial relationship with ourselves as the chief Pacific power.\r\n\r\nA question has arisen in relation to the exercise in that country of the\r\njudicial functions conferred upon our ministers and consuls. The\r\nindictment, trial, and conviction in the consular court at Yokohama of John\r\nRoss, a merchant seaman on board an American vessel, have made it necessary\r\nfor the Government to institute a careful examination into the nature and\r\nmethods of this jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that Ross was regularly shipped under the flag of the United\r\nStates, but was by birth a British subject. My predecessor felt it his duty\r\nto maintain the position that during his service as a regularly shipped\r\nseaman on board an American merchant vessel Ross was subject to the laws of\r\nthat service and to the jurisdiction of the United States consular\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nI renew the recommendation which has been heretofore urged by the Executive\r\nupon the attention of Congress, that after the deduction of such amount as\r\nmay be found due to American citizens the balance of the indemnity funds\r\nheretofore obtained from China and Japan, and which are now in the hands of\r\nthe State Department, be returned to the Governments of those countries.\r\n\r\nThe King of Hawaii, in the course of his homeward return after a journey\r\naround the world, has lately visited this country. While our relations with\r\nthat Kingdom are friendly, this Government has viewed with concern the\r\nefforts to seek replenishment of the diminishing population of the islands\r\nfrom outward sources, to a degree which may impair the native sovereignty\r\nand independence, in which the United States was among the first to testify\r\na lively interest.\r\n\r\nRelations of unimpaired amity have been maintained throughout the year with\r\nthe respective Governments of Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Denmark, Hayti,\r\nParaguay and Uruguay, Portugal, and Sweden and Norway. This may also be\r\nsaid of Greece and Ecuador, although our relations with those States have\r\nfor some years been severed by the withdrawal of appropriations for\r\ndiplomatic representatives at Athens and Quito. It seems expedient to\r\nrestore those missions, even on a reduced scale, and I decidedly recommend\r\nsuch a course with respect to Ecuador, which is likely within the near\r\nfuture to play an important part among the nations of the Southern\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nAt its last extra session the Senate called for the text of the Geneva\r\nconvention for the relief of the wounded in war. I trust that this action\r\nforeshadows such interest in the subject as will result in the adhesion of\r\nthe United States to that humane and commendable engagement.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to the propriety of adopting the new code of\r\ninternational rules for the prevention of collisions on the high seas and\r\nof conforming the domestic legislation of the United States thereto, so\r\nthat no confusion may arise from the application of conflicting rules in\r\nthe case of vessels of different nationalities meeting in tidal waters.\r\nThese international rules differ but slightly from our own. They have been\r\nadopted by the Navy Department for the governance of the war ships of the\r\nUnited States on the high seas and in foreign waters, and, through the\r\naction of the State Department in disseminating the rules and in\r\nacquainting shipmasters with the option of conforming to them without the\r\njurisdictional waters of the United States, they are now very generally\r\nknown and obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe State Department still continues to publish to the country the trade\r\nand manufacturing reports received from its officers abroad. The success of\r\nthis course warrants its continuance and such appropriation as may be\r\nrequired to meet the rapidly increasing demand for these publications. With\r\nspecial reference to the Atlanta Cotton Exposition, the October number of\r\nthe reports was devoted to a valuable collection of papers on the\r\ncotton-goods trade of the world.\r\n\r\nThe International Sanitary Conference for which, in 1879, Congress made\r\nprovision assembled in this city early in January last, and its sessions\r\nwere prolonged until March. Although it reached no specific conclusions\r\naffecting the future action of the participant powers, the interchange of\r\nviews proved to be most valuable. The full protocols of the sessions have\r\nbeen already presented to the Senate.\r\n\r\nAs pertinent to this general subject, I call your attention to the\r\noperations of the National Board of Health. Established by act of Congress\r\napproved March 3, 1879, its sphere of duty was enlarged by the act of June\r\n2 in the same year. By the last-named act the board was required to\r\ninstitute such measures as might be deemed necessary for preventing the\r\nintroduction of contagious or infectious diseases from foreign countries\r\ninto the United States or from one State into another.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the rules and regulations prepared by the board and\r\napproved by my predecessor has done much to arrest the progress of epidemic\r\ndisease, and has thus rendered substantial service to the nation.\r\n\r\nThe International Sanitary Conference, to which I have referred, adopted a\r\nform of a bill of health to be used by all vessels seeking to enter the\r\nports of the countries whose representatives participated in its\r\ndeliberations. This form has since been prescribed by the National Board of\r\nHealth and incorporated with its rules and regulations, which have been\r\napproved by me in pursuance of law.\r\n\r\nThe health of the people is of supreme importance. All measures looking to\r\ntheir protection against the spread of contagious diseases and to the\r\nincrease of our sanitary knowledge for such purposes deserve attention of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury presents in detail a highly\r\nsatisfactory exhibit of the state of the finances and the condition of the\r\nvarious branches of the public service administered by that Department.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ending June 30,\r\n1881, were:\r\n\r\nFrom customs - $198,159,676.02\r\n\r\nFrom internal revenue - 135,264,385.51\r\n\r\nFrom sales of public lands - 2,201,863.17\r\n\r\nFrom tax on circulation and deposits of national banks - 8,116,115.72\r\n\r\nFrom repayment of interest by Pacific Railway companies - 810,833.80\r\n\r\nFrom sinking fund for Pacific Railway companies - 805,180.54\r\n\r\nFrom customs fees, fines, penalties, etc. - 1,225,514.86\r\n\r\nFrom fees--consular, letters patent, and lands - 2,244,983.98\r\n\r\nFrom proceeds of sales of Government property - 262,174.00\r\n\r\nFrom profits on coinage - 3,468,485.61\r\n\r\nFrom revenues of the District of Columbia - 2,016,199.23\r\n\r\nFrom miscellaneous sources - 6,206,880.13\r\n\r\nTotal ordinary receipts - 360,782,292.57\r\n\r\nThe ordinary expenditures for the same period were:\r\n\r\nFor civil expenses - $17,941,177.19\r\n\r\nFor foreign intercourse - 1,093,954.92\r\n\r\nFor Indians - 6,514,161.09\r\n\r\nFor pensions - 50,059,279.62\r\n\r\nFor the military establishment, including river and harbor improvements\r\nand arsenals - 40,466,460.55\r\n\r\nFor the naval establishment, including vessels, machinery, and\r\nimprovements at navy-yards - 15,686,671.66\r\n\r\nFor miscellaneous expenditures, including public buildings,\r\nlight-houses, and collecting the revenue - 41,837,280.57\r\n\r\nFor expenditures on account of the District of Columbia - 3,543,912.03\r\n\r\nFor interest on the public debt - 82,508,741.18\r\n\r\nFor premium on bonds purchased - 1,061,248.78\r\n\r\nTotal ordinary expenditures - 260,712,887.59\r\n\r\nLeaving a surplus revenue of $100,069,404.98, which was applied as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nTo the redemption of--\r\n\r\nBonds for the sinking fund - $74,371,200.00\r\n\r\nFractional currency for the sinking fund - 109,001.05\r\n\r\nLoan of February, 1861 - 7,418,000.00\r\n\r\nTen-forties of 1864 - 2,016,150.00\r\n\r\nFive-twenties of 1862 - 18,300.00\r\n\r\nFive-twenties of 1864 - 3,400.00\r\n\r\nFive-twenties of 1865 - 37,300.00\r\n\r\nConsols of 1865 - 143,150.00\r\n\r\nConsols of 1867 - 959,150.00\r\n\r\nConsols of 1868 - 337,400.00\r\n\r\nTexan indemnity stock - 1,000.00\r\n\r\nOld demand, compound-interest, and other notes - 18,330.00\r\n\r\nAnd to the increase of cash in the Treasury - 14,637,023.93 -\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nChester A. Arthur\r\nDecember 4, 1882\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:\r\n\r\nIt is provided by the Constitution that the President shall from time to\r\ntime give to the Congress information of the state of the Union and\r\nrecommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary\r\nand expedient.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the events of the year which has elapsed since the\r\ncommencement of your sessions, I first call your attention to the\r\ngratifying condition of our foreign affairs. Our intercourse with other\r\npowers has continued to be of the most friendly character.\r\n\r\nSuch slight differences as have arisen during the year have been already\r\nsettled or are likely to reach an early adjustment. The arrest of citizens\r\nof the United States in Ireland under recent laws which owe their origin to\r\nthe disturbed condition of that country has led to a somewhat extended\r\ncorrespondence with the Government of Great Britain. A disposition to\r\nrespect our rights has been practically manifested by the release of the\r\narrested parties.\r\n\r\nThe claim of this nation in regard to the supervision and control of any\r\ninteroceanic canal across the American Isthmus has continued to be the\r\nsubject of conference.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that time will be more powerful than discussion in removing\r\nthe divergence between the two nations whose friendship is so closely\r\ncemented by the intimacy of their relations and the community of their\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nOur long-established friendliness with Russia has remained unshaken. It has\r\nprompted me to proffer the earnest counsels of this Government that\r\nmeasures be adopted for suppressing the proscription which the Hebrew race\r\nin that country has lately suffered. It has not transpired that any\r\nAmerican citizen has been subjected to arrest or injury, but our courteous\r\nremonstrance has nevertheless been courteously received. There is reason to\r\nbelieve that the time is not far distant when Russia will be able to secure\r\ntoleration to all faiths within her borders.\r\n\r\nAt an international convention held at Paris in 1880, and attended by\r\nrepresentatives of the United States, an agreement was reached in respect\r\nto the protection of trade-marks, patented articles, and the rights of\r\nmanufacturing firms and corporations. The formulating into treaties of the\r\nrecommendations thus adopted is receiving the attention which it merits.\r\n\r\nThe protection of submarine cables is a subject now under consideration by\r\nan international conference at Paris. Believing that it is clearly the true\r\npolicy of this Government to favor the neutralization of this means of\r\nintercourse, I requested our minister to France to attend the convention as\r\na delegate. I also designated two of our eminent scientists to attend as\r\nour representatives at the meeting of an international committee at Paris\r\nfor considering the adoption of a common unit to measure electric force.\r\n\r\nIn view of the frequent occurrence of conferences for the consideration of\r\nimportant matters of common interest to civilized nations, I respectfully\r\nsuggest that the Executive be invested by Congress with discretionary\r\npowers to send delegates to such conventions, and that provision be made to\r\ndefray the expenses incident thereto.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the United States and Spain as to the effect of a\r\njudgment and certificate of naturalization has not yet been adjusted, but\r\nit is hoped and believed that negotiations now in progress will result in\r\nthe establishment of the position which seems to this Government so\r\nreasonable and just.\r\n\r\nI have already called the attention of Congress to the fact that in the\r\nports of Spain and its colonies onerous fines have lately been imposed upon\r\nvessels of the United States for trivial technical offenses against local\r\nregulations. Efforts for the abatement of these exactions have thus far\r\nproved unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nI regret to inform you also that the fees demanded by Spanish consuls in\r\nAmerican ports are in some cases so large, when compared with the value of\r\nthe cargo, as to amount in effect to a considerable export duty, and that\r\nour remonstrances in this regard have not as yet received the attention\r\nwhich they seem to deserve.\r\n\r\nThe German Government has invited the United States to participate in an\r\ninternational exhibition of domestic cattle to be held at Hamburg in July,\r\n1883. If this country is to be represented, it is important that in the\r\nearly days of this session Congress should make a suitable appropriation\r\nfor that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe death of Mr. Marsh, our late minister to Italy, has evoked from that\r\nGovernment expressions of profound respect for his exalted character and\r\nfor his honorable career in the diplomatic service of his country. The\r\nItalian Government has raised a question as to the propriety of recognizing\r\nin his dual capacity the representative of this country recently accredited\r\nboth as secretary of legation and as consul-general at Rome. He has been\r\nreceived as secretary, but his exequatur as consul-general has thus far\r\nbeen withheld.\r\n\r\nThe extradition convention with Belgium, which has been in operation since\r\n1874, has been lately supplanted by another. The Senate has signified its\r\napproval, and ratifications have been duly exchanged between the\r\ncontracting countries. To the list of extraditable crimes has been added\r\nthat of the assassination or attempted assassination of the chief of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nNegotiations have been opened with Switzerland looking to a settlement by\r\ntreaty of the question whether its citizens can renounce their allegiance\r\nand become citizens of the United States without obtaining the consent of\r\nthe Swiss Government.\r\n\r\nI am glad to inform you that the immigration of paupers and criminals from\r\ncertain of the Cantons of Switzerland has substantially ceased and is no\r\nlonger sanctioned by the authorities.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of this subject prompts the suggestion that the act of\r\nAugust 3, 1882, which has for its object the return of foreign convicts to\r\ntheir own country, should be so modified as not to be open to the\r\ninterpretation that it affects the extradition of criminals on preferred\r\ncharges of crime.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Porte has not yet assented to the interpretation which this\r\nGovernment has put upon the treaty of 1830 relative to its jurisdictional\r\nrights in Turkey. It may well be, however, that this difference will be\r\nadjusted by a general revision of the system of jurisdiction of the United\r\nStates in the countries of the East, a subject to which your attention has\r\nbeen already called by the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of justice toward China and Japan, I trust that the\r\nquestion of the return of the indemnity fund to the Governments of those\r\ncountries will reach at the present session the satisfactory solution which\r\nI have already recommended, and which has recently been foreshadowed by\r\nCongressional discussion.\r\n\r\nThe treaty lately concluded with Korea awaits the action of the Senate.\r\nDuring the late disturbance in Egypt the timely presence of American\r\nvessels served as a protection to the persons and property of many of our\r\nown citizens and of citizens of other countries, whose governments have\r\nexpressed their thanks for this assistance.\r\n\r\nThe recent legislation restricting immigration of laborers from China has\r\ngiven rise to the question whether Chinese proceeding to or from another\r\ncountry may lawfully pass through our own.\r\n\r\nConstruing the act of May 6, 1882, in connection with the treaty of\r\nNovember 7, 1880, the restriction would seem to be limited to Chinese\r\nimmigrants coming to the United States as laborers, and would not forbid a\r\nmere transit across our territory. I ask the attention of Congress to the\r\nsubject, for such action, if any, as may be deemed advisable.\r\n\r\nThis Government has recently had occasion to manifest its interest in the\r\nRepublic of Liberia by seeking to aid the amicable settlement of the\r\nboundary dispute now pending between that Republic and the British\r\npossession of Sierra Leone.\r\n\r\nThe reciprocity treaty with Hawaii will become terminable after September\r\n9, 1883, on twelve months' notice by either party. While certain provisions\r\nof that compact may have proved onerous, its existence has fostered\r\ncommercial relations which it is important to preserve. I suggest,\r\ntherefore, that early consideration be given to such modifications of the\r\ntreaty as seem to be demanded by the interests of our people.\r\n\r\nIn view of our increasing trade with both Hayti and Santo Domingo, I advise\r\nthat provision be made for diplomatic intercourse with the latter by\r\nenlarging the scope of the mission at Port au Prince.\r\n\r\nI regret that certain claims of American citizens against the Government of\r\nHayti have thus far been urged unavailingly.\r\n\r\nA recent agreement with Mexico provides for the crossing of the frontier by\r\nthe armed forces of either country in pursuit of hostile Indians. In my\r\nmessage of last year I called attention to the prevalent lawlessness upon\r\nthe borders and to the necessity of legislation for its suppression. I\r\nagain invite the attention of Congress to the subject.\r\n\r\nA partial relief from these mischiefs has been sought in a convention,\r\nwhich now awaits the approval of the Senate, as does also another touching\r\nthe establishment of the international boundary between the United States\r\nand Mexico. If the latter is ratified, the action of Congress will be\r\nrequired for establishing suitable commissions of survey. The boundary\r\ndispute between Mexico and Guatemala, which led this Government to proffer\r\nits friendly counsels to both parties, has been amicably settled.\r\n\r\nNo change has occurred in our relations with Venezuela. I again invoke your\r\naction in the matter of the pending awards against that Republic, to which\r\nreference was made by a special message from the Executive at your last\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nAn invitation has been received from the Government of Venezuela to send\r\nrepresentatives in July, 1883, to Caracas for participating in the\r\ncentennial celebration of the birth of Bolivar, the founder of South\r\nAmerican independence. In connection with this event it is designed to\r\ncommence the erection at Caracas of a statue of Washington and to conduct\r\nan industrial exhibition which will be open to American products. I\r\nrecommend that the United States be represented and that suitable provision\r\nbe made therefor.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of the grade of our mission in Central America to the\r\nplenipotentiary rank, which was authorized by Congress at its late session,\r\nhas been since effected.\r\n\r\nThe war between Peru and Bolivia on the one side and Chile on the other\r\nbegan more than three years ago. On the occupation by Chile in 1880 of all\r\nthe littoral territory of Bolivia, negotiations for peace were conducted\r\nunder the direction of the United States. The allies refused to concede any\r\nterritory, but Chile has since become master of the whole coast of both\r\ncountries and of the capital of Peru. A year since, as you have already\r\nbeen advised by correspondence transmitted to you in January last, this\r\nGovernment sent a special mission to the belligerent powers to express the\r\nhope that Chile would be disposed to accept a money indemnity for the\r\nexpenses of the war and to relinquish her demand for a portion of the\r\nterritory of her antagonist.\r\n\r\nThis recommendation, which Chile declined to follow, this Government did\r\nnot assume to enforce; nor can it be enforced without resort to measures\r\nwhich would be in keeping neither with the temper of our people nor with\r\nthe spirit of our institutions.\r\n\r\nThe power of Peru no longer extends over its whole territory, and in the\r\nevent of our interference to dictate peace would need to be supplemented by\r\nthe armies and navies of the United States. Such interference would almost\r\ninevitably lead to the establishment of a protectorate--a result utterly at\r\nodds with our past policy, injurious to our present interests, and full of\r\nembarrassments for the future.\r\n\r\nFor effecting the termination of hostilities upon terms at once just to the\r\nvictorious nation and generous to its adversaries, this Government has\r\nspared no efforts save such as might involve the complications which I have\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nIt is greatly to be deplored that Chile seems resolved to exact such\r\nrigorous conditions of peace and indisposed to submit to arbitration the\r\nterms of an amicable settlement. No peace is likely to be lasting that is\r\nnot sufficiently equitable and just to command the approval of other\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nAbout a year since invitations were extended to the nations of this\r\ncontinent to send representatives to a peace congress to assemble at\r\nWashington in November, 1882. The time of meeting was fixed at a period\r\nthen remote, in the hope, as the invitation itself declared, that in the\r\nmeantime the disturbances between the South American Republics would be\r\nadjusted. As that expectation seemed unlikely to be realized, I asked in\r\nApril last for an expression of opinion from the two Houses of Congress as\r\nto the advisability of holding the proposed convention at the time\r\nappointed. This action was prompted in part by doubts which mature\r\nreflection had suggested whether the diplomatic usage and traditions of the\r\nGovernment did not make it fitting that the Executive should consult the\r\nrepresentatives of the people before pursuing a line of policy somewhat\r\nnovel in its character and far reaching in its possible consequences. In\r\nview of the fact that no action was taken by Congress in the premises and\r\nthat no provision had been made for necessary expenses, I subsequently\r\ndecided to postpone the convocation, and so notified the several\r\nGovernments which had been invited to attend.\r\n\r\nI am unwilling to dismiss this subject without assuring you of my support\r\nof any measures the wisdom of Congress may devise for the promotion of\r\npeace on this continent and throughout the world, and I trust that the time\r\nis nigh when, with the universal assent of civilized peoples, all\r\ninternational differences shall be determined without resort to arms by the\r\nbenignant processes of arbitration.\r\n\r\nChanges have occurred in the diplomatic representation of several foreign\r\npowers during the past year. New ministers from the Argentine Republic,\r\nAustria-Hungary, Brazil, Chile, China, France, Japan, Mexico, the\r\nNetherlands, and Russia have presented their credentials. The missions of\r\nDenmark and Venezuela at this capital have been raised in grade.\r\nSwitzerland has created a plenipotentiary mission to this Government, and\r\nan embassy from Madagascar and a minister from Siam will shortly arrive.\r\n\r\nOur diplomatic intercourse has been enlarged by the establishment of\r\nrelations with the new Kingdom of Servia, by the creation of a mission to\r\nSiam, and by the restoration of the mission to Greece. The Shah of Persia\r\nhas expressed his gratification that a charge d'affaires will shortly be\r\nsent to that country, where the rights of our citizens have been hitherto\r\ncourteously guarded by the representatives of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nI renew my recommendation of such legislation as will place the United\r\nStates in harmony with other maritime powers with respect to the\r\ninternational rules for the prevention of collisions at sea.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with your joint resolution of the 3d of August last, I have\r\ndirected the Secretary of State to address foreign governments in respect\r\nto a proposed conference for considering the subject of the universal\r\nadoption of a common prime meridian to be used in the reckoning of\r\nlongitude and in the regulation of time throughout the civilized world.\r\nTheir replies will in due time be laid before you.\r\n\r\nAn agreement was reached at Paris in 1875 between the principal powers for\r\nthe interchange of official publications through the medium of their\r\nrespective foreign departments.\r\n\r\nThe admirable system which has been built up by the enterprise of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution affords a practical basis for our cooperation in\r\nthis scheme, and an arrangement has been effected by which that institution\r\nwill perform the necessary labor, under the direction of the Department of\r\nState. A reasonable compensation therefor should be provided by law.\r\n\r\nA clause in the act making appropriations for the diplomatic and consular\r\nservice contemplates the reorganization of both branches of such service on\r\na salaried basis, leaving fees to inure to the benefit of the Treasury. I\r\ncordially favor such a project, as likely to correct abuses in the present\r\nsystem. The Secretary of State will present to you at an early day a plan\r\nfor such reorganization.\r\n\r\nA full and interesting exhibit of the operations of the Treasury Department\r\nis afforded by the report of the Secretary.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year\r\nended June 30, 1882, were as follows:\r\n\r\nFrom customs - $220,410,730.25\r\n\r\nFrom internal revenue - 146,497,595.45\r\n\r\nFrom sales of public lands - 4,753,140.37\r\n\r\nFrom tax on circulation and deposits of national banks - 8,956,794.45\r\n\r\nFrom repayment of interest by Pacific Railway companies - 840,554.37\r\n\r\nFrom sinking fund for Pacific Railway companies - 796,271.42\r\n\r\nFrom customs fees, fines, penalties, etc. - 1,343,348.00\r\n\r\nFrom fees--consular, letters patent, and lands - 2,638,990.97\r\n\r\nFrom proceeds of sales of Government property - 314,959.85\r\n\r\nFrom profits on coinage, bullion deposits, and assays - 4,116,693.73\r\n\r\nFrom Indian trust funds - 5,705,243.22\r\n\r\nFrom deposits by individuals for surveying public lands - 2,052,306.36\r\n\r\nFrom revenues of the District of Columbia - 1,715,176.41\r\n\r\nFrom miscellaneous sources - 3,383,445.43\r\n\r\nTotal ordinary receipts - 403,525,250.28\r\n\r\nThe ordinary expenditures for the same period were--\r\n\r\nFor civil expenses - $18,042,386.42\r\n\r\nFor foreign intercourse - 1,307,583.19\r\n\r\nFor Indians - 9,736,747.40\r\n\r\nFor pensions - 61,345,193.95\r\n\r\nFor the military establishment, including river and harbor improvements,\r\nand arsenals - 43,570,494.19\r\n\r\nFor the naval establishment, including vessels, machinery, and\r\nimprovements at navy-yards - 15,032,046.26\r\n\r\nFor miscellaneous expenditures, including public buildings, light-houses,\r\nand collecting the revenue - 34,539,237.50\r\n\r\nFor expenditures on account of the District of Columbia - 3,330,543.87\r\n\r\nFor interest on the public debt - 71,077,206.79\r\n\r\nTotal ordinary expenditures - 257,981,439.57\r\n\r\nLeaving a surplus revenue of $145,543,810.71, which, with an amount drawn\r\nfrom the cash balance in the Treasury of $20,737,694.84, making\r\n$166,281,505.55, was applied to the redemption--\r\n\r\nOf bonds for the sinking fund - $60,079,150.00\r\n\r\nOf fractional currency for the sinking fund - 58,705.55\r\n\r\nOf loan of July and August, 1861 - 62,572,050.00\r\n\r\nOf loan of March, 1863 - 4,472,900.00\r\n\r\nOf funded loan of 1881 - 37,194,450.00\r\n\r\nOf loan of 1858 - 303,000.00\r\n\r\nOf loan of February, 1861 - 1,000.00\r\n\r\nOf five-twenties of 1862 - 2,100.00\r\n\r\nOf five-twenties of 1864 - 7,400.00\r\n\r\nOf five-twenties of 1865 - 6,500.00\r\n\r\nOf ten-forties of 1864 - 254,550.00\r\n\r\nOf consols of 1865 - 86,450.00\r\n\r\nOf consols of 1867 - 408,250.00\r\n\r\nOf consols of 1868 - 141,400.00\r\n\r\nOf Oregon War debt - 675,250.00\r\n\r\nOf old demand, compound-interest, and other notes - 18,350.00 -\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nChester A. Arthur\r\nDecember 4, 1883\r\n\r\nTo the Congress of the United States:\r\n\r\nAt the threshold of your deliberations I congratulate you upon the\r\nfavorable aspect of the domestic and foreign affairs of this Government.\r\n\r\nOur relations with other countries continue to be upon a friendly footing.\r\nWith the Argentine Republic, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Hayti,\r\nItaly, Santo Domingo, and Sweden and Norway no incident has occurred which\r\ncalls for special comment. The recent opening of new lines of telegraphic\r\ncommunication with Central America and Brazil permitted the interchange of\r\nmessages of friendship with the Governments of those countries.\r\n\r\nDuring the year there have been perfected and proclaimed consular and\r\ncommercial treaties with Servia and a consular treaty with Roumania, thus\r\nextending our intercourse with the Danubian countries, while our Eastern\r\nrelations have been put upon a wider basis by treaties with Korea and\r\nMadagascar. The new boundary-survey treaty with Mexico, a trade-marks\r\nconvention and a supplementary treaty of extradition with Spain, and\r\nconventions extending the duration of the Franco-American Claims Commission\r\nhave also been proclaimed.\r\n\r\nNotice of the termination of the fisheries articles of the treaty of\r\nWashington was duly given to the British Government, and the reciprocal\r\nprivileges and exemptions of the treaty will accordingly cease on July 1,\r\n1885. The fisheries industries, pursued by a numerous class of our citizens\r\non the northern coasts, both of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, are worthy\r\nof the fostering care of Congress. Whenever brought into competition with\r\nthe like industries of other countries, our fishermen, as well as our\r\nmanufacturers of fishing appliances and preparers of fish products, have\r\nmaintained a foremost place. I suggest that Congress create a commission to\r\nconsider the general question of our rights in the fisheries and the means\r\nof opening to our citizens, under just and enduring conditions, the richly\r\nstocked fishing waters and sealing grounds of British North America.\r\n\r\nQuestion has arisen touching the deportation to the United States from the\r\nBritish Islands, by governmental or municipal aid, of persons unable there\r\nto gain a living and equally a burden on the community here. Such of these\r\npersons as fall under the pauper class as defined by law have been sent\r\nback in accordance with the provisions of our statutes. Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment has insisted that precautions have been taken before shipment to\r\nprevent these objectionable visitors from coming hither without guaranty of\r\nsupport by their relatives in this country. The action of the British\r\nauthorities in applying measures for relief has, however, in so many cases\r\nproved ineffectual, and especially so in certain recent instances of needy\r\nemigrants reaching our territory through Canada, that a revision of our\r\nlegislation upon this subject may be deemed advisable.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence relative to the Clayton-Bulwer treaty has been continued and\r\nwill be laid before Congress.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of France against the importation of prepared swine\r\nproducts from the United States has been repealed. That result is due no\r\nless to the friendly representations of this Government than to a growing\r\nconviction in France that the restriction was not demanded by any real\r\ndanger to health.\r\n\r\nGermany still prohibits the introduction of all swine products from\r\nAmerica. I extended to the Imperial Government a friendly invitation to\r\nsend experts to the United States to inquire whether the use of those\r\nproducts was dangerous to health. This invitation was declined. I have\r\nbelieved it of such importance, however, that the exact facts should be\r\nascertained and promulgated that I have appointed a competent commission to\r\nmake a thorough investigation of the subject. Its members have shown their\r\npublic spirit by accepting their trust without pledge of compensation, but\r\nI trust that Congress will see in the national and international bearings\r\nof the matter a sufficient motive for providing at least for reimbursement\r\nof such expenses as they may necessarily incur.\r\n\r\nThe coronation of the Czar at Moscow afforded to this Government an\r\noccasion for testifying its continued friendship by sending a special envoy\r\nand a representative of the Navy to attend the ceremony.\r\n\r\nWhile there have arisen during the year no grave questions affecting the\r\nstatus in the Russian Empire of American citizens of other faith than that\r\nheld by the national church, this Government remains firm in its conviction\r\nthat the rights of its citizens abroad should be in no wise affected by\r\ntheir religious belief.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that measures for the removal of the restrictions which\r\nnow burden our trade with Cuba and Puerto Rico are under consideration by\r\nthe Spanish Government.\r\n\r\nThe proximity of Cuba to the United States and the peculiar methods of\r\nadministration which there prevail necessitate constant discussion and\r\nappeal on our part from the proceedings of the insular authorities. I\r\nregret to say that the just protests of this Government have not as yet\r\nproduced satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nThe commission appointed to decide certain claims of our citizens against\r\nthe Spanish Government, after the recognition of a satisfactory rule as to\r\nthe validity and force of naturalization in the United States, has finally\r\nadjourned. Some of its awards, though made more than two years ago, have\r\nnot yet been paid. Their speedy payment is expected.\r\n\r\nClaims to a large amount which were held by the late commission to be\r\nwithout its jurisdiction have been diplomatically presented to the Spanish\r\nGovernment. As the action of the colonial authorities which has given rise\r\nto these claims was admittedly illegal, full reparation for the injury\r\nsustained by our citizens should be no longer delayed.\r\n\r\nThe case of the Masonic has not yet reached a settlement. Manila court has\r\nfound that the proceedings of which this Government has complained were\r\nunauthorized, and it is hoped that the Government of Spain will not\r\nwithhold the speedy reparation which its sense of justice should impel it\r\nto offer for the unusual severity and unjust action of its subordinate\r\ncolonial officers in the case of this vessel.\r\n\r\nThe Helvetian Confederation has proposed the inauguration of a class of\r\ninternational treaties for the referment to arbitration of grave questions\r\nbetween nations. This Government has assented to the proposed negotiation\r\nof such a treaty with Switzerland.\r\n\r\nUnder the treaty of Berlin liberty of conscience and civil rights are\r\nassured to all strangers in Bulgaria. As the United States have no distinct\r\nconventional relations with that country and are not a party to the treaty,\r\nthey should, in my opinion, maintain diplomatic representation at Sofia for\r\nthe improvement of intercourse and the proper protection of the many\r\nAmerican citizens who resort to that country as missionaries and teachers.\r\nI suggest that I be given authority to establish an agency and\r\nconsulate-general at the Bulgarian capital.\r\n\r\nThe United States are now participating in a revision of the tariffs of the\r\nOttoman Empire. They have assented to the application of a license tax to\r\nforeigners doing business in Turkey, but have opposed the oppressive\r\nstorage tax upon petroleum entering the ports of that country.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the Khedive has proposed that the authority of the mixed\r\njudicial tribunals in Egypt be extended so as to cover citizens of the\r\nUnited States accused of crime, who are now triable before consular courts.\r\nThis Government is not indisposed to accept the change, but believes that\r\nits terms should be submitted for criticism to the commission appointed to\r\nrevise the whole subject.\r\n\r\nAt no time in our national history has there been more manifest need of\r\nclose and lasting relations with a neighboring state than now exists with\r\nrespect to Mexico. The rapid influx of our capital and enterprise into that\r\ncountry shows, by what has already been accomplished, the vast reciprocal\r\nadvantages which must attend the progress of its internal development. The\r\ntreaty of commerce and navigation of 1848 has been terminated by the\r\nMexican Government, and in the absence of conventional engagements the\r\nrights of our citizens in Mexico now depend upon the domestic statutes of\r\nthat Republic. There have been instances of harsh enforcement of the laws\r\nagainst our vessels and citizens in Mexico and of denial of the diplomatic\r\nresort for their protection. The initial step toward a better understanding\r\nhas been taken in the negotiation by the commission authorized by Congress\r\nof a treaty which is still before the Senate awaiting its approval.\r\n\r\nThe provisions for the reciprocal crossing of the frontier by the troops in\r\npursuit of hostile Indians have been prolonged for another year. The\r\noperations of the forces of both Governments against these savages have\r\nbeen successful, and several of their most dangerous bands have been\r\ncaptured or dispersed by the skill and valor of United States and Mexican\r\nsoldiers fighting in a common cause.\r\n\r\nThe convention for the resurvey of the boundary from the Rio Grande to the\r\nPacific having been ratified and exchanged, the preliminary reconnoissance\r\ntherein stipulated has been effected. It now rests with Congress to make\r\nprovision for completing the survey and relocating the boundary monuments.\r\n\r\nA convention was signed with Mexico on July 13, 1882, providing for the\r\nrehearing of the cases of Benjamin Well and the Abra Silver Mining Company,\r\nin whose favor awards were made by the late American and Mexican Claims\r\nCommission. That convention still awaits the consent of the Senate.\r\nMeanwhile, because of those charges of fraudulent awards which have made a\r\nnew commission necessary, the Executive has directed the suspension of\r\npayments of the distributive quota received from Mexico.\r\n\r\nOur geographical proximity to Central America and our political and\r\ncommercial relations with the States of that country justify, in my\r\njudgment, such a material increase of our consular corps as will place at\r\neach capital a consul-general.\r\n\r\nThe contest between Bolivia, Chile, and Peru has passed from the stage of\r\nstrategic hostilities to that of negotiation, in which the counsels of this\r\nGovernment have been exercised. The demands of Chile for absolute cession\r\nof territory have been maintained and accepted by the party of General\r\nIglesias to the extent of concluding a treaty of peace with the Government\r\nof Chile in general conformity with the terms of the protocol signed in May\r\nlast between the Chilean commander and General Iglesias. As a result of the\r\nconclusion of this treaty General Iglesias has been formally recognized by\r\nChile as President of Peru and his government installed at Lima, which has\r\nbeen evacuated by the Chileans. A call has been issued by General Iglesias\r\nfor a representative assembly, to be elected on the 13th of January, and to\r\nmeet at Lima on the 1st of March next. Meanwhile the provisional government\r\nof General Iglesias has applied for recognition to the principal powers of\r\nAmerica and Europe. When the will of the Peruvian people shall be\r\nmanifested, I shall not hesitate to recognize the government approved by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic and naval representatives of this Government attended at Caracas\r\nthe centennial celebration of the birth of the illustrious Bolivar. At the\r\nsame time the inauguration of the statue of Washington in the Venezuelan\r\ncapital testified to the veneration in which his memory is there held.\r\n\r\nCongress at its last session authorized the Executive to propose to\r\nVenezuela a reopening of the awards of the mixed commission of Caracas. The\r\ndeparture from this country of the Venezuelan minister has delayed the\r\nopening of negotiations for reviving the commission. This Government holds\r\nthat until the establishment of a treaty upon this subject the Venezuelan\r\nGovernment must continue to make the payments provided for in the\r\nconvention of 1866.\r\n\r\nThere is ground for believing that the dispute growing out of the unpaid\r\nobligations due from Venezuela to France will be satisfactorily adjusted.\r\nThe French cabinet has proposed a basis of settlement which meets my\r\napproval, but as it involves a recasting of the annual quotas of the\r\nforeign debt it has been deemed advisable to submit the proposal to the\r\njudgment of the cabinets of Berlin, Copenhagen, The Hague, London, and\r\nMadrid.\r\n\r\nAt the recent coronation of His Majesty King Kalakaua this Government was\r\nrepresented both diplomatically and by the formal visit of a vessel of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe question of terminating or modifying the existing reciprocity treaty\r\nwith Hawaii is now before Congress. I am convinced that the charges of\r\nabuses and frauds under that treaty have been exaggerated, and I renew the\r\nsuggestion of last year's message that the treaty be modified wherever its\r\nprovisions have proved onerous to legitimate trade between the two\r\ncountries. I am not disposed to favor the entire cessation of the treaty\r\nrelations which have fostered good will between the countries and\r\ncontributed toward the equality of Hawaii in the family of nations.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the policy declared by this Government of extending our\r\nintercourse with the Eastern nations, legations have during the past year\r\nbeen established in Persia, Siam, and Korea. It is probable that permanent\r\nmissions of those countries will ere long be maintained in the United\r\nStates. A special embassy from Siam is now on its way hither.\r\n\r\nTreaty relations with Korea were perfected by the exchange at Seoul, on the\r\n19th of May last, of the ratifications of the lately concluded convention,\r\nand envoys from the King of Chosen have visited this country and\r\nreceived a cordial welcome. Korea, as yet unacquainted with the methods of\r\nWestern civilization, now invites the attention of those interested in the\r\nadvancement of our foreign trade, as it needs the implements and products\r\nwhich the United States are ready to supply. We seek no monopoly of its\r\ncommerce and no advantages over other nations, but as the Chosenese, in\r\nreaching for a higher civilization, have confided in this Republic, we can\r\nnot regard with indifference any encroachment on their rights.\r\n\r\nChina, by the payment of a money indemnity, has settled certain of the\r\nlong-pending claims of our citizens, and I have strong hopes that the\r\nremainder will soon be adjusted.\r\n\r\nQuestions have arisen touching the rights of American and other foreign\r\nmanufacturers in China under the provisions of treaties which permit aliens\r\nto exercise their industries in that country. On this specific point our\r\nown treaty is silent, but under the operation of the most-favored-nation\r\nclause we have like privileges with those of other powers. While it is the\r\nduty of the Government to see that our citizens have the full enjoyment of\r\nevery benefit secured by treaty, I doubt the expediency of leading in a\r\nmovement to constrain China to admit an interpretation which we have only\r\nan indirect treaty right to exact. The transference to China of American\r\ncapital for the employment there of Chinese labor would in effect\r\ninaugurate a competition for the control of markets now supplied by our\r\nhome industries.\r\n\r\nThere is good reason to believe that the law restricting the immigration of\r\nChinese has been violated, intentionally or otherwise, by the officials of\r\nChina upon whom is devolved the duty of certifying that the immigrants\r\nbelong to the excepted classes.\r\n\r\nMeasures have been taken to ascertain the facts incident to this supposed\r\ninfraction, and it is believed that the Government of China will cooperate\r\nwith the United States in securing the faithful observance of the law.\r\n\r\nThe same considerations which prompted Congress at its last session to\r\nreturn to Japan the Simonoseki indemnity seem to me to require at its hands\r\nlike action in respect to the Canton indemnity fund, now amounting to\r\n$300,000.\r\n\r\nThe question of the general revision of the foreign treaties of Japan has\r\nbeen considered in an international conference held at Tokyo, but without\r\ndefinite result as yet. This Government is disposed to concede the requests\r\nof Japan to determine its own tariff duties, to provide such proper\r\njudicial tribunals as may commend themselves to the Western powers for the\r\ntrial of causes to which foreigners are parties, and to assimilate the\r\nterms and duration of its treaties to those of other civilized states.\r\n\r\nThrough our ministers at London and at Monrovia this Government has\r\nendeavored to aid Liberia in its differences with Great Britain touching\r\nthe northwestern boundary of that Republic. There is a prospect of\r\nadjustment of the dispute by the adoption of the Mannah River as the line.\r\nThis arrangement is a compromise of the conflicting territorial claims and\r\ntakes from Liberia no country over which it has maintained effective\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe rich and populous valley of the Kongo is being opened to commerce by a\r\nsociety called the International African Association, of which the King of\r\nthe Belgians is the president and a citizen of the United States the chief\r\nexecutive officer. Large tracts of territory have been ceded to the\r\nassociation by native chiefs, roads have been opened, steamboats placed on\r\nthe river, and the nuclei of states established at twenty-two stations\r\nunder one flag which offers freedom to commerce and prohibits the slave\r\ntrade. The objects of the society are philanthropic. It does not aim at\r\npermanent political control, but seeks the neutrality of the valley. The\r\nUnited States can not be indifferent to this work nor to the interests of\r\ntheir citizens involved in it. It may become advisable for us to cooperate\r\nwith other commercial powers in promoting the rights of trade and residence\r\nin the Kongo Valley free from the interference or political control of any\r\none nation.\r\n\r\nIn view of the frequency of invitations from foreign governments to\r\nparticipate in social and scientific congresses for the discussion of\r\nimportant matters of general concern, I repeat the suggestion of my last\r\nmessage that provision be made for the exercise of discretionary power by\r\nthe Executive in appointing delegates to such convocations. Able\r\nspecialists are ready to serve the national interests in such capacity\r\nwithout personal profit or other compensation than the defrayment of\r\nexpenses actually incurred, and this a comparatively small annual\r\nappropriation would suffice to meet.\r\n\r\nI have alluded in my previous messages to the injurious and vexatious\r\nrestrictions suffered by our trade in the Spanish West Indies. Brazil,\r\nwhose natural outlet for its great national staple, coffee, is in and\r\nthrough the United States, imposes a heavy export duty upon that product.\r\nOur petroleum exports are hampered in Turkey and in other Eastern ports by\r\nrestrictions as to storage and by onerous taxation. For these mischiefs\r\nadequate relief is not always afforded by reciprocity treaties like that\r\nwith Hawaii or that lately negotiated with Mexico and now awaiting the\r\naction of the Senate. Is it not advisable to provide some measure of\r\nequitable retaliation in our relations with governments which discriminate\r\nagainst our own? If, for example, the Executive were empowered to apply to\r\nSpanish vessels and cargoes from Cuba and Puerto Rico the same rules of\r\ntreatment and scale of penalties for technical faults which are applied to\r\nour vessels and cargoes in the Antilles, a resort to that course might not\r\nbe barren of good results.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury gives a full and interesting\r\nexhibit of the financial condition of the country.\r\n\r\nIt shows that the ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year\r\nended June 30, 1883, amounted to $398,287,581.95, whereof there was\r\nreceived--\r\n\r\nFrom customs -

Arthur\r\nDecember 1, 1884\r\n\r\nTo the Congress of the United States:\r\n\r\nSince the close of your last session the American people, in the exercise\r\nof their highest right of suffrage, have chosen their Chief Magistrate for\r\nthe four years ensuing.\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that at no period in the country's history has the\r\nlong political contest which customarily precedes the day of the national\r\nelection been waged with greater fervor and intensity, it is a subject of\r\ngeneral congratulation that after the controversy at the polls was over,\r\nand while the slight preponderance by which the issue had been determined\r\nwas as yet unascertained, the public peace suffered no disturbance, but the\r\npeople everywhere patiently and quietly awaited the result.\r\n\r\nNothing could more strikingly illustrate the temper of the American\r\ncitizen, his love of order, and his loyalty to law. Nothing could more\r\nsignally demonstrate the strength and wisdom of our political\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nEight years have passed since a controversy concerning the result of a\r\nnational election sharply called the attention of the Congress to the\r\nnecessity of providing more precise and definite regulations for counting\r\nthe electoral vote.\r\n\r\nIt is of the gravest importance that this question be solved before\r\nconflicting claims to the Presidency shall again distract the country, and\r\nI am persuaded that by the people at large any of the measures of relief\r\nthus far proposed would be preferred to continued inaction.\r\n\r\nOur relations with all foreign powers continue to be amicable.\r\n\r\nWith Belgium a convention has been signed whereby the scope of present\r\ntreaties has been so enlarged as to secure to citizens of either country\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the other equal rights and privileges in the\r\nacquisition and alienation of property. A trade-marks treaty has also been\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\nThe war between Chile and Peru is at an end. For the arbitration of the\r\nclaims of American citizens who during its continuance suffered through the\r\nacts of the Chilean authorities a convention will soon be negotiated.\r\n\r\nThe state of hostilities between France and China continues to be an\r\nembarrassing feature of our Eastern relations. The Chinese Government has\r\npromptly adjusted and paid the claims of American citizens whose property\r\nwas destroyed in the recent riots at Canton. I renew the recommendation of\r\nmy last annual message, that the Canton indemnity fund be returned to\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nThe true interpretation of the recent treaty with that country permitting\r\nthe restriction of Chinese immigration is likely to be again the subject of\r\nyour deliberations. It may be seriously questioned whether the statute\r\npassed at the last session does not violate the treaty rights of certain\r\nChinese who left this country with return certificates valid under the old\r\nlaw, and who now seem to be debarred from relanding for lack of the\r\ncertificates required by the new.\r\n\r\nThe recent purchase by citizens of the United States of a large trading\r\nfleet heretofore under the Chinese flag has considerably enhanced our\r\ncommercial importance in the East. In view of the large number of vessels\r\nbuilt or purchased by American citizens in other countries and exclusively\r\nemployed in legitimate traffic between foreign ports under the recognized\r\nprotection of our flag, it might be well to provide a uniform rule for\r\ntheir registration and documentation, so that the bona fide property rights\r\nof our citizens therein shall be duly evidenced and properly guarded.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the advice of the Senate at the last session, I recognized the\r\nflag of the International Association of the Kongo as that of a friendly\r\ngovernment, avoiding in so doing any prejudgment of conflicting territorial\r\nclaims in that region. Subsequently, in execution of the expressed wish of\r\nthe Congress, I appointed a commercial agent for the Kongo basin.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the rich prospective trade of the Kongo Valley has led to\r\nthe general conviction that it should be open to all nations upon equal\r\nterms. At an international conference for the consideration of this subject\r\ncalled by the Emperor of Germany, and now in session at Berlin, delegates\r\nare in attendance on behalf of the United States. Of the results of the\r\nconference you will be duly advised.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Korea has generously aided the efforts of the United\r\nStates minister to secure suitable premises for the use of the legation. As\r\nthe conditions of diplomatic intercourse with Eastern nations demand that\r\nthe legation premises be owned by the represented power, I advise that an\r\nappropriation be made for the acquisition of this property by the\r\nGovernment. The United States already possess valuable premises at Tangier\r\nas a gift from the Sultan of Morocco. As is stated hereafter, they have\r\nlately received a similar gift from the Siamese Government. The Government\r\nof Japan stands ready to present to us extensive grounds at Tokyo whereon\r\nto erect a suitable building for the legation, court-house, and jail, and\r\nsimilar privileges can probably be secured in China and Persia. The owning\r\nof such premises would not only effect a large saving of the present\r\nrentals, but would permit of the due assertion of extraterritorial rights\r\nin those countries, and would the better serve to maintain the dignity of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe failure of Congress to make appropriation for our representation at the\r\nautonomous court of the Khedive has proved a serious embarrassment in our\r\nintercourse with Egypt; and in view of the necessary intimacy of diplomatic\r\nrelationship due to the participation of this Government as one of the\r\ntreaty powers in all matters of administration there affecting the rights\r\nof foreigners, I advise the restoration of the agency and consulate-general\r\nat Cairo on its former basis. I do not conceive it to be the wish of\r\nCongress that the United States should withdraw altogether from the\r\nhonorable position they have hitherto held with respect to the Khedive, or\r\nthat citizens of this Republic residing or sojourning in Egypt should\r\nhereafter be without the aid and protection of a competent representative.\r\n\r\nWith France the traditional cordial relationship continues. The colossal\r\nstatue of Liberty Enlightening the World, the generous gift of the people\r\nof France, is expected to reach New York in May next. I suggest that\r\nCongressional action be taken in recognition of the spirit which has\r\nprompted this gift and in aid of the timely completion of the pedestal upon\r\nwhich it is to be placed.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Germany, a country which contributes to our own some of\r\nthe best elements of citizenship, continue to be cordial. The United States\r\nhave extradition treaties with several of the German States, but by reason\r\nof the confederation of those States under the imperial rule the\r\napplication of such treaties is not as uniform and comprehensive as the\r\ninterests of the two countries require. I propose, therefore, to open\r\nnegotiations for a single convention of extradition to embrace all the\r\nterritory of the Empire.\r\n\r\nIt affords me pleasure to say that our intercourse with Great Britain\r\ncontinues to be of a most friendly character.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Hawaii has indicated its willingness to continue for\r\nseven years the provisions of the existing reciprocity treaty. Such\r\ncontinuance, in view of the relations of that country to the American\r\nsystem of States, should, in my judgment, be favored.\r\n\r\nThe revolution in Hayti against the established Government has terminated.\r\nWhile it was in progress it became necessary to enforce our neutrality laws\r\nby instituting proceedings against individuals and vessels charged with\r\ntheir infringement. These prosecutions were in all cases successful.\r\n\r\nMuch anxiety has lately been displayed by various European Governments, and\r\nespecially by the Government of Italy, for the abolition of our import\r\nduties upon works of art. It is well to consider whether the present\r\ndiscrimination in favor of the productions of American artists abroad is\r\nnot likely to result, as they themselves seem very generally to believe it\r\nmay, in the practical exclusion of our painters and sculptors from the rich\r\nfields for observation, study, and labor which they have hitherto enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThere is prospect that the long-pending revision of the foreign treaties of\r\nJapan may be concluded at a new conference to be held at Tokyo. While this\r\nGovernment fully recognizes the equal and independent station of Japan in\r\nthe community of nations, it would not oppose the general adoption of such\r\nterms of compromise as Japan may be disposed to offer in furtherance of a\r\nuniform policy of intercourse with Western nations.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the increasing good will between our own Government\r\nand that of Mexico has been variously manifested. The treaty of commercial\r\nreciprocity concluded January 20, 1883, has been ratified and awaits the\r\nnecessary tariff legislation of Congress to become effective. This\r\nlegislation will, I doubt not, be among the first measures to claim your\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nA full treaty of commerce, navigation, and consular rights is much to be\r\ndesired, and such a treaty I have reason to believe that the Mexican\r\nGovernment stands ready to conclude.\r\n\r\nSome embarrassment has been occasioned by the failure of Congress at its\r\nlast session to provide means for the due execution of the treaty of July\r\n29, 1882, for the resurvey of the Mexican boundary and the relocation of\r\nboundary monuments.\r\n\r\nWith the Republic of Nicaragua a treaty has been concluded which authorizes\r\nthe construction by the United States of a canal, railway, and telegraph\r\nline across the Nicaraguan territory.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of this treaty 60 miles of the river San Juan, as well as Lake\r\nNicaragua, an inland sea 40 miles in width, are to constitute a part of the\r\nprojected enterprise.\r\n\r\nThis leaves for actual canal construction 17 miles on the Pacific side and\r\n36 miles on the Atlantic. To the United States, whose rich territory on the\r\nPacific is for the ordinary purposes of commerce practically cut off from\r\ncommunication by water with the Atlantic ports, the political and\r\ncommercial advantages of such a project can scarcely be overestimated.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that when the treaty is laid before you the justice and\r\nliberality of its provisions will command universal approval at home and\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nThe death of our representative at Russia while at his post at St.\r\nPetersburg afforded to the Imperial Government a renewed opportunity to\r\ntestify its sympathy in a manner befitting the intimate friendliness which\r\nhas ever marked the intercourse of the two countries.\r\n\r\nThe course of this Government in raising its representation at Bangkok to\r\nthe diplomatic rank has evoked from Siam evidences of warm friendship and\r\naugurs well for our enlarged intercourse. The Siamese Government has\r\npresented to the United States a commodious mansion and grounds for the\r\noccupancy of the legation, and I suggest that by joint resolution Congress\r\nattest its appreciation of this generous gift.\r\n\r\nThis government has more than once been called upon of late to take action\r\nin fulfillment of its international obligations toward Spain. Agitation in\r\nthe island of Cuba hostile to the Spanish Crown having been fomented by\r\npersons abusing the sacred rights of hospitality which our territory\r\naffords, the officers of this Government have been instructed to exercise\r\nvigilance to prevent infractions of our neutrality laws at Key West and at\r\nother points near the Cuban coast. I am happy to say that in the only\r\ninstance where these precautionary measures were successfully eluded the\r\noffenders, when found in our territory, were subsequently tried and\r\nconvicted.\r\n\r\nThe growing need of close relationship of intercourse and traffic between\r\nthe Spanish Antilles and their natural market in the United States led to\r\nthe adoption in January last of a commercial agreement looking to that end.\r\nThis agreement has since been superseded by a more carefully framed and\r\ncomprehensive convention, which I shall submit to the Senate for approval.\r\nIt has been the aim of this negotiation to open such a favored reciprocal\r\nexchange of productions carried under the flag of either country as to make\r\nthe intercourse between Cuba and Puerto Rico and ourselves scarcely less\r\nintimate than the commercial movement between our domestic ports, and to\r\ninsure a removal of the burdens on shipping in the Spanish Indies, of which\r\nin the past our shipowners and shipmasters have so often had cause to\r\ncomplain.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation of this convention has for a time postponed the prosecution\r\nof certain claims of our citizens which were declared to be without the\r\njurisdiction of the late Spanish-American Claims Commission, and which are\r\ntherefore remitted to diplomatic channels for adjustment. The speedy\r\nsettlement of these claims will now be urged by this Government.\r\n\r\nNegotiations for a treaty of commercial reciprocity with the Dominican\r\nRepublic have been successfully concluded, and the result will shortly be\r\nlaid before the Senate.\r\n\r\nCertain questions between the United States and the Ottoman Empire still\r\nremain unsolved. Complaints on behalf of our citizens are not\r\nsatisfactorily adjusted. The Porte has sought to withhold from our commerce\r\nthe right of favored treatment to which we are entitled by existing\r\nconventional stipulations, and the revision of the tariffs is\r\nunaccomplished.\r\n\r\nThe final disposition of pending questions with Venezuela has not as yet\r\nbeen reached, but I have good reason to expect an early settlement which\r\nwill provide the means of reexamining the Caracas awards in conformity with\r\nthe expressed desire of Congress, and which will recognize the justice of\r\ncertain claims preferred against Venezuela.\r\n\r\nThe Central and South American Commission appointed by authority of the act\r\nof July 7, 1884, will soon proceed to Mexico. It has been furnished with\r\ninstructions which will be laid before you. They contain a statement of the\r\ngeneral policy of the Government for enlarging its commercial intercourse\r\nwith American States. The commissioners have been actively preparing for\r\ntheir responsible task by holding conferences in the principal cities with\r\nmerchants and others interested in Central and South American trade.\r\n\r\nThe International Meridian Conference lately convened in Washington upon\r\nthe invitation of the Government of the United States was composed of\r\nrepresentatives from twenty-five nations. The conference concluded its\r\nlabors on the 1st of November, having with substantial unanimity agreed\r\nupon the meridian of Greenwich as the starting point whence longitude is to\r\nbe computed through 180 degrees eastward and westward, and upon the\r\nadoption, for all purposes for which it may be found convenient, of a\r\nuniversal day which shall begin at midnight on the initial meridian and\r\nwhose hours shall be counted from zero up to twenty-four.\r\n\r\nThe formal report of the transactions of this conference will be hereafter\r\ntransmitted to the Congress.\r\n\r\nThis Government is in frequent receipt of invitations from foreign states\r\nto participate in international exhibitions, often of great interest and\r\nimportance. Occupying, as we do, an advanced position in the world's\r\nproduction, and aiming to secure a profitable share for our industries in\r\nthe general competitive markets, it is a matter of serious concern that the\r\nwant of means for participation in these exhibitions should so often\r\nexclude our producers from advantages enjoyed by those of other countries.\r\nDuring the past year the attention of Congress was drawn to the formal\r\ninvitations in this regard tendered by the Governments of England, Holland,\r\nBelgium, Germany, and Austria. The Executive has in some instances\r\nappointed honorary commissioners. This is, however, a most unsatisfactory\r\nexpedient, for without some provision to meet the necessary working\r\nexpenses of a commission it can effect little or nothing in behalf of\r\nexhibitors. An International Inventions Exhibition is to be held in London\r\nnext May. This will cover a field of special importance, in which our\r\ncountry holds a foremost rank; but the Executive is at present powerless to\r\norganize a proper representation of our vast national interests in this\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nI have in several previous messages referred to this subject. It seems to\r\nme that a statute giving to the Executive general discretionary authority\r\nto accept such invitations and to appoint honorary commissioners, without\r\nsalary, and placing at the disposal of the Secretary of State a small fund\r\nfor defraying their reasonable expenses, would be of great public utility.\r\n\r\nThis Government has received official notice that the revised international\r\nregulations for preventing collisions at sea have been adopted by all the\r\nleading maritime powers except the United States, and came into force on\r\nthe 1st of September last. For the due protection of our shipping interests\r\nthe provisions of our statutes should at once be brought into conformity\r\nwith these regulations.\r\n\r\nThe question of securing to authors, composers, and artists copyright\r\nprivileges in this country in return for reciprocal rights abroad is one\r\nthat may justly challenge your attention. It is true that conventions will\r\nbe necessary for fully accomplishing this result; but until Congress shall\r\nby statute fix the extent to which foreign holders of copyright shall be\r\nhere privileged it has been deemed inadvisable to negotiate such\r\nconventions. For this reason the United States were not represented at the\r\nrecent conference at Berne.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the scope of the neutrality laws of the United States be\r\nso enlarged as to cover all patent acts of hostility committed in our\r\nterritory and aimed against the peace of a friendly nation. Existing\r\nstatutes prohibit the fitting out of armed expeditions and restrict the\r\nshipment of explosives, though the enactments in the latter respect were\r\nnot framed with regard to international obligations, but simply for the\r\nprotection of passenger travel. All these statutes were intended to meet\r\nspecial emergencies that had already arisen. Other emergencies have arisen\r\nsince, and modern ingenuity supplies means for the organization of\r\nhostilities without open resort to armed vessels or to filibustering\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nI see no reason why overt preparations in this country for the commission\r\nof criminal acts such as are here under consideration should not be alike\r\npunishable whether such acts are intended to be committed in our own\r\ncountry or in a foreign country with which we are at peace.\r\n\r\nThe prompt and thorough treatment of this question is one which intimately\r\nconcerns the national honor.\r\n\r\nOur existing naturalization laws also need revision. Those sections\r\nrelating to persons residing within the limits of the United States in 1795\r\nand 1798 have now only a historical interest. Section 2172, recognizing the\r\ncitizenship of the children of naturalized parents, is ambiguous in its\r\nterms and partly obsolete. There are special provisions of law favoring the\r\nnaturalization of those who serve in the Army or in merchant vessels, while\r\nno similar privileges are granted those who serve in the Navy or the Marine\r\nCorps.\r\n\r\n\"An uniform rule of naturalization\" such as the Constitution contemplates\r\nshould, among other things, clearly define the status of persons born\r\nwithin the United States subject to a foreign power (section 1992) and of\r\nminor children of fathers who have declared their intention to become\r\ncitizens but have failed to perfect their naturalization. It might be wise\r\nto provide for a central bureau of registry, wherein should be filed\r\nauthenticated transcripts of every record of naturalization in the several\r\nFederal and State courts, and to make provision also for the vacation or\r\ncancellation of such record in cases where fraud had been practiced upon\r\nthe court by the applicant himself or where he had renounced or forfeited\r\nhis acquired citizenship. A just and uniform law in this respect would\r\nstrengthen the hands of the Government in protecting its citizens abroad\r\nand would pave the way for the conclusion of treaties of naturalization\r\nwith foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of the last session effected in the diplomatic and consular\r\nservice certain changes and reductions which have been productive of\r\nembarrassment. The population and commercial activity of our country are\r\nsteadily on the increase, and are giving rise to new, varying, and often\r\ndelicate relationships with other countries. Our foreign establishment now\r\nembraces nearly double the area of operations that it occupied twenty years\r\nago. The confinement of such a service within the limits of expenditure\r\nthen established is not, it seems to me, in accordance with true economy. A\r\ncommunity of 60,000,000 people should be adequately represented in its\r\nintercourse with foreign nations.\r\n\r\nA project for the reorganization of the consular service and for recasting\r\nthe scheme of extraterritorial jurisdiction is now before you. If the\r\nlimits of a short session will not allow of its full consideration, I trust\r\nthat you will not fail to make suitable provision for the present needs of\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\nIt has been customary to define in the appropriation acts the rank of each\r\ndiplomatic office to which a salary is attached. I suggest that this course\r\nbe abandoned and that it be left to the President, with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate, to fix from time to time the diplomatic grade of the\r\nrepresentatives of this Government abroad as may seem advisable, provision\r\nbeing definitely made, however, as now, for the amount of salary attached\r\nto the respective stations.\r\n\r\nThe condition of our finances and the operations of the various branches of\r\nthe public service which are connected with the Treasury Department are\r\nvery fully discussed in the report of the Secretary.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the ordinary revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30,\r\n1884, were:\r\n\r\nFrom customs - $195,067,489.76\r\n\r\nFrom internal revenue - 121,586,072.51\r\n\r\nFrom all other sources - 31,866,307.65\r\n\r\nTotal ordinary revenues - 348,519,869.92\r\n\r\nThe public expenditures during the same period were:\r\n\r\nFor civil expenses - $22,312,907.71\r\n\r\nFor foreign intercourse - 1,260,766.37\r\n\r\nFor Indians - 6,475,999.29\r\n\r\nFor pensions - 55,429,228.06\r\n\r\nFor the military establishment, including river and harbor\r\nimprovements and arsenals - 39,429,603.36\r\n\r\nFor the naval establishment, including vessels, machinery,\r\nand improvements at navy-yards - 17,292,601.44\r\n\r\nFor miscellaneous expenditures, including public buildings,\r\nlight-houses, and collecting the revenue - 43,939,710.00\r\n\r\nFor expenditures on account of the District of Columbia - 3,407,049.62\r\n\r\nFor interest on the public debt - 54,578,378.48\r\n\r\nFor the sinking fund - 46,790,229.50\r\n\r\nTotal ordinary expenditures - 290,926,473.83\r\n\r\nLeaving a surplus of - 57,603,396.09\r\n\r\nAs compared with the preceding fiscal year, there was a net decrease of\r\nover $21,000,000 in the amount of expenditures. The aggregate receipts were\r\nless than those of the year previous by about $54,000,000. The falling off\r\nin revenue from customs made up nearly $20,000,000 of this deficiency, and\r\nabout $23,000,000 of the remainder was due to the diminished receipts from\r\ninternal taxation.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary estimates the total receipts for the fiscal year which will\r\nend June 30, 1885, at $330,000,000 and the total expenditures at\r\n$290,620,201.16, in which sum are included the interest on the debt and the\r\namount payable to the sinking fund. This would leave a surplus for the\r\nentire year of about $39,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe value of exports from the United States to foreign countries during the\r\nyear ending June 30, 1884, was as follows:\r\n\r\nDomestic merchandise - $724,964,852\r\n\r\nForeign merchandise - 15,548,757\r\n\r\nTotal merchandise - 740,513,609\r\n\r\nSpecie - 67,133,383\r\n\r\nTotal exports of merchandise and specie - 807,646,992\r\n\r\nThe cotton and cotton manufactures included in this statement were valued\r\nat $208,900,415; the breadstuffs at $162,544,715; the provisions at\r\n$114,416,547, and the mineral oils at $47,103,248.\r\n\r\nDuring the same period the imports were as follows:\r\n\r\nMerchandise - $667,697,693\r\n\r\nGold and silver - 37,426,262\r\n\r\nTotal - 705,123,955\r\n\r\nMore than 63 per cent of the entire value of imported merchandise consisted\r\nof the following articles:\r\n\r\nSugar and molasses - $103,884,274\r\n\r\nWool and woolen manufactures - 53,842,292\r\n\r\nSilk and its manufactures - 49,949,128\r\n\r\nCoffee - 49,686,705\r\n\r\nIron and steel and manufactures thereof - 41,464,599\r\n\r\nChemicals - 38,464,965\r\n\r\nFlax, hemp, jute, and like substances, and manufactures thereof -\r\n33,463,398\r\n\r\nCotton and manufactures of cotton - 30,454,476\r\n\r\nHides and skins other than fur skins - 22,350,906\r\n\r\nI concur with the Secretary of the Treasury in recommending the immediate\r\nsuspension of the coinage of silver dollars and of the issuance of silver\r\ncertificates. This is a matter to which in former communications I have\r\nmore than once invoked the attention of the National Legislature.\r\n\r\nIt appears that annually for the past six years there have been coined, in\r\nCompliance with the requirements of the act of February 28, 1878, more than\r\n27,000,000 silver dollars.\r\n\r\nThe number now outstanding is reported by the Secretary to be nearly\r\n185,000,000, whereof but little more than 40,000,000, or less than 22 per\r\ncent, are in actual circulation. The mere existence of this fact seems to\r\nme to furnish of itself a cogent argument for the repeal of the statute\r\nwhich has made such fact possible.\r\n\r\nBut there are other and graver considerations that tend in the same\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary avows his conviction that unless this coinage and the\r\nissuance of silver certificates be suspended silver is likely at no distant\r\nday to become our sole metallic standard. The commercial disturbance and\r\nthe impairment of national credit that would be thus occasioned can\r\nscarcely be overestimated.\r\n\r\nI hope that the Secretary's suggestions respecting the withdrawal from\r\ncirculation of the $1 and $2 notes will receive your approval. It is likely\r\nthat a considerable portion of the silver now encumbering the vaults of the\r\nTreasury might thus find its way into the currency.\r\n\r\nWhile trade dollars have ceased, for the present at least, to be an element\r\nof active disturbance in our currency system, some provision should be made\r\nfor their surrender to the Government. In view of the circumstances under\r\nwhich they were coined and of the fact that they have never had a\r\nlegal-tender quality, there should be offered for them only a slight\r\nadvance over their bullion value.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary in the course of his report considers the propriety of\r\nbeautifying the designs of our subsidiary silver coins and of so increasing\r\ntheir weight that they may bear their due ratio of value to the standard\r\ndollar. His conclusions in this regard are cordially approved.\r\n\r\nIn my annual message of 1882 I recommended the abolition of all excise\r\ntaxes except those relating to distilled spirits. This recommendation is\r\nnow renewed. In case these taxes shall be abolished the revenues that will\r\nstill remain to the Government will, in my opinion, not only suffice to\r\nmeet its reasonable expenditures, but will afford a surplus large enough to\r\npermit such tariff reduction as may seem to be advisable when the results\r\nof recent revenue laws and commercial treaties shall have shown in what\r\nquarters those reductions can be most judiciously effected.\r\n\r\nOne of the gravest of the problems which appeal to the wisdom of Congress\r\nfor solution is the ascertainment of the most effective means for\r\nincreasing our foreign trade and thus relieving the depression under which\r\nour industries are now languishing. The Secretary of the Treasury advises\r\nthat the duty of investigating this subject be intrusted in the first\r\ninstance to a competent commission. While fully recognizing the\r\nconsiderations that may be urged against this course, I am nevertheless of\r\nthe opinion that upon the whole no other would be likely to effect speedier\r\nor better results.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the Secretary's report which concerns the condition of our\r\nshipping interests can not fail to command your attention. He emphatically\r\nrecommends that as an incentive to the investment of American capital in\r\nAmerican steamships the Government shall, by liberal payments for mail\r\ntransportation or otherwise, lend its active assistance to individual\r\nenterprise, and declares his belief that unless that course be pursued our\r\nforeign carrying trade must remain, as it is to-day, almost exclusively in\r\nthe hands of foreigners.\r\n\r\nOne phase of this subject is now especially prominent in view of the repeal\r\nby the act of June 26, 1884, of all statutory provisions arbitrarily\r\ncompelling American vessels to carry the mails to and from the United\r\nStates. As it is necessary to make provision to compensate the owners of\r\nsuch vessels for performing that service after April, 1885, it is hoped\r\nthat the whole subject will receive early consideration that will lead to\r\nthe enactment of such measures for the revival of our merchant marine as\r\nthe wisdom of Congress may devise.\r\n\r\nThe 3 per cent bonds of the Government to the amount of more than\r\n$100,000,000 have since my last annual message been redeemed by the\r\nTreasury. The bonds of that issue still outstanding amount to little over\r\n$200,000,000, about one-fourth of which will be retired through the\r\noperations of the sinking fund during the coming year. As these bonds still\r\nconstitute the chief basis for the circulation of the national banks, the\r\nquestion how to avert the contraction of the currency caused by their\r\nretirement is one of constantly increasing importance.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be generally conceded that the law governing this matter exacts\r\nfrom the banks excessive security, and that upon their present bond\r\ndeposits a larger circulation than is now allowed may be granted with\r\nsafety. I hope that the bill which passed the Senate at the last session,\r\npermitting the issue of notes equal to the face value of the deposited\r\nbonds, will commend itself to the approval of the House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nIn the expenses of the War Department the Secretary reports a decrease of\r\nmore than $9,000,000. Of this reduction $5,600,000 was effected in the\r\nexpenditures for rivers and harbors and $2,700,000 in expenditures for the\r\nQuartermaster's Department.\r\n\r\nOutside of that Department the annual expenses of all the Army bureaus\r\nproper (except possibly the Ordnance Bureau) are substantially fixed\r\ncharges, which can not be materially diminished without a change in the\r\nnumerical strength of the Army. The expenditures in the Quartermaster's\r\nDepartment can readily be subjected to administrative discretion, and it is\r\nreported by the Secretary of War that as a result of exercising such\r\ndiscretion in reducing the number of draft and pack animals in the Army the\r\nannual cost of supplying and caring for such animals is now $1,108,085.90\r\nless than it was in 1881.\r\n\r\nThe reports of military commanders show that the last year has been notable\r\nfor its entire freedom from Indian outbreaks.\r\n\r\nIn defiance of the President's proclamation of July 1, 1884, certain\r\nintruders sought to make settlements in the Indian Territory. They were\r\npromptly removed by a detachment of troops.\r\n\r\nDuring the past session of Congress a bill to provide a suitable fire-proof\r\nbuilding for the Army Medical Museum and the library of the\r\nSurgeon-General's Office received the approval of the Senate. A similar\r\nbill, reported favorably to the House of Representatives by one of its\r\ncommittees, is still pending before that body. It is hoped that during the\r\ncoming session the measure may become a law, and that thereafter immediate\r\nsteps may be taken to secure a place of safe deposit for these valuable\r\ncollections, now in a state of insecurity.\r\n\r\nThe funds with which the works for the improvement of rivers and harbors\r\nwere prosecuted during the past year were derived from the appropriations\r\nof the act of August 2, 1882, together with such few balances as were on\r\nhand from previous appropriations. The balance in the Treasury subject to\r\nrequisition July 1, 1883, was $10,021,649.55. The amount appropriated\r\nduring the fiscal year 1884 was $1,319,634.62 and the amount drawn from the\r\nTreasury during the fiscal year was $8,228,703.54, leaving a balance of\r\n$3,112,580.63 in the Treasury subject to requisition July 1, 1884.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War submits the report of the Chief of Engineers as to the\r\npracticability of protecting our important cities on the seaboard by\r\nfortifications and other defenses able to repel modern methods of attack.\r\nThe time has now come when such defenses can be prepared with confidence\r\nthat they will not prove abortive, and when the possible result of delay in\r\nmaking such preparation is seriously considered delay seems inexcusable.\r\nFor the most important cities--those whose destruction or capture would be\r\na national humiliation--adequate defenses, inclusive of guns, may be made\r\nby the gradual expenditure of $60,000,000--a sum much less than a\r\nvictorious enemy could levy as a contribution. An appropriation of about\r\none-tenth of that amount is asked to begin the work, and I concur with the\r\nSecretary of War in urging that it be granted.\r\n\r\nThe War Department is proceeding with the conversion of 10-inch smoothbore\r\nguns into 8-inch rifles by lining the former with tubes of forged steel or\r\nof coil wrought iron. Fifty guns will be thus converted within the year.\r\nThis, however, does not obviate the necessity of providing means for the\r\nconstruction of guns of the highest power both for the purposes of coast\r\ndefense and for the armament of war vessels.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Gun Foundry Board, appointed April 2, 1883, in pursuance\r\nof the act of March 3, 1883, was transmitted to Congress in a special\r\nmessage of February 18, 1884. In my message of March 26, 1884, I called\r\nattention to the recommendation of the board that the Government should\r\nencourage the production at private steel works of the required material\r\nfor heavy cannon, and that two Government factories, one for the Army and\r\none for the Navy, should be established for the fabrication of guns from\r\nsuch material. No action having been taken, the board was subsequently\r\nreconvened to determine more fully the plans and estimates necessary for\r\ncarrying out its recommendation. It has received information which\r\nindicates that there are responsible steel manufacturers in this country\r\nwho, although not provided at present with the necessary plant, are willing\r\nto construct the same and to make bids for contracts with the Government\r\nfor the supply of the requisite material for the heaviest guns adapted to\r\nmodern warfare if a guaranteed order of sufficient magnitude, accompanied\r\nby a positive appropriation extending over a series of years, shall be made\r\nby Congress. All doubts as to the feasibility of the plan being thus\r\nremoved, I renew my recommendation that such action be taken by Congress as\r\nwill enable the Government to construct its own ordnance upon its own\r\nterritory, and so to provide the armaments demanded by considerations of\r\nnational safety and honor.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits the progress which has\r\nbeen made on the new steel cruisers authorized by the acts of August 5,\r\n1882, and March 3, 1883. Of the four vessels under contract, one, the\r\nChicago, of 4,500 tons, is more than half finished; the Atlanta, of 3,000\r\ntons, has been successfully launched, and her machinery is now fitting; the\r\nBoston, also of 3,000 tons, is ready for launching, and the Dolphin, a\r\ndispatch steamer of 1,500 tons, is ready for delivery.\r\n\r\nCertain adverse criticisms upon the designs of these cruisers are discussed\r\nby the Secretary, who insists that the correctness of the conclusions\r\nreached by the Advisory Board and by the Department has been demonstrated\r\nby recent developments in shipbuilding abroad.\r\n\r\nThe machinery of the double-turreted monitors Puritan, Terror, and\r\nAmphitrite, contracted for under the act of March 3, 1883, is in process of\r\nconstruction. No work has been done during the past year on their armor for\r\nlack of the necessary appropriations. A fourth monitor, the Monadnock,\r\nstill remains unfinished at the navy-yard in California. It is recommended\r\nthat early steps be taken to complete these vessels and to provide also an\r\narmament for the monitor Miantonomoh.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of the Naval Advisory Board, approved by the\r\nDepartment, comprise the construction of one steel cruiser of 4,500 tons,\r\none cruiser of 3,000 tons, two heavily armed gunboats, one light cruising\r\ngunboat, one dispatch vessel armed with Hotchkiss cannon, one armored ram,\r\nand three torpedo boats. The general designs, all of which are calculated\r\nto meet the existing wants of the service, are now well advanced, and the\r\nconstruction of the vessels can be undertaken as soon as you shall grant\r\nthe necessary authority.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress approved August 7, 1882, authorized the removal to the\r\nUnited States of the bodies of Lieutenant-Commander George W. De Long and\r\nhis companions of the Jeannette expedition. This removal has been\r\nsuccessfully accomplished by Lieutenants Harber and Schuetze. The remains\r\nwere taken from their grave in the Lena Delta in March, 1883, and were\r\nretained at Yakutsk until the following winter, the season being too far\r\nadvanced to admit of their immediate transportation. They arrived at New\r\nYork February 20, 1884, where they were received with suitable honors.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the joint resolution of Congress approved February 13,\r\n1884, a naval expedition was fitted out for the relief of Lieutenant A. W.\r\nGreely, United States Army, and of the party who had been engaged under his\r\ncommand in scientific observations at Lady Franklin Bay. The fleet\r\nconsisted of the steam sealer Thetis, purchased in England; the Bear,\r\npurchased at St. Johns, Newfoundland, and the Alert, which was generously\r\nprovided by the British Government. Preparations for the expedition were\r\npromptly made by the Secretary of the Navy, with the active cooperation of\r\nthe Secretary of War. Commander George W. Coffin was placed in command of\r\nthe Alert and Lieutenant William H. Emory in command of the Bear. The\r\nThetis was intrusted to Commander Winfield S. Schley, to whom also was\r\nassigned the superintendence of the entire expedition.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon its arrival at Upernavik the fleet began the dangerous\r\nnavigation of Melville Bay, and in spite of every obstacle reached\r\nLittleton Island on June 22, a fortnight earlier than any vessel had before\r\nattained that point. On the same day it crossed over to Cape Sabine, where\r\nLieutenant Greely and the other survivors of his party were discovered.\r\nAfter taking on board the living and the bodies of the dead, the relief\r\nships sailed for St. Johns, where they arrived on July 17. They were\r\nappropriately received at Portsmouth, N. H., on August 1 and at New York on\r\nAugust 8. One of the bodies was landed at the former place. The others were\r\nput on shore at Governors Island, and, with the exception of one, which was\r\ninterred in the national cemetery, were forwarded thence to the\r\ndestinations indicated by friends. The organization and conduct of this\r\nrelief expedition reflects great credit upon all who contributed to its\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nIn this the last of the stated messages that I shall have the honor to\r\ntransmit to the Congress of the United States I can not too strongly urge\r\nupon its attention the duty of restoring our Navy as rapidly as possible to\r\nthe high state of efficiency which formerly characterized it. As the long\r\npeace that has lulled us into a sense of fancied security may at any time\r\nbe disturbed, it is plain that the policy of strengthening this arm of the\r\nservice is dictated by considerations of wise economy, of just regard for\r\nour future tranquillity, and of true appreciation of the dignity and honor\r\nof the Republic.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General acquaints you with the present\r\ncondition and needs of the postal service.\r\n\r\nIt discloses the gratifying fact that the loss of revenue from the\r\nreduction in the rate of letter postage recommended in my message of\r\nDecember 4, 1882, and effected by the act of March 3, 1883, has been much\r\nless than was generally anticipated. My recommendation of this reduction\r\nwas based upon the belief that the actual falling off in receipts from\r\nletter postages for the year immediately succeeding the change of rate\r\nwould be $3,000,000. It has proved to be only $2,275,000.\r\n\r\nThis is a trustworthy indication that the revenue will soon be restored to\r\nits former volume by the natural increase of sealed correspondence.\r\n\r\nI confidently repeat, therefore, the recommendation of my last annual\r\nmessage that the single-rate postage upon drop letters be reduced to 1 cent\r\nwherever the payment of 2 cents is now required by law. The double rate is\r\nonly exacted at offices where the carrier system is in operation, and it\r\nappears that at those offices the increase in the tax upon local letters\r\ndefrays the cost not only of its own collection and delivery, but of the\r\ncollection and delivery of all other mail matter. This is an inequality\r\nthat ought no longer to exist.\r\n\r\nI approve the recommendation of the Postmaster-General that the unit of\r\nweight in the rating of first-class matter should be 1 ounce instead of\r\none-half ounce, as it now is. In view of the statistics furnished by the\r\nDepartment, it may well be doubted whether the change would result in any\r\nloss of revenue. That it would greatly promote the convenience of the\r\npublic is beyond dispute.\r\n\r\nThe free-delivery system has been lately applied to five cities, and the\r\ntotal number of offices in which it is now in operation is 159. Experience\r\nshows that its adoption, under proper conditions, is equally an\r\naccommodation to the public and an advantage to the postal service. It is\r\nmore than self-sustaining, and for the reasons urged by the\r\nPostmaster-General may properly be extended.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of that officer it is important to provide means whereby\r\nexceptional dispatch in dealing with letters in free-delivery offices may\r\nbe secured by payment of extraordinary postage. This scheme might be made\r\neffective by employment of a special stamp whose cost should be\r\ncommensurate with the expense of the extra service.\r\n\r\nIn some of the large cities private express companies have undertaken to\r\noutstrip the Government mail carriers by affording for the prompt\r\ntransmission of letters better facilities than have hitherto been at the\r\ncommand of the Post-Office.\r\n\r\nIt has always been the policy of the Government to discourage such\r\nenterprises, and in no better mode can that policy be maintained than in\r\nsupplying the public with the most efficient mail service that, with due\r\nregard to its own best interests, can be furnished for its accommodation.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General renews the recommendation contained in his report of\r\nlast year touching the fees of witnesses and jurors.\r\n\r\nHe favors radical changes in the fee bill, the adoption of a system by\r\nwhich attorneys and marshals of the United States shall be compensated\r\nsolely by salaries, and the erection by the Government of a penitentiary\r\nfor the confinement of offenders against its laws.\r\n\r\nOf the varied governmental concerns in charge of the Interior Department\r\nthe report of its Secretary presents an interesting summary. Among the\r\ntopics deserving particular attention I refer you to his observations\r\nrespecting our Indian affairs, the preemption and timber-culture acts, the\r\nfailure of railroad companies to take title to lands granted by the\r\nGovernment, and the operations of the Pension Office, the Patent Office,\r\nthe Census Bureau, and the Bureau of Education.\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made already to the circumstance that, both as between\r\nthe different Indian tribes and as between the Indians and the whites, the\r\npast year has been one of unbroken peace.\r\n\r\nIn this circumstance the President is glad to find justification for the\r\npolicy of the Government in its dealing with the Indian question and\r\nconfirmation of the views which were fully expressed in his first\r\ncommunication to the Forty-seventh Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary urges anew the enactment of a statute for the punishment of\r\ncrimes committed on the Indian reservations, and recommends the passage of\r\nthe bill now pending in the House of Representatives for the purchase of a\r\ntract of 18,000 square miles from the Sioux Reservation. Both these\r\nmeasures are worthy of approval.\r\n\r\nI concur with him also in advising the repeal of the preemption law, the\r\nenactment of statutes resolving the present legal complications touching\r\nlapsed grants to railroad companies, and the funding of the debt of the\r\nseveral Pacific railroads under such guaranty as shall effectually secure\r\nits ultimate payment.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Utah Commission will be read with interest.\r\n\r\nIt discloses the results of recent legislation looking to the prevention\r\nand punishment of polygamy in that Territory. I still believe that if that\r\nabominable practice can be suppressed by law it can only be by the most\r\nradical legislation consistent with the restraints of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nI again recommend, therefore, that Congress assume absolute political\r\ncontrol of the Territory of Utah and provide for the appointment of\r\ncommissioners with such governmental powers as in its judgment may justly\r\nand wisely be put into their hands.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this communication reference has more than once been made\r\nto the policy of this Government as regards the extension of our foreign\r\ntrade. It seems proper to declare the general principles that should, in my\r\nopinion, underlie our national efforts in this direction.\r\n\r\nThe main conditions of the problem may be thus stated:\r\n\r\nWe are a people apt in mechanical pursuits and fertile in invention. We\r\ncover a vast extent of territory rich in agricultural products and in\r\nnearly all the raw materials necessary for successful manufacture. We have\r\na system of productive establishments more than sufficient to supply our\r\nown demands. The wages of labor are nowhere else so great. The scale of\r\nliving of our artisan classes is such as tends to secure their personal\r\ncomfort and the development of those higher moral and intellectual\r\nqualities that go to the making of good citizens. Our system of tax and\r\ntariff legislation is yielding a revenue which is in excess of the present\r\nneeds of the Government.\r\n\r\nThese are the elements from which it is sought to devise a scheme by which,\r\nwithout unfavorably changing the condition of the workingman, our merchant\r\nmarine shall be raised from its enfeebled condition and new markets\r\nprovided for the sale beyond our borders of the manifold fruits of our\r\nindustrial enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe problem is complex and can be solved by no single measure of innovation\r\nor reform.\r\n\r\nThe countries of the American continent and the adjacent islands are for\r\nthe United States the natural marts of supply and demand. It is from them\r\nthat we should obtain what we do not produce or do not produce in\r\nsufficiency, and it is to them that the surplus productions of our fields,\r\nour mills, and our workshops should flow, under conditions that will\r\nequalize or favor them in comparison with foreign competition.\r\n\r\nFour paths of policy seem to point to this end:\r\n\r\nFirst. A series of reciprocal commercial treaties with the countries of\r\nAmerica which shall foster between us and them an unhampered movement of\r\ntrade. The conditions of these treaties should be the free admission of\r\nsuch merchandise as this country does not produce, in return for the\r\nadmission free or under a favored scheme of duties of our own products, the\r\nbenefits of such exchange to apply only to goods carried under the flag of\r\nthe parties to the contract; the removal on both sides from the vessels so\r\nprivileged of all tonnage dues and national imposts, so that those vessels\r\nmay ply unhindered between our ports and those of the other contracting\r\nparties, though without infringing on the reserved home coasting trade; the\r\nremoval or reduction of burdens on the exported products of those countries\r\ncoming within the benefits of the treaties, and the avoidance of the\r\ntechnical restrictions and penalties by which our intercourse with those\r\ncountries is at present hampered.\r\n\r\nSecondly. The establishment of the consular service of the United States on\r\na salaried footing, thus permitting the relinquishment of consular fees not\r\nonly as respects vessels under the national flag, but also as respects\r\nvessels of the treaty nations carrying goods entitled to the benefits of\r\nthe treaties.\r\n\r\nThirdly. The enactment of measures to favor the construction and\r\nmaintenance of a steam carrying marine under the flag of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nFourthly. The establishment of an uniform currency basis for the countries\r\nof America, so that the coined products of our mines may circulate on equal\r\nterms throughout the whole system of commonwealths. This would require a\r\nmonetary union of America, whereby the output of the bullion-producing\r\ncountries and the circulation of those which yield neither gold nor silver\r\ncould be adjusted in conformity with the population, wealth, and commercial\r\nneeds of each. As many of the countries furnish no bullion to the common\r\nstock, the surplus production of our mines and mints might thus be utilized\r\nand a step taken toward the general remonetization of silver.\r\n\r\nTo the accomplishment of these ends, so far as they can be attained by\r\nseparate treaties, the negotiations already concluded and now in progress\r\nhave been directed; and the favor which this enlarged policy has thus far\r\nreceived warrants the belief that its operations will ere long embrace all,\r\nor nearly all, the countries of this hemisphere.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means desirable, however, that the policy under consideration\r\nshould be applied to these countries alone. The healthful enlargement of\r\nour trade with Europe, Asia, and Africa should be sought by reducing tariff\r\nburdens on such of their wares as neither we nor the other American States\r\nare fitted to produce, and thus enabling ourselves to obtain in return a\r\nbetter market for our supplies of food, of raw materials, and of the\r\nmanufactures in which we excel.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that many of the embarrassing elements in the great national\r\nconflict between protection and free trade may thus be turned to good\r\naccount; that the revenue may be reduced so as no longer to overtax the\r\npeople; that protective duties may be retained without becoming burdensome;\r\nthat our shipping interests may be judiciously encouraged, the currency\r\nfixed on firm bases, and, above all, such an unity of interests established\r\namong the States of the American system as will be of great and\r\never-increasing advantage to them all.\r\n\r\nAll treaties in the line of this policy which have been negotiated or are\r\nin process of negotiation contain a provision deemed to be requisite under\r\nthe clause of the Constitution limiting to the House of Representatives the\r\nauthority to originate bills for raising revenue.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of February last I transmitted to the Congress the first annual\r\nreport of the Civil Service Commission, together with communications from\r\nthe heads of the several Executive Departments of the Government respecting\r\nthe practical workings of the law under which the Commission had been\r\nacting. The good results therein foreshadowed have been more than\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\nThe system has fully answered the expectations of its friends in securing\r\ncompetent and faithful public servants and in protecting the appointing\r\nofficers of the Government from the pressure of personal importunity and\r\nfrom the labor of examining the claims and pretensions of rival candidates\r\nfor public employment.\r\n\r\nThe law has had the unqualified support of the President and of the heads\r\nof the several Departments, and the members of the Commission have\r\nperformed their duties with zeal and fidelity. Their report will shortly be\r\nsubmitted, and will be accompanied by such recommendations for enlarging\r\nthe scope of the existing statute as shall commend themselves to the\r\nExecutive and the Commissioners charged with its administration.\r\n\r\nIn view of the general and persistent demand throughout the commercial\r\ncommunity for a national bankrupt law, I hope that the differences of\r\nsentiment which have hitherto prevented its enactment may not outlast the\r\npresent session.\r\n\r\nThe pestilence which for the past two years has been raging in the\r\ncountries of the East recently made its appearance in European ports with\r\nwhich we are in constant communication.\r\n\r\nThe then Secretary of the Treasury, in pursuance of a proclamation of the\r\nPresident, issued certain regulations restricting and for a time\r\nprohibiting the importation of rags and the admission of baggage of\r\nimmigrants and of travelers arriving from infected quarters. Lest this\r\ncourse may have been without strict warrant of law, I approve the\r\nrecommendation of the present Secretary that the Congress take action in\r\nthe premises, and I also recommend the immediate adoption of such measures\r\nas will be likely to ward off the dreaded epidemic and to mitigate its\r\nseverity in case it shall unhappily extend to our shores.\r\n\r\nThe annual report of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia reviews\r\nthe operations of the several departments of its municipal government. I\r\nask your careful consideration of its suggestions in respect to\r\nlegislation, especially commending such as relate to a revision of the\r\ncivil and criminal code, the performance of labor by persons sentenced to\r\nimprisonment in the jail, the construction and occupation of wharves along\r\nthe river front, and the erection of a suitable building for District\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nI recommend that in recognition of the eminent services of Ulysses S.\r\nGrant, late General of the armies of the United States and twice President\r\nof this nation, the Congress confer upon him a suitable pension.\r\n\r\nCertain of the measures that seem to me necessary and expedient I have now,\r\nin obedience to the Constitution, recommended for your adoption.\r\n\r\nAs respects others of no less importance I shall content myself with\r\nrenewing the recommendations already made to the Congress, without\r\nrestating the grounds upon which such recommendations were based.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of forests on the public domain, the granting of\r\nGovernment aid for popular education, the amendment of the Federal\r\nConstitution so as to make effective the disapproval by the President of\r\nparticular items in appropriation bills, the enactment of statutes in\r\nregard to the filling of vacancies in the Presidential office, and the\r\ndetermining of vexed questions respecting Presidential inability are\r\nmeasures which may justly receive your serious consideration.\r\n\r\nAs the time draws nigh when I am to retire from the public service, I can\r\nnot refrain from expressing to the members of the National Legislature with\r\nwhom I have been brought into personal and official intercourse my sincere\r\nappreciation of their unfailing courtesy and of their harmonious\r\ncooperation with the Executive in so many measures calculated to promote\r\nthe best interests of the nation.\r\n\r\nAnd to my fellow-citizens generally I acknowledge a deep sense of\r\nobligation for the support which they have accorded me in my administration\r\nof the executive department of this Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's State of the Union Addresses, by Chester A.
