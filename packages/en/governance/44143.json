Thiers\r\nhad been elected Chief of the Executive, and it was astonishing how\r\nrapidly his liking for a Republic increased since he had become the\r\nhead of one. It was now part of his task to check the too reactionary\r\ntendencies of the Assembly and to preserve that form of government which\r\nwas supposed to divide Frenchmen the least. The feeling against the\r\nGovernment of National Defence was as strong as ever, and the elections\r\nof some of the Orleans princes gave rise to inconvenient demonstrations\r\non the part of their political supporters, who pressed for the repeal\r\nof the law disqualifying that family. Thiers realized plainly enough\r\nthat the revival of this demand was premature, and would only add to\r\nthe general confusion, and had therefore induced the princes to absent\r\nthemselves from Bordeaux, but the question could no longer be avoided.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, June 6, 1871.\r\n\r\n     Thiers has been hard at work 'lobbying,' as the Americans\r\n     say, but could not come to any settlement with the Assembly,\r\n     and so begged them to postpone the question of the elections of\r\n     the Princes of Orleans till the day after to-morrow. One of the\r\n     plans proposed was that the provisional state of things should\r\n     be formally continued for two years, by conferring his present\r\n     powers on Thiers for that period. This would, it was hoped, keep\r\n     the Republicans quiet and allay the impatience of the monarchical\r\n     parties, by giving them a fixed time to look forward to. But this,\r\n     it seems, the majority in the Assembly would not promise to vote.\r\n     On the other hand, Thiers is said to be afraid of having the Duc\r\n     d'Aumale and perhaps Prince Napoleon also, speaking against him\r\n     in the Assembly, and attacking him and each other outside. Then\r\n     comes the doubt as to the extent to which the fusion between the\r\n     Comte de Chambord and the other Princes, or rather that between\r\n     their respective parties, really goes. Altogether nothing can be\r\n     less encouraging than the prospect. The Duc d'Aumale, as Lieutenant\r\n     Général du Royaume, to prepare the way for the Comte de Chambord,\r\n     is, for the moment, the favourite combination. In the meantime\r\n     Thiers has thrown a sop to the majority by putting an Orleanist\r\n     into the Home Office. The idea at Versailles yesterday was that\r\n     Thiers and the Assembly would come to a compromise on the basis\r\n     that the Orleans elections should be confirmed, but with a preamble\r\n     repeating that nothing done was to be held to prejudge the question\r\n     of the definitive government of France.\r\n\r\nWhen the question came up, Thiers yielded on the point of the admission\r\nof the Princes, and the majority were highly pleased at having extorted\r\nthis concession. Lord Lyons, dining at Thiers's house at Versailles, a\r\nfew days after the debate in the Assembly, met there the German General\r\nvon Fabrice, the Prince de Joinville, the Duc d'Aumale, and the Duc de\r\nChartres, and mentions the significant fact that M. and Madame Thiers\r\nand the rest of the company treated these Princes with even more than\r\nthe usual respect shown to Royal personages. In private conversation\r\nThiers expressed great confidence in soon getting the Germans out of the\r\nParis forts, but both he and Jules Favre complained that Bismarck was a\r\nvery bad creditor, and insisted upon having his first half-milliard by\r\nthe end of the month: in fact, the Germans were so clamorous for payment\r\nthat they hardly seemed to realize how anxious the French were to get\r\nrid of them, and that if the money was not immediately forthcoming, it\r\nwas only because it was impossible to produce it.\r\n\r\nWhat was of more immediate concern to the British Government than either\r\nthe payment of the indemnity or the future of the Orleans princes,\r\nwas the prospect of a new Commercial Treaty. This was sufficiently\r\nunpromising. Lord Lyons had pointed out during the Empire period, that\r\nunder a Constitutional _régime_ in France, we were not likely to enjoy\r\nsuch favourable commercial conditions as under personal government,\r\nand the more liberal the composition of a French Government, the\r\nmore Protectionist appeared to be its policy. Thiers himself was an\r\nardent Protectionist, quite unamenable to the blandishments of British\r\nFree Traders, who always appear to hold that man was made for Free\r\nTrade, instead of Free Trade for man, and the Finance Minister, Pouyer\r\nQuertier, entertained the same views as his chief. But, even if the\r\nEmperor were to come back, it was more than doubtful whether he would\r\nventure to maintain the existing Commercial Treaty as it stood, and\r\nthere was every probability that the Bordeaux wine people and other\r\nso-called French Free Traders would turn Protectionist as soon as they\r\nrealized that there was no prospect of British retaliation. What cut\r\nLord Lyons (an orthodox Free Trader) to the heart, was that, just as the\r\nFrench manufacturers had got over the shock of the sudden introduction\r\nof Free Trade under the Empire and had adapted themselves to the new\r\nsystem, everything should be thrown back again. It was likely, indeed,\r\nthat there would be some opposition to Thiers's Protectionist taxes,\r\nbut he knew well enough that there were not a sufficient number of\r\nFree Traders in the Assembly, or in the country, to make any effective\r\nresistance to the Government. When approached on the subject, the French\r\nMinisters asserted that all they wanted was to increase the revenue,\r\nand that all they demanded from England was to be allowed to raise\r\ntheir tariff with this view only, whereas, in their hearts, they meant\r\nProtection pure and simple. Lord Lyons's personal view was that England\r\nwould be better off if the Treaty was reduced to little more than a\r\nmost favoured nation clause. 'The only element for negotiation with the\r\nschool of political economy now predominant here,' he sadly remarked,\r\n'would be a threat of retaliation, and this we cannot use.' It will\r\nbe found subsequently that this was the one predominant factor in all\r\ncommercial negotiations between the two Governments.\r\n\r\nA long conversation with Thiers, who was pressing for a definite reply\r\nfrom Her Majesty's Government on the subject of a new Treaty showed\r\nthat matters from the British point of view were as unsatisfactory\r\nas they well could be. Thiers, whose language respecting England was\r\ncourteous and friendly, made it clear that Her Majesty's Government\r\nmust choose between the proposed modifications in the tariff and the\r\nunconditional denunciation of the whole Treaty, and that if the Treaty\r\nwere denounced, England must not expect, after its expiration, to be\r\nplaced upon the footing of the most favoured nation. He considered that\r\nhe had a right to denounce the Treaty at once, but had no wish to act\r\nin an unfriendly spirit, and had therefore refrained from doing so, and\r\nalthough he and his colleagues considered that the existing Treaty was\r\ndisadvantageous and even disastrous to France, they had never promoted\r\nany agitation against it, and had confined themselves to proposing\r\nmodifications of the tariff, which their financial necessities and the\r\nstate of the French manufacturing interests rendered indispensable.\r\nCoal and iron, which were articles of the greatest importance to\r\nEngland, were not touched, and all that had, in fact, been asked for\r\nwas a moderate increase on the duties on textile fabrics. As for the\r\nFrench Free Traders, whatever misleading views they might put forward in\r\nLondon, their influence upon the Assembly would be imperceptible, and it\r\nremained therefore for Her Majesty's Government to decide whether they\r\nwould agree to the changes he had proposed to them, or would give up\r\naltogether the benefits which England derived from the Treaty.\r\n\r\nThiers's real motive was disclosed later on, when, whilst asserting\r\nthat he should always act in a friendly spirit towards England, he\r\nadmitted that 'England was a much more formidable competitor in\r\ncommerce than any other nation.' Concessions which might safely be\r\nmade to other countries might very reasonably be withheld from her.\r\nFor instance, privileges which might be safely granted to the Italian\r\nmerchant navy might, if granted to Great Britain, produce a competition\r\nbetween English and French shipping very disadvantageous to France.\r\nIt would also be certainly for the interest of France that she should\r\nfurnish herself with colonial articles brought direct to her own ports\r\nrather than resort, as at present, to the depôts of such goods in\r\nGreat Britain. Nothing could be further from his intentions than to be\r\ninfluenced by any spirit of retaliation, nor, if the Treaty should be\r\ndenounced, would he, on that account, be less friendly to England in\r\npolitical matters; but it was evident that, in making his financial and\r\ncommercial arrangements, the interests and necessities of France must\r\nbe paramount. In conclusion he pressed for an immediate answer from Her\r\nMajesty's Government in order that the French Government might complete\r\ntheir plans, which were of urgent importance.\r\n\r\nTo the impartial observer the opinions expressed by Thiers seem to be\r\nlogical, natural, and reasonable, unless the principle of looking after\r\none's own interests is unreasonable; but to the ardent devotees of Free\r\nTrade, they must have appeared in the light of impiety. Lord Lyons, in\r\nreporting the interview, remarked that 'nothing could have been more\r\nunsatisfactory than Thiers's language,' and added significantly that he\r\nhimself had managed to keep his temper.\r\n\r\nThiers did not get his definite answer, and the wrangle continued until\r\nin February, 1872, the French Government, with the general approval of\r\nthe nation, gave notice of the termination of the Commercial Treaty of\r\n1860.\r\n\r\nThe Bill abrogating the proscription of the French Royal families had\r\nbeen passed by the Assembly, and the elections of the Duc d'Aumale and\r\nthe Prince de Joinville consequently declared valid, but these princes\r\nhaving established their rights, wisely remained in the background. Not\r\nso another illustrious Royalist, the Comte de Chambord. This prince, who\r\nwas also included in the reversal of the disqualifying law, returned\r\nto France and issued a proclamation from the Château of Chambord in\r\nJuly which spread consternation in the Royalist camp. After explaining\r\nthat his presence was only temporary and that he desired to create no\r\nembarrassment, he declared that he was prepared to govern on a broad\r\nbasis of administrative decentralization, but that there were certain\r\nconditions to which he could not submit. If he were summoned to the\r\nthrone he would accept, but he should retain his principles, and above\r\nall the White Flag which had been handed down to him by his ancestors.\r\nThis announcement seemed, to say the least, premature, and the\r\nsupporters of a Republic must have warmly congratulated themselves upon\r\nhaving to encounter an enemy who played so completely into their hands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 11, 1871.\r\n\r\n     The Comte de Chambord seems to have upset the Legitimist\r\n     coach. The Legitimist Deputies have been obliged to repudiate\r\n     the White Flag, being sure that they could never be elected to a\r\n     new Chamber under that Banner, and of course fusion between the\r\n     Orleans Princes and their cousin is now out of the question.\r\n\r\n     Thiers said to me last night that he did not regard the\r\n     Comte de Chambord's declaration in favour of the White Flag as\r\n     irrevocable--and that it looked as if it had been made in a moment\r\n     of ill-temper. According to Thiers, both the Comte de Chambord and\r\n     the Comte de Paris eagerly desire to be kings--most people doubt,\r\n     however, whether the Comte de Chambord does really wish it. All\r\n     that has occurred tends to strengthen and prolong Thiers's hold on\r\n     power, and he is rejoicing accordingly. Indeed, there is hardly a\r\n     Frenchman who professes to doubt that Thiers's Government is the\r\n     only Government possible at the moment.\r\n\r\n     Gambetta is not considered by Thiers to be dangerous; he\r\n     declares that he will only maintain a constitutional or legal\r\n     opposition so long as the Government is Republican, and if he and\r\n     his supporters stick to this, Thiers will certainly have no great\r\n     cause to dread them. If Rouher had been elected he would have been\r\n     a formidable opponent, though he has been too much accustomed\r\n     to lead an applauding and acquiescing majority to be good at\r\n     speaking to a hostile audience. Thiers says that the rejection of\r\n     Rouher will be a good thing for his own health and repose, as he\r\n     should have found it very fatiguing to have to answer the great\r\n     Imperialist orator.\r\n\r\n     The hurry with which the new duties were rushed through\r\n     the Assembly on Saturday is disquieting. Thiers and Jules Favre\r\n     protest, however, that they are determined to do nothing irregular\r\n     regarding the Commercial Treaties. The Swiss Minister tells me his\r\n     Government is determined to insist upon the strict execution of\r\n     the Swiss Treaty, without admitting any alteration of the tariffs,\r\n     but then the Swiss Treaty does not expire for five or six years. I\r\n     take care to give no opinion as to what we shall or shall not do.\r\n     Thiers talked again last night of conferring with me soon about the\r\n     details of the changes. I am not very anxious that he should do so,\r\n     as confusion is much more likely than anything else to arise from\r\n     carrying on the discussion in both places at once.\r\n\r\n     Half my time is taken up with the affairs of the unfortunate\r\n     English prisoners. It is necessary to be cautious, for the French\r\n     Authorities are extremely touchy on the subject. There does not\r\n     appear to be any danger of their being executed, as fortunately\r\n     they are a very insignificant and unimportant set of insurgents,\r\n     if insurgents they were; but they are kept a long time without\r\n     examination, and some do run the risk of being shipped off to New\r\n     Caledonia.\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Chambord, having effectually destroyed the chances of\r\nhis own party for the time being, now disappeared from the scene, and\r\nnothing more was heard of him or his White Flag for a considerable\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1871 did not pass without the old question of voting in\r\nthe House of Lords cropping up again. In July, Lord Lyons received\r\nan intimation from the Liberal Whip that his vote was wanted on the\r\nfollowing day, accompanied by a letter from Lord Granville in the same\r\nsense. He declined to come, on the same ground as formerly, viz. that\r\nhe considered it advisable that a diplomatist should keep aloof from\r\nhome politics, and also because he was extremely reluctant to give\r\nvotes on questions of which he had little knowledge. The particular\r\nquestion involved was presumably a vote of censure on the Government in\r\nconnection with the Army Purchase Bill, and he seems to have taken it\r\nfor granted that Lord Granville would make no objection. A letter from\r\nthe latter showed that he was mistaken.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Granville to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, July 17, 1871.\r\n\r\n     I cannot agree with the principle you lay down--Lord Stuart,\r\n     my father, the late Lord Cowley, and Lord Normanby when Ambassador\r\n     at Paris used to vote when specially summoned. So did Lord Cowley,\r\n     although he served under successive Governments. So did Lord\r\n     Westmoreland and others. I find no recommendation of your principle\r\n     in the report of the Committee of the House of Commons, and\r\n     although Lord Derby may have given evidence in favour of it, his\r\n     father gave practical proof in several instances that he entirely\r\n     disagreed with it.\r\n\r\n     A Foreign Government can hardly believe in the confidential\r\n     relations of this Government and her Ambassador, if the latter\r\n     being a Peer abstains from supporting them when a vote of want of\r\n     confidence, or one amounting to it, is proposed against them.\r\n\r\n     Clarendon brought before the Cabinet your disinclination to\r\n     vote on the question of the Irish Church. They unanimously decided\r\n     that we had a claim upon you, and you were good enough to consent,\r\n     stating the grounds you mention in your letter of yesterday.\r\n\r\n     It is of course too late for any practical result to our\r\n     controversy as regards to-night, but I hope you will consider\r\n     that I have a claim on you for the future, when your vote is of\r\n     importance. I shall never ask you unnecessarily to come over.\r\n\r\nAn intimation of this kind from an official chief could not well be\r\ndisregarded, but the reply to Lord Granville's letter is conclusive in\r\nits arguments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 27, 1871.\r\n\r\n     Your letter of the 17th about my voting in the House of Lords\r\n     goes farther than Lord Clarendon did on the previous occasion.\r\n     Lord Clarendon originally acquiesced in my not voting on the Irish\r\n     Church Bill, and when he subsequently begged me to come over,\r\n     unless I objected to the Bill, he founded his request principally\r\n     upon a strong opinion of Mr. Gladstone's that it was the duty of\r\n     a peer not to abstain from voting, and that every vote was of\r\n     consequence. On this ground he expressed a hope that I should come\r\n     over unless I was opposed to the Bill.\r\n\r\n     Of my predecessors, the only one who was in a position\r\n     resembling mine, was the present Lord Cowley; and certainly he will\r\n     always be a high authority with me.\r\n\r\n     I have been for more than thirty years, and I still am,\r\n     devoted to my own profession, and I am sure that if I can be of\r\n     any use in my generation, and do myself any credit, it must be\r\n     as a diplomatist. I have worked my way up in the regular course\r\n     of the profession, and have served under successive Governments,\r\n     both before and since I became a peer, without any reference to\r\n     home politics. In fact, I received my original appointment to the\r\n     service from Lord Palmerston; I was made paid attaché by Lord\r\n     Aberdeen; I was sent to Rome by Lord Russell; to Washington by Lord\r\n     Malmesbury; to Constantinople by Lord Russell; and finally to Paris\r\n     by Lord Derby. The appointment was given to me in the ordinary way\r\n     of advancement in my profession, and I was told afterwards by Lord\r\n     Clarendon that my being wholly unconnected with any party at home\r\n     had been considered to be a recommendation. I have myself always\r\n     thought that a regular diplomatist could only impair his efficiency\r\n     by taking part in home politics, and I have throughout acted upon\r\n     this conviction. During the thirteen years or thereabouts which\r\n     have elapsed since I succeeded to my father's peerage, I have given\r\n     only one vote in the House of Lords; the question, the Irish Church\r\n     vote, was one on which there really did seem to be a possibility\r\n     that the decision might turn upon one vote; and the question, as it\r\n     stood before the House, was hardly a party question.\r\n\r\n     In addition to all this, I must say that while I have a very\r\n     great reluctance to give blind votes, I do not wish to be diverted\r\n     from my diplomatic duties by having to attend to home questions;\r\n     also, I would rather give my whole energies to carrying out the\r\n     instructions of the Government abroad, without having continually\r\n     to consult my conscience about voting in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\n     I did not intend to have given you the trouble of reading\r\n     a long answer to your letter, but I have just received another\r\n     summons from Lord Bessborough. I hope, however, you will not press\r\n     me to come over to vote on Monday. You were at all events good\r\n     enough to say that you should never ask me to come unnecessarily;\r\n     but if, after considering my reasons, you insist upon my coming, I\r\n     must of course defer to your opinion and do what you desire.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to believe that Lord Granville, who was one of the\r\nmost amiable and considerate of men, was acting otherwise than under\r\npressure in thus endeavouring to utilize an Ambassador as a party hack.\r\nHis arguments certainly do not bear much investigation. If a foreign\r\ngovernment could not feel any confidence in an Ambassador who failed to\r\nsupport his party by a vote in Parliament, what confidence could they\r\npossibly feel in him if his party were out of office, and he continued\r\nat his post under the orders of political opponents? If the Clarendon\r\nCabinet really decided that they had a claim upon diplomatists as party\r\nmen it only showed that they were conspicuously wanting in judgment and\r\na prey to that dementia which occasionally seizes upon British statesmen\r\nwhen a division is impending. That state of mind is intelligible when\r\na division in the House of Commons is concerned, but what passes\r\ncomprehension is that pressure should be put upon members of the House\r\nof Lords to vote, whose abstention is obviously desirable, whilst scores\r\nof obscure peers are left unmolested. One peer's vote was as good as\r\nanother's in 1871, just as it is now; but in the division on the vote of\r\ncensure on the Army Purchase Bill only 244 peers voted out of a House\r\ncontaining about double that number.\r\n\r\nBefore long the question of the prolongation of Thiers's powers for a\r\nfixed period became the chief topic of interest. He was infinitely the\r\nmost important personage in France, and a large number of members were\r\ndesirous of placing him more or less in the position of a constitutional\r\nsovereign, and obliging him to take a Ministry from the majority in\r\nthe Assembly. The majority in the Assembly not unnaturally thought\r\nthat their ideas ought to prevail in the Government, and they resented\r\nbeing constantly threatened with the withdrawal of this indispensable\r\nman, an action which, it was thought, would amount to little short of a\r\nrevolution. What they wanted, therefore, was to bestow a higher title\r\nupon him than Chief of the Executive Power, which would exclude him from\r\ncoming in person to the Assembly; and it was only the difficulty of\r\nfinding some one to take his place, and the desire to get the Germans\r\nout of the Paris forts that kept them quiet. Like many other eminent\r\npersons considered to be indispensable, Thiers now began to give out\r\nthat he really desired to retire into private life, and that it was\r\nonly the country which insisted upon his staying in office, while as a\r\nmatter of fact, he was by no means as indifferent to power as he fancied\r\nhimself to be. In the Chamber he damaged his reputation to some extent\r\nby displays of temper and threats of resignation, but there was never\r\nmuch doubt as to the prolongation of his powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Aug. 25, 1871.\r\n\r\n     Thiers quitted the Tribune in a pet yesterday, and the whole\r\n     series of events in the Assembly has very much lowered his credit.\r\n     In the one thing in which he was thought to be pre-eminent, the\r\n     art of managing a deliberative body, he completely failed: and his\r\n     first threatening to resign, and then coming back and half giving\r\n     in, has very much damaged him. Nevertheless the general opinion\r\n     is that the prolongation of his powers will pass, upon his making\r\n     it a condition, as a vote of confidence, of his remaining. But it\r\n     is difficult to believe, even if it be passed by a considerable\r\n     majority, that things can go on smoothly between him and the\r\n     Assembly very long. If any party had a leader and courage, it might\r\n     do almost anything in France at this moment.\r\n\r\n     Arnim[2] is expected on Saturday. I knew him years ago at\r\n     Rome. I doubt his being a conciliatory negotiator. The French\r\n     believe that Bismarck is so anxious to obtain commercial advantages\r\n     for Alsace, that he will give them great things in return. He\r\n     is supposed to wish, in the first place, to conciliate his new\r\n     subjects; and, in the second, to divert for a time from Germany\r\n     the torrent of Alsatian manufactures which would pour in if the\r\n     outlets into France were stopped up. The French hope to get the\r\n     Paris forts evacuated in return for a continuance of the free\r\n     entrance of Alsatian goods into France until the 1st of January,\r\n     and they even speculate upon getting the Prussians to evacuate\r\n     Champagne, and content themselves with keeping the army, which was\r\n     to have occupied it, inside the German frontier, the French paying\r\n     the expenses, as if it were still in France. All this to be given\r\n     in return for a prolongation of commercial privileges for Alsace.\r\n     It would be ungenerous of 'most favoured nations' to claim similar\r\n     privileges.\r\n\r\n     Thiers was too full of the events of the afternoon in the\r\n     Assembly to talk about the Commercial Treaty. I don't believe he\r\n     has brought the Committee round to his duties on raw materials.\r\n\r\nAt the end of August, the Assembly by a very large majority passed a\r\nbill conferring upon Thiers the title of President of the Republic and\r\nconfirmed his powers for the duration of the existing Assembly, adopting\r\nat the same time a vote of confidence in him personally. The result\r\nof these proceedings was that the attempt to make a step towards the\r\ndefinite establishment of a Republic and to place Thiers as President\r\nfor a term of years in a position independent of the Assembly, failed.\r\nThe bill asserted what the Left had always denied, viz. the constituent\r\npower of the Assembly, and declared that the President was responsible\r\nto it. So far, it expressed the sentiments of the moderate men, and the\r\nminority was composed of extreme Legitimists and extreme Republicans. It\r\nalso proved that Thiers was still held to be the indispensable man.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly, which had adjourned after the passing of the\r\nabove-mentioned bill, met again in December, and was supposed to be\r\nmore Conservative than ever, owing to the fear created by Radical\r\nprogress in the country. Thiers's Presidential Message did not afford\r\nmuch satisfaction to the extreme partisans on either side, and it was\r\nevident that he did not desire any prompt solution of the Constitutional\r\nquestion, preferring to leave himself free, and not to be forced into\r\ntaking any premature decision. As for the Legitimist, Orleanist, and\r\nModerate Republican groups, their vacillation tended only to the\r\nadvantage of two parties, the Bonapartists and the Red Republicans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Dec. 26. 1871.\r\n\r\n     The New Year will open gloomily for France. The Germans appear\r\n     to be alarmed, or at all events irritated, by Thiers's military\r\n     boasts and military preparations. The boasts are certainly unwise,\r\n     and preparations or anything else which encourages the French\r\n     to expect to get off paying the three milliards are extremely\r\n     imprudent. The Germans mean to have their money and keep the\r\n     territory they have taken, and they say that they had better have\r\n     it out with France now that she is weak, than wait till she has\r\n     got strong again. The irritation of the French against the Germans\r\n     seems to grow, and the Germans are angry with the French for not\r\n     loving them, which after the conditions of peace, to say nothing of\r\n     the events of the war, seems somewhat unreasonable.\r\n\r\n     Thiers so far holds his own, and no party seems willing to\r\n     displace him, while no party agrees with him. The one thing in\r\n     which men of all parties seem to agree is in abusing Thiers, and\r\n     I must say that a good deal of the abuse is exceedingly unjust.\r\n     But with the members of the Assembly in this inflammable state of\r\n     feeling towards him, an unexpected spark may at any moment make\r\n     them flare up and turn him out almost before they are aware of\r\n     it. The general idea is that the Assembly would appoint the Duc\r\n     d'Aumale to succeed him; the acceptance of the Duc d'Aumale by\r\n     the country would depend upon the amount of vigour he showed in\r\n     putting down illegal opposition by force. There are members of the\r\n     Assembly who wish to declare that in case of Thiers's abdication\r\n     or dethronement, the President of the Assembly is to exercise the\r\n     Executive Power. This is with a view of bringing forward Grévy, who\r\n     is an honourable, moderate man, but an old thoroughbred Republican.\r\n     The immediate event people are looking forward to with interest\r\n     and anxiety is the election of a deputy for Paris on the 7th of\r\n     next month. No one will be surprised if a Red is returned, in\r\n     consequence of the men of order declining to vote. The Legitimists\r\n     and the Orleanists seem to be at daggers drawn again.\r\n\r\n     Arnim says that Bismarck's fierce despatch was partly intended\r\n     to strengthen Thiers's hands in resisting violence against the\r\n     Germans. If this is so, the ferocity went too far beyond the mark\r\n     to be successful, great as the provocation on the French side was.\r\n\r\n     I will write a mild disclaimer of the accuracy of Jules\r\n     Favre's accounts of his communications with me. There is no _malus\r\n     animus_, I think, in them. My Russian and Italian colleagues are\r\n     very much annoyed by the language he attributes to them.\r\n\r\nThe fierce despatch referred was a harsh communication from Bismarck\r\ncomplaining of the recent acquittal of some Frenchmen who had\r\nassassinated German soldiers of the army of occupation.\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1871, the Bonapartist Party, although scarcely\r\nrepresented in the Assembly, appeared to be that which caused the\r\nGovernment the most anxiety. That party had undoubtedly made progress\r\nin the country; it held out the hope of a vigorous and determined\r\nmaintenance of public order, and a vast number of Frenchmen were so much\r\nout of heart, so wearied and disgusted by the results of the attempts\r\nat political liberty, and so much afraid of the triumph of the Commune,\r\nthat they were prepared to sacrifice anything in order to be assured of\r\npeace and tranquillity. The peasants, shopkeepers, and even many of the\r\nworkmen in the towns, sighed for the material prosperity of the Empire.\r\nThey believed that the Emperor had been betrayed by his Ministers and\r\nGenerals, and were willing to excuse his personal share even in the\r\ncapitulation of Sedan. If more confidence could have been felt in his\r\nhealth and personal energy, the advocates of a restoration of the Empire\r\nwould have been still more numerous. As it was, a great mass of the\r\nignorant and the timid were in favour of it, and it was the opinion\r\nof so impartial an observer as the British Ambassador, that if a free\r\nvote could have been taken under universal suffrage a majority would\r\nprobably have been obtained for the re-establishment upon the throne of\r\nNapoleon III. If the Imperialists could by any means have seized upon\r\nthe executive Government and so directed the operations of a plébiscite,\r\nthere was little doubt as to their securing the usual millions of votes\r\nunder that process. With them, as with the other parties, the difficulty\r\nlay in bringing about such a crisis as would enable them to act, and the\r\nEmperor himself was disinclined to take any adventurous step.\r\n\r\nThe Legitimists had the advantage of holding to a definite principle,\r\nbut it was a principle which carried little weight in the country in\r\ngeneral. Their chief, the Comte de Chambord, had shown himself to be so\r\nimpracticable, that it really seemed doubtful whether he wished to mount\r\nthe throne, and the party had more members in the existing Assembly than\r\nit was likely to obtain if a fresh general election took place; added\r\nto which it had quarrelled with the Orleanists, a union with whom was\r\nessential to the attainment of any practical end.\r\n\r\nThe Orleanists were weakened by their dissensions with the Legitimists\r\nand discouraged by what they considered the want of energy and\r\nenterprise of the Princes of the family. The members of the Orleans\r\nparty suffered from the want of a definite principle, and consisted\r\nchiefly of educated and enlightened men who held to Constitutional\r\nMonarchy and Parliamentary Government; in reality they were a\r\nfluctuating body willing to accept any Government giving a promise of\r\norder and political liberty.\r\n\r\nThe moderate Republicans included in their ranks many honest and\r\nrespected men, but they had to contend with the extreme unpopularity of\r\nthe Government of National Defence in which they had formed the chief\r\npart, and although the existing Government was nominally based upon\r\ntheir principles, they did not appear to be gaining ground. The extreme\r\nRepublicans endeavoured to make up by violence what they wanted in\r\nnumerical strength, and as they saw no prospect of obtaining office in\r\na regular manner, founded their hopes upon seizing power at a critical\r\nmoment with the help of the Paris mob.\r\n\r\nAmidst this collection of parties stood Thiers's Government, supported\r\nheartily by none, but accepted by all. By skilful management, by\r\nyielding where resistance appeared hopeless, and by obtaining votes\r\nsometimes from one side of the Assembly, and sometimes from the other,\r\nThiers had carried many points to which he attached importance, and\r\nhad never yet found himself in a minority. His Government was avowedly\r\na temporary expedient, resting upon a compromise between all parties,\r\nor rather upon the adjournment of all constitutional questions. To the\r\nmonarchical parties which formed the majority of the Assembly, Thiers's\r\napparent adoption of the Republican system rendered him especially\r\nobnoxious. On the other hand, the Republicans were dissatisfied because,\r\nthe whole weight of the Government was not unscrupulously used for the\r\npurpose of establishing a Republic permanently, with or without the\r\nconsent of the people.\r\n\r\nOn the centralization of the administration, on military organization,\r\non finance, and on other matters, Thiers's personal views were widely\r\ndifferent from those generally prevalent in the Assembly, and there was\r\nplenty of censure and criticism of him in private; but no one party saw\r\nits way to ensuring its own triumph, and all were weighed down by the\r\nnecessity of maintaining endurable relations with Germany. In forming\r\nsuch relations, Thiers had shown great skill and obtained considerable\r\nsuccess in his arduous task. Bismarck, in imposing the hardest possible\r\nconditions of peace, had acted avowedly on the principle that it was\r\nhopeless to conciliate France, and that the only security for Germany\r\nlay in weakening her as much as possible. This policy having been\r\ncarried out, the German public and the German press appeared to be quite\r\nsurprised that France was slow to be reconciled to her conquerors,\r\nand even to doubt whether already France was not too strong for their\r\nsafety. The apparent recovery of the French finances may well have\r\nsurprised them disagreeably, but Thiers was not over careful to avoid\r\nincreasing their distrust. His intention to create a larger army than\r\nFrance had ever maintained before, and his frequent praises of the army\r\nhe already possessed, was not reassuring to them. It was, therefore,\r\nnot altogether surprising that they should have felt some doubts as to\r\nthe consequences of finding themselves confronted by an immense army,\r\nwhen they called upon France to pay the remaining three milliards in\r\n1874. Nevertheless the German Government had expressed its confidence in\r\nThiers, and it would have been almost impossible for any new Government\r\nto have placed matters on as tolerable a footing.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, therefore, it seemed not improbable that the\r\nexisting Government might last for some time, although its life was\r\nsomewhat precarious, since it was liable to be upset by commotions\r\nand conspiracies, and having no existence apart from Thiers, its\r\nduration was bound to depend on the health and strength of a man nearly\r\nseventy-four years old.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1872, Thiers, in consequence of a dispute in the Chamber\r\nover the question of a tax on raw materials, tendered his resignation,\r\nbut was persuaded with some difficulty to reconsider it. 'I have never\r\nknown the French so depressed and so out of heart about their internal\r\naffairs,' wrote Lord Lyons. 'They don't believe Thiers can go on\r\nmuch longer, and they see nothing but confusion if he is turned out.\r\nThe Legitimists and Orleanists are now trying for fusion. They are\r\nattempting to draw up a constitution on which they can all agree, and\r\nwhich, when drawn up, is to be offered to the Comte de Chambord, and if\r\nrefused by him, then to the Comte de Paris. I hear they have not yet\r\nbeen able to come to an understanding on the first article. It all tends\r\nto raise the Bonapartists. Many people expect to hear any morning of a\r\ncoup by which Thiers and the Assembly will be deposed, and an _appel au\r\npeuple_, made to end in a restoration of the Empire.' Probably it was\r\nthe knowledge of a Bonapartist reaction in the country that led Thiers\r\nto make a singularly foolish complaint against an alleged military\r\ndemonstration in England in favour of the ex-Emperor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Feb. 9, 1872.\r\n\r\n     M. Thiers said to me yesterday at Versailles that he had\r\n     been told that a general of the name of Wood had marched 6000 of\r\n     Her Majesty's troops to Chislehurst to be reviewed by the Emperor\r\n     Napoleon.\r\n\r\n     M. Thiers went on to say that no one could appreciate more\r\n     highly than he did the noble and generous hospitality which England\r\n     extended to political exiles, and that he had indeed profited by\r\n     it in his own person. He admired also the jealousy with which the\r\n     English nation regarded all attempts from abroad to interfere with\r\n     the free exercise of this hospitality. He should never complain\r\n     of due respect being shown to a Sovereign Family in adversity. But\r\n     he thought that there was some limit to be observed in the matter.\r\n     For instance, he himself, while on the best terms with the reigning\r\n     dynasty in Spain, still always treated the Queen Isabella, who was\r\n     in France, with great respect and deference. Nevertheless, when Her\r\n     Majesty had expressed a desire to go to live at Pau, he had felt it\r\n     to be his duty to ask her very courteously to select a residence at\r\n     a greater distance from the frontier of Spain. In this, as in all\r\n     matters, he felt that consideration for the exiles must be tempered\r\n     by a due respect for the recognized Government of their country.\r\n     Now if the Emperor Napoleon should choose to be present at a review\r\n     of British troops, there could be no objection to his being treated\r\n     with all the courtesy due to a head which had worn a crown. It was,\r\n     however, a different thing to march troops to his residence to hold\r\n     a review there in his honour.\r\n\r\nThiers had not taken the trouble to substantiate his ridiculous\r\ncomplaint, and his action was an instance of the extreme gullibility\r\nof even the most intelligent French statesmen, where foreign countries\r\nare concerned, and so perturbed was the French Government at the idea\r\nof a Bonapartist restoration, that according to Captain Hotham, British\r\nConsul at Calais, two gunboats, the _Cuvier_ and _Faon_, were at that\r\ntime actually employed in patrolling the coast between St. Malo and\r\nDunkirk with a view to preventing a possible landing of the Emperor\r\nNapoleon. A little later, the Duc de Broglie, French Ambassador in\r\nLondon, made a tactless remonstrance to Lord Granville with regard to\r\nthe presence of the Emperor and Empress at Buckingham Palace, on the\r\noccasion of a National Thanksgiving held to celebrate the recovery of\r\nthe Prince of Wales from a dangerous illness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Granville to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, March 1, 1872.\r\n\r\n     The Duc de Broglie told me to-day that he had been rather\r\n     surprised when he heard of the Emperor and Empress having been at\r\n     Buckingham Palace on so public an occasion as that of last Tuesday,\r\n     that I had not mentioned it to him on Monday afternoon, when we had\r\n     had a long conversation. It would have enabled him to write to M.\r\n     de Rémusat,[3] and thus have prevented any of the effect which a\r\n     sudden announcement in the papers might create in France.\r\n\r\n     I told him that I had not been consulted and did not know the\r\n     fact of the invitation when I saw him, and that if I had, I should\r\n     probably have mentioned it to him, although not a subject about\r\n     which I should have written.\r\n\r\n     I should have explained to him that it was an act of courtesy\r\n     of the Queen to those with whom she had been on friendly relations,\r\n     and that it was analogous to many acts of courtesy shown by the\r\n     Queen to the Orleanist Princes.\r\n\r\n     He laid stress on the publicity of the occasion, and on the\r\n     few opportunities which he, as Ambassador, had of seeing the Queen,\r\n     of which he made no complaint; but it made any attentions to the\r\n     Emperor on public occasions more marked. He was afraid that the\r\n     announcement would produce considerable effect, not upon statesmen,\r\n     but upon the press in France.\r\n\r\n     I repeated that the admission of the Emperor and Empress had\r\n     no political significance, but had been in pursuance with the\r\n     long-established habit of the Queen to show personal courtesy\r\n     to Foreign Princes with whom she had been formerly on friendly\r\n     relations.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Finance Minister, Pouyer Quertier, in the spring had\r\ngiven rise to hopes that the French commercial policy would become more\r\nliberal, but the letters quoted below show how powerless were the\r\narguments of the British Government and how completely wasted upon the\r\nFrench Ministers were the lamentations of the British free traders,\r\nand their prognostications of ruin to those who were not sufficiently\r\nenlightened to adopt their policy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 5, 1872.\r\n\r\n     I suppose Pouyer Quertier is really out, but we see so many\r\n     changes from hour to hour in resolutions here, that I shall not\r\n     report it officially until his successor is gazetted. We cannot\r\n     have a more Protectionist successor; but, after all, no one is so\r\n     bigoted a Protectionist as Thiers himself.\r\n\r\n     Nevertheless the change of Minister will give a chance or an\r\n     excuse for a change of policy to some extent. I think that with a\r\n     view to this some stronger expression of displeasure, or rather\r\n     perhaps of regret than we have hitherto ventured upon, might have\r\n     a good effect. The new Minister and perhaps even Thiers himself\r\n     might be struck by a report from Broglie that you had put strongly\r\n     before him the impossibility, whatever efforts the Government might\r\n     make, of preventing public opinion in England becoming hostile to\r\n     France if the present commercial policy is persisted in. It is in\r\n     fact plain that there is no probability of France obtaining the\r\n     concessions from the Treaty Powers, on which Thiers professed to\r\n     reckon. The result already is that, whatever may have been the\r\n     intention, the Mercantile Marine Law is in practice a blow which\r\n     falls on England, and not on other European Powers. Unless the\r\n     French Government means to give us a real most favoured nation\r\n     clause, the result of denouncing our treaty will be to place us,\r\n     when it expires, at a special disadvantage as compared with other\r\n     nations. And what it now asks us to effect by negotiation, is to\r\n     hasten the moment at which it can accomplish this. It is quite idle\r\n     to talk of special friendship for us, when its measures practically\r\n     treat us much worse than they do the Germans. M. de Rémusat and\r\n     some other people are fond of saying that it is quite impossible\r\n     that France could bear to see two nations so friendly as Belgium\r\n     and England placed exceptionally in a position inferior to Germany.\r\n     But France seems to bear this with great equanimity so far as our\r\n     merchant navy is concerned.\r\n\r\n     The demand we have made to be exempted from the _surtaxes de\r\n     pavillon_ under our most favoured nation clause would give the\r\n     French Government a means of remedying the injustice _if it wished\r\n     to do so_. At any rate some strong expressions of discontent on\r\n     our part might increase the disinclination of the Assembly and\r\n     some members of the Government to insist on imposing the duties on\r\n     the raw materials. It would be very convenient if there were some\r\n     retaliatory measures to which we could resort, without injuring\r\n     ourselves or departing from our own Free Trade principles. The\r\n     French Government grossly abuses, in order to influence the\r\n     Assembly, our assurances of unimpaired good will, and reluctance\r\n     to retaliate; and so, in my opinion, is preparing the way for the\r\n     real diminution of good will which its success in carrying its\r\n     protectionist measures, to our special injury, must produce in the\r\n     end.\r\n\r\n     The present Government of France does not gain strength; far\r\n     from it. The Imperialists are gaining strength, as people become\r\n     more and more afraid of the Reds, and feel less and less confidence\r\n     in the power either of Thiers, or the Comte de Chambord, or the\r\n     Comte de Paris, to keep them down. The end will probably be brought\r\n     about by some accident when it is least expected. It would not be\r\n     wise to leave out of the calculation of possibilities, the chance\r\n     of Thiers's Government dragging on for some time yet, and it would\r\n     be very difficult to predict what will succeed it. At present the\r\n     Legitimists and Orleanists seem to have lost, and to be daily\r\n     losing prestige, and naturally enough, to be bringing down with\r\n     them the Assembly in which they are or were a majority.\r\n\r\n     Perhaps I ought to say that the despatch which I send you\r\n     to-day about the sojourn of our Royal Family in the South of\r\n     France applies exclusively to them. Everybody knows or ought to\r\n     know that affairs are uncertain in France, but I should not think\r\n     it necessary or proper to warn private people against coming to\r\n     France or staying there. The conspicuous position of members\r\n     of the Royal Family increase the risk of their being placed in\r\n     awkward circumstances, and circumstances which would be of little\r\n     consequence in the case of private people, would be very serious\r\n     and embarrassing if they affected members of the Royal Family of\r\n     England.\r\n\r\nThe last passage referred to a stay at Nice contemplated by the Prince\r\nof Wales. In the event of any change of Government, it was always feared\r\nthat disorders would take place in the southern towns of France.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 14, 1872.\r\n\r\n     The commercial disputes with the French Government which, as\r\n     you know, I always apprehended, are coming thick upon us. I foresaw\r\n     what was coming and begged Thiers, Rémusat and other members of\r\n     the Government over and over again to guard against vexations in\r\n     the execution of the Treaty while it lasted. I make little doubt,\r\n     notwithstanding, that all these violent and unfair proceedings are\r\n     prompted, not checked, from Paris.\r\n\r\n     The Spaniards have found out the only way to deal with the\r\n     Protectionist spirit here. The slightest hint at retaliation would\r\n     have such an effect in the Assembly as to stop the onward career of\r\n     illiberality. As things now are, the extortioners have the game in\r\n     their own hands. They levy what duty they please, and pay just as\r\n     much or as little attention as may suit them, to our remonstrances.\r\n     It is a very disagreeable affair for one who, like myself, is\r\n     really anxious that there should be good feeling between the two\r\n     countries. We are in a fix. On the one hand, we cannot, without\r\n     injuring ourselves and abandoning our principles, retaliate; and\r\n     on the other hand, while they feel sure we shall do no more than\r\n     remonstrate, the Protectionist officials will care very little.\r\n     If indeed the general opinion is to be relied upon, the present\r\n     Government and its chief may come down with a crash at any moment,\r\n     but I don't know whether a change would benefit us commercially.\r\n\r\nLord Lyons, like Lord Granville and other English public men and\r\nofficials of the day, was a Free Trader, as has already been stated.\r\nBut it would be difficult for the most ardent Protectionist to make\r\nout a stronger case against the helplessness of a Free Trade policy\r\nwhen negotiating with a foreign Government than is disclosed in these\r\nletters, and there are any number of others all in the same strain. All\r\nthe protestations of goodwill, of sympathy, and benefit to the human\r\nrace, etc., were, and presumably are still, a pure waste of time when\r\naddressed to a country about to frame a tariff in accordance with its\r\nown interests, unless the threat of retaliation is used in order to\r\nretain some bargaining power, as apparently the Spaniards had already\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that Thiers's plans of military\r\nre-organization and his somewhat imprudent language had caused some\r\nagitation in Germany, and when the German Ambassador, Count Arnim,\r\nreturned to his post at Paris in the spring of 1872, it was freely\r\nrumoured that he was the bearer of remarkably unpleasant communications.\r\nThese apprehensions turned out to be exaggerated, and Thiers in\r\nconversation always assumed a lamb-like attitude of peace. He denied\r\nthat the Germans had addressed any representations to him, said that all\r\nsuspicions against him were grossly unjust, that it would be absolute\r\nmadness for France to think of going to war, and that, for his part,\r\nthe keystone of all his foreign policy was peace. As for his army\r\nreform schemes, he was a much misunderstood man. He was undoubtedly\r\nreorganizing the military forces of France, and it was his duty to place\r\nthem upon a respectable footing, and so provide a guarantee for peace.\r\nIt was, however, quite false to say that he was arming, for that term\r\nimplied that he was making preparations for war, and that he was putting\r\nthe army into a condition to pass at once from a state of peace to a\r\nstate of war. He was doing nothing of the sort; on the contrary, his\r\nefforts were directed to obtaining the evacuation of the territory, by\r\nproviding for the payment of the war indemnity to Germany, and it could\r\nhardly be supposed that if he were meditating a renewal of the contest,\r\nhe would begin by making over three milliards to her.\r\n\r\nFrom Arnim's language, it appeared that the German public was irritated\r\nand alarmed at the perpetual harping of the French upon the word\r\n'Revenge,' and that the German military men (the _militaires_ who were\r\nalways so convenient to Bismarck for purposes of argument) conceived\r\nthat the best guarantee for peace would be to keep their soldiers as\r\nlong as possible within a few days' march of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe German fears were, no doubt, greatly exaggerated, but if they\r\nexisted at all they were largely due to Thiers's own language, who,\r\nwhile not talking indeed of immediate revenge, was fond of boasting of\r\nthe strength and efficiency of the French army, and even of affirming\r\nthat it was at that very moment equal to cope with the Germans. That he\r\nwas conscious of having created suspicion may be inferred from the fact\r\nthat when the Prince of Wales passed through Paris on his way from Nice\r\nto Germany, he begged H.R.H. to use his influence at the Court of Berlin\r\nto impress upon the Emperor and all who were of importance there, that\r\nthe French Government, and the President himself in particular, desired\r\npeace above all things, and were resolved to maintain it. A letter from\r\nthe British Ambassador at Berlin throws some light upon the prevalent\r\nGerman feeling.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Odo Russell[4] to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    British Embassy, Berlin, April 27, 1872.\r\n\r\n     Since your letter of the 9th inst. reached me feelings have\r\n     changed in Berlin.\r\n\r\n     Thiers's Army bill and Speech have irritated the Emperor,\r\n     Bismarck and indeed everybody.\r\n\r\n     The Generals tell the Emperor it would be better to fight\r\n     France before she is ready than after; but Bismarck, who scorns the\r\n     Generals, advises the Emperor to fight France _morally_ through\r\n     Rome and the Catholic alliances against United Germany.\r\n\r\n     Although he denies it, Bismarck probably caused those violent\r\n     articles against Thiers to appear in the English newspapers, and he\r\n     tells everybody that Thiers has lost his esteem and may lose his\r\n     support. The next grievance they are getting up against him is that\r\n     he is supposed to have made offers through Le Flô to Russia against\r\n     Germany.\r\n\r\n     In short, from having liked him and praised him and wished for\r\n     him, they are now tired of him and think him a traitor because he\r\n     tries to reform the French Army on too large a scale!\r\n\r\n     Gontaut[5] does not appear to do anything beyond play the\r\n     agreeable, which he does perfectly, and every one likes him. But\r\n     it is said that _Agents_, financial Agents I presume, are employed\r\n     by Thiers to communicate through Jewish Bankers here indirectly\r\n     with Bismarck. Through these agents Thiers is supposed to propose\r\n     arrangements for an early payment of the 3 milliards and an early\r\n     withdrawal of the German troops of occupation,--the payment\r\n     to be effected by foreign loans and the guarantee of European\r\n     Bankers,--in paper not in gold. Bismarck has not yet pronounced\r\n     definitely, but the Emperor William won't hear of shortening the\r\n     occupation of France. Indeed, he regrets he cannot by Treaty leave\r\n     his soldiers longer still as a guarantee of peace while he lives,\r\n     for he is most anxious to die at peace with all the world.\r\n\r\n     So that nothing is done and nothing will be done before Arnim\r\n     returns to Paris. He has no sailing orders yet and seems well\r\n     amused here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Mr. Odo Russell._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 7, 1872.\r\n\r\n     Many thanks for your interesting letter.\r\n\r\n     Arnim's account of public opinion at Berlin entirely confirms\r\n     that which you give, only he says Bismarck would be personally\r\n     willing to come to an arrangement with France for payment of the\r\n     milliards and the evacuation of the territory, but that he will not\r\n     run any risk of injuring his own position by opposing either Moltke\r\n     or public opinion on this point.\r\n\r\n     I don't think the Germans need the least fear the French\r\n     attacking them for many years to come. The notion of coming now\r\n     to destroy France utterly, in order to prevent her ever in the\r\n     dim future being able to revenge herself, seems simply atrocious.\r\n     The French are so foolish in their boasts, and the Germans so\r\n     thin-skinned, that I am afraid of mischief.\r\n\r\n     I should doubt Bismarck's being wise in setting himself in\r\n     open hostility to the Vatican. The favour of the Holy See is seldom\r\n     of any practical use, so far as obtaining acts in its favour, to a\r\n     Protestant or even to a Roman Catholic Government; but the simple\r\n     fact of being notoriously in antagonism to it, brings a vast amount\r\n     of opposition and ill-will on a Government that has Catholic\r\n     subjects. The fear of this country's being able at this moment\r\n     to work the Catholic element in Germany or elsewhere against the\r\n     German Emperor appears to me to be chimerical.\r\n\r\n     I wish the Germans would get their milliards as fast as they\r\n     can, and go: then Europe might settle down, and they need not be\r\n     alarmed about French vengeance, or grudge the French the poor\r\n     consolation of talking about it.\r\n\r\n     Arnim was a good deal struck by the decline in Thiers's\r\n     vigour, since he took leave of him before his journey to Rome, but\r\n     he saw Thiers some days ago, when the little President was at his\r\n     worst.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Odo Russell to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    British Embassy, Berlin, May 11, 1872.\r\n\r\n     I have nothing new to say about the relations of France and\r\n     Germany, but my friends here seem so alarmed at the idea that\r\n     France cannot pay the much longed for three milliards, that if\r\n     Thiers really does pay them, all the rest will be forgiven and\r\n     forgotten, and the withdrawal of the German troops will then be\r\n     impatiently called for. Like yourself I write the impressions of\r\n     the moment and am not answerable for future changes of public\r\n     opinion. Clearly the thing to be desired for the peace of the world\r\n     is the payment by France and the withdrawal by Germany, after which\r\n     a normal state of things can be hoped for--not before.\r\n\r\n     The Pope, to my mind, has made a mistake in declining to\r\n     receive Hohenlohe. He ought to have accepted and in return sent a\r\n     Nuncio to Berlin, thereby selling Bismarck, and controlling his\r\n     German Bishops and the Döllinger movement.\r\n\r\n     Bismarck is going away on leave to Varzin. He is so irritable\r\n     and nervous that he can do no good here at present, and rest is\r\n     essential to him.\r\n\r\n     Your letter of the 7th is most useful to me, many thanks for\r\n     it. I shall not fail to keep you as well informed as I can.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the Germans made little difficulty about the arrangements\r\nfor the payment of the indemnity and evacuation of French territory, and\r\nearly in July Thiers was able to state confidently that he felt certain\r\nof being able to pay the whole of the indemnity by March, 1874, and\r\nthat he had only obtained an additional year's grace in order to guard\r\nagainst accidents.\r\n\r\nA curious incident which occurred in July, 1872, showed how, if\r\nsufficient ingenuity be employed, a trivial personal question may\r\nbe turned to important political use. The Comte de Vogué, French\r\nAmbassador at Constantinople, who possessed little or no diplomatic\r\nexperience, before proceeding on leave from his post, had an audience\r\nof the Sultan. The Sultan received him standing, and began to talk,\r\nwhen Vogué interrupted His Majesty, and begged to be allowed to sit\r\ndown, as other Ambassadors had been accustomed to do, according to him,\r\non similar occasions. What the Sultan actually did at the moment was\r\nnot disclosed, but he took dire offence, and telegrams began to pour\r\nin upon the Turkish Ambassador at Paris desiring him to represent to\r\nthe French Government that if Vogué came back his position would be\r\nvery unpleasant--intimating in fact that his return to Constantinople\r\nmust be prevented. The French Foreign Minister, however, refused this\r\nsatisfaction to the Sultan, and the Turkish Ambassador in his perplexity\r\nsought the advice of Lord Lyons, who preached conciliation, and urged\r\nthat, at all events, no steps ought to be taken until Vogué had arrived\r\nat Paris, and was able to give his version of the incident. The French,\r\nnaturally enough, were at that moment peculiarly susceptible on all\r\nsuch matters, and more reluctant to make a concession than if they\r\nwere still on their former pinnacle of grandeur at Constantinople,\r\nalthough Vogué was clearly in the wrong, for Lord Lyons admitted that\r\nhe had himself never been asked to sit. The importance of the incident\r\nconsisted in the fact that it gave an opportunity of cultivating the\r\ngoodwill of Russia, as the traditional enemy of Turkey. No Frenchman\r\nhad ever lost sight of the hope that some day or other an ally against\r\nGermany might be found in Russia, and there were not wanting signs of a\r\nreciprocal feeling on the part of the latter. It had, for instance, been\r\nthe subject of much remark, that the Russian Ambassador at Paris, Prince\r\nOrloff, had recently been making immense efforts to become popular\r\nwith all classes of the French: Legitimists, Orleanists, Imperialists,\r\nRepublicans, and especially newspaper writers of all shades of politics.\r\nAs it was well known that neither Prince nor Princess Orloff were really\r\nfond of society, these efforts were almost overdone, but nevertheless\r\nthey met with a hearty response everywhere, from Thiers downwards,\r\nfor all Frenchmen were eagerly hoping for a quarrel between Russia\r\nand Germany, and were ready to throw themselves into the arms of the\r\nformer in that hope. Russia, on her side, was clearly not unwilling to\r\ncultivate a friendship which cost nothing, and might conceivably be of\r\nconsiderable profit.\r\n\r\nOn November 5 the new Anglo-French Commercial Treaty was signed,\r\nindignant British Free Traders striving to console themselves with the\r\nthought that France would soon discover the error of her ways and cease\r\nto lag behind the rest of the civilized world in her economic heresy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Nov. 12, 1872.\r\n\r\n     I saw Thiers on Friday after I wrote to you on that day; and\r\n     I dined with him on Saturday. He looked remarkably well, and was\r\n     in high spirits and in great good humour, as he ought to be, with\r\n     us. He spoke, as indeed he always does, as if he felt quite sure\r\n     that he should have his own way with the Assembly in all things.\r\n     As regards the organic measures, he talked as if the fight would\r\n     be entirely with the Right; but both sections of the Left have\r\n     declared against organic changes to be made by this Assembly. I\r\n     suppose, however, Thiers is pretty sure to get his own powers\r\n     prolonged for four years certain, and this is what he cares about.\r\n\r\n     I do not, however, find in my Austrian, German, and Russian\r\n     colleagues so unqualified an acquiescence in Thiers remaining\r\n     in power as they professed before I went away. It is said that\r\n     the three Emperors at Berlin were alarmed at the prospect of the\r\n     definitive establishment of any Republic, and still more so at\r\n     the apparent tendency of M. Thiers's policy to leave the country\r\n     to drift into a Red Republic, whenever he quitted the scene.\r\n     However this may be, there is certainly a change in the language\r\n     of their Representatives here, not very marked, but nevertheless\r\n     quite perceptible. Orloff in particular talks as if an immediate\r\n     Imperialist restoration were not only desirable but probable. If he\r\n     really thinks it probable, he is almost alone in the opinion.\r\n\r\n     The Prince de Joinville, who came to see me yesterday,\r\n     said that he had been a great deal about in the country, and\r\n     that he found everywhere an absolute indifference to persons\r\n     and dynasties, and a simple cry for any Government which would\r\n     efficiently protect property. He thought that Thiers would be\r\n     supported for this reason, but that whatever institutions might\r\n     be nominally established, they would last only as long as Thiers\r\n     himself did, and that afterwards everything would be in question,\r\n     and the country probably divide itself into two great parties,\r\n     Conservatives and Reds, between whom there would be a fierce\r\n     struggle notwithstanding the great numerical superiority of the\r\n     former.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of exciting internal topics, the year closed with a\r\nslight sensation provided by Gramont, who, it might have been supposed,\r\nwould have preferred not to court further notoriety. Count Beust had\r\nrecently asserted that he had warned France against expecting help\r\nfrom Austria in the event of a war with Prussia. Gramont replied\r\nby publishing a letter in which the following statement occurred.\r\n'L'Autriche considère la cause de la France comme la sienne, et\r\ncontribuera au succès de ses armes dans les limites du possible.'\r\nThis quotation was supposed to be taken from a letter from Beust to\r\nMetternich, dated July 20, 1870 (the day after the declaration of war),\r\nand left by Metternich with Gramont, who took a copy and returned the\r\noriginal. Metternich was believed to have shown the letter also to the\r\nEmperor Napoleon and to Ollivier. The letter was represented as going on\r\nto say that the neutrality proclaimed by Austria was merely a blind to\r\nconceal her armaments, and that she was only waiting till the advance of\r\nwinter rendered it impossible for Russia to concentrate her forces.\r\n\r\nIt was generally believed that there was plenty of evidence that an\r\noffensive and defensive alliance was in course of negotiation between\r\nFrance and Austria in 1869, though no treaty was signed, and the record\r\nappears to have consisted in letters exchanged between the two Emperors,\r\nbut as Gramont had nothing more than a copy of a letter from Beust to\r\nMetternich his evidence was legally defective, whatever its moral\r\nvalue, and it was questionable whether as an ex-Minister he had any\r\nright to disclose such secrets.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Dec. 31, 1872.\r\n\r\n     Gramont's further revelations confirm what I told you in my\r\n     letter of the 24th. The question is becoming tiresome. I conceive\r\n     there is no doubt that Beust at Vienna, and Metternich here,\r\n     fanned the flame of French discontent after Sadowa, with a view\r\n     to avenging themselves when Austria and France should be ready,\r\n     and circumstances favourable. I think also that Gramont came back\r\n     from Vienna full of Beust's warlike ideas, and very well inclined\r\n     to carry them out. What exchange of letters may have taken place\r\n     between the two Emperors, or what record of any kind there may be\r\n     of engagements between the two countries to help one another, it is\r\n     more difficult to say.\r\n\r\n     The assertion is that after war had been declared, Austria\r\n     engaged to move on the 15th September. Others say that she also\r\n     required that France should have an army in Baden.\r\n\r\n     This is not inconsistent with her having dissuaded France from\r\n     war in July, 1870, when she knew positively it would be premature\r\n     for herself, and probably had some suspicion that France was also\r\n     not really prepared.\r\n\r\nEarly in January, 1873, the Emperor Napoleon died at Chiselhurst. The\r\nview of Thiers was that this event would render the Bonapartists, for\r\nthe time, more turbulent and less dangerous. He believed that the\r\nEmperor's personal influence had been used to quiet the impatience\r\nof his followers, while, on the other hand, his death removed the\r\nonly member of the family who was popular enough in France to be a\r\nformidable candidate. Thiers's childish susceptibility with regard to\r\nthe Bonapartists showed itself in his expressed hope that the Emperor's\r\ndeath would be followed by the disappearance of the public sympathy in\r\nEngland with the family in its misfortunes.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of Thiers seem to have been generally prevalent. The\r\nEmperor was remarkably kind and courteous to all who approached him; he\r\nwas a firm friend; not, as a rule, an implacable enemy, and he inspired\r\nno small number of people with a warm attachment to him personally. He\r\nwas also generally popular, and the glittering prosperity of the early\r\npart of his reign was attributed by a large part of the common people\r\nto his own genius and merits, while they were prone to consider that\r\nits disastrous close was due to treason. No other member of the family\r\nexcited feelings of the same kind, and in France a cause was always so\r\nlargely identified with an individual that there was no doubt that the\r\nhold of the Imperialists upon the country was largely weakened by the\r\nloss of their chief.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps worth noting that Lord Lyons, although it was notoriously\r\ndifficult to extract any such opinions from him, did in after years\r\nadmit reluctantly to me, that although he liked Napoleon III.\r\npersonally, he had always put a low estimate upon his capacity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Jan. 31, 1873.\r\n\r\n     I cannot say that the political atmosphere grows clearer. The\r\n     Right are in their hearts as anxious as ever to depose Thiers.\r\n     They believe as firmly as ever that if he makes the new elections,\r\n     he will have a Chamber, not only of Republicans, but of very\r\n     advanced Republicans. They see that all their little endeavours to\r\n     restrain him and to establish ministerial responsibility will have\r\n     no political effect. The death of the Emperor has not strengthened\r\n     Thiers's position with regard to the Right. On the contrary,\r\n     they are less disposed to bear with him since the removal of the\r\n     candidate for the Throne of whom they were most afraid, and from\r\n     whom they justly thought that Thiers would make every effort to\r\n     shield them. They are consequently, even more than they usually\r\n     are, employed in casting about for something to put in Thiers's\r\n     place. The Fusion is again 'almost' made, and MacMahon is again\r\n     talked of as ready to take the Government during the transition\r\n     from the Republic to the King.\r\n\r\n     Orloff, the Russian Ambassador, propounded to me to-day a plan\r\n     of his own for preventing conflicts between Russia and England\r\n     in Central Asia. So far as I understood it, it was that England\r\n     and Russia should enter into a strict alliance, should encourage\r\n     and protect, by force of arms, commerce between their Asiatic\r\n     Dominions, and unite them at once by a railroad. He said there\r\n     was a Russian company already formed which desired to connect the\r\n     Russian railway system with the Anglo-Indian railways. He told me\r\n     that Brünnow was always writing that war between England and Russia\r\n     was imminent and that England was preparing for it. If Brünnow's\r\n     vaticinations are believed, they may perhaps have a not unwholesome\r\n     effect upon the Russian Government.\r\n\r\nPrince Orloff seems to have had in contemplation that Trans-Persian\r\nRailway which has met with the approval of the Russian and British\r\nGovernments at the present day. The Russian advance in Central Asia\r\nin 1872 and 1873 had been the subject of various perfectly futile\r\nrepresentations on the part of Her Majesty's Government, but Baron\r\nBrünnow must have been a singularly credulous diplomatist if he really\r\nbelieved that we were making preparations for a war with Russia or any\r\none else.\r\n\r\nIf Orloff with prophetic insight foresaw a Trans-Persian Railway, Thiers\r\nmight be acclaimed as being the first person to suggest the project of\r\nthe Triple Entente between England, France, and Russia. Strangely enough\r\nit was the affairs of Spain that put this notion into his head, the idea\r\nprevalent in France being that Germany was bent on making that country a\r\ndangerous neighbour to France, and bestowing a Hohenzollern prince upon\r\nher as sovereign. The prospect of an 'Iberic Union,' which was being\r\ndiscussed at the time, was considered to be exceptionally threatening to\r\nFrance, and Thiers had had quite enough of united states on the French\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 4, 1873.\r\n\r\n     M. Thiers spoke to me last night very confidentially about\r\n     Spain and Portugal. The Spanish question was, he said, becoming so\r\n     serious that it could hardly be considered an internal question.\r\n     Among other things, the independence of Portugal was at stake. Now,\r\n     in his opinion, the best chance of avoiding a collision between the\r\n     Powers of Europe would be that England, France, and Russia should\r\n     come to an understanding on the subject. He did not think that\r\n     there would be any difficulty in effecting such an understanding;\r\n     and indeed he had reason to believe that Russia was at this moment\r\n     particularly well disposed to act in concert with England. He was\r\n     far from being so absurd as to propose a new Holy Alliance; indeed,\r\n     he desired to avoid all show and ostentation--indeed all publicity.\r\n     He simply wished that, without any parade, the three Powers he had\r\n     named should concert measures in order to avert events which might\r\n     imperil the peace of Europe. After some further conversation, he\r\n     observed that it would be impossible to avert a collision, if the\r\n     Peninsula were formed into one Iberic state with a Hohenzollern for\r\n     a monarch.\r\n\r\n     I did not invite M. Thiers to state more definitely in what\r\n     form he proposed that the understanding between France, Russia, and\r\n     England should be effected, or what combined action he proposed\r\n     they should adopt. I thought indeed that it would be very dangerous\r\n     for France to enter into any sort of an alliance with Foreign\r\n     Powers against Germany at this moment, and that the smallest result\r\n     might be to delay the evacuation of French territory. Nor indeed\r\n     did I know that there was any evidence that Germany was actively\r\n     pursuing designs in Spain in such a way and to such a degree,\r\n     as would render it proper or advantageous to try the hazardous\r\n     experiment of undertaking to settle a European question without\r\n     her, not to say in spite of her.\r\n\r\n     I consequently only listened to what M. Thiers said. He\r\n     concluded by telling me to treat his idea as most strictly\r\n     confidential and to confide it only to your ear in a whisper.\r\n\r\n     As regards the state of Spain, M. Thiers said that he believed\r\n     the Federal Party was after all the party of order; that at all\r\n     events it was predominant in all the outer circumference of\r\n     Spain; that the Unitarians existed only in Madrid and the central\r\n     provinces, and that the North was Carlist or Federal. This being\r\n     the case, his advice to the Government of Madrid had been to make\r\n     concessions to the Federals. He did not think that, if properly\r\n     managed, their pretensions would go much beyond what was called in\r\n     France 'decentralisation administrative.'\r\n\r\n     The view of the Federals being the party of order in Spain\r\n     was new to me, but M. Thiers was beset by a host of deputies and I\r\n     could not continue the conversation.\r\n\r\nA letter from Lord Odo Russell[6] to Lord Lyons admirably defines\r\nthe attitude of Germany, and is an exceptionally lucid summary of\r\nBismarckian policy in general.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    British Embassy, Berlin, March 14, 1873.\r\n\r\n     Thanks for yours of the 4th instant.\r\n\r\n     As regards Spain, Thiers, and Bismarck I cannot add anything\r\n     more definite or more precise. Bismarck and the Emperor William\r\n     are so far satisfied that the Republic will make room for the\r\n     Alphonsists so that they can afford to wait and look on.\r\n\r\n     What Bismarck intends for Spain later, no one can guess, but\r\n     clearly nothing favourable or agreeable to France.\r\n\r\n     The two great objects of Bismarck's policy are:\r\n\r\n     (1) The supremacy of Germany in Europe and of the German race\r\n     in the world.\r\n\r\n     (2) The neutralization of the influence and power of the Latin\r\n     race in France and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n     To obtain these objects he will go any lengths while he lives,\r\n     so that we must be prepared for surprises in the future.\r\n\r\n     A change has come over the Emperor and his military advisers\r\n     in regard to the evacuation of French territory, as you have seen\r\n     by his speech on opening the German Parliament.\r\n\r\n     His Majesty is now prepared to withdraw his garrison as soon\r\n     as the fifth and last milliard shall have been paid by Paris and\r\n     received at Berlin.\r\n\r\n     So that if it is true that Thiers proposes to pay the fifth\r\n     milliard in monthly instalments of 250,000,000 fs. beginning from\r\n     the 1st of June, the evacuation might be expected in October and\r\n     France be relieved of her nightmare.\r\n\r\n     This I look upon as a most desirable object. It appears to\r\n     me that the re-establishment of the future balance of power in\r\n     Europe on a general peace footing, is _the_ thing Diplomacy should\r\n     work for, and that nothing can be done so long as the Germans have\r\n     not got their French gold, and the French got rid of their German\r\n     soldiers.\r\n\r\n     The Germans, as you know, look upon the war of revenge as\r\n     unavoidable and are making immense preparations for it.\r\n\r\n     Germany is in reality a great camp ready to break up for any\r\n     war at a week's notice with a million of men.\r\n\r\n     We are out of favour with the Germans for preferring the old\r\n     French alliance to a new German one, as our commercial policy is\r\n     said to prove, and this impression has been lately confirmed by\r\n     Thiers's _exposé des motifs_.\r\n\r\n     Thiers is again out of favour at Berlin, because the Russian\r\n     Government has warned the German Government that Thiers is working\r\n     to draw Russia into the Anglo-French Alliance contrary to their\r\n     wishes. I believe myself that the alliance or understanding between\r\n     Russia and Germany, Gortschakoff and Bismarck is real, intimate, and\r\n     sincere; and that they have agreed to preserve Austria so long as\r\n     she obeys and serves them, but woe to Austria if ever she attempts\r\n     to be independent!\r\n\r\n     Then the German and Slav elements she is composed of, will be\r\n     made to gravitate towards their natural centres, leaving Hungary\r\n     and her dependencies as a semi-oriental vassal of Germany and\r\n     Russia. However, those are things of the future, at present I can\r\n     think of nothing but the crisis at home and the deep regret I feel\r\n     at losing my kind benefactor Lord Granville as a chief. My only\r\n     consolation is that he will the sooner return to power as our\r\n     Premier, for he is clearly the man of the future.\r\n\r\n     I hope you will write again occasionally.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord O. Russell._\r\n\r\n    Paris, April 8, 1873.\r\n\r\n     Many thanks for your most interesting letter of the 14th. I\r\n     entirely agree with you that the one object of diplomacy should be\r\n     to re-establish the balance of power in Europe on a peace footing.\r\n     The payment of the indemnity and the departure of the German troops\r\n     from France are of course necessary to the commencement of anything\r\n     like a normal state of things. The French all more or less brood\r\n     over the hope of vengeance, and the Germans give them credit for\r\n     being even more bent upon revenge than they really are. So Germany\r\n     keeps up an enormous army, and France strains every nerve to raise\r\n     one; and what can diplomatists do?\r\n\r\n     In Germany they seem to attach a great deal more than due\r\n     importance to the Commercial Treaty, as a sign of a tendency\r\n     towards a renewal of the Anglo-French Alliance. But then the\r\n     Germans have always been more angry with us for not helping to blot\r\n     France out of Europe than the French have been with us for not\r\n     helping them out of the scrape they got into by their own fault.\r\n     Germans and French are to my mind alike unreasonable, but we only\r\n     suffer the ordinary fate of neutrals.\r\n\r\n     Thiers professes to have no thought of forming any alliance at\r\n     present; and to consider that it would be absurd of France to try\r\n     for more at this moment than to ward off great questions, and live\r\n     as harmoniously as she can with all Foreign Powers, without showing\r\n     a preference to any. This is no doubt the wise and sensible policy.\r\n     Thiers certainly acts upon it so far as England is concerned. Does\r\n     he also act upon it as regards Russia? I cannot say. I think there\r\n     is a little coquetry between him and the Russians.\r\n\r\nLord Granville appears to have sent through the Duchesse de Galliera\r\na private message warning Thiers of the dangers of his advances to\r\nRussia; but the latter asserted that although the French Ambassador at\r\nSt. Petersburg had been directed to maintain the most cordial relations\r\nwith the Russian Government, matters had not gone further than that, and\r\nthat he had made no communications which he should object to Germany\r\nknowing of. Thiers's tenure of power was, however, destined shortly to\r\ncome to an end. On May 24, the veteran who had rendered such invaluable\r\nservices to the country was defeated by a combination of opponents, and\r\nMarshal MacMahon became President of the Republic in his stead. The\r\nchange of Government was received quietly by the country; the elaborate\r\nprecautions which had been taken in case of disorder proved superfluous,\r\nand the funds rose on the assumption that the Marshal was to prove to\r\nbe the new saviour of society. MacMahon, who had reluctantly accepted\r\nthe honour thrust upon him, was generally regarded as a French General\r\nMonk, but which of the three pretenders was to be his Charles the Second\r\nremained a matter of complete uncertainty. The fickle crowd hastened to\r\nprostrate itself before the rising sun, and the first reception held by\r\nthe new President at Versailles constituted a veritable triumph; swarms\r\nof people of all sorts attending, particularly those members of smart\r\nsociety who had long deserted the salons of the Préfecture. Amongst the\r\nthrong were particularly noticeable the Duc d'Aumale and his brothers,\r\nwearing uniform and the red ribands which they had never been known to\r\ndisplay before. All looked smooth and tranquil, as it usually did at\r\nthe beginning; but the Government so far had not done anything beyond\r\nchanging Prefects and Procureurs. The political situation, for the time\r\nbeing, might be summed up in the phrase that the French preferred to\r\nhave at their head a man _qui monte à cheval_, rather than a man _qui\r\nmonte à la tribune_.\r\n\r\nAlthough the dismissal of Thiers savoured of ingratitude, it was not\r\naltogether unfortunate for him that he had quitted office at that\r\nparticular moment, for little doubt was felt that, with or without any\r\nerror of policy on his own part, the country was gradually drifting\r\ntowards communism. At any rate, he could compare with just pride the\r\nstate in which he left France to the state in which he found her.\r\nAlthough the last German soldier had not yet left French soil, the\r\ncredit of the liberation of the country was due to him, and by his\r\nfinancial operations, successful beyond all expectations, he had not\r\nonly paid off four milliards, but provided the funds for discharging\r\nthe fifth, and so admirably conducted the negotiations that the German\r\nGovernment was willing to withdraw the rest of the occupying force.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Thiers caused searchings of heart at Berlin, and a\r\nconversation with Count Arnim, the German Ambassador at Paris, in June\r\nshowed that the German Government regarded MacMahon with anything but\r\nfavour. Arnim stated that displeasure had been felt at Berlin, both\r\nat language held by the Marshal before his appointment, and at his\r\nneglect in his former position to act with proper courtesy towards the\r\nEmperor's Ambassador in France. The German Government did not doubt that\r\nthe remainder of the indemnity would be paid, but Thiers indulged less\r\nthan other Frenchmen in hostile feelings towards Germany, and he and a\r\nfew of the people about him seemed to be the only Frenchmen who could\r\nbring themselves to act with propriety and civility in their relations\r\nwith Germans. In fact, Thiers's foreign policy had been wise and\r\nconciliatory, but as for his internal policy, he, Count Arnim, avowed\r\nthat he entirely concurred in the opinion that it would have thrown the\r\ncountry in a short time into the hands of the Red Republicans.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Arnim was apparently at this time unconscious of his\r\nimpending doom, although, as the following interesting letter from Lord\r\nOdo Russell to Lord Lyons shows, his fate had been sealed months before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _British Embassy, Berlin, Jan. 18, 1873._\r\n\r\n     What I have to say to-day grieves me to the soul, because it\r\n     goes against my excellent friend and landlord Harry Arnim.\r\n\r\n     Said friend, it is said, could not resist the temptation of\r\n     turning an honest penny in the great War Indemnity Loan at Paris,\r\n     and the Jew Banker he employed, called Hanseman, let it out to\r\n     Bismarck, who could not understand how Arnim was rich enough to buy\r\n     estates in Silesia and houses in Berlin.\r\n\r\n     Now Bismarck, who is tired of Arnim, and thinks him a rising\r\n     rival, will make use of this discovery with the Emperor whenever he\r\n     wants to upset Arnim and send a new man to Paris.\r\n\r\n     He thinks him a rising rival because Arnim went to Baden\r\n     last autumn and advised the Emperor, behind Bismarck's back, to\r\n     go in for an Orleanist Monarchy and drop Thiers, in opposition to\r\n     Bismarck's policy, who wishes to drop all Pretenders and uphold\r\n     Thiers as long as he lives.\r\n\r\n     Besides which Arnim hinted at a readiness to take office at\r\n     home if Bismarck came to grief.\r\n\r\n     The Emperor is fond of Arnim and listened with complacency and\r\n     told Bismarck when he returned from Varzin,--Bismarck has vowed\r\n     revenge! I have not written all this home because it would serve\r\n     no purpose yet,--but it may be useful to you as a peep behind the\r\n     curtain. Meanwhile Bismarck has appointed one of his _secret_\r\n     agents as Commercial Secretary to the Paris Embassy to watch Arnim.\r\n     His name is Lindau and as he is a very able man and an old friend\r\n     of mine, I have given him a letter to you. He might become useful\r\n     some day.\r\n\r\n     Let me add _in confidence_ that he corresponds privately and\r\n     secretly with Bismarck behind Arnim's back.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the views expressed by Arnim to Lord Lyons in\r\nJune are not altogether consistent with those attributed to him in the\r\nabove letter, but Lord Odo Russell's opinion that his implacable chief\r\nwould crush him at the first opportunity was only too well justified\r\nbefore long.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: June, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: German Ambassador at Paris.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Foreign Minister in succession to M.

The historic White Flag manifesto issued from Salzburg at the\r\nend of October effectually ruined the Legitimist cause.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Oct. 31, 1873.\r\n\r\n     The Royalists were counting up new adhesions and expecting a\r\n     letter from the Comte de Chambord which was to be read from the\r\n     tribune at the last moment and rally the waiters upon Providence\r\n     and the waverers to them, when, to their utter consternation,\r\n     the actual letter arrived, and fell like a shell with a violent\r\n     explosion in the midst of them.\r\n\r\n     I don't know what they are to do. All plans for making the\r\n     Comte de Paris or the Duc d'Aumale Regent will be voted against\r\n     by the present Legitimists, unless the Comte de Chambord approves\r\n     them. It is very doubtful whether any explanation could do away\r\n     with the impression the letter will have produced throughout the\r\n     country, which was already averse from the idea of the Legitimist\r\n     King.\r\n\r\n     The maintenance of MacMahon and the present Ministry seems the\r\n     best mode of postponing trouble, but it cannot do much more than\r\n     postpone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Nov. 3, 1873.\r\n\r\n     If the Chamber met to-morrow, I suppose it would vote the\r\n     prolongation of MacMahon's powers; and though no one can answer\r\n     for what a day or an hour may bring forth, I suppose this is what\r\n     must be done. It is said that the Marshal himself insists upon a\r\n     term of six years, if not ten. This is rather hard to understand,\r\n     if, as I believed, he really wished to be out of the thing, and I\r\n     doubt its adding practically to the stability of his Government.\r\n     On the other hand, the Conservatives want to have the prolongation\r\n     voted in such a way as to make it apparent that MacMahon is _their_\r\n     President. It would not suit them that he should be elected\r\n     unanimously, or nearly so, as he perhaps might be. This would put\r\n     him, they think, in a position too like that which Thiers held. The\r\n     preposterous notion of making a Lieutenant General of the Kingdom\r\n     to govern in the name of a King of full age and in possession of\r\n     all his faculties, who would undoubtedly repudiate and denounce\r\n     his representative, has been put an end to by the refusal of the\r\n     Princes of Orleans, one and all, it is affirmed, to accept the post.\r\n\r\n     Thiers told me the day before yesterday that he did not\r\n     intend to oppose the Government this session, and that we might\r\n     count on a quiet winter. We shall see.\r\n\r\n     The Legitimists are furious with their King, as well they\r\n     may be. How long this may last, one cannot say, but the numbers\r\n     of those who adore him _quand même_, as a sort of fetish, have\r\n     certainly fallen off.\r\n\r\nMacMahon had been as much disappointed with the Chambord manifesto as\r\nthe ultra-Legitimists themselves, and had looked forward to retiring\r\nfrom a position which he found distasteful; but as no king was\r\navailable, and he was looked upon as the only guarantee for order,\r\nobviously the best course was to secure the prolongation of his powers\r\nfor as long a period as possible. After many long and stormy discussions\r\nMacMahon was declared President of the Republic for seven years, and a\r\ncommittee of thirty was appointed to consider the Constitutional Laws.\r\nThis result was so far satisfactory to the Right, that it enabled them\r\nto retire from the dangerous position in which they were placed by\r\nthe attempt to put the Comte de Chambord on the throne, but it failed\r\nto establish a durable Government, and the whole period of MacMahon's\r\nPresidency was marked by a ceaseless struggle with his Republican\r\nopponents, which only terminated with his fall four years later.\r\n\r\nThe anxieties of French Ministers were, however, not confined to\r\ninternal difficulties. Although the fact was concealed as much as\r\npossible, the anti-Ultramontane campaign of Bismarck created serious\r\nalarm in the beginning of 1874, and in that year may be said to have\r\noriginated the long series of panics, well or ill founded, which have\r\nprevailed in France ever since. MacMahon in conversation did not scruple\r\nto express his fear of a country which, according to him, could\r\nplace 800,000 men on the Rhine in less than seventeen days, and made\r\nthe interesting confession that the French military authorities had\r\nnever credited the famous reports of Colonel Stoffel[7] as to Prussian\r\nmilitary efficiency. The Foreign Minister, the Duc Décazes, expressed\r\nthe strongest apprehensions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Jan. 17, 1874.\r\n\r\n     The fall of France has never, I think, been brought so\r\n     forcibly home to me, as when I listened yesterday to the humble\r\n     deprecation which Décazes was obliged to make with regard to\r\n     Bismarck's threats, in the same room in which I had so often heard\r\n     the high language with which the Imperial Minister used to speak of\r\n     the affairs of Europe. One can only hope that Odo may be right in\r\n     thinking that Bismarck's menaces may subside, when he has carried\r\n     his Army Bill at home. But may not his eagerness in his contest\r\n     with the Ultramontanes continue and carry him on to language and\r\n     even to measures against France from which it may be difficult for\r\n     him to draw back? and of course there is a limit to the submission\r\n     of the French Government, however disastrous it may know the\r\n     consequences of resistance to be. It is difficult to persecute\r\n     any religion in these days, but it is impossible for the French\r\n     Government to set itself in violent opposition to the predominant\r\n     religion in France. I do not know what means we may have of getting\r\n     pacific and moderate counsels listened to at Berlin, but I do\r\n     not think the weakness of France a sufficient safeguard to other\r\n     countries against the perils of the present state of things to the\r\n     peace of Europe. It may be very easy to bully and to crush France,\r\n     but will it be possible to do this without raising a storm in other\r\n     quarters?\r\n\r\nWhat Bismarck wanted was that the French Government should attack the\r\nFrench bishops; and in order to conciliate him, a circular was issued\r\nby the Minister of the Interior remonstrating with them on the nature\r\nof the language in which their pastoral addresses were couched. The\r\nwell-known clerical newspaper the _Univers_ was suppressed, and although\r\nevery effort was made to disguise the various acts of subserviency\r\nresorted to, it was perfectly well known to what cause they were due,\r\nand it was not surprising that the French writhed under the necessity\r\nof submitting to such dictation. In view of the military weakness\r\nof France, however, it was useless to think of resistance, the Duc\r\nd'Aumale, who commanded the most vulnerable district, having reported\r\nconfidentially that there were neither fortresses nor an army which\r\nwould have any chance of repelling a German invasion; added to which,\r\nowing to considerations of economy, the conscription was six months in\r\narrear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Odo Russell._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Feb. 3, 1874.\r\n\r\n     The French want above all things to keep the peace, or, to put\r\n     it otherwise, to escape being attacked by Germany in their present\r\n     defenceless state. What, in your opinion, should they do? Of course\r\n     the temptation to the unprincipled war party in Germany to attack\r\n     them while they are unable to defend themselves, is very great;\r\n     and that party must know that a war this year would be much less\r\n     hazardous than one next year, and so on, as each year passes.\r\n\r\n     The next question I want your advice upon is what, if\r\n     anything, can other Powers, and particularly England, do to help to\r\n     preserve peace? This is a question peculiarly within your province,\r\n     as the one thing to be considered in answering it, is the effect\r\n     that anything we do may have at Berlin.\r\n\r\n     I am not very hopeful, but I think the chances of peace will\r\n     be very much increased if we can tide over this year 1874.\r\n\r\n     I can see no consolation for a fresh war. I suppose Bismarck\r\n     would be ready to buy the neutrality of Russia with Constantinople,\r\n     and that France will give Russia _anything_ even for a little help.\r\n\r\n     The Emperor Alexander has told General Le Flô[8] at St.\r\n     Petersburg that there will not be war. Do you attach much\r\n     importance to this?\r\n\r\n     You will call this a _questionnaire_ rather than a letter, but\r\n     if you have anything to catechise me upon in return, I will answer\r\n     to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\n     The Lyttons' are, as you may suppose, a very great pleasure to\r\n     me, and they have had a great success here.\r\n\r\nNo one was better fitted than Lord Odo Russell, who was a _persona\r\ngrata_ with Bismarck, to answer these queries. The Emperor Alexander had\r\nbeen very emphatic in assuring General Le Flô on several occasions that\r\nthere would be no war, but Lord Odo was in all probability quite correct\r\nin his opinion that this was no real safeguard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Odo Russell to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Berlin, Feb. 20, 1874.\r\n\r\n     I was glad after a long interval to see your handwriting\r\n     again, and doubly glad to find you inclined to renew our\r\n     correspondence. You ask: _Firstly_, What in my opinion should the\r\n     French do to escape being attacked by Germany in their present\r\n     defenceless state?\r\n\r\n     In my opinion nothing can save them _if_ Bismarck is\r\n     determined to fight them again; but then, is it France or is it\r\n     Austria he is preparing to annihilate? In Bismarck's opinion,\r\n     France, to avoid a conflict with him, should gag her press,\r\n     imprison her bishops, quarrel with Rome, refrain from making\r\n     an army or from seeking alliances with other Powers all out of\r\n     deference to Germany.\r\n\r\n     _Secondly._ What can other Powers, and particularly England,\r\n     do to help to preserve peace?\r\n\r\n     A Coalition is impossible; advice or interference adds to\r\n     Bismarck's excuses for going to war, so the only course Governments\r\n     can follow is to let him do as he pleases and submit to the\r\n     consequences, until he dies.\r\n\r\n     _Thirdly._ Do I attach any importance to the Emperor of\r\n     Russia's pacific assurances?\r\n\r\n     None whatever, because Bismarck is prepared to buy his\r\n     co-operation with anything he pleases in the East.\r\n\r\n     Bismarck is now master of the situation at home and abroad.\r\n     The Emperor, the Ministers, the Army, the Press, and the National\r\n     majority in Parliament are instruments in his hands, whilst abroad\r\n     he can so bribe the great Powers as to prevent a coalition and make\r\n     them subservient to his policy. Now, his policy, as you know, is\r\n     to mediatize the minor States of Germany and to annex the German\r\n     Provinces of Austria, so as to make one great centralized Power\r\n     of the German-speaking portions of Europe. To accomplish this he\r\n     may require another war, but it may be with Austria and not with\r\n     France, which he now puts forward to keep up the war spirit of the\r\n     Germans and to remind Europe of his powers. Besides which he has to\r\n     pass the unpopular Army Bill and War Budget which he failed in last\r\n     summer.\r\n\r\n     His anti-Roman policy will serve him to pick a quarrel with\r\n     any Power he pleases by declaring that he has discovered an\r\n     anti-German conspiracy among the clergy of the country he wishes to\r\n     fight.\r\n\r\n     Such is the situation, but it does not follow that we shall\r\n     have war before another year or two are over or more, nor need we\r\n     have war _if_ Bismarck can carry out his plans without it.\r\n\r\n     At present the tone of Bismarck and Bülow is quite pacific,\r\n     and I notice a great desire for the co-operation of England in\r\n     maintaining the peace of Europe generally.\r\n\r\nLord Lyons's own opinions were in exact agreement with Lord Odo\r\nRussell's, and the general uncertainty as to Bismarck's intentions\r\ncontinued to preoccupy both the French and the English Governments,\r\nalthough the Emperor of Russia persisted in assuring General Le Flô that\r\nthere would be no war, and it was assumed in some quarters that the\r\nGerman Emperor disapproved of the Bismarckian policy.\r\n\r\nThe general election in England at the beginning of 1874, resulting in\r\nthe return of the Conservative party to power, placed Lord Derby again\r\nat the Foreign Office in the room of Lord Granville, and the long letter\r\nwhich follows was presumably intended to enlighten him on the subject of\r\nFrench politics generally. It is, at all events, a concise review of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Derby._\r\n\r\n    Feb. 24, 1874.\r\n\r\n     I thank you cordially for your letter of yesterday, and I\r\n     resume with very peculiar satisfaction my diplomatic correspondence\r\n     with you. I wish the subject of it was as pleasant to me as is the\r\n     fact of its renewal; but I cannot help being more than usually\r\n     anxious about the prospects of Europe and of France in particular.\r\n     This spring and summer are the especially critical seasons for\r\n     France. She will be for a long time to come far too weak to indulge\r\n     in aggression, except indeed as a secondary ally of some stronger\r\n     Power, but even next year, she will not be in the absolutely\r\n     helpless condition which is at this moment so strong a temptation\r\n     to national hatreds, and to the military thirst for gold and glory\r\n     which prevails with a party in Germany. I am afraid the peace of\r\n     Europe depends entirely upon the view Bismarck may take of the\r\n     easiest means of bringing all German-speaking nations under one\r\n     rule. The wolf can always find reasons for quarrelling with the\r\n     lamb, and as Bismarck himself told Odo Russell, he has had a good\r\n     deal of experience of this kind of thing. The French lamb will not\r\n     be skittish, and indeed will hardly venture to bleat, for some\r\n     time. For my own part, I am constantly on the watch to forestall\r\n     questions which may make difficulties between France and any other\r\n     country; for if Bismarck wants war, it would suit him to be able to\r\n     appear to be only taking his part in a quarrel already made.\r\n\r\n     Italy is the most dangerous neighbour from this point of\r\n     view, and the presence of the _Orénoque_ at Civita Vecchia is the\r\n     ticklish point. It is a very delicate matter to touch; for if the\r\n     question came very prominently into notice, it might raise one of\r\n     the storms in the press of all countries, which are so often the\r\n     precursors of evil times. The ship is supposed to be at Civita\r\n     Vecchia to give the Pope the means of leaving Italy, if he wishes\r\n     to do so; and I suppose the Vatican might relieve the French of\r\n     embarrassment by saying that she is not wanted. In fact, if the\r\n     Italian Government intended to prevent the Pope's going away, they\r\n     would of course stop him before he got to Civita Vecchia, and if\r\n     they abstained (as would no doubt be the case) from interfering\r\n     with his movements, he could get a ship to depart in, whenever he\r\n     pleased.\r\n\r\n     I do not know that there is any ill-feeling in Switzerland\r\n     towards France, but the Ultramontane disputes give Bismarck a lever\r\n     to work with.\r\n\r\n     I believe the French Government have completely drawn in their\r\n     horns about the Armenian Patriarch question and the Protectorate of\r\n     the Latin Christians in the East, since Bismarck appeared on the\r\n     field at Constantinople.\r\n\r\n     In looking out for small beginnings of troubles, I have\r\n     thought of Tunis. I suppose we may lay aside all apprehension of\r\n     attempts of France to change the frontier or to bring the Regency\r\n     into more complete dependency upon her, at the present moment. I\r\n     find by a despatch from Mr. Wood, that the German commodore, in his\r\n     conversation with the Bey, insisted particularly upon the interests\r\n     of German subjects being put upon as good a footing as those of the\r\n     subjects of any other country.\r\n\r\n     I think Décazes takes the humiliating position in which\r\n     France, and he as her Foreign Minister, are placed, with more\r\n     equanimity and temper than most Frenchmen would; and so long as\r\n     the present, or any other Government, not absolutely unreasonable,\r\n     is at the head of affairs, France will be prudent in her foreign\r\n     relations.\r\n\r\n     Of Marshal MacMahon's seven years' lease of power, only three\r\n     months have elapsed; a time too short to give much foundation for\r\n     conjecture as to its probable duration. Both he himself and his\r\n     Ministers take opportunities of declaring that its continuance\r\n     is above discussion, and that they will maintain it against all\r\n     comers. There are two things against it. First, the extreme\r\n     difficulty of giving it anything like the appearance of permanence\r\n     and stability which would rally to it that great majority of\r\n     Frenchmen who are ready at all times to worship the powers that\r\n     be, if only they look as if they were likely to continue to be.\r\n     Secondly, there is the character of the Marshal himself. He is\r\n     honest and a brave soldier, but he does not take such a part in\r\n     affairs as would increase his personal prestige. The danger,\r\n     in fact, is that by degrees he may come to be looked upon as a\r\n     _nullité!_\r\n\r\n     The Imperialists are agitating themselves and spending money,\r\n     as if they were meditating an immediate coup. The wiser heads\r\n     counsel patience, but the old horses, who sorely miss the pampering\r\n     they had under the Empire, are getting very hungry, and are afraid\r\n     that they themselves may die before the grass has grown.\r\n\r\n     The fear of an Imperialist attempt has in some degree brought\r\n     back to the Government the support of the Legitimists, and in fact\r\n     the Comte de Chambord has quarrelled with his own party. The Fusion\r\n     has put an end to the Orleanist Party, as a party for placing\r\n     the Comte de Paris on the throne; but the question of appointing\r\n     the Duc d'Aumale Vice-President, in order to have some one ready\r\n     to succeed MacMahon in case of need, is seriously considered. I\r\n     suppose, however, that MacMahon would look upon this as destructive\r\n     of the arrangements between him and the Assembly. And then the\r\n     whole system depends upon the maintenance by hook or by crook of\r\n     a majority, which has not yet ceased to melt away, as seats become\r\n     vacant and new elections take place.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Bisaccia, the new French Ambassador in London, even at his\r\nfirst interview with Lord Derby, did not scruple to avow that he felt\r\nquite certain that the Republican form of government would not last, and\r\nhe went on to assert that Bismarck's head had been turned by success,\r\nand that he aimed at nothing less than the conquest of Europe, being\r\nquite indifferent either to the views of his Imperial Master, or of the\r\nCrown Prince. Whatever the prospects of the Republic, the prospects of\r\nBisaccia's own party (Legitimist) were indisputably gloomy, for the\r\nprevailing sentiment in France at the time was hostility to the White\r\nFlag and to the clerical and aristocratic influences of which it was\r\nheld to be the emblem. The great majority of the people were Republican,\r\nand the most numerous party after the Republican was the Imperial, but\r\nthe Presidency of Marshal MacMahon was acquiesced in, for the moment,\r\nby all parties, because it was believed to be capable of preserving\r\norder, because it left the question of the definitive government of the\r\ncountry still undecided, and because no party saw its way to securing\r\nthe pre-dominence of its own ideas.\r\n\r\nThe existing state of things was accounted for by the history of the\r\nestablishment of the seven-years Presidency.\r\n\r\nWhen the Orleans Princes tendered their allegiance to the Comte de\r\nChambord in the previous autumn, the fusion, so long talked of, was\r\ncomplete, and it was supposed that a Parliamentary Monarchy with the\r\nTricolour Flag, might be established under the legitimate head of\r\nthe Bourbons; but the Comte de Chambord struck a fatal blow to these\r\nhopes by his celebrated letter, and the Conservatives felt that there\r\nwas no time to be lost in setting up a Government having some sort of\r\nstability. The plan which they adopted was that of conferring power\r\nupon Marshal MacMahon for a fixed and long period. Had a short period\r\nbeen proposed, it would have been agreed to almost unanimously; but\r\nthis was not their object. They wished it to be apparent to the country\r\nthat the Marshal was specially the President of the Conservative\r\nmajority: they asked for a term of ten years: obtained seven, and\r\nsecured from the Marshal a declaration of adherence to their views. The\r\nslight modification of the Ministry which ensued, resulted in placing\r\nthe Government more completely in the hands of the party pledged to a\r\nmonarchical form of Government, and the Ministry thus reconstituted, set\r\nitself to the task of resisting the progress of Radicalism and Communism\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\nBut the suspicion of favouring the White Flag clung to the Government,\r\nand although the latter, following the example of the Empire, had\r\ninstalled their partisans in office, as mayors, etc., by thousands\r\nthroughout the country, the candidates supported by the Government had,\r\nin almost every instance, found themselves at the bottom of the poll\r\nwhen elections took place; and the results showed that a large accession\r\nof votes had been received by the Republican and Imperialist parties. Of\r\nthese the former had gained most, but the latter possessed a backing in\r\nthe country which was inadequately represented by their numbers in the\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nIt should, however, be added that there did not appear on any side a\r\ndisposition to embarrass the Government by factious or bitter opposition\r\nwith regard to the three departments, Finance, War, and Foreign Affairs,\r\nin which the practical interests of the country were most deeply\r\ninvolved. The financial policy of M. Magne[9] was generally supported;\r\nand with regard to votes for the Army and Navy, the Government had\r\nrather to resist a pressure to increase the expenditure on these heads,\r\nthan to urge the necessity of considerable supplies.\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of foreign affairs, the defenceless state of France had\r\nmade the avoidance of an attack from Germany the one overwhelming care\r\nof the Government. To effect this object, to give Germany no pretext for\r\na quarrel, and to make submission to the behests of Bismarck as little\r\ngalling and in appearance as little humiliating as possible, had been\r\nthe constant occupation of the Foreign Minister. In this effort he was\r\nseconded by the Assembly, and indeed every one in and out of that body,\r\nexcept a few clerical and Legitimist bigots, felt it to be a patriotic\r\nduty to abstain from embarrassing the Government in its relations with\r\nforeign Powers. Another reassuring feature in the situation was, that\r\nthere were no symptoms of attempts to resist by force the authority of\r\nthe Assembly, as no party seemed likely to venture to oppose by force\r\na Government which disposed of the army; and the army in 1874 showed\r\nno prediction for any particular candidate for the throne sufficiently\r\nstrong to overcome its habitual obedience to the Constitutional\r\nGovernment, whatever that Government might be.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the dictation practised by Bismarck towards France in\r\nforeign affairs, it may be mentioned that in January, 1874,[10] Count\r\nArnim formally announced to the Duc Décazes that the German Government\r\nwould not tolerate the assumption by France of the suzerainty of Tunis,\r\nor of a Protectorate over that country. To this Décazes humbly replied\r\nthat there had never been the least question of anything of the kind--a\r\nstatement which can scarcely be described as accurate.\r\n\r\nWhether Bismarck entertained any designs with regard to Tunis is not\r\nknown, but it was in this year that Germany began to show some signs\r\nof interest in the Philippines and other places supposed to be of\r\nsome colonial value. The following extract from a letter written on\r\nthe subject by the late Lord Lytton, who was at the time Secretary\r\nof Embassy at Paris, is a striking instance of rare and remarkable\r\npolitical prescience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lytton to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Oct. 27, 1874.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Odo's impression (communicated to you) that Bismarck does\r\n     not want colonies rather surprises me. It seems to me a perfectly\r\n     natural and quite inevitable ambition on the part of a Power so\r\n     strong as Germany not to remain an inland state a moment longer\r\n     than it can help, but to get to the sea, and to extend its seaboard\r\n     in all possible directions. Is there any case on record of an\r\n     inland state suddenly attaining to the military supremacy of Europe\r\n     without endeavouring by means of its military strength and prestige\r\n     to develop its maritime power? But you can't be a Maritime Power\r\n     without colonies, for if you have ships you must have places to\r\n     send them to, work for them to do, and a marine Exercier-Platz\r\n     for training seamen. That is why I have always thought that the\r\n     English school of politicians which advocates getting rid of our\r\n     colonies as profitless encumbrances, ought (to be consistent) to\r\n     advocate the simultaneous suppression of our navy. Lord Derby says\r\n     that though Germany may probably cherish such an ambition, she\r\n     will have as much seaboard as she can practically want as long\r\n     as she retains possession of the Duchies. But that is not a very\r\n     convenient commercial seaboard, and I confess I can't help doubting\r\n     the absence of all desire for more and better outlets to the\r\n     sea, so long as her military power and prestige remain unbroken.\r\n     Anyhow, there seems to be now a pretty general instinct throughout\r\n     Europe, and even in America, that a policy of maritime and colonial\r\n     development must be the natural result of Germany's present\r\n     position: and such instincts, being those of self-preservation, are\r\n     generally, I think, what Dizzy calls 'unerring' ones.\r\n\r\nA letter from Lord Odo Russell written about this period throws a\r\ncurious light upon Bismarck's imaginary grievances, and the difficulties\r\nwhich he was prepared to raise upon the slightest provocation. Probably\r\nno Minister of modern times ever uttered so many complaints, threatened\r\nso often to resign, and yet wielded such absolute power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord O. Russell to Lord Derby._\r\n\r\n    Berlin, Nov. 9, 1874.\r\n\r\n     I found Prince Bismarck in one of his confidential moods\r\n     the other day, and he indulged me in a long talk about his own\r\n     interests, past, present, and prospective.\r\n\r\n     Among many other things, he said that his life had been\r\n     strangely divided into phases or periods of twelve years each.\r\n\r\n     Born in 1815, he had left home when he was twelve years old to\r\n     begin his studies. At 24 he inherited his small patrimony and his\r\n     father's debts, and entered upon the life and duties of a country\r\n     gentleman. At 36 (1851) his diplomatic career began, and he was\r\n     sent to Frankfort, Vienna, St. Petersburg and Paris. At 48 (1863)\r\n     he was recalled to form the present Administration, which in twelve\r\n     years had carried on three wars and made the German Empire. He was\r\n     now 60 and worn out with the responsibilities and anxieties of\r\n     office, and he was resolved to enter upon a new phase (of 12 years\r\n     he hoped) by resigning and retiring into private life--a resolution\r\n     he begged I would keep to myself for the present.\r\n\r\n     I said I could well understand his wish for rest, but I did\r\n     not believe the Emperor or the country would allow him to indulge\r\n     in it, as he was well enough and strong enough to govern Germany\r\n     for many years to come.\r\n\r\n     He replied that he felt quite strong enough to govern Germany,\r\n     but not to be governed himself any longer by the Emperor, whose\r\n     obstinacy and narrow mindedness were more than he could bear.\r\n\r\n     I said I had often heard him complain of his Court duties\r\n     before, but it appeared to me that he always carried his points,\r\n     and that after some resistance the Emperor gave way in the end and\r\n     followed his advice.\r\n\r\n     He replied that it was that very struggle with his Imperial\r\n     Master that had worn him out and that he no longer felt strong\r\n     enough to carry on after sixty. He then related to me a series of\r\n     very curious anecdotes illustrating his struggles with the Crown,\r\n     and what he called the want of confidence and ingratitude of the\r\n     Emperor.\r\n\r\n     I asked him whether anything had lately occurred calculated to\r\n     increase his wish for rest.\r\n\r\n     He said that his present difference with the Emperor related\r\n     to the new army organization. The Emperor and his generals thought\r\n     the sole object of the German Empire was to turn the nation into an\r\n     army for the greater glory of the House of Hohenzollern; whilst he\r\n     held that there must be some limit to the heavy strain of military\r\n     obligations the Crown was ever anxious to impose on the people.\r\n\r\n     I asked whether he was alluding to the Landsturm Bill, which\r\n     placed every German from the age of 16 to 42 at the disposal of the\r\n     War Department.\r\n\r\n     He replied that he did not exactly allude to that, but there\r\n     were other measures in contemplation, elaborated in the Emperor's\r\n     military Cabinet, he could not give his sanction to, and which\r\n     would consequently lead to another painful struggle. He considered\r\n     that his great task had been completed in 1870 to 1872, and that he\r\n     could now retire and leave the internal organization of Germany to\r\n     other hands. The Crown Prince, he thought, might possibly govern\r\n     on more Constitutional principles than his father, who, born\r\n     in the last century, had not yet been able to realize what the\r\n     duties of a Constitutional Sovereign were, and thought himself as\r\n     King of Prussia above the Constitution, as the Emperor Sigismund\r\n     thought himself above grammar when he wrote bad Latin. A danger\r\n     to which the Crown Prince would be exposed as Sovereign was his\r\n     love for intrigue and backstairs influence--'some one or other\r\n     always concealed behind the door or curtain.' The Prince was not as\r\n     straightforward as he appeared, and he suffered from the weakness\r\n     of obstinacy and the obstinacy of weakness due to unbounded conceit\r\n     and self-confidence--but at the same time he meant well.\r\n\r\n     After a good deal more talk about his family, his property,\r\n     and his longing for country life and pursuits, we parted.\r\n\r\n     Without attaching undue importance to Prince Bismarck's\r\n     oft-repeated threat of resignation, I do not suppose he would go\r\n     out of his way to tell me and others so, without intention. My\r\n     impression is that he wants to obtain something or other from the\r\n     Emperor which he can make conditional on remaining in office, well\r\n     knowing that His Majesty cannot do without him. Besides which,\r\n     his retirement from office would have the appearance of a defeat,\r\n     consequent on his failure to coerce the Pope and his legions. He is\r\n     not the man to admit a defeat while he lives. Time will show what\r\n     more he wants to satisfy his gigantic ambition.\r\n\r\nThe fear of war with Germany had died away temporarily in the summer,\r\nand the various political parties in France were free to continue their\r\nstruggles and to reduce the situation to almost unexampled confusion.\r\nThe motives of the Comte de Chambord and his followers were too remote\r\nfor ordinary human understanding, and their object appeared to be to\r\nbring about a crisis and a dissolution of the Assembly on the most\r\ndisadvantageous terms to themselves. Moderate Republicans were looking\r\nto the Duc d'Aumale as a safeguard against the Imperialists on the one\r\nhand, and the Reds on the other. Republicans of various shades, and the\r\nReds in particular, were coquetting with Prince Napoleon, and he with\r\nthem. Most men and most parties appeared to have particular objects,\r\nwhich they hated with a hatred more intense than their love for the\r\nobject of their affections. Thiers, it was believed, would have rather\r\nseen anything, even a restoration of the Empire, than have the Duc de\r\nBroglie and the Orleanists in power. Notwithstanding the fusion, the\r\nLegitimists would have probably preferred Gambetta (or some one still\r\nmore extreme) than an Orleans Prince--and so on.\r\n\r\n'I cannot make head or tail of French internal politics,' Lord Derby\r\nwrote, at the end of the year, 'and presume that most Frenchmen are in\r\nthe same condition. It looks as if nobody could see their way till the\r\npresent Assembly is dissolved and a new one elected.'\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the new year was signalized in Paris by the appearance\r\nof the Lord Mayor of London, who had been invited to attend the opening\r\nof the new Opera House. That functionary has always been invested in\r\nFrench popular opinion with semi-fabulous attributes, and he seems to\r\nhave risen to the level of the occasion. 'The Lord Mayor,' wrote the\r\nunimpressionable Lord Lyons, 'is astonishing the Parisians with his\r\nsword, mace, trumpeters, and State coaches. So far, however, I think the\r\ndisposition here is to be pleased with it all, and I keep no countenance\r\nand do what I have to do with becoming gravity.' A little later,\r\nhowever, he was constrained to add:--\r\n\r\n     I am afraid the Lord Mayor's head has been turned by the\r\n     fuss which was made with him here, for he seems to have made a\r\n     very foolish speech on his return to England. Strange to say the\r\n     Parisians continued to be amused and pleased with his pomps and\r\n     vanities to the end, although the narrow limits between the sublime\r\n     and the ridiculous were always on the point of being over passed.\r\n     I abstained from going to the banquets given to him, or by him,\r\n     except a private dinner at the Elysée; but I had him to dinner\r\n     here, and, I think, sent him away pleased with the Embassy, which\r\n     it is always as well to do, and if so, I have reaped the reward of\r\n     my diplomatic command over my risible muscles.\r\n\r\nIt was not perhaps surprising that the Lord Mayor should have been\r\nthrown off his intellectual balance, for the honours accorded to him\r\nfar surpassed those paid to ordinary mortals and resembled rather those\r\nhabitually reserved for crowned heads. When he visited the opera the\r\nex-Imperial box was reserved for his use; the audience rose at his\r\nentry, and the orchestra played the English National Anthem. Twice he\r\ndined with the President of the Republic; the Prefect of the Seine gave\r\na banquet in his honour; so did the authorities at Boulogne; and to\r\ncrown all, the Tribunal of Commerce struck a medal in commemoration of\r\nhis visit.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that was fairly clear in French politics, besides\r\nabhorrence of the White Flag, was the gradual progress of Bonapartism\r\nwhich was beginning to frighten Conservatives as well as Republicans,\r\nand the Bonapartists themselves were inclined to regret having helped\r\nto turn Thiers out of office, because the army was becoming more and\r\nmore anti-Republican, and it would be much easier to turn it against a\r\ncivilian than against its natural head, a Marshal of France.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Derby._\r\n\r\n    Jan. 26, 1875.\r\n\r\n     Bonapartism is still in the ascendant, and certainly the\r\n     Assembly is doing everything to give weight to the assertion that\r\n     France is unfit for Parliamentary Government. No one believes in\r\n     a moderate Republic, as a self-supporting institution unconnected\r\n     with some particular individual. The 'Conservative Republic'\r\n     was devised for M. Thiers. The Septennate Republic, if it be a\r\n     Republic, would be scouted if MacMahon were not at the head of\r\n     it. The Comte de Chambord is impossible. The Orleanists have cast\r\n     in their lot with his, and besides, the Government they represent\r\n     being constitutional or Parliamentary, is exactly what is most\r\n     out of favour, with the exception of the White Flag. As I have\r\n     said all along, the dispute is between a very advanced Republic\r\n     and the Empire, and _confugiendum est ad imperium_ is becoming\r\n     more and more the cry of those who dread Communism. Those who have\r\n     personal reasons for fearing the Empire are already taking their\r\n     precautions. Friends of the Orleans Princes are believed to have\r\n     seriously conferred (not with the knowledge or consent of the\r\n     Princes themselves, so far as I have heard) with the Bonaparte\r\n     leaders, in order to ascertain what the Orleans family would\r\n     have to expect if the Prince Imperial returned. At any rate the\r\n     Bonapartist papers have been insinuating that they would be allowed\r\n     to stay in France and keep their property; and these insinuations\r\n     are of course intended to relieve tender Orleanist consciences of\r\n     scruples in coming round to the Imperial cause.\r\n\r\n     The officers in the army are becoming more and more averse\r\n     from all idea of a permanent Republic. They would willingly wait to\r\n     the end of MacMahon's time, but they are beginning to talk of the\r\n     possibility of his being so much disgusted by the way in which he\r\n     is worried by the Assembly, as to throw the Presidency up.\r\n\r\n     In short France is at this moment in a fear of Bonapartism.\r\n     It may, and very probably will, subside this time, but it differs\r\n     from most intermittent fevers in this, that the attacks recur at\r\n     shorter and shorter intervals, and increase instead of diminish in\r\n     intensity.\r\n\r\nFear of the Imperialists drove Conservatives into voting with Gambetta\r\nand other advanced Republicans; a ministerial crisis took place; the\r\nAssembly gave contradictory decisions and generally discredited itself,\r\nand the confusion grew so great that it seemed impossible to unravel it.\r\n\r\n     'I have spent three afternoons at Versailles,' wrote Lord\r\n     Lyons on February 26th, 'and have seen a Constitution made there.\r\n     I have seen also such a confusion of parties and principles as I\r\n     hope never to witness again. I found Décazes, Broglie, and a great\r\n     number of Right Centre deputies at the MacMahons' last evening.\r\n     They all, and particularly Décazes, looked to me very unhappy,\r\n     and indeed they did not affect to be at all satisfied with the\r\n     occurrences in the Assembly. Like the horse in the fable who\r\n     invited the man to get on his back, the Right Centre have let the\r\n     Left get on their backs to attack Bonapartism, and don't know how\r\n     to shake them off again.'\r\n\r\nThe ceaseless struggles between the various political parties in France,\r\nwhich were of little interest to the outside world, were temporarily\r\ninterrupted in the spring of 1875 by the war scare which so greatly\r\nagitated Europe at the time, but which subsequently became an almost\r\nannual phenomenon. Unfortunately, Lord Lyons was in England during\r\nthe greater portion of this critical period, and there are wanting,\r\nconsequently, documents which might have thrown light upon what has\r\nalways been a somewhat mysterious episode, but it would appear that the\r\nsymptoms of alarm on the part of the French first showed themselves\r\nabout March 11. On that day the Duc Décazes drew the attention of the\r\nBritish Ambassador to three incidents which ought to engage the serious\r\nattention of those Governments who were desirous of maintaining peace\r\nin Europe. These were the threatening representation made by the German\r\nMinister at Brussels to the Belgian Government respecting the language\r\nand conduct of the Ultramontane Party in that country; the pointed\r\ncommunication to the French Government of this representation; and the\r\nprohibition of the export of horses from Germany. Prince Bismarck,\r\nsaid Décazes, seemed to become more and more inclined to revive old\r\ngrievances and to require of foreign countries the exercise of an\r\nunreasonable and impossible control over the prelates and even over\r\nthe lay members of the Roman Catholic Church, and as for the decree\r\nforbidding the export of horses, it was so inexplicable that it could\r\nonly add to uneasiness. It might be easy for England, and for some other\r\nnations, to regard these things calmly, but to France they constituted\r\na serious and immediate peril. In spite of the steps taken during the\r\npast year to conciliate Germany on the subject of the Bishop's charges,\r\nthe German Government had never officially intimated that it considered\r\nthe question to be closed, and Count Arnim had used the significant\r\nexpression to him, that it was only closed 'so far as any question\r\nbetween you and us can ever be looked upon as closed.' He believed that\r\nit was only owing to the influence of other Powers, and of England in\r\nparticular, that the danger had been averted in 1874; and he now hoped\r\nthat the same influence would be exerted in the same way. Décazes added\r\na somewhat surprising piece of information which had been imparted to\r\nhim in January, 1874, by Prince Orloff, the Russian Ambassador, viz.\r\nthat in that month an order to occupy Nancy had absolutely been issued\r\nby the German Government to its troops, and that there were strong\r\ngrounds for believing that this order has been rescinded chiefly owing\r\nto influence exerted at Berlin by Russia. So far as is known, there is\r\nno corroboration of this story, and it would appear that Prince Orloff\r\nwas so anxious to convince France of the goodwill of Russia that he\r\nthought it advisable to drag England into the question, but it was not\r\nsurprising that France should be sensitively alive to the danger she\r\nincurred, if Bismarck, irritated by his Ultramontane difficulties,\r\nshould choose to throw the blame upon the Roman Catholics of other\r\ncountries, or should resort to quarrels with foreign nations as a means\r\nof diverting public opinion in Germany from inconvenient questions at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nPrince Hohenlohe, the new German Ambassador, who also saw Lord Lyons on\r\nthe same day, volunteered no opinion upon the representation to Belgium\r\nwhich had excited so much perturbation, but remarked with regard to the\r\nexportation of horses that the 'agriculturists might have been alarmed\r\nby the prospect of a drain of horses for foreign countries. He had no\r\nreason to suppose that purchases of horses had been made in Germany by\r\nthe French Government for military purposes; but he had heard that a\r\nconsiderable number had lately been brought there for the Paris fiacres.'\r\n\r\nIt will not have escaped notice that the German Government--or rather\r\nBismarck--was fortunate in always having excellent reasons available,\r\neither for not complying with inconvenient requests, or for explaining\r\naway disquieting symptoms; thus, in 1870, the insuperable difficulty to\r\ndisarmament was the King of Prussia; during the peace negotiations, all\r\nharsh conditions were due to _les militaires_, and in 1875 the German\r\nagriculturists and the Paris cabs were responsible for any uneasiness\r\nthat might be felt temporarily.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Derby._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 16, 1875.\r\n\r\n     I saw Décazes last night and found him in a greater state of\r\n     alarm about the intentions of Germany than anything specific he\r\n     told me seemed to warrant. The retirement of Bismarck to Varzin\r\n     will not reassure the French, because they remember that he was\r\n     there when the war broke out in 1870.\r\n\r\n     There is observable here, and not least among the Russians, a\r\n     sort of impression that there is to be a movement of some kind in\r\n     the East.\r\n\r\n     In short, there is a great deal of vague uneasiness and fear\r\n     that peace is in danger.\r\n\r\n     The German Embassy here has certainly been taking great pains\r\n     to put it about that the prohibition to export horses has been\r\n     decreed solely from economical, and not from military motives.\r\n     That Embassy keeps up very close relations with the _Times_\r\n     correspondent[11] here, and his subordinates. Of course the trouble\r\n     it has taken has increased instead of allaying alarm. Décazes\r\n     constantly harps on the string of the influence of England at\r\n     Berlin, and the consolation it affords him to feel sure that it is\r\n     exercised quietly on the side of peace. The position is a painful\r\n     one. Without particular friendships and alliances, France is\r\n     absolutely at the mercy of Germany, and if she tries to form such\r\n     friendships and alliances, she may bring the wrath of the great\r\n     Chancellor down upon her instantly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Derby to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, March 16, 1875.\r\n\r\n     I do not know and cannot conjecture the cause of Décazes's\r\n     anxiety. Nothing has passed or is passing in any part of Europe to\r\n     justify alarm as to an early disturbance of general peace. But I\r\n     hear of a similar feeling of uneasiness at Berlin; and the Russian\r\n     Government is credited with designs as to the nature of which no\r\n     two persons agree. Until we hear more, I shall be inclined to set\r\n     down all these rumours of wars to the time of year, and to the\r\n     absence of any exciting questions (so far as foreign relations are\r\n     concerned) to occupy men's minds.\r\n\r\n     I may tell you confidentially that Bismarck has given us\r\n     through Odo Russell a serious warning against the unfriendly\r\n     feelings of the Russian Government towards England. He may be only\r\n     trying to stir up jealousy, a game which he often plays, or he may\r\n     be sincere. I take his hint as one not to be slighted, yet not\r\n     infallibly trusted. Gortschakoff is no doubt much disgusted about\r\n     the Conference; the Czar also to some extent; and probably they\r\n     both feel that they had miscalculated the effect of the Russian\r\n     marriage on English policy. But beyond this I know no cause of\r\n     quarrel. Dead calm for the moment. I cannot conceive any reason why\r\n     you should not take your leave when you wish it. Paris is always\r\n     within reach if anything new turns up.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious from the above that neither Lord Derby nor Lord Lyons felt\r\nany very serious apprehensions, and the latter was permitted to go home\r\non leave at the beginning of April. On April 10, Lord Odo Russell wrote\r\nto Lord Derby:--\r\n\r\n     Bismarck is at his old tricks again--alarming the Germans\r\n     through the officious Press, and intimating that the French are\r\n     going to attack them, and that Austria and Italy are conspiring\r\n     in favour of the Pope, etc. Now he has succeeded in making the\r\n     Emperor and the Crown Prince believe that France is meditating an\r\n     invasion of Germany through Belgium! And, not knowing any better,\r\n     they are in despair and have ordered the War Department to make\r\n     ready for defence. This crisis will blow over like so many others,\r\n     but Bismarck's sensational policy is very wearisome at times. Half\r\n     the Diplomatic Body have been here since yesterday to tell me that\r\n     war was imminent, and when I seek to calm their nerves and disprove\r\n     their anticipations, they think that I am thoroughly bamboozled by\r\n     Bismarck.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of April there appeared in the _Berlin Post_ the\r\ncelebrated article entitled: 'Is War in Sight?' and as it was well known\r\nthat such articles were not written except under official inspiration,\r\nsomething akin to a real panic took place, more especially when other\r\nGerman papers began to write in a similar strain. Letters from Mr.\r\nAdams, who had been left as Chargé d'Affaires at Paris, show the\r\npitiable condition of terror to which the French Government was reduced,\r\nand the efforts made by Décazes to obtain British support. Décazes urged\r\nthat England ought to take an active part in protesting against the\r\nnew theory that one nation was justified in falling upon another for\r\nno other reason than that the latter might possibly prove troublesome\r\nin the future. He said that he had protested to the German Ambassador\r\nagainst the attitude of the German Government, after all the assurances\r\nthat it had received from the French Government, and added that if war\r\ntook place in August, as he feared, he should advise MacMahon to retire\r\nwith his army beyond the Loire without firing a shot and wait there\r\n'until the justice of Europe should speak out in favour of France.' The\r\nidea of openly identifying England with the French cause did not commend\r\nitself apparently to Mr. Disraeli.\r\n\r\n     'I had a rather long conversation about French politics with\r\n     Mr. Disraeli,' Lord Lyons wrote to Mr. Adams on April 21st, 'and I\r\n     found him thoroughly well up in the subject. He wishes to encourage\r\n     confidence and goodwill on the part of France towards England,\r\n     but sees the danger to France herself of any such appearance of a\r\n     special and separate understanding as would arouse the jealousy of\r\n     Bismarck.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     'With a little variation in the illustrations, Décazes's\r\n     language to you was just what he used to me before I left Paris.\r\n     Germany can, I suppose, overrun France whenever she pleases, a\r\n     fortnight after she determines to do so; and no one can tell how\r\n     suddenly she may come to this determination. Whether Décazes is\r\n     wise in perpetually crying \"wolf\" I cannot say. He is naturally\r\n     anxious to keep Europe on the alert, but I am not sure that the\r\n     repetition of these cries does not produce the contrary effect.'\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of April the tension began to diminish, but Lord\r\nOdo Russell, who was certainly no alarmist, felt convinced that, so long\r\nas Bismarck remained in office, the peace of Europe was in jeopardy,\r\nfor his power had now become absolute, and neither the Emperor nor the\r\nCrown Prince were capable of withstanding him. Writing on April 24, he\r\nremarks: 'The prospect of another war fills me with horror and disgust,\r\nand if Bismarck lives a few years longer I do not see how it can be\r\nprevented. The Emperor's powers of resistance are over; he does what\r\nBismarck wishes, and the Crown Prince, peace-loving as he is, has not\r\nsufficient independence of character to resist Bismarck's all-powerful\r\nmind and will.'\r\n\r\nA few days later the Belgian Minister at Berlin reported to Lord Odo\r\nRussell an alarming communication made to him by Count Moltke.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord O. Russell to Lord Derby._\r\n\r\n    Berlin, May 1, 1875.\r\n\r\n     Since writing to you to-day, at this late hour my Belgian\r\n     colleague Baron Nothomb has called to tell me that he had a long\r\n     conversation with Moltke yesterday fully confirming what is said\r\n     in my despatch. Moltke added that, much as he hated war, he did\r\n     not see how Germany could avoid it _next year_, unless the Great\r\n     Powers 'coalesced' to persuade France to reduce her armaments to a\r\n     reasonable peace establishment.\r\n\r\n     Then Nothomb told me that Bismarck had sent Bülow to him with\r\n     the following confidential message: 'Tell your King to get his army\r\n     ready for defence, because Belgium may be invaded by France sooner\r\n     than we expect.'\r\n\r\n     This message Nothomb writes to Brussels to-day. He is under\r\n     an impression that in the event of war, Bismarck intends to occupy\r\n     Belgium, as Frederick the Great occupied Saxony when he suspected\r\n     Maria Theresa of wanting to take her revenge for the loss of\r\n     Silesia. This is curious, and you will probably hear more about it\r\n     from Brussels. I write in haste for the Messenger.\r\n\r\nThe evident desire of Bismarck to fasten a quarrel upon France aroused\r\nthe indignation of Lord Derby, who realized that the intervention of\r\nRussia was the best method of preventing it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Derby to Lord O. Russell._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, May 3, 1875.\r\n\r\n     You seem reassured as to the immediate prospect, and the panic\r\n     in Paris has subsided, but great uneasiness remains. Lumley[12]\r\n     writes to me that the state of things seems to him most critical,\r\n     and the language which you report as held by Moltke is unpleasant\r\n     enough. Münster[13] has not called for the last few days: when last\r\n     I saw him, his language about French armaments tallied exactly\r\n     with that which you and others report as being held by German\r\n     representatives throughout Europe.\r\n\r\n     Is there no hope of Russian interference to maintain peace?\r\n     It cannot be the interest of Russia to have France destroyed and\r\n     Germany omnipotent. If the Czar were to say that a new war must not\r\n     take place, and that he would not allow it, Bismarck would hardly\r\n     undertake to fight Russia and France combined. I see little other\r\n     prospect of averting mischief, and if it begins, where is it to end?\r\n\r\n     Even here, and notwithstanding the sympathy felt in the\r\n     main for the Protestant German Empire, the outrageous injustice\r\n     of picking a quarrel with France, because she does not choose to\r\n     remain disarmed, would produce its effect. There would be a great\r\n     revulsion of feeling; not unlike that which took place when the\r\n     first Napoleon had begun to show his real character and objects.\r\n     The English public knows little about foreign concerns, but it does\r\n     understand that hitting a man when he is down is not fair play, and\r\n     I think in the rest of Europe fear and jealousy of the predominant\r\n     Power would give France many adherents.\r\n\r\n     I do what I can to point this out in a quiet and friendly way;\r\n     but without being sanguine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     May 4. The conversation about Belgium in the House of Lords\r\n     last night led to no result. I think I see a growing feeling,\r\n     indicated by the language of the press, that the German demands are\r\n     not necessarily unreasonable, and that we should at least hear more\r\n     of the case before pronouncing judgment.\r\n\r\n     To judge by the reports which Nothomb sends to his own\r\n     Government, he has been thoroughly frightened, and is ready to\r\n     advise unconditional acceptance of German proposals. Is he disposed\r\n     to be an alarmist? Or has Bismarck established a personal hold over\r\n     him?\r\n\r\n     We are quiet at this office, busy in Parliament; the Session\r\n     threatens to be long, but it will not be eventful.\r\n\r\nOn May 6, Lord Odo Russell reported that Count Schouvaloff, the Russian\r\nAmbassador in London, had just arrived at Berlin from St. Petersburg,\r\nand was the bearer of important tidings.\r\n\r\n     The good news he brought respecting our relations with Russia\r\n     filled me with delight after the dark allusions made to me here\r\n     at Court and by the Chancellor during the winter. As regards\r\n     Germany and the war rumours, Count Schouvaloff gave me the most\r\n     satisfactory and welcome news that the Emperor of Russia is coming\r\n     to Berlin on Monday next, will insist on the maintenance of peace\r\n     in Europe, even at the cost of a rupture with Germany, and that he\r\n     can reckon on the support of Austria in doing so.\r\n\r\n     How Bismarck will meet the humiliating blow of being told by\r\n     his allies, Russia and Austria, that he must keep the peace with\r\n     France, when he has proclaimed to the world that France is ready to\r\n     take her revenge, it is difficult to foretell. But we must not be\r\n     surprised if it hastens on the outburst it is intended to prevent.\r\n     I hope not, and do not expect it, but I shall not be surprised if\r\n     it does, because Austria has really joined Russia. She has become\r\n     an obstacle in the way of German development, which Bismarck will\r\n     try to remove.\r\n\r\nIt had, of course, been the object of Bismarck to sow dissension between\r\nEngland and Russia, and he had taken elaborate pains to convince\r\nthe British Government that Russia was animated by the most hostile\r\nfeelings. Consequently the extremely frank and friendly sentiments\r\nexpressed by Count Schouvaloff were in the nature of an agreeable\r\nsurprise, but the effusion of the Russian Envoy was so great that he\r\nseems to have slightly overdone the part.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord O. Russell to Lord Derby._\r\n\r\n    Berlin, May 8, 1875.\r\n\r\n     I did not report Schouvaloff's conversation because he was\r\n     going to tell you all he had to say in great detail as soon as he\r\n     reached London. His frankness is fascinating, but on reflection it\r\n     does not inspire absolute confidence. I feel at first inclined to\r\n     believe all he says; but when I think it over, it appears too good\r\n     to be true.\r\n\r\n     If all he represents himself to have said to Bismarck about\r\n     the power of Russia to coerce Germany under certain circumstances\r\n     be strictly true, Bismarck would scarcely want him to succeed\r\n     Gortschakoff, as he does, if he did not feel that he could make a\r\n     tool of him (Schouvaloff).\r\n\r\n     According to Schouvaloff, the Czar and Gortschakoff are\r\n     to tell Bismarck next week that a new war must not take place,\r\n     and that if he does not submit and agree, Russia, with the\r\n     concurrence of Austria, is prepared to side with France to render\r\n     war impossible. In all probability, their conferences will end\r\n     in mutual assurances of peace and good will, and we shall hear\r\n     no more of war rumours and French armaments until those of\r\n     Germany are ready; and as Bismarck is a match both for the Czar\r\n     and Gortschakoff, I shall not be surprised to hear that he has\r\n     persuaded them to let him have his own way in the end. But this is\r\n     mere conjecture; we shall know more about it all a week hence.\r\n\r\n     The whole of Bismarck's policy now tends to produce a\r\n     coalition of the peaceful Powers against Germany, and his Church\r\n     policy, to produce dissensions in Germany and arrest the progress\r\n     of unification. It is therefore evident that he seeks a conflict\r\n     for purposes of his own.\r\n\r\n     I may be wrong, but I cannot but think that he wants to\r\n     mediatize the smaller German Powers and weaken Austria so as to\r\n     render her alliance useless to Russia, France, and Italy.\r\n\r\n     If I understand Schouvaloff correctly, Bismarck endeavoured to\r\n     set Russia against us, as he attempted to set us against Russia,\r\n     and he seemed to expect that Bismarck would make Gortschakoff\r\n     various offers in return for Russian co-operation or neutrality.\r\n     Indeed, he insinuated that he thought Bismarck a little out of his\r\n     mind at times.\r\n\r\n     The importance of the Czar's language and attitude at Berlin\r\n     is so great that I look forward with anxious interest to the\r\n     results of next week's conferences. For my part I have been careful\r\n     to hold the language you tell me you hold at home on these matters\r\n     in a friendly spirit to Germany and in the interest of European\r\n     Peace.\r\n\r\nOn the same date (May 8), the Emperor Alexander and Prince Gortschakoff\r\nstarted on the journey to Berlin from which so much was anticipated,\r\nand the British Government addressed a despatch to Lord Odo Russell\r\nwhich was also circulated at Paris, Vienna, St. Petersburg, and\r\nRome, instructing him to use all his power to put an end to the\r\nmisunderstanding which had arisen between France and Germany. It is\r\nworthy of note that when this despatch was communicated to the Austrian\r\nGovernment, that Government alone declined to instruct their Ambassador\r\nat Berlin in the sense desired, on the ground that it would irritate\r\nBismarck.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Alexander and Gortschakoff arrived at Berlin on May 10,\r\nand the question of peace or war must have been decided with extreme\r\nrapidity, for Lord Odo Russell dined with Bismarck on that night, and\r\nthe latter took the opportunity to express his thanks 'for the very\r\nfriendly offer, which he highly appreciated, as a proof of good will\r\nand confidence on the part of Her Majesty's Government.' At the same\r\ntime he expressed some naïve surprise at the offer, maintaining that\r\nall his efforts tended in the direction of peace; that the war rumours\r\nwere the work of the stockjobbers and the press, and that France and\r\nGermany were on excellent terms! Under the circumstances, it is highly\r\ncreditable to Lord Odo Russell that he received this communication with\r\nbecoming gravity.\r\n\r\nGortschakoff who made his appearance after the dinner professed great\r\nsatisfaction at Bismarck's language; but in conversation with Lord\r\nOdo Russell on the following day (May 11), Bismarck spoke with much\r\nirritation of Gortschakoff's intervention, which he attributed to senile\r\nvanity, and stated that he had refused Gortschakoff's request for a\r\ncategorical promise not to go to war, because such a promise would have\r\nimplied the existence of an intention which he repudiated.\r\n\r\nOn May 12, Gortschakoff sent a telegram to St. Petersburg which gave\r\ndire offence: _La paix est assurée:_ and the Emperor of Russia requested\r\nLord Odo to inform Her Majesty's Government that he felt certain of the\r\nmaintenance of peace. Bismarck, secretly furious at the frustration of\r\nhis plans, outwardly betrayed no ill-humour and put a good face upon his\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord O. Russell to Lord Derby._\r\n\r\n    Berlin, May 15, 1875.\r\n\r\n     Although Bismarck is as civil, confidential, and amiable\r\n     to me as ever, I fancy that he must be frantic at our combined\r\n     action with Russia in favour of peace, which took him by surprise.\r\n     However that matters little, and he will get over it, as he wishes\r\n     to keep well with us. But he will seek an opportunity of paying\r\n     out Gortschakoff for having come the Peacemaker and Dictator over\r\n     Germany again.\r\n\r\n     For my part, I was delighted at the course pursued by Her\r\n     Majesty's Government and at the instructions you sent me, which I\r\n     feel sure will do good, both at home and abroad.\r\n\r\n     The old Emperor William, whose bodily health is wonderful, but\r\n     whose mental powers are declining, will have been surprised and\r\n     grieved at the Queen writing to the Czar instead of to himself.\r\n     Bismarck thinks it is due to an intrigue of the Empress Augusta\r\n     to spite him. His hatred and abuse of the Empress is a perfect\r\n     mania. The Crown Prince sent for me to talk the incident over. He\r\n     asked many questions, but was himself reserved, beyond deploring\r\n     Bismarck's nervous state and policy which had been the cause of\r\n     such useless alarm. He asked whether I saw any likely successor to\r\n     Bismarck if his health broke down. I said plenty would be found\r\n     in Germany when there was a demand for them, which Bismarck's\r\n     popularity at present excluded. The Prince, though reserved, was\r\n     very cordial and very anxious for information.\r\n\r\n     Your conversation with Schouvaloff is word for word what he\r\n     said to me. I note one mistake on his part. He spoke with certainty\r\n     of Austrian co-operation, which failed us at the last moment.\r\n\r\n     I was much impressed by the warmth and eloquence of the\r\n     Czar's utterances of friendship for England. He seemed really\r\n     to feel deeply what he said, and to wish with all his heart for\r\n     an alliance with us. Gortschakoff was less ardent: it is not in\r\n     his nature; but he was persuasive and consistent in his friendly\r\n     assurances. Schouvaloff's attitude and language will show whether\r\n     my impressions are correct or not.\r\n\r\n     Münster's assurances to you in regard to the German army are\r\n     quite correct, I believe; only it is better prepared for war than\r\n     any other army in the world, and at ten days' notice. But when\r\n     Bismarck tells him to lament the alarm he has created himself, and\r\n     to ascribe it to Ultramontane influences in the press, Münster must\r\n     feel rather ashamed of his master.\r\n\r\n     We may certainly reckon on peace for this year. Next year\r\n     peace must depend on the state of Bismarck's combinations for\r\n     the completion of his task--the unification of Germany--Russia\r\n     permitting. He left for Varzin this morning, which will do him\r\n     good; but he returns on the 27th instant to receive the King and\r\n     Queen of Sweden who stay three days in Berlin.\r\n\r\n     I did not mention in my official report that the Czar asked\r\n     me to tell him frankly, if I was at liberty to do so, whether I\r\n     thought Bismarck had designs on Austria. I told him what the wishes\r\n     of the National Party were, and what they expected of Bismarck\r\n     their leader, and that I believed he contemplated weakening Austria\r\n     to strengthen Germany. The Czar thanked me and said that although\r\n     suspicion had been suggested to him from many sides, he could not\r\n     get himself to believe in so much perfidy.\r\n\r\nSuch then in brief is the story of the great war scare of 1875, a tale\r\nwhich has been told by many writers with embellishments suggested by\r\neither Anglophil or Russophil proclivities. Which of the two countries,\r\nEngland or Russia, contributed most towards the preservation of peace\r\nwill probably always remain a subject of discussion, but Bismarck at\r\nall events never forgave Gortschakoff his vainglorious telegram, and\r\nhe used afterwards to maintain that, whereas the English had 'behaved\r\nlike gentlemen,' the conduct of the Russian Government came under a\r\ndistinctly opposite category. It is a remarkable fact that in spite\r\nof the indisputable evidence furnished not only by the foregoing\r\ncorrespondence, but from other sources, Bismarck subsequently had the\r\nhardihood to assert that the war scare of 1875 was a myth invented\r\npartly by Décazes for stockjobbing purposes and partly by the\r\nUltramontane press--even the English press being according to his\r\nassertions under Ultramontane influence. In the authoritative work\r\n'Bismarck: his Reflections and Reminiscences' it is lightly dismissed\r\nas an elaborate fiction. 'So far was I from entertaining any such idea\r\nat the time, or afterwards, that I would rather have resigned than\r\nlent a hand in picking a quarrel which would have had no other motive\r\nthan preventing France from recovering her breath and her strength.'\r\nBusch, in his better-known narrative, is also discreetly reticent on\r\nthe subject, and the only reference to it occurs in some notes dictated\r\nto him by Bismarck in 1879. 'As far back as 1874 the threads of the\r\nGortschakoff-Jomini policy are to be found in the foreign press--oglings\r\nand advances towards an intimacy between Russia and France of _la\r\nrevanche_. The rejection of these addresses is due rather to France\r\nthan to Russia. This policy does not appear to have originated with the\r\nEmperor Alexander. It culminated in the period 1875-77, when the rumour\r\nwas circulated that Gortschakoff had saved France from us, and when he\r\nbegan one of his circular despatches with the words, _Maintenant la\r\npaix est assurée_. You remember Blowitz's report in the _Times_. Read\r\nit again and mention the matter. His account was correct, except when\r\nhe spoke of an anti-French military party in Prussia. No such party\r\nexisted.'\r\n\r\nIt is instructive to compare with these passages the statements made in\r\nthe 'Memoirs and Letters of Sir Robert Morier.'\r\n\r\nThe crisis was definitely passed when Lord Lyons returned to Paris,\r\nand he found the French overflowing with gratitude for the exertions\r\nof Her Majesty's Government in favour of peace. Both Marshal MacMahon\r\nand the Duc Décazes were profuse in their expressions, and the latter,\r\nin particular, said that he attached immense importance to the fact\r\nthat the same sentiments in favour of peace had been expressed\r\nsimultaneously at Berlin by England and Russia. At the same time, while\r\nmuch encouraged at the thought that the danger of an attack from Germany\r\nhad been averted, he affirmed very positively that he should not on\r\nthis account relax his endeavours to avoid giving umbrage to the German\r\nGovernment. On its being pointed out to him that it was obvious that\r\nthe vast and increasing sums which figured in the Budget of the French\r\nWar Department had produced in Germany a very general impression that\r\nFrance was preparing for an immediate retaliatory war, he gave the\r\nsomewhat unconvincing assurance that a vote for clothing the reserve\r\nwould be struck out, but would be replaced by a supplementary vote\r\nintroduced in the winter, when a vote for clothing might seem 'natural\r\nand unimportant.' According to Décazes, both the Emperor of Russia and\r\nGortschakoff had, on more than one occasion, used language which showed\r\nthat they viewed with satisfaction the efforts of France to restore her\r\nmilitary power, and he endeavoured to impress upon the Ambassador that\r\nHolland first, and then Belgium, were next to France most in danger from\r\nGerman ambition. Finally, he pointed out with great satisfaction that\r\nRussia had not lent an ear to the offers which had, he presumed, been\r\nmade to her at Berlin, to forward any ambitious views she might have in\r\nthe East, and he said that he considered this particularly important,\r\nbecause it removed the only obstacle which might have interfered\r\nwith a cordial co-operation, on the part of the British and Russian\r\nGovernments, for the preservation of the peace of Europe. Whether any\r\nsuch offers were made or refused is not known, but as the next few years\r\nwere to show, Décazes's conclusion was about as faulty a one as could\r\nwell be imagined.\r\n\r\n     'As regards public opinion in this country,' said Lord Lyons.\r\n     'I find no diminution of the conviction that at the present moment\r\n     a war with Germany would be fatal to France, and that very many\r\n     years must elapse before France will be able to undertake such\r\n     a war with any prospect of success. All Frenchmen are earnestly\r\n     desirous that their army should be as speedily as possible placed\r\n     upon such a footing as to give them some security against attack,\r\n     and some influence in the world--but few look forward to there\r\n     being a time when they can contend with Germany, unless they have a\r\n     powerful ally to fight beside them in the field.\r\n\r\n     'In the meantime I must confess that the gratitude towards\r\n     England, which I hear expressed by men of all parties, far exceeds\r\n     anything that I could have expected. On the one hand it shows\r\n     perhaps the greatness of the terror from which the French have just\r\n     been relieved; but on the other, it is, I think, an indication of a\r\n     sincere disposition to accept heartily and ungrudgingly any proof\r\n     of good will from England.'\r\n\r\nThe insurrection in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which broke out in the\r\nsummer of 1875, and the Turkish bankruptcy which followed a little\r\nlater, provided the French with fresh cause for apprehension, as it\r\nwas realized that the Eastern Question was once again reopened, and\r\nthat any differences that might arise between England and Russia would\r\nbe to the disadvantage of France. The French, who now saw the hand of\r\nBismarck in everything, believed that he had a plan of sending the\r\nAustrian army into the Herzegovina, and the Russian army into some other\r\npart of Turkey, with a view to sending the German army into France, and\r\nmuch as the Government would have liked to have done something for the\r\nFrench bondholders, and at the same time to have recovered some of the\r\ninfluence formerly enjoyed at Constantinople, it was afraid to take any\r\naction which might irritate the omnipotent chancellor. Perhaps this\r\nwas just as well, as far as England was concerned. The project of a\r\nEuropean Conference at Constantinople, which had been already mooted,\r\ndid not appear in any way to be conducive to British interests. Austria\r\nand Russia were not in agreement as to the policy to be pursued. The\r\nformer had every reason to fear a Slav development on the frontier.\r\nOn the other hand, the Emperor of Russia could not, even if he wished\r\nit, afford to disregard the feeling of the Russians in favour of\r\ntheir fellows in race and in religion. Both Andrassy and Gortschakoff\r\nforeseeing that neither could obtain a solution entirely acceptable to\r\nopinion in his own country, desired apparently to throw a part of the\r\nresponsibility on a European Conference. But in such a Conference Russia\r\nwould be supreme. France and Germany would bid against each other for\r\nher favour. Austria would be afraid to set herself against her, and if\r\nEngland had any different views, she would always be outvoted.\r\n\r\nAttention was shortly, however, diverted to another quarter. On November\r\n17, Lord Derby learnt that it was absolutely necessary for the Khedive\r\nto procure between three and four millions sterling before the end of\r\nthe month, and that he was preparing to sell his Suez Canal Shares.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Derby to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    10, Downing Street, Whitehall, Nov. 17, 1875.\r\n\r\n     I am not quite easy in my mind about a story I hear, to the\r\n     effect that the Khedive is negotiating with a French Company for\r\n     the sale of his interest in the Suez Canal. If the telegram has not\r\n     been sent to you officially, I will enclose it. Now his bias has\r\n     always hitherto been against the pretensions of Lesseps, and he has\r\n     been of use to us in keeping that rather irrepressible gentleman in\r\n     order. If he withdraws from the concern, and a French Company takes\r\n     his place in it, our position will be very unfavourably altered.\r\n     Have you heard anything of the negotiations in question? I really\r\n     think the matter very serious, and it is one of which the English\r\n     public will fully understand the importance.\r\n\r\n     I think I am not violating any confidence in enclosing to you\r\n     for your personal use only an extract from Odo Russell's letter to\r\n     me received on Monday which seems to throw light on the situation.\r\n     I can add to it nothing in the way of comment.\r\n\r\n     Your information as to the position of the French Government\r\n     is satisfactory. It looks as if the worst of their troubles were\r\n     over.\r\n\r\n     P.S.--Since I began this note I have received further details,\r\n     which I send you, and, I may add in strict confidence that we are\r\n     prepared ourselves to take over the Viceroy's interest, if it\r\n     cannot be kept out of French hands by other means.\r\n\r\n     I find Lord Odo's letter is with the Prime Minister, so the\r\n     extract I promised must wait till next messenger.\r\n\r\nThe result of Lord Lyons's inquiries, which had to be made very\r\ndiscreetly, so as not to create suspicion, was the discovery that the\r\nKhedive was actively negotiating with a French Company, but it was\r\nbelieved that he wanted to mortgage, and not to sell the shares. Lord\r\nDerby's next letter to Lord Lyons shows how reluctantly he took action.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Nov. 19, 1875.\r\n\r\n     From General Stanton's[14] telegrams it appears that the\r\n     Khedive has no intention of selling his interest in the Suez Canal,\r\n     though he may be obliged to mortgage it for a time. He has promised\r\n     to give us notice, if, from any cause, he should change his mind,\r\n     and to give us the option of purchase.\r\n\r\n     I sincerely hope we may not be driven to that expedient. The\r\n     acquisition would be a bad one financially, and the affair might\r\n     involve us in disagreeable correspondence both with France and\r\n     the Porte. But there is a strong feeling here about not letting\r\n     the Canal go still more exclusively into French hands, and as we\r\n     contribute nearly four-fifths of the traffic, it cannot be said\r\n     that this jealousy is unreasonable. There are intrigues of all\r\n     sorts going on at Cairo, but I think we may reckon on the Khedive\r\n     being true to us, if not tempted too strongly. I rely on you to\r\n     tell me all you hear on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe memorandum of Lord Odo Russell referred to by Lord Derby is a lucid\r\nexposition of the European situation at the time and of Bismarck's\r\nattitude with regard to the other Powers, more especially Russia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Berlin, Nov. 12, 1875.\r\n\r\n     Bülow is loquacious and straightforward on most subjects; but\r\n     his reticence on Oriental affairs is remarkable. I have repeatedly\r\n     tried the experiment of talking over what the newspapers say, to\r\n     draw him out, but he becomes silent and embarrassed, and seeks to\r\n     change the subject, and when questioned, replies that he has not\r\n     lately received any information from Constantinople.\r\n\r\n     I have in consequence tried to find out through confidential\r\n     sources what it all means, and putting two and two together, I\r\n     make out that Bismarck feels uncertain of Russia, and does not\r\n     wish to be committed too soon. Since Gortschakoff assumed the post\r\n     of peacemaker between France and Germany, Bismarck has failed to\r\n     re-establish confidential relations with Russia. In regard to\r\n     Oriental affairs, Gortschakoff, instead of being satisfied to act\r\n     with his German and Austrian allies exclusively, has sought to\r\n     keep up an equally balanced understanding with England, France and\r\n     Italy: from which Bismarck suspects that Gortschakoff does not mean\r\n     to let him have his own way and wishes to control Germany through\r\n     the united action and agreement of the other European Powers. This\r\n     does not suit his book, and above all, he fears that Russia wishes\r\n     to keep on good terms with England and France; which would, in his\r\n     opinion, neutralize the exclusive action of the three Northern\r\n     Powers, over which he hoped to establish his own influence to the\r\n     exclusion of all other Governments. By lending his assistance to\r\n     Russia in the East, he calculated on Russian neutrality in regard\r\n     to his own plans, as was the case during the late war with France.\r\n\r\n     The joint action of Russia and England last May, in the\r\n     interest of peace, took him by surprise, destroyed his fondest\r\n     calculations, and left him isolated and disappointed to reflect\r\n     on the possibility of a peace coalition against Germany, which he\r\n     could not break up without the certainty of Russian neutrality\r\n     or assistance. He feels that Gortschakoff has abandoned him for\r\n     the time being, that he has lost the confidence of the Emperor\r\n     Alexander, and that while they live, there is but little hope of\r\n     a change of policy in Russia, favourable to his plans--viz. the\r\n     breaking up of Austria and the neutralization of the minor German\r\n     sovereignties.\r\n\r\n     Bismarck reckoned much on his friend Schouvaloff, but\r\n     Schouvaloff turned traitor last May, and is less German in England\r\n     than he was in Russia, which Bismarck cynically attributed to the\r\n     influence of wine and women.\r\n\r\n     Now Bismarck, I am told, affects honest indignation at the\r\n     manner in which Russia is deceiving and misleading Austria in\r\n     regard to Turkey; but in what that consists, I do not yet clearly\r\n     understand.\r\n\r\n     When he returns to Berlin he may possibly speak to me on these\r\n     subjects, and I should be glad to know whether there is anything in\r\n     particular which you may wish me to say, or not to say.\r\n\r\n     On the whole the present situation of affairs seems to me\r\n     favourable to the maintenance of peace.\r\n\r\n     Of course we must be prepared for an occupation of some\r\n     portions of European Turkey by Austria and Russia, but that need\r\n     not necessarily lead to war.\r\n\r\n     I have also endeavoured to find out what the views of\r\n     the National Party in regard to the East really are, and I\r\n     find that the breaking up of European Turkey would be received\r\n     with satisfaction, for the Turk has no friends in Germany. The\r\n     German provinces of Austria are looked upon as the natural and\r\n     inevitable inheritance, sooner or later, of the German Empire,\r\n     for which Austria might be compensated in Turkey, with or without\r\n     Constantinople. Some people talk wildly of giving Constantinople\r\n     to Greece, as less likely to be objected to by the Western Powers.\r\n     But even Russia might take possession of Constantinople without\r\n     objection on the part of Germany. Anything calculated to break the\r\n     influence of France in the East, which is still thought to be too\r\n     great, would be popular in Germany, and more especially if the\r\n     interests of the Latin Church could be injured by it.\r\n\r\n     England may have Egypt if she likes. Germany will graciously\r\n     not object.\r\n\r\n     Since May it has become manifest that Russia has the power\r\n     to hamper the movements of Germany and arrest her progress\r\n     effectually, and that Germany can undertake nothing new without\r\n     the passive consent of Russia. This power must be so intolerable\r\n     to Bismarck that he is sure to exercise all his skill in drawing\r\n     Russia out of the combined arms of the Great Powers, back into\r\n     his own exclusive embrace. This, a difference between Russia and\r\n     Austria about Turkey, might enable him to achieve.\r\n\r\n     Bismarck's endeavours last winter to make us suspicious of\r\n     Russia, and _vice versâ_, are now fully explained. His failure must\r\n     add to the general irritation he suffers from.\r\n\r\n     The situation will become clearer when he returns to Berlin in\r\n     the course of the winter.\r\n\r\nLord Odo Russell's view of the situation tallied with what Gortschakoff\r\nhad said to Décazes, Thiers, and other people at Vevey, earlier in the\r\nyear. The preservation of peace seemed, therefore, to rest largely on\r\nRussia, and it was unfortunate that the Eastern Question presented\r\nitself in a form which certainly favoured Bismarck's efforts to create\r\ndifferences between Russia and Austria, and between Russia and England.\r\n\r\nFurther inquiries in Paris with regard to the Khedive's action seemed to\r\nconfirm the view that he was seeking to mortgage the shares, but to whom\r\nthey were to be mortgaged was unknown. On November 27, there arrived\r\nthrough Lord Tenterden, Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office, the\r\nintelligence that Her Majesty's Government had bought the shares.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Tenterden to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, Nov. 25, 1875.\r\n\r\n     Lord Derby is ill and at home. I am not sure therefore whether\r\n     he is writing to you to-night to tell you about the Suez Canal.\r\n     General Stanton telegraphed that Lesseps (supposed to be backed\r\n     by French Government) was offering four millions sterling (fr.\r\n     100,000,000) for the Khedive's shares, but that the Khedive would\r\n     sell them to England for the same sum. Thereupon he was instructed\r\n     to offer this amount, and the Khedive accepted this morning. The\r\n     contract was signed to-day, as we have just heard by telegram.\r\n     Messrs. Rothschild advance the money on the security of the shares,\r\n     £1,000,000 in December, and the rest by instalments, the Khedive\r\n     to pay 5 per cent. on the shares while they remain without bearing\r\n     interest (the interest being hypothecated for the next twenty\r\n     years).\r\n\r\n     Her Majesty's Government are to apply to Parliament to take\r\n     the bargain off the Rothschilds' hands.\r\n\r\n     Practically, therefore, subject to Parliament's assent, Her\r\n     Majesty's Government have bought the shares.\r\n\r\n     I am writing in the greatest hurry but the above is a correct\r\n     outline of the case.\r\n\r\n     I suppose the French will make an ugly face.\r\n\r\n     P.S. It has all been kept very secret so far, so pray be\r\n     supposed to be ignorant till Lord Derby tells you.\r\n\r\nThe action of Her Majesty's Government was taken none too soon, for\r\nas Lord Lyons reported, the shares very nearly fell into the hands of\r\nthe French. On November 26 the purchase of the shares was publicly\r\nannounced, and on the following day Lord Derby had an interview with the\r\nFrench Ambassador on the subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Derby to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, Nov. 27, 1875.\r\n\r\n     I have seen d'Harcourt. He came to hear what I could tell him\r\n     about the Suez affair, and I told him the whole story exactly as it\r\n     is.\r\n\r\n     He says that there will be some soreness in France, and I am\r\n     afraid he is right. You know the facts, and I need not therefore\r\n     repeat them. The points which I dwelt on were these:\r\n\r\n     We did not wish that the Khedive would sell, nor was there on\r\n     our part the slightest desire to alter the _status quo_. But we\r\n     could not help his selling, and as he had decided on doing so, we\r\n     took the only effectual steps to prevent the possibility of the\r\n     shares falling into hands whose possession of them might not be\r\n     favourable to our interests. The suddenness of the whole affair was\r\n     not our doing. If we had delayed, other purchasers would have come\r\n     forward. We had to take the opportunity as it offered itself or\r\n     lose it altogether.\r\n\r\n     It is not in the power of the British Government to act\r\n     as Continental Governments can, through third parties--banks,\r\n     financial companies, and the like. What we do, we must do openly,\r\n     and in our own names, so that Parliament may judge of the whole\r\n     transaction. This I said in answer to a remark made by d'Harcourt,\r\n     that the act would have had less political significance if done\r\n     through some company, or otherwise, and not directly in the name of\r\n     the State.\r\n\r\n     We hold even now a minority of the canal shares. The question\r\n     for us is not one of establishing an exclusive interest, but of\r\n     preventing an exclusive interest from being established as against\r\n     us.\r\n\r\n     I have always expressed my opinion that the best arrangement\r\n     for all the world would be the placing of the Canal under an\r\n     International Commission, like that of the Danube; and I think so\r\n     still. I knew, I said, that the French Government were not prepared\r\n     to entertain any such idea, and I therefore did not put it forward;\r\n     but if France and other Governments altered their way of thinking,\r\n     I did not think any difficulties would be made by England.\r\n\r\n     M. d'Harcourt expressed some fear, or at least thought that\r\n     some would be felt, lest the Khedive should be unable to pay his\r\n     promised £200,000 a year, and we in consequence should use some\r\n     means to coerce him, which would practically establish England in\r\n     authority in Egypt. I assured him that nothing was further from our\r\n     thoughts. We wanted the passage through Egypt as free for ourselves\r\n     as for the rest of the world, and we wanted nothing more.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of the Suez Canal shares has always been surrounded\r\nwith much glamour and mystery, but in reality it seems to have been\r\na perfectly straightforward and business-like proceeding, to which\r\nno reasonable objection could be taken. So far from being a profound\r\npolitical _coup_ long calculated in advance, the action of Her\r\nMajesty's Government was totally unpremeditated, and as far as Lord\r\nDerby was concerned, it was undertaken with reluctance, and under the\r\nconviction that England was making a bad bargain. So little confidence\r\ndid Lord Derby feel, and so averse was he from incurring any further\r\nresponsibility in Egypt, that he unhesitatingly declined a new\r\nproposal of the Khedive that he should sell to the British Government\r\nhis contingent interest in the profits of the Suez Canal above five\r\nper cent., and informed the French of the fact. The British public,\r\nwhich warmly approved the transaction, seems to have been a better\r\njudge of the Foreign Secretary's action than he was himself. The four\r\nmillions' worth of shares acquired by the British Government represented\r\nnine-twentieths of the entire amount, and it is interesting to compare\r\nthese figures with the estimate put upon the value of the Canal by\r\nLesseps. On July 11, 1874, the latter called upon Lord Lyons and said\r\nthat two persons from England had sounded him about the sale of the\r\nCanal; one a member of the English branch of the Rothschild family, and\r\nthe other a Baron Emile d'Erlanger, a well-known banker living in Paris.\r\n\r\n     The Rothschild was no doubt Nathaniel,[15] M.P. for Aylesbury,\r\n     who was here in the beginning of June. Lesseps said that on being\r\n     pressed by him to state a sum, for which the Canal might be\r\n     purchased, he had said a milliard (£40,000,000) and he declared\r\n     that although this sum had startled even a Rothschild, it was only\r\n     a fair one. His object with me seemed to be to give the impression\r\n     that the shareholders would not sell the Canal for any sum.[16]\r\n\r\nAlthough the French could hardly be expected to approve of the action\r\nof the British Government, which, if it had occurred some years earlier,\r\nwould have caused a storm of indignation, they were, under existing\r\ncircumstances, forced to accept it with tolerable equanimity, as it was\r\nof no use to add a coolness with England to their other difficulties;\r\nand, in addition, they gained a great deal by the rise which took place\r\nin Canal shares and Egyptian securities. Lesseps professed himself to\r\nbe delighted and Bismarck sent a message to say that the policy adopted\r\nby Her Majesty's Government had met with the support of the German\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: French Military Attaché at Berlin before the war of 1870.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: French Ambassador at St. Petersburg.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Finance Minister.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Lord Lyons to Lord Granville, Jan. 16, 1874.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Blowitz.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: British Minister at Brussels.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: German Ambassador at London.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: British Consul-General at Cairo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Now Lord Rothschild.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Lord Lyons to Lord Derby, July 11, 1874.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE EASTERN QUESTION\r\n\r\n(1876-1878)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn January, 1876, the gradual spread of the insurrection in Turkey\r\nled to the concoction by the three Imperial Powers of the so-called\r\n'Andrassy Note,' and the great question was whether England would\r\nconsent to take part in its presentation, in view of her traditional\r\nattitude towards Turkey. Lord Derby, in a letter to Lord Lyons, stated\r\nthat Bismarck was very anxious that we should do so, and explained that\r\nalthough 'one can trust none of these Governments, it is as well to give\r\nthem credit for acting honestly until the reverse is proved,' and he was\r\ntherefore in favour of such a course himself. In a letter[17] addressed\r\nto Mr. Disraeli, asking for his views on the subject, Lord Derby\r\nremarked that: \"It is too late to stand on the dignity and independence\r\nof the Sultan; a Sovereign who can neither keep the peace at home, nor\r\npay his debts, must expect to submit to some disagreeable consequences.\"\r\nLord Lyons, on being consulted, concurred with Lord Derby's views.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Derby._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Jan. 14, 1876.\r\n\r\n     I hardly see how England is to avoid supporting the Andrassy\r\n     Note. If we stand aloof we shall stand alone. If our secession\r\n     produces no effect and the Turks still accept, we shall be in\r\n     the same foolish position France was in 1840; with this serious\r\n     inconvenience, that if the Andrassy plan fails in pacifying the\r\n     Herzegovina, we shall be blamed for the failure, as having caused\r\n     it by breaking up the unanimity of Europe. If the Turks do not\r\n     accept, they will be ready enough to throw the responsibility upon\r\n     us, and to call upon us to get them out of the scrape into which\r\n     they will get with the other Powers. I think that by consenting we\r\n     should leave the Powers least excuse for attacking Turkey, or at\r\n     all events, least excuse for pushing on without consulting us. I\r\n     should not be for qualifying our support too much, for, if we do,\r\n     the failure of the plan, which is in my opinion more than probable,\r\n     will still be attributed to us, and a support, given as it were\r\n     against our will, and restricted to the least possible amount, will\r\n     be treated very much as opposition. I say all this because you ask\r\n     me to tell you what I think: but there are two important elements\r\n     for forming an opinion which I lack. I mean a knowledge of public\r\n     opinion in England, and a knowledge of the real feelings of the\r\n     three Empires towards each other.\r\n\r\n     The despatch from Odo Russell looks as if Bismarck was\r\n     preparing for the possibility of a quarrel with Russia. Ever since\r\n     1870 he has been very naturally trying to turn every opportunity\r\n     of dividing England from France to account. But since you joined\r\n     Russia in insisting upon peace last year, and still more since\r\n     the purchase of the Suez Canal shares, he has no doubt formed a\r\n     higher opinion of England, and conceived the idea that she still\r\n     has the will and the means to play a foremost part in European\r\n     politics. Like everybody else, he feels sure that if there is a\r\n     quarrel between Russia and Germany, France will side with Russia.\r\n     In order to prevent his enemy being all powerful at sea, he must\r\n     have the English fleet not merely neutral, but on his side. The\r\n     only advantage he can offer to England is support on the Eastern\r\n     Question, and it is on this question that he would have the best\r\n     chance of embroiling her with Russia. What part he means Austria to\r\n     play, I find it more difficult to guess. That he intends some day,\r\n     and by some means, to annex German Austria to the German Empire I\r\n     make no doubt, but I suppose he is in no hurry to add so large a\r\n     Roman Catholic and Southern population to the electors of the Diet\r\n     of the Empire.\r\n\r\n     The worst service we could render France at present would\r\n     be to set up a separate understanding with her in opposition to\r\n     Germany.\r\n\r\nThe French Government was desperately anxious that England should not\r\nseparate herself from the other Powers, partly from fear that such\r\naction would cause European complications, and partly because it was\r\nparticularly desirous of getting credit with Russia for having brought\r\nEnglish opinion round to Russian views. Her Majesty's Government finally\r\ndecided to join in the Andrassy Note, although it would appear from Lord\r\nDerby's language, that the Cabinet were not unanimous on the question.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile French internal politics remained in the same confused and\r\nunsatisfactory state which had prevailed for so long. The divisions\r\namongst the Conservatives had made Monarchical Government in any form\r\nimpossible, and yet they refused to acquiesce, even temporarily, in the\r\nmoderate form of Republic which had been established, and seemed bent\r\nupon doing all they could to exchange their King Log for a King Stork\r\nin the shape of a Red Republic. The elections which took place in the\r\nbeginning of the year 1876 resulted in large Republican majorities both\r\nin the Senate and in the Chamber, and in the case of the former, this\r\nresult was singularly unfortunate for Marshal MacMahon, as it deprived\r\nhim of the power of forcing a dissolution. A letter from Lord Lyons to\r\nthe Prince of Wales, who was on his way back from India, summarizes the\r\nFrench internal situation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 7, 1876.\r\n\r\n     I cannot give your Royal Highness a very satisfactory\r\n     account of French politics, although I do not take so gloomy a\r\n     view of them as many Frenchmen do. The large number of advanced\r\n     Republicans in the new Chamber of Deputies, the not inconsiderable\r\n     number of Ultra-Radicals, and the complete defeat of the Moderate\r\n     Conservatives in the Elections not unnaturally frighten the upper\r\n     classes of Frenchmen. But in fact so many of the members are quite\r\n     new men, that one cannot foresee how parties will group themselves.\r\n     The Chambers meet to-morrow, and in about a month's time it will\r\n     be possible to form an opinion as to how things are likely to go.\r\n     So long as Marshal MacMahon is at the head of the State and of the\r\n     army, there can be no fear of any serious disturbance of material\r\n     order; and if he is at the same time firm and conciliatory with the\r\n     new Chamber, and willing to take a Ministry from the more moderate\r\n     members of the majority, he will very probably be rewarded by\r\n     finding how tame demagogues can become in office. I understand the\r\n     Marshal insists upon having Ministers of War and Foreign Affairs\r\n     whom he knows and in whom he has confidence, but that he is willing\r\n     to let the other Departments be filled by men taken in the ordinary\r\n     way from the majority.\r\n\r\n     So far we have not this year been disturbed, as we were\r\n     last spring, by rumours of war, and agriculture and commerce are\r\n     flourishing in France, and the revenue goes on increasing.\r\n\r\n     Of the Egyptian Financial Question Your Royal Highness\r\n     will learn all particulars on the spot. Neither that, nor the\r\n     Herzegovina question are settled at this moment, but we must hope\r\n     that they are on the eve of being settled.\r\n\r\nOne of the new features in the French political situation was the\r\nrecovery by Gambetta of his former influence, and as he was now a person\r\nof considerable influence, Sheffield was utilized for the purpose of\r\neliciting his views. The late Mr. George Sheffield, who acted as Lord\r\nLyons's private secretary for over twenty years, was a well-known\r\nfigure in the political and social world of Paris, and included in\r\nhis acquaintance most people both there and in London who were worth\r\nknowing. Not only did he enjoy much personal popularity, but as he was\r\nknown to be completely in Lord Lyons's confidence, he was the recipient\r\nof much confidential information, and generally believed to be a model\r\nof discretion. One of his peculiarities was that, in spite of much\r\npractice, he spoke very imperfect French with an atrocious accent, but\r\nthis circumstance never appeared to prejudice him in any way, and it\r\nmay incidentally be noted that the possession of what is called a good\r\nFrench accent is a much overrated accomplishment in France itself.\r\nFrenchmen rarely wish to listen; they desire to talk themselves and\r\nto be listened to; to them, as a rule, a foreigner is a foreigner and\r\nnothing more, and whether he speaks French well or ill, they seldom\r\nnotice and rarely care.\r\n\r\nGambetta, having secured a listener in the person of Sheffield, was no\r\ndoubt delighted to expound his views on the situation. First of all,\r\nspeaking on the subject of Bonapartist successes at the elections, he\r\nsaid that Bonapartism would die out as soon as it was realized that a\r\nmoderate Republic was firmly established. He expressed great delight at\r\nthe fall of Thiers (Thiers had once described him as a _fou furieux_),\r\nand said that under him no real self-acting Republic could ever have\r\nbeen formed, that it would have fallen to pieces at his death, and\r\nindeed that the best thing Thiers could do for the Republic would be to\r\ndie. For Marshal MacMahon's entourage he had a great dislike, but for\r\nthe Marshal himself much respect, and he aspired to be Prime Minister\r\nunder him--a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled,\r\nbut which the Décazes, Broglie, the Marshal's secretaries and the\r\nMaréchale and her friends would do their best to prevent him obtaining.\r\nHe professed confidence in being able to keep the extreme Radicals in\r\norder; said that the Red Flag was as obnoxious to him as the White Flag;\r\nthat he was not inclined to grant a general amnesty to the Communists,\r\nand that he would not agree to the re-establishment of the National\r\nGuard. He also professed himself to be in favour of Free Trade, and\r\nasserted that the commercial Treaty concluded by Napoleon III. accounted\r\nfor many of the Bonapartist successes.\r\n\r\nGambetta's aspiration of serving under the Marshal was never fulfilled,\r\nthe above-mentioned entourage being presumably too strong for him; but\r\nthe upper classes in France continued to look forward to the future\r\nwith undiminished apprehension. French capital, reversing the present\r\nprocess, began to pour steadily into England, and it was stated that the\r\nrich Radicals were not the last in sending their money abroad.\r\n\r\n     'Marshal MacMahon's position,' wrote Lord Lyons at the end\r\n     of March, 'does not improve. He has so little political knowledge\r\n     or ability that, as events have shown, he exercises little or no\r\n     personal influence in politics. There is also a jealousy springing\r\n     up with regard to Emmanuel d'Harcourt and other people about him\r\n     who are supposed to direct his political conduct. The officers\r\n     now at the head of the army would follow the Marshal very far in\r\n     any Conservative direction, but it may be questioned whether they\r\n     would submit patiently to being placed under a Radical Minister\r\n     of War--Gambetta for instance. It is the Marshal's political\r\n     intelligence that is doubted. No one has a word to say against his\r\n     disinterestedness, his honour, or his courage.'\r\n\r\nMarshal MacMahon, a simple and amiable soldier, who knew nothing about\r\npolitics, was credited with an overwhelming admiration for the capacity\r\nof his private secretary, Emmanuel d'Harcourt. Upon one occasion, the\r\nquestion of applying for the extradition of a criminal who had fled to\r\nAmerica was being discussed in his presence. 'Well,' said the Marshal,\r\n'we must telegraph at once to San Francisco.' 'Pardon, M. le Maréchal,'\r\ninterposed d'Harcourt, 'Washington, not San Francisco, is the capital of\r\nthe United States.' The Marshal was so astounded at the profundity of\r\nhis private secretary's knowledge that he was only able to ejaculate:\r\n'_Ce diable d'Harcourt! il sait tout!_'\r\n\r\nMany stories were told of his engaging simplicity of character, of\r\nwhich the following will serve as an instance. Upon one occasion he was\r\ninspecting a military academy, and was informed that there was present\r\na young Arab chieftain of distinguished lineage to whom it would be\r\ndesirable to address some words of encouragement. The young man was\r\nbrought up, whereupon the following brief colloquy ensued:--\r\n\r\n     Marshal: '_Ah! c'est vous qui êtes le nègre?_'\r\n\r\n     Arab Chief: '_Oui, M. le Maréchal._'\r\n\r\n     Marshal: '_Eh bien, mon garçon, continuez!_'\r\n\r\nBy a curious combination of circumstances, Marshal MacMahon, with his\r\ninadequate political and intellectual equipment, was still able for some\r\ntime to fill the place of a constitutional sovereign, and virtually the\r\nFrench were living under a constitutional Monarchy, with an Executive\r\npossessing large powers, rather than under a Republic. This state of\r\nthings, however, could not last for long, and it seemed as if the choice\r\nlay between the youthful Prince Imperial and the establishment of a\r\nreally Radical Republic.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the French had every reason to congratulate themselves,\r\nnamely, upon the re-organization of their army, and some of the\r\npolitical consequences which were likely to result from this increased\r\nand increasing military strength are pointed out in the following letter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Derby._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Sept. 26, 1876.\r\n\r\n     As soon as General Conolly finishes his visits to the Autumn\r\n     Manoeuvres and makes his reports, it may perhaps be desirable for\r\n     me to send you some observations on the political consequences of\r\n     the great progress the French Army is making. All the officers of\r\n     Foreign Armies and the English officers especially who have been\r\n     out with the French troops this autumn, seem to agree in regarding\r\n     the improvement as being undoubted and very considerable. In short,\r\n     it may not unreasonably be expected that in about three years from\r\n     this time, the French Army will be in such a state, that France\r\n     will count for as much or nearly as much, in the balance of power\r\n     in Europe, as she did before 1870.\r\n\r\n     The different phases of public opinion since the peace of\r\n     1871 may be described as follows. At first, rage and mortification\r\n     produced a wild and unreasoning cry for revenge. This was followed\r\n     by a depression almost amounting to despair. In this state of\r\n     things the rumours of an intended attack by Germany in 1875\r\n     produced nearly a panic. Since that time hope and confidence have\r\n     gradually returned. The general sentiment now is that France is\r\n     safely 'biding her time.'\r\n\r\n     Under the influence of this sentiment, the French acquiesce\r\n     patiently in the present apparent eclipse of French power; they\r\n     disapprove of any attempt on the part of the Government to put\r\n     itself prominently forward in European politics; they desire to\r\n     preserve peace and tranquillity in Europe at almost any price; they\r\n     wish to disarm suspicion, and to be allowed three or four years\r\n     more to recruit their strength. Their policy consequently is to\r\n     adjourn as far as possible all questions.\r\n\r\n     Their ultimate object in all they do, is to recover their lost\r\n     Provinces; but however confident they may be of recovering in a\r\n     few years their old position in the world, I do not believe that\r\n     they contemplate, as the immediate result, an attack upon Germany.\r\n     I do not think that they at all foresee a time at which they could\r\n     run the risk of making such an attack singlehanded. What they do\r\n     intend, is to put forward with vigour their own views with regard\r\n     to the numerous questions they now leave more or less in abeyance,\r\n     and to contract if possible foreign alliances on equal terms.\r\n\r\n     One of the questions with regard to which they will be\r\n     disposed to change their tone very considerably will be that of\r\n     Egypt.\r\n\r\n     Another may possibly be that of the Newfoundland Fisheries, if\r\n     we do not succeed in effecting some sort of settlement of it in the\r\n     meantime.\r\n\r\n     A third may be the extension of their possessions in Cochin\r\n     China, and of their protectorate of Annam.\r\n\r\n     With regard to alliances, that which they will first seek\r\n     will no doubt be the alliance of Russia, and in a case of great\r\n     emergency, they would make great sacrifices of Western interests to\r\n     obtain it.\r\n\r\n     They will desire to keep on good terms with England, so far\r\n     at all events as to avoid throwing her into the arms of Germany,\r\n     but as they are not likely to conceive hopes of obtaining effectual\r\n     assistance from England towards recovering Alsace and Lorraine,\r\n     they will not be so eager for an English as a Russian alliance.\r\n\r\n     Another contingency to be kept in view is that a new President\r\n     or a new Dynasty, desirous of consolidating themselves by a little\r\n     military glory, may be led to direct an attack upon whatever\r\n     quarter it may be easiest to do so.\r\n\r\n     I will not however go on with mere speculations of this kind.\r\n     Of the truth of the conclusions to which I have come, I entertain\r\n     very little doubt. In two or three years France will not be in the\r\n     same accommodating frame of mind in which she is now, and will\r\n     have very much more powerful means than she has now of enforcing\r\n     attention to her wishes. All questions therefore in which the\r\n     influence of France is hostile, should be settled as quickly as\r\n     possible. The restoration of the strength of France may be found\r\n     useful in redressing the balance of power, but, anyhow, it should\r\n     be taken into account in all political calculations.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before these anticipations were justified, but for the\r\npresent, relations between England and France remained on a friendly\r\nfooting, no doubt much to Bismarck's displeasure, who, at this period,\r\nwas continually urging us to take Egypt and not to do anything else.\r\nAs a matter of fact, if we had seized Egypt in 1876, it would not have\r\nhad the immediate effect of embroiling us with France. On the contrary,\r\nall those who had a pecuniary interest in Egypt thought that they would\r\ngain by our taking possession of the county, while the great majority\r\nof Frenchmen looked upon the thing as inevitable, and thought it better\r\nto put a good face upon the matter. Any contradiction of the supposed\r\nEnglish designs upon Egypt, however sincere and positive, met with no\r\ncredence at all.\r\n\r\nThere is an instructive extract on the subject, contained in a letter of\r\nLord Derby of December 6, 1876.\r\n\r\n     It is evidently useless to say that we don't want Egypt and\r\n     don't intend to take it: we must leave our friends to be convinced\r\n     by the event. I have no doubt that everybody out of France would\r\n     be glad that we should seize the country. Russia would like it, as\r\n     making us an accomplice in her plans. Germany would like it still\r\n     more, as ensuring our being on uncomfortable terms with France\r\n     for some years to come. Italy would see in it a precedent and a\r\n     justification for seizing Tunis; Spain, the same, in regard to\r\n     Morocco. But you may be assured that we have no such designs and\r\n     are not going to run into adventures of this kind.\r\n\r\nThere can be no possible doubt as to Lord Derby's sincerity; indeed,\r\nhe was so constitutionally averse from an adventurous foreign policy,\r\nthat a year or two later, Lord Salisbury said of his ex-colleague\r\nthat he could never have brought himself to annex the Isle of Man. It\r\nis interesting to note that, in the above forecast of international\r\nbrigandage, Tunis and not Tripoli was allotted to Italy, the designs of\r\nFrance in the former direction not apparently being suspected.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of 1876 the experiment of trying to work the institutions\r\nof a Constitutional Monarchy in France under an elective chief\r\nmagistrate had very nearly come to a deadlock. The Left were determined\r\nto get real power into their hands and not to allow themselves to be\r\nthwarted by the conservative tendencies of the Marshal and his personal\r\nfriends. On the one hand, the Marshal stoutly maintained that he would\r\nhave Ministers of his own choice in the Departments of War and Foreign\r\nAffairs, whereas the Left, so long as they had a majority in the\r\nChamber of Deputies, were, under Constitutional Government, clearly\r\nentitled to decide the matter. But the question was complicated, because\r\nthe Marshal, as well as the Ministers, was in a position to resort\r\nto resignation of office, and a severe Ministerial crisis ensued.\r\nUltimately, the Marshal succeeded in keeping his Minister of War and\r\nhis Minister for Foreign Affairs, but he was forced to accept, as Prime\r\nMinister, M. Jules Simon. The latter, although an able and conciliatory\r\nman, had been a member of the Revolutionary Government of National\r\nDefence, and having been forced to yield so far to his opponents, it\r\nseemed not improbable that the Marshal before long would be obliged to\r\nhave recourse to Gambetta himself. Gambetta, as has been shown, had\r\nlately become much more moderate in his views, but in the opinion of\r\nmany people he still represented the Red Spectre, and it was believed\r\nthat his assumption of office would mean Communism, Socialism, equal\r\ndivision of property, judges appointed by election for short periods,\r\nthe prohibition of marriage, and the suppression of religion. The\r\ndesire of the Bonapartists was that the Government should fall into\r\nthe hands of the extreme Left, in the hope that the people, from fear\r\nof the above contingencies, would clamour for the Empire; but what\r\nwas more remarkable was, that many Orleanists as well as moderate and\r\ntimid Conservatives wished to drive the Marshal to a dissolution in\r\nthe hope of a reaction. There could have been no better proof of their\r\nshort-sightedness and incapacity, for the mass of the electors were not\r\nin the least likely to make fine distinctions, and if really afraid of\r\nthe Republic would certainly vote for nothing short of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe Conference which had assembled at Constantinople in the autumn in\r\nthe hope of settling the Eastern Question, with Lord Salisbury as one of\r\nthe British representatives, broke up in January, 1877, and it became\r\nclear that war between Russia and Turkey was unavoidable. Lord Derby,\r\nwho was the reverse of sanguine by temperament, had never entertained\r\nany hopes of its success, and was quite determined that, whatever\r\nhappened, there should be no British intervention. 'I am amused,' he\r\nwrote to Lord Odo Russell,[18] 'by your description of the Russo-German\r\nsuspicions entertained against us; these fellows make us act as they\r\nwould act in our place. They can neither deal straightforwardly\r\nthemselves, nor give anybody else credit for doing so.\r\n\r\n'If you are asked what steps England is going to take next, your true\r\nanswer should be \"none.\" We shall wait, say little, and pledge ourselves\r\nto nothing.'\r\n\r\nThe break up of the Conference filled the French with alarm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Derby._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Feb. 5, 1877.\r\n\r\n     It is believed here that Bismarck is determined to produce at\r\n     least such a scare as he did two years ago, if not to do more. The\r\n     idea provokes some anger, but more fear. Nevertheless, the danger\r\n     is greater now than it was last time; for although France is very\r\n     far from being ready for even a defensive war, she does feel so\r\n     much stronger than she did in 1875, as not to be willing to bear\r\n     quite as much from Germany as she would have borne then.\r\n\r\n     The impressions prevalent here are:\r\n\r\n     That Bismarck is very much disappointed by the result of the\r\n     Constantinople Conference, which he had hoped would have ended by\r\n     setting all Europe by the ears.\r\n\r\n     That he is very much irritated by the cordiality which existed\r\n     between the English, French, and Russian Plenipotentiaries, and by\r\n     the considerable part taken by Chaudordy in the proceedings.\r\n\r\n     That he is very much annoyed by the number of Socialist votes\r\n     given in the recent German elections, and is eager to destroy Paris\r\n     as the hotbed of socialism.\r\n\r\n     That he wants a cry to make the Germans pay their taxes\r\n     willingly.\r\n\r\n     That he looks with an evil eye upon the material prosperity of\r\n     France.\r\n\r\n     That he considers the Exhibition of 1878 as a sort of defiance\r\n     of Germany, and is ready to go great lengths to prevent its taking\r\n     place.\r\n\r\n     These are French views, not mine; but I do agree with the\r\n     conclusion which the greater and the wiser part of the French\r\n     nation draw from them: namely that it behoves France to be more\r\n     than ever prudent and cautious, and more than ever careful not to\r\n     give Germany any pretext for a quarrel.\r\n\r\n     France is certainly not at all likely to oppose Russia in\r\n     anything that country may undertake in the East; but she is still\r\n     less likely to give her any military assistance there. She might\r\n     not be able to resist the bait, if Russia held it out, of an\r\n     offensive and defensive alliance against Germany, but in that\r\n     case she would more than ever want her own forces on this side of\r\n     Germany. This contingency, however, is too improbable to be worth\r\n     considering.\r\n\r\n     It is quite true that France has a large force on her Eastern\r\n     Frontier, and that she is hard at work there, but considering the\r\n     difficulty of guarding that frontier, such as it has been left by\r\n     the Treaty of 1871, her objects may well be supposed to be purely\r\n     defensive.\r\n\r\n     Lord Salisbury is to arrive this evening and to go on to\r\n     London without stopping.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that Lord Salisbury, while at Constantinople,\r\nformed a very poor opinion of the capacity of Sultan Abdul Hamid--an\r\nopinion which he must have had occasion to revise later on. 'Salisbury\r\nreports ill of the new Sultan; calls him a poor weak creature, from whom\r\nno help is to be expected. But his judgment is the result of a single\r\ninterview.' So wrote Lord Derby to Lord Odo Russell.\r\n\r\nThe French representative, Chaudordy, had been very active; his zeal\r\nhad alarmed his own countrymen, and was supposed to have aroused\r\nthe indignation of Bismarck, but one of the singular features of\r\nthe Constantinople Conference seems to have been the action of the\r\nrepresentatives of the small Powers such as Spain, Belgium, and Holland,\r\nwho did their utmost, and not entirely without effect, to spirit the\r\nTurks up to resistance. In March there was much coming and going at\r\nParis on the part of Ignatieff and Schouvaloff, who were thought to be\r\nendeavouring to secure what Russia wanted without war, and the former\r\nproceeded on a special mission to London, but the negotiations with the\r\nTurks broke down, and war was declared before the end of April. Letters\r\nfrom Lord Derby describing the state of feeling in England dwell upon\r\nthe action of Gladstone, who, according to Schouvaloff, 'was much more\r\nRussian than the Russian Government,' and whose language was, 'only\r\nsuited to a Panslavonic Society.'\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of the war between Russia and Turkey was extremely\r\ndistasteful to the French for various reasons. They were convinced that\r\nit had been instigated by Bismarck, and that it would result in the\r\noverwhelming preponderance of Germany on the continent, and were equally\r\nconvinced that it would lead to a great extension of English influence\r\nin the Mediterranean including an occupation of Egypt; consequently,\r\nDécazes, who was anything but a straightforward politician, and anxious\r\nbeyond everything to hunt with the Russian hounds, and run with the\r\nEnglish hare, was constantly expressing fears that if an English\r\nforce was sent to the East, the opportunity would at once be seized\r\nby Bismarck for falling upon France. A congenial opportunity for this\r\nintriguer arose over the question whether Egypt should be called upon to\r\nrender pecuniary and military assistance to Turkey, and an unsuccessful\r\nattempt was made to persuade the Khedive that if he refused to comply,\r\nhe would be protected. By these means Décazes would have secured the\r\ntreble advantage of making himself agreeable to Russia, of pleasing the\r\nFrench bondholders, and, to a certain degree, of thwarting England in\r\nEgypt. Unluckily for him, the scheme miscarried; but in spite of ardent\r\nprofessions of neutrality, he contrived to render services to Russia\r\nwhich were of some considerable service.\r\n\r\nHe used his influence to obtain a loan for her in Paris; his agents in\r\nEgypt supported the Russian threats to blockade the Suez Canal, and\r\nthe effect of the Franco-Russian understanding was to force Germany to\r\nmake greater sacrifices in order to retain the friendship of Russia by\r\nfurthering Russian policy in the East. One of the methods by which the\r\nGermans sought to ingratiate themselves with Russia took the remarkable\r\nform of insisting (as the British Ambassador at Constantinople pointed\r\nout) that Russian subjects who remained in Turkey during the war, should\r\nnot only be entitled to remain there undisturbed, but permitted to enjoy\r\nall the privileges of the capitulations, this being apparently the\r\nGerman conception of neutrality.\r\n\r\nThe double game which Décazes was playing was not, however, popular in\r\nFrance. It was felt that his intrigues with Russia tended to throw\r\nEngland into the arms of Germany, and his enemies asserted that he\r\nwas too fond of speculation to be a thoroughly satisfactory Minister.\r\nHowever, an internal political crisis of an exceptionally important\r\nnature in May diverted French attention from all foreign questions for\r\nthe time being.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Derby._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 16, 1877.\r\n\r\n     The Marshal has been getting more and more uncomfortable about\r\n     M. Jules Simon's giving way in the Chamber of Deputies to the more\r\n     advanced Left, and now, as you will have learnt from my telegrams,\r\n     he has turned him out. It is believed that if matters came to\r\n     extremities, the Marshal will bring out a thoroughly reactionary\r\n     Ministry which he has _in petto_. The Duc de Broglie, Prime\r\n     Minister, General Ducrot, Minister of War, and so on. This would\r\n     necessitate a dissolution, for which the consent of the Senate\r\n     would be necessary. But it is very doubtful whether the country is\r\n     ripe for anything of the kind, and whether the result might not be\r\n     the return of a still more radical Chamber than the present; and\r\n     then either the Marshal must retire and hand the Government over to\r\n     Gambetta or some one still more advanced in opinion, or make a real\r\n     _coup d'état_ by means of the army.\r\n\r\n     However he will no doubt try to form a Ministry rather more\r\n     Conservative than the last and still able to get on somehow with\r\n     the present Chamber of Deputies; but this will be difficult.\r\n\r\n     One of the Marshal's grounds of dissatisfaction with M. Jules\r\n     Simon was that he would not, or could not, get from the Chamber\r\n     powers which would enable the Government to restrain the press from\r\n     attacking Germany in the dangerous manner in which it has written\r\n     against that country lately.\r\n\r\nThe action of the Marshal in turning out Jules Simon, who was supported\r\nby a majority in a recently elected Chamber, and replacing him by the\r\nDuc de Broglie, who was extremely unpopular, might well be described\r\nas a very strong measure. Décazes, who was supposed to be in the plot,\r\nremained in office, and there was therefore not much probability of a\r\nchange in foreign policy; but it was evident that there were now only\r\ntwo real parties in France--the Republicans and the Bonapartists. The\r\npossible restoration of the Empire filled with dismay Lord Derby, who\r\nconsidered that the last six years had witnessed a great purification\r\nboth of public and private life in France, and that if the French were\r\ngoing back to a 'Government of adventurers, adventuresses, and priests,'\r\nit would be a grave misfortune for Europe; and he was most anxious to\r\nlet it be known that there was no sympathy in England for Bonapartist\r\nintrigues.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Derby._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 18, 1877.\r\n\r\n     There are of course among the Right, many who, wisely or\r\n     unwisely, rejoice that Marshal MacMahon has broken with the Left,\r\n     but there is hardly any one who does not think the moment ill\r\n     chosen, the reasons assigned insufficient, and the mode adopted\r\n     unskilful. Décazes is represented, or misrepresented, as having\r\n     been at the bottom of the whole thing.\r\n\r\n     He came up to me last night, and asked if I had not something\r\n     to say to him about the sentiments he had expressed to me with\r\n     regard to the dangers to English interests in Western Europe. He\r\n     also expressed anxiety to know how the question of the wine duties\r\n     was getting on in England. He is, I suppose, anxious to have\r\n     something to show that he is successful in cultivating intimate\r\n     relations with England.\r\n\r\n     While he seems so desirous of frightening us about Holland,\r\n     he shows no inclination to admit that we have any interests at\r\n     all in the East. In fact his plan seems to be to involve us in a\r\n     quarrel with Germany, while he keeps safely aloof: to curry favour\r\n     with Russia by taking to himself the credit of keeping our forces\r\n     out of the East; to prevent any increase of our power in the\r\n     Mediterranean, and to be well with us, but, if possible, better\r\n     still with Russia. Still, on the whole, I am glad he remains in.\r\n     I should not have been sorry to have Broglie himself as Minister\r\n     for Foreign Affairs, but we might have a much more embarrassing\r\n     Minister than Décazes, and he is easy going and conciliatory in\r\n     most matters. Only we must not be surprised if he repeats to\r\n     Russia, and Russia repeats to Germany, anything likely to impair\r\n     our relations with Germany.\r\n\r\n     The other Ministers would almost seem to have been chosen\r\n     for the express purpose of defying the majority of the Chamber.\r\n     Broglie, of whom I have a high opinion, is especially unpopular.\r\n     I suppose the notion has been to put as far as possible\r\n     representatives of all shades of the Right into the Cabinet, in\r\n     order to be able to form a coalition strong enough to obtain a vote\r\n     in the Senate for dissolution. It is not certain that such a vote\r\n     could be carried, the Conservative majority in the Senate being\r\n     only 2 or 3 on ordinary occasions.\r\n\r\nDécazes took advantage of the occasion actually to suggest a secret\r\nalliance with England for the protection of Holland and Belgium, and\r\nstated that if it were ever signed, he should communicate to no single\r\nperson except the Marshal himself. It is hardly credible that he could\r\nhave been in earnest in making this suggestion, for not only are Foreign\r\nSecretaries not in the habit of making secret treaties unknown to their\r\nchiefs and colleagues, but Lord Derby was the last person who would be\r\nlikely to enter into an enterprise of this description. In the meanwhile\r\nBismarck, as an impartial friend, was warning Lord Odo Russell that\r\nDécazes was only waiting for an opportunity to throw England over, in\r\norder to prove his devotion to Russia, and there was little doubt as to\r\nwhich alliance he would prefer if he could have his choice.\r\n\r\nExercising his right, Marshal MacMahon prorogued the Chambers, and it\r\nbeing foreseen that there would be a general election in the autumn, his\r\nGovernment set to work at once in preparing for the fight by getting\r\nrid of as many Republican functionaries as possible, in accordance with\r\nwell-established custom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Derby._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 25, 1877.\r\n\r\n     Neither the private history of the dismissal of Jules Simon,\r\n     nor the attitude of the successful party, is calculated to give one\r\n     good hope for the future.\r\n\r\n     The Marshal is supposed to have been mainly influenced by M.\r\n     de St. Paul, a Bonapartist and intimate friend of his, of whom\r\n     he sees a great deal; by Monsignor Dupanloup, Bishop of Orleans;\r\n     by the aides-de-camp and people about him, and (it is whispered)\r\n     by Madame la Maréchale. Fourtou may have been in the plot, but I\r\n     believe Broglie was taken by surprise. Décazes wanted to get rid\r\n     of Jules Simon and Martel, but to put temporarily in their places\r\n     some members of the Left, who would have got on for a time with\r\n     the Chamber. Jules Simon had proved a complete failure as Prime\r\n     Minister; he had neither the confidence of the Marshal nor even\r\n     that of the Cabinet, and he had lost all influence in the Chamber.\r\n     He would very soon have fallen of himself if he had been left alone.\r\n\r\n     The language of the Right tends to accredit the supposition\r\n     which will be most fatal to them in the country. They speak and\r\n     act as if the question was one between the aristocracy and the\r\n     canaille. In fact they wound the sentiment of equality which is\r\n     the strongest political and social sentiment in France, and\r\n     consequently the present crisis is beginning to be looked upon as\r\n     the last struggle of the old society against the new.\r\n\r\n     As regards the great question as to what is to be done when\r\n     the Marshal finds himself finally defeated by the Chamber, the\r\n     party now triumphant talk of the use of military force. The Marshal\r\n     has often declared to his friends that nothing shall induce him to\r\n     resort to an extralegal use of force, but the wilder spirits of the\r\n     party say that if the Marshal will not use the army, a general will\r\n     be found with less scruple, and they hint at Ducrot. But this would\r\n     be falling into the most fatal of all systems, that of military\r\n     _pronunciamentos_. The Marshal himself might do a great deal with\r\n     the army, and would probably keep it together, but it does not\r\n     by any means follow that any one general seizing power in Paris\r\n     would be submitted to by the rest. It is believed that even now,\r\n     General Berthaut, the Minister of War, was with difficulty induced\r\n     to remain in office, and yielded only to the Marshal's special\r\n     request, on condition that he should be relieved in the autumn.\r\n\r\n     It is however to be hoped that all this talk about military\r\n     _coups d'état_ is simply talk; and that we shall get out of this\r\n     difficulty quietly at last. In the meantime the upper ten thousand\r\n     in Paris are indulging themselves in all sorts of illusions, and\r\n     the Paris shopkeepers are dreaming of the restoration of a Court\r\n     and of a great expenditure on luxuries.\r\n\r\nThe Chambers met again in June, and although the country was perfectly\r\nquiet, the scenes which took place in the Chamber of Deputies were a\r\nsufficient indication of the fury with which the politicians regarded\r\neach other. The violent and disorderly conduct was chiefly on the side\r\nof the Right, there being a certain number of Bonapartists who provoked\r\ndisturbances with the object of discrediting Parliamentary Government as\r\nmuch as possible.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand even the moderate men on the Left began to talk\r\nof revolutionary measures to be adopted when they got back into\r\npower again, such as the suspension of the irremovability of judges,\r\nthe impeachment of Ministers, and the dissolution of religious\r\ncongregations. On June 22, the dissolution was voted by the Senate\r\nby a majority of twenty. It was decided that the elections should be\r\nheld in three months' time, and both parties made their preparations\r\nfor an uncompromising fight, Marshal MacMahon beginning the campaign\r\nwith an order of the day to the army which smacked disagreeably of a\r\n_coup d'état_, not to say a _pronunciamento_. Subsequently, having been\r\nassured of the support of the Comte de Chambord--a somewhat questionable\r\nadvantage--he proceeded on an electoral tour in the South.\r\n\r\nThe general election took place in October, and resulted in the crushing\r\ndefeat of the Marshal and his Ministers in spite of the labours of\r\nprefects, magistrates, mayors, policemen, and priests, who had all been\r\ntemporarily converted into electioneering agents. The exasperation of\r\nparties reached an almost unprecedented point, and Décazes admitted\r\nthat the country was in a state of moral civil war. The partisans of\r\nthe Government talked of a second dissolution, of proclaiming a state\r\nof siege during the new elections and conducting them with even more\r\nadministrative vigour than the last. The Republicans announced their\r\ndetermination to annul the elections of all the official candidates and\r\nto impeach the Ministers and even the Marshal himself, if he did not\r\nretire or name a Ministry having their confidence. As for the Marshal\r\nhimself, he found little support at this crisis from the monarchical\r\nparties, except on the part of the Orleanists, who saw that he must\r\nbe kept in at all hazards; but the Orleanists had recognized that\r\nFrance, for the moment at least, was Republican, and their press owned\r\nopenly that to persist in Personal Government instead of reverting to\r\nConstitutional Government was to march to certain disaster. The Marshal,\r\nin fact, found himself confronted with two alternatives: either he must\r\naccept Gambetta's demand to submit or resign; or he must run the risk of\r\ngetting rid of his difficulties by means of a _coup d'état_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Derby._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Oct. 26, 1877.\r\n\r\n     The prospect does not grow clearer, though I see, or at all\r\n     events like to fancy I see, a cooling down of the fury which\r\n     prevailed a week ago.\r\n\r\n     The Marshal is supposed to be a man of one idea, and his one\r\n     idea at the present moment is said to be that he is bound to remain\r\n     at his post.\r\n\r\n     This idea might lead him to name a Ministry from the majority,\r\n     but then he would have to dismiss all the Fourtou prefects, whom he\r\n     solemnly promised to stand by.\r\n\r\n     On the other hand, the idea might carry him on to a _coup\r\n     d'état_.\r\n\r\n     The plan devised by his opponents, and indeed by some of his\r\n     friends, for getting him out of the scrape, is that the Senate\r\n     should refuse to support him in extreme measures, and that he\r\n     should then declare (which would indeed be true) that he had never\r\n     promised to stay in opposition to both branches of the Legislature.\r\n\r\n     Communications which have been going on between the Elysée\r\n     and the Duc d'Audiffret Pasquier, the President of the Senate, are\r\n     said to have shown that the Senate cannot be depended upon either\r\n     to vote a second dissolution, or to carry on the Government in\r\n     conjunction with the Marshal, and without the Chamber of Deputies.\r\n\r\n     I register as rumours, strongly requiring confirmation, that\r\n     the Marshal has summoned the Chasseurs d'Afrique to reinforce the\r\n     garrison of Paris; that in consequence of disagreements between\r\n     Grévy and Gambetta, the Republicans offer the Presidency of the\r\n     Republic to General Chanzy, the Governor-General of Algeria; that\r\n     the more moderate Liberals have hopes of bringing in the Duc\r\n     d'Aumale as President, if MacMahon should actually retire.\r\n\r\n     As the population is disarmed and there is no National Guard,\r\n     there can be no need to increase the numbers of the garrison of\r\n     Paris. If any fresh troops were really brought up, it would be from\r\n     mistrust of the spirit of those already here.\r\n\r\n     Gambetta must have departed very far from his usual political\r\n     tact, if he has set up claims in opposition to Grévy. Grévy would\r\n     be quite alarming enough, and to establish the doctrine that the\r\n     President must be a general would bring France to the level of a\r\n     South American Republic.\r\n\r\n     It would be a curious result of an election, in which the\r\n     Orleans or Right Centre Party has met with a signal defeat, that an\r\n     Orleans Prince should be placed at the head of the State.\r\n\r\nThe proper course for the Marshal to have adopted was to have accepted\r\nthe position of a Constitutional President; to have appointed a\r\nMinistry which would have obtained a majority in the Chamber; and to\r\nhave restrained it from excesses by the exercise of his legitimate\r\nauthority, and by means of the power of the Senate. Instead of this,\r\nhowever, he first attempted to form a Ministry of the same colour as\r\nthe old one; then tried to meet the Chamber with his old Ministers, and\r\nfinally fell back upon perfectly unknown people who carried no weight\r\nat all, and who professed to represent no party. To this Ministry the\r\nChamber refused to pay any attention, and after many threats in the\r\nElysée organs to violate all laws; to collect and spend money without\r\nthe sanction of Parliament, to suppress newspapers, and to proclaim\r\na state of siege, the Marshal surrendered ignominiously in December,\r\nand accepted a Ministry in which M. Dufaure was President of the\r\nCouncil, and M. Waddington, Minister for Foreign Affairs. Thus, what\r\nshould have been a natural and proper consequence of the elections was\r\nconverted into an humiliating defeat, and there had been such a series\r\nof solemn declarations, none of them adhered to, that all confidence\r\nin the Marshal had disappeared. Of the more important members of the\r\nnew Government, M. Dufaure was a lawyer with Conservative leanings. M.\r\nWaddington, who had been educated at Rugby and Cambridge, was intimate\r\nwith Lord Lyons and the Embassy generally, but it was doubtful whether\r\nhis connection with England would prove an advantage, as he might\r\nfind it necessary to demonstrate that he was not too English. M. Léon\r\nSay, the Minister of Finance, was supposed to be a Free Trader; and\r\nM. de Freycinet, who was destined to take part in many subsequent\r\nadministrations, had been Gambetta's Under-Secretary of State for War,\r\nand was looked upon as Gambetta's representative in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nOn December 17, MacMahon gave Lord Lyons his version of the history of\r\nthe crisis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Derby._\r\n\r\n    Dec. 18, 1877.\r\n\r\n     I went to the weekly evening party at the Elysée last\r\n     Saturday. The Marshal took me aside, saying: 'I want to tell you\r\n     why I did it.' He proceeded to tell me that he had been led to\r\n     remain in office and make a Parliamentary Ministry, by a warning he\r\n     had received from abroad that if he retired, or if he established\r\n     a clerical Ministry, war would be the inevitable consequence.\r\n\r\n     So far the Marshal: what follows may be mere gossip.\r\n\r\n     On the afternoon of December 12, the Marshal had quite\r\n     determined _d'aller jusqu'au bout_; either to obtain from the\r\n     Senate a dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies, or to give in his\r\n     resignation. He was in consultation with General Rochebouet, who\r\n     was at the time Prime Minister, about drawing up a message in this\r\n     sense, when a letter was brought in, the bearer of which sent in\r\n     a message begging that the Marshal would receive him at once. The\r\n     letter was either written by the German Emperor, or at all events\r\n     it convinced the Marshal that the bearer was sent to give him a\r\n     message direct from His Imperial Majesty. The Marshal accordingly\r\n     received him alone, and he said he was a Prussian officer who had\r\n     been sent by the Emperor to entreat the Marshal to remain at the\r\n     head of the Republic, at all risks, and on any conditions; and\r\n     not to establish a Government which could be represented as being\r\n     clerical. The message is said to have represented that the Emperor\r\n     himself was most anxious for peace, but that he should not be able\r\n     to restrain 'other people,' if a clerical or a radical Government\r\n     were allowed to be established in France.\r\n\r\n     This sounds so like gossip that I should hardly have thought\r\n     it worth while to repeat it, if it had not tallied rather curiously\r\n     with the statement the Marshal himself volunteered to make to me\r\n     about his motives.\r\n\r\n     The 'other people' are supposed to be neither more nor\r\n     less than one other person--Prince Bismarck--and the message is\r\n     represented as having been sent by the Emperor William without the\r\n     knowledge of the Chancellor, or of the German Ambassador here.\r\n\r\n     Prince Bismarck's enemies, and they are of course numerous\r\n     enough here, like to argue from appearances that he has quite lost\r\n     the confidence of the Emperor, and some of them, who profess to\r\n     have peculiar means of obtaining information, say that he made\r\n     three conditions with the Emperor, as those on which alone he could\r\n     continue to serve him. 1st, that he should have _carte blanche_ in\r\n     the Government; 2nd, that the Empress should reside at Coblentz\r\n     or Baden rather than at Berlin; and 3rd, that certain people, of\r\n     whom he gave a list, should be removed from Court. As a natural\r\n     consequence, Bismarck's illness is attributed to his not having\r\n     obtained the consent of his Imperial Master to his conditions; and\r\n     it is said that he will not recover until his terms are complied\r\n     with. This story of the conditions appears to me to be a very\r\n     outrageous one, and I am quite unable to say whether there is any\r\n     admixture of truth in it. Those who recount it, love to draw from\r\n     it prognostications of the fall of the Great Chancellor.\r\n\r\nWhether the story of the Marshal's mysterious visitor was true or not,\r\nhis defeat marked a decisive epoch in French internal politics; the\r\nRepublic was now firmly established and cannot be said to have been in\r\nany dangers since, unless the vagaries of the impostor Boulanger be\r\nexcepted.\r\n\r\nEver since the beginning of the war between Russia and Turkey, Lord\r\nDerby had continually asserted that it was practically no concern\r\nof ours, and that he was quite determined not to be drawn into any\r\nintervention whatsoever. But as the Turkish resistance collapsed, and\r\nas it became more and more evident that there was nothing to prevent\r\nthe Russians from exacting any terms they chose, unless some form of\r\nintervention took place, Her Majesty's Government decided to call\r\nParliament together. Lord Derby was anxious to explain that this action\r\nhad no sinister significance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Derby to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Dec. 21, 1877.\r\n\r\n     You are not unlikely to be asked the meaning of Parliament\r\n     being called together earlier than usual. The explanation is\r\n     simple. We see a growing excitement on the question of the war; we\r\n     are menaced by an agitation friendly but troublesome, having for\r\n     object to drive us into war, and with a counter movement on the\r\n     other side. We think that much useless talk will be stopped; the\r\n     real opinion of the country be tested, and the Ministry relieved\r\n     from the annoyance of perpetual criticism which it cannot reply\r\n     to, if every peer and M.P. can say what he has got to say at\r\n     Westminster, rather than at a county dinner or borough meeting.\r\n\r\n     Those who have confidence in us will not be sorry to hear our\r\n     views explained by ourselves; those who have not, will have no\r\n     further opportunity of talking mysteriously about the country being\r\n     committed to this, that, or the other, without Parliament having a\r\n     voice in the matter. For it is clear that if we meant to act on our\r\n     own responsibility, and leave Parliament no choice except to ratify\r\n     or to condemn what we had done, we should not shorten by one-half\r\n     the interval that remains during which only such action is possible.\r\n\r\n     It is possible that there may be in France some renewal of\r\n     suspicions as to English designs on Egypt. If so, you may dispel\r\n     them by the most decided language you can use. We want nothing and\r\n     will take nothing from Egypt except what we have already, and what\r\n     other Powers share equally with us. We shall continue to work in\r\n     harmony with the French, and hope and expect the same from them.\r\n\r\nLord Derby was the most cautious and unenterprising of men, and he\r\nalready perhaps felt some suspicions as to the soundness of his\r\ncolleagues in the Cabinet; but the assurance to be given to the French\r\nGovernment with regard to Egypt seems, on the face of it, somewhat\r\ngratuitous, if not rash. The situation in Turkey might have resulted in\r\nour being forced to go to Egypt at short notice, and only five years\r\nlater he, Lord Derby, found himself a member of a Liberal Government\r\nwhich had been forced to adopt that very course.\r\n\r\nWhen the British Parliament met in January, the war was already\r\npractically ended, and the commissioners were treating for an armistice\r\nand for the preliminaries of peace. The Queen's Speech announced that\r\nalthough neither the Russians nor the Turks had infringed the conditions\r\non which the neutrality of England depended, it might be necessary\r\nto ask for money and to take precautions, and on January 23, the\r\nMediterranean fleet was ordered to pass the Dardanelles and to proceed\r\nto Constantinople. This action brought about the resignation of both\r\nLord Derby and Lord Carnarvon, but upon the countermanding of the order\r\nto the fleet, Lord Derby resumed office. On January 28, the basis of the\r\npeace negotiations having been communicated, the Government asked for\r\na vote of six millions, and in consequence of alarming intelligence,\r\nreceived from Mr. Layard the British Ambassador at Constantinople, the\r\nfleet was again ordered definitely to proceed to that city. Political\r\nexcitement reached its climax, and light-hearted Jingoes, quite\r\nincapable of realizing the inadequacy of British military resources,\r\nproclaimed their readiness to fight any possible adversary.\r\n\r\nIf it eventually became necessary for England to take active steps to\r\nsecure her interests in the East, it was quite clear that no assistance\r\nwhatever could be expected from France. M. Waddington took an early\r\nopportunity to assure Lord Lyons most emphatically that France wanted\r\nnothing for herself, and that she desired no acquisition of territory\r\neither in the Mediterranean or elsewhere; but whilst he disclaimed any\r\ndesire of this nature, he showed in a most unmistakeable manner that\r\nan occupation of Egypt by England would create a bitter feeling in\r\nFrance which would long impair the friendly relations between the two\r\ncountries. Speaking most confidentially, M. Waddington said that it was\r\nall important to France that England and Russia should not be involved\r\nin hostilities, and that France should not be left _tête-à-tête_ with\r\nPrince Bismarck, whether the latter played the part of an enemy or a\r\ntempter. In fact, the French Government, like its predecessor, was\r\ndisquieted by a notion that Bismarck intended to propose to France\r\nsome arrangement respecting Belgium and Holland, which would dismember\r\nthose States, assigning of course to Germany the lion's share of the\r\nspoils, and it seemed to be apprehended that France would be called\r\nupon to choose between acquiescing in such an arrangement or incurring\r\nthe active enmity of Germany. The fear of the French that they might\r\nbecome involved was so strong that Waddington was alarmed even at the\r\nidea of committing his Government to the British declaration as to\r\nthe invalidity of treaties concluded without the participation of the\r\nPowers; but, in spite of this timorous spirit, and although the Treaty\r\nof San Stefano was not signed until March 3, Lord Derby informed Lord\r\nLyons on February 2, that, the support of Austria having been obtained,\r\nHer Majesty's Government were determined to secure a Conference, and\r\nit was hoped that Italy and France would also exercise at least a\r\nbenevolent neutrality. The uncertainty of the position was shown in Lord\r\nDerby's language with regard to Constantinople. 'I hardly know what will\r\nhappen if the Russians insist on showing themselves at Constantinople.\r\nIt is not a case we could make a _casus belli_ of, but I think it would\r\nin that case be desirable that the Neutral Powers should be present\r\ntoo--that is their fleets--both as a demonstration, and to keep order\r\nif necessary. The war being over, such a proceeding could not be\r\nmisconstrued, as it certainly would have been before. All this, however,\r\nis uncertain.'\r\n\r\nJudging by subsequent experiences, Lord Derby would have spent a\r\nlong time in securing the presence of the International fleets at\r\nConstantinople, and would have experienced still more trouble in\r\npersuading them to take any action. The Russians fortunately stopped\r\nshort of Constantinople, and a Conference being now a practical\r\ncertainty, Lord Lyons was invited to act as the British representative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Derby to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    February 6, 1878.\r\n\r\n     The Conference will probably come off, and it may come off\r\n     soon, though there is a chance of delay from differences as to the\r\n     place of meeting.\r\n\r\n     I find the feeling of the Cabinet unanimous, and I fully share\r\n     it, that you are the fittest person to attend the Conference on\r\n     our behalf. Indeed, I know of no one in whom I should have equal\r\n     confidence for a duty of that kind. Nothing has been said to the\r\n     Queen, but I have no doubt of Her Majesty's consent.\r\n\r\n     May I ask you if, considering the importance and difficulty\r\n     of the work, you will be prepared to sacrifice your personal\r\n     convenience so far as to accept the office if offered? I fear the\r\n     sacrifice will be considerable, but let up hope that the result\r\n     will repay your trouble.\r\n\r\nTo most people, an invitation of this character, conveyed in so\r\nflattering a manner, would have had an irresistible attraction; but Lord\r\nLyons was one of those persons to whom notoriety was indifferent, if not\r\nobnoxious, and who much preferred to confine himself to doing his own\r\nbusiness in a practical and unostentatious spirit. He, however, felt it\r\nhis duty to accept, hoping vainly all the time that the Conference would\r\nnever take place at all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Derby._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Feb. 8, 1878.\r\n\r\n     I wish to offer you my best thanks for your letter of the day\r\n     before yesterday. Your proposal to appoint me to represent England\r\n     at the Conference is very flattering in itself, and nothing could\r\n     be more gratifying than the terms in which it is made.\r\n\r\n     You were so kind as to speak of the sacrifice of my personal\r\n     convenience, but that consideration I will set entirely aside.\r\n     There are feelings of much greater weight which make me shrink from\r\n     the task, and it appears to me to be a task peculiarly difficult,\r\n     and one of which the result is, to say the least, extremely\r\n     doubtful. I may say, too, without any affectation of modesty, that\r\n     I do not think myself well qualified for it.\r\n\r\n     Still these are after all personal considerations which I\r\n     ought not to allow to interfere with any public duty which I may be\r\n     called upon to discharge. If therefore the Queen and the Government\r\n     should determine upon entrusting this mission to me, I should\r\n     undertake it heartily and zealously, and do my best to justify\r\n     their confidence.\r\n\r\n     Of course nothing can be settled until we know the rank and\r\n     number of the Plenipotentiaries of other Powers, the place of\r\n     meeting, and other particulars, which may have a material influence\r\n     in the selection of the Representative or Representatives of Her\r\n     Majesty.\r\n\r\n     If however the progress of events should ultimately lead to my\r\n     being chosen, I should be very grateful if you would allow me the\r\n     opportunity of conferring with you upon various matters, before any\r\n     definite arrangements are made. There is one to which I attach so\r\n     much importance that I will mention it at once. I trust that you\r\n     will allow me to choose myself the staff to accompany me on the\r\n     occasion. My efficiency and comfort would depend mainly on this.\r\n\r\nApart from a disinclination to leave his own work, Lord Lyons probably\r\nconsidered that the outlook for England at a Conference was by no\r\nmeans reassuring. The issue of the Conference really depended upon the\r\nmilitary position in which England and Austria would apparently stand,\r\nshould the Conference itself break up _rê infectâ_, and at the end of\r\nFebruary the English position looked to be none too favourable, for\r\nit depended upon the fleet having access to the Black Sea. If we were\r\nable to stop the Russian communications by sea, the Russians would be\r\nat the mercy of Austria by land, supposing Andrassy's boasts to be\r\nwell founded; but we had no absolute security against the Russians\r\noccupying Gallipoli at any moment, and no semblance of a security of\r\ntheir not occupying the Black Sea exit of the Bosphorus, for the Turks\r\nwere at their mercy, and, as pointed out by Mr. Layard, they were quite\r\ncapable of making any arrangement with Russia, since they considered\r\nthat they had been betrayed and abandoned by England. Neither, it might\r\nbe added, was there any security that Austria would stand firm, for\r\nthere was always the chance of her being bought off with Bosnia and the\r\nHerzegovina.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Derby._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Feb. 26, 1878.\r\n\r\n     As to the Conference itself all seems more than ever in doubt.\r\n     Unless the Austrians are determined to go to war and are visibly\r\n     ready, and unless we are equally determined and equally ready on\r\n     our side, and unless the Russians are convinced of this, there can\r\n     be no chance of their making any concessions. Then, what will the\r\n     Austrians want? To bolster up the Turks, to waste energy in trying\r\n     to place under them again this or that district delivered by the\r\n     Russians, would be a very losing game. There must, I suppose,\r\n     be some new Principality or Principalities. If anything like a\r\n     national feeling and a national Government can be established in\r\n     them, their danger will be from Russia, and Russia will become\r\n     their natural enemy, unless they are thrown into her arms by a\r\n     hostility on the part of Austria, which will make them feel that\r\n     Russia alone is their defence against Turkey. Then there are the\r\n     Straits, and the difficulty of placing the Turks, or whoever is\r\n     to hold them, in a position to guard them against a Russian _coup\r\n     de main_ at least. Ignatieff seems to be already working the\r\n     connection between Egypt and the Porte, with a view to getting\r\n     money out of Egypt for Russia. I am inclined to think that the more\r\n     radically Egypt is severed from the Porte, and the less our free\r\n     action with regard to it is hampered by collective guarantees or\r\n     collective Protectorates the safer we shall be.\r\n\r\nThe correctness of these views has since been amply demonstrated by the\r\nhistory of the Balkan States. The opinion about Egypt, however, was\r\nprobably not at all to the taste of Lord Derby, who appeared to rejoice\r\nin divided responsibility.\r\n\r\nLord Lyons himself was summoned to London early in March in order to\r\nconfer with the Government respecting his procedure at Berlin, and\r\njudging from his letters to various correspondents, the course which Her\r\nMajesty's Government proposed to adopt was in a state of considerable\r\nuncertainty. It was, however, a source of much satisfaction to him that\r\nhe would have the co-operation of Lord Odo Russell, who was an intimate\r\nfriend, and in whose judgment he felt complete confidence. He also got\r\nhis way about his staff, which was to include amongst others, Malet,\r\nSheffield, and Mr. (now Sir William) Barrington.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Odo Russell._\r\n\r\n    London, March 13, 1878.\r\n\r\n     My only comfort about this awful Congress or Conference is\r\n     that you will be my partner in it. I hope, if it does come off\r\n     after all, that we may get over it without doing harm to our\r\n     country or to ourselves. I wanted them to set me aside and take\r\n     advantage of the transfer to Berlin to put it into your hands;\r\n     and I still think this would be the best plan; but they say that\r\n     after their announcement of my appointment to Parliament, they\r\n     cannot cancel it. Sir Robert Peel has moved a resolution that I am\r\n     not a fit person to represent England at the Conference. I shall\r\n     console myself if he carries it. He grounds his motion upon 'my\r\n     well-known opinions.' I suppose he takes my opinions from a wholly\r\n     unauthorized and incorrect account of them which appeared in a\r\n     letter in the _Daily Telegraph_ yesterday. Some people suppose he\r\n     wrote the letter himself in order to have a peg to hang his motion\r\n     on. I don't think your difficulties at the Conference will arise\r\n     from strong preconceived opinions of mine. I shall try and get our\r\n     instructions made as precise as possible. Could you give me some\r\n     hints as to the particular points which should be decided before we\r\n     begin? You will know how far certain solutions in our sense will be\r\n     feasible or not. It is worse than useless that we should be told to\r\n     aim at impossibilities, and have to yield: though there may be of\r\n     course conditions, which if not admitted, will render it necessary\r\n     for us to retire from the Conference altogether.\r\n\r\n     I am sure you will be the greatest help and comfort to me, and\r\n     I hope I may be a help to you. Please tell me anything you wish me\r\n     to do or say here.\r\n\r\nLord Odo Russell appears to have been equally in the dark as to the\r\nintended policy of Her Majesty's Government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Odo Russell to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Berlin, March 16, 1878.\r\n\r\n     The feelings you express concerning the Conference are so\r\n     entirely my own that I need say no more, and only hope that Lord\r\n     Derby will give you a better qualified assistant than I can be with\r\n     regard to Oriental Affairs, of which I do not really know enough to\r\n     be of any use to you or to the country, beside such authorities as\r\n     Ignatieff, Lobanoff, Calice, Radowitz, Busch, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n     You ask if I could give you some hints as to the particular\r\n     points which should be decided before you begin.\r\n\r\n     I would do so with the greatest pleasure, if I only knew what\r\n     the policy of Her Majesty's Government is likely to be in Congress.\r\n     All I know about it at present is contained in Lord Derby's\r\n     despatch of May 6, and as far as Constantinople and the Straits are\r\n     concerned, I fancy Russia will be conciliatory.\r\n\r\n     You ask further how far certain solutions in our sense will be\r\n     feasible or not.\r\n\r\n     I wish I could answer your question, but can only beg of\r\n     you to tell me first whether we accept the consequences of our\r\n     neutrality, or whether we contest them: whether we are going\r\n     to reject the Turko-Russian Treaty, as we rejected the Berlin\r\n     Memorandum, or whether we are going to accept now what we refused\r\n     then.\r\n\r\n     Russia is now in possession of Turkey. Germany supports Russia.\r\n\r\n     France and Italy have no wish to quarrel with Russia or\r\n     Germany, and will not offer any serious opposition to the\r\n     Turko-Russian Treaty.\r\n\r\n     Austria may object to two things: the proposed limits of\r\n     Bulgaria, and the prolonged occupation of Russian troops.\r\n\r\n     If Russia is well disposed, she will consent to a smaller\r\n     Bulgaria and to a shorter occupation.\r\n\r\n     If she doesn't, Austria must choose between a diplomatic\r\n     defeat, a compromise, or war to turn Russia out of Bulgaria.\r\n     Bismarck will exert all his personal influence in favour of a\r\n     compromise to keep the three Emperors' Alliance together before\r\n     Europe in Conference assembled.\r\n\r\n     The annexation of Armenia and the war indemnity are questions\r\n     which Russia will scarcely consent to submit to the Congress at all.\r\n\r\n     What then is our attitude to be? Please let me know as soon as\r\n     you can, and I will do my best to answer your questions.\r\n\r\n     If we go in for Greek interests we shall have the cordial\r\n     support of Germany and Austria, I think--but Greek interests are\r\n     in direct opposition to Turkish interests, if I am not greatly\r\n     mistaken.\r\n\r\n     On hearing of your appointment I wrote to you to congratulate\r\n     myself and to beg of you to grant us the happiness of taking up\r\n     your quarters at the Embassy, and also to advise you to bring a\r\n     numerous and efficient staff, as I have not hands enough at Berlin\r\n     for an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe letters of Lord Odo Russell at this period show that he was\r\ncompletely in the dark as to the intentions of Her Majesty's Government,\r\nand that he was quite unable to get any answer as to what was to be\r\ntheir policy with regard to the Treaty of San Stefano. He himself was\r\nconvinced that the three Empires had already settled what the result of\r\nthe Congress was to be, and that they simply intended to communicate it\r\nto Greece, Roumania, and other Powers for whom they wished to manifest\r\ntheir contempt, such as France and England, _à prendre ou à laisser_.\r\nUnder these circumstances, it became doubtful whether it was worth\r\nwhile for England to go into a Conference at all and court unnecessary\r\nhumiliation, serious as the responsibility would be if such a course\r\nwere decided upon.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that much of the prevailing uncertainty was due to\r\nLord Derby, who with great difficulty had contrived to keep pace with\r\nhis more enterprising colleagues, and whose over-cautious temperament\r\nhad prevented the adoption of any really definite policy. But Lord\r\nDerby, unable to stand the shock of seeing a few thousand Indian troops\r\nsent to the Mediterranean, resigned office on March 28, and the advent\r\nof Lord Salisbury at the Foreign Office marked a new departure in\r\nBritish Foreign Policy.\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury's circular of April 1, 1878, was intended to show that\r\nthe Treaty of San Stefano threatened the interests of Europe, and\r\nthat the whole, and not parts of it, as proposed by Russia, should be\r\nsubmitted to the Congress. It pointed out that the creation of a big\r\nBulgaria, stretching over the greater part of the Balkan Peninsula,\r\nand with ports on the Black Sea and the Ægean, would give Russia a\r\npredominant influence; that the proposed annexations in Asia Minor would\r\ngive Russia control over political and commercial conditions in that\r\nregion, and that the exaction of an indemnity which it was impossible\r\nfor Turkey to provide, would enable Russia either to exact further\r\ncessions of territory or to impose any other conditions which might be\r\nthought advisable. The logic was sound, and at all events Lord Salisbury\r\nsucceeded in producing a definite British policy, which his predecessor\r\nhad signally failed to do.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Lyons returned to Paris at the beginning of April the question\r\nof whether there was to be a Congress or not was still in suspense.\r\nFrench opinion was rather more in favour of England on the Eastern\r\nQuestion than had been expected, but there was no sign of anything more\r\nthan passive sympathy, and Waddington, who was particularly sensitive\r\non the subject, intimated, not obscurely, that the good will of France\r\ndepended upon England not acting independently of her in Egypt. It\r\nlooked, in fact, as if England would be left to bell the cat, although\r\nLord Salisbury's circular, as was generally admitted, had immensely\r\nraised British prestige on the continent. The suspicion felt in France\r\nas to Russian intentions was shown by the failure of agents of the\r\nRussian Government to negotiate a loan at Paris for thirty millions\r\nsterling, and Lord Salisbury's letters in the early part of April show\r\nthat, while there were symptoms of yielding in Europe, there appeared to\r\nbe no prospect of those concessions with regard to Asia Minor to which\r\nHer Majesty's Government attached great importance.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the French Government was apparently anxious to act as\r\nfar as possible with England, without committing itself too much, since\r\nthe idea of a Russian naval station in the Mediterranean was highly\r\nobnoxious; but Waddington was hampered, amongst other causes, by the\r\nproceedings of Gambetta, who was disporting himself in some of the\r\nEuropean capitals with the object of forming, or appearing to form,\r\nrelations with foreign statesmen, which would enable him to put forward\r\na claim to become eventually Minister for Foreign Affairs. Waddington\r\nalways in private repudiated responsibility for what Gambetta said\r\nor did, but the latter was now so important a personage that it was\r\nnecessary to keep on good terms with him and to submit to a patronage\r\nwhich must have been irksome to French Ministers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, April 24, 1878.\r\n\r\n     The negotiations for the simultaneous withdrawal of the fleet\r\n     and army from Constantinople proceed very slowly. We are making\r\n     no difficulties, but the Russians cannot make up their minds about\r\n     details, and are probably trying to screw some concessions out of\r\n     the luckless Turks. I shall be very glad to see the arrangement\r\n     succeed, because our fleet is doing no possible good there at this\r\n     moment. Whatever value it had, disappeared as soon as the peace was\r\n     signed. But as the Russians seem to be afraid of it, we must make\r\n     the most of it. Possibly, in their secret hearts, they entertain\r\n     very much the same opinion as to the position of their armies.\r\n\r\n     The general negotiations do not improve. Russia gives me the\r\n     impression of a Government desperately anxious for peace, and\r\n     driven on by some fate towards war. Andrassy undoubtedly means to\r\n     have Bosnia; but whether he will be satisfied with that I am not\r\n     so certain. It is a possible policy for him to throw the Danube\r\n     over altogether; to secure an outlet for his produce by a railway\r\n     to Salonika, and to accept a simultaneous extension southward in\r\n     parallel lines of Austrian and Russian possession--whether in the\r\n     form of actual territory, or of vassal states. In that case, he\r\n     will throw us over, and his course will be easy enough if he can\r\n     square the Hungarians. But that may be a difficulty. Do you gather\r\n     any information about his objects?\r\n\r\n     Is it your impression--as it is mine--that the French are\r\n     supremely anxious to push us into war?\r\n\r\nLord Lyons's reply to these inquiries gives the reasons why the French\r\nviews with regard to an Anglo-Russian conflict had undergone an\r\nalteration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Paris, April 26, 1878.\r\n\r\n     I owe you many thanks for your letter of the day before\r\n     yesterday.\r\n\r\n     You ask me whether it is my impression that the French are\r\n     extremely anxious to push us into war.\r\n\r\n     Confidence in their returning military strength, and the\r\n     apparent success of their endeavours to conciliate Germany have\r\n     calmed their fears of Bismarck. They are no longer nervously\r\n     desirous that the forces of England should be kept in the west,\r\n     as a necessary check upon the great Chancellor's supposed designs\r\n     upon Holland, upon Belgium, or upon France herself. On the other\r\n     hand, they have given up counting upon Russia as an ally against\r\n     Germany, and have abandoned Décazes's policy of courting her and\r\n     espousing her interests. The result of all this is that they are\r\n     willing enough that the main force of England should be employed at\r\n     a distance from home.\r\n\r\n     They have been reassured about Egypt, and they think that if\r\n     England is engaged in hostilities with Russia, she will be less\r\n     disposed and less able to interfere with France or to separate from\r\n     her in Egyptian affairs. They have lost their great fear, which was\r\n     that England, instead of opposing Russia, would seek a compensation\r\n     for herself in the annexation of Egypt. Thus another of the reasons\r\n     which made them desire that England should abstain from all action\r\n     has disappeared.\r\n\r\n     There are, moreover, the patriots, who look far ahead, who do\r\n     positively desire that England should go to war with Russia. Their\r\n     calculation is that Austria and Italy would sooner or later be\r\n     drawn into the war on the English side, and that then, Germany and\r\n     Russia being isolated, France might join the rest of Europe against\r\n     them, and recover Alsace and Lorraine. These are said to be the\r\n     views of Gambetta and his friends.\r\n\r\n     There is, however, one feeling which pervades the great\r\n     mass of Frenchmen. They wish England to take the chestnuts out\r\n     of the fire for them. They are quite determined not to go to war\r\n     themselves for anything less than Alsace and Lorraine, but they do\r\n     wish to exclude Russia from the Mediterranean, and they are very\r\n     willing that the danger and the burthen of effecting this should be\r\n     incurred by England.\r\n\r\n     With these views their newspapers go on patting us on the\r\n     back, and may continue to do so, as long as we seem to be ready to\r\n     act alone; but they would change their note, if they saw any risk\r\n     of France being drawn into the war with us, until _after_ Austria\r\n     and Italy had joined us.\r\n\r\n     I know of nothing to confirm Odo Russell's information that\r\n     in return for the consent of Germany and Russia to exclude Egypt,\r\n     etc., from the deliberations of the Congress, Waddington engaged to\r\n     support Germany and Russia in everything else. What appeared on the\r\n     surface was that this exclusion was made openly by France a _sine\r\n     qua non_ of her attending the Congress, that she communicated the\r\n     condition simultaneously to all the Powers, and did not at all ask\r\n     for the assent to it as a concession. If there is only Bismarckian\r\n     authority for the bargain stated to have been made by Waddington\r\n     with Germany and Russia, I think it _mérite confirmation_. The one\r\n     object of Bismarck seems always to be to sow dissensions between\r\n     France and any other Power that she may seem to be approaching.\r\n\r\n     Notwithstanding the Comte de St. Vallier's assertion to Odo\r\n     Russell, Mr. Adams is quite certain that it was M. de St. Vallier\r\n     himself who reported to Mr. Waddington that Odo had communicated\r\n     to the Emperor William, Prince Bismarck, etc., a telegram from Mr.\r\n     Adams on the subject of the sympathies of France with England.\r\n     In fact Mr. Waddington who is an old schoolfellow and friend of\r\n     Mr. Adams, read to him parts of the private letter from M. de St.\r\n     Vallier in which the report was contained, and indeed one of the\r\n     phrases he cited from the letter was _le telegramme Adams_ as the\r\n     source of the communication made by Odo Russell.\r\n\r\n     The Prince of Wales arrived this morning and I have been all\r\n     the afternoon at the Exhibition with him, which obliges me to write\r\n     in such haste, that I cannot be brief.\r\n\r\n     I have just seen Hobart Pasha, who goes on to England\r\n     to-morrow morning and will try to see you.\r\n\r\n     I doubt whether Waddington or the Austrian Ambassador here get\r\n     any information about Andrassy's real views and objects.\r\n\r\n     The Russians seem to be hard at work trying to make the\r\n     execution of the Treaty of San Stefano a _fait accompli_. _Beati\r\n     possidentes._\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury's suspicions as to the pressure being put upon the\r\nunfortunate Turks by the Russians were confirmed by an interesting\r\nletter from Mr. Layard to Lord Lyons, in which the much-denounced Abdul\r\nHamid appears in quite a new light.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Constantinople, May 1, 1878.\r\n\r\n     I am not surprised that Waddington should care nothing about\r\n     Armenia. The question is a purely English one, but to us a vital\r\n     one. The Treaty of San Stefano puts the whole of Asia Minor\r\n     virtually at the mercy of Russia and insures her influence over\r\n     Mesopotamia and perhaps ultimately over Syria, which would probably\r\n     not be pleasant to the French. This immense addition to the power\r\n     of Russia in Asia, and the command that she obtains, if the Treaty\r\n     be carried out, of routes to India and Central Asia, is a matter\r\n     of serious import to England. But probably there is no European\r\n     Power which does not envy us the possession of India, and would\r\n     not secretly rejoice at the prospect of our losing it. I believe\r\n     this feeling to be particularly strong with Frenchmen. But if we\r\n     intend to preserve our Empire as it now is, we must be prepared to\r\n     deal with this question of Russian aggrandisement in Asia Minor and\r\n     drive them back. Our only way of doing so, is by making use of the\r\n     Mussulman population. The idea of an autonomous Christian Armenia\r\n     to form a barrier to Russian advance is one of those absurdities\r\n     which are cropping up daily amongst our sentimental politicians,\r\n     who know nothing of the matters upon which they pretend to lay down\r\n     the law.\r\n\r\n     The Grand Duke Nicholas, before going, made an ultimate\r\n     attempt to bully the Sultan into surrendering Shumla, Varna and\r\n     Batoum; but His Majesty held firm and His Imperial Highness failed\r\n     to get a promise out of him on the subject. It is curious that\r\n     whilst our ignorant and unscrupulous newspaper correspondents are\r\n     systematically writing down the Sultan and denouncing him as a poor\r\n     weak creature incapable of having an opinion of his own, he has\r\n     shown far more firmness than any of his Ministers. Had it not been\r\n     for him, it is highly probable that the ironclads would have been\r\n     given over to the Russians, and more than probable that the Grand\r\n     Duke would have been allowed to occupy Buyuk Dere and the entrance\r\n     to the Bosphorus. The Russians threaten to seize Varna, Shumla\r\n     and Batoum by force, but I much doubt whether they will venture\r\n     to do so, as right is not on their side. Shumla and Varna are not\r\n     to be given up to Russia, but to the Bulgarian Principality when\r\n     constituted: and the arrangements for the final settlement of the\r\n     Russian frontier in Asia are to be made within six months of the\r\n     conclusion of the 'definitive' not the 'preliminary' Treaty.\r\n\r\n     I am anxiously waiting to hear whether the simultaneous\r\n     withdrawal of our fleet and the Russian forces can be arranged. It\r\n     is of the utmost importance to the Turks to get the Russians away\r\n     from San Stefano, but I cannot understand how the Russians could\r\n     consent to give up so advantageous a position, unless they found\r\n     that if they remained there they would be exposed to considerable\r\n     danger from a joint attack by the English fleet and the Turkish\r\n     forces.\r\n\r\nLayard, who was a fighting diplomatist, and possessed the rare quality\r\nof knowing what he wanted, had long chafed at the irresolute action\r\nof the British Government, and was all in favour of making a resolute\r\nstand against Russian aggression. Throughout the war, he had continually\r\ncomplained of the apathy and indecision of the British Cabinet, and\r\nattributed these deficiencies to divided counsels and to the advanced\r\nage of Lord Beaconsfield. Now, with Lord Salisbury installed at the\r\nForeign Office, he plucked up hope again.\r\n\r\n     'Salisbury,' he wrote to Lord Lyons, 'seems to know what he\r\n     wants--which is a great contrast to his predecessor. If he is firm,\r\n     we shall, I think, triumph in the end, and remove a great danger\r\n     from Europe and ourselves. Were it not for that double-dealing,\r\n     untrustworthy fellow Andrassy, we might perhaps accomplish all\r\n     that we require without war. Andrassy's proceedings give rise to a\r\n     strong suspicion that the secret understanding between the three\r\n     Emperors still exists. The Sultan is persuaded of it, and I have\r\n     found that his instinct in such matters is usually right.'\r\n\r\nOn May 11, Lord Salisbury wrote to Lord Lyons saying that Count Münster\r\n(German Ambassador in London) had assured him that the object upon\r\nwhich the French were bent in the Mediterranean was Tunis. 'Do you\r\nhear anything of the sort?' he asked Lord Lyons, and added the highly\r\nimportant statement: 'It is of course an extension of French territory\r\nand influence of which we should not have the slightest jealousy or\r\nfear. But I am not assuming in any way that the Porte would wish to give\r\nit up. I should only like to have your opinion how far France would wish\r\nto have it.'\r\n\r\nTo this Lord Lyons replied:--\r\n\r\n     Ever since I can remember, the Italians have suspected the\r\n     French, and the French have suspected the Italians of designs upon\r\n     Tunis. Bismarck's mention of it at this moment is probably only\r\n     one of his usual devices to sow distrust of France. I have never\r\n     found that the acquisition of Tunis recommended itself to French\r\n     imagination, and I don't believe it would be taken as anything like\r\n     a set-off against English acquisitions in Egypt or Syria. I believe\r\n     our principal interest in Tunis arises from its being a source\r\n     of supply of provisions to Malta. When Décazes wished to set us\r\n     against the supposed Italian designs upon it, he used to talk of\r\n     its being dangerous to us to have Malta in a vice between Sicily\r\n     and an Italian Tunis, but it never seemed to me that the peril was\r\n     very clear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     England is very popular here at this moment, and the Prince of\r\n     Wales's visit has been a principal cause of this, but the French\r\n     have no intention to fight with us or for us. They back us up in\r\n     asserting the sanctity of Treaties, and they certainly desire that\r\n     the _status quo_ may be maintained in the Mediterranean, until\r\n     France is a little stronger.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that only a few years earlier the German\r\nGovernment had informed the French Government through Count Arnim that\r\nit would not tolerate the establishment of anything in the nature of\r\na French Protectorate in Tunis; so that if the French were now really\r\nentertaining any designs of that nature, it was pretty obvious that it\r\ncould only be the result of a hint from Berlin. The question of Tunis,\r\nhowever, was shortly overshadowed by greater issues. On May 16, Lord\r\nSalisbury transmitted to Paris a long document which formed the basis\r\nof the so-called Anglo-Turkish Convention. The proposals embodied\r\nsubsequently in the convention were contained in a private letter to\r\nMr. Layard, dated May 10, and the latter was directed not to proceed\r\nwith the negotiations until further instructions were received, as the\r\nnecessity for the convention depended upon the nature of the reply which\r\nCount Schouvaloff was to bring back from St. Petersburg. Whatever may\r\nhave been said at the time in denunciation of the occupation of Cyprus\r\nand the Asia Minor Protectorate, it can hardly be denied that Lord\r\nSalisbury had a good case logically, as is shown by the following letter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    May 22, 1878.\r\n\r\n     Until I see Schouvaloff to-morrow I shall know little of the\r\n     probabilities of our acting on that private letter to Layard of\r\n     last week, of which I sent you a copy. If, however, we do so, it\r\n     seems to me that we have a very good logical case--Is logic any use\r\n     in diplomacy?--against any objections the French may raise.\r\n\r\n     By the Tripartite Treaty of April 25, 1856, we had a right to\r\n     call on them to help us in restraining Russia from appropriating\r\n     Turkish territory. They have loudly and constantly asserted that\r\n     no military action is to be expected on their part. In Europe we\r\n     can meet the consequences of that desertion by the help of Austria,\r\n     Greece, the Rhodope mountaineers and others. But in Asia we are\r\n     abandoned wholly to ourselves. The French have left us to face and\r\n     guard against the consequences of that Russian encroachment which\r\n     they undertook to join with us in resisting. Does it lie in their\r\n     mouth, if we say that such encroachments, if persisted in, require\r\n     special precautions? that we cannot turn the Russians out by\r\n     ourselves, and that abandoned by our ally, who should have made the\r\n     task easy to us, we have no choice except to mount guard over the\r\n     endangered territory and take up the positions requisite for doing\r\n     so with effect? I do not see what answer the French would have.\r\n\r\n     But you will probably reply that my reasoning is idle trouble,\r\n     because logic is of _no_ use in diplomacy.\r\n\r\nThe French would have had no real cause for complaint if they had\r\ndiscovered the contents of the proposed Anglo-Turkish Convention, for\r\nas Lord Salisbury had already pointed out, he had been careful 'to turn\r\nthe eyes of desire away from Syria,' the only portion of Asia Minor in\r\nwhich France was interested; but Waddington had been making declarations\r\nagainst any of the Powers helping themselves to Turkish territory, and\r\nalthough these declarations were meant only to apply to Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, he would probably have used much the same language if he\r\nhad learnt that England was thinking of occupying any portion of the\r\nTurkish Empire. Logic may not be of much use in diplomacy, but it is\r\nof still less use in influencing public opinion, and an appeal to the\r\nTripartite Treaty, after it had been set aside so long, would have come\r\nrather late in the day. As, however, the necessity for providing for\r\nBritish interests and British safety in Asia was indisputable, Lord\r\nSalisbury was justified in contending that those Powers who disliked the\r\nonly methods which were within our reach, should give us such help as\r\nwould enable us to dispense with them.\r\n\r\nUpon the return of Schouvaloff from St. Petersburg, it turned out,\r\nas Lord Salisbury had anticipated, that Russia was prepared to make\r\nconcessions in Europe, but scarcely any in Asia. Layard was, therefore,\r\ndirected to negotiate the Anglo-Turkish Convention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, May 29, 1878.\r\n\r\n     I send you two memoranda, or rather two separate versions\r\n     of the same paper, which will explain fully the nature of the\r\n     propositions which Schouvaloff brought back to me, and the extent\r\n     to which we have been able to accept his proposals. The upshot of\r\n     the matter has been that the Czar yields substantially all we want\r\n     in Bulgaria and as to the Greek provinces, but sticks to his text\r\n     as to Montenegro, Bessarabia, and the Armenian conquests, except\r\n     Bayazid.\r\n\r\n     I have informed Schouvaloff that against these Asiatic\r\n     acquisitions it will be necessary for us to take precautions; and\r\n     while taking from him a formal engagement that Russia will not\r\n     extend her position in Turkey in Asia, we shall ourselves give to\r\n     Turkey a guarantee to the same effect. We shall accept these terms\r\n     as soon as he receives from St. Petersburg authority to take them\r\n     in the redaction on which we have ultimately agreed. At the same\r\n     time we have taken our measures to secure ourselves against the\r\n     consequences of the Asiatic advance. Layard received on Saturday\r\n     telegraphic directions in the sense of the private letter which I\r\n     addressed to him a fortnight ago, and of which I sent you a copy,\r\n     and with great vigour and skill he procured the signature of an\r\n     agreement on Sunday last. We do not intend that this fact shall be\r\n     made public until the Congress, as the agreement is made wholly\r\n     conditional on the retention of Batoum and Kars. But whether we\r\n     shall succeed in these good intentions remains to be seen. Our past\r\n     performances in that line do not justify any very sanguine hope.\r\n\r\n     As there seems no chance of the Porte ceding Bosnia, and as\r\n     it is necessary to keep Austria with us in the Congress, we have\r\n     offered to support her in any proposal she makes in Congress on the\r\n     subject of Bosnia, if she will support us in questions concerning\r\n     the limits of occupation and organization of Bulgaria. It is not\r\n     necessary to tell Waddington this, but, as we have advanced a step\r\n     since he last asked us the question, it is important to avoid\r\n     language inconsistent with it.\r\n\r\nOne cannot help suspecting Lord Salisbury's sense of humour as being\r\nresponsible for the stipulation, that, if the Russians abandoned to the\r\nTurks their conquests from them in Asia Minor, the occupation of Cyprus\r\nshould come to an end and the Anglo-Turkish Convention become null\r\nand void. On the following day (May 30), the so-called Anglo-Russian\r\nagreement was signed, and the enterprising Mr. Marvin, who had been\r\ntemporarily employed at the Foreign Office on the cheap, handed it over\r\nto the _Globe_ newspaper, thus creating a political sensation of the\r\nfirst order.\r\n\r\nThe agreement with Russia being now completed, and an invitation to the\r\nCongress in suitable terms having been accepted, Lord Beaconsfield and\r\nLord Salisbury decided to go to Berlin themselves, instead of sending\r\nLord Lyons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    June 5, 1878.\r\n\r\n     I feel that I owe you many apologies for my rudeness in not\r\n     writing to you on Saturday night to announce to you the decision\r\n     of the Cabinet--and to thank you for the very kind and cordial\r\n     way you had placed yourself at our disposition in the spring to\r\n     perform what was a very ugly duty. The Cabinet was rushed to the\r\n     decision which it took, partly by the consideration to which you\r\n     advert, that the threads of the last two months' negociations were\r\n     more completely in our hands than by any process of communication\r\n     they could be in yours--but also by the fact that we have dangerous\r\n     questions looming at Paris--and we cannot afford to have you absent\r\n     from your post.\r\n\r\n     My excuse for my negligence is the prosaic one that I had\r\n     not a moment of time. The agonies of a man who has to finish a\r\n     difficult negociation, and at the same time to entertain four\r\n     royalties in a country house can be better imagined than described.\r\n\r\n     The Convention at Constantinople has been signed with\r\n     expression of lively gratitude on the Sultan's part. I am sorry\r\n     that your impressions of the mood in which the French are likely\r\n     to receive the news when published, are still so gloomy. However,\r\n     we must hope for the best. We have assembled a powerful fleet at\r\n     Portsmouth and we shall have six or seven first-rate ironclads to\r\n     do what may be necessary in the Mediterranean, besides smaller\r\n     ships. And our relations with Bismarck are particularly good. So I\r\n     hope our friends at Paris will confine themselves to epigram.\r\n\r\n     If we can, we shall keep the matter secret till we get at\r\n     Congress to the part of the Treaty of San Stefano (Art. XIX) which\r\n     concerns the Asiatic annexations. I do not know whether d'Harcourt\r\n     has any inkling, but ever since his return from Paris his manner\r\n     has changed.\r\n\r\nLord Lyons hailed the decision of Lords Beaconsfield and Salisbury as a\r\n'deliverance from a nightmare which had weighed upon him since March,'\r\nand found a sympathizer in Lord Odo Russell, who had never expected\r\nmuch good from the Congress if the Three Emperors' League was revived,\r\nand who doubted whether the British public would be contented with an\r\namended San Stefano Treaty. The probable action of Waddington, who\r\nwas to be the French representative at Berlin, is foreshadowed in the\r\nfollowing letter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, June 4, 1878.\r\n\r\n     I am very glad that you and Lord Beaconsfield have determined\r\n     to go yourselves to the Congress. The matters to be treated are too\r\n     grave to be left to subordinates, and they could hardly be treated\r\n     properly by any one who had not had a minute acquaintance day by\r\n     day with the recent communications with Russia and Austria.\r\n\r\n     Waddington will, I think, be a satisfactory colleague in some\r\n     respects, but in others I am afraid you will have difficulties with\r\n     him. His English blood and his English education tell both ways.\r\n     On the one hand, he is more straightforward than most Frenchmen;\r\n     he understands and shares many English feelings, and he sees the\r\n     force of English arguments, or perhaps I should rather say, of\r\n     arguments put forward in an English way. But, on the other hand, he\r\n     feels strongly the necessity of guarding against the tendency in\r\n     France to suspect him of an English bias. He will be disposed to\r\n     join in resistance to exaggerated Russian pretensions with regard\r\n     to Roumelia and the Danube. His personal sentiments are strongly\r\n     in favour of Greece. He has a certain sympathy with Christian as\r\n     against Mussulman, but he does not carry this to an immoderate or\r\n     unpractical extent. There is, however, one point on which you may\r\n     find him very stiff. He is most strongly opposed to any change in\r\n     the relative position of the Great Powers in the Mediterranean,\r\n     and he would, I am afraid, be quite as unwilling to see England\r\n     extend her influence in that sea, as he would be to see Russia do\r\n     so. It is in order to prevent any alteration in the _statu quo_ in\r\n     the Mediterranean, more than from any other reason, that he has\r\n     made the participation of France in the Congress conditional on\r\n     the exclusion of all questions not directly arising out of the war\r\n     between Russia and Turkey, and has positively mentioned Syria and\r\n     Egypt as countries to be excluded from the discussion. He would\r\n     not perhaps be disinclined to let these questions come up, if he\r\n     thought he should obtain the support of other Powers in resisting\r\n     any change made outside of the Congress.\r\n\r\n     At any rate, public feeling in France would probably be too\r\n     strong to allow him to acquiesce in any redistribution of territory\r\n     or influence in favour of England. But I expressed my opinion on\r\n     this point so fully to you and Lord Beaconsfield in the interview I\r\n     had with you just before I left England, that I have nothing more\r\n     to say about it. The horrible event[19] which took place at Berlin\r\n     the day before yesterday has, however, thrown so strong a light\r\n     upon one phase of French opinion, that I feel bound to direct your\r\n     attention to it. It seems very shocking that while the Emperor\r\n     William is suffering from the wounds so wickedly inflicted, people\r\n     here should be speculating upon the consequences of their being\r\n     fatal, but so it is. The French believe that the maintenance of\r\n     the present military system in Germany depends upon the Emperor\r\n     William, and that even if His Majesty's successor had the same\r\n     determination as His Majesty himself to keep it up, public opinion\r\n     in the country would make it impossible for him to do so. What\r\n     foundation there may be for this supposition, I do not pretend to\r\n     determine; but that it influences the French is certain. Anything\r\n     which makes them believe the life of the Emperor to be precarious,\r\n     diminishes the restraint which the fear of Germany imposes upon\r\n     them, and renders them more stiff in asserting their own views and\r\n     pretensions, and less averse from contemplating the possibility of\r\n     supporting them by more than words.\r\n\r\n     There are, in my opinion, strong arguments to be brought in\r\n     favour of our taking measures to be in a position to resist Russia\r\n     by our own means, if other Powers will give us no help in doing\r\n     so; but as you said in a former letter, logic is perhaps not of\r\n     much use in diplomacy, and seems to me to be of still less use\r\n     in influencing public opinion. I doubt our logic doing much to\r\n     reconcile the French to our exercising a separate protection over\r\n     Turkey in Asia, or occupying a Turkish island in the Mediterranean.\r\n     I am afraid you will think I have become more nervous than\r\n     ever, and more prone to the common error among diplomatists of\r\n     exaggerating the importance of the country in which they are\r\n     themselves stationed, but anyhow I have not seen any reason to\r\n     change my views as to the feelings prevalent in France.\r\n\r\n     The Parliamentary session at Versailles is about to close.\r\n     Thanks to the Exhibition, it has been a very tranquil one, but we\r\n     must be on the look-out for squalls when the Chamber meets again\r\n     in the autumn. Gambetta has hitherto restrained his followers from\r\n     opposing the Ministry, and from proposing radical measures, but it\r\n     is doubtful whether he will be able, even if willing, to restrain\r\n     them after the end of the Exhibition. Some unexpected incident\r\n     might even produce a crisis before. At any rate the elections of\r\n     a portion of the Senate, which will take place early next year,\r\n     may remove the check which the Conservative majority in that House\r\n     has hitherto put upon the Chamber of Deputies. The Marshal does\r\n     not talk of making any more attempts at resisting the will of the\r\n     majority, but I understand that he does not talk very seriously of\r\n     retiring as soon as the election is over.\r\n\r\n     It may perhaps be worth while to mention that Waddington finds\r\n     the influence of Gambetta over the Government very irksome, and is\r\n     not fond of having it alluded to.\r\n\r\nThe Congress met at Berlin in the middle of June, and the awkward\r\nquestion of whether Waddington should be informed of the Anglo-Turkish\r\nConvention or not was debated. Lord Lyons knew perfectly well that the\r\nFrench would be furious when they heard of it, and that the greater the\r\nsurprise, the greater would be their indignation. The lines laid down\r\nfor Waddington's guidance at the Congress were that France desired:\r\n\r\n1. Peace.\r\n\r\n2. Neutrality.\r\n\r\n3. The necessity of the consent of all the Powers to any modifications\r\nof the Treaties.\r\n\r\n4. The exclusion of Egypt, Syria, the Holy Places, and other topics\r\nforeign to the Russo-Turkish War.\r\n\r\nThese points were certainly not favourable to England receiving any\r\nsupport from France in defending her menaced interests in Asia Minor,\r\nas the absolute neutrality of France was the point most insisted upon.\r\nIn fact France was so obviously anxious to stand aloof, that one\r\nsuggestion was made that she should be asked to co-operate with us in\r\nAsia Minor on the assumption that such co-operation was sure to be\r\nrefused. This, however, was considered to be too hazardous a course,\r\nand it was eventually decided to say nothing to Waddington for the time\r\nbeing, lest he should make the Anglo-Turkish Convention an excuse for\r\nnot attending the Congress at all. The secret, unlike the Anglo-Russian\r\nagreement, seems to have been well kept, and cannot have been known to\r\nthe Russians, or they would have utilized it for the purpose of sowing\r\ndiscord between the British and French representatives. Finally, on July\r\n6, Lord Salisbury told the whole story to Waddington in a private letter.\r\n\r\nIn this letter Lord Salisbury pointed out that, as far as the Russian\r\nannexations in Asia Minor were concerned, we were in a completely\r\nisolated condition, since Austria was only willing to take part in\r\nrestoring the Porte to a certain independence in Europe, while France\r\nhad clearly intimated that she had no intention of engaging in war for\r\nthe purpose of maintaining the stipulations of the Treaty of 1856. The\r\nresult was that England was compelled to act alone, as her interests\r\nwere too great to allow the _status quo_ in Asia Minor to be completely\r\ndestroyed, and consequently the onerous obligation of a defensive\r\nalliance with Turkey had been undertaken in order to provide against\r\nfuture Russian annexations beyond the frontier assigned under the\r\npresent negotiations at Berlin. As this engagement could not be carried\r\nout from such a distance as Malta, the Sultan had made over Cyprus to\r\nEngland during such period as the defensive alliance might last. The\r\nconditional nature of the Convention, and the restraint shown by Her\r\nMajesty's Government in rejecting more tempting and advantageous offers\r\nare dealt with in the following passages.\r\n\r\n     We have entered into an agreement which is now embodied in a\r\n     formal Convention at Constantinople, that whenever the Russians\r\n     shall, for whatever reason, return to their Asiatic frontier as\r\n     it existed before the last war, we will immediately evacuate\r\n     the island; and that intermediately we will annually pay the\r\n     Sultan whatever is ascertained to be the surplus of revenue over\r\n     expenditure.\r\n\r\n     I am telling Your Excellency no secret when I say that we have\r\n     been very earnestly pressed, by advisers of no mean authority, to\r\n     occupy Egypt--or at least to take the borders of the Suez Canal.\r\n     Such an operation might have been very suitable for our interests\r\n     and would have presented no material difficulties.\r\n\r\n     No policy of this kind however was entertained by Her\r\n     Majesty's Government. We had received an intimation from the French\r\n     Government that any such proceeding would be very unwelcome to the\r\n     French people, and we could not but feel the reasonableness of\r\n     their objection under existing circumstances.\r\n\r\n     We have therefore turned a deaf ear to all suggestions of that\r\n     kind.\r\n\r\n     We have been likewise recommended to occupy some port on the\r\n     coast of Syria, such as Alexandretta, but we felt that, however\r\n     carefully guarded, such a proceeding might, in the present\r\n     condition of opinion with respect to the Ottoman Empire, be\r\n     construed as indicating an intention to acquire territory on the\r\n     mainland of Western Asia; and we did not desire to be suspected\r\n     of designs which will be wholly absent from our thoughts. We have\r\n     therefore preferred to accept from the Sultan the provisional\r\n     occupation of a position less advantageous indeed, but still\r\n     sufficient for the purpose, and not exposed to the inconveniences\r\n     I have mentioned. How long we shall stay there I cannot tell. But\r\n     I think there is just ground of hope that the Russians will find\r\n     in a short time that the territory they have acquired is costly\r\n     and unproductive; that the chances of making it a stepping-stone\r\n     to further conquests is cut off, and that they will abandon it as\r\n     a useless acquisition. In that case our _raison d'être_ at Cyprus\r\n     will be gone and we shall retire.\r\n\r\n     I have adopted this form of conveying the matter to you, as\r\n     the Convention being entirely within the Treaty competence of\r\n     the two Powers, requires no official communication. But it would\r\n     have been inconsistent with the feelings of friendship existing\r\n     between our two countries, and with my gratitude for your courteous\r\n     procedure towards me personally, to have allowed you to hear it\r\n     first from any other source.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt as to the identity of the 'advisers of no\r\nmean authority,' for Bismarck had been urging upon England for some\r\ntime the occupation of Egypt, obviously with the main intention of\r\ncreating discord with France, and Her Majesty's Government deserved all\r\nthe credit claimed by Lord Salisbury for resisting these overtures. It\r\nis, however, somewhat difficult to follow Lord Salisbury's reasonings\r\nfor preferring Cyprus to Alexandretta. It was plain that the occupation\r\nof either of these places would cause irritation, and as subsequent\r\nevents have shown, Cyprus has never been of much use to us, and besides\r\nbeing crushed under the burden of the tribute annually paid to the\r\nTurkish Government, is inhabited chiefly by Greeks who do not appear to\r\nthoroughly appreciate British rule. Alexandretta, on the other hand,\r\nmight, under our control, have developed into a highly important seaport\r\nand become the starting-place for the Bagdad railway; whereas, as a\r\nmatter of fact, it has now practically passed into the hands of the\r\nGermans.\r\n\r\nM. Waddington did not remain long in sole possession of his exclusive\r\ninformation, for on July 8, the Anglo-Turkish Convention was made\r\nknown to the world, and the general impression produced was that Lords\r\nBeaconsfield and Salisbury had effected a brilliant _coup_. In France,\r\nhowever, the news caused quite unjustifiable indignation, and the\r\nprudent Lord Lyons telegraphed to Lord Salisbury on July 10, advising\r\nhim to get the final acts of the Congress signed as quickly as possible,\r\nlest Waddington should be directed to come away without putting his name\r\nto anything.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 12, 1878.\r\n\r\n     Your telegram of last night was a great relief to me, but I\r\n     shall not feel quite happy till I hear that all is actually signed.\r\n     I am happy to find that Gambetta and the Ministerial Parties, who\r\n     are violent on the subject of the Convention, are not having things\r\n     all their own way in the press. No newspaper can be said to defend\r\n     England altogether, but the more sensible papers are against any\r\n     active opposition on the part of France. Gambetta and Waddington\r\n     are not friends, and Gambetta will no doubt attack Waddington and\r\n     try to upset him. This may lead to serious difficulties in France.\r\n\r\n     It is no use to shut one's eyes to the fact that at this\r\n     moment, there is a great and general irritation in France against\r\n     England. It is too soon to foresee what turn public opinion will\r\n     take eventually, but at the present moment, we must not forget to\r\n     take this irritation into account in our dealings with this country.\r\n\r\nThe general feeling was so unsatisfactory, that he felt compelled to\r\nwrite to Mr. Knollys[20] urging that the Prince of Wales, who was acting\r\nas President of the British Section of the International Exhibition,\r\nshould postpone a contemplated visit to Paris, and enclosing articles\r\nin the press of an abominable character directed against His Royal\r\nHighness. Irritation over the Anglo-Turkish Convention was not confined\r\nto one party, but existed in every class from the _haute société_\r\ndownwards. The Conservatives and their press utilized it as a means\r\nof attacking the Republic, complained of the effacement of France,\r\nand asserted that she had been duped by her former ally, while the\r\nRepublican opposition, headed by Gambetta, charged Waddington with\r\nhaving made a shameful surrender to England.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 16, 1878.\r\n\r\n     The first explosion of French wrath, on the appearance of\r\n     the Convention of the 4th of June, was even more violent than I\r\n     anticipated. It was well that you had the Minister for Foreign\r\n     Affairs under _your_ influence, and at a distance from that of\r\n     the excited spirits here. Now the first force of the eruption is\r\n     spent and the lava cooled down. I am afraid only on the surface,\r\n     but any way, it must be the surface which cools first. At all\r\n     events the strong language is in great measure abandoned. In the\r\n     first place, as no one now recommends any immediate action on the\r\n     part of France, the French are beginning to see that they cut a\r\n     sorry figure by barking without biting. In the second place, they\r\n     conceive that the alliance of the Three Empires is as close as\r\n     ever, and they think that if they quarrel with England, they will\r\n     be giving a triumph to Bismarck and find themselves face to face\r\n     with him without any friend on their side. Lastly, I would fain\r\n     hope that some of them are beginning to take a really reasonable\r\n     view of things, and to see that we had absolutely nothing left for\r\n     it, but to act for ourselves, as they would not or could not help\r\n     us.\r\n\r\n     Still we shall have some trouble with them, and shall probably\r\n     find them for some time suspicious, jealous, and hard to deal with.\r\n\r\n     Egypt may be our first difficulty. With or without a hint\r\n     from home, French agents there will be seeking to trip us up. It\r\n     seems to me that our task there will be a delicate one. On the one\r\n     hand, it will no doubt be desirable to soothe French vanity as far\r\n     as possible; but, on the other hand, anything like a defeat or a\r\n     retreat in Egypt, might very much impair the prestige which the\r\n     position which we have taken with regard to Asia has given us.\r\n     I wish Rivers Wilson had already been installed as Minister of\r\n     Finance when the Convention of the 4th June was made public.\r\n\r\n     Another ticklish question is that of the Newfoundland\r\n     Fisheries. I am very anxious to know what, if anything, passed\r\n     between you and Waddington on the subject at Berlin. The present\r\n     moment does not seem a very happy one for resuming negotiations,\r\n     and at all events it might be well to keep the matter, if possible,\r\n     in the calm atmosphere of London, and at a distance from the heat\r\n     of the political weather here.\r\n\r\n     I have been indirectly in communication with Gambetta, and\r\n     have reason to hope he is being brought, or is coming of himself,\r\n     round about the Convention. What I am immediately afraid of is\r\n     his nevertheless trying to upset Waddington. I should regret\r\n     Waddington's fall on all grounds, and it would be extremely awkward\r\n     to have a successor in the office brought in on the pretext that\r\n     Waddington had not been stiff enough with regard to England. The\r\n     candidates for his place are said to be Freycinet, the present\r\n     Minister of Public Works, who was Gambetta's Sub-Minister for War\r\n     in 1870 and 1871; M. Duclerc, one of the Vice-Presidents of the\r\n     Senate, who passes for a moderate man, but who has no knowledge of\r\n     foreign affairs, and Gambetta himself. I suppose, however, Gambetta\r\n     would be an impossibility with the Marshal, and that he himself\r\n     would feel that he was compromising his prospect of greater things\r\n     hereafter, by taking a subordinate office now.\r\n\r\nM. Waddington, upon his return from Berlin, realizing doubtless that his\r\nposition had been shaken, though from no fault of his own, intimated\r\nhis intention of writing a despatch in which Her Majesty's Government\r\nwould be called upon to give to the French certain assurances with\r\nregard to Egypt and Tunis. As it was desirable that this request should\r\nnot be made in too peremptory a manner, he was exhorted to make his\r\ncommunication in such a way as would make it easy for Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment to return a cordial answer. The difficulty about giving the\r\nassurances was pointed out by Lord Salisbury.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, July 20, 1878.\r\n\r\n     What M. Waddington said to you is very much what he said to me\r\n     at Berlin, though the lurid touches about war have been filled in\r\n     afterwards.\r\n\r\n     The precise answer to be given to his promised despatch must\r\n     of course depend very much on the terms in which it is framed. But\r\n     he may be certain that we shall answer it not only with the desire\r\n     of cultivating to the utmost possible extent our good relations\r\n     with France, but also with the aim of making his own personal task\r\n     more easy, as far as it is in our power to contribute to that\r\n     result.\r\n\r\n     The matter to which he has called your attention, as he did\r\n     ours at Berlin, was difficult to make the subject of binding\r\n     assurances, because the contingencies under which those assurances\r\n     would receive a practical application are difficult to foresee.\r\n\r\n     If France occupied Tunis to-morrow, we should not even\r\n     remonstrate. But to promise that publicly would be a little\r\n     difficult, because we must avoid giving away other people's\r\n     property without their consent, and also because it is no business\r\n     of ours to pronounce beforehand on the considerations which Italy\r\n     would probably advance upon that subject. In the same way, with\r\n     respect to Egypt, we have stated distinctly more than once that we\r\n     do not entertain any intention of occupying it; and that statement\r\n     we are perfectly willing to renew. But, having done that, and\r\n     having expressed our anxiety to work with France in Egypt, we\r\n     have said as much as would be seemly or possible. We can hardly\r\n     pledge the Khedive as to what he means to do, without in reality\r\n     assuming a voice in his concerns which we do not, according to any\r\n     international right, possess.\r\n\r\n     These considerations make me rather anxious that M. Waddington\r\n     in his proposed despatch should avoid putting categorical questions\r\n     which we might not be able to answer precisely as he wishes,\r\n     and yet which we could not avoid answering without seeming to\r\n     exhibit precisely that coolness which he very properly and justly\r\n     deprecates, and any appearance of which we are as anxious as he is\r\n     to avoid. I think that his despatch--if I might suggest it--would\r\n     more properly take the form of a statement, in general terms, of\r\n     the territorial points on the African coast in which France takes\r\n     an interest, leaving us to make such assurances as we think we can\r\n     properly give, and which we will certainly make as cordial as we\r\n     can.\r\n\r\n     To French influence in Egypt we do not offer any objection;\r\n     and we have never taken any step calculated to oust it. But any\r\n     detailed engagements as to questions of administration could\r\n     not be taken without imprudence; for each step must be taken as\r\n     the necessity for it arises. The two great points are to keep\r\n     the Khedive on the throne, and to get the financial obligations\r\n     satisfied. For these objects, the two countries will, I hope,\r\n     co-operate heartily.\r\n\r\n     I am a little anxious as to the form he gives his despatch,\r\n     for if he makes it too peremptory, he may produce that very\r\n     appearance of estrangement which it is our common object to avoid.\r\n\r\n     I will write to you more fully about the Newfoundland\r\n     Fisheries when I have had time to study the papers. My\r\n     conversations with him have put me fully in possession of the\r\n     French case. I am not so certain that I know all the points of the\r\n     English case.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity fortunately occurred of conciliating one personage who\r\nmight have given a great deal of trouble, and afforded an instance of\r\nthe influence which can occasionally be brought to bear upon advanced\r\ndemocrats when judiciously applied.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 21, 1878.\r\n\r\n     The Prince of Wales leaves Paris for London to-night. As his\r\n     arrival at Paris to attend the English concerts at the Exhibition\r\n     had been publicly announced, I did not think that it would be\r\n     advisable that it should be postponed, but I have been a little\r\n     nervous about it. So far however there has been no contretemps, and\r\n     the visit has been politically useful.\r\n\r\n     The Prince invited Gambetta to breakfast with him yesterday.\r\n     It was His Royal Highness's own idea, but I thought it judicious.\r\n     I have not the least doubt that if the Prince of Wales had not\r\n     been civil to Gambetta, the Russian Embassy would have asked any\r\n     Grand Duke who came here to show him particular attention, in order\r\n     to bring him over to Russia. The success of such a manoeuvre has I\r\n     think been effectually guarded against.\r\n\r\n     Gambetta appears to have spoken to the Prince strongly in\r\n     favour of an alliance between France and England--to have declared\r\n     himself more or less reconciled to the Convention of June 4th--and\r\n     to have spoken in the most disparaging terms, not so much of the\r\n     Foreign Policy of Russia, as of the institutions, the Government,\r\n     and the administration of that country. I hear from other quarters\r\n     that Gambetta was extremely pleased with the interview. I am\r\n     assured also that the Prince of Wales acquitted himself with great\r\n     skill. The Prince thought, and so did I, that it was better that\r\n     I should not be at the breakfast. The Embassy was represented by\r\n     Sheffield. The occasion of the invitation to Gambetta was his\r\n     having been very obliging and useful in matters connected with the\r\n     Exhibition.\r\n\r\n     To-day Waddington met the Prince of Wales at luncheon at the\r\n     Embassy.\r\n\r\n     So far, then, things look well, but I am assured the calm\r\n     does not extend far below the surface. Gambetta has the southern\r\n     temperament, and his language is a good deal influenced by the\r\n     impression of the moment. He has postponed, but he has not really\r\n     given up, his attack on Waddington. He will still, if he continues\r\n     in his present mood, try to turn him out in October, when the\r\n     Chambers reassemble.\r\n\r\n     The thing which would have most effect in reconciling the\r\n     French to our acquisition and protectorate, would be to make them\r\n     practically advantageous to the holders of Turkish and Egyptian\r\n     Bonds.\r\n\r\nWhen M. Waddington eventually presented his despatch, or rather\r\ndespatches, for there were two, they were apparently found\r\nunobjectionable in tone; but on the ground that the one referring to\r\nTunis was not 'couched in more diplomatic language,' it was suggested to\r\nhim that he should rewrite it in language more suitable for publication\r\nsubsequently; this he declined to do, but promised not to publish it at\r\nall. The chief object presumably of these communications was: in the\r\nfirst place to obtain assurances from England with regard to Egypt,\r\nand in the second place to make Lord Salisbury's statement about Tunis\r\nappear as an invitation to the French to appropriate that country. M.\r\nWaddington, quite naturally, did not wish it to be thought that he had\r\ncome back empty handed from Berlin at a time when the Great Christian\r\nPowers were helping themselves liberally at the Turk's expense.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    July 24, 1878.\r\n\r\n     Waddington's two despatches were left with me yesterday. They\r\n     are very friendly in tone and will not, I think, be difficult to\r\n     answer. The answers however must be delayed some days, as the\r\n     Cabinet does not meet till Saturday.\r\n\r\n     Intermediately, I demur a little to the quotations that he\r\n     makes from my conversation. The general tenor is quite accurate,\r\n     but his vivacious French by no means renders the tone of my\r\n     communication, and what is of more importance, to the rights and\r\n     claims of other Powers, Turkey and Italy especially. What I told\r\n     him was that if a state of things should arise in which there was\r\n     no other obstacle to his occupying Tunis but our objection, that\r\n     objection would not be made. I made the observation for the purpose\r\n     of showing him that we had no Mediterranean aspirations--and did\r\n     not desire to disturb the balance of power in that sea. Our eyes\r\n     were bent wholly on the East. But he makes me talk of Tunis and\r\n     Carthage as if they had been my own personal property and I was\r\n     making him a liberal wedding present.\r\n\r\n     I do not know whether he will be inclined to put his\r\n     quotations from my conversations into a more general form. I think\r\n     it will save the possibility of misunderstanding later; and will\r\n     also dispense with the necessity of a correction on my part, as he\r\n     has reported the general drift and terms of my observations with\r\n     perfect fidelity.\r\n\r\nThe reception of the Anglo-Turkish Convention in France may be said to\r\nhave been the first of a series of difficulties which unfortunately\r\nimpaired the relations between France and England during many years,\r\nbut which have now happily almost entirely disappeared. The irritation\r\naroused in France was completely unjustified, and almost incapable of\r\nexplanation, unless the secrecy which surrounded the negotiation of the\r\nConvention may be considered an adequate cause. No French interests were\r\nprejudicially affected; and the maintenance of secrecy really relieved\r\nFrance from a considerable difficulty, for a premature disclosure might\r\nhave prevented the participation of France in the Congress; but oddly\r\nenough, the Anglo-Turkish Convention appeared to be the only matter\r\nrelating to the Congress in which the French took any interest, and\r\nso much indignation did some patriots show that it was even seriously\r\nsuggested that by way of inflicting a surprise upon England, France\r\nshould seize Chios, or Rhodes, or Crete. In fact, at one time, Crete\r\nappeared to possess considerably greater attractions than Tunis, in\r\nspite of the latter's proximity to Algeria.\r\n\r\nProbably the real explanation of this display of temper was that the\r\nFrench felt their strength to be returning, and were in no mood to\r\nput up with what they erroneously considered to be a slight, whether\r\nintentional or unintentional.\r\n\r\nOne frantic jeremiad from Constantinople over the Treaty of Berlin may\r\nbe quoted before the subject is dismissed. Layard, who had been already\r\ngreatly scandalized by the publication of the Anglo-Russian agreement,\r\nwrote:--\r\n\r\n     What do you think of the Treaty of Berlin? It appears to\r\n     me that if ever an apple of discord was thrown amongst nations,\r\n     this is the one. I see in it the elements of future wars and\r\n     disorders without number, and an upsetting of all the principles\r\n     of justice and right which have hitherto governed the relations\r\n     and intercourse of states. Force and fraud have triumphed, and\r\n     when Turkey has been completely destroyed and cut up under the new\r\n     system, it will probably be applied with similar successful results\r\n     to other countries. Russia has gained, with the assistance of\r\n     Germany, all and more than she wanted, and the interests of England\r\n     and of other Powers were sacrificed in order to enable Bismarck\r\n     to recruit his beery stomach by drinking some mineral waters.\r\n     It is all very well to sit round a green table and to cut up an\r\n     Empire on a map. It is a very different thing to put what has been\r\n     so easily settled into execution. I anticipate no end of trouble\r\n     and bloodshed for years to come in this unhappy country. We have\r\n     not yet recovered here from the effect of the publication of the\r\n     unfortunate memorandum which so completely destroyed the great and\r\n     commanding position that we had acquired.\r\n\r\nThere is not much here about Peace with Honour.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Jan. 7, 1876.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Jan. 24, 1877.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Nobiling's attempt to assassinate the German Emperor.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Now Viscount Knollys.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nM. GRÉVY'S PRESIDENCY\r\n\r\n(1878-1879)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe event in 1878 which aroused more interest in France than the Berlin\r\nCongress or anything else, was the holding of the great Exhibition\r\nin Paris, which not only demonstrated to the world the recovery of\r\nFrance from the disasters of 1870-71, but had the beneficial effect\r\nof improving Anglo-French relations. It was universally acknowledged\r\nthat nothing had contributed more to the success of the Exhibition\r\nthan the hearty co-operation given from first to last by England, and\r\nin this connection the services rendered by the Prince of Wales were\r\nof conspicuous value. His Royal Highness had come to Paris early in\r\nthe year to press forward the preparations of the British section; he\r\nwas present at each important phase of the Exhibition; he attended\r\nunremittingly at the office of the British Royal Commission, and was\r\nassiduous in transacting business there with the French Exhibition\r\nauthorities as well as with the British and Colonial Commissioners and\r\nexhibitors. These visible proofs of the Prince's interest in their great\r\nundertaking were by no means lost upon the French, and the judgment and\r\ntact which he displayed, whenever opportunities arose for impressing\r\nupon the French people the cordial feeling entertained by himself and\r\nby his country towards France, produced an excellent political effect.\r\n\r\nThe Exhibition naturally threw upon the Embassy an immense amount of\r\nextra labour, consisting largely of social work, and one of the most\r\nbrilliant social functions of the year was a ball at the British Embassy\r\nattended by the Prince and Princess of Wales, at which the various\r\nhostile sections of the French political world met, on that occasion\r\nonly, in temporary harmony.\r\n\r\nThe general success of the Exhibition and the prominence of English\r\nparticipation inspired Queen Victoria with the desire to pay a very\r\nprivate visit to Paris, accompanied by Princess Beatrice and a small\r\nsuite, towards the beginning of August. So anxious was she to maintain\r\nsecrecy that the only person in England to whom her intention was\r\nconfided, was Lord Beaconsfield, and Lord Lyons was enjoined not to say\r\na word about it to any one, but to inform her confidentially whether she\r\ncould visit the Exhibition without being mobbed; whether the heat was\r\nlikely to be intense; and whether there was any danger to be apprehended\r\nfrom Socialists--the term Socialist doubtless including, in the Royal\r\nvocabulary, Anarchists, Terrorists, and Revolutionaries in general.\r\nIncidentally, too, she expressed a wish to hear the Ambassador's opinion\r\nof the Treaty of Berlin.\r\n\r\nLord Lyons answered the first queries satisfactorily, but it was\r\ncharacteristic of him that, even to his sovereign, he declined to commit\r\nhimself to an opinion on the policy of his official chief. 'Lord Lyons\r\nwas always of opinion that Your Majesty's Representative at the Congress\r\nshould be a Cabinet Minister, and he rejoiced very much when he heard\r\nthat Lord Beaconsfield and Lord Salisbury had been appointed. He has no\r\ndetailed or authentic information of the proceedings of the Congress,\r\nbut so far as he can judge at present, he has every hope that the\r\nresults will be satisfactory to Your Majesty.'\r\n\r\nA long series of letters followed, and after much hesitation, the\r\nQueen finally abandoned her intention, the prospect of hot weather\r\napparently proving to be too great a deterrent. One singular incident in\r\nthe correspondence, which was conducted with much secrecy, was that a\r\nletter from Lord Lyons went all the way to New York before reaching its\r\ndestination at Balmoral--an error for which some one presumably suffered.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn and winter of 1878, constant discussions took\r\nplace between the English and French Governments on the subject of\r\nquestions connected with Egypt and Tunis, and it was again thought\r\nat one time that a French _coup_ was in contemplation as a reply to\r\nthe Anglo-Turkish Convention. The New Year was signalized by the\r\ndenunciation of the Commercial Treaty. In announcing this intelligence,\r\nLord Lyons said that his only surprise was that the existing Treaty had\r\nlasted so long, and that he did not consider it advisable to make any\r\nattempt to conceal annoyance about it. The treaty of 1860 had been made\r\nfrom political motives, and our best chance of being decently treated\r\ncommercially lay in the dislike of the French to placing themselves on\r\nbad terms with us. 'This is the policy Gambetta avows. As for any Free\r\nTrade feeling in France, that is absolutely a broken reed for us to lean\r\nupon.'\r\n\r\nIn January, 1879, senatorial elections took place which resulted in\r\nlarge Republican gains, and it seemed probable that the existing\r\nModerate Ministry might not last much longer. It was generally expected\r\nthat when the Chambers met, there would be a great struggle on the\r\npart of the advanced Left for all the lucrative and important posts,\r\nand there were the usual fears of mob rule which prevailed whenever\r\na partial or entire change of Ministry was imminent. The prospect\r\nof losing Waddington as Foreign Minister drew from Lord Salisbury a\r\ncharacteristic expression of regret: 'I suppose M. Waddington is likely\r\nto be a transitory phenomenon, if the papers are to be believed. I am\r\nsorry for it; for he suits us much better than some converted Legitimist\r\nwith an historic name, whose policy I suppose will be a compound of\r\nLouis XIV. and 1791.'\r\n\r\nWaddington was not to go yet, however, and Lord Lyons complained that\r\nhe made his life a burden to him in connection with the proceedings\r\nof the British Consul General at Tunis--an aged official who did not\r\nview the spirited French policy there with any friendly eye, and whose\r\nremoval the French Government ardently desired. As a general massacre of\r\naged official innocents was contemplated shortly by the British Foreign\r\nOffice, a somewhat ignominious compromise was offered in the shape of\r\nan early retirement of this particular official under an age limit. The\r\nFrench intentions with regard to Tunis had by this time become quite\r\nevident, and the unfortunate Bey found it extremely difficult to prevent\r\nexcuses being found for active intervention in the shape of naval\r\ndemonstrations and so forth; it being well known that Marshal MacMahon\r\nand other military men were extremely eager to annex the country at the\r\nfirst opportunity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Jan. 14, 1879.\r\n\r\n     I should be very sorry to do anything disagreeable to the\r\n     French with regard to Tunis. It is the place about which they are\r\n     most susceptible at this moment, and the irritation they would feel\r\n     at any interference with them there, would overpower, at all events\r\n     for the time, all considerations of the general advantages of being\r\n     well with England.\r\n\r\n     When I said that I saw no reason for hiding any displeasure we\r\n     might feel at the denunciation of the Commercial Treaties and at\r\n     the manner in which it was done, I meant that we should not abstain\r\n     from direct expressions of dissatisfaction at the thing itself.\r\n\r\n     My notion is that if we take it too quietly, the\r\n     Protectionists will be able to make the Chambers believe that they\r\n     can do what they like about the Tariff, and need not fear any\r\n     resentment from England. I think that if it can be managed, it\r\n     will be advisable to put it out of the power of the ministers to\r\n     say that the denunciation has been well received by the English\r\n     Government, and has produced no bad impression upon it. In order to\r\n     effect this, I should be glad that something unmistakable on the\r\n     point should be said in a written communication. If, as I suppose,\r\n     Montebello's[21] answer to your note declares that the intention\r\n     is to denounce the Treaties one and all, then the rejoinder which\r\n     you must make in order to _prendre acte_ of the denunciation\r\n     would afford a natural opportunity of expressing annoyance and\r\n     apprehension. This is what was in my mind when I wrote.\r\n\r\n     There are many members in the Chamber who would deprecate\r\n     anything likely to produce coolness between France and England,\r\n     and it is not desirable to leave the Protectionists the means\r\n     of asserting that there is no danger that a restrictive tariff\r\n     would do this. But the feeling is a vague one, and it would be\r\n     weakened by endeavours to define it sharply, or to appeal to it too\r\n     pointedly.\r\n\r\n     Gambetta holds that the true policy of France is to cultivate\r\n     the friendship of England and not to loosen the tie of France upon\r\n     her by instructions injurious to her commerce. He is in particular\r\n     very much afraid of the feeling in favour of the Empire which would\r\n     be revived in the wine-growing districts, if under the Republic the\r\n     English wine duties became less favourable to French wines.\r\n\r\n     The game of the Protectionists is to put the duties in the\r\n     general tariff as high as they dare, without provoking retaliation;\r\n     and the general tariff once passed, to declare that it is the\r\n     latest expression of the will of the country, and that the\r\n     Government has no right to relax it by treaty, unless by way of\r\n     barter, in return for great concessions made to France.\r\n\r\n     In the mean time matters may possibly in some measure\r\n     be modified, as regards commercial policy by changes in the\r\n     Government, but the modification in this respect would scarcely be\r\n     very great.\r\n\r\n     The 'groups,' as they are called, of the Left have been\r\n     endeavouring to get the ministers to negotiate with them before\r\n     the Chambers met. They want, now the Chambers have met, to reduce\r\n     the Ministers to absolute dependence on Parliamentary Committees.\r\n     The Ministers are acting properly and constitutionally. They\r\n     decline to be dictated to by groups and committees, and they intend\r\n     to announce their programme from the Tribune, and to call for a\r\n     vote of confidence or want of confidence, from both Chambers.\r\n     Waddington, when I saw him yesterday, was very confident of\r\n     success. They have found it necessary to sacrifice the Minister\r\n     of War, who, among other defects was entirely inefficient in the\r\n     Tribune, but Waddington did not anticipate any other changes in the\r\n     Cabinet. He said that Gambetta had promised the Government his full\r\n     and cordial support.\r\n\r\n     To pass from Paris, or rather from Versailles to\r\n     Constantinople, I will give you for what it may be worth, a story\r\n     which has been brought to the Embassy by a person who has sometimes\r\n     shown himself to be well informed with regard to what is passing\r\n     at the Porte. He affirms that a compact has been made between\r\n     Khaireddin and Osman Pashas to dethrone Sultan Abdul Hamid and set\r\n     aside the Othman family altogether as effete and half insane. This\r\n     being done, a member of a family established at Konia is, according\r\n     to my informant, to be declared Sultan.\r\n\r\n     I have often heard of the Konia family as having a sort of\r\n     pretention to the throne, as descending from Seljuk Sultans or some\r\n     other dynasty overthrown by Othman or his successors.\r\n\r\n     Abdul Hamid does not generally leave his Grand Viziers in\r\n     office long enough for them to be able to mature a 'conspiracy\r\n     against him.'\r\n\r\nIn January a prolonged struggle took place between the Ministry and the\r\nLeft, chiefly over the burning question of Government officials, and\r\nthe alleged unwillingness to introduce really Republican measures; and\r\nbefore the end of the month Marshal MacMahon and his Prime Minister,\r\nM. Dufaure tendered their resignations. It was well known that the\r\nMarshal was anxious to take this course, and he followed the advice of\r\nhis friends in choosing, as his reason for resigning, his inability\r\nto concur in a measure which deprived some officers of high rank of\r\ntheir military commands. When, therefore, he was confronted with the\r\nalternative of signing the decree removing his old companions in arms,\r\nor of resigning himself, he replied that Ministers would have to look\r\nout for another President, and M. Grévy, a comparatively moderate\r\nLiberal, was elected in his place by a large majority. The 'transitory\r\nphenomenon,' M. Waddington, however, remained in office and indeed\r\nbecame head of a new Administration, but it was felt that this\r\narrangement was merely temporary. Power had really passed into the hands\r\nof Gambetta, and although he contented himself, for the time being, with\r\nthe Presidency of the Chamber of Deputies, there was nothing to prevent\r\nhim from establishing himself in office, whenever he should think that\r\nthe opportune moment had arrived; since, unlike the Speakership in\r\nEngland, the Presidency of the Chamber is looked upon in France as the\r\nroad to the highest Ministerial rank.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the election of a new President of the Republic in\r\nthe person of M. Grévy, the question arose as to whether the Foreign\r\nRepresentatives should receive fresh credentials, and the action of\r\nPrince Bismarck in this connection caused fresh discord amongst leading\r\nFrench politicians. When M. Waddington was at Berlin, he had made a\r\nvery favourable impression upon the Chancellor, and as he himself\r\nsubsequently informed me, Bismarck had taken great pains to be civil\r\nto him, and to manifest that especial confidence which takes the form\r\nof abusing other people--notably Prince Gortschakoff. He now took the\r\nopportunity to inform M. Waddington that he entertained such remarkable\r\nesteem for him, that he had advised the Emperor to dispense with any new\r\nletter of credence, a proceeding which infuriated Gambetta and disposed\r\nhim to upset Waddington at an early date. 'Altogether there seems an\r\nimpression,' wrote Lord Lyons, 'that the new Ministry will not last\r\nlong. Gambetta does not like either Grévy or Waddington. Waddington has\r\nyet to show that he has the staff of a Prime Minister in him. He has\r\nnot hitherto been a very ready or a very effective speaker. He is\r\neven said to have a slight English accent in speaking French. I don't\r\nbelieve any one ever perceived this who did not know beforehand that he\r\nhad had an English education. But this English education certainly has\r\nhad the effect of preventing him having exactly French modes of thought\r\nand French ways, and thus he is not always completely in tune with the\r\nfeelings of his hearers in Parliament.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _J Russell & Sons, Phot._\r\n\r\n_William Henry Waddington_\r\n\r\nLONDON: EDWARD ARNOLD]\r\n\r\nIt was a common charge made against the late M. Waddington by his\r\nopponents that he spoke French with an English, and English with a\r\nFrench accent. As a matter of fact, he was a perfect specimen of a\r\nbilinguist, and would have passed as a native of either nation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Feb. 11, 1879.\r\n\r\n     Fournier's[22] vagaries are becoming very dangerous, but we\r\n     are in a state of anarchy here. The Ministry is composed in general\r\n     of men of respectable character and respectable abilities; but\r\n     there is no one of them who has hitherto obtained any great hold\r\n     on the Chambers or on the country. Their proper game would be to\r\n     try and form a Liberal-Conservative party of the Centre Gauche,\r\n     the Centre Droit, and the Gauche Républicaine, with whose support\r\n     and that of the country at large, they might keep the Ultra Reds\r\n     in check. Hitherto they have not shown that there is stuff enough\r\n     in them for this, but then they have hardly had a chance. They\r\n     have made a weak compromise on the Amnesty Question, but if they\r\n     get a good majority on that question, they might start afresh and\r\n     show what is in them. So far they are looked upon by most people\r\n     as warming pans for Gambetta and his followers: and I have been\r\n     assured that some of the French Representatives abroad do not\r\n     hesitate to communicate with Gambetta behind Waddington's back.\r\n\r\n     I must confess that, contrary to my wont, I am rather gloomy\r\n     about the state of things here. The relaxation of the efficiency\r\n     of the police is undeniable. This was one of the symptoms of the\r\n     decay of the Empire. The Gendarmerie is being tampered with. Recent\r\n     measures seem to increase the opportunities for disturbances, and\r\n     diminish the means of dealing with them. I do not see where, in\r\n     the present Government, resistance to disorder is to come from in\r\n     an emergency. But I will not croak. Waddington and his colleagues\r\n     may steady themselves in office and restore authority yet, but they\r\n     have not much time to lose.\r\n\r\n     Waddington would be the safest Minister we could have in\r\n     Eastern Affairs, if he made his subordinates abroad obey him.\r\n     Gambetta might be more friendly in commercial matters and more\r\n     ready to be an active ally in the East, but he would expect a\r\n     recompense in the West, and might be a dangerous friend who would\r\n     require careful 'watching.'\r\n\r\nPoor M. Waddington's prospects were not improved by a trivial but\r\nuntoward incident in the Chamber. In the course of one of his first\r\nspeeches as Prime Minister 'a great deal of laughter is said to have\r\nbeen produced by his dropping some of the sheets of his written speech\r\nover the edge of the Tribune, and having to wait till they were picked\r\nup'--an incident which serves to show the more generous spirit of the\r\nBritish politician, since a recent Prime Minister was in the habit of\r\ndelivering soul-stirring orations by the same method, without evoking\r\nany disrespectful criticism on the part of his opponents.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of February a crisis in Egypt rendered it necessary for\r\nthe British and French Governments to have recourse to joint action for\r\nthe purpose of protecting their interests.\r\n\r\nAs the result of a Commission of Inquiry in 1878, the Khedive Ismail,\r\nwho had long boasted that Egypt was practically a European state,\r\naccepted the position of a Constitutional Ruler, with Nubar Pasha as\r\nhis Prime Minister, Mr. Rivers Wilson[23] as Minister of Finance, and a\r\nFrenchman, M. de Blignières, as Minister of Public Works. It was in the\r\nhighest degree improbable that a man of his intriguing and ambitious\r\ncharacter would submit permanently to any such restraint, and before\r\nlong he succeeded in working upon the disaffection of those persons\r\nwhose privileges were threatened or affected by European control, to\r\nsuch an extent that, by organizing a military riot, he was able to force\r\nNubar Pasha to resign on February 20, 1879. At the same time he demanded\r\nmuch greater powers for himself, including the right to preside over the\r\nCabinet, and to have all measures submitted to his approval--demands\r\nwhich were strongly resisted by his European Ministers, who invoked the\r\nsupport of their Governments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Feb. 21, 1879.\r\n\r\n     I have just received your telegram announcing your concurrence\r\n     in Waddington's draft instructions to Cairo, and I shall\r\n     communicate it to him forthwith.\r\n\r\n     Waddington seemed quite firm on the point of not allowing\r\n     the Khedive to resume his personal power, and would no doubt be\r\n     ready to join in any practical steps for that purpose; but in\r\n     the meantime it may be feared that His Highness is consolidating\r\n     his resumption of power. Waddington looks upon the whole affair\r\n     as a simple manoevre of the Khedive to upset the new system of\r\n     government. It does not in fact seem likely that so arrant a\r\n     coward would have risked his own precious person, if he had not\r\n     had a pretty good understanding with the rioters. Public opinion\r\n     in France would, I think, support Waddington in taking strong\r\n     measures. There does not seem to be any one but Nubar of position\r\n     enough to be a Prime Minister of any independence; Waddington\r\n     seemed fully aware that if the Khedive is present at the council of\r\n     Ministers, no Egyptian Minister will open his lips.\r\n\r\n     Godeaux telegraphed last night that order having been\r\n     restored, the presence of a ship of war at Alexandria might not be\r\n     necessary, but Waddington thought on the contrary that it would\r\n     be 'essential in order to produce a salutary impression on the\r\n     Khedive, and keep him in some check.'\r\n\r\nNubar Pasha was regarded as English and anti-French, and his fall was,\r\ntherefore, received at Paris with some degree of complacency; but the\r\nfeeling was not sufficiently strong to make the Government hold out\r\nagainst his restoration to office, should that be considered necessary\r\nfor the purpose of checking the Khedive, and the tendency was to make\r\nno suggestions and to wait for the lead of England, it being understood\r\nthat both Governments were resolved not to consent to any change of the\r\npolitical system in Egypt.\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    March 1, 1879.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     As to Egypt, I gather from your telegram to-day that\r\n     Waddington looks on our message to Vivian[24] as in the nature of\r\n     an ultimatum, and he is puzzled what we are to do next if it should\r\n     be rejected. We do not in the least look on it as an ultimatum, and\r\n     it is not so phrased. We may well receive either from the Khedive\r\n     or the Agents some alternative proposal which may be discussed,\r\n     and perhaps hammered into an acceptable arrangement at least for\r\n     a time. But in any case our position cannot be worse here than if\r\n     we had acquiesced at once in the results of the conspiracy against\r\n     Nubar; while the chances are that it will enable us to arrive at\r\n     some plan for partially curbing the Khedive, which at all events\r\n     shall partially disguise the check we have undoubtedly received.\r\n     The causes are obscure. It is evident there has been imprudence. I\r\n     wish I could be quite satisfied there has been perfect loyalty.\r\n\r\nWriting a day or two later, Lord Salisbury explained that he was in some\r\ndifficulty, as Mr. Vivian and Mr. Rivers Wilson held different opinions.\r\nThe former wanted to conciliate the Khedive by not forcing upon him the\r\nrestoration of Nubar, while Mr. Rivers Wilson strongly insisted upon his\r\nreturn. Lord Salisbury himself was inclined to the latter course because\r\n'otherwise the Khedive will be like a horse who has succeeded in beating\r\nhis rider, and will never be safe for that rider to mount again,' but\r\neventually decided against it. From the following letter it looks as\r\nif the retirement of the hapless British Representative at Tunis was\r\nintended as a peace offering to the cause of Anglo-French joint action\r\nin Egypt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    March 6, 1879.\r\n\r\n     It is better always to get the credit of one's good actions,\r\n     which are naturally few. Will you kindly tell M. Waddington in the\r\n     most unofficial way in the world that----having returned himself as\r\n     67 years of age (he entered the service 55 years ago, and therefore\r\n     must have begun his public labours at a precocious age) we have\r\n     suppressed the Consulate General of Tunis, and that there will\r\n     henceforth be a man on reduced salary, a consul or agent, after the\r\n     close of this month.\r\n\r\n     I think the French will find difficulties enough with Italy if\r\n     they ever try to increase their influence in Tunis; but that is no\r\n     affair of ours. We have hot water enough elsewhere without desiring\r\n     to boil any in Tunis.\r\n\r\n     One good turn deserves another, and I hope Waddington will\r\n     feel himself bound to keep his agents from Anglophobia in Turkey.\r\n\r\n     The Egyptian compromise will do very well for the time. It\r\n     seems doubtful whether Nubar is worth anything now. An Oriental\r\n     does not easily pluck up a spirit when he has once been beaten, and\r\n     Nubar is reported to have told friends in England that he knew that\r\n     whenever the Khedive had done with him there was a cup of coffee\r\n     waiting for him.\r\n\r\nThe compromise referred to took the form of a new Egyptian Ministry\r\ncontaining the two English and French representatives, and nominally\r\npresided over by the Khedive's eldest son, Prince Tewfik. The\r\nexperiment, however, of trying to keep a Ministry in office in spite of\r\nthe opposition of the chief of the State did not last long, for in April\r\nthe irrepressible Khedive dismissed his Ministers and installed Cherif\r\nPasha as Prime Minister. This spirited action caused M. Waddington\r\nmuch perplexity, as he did not believe that French public opinion\r\nwould allow him to take a slap in the face quietly from the Khedive.\r\nThe French bondholders were too influential to think of throwing them\r\nover, and then there was the Crédit Foncier, a more or less Government\r\nestablishment, which no French Government could allow to come to grief.\r\nThere was a keen desire to maintain the concert between England and\r\nFrance on Egyptian affairs, but if the bondholders suspected that\r\nEngland was likely to be lukewarm on their behalf, there was a strong\r\nprobability that the French Government might be forced to act alone\r\nin the enforcement of French claims. Lord Salisbury on his side was\r\nnaturally reluctant to be identified with the bondholders' cause.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    April 10, 1879.\r\n\r\n     I see by your telegrams which have arrived to-day that M.\r\n     Waddington suggests as a means of coercion against the Khedive that\r\n     MM. Rothschild should refuse to pay him the balance of the loan.\r\n     Mr. Rivers Wilson had made the same suggestion to the Baron. But\r\n     the latter, in a message sent yesterday through his son, repudiated\r\n     any idea of such a proceeding as dishonourable, and attributed the\r\n     suggestion to momentary excitement.\r\n\r\n     With respect to the second idea, the only question is whether\r\n     the Sultan will ever summon up courage to take such a step, and\r\n     if he does, whether he can enforce it. If it can be done quite\r\n     smoothly, _perhaps_ it would be the best course; but I speak with\r\n     some doubt.\r\n\r\n     It may be quite tolerable and even agreeable to the French\r\n     Government to go into partnership with the bondholders; or rather\r\n     to act as sheriffs' officer for them. But to us it is a new and\r\n     very embarrassing sensation. Egypt never can prosper so long as\r\n     some 25 per cent. of her revenue goes in paying interest on her\r\n     debt. We have no wish to part company with France: still less do we\r\n     mean that France should acquire in Egypt any special ascendency;\r\n     but subject to these two considerations I should be glad to be free\r\n     of the companionship of the bondholders.\r\n\r\nM. Waddington's 'second idea' evidently referred to the deposing of the\r\nKhedive by means of the Sultan; but his difficulty lay in the old French\r\njealousy of the Porte exercising influence over the internal affairs\r\nof Egypt, and during the reign of Sultan Abdul Aziz the consequence of\r\nthat influence had certainly been a constant drain of money from Cairo\r\nto Constantinople. One suggestion was that the Sultan should summon the\r\nKhedive to come to Constantinople to do homage, a ceremony which he\r\nhad never yet performed, and a refusal to obey would have made him a\r\nrebel in the Sultan's eyes; but the objection to this course was that\r\nthe Khedive might, if he went, take large sums of money with him and so\r\npropitiate his suzerain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    April 16, 1879.\r\n\r\n     Waddington's policy is not very intelligible. I suppose it\r\n     is a compromise between a sense of the danger of doing anything\r\n     strong, and of the necessity of satisfying the Crédit Foncier.\r\n     In the despatch which you will receive we have done our best to\r\n     accommodate ourselves to Waddington's view, without taking up a\r\n     wholly untenable position.\r\n\r\n     There is one thing which it is necessary not to forget, though\r\n     I could not mention it in the despatch. We have very different\r\n     audiences to please; and though we may agree upon the actual\r\n     intimation to be given to the Khedive and the Sultan respectively,\r\n     the argument leading up to those communications cannot in both\r\n     cases be precisely the same. We must lay stress on separate points,\r\n     and the argument derived from the Khedive's application for a\r\n     European Minister must be treated differently by the two Powers,\r\n     as the circumstances were not similar. We should therefore avoid\r\n     identic notes, though we may make a concerted representation.\r\n\r\n     The communication to the Porte had better be indiscreetly\r\n     communicated to the Khedive's agent there, who is an intelligent\r\n     man. It may only result in producing a very heavy payment to the\r\n     Porte. But that, under existing circumstances, will itself be of\r\n     advantage.\r\n\r\n     I suppose that Waddington means to upset the Ottoman Bank\r\n     project as a retort for the failure of Tocqueville's.\r\n\r\n     What does he think of Martino's share in the recent Egyptian\r\n     crisis? Italy is likely to be a plague to all of us.\r\n\r\nIn France there was a violent party, more or less supported by Gambetta,\r\nwhich desired to send some energetic Agent to Egypt who would bully\r\nthe Khedive successfully. Unfortunately, such energetic agents were\r\nextremely likely to quarrel with their British colleagues, whereas M.\r\nWaddington, who was peaceably disposed, wished to appoint quiet and\r\nunobtrusive representatives who would work harmoniously, and implicitly\r\nfollow their instructions. There was, however, some excuse for the men\r\nof action, as a very well-founded suspicion prevailed in Paris that the\r\nRussians, and even the Germans, were busy at Rome inciting the Italians\r\nto make trouble for England and France at Cairo. Moreover, Gambetta and\r\nhis friends believed, probably with reason, that the Khedive would never\r\nhave gone so far in defying England and France if he had not felt that\r\nhe was backed up by other Powers, as well as by Italy.\r\n\r\nMr. Vivian, the British agent in Cairo, who had been summoned to London,\r\nreturned to his post at the end of April bearing a note, the gist of\r\nwhich was, that the two Governments, in view of the iniquities of the\r\nKhedive, 'reserved to themselves an entire liberty of appreciation\r\nand action in defending their interests in Egypt, and in seeking\r\nthe arrangements best calculated to secure the good government and\r\nprosperity of the country.' In other words, the Khedive was warned that\r\nhe had better be careful; but there was, so far, no hint of deposition.\r\n\r\nIn Lord Salisbury's letter to Lord Lyons, enclosing a copy of the above\r\nnote, there is an interesting personal opinion on the question of\r\ngoverning Orientals by Europeans. 'With all these Oriental populations I\r\nsuspect that the _rôle_ of Europeans should in the main be confined to\r\npositions of criticism and control. They can only govern after absolute\r\nconquest, and then expensively. The difficulty of governing without\r\nconquest is, of course, enormously increased when two nationalities have\r\nto be provided for, and two Governments to be consulted.'\r\n\r\nThe period following the return of Mr. Vivian to his post was marked\r\nby a violent and entirely unreasonable campaign against England in the\r\nFrench press, it being thought, for some unknown reason, that France had\r\nbeen abandoned, and M. Waddington took the somewhat unusual course of\r\nsending a message to Lord Salisbury through Mr. Rivers Wilson, instead\r\nof communicating in the ordinary manner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    May 21, 1879.\r\n\r\n     On Monday Rivers Wilson sent me word that he had a message\r\n     to deliver to me from Waddington. Accordingly I asked him to come\r\n     and see me yesterday to deliver it. It was to the effect that\r\n     Waddington was willing and anxious to move the Porte to dethrone\r\n     the Khedive, if England would join in this step. I represented\r\n     that there were three difficulties. The Sultan might not assent:\r\n     if he did, the Khedive might not yield. If the latter did yield,\r\n     the successor might be either feeble or bad, and we should be\r\n     called upon to support him in one case, and replace him in the\r\n     other. To the first objection Wilson replied that Waddington had no\r\n     apprehensions as to the Sultan's consent; to the second he (Wilson)\r\n     and every person who knew Egypt well, did not doubt that the moment\r\n     a Firman was issued, the Khedive would fall; as to the third, he\r\n     could only say that Prince Tewfik was a compendium of the cardinal\r\n     virtues.\r\n\r\n     If Waddington did not communicate his proposal to you, I am\r\n     obliged to consider what possible motive he could have had for\r\n     taking this circuitous route, unless he meant to disavow the offer\r\n     later on. If he says nothing to you about it, it may be worth while\r\n     to sound him.\r\n\r\n     If there were no France in the way, I should be disposed to\r\n     give no reply to the Khedive's note we received by the last mail,\r\n     or at least only to say that since the dismissal of the English\r\n     Minister, the Khedive's finance had become so hopelessly tangled,\r\n     partly owing to his extravagance, partly to the conflict with\r\n     other Powers into which the decree of April 22nd has brought him,\r\n     that we must reserve our judgment with respect to all questions\r\n     of financial control till the position of affairs had become\r\n     more intelligible. I think that on some such plea as that we\r\n     might stand by and look on for a few months till the Khedive\r\n     has knocked himself to pieces, which he inevitably will do. The\r\n     fiscal condition is now so hopeless that I am rather grateful to\r\n     the Khedive for refusing to put it into the hands of an English\r\n     Minister. I doubt whether any European can now undertake it\r\n     without discredit, until the country has gone into liquidation.\r\n     The disproportion between the debt and the revenue--joined to\r\n     the difficulties which have now been raised by the action of the\r\n     courts and the attitude of the other Powers, makes effective or\r\n     even humane government hopeless till there has been a bankruptcy.\r\n     But then that would not suit a purely Bourse policy like that of\r\n     France. We must take notice of this difference of the French view,\r\n     and we may have to modify our policy accordingly; for we cannot\r\n     allow France to go on alone, and we will not part company with her\r\n     if we can possibly help it. But in this state of our relative views\r\n     and wishes, it is already for us to wait, and for her to propose.\r\n     If left alone, our disposition would be to find an excuse for\r\n     waiting, and if we move it will be because France is urging us. We\r\n     should therefore naturally wait till France made a proposal to us,\r\n     and should be inclined to cross-examine her as to what will be\r\n     her next move after that, in the various contingencies which may\r\n     result from the course they propose. I think, however, you might\r\n     open communications by mentioning, quite unofficially, how much\r\n     pain the articles in the _République Française_ and the _Débuts_\r\n     have given us. To ordinary papers we should of course have paid no\r\n     attention; but one of them is, or was till very recently, edited\r\n     by a gentleman in the French Foreign Office; the other is in part\r\n     the property of a Minister. We are utterly unable to understand on\r\n     what foundation the reproaches rest that we have shown reserves\r\n     and hesitations in the pursuit of the joint Egyptian policy. On\r\n     the contrary, if we had occupied towards France the position which\r\n     Servia occupies towards Russia, our compliance could hardly have\r\n     been more exact. But this outbreak of causeless wrath justifies us\r\n     in asking what France wants, and what she complains of.\r\n\r\n     You will of course say as much of this, or as much more as\r\n     you may think wise. But it may be as well to show that we are\r\n     not insensible to this attempt to work Parliament against us\r\n     by revelations or communications on matters which the French\r\n     Government themselves have charged us to treat as confidential.\r\n\r\nThe attacks on England in the French press were not inspired, as Lord\r\nSalisbury supposed, by the French Foreign Office, but by Gambetta, who\r\ndesired a strong policy in Egypt and seized the opportunity to fall upon\r\nWaddington. The latter, however, by this time had made up his mind as to\r\nwhat should be done.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 22, 1879.\r\n\r\n     As you will have seen by my telegram, what Waddington said\r\n     to me yesterday was, that there appeared to him to be only two\r\n     alternatives with regard to the Egyptian question--to depose the\r\n     Khedive or to establish a Control. He talked a good deal more\r\n     about the Control than the deposition; but when I asked him if\r\n     this meant that the Control was the alternative he preferred, he\r\n     declined to express any preference for the one or the other. If we\r\n     are to wait until he has devised measures (and this is what he told\r\n     me he was about) for establishing an efficacious control we need\r\n     not fear being called upon to act in a hurry. I quite agree with\r\n     you that we cannot let France go on alone in Egypt; for if we do,\r\n     she may go lengths which will produce something a great deal more\r\n     dangerous than a mere coolness between us. French power and French\r\n     feeling are very different from what they were some years ago,\r\n     when the French would have let us do almost anything we chose in\r\n     Egypt, if we would have taken care of the interests of the French\r\n     bondholders.\r\n\r\nNothing can be plainer than Lord Salisbury's desire to act in concert\r\nwith France, and to have regard to French interests in Egypt, but the\r\nconstant attacks made upon British policy and the persistent hostility\r\nof French agents, not only in Egypt, but elsewhere, rendered the task\r\nanything but easy. Gambetta's hostility was partly due to the fact that\r\nhe was an enthusiastic Phil-Hellene, and considered that not enough was\r\nbeing done for Greece in the way of procuring for her accessions of\r\nterritory at the expense of Turkey. It is as well to point out that,\r\nwhereas the Turks had been compelled to cede territory to States with\r\nwhich they had been at war, they were at this time being pressed to cede\r\nterritory to Greece because that Power had remained at peace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    June 6, 1879.\r\n\r\n     The recent course of the French newspapers which have the\r\n     credit of being inspired by Gambetta and Léon Say is certainly a\r\n     puzzle. Looking over the course of negotiations between us and\r\n     Waddington on Egypt, I should find it very difficult to say which\r\n     of the two Governments had pulled the other on, and which had\r\n     dragged the other back. As far as any important negotiations go,\r\n     I should say that we had been a shade more in favour of active\r\n     measures than the other side. The two newspapers in question\r\n     are evidently well informed; and therefore their assumption\r\n     that we have prevented the French from acting must be put on\r\n     for a purpose; what purpose it is difficult to say. The most\r\n     obvious solution--bearing in mind the English friendships of the\r\n     two statesmen concerned--is that the whole movement is meant\r\n     to operate on English internal politics, and not on European\r\n     politics at all: and this view is supported by the use which has\r\n     actually been made of the controversy here. The incident is common\r\n     enough in diplomatic history: but it has always been bitterly\r\n     resented by the Government which is the subject of that species\r\n     of attack. But in this case there is some doubt as to how far\r\n     Waddington is implicated. Nothing is more difficult to deal with\r\n     than a 'Marionette Government,' because the marionettes are not\r\n     responsible, and you cannot get at the man who pulls the strings.\r\n     There is one spot in the diplomatic battlefield--almost the only\r\n     one--where we have been exposed to risk, and have consequently\r\n     been anxious--the Balkan Peninsula: and on this we have been\r\n     systematically opposed by France. Ring, Coutouly and Fournier have\r\n     played us every kind of trick. But all the time, nothing could\r\n     have been more unexceptionable than Waddington's language and\r\n     instructions. So it is with this newspaper warfare. The secondary\r\n     agents, who are popularly supposed to act from inspiration are\r\n     undisguisedly hostile. Waddington's demeanour all the time is\r\n     imperturbably friendly. Is it helplessness, or bad faith? The\r\n     question is one of considerable practical importance: for if we are\r\n     to measure the co-operation of France by the action of Fournier and\r\n     Gambetta, we shall do wisely to retire, gently but effectually,\r\n     from a perilous partnership. And it is impossible to ignore this\r\n     aspect of the case in considering the precise line to be pursued in\r\n     the two pending questions of Greece and Egypt.\r\n\r\n     Our object in Egypt, ever since we promised some four years\r\n     ago not to take it, is to see that our own interests are not\r\n     injured and that French interests receive adequate, but not\r\n     excessive consideration. If, however, Gambetta means mischief, it\r\n     may be wise for us to seek the protection of English interests\r\n     only, and leave the French to take care of themselves. This would\r\n     be done by pushing forward the other Powers. Their interference\r\n     would be fatal to Egyptian solvency, and consequently to\r\n     French bondholders. But it would be as fatal a bar to French\r\n     preponderance as the plan of duplicating all appointments, and\r\n     as none of these great Powers are naval, we could look after\r\n     the Canal just as easily if they were masters in Egypt, as\r\n     under the present Anglo-French system. If the French are really\r\n     friends, the Anglo-French system may be maintained in spite of\r\n     many inconveniences in order to cement that friendship. But if\r\n     Gambetta and Fournier are to be taken as the directing force in\r\n     French politics, the Anglo-French system is merely a make-believe,\r\n     and will only draw us into a succession of crises in which we\r\n     shall probably be outwitted. This dilemma merits very careful\r\n     consideration. Greece is a less important and more transitory\r\n     affair. In order to avoid division in the Congress we went rather\r\n     further than we thought quite wise; and we have no wish to go\r\n     further still. Of course, abstractedly, it would be much better\r\n     that all the Hellenic populations should be under a Hellenic ruler.\r\n     But Turkey is still a fact of which account must be taken; and the\r\n     danger of Turkey resisting is very serious. The fact that Greece\r\n     has not won this territory as prize of war, nor earned it as the\r\n     consideration of any service done, but is to gain it merely by her\r\n     skill in singing diplomatic dithyrambics, appears to irritate the\r\n     Turks intensely. It is not our present policy to adopt a course\r\n     which shall induce the Sultan to listen to the Russian proposals\r\n     which are so freely placed before him. We would not therefore,\r\n     in any case, take a leading part in pressing the cession on him.\r\n     But we doubt extremely the wisdom of exciting anew the Moslem\r\n     fanaticism, by demanding a town to which the Albanians attach so\r\n     much importance as Janina. However, in this question we should\r\n     have been a good deal influenced by the wishes of France, if we\r\n     could have thought that by exalting the influence of Fournier we\r\n     were strengthening a friend. But can we do so?\r\n\r\nThere was, in reality, no foundation for Lord Salisbury's suspicions\r\nthat Gambetta and his allies were seeking to interfere in British\r\ninternal politics. The objectionable articles were written under an\r\nerroneous impression that France had been outwitted, and that Mr.\r\nVivian, in pursuance of secret instructions from his Government, was\r\nworking for the failure of the joint Anglo-French administration in\r\nEgypt and for the establishment of exclusive British influence. But as\r\nthe attacks in the French press mainly took the form of abusing England\r\nfor not agreeing to energetic proposals made by the French Government,\r\nit was a legitimate grievance against M. Waddington that he never took\r\nany steps whatever to contradict this perfectly baseless accusation.\r\nAs for the conduct of French agents who were continually intriguing\r\nagainst their English colleagues, it is probable that M. Waddington was\r\nable to exercise little or no control over them, and it has already\r\nbeen mentioned that some of them were in the habit of corresponding\r\ndirectly with Gambetta behind the back of their official chief. Lord\r\nLyons, who naturally was anxious to make things as easy for the French\r\nas possible, recommended that the vanity and susceptibility of French\r\ndiplomatists abroad and of the public at home, should be studied as\r\nmuch as possible, since there was a universal feeling that France was\r\nnow too strong to play a secondary part anywhere, and that sacrifices\r\non our part were preferable to allowing her to throw herself into the\r\narms of Russia. Lord Salisbury therefore persevered in the difficult\r\ntask of endeavouring to co-operate cordially with the French Government,\r\nand M. Waddington applied himself to elaborating the scheme of Dual\r\nControl which was eventually adopted. Meanwhile it had become apparent\r\nthat, in order to obtain anything like a successful result, the Khedive\r\nIsmail must be got rid of somehow, a course which was urged not only by\r\nGambetta, but by the French Agent at Cairo. Joint efforts were made by\r\nthe French and British Agents to induce him to abdicate in favour of\r\nPrince Tewfik, which were seconded by the representations of Germany\r\nand Austria; but these were of no avail, and the Gordian knot was\r\nnot cut until the Sultan suddenly intervened on June 26. On that day\r\na telegram arrived from Constantinople, deposing Ismail by Imperial\r\nIradé, and conferring the Government of Egypt upon his eldest son Prince\r\nTewfik, who was at once proclaimed Khedive without any disturbance of\r\ntranquillity.\r\n\r\nThe action of the Sultan was not only sudden but unexpected, and Lord\r\nSalisbury at once took steps to assure the French Government that it was\r\nnot due to the instigation of Her Majesty's Government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    June 26, 1879.\r\n\r\n     Pray assure M. Waddington that the Turkish move reported\r\n     to-day does not proceed in any way from our suggestion. We have\r\n     only urged in the very strongest terms that the Sultan should not\r\n     interfere with what we were doing in Cairo. But the Sultan seems to\r\n     have been perfectly resolved to have a finger in the pie; and as he\r\n     was not allowed to interfere to save the Khedive, he indemnified\r\n     himself by interfering to upset him.\r\n\r\n     I am not specially in love with the Firman of 1873, which\r\n     I see the Sultan has revoked. But I am afraid it will annoy\r\n     Waddington, and therefore I am anxious he should be well convinced\r\n     we had no hand in it.\r\n\r\n     Now it is done, the wisest course we can take is to accept it,\r\n     and devote our energies to procuring any new Firman that may be\r\n     necessary to the present state of Egyptian finances. I don't think\r\n     it will be any great evil if their power of raising armaments is\r\n     limited. But on all this I should like to have Waddington's opinion.\r\n\r\nM. Waddington was a sensible man, and therefore there was no difficulty\r\nin convincing him that England was not responsible for the Sultan's\r\naction; but French opinion generally was incredulous, and it was\r\nbelieved that the deposition of Ismail was the result of the rivalry at\r\nConstantinople between the French and British Ambassadors. The latter\r\nwas unjustly suspected of a desire to reduce Egypt to the condition\r\nof a Turkish Pashalic, and it was obvious that the revocation of the\r\nFirman indicated the intention of the Sultan to reassert his influence\r\nover Egypt in a manner which French policy had consistently opposed.\r\nAlthough, therefore, the Sultan's action had delivered both England\r\nand France from a highly embarrassing situation, and had been taken\r\nat a most opportune moment, it was considered advisable, instead of\r\nexpressing gratitude, to criticise adversely the form of the Imperial\r\nIradé, and to insist upon the issue of another.\r\n\r\nWhat was, however, of really more essential importance than the somewhat\r\nremote fear of Turkish interference was the question of how the Dual\r\nControl was to be effectively established.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    July 7, 1879.\r\n\r\n     Our perplexity as to the effect of the Firman has received\r\n     a rather comical solution. No such Firman exists. An 'Iradé' is\r\n     merely the Sultan's signature; and that was only given to the\r\n     telegraphic message deposing Ismail. So that the revocation of the\r\n     Firman of 1873 has not taken place, and the discussion as to the\r\n     exact meaning of such a revocation seems to be premature. All that\r\n     we now have to do is to prevent, if we can, any Firman at all being\r\n     issued to Tewfik, and then every one will be happy.\r\n\r\n     Tewfik is resolved to begin the Liquidation at once; and if\r\n     it be true that interest is rolling up at the rate of £80,000 a\r\n     month, there is good cause for his desire to hurry it. But the\r\n     Controllers will hardly be enough. We want to have some hold over\r\n     the government of Egypt, though we do not want to assume any\r\n     overt responsibility. The great object seems to me to be to have\r\n     representatives inside the offices who shall be able to report\r\n     what the Government are doing to the Agents, and shall be able to\r\n     give advice to the Government in accordance with the instructions\r\n     of the Agents. If you have a European Minister, the Agent must\r\n     be suppressed. I despair of making two talented Englishmen work\r\n     side by side, without subordinating one to the other; and if we\r\n     must choose between Agent and Minister as a vehicle of English\r\n     influence, the former seems to me the easier to work with. He is\r\n     not quasi-independent, and therefore will obey orders. He occupies\r\n     a recognized and traditional position and therefore excites no\r\n     jealousy either among Moslems or other Christian Powers; and he\r\n     cannot be dismissed; and if his advice is not taken, or applied\r\n     badly, the country he serves is not in the eyes of the world\r\n     primarily responsible. The case on the other side is that the\r\n     European Minister has more power. But has he? What power did Wilson\r\n     enjoy? The only power Europeans can enjoy at Cairo rests on the\r\n     fear which their Governments may happen to inspire, and this fear\r\n     will operate as strongly through an Agent as through a Minister.\r\n     We do not put European Ministers even into the Governments of\r\n     dependent Indian Provinces: and there we have, what we cannot have\r\n     in Egypt for a long time, 'bayonets to sit upon.'\r\n\r\n     We have made the mistake in Egypt and elsewhere, of\r\n     underrating the vitality of the Moslem feeling. I am afraid M.\r\n     Waddington is doing so with respect to Greece.\r\n\r\nAnother letter deals further with the question of Control, and contains\r\nsome interesting reflections on moral influence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    July 15, 1879.\r\n\r\n     I am very much of the opinion that the Control should take\r\n     the form of inspection. It is the only form of Control likely to\r\n     be effective. Actual authority we cannot exercise. We tried to do\r\n     it through the European Ministers, but when the stress came, the\r\n     disbanded officers proved to us that two pairs of arms are not much\r\n     use against two thousand. The only form of Control we have is that\r\n     which is called moral influence--which in practice is a combination\r\n     of menace, objurgation, and worry. In this we are still supreme\r\n     and have many modes of applying it--diplomatic notes, consular\r\n     interviews, newspapers, blue books. We must devote ourselves to the\r\n     perfecting of this weapon. And, obviously, the first condition of\r\n     its use is complete knowledge of what is going in.\r\n\r\n     The exchange, therefore, of nominal authority for real\r\n     inspectionship is a step in the right direction. It is facing\r\n     facts. We must exert ourselves to open to these inspectors every\r\n     avenue of information; and we must have a certain number of\r\n     sub-inspectors paid by Egypt, who shall travel about, collecting\r\n     information. It is essential, of course, that these last should\r\n     know the language.\r\n\r\n     The division of the jurisdiction of the two inspectors is\r\n     a serious puzzle. Upper and Lower Egypt certainly will not do,\r\n     unless we have Lower Egypt. I had thought of a North and South\r\n     division--the Nile--starting at Damietta. But I know Vivian does\r\n     not like this; moreover I see difficulties about handing over\r\n     Alexandria to the French.\r\n\r\n     Waddington's proposal for a rotatory jurisdiction sounds odd.\r\n     What would he think of it as applied to any other department of\r\n     life--Ambassadors, Bishops, or Ministers? I suppose the frequency\r\n     of what they call a 'Prefectoral Movement' in France has put it\r\n     into his head.\r\n\r\n     Would it be possible to fuse them into a board, giving them\r\n     a native colleague to be chosen by themselves, and then decide\r\n     by majority? I have spoken to Baring[25] about the Commission of\r\n     Liquidation. I doubt his accepting the Control, though I think he\r\n     would the Liquidation.\r\n\r\n     As to the Firman, we are agreed as to the limitation of\r\n     armaments. I should be glad to see loans forbidden altogether.\r\n     To an Oriental ruler they are like firewater to the Red Indians.\r\n     I should be glad to see a declaration that the Powers would not\r\n     recognize or encourage the payment of any loan contracted by the\r\n     Egyptian Government after this date. They are not wanted to meet\r\n     any present stress; but the fellaheen are already loaded with quite\r\n     as heavy a weight as they can bear.\r\n\r\nThe question of appointing the Controllers and deciding what their\r\nfunctions were to be, gave rise to more difficulties, caused by the\r\nobvious desire of many Frenchmen to get the Egyptian finances entirely\r\ninto French hands. Ultimately Major Baring and M. de Blignières\r\nwere appointed, but their powers were not formally defined until\r\nNovember. By the decree of November 15, 1879, it was laid down that\r\nthe Controllers should have full rights of inquiring into all branches\r\nof the administration; the rank of Ministers and seats in the Cabinet,\r\nalthough restricted to making suggestions; the power of appointing and\r\ndismissing subordinate officials; and it was further enacted that they\r\nwere irremovable without the consent of their respective Governments. By\r\nthis action the British and the French Governments practically assumed\r\nthe responsibility of Government, and for some time to come Egypt ceased\r\nto give trouble.\r\n\r\nIn the month of June, 1879, an event had occurred which was of profound\r\nimportance to all political parties in France. The Prince Imperial\r\nhad perished in Zululand, and with him had vanished the hopes of a\r\nresuscitated Empire. The tragedy of the Prince's death is heightened\r\nby the fact that it was only owing to an unfortunate misunderstanding\r\nthat he was ever allowed to accompany the expedition. On March 1,\r\nLord Salisbury writing to Lord Lyons stated that the departure of the\r\nPrince Imperial was: _'a mal entendu_ which we are unable to understand\r\neven here. The Government had very distinctly negatived it, but in\r\nconsequence of some misapprehensions, our orders were not attended to\r\nby the military men, and he received encouragement which could not\r\nafterwards be withdrawn. If you think Waddington is at all sore on the\r\nmatter, you are authorized to explain this fully to him. But I rather\r\nexpect to hear from you that no importance is attached by the French\r\nGovernment to what has taken place.'\r\n\r\nTwo days later he again wrote:--\r\n\r\n     I am very sorry to hear that so painful an impression was\r\n     created in Paris. We have never been able to discover exactly\r\n     how it was done, or why our already clearly expressed objection\r\n     was disregarded. He was of course at liberty to go, and people\r\n     who ought to have known better were at liberty to write private\r\n     letters and go to railway stations. Of course nothing official has\r\n     been done, but the border line between official and private has\r\n     been very closely trenched upon. However, all we can do now is to\r\n     express our sincere regret.\r\n\r\nAt Lord Lyons's next interview with M. Waddington, the latter asked (not\r\nin a complaining manner) how the Prince's expedition to Zululand had\r\nbeen brought about, and was told in reply that the Prince had settled it\r\nhimself through personal friends and that Her Majesty's Government had\r\nby no means approved of it. President Grévy alluded to the matter in the\r\ncourse of a conversation with the Prince of Wales, who happened to be in\r\nParis, and also expressed no disapproval; in fact, he went so far as to\r\nremark: _qu'il avait très bien fait_. Thus the principal personages in\r\nFrance evidently did not consider the matter of much importance; but,\r\non the other hand, the Republican press showed considerable irritation,\r\nwhich, under the circumstances, was perhaps not entirely unnatural, as\r\nit did not seem credible that the Prince could have started without the\r\napproval of the British Government. When the news of his death arrived,\r\nit was felt that, for the time being at all events, Bonapartism had been\r\npractically crushed out of existence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, June 20, 1879.\r\n\r\n     In hearing of the sad end of the short life of the Prince\r\n     Imperial, one's first thought is for the Empress, whose bitter cup\r\n     of sorrows is now full.\r\n\r\n     The immediate political result is the utter disorganization\r\n     of the Imperial Party. It was far from strong, but still it was\r\n     the most efficacious element of opposition to the Republicans, and\r\n     they will now have things still more their own way. The Fleurys,\r\n     Rouhers, and the old Imperial following can never hope to live to\r\n     recover from the blow. I suppose Prince Napoleon will hardly put\r\n     himself forward in the position of a pretender to the Imperial\r\n     Crown, and he would have no party with him if he did. In the\r\n     more remote future his eldest son may prove a more formidable\r\n     candidate than poor Prince Louis could have been. He is said to be\r\n     a remarkably clever, attractive youth, and a thorough Bonaparte\r\n     in appearance. No hereditary responsibility for Sedan can be cast\r\n     upon him; he is undoubtedly of the Bonaparte race, and he has been\r\n     brought up in France. For the present, however, Prince Louis's\r\n     melancholy death is a decided accession to Republican strength.\r\n\r\nThe death of the Prince excited the sympathies of all classes in France\r\nwith the stricken Empress, but when in July, preparations were being\r\nmade for the funeral in England, the bitterness of French party politics\r\ndisplayed itself in that hostility which, carried beyond the grave, it\r\nis the least possible to condone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 10, 1879.\r\n\r\n     The susceptibility the French Government is showing about\r\n     the funeral of the Prince Imperial is neither wise nor dignified.\r\n     If ever there was an occasion on which political animosities\r\n     might be left in abeyance, surely this is one. The death of the\r\n     Prince Imperial has put an end to many hopes and aspirations,\r\n     and has inclined numerous adherents of the family to acquiesce\r\n     in the present state of things. It is certainly not politic to\r\n     require of people in this frame of mind an overt manifestation\r\n     of heartlessness and ingratitude to the dynasty which has had so\r\n     mournful an end. The ceremony so manifestly relates to the past\r\n     and not to the future that there can be no reasonable objection\r\n     to allowing the old adherents of the family, whether Marshals and\r\n     Generals, or merely civilians to go over to attend it. I fancy\r\n     that Grévy himself and the Republicans _de la vieille_ cannot get\r\n     over, even on such an occasion as this, their old hostility to the\r\n     Empire.\r\n\r\nThese almost incredibly vindictive feelings again manifested themselves\r\nwhen a proposal was made that a monument to the unfortunate Prince\r\nshould be placed in Westminster Abbey. M. Waddington, who must have\r\nbeen heartily ashamed of the part he was forced to play, remonstrated\r\nprivately against the project, and intimated to Lord Lyons that he\r\nthought of writing to Dean Stanley, whom he happened to know, and of\r\nurging him not to consent to it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    July 22, 1879.\r\n\r\n     I think, on the whole, I had better not answer your despatch\r\n     officially about the Prince Imperial's statue; but you can tell\r\n     Waddington unofficially as much of the following as you may\r\n     think useful. As soon as I got it, I communicated with the Prime\r\n     Minister, who sent to the Dean of Westminster. The Dean, when the\r\n     message reached him, had already forwarded to all the newspapers\r\n     a letter which you have read in the issues of this morning. On\r\n     reading it we came to the conclusion that the matter had gone too\r\n     far to be recalled.\r\n\r\n     On historical considerations the Dean proposes to put the\r\n     monument into Henry the Seventh's chapel, and for that purpose,\r\n     undoubtedly, the Queen's permission must be obtained. But as\r\n     regards the Abbey in general he is absolutely supreme. He might\r\n     put up a statue of Nana Sahib, if he chose. So we must decline to\r\n     accept any responsibility for his proceedings. As he has publicly\r\n     made the announcement that it is his intention, if not interfered\r\n     with, to give the requisite permission, it is clearly impossible\r\n     for us to 'apply pressure' to induce him to give way. The motive\r\n     for doing so would have to be confessed and would cause much\r\n     misapprehension.\r\n\r\n     I have expressed a wish to see the inscription before it is\r\n     put up, and I have no doubt I shall be allowed to do so. I think I\r\n     can assure M. Waddington that there is not the slightest danger of\r\n     anything about Napoleon IV. being contained in it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe monument was never erected, the project meeting with much opposition\r\nin Parliament as calculated to offend the susceptibilities of the French\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the circumstances surrounding the death of this\r\nunfortunate Prince reflect discredit, though in an unequal degree, upon\r\nboth the French and the British Governments. If the French Government\r\nshowed a petty and vindictive spirit totally unworthy of a great and\r\npowerful nation, the misunderstanding which enabled the Prince to go\r\nto South Africa; his vague and indefinite status with respect to the\r\nexpeditionary force; the equally vague conditions attaching to his\r\nrelations with Captain Carey, which were partly responsible for his\r\ndeath; the unhappy suggestion of the Abbey monument; the helpless\r\nattitude of the Government in the face of an enterprising ecclesiastic;\r\nand the subsequent unseemly discussion in the House of Commons, are\r\neloquent of slipshod and careless methods which are discreditable to\r\nBritish administration and constitute a somewhat humiliating page in the\r\nnational history.\r\n\r\nThe autumn of 1879 was marked by the conclusion of the Austro-German\r\nalliance, hailed at the time by Lord Salisbury as 'glad tidings of\r\ngreat joy,' and destined profoundly to influence European politics for\r\nmany years to come. In spite of assurances given by Bismarck himself,\r\nby Andrassy, and by Haymerle, this new grouping of two first-class\r\nmilitary Powers caused much perturbation at Paris, which was certainly\r\nnot allayed by Lord Salisbury's benediction, and provided convenient\r\nmaterial for an attack upon the tottering Waddington administration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Nov. 14, 1879.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     As to French internal politics, the most striking feature is\r\n     the somewhat vague but almost universal feeling of uneasiness about\r\n     the future which pervades France. It is impossible not to see that\r\n     this feeling has increased even during the few weeks that have\r\n     elapsed since I went away on leave in August. I suppose that the\r\n     immediate fear is that the Waddington Ministry will be succeeded by\r\n     one more Radical, and that thus, step by step, the Ultra-Reds will\r\n     get the Government into their hands.\r\n\r\n     When I first saw Waddington on my return, he was in good\r\n     spirits, thinking that the threatened attacks upon him about\r\n     the amnesty, the Government, and especially the diplomatic\r\n     appointments, had blown over. Now, however, he is menaced with\r\n     an interpellation on the Austro-German understanding. This\r\n     understanding is, of course, extremely unpalatable to the French,\r\n     and among them the general belief is that it binds Austria to\r\n     assist Germany, in case of need, to defend Alsace and Lorraine\r\n     against France. Waddington has the most positive assurances from\r\n     Bismarck, Andrassy and Haymerle that there is nothing against\r\n     France in it, but this is not enough to reassure the cavillers.\r\n     The intention seems to be to reproach Waddington with this\r\n     understanding generally, as indicating the failure of his Foreign\r\n     Policy, and in particular to blame him for having an Ambassador at\r\n     Vienna who neither prevented, nor found it out, and an Ambassador\r\n     in London who did not make the French policy on the subject\r\n     properly understood by the English Government. It seems that\r\n     it is intended to argue that you would not have spoken of the\r\n     understanding in the terms you used at Manchester, if you had\r\n     known the painful impression it had made in France.\r\n\r\n     There are two opinions in France on the Foreign Policy to be\r\n     now adopted. Perhaps the general, unreflecting public are inclined\r\n     to throw themselves into the arms of Russia. The wise heads (and\r\n     there is some reason to hope that Gambetta may be among them) look\r\n     rather to England, and are willing to conciliate her by supporting\r\n     her views in the East. It may be worth while to take this feeling\r\n     into account, and perhaps with that view rather to put forward the\r\n     reinstatement of Khaireddin and Midhat as the objects in view, than\r\n     exclusively English appointments.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a more or less established rule that when an English\r\nForeign Secretary makes a speech, Ambassadors should write and expatiate\r\nupon the admirable effect which has been produced abroad, and Lord\r\nLyons's comment upon Lord Salisbury's Manchester speech approaches more\r\nnearly to criticism than appears elsewhere in his correspondence. The\r\ncharge of ignorance brought against the French Ambassador at Vienna\r\nwas probably quite correct, but the British Embassy at Vienna must\r\nhave been in the same case, for the existence of the Austro-German\r\nalliance was first discovered by that extremely able public servant,\r\nthe late Sir Joseph Crowe, K.C.M.G.[26] As for the alleged inaction of\r\nthe French Ambassador at London, that official was a retired admiral,\r\nwhom apparently Waddington seldom seems to have consulted, and over\r\nwhose unconscious head business was habitually transacted by the French\r\nForeign Office.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Nov. 21, 1879.\r\n\r\n     We are within a week of the opening of the session, but the\r\n     situation has not become more clear. Gambetta and Waddington have\r\n     a personal dislike to each other, and no doubt Gambetta would be\r\n     glad to oust Waddington, and to put in his place some new Minister\r\n     for Foreign Affairs, such as the Marquis de Noailles, with some\r\n     creature of his own, such as Spüller as adlatus or Under Secretary\r\n     of State. But then Gambetta would find it difficult to do this\r\n     without bringing about such a break up of the Ministry as would\r\n     raise the question of his own taking office. But if those who ought\r\n     to know him well judge aright, he does not wish to come into power\r\n     until he sees his way to doing something very great--in fact to\r\n     getting back Alsace and Lorraine.\r\n\r\n     Gambetta professes to be strongly in favour of the English\r\n     Alliance, and for that and for other reasons, to make a liberal\r\n     treaty of commerce with us. I do not, however, imagine that his\r\n     ideas of a liberal treaty go beyond maintaining, or nearly so, the\r\n     tariffs as they stand in the existing Anglo-French Treaties.\r\n\r\n     I imagine he has thought of going to England himself whenever\r\n     he has a good opportunity, not with a view to putting himself into\r\n     the hands of Sir Charles Dilke and taking part in any Ultra-Radical\r\n     demonstration, but rather with a desire of conciliating the\r\n     moderate public opinion in England, and showing that he has no\r\n     desire to promote a Republican Propaganda abroad. He seems to have\r\n     a decidedly friendly feeling towards the present English Ministry.\r\n\r\n     I have heard that the Russian Grand Dukes had been led by\r\n     General Chanzy to expect a much more warm and cordial reception at\r\n     Paris than they actually met with, and that consequently they were\r\n     by no means pleased.\r\n\r\n     Waddington seems to be as little prepared to go into the\r\n     Newfoundland question as he was two months ago. The impression\r\n     he makes upon me is the same that he made upon you. The Navy\r\n     Department keep him in awe of them and prevent his acting upon the\r\n     reasonable views he expressed to you at Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe various difficulties in all parts of the world which were before\r\nlong to trouble Anglo-French relations for many years, had now\r\nbegun to manifest themselves in such places as Newfoundland, Tahiti,\r\nRéunion, the Gambia, and elsewhere. All these troublesome questions\r\nfell under the Marine Department, and their accumulation was productive\r\nof an irritation which hampered M. Waddington, whose position was\r\nalso weakened by a rabid demand made upon the Ministry for Government\r\nappointments. In fact it was difficult to see how any French Ministry\r\ncould last, if the American system of a fresh division of the spoils\r\nwas to take place whenever a change occurred. In America the Executive\r\nis safe for four years, but in France, directly the places had been\r\ndistributed, the disappointed combined to overthrow the unhappy\r\nMinisters responsible for the distribution.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his most formidable opponent, the ex-Democrat, Gambetta, had\r\nassumed the _rôle_ of a grand seigneur, and gave sumptuous Parliamentary\r\nbanquets which were pronounced by the highest gastronomic authorities to\r\nbe exquisite in every respect. He contemplated a visit to London, and it\r\nis somewhat surprising to learn that the Democrat showed a very obvious\r\nprepossession in favour of the English Conservative Party.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Dec. 12, 1879.\r\n\r\n     Gambetta has heard with very great satisfaction that you and\r\n     Lord Beaconsfield would be very glad of the opportunity of seeing\r\n     him, which will be afforded if he carries into effect his idea\r\n     of going to England. He feels that it would be essential that\r\n     he should not make himself the guest or place himself under the\r\n     special guidance of any political person on one side or the other.\r\n     He would probably go to an hotel. As to the time of his visit,\r\n     he does not seem to have formed any definite plan. It seems to be\r\n     connected in his mind with the Treaty of Commerce, and he seems\r\n     inclined to secure himself a good reception by contributing first\r\n     to making a favourable Treaty of Commerce. I suppose he and his\r\n     countrymen would consider a Treaty simply renewing the arrangements\r\n     of 1860 as very favourable to us. He absolutely repudiates all\r\n     notion of anything like Republican propagandism. He has a strong\r\n     bias in favour of the Conservatives in England. His sympathies are\r\n     with an active Foreign Policy, and he has a grudge against the\r\n     Liberals because they did not come to the assistance of France in\r\n     the Franco-German war. He seems to follow English home politics\r\n     very carefully. He wishes England and France to act together in\r\n     the East, but considers that things have got into a horrid mess at\r\n     Constantinople, and expresses regret that the French and English\r\n     Embassies there do not pull more together.\r\n\r\n     I think one of his objects in going to England would be to\r\n     show people in France that he is considered a person of sufficient\r\n     importance to be admitted into the society of people of rank and\r\n     station in aristocratic England.\r\n\r\n     He has also no doubt the higher object of making France and\r\n     himself popular in England, so as to avert all risk of England's\r\n     joining the Austro-German Alliance to the detriment of France.\r\n\r\n     The danger would be that he would form too great expectations\r\n     of obtaining a positive alliance with England, and that if we did\r\n     not come up to his expectations in this respect, he might in his\r\n     disappointment, turn to Russia. But from this point of view, the\r\n     most dangerous thing would be to _froisser_ his susceptibility by\r\n     showing any coldness beforehand about his visit.\r\n\r\n     He undertakes to let us know whenever he comes to any\r\n     resolution about going to England.\r\n\r\nFrom the above letter it will be seen how much importance was attached\r\nto Gambetta's views, and how desirable it was considered to secure his\r\ngoodwill; but apparently the visit to London from which so much was\r\nexpected, never took place--perhaps because his English Conservative\r\nfriends were shortly afterwards turned out of office.\r\n\r\nThe threatened attack upon the Waddington administration took the\r\nform of a vote of want of confidence which was moved in the month of\r\nDecember, but successfully rejected. The Ministerial success, however,\r\nwas of a somewhat fictitious nature, as the Left Groups when united,\r\noutnumbered the Right, and the Government was, therefore, liable\r\nto be turned out by a combination. M. Waddington himself professed\r\nsatisfaction, and affirmed with pride that he had been congratulated\r\nupon his majority by the British Government; while from Berlin, Vienna,\r\nand even from St. Petersburg, where he was not in favour, assurances had\r\nbeen received of the satisfaction felt at the prospect of his continuing\r\nin office. The result, too, of the vote enabled him to carry out an\r\nintention he had long had in his mind, of abandoning the Presidency of\r\nthe Council, and of retaining the office of Minister of Foreign Affairs.\r\nHis own wish was to see M. Léon Say Prime Minister, but as that was out\r\nof the question, he favoured the appointment of M. de Freycinet, who, in\r\naddition to other qualifications, possessed the confidence of Gambetta,\r\nand would therefore render it difficult for the latter to attack the\r\nGovernment. The proposed transformation of the Ministry, however, was\r\nfound difficult to effect, chiefly owing to the animosity of Gambetta\r\nagainst Waddington; the former being credited with the intention of\r\nupsetting any Ministry in which the latter remained. Gambetta was in\r\nfact pursuing a systematic dog-in-the-manger policy which was little\r\nto his credit, for while continually attacking and threatening the\r\nGovernment he was unwilling to take office himself, with the Chamber\r\nthen in existence, since he realized that the Ultra-Radicals were trying\r\nto force him into a position in which he would have either to accept\r\nresponsibility or to abandon the leadership of the Republican Party.\r\nThe object, in short, of Clémenceau and the extreme party was to use\r\nGambetta up in order to make room eventually for themselves. Neither\r\nPresident Grévy or Freycinet showed any accommodating spirit with\r\nregard to Waddington's plans, and when Freycinet laid down conditions\r\nwhich were unacceptable, the President tried to persuade Waddington to\r\nremain on as Prime Minister; but Waddington's position had been further\r\nimpaired by imprudent representation on the part of President Grévy\r\nand others, that he was highly acceptable to Bismarck as a Minister,\r\nand Waddington admitted openly himself that he was wanting in the\r\nqualifications of a French Parliamentary leader. Consequently the upshot\r\nof it all was that he resigned, and Freycinet was allowed to form a new\r\nadministration on his own terms. 'I part with Waddington with great\r\nregret,' wrote Lord Lyons. 'He had the greatest of all recommendations,\r\nthat you could believe him, and feel sure of him.' These regrets were\r\nshared by Lord Salisbury. 'I am very sorry for the loss of Waddington.\r\nIt was a luxury to have a French Minister who worked on principles\r\nintelligible to the English mind.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Dec. 30, 1879.\r\n\r\n     With the new Ministry I suppose Gambetta's reign is to begin.\r\n     The Cabinet was almost ostensibly formed by him. He did not, and\r\n     probably could not, put in any of the chief men of his own party.\r\n     They are kept, or keep themselves, in reserve to come into power\r\n     with Gambetta himself. The present Ministers are personally to a\r\n     certain extent Moderate, and altogether, so far as they are known,\r\n     mediocre. Freycinet is said to have some inclination to assert\r\n     independence, but he has not hitherto rebelled against his old\r\n     master Gambetta.\r\n\r\n     The man who appears to have lost most reputation in the affair\r\n     is President Grévy. He knows well enough that it is Gambetta's\r\n     intention to supplant him, but he has allowed himself to be\r\n     circumvented with his eyes open, from lack of resolution and lack\r\n     of energy, and has apparently let his rival obtain complete control\r\n     of the Government.\r\n\r\n     I do not suppose that we shall see at present any marked\r\n     change in the Foreign Policy of the French Government. Freycinet\r\n     knows nothing whatever of Foreign Affairs. Gambetta has strong\r\n     general notions, but seems more inclined to insist upon disposing\r\n     of the patronage of the Foreign Office than to go into the details\r\n     of the business. At home I suppose the first measure will be a\r\n     wholesale redistribution of places. _Aux situations nouvelles,\r\n     il faut des hommes nouveaux_, was the principle proclaimed by\r\n     Clémenceau. Beust[27] turns the phrase round and says: _Aux hommes\r\n     nouveaux il faut des situations._\r\n\r\n     At all events the centre Gauche is dead, and with it the\r\n     Thiers' policy, which was to preserve as far as possible the\r\n     institutions, the laws and the administrative system in France,\r\n     with the simple change of having an elective President, instead\r\n     of an hereditary sovereign at the head. The policy could not last\r\n     long unless it was directed by a really able energetic President.\r\n     France is now about to try real democratic and republican\r\n     government, and it will be a dangerous experiment in a country like\r\n     this. It would be a still more dangerous experiment if the old\r\n     warlike spirit had survived in the people. Happily for peace, they\r\n     are more intent upon making and enjoying money than upon obtaining\r\n     military glory, or even upon recovering their lost provinces.\r\n     Gambetta will try for the recovery of the Provinces if he preserves\r\n     his energies and fortune seems to give him a chance.\r\n\r\n     I have just seen Pothuau[28] who seems very indignant at his\r\n     place in London having been offered to Waddington, and declares\r\n     that he has no intention of giving it up.\r\n\r\nLord Lyons was destined to witness many more changes of Government in\r\nFrance before his final departure; most of them accurately described by\r\nthe hackneyed phrase: _Plus cela change, plus c'est la même chose._\r\n\r\nA letter from Major Baring written at the close of the year is worth\r\nquoting as evidence of the improved and hopeful condition of Egypt,\r\nand also of the harmony prevailing at the time between the English and\r\nFrench Controllers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Major Baring to Lord Lyons_.\r\n\r\n    Cairo, Dec. 29, 1879.\r\n\r\n     You may like to hear what I think of the state of things here,\r\n     so I venture to write this line.\r\n\r\n     There is a very decided improvement. Since I have been\r\n     connected with Egyptian affairs I never remember matters going so\r\n     smoothly. I like what I see of the Khedive, and I see a great deal\r\n     of him, for he frequently presides at the Council, and besides this\r\n     I often go to see him on business. Riaz's head is rather turned by\r\n     the decorations he has received, but he is very well disposed and\r\n     will always follow our advice, if we insist. He is oppressed with\r\n     the fear that Nubar will return to office; as, without doubt, he\r\n     will sooner or later; but it is not at all to be desired that he\r\n     should return just yet. What we want is _time_. If we can get along\r\n     for six months, or better, a year, without any considerable change\r\n     I really believe that the financial crisis which has now lasted so\r\n     long may be brought to a close.\r\n\r\n     Cherif and the Turks made overtures to Nubar the other day,\r\n     but he was wise enough to decline so unnatural a coalition.\r\n\r\n     Before long our financial scheme will be ready to launch, and\r\n     if, as I hope, it is accepted, the Commission of Liquidation will\r\n     no longer be necessary. This is perhaps the best solution of the\r\n     matter.\r\n\r\n     We shall reduce Unified to 4 per cent, and leave Preference\r\n     alone.\r\n\r\n     Blignières is behaving most loyally in everything which\r\n     concerns English interests. The Khedive and his Ministers have, I\r\n     think, got over the prejudice they entertained against him.\r\n\r\nM. de Freycinet took over the Foreign Office as well as the Presidency\r\nof the Council; as has already been stated, he was quite ignorant of\r\nall foreign questions, and was also looked upon as less reliable than\r\nM. Waddington. The first official interview with him, however, produced\r\na favourable impression, all the more because he did not let out a\r\nflood of common-places about devotion to England, and so forth; but the\r\nimportant question was to know what line Gambetta was inclined to take\r\nin Foreign Policy, and Sheffield was deputed to find out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Jan. 17, 1880.\r\n\r\n     Gambetta has expressed confidentially to Sheffield to-day his\r\n     views as to the Foreign Policy of France; with the intention of\r\n     course that they should be communicated to me only in the strictest\r\n     privacy.\r\n\r\n     He considered that the Austro-German Alliance had been made\r\n     against France; that it entered into Prince Bismarck's calculations\r\n     that it might throw France into the arms of Russia, but that His\r\n     Highness thought that there would be more than a compensation for\r\n     this if in consequence of it England were completely detached from\r\n     France. Gambetta declared that France had not fallen into this trap\r\n     and would not fall into it--that she would never make an alliance\r\n     with Russia, but that if Russia were attacked by Germany, France\r\n     would have to take care of her own safety. He had information which\r\n     convinced him that there was no foundation for the assertions that\r\n     Russian troops were being massed on the frontier of Germany, and\r\n     he believed that these rumours were spread from Berlin to afford a\r\n     pretext for an attack on Russia, to be made so suddenly as to be\r\n     successful at once and to enable Germany to turn towards France\r\n     without any fear of Russia in her rear.\r\n\r\n     In order to disconcert this plan Gambetta thought it highly\r\n     important that a good understanding should be established between\r\n     England and Russia both with regard to Turkey and to India. He\r\n     held that it was the interest of France to urge in every way the\r\n     Russian Government to come to such an understanding with England.\r\n     He looked upon the state of things at Constantinople as very\r\n     bad, and attributed it to the disagreements between the French\r\n     and English Ambassadors; while in order to promote the accord\r\n     which he wished to see between England and Russia he desired that\r\n     the best feeling should exist between the French and English\r\n     Representatives at Constantinople. It was evident, however, from\r\n     what he said that any complaint against Fournier by England would\r\n     be met by counter-complaints on the part of France against Layard.\r\n     If Fournier resigned, Tissot the French Minister at Athens would be\r\n     Gambetta's candidate for the Embassy in Turkey.\r\n\r\n     Gambetta denied most positively that there was any truth\r\n     whatever in the rumours that he had been in communication with\r\n     Bismarck about the restoration of Lorraine to France or anything\r\n     of the kind. As to the insinuation that it was proposed that\r\n     while Lorraine should be restored, France should receive a slice\r\n     of Belgium in compensation for Alsace, Gambetta said that it\r\n     was plain that this could only have been put about to produce\r\n     ill-will between England and France. After the Benedetti affair, no\r\n     Frenchman in his senses would enter into secret arrangements with\r\n     Bismarck about Belgium, and the French Republic had certainly no\r\n     desire under any circumstances to despoil its neighbours.\r\n\r\n     Gambetta expressed a desire that a liberal Treaty of Commerce\r\n     should be made with England and he was eloquent on the importance\r\n     of a close and cordial union between the two countries.\r\n\r\n     Gambetta impressed upon Sheffield that he was speaking to him\r\n     simply as a friend, and quite privately. I think it is interesting\r\n     and important to know what sentiments he expresses in this way:\r\n     but, of course, if he was quoted, or if what he said was allowed to\r\n     transpire, he would feel bitterly towards us and at once put an end\r\n     to all communications of the kind. His tone appears to have been\r\n     quite that of a man who felt that he would have the power to carry\r\n     into effect the policy he recommended in this country.\r\n\r\n     Freycinet has just been to see me, but I did not find him\r\n     equally communicative on the general Foreign Policy of France.\r\n\r\nAs Freycinet was occupied at that moment, _more Gallico_, in clearing\r\nthe old officials out of the Foreign Office, and as he admittedly\r\npossessed little knowledge himself, his reticence under the\r\ncircumstances was not surprising; but, so far as could be gathered, it\r\nwas the intention of the new Ministry to follow the prudent course of\r\ntheir predecessors, a profession of faith evidently intended especially\r\nfor Berlin. As regards the so-called Eastern Question, interest had\r\ntemporarily shifted from Egypt to Greece, and the various Powers were\r\nendeavouring without much success to negotiate the cession of Turkish\r\nterritory to that country. The usual spring war scare had taken a\r\ndifferent shape, and, without any foundation whatever, Bismarck was\r\ncredited with the extraordinary intention of suddenly falling upon\r\nRussia, while a coolness had sprung up between the French and Russian\r\nGovernments owing to the refusal of the former to surrender the Nihilist\r\nHartmann, who was implicated in an attempt to wreck a train in which the\r\nRussian Emperor was travelling.\r\n\r\nThis refusal annoyed the Emperor so much that he withdrew his\r\nAmbassador, Prince Orloff, from Paris, the French consoling themselves\r\nwith the thought that if they lost the favour of the Russian Emperor\r\nthey would, on the other hand, ingratiate themselves with Bismarck.\r\n\r\nUpon the Greek Frontier question, which in consequence of an English\r\nproposal had been referred to an International Commission, there was,\r\nfor some unknown reason, a disposition to blame the British Government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Sir H. Layard._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 19, 1880.\r\n\r\n     The withdrawal of Orloff, on account of the refusal of the\r\n     French Government to give up Hartmann, is of course the topic of\r\n     the day here. The form adopted is that which was used when normal\r\n     relations between Russia and the Pope were suspended some years\r\n     ago. The Emperor Alexander is, I understand, very angry; but I do\r\n     not know how long this _mouvement d'humeur_ will hold out against\r\n     the obvious political interest which both Russia and France have in\r\n     not being on bad terms with each other. There was a strong feeling\r\n     on the Left of the Chamber against giving Hartmann up, and as to\r\n     foreign relations, I suppose the French set pleasing Bismarck\r\n     against displeasing the European Alexander.\r\n\r\n     Freycinet is decidedly against the admission of Turkey to the\r\n     Greek Frontier Commission. It might have been politic to admit her,\r\n     though I don't see how she could have been asked to engage to be\r\n     bound by the votes of the majority.\r\n\r\n     I think things in the East are indeed looking serious. How\r\n     Turkey is to be kept going, in spite of herself, much longer,\r\n     passes my comprehension. I should be sorry to make a fourth in an\r\n     alliance between France, Russia and Turkey. If France and Russia\r\n     did unite for any serious purpose, I should think the last thing\r\n     they would wish would be to tie such a clog as Turkey to their\r\n     wheels. If there is any truth in the proverb, _Quem deus vult\r\n     perdere si_, etc., I am afraid that there can be very little doubt\r\n     that the ruin of Abdul Hamid is in the hands of Allah.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: French Secretary of Embassy at London.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: French Ambassador at Constantinople.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Sir Charles Rivers Wilson, G.C.M.G.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: H.B.M.

It is worthy of note that\r\nLord Lyons, whom no one could accuse of Jingo tendencies, and whose\r\nopinion was certainly a very much better one than that of most of Lord\r\nLytton's critics, was emphatically in favour of the latter's Afghan\r\npolicy. Writing to Lady Lytton on January 8, 1879, he had expressed\r\nhimself as follows:--\r\n\r\n     I have never had the least misgiving about Lytton's policy\r\n     with regard to Afghanistan, and I was always sure it would be\r\n     wisely carried into execution. I am only too thankful that we\r\n     have a spirited Viceroy. You can hardly form an idea of the\r\n     advantage our reputation has derived, all over Europe, from the\r\n     Afghan campaign, and you have seen enough of diplomacy to know how\r\n     much success in all questions of Foreign Policy depends upon the\r\n     prestige of the country one represents.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Layard had incurred even greater execration than Lord Lytton\r\nin the eyes of the Liberal Party, because he was considered to have\r\nbeen deeply committed to what was described as the Pro-Turkish policy\r\nof the Conservative Government, although his inexpiable offence\r\nseems to have consisted chiefly in strenuous and unavailing efforts\r\nto induce the Turks to put their house in order. During his stay at\r\nConstantinople he had been greatly hampered by the consistent opposition\r\nof his French colleague, M. Fournier, whose great object it appeared\r\nto be to thwart English action whenever opportunity occurred. The\r\nFrench Government, which professed great anxiety to act in harmony with\r\nEngland, upon ascertaining that Sir Henry Layard was to be replaced by\r\nMr. Goschen,[29] withdrew Fournier and appointed M. Tissot in his place.\r\n\r\nA change in the French Embassy in London was also imminent, and the\r\ncircumstances attending the appointment of a new Ambassador were not\r\ndevoid of humour.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Pothuau, the Ambassador under the Waddington régime, had been\r\nforced to retire, probably much against his inclination, and it was\r\nconsidered that M. Léon Say would make an excellent representative, more\r\nespecially as he passed as that _rara avis_, a French Free Trader; but\r\nM. Say shortly after accepting the appointment was elected President\r\nof the Senate, and therefore forced to resign. To find a satisfactory\r\nsuccessor was apparently not so simple a matter as might have been\r\nassumed. Nothing could have been more correct than M. de Freycinet's\r\nideal of a French Ambassador in London: 'a man possessing the full\r\nconfidence and sharing the sentiments of his Government; not so much of\r\na politician as to be thinking more of establishing his own political\r\nposition at home than of following his instructions: a man who would\r\nstay long at the post, and desire to stay there; who would form personal\r\nfriendships with English Statesmen, and improve good relations and\r\nsoften asperities by personal influence. A man calculated to take a part\r\nin a society like that of London, and who would not be out of place at a\r\nCourt--a man who would have a wife with the same qualities--finally, a\r\nman not unaccustomed to diplomatic business and diligent and accurate in\r\ntransacting it.' When, however, the question passed from the abstract to\r\nthe concrete, M. de Freycinet's ideas ceased to flow so freely, and he\r\nseemed utterly at a loss to find the ideal being which his imagination\r\nhad sketched, although he mentioned M. Challemel Lacour--as a man who\r\nwould not do. In spite, however, of M. Challemel Lacour being in M.\r\nde Freycinet's opinion a man 'who would not do,' it was evident that\r\nhe had a powerful backing, for an emissary from the French Foreign\r\nOffice shortly made his appearance at the Embassy and intimated in\r\nso many words that the appointment of M. Challemel Lacour would be\r\nagreeable to Gambetta. That no doubt was a considerable advantage, but\r\nM. Challemel Lacour by no means corresponded to M. de Freycinet's ideal\r\nrepresentative, being a man of unconciliatory character and particularly\r\nnotorious on account of a speech which he had once made, in which,\r\nalluding to political opponents, he had used the words _Fusillez moi ces\r\ngens là!_ an expression which was continually being quoted against him.\r\nIn the meanwhile, however, M. de Freycinet had had an inspiration, and\r\nsent for Lord Lyons to tell him that he had discovered just the right\r\nman for the place. Unfortunately, this personage was married to a lady\r\nwhose antecedents were not considered to be satisfactory, and it became\r\nnecessary to intimate that under the circumstances the appointment would\r\nnot be favourably received in England.\r\n\r\n     'Freycinet was dreadfully put out,' wrote Lord Lyons, 'when he\r\n     found that the appointment was impossible. He complained chiefly\r\n     of Léon Say for having brought him into the difficulty, by first\r\n     accepting the London Embassy and then standing for the Presidency\r\n     of the Senate.\r\n\r\n     'Léon Say's picture of the lady is about as much like what she\r\n     was when I last saw her a few years ago, as Challemel Lacour is\r\n     like Freycinet's ideal of a French Ambassador in London.'\r\n\r\nThe appointment of M. Challemel Lacour was persisted in, and gave rise\r\nto some very disagreeable discussions in the House of Commons. Doubtless\r\nmuch of the abuse of M. Challemel Lacour was undeserved, but whatever\r\nhis political capacity, he was not remarkable for urbanity.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of a big official dinner at the Paris Embassy, when\r\nrequested to take in the absolutely unexceptionable and agreeable wife\r\nof one of his principal ministerial colleagues, he replied with an\r\nemphatic '_Jamais!_' which precluded any further discussion.\r\n\r\nThe question of diplomatic appointments recalls the fact that it was\r\nabout this time that my connection with Lord Lyons first began, through\r\nbecoming a member of his staff, and that it may be appropriate to say\r\nsomething about his habits and personal characteristics.\r\n\r\nLord Lyons, who was then more than sixty years of age, was a big,\r\nheavily built man, whose appearance in no respect suggested the\r\ndiplomatist of fiction, and who rather resembled the conventional\r\nBritish squire as depicted by Leech; and the chief characteristic of his\r\nsomewhat homely features was a small piercing eye which nothing seemed\r\nto escape, from the most unimportant clerical error to a minute detail\r\nin a lady's dress. As compared with the ordinary English diplomatist,\r\nhis knowledge of foreign languages, without being exceptional, was\r\nthoroughly adequate. He, of course, spoke French with perfect facility,\r\nand it is probable that he wrote it with greater correctness than many\r\nFrenchmen, having a complete mastery both of the grammar and of all\r\nthe complicated expressions which are made use of in correspondence.\r\nHe was also equally at home in Italian; had a knowledge of German,\r\nand was well acquainted with modern Greek. In addition, he was a fair\r\nclassical scholar, and a peculiarly retentive memory enabled him,\r\nunlike most people, to remember much of what he had read. His manner,\r\nat first sight, seemed somewhat alarming, and he was altogether a\r\nperson with whom no one would have felt disposed to take a liberty,\r\nbut the alarming impression, which was solely due to shyness, wore off\r\nwith closer acquaintance as the natural kindliness of his disposition\r\nrevealed itself, and one of the excellent traits in his character was,\r\nthat he never formed a favourable or unfavourable opinion of any one\r\nin a hurry, but invariably waited for the test of time. The result\r\nwas, in almost every case, that the more he saw of people the more\r\nhe liked them and the more reluctant he became to part with men who\r\nhad been associated with him for any length of time. The position\r\nwhich he occupied in British diplomacy during the twenty years which\r\nhe spent at Paris may, without exaggeration be described as unique.\r\nNo other man stood on quite the same footing, though it would be idle\r\nto deny that there were some who were perhaps more brilliant. But the\r\nimplicit confidence which successive Foreign Secretaries placed in Lord\r\nLyons's judgment was based upon the knowledge that his opinions were\r\nsound, unprejudiced, disinterested, and only formed after the most\r\nconscientious investigations. 'I never volunteer advice,' he used to\r\nremark, and it was perhaps for that very reason that his opinion was\r\nso frequently sought by the Foreign Office. In fact so much importance\r\nwas attached to his views that he was occasionally asked to give his\r\nopinion upon subjects of which he had no knowledge whatever, ranging\r\nfrom the defence of Canada to the minimum dress allowance required\r\nby the wife of a British Ambassador at Paris. As he had no intention\r\nof seeking a consort himself, and as he had no intention, either, of\r\nresigning his post, the latter inquiry (which was made in 1870) appears\r\nsomewhat superfluous; but, it may be worth noting, that as the result of\r\nconscientious researches, he reported that £1000 a year was considered\r\nto be necessary.\r\n\r\nAs to his merits as a chief, every one who had ever been associated\r\nwith him was of the same opinion, and it was generally held at the\r\nForeign Office that service under him at the Paris Embassy was a\r\nliberal education in itself. It may be doubted, however, whether his\r\ncapacity and love of work were not to some extent a disadvantage to\r\nhis subordinates, since his industry was so great that it left them\r\ncomparatively little responsible work to do. At the Paris Embassy the\r\nordinary routine work is probably greater than at any other Embassy\r\nwith the exception of Constantinople, but there was scarcely anything,\r\nhowever trivial, which he did not attend to himself. It is believed\r\nin some quarters that an Ambassador leads a dignified, luxurious and\r\ncomparatively unoccupied life, but that was emphatically not the case\r\nwith Lord Lyons. He rose early and began the day by carefully studying\r\nthe more serious French newspapers; the whole of the time up to luncheon\r\nwas spent in writing or reading despatches, or attending to the various\r\nsmall questions which were continually occurring. In the afternoon he\r\nworked again until about 3 or 4 p.m., and then usually went to see\r\nthe French Foreign Minister or paid official calls in connection with\r\ncurrent business. Upon his return he worked again until dinner unless\r\ninterrupted by visitors, who were often of a tedious and uninteresting\r\ntype, and it not infrequently happened that telegrams would arrive at a\r\ncomparatively late hour of the night which it was necessary to deal with\r\nimmediately. All correspondence which arrived at the Embassy, no matter\r\nfrom how insignificant a source, was attended to by him personally,\r\nand elaborate directions given with regard to the replies, which were\r\ninvariably sent with the least possible delay. His industry was only\r\nequalled by an almost preternatural caution, which showed itself in\r\na variety of ways. The reluctance to give advice has already been\r\nnoticed, but his excessive caution showed itself not only in writing,\r\nbut in conversation, and even amongst intimates he rarely expressed\r\nopinions on men or things which it would have been unsafe to quote in\r\npublic, although his conversation was marked by much dry and original\r\nhumour of that elusive character which cannot be described on paper. It\r\nwas practically impossible to catch him napping. 'The Juarez (Mexican\r\nRevolutionary) Minister having left his card upon me without any\r\nofficial designation, I have returned a card also without an official\r\ndesignation,' he wrote from Washington in 1859. His reticence during the\r\nprolonged _Trent_ crisis has already been commented upon. 'I received\r\nby the last mail,' he wrote to Sir Henry Elliot in 1867, 'a letter from\r\nHussein Khan, containing nothing but complimentary expressions. Not\r\nwishing to be outdone in civility, I have written a reply in the same\r\nstrain. It has, however, occurred to me as just possible that Hussein\r\nKhan may desire to appear to be in correspondence with me for some\r\nparticular object, and that there may be something which has occurred\r\nsince I saw him, which might render it advisable that he should not be\r\nin correspondence with me. Accordingly I send my letter herewith open\r\nto you. If you see any reason, however slight, for not forwarding it,\r\nplease destroy it, and take an opportunity of telling Hussein Khan that\r\nI asked you to thank him for his letter to me.' It will be remembered\r\nthat even Queen Victoria was unable to draw him successfully on the\r\nsubject of the Treaty of Berlin. Similar instances might be quoted\r\nindefinitely, and as an illustration of his caution in private life it\r\nmay be mentioned that he never stirred a yard outside the house without\r\na passport. A man of this temperament was not likely to make mistakes,\r\nand it is a remarkable fact that throughout a correspondence extending\r\nover something like forty years, there is not to be found a single\r\nexpression in any official communication addressed to him which could by\r\nany stretch of the imagination be described as a censure or even as a\r\ncriticism of his proceedings.\r\n\r\nAs for the pleasures of the world, they hardly seemed to exist for him,\r\nbut the ordinary human weaknesses, which were chiefly non-existent in\r\nhis case, he regarded with an indulgent and even benevolent eye. He\r\nused to repeat with much glee that the chief entry upon his _dossier_\r\nat the Paris Préfecture de Police consisted of the words: _On ne lui\r\nconnait pas de vice_, and this concise statement may be said to have\r\nbeen literally true. He had never been in debt, never gambled, never\r\nquarrelled, never, as far as was known, ever been in love, although it\r\nwas a mistake to suppose that the opposite sex possessed no attractions\r\nfor him. Nor did he possess the resources available to the ordinary man,\r\nfor he cared nothing for sport, had probably never played a game in his\r\nlife, and detested exercise and outdoor life. The surprising thing was\r\nthat he contrived to keep his health, as although a total abstainer,\r\nhe was a large eater, and never took the slightest exercise. In fact,\r\nduring the last five or six years of his life he probably never walked\r\nfurther than the English Church in the Rue d'Aguesseau, which was within\r\na hundred yards of the Embassy. 'Abstinence and exercise,' he used to\r\nsay, 'were the only two things that disagreed with him.'\r\n\r\nThe natural shyness of his disposition prevented him from deriving much\r\nreal enjoyment from what is generally described as society, but all the\r\nsocial duties of an Ambassador were discharged in a manner which evoked\r\nuniversal approval. The entertainments at the Embassy consisted chiefly\r\nof dinners, which were remarkable for their excellence, and invitations\r\nto which were highly prized by all sections of French society. Nothing,\r\nin fact, could exceed the dignity or the faultless taste of the Embassy\r\narrangements, and not only were Lord Lyons's entertainments renowned,\r\nbut his horses and carriages were, even in Paris, noticeably amongst\r\nthe very best, it being one of his strongest convictions that the\r\nBritish representative should always make an imposing appearance. But\r\nhis hospitality was no matter of mere show; every night the unmarried\r\nsecretaries were asked to dine with him unless otherwise engaged; and it\r\nwas upon these occasions that he used to appear at his best; obviously\r\nfinding more pleasure in their society than in that of any one else with\r\nthe exception of his own relatives. Affection, indeed, for his relatives\r\nwas one of his most marked characteristics, and it is highly probable\r\nthat his devotion to his sister, the Duchess of Norfolk, and to her sons\r\nand daughters, was one of the causes of his not marrying; anyhow there\r\nwas no further question of marrying after the failure of the determined\r\nattempt made upon him by an exalted personage, which has already been\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nHis temper was singularly equable, and during his long stay in Paris\r\nit was said that upon two occasions only was he known to have broken\r\nout; once, when at a review at Longchamps, the Diplomatic Corps were\r\nallotted an inferior position, and once upon an occasion when his\r\ncoachman appeared wearing trousers instead of top boots and breeches.\r\nThese ebullitions were due to the fact that he attached enormous\r\nimportance to all the outward signs of official representation, and\r\nstrongly resented anything which bore in any degree the nature of a\r\nslight. In his capacity as a private individual he was the most modest\r\nand unostentatious of men, and it is recorded, as an instance of his\r\nshyness, that he once passed a week at Woburn without ever leaving the\r\nprecincts of the garden, because he was so much embarrassed by the\r\nsalutations of an adjacent lodge keeper.\r\n\r\nIt might have been supposed that a man of this unimaginative and\r\neminently judicial character would have failed to secure the regard\r\nof his subordinates, however highly he might be esteemed by Cabinets\r\nand Foreign Secretaries. As a matter of fact, probably no chief ever\r\nenjoyed greater popularity, which was due to a variety of causes. He\r\nwas essentially a kind-hearted man, his correspondence abounds with\r\ninstances of help given to persons who had been in his employment in\r\nany capacity, however humble; of opportune assistance rendered to\r\nother persons who had been unlucky in their public careers, and of\r\nrecommendations of men whose services appeared to deserve recognition.\r\nAnd in spite of his apparently detached nature, he took the warmest\r\ninterest in all those who were connected with him officially, and\r\ninvariably showed the utmost consideration, not only for their feelings,\r\nbut for their personal convenience. Thus, unlike some distinguished\r\ndiplomatists, one of his great objects was to save his staff unnecessary\r\nwork; he never put obstacles in the way of persons desiring leave, and\r\nevery afternoon at the earliest possible moment, in order to release\r\nthe Chancery, he used to send across the welcome written message: 'I\r\nhave nothing more for to-day,' although that by no means signified that\r\nhis own labours were concluded. Hardworking himself, he expected his\r\nsecretaries and attachés to do their share, and it was only when they\r\nconspicuously failed, that he showed any sign of severity. During his\r\nlong career it fell to his lot to administer many reprimands, but these\r\nwere invariably so just and unavoidable, that the culprits seldom,\r\nif ever, felt any sense of resentment, and he always made a point of\r\nobliterating as soon as possible, any disagreeable incident of this\r\nnature. The consequence was that he had no enemies, and no one who was\r\never associated with him, has, so far as is known, ever had anything\r\nbut good to say of him. Another excellent feature in his character was\r\nthat he always made the best of his subordinates instead of searching\r\nfor their weak points; however unpromising the material, he generally\r\nsucceeded in effecting a marked improvement, and whenever any one who\r\nhad been with him left for another post, he never failed to draw special\r\nattention to such good qualities as he appeared to possess with the view\r\nof assisting him in his future career. Perhaps I may be pardoned for\r\ninterposing a personal testimonial, upon the occasion of a temporary\r\ntransfer to Berne, which may serve as an example amongst many others.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 15, 1883.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR ADAMS,[30]\r\n\r\n     I have settled that Legh is to be at Berne on the 28th, and I\r\n     hope you will like him. He is clever and well informed, though some\r\n     people think he does not look it.\r\n\r\nIt need scarcely be added that many of the communications of this\r\nnature are of a more elaborate character, and refer to persons who now\r\noccupy distinguished positions in the British Diplomatic Service. As\r\nLord Lyons grew older he became more and more reluctant to part with men\r\nwhom he knew well, and it was pathetic to witness the obvious sorrow\r\nwhich he felt at their departure.\r\n\r\nParis has always been the most coveted post on the Continent, and in\r\naddition to the social attractions of the place, the Embassy enjoyed\r\nthe reputation of carrying on its business in an efficient manner\r\nchiefly owing to the qualities of the Ambassador. The reputation was\r\nwell deserved, and I can only recall one serious _lâche_, not devoid,\r\nhowever, of humour, as to which I was unjustly alleged to be the\r\nculprit. At a moment when critical negotiations respecting intervention\r\nin Egypt were proceeding with the French Government, a member of the\r\nEmbassy had an extremely confidential conversation with an important\r\nFrench Cabinet Minister, in the course of which the Minister criticized\r\nin very uncomplimentary terms his Ministerial colleagues, and the\r\nconversation was immediately embodied in a confidential despatch to\r\nthe British Foreign Office. The following morning a much agitated\r\nChef de Cabinet appeared at the Chancery, bearing the despatch, and\r\nannounced that he 'thought that some mistake had occurred, as the\r\ndespatch had been received by the French Minister for Foreign Affairs.'\r\nTo the general consternation, it now became evident that the despatch,\r\ninstead of being placed in the Foreign Office bag, had found its way\r\ninto a lithographed envelope addressed to the _Ministre des Affaires\r\nEtrangères_, and the whole horrid mystery was laid bare. The question\r\narose whether Lord Lyons should be told or not; the arguments of fear\r\nprevailed; the French Minister behaved in an honourable manner and kept\r\nsilence, and Lord Lyons, fortunately for all concerned, never heard\r\nof an incident which he would have looked upon as little short of a\r\ncalamity.\r\n\r\nThe only possible criticism that could be brought against Lord Lyons\r\nas an Ambassador would be that he led too narrow a life, and moved in\r\ntoo restricted a circle. Day after day and week after week he led the\r\nsame existence; even his holidays were laid out on the same mechanical\r\nprinciple; every year he left his post, much about the same date, took\r\nthe waters at some spa, and then proceeded on a round of visits in\r\nEngland, chiefly at the country houses of the governing families, such\r\nas Knowsley, Chatsworth, Woburn, and Hatfield, but always including\r\na prolonged stay with his relatives at Arundel. He was essentially a\r\ndiplomatist of the old type, consorting entirely in Paris with the\r\nofficial classes, the Faubourg, and the Haute Finance; keeping the\r\npress at arm's length, avoiding everything which did not come within\r\nthe scope of his duties, and confining himself strictly to his own\r\nbusiness. The modern developments of diplomacy; the use of the press,\r\nthe hasty missions of amateur diplomatists, the gushing speeches which\r\nare apparently now considered to be obligatory upon the professional\r\ndiplomatist--all this would have been hateful and perhaps impossible to\r\na man who could boast that he had spent five years in America without\r\nmaking a speech or taking a drink. But in an impartial survey of the\r\ntwenty-eight years which Lord Lyons spent at Washington, Constantinople,\r\nand Paris, it would be rash to assert that any other man would, under\r\nsimilar circumstances, have retained to an equal extent the confidence\r\nof successive British Governments and the esteem and friendship of\r\nthe long series of Foreign Ministers with whom he was called upon to\r\nnegotiate questions often of the most vital importance.[31]\r\n\r\nThe main interest in foreign politics in the summer of 1880 lay in\r\nthe Balkan Peninsula. Mr. Goschen had been sent out to Constantinople\r\nin the place of Sir Henry Layard, and Her Majesty's Government were\r\nendeavouring energetically to force the Porte to carry out the\r\nprovisions of the Treaty of Berlin with regard to the rectification of\r\nthe Montenegrin and Greek frontiers. The Greek Frontier Question made\r\nlittle way, and the Gladstone Government in their diplomatic campaign on\r\nbehalf of the Greeks met with little encouragement or support from the\r\nother Powers, not even excepting France, who had always been the leading\r\nadvocate of Greek claims. When M. de Freycinet was asked what he was\r\nprepared to do if the Turks resolved to defy the Conference which was\r\nthen sitting, nothing more satisfactory could be got out of him than:\r\n_nous marcherons avec vous_, or _nous ne marcherons pas sans vous_, and\r\nto the question whether he would go far if necessary, he only made the\r\ncryptic reply, _peut-être bien_. The British Government were hankering\r\nafter a naval demonstration, and it was disheartening to work with so\r\npusillanimous a comrade.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, June 21, 1880.\r\n\r\n     In answer to your private and personal letter of the day\r\n     before yesterday, I may say that I am not much afraid of the\r\n     French not being willing to go as far as we are willing to go in\r\n     coercing the Turks, if they set Europe at defiance about the Greek\r\n     Frontier. Freycinet seems to shrink from the idea that actual\r\n     coercion may be required, but his only distinct limit to the action\r\n     of France is that she will not do more than England.\r\n\r\n     I myself very much doubt whether the Turks will yield anything\r\n     to naval or other demonstrations, unless they are quite sure that\r\n     these demonstrations are the prelude to the actual use of force,\r\n     and it will not be easy to get them to believe this, unless we are\r\n     ourselves quite sure that that is what we mean.\r\n\r\n     Supposing we pushed demonstrations to the point of forcing\r\n     the Dardanelles, and sending the allied fleets to Constantinople,\r\n     we might produce a revolution, without obtaining the cession of\r\n     the territory to Greece. If the populations are in parts really\r\n     unwilling, the central government may be truly unable to compel\r\n     them to give in.\r\n\r\n     Supposing the Greek troops (_par impossible_) be defeated\r\n     either by the Turkish troops or by recalcitrant Albanians, the\r\n     ships of the Powers might not be able to do much to get them out of\r\n     the scrape.\r\n\r\n     I am very far from meaning to say, in answer to your question\r\n     as to the mildest and safest form of coercion, that it would\r\n     consist in moving troops to occupy the territory. To do so would\r\n     be neither mild nor safe, nor easy to arrange. But I am afraid\r\n     we shall find that in the end the treatment must be topical, and\r\n     that if the Greeks cannot take possession for themselves, we shall\r\n     hardly be able to obtain it for them by pressure exercised at\r\n     Constantinople only.\r\n\r\n     A rendezvous of the fleets at Corfu might have a good effect\r\n     on the Albanians, and perhaps increase the chance of the Greeks not\r\n     being seriously resisted.\r\n\r\n     I see Goschen suggests that the decision of the Conference\r\n     should be announced to the Porte by an identic note. I think a\r\n     collective note would have more effect and be more appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe Turks, however dense they may be in other respects, are usually\r\nintelligent enough to perceive whether the Powers are in earnest or not,\r\nand as no Government except the British felt much enthusiasm for either\r\nthe Greek or the Montenegrin cause, they showed no signs of giving way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 2, 1880.\r\n\r\n     I am afraid it does not look as if the Turks were going to\r\n     yield to the moral force of United Europe. Léon Say and Montebello\r\n     seem to hold even less resolute language to you than Freycinet\r\n     does to me. Did the King of Greece understand Gambetta to say\r\n     that France, with or without the co-operation of other Powers,\r\n     would support Greece with troops? Freycinet will no doubt do\r\n     whatever Gambetta tells him, but one of the inconveniences of the\r\n     power behind the Government greater than the Government, is that\r\n     Gambetta does not talk as cautiously as he would if he felt direct\r\n     responsibility. No power except Russia seems to be willing to bell\r\n     the cat. France seems to be the only one that has in abundance the\r\n     three elements--men, ships, and money. Freycinet always says he\r\n     will do anything with us, but nothing alone, and does not seem much\r\n     more willing than Austria to look the chance of having to use force\r\n     in the face.\r\n\r\n     I do not see much prospect of an immediate diplomatic lull,\r\n     and I very much want one because it is of importance to my health\r\n     (at least the doctors say so) to get away, but I conclude that I\r\n     ought not to shrink from going through the national Festival of the\r\n     14th July, and that I should do what is to be done at least as well\r\n     as any of my colleagues.\r\n\r\nReviews, it may be said, were functions which he abhorred beyond all\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe King of Greece was in Paris at the time, vainly trying to stir up\r\nGambetta to come to his assistance, although Gambetta in conversation\r\nwith Sheffield expressed strong opinions as to the desirability\r\nof France and England acting energetically in concert, and even\r\nprofessed himself in favour of their making a joint demonstration\r\nat Constantinople, and landing troops there if necessary. Upon the\r\nsame occasion he betrayed his gross ignorance of English politics by\r\nlamenting that Lord Beaconsfield had not postponed the dissolution until\r\nthe autumn, 'when he would have been certain of success.'\r\n\r\nFreycinet, however, remained deaf to Lord Granville's appeals, even when\r\nthe latter reproached him with the humiliating position in which France\r\nwould be placed by abandoning a question which she had made her own, and\r\nwhen the British Government proposed a naval demonstration in favour of\r\nthe Prince of Montenegro, made all sorts of excuses for evading it if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 13, 1880.\r\n\r\n     I was more displeased than disappointed by the refusal of\r\n     the French to join in the naval demonstration in favour of the\r\n     Prince of Montenegro. They always try to act with Germany and\r\n     have a horror of sending away a ship or a man unless Germany does\r\n     the same: such is their confidence in the friendship they profess\r\n     to believe in, that they want always to be ready at the shortest\r\n     notice to attack their friend or to defend themselves from him.\r\n     They are also, no doubt, jealous of any separate help to Montenegro\r\n     which does not explicitly pledge the Powers to action in the Greek\r\n     Question also.\r\n\r\n     I quite agree with you that separate threats from the\r\n     French to the Porte about Greece (however incorrect their acting\r\n     separately may be) are more likely to do good than harm. One Power\r\n     in earnest would frighten the Porte more than the six, if the\r\n     Porte were convinced that the five others would not restrain the\r\n     energetic one.\r\n\r\nDuring the next three months the Sultan, single handed, conducted a\r\ncampaign against the six Great Powers, which, as will be seen, nearly\r\nended in success; and it must, in fairness, be admitted that there was\r\na good deal to be said from the Turkish point of view. The Powers were\r\nengaged in endeavouring to force the Porte to comply with conditions\r\ndirectly or indirectly resulting from the provisions of the Treaty of\r\nBerlin. But no steps whatever were taken, or ever have been taken, to\r\nforce other States to comply with stipulations which appeared to be\r\ndisagreeable to them. The right of the Sultan, which had been secured to\r\nhim under the Treaty, to occupy Eastern Roumelia, remained in reality\r\nan empty phrase: the Bulgarian fortresses which were to have been\r\ndemolished, remained untouched, the tribute due from Bulgaria remained\r\nunpaid, and there was no indication of an intention to reinstate the\r\nunfortunate Mussulmans who, as the result of the war, had been driven\r\naway from their homes, and had been despoiled of their property by\r\ntheir new Christian masters. Neither could it be justly maintained\r\nthat, in agreeing to a rectification of the Greek frontier at Berlin,\r\nthe Turks had recognized the right of the Greeks to annex a territory\r\nequal in extent to half of the Greek Kingdom. Added to this, were the\r\ndifficulty and the humiliation involved in surrendering against their\r\nwill, a large number of Mussulman subjects. The difficulty had in fact\r\nproved insurmountable in the case of Montenegro, and the Albanians\r\nwho were in the first instance allotted to Montenegro offered so\r\nsuccessful a resistance that the original plan was abandoned, and after\r\nmuch negotiation, the Porte accepted 'in principle' the cession of the\r\nDulcigno district as an alternative. But the concession of anything 'in\r\nprinciple' by the Turks, usually means something quite different from\r\nthe usual interpretation of that expression, and the Sultan succeeded\r\nin organizing a highly successful so-called Albanian League, and ably\r\nsupported by a resourceful local Pasha, contrived by various expedients\r\nto delay the surrender of Dulcigno for so long that it began to look\r\nas if it would never take place at all. Finally, the resources of\r\ndiplomacy becoming exhausted, a policy of coercion was decided upon, and\r\nan international fleet assembled off the coast of Albania in the month\r\nof September, under the command of Admiral Sir Beauchamp Seymour.[32]\r\nEach power signed a declaration of disinterestedness and a pledge not to\r\nacquire territory, but the hollow nature of this imposing manifestation\r\nwas betrayed by a provision that no troops were to be landed, and the\r\nSultan, who probably had some inkling of the situation, still refused\r\nto give way. A bombardment of Dulcigno would presumably have left him\r\nphilosophically indifferent.\r\n\r\nAs the Dulcigno demonstration did not appear likely to produce any\r\nsatisfactory result, the British Government decided upon the hazardous\r\nstep of proposing the seizure of Smyrna, that being considered the most\r\nefficacious means of coercing the Turks and of preventing the concert of\r\nthe Great Powers from becoming the laughing stock of Europe. This step\r\nwas evidently taken chiefly at the instigation of Mr. Gladstone, and the\r\nletters of Lord Granville bear witness to the extreme anxiety which\r\nhe felt as to the result. No encouragement whatever was received from\r\nFrance; the timorous Freycinet having in the meanwhile been succeeded at\r\nthe Foreign Office by the equally timorous Barthélemy St. Hilaire, an\r\naged survival of the Louis Philippe period.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Oct. 4, 1880.\r\n\r\n     Barthélemy St. Hilaire's answer about the Greek Frontier does\r\n     not look as if we should receive any energetic help from France\r\n     towards obtaining the settlement of that or any other question\r\n     in the East. The answer was all ready cut and dried, and the\r\n     declaration as to France sticking to the Concert, but not taking\r\n     any initiative, had been made before to my colleagues. A more\r\n     experienced diplomatist would have acknowledged more elaborately\r\n     your courtesy in offering to communicate first with France, before\r\n     addressing the other cabinets on the Greek Frontier affair.\r\n\r\n     The fact is that the present Cabinet is still more frightened\r\n     than the last by the disapproval which has been manifested by\r\n     all parties in France of even the little that has already been\r\n     done. With regard to this, M. St. Hilaire made a remark to me\r\n     yesterday which seems to be true enough. France, he said, has quite\r\n     recovered her financial strength, and in great measure her military\r\n     strength, but the _moral_ of the people is not yet _relevé_.\r\n     They are horribly afraid of another war and consequently utterly\r\n     averse from anything like a risky or energetic policy. Another\r\n     popular sentiment, which is extremely inconvenient just now, is the\r\n     feeling that France made the Crimean War _pour les beaux yeux de\r\n     l'Angleterre_ and had better not repeat the experiment. Altogether\r\n     I am afraid France will be a trouble, not a help to us, and I am a\r\n     good deal put out about it.\r\n\r\n     Barthélemy St. Hilaire talked to me a long time about\r\n     Gambetta, with whom he described himself as very intimate. He\r\n     described Gambetta as having a naturally generous nature, as being\r\n     somewhat impulsive and incautious, but at the same time somewhat\r\n     'Genoese.' He said that if I took opportunities of associating with\r\n     him, I should find his character an interesting study. The study\r\n     will not be a new one to me, and I am not sure that too apparent an\r\n     intimacy between me and Gambetta would be viewed without jealousy.\r\n\r\nM. Jules Ferry, the new Prime Minister, was no more amenable than his\r\ncolleague.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Oct. 8, 1880.\r\n\r\n     As to the French agreeing to the Smyrna proposal, I cannot\r\n     prognosticate favourably. I had a long conversation yesterday\r\n     with Jules Ferry, the Prime Minister. I seemed to make some\r\n     impression by urging that to break up the European Concert now\r\n     would be to keep the questions open, with all their inconveniences\r\n     and all their dangers, for an indefinite time. He also admitted\r\n     the many advantages of the Smyrna plan, and was quite unable to\r\n     suggest any other course of action so likely to bring the Sultan\r\n     to reason without inconvenient consequences. But he perpetually\r\n     reverted to the argument that it would be going too near war to be\r\n     admissible under the French Constitution, and that the Chambers\r\n     on that account would call the Ministers severely to task. The\r\n     argument from the Constitution seems to me almost absurd, but it\r\n     is constantly used already in the press, and will no doubt be used\r\n     hereafter in the Chambers. The fact is that Jules Ferry and his\r\n     colleagues are horribly afraid of the effect which they believe any\r\n     action on their part would produce on public opinion and on the\r\n     Chamber.\r\n\r\n     I have seen B. St. Hilaire this afternoon. I went over with\r\n     him the same ground I had gone over with Jules Ferry yesterday, but\r\n     with much the same result. He told me that the question had been\r\n     discussed in the Cabinet this morning and was to be discussed in\r\n     another Cabinet to-morrow. Perhaps they would not like to stay out\r\n     in the cold if Germany and Austria came in, but I am afraid they\r\n     will certainly not say 'yes,' though they may say 'no' before those\r\n     Powers have given their answer. They seem to argue from the delay\r\n     of the German Government, that Bismarck is against the proposal.\r\n     Orloff, my Russian colleague, tells me that he is strongly urging\r\n     the French to agree. Beust and Radowitz (the German) talk as if\r\n     they themselves thought well of the Smyrna plan, but say they have\r\n     heard nothing from their Governments.\r\n\r\n     I spoke to B. St. Hilaire about your reasons for communicating\r\n     first with him about the Greek Question, and he sent with effusion\r\n     the message of thanks which he ought to have sent at first.\r\n\r\n     Choiseul is applying with vigour the _épuration_ system to\r\n     the Foreign Office and the Diplomatic Service. He seems to have\r\n     dismissed some very good men in both. Des Michels is one of his\r\n     victims, and to-day he has decapitated the head of the Commercial\r\n     Department.\r\n\r\n     I think it better not to communicate at present the draft\r\n     instructions to the Admiral. They would, I think, be seized upon as\r\n     arguments that the occupation of Smyrna would be an act of war.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government were in effect in a very bad mess. The Smyrna\r\nproposal had received no real support from any Power. Bismarck had\r\nannounced that the so-called Eastern Question was not worth the bones\r\nof a Pomeranian Grenadier, and nothing was to be expected from him.\r\nThe same thing applied to Austria; neither Italy nor Russia were to be\r\nrelied upon, and France was unwilling and unenterprising. No wonder\r\nthat Lord Granville felt singularly uncomfortable: the Concert of\r\nEurope, as he expressed it, had 'gone to the devil,' no one was going to\r\nhelp him, and unless within a few days the Turks yielded, the British\r\nGovernment would be confronted with the alternatives of seizing Smyrna\r\nsingle handed or of confessing defeat and abandoning the contest. Lord\r\nGranville himself was in favour of the latter course, as being logical,\r\nand the natural consequence of the action of the other Powers, who would\r\nneither agree to the English proposals nor propose anything themselves.\r\nMr. Gladstone, on the other hand, was apparently all for going on and\r\nacting as the mandatory of Europe, and as he usually got his way, it\r\nis possible that this dangerous course might have been adopted; but in\r\nthe very nick of time, just at the moment when the situation looked\r\nto be at its worst, the Sultan suddenly gave way and announced that\r\nDulcigno should be handed over to the Montenegrins. What brought about\r\nthis sudden decision has always remained more or less of a mystery, but\r\nthere is no proof that the proposed seizure of Smyrna (which would have\r\nprobably inconvenienced European interests quite as much as the Sultan)\r\nwas the deciding factor. According to the late Lord Goschen, who was in\r\nas good a position to know the real facts as any one else, the sudden\r\nsurrender of the Sultan was caused by a Havas Agency telegram from\r\nParis; but the contents of this communication have never been divulged,\r\nand Lord Goschen himself never ascertained what they were. The surrender\r\nof Dulcigno, which took place in November, terminated the crisis and\r\nenabled the Gladstone Government to claim a striking if lucky success\r\nfor their own particular sample of spirited Foreign Policy.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1880 the relations between the Liberal Government and\r\nthe Irish Nationalists were the reverse of cordial, and a good many\r\ninquiries used to come from the Foreign Office respecting alleged Irish\r\nplots and conspiracies at Paris with requests that the French police\r\nauthorities should be asked to give their assistance. These requests\r\nLord Lyons was in the habit of discouraging as much as possible,\r\npartly from an ingrained dislike to being involved in any secret and\r\nequivocal transactions, and partly because he knew that if the French\r\npolice gave their assistance in tracking down Irish conspirators, they\r\nwould certainly expect reciprocity in regard to Bonapartists and other\r\nopponents of the existing system of Government at that time residing\r\nin England. For these reasons he always urged that the English police\r\nauthorities should communicate direct with the French police authorities\r\nwithout using the Embassy as an intermediary. But the efforts of the\r\nGladstone Government were not confined to endeavouring to check Irish\r\nplot by means of the police, and an attempt was made to restrain the\r\nturbulent bishops and priests engaged in the Home Rule agitation by\r\napplying pressure upon them from Rome. The credit of this expedient\r\nseems to have been chiefly due to the active and enterprising cleric,\r\nMonsignor Czacki, who was acting as Nuncio at Paris, and who appears\r\nto have conceived the idea that if the Pope could be persuaded to\r\nintervene on the side of the British Government, it might be possible\r\nto re-establish regular diplomatic relations between England and the\r\nPapacy. As far back as December, 1879, Monsignor Czacki had made certain\r\novertures, but they met with no attention from Lord Salisbury.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, June 18, 1880.\r\n\r\n     Last October a very quiet, not to say dull, old Italian\r\n     prelate was succeeded here as Papal Nuncio by a very active,\r\n     talkative and agreeable Pole, Monsignor Czacki.\r\n\r\n     At the beginning of December Monsignor Czacki came to me and\r\n     told me that he had received a letter from Ireland accompanied by,\r\n     or referring to, letters from very important people, among which\r\n     was, he said, one from you. He had in consequence written to the\r\n     Pope, and the Pope had written to the Irish Bishops to exhort them\r\n     to do all in their power to restrain their flocks from taking\r\n     part in violent or seditious proceedings. Monsignor Czacki asked\r\n     me whether the state of affairs in Ireland was at the moment so\r\n     serious as to render it advisable that the Pope should repeat these\r\n     exhortations to the Irish Bishops. I made a somewhat banal answer\r\n     to the effect that though there were no grounds for feeling alarm\r\n     as to the ultimate issue of what was going on, there was good\r\n     reason that those who possessed influence there should use it for\r\n     the prevention of crime and outrage, and also of turbulence and\r\n     disorder.\r\n\r\n     I reported what has passed in a private letter to Lord\r\n     Salisbury, but I received no answer from him, and I heard no more\r\n     of the matter till yesterday.\r\n\r\n     Yesterday, however, Monsignor Czacki came to see me and\r\n     showed me a letter he had received a few days before from Lord\r\n     Emly. The letter said that previous intervention had produced the\r\n     best results, that several Bishops had denounced the agitation in\r\n     the strongest terms, but that unfortunately the Socialists were\r\n     publicly supported by various Bishops. It mentioned that the Roman\r\n     Catholic Bishop of Meath, and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of\r\n     Cashel had manifested their sympathy with Mr. Parnell, and that the\r\n     Roman Catholic Bishop of Kilmore had himself recommended Mr. Biggar\r\n     to the electors as a candidate. The letter begged Monsignor Czacki\r\n     to intervene again, but it made the request only from Lord Emly\r\n     himself, without any allusion to you or to any other person, as\r\n     being cognizant of it.\r\n\r\n     Monsignor Czacki said that he entirely sympathized with the\r\n     views of the writer and intended to send the letter to Rome; and he\r\n     proceeded to ask me whether I would authorize him to say that he\r\n     had shown it to me and that he sent it with my approval.\r\n\r\n     It seemed to me that this would be bringing the thing much too\r\n     near Her Majesty's Government for it to be right for me to assent\r\n     to it without knowing your wishes.\r\n\r\n     I confess this mode of communicating with the Vatican does\r\n     not commend itself to my judgment, and that it seems to me that it\r\n     might lead to awkwardness and interfere with better means you have\r\n     of communicating with the Pope, if you wish to communicate with\r\n     His Holiness at all. At the same time I was not absolutely sure\r\n     that you might not think there might be some convenience in having\r\n     this channel open. I did not therefore rebuff Monsignor Czacki, but\r\n     without giving any hint that I should refer to you, said simply\r\n     that I would think about what he had said.\r\n\r\n     He is very fond of enlarging academically upon the advantages\r\n     England would derive from entering into regular diplomatic\r\n     relations with the Holy See, or if that were impossible, from\r\n     re-establishing an unofficial agent at Rome.\r\n\r\n     You will gather from all this that Monsignor Czacki is not\r\n     altogether disinclined to be busy.\r\n\r\nThe energetic Nuncio returned to the subject at the close of the year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Dec. 31, 1880.\r\n\r\n     You may remember that in June last I gave you in a private\r\n     letter a long account of a conversation which Monsignor Czacki, the\r\n     Papal Nuncio here, had volunteered to have with me on Irish affairs.\r\n\r\n     Monsignor Czacki came to see me three days ago, and enlarged\r\n     on the great advantage to the cause of order and tranquillity in\r\n     Ireland it would be for the Pope to pronounce an authoritative\r\n     condemnation of the wicked acts perpetrated in that country. He\r\n     hinted that the Pope had been misled by some of the Irish Bishops\r\n     who had recently been at Rome, and he dwelt on the inconvenience\r\n     which arose from the British Government's having no channel of its\r\n     own through which to communicate direct with His Holiness.\r\n\r\n     On the last occasion Monsignor Czacki offered to be himself\r\n     a channel of communication. He did not repeat this offer, but\r\n     his object in what he had said appeared to be to lead up again\r\n     to the question of the establishment of regular diplomatic\r\n     relations between England and the Vatican, or if that could not be\r\n     immediately, then to the return to Rome of an unofficial agent, in\r\n     the same position that was occupied by Odo Russell, and before him,\r\n     by me. He told me he spoke entirely of his own accord, but that he\r\n     was sure that Pope Leo XIII. would most willingly receive even an\r\n     unofficial agent.\r\n\r\n     Monsignor Czacki is a very great talker, which makes it easy\r\n     to say very little in answer to him, and I took full advantage of\r\n     the facility for being conveniently silent which this afforded me.\r\n\r\n     The impression he left upon me was that for some reason or\r\n     other the authorities at the Vatican decidedly wish to have some\r\n     sort of agent there, from whom they could receive information\r\n     respecting the views of the British Government upon the accuracy of\r\n     which they could fully rely.\r\n\r\n     I don't think that if it had depended on me I should have\r\n     discontinued the unofficial agent, awkward as the position had been\r\n     made by the presence of the Italian Government and of a regular\r\n     British Embassy. But to establish one now would be a question of\r\n     far greater difficulty than to have kept one going.\r\n\r\nWhether influenced by Monsignor Czacki or not, Her Majesty's Government\r\nsent Mr. Errington, a Liberal Member of Parliament, to Rome in an\r\nambiguous capacity which was loudly denounced in the House of Commons\r\nboth by Home Rulers and by fervent Protestants, and in the course\r\nof one of the discussions on the subject, Mr. Gladstone informed an\r\nastonished audience that there was all the difference in the world\r\nbetween an Agent and an 'Agente.'\r\n\r\nThe French Municipal Elections which took place in January, 1881,\r\nproduced a reassuring impression throughout the country, as both the\r\nextreme parties were decisively defeated, and the effect was largely\r\nto increase the power and influence of Gambetta, who was now in the\r\nenviable position of being able to make or unmake Ministries, and who\r\nat the opening of the Chambers made a kind of 'speech from the throne'\r\nwhich considerably perturbed the uninspiring President Grévy.\r\n\r\nEverything that Gambetta now said was of importance, and his views on\r\nthe European situation were ascertained in the usual manner through\r\nSheffield.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Feb. 8, 1881.\r\n\r\n     Gambetta asked Sheffield to breakfast on Saturday, and as\r\n     usual talked freely to him.\r\n\r\n     He appeared to think that the three Emperors had come to\r\n     an understanding with each other, and that whatever might be\r\n     their plans, it was certain that they would not be beneficial\r\n     to French interests. According to him, it was with the Emperors\r\n     not a question of the position of their Empires, but of their\r\n     own individual positions. They were opposed to liberal views and\r\n     liberal institutions. They were intent upon doing whatever would be\r\n     most hurtful to the prestige and success of the Republic in France.\r\n     They were, in fact, reconstituting the Holy Alliance.\r\n\r\n     At this moment France was unfortunately powerless. Until the\r\n     General Election had taken place, her destinies must be at the\r\n     mercy of any old women who were employed as stopgaps in ephemeral\r\n     ministries. Since Barthélemy St. Hilaire had been in office he had\r\n     only seen him once. He knew nothing or next to nothing of what went\r\n     on at the Ministère des Affaires Étrangères, and what little he did\r\n     know, he disapproved. 'Que voulez vous,' he said: 'nobody will do\r\n     anything to commit himself in any way, pending the uncertainty of\r\n     the elections.'\r\n\r\n     He seemed well informed about Egyptian affairs. He praised\r\n     Malet and said de Ring was entirely in the wrong in his quarrel\r\n     with de Blignières, which was very injurious to the calm direction\r\n     of Egyptian affairs. He expressed an intention to urge the\r\n     immediate recall of de Ring.\r\n\r\n     I mark this letter private because we should get into a great\r\n     scrape and close a very convenient channel of communication if\r\n     Gambetta found that he was quoted or that his sayings transpired in\r\n     any way.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the year 1881 lies in the fact that it makes a fresh\r\ndeparture in French foreign policy and the abandonment of the retiring\r\nand timorous attitude which had prevailed ever since the war with\r\nGermany. The first State to experience the inconvenience of this new\r\ndevelopment was Tunis, and early in the year it became evident that\r\na very acute Tunis question was imminent. The trouble began over a\r\nlarge property known as the Enfida Estate. This property was sold to\r\nan important French financial association, but upon the sale becoming\r\nknown, a certain Mr. Levy, a Maltese British subject, put in a claim of\r\npre-emption under Tunisian Law, and it was believed by the French that\r\nhe had been instigated by the Italians, and was merely utilized by them\r\nas a convenient means of obstructing French enterprise. The dispute over\r\nthe Enfida Estate rose to such proportions that a French ironclad, the\r\n_Friedland_, was sent to Tunis in February, and the British Government,\r\nwho were bound to make a show of defending the interests of Mr. Levy,\r\nin spite of his dubious position, followed suit with H.M.S. _Thunderer_.\r\nBoth vessels were soon withdrawn, but before long it was generally\r\nbelieved that a French invasion of the country was contemplated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Feb. 25, 1881.\r\n\r\n     The French public are getting very cross about Tunis.\r\n     Reasonable people see that we cannot allow our own subject to be\r\n     bullied, but the French in general do not distinguish between\r\n     the Enfida case and the Tunisian questions regarding predominant\r\n     influence, Italy, and so forth. Drummond Wolff's question last\r\n     night was very mischievous. It was his own party which gave the\r\n     assurances at Berlin which have made Tunis so very delicate a\r\n     matter between the French and us, and which dispose the French to\r\n     allege that the present Government is less friendly to them about\r\n     that country than the late. Anyhow, Tunis is the point on which\r\n     above all others the French are susceptible and irritable; and\r\n     the Italians, and, however unconsciously, our own Consul too, I\r\n     am afraid, are always stirring up awkward questions on the spot.\r\n     I should be heartily glad to be rid of the Enfida question in any\r\n     creditable manner. I so strongly suspect that Levy is simply put\r\n     forward by the Tunisians for their own gain, and supported by the\r\n     local enemies of goodwill between France and England, in order\r\n     to make mischief, that I only wish we could wash our hands of\r\n     the whole affair. There seems to me to be no evidence that he is\r\n     a _bona fide_ purchaser on his own account. Tunis is the really\r\n     ticklish point in our relations with France.\r\n\r\nThe Enfida Estate case was not only unsatisfactory on account of Mr.\r\nLevy not being a very desirable _protégé_, but because it enabled\r\nthe French to manufacture a grievance against the Bey, and gave the\r\nItalians an opportunity to encourage that unfortunate potentate in the\r\nbelief that he would receive foreign support in the event of French\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nThe intentions of the French Government were disclosed before long.\r\nShortly after the wretched Bey had protested against a memorial\r\ncontaining a long list of alleged French grievances against the\r\nGovernment of Tunis, M. Jules Ferry, on the ever convenient plea of the\r\nnecessity of chastising hostile frontier tribes, asked for votes of\r\ncredit for both the army and the navy, which were unanimously agreed to.\r\nBefore the expedition actually started, the French agent at Tunis, M.\r\nRoustan, visited the Bey and informed him that the French preparations\r\nwere intended to protect him against the Sultan of Turkey, who desired\r\nto convert Tunis into a Turkish Pashalic, and that, under these\r\ncircumstances, it was very desirable that Tunis should be placed under\r\na French Protectorate. It was quite in vain that the unhappy Bey urged\r\nthat he had no reason to suspect the Sultan of any such intention and\r\nthat he had not the slightest desire for a French Protectorate; he was\r\ninformed that he was not the best judge of his own interest, and that\r\nFrench troops would shortly enter his country to chastise the Kroumirs,\r\na race of whom nobody had yet heard, but who apparently constituted a\r\nserious menace to the French Republic.\r\n\r\nThe obvious design of the French drew from Lord Granville an opinion\r\nthat they could not be allowed to seize upon Tunis without the consent\r\nof Turkey, and the permission of other Powers; but to this opinion not\r\nmuch attention seems to have been paid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Granville to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    April 5, 1881.\r\n\r\n     I have thought it necessary to instruct you to inquire into\r\n     the state of affairs at Tunis. You are not likely to do so in an\r\n     unnecessarily offensive manner.\r\n\r\n     I am told that the French are determined to establish their\r\n     Protectorate. This will be very awkward at the moment.\r\n\r\n     Pray look as mysterious as you can, as to what might be our\r\n     attitude.\r\n\r\n     We do not wish to follow the example of the foolish opposition\r\n     made to Algiers, but the French cannot be allowed to seize Tunis\r\n     without the consent of Turkey and communication with the rest of\r\n     Europe.\r\n\r\n     The Italians wish us to move vigorously in the matter; the\r\n     Italian Government seems alarmed at the excitement of their chamber.\r\n\r\nIt was all very well to say that the 'French cannot be allowed to seize\r\nTunis,' but when a big European Power decides to pounce upon a weak and\r\ndecaying Oriental State, it is not of the slightest use to employ such\r\nlanguage if merely moral suasion is contemplated. The recent action\r\nof the Italian Government with regard to Tripoli[33] was the exact\r\nrepetition of French action with regard to Tunis, and remonstrances were\r\nof no more avail in one case than in the other. The Bey sent piteous\r\nprotests and appeals for justice to all the Great Powers, but as Italy,\r\nthe only Power which really objected, was not prepared to fight, his\r\nlamentations fell upon deaf ears. Meanwhile, in an attempt to justify\r\ntheir bare-faced aggression, the French Government apparently handed to\r\nM. Blowitz, the _Times_ correspondent at Paris, a despatch from Lord\r\nSalisbury written in 1878, which it had been agreed should be treated as\r\nconfidential, and it was intimated in the press that further private\r\nand confidential communications would appear in a forthcoming Yellow\r\nBook. This produced a very justifiable remonstrance from Lord Salisbury.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Hatfield, April 24, 1881.\r\n\r\n     I am not sure that I am not irregular in addressing to you any\r\n     communication on public affairs. But I think I have been told that\r\n     a certain license is accorded to disembodied Foreign Secretaries,\r\n     of haunting the scenes of their former misdeeds.\r\n\r\n     My cause of writing is this. My eye caught a statement in one\r\n     or two English papers that St. Hilaire intended to print in the\r\n     forthcoming Yellow Book, Waddington's first despatch to d'Harcourt\r\n     on coming back from Berlin. I had a dim recollection that it was\r\n     undiplomatically phrased and had been withdrawn: but I could\r\n     remember no more.\r\n\r\n     Is it not rather a strong measure for a Government to withdraw\r\n     a despatch to which objection is taken at the time, when it might\r\n     be answered, and then to publish it three years later, when the\r\n     materials for answering it no longer exist? However, perhaps I am\r\n     wrong in assuming that the newspaper report is correct.\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury was quite correct in his recollection, and the intention\r\nof publishing the despatch referred to was not carried out, but various\r\nattempts were made to fix upon him the responsibility for French action\r\nin Tunis.\r\n\r\nLord Granville, although he confessed to disliking the process, had to\r\ncontent himself with ineffectual barking.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Granville to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    April 22, 1881.\r\n\r\n     You will not like a despatch I send you, and I am rather sorry\r\n     to send it. But I do not see how we are to give France _carte\r\n     blanche_.\r\n\r\n     I dislike barking without biting, but if the result of not\r\n     barking (in contradistinction to all that was done under Louis\r\n     Philippe and Napoleon, when English remonstrances certainly stopped\r\n     the French) is the annexation of Tunis, or the creation of the\r\n     great port of Bizerta impregnable by naval force and neutralizing\r\n     Malta, we should look rather foolish.\r\n\r\n     Notwithstanding the present Chauvinism about Tunis, it would\r\n     not be a sweetmeat for the French to have England, Italy and the\r\n     Arabs inside and outside Algeria against her.\r\n\r\n     It is as well that she should not imagine that this is\r\n     perfectly impossible.\r\n\r\n     But, of course, I wish to ruffle her as little as possible,\r\n     and nobody will wrap up the warning of our doctrine as to the\r\n     Ottoman Empire better than you will.\r\n\r\nUndeterred by Lord Granville's just remonstrances and equally undeterred\r\nby the Sultan's assertion of his suzerainty claims, the French entered\r\nTunis and occupied the capital on May 11, after little more than a\r\nmere promenade. On the following day the Treaty of the Bardo, which\r\npractically established a French Protectorate over the country, was\r\nextorted from the Bey, and declarations by the French Government made it\r\nclear that no intervention, direct or indirect, would be tolerated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 13, 1881.\r\n\r\n     Barthélemy St. Hilaire certainly foreshadowed the Tunisian\r\n     Treaty accurately when he said that it would very much resemble a\r\n     Protectorate. It is so like one that it would be difficult to point\r\n     out a difference. The guaranteeing the execution of the Treaties of\r\n     the European Powers is sufficiently impertinent. As in all these\r\n     French expeditions, there is a vast amount of dirty pecuniary\r\n     stockjobbing interests at the bottom, which have been the real\r\n     motive power.\r\n\r\n     The whole affair is of very bad augury. It will inspire the\r\n     French Public with a love of resorting to high-handed proceedings\r\n     which can be indulged in without any real risk. Gambetta said to\r\n     Dilke that his Cherbourg speech was the first glass of wine given\r\n     to the Convalescent France, good for her but somewhat startling to\r\n     her system. This Tunis expedition is the second. The patient has\r\n     swallowed it so complacently that she may soon wish for another,\r\n     and perhaps a stronger stimulant. They got Bismarck's leave for\r\n     this, and it will perhaps be a long time before they do anything\r\n     of the kind without his leave. But then he will be sure to push\r\n     them on to any undertakings which will occupy their minds and their\r\n     forces, and tend to put them on bad terms with other Powers. And\r\n     this is disquieting, for there are not wanting all over the globe\r\n     places and questions in which the French might make themselves very\r\n     inconvenient and disagreeable to us, and might, if encouraged by\r\n     Bismarck, come at last to a downright quarrel with us.\r\n\r\n     Add to this the state of feeling in the English manufacturing\r\n     districts which is likely to be produced by the Commercial\r\n     proceedings of the French, and their virulent Protectionism, and\r\n     the prospect looks gloomy enough.\r\n\r\nThe actual proceedings of the French in Tunis were in reality of less\r\nimportance as regards England than the spirit which they betrayed, for\r\ntheir reception by the French public indicated a state of feeling which\r\nmight have dangerous consequences. The preparations for the expedition\r\nwere not considered by impartial critics as particularly creditable\r\nto the skill or efficiency of the French military administration, and\r\nthere had been nothing like serious fighting in the short campaign. The\r\nquestion had simply been one of bullying a defenceless ruler, and of\r\ncarrying on a high-handed policy in the face of Europe. Nevertheless\r\nthe whole affair was hailed with almost unanimous delight by the French\r\npeople. Nor, apparently, was this delight diminished by the reflection\r\nthat the expedition had not been undertaken without the approval and\r\nencouragement of the German Government, and that the favour had been\r\nacknowledged with almost humiliating gratitude.\r\n\r\nGambetta had represented that his object was to emancipate France\r\nfrom the humiliation of having to consult Bismarck confidentially\r\nbeforehand upon every step she took, but this humiliating precaution was\r\ncertainly not neglected in the case of Tunis, and if there had been the\r\nslightest suspicion that the expedition would have involved France in\r\nany difficulty with Germany, public opinion would at once have declared\r\nagainst it. From the German point of view this was satisfactory enough,\r\nbut scarcely reassuring as far as other Powers were concerned.\r\n\r\nThe French had shown that they rejoiced in any high-handed proceedings\r\nwhich did not bring them into collision with Germany, and whilst it was\r\nnot improbable that their rulers would seek popularity by gratifying\r\nthis feeling, it seemed not unlikely that the policy pursued by\r\nGermany with regard to the Tunis expedition would be persevered in. To\r\ndisseminate the forces of France and to divert the minds of the French\r\nfrom Alsace and Lorraine by encouraging them to undertake distant\r\nenterprises for the gratification of their vanity, was an obvious means\r\nof increasing the safety of Germany, and the more such enterprises\r\ntended to alienate from France the sympathies of other Powers, the more\r\nthey would contribute to the security of Germany. Unfortunately there\r\nwere scattered over the globe, numerous islands and other territories,\r\nthe annexation of which by France might be prejudicial to English\r\nmaterial interests or objectionable to English feeling; and there were,\r\nmoreover, various countries in which the undue extension of French\r\ninfluence might be dangerous to England, and where France, if tempted\r\nor encouraged to resort to arbitrary proceedings, might, without\r\ndeliberately intending it, become involved in a downright quarrel with\r\nEngland. These considerations made it desirable that especial caution\r\nshould be exercised in the case of Egypt. The effect of the Tunis\r\nexpedition upon Egypt had been twofold. On the one hand, it increased\r\nEgyptian suspicions of the insincerity and rapacity of European Powers;\r\non the other hand, it increased the reputation of France in Egypt at the\r\nexpense of the other Powers and of England in particular, and diminished\r\nany confidence in being effectively protected from French encroachments.\r\nThe lesson of the Tunis expedition was obvious; it would clearly be\r\nfolly, either by withholding the tribute or by any other step to weaken\r\nthe connexion of Egypt with the Porte, for the French Government had\r\ntaken elaborate pains to show that in dealing with Tunis it was dealing\r\nwith an independent Power. This contention had naturally been resisted\r\nby the Porte, and there was little difficulty in proving that suzerainty\r\nhad been effectually established by a Firman of 1871. But the Sultan of\r\nTurkey, who in the past had enjoyed the possession of more suzerainties\r\nthan any other potentate, had seldom derived anything but embarrassment\r\nfrom this particular attribute, and in the case of Tunis it proved\r\nto be singularly inconvenient. Encountering no opposition from other\r\nPowers, the French flouted the claims of Abdul Hamid, and in order to\r\nsignify their new position, announced that the French representative\r\nwould thenceforth take charge of all foreign questions. In spite,\r\nhowever, of the flexibility of the European conscience with regard to\r\nthe general principle of the Sultan's suzerainty, it was recognized\r\nthat under certain circumstances that principle must be conscientiously\r\nupheld; and it was, therefore, intimated, more or less directly to the\r\nFrench Government, that although the Sultan's suzerainty in Tunis was a\r\nnegligible quantity, the situation in Tripoli was quite different, and\r\nso, in a far greater degree, was that of Egypt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, June 17, 1881.\r\n\r\n     It is most true that the danger of bad relations between us\r\n     and the French arises from their proceedings not ours, and that\r\n     this makes the great difficulty in meeting it.\r\n\r\n     The change of their position with regard to Bismarck is\r\n     another great difficulty. A little while ago dread of Germany\r\n     made them unwilling to send a regiment or a ship to a distance\r\n     from France, but since the Tunis affair, they have gone into the\r\n     trap he has set for them with their eyes open. They feel sure of\r\n     his support and encouragement in any distant enterprises, and the\r\n     surer of it in proportion to the hostility which such enterprises\r\n     may provoke in England and Italy. They thus find a cheap way of\r\n     gratifying their vanity, and of advancing some of their apparent\r\n     interests. This coquetting with Bismarck does, moreover, divert\r\n     their thoughts from Alsace and Lorraine.\r\n\r\n     I don't think it would be prudent to make any special advances\r\n     to Gambetta at this moment. We might not please him and we should\r\n     very probably offend Grévy and Barthélémy St. Hilaire, and so\r\n     interfere with the practical treatment of present questions, such\r\n     as the Commercial Treaty, the West Coast of Africa, Newfoundland,\r\n     etc.\r\n\r\n     The anomalous position of the French in Tunis, and the\r\n     proceedings of Roustan[34] there, will keep up irritation in\r\n     England and Italy--and I suppose the French, annuente Bismarck,\r\n     will cut the Gordian knot, sooner or later, by annexing it. They\r\n     ought in consequence to acquiesce in some improvement of the\r\n     position of England in Egypt, but this is dangerous ground.\r\n\r\nThe overbearing attitude of the French officials in Tunis caused\r\nconsiderable irritation in England, and something akin to exasperation\r\nin Italy. The Italians, had they felt strong enough to do so, would have\r\nresisted the French pretensions by force, but being without an ally at\r\nthe time, had to content themselves with violent ebullitions in the\r\npress. The ill-feeling between the two countries was marked by serious\r\nriots at Marseilles and other towns in the South of France.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, June 24, 1881.\r\n\r\n     I did my best to impress upon B. St. Hilaire yesterday that\r\n     there was real bitterness of feeling among the public in England,\r\n     and that if the French Government and its agents persisted in a\r\n     series of irritating measures, the consequences might be very\r\n     inconvenient. The French had got all they could want, I said, and\r\n     I could not help wondering that it did not strike them that their\r\n     policy should now be to let the new system settle down quietly,\r\n     to avoid occasions of controversy about it, and in short, to let\r\n     Tunis be as little heard of as possible at present. It was an ill\r\n     return, I observed, for the great patience and friendliness shown\r\n     by our Government, to be perpetually springing upon them surprises\r\n     unpalatable to English public opinion. He professed to _abonder\r\n     dans mon sens_. I entreated him to keep his subordinates in order.\r\n\r\n     The French seem to have an unpleasant business in Western\r\n     Algeria, and there is beginning to be an outcry against the\r\n     military and civil management of the troubles there.\r\n\r\n     Good feeling between French and Italians will not be promoted\r\n     by late events at Marseilles. The feelings of the French towards\r\n     the Italians there are like those of the American workman towards\r\n     the Chinese at San Francisco, or of the Irish towards the negroes\r\n     at New York. There are said to be more than 50,000 Italians at\r\n     Marseilles, and they are apt to use their knives.\r\n\r\n     There are symptoms of a growing antagonism between Jules Ferry\r\n     and Gambetta, signs of the feeling between the Elysée and the\r\n     Palais Bourbon.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the Tunis expedition turned out to be a rather more\r\ntroublesome affair than had appeared probable at first. At the end of\r\nJune insurrections broke out at Sfax and other places, necessitating the\r\nrecall of French troops who had been sent back to France; bombardments,\r\nand other severe measures of repression. The insurrection spread into\r\nAlgiers on the western side, and on the eastern side the disturbances\r\ncreated the possibility of a violation of the frontier of Tripoli by the\r\nFrench troops.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 5, 1881.\r\n\r\n     Retribution has come quickly upon the French for their\r\n     hypocritical seizure of Tunis. The Arabs seem to be upon them\r\n     in all directions. Although this serves them right, it is, I\r\n     think, much to be regretted for political reasons, independently\r\n     of the suffering it causes to un-offending Europeans of various\r\n     nationalities in Africa.\r\n\r\n     If the French have to send a large force to Tunis, they will\r\n     very probably, formally as well as virtually, annex the Regency.\r\n     Tripoli will then stand exactly in the same relation to them\r\n     that Tunis did before the assumption of the Protectorate. After\r\n     Tripoli would come Egypt; but happily there is, I believe, a very\r\n     impracticable desert tract between them.\r\n\r\n     How great must be the complacency of those who desire to\r\n     occupy French troops in distant countries, and to involve France in\r\n     difficulties with other Powers.\r\n\r\nIf the action of the French in seizing Tunis was hypocritical, the\r\ncontention that the case of Tripoli stood on an entirely different\r\nfooting was equally unconvincing. The real truth, of course, was that,\r\nwith the exception of the Italians, no one really objected to the French\r\ngoing to Tunis. They went there, under distinctly false professions,\r\nannouncing that the expedition was intended solely to punish refractory\r\ntribes, and that the occupation was merely temporary. The disclosure\r\nof their real objects naturally caused irritation in England as well\r\nas in Italy, but all hostile criticism was met by the assertion of the\r\nLiberal Government that Lord Salisbury had himself invited the French\r\nto take Tunis at the time of the Berlin Congress. The French themselves\r\nwere careful to represent that they had only followed Lord Salisbury's\r\nadvice, and Lord Granville, in defence of his own policy, always\r\nmaintained that the phrase attributed to Lord Salisbury, _Carthage ne\r\ndoit pas rester aux barbares_, had cut the ground from beneath his\r\nfeet, and rendered remonstrance useless. But to make Lord Salisbury\r\nresponsible for this act of flagrant immorality seems, in the face of\r\nsuch evidence as is available, unjustifiable. All that he had done was\r\nto intimate that he had heard that the French were extremely anxious\r\nto go to Tunis; that if they did so, British interests would not be\r\nendangered, and that he should consequently look on with indifference.\r\nWhen M. Waddington, in 1878, construed this opinion as an invitation to\r\nFrance to appropriate Tunis, Lord Salisbury felt bound to remonstrate,\r\nand he wrote to Lord Lyons, as has been already shown. 'He (Waddington)\r\nmakes me talk of Tunis and Carthage as if they had been my own personal\r\nproperty, and I was making him a liberal wedding present.' The real\r\ninstigator of the Tunis expedition was not Lord Salisbury, but Bismarck.\r\nThe latter, who was omnipotent in Europe at the time, could have stopped\r\nFrench action at any moment he pleased, but instead of doing so, he\r\nnaturally encouraged an enterprise which was certain to lead eventually\r\nto difficulties between France, Italy, and England.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, it was convenient to overlook any French illegality\r\nwith reference to Tunis and to its connection with the Turkish Empire,\r\nit would have been, as has already been shown, manifestly imprudent\r\nto allow Tripoli, which stood in a precisely similar position, to be\r\nmenaced with a similar fate: besides which, Italy had already marked\r\nTripoli down as her own prey. Accordingly the French Government were\r\ninformed that 'in view of the unquestioned incorporation of Tripoli in\r\nthe Turkish Empire, as well as its proximity to Egypt, Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment could not regard interference of whatever description on\r\nthe part of the French Government in that province in the same manner\r\nas they viewed the recent occurrences at Tunis. That Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment should take this view of the question of Tripoli cannot, they\r\nfeel assured, be a source of surprise to that of France, since they\r\nhave, on all occasions when the question of the extension of French\r\ninfluence in the direction of Egypt has been under discussion, been\r\nperfectly frank in their explanations with the French Government on the\r\nsubject.' In his reply to this communication, M. B. St. Hilaire (who\r\nhad previously announced that to annex Tunis would be a great mistake),\r\neffusively stated that the French Government looked upon Tripoli as\r\nan integral part of the Ottoman Empire, over which it did not pretend\r\nto exercise a predominant or exclusive influence, and gave a formal\r\ndenial to all rumours which attributed to France any designs upon that\r\ncountry. The British Government professed itself quite satisfied with\r\nthese assurances, and the Porte, for once in a way, showed sufficient\r\nintelligence to make its suzerainty quite clear, by despatching troops\r\nto garrison the country, and by other precautionary measures. In\r\nconsequence of these steps Tripoli remained immune from attack for\r\nanother thirty-two years, and when, in 1912, the Italians, following\r\nthe French example of 1881, fell suddenly upon it without any serious\r\nattempt at justification, they did not allege that they were attacking a\r\nsemi or wholly-independent State, but declared war upon Turkey itself,\r\nand incidentally brought about the destruction of Turkish power in\r\nEurope. The future of Tripoli under Italian rule is still obscure, while\r\nthe numerous prophecies of failure which attended the seizure of Tunis\r\nby the French have not been fulfilled, but in either case it would be\r\ndifficult to justify the morality of the enterprise or to defend the\r\npolicy of these two Great Christian Powers.\r\n\r\nThe year 1881 witnessed the renewal of negotiations for a new Commercial\r\nTreaty between France and England, and in consequence of opinions\r\nexpressed by M. Tirard, the French Minister of Commerce, it was\r\ndetermined to take the negotiations out of the hands of diplomatists.\r\nM. Tirard had declared that he believed that an understanding could be\r\neffected if the question could be freed from diplomatic dilatoriness,\r\nand that if he were brought face to face with a 'competent and\r\nwell-disposed man,' the whole matter would be settled within a week\r\nby making a few mutual concessions. To meet these views, the late Sir\r\nCharles Dilke, M.P., was appointed principal British Commissioner with\r\nthe late Sir Joseph Crowe, Sir Alfred Bateman, and other distinguished\r\nexperts as his colleagues or assistants, but M. Tirard's prognostication\r\nturned out to be entirely incorrect. In spite of the great ability\r\nand indefatigable industry of Sir Charles Dilke and the other British\r\nCommissioners, the negotiations made a very unsatisfactory start,\r\nwere constantly broken off, and were not even concluded by the end\r\nof the year, so that it must have been impressed upon M. Tirard that\r\ndilatoriness was not necessarily due to diplomacy. From the first, the\r\nnegotiations were unpromising, for Free Trade had continually receded in\r\nFrance since the Empire, and the necessity of cultivating good political\r\nrelations with England was evidently less in 1881 than it had been upon\r\nthe last occasion.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the two nations met in London in June, and an\r\ninauspicious beginning was made by the French Commissioners repudiating\r\nthe bases signed in 1880 by Lord Granville and M. Léon Say. By the\r\nmiddle of the month the breaking off of the negotiations was already\r\nbeing considered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Sir C. Dilke, M.P._\r\n\r\n    Paris, June 14, 1881.\r\n\r\n     I received last evening your letter of the day before, asking\r\n     me whether I had anything to say on the policy of breaking off the\r\n     commercial negotiations when you get to work.\r\n\r\n     I don't think we should lose sight of the fact that there will\r\n     in all probability be a thorough change of Government in France in\r\n     the autumn. We might _perhaps_ get a decent treaty from the new\r\n     Government if they found the negotiations in progress. It might\r\n     not be so easy to get negotiations reopened if they had once been\r\n     broken off, and the French had become accustomed to the idea of\r\n     having the general tariff applied to British goods.\r\n\r\n     Politically, it would, I think, be a great pity to begin\r\n     ill with the new Government, and I don't think we could possibly\r\n     begin well, in the state of feeling which would be produced in\r\n     this country, and still more I suppose in England, by a commercial\r\n     rupture.\r\n\r\n     The majority of the French would be very glad that the general\r\n     tariff, or still higher duties, should be enforced against English\r\n     goods, but they would none the less be irritated by our breaking\r\n     with them.\r\n\r\n     I confess, too, that I am alarmed, perhaps without sufficient\r\n     reason, at the effect which may be produced both at home and abroad\r\n     by the cry in England for retaliation.\r\n\r\n     My own plan would be, for the present, to pursue the\r\n     negotiation as seriously and as steadily as is compatible with\r\n     not committing ourselves to any decidedly objectionable duties so\r\n     definitely as to be hampered in subsequent negotiations if we find\r\n     the new Government more fairly disposed towards us.\r\n\r\n     If there was ever any possibility of concluding a Treaty in\r\n     time for it to be passed by the Chambers this Session, there is\r\n     certainly none now. Gambetta wanted to get the question out of the\r\n     way before the elections; but even if the Treaty were signed, I\r\n     don't think the Chambers could be induced to consider it under\r\n     present circumstances. Nor would they, I should think, pass a bill\r\n     to prolong the existing Treaties.\r\n\r\n     To my mind, our most prudent course would be to let the new\r\n     Chambers find the negotiations going on when they meet in the\r\n     autumn. I don't of course mean that you should go on sitting every\r\n     week from this time to the autumn: it would suffice that there\r\n     should not be any adjournment _sine die_, and that we should not\r\n     give any ground for an assertion that we are not really willing to\r\n     conclude even a moderately fair treaty.\r\n\r\nLord Lyons, as has already been stated, was, like almost every British\r\nofficial of the time, a firm and almost bigoted Free Trader; and it\r\nis possible that his alarm at the prospect of retaliation was caused\r\nby the appearance of the Fair Trade League; that harbinger of Tariff\r\nReform to which somewhat inadequate justice has been rendered by its\r\nimitators. But it is surprising to learn of these qualms, when he is\r\nfound predicting that the smaller countries who were willing and able to\r\nretaliate on French goods, would obtain better terms than England. The\r\nvery different spirit in which the smaller States approached commercial\r\nquestions with France is shown in the following instructive account of\r\nthe views of the Swiss Minister at Paris, M. Kern.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Sir C. Dilke._\r\n\r\n    Paris, June 25, 1881.\r\n\r\n     Last evening, after my letter to you of yesterday had gone, I\r\n     met Kern, who told me that in the course of the day he had had an\r\n     interview with M. Tirard, and also one with M. Gambetta. He had,\r\n     he said, declared most distinctly to both, first, that Switzerland\r\n     would not sign a Treaty placing her in a less advantageous\r\n     commercial position than that now existing; and secondly, that\r\n     if the general tariff were applied to Swiss goods, French goods\r\n     would be forthwith subjected to duties of precisely the same amount\r\n     in Switzerland. He had, he said, somewhat surprised M. Tirard by\r\n     informing him that the Swiss Government had power to impose such\r\n     duties at once, without waiting for legislative sanction.\r\n\r\n     The impression left upon Kern's mind by the two interviews\r\n     was, that as hard a bargain as possible would be driven by France,\r\n     but that in the end they would rather make moderate treaties than\r\n     no treaties at all, if they saw that this was the only alternative.\r\n\r\n     He is going to Berne to confer with his Government, and he\r\n     says that he is sure they will approve and confirm his language to\r\n     Tirard and Gambetta.\r\n\r\n     After these interviews, Kern was very positive that the French\r\n     Government were making a great fight to justify themselves to the\r\n     Chambers, but that if the Powers, and particularly England, were\r\n     firm, the French would yield rather than incur the political and\r\n     other inconveniences of not making any treaty at all.\r\n\r\n     I am not so sure as he seemed to be of this, but I think that\r\n     the French are alive to the political inconveniences of breaking\r\n     with England altogether; and it might therefore be worthy of your\r\n     consideration, whether, when you go back to the Articles you\r\n     reserved in the Tariff, you should not make a last effort to see\r\n     whether the French cannot be brought to consent to a Treaty which\r\n     would be better commercially than no Tariff Treaty at all. It might\r\n     interfere with whatever chance of success such an effort might\r\n     have, for the French to feel beforehand that they could get out of\r\n     the political difficulty by signing a simple Most Favoured Nation\r\n     Treaty.\r\n\r\n     Nevertheless I am not shaken in my opinion that it would be\r\n     advisable for you to sign a Most Favoured Nation Treaty, if better\r\n     may not be, before you break up the Commission, or adjourn it for\r\n     any long time.\r\n\r\n     Commercially we had better make sure at once of sharing the\r\n     concessions which may be made to other Powers under threats of\r\n     retaliation.\r\n\r\n     Politically we should, I think, find it most disadvantageous\r\n     to have even the appearance of being on bad terms with France.\r\n\r\nThe British Government apparently still entertained the illusion\r\nthat there were real French Free Traders. M. Challemel Lacour was\r\nthe chief French Commissioner and Lord Granville welcomed him as a\r\nbrother Free Trader. His brother Free Trader said it was true that he\r\nwas _Libre-Echangiste_, but he was _Libre-Echangiste Français_, and\r\nrecognized the necessity of paying due consideration to the interests of\r\nnative industries. To this chilling response, Lord Granville was forced\r\nto retort that he must venture to doubt whether a _Libre-Echangiste\r\nFrançais_, in His Excellency's acceptation of the term, was not what\r\nin England was called a Protectionist. M. Waddington had once stated\r\nthat he was a Free Trader 'bar cotton,' and whenever the French Radical\r\nParliamentary candidates, who were then perambulating the country in\r\nview of an approaching general election, were asked whether they were\r\nFree Traders or not, they replied in the affirmative, but qualified by\r\na reserve in favour of French industries which would be ruined by Free\r\nTrade. As a matter of fact, the spirit of Protection was becoming more\r\nand more ingrained in the French people, and the best chance of getting\r\na reasonable Commercial Treaty lay in the hope that an election would\r\nbring Gambetta into power.\r\n\r\nThe London negotiations which had been temporarily suspended were\r\nresumed at Paris in the autumn, and continued during the remainder of\r\nthe year; but interest was diverted from commercial matters to the\r\nevents which were occurring in Egypt and their probable effect upon\r\nAnglo-French relations.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Subsequently Viscount Goschen.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Sir Francis Adams, Minister at Berne.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: See Appendix by Mrs. Wilfrid Ward, \"Lord Lyons in Private\r\nLife.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Afterwards Lord Alcester.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: 1911.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: French Consul-General at Tunis.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nARABI'S REBELLION\r\n\r\n(1881-1882)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn September, 1881, the long-drawn-out Egyptian crisis culminated in the\r\nmilitary _coup d'état_ of Arabi and the colonels, which resulted in the\r\ndismissal of the Ministry and the practical establishment in Egypt of a\r\nmilitary dictatorship. From that moment European intervention, in some\r\nform, became inevitable, and it was the object of the British Government\r\nto continue to adhere honestly and consistently to the policy of working\r\nin conjunction with France, and to avoid carefully as long as possible\r\nany action which might necessitate the employment of force.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Sept. 30, 1881.\r\n\r\n     The article in the _Times_ has produced an anti-English\r\n     explosion on the subject of Egypt, and was certainly well\r\n     calculated to do so.\r\n\r\n     For my part, I think the best thing to be done is to take an\r\n     opportunity of distinctly manifesting at Cairo the continuance of\r\n     the Anglo-French understanding.\r\n\r\n     If we let either the Egyptians or Foreign Powers suppose they\r\n     can upset that, we shall not be able to maintain the English and\r\n     French Controllers, and if they disappear, the financial prosperity\r\n     will disappear with them, and we shall have the bondholders,\r\n     French and English, on our backs again.\r\n\r\n     If we let in other Foreign Powers, and at the same time try\r\n     to establish English predominance, we shall have those Powers\r\n     coalescing with France against us.\r\n\r\n     A split with us would very probably lead to France throwing\r\n     herself into the arms of Bismarck, and he would encourage all\r\n     her ambitious aims out of Europe, and, in particular, those\r\n     the prosecution of which would widen the breach between her\r\n     and England: or, in other words, be especially annoying and\r\n     inconvenient to us.\r\n\r\n     I hope things are so far calming down in Egypt, that we may\r\n     not be called upon to take any special measures this time; and\r\n     the best hope of avoiding them in future seems to be in making it\r\n     understood that England and France united will resist attempts to\r\n     overthrow the existing system.\r\n\r\n     I am all against letting the Turks thrust the smallest finger\r\n     into the pie. At this moment the French would never consent, and\r\n     would consider our bringing in the Turks a specially unfriendly\r\n     act, with a view to their Tunisian affairs. The less they merit any\r\n     consideration from us, the more sore they will be at not receiving\r\n     it. Besides which, where the Turkish hoof has trod, no grass grows,\r\n     and woe to the finances of any country with which the Turk can\r\n     meddle.\r\n\r\n     Of course, in what I have said about Egypt I have confined\r\n     myself to the present and the immediate future.\r\n\r\nThe chances of being able to avoid active intervention were in reality\r\nnon-existent; for temporizing measures taken in conjunction with France\r\ncould not put off for ever the day when, moral pressure having been\r\nfound insufficient, armed force would necessarily have to be employed.\r\nWhen that day arrived, the probability was that France would want to\r\nsend troops in conjunction with ours, and our consent to that course\r\nmight involve us in war with France in a very short time. If we had the\r\ncourage to tell the French that our interests were paramount in Egypt,\r\nand that therefore all other European Powers must be kept out, then we\r\nmust be prepared to back our words with force, and everything therefore\r\npointed to the naval superiority of England in the Mediterranean as\r\nbeing our paramount necessity. With real naval superiority in the\r\nMediterranean we were practically able to make the French do our\r\nbidding, if we chose. We had the power to shut up their navy in French\r\nports, to stop their communications with Africa, to render powerless\r\ntwo millions of French soldiers, and to demolish Bismarck's schemes\r\nof elbowing us out of the Mediterranean. Such was the happy position\r\nwhich we enjoyed in 1881, and it was a great contrast to that which\r\nwe occupy at the present day; but it did not tend towards promoting\r\ngoodwill between the two nations, and Lord Lyons constantly urged\r\nthat some joint understanding should be arrived at, in the event of\r\nanother military outbreak in Egypt. The situation had been complicated\r\nby the despatch of a Turkish mission, and the general impression in\r\nFrance was that Arabi and the colonels would shortly be engaged in a\r\nconspiracy to dethrone the Khedive and to restore something like the old\r\n_régime_ in the country. A positive declaration from the English and\r\nFrench Governments that they would not tolerate the overthrow of the\r\nKhedive and the established system might have effected much if it was\r\nfelt that the two Governments would interfere by force, if necessary,\r\nrather than permit it; but this would not be felt or believed unless\r\nthe two Governments had really come to an understanding and had agreed\r\nupon details; and when it came to discussing details the question\r\nat once presented difficulties. These difficulties were not lessened\r\nby a French Ministerial crisis in the autumn, as a crisis usually\r\nproduced a fit of petty Chauvinism, such an encouragement to Consuls\r\nin the East to _porter haut le drapeau de la France_, the bullying of\r\nlocal authorities, and a demand for the extortion of monopolies and\r\nconcessions for French speculators.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Nov. 4, 1881.\r\n\r\n     The Treaty of Commerce and Egypt will probably be the two\r\n     first questions we shall have to discuss with the new Government.\r\n\r\n     The Commercial negotiations seem to me to have been brought\r\n     exactly to the right point. Having obtained the three months\r\n     prolongation, we have resumed the negotiation on the day fixed, and\r\n     have continued it _bona fide_; and it now stands over in a manner\r\n     which will enable us to see in due time whether or no we can make a\r\n     treaty with the new Government.\r\n\r\n     As regards Egypt, the opinion gains ground here that at the\r\n     bottom of the agitation there is (or soon will be) a plot to\r\n     dethrone Tewfik and put Halim in his place as a 'National': _i.e._\r\n     anti-European, anti-French, and anti-English Control, Khedive. I\r\n     understand that de Blignières represented strongly to Gambetta that\r\n     the only way to produce quiet in Egypt and counteract intrigues\r\n     in favour of Halim at Yildiz Kiosk is for England and France to\r\n     declare positively at Cairo and Constantinople that they will not\r\n     stand it, but will resolutely support Tewfik and the existing state\r\n     of things. I do not know how far Gambetta assented to this, but I\r\n     am told he did not dissent from it.\r\n\r\nThe result of much political manoeuvring was that in November, 1881,\r\nGambetta was forced to take office and to exchange the irresponsible\r\npower which he had hitherto wielded in the background for Ministerial\r\nresponsibility. As frequently occurs in similar cases, when the great\r\nmystery man was dragged out into the light of open day, his appearance\r\nwas somewhat disappointing. His Administration, with one exception\r\nonly, was composed entirely of men belonging to his own immediate\r\nfollowing, and contained no one of any weight beside himself. Gambetta\r\ntook the Foreign Office as well as the Presidency of the Council, and\r\non the principle that _il vaut toujours mieux avoir affaire à Dieu qu'à\r\nses anges_, this was an advantage, although it was believed that he\r\nentertained so great an admiration for Bismarck, that, following the\r\nlatter's example, he would probably hand over the foreign diplomatist to\r\nan under secretary. The first impressions produced by the new Ministry\r\nwere not favourable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Nov. 18, 1881.\r\n\r\n     I don't think the present Ministry is so far at all a success.\r\n     Among other inconveniences arising from the appointment of men of\r\n     so little personal importance is that there is no one in Gambetta's\r\n     party who does not think that he ought to have been a Minister;\r\n     or, in other words, who acquiesces in the superiority of any of\r\n     those chosen. The fact that Léon Say and Freycinet were offered\r\n     portfolios, but would not accept them on Gambetta's terms, tells\r\n     against the selection ultimately made. Gambetta's personal genius\r\n     must make up for all deficiencies. He appears to have a talent\r\n     in particular for parliamentary tactics, especially for making\r\n     the right move on the spur of the moment. I doubt his having\r\n     deep-matured plans. So far as I can see, he lives _au jour le jour_\r\n     like ordinary men.\r\n\r\n     I had a long visit yesterday from Spüller, but we did not get\r\n     much beyond generalities. Gambetta and I have exchanged visits, but\r\n     have not met.\r\n\r\n     I do not hazard conjectures on commercial matters, as Dilke\r\n     will ascertain to-morrow exactly how the land lies. ... As a\r\n     diplomatist, I cannot but feel that there is convenience in being a\r\n     bachelor just now.\r\n\r\nThe last sentence does not refer to the fact that he had just been\r\ncreated a Viscount, but to the somewhat peculiar domestic circumstances\r\nattaching to certain members of the new Government.\r\n\r\nIt had been assumed that Gambetta's accession to office would be\r\nmarked by a more vigorous foreign policy, especially in the direction\r\nof acquiring fresh territories in distant regions; but this was not\r\njustified by his own language or bearing, and at his first interview\r\nwith the Ambassador he abstained from pompous common-places about\r\npreferring England to all the rest of the world, and desiring peace at\r\nany price, which was looked upon as a good sign. At the same time, there\r\nwas, in his speeches about Tunis and the Mediterranean, a slight flavour\r\nof Chauvinism which would not have excited remark before 1870, but which\r\nwould not have appeared in 1880, and would certainly not have been\r\napplauded in 1881, unless it had become generally known that Bismarck\r\nhad sanctioned and encouraged French enterprises away from the continent\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Dec. 6, 1881.\r\n\r\n     Gambetta gave the Diplomatic Body an excellent dinner last\r\n     Saturday, and played his part as host very successfully.\r\n\r\n     What may be at the bottom of his heart, nothing has yet shown.\r\n\r\n     The change which has come over the relations between France\r\n     and Germany opens to him the door for a comparatively safe yet\r\n     ambitious Foreign Policy. Will he resist the temptation?\r\n\r\n     During the years which immediately followed the war, the\r\n     feeling of France towards Germany was composed of furious hatred\r\n     and of mortal dread. The line taken, consciously or unconsciously,\r\n     by Germany tended to add bitterness to this feeling. She interfered\r\n     dictatorially with France even in internal matters. Her object\r\n     seemed to be not only to impede the restoration of French strength\r\n     and wealth, but to prevent the French recovering even prestige\r\n     anywhere. She was, or affected to be, convinced that a war of\r\n     revenge on the part of France was imminent. She was believed by\r\n     the French to be angry at their showing so much vitality and to be\r\n     preparing to give them the _coup de grâce_.\r\n\r\n     At this moment, however, neither France nor Germany appears\r\n     to apprehend an attack or to be prepared to make one. Each appears\r\n     to consider the other too strong to be attacked with impunity.\r\n     Certainly Gambetta would not find the nation in heart to follow him\r\n     in defying Germany. If therefore his policy or his passions incline\r\n     him to do something striking to flatter the national vanity, how\r\n     is he to find the means? The Tunis affair has given Bismarck an\r\n     opportunity of showing him. It has enabled the Chancellor to\r\n     convince the French that they will have the countenance of Germany\r\n     in any enterprise in which they may engage out of Europe.\r\n\r\n     How far this may be part of a great plan of Bismarck's\r\n     to secure German supremacy in Europe by pushing Austria into\r\n     the Levant, Russia into Asia, and France into Africa and the\r\n     Mediterranean, and by shutting up England in her own islands, we\r\n     need not inquire. In any case it must suit Prince Bismarck to see\r\n     France making acquisitions of territory or influence, which weaken\r\n     her military force in Europe, throw burthens on her finances, and\r\n     make ill blood between her and other Powers.\r\n\r\n     Unhappily if Gambetta is so short-sighted as to give in to\r\n     temptation of this kind, difficult questions are, more than with\r\n     any other Power, likely to arise with England, who is in contact\r\n     with France all over the world and especially in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n     I hope better things, and I am not at all willing to despair\r\n     of a thorough good understanding between France and England which\r\n     would avert danger from both, and enable both to do good to all the\r\n     world. Still one cannot but be anxious at this moment. Egypt may be\r\n     the ticklish point.\r\n\r\nThe Parliamentary skill of Gambetta was seen to advantage during the\r\nshort winter session, and compared favourably with the want of tact and\r\nvigour which had been displayed by his predecessors. He even obtained a\r\nsuccess in the Senate, where he had not expected to find any sympathy\r\nat all, and some of the more sensible Conservatives became disposed to\r\nsupport him, more from fear of what might result if he fell than from\r\npersonal attachment. Some of his appointments, however, aroused alarm,\r\nand he perturbed Lord Lyons by bestowing upon a journalist a most\r\nimportant post in the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Dec. 30, 1881.\r\n\r\n     I will not despair, but I am feeling very great anxiety\r\n     about the Commercial Treaty. I am afraid that on this side of the\r\n     Channel, much more than in England, the failure of the negotiations\r\n     would have a most undesirable political effect. In France and on\r\n     the Continent generally, it would be taken as a sure indication of\r\n     a coolness between the two Governments. Gambetta would be taunted\r\n     by the Opposition with having alienated England (Italy having been\r\n     alienated before). Gambetta's supporters in the press and elsewhere\r\n     would try to throw the blame upon England, the English press would\r\n     retort upon France, and a very unpleasant state of feeling would be\r\n     the result.\r\n\r\n     Gambetta has astounded people by appointing a flashy newspaper\r\n     writer, of no particular principles, to the post of Political\r\n     Director in the Foreign Office. The Political Director is almost\r\n     the most important person in the office, as he drafts all the\r\n     political despatches and notes. I hope the communications to the\r\n     foreign ambassadors are not to be in the style of 'smart' newspaper\r\n     articles. I confess that when I saw the appointment in the _Journal\r\n     Officiel_, it did not occur to me that the man could be the same\r\n     Weiss who had been writing in the _Figaro_.\r\n\r\nThe friendly disposition of Gambetta towards England has already been\r\nnoted, and beyond a certain tendency in his speeches towards Chauvinism,\r\nthere was nothing in his conduct calculated to arouse alarm, but\r\nnevertheless a critical moment in Anglo-French relations appeared to\r\nbe approaching at the beginning of 1882. The Government of France had\r\npassed into the hands of a Minister far more influential, more able,\r\nand more ambitious than any man who had taken part in public affairs\r\nsince the retirement of Thiers, and the time was at hand when that\r\nMinister must decide on the line of policy to be followed with regard\r\nto Foreign Powers. The character and temperament of Gambetta naturally\r\ndisposed him to endeavour to make his Foreign Policy more vigorous,\r\nmore successful and more striking than that of his predecessors, and\r\nwith that object he would probably take one of two courses. Either\r\nhe would aim at emancipating France from her existing confidential\r\nservility towards Germany; or, despairing of that, he would continue the\r\nexisting relations with Bismarck, and thus ensure the latter's willing\r\nacquiescence in aggressive proceedings on the part of France beyond the\r\nlimits of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn order to shake off the German yoke, Gambetta evidently considered\r\nit essential that he should be able to place himself on distinctly\r\nfriendly and intimate terms with England, and if he failed in this, the\r\nprobability was that he would be obliged to revert to the patronage\r\nwhich was felt to be so irksome. But the change which had come over\r\nthe relations between France and Germany opened the door to a foreign\r\npolicy which was comparatively safe and easy, and yet did not present\r\nthe disadvantage of being unambitious. The period which immediately\r\nfollowed the war of 1870, was, as has already been pointed out, marked\r\nby a feeling in France towards Germany of fierce hatred combined with\r\nextreme fear, and German policy, whether consciously or unconsciously,\r\ntended to embitter this feeling. Germany interfered dictatorially and\r\nostentatiously even in French internal affairs, and the object seemed\r\nto be not only to crush the reviving strength of France, but to prevent\r\nher recovering anywhere, or in any matter, the smallest portion of her\r\nlost _prestige_. The German Government professed to believe that a war\r\nof revenge was meditated, and was credited with the intention of finally\r\ndestroying France before the latter should be sufficiently recuperated\r\nto resume the struggle.\r\n\r\nBut with the lapse of time, a change of policy, and, to a certain\r\nextent, a change of feeling had taken place on both sides. Neither\r\ncountry was in any immediate apprehension of an attack from the other. A\r\nsomewhat ostentatious interchange of courtesy had been substituted for\r\ntheir former reserve, and Bismarck had seized the opportunity of the\r\ninvasion of Tunis to let the French understand that they would have the\r\ncountenance of Germany in enterprises undertaken by them out of Europe.\r\nApart from all far-reaching schemes for securing German supremacy in\r\nEurope, it was obviously in the interests of Germany that France should\r\nengage in enterprises and make acquisitions which dispersed her armies,\r\ndisorganized her finances and created ill feeling with other Powers.\r\n\r\nGambetta was much too intelligent a man not to see through this policy,\r\nbut the temptation to direct the energies of France into the Colonial,\r\nrather than the continental direction, might prove too strong for him\r\nif he despaired of gaining credit for his Government in another way.\r\nUnhappily, in such a case, with no Power were difficulties so likely to\r\narise as with England, which was more or less in contact with France in\r\nall parts of the world, and especially in the Mediterranean. Nor could\r\nit be forgotten that in the speeches lately delivered on the subject of\r\nTunis, Gambetta had made strong appeals to national pride with regard to\r\nFrench possessions and interests beyond the seas.\r\n\r\nStill there was no reason to suppose that the so-called Colonial Policy\r\nwas Gambetta's first choice. He was known to chafe under the practical\r\nsubservience of France to Germany, and to feel deeply humiliated by it.\r\nAt the bottom of his heart he cherished an ardent desire to recover\r\nthe lost provinces, but he knew that neither the military strength of\r\nFrance nor the spirit of the people would warrant his attempting this\r\nwithin any assignable period. He did, however, aim at freeing the French\r\nGovernment from the sort of occult control which Germany had recently\r\nexercised over it, and at improving the position of France as a Great\r\nPower. He desired to present the Government over which he presided\r\nto France and to Europe as taking a dignified and important part in\r\ninternational questions, and feeling that these objects could best be\r\nattained by a real and visible friendship with England, he was evidently\r\ndisposed to treat pending questions with a view to maintaining and\r\nmanifesting a cordial understanding.\r\n\r\nThe two most important questions of the moment were, of course, Egypt\r\nand the Commercial Treaty.\r\n\r\nAs regards Egypt, there was so far complete unity between the two\r\nGovernments--the strain having not yet arrived--but the conclusion of\r\na Commercial Treaty appeared to be a more arduous affair. Gambetta\r\nwas apparently ready to go as far towards making an acceptable Treaty\r\nas was possible without risking a defeat in the Chambers. But if the\r\nnegotiations were to fail, he would probably despair of keeping up good\r\nfeeling towards England in France. He would conceive that the failure\r\nwould discredit him in the eyes of France and of Europe; that it would\r\nconvey to foreign Governments an impression, which he could not remove,\r\nof there being a coolness between France and England, and that it would\r\noblige him to seek for his Foreign Policy some other basis than union\r\nwith England.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the fear that unsuccessful commercial negotiations would convert\r\nGambetta into a foe was partly due to a communication from Sir Charles\r\nDilke announcing that a commercial ultimatum was about to be hurled at\r\nthe French Government. This communication is extremely instructive from\r\nthe English Parliamentary point of view, for it recommended that in\r\ndespatches the word 'bargain' should be carefully avoided, 'as it would\r\nstrengthen the reciprocity argument.' In other words, although wine\r\nduties were to be utilized for the purpose of bargaining, the fact was\r\nnot to be disclosed lest it might be construed as a departure from the\r\nsacred principles of Free Trade.\r\n\r\nAttention was, however, quickly diverted from the Commercial Treaty\r\nto Egypt. On January 8, the British and French Governments presented\r\nthe so-called Dual Note, in which they declared their intention of\r\n'warding off by their united efforts all causes of external or internal\r\ncomplications, which might menace the _régime_ established in Egypt.'\r\nThe Dual Note was by no means as successful as had been hoped, and it is\r\nclear that Gambetta was in favour of more decided and independent action\r\nthan the British Cabinet. Within a few days Lord Granville was already\r\nwriting to Lord Lyons and asking him whether it would not be advisable\r\nfor England and France to ask permission from the Powers to appear as\r\nmandatories of Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Granville to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Jan. 17, 1882.\r\n\r\n     The news from Egypt is certainly not reassuring, and the\r\n     _mauvais quart d'heure_ may arrive at any moment.\r\n\r\n     M. Gambetta would probably desire joint intervention; the\r\n     objections to this are immense: I need not recapitulate them all to\r\n     you.\r\n\r\n     Single occupation, by England or by France, still more so.\r\n\r\n     I am not quite sure that Turkish occupation under proper\r\n     conditions and control by France and England, although a great\r\n     evil, would not be less bad than the three alternatives I have\r\n     mentioned. But it is not only bad in itself, but it would be\r\n     strongly opposed by the French, although it would be supported\r\n     by the German Powers. In these circumstances, an observation of\r\n     Malet's struck me as having some force. Talking of the intentions\r\n     of some of the other Powers to have their part in the question, he\r\n     said it would not be so objectionable, if they consented to allow\r\n     the English and French to be the mandatories.\r\n\r\n     The idea seemed to me to be worth considering, and I spoke to\r\n     Tenterden and Rivers Wilson (but to no one else) and requested them\r\n     to draw up a memorandum as to how this could be carried out. I send\r\n     you an extract, and I should like to have your opinion on it before\r\n     I submit it even to Gladstone as a possibility.\r\n\r\n     Gambetta of course would not like it. But his difficulty is as\r\n     great as ours if he were to understand that we will not agree to\r\n     joint occupation. There would be nothing humiliating to France if\r\n     the proposal was freely consented to by both countries and jointly\r\n     offered to Egypt.\r\n\r\n     For us it would only be acting on the Concert of Europe\r\n     principle, about which we have been making such a fuss.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat half-hearted proposal met with no approval from Lord\r\nLyons, who expressed his objections in more decisive terms than were\r\nusual with him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Jan. 19, 1882.\r\n\r\n     In your letter of the day before yesterday you ask me for\r\n     my opinion on a suggestion as to admitting other Powers to take\r\n     part in the Egyptian Question, on the supposition that France and\r\n     England should be their mandatories.\r\n\r\n     This would, _ipso facto_, be the abandonment of the\r\n     exceptional position which England and France have taken up in\r\n     Egypt. Whether this position can be, or ought to be, maintained for\r\n     a long time, is a question which I will not stop to examine.\r\n\r\n     That a proposal to abandon it, at this moment, would have a\r\n     very bad effect on our relations with France, does not, I think,\r\n     admit of a doubt. It would be taken as an abandonment of our\r\n     intention to give up, in the face of Europe, all special intimacy\r\n     with the French Government. It would give rise to suspicions\r\n     that we were trying to use the other Powers for the purpose of\r\n     ousting France from Egypt. The union of England and France on the\r\n     Egyptian Question is the principal symbol of there being a good\r\n     understanding between them, and to this symbol the French attach no\r\n     little importance.\r\n\r\n     I don't know that the designation of mandatories of Europe\r\n     would mend the matter. The other Powers would not commission\r\n     England and France to decide by themselves what measures should\r\n     be recommended for Egypt. They might depute England and France\r\n     to enforce the decisions of Europe, but this would only bring us\r\n     back to the joint intervention of the two Powers in a particularly\r\n     awkward and unmanageable form.\r\n\r\n     Practically, it would, I think, be found much more difficult\r\n     for us to keep well with France, if the other Powers were also to\r\n     have a voice in details. Hitherto England and France have managed\r\n     to come to an agreement with each other on the questions that have\r\n     arisen. It might be made more difficult for them invariably to side\r\n     with each other against other Powers. Political considerations as\r\n     to affairs distinct from Egypt might come into play. Setting aside\r\n     a natural and not improper jealousy on the part of each, lest its\r\n     associate should obtain separate and undue influence, the interests\r\n     of England and France in Egypt are very much the same. The main\r\n     interest of some Governments, and in particular that of the Porte,\r\n     might be antagonistic to cordiality between the two Western Powers.\r\n\r\n     A Commission appointed now to deal with questions relating to\r\n     the government and administration of Egypt would be a different\r\n     matter from the Commissions of 1878 and 1880.\r\n\r\n     In the first place, it seems probable that the Sultan would\r\n     protest strongly against it, and that he would do so whether or\r\n     no there were Turkish members of it appointed by him. His Majesty\r\n     might possibly acquiesce under strong pressure from all the Powers,\r\n     but would all the Powers put such pressure on him? In all matters\r\n     bearing upon the relations between the Porte and Egypt, it must, I\r\n     am afraid, be taken into consideration that neither France singly,\r\n     nor England singly, nor the two acting together, are likely at the\r\n     present time to exercise predominant influence at Constantinople;\r\n     and that, on the other hand, the Power which does exercise\r\n     predominant influence there shows no disposition to jeopardize that\r\n     influence by giving unpalatable advice, and is not supposed to have\r\n     any desire to promote cordiality between England and France.\r\n\r\n     Moreover, we have to consider not only the Sultan and the\r\n     Khedive, but the mutinous officers and the so-called National Party\r\n     in Egypt. From a telegram which Gambetta showed me yesterday,\r\n     it would appear that Arabi had expressed some idea of appealing\r\n     against England and France to the Great Powers collectively. But\r\n     would he and his party, whose watchword seems to be 'Egypt for\r\n     the Egyptians,' submit passively to the installation of a Foreign\r\n     Commission to settle all the important national questions? Would\r\n     they acquiesce in the subsequent enforcement of the decision of the\r\n     Commission?\r\n\r\n     The Commission might certainly sit at Alexandria, and it\r\n     might perhaps have the support afforded by the presence of an\r\n     Anglo-French squadron, or an International squadron. In either\r\n     case, would the squadron be provided with men to be landed in\r\n     case of need, and would the Commission be authorized to call for\r\n     the assistance and protection of a force to be put on shore? If\r\n     this were so, it might be merely a small beginning which might\r\n     ultimately render intervention in arms on a larger scale inevitable.\r\n\r\n     On the other hand, if the presence of the squadron were to\r\n     be merely a naval demonstration, would the fact of its being more\r\n     or less representative of all the Great Powers give it much more\r\n     weight than if it were made on behalf of England and France alone?\r\n     Would it, in either case, be safe to trust to the moral effect\r\n     of its being sufficient, and to its not rendering further action\r\n     imperative?\r\n\r\n     Gambetta seems to hope that firm and decided language, used\r\n     collectively now by France and England, may ward off a crisis.\r\n     If there be any chance of warding off a necessity for action, it\r\n     no doubt lies in this; but I suppose that with Gambetta the wish\r\n     is father to the thought. On the one hand, in face of the present\r\n     unpopularity of the Tunis expedition, it would be very awkward for\r\n     him to have to send another French force to Africa at the present\r\n     moment. But, on the other hand, he could not confront the mass of\r\n     enraged bondholders if he abandoned their interests; and public\r\n     opinion here, which is very sensitive about Egypt, would not\r\n     tolerate his letting France be openly set at naught in that country.\r\n\r\n     It is needless to add that the French Government would\r\n     bitterly resent it, if any hint were given to a third Power,\r\n     without their having been previously consulted, if there is any\r\n     idea on our part of withdrawing from our separate understanding\r\n     with them, and merging Egypt in the general Eastern Question. If\r\n     they were ever brought to consent to calling in the other Powers,\r\n     they would not readily forgive having their hands forced in the\r\n     matter.\r\n\r\n     For my own part, I would certainly, as regards Egypt, rather\r\n     have to deal with France only than with four or five more Powers.\r\n\r\nThere can be no shadow of doubt that Lord Lyons's view was the correct\r\none, but Lord Granville and Mr. Gladstone (no other member of the\r\nCabinet is mentioned) seem to have hankered after the Concert of Europe,\r\nprobably in consequence of the stroke of luck at Dulcigno.\r\n\r\n     'Your very powerful letter,' Lord Granville wrote on January\r\n     21, 'is gone to Gladstone. It is not easy to find an answer to all\r\n     your arguments. The question is whether there are not stronger\r\n     arguments against any other course. I think it is likely that I\r\n     shall write to you to ask you to speak to Gambetta.\r\n\r\n     'On the imminence of the crisis: the importance of perfect\r\n     union between England and France: our strong objection to intervene\r\n     alone--giving as reasons:--opposition of Egyptians; of Turkey;\r\n     jealousy of Europe; responsibility of governing a country of\r\n     Orientals without adequate means and under adverse circumstances;\r\n     presumption that France would object as much to our sole occupation\r\n     as we should object to theirs.\r\n\r\n     'Have carefully considered joint occupation; some of the\r\n     objections to sole occupation lessened, but others most seriously\r\n     aggravated.\r\n\r\n     'Deprecate Turkish intervention, but think it a lesser evil\r\n     than the two to which I have alluded, giving some reasons.\r\n\r\n     'Then propose the European element, as sketched out in my\r\n     private letter.\r\n\r\n     'Any concessions to Europe after any demonstrations on the\r\n     part of the German powers and Italy would place us in a false\r\n     position; but if made spontaneously and jointly by France and\r\n     England, would not have that inconvenience.\r\n\r\n     'Please reflect upon the way such arguments might best be put,\r\n     but let me have all your opinions upon it.\r\n\r\n     'Such able letters as your last are very valuable.'\r\n\r\nAnother letter written on the same day asks for advice as to what should\r\nbe done 'if the crisis arrives, as is probable, in a week.' It was very\r\nevident that the Cabinet had no definite plan of their own, and were\r\nonly too glad of the opportunity of consulting some one whose opinion\r\nwas worth having.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, January 22, 1882.\r\n\r\n     I have received this morning your two letters of yesterday\r\n     about Egypt; and I have reconsidered the letters from me of the\r\n     19th to which they are answers.\r\n\r\n     There exists at this moment one new difficulty, the\r\n     uncertainty whether Gambetta will still be in office this day week.\r\n\r\n     I do not, however, find in this circumstance any reason to\r\n     modify the views expressed in my long letter.\r\n\r\n     Whoever may be in office here at the time, if we proposed to\r\n     call in the other Powers, we should be held (to use Commercial\r\n     Treaty slang) to have 'denounced' our good understanding with\r\n     France. We should be reproached with deserting our comrade at the\r\n     critical moment, and I am seriously afraid that for a long time\r\n     the feeling in France towards England would be bitter, and the\r\n     relations of the French Government towards the English Government\r\n     more than cold.\r\n\r\n     In my communication to the French Government respecting Egypt,\r\n     there are some topics in particular which would require delicate\r\n     handling.\r\n\r\n     First of these, I should mention Turkish intervention. This\r\n     has been a subject of difference between France and England for\r\n     half a century, and the French have a traditional feeling on\r\n     the subject at all times. But at this moment they (rightly or\r\n     wrongly) think it a matter of vital importance to them with regard\r\n     to Algeria and Tunis, and they would go very great lengths to\r\n     resist the introduction of the Turkish Troops into Egypt, or the\r\n     increase of Turkish influence there. They always suspect us of\r\n     hankering after Turkish support against them, not reflecting that\r\n     our influence at Constantinople is not so predominant as when they\r\n     supported Mehemet Ali against the Porte and England.\r\n\r\n     Another topic on which the French might be sensitive would be\r\n     the question of governing a country of Orientals. This is a matter\r\n     on which I feel strongly myself, but it would need to be dealt with\r\n     very cautiously, or the French would see in it a sneer against\r\n     their own shortcomings in Tunis and even in Algeria.\r\n\r\n     The objections to joint dual occupation are strong, but almost\r\n     any statement of them would apply with equal force, or more, to\r\n     joint sextuple occupation, or to the occupation by two Powers as\r\n     mandatories of the rest.\r\n\r\n     Malet, I see, telegraphs that the Chamber would, he thinks,\r\n     listen to the united Great Powers, but would not listen to England\r\n     and France alone.\r\n\r\n     Admitting that Malet is right (and he generally is right),\r\n     there always remains the difficulty as to putting this cumbersome\r\n     six-wheeled waggon into motion in any reasonable time.\r\n\r\n     And this brings me to the question in your second letter, what\r\n     course should I recommend, if the crisis, as is probable, arises in\r\n     a week.\r\n\r\n     It seems to me that in that case either things must be let\r\n     'slide,' or England and France must take some step together,\r\n     without waiting for the other Powers.\r\n\r\nAll the anxious speculations which had taken place with regard to\r\nGambetta's future foreign policy turned out to be quite unnecessary, for\r\non January 27, after little more than two months of office, he resigned,\r\nhaving been defeated, like any ordinary political mediocrity, on a\r\nquestion of domestic interest. His place was taken by M. de Freycinet,\r\nwho succeeded in forming a respectable Ministry, but whose policy with\r\nregard to Egypt was as vague and undecided as that of the British\r\nGovernment, and whose views with regard to a Commercial Treaty were\r\nsupposed to be identical with those of his predecessor.\r\n\r\nAdvantage was taken of the change by Lord Granville to again urge the\r\nsubstitution of the Concert of Europe for purely Anglo-French control in\r\nEgypt, and Freycinet showed himself much more amenable than Gambetta.\r\nAs far as can be gathered, the attitude of both Governments was the\r\nreverse of heroic; the British Government was anxious to hand over its\r\nresponsibility to other parties, and the French Government was not\r\ndisposed to take any initiative at all. The French were, in fact,\r\nwaiting for England to make a suggestion, and while perhaps ready to act\r\nin conjunction, wished that the responsibility of whatever proceedings\r\nwere adopted in common, should rest primarily, if not exclusively, upon\r\nEngland. The Tunis enterprise had proved to be so much more troublesome\r\nand expensive than had been expected, that the Government shrank from\r\nbecoming involved in anything of the same nature in Egypt. But the\r\ncondition of affairs in Egypt was such that even the timid Freycinet\r\nGovernment might find its hand forced. An insult to a French functionary\r\nmight produce an outbreak of Chauvinism which would force the Government\r\nto send a force to avenge it, and Gambetta would certainly have had a\r\nforce ready for a contingency of this kind.\r\n\r\nNubar Pasha was in Paris at the time, and his views on the Egyptian\r\nsituation were not without interest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 7, 1882.\r\n\r\n     I do not find the least diminution of the French opposition to\r\n     Turkish intervention in Egypt, even if it were only moral.\r\n\r\n     Nubar has been here for some months, and often comes to see\r\n     me. His first object in life seems to be to get Blignières out\r\n     of Egypt, and his second to get Tewfik deposed. I conclude that\r\n     he thinks that both are obstacles to his own return to power.\r\n     His language is, that the dictation of the English and French\r\n     Controllers in Egypt was more than any country could bear; that the\r\n     present state of things is much better; office and power being in\r\n     the same hands; that Arabi Bey and his compeers will do very well\r\n     if they are properly managed, and that two quiet, conciliatory\r\n     (perhaps we should read imbecile) Controllers would keep everything\r\n     straight. I think he inclines to the moral intervention of the\r\n     Sultan. He seems to be intriguing with Germany. He had an interview\r\n     with Freycinet, to whom, according to his own account, he held the\r\n     language I have described above. He talks more ably than any one\r\n     else about Egypt, but always with a view to his own interests.\r\n\r\nAny one who ever conversed with the late Nubar Pasha could not fail to\r\nbe impressed with his ability, but like many other able Orientals, he\r\nwas a consummate intriguer, and probably the predominant feeling in his\r\nmind was a desire to be reinstated in power. It should be explained\r\nthat, at this time, Arabi was already practically at the head of the\r\nGovernment, although only occupying the post of Minister of War, and\r\nthat M. de Blignières was still French Controller. M. de Blignières,\r\nhowever, resigned his post on March 12, and an open letter[35] from him\r\nto M. Clémenceau threw a lurid light on the tortuous and inexplicable\r\ncourse of French policy in Egypt.\r\n\r\n     'Lorsqu'il (Cherif Pasha) a du quitter le pouvoir; lorsque j'ai\r\n     compris que les chefs du parti militaire, qui l'avaient renversé,\r\n     pouvaient compter sur la bienveillance de notre gouvernement,\r\n     ce jour-là, ne me faisant aucune illusion sur les conséquences\r\n     nécessaires de cette politique nouvelle, j'ai résigné mes\r\n     fonctions.'\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, M. de Blignières was correct, the French were playing\r\na double game; ostensibly acting in concert with England against the\r\nNationalist agitation in Egypt, while secretly encouraging Arabi and his\r\nfriends to persevere in their efforts. In one respect, however, they\r\nwere consistent, namely in their opposition to Turkish intervention, and\r\nthe traditional French opposition to Turkish influence in Egypt was\r\naccentuated in consequence of the recent events in Tunis and Algeria.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, April 4, 1882.\r\n\r\n     You will have seen by the despatches I sent you by post\r\n     yesterday that Freycinet has at last put the dots on his i's, and\r\n     distinctly proposed that Tewfik shall be deposed and Halim put\r\n     in his place. I cannot say I take to the idea. As you said to\r\n     Tissot, there might be some good in it if Halim had great moral and\r\n     intellectual qualities. But I don't see that we have any reason\r\n     to suppose he has such qualities. Nor indeed, if he had, do I see\r\n     how his mere appointment would at once set things straight in\r\n     Egypt. The removal of Ismail was a great blow to the prestige of\r\n     the Khediviate, and it would require a genius to re-establish its\r\n     authority, if another deposition takes place in so short a time.\r\n     I do not understand how Freycinet reconciles his present idea\r\n     with his objection to Turkish interference. If the Khedive is in\r\n     daily fear of being deposed by the Sultan, there will be abject\r\n     submission to Yildiz Kiosk and a constant flow of backsheesh to the\r\n     Porte.\r\n\r\n     Halim no doubt promises the French that he will be their man,\r\n     and if he becomes so, they may go great lengths to support him; but\r\n     how will this suit us? And how long will it be before it leads to\r\n     something very like armed intervention of the French in support of\r\n     him?\r\n\r\n     Then it seems to me that to depose Tewfik would be something\r\n     very like treachery, after the dual declaration made to him in\r\n     January.\r\n\r\n     It seems to me that the things to aim at should be: to keep\r\n     Tewfik; to give him some strength against military dictation, and\r\n     to preserve the Anglo-French Control, which means a reasonable\r\n     financial administration, and gives us at any rate some means of\r\n     knowing what the Egyptians (perhaps I ought to add) what the French\r\n     are about.\r\n\r\nThe immoral proposal to depose Tewfik met with no encouragement from\r\nHer Majesty's Government, as was only to be expected, and the only\r\nconclusion to be drawn from the equivocal language of M. de Freycinet\r\nwas that he felt armed intervention to be inevitable, but wanted the\r\nproposal to come from England. He tried to persuade Lord Lyons to\r\npropose a plan of his own which should be put forward privately, but\r\nthis met with no approval at all. '\"Private and between ourselves\r\nconversations,\" between Ambassadors and Foreign Ministers generally\r\ncause mischief.'\r\n\r\nAs the situation in Egypt continued to get worse, the British Government\r\nwas forced to take some action, and accordingly suggested that three\r\ngenerals, French, English, and Turkish, should be sent to Egypt 'to\r\nrestore discipline to the Egyptian army.' As it was not proposed that\r\nthese generals should employ anything but moral force, it is difficult\r\nto see how they could have succeeded, but Lord Granville appears to have\r\nconsidered that it would obviate armed interference, and the French\r\nGovernment having no plan of their own were presumably ready to accept\r\nalmost anything, but caused considerable embarrassment by asking for a\r\npledge that Turkish intervention by force of arms, in any circumstances,\r\nwould not be tolerated. What Freycinet wanted, in fact, was to be able\r\nto declare to the Chamber that England and France were agreed not to\r\nallow armed Ottoman intervention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 5, 1882.\r\n\r\n     Freycinet asked me just now to let him speak to me 'privately\r\n     and academically' about intervention in Egypt. He said his great\r\n     objection to Turkish intervention was that as matters now stand,\r\n     it would take place for a vague and indefinite object: that thus\r\n     it would be impossible to fix the exact time at which that object\r\n     would be accomplished, and that thus the Turks would have pretexts\r\n     for prolonging it indefinitely, for mixing themselves up in the\r\n     administration, for laying their hands on the Treasury, and what\r\n     not.\r\n\r\n     If the intervention was simply for installing a new Khedive,\r\n     his objections would be less. This would be a single definite\r\n     sovereign act of the Sultan. It might be accomplished in a week or\r\n     ten days, and the Ottoman troops would have no pretext for staying,\r\n     or for interfering in the administration. He should not object to a\r\n     Turkish, French, and English fleet going to Egypt to support some\r\n     single definite act of this kind, nor even, speaking solely for\r\n     himself personally, to Turkish troops being landed.\r\n\r\n     After some questioning from me, he said that, for a single\r\n     definite object, he personally might even prefer a Turkish\r\n     intervention, but that for any such vague purpose as supporting\r\n     Tewfik and restoring order, he thought Turkish intervention\r\n     absolutely inadmissible. If anything of that kind was to be\r\n     attempted, Anglo-French seemed to him the least open to objection.\r\n     Italian seemed to him to be worse than Turkish.\r\n\r\n     His idea was that we should set on foot some Government that\r\n     could stand by itself. Under Tewfik no such Government would in his\r\n     opinion be ever possible. He had no predilection for any particular\r\n     individual as Khedive: all he wanted was to have some reasonably\r\n     efficient man at the head of the Government.\r\n\r\n     He begged me to consider all this as strictly confidential,\r\n     personal, private, and academic; and he said that except in a\r\n     conversation of this character, he could not even have mentioned\r\n     the possibility of France consenting under any conceivable\r\n     circumstances to Turkish intervention; for he was by no means sure\r\n     that it would ever be agreed to by his colleagues or borne by\r\n     public opinion.\r\n\r\nThe 'confidential, personal, private, and academic' character of M. de\r\nFreycinet's conversation was, of course, merely intended to conceal\r\nhis own vacillation and fear of having to communicate to the Chambers\r\nany announcement that he had sanctioned Turkish intervention in any\r\nshape whatever. A little later, however, he nerved himself to make a\r\nproposal that there should be a joint Anglo-French Naval Demonstration\r\noff Alexandria. An allied squadron consequently proceeded to that\r\nport, and its appearance produced a temporary panic in the ranks of\r\nthe Nationalists; the latter, however, speedily recovered when it was\r\nrealized that there were no troops on board, and that the Sultan, far\r\nfrom approving of the demonstration, had protested against it. The\r\nultimatum of the allies was practically rejected, and Arabi, who had\r\nbeen compelled to resign, was reinstated in office nominally as Minister\r\nof War, in reality as dictator. To make Freycinet's position still\r\nworse, he got into difficulties in the Chamber.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 26, 1882.\r\n\r\n     The explosion has come, and if the irritation that prevails\r\n     in Paris to-day continues, Freycinet will be out of office, or\r\n     will, _per fas et nefas_, back out of his proposal that Turkish\r\n     intervention may be resorted to in Egypt. His Chauvin speech in the\r\n     Chamber about French preponderance, and what not, is now of course\r\n     turned against him.\r\n\r\n     There is an impression here that in order to keep Gambetta out\r\n     of office, Bismarck may help Freycinet to eat his words.\r\n\r\n     I am afraid that now, whether Freycinet stays in or goes out,\r\n     it will be next to impossible to have any comfortable understanding\r\n     with France about intervention in Egypt.\r\n\r\n     Even supposing all the other Powers cordially united with\r\n     us, to repeat the experiment of 1840 would be dangerous, and would\r\n     produce a scarcely ever to be remedied coldness (to call it by a\r\n     mild name) between us and France.\r\n\r\n     Then I share all Dufferin's misgivings as to the possibility\r\n     of either controlling the Turks if they set foot in Egypt, or of\r\n     ever getting them out. I have also a very strong fear of my own as\r\n     to the mischief they would do to the country. Even if they went\r\n     with the acquiescence of France, I think we should be constantly in\r\n     hot water with the French as long as they stayed.\r\n\r\n     If Gambetta comes in he will no doubt again propose joint\r\n     Anglo-French intervention. Unless the Porte is backed up very\r\n     strongly indeed, he will very likely make its intervention in Egypt\r\n     something like a _casus belli_ with Turkey--or in fact do as the\r\n     French did with regard to Tunis--declare that he will oppose by\r\n     force the despatch of Turkish troops to Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-French Naval Demonstration had been intended as a compromise\r\nbetween the two Governments over the question of Turkish intervention,\r\nbut when it was seen to be useless, it was agreed that the Sultan should\r\nbe asked to send a Special Commission to Cairo, and communications were\r\nmade to the other Powers with a view to convoking a European Conference\r\non Egypt; M. de Freycinet, who had for three months opposed the English\r\nproposal for Turkish intervention, suddenly discovering that there was\r\nno danger about it, if requested jointly by England and France. The\r\nTurkish Commission which proceeded to Egypt was not more successful in\r\nrestoring order than the Anglo-French Naval Demonstration. It consisted\r\nof three persons; one of whom, Dervish Pasha, was instructed to support\r\nthe Khedive and to threaten the Nationalist leaders; the second\r\nCommissioner was instructed to support Arabi and his associates; and\r\nthe duty of the third Commissioner was to spy upon his two colleagues.\r\nIn order to make everything quite safe, the latter was accompanied by a\r\nfourth official, whose duty it was to spy upon him, and it was perhaps\r\nowing to these over-elaborated precautions that the mission proved to be\r\na complete failure.\r\n\r\nOn June 11, the massacre at Alexandria took place, and armed\r\nintervention became more and more inevitable, but some Governments still\r\nentertained the hope that diplomacy might yet be successful, and the\r\nConference assembled at Constantinople towards the end of the month.\r\nThe chief advantage of the Conference was that it disclosed the views\r\nof the various Great Powers, and the conditions which were to govern\r\nthe despatch of Turkish troops to Egypt were of so engrossing a nature\r\nthat they were still being discussed when the battle of Tel-el-Kebir\r\nwas fought two months subsequently, and the victorious British troops\r\nentered Cairo.\r\n\r\nThe vacillations and dilatoriness of M. de Freycinet irritated even the\r\neasy-going Lord Granville, who complained of having twice been put in\r\na hole by him, and was justifiably anxious as to how he could defend\r\nhis Egyptian policy successfully in Parliament if the French Government\r\ncould not be relied upon for any consistent line of action. But while\r\nadmitting that nearly everything had gone wrong up till now, and that\r\nthe failure of the Sultan's Special Mission made the outlook still more\r\ngloomy, he consoled himself with the reflection (which was shortly\r\nafterwards shown in one respect to be quite erroneous) that, 'we have\r\navoided a rupture with France, a rupture with Europe, and a possible\r\nwar.' Within a few weeks, the error of this last assumption was to be\r\nconclusively established.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, June 20, 1882.\r\n\r\n     I do not hope much from the Conference: certainly I have very\r\n     little expectation of its forwarding the strong measures which the\r\n     Alexandria massacres seem to me to call for imperatively.\r\n\r\n     I think Germany will be very little inclined to urge the\r\n     despatch of Turkish troops. Bismarck's great object appears to be\r\n     to keep Freycinet in, and he fears, not without some reason, that\r\n     when the first Turkish soldier sets his foot in Egypt, Freycinet\r\n     will fall at Paris.\r\n\r\n     The Freycinet Ministry would probably be succeeded by a\r\n     Cabinet in which Gambetta would not actually have a seat, but\r\n     over which he would exercise very great influence. Bismarck very\r\n     probably exaggerates the strength of that influence and looks for\r\n     more direct hostility to Germany than it would really provoke. But\r\n     he is perhaps right in thinking that, under Gambetta's influence,\r\n     France would coquet with the Anti-German party in Russia, and would\r\n     lose no opportunity of fostering enmity to Germany whenever she\r\n     could find an opening for doing so. At all events, it would be\r\n     impossible for Germany to feel as much at her ease as she does now,\r\n     if Gambetta were the virtual director of French policy.\r\n\r\n     Freycinet's strength lies partly in the disinclination of the\r\n     nation for anything like what it calls adventures, but mainly in\r\n     the dread which the present Chamber has of Gambetta, the Scrutin de\r\n     Liste and a dissolution.\r\n\r\n     Meanwhile general dissatisfaction with the whole state of\r\n     things, and despondency do not diminish. People who looked to\r\n     Gambetta as the man to set things straight are directing their eyes\r\n     to other quarters, and there is even a sort of revival of Orleanism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A few hours after this letter reaches you, you will in\r\n     all probability receive from me by telegraph the French answer to\r\n     the proposal to them to concert measures with us for the protection\r\n     of the Suez Canal. I don't think Freycinet likes the idea of\r\n     anything which may tend towards sending French troops to Egypt.\r\n     He seems to me to want to lean on the Conference in the hope that\r\n     by so doing, he may be able to stand quite still. Strange to say,\r\n     the Chamber and the public seem to be in the same mood. They like\r\n     to think that it is more upon England than upon them that the\r\n     discredit of putting up with the Alexandria massacre and the recent\r\n     patch up in Egypt would fall. Their present pusillanimity seems so\r\n     unnatural that I cannot think it will last. Gambetta will rouse\r\n     them from it, if he has the chance.\r\n\r\nThey are full of suspicions of designs on our part to seize the Suez\r\nCanal with or without the assistance or connivance of Turkey. You will\r\nsee by a telegram I have just sent, that Freycinet has asked me a\r\nquestion about this. I imagine the French would object very much less to\r\nour acting entirely alone than to our acting in any way with the Porte.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan seems to tell de Noailles all kinds of stories against\r\nEngland and Dufferin. It is not, however, from Freycinet that I hear\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nIn Lord Lyons's opinion, the French, at this stage, were quite prepared\r\nfor England acting alone in Egypt, but he considered that it was most\r\nimportant to be very frank with them, to afford them every opportunity\r\nof joining us, but to do it in such a way that other Powers should not\r\nbe given too much time in which to raise objections.\r\n\r\nIt was not apparently until June 27, 1882, that the British Government\r\nseriously considered the probability of having to employ 'material\r\nforce' in Egypt, whether alone or in concert with other Powers; but\r\nin consequence of the danger of the situation and of the necessity of\r\nacting quickly, they then applied to the War Office for information as\r\nto what forces were available for an expedition. In view of our alleged\r\nmilitary capacity at the present time, it is of interest to learn what\r\nthe War Office was prepared to do thirty-one years ago. The military\r\nauthorities stated that they were prepared to embark within twenty-four\r\nhours, 3500 infantry, and 500 garrison artillerymen, with a small siege\r\ntrain, from Malta and Gibraltar, with necessary camp equipage and\r\nreserves of food and ammunition. These troops could be conveyed in the\r\nships of the Channel Squadron now in the Mediterranean. A force of about\r\n12,000 fighting men, complete in infantry, cavalry, and field artillery,\r\nwith forty-eight field guns, was also available, to embark from England.\r\nThe first 5000 of the infantry could sail within a week, and the whole\r\nforce could leave England in a fortnight from the date of the order,\r\nwith complete supplies for an army in the field. The force from England\r\nwould be made up partially by the First Class Army Reserve, and a\r\nBrigade was also available to be sent from Bombay to Suez. Such was the\r\npurport of a most confidential communication to Lord Granville from the\r\nWar Office, dated June 27, 1882.\r\n\r\nOn July 11, the bombardment of Alexandria by the British fleet took\r\nplace; the departure of the French ships marking, in an unmistakeable\r\nform, the refusal of the French Government to incur further\r\nresponsibility, and foreshadowing the permanent renunciation of the old\r\nFrench position in Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe news of the Alexandria bombardment, which, owing to the absence\r\nof troops for landing, could hardly be described as a very effective\r\noperation, was received without much excitement in Paris, and Freycinet\r\nstated that the Chamber would certainly not have sanctioned the\r\nco-operation of the French fleet. The main point on which sensitiveness\r\nwas shown was the Suez Canal. The French seemed disposed to resent any\r\nlanding of English troops alone at Port Said, and to insist, if not\r\non joining with us, on sending a 'lateral' expedition of their own.\r\nIt was important, therefore, that they should be given a _bona fide_\r\ninvitation to join in anything we might determine to do, and the French\r\nwere accordingly invited by Lord Granville to concert measures at once\r\nfor the protection of the canal; questions of detail being left to\r\nthe Conference at Constantinople. Upon the whole the bombardment of\r\nAlexandria had tended to improve rather than to impair Anglo-French\r\nrelations, and the chief danger seemed to lie in the projected Turkish\r\nintervention, which would alienate public opinion and provoke strong\r\nopposition from Gambetta and his followers. Extraordinary French Naval\r\nCredits were voted and Lord Granville appears to have thought that joint\r\naction was secured after all, at least as far as the Canal was concerned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Granville to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    July 19, 1882.\r\n\r\n     I wish you and ourselves joy of the renewed _entente\r\n     cordiale_. It will not be popular in many quarters here, but it is\r\n     an immense national advantage, and ought to relieve us from many\r\n     dangers.\r\n\r\n     I am not in the least jealous of the dual action in the Canal,\r\n     though I should prefer its being triangular. But I own I dread it,\r\n     if we are obliged, as is probable, to intervene in Egypt itself.\r\n\r\n     I hope they do not think we are pressing them too fast. I\r\n     believe the Cabinet will settle to send 15,000 men to Malta. If so,\r\n     I will let you know.\r\n\r\n     Remember I am always grateful for suggestions and criticisms.\r\n     I hear Bismarck is really ill and cannot sleep at night. The\r\n     preparation of his own financial measures does not act as an\r\n     anodyne.\r\n\r\n     I am told that the debate in the Commons last night did us\r\n     good and not harm. I suppose we shall have a more formidable one in\r\n     the Lords.\r\n\r\n     It is rumoured that the Peers will pass the Second Reading of\r\n     the Arrears Bill, and mutilate it in Committee.\r\n\r\nThe voting of the extraordinary French Naval Credits, which had caused\r\nit to be supposed that the French Government intended to take some\r\ndecided action, was soon shown to mean nothing at all. Freycinet, whose\r\nposition had been much shaken, was in the uncomfortable situation of\r\nbeing blamed by the Chamber for doing too much and denounced in the\r\nSenate for not doing enough. On July 19, an important debate took place\r\nin the Chamber, during which Gambetta, with his accustomed eloquence,\r\nadjured the Government to adhere to the English alliance at all costs,\r\nand urged that to quarrel with England would be the most fatal of\r\nmistakes. The Credits asked for were agreed to, and the Government\r\nobtained a large majority; but when Freycinet appeared in support of his\r\nmodest proposals before the Senate, he was obliged to admit that the\r\nConference at Constantinople had refused to entrust France and England\r\nwith a Mandate, and that in consequence of this refusal the French\r\nGovernment would leave England to act alone, and would confine their own\r\naction to the protection of the Suez Canal. A fresh credit amounting to\r\nabout £350,000 was asked for with this object, but met with formidable\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 26, 1882.\r\n\r\n     When I saw Freycinet this afternoon he seemed in absolute\r\n     despair. There are two modes of escape which are supposed to be\r\n     still open.\r\n\r\n     Though the majority of the Chamber are strongly opposed to\r\n     military intervention in Egypt, they may still hesitate to turn\r\n     Freycinet out, lest by showing it to be impossible to make their\r\n     own existence compatible with anything like a stable Government in\r\n     France, they may bring about a dissolution.\r\n\r\n     It is said that they are casting about for some means of\r\n     refusing the Credit and yet not turning out Freycinet; and the\r\n     second device, which might enable Freycinet to stay in, is the\r\n     singularly undignified one of his playing into their hand, by\r\n     declaring that he does not make the Credit a Cabinet question, and\r\n     that if it be refused, he will bow to the will of the Chamber and\r\n     withdraw from the protection of the Canal.\r\n\r\n     So long as it is undeniable that we have _bona fide_ invited\r\n     and pressed France to take part in all our operations in Egypt, I\r\n     shall not break my heart if she chooses to decline to do so.\r\n\r\n     I believe that Freycinet would have been in a better plight\r\n     if he had taken a decided course either way; if he had distinctly\r\n     refused all intervention, or if he had boldly joined England in all\r\n     her operations.\r\n\r\nOn July 29, the question of voting the fresh Credit was brought forward\r\nin the Chamber and made one of confidence in the Ministry. Every one\r\nby this time was much alarmed at the prospect of France being dragged\r\ninto some vague and desperate adventure; the Credit was refused by an\r\noverwhelming majority; Freycinet resigned office, and France definitely\r\nretired from the scene of action.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 30, 1882.\r\n\r\n     Among the innumerable Ministerial crises which I have seen\r\n     here, I do not recollect one in which there has been so much\r\n     uncertainty as to who would be the new Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n     Grévy, in conformity with his own views, and with those of\r\n     the great majority of the Chamber and indeed of the country, is\r\n     trying to form an absolutely non-intervention Cabinet. But such a\r\n     Cabinet might have difficulties with the Senate. Léon Say and Jules\r\n     Ferry, the most able members of the late Ministry, were for full\r\n     intervention and the English Alliance.\r\n\r\n     Freycinet very unwisely began with a perfectly idle dispute\r\n     with Gambetta as to whether the English Government would, or would\r\n     not, have consented to armed intervention with France only, if\r\n     Gambetta had remained in power. Gambetta did not speak yesterday,\r\n     but he and his followers voted against Freycinet.\r\n\r\n     Hohenlohe seemed, I hear, dreadfully put out by the result of\r\n     the division yesterday. It was Bismarck's communication which gave\r\n     Freycinet the _coup de grâce_. Hohenlohe had evidently hoped that\r\n     it would save him, by giving him an excuse for withdrawing the Bill.\r\n\r\n     I was very much disappointed to hear from Freycinet that\r\n     Russia had gone back to the Conference. I hoped her retirement\r\n     would have given us a good opportunity of freeing ourselves from\r\n     that cumbrous clog.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Aug. 1, 1882.\r\n\r\n     All is still uncertain as to who the new French Ministers\r\n     will be. Grévy is doing his best to keep Freycinet, and Hohenlohe\r\n     is working in the same direction, which is not wise. Hitherto\r\n     Freycinet has positively declined, but he is a man who sometimes\r\n     changes his mind. He will be in an extraordinarily false position\r\n     if he does come back. Grévy may, perhaps, manage to appoint a\r\n     warming-pan sort of Ministry, just to keep the offices warm during\r\n     the recess and to make room for something more serious in October.\r\n\r\n     The French are in very good disposition towards us at this\r\n     moment. The way to keep them so will be to endeavour to make their\r\n     present position comfortable to them, without being humiliating,\r\n     and, above all, not to crow over them, as part of our press seems\r\n     too much inclined to do. Their fleet, next to our own, is the most\r\n     important factor in the Mediterranean question. We can do as well\r\n     or better, without any aid from France or other countries, but we\r\n     ought to have the field to ourselves.\r\n\r\n     I wish we were well rid of that dangerous Conference. I had\r\n     a sort of hope that just now it might have a sort of use, as a\r\n     means of letting the other Powers talk while we were acting. But in\r\n     fact, as worked by Bismarck and by the Turks under his direction,\r\n     it seems merely to supply the machinery for formally placing us in\r\n     opposition to the so-called European Concert, and for embarrassing\r\n     France. I think the French would be glad to be delivered from it.\r\n\r\n     Public opinion in France is at this moment friendly to us, but\r\n     it is in a very susceptible state.\r\n\r\nA new Ministry was in course of time formed under M. Duclerc, one of\r\nthe many uninteresting mediocrities who have governed France during the\r\nlast forty years, and a sort of formula was agreed upon that there was\r\nno 'solution of continuity in the Entente,' which was not intended to\r\ncommit the French to anything in particular.\r\n\r\nA vast amount has been written respecting the events in Egypt in 1882;\r\nmuch of it by persons who occupied responsible and important positions\r\nat the time; but the reasons for the inaction and eventual retirement\r\nof the French have never been clearly explained. Probably the French\r\nthemselves would be unable to give a satisfactory explanation, and\r\nwould attribute their inglorious attitude to the Freycinet Government,\r\nwhich did not know its own mind. But it may be assumed that a variety\r\nof reasons were responsible for the French refusal of co-operation with\r\nEngland. Had the invitation been received some months earlier, it would\r\nprobably have been accepted with enthusiasm; but the Tunis expedition,\r\nwhich had opened with so much success and enthusiasm, had proved a much\r\nmore troublesome and unsatisfactory business than had been anticipated,\r\nand had created a decided disinclination for further enterprises in\r\nNorth Africa. In the second place, the difficulties of an Egyptian\r\ncampaign were greatly over-estimated; the French calculation was that\r\nno less than 60,000 men would be necessary, and the ordinary French\r\nMinister would not venture to allow so many men to leave the country.\r\nLastly, the French were quite unable, rightly or wrongly, to get it out\r\nof their minds that they were being deliberately led into a trap by\r\nBismarck, and this by itself was sufficient to daunt a Government of the\r\nFreycinet type.\r\n\r\nFrance having now definitely declined, the British invitation was\r\ntransferred to Italy.\r\n\r\n     'We have asked the Italians to join us,' Lord Granville wrote\r\n     on July 27, 'but we have not pressed them. They also will try to\r\n     _se faire prier_, and will be too late. I told Menabrea I could not\r\n     delay operations.\r\n\r\n     'I hope they will decline, but I myself was not very hot for\r\n     even the offer. But the balance of argument seemed to be in favour\r\n     of it, and you did not raise any objection to it.\r\n\r\n     'Please explain that the _Times_ is entirely off the track as\r\n     to our wish for a protectorate.'\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the Italians was welcome and not unexpected, and as\r\nno other Power was in the least inclined to co-operate, the British\r\nGovernment was able to set about the task of smashing Arabi with a clear\r\nconscience, in its own way, and unhampered by allies; for the Turks, who\r\nhad agreed to send troops, protracted the negotiations with regard to\r\ntheir employment to such an extent, that the campaign was finished long\r\nbefore an agreement was arrived at.\r\n\r\nLord Cromer in his well-known work 'Modern Egypt,' has exposed with\r\nmuch skill and lucidity the futile nature of many of the proposals\r\nput forward by the British and French Governments during the period\r\nthat they were acting together. But the really remarkable fact is,\r\nthat each Government succeeded in bringing about the result which it\r\nleast desired. The policy of the British Government was governed by a\r\nsincere, if mistaken, determination not to be dragged into assuming\r\nsole responsibility for Egypt, and in particular to avoid the necessity\r\nof military occupation. The efforts of the French Government were\r\nchiefly directed towards the prevention of Turkey or any other Power\r\nestablishing its predominant influence in Egypt, and that French policy\r\nshould have unconsciously and involuntarily thrust England into this\r\nunsought and unwelcome position is one of the real ironies of recent\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most fortunate event for England during the crisis which\r\npreceded the Egyptian expedition was the fall of Gambetta early in the\r\nyear. Had that statesman remained in office he would certainly have\r\nnever consented to remain a supine and indifferent spectator; he would\r\nundoubtedly have insisted on France taking an active part: a joint\r\nexpedition would have taken place, and the sequel might have followed\r\nthe Schleswig-Holstein precedent.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly to be expected that the skill and rapidity with which the\r\ncampaign against Arabi was conducted would evoke much enthusiasm in\r\nFrance, nor could the French reasonably expect that upon the restoration\r\nof peace and order the old state of things would be renewed. Before the\r\nend of October Lord Granville informed the French Ambassador in London\r\nthat the Control would not be restored; and when the French Government\r\nobjected, on the ground that such an alteration must be submitted to the\r\nPowers, it was pointed out the matter was one for the Khedive to decide\r\nhimself. In order to soothe wounded French feelings various compromises\r\nin the shape of posts in the Egyptian administration were offered in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Nov. 3, 1882.\r\n\r\n     I thought it simpler and better to let Duclerc have a copy of\r\n     your despatch, as you had no objection to my doing so. He has not\r\n     yet given any sign of life since he received it.\r\n\r\n     The argument that the Financial Adviser will have only a small\r\n     position in Egypt, or at all events a less important position than\r\n     the Controllers, cuts both ways here. Duclerc's line is to say that\r\n     we are making a distinction without any real difference: that in\r\n     practice the adviser will have all and more than all the powers of\r\n     the Controllers; and that thus virtually France is to be deprived\r\n     of her share in the Control without receiving, even nominally, any\r\n     compensation.\r\n\r\n     A complaint of a very different kind is made by the 'Haute\r\n     Finance.' They say that the only real compensation which could be\r\n     given to France, if she is to be ousted from the Control, would\r\n     be the establishment, under the auspices and responsibility of\r\n     England, of such a strong practical supervision of the Egyptian\r\n     Administration as would make the regular payment of the Debt\r\n     and the maintenance of the commercial and other interests of\r\n     foreigners secure. They pretend that the proposed establishment\r\n     of the Financial Adviser is in form injurious to the dignity of\r\n     France, while in substance it does not sufficiently provide for the\r\n     control by any one of the Egyptian Government. These seem to be the\r\n     opinions of a very influential body here. It is quite consistent\r\n     with them that Dufferin's mission should be looked on with favour\r\n     by those who hold them.\r\n\r\n     Clémenceau's views seem to be confined to himself.\r\n\r\n     The thing most favourable to our coming to an understanding\r\n     with France, is the very general belief among Frenchmen that\r\n     Bismarck is egging indirectly both England and France on to a\r\n     quarrel.\r\n\r\n     In the meantime the alarm caused by the anarchists is enough\r\n     to keep the minds of the great majority of the French fixed\r\n     on their own internal affairs. People are sending away their\r\n     securities and other valuables to foreign countries. I suppose an\r\n     absolute outbreak in force enough to resist the Government, if the\r\n     Government be resolute, is not to be expected. But there may be\r\n     explosions of dynamite here and there, and the employment of the\r\n     other new-fangled means of creating panic which the French seem to\r\n     be inclined to adopt from the Russians.\r\n\r\n     The competition of America and other causes are producing\r\n     a curious change in the French peasantry, and a change not\r\n     favourable to peace and order. The tenacity with which the very\r\n     small proprietors have hitherto clung to their land is visibly\r\n     diminishing. They now offer their land for sale to an extent\r\n     hitherto quite unprecedented. They say that they can get better\r\n     interest by putting the price of the land into the funds or other\r\n     speculations, and can thus lead a pleasant life, instead of\r\n     slaving from morning to night to get a bare subsistence out of\r\n     their fields. The tendency of all this is to reduce the numbers\r\n     of the hitherto ultra-Conservative laborious class, and to fill\r\n     the towns more and more with idle and very often disappointed and\r\n     discontented speculators, who form a material ready to the hand of\r\n     anarchists.\r\n\r\nThe letters from Lord Granville show that although the British\r\nGovernment had embarked most unwillingly upon the Egyptian enterprise,\r\nand viewed additional responsibility with so much horror that some\r\nmembers of the Cabinet were even opposed to the office of Financial\r\nAdviser to the Egyptian Government being given to an Englishman, yet\r\nthat the Cabinet was at all events unanimously against the maintenance\r\nof the Control, and of the old dual arrangements. The French Government,\r\nwith an entire absence of logic and common sense, was quite indisposed\r\nto recognize the complete change in the situation which had taken place,\r\nand continued to claim that England and France should remain on an\r\nequality as regarded themselves, and in a superior position as far as\r\nthe other Powers were concerned. The difficulty lay in discovering some\r\nmeans of satisfying French vanity without yielding on the essential\r\npoint of equality, and efforts to ascertain what would be considered\r\nsatisfactory did not meet with much success.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Nov. 14, 1882.\r\n\r\n     I tried to make Duclerc see yesterday that the practical way\r\n     towards obtaining some satisfaction for French _amour-propre_ was\r\n     to enter upon the discussion of details as to the Boards in Egypt.\r\n     I went as far as I could without running the risk of provoking\r\n     lofty language, which might have been an obstacle to moderate\r\n     arrangements hereafter.\r\n\r\n     However, at the moment Duclerc did not go back from his old\r\n     grounds. He does not insist upon a literal re-establishment of\r\n     the Control, but he does claim a virtual return to the _status quo\r\n     ante_, and he interprets that status as equality between England\r\n     and France and superiority of the two jointly over other Powers.\r\n\r\n     The single Financial Councillor pleases no one here. As\r\n     he must of course be an Englishman, the sticklers for French\r\n     _gloriole_ declare that whether his functions be great or small,\r\n     he will simply be a symbol of English supremacy and French\r\n     decadency. To the _haute_ and _petite finance_, the mode of his\r\n     appointment and the smallness of his powers seem an additional\r\n     cause of complaint, as not giving sufficient security for a proper\r\n     administration of the finances of Egypt. I shall be very anxious to\r\n     hear how it all strikes Dufferin.\r\n\r\n     In fact, at the present moment, the French are too uneasy\r\n     about their internal affairs to pay much attention to Egypt. But\r\n     they may fire up if any special event comes to irritate them. It\r\n     is more, however, future lasting ill will than violence at the\r\n     moment which I apprehend. If we leave them bitterly discontented\r\n     with arrangements in Egypt, I hardly see when we shall be able to\r\n     withdraw our troops and still maintain the influence which is a\r\n     necessity to us.\r\n\r\nThe idea that the British occupation of Egypt was anything more than\r\na temporary expedient does not seem to have been considered a serious\r\npossibility by any English Minister so far. Partly by luck, partly\r\nby the skill of Sir Garnet Wolseley and Lord Dufferin, we had found\r\nourselves in possession of Egypt, unhampered by association with any\r\nEuropean Power or with the Turks; but for a time it looked as if the\r\nbrilliant results achieved were to be thrown away because the British\r\nGovernment had no clear idea what its policy was to be. Fortunately for\r\nall concerned, the step was taken of sending Lord Dufferin on a special\r\nmission to Cairo, and unlike most special missions of more recent date,\r\nthe experiment proved a complete success, and quickly destroyed the\r\nmischievous delusion entertained by a section of English politicians\r\nthat an evacuation of Egypt was possible at any early date. This\r\ndelusion had never been shared by the French, who naturally judged the\r\naction of others in the light in which they themselves would have acted\r\nunder similar circumstances, and who made little effort to conceal their\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Dec. 1, 1882.\r\n\r\n     I don't succeed in making Duclerc _coulant_ about Egypt. He\r\n     rather implied that it was not from Tissot that he had heard that\r\n     you were going to send him a favourable communication, and that you\r\n     were thinking of sending an expert to discuss details. He did not,\r\n     however, say who it was that told him. Perhaps d'Aunay may have had\r\n     something to do with it. Duclerc went on to hint at there being two\r\n     currents in the English Cabinet, one more favourable to the French\r\n     than the other, but I declined to listen to this. He talked as if\r\n     he had some special source of information as to your intentions and\r\n     sentiments. He seemed to take to the idea of a discussion between\r\n     experts.\r\n\r\n     He was amiable about Madagascar, but we shall see what\r\n     his written answer will be. He represented himself as having\r\n     overwhelmed the Ambassadors with kindness, and then as having\r\n     broken off the negotiation on the point of the leases being for 99\r\n     years.\r\n\r\n     In the meantime prospects at home do not brighten. Railroads\r\n     and other public works have been begun, with very little system, in\r\n     all kinds of places to please Deputies and their constituents. The\r\n     Government dare not stop them for fear of what the workmen would do\r\n     if large numbers of them found themselves out of work. To go on,\r\n     is ruinous to the finances. There must be a limit to the floating\r\n     debt. The Government are again negotiating with the railway\r\n     companies. People are beginning to talk of Saviours of Society.\r\n     The names most mentioned are those of General Chanzy and the Duc\r\n     d'Aumale. Gambetta would have been everybody's man, if he had never\r\n     been Minister. However, I don't think that we are very near any\r\n     violent change.\r\n\r\n     Grévy is certainly not brisk, but he may grow old without\r\n     things coming to an early catastrophe.\r\n\r\n     There is a not unaccredited rumour that it was in wresting\r\n     the revolver from a female hand that Gambetta got wounded. The\r\n     bulletins at the office of the _République Française_ are that he\r\n     is going on as well as possible.\r\n\r\nThe last paragraph refers to the wounding of Gambetta by a pistol shot.\r\nThe accident (which terminated fatally) occurred at his villa outside\r\nParis, and was surrounded by a mystery which has never been dispelled,\r\nbut it may be assumed that a lady really was involved.\r\n\r\nThe allusion to Madagascar relates to the mission despatched by the\r\nQueen of the Hovas to Europe in the autumn in the vain hope of coming to\r\nsome agreement with the French Government, which had raised questions\r\nominously resembling those which had, in the previous year, formed\r\nthe prelude to the Tunis expedition. The Hovas, like the Kroumirs,\r\nconstituted 'a serious danger' to the French Republic, and demands were\r\nput forward which involved general French rights over the whole of\r\nMadagascar, and a protectorate over the northwest coast. The unhappy\r\nHova envoys proceeded from Paris to London, but met with little\r\nencouragement there, and before long a semi-official announcement\r\nwas made in which the stereotyped statement, with which small and\r\ndefenceless states are so painfully familiar, appeared: 'The Cabinet is\r\nresolved to enforce the respect of the rights and interests of France\r\nin Madagascar, and orders in conformity with the situation have,\r\ntherefore, been sent to the Commander of the French naval station.'\r\nSigns of the same ominous activity were also beginning to manifest\r\nthemselves in Tonquin; and the only compensating factor was that\r\nMadagascar and Tonquin served to distract a certain amount of French\r\nattention from Egypt, although the tone of the press, and especially of\r\nthe _République Française_, the organ of Gambetta, became increasingly\r\nhostile to England.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Dec. 19, 1882.\r\n\r\n     There are reports afloat that Gambetta's cure is not going\r\n     on as steadily as it ought. At all events there is no change for\r\n     the better in the tone of the _République Française_ respecting\r\n     England in Egypt. I don't like the idea of having the French there\r\n     in bitter opposition to all we do. It may make it very difficult\r\n     for us with safety to ourselves to give any large measure of\r\n     independence to the Egyptian Government. At all events, the less we\r\n     are able to sacrifice to satisfy French _amour-propre_, the more we\r\n     must do to give security to legitimate French material interests by\r\n     providing for a really good honest financial administration. If the\r\n     French take the protection of their material interests exclusively\r\n     into their own hands, they may go very great lengths indeed to\r\n     protect them, if they are seriously threatened; and, besides, the\r\n     pretext that the credit, property or persons of Frenchmen are\r\n     threatened, will always be at hand to sanction interference.\r\n\r\n     At present it looks as if the Duclerc Government would be\r\n     glad to back out of its expeditions to Tonquin, etc., etc. The\r\n     proceedings of the Hova Ambassadors and their supporters in England\r\n     may make it difficult for the French Government to be as reasonable\r\n     as it might otherwise wish to be about Madagascar.\r\n\r\n     The prevalent feeling of depression and uneasiness about\r\n     the general condition of France does not seem to diminish. There\r\n     seems to be a profound distrust of the abilities, if not of the\r\n     intentions, of the men who so rapidly succeed one another in\r\n     office, and no one seems to know where to turn for something better.\r\n\r\nIt was somewhat unfortunate that French aggression in Tonquin and\r\nMadagascar was unconsciously stimulated by the English press. 'The\r\nEnglish press is driving the French public wild on the subject of\r\nTonquin, Madagascar, and other beyond sea questions, which the\r\nGovernment would probably have been glad enough to back out of if they\r\nhad been let alone.'[36]\r\n\r\nUntil the end of the year private negotiations continued between Lord\r\nGranville and the French Government with reference to the abolition of\r\nthe Control with completely unsuccessful results.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Dec. 26, 1882.\r\n\r\n     I hear, not from himself, that Duclerc's present intention\r\n     is to make a very strong protest if we abolish Control without\r\n     coming to a previous understanding with France; and that our making\r\n     our own Control, or that of Europe in general, over the Egyptian\r\n     finances weak, would not mollify him. On the contrary, he would try\r\n     to make a point of what he would call our abandonment of French\r\n     material interests--and deduce from it an argument that France is\r\n     bound to protect them herself. While we are absolutely at two with\r\n     France, we shall find it very difficult to relax our material hold\r\n     on Egypt. Egypt for the Egyptians is only too likely to become\r\n     Egypt for the French.\r\n\r\n     Gambetta's illness seems to have rather strengthened his\r\n     position. The anxiety of his opponents in the press to make out\r\n     that he is worse than is really the case and the disgusting\r\n     statements they have in consequence put forward, have served to\r\n     impress on friends and foes his importance. According to the best\r\n     information I have been able to get, he is not at this moment\r\n     seriously ill, though his recovery is too slow to be satisfactory.\r\n\r\n     Confidence and tranquillity do not appear to revive in France,\r\n     and the disappearance of Gambetta would increase uneasiness. People\r\n     do not exactly know what they are afraid of, but there is a general\r\n     vague uneasiness. Perhaps the most definite cause of fears or hopes\r\n     is the intrigue in which certain officers of the army are said to\r\n     be engaged with a view of putting the Duc d'Aumale at the head of\r\n     the state.\r\n\r\nThe childish frame of mind in which the French Government of the day\r\nconsidered the question of the Control may be judged from the fact that\r\nDuclerc in private conversation had admitted in the autumn that, if\r\nfor form's sake, the _status quo ante_ could be restored for only five\r\nminutes, he would agree subsequently to its immediate abolition. In\r\nDecember, however, he was in a more intractable mood, and, at the end\r\nof the year, Lord Granville found it necessary to break off all private\r\nnegotiations on the subject, observing that it was very painful and\r\ndisadvantageous to be on bad terms with the French, but that it was, at\r\nthe least, equally disadvantageous to them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: 'Egypt and the Egyptian Question,' Sir D. Mackenzie\r\nWallace.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Lyons to Granville.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nANGLOPHOBIA\r\n\r\n(1883-1885)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first day of 1883 was signalized by the announcement of the death of\r\nGambetta, and those who were present at the Elysée on the occasion of\r\nPresident Grévy's New Year's Day reception will remember the singularly\r\nembarrassed demeanour of that uninteresting personage; an embarrassment\r\nwhich might have been accounted for on various grounds. Gambetta's\r\ndeath was followed in a day or two by that of General Chanzy, an event\r\nwhich caused consternation amongst the Monarchical and Conservative\r\nparties, as he was looked upon as the only man capable of stopping the\r\ntoo rapid progress of the Republican car. It was doubtless with the\r\nview of anticipating other pretenders, that Prince Napoleon seized the\r\nopportunity to issue a Proclamation denouncing the Republic, which\r\nresulted in his immediate incarceration in the Conciergerie.\r\n\r\nFor some months there had existed in France a feeling of uneasiness\r\nand of distrust in the maintenance of orderly government, and this\r\nfeeling was greatly increased by the double loss of Gambetta and Chanzy.\r\nGambetta was the only man in the Republican party whose ability and\r\npopularity were sufficient to induce the country to acquiesce in his\r\nwielding great power, and who was believed to have the will and the\r\ncourage to exercise that power energetically in case of need. Chanzy\r\nwas looked upon as the only man whose military reputation and influence\r\nqualified him to keep the army united and to use it with effect, in the\r\ncase of grave political troubles.\r\n\r\nAs for the President of the Republic, M. Grévy, his energy and influence\r\ncontinued to diminish; the Chamber of Deputies was becoming more and\r\nmore discredited, and the professedly anarchical parties were certainly\r\nincreasing in violence, and apparently in numbers and influence as well.\r\nThe public generally, even amongst the lower orders, showed few signs\r\nof great attachment to the Republican Government. That Government had\r\nnot augmented their material prosperity, had not raised their social\r\nposition, and had not realized their dreams of absolute equality with,\r\nor rather of predominance over, the rich and the educated. Every form\r\nof Monarchical Government was repugnant to them, but nevertheless a\r\nmoderate Republic excited no enthusiasm whatsoever. The upper classes\r\nwere alarmed and discontented; they did not believe that their property\r\nwas secure, and they considered the work of administration was\r\ndeplorably carried on by the various obscure Ministers who succeeded\r\neach other so rapidly in office; their religious feelings were daily\r\nshocked, while bad harvests, bad trade, and an unpromising financial\r\nsituation added to the general feeling of dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the 'spirited Colonial Policy,' which was now so much\r\nin evidence, did little to counterbalance this feeling, and the attempts\r\nwhich had been made to pander to the national vanity by the overbearing\r\npolicy adopted towards Madagascar; the extension of French predominance\r\nin Tunis; annexations on the Congo; and the consolidation of the French\r\nProtectorate over Tonquin and Annam, had met with little success. The\r\ndisquieting fact from the English point of view was that ill-feeling\r\ntowards England, chiefly with regard to Egypt, had risen to a high\r\npitch, and that each successive step taken by the British Government,\r\nand each declaration made by it, seemed only to increase the irritation.\r\nIt was in this direction that, Lord Lyons feared, attempts would be made\r\nto divert public discontent by those who might be in power; and the\r\nprocedure of the new French Government certainly justified the fear.\r\nThe position which the French Government took up, was that of defending\r\nFrench influence and French interests in Egypt by its own independent\r\nmeans. It declared that by the abolition of the Control, a deep wound\r\nhad been inflicted upon French dignity, while the principal security\r\nfor the regular payment of the sums due in regard to the loans had been\r\ntaken away. It did not hesitate to declare that any tampering with\r\nthe Law of Liquidation, or with the lands and revenues pledged to the\r\nloans; or any failure to provide for the charges on the loans, would\r\nbe regarded as a breach of international obligations on the part of\r\nEgypt, which would warrant the active interference of France. It hardly\r\nmade any pretence of concealing its intention to work against English\r\ninfluence in Egypt by every means in its power, and unfortunately it was\r\nevident that in this anti-English policy it could reckon on the support\r\nof public opinion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Jan. 9, 1883.\r\n\r\n     Blowitz's[37] intelligence certainly comes from the French\r\n     Foreign Office, sometimes, I dare say, directly, but often only\r\n     through the _Temps_. The _Temps_ is published the afternoon before\r\n     the day on which it is dated, and some hours before Blowitz's\r\n     letter goes to the _Times_. Blowitz's letter always goes by\r\n     telegraph, the _Times_ having the exclusive use of a line for some\r\n     hours every night.\r\n\r\n     It seems that Ferry will succeed Gambetta in the leadership\r\n     of the largest portion of the Republican party. I do not think he\r\n     is hostile to Duclerc, but if he attains to anything at all near\r\n     to Gambetta's position, Duclerc will only hold office during his\r\n     sufferance. Probably neither would be willing to serve under the\r\n     other.\r\n\r\n     If, as seems likely, the death of Gambetta leads to the\r\n     decay of the spirit of revenge upon Germany, this will (as I\r\n     have said before) increase the danger of all other Powers from\r\n     the restlessness of France, and will in particular increase our\r\n     difficulties in Egypt. If any modification of the arrangement of\r\n     the Law of Liquidation is proposed or any other step taken which\r\n     can give France a pretext for interfering in defence of French\r\n     interests, we may have trouble. If we leave a door open for French\r\n     intrusion, France may get so far in, that her _amour-propre_ may\r\n     force her to push on at all risks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Jan. 16, 1883.\r\n\r\n     Prince Napoleon's Proclamation and his arrest have put all\r\n     other things out of people's heads here for the moment. He was\r\n     arrested, very roughly I understand, at 3 o'clock, as he drove up\r\n     to his own door in the Avenue d'Autin, and his papers were examined\r\n     and seized in the usual way on such occasions. There is not so\r\n     far any appearance of his having anything behind to back up the\r\n     Proclamation. It is said that he has rendered himself liable to\r\n     very severe penalties as a conspirator against the State. What\r\n     seems to be more generally expected is that the law enabling the\r\n     Government to exile the members of any family that has reigned in\r\n     France will be revived. If it is to be the beginning of political\r\n     proscriptions, in however mild a form, it will be a calamity and\r\n     perhaps a prelude to revolutionary times and ways.\r\n\r\n     The only good I can see in it is that it may divert attention\r\n     here from Egypt, for the French were getting excessively cross with\r\n     us on that subject. I should not have been surprised if Duclerc's\r\n     Declaration and Yellow Book had been much more unfriendly than they\r\n     are. The Declaration was, it seems, received with icy coldness in\r\n     the Chamber. It is creditable to Duclerc that he did not fish for a\r\n     cheer by a Chauvin wind up, as Freycinet used to do. But if Duclerc\r\n     had been popular and had been thought to be firm in the saddle, he\r\n     would have met with a better reception.\r\n\r\nPrince Napoleon's Proclamation did not in reality cause any great\r\ncommotion or alarm, as it was obvious that he had no backing of\r\nimportance; but it served as an excuse to introduce a preposterous\r\nExclusion Bill directed against the members of all ex-reigning families.\r\nThis measure created great indignation amongst the French Conservatives,\r\nmore especially the provision which deprived the Princes of their\r\nCommissions in the army, and in consequence of modifications which were\r\nintroduced. Duclerc and his colleagues resigned office, giving place to\r\nan ephemeral Cabinet under M. Fallières, subsequently President of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Feb. 2, 1883.\r\n\r\n     Everything is at sixes and sevens here, and no one knows\r\n     to whom to turn in the absolute dearth of any man of decided\r\n     superiority since the death of Gambetta. It is curious that he\r\n     should come to be regretted as the mainstay of Conservatism.\r\n\r\n     I send you by the messenger a despatch from Villiers[38]\r\n     which seems to me to give a very clear and correct account of\r\n     the state of feeling in the French Army. I don't think it at all\r\n     overrates the dissatisfaction that exists among the officers. For\r\n     my own part I do not believe there is any organized movement,\r\n     Legitimist, Orleanist, or Bonapartist, actually in preparation\r\n     at this moment. But I do see that confidence in the duration of\r\n     the present institutions is diminishing, and that, as a cause or\r\n     a consequence, dissatisfaction and disquietude are increasing.\r\n     Something subversive may happen with very little warning beforehand.\r\n\r\n     Barring accidents, the probabilities seem to be that the\r\n     present Ministry may last about ten days, and that then Jules\r\n     Ferry may come in for some months and _après lui le déluge_.\r\n     Challemel Lacour is talked of as Minister for Foreign Affairs. As a\r\n     diplomatist you know him better than I do. The little social (so to\r\n     call it) intercourse I have had with him has been pleasant enough,\r\n     but he has the reputation of being irritable and cross-grained.\r\n\r\n     The proceedings against the Princes are bad enough in\r\n     themselves, and they are of evil augury. The Reds having once\r\n     tasted blood, may become ravenous for more, and who can say where\r\n     they may look for the next victims?\r\n\r\n     Notwithstanding the critical state of home affairs, the\r\n     French papers find room occasionally for bitter articles against\r\n     us about Egypt. The great point to attend to, in order to prevent\r\n     the smouldering irritations bursting into a blaze, seems to be to\r\n     avoid touching the Law of Liquidation, or the administrations of\r\n     the Daira and Domains. Any alteration, however great an improvement\r\n     it might be in reality, would give rise to unlimited suspicion and\r\n     dissatisfaction here.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales had intended visiting Paris about this period, but\r\nin consequence of the violent feelings aroused by the Exclusion Bill\r\nand of the bitterness of the extremists against constituted dynasties,\r\nhe was advised to keep away.\r\n\r\n     Their newspapers would have no scruple in attacking any\r\n     personage, however exalted, whom they believed to be opposed to\r\n     their deplorable bill. Indeed, the more exalted the personage,\r\n     and the more entitled to respect, the greater might be their\r\n     scurrility. Nothing can be more lamentable than all this, and I\r\n     am obliged to add that the general feeling towards England is not\r\n     particularly cordial. Taking everything into consideration, I have,\r\n     though very reluctantly, come to the conclusion that it is my duty\r\n     to report to Your Royal Highness that I cannot feel quite sure that\r\n     if you were at Paris something unpleasant might not happen, or that\r\n     at least very improper language might not be used by a portion of\r\n     the press; and I cannot conceal from Your Royal Highness that the\r\n     present moment is far from an opportune one for a visit.[39]\r\n\r\nThe increasing bad feeling produced a complaint from Lord Granville,\r\nwho considered that 'it is hard upon me, that being probably, of all\r\nEnglish public men, the one who for various reasons is most attached to\r\nFrance, we should always have such difficult moments to pass when I am\r\nin office.'\r\n\r\nAfter all the fuss that had been made about Prince Napoleon's\r\nProclamation, it came as a distinct anti-climax that his arrest was\r\ndiscovered to be illegal. He was accordingly released, and nothing more\r\nwas heard of him; meanwhile it was generally believed that General\r\nBillot, the late Minister of War in the Duclerc Government, had actually\r\nmade all preparations for a _pronunciamento_ in favour of the Duc\r\nd'Aumale, and that his project was only foiled on account of the want\r\nof enterprise shown by the Orleans princes themselves. General Billot\r\nwas superseded by a certain General Thibaudin, who was considered to be\r\nespecially well adapted for the purpose of carrying out the dirty work\r\nin connection with the dismissal of the Princes from the army.\r\n\r\nAfter a period of much uncertainty, during which for more than a month\r\nthere was no one at the French Foreign Office to whom the Foreign\r\nDiplomatists could speak on foreign affairs, or even any subordinate who\r\ncould express an opinion or give an instruction, M. Fallières was got\r\nrid of, and a new administration was formed under M. Jules Ferry, M.\r\nChallemel Lacour becoming Foreign Minister.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Feb. 20, 1883.\r\n\r\n     I suppose Ferry must have made his Ministry by to-morrow or\r\n     the next day. I will not bore you with the innumerable conjectures\r\n     as to who his colleagues will be. It is said Thibaudin is to be\r\n     kept as Minister of War, long enough at all events to take the\r\n     measures against the Princes which a more respectable general would\r\n     shrink from.\r\n\r\n     I only hope the new Ministry will not try to divert public\r\n     attention from home difficulties by a 'spirited' Foreign or\r\n     Colonial Policy. Egypt is always a source of trouble ready to their\r\n     hand, if they want to produce excitement. I think the great thing\r\n     is to avoid touching the Law of Liquidation or the administration\r\n     of the securities for the loans; in short, to avoid giving them\r\n     any pretext for saying that the material interests of France are\r\n     injured, and the guarantee she held weakened. But it is premature\r\n     to speculate on these matters in ignorance of who the incoming\r\n     Ministers may be and what policy they will adopt.\r\n\r\nThe urbane M. Challemel Lacour, in his new capacity as Foreign Minister,\r\nwas not likely to begin by making gushing protestations of deep\r\naffection for England, but Lord Lyons was disposed to consider this a\r\nhopeful symptom. 'I know by long experience that ardent professions\r\nof love for England on the part of an incoming Minister are not to be\r\ntrusted to as good signs.' Mr. Gladstone was in Paris at the time and\r\npaid visits to the President, Challemel Lacour, and Jules Ferry; but\r\nmuch to the relief of the Ambassador, he avoided the subjects of Egypt\r\nand of Commercial Treaties, and no harm was done.\r\n\r\nThe Ferry administration possessed the advantage of attracting a better\r\nclass of French politician than had lately been the case, and M.\r\nWaddington now reappeared upon the scene.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    March 6, 1883.\r\n\r\n     Jules Ferry appears to have hinted to Waddington that he would\r\n     be offered the Embassy in London, if he voted with the Government\r\n     on the interpellation in the Senate on the Decree putting the\r\n     Orleans Princes _en non-activité_. The Embassy at Vienna has, I\r\n     understand, been actually offered to and refused by him. He would\r\n     not, under any circumstances, take any Embassy but London, and\r\n     moreover he would in no case serve a Government of which Thibaudin\r\n     was a member.\r\n\r\n     Waddington asked Rivers Wilson if he could not suggest some\r\n     offer which might be made to France in order to place her once\r\n     more in cordial union with England in Egypt. There is, moreover,\r\n     a notice in the Havas, purporting to come from London, but very\r\n     likely put in more or less on authority here, to the effect that\r\n     France cannot, and England ought to, take the initiative of\r\n     proposing something. I entirely agree with you that the matter had\r\n     better lie still for the moment. I suppose you don't want to make\r\n     any such concession to France as would satisfy her, and certainly\r\n     matters would not be mended by our making another unsuccessful\r\n     proposal. I hope Waddington spoke entirely on his own hook and\r\n     not in concert with Challemel Lacour. It would be intolerable\r\n     if Challemel Lacour tried the system of indirect irresponsible\r\n     communications, the delight of Duclerc, which produced so much\r\n     annoyance and inconvenience, and in fact rendered any real\r\n     understanding impossible.\r\n\r\n     Jules Ferry is believed to be contemplating a conversion of\r\n     the 5 per cents. If he makes the attempt, it will bind him over\r\n     to keep things quiet abroad and at home, in order to secure the\r\n     success of the operation.\r\n\r\n     It is very provoking that the French should have put down the\r\n     New Hebrides among the places to which to transport their relapsed\r\n     criminals.\r\n\r\nLord Granville, who owned that he had nothing to propose about Egypt,\r\neven if he wished to do so, was not at all enthusiastic at the prospect\r\nof Waddington coming to London, 'I am not particularly anxious to\r\nhave Waddington instead of Tissot, he would be burning to distinguish\r\nhimself, and very _agissant_.' Lord Granville's fears of Waddington's\r\nactivity were founded upon the fact that he had been selected as the\r\nFrench Representative at the Coronation at Moscow, and that, therefore,\r\nhe would find it impossible to settle down quietly at the London Embassy\r\nwithout burning to distinguish himself, after 'flourishing about Europe.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 23, 1883.\r\n\r\n     It is whispered, at least by Waddington's friends, that it is\r\n     intended that his special Embassy to Russia shall be a prelude to\r\n     his becoming regular Ambassador in London: that the idea is that he\r\n     shall offer a Commercial Treaty to us; that he shall by this means\r\n     enlist the support of some members of Parliament and influential\r\n     manufacturers in England, and that then he shall obtain concessions\r\n     for us about Egypt, on the plea that, without such concessions,\r\n     the Chambers could not be brought to ratify a Commercial Treaty\r\n     favourable to us. The statements in the newspapers about the\r\n     assumption of Commercial negotiations between England and France\r\n     are stated to be _ballons d'essai_ to see how the wind sets with\r\n     regard to such a policy.\r\n\r\n     I just give you all this for what it may be worth. I doubt\r\n     very much whether formal negotiations or a stirring French\r\n     Ambassador in London would be likely to lead just now to cordiality\r\n     between France and England. The French could hardly do anything\r\n     that would satisfy us about trade, and we should find it very\r\n     difficult to do anything that would satisfy them about Egypt. My\r\n     hope would rather be that we might glide back into cordiality by\r\n     avoiding critical questions.\r\n\r\n     In talking to me about his Embassy to Russia, Waddington\r\n     mentioned, amongst its advantages, that it would bring him into\r\n     contact with important personages of various countries, and he said\r\n     he should probably visit Berlin and Vienna on his way home.\r\n\r\nWith Challemel Lacour at the Foreign Office there did not appear to\r\nbe much prospect of 'gliding back into cordiality,' judging by the\r\nfollowing account of an interview between him and some members of the\r\nRothschild family who were frequently employed as intermediaries between\r\nthe two Governments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 30, 1883.\r\n\r\n     Alphonse de Rothschild and his cousin Sir Nathaniel came to\r\n     see me yesterday and told me that they had had an interview with\r\n     Challemel Lacour on the subject of the proposed sale of the Domain\r\n     Lands in Egypt. They told me that they found Challemel Lacour\r\n     extremely sore about the whole Egyptian Question. He appears to\r\n     have distinctly refused to forward in any way the sale of the\r\n     Domain and to have alleged as his reason that he would not help to\r\n     do away with any board of management in which a Frenchman still had\r\n     a seat; that this would tend to diminish the number of Frenchmen\r\n     holding influential positions in Egypt, while his object was to\r\n     increase, or at all events, to maintain the existing number. As\r\n     indeed might have been foreseen, he was very far from desiring\r\n     to facilitate any financial or other arrangements required by\r\n     England. We shall no doubt find the French very inconvenient\r\n     and embarrassing in Egypt at every turn. I hope they will not\r\n     be dangerous, unless some disregard of positive international\r\n     engagements affecting French interests gives the Chauvinists the\r\n     pretext they are looking out for, and drives the sensible men into\r\n     a corner, in face of their public declarations and of popular\r\n     irritation.\r\n\r\n     I understand Louise Michel has been arrested. The Government\r\n     may gain ground by showing vigour, but unless it finds means of\r\n     convincing the officers in the army that it will secure their\r\n     position against the Radical endeavours to undermine it, things may\r\n     end in that fatal solution, a military _pronunciamento_.\r\n\r\nThe arrest of Louise Michel had taken place as the result of one of the\r\nnumerous riots which occurred at Paris in the spring of 1883; they were\r\nnot of much importance, but possessed some significance as being the\r\nfirst appearance of disturbances in the streets since the suppression of\r\nthe Commune, and were due largely to the distress caused by bad trade,\r\nand to artificially stimulated expenditure on building, and other modes\r\nof finding employment. The result of the latter expedient was to raise\r\nthe price of labour artificially and consequently to drive manufactures\r\nto other places, thus creating unemployment in Paris itself. In\r\nconnection with these disturbances there was one singular peculiarity\r\nin the attitude of the so-called Conservative classes. Not only the\r\nRoyalist and Imperial parties, but a considerable number of the richer\r\npeople who were without any strong political bias, sympathized rather\r\nwith the people in the streets than with the Government. The upper\r\nclasses were, in fact, so dissatisfied with the existing state of things\r\nthat they appeared willing to run the risk of seeing the Republican\r\nGovernment discredited and ultimately overthrown by popular tumult.\r\n\r\nThe following letter is an admirable illustration of the spirit in\r\nwhich the French viewed all English action in Egypt. Lord Dufferin,\r\nin the course of a despatch, had spoken in most appreciative terms of\r\nthe friendly attitude adopted towards him by M. de Raindre, the French\r\nAgent and Consul-General at Cairo, and the British Government naturally\r\nsupposed that it would be agreeable to the French Government if the\r\ndespatch were communicated to them. Lord Lyons, however, who was much\r\nbetter acquainted with French opinion, thought otherwise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 15, 1883.\r\n\r\n     I am rather frightened by the praises given by Dufferin in his\r\n     despatch of April 29th to the 'very correct and loyal attitude of\r\n     M. de Raindre, the French Agent and Consul-General, and of all the\r\n     French officials in Egypt.' If this despatch came to the knowledge\r\n     of the French Government or the French public, it might do de\r\n     Raindre a serious injury, and lead to the immediate substitution\r\n     for him of an Agent whose attitude would be more correct in the\r\n     French sense. I am afraid also that the claim Dufferin makes\r\n     to have considered the interests of the French in the Egyptian\r\n     service, however true it is, would provoke a howl of contradiction.\r\n\r\n     I do not mean to imply that Raindre's conduct has been at\r\n     variance with his instructions. I don't think it is the policy\r\n     of the French Government at this moment to get up irritating\r\n     discussions with us on small everyday matters, either in Egypt or\r\n     in other parts of the world. The French Foreign Office seems to\r\n     me to be, on the contrary, more conciliatory than usual in its\r\n     answers respecting such matters. I mark this with satisfaction\r\n     because I hope that in this way, provided we can avoid irritating\r\n     controversies, we may return insensibly to satisfactory relations.\r\n     But we are far enough from such relations in reality at this\r\n     moment. Challemel Lacour is not given, as you know, to talk about\r\n     general diplomatic policy, but others do not hesitate to let us\r\n     understand that while they are civil about small matters, they are\r\n     only biding their time till an opportunity comes of opposing us in\r\n     effect with great ones.\r\n\r\nThe course of affairs in Tonquin had not tended to restore the French\r\nto good humour by providing a compensation for their eclipse in Egypt,\r\nand the attempt to indulge in Chauvinism on the cheap had turned out\r\nto be a costly and unsatisfactory experiment. Had it not been for the\r\nprovocations of the foreign press, it is possible that the spirited\r\nColonial Policy with regard to Tonquin, Madagascar, etc., would have\r\nbeen abandoned quietly; but it was found intolerable to endure the daily\r\nadministration of threats, ridicule, and supercilious advice showered\r\nfrom abroad. As it was, these expeditions did serve one useful purpose,\r\nnamely, that of temporarily diverting attention from Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe reputation of the French Republic was not enhanced by a most\r\ndiscreditable incident which occurred at Paris in the autumn. The young\r\nKing of Spain who had been visiting some of the European capitals,\r\narrived at Paris on September 29, shortly after having been created\r\nby the German Emperor an Honorary Colonel of an Uhlan regiment at\r\nStrasbourg. On the strength of this honorary distinction he was met by\r\na howling mob, which proceeded to demonstrate its patriotism by insults\r\nsuch as have seldom been offered to any foreign potentate, and for which\r\nthe President of the Republic was forced to make an apology on the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Oct. 5, 1883.\r\n\r\n     I do not remember any moment at which affairs here have\r\n     appeared to me so gloomy. The more I learn of the proceedings of\r\n     the French authorities, no less than those of the mob, the more\r\n     unpardonable do they appear. I have never felt the same repugnance\r\n     (and I have had my trials in this way) to the people with whom I\r\n     have to deal. It is a comfort to contrast the bearing of the King\r\n     of Spain with that of His Majesty's so called hosts. Jules Ferry\r\n     himself appears to have behaved decorously. I will forbear from\r\n     speculating on the ultimate effect of this deplorable affair on\r\n     French institutions. So far as I can see, Ferry and Wilson both\r\n     calculate on obtaining the advantage in a battle in the Chambers,\r\n     if they put off the fight till the session opens on the 23rd. In\r\n     the meantime, decency (if decency were at all taken into account\r\n     here at this moment) would seem to require that Thibaudin should\r\n     resign or be dismissed.\r\n\r\n     Our own political questions with the French Government do\r\n     not seem in a much more hopeful state than the general political\r\n     condition of things here.\r\n\r\nNot content with having by carelessness allowed the King of Spain to be\r\ninsulted, the French Government prevented a correct and complete report\r\nof President Grévy's apology from being published in the _Journal\r\nOfficiel_, this action being on a par with the whole disgraceful\r\nproceedings. As, however, the only alternative to the existing\r\nGovernment appeared to be a thoroughgoing Intransigeant Cabinet, and\r\nthere was no telling what the latter might do both at home and abroad,\r\nit was hoped that Jules Ferry and his colleagues would succeed in\r\nholding their own.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn, Challemel Lacour, who had become unpopular owing to the\r\nunsatisfactory campaign in Tonquin, resigned office, and his place at\r\nthe Foreign Office was taken by Jules Ferry himself. Towards the end of\r\nNovember there arrived the news of Hicks Pasha's disaster in the Soudan,\r\nand although this event was not by any means unwelcome to the French,\r\nthe chances of a speedy termination of the British occupation of Egypt\r\nnaturally grew more remote.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Nov. 23, 1883.\r\n\r\n     I suppose there can be no hope that the disaster which has\r\n     overwhelmed Hicks's army is less serious than is reported. It seems\r\n     to be a grievous misfortune which has come at a most inopportune\r\n     moment for us. It is far from causing sorrow to our friends here.\r\n\r\n     I quite understand your not being keen to arbitrate between\r\n     France and China, and I don't think the French will be willing to\r\n     accept the arbitration of anybody. What they understand by our good\r\n     offices, is that we should help them to carry all their points\r\n     against the Chinese. It is supposed that the Committee will press\r\n     on the Government a larger vote for Tonquin than the Government has\r\n     asked for.\r\n\r\n     In the mean time things at home are looking gloomy in\r\n     France. There is likely to be a stagnation of trade and generally\r\n     much distress during the winter. People of all classes are\r\n     getting irritable, and seem to seek to vent their irritation on\r\n     foreign Powers. Add to this that the depression and pusillanimity\r\n     which followed 1870-1871, seem to be giving place to the former\r\n     overweening opinion of the strength of France and consequently to\r\n     Chauvinism.\r\n\r\n     I wrote a despatch to you by the last messenger as to the\r\n     effect the lowering the wine duties for Spain would have here. I\r\n     am never quite at ease when I think of our holding Most Favoured\r\n     Nation treatment at the pleasure of the French. The lowest class\r\n     who are gaining power are certainly not Free Traders.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the Soudan disaster the Egyptian Government became\r\nanxious to call in the Turks to their assistance, and this project\r\nexcited a strong feeling in France against the admission of the Sultan's\r\ntroops, or of any Turkish fighting men into Egypt, to take part in the\r\ndefence against the Mahdi, that feeling being founded on the old ground\r\nof danger to the French position in Tunis and Algeria. But, for the same\r\nreason, the French were disposed to throw a heavy responsibility upon\r\nEngland for taking precautions that the Mahdi should be effectually\r\nstopped somewhere or other. Everything, in fact, that England did in\r\nEgypt was wrong in French eyes, and there was a fresh outburst over an\r\narrangement made between Lesseps and the English shipowners with regard\r\nto the Suez Canal.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1884, the British Government decided definitely upon the\r\nevacuation of the Soudan, and Gordon was despatched to carry out the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Jan. 19, 1884.\r\n\r\n     I do not know that in the main any marked change in public\r\n     opinion in France about Egypt has taken place since I wrote ten\r\n     days ago; but as the state of things there remains unchanged\r\n     for the better or becomes changed for the worse, excitement and\r\n     reproaches against England increase. A catastrophe with regard to\r\n     the garrison of Khartoum or that of Sinkat, or any massacre of\r\n     Europeans, would probably produce a violent outcry against us, of a\r\n     much more intense character than the present general upbraiding as\r\n     to our allowing the advance of the Soudan towards civilization to\r\n     be stopped, and the slave trade to be revived.\r\n\r\n     I am told confidentially that Barrère, the French Agent at\r\n     Cairo, writes to urge his Government to decide upon some distinct\r\n     line of policy, in view of the present crisis. His own idea\r\n     would seem to be to ingratiate himself with the Egyptians at the\r\n     expense of the English, to lead them to attribute all the present\r\n     misfortunes to England and to teach them to look to France for\r\n     ultimate deliverance from them. I hear that he rates Baring's\r\n     ability very highly, but writes very disparagingly of the other\r\n     Englishmen in office in Egypt. One of his topics in decrying\r\n     England is said to be the sum charged by her on the Egyptian\r\n     Treasury for the occupying troops. He is said not to be averse to\r\n     touching the Law of Liquidation, because he conceives that, if this\r\n     is done, France will get her finger into the pie again.\r\n\r\n     Tonquin is, at this moment, secondary to Egypt in interest\r\n     here, but the French are getting impatient for news from Admiral\r\n     Courbet.\r\n\r\n     Nothing particularly critical has yet taken place in the\r\n     Chamber.\r\n\r\nLord Granville's reply seems to show that General Gordon was almost as\r\ngreat an optimist as himself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Jan. 19, 1884.\r\n\r\n     Many thanks for your important private letter about Egypt. The\r\n     information may be of use to Baring.\r\n\r\n     Barrère is a very clever fellow, and has persuaded Baring that\r\n     he is very friendly.\r\n\r\n     Gordon went off yesterday, in a very good humour, determined\r\n     to help us in carrying out our policy of evacuation in the best\r\n     manner.\r\n\r\n     He is wonderfully optimistic, with a great contempt for the\r\n     Mahdi and disbelief in Arab fanaticism or love of real fighting. He\r\n     is not much afraid of a massacre. I trust he may be right.\r\n\r\nA fresh disaster in the Soudan--Baker Pasha's defeat--encouraged the\r\nidea that these reverses were symptoms of weakness on the part of\r\nEngland, and gave France a reason for desiring to interfere, and a\r\n_locus standi_ for asserting a claim to do so.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 11, 1884.\r\n\r\n     The large majority obtained by the Government against the\r\n     coalition of the extreme Right and the extreme Left on Paul Bert's\r\n     extravagant proposals relative to the salaries of schoolmasters and\r\n     schoolmistresses, has strengthened their hands and has given some\r\n     confidence to the Union Républicaine Party, on which they mainly\r\n     rely. They also succeeded in defeating a very mischievous motion\r\n     made by Clémenceau in the Committee of 44 to send a deputation to\r\n     Anzin in order to inquire into, or more properly to foment the\r\n     troubles in the Anzin coal districts. Nevertheless, the state of\r\n     the country and of Paris in particular is far from comfortable.\r\n     The distress of the workmen, and the folly and unreasonableness of\r\n     their demands and expectations are on the increase. I send you by\r\n     this messenger a good despatch by Crowe[40] on the violent cry for\r\n     protection from the competition of foreign workmen as well as that\r\n     of foreign goods, which has been one of the consequences.\r\n\r\n     I am afraid all this does not tend to make the Government\r\n     more conciliatory on foreign affairs. They are hourly expecting\r\n     to hear of the fall of Bac-Ninh, and if they are quite successful\r\n     there, they are only too likely to turn their thoughts to getting\r\n     a little glory out of the Egyptian question, as well as out of the\r\n     Madagascar, Congo, and other matters in which they are more or less\r\n     opposed to England.\r\n\r\n     So far as we are concerned, the effect the reconciliation\r\n     between Russia and Germany has had upon the French is not good.\r\n     So long as they had any hopes of a quarrel between Germany and\r\n     Russia, they felt bound to reserve their strength in order to take\r\n     advantage of it, and to cultivate good relations with other Powers,\r\n     in order to secure at least their non-interference. Now they have\r\n     given up the hope of a break between Russia and Germany, and are\r\n     at the same time confident that all the Continental Powers are\r\n     determined on peace. They think therefore that they may expect to\r\n     be _tête-à-tête_ with us and to be free to act as suits them in\r\n     affairs in which we are concerned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Granville to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    March 12, 1884.\r\n\r\n     Your letters are most interesting, though not comforting. The\r\n     difficulty of keeping on friendly terms with France is not to be\r\n     underrated.\r\n\r\n     I await with almost equal interest the news which we shall\r\n     probably get this evening from [illegible] and that which I suppose\r\n     will come in a few days from Bac-Ninh.\r\n\r\n     I am afraid victory will make the French Government very\r\n     difficult to deal with; on the other hand, a defeat, which is not\r\n     likely, will make the Chinese intolerable.\r\n\r\n     Our own troubles, especially in the Soudan, are great. If\r\n     things could settle there, I am confident that Egypt would soon\r\n     recover the state in which she was before Hicks's defeat, and this\r\n     notwithstanding all the intrigues which are going on there.\r\n\r\n     Bismarck says he shall give us no trouble about the Law of\r\n     Liquidation, but that other nations will. What will be the best way\r\n     of approaching the French Government when we have made up our own\r\n     minds?\r\n\r\n     As to protection, it will create a very angry feeling here.\r\n     It will ruin the French and it will make us the monopolists of the\r\n     neutral markets of the world so long as we can keep at peace.\r\n\r\n     The Egyptian blister has diverted public attention from Merv.\r\n     The question was treated in excellent speeches in the Lords, but\r\n     the debate was dull and flat.\r\n\r\n     We do not make you a very handsome present in Mohrenheim. He\r\n     is like a diplomatist on the stage.\r\n\r\nBaron Mohrenheim, a diplomatist of a very conventional type, had just\r\nbeen transferred to Paris from the Russian Embassy in London, and was\r\ngenerally credited with strong anti-English sentiments.\r\n\r\nOn the question of the financial condition of Egypt, the British\r\nGovernment finally decided to propose a European Conference, and the\r\ndecision was communicated to the French Government. As was only to be\r\nexpected, the English proposal produced a conflict of opinion in France.\r\nSome approved of calling in Europe generally, but others denounced the\r\nproposal as a new proof of the treachery of England, who, according\r\nto them, was bound to treat with France alone, and called loudly upon\r\nthe French Government to refuse to go into a Conference on equal terms\r\nwith other Powers. All seemed to think, however, that the moment had\r\ncome for France to reassume a position equal with that of England, if\r\nnot superior to it. The attitude of the French Government itself was\r\nmore moderate. Jules Ferry accepted the Conference 'in principle,'\r\nand endeavoured to show that two absolutely false notions prevailed\r\nin England which seemed to be the great obstacles to an understanding\r\nbetween the two countries. One was that if the English withdrew their\r\ntroops from Egypt, France would send hers in; the other, that France\r\nsought to re-establish the Control.\r\n\r\nThe position in which Gordon now found himself in Khartoum began to\r\ncause Her Majesty's Government serious misgivings, and many expedients\r\nwere suggested for relieving Ministers from their embarrassment. Amongst\r\nthem appears a serio-comic proposition from the Baron de Billing, a\r\nwell-known figure in Anglo-French society.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 4, 1884.\r\n\r\n     I send you copies of a letter written to me by Baron de\r\n     Billing yesterday and of a memo annexed to it. I don't know what\r\n     you will think of the offer to rescue Gordon which they contain,\r\n     but I deem it right to lay it before you. Billing made it to me\r\n     verbally yesterday, and I begged him to put it in writing. The\r\n     inclosed papers are the result.\r\n\r\n     Billing did not tell me who the persons were by whom the\r\n     rescue was to be effected, but I understand that they were Arab\r\n     Sheikhs or something of that kind. Apparently they are in Paris,\r\n     for he professed to go to consult them before he sent me the memo.\r\n\r\n     He says you have known him from a boy.\r\n\r\n     '_Il se porte garant de l'honorabilité des personnes en jeu._'\r\n     For my part '_Je ne me porte garant de rien_' in the matter.\r\n\r\n     Billing insisted much on the importance of his receiving a\r\n     speedy answer.\r\n\r\n    MEMO.\r\n\r\n     '_Gordon Pasha sera remis aux autorités egyptiennes ou\r\n     anglaises à un des ports de la Mer Rouge ou aux avant-postes de\r\n     l'armée anglo-egyptienne moyennant:_\r\n\r\n     1°. _le paiement immédiat par Lord Lyons d'une somme de deux\r\n     mille livres sterling à une personne désignée par le Baron de\r\n     Billing, ancien chargé d'affaires de France à Munich, Tunis et\r\n     Stockholm._\r\n\r\n     2°. _Le versement d'une somme de 48,000 livres sterling au\r\n     credit du Baron de Billing chez Messrs.

When the Prince of Wales, who was then in Paris,\r\ncalled upon President Grévy, the latter dilated effusively upon the\r\nsatisfaction which all nations must feel at the new opening of trade to\r\nthem in Tonquin and Annam. On the other hand, the _Temps_, a newspaper\r\nof considerable authority, talked of the _ouverture au commerce\r\nexclusif de la France des Provinces de l'Empire celeste limitrophes de\r\nnos possessions de l'Indo-Chine_. 'I have observed,' Lord Lyons wrote\r\nsadly, 'no symptoms lately in France of anything like a decently liberal\r\ncommercial spirit.' Nor when M. Jules Ferry was congratulated upon the\r\nTonquin settlement, did that statesman let fall any hint of an intention\r\nto open to the rest of the world the commercial advantages which France\r\nhad secured for herself. In fact, the chief result of the French success\r\nin Tonquin seemed to be, that, having at all events, got rid temporarily\r\nof this difficulty, a more unconciliatory line of policy than ever would\r\nbe adopted as far as Egypt was concerned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 27, 1884.\r\n\r\n     You may have observed that, contrary to my usual habit, I\r\n     have been sending you lately a great many extracts from French\r\n     newspapers. My reason is of a very painful kind. I have thought it\r\n     necessary to give you specimens of the ill will towards England,\r\n     the suspicions of her, and the irritability respecting her which\r\n     seem to become more and more prevalent here. To these unpleasant\r\n     symptoms I might add that exclusive and illiberal commercial views\r\n     and extreme Protectionist ideas are in the ascendant: and that thus\r\n     the spirited Colonial Policy now in vogue, becomes a danger instead\r\n     of an advantage to foreign commerce, which it might be if it opened\r\n     new areas to the trade of all nations.\r\n\r\n     The Ferry Government is wafted along by the pleasant breezes\r\n     from Tonquin, but they must be on the look out for squalls as they\r\n     near the revision of the Constitution and the discussion of the\r\n     Budget of 1885.\r\n\r\n     The _Gaulois_ is hardly looked upon here as a serious paper,\r\n     but the calumnies upon Sir J. Drummond Hay which it professes\r\n     to have derived from a report made, I suppose _viva voce_, by\r\n     Ordega[41] to Ferry, are too bad. Menabrea says that the Italian\r\n     Minister at Tangier is a man of herculean strength and fierce\r\n     temper, and that he is as likely as not to wring Ordega's neck if\r\n     he catches him. _Libre à lui de le faire._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Granville to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    May 28, 1884.\r\n\r\n     We must be very clumsy to invite so much indignation in France\r\n     and at the same time to run the risk of being turned out next month\r\n     for being so subservient to her.\r\n\r\n     Waddington seems in earnest to bring about a good\r\n     understanding, but our press, over which the Government has\r\n     absolutely no control, will be most offensive, until the vote of\r\n     censure against the Conference, which is almost sure to be brought\r\n     on, is decided one way or the other.\r\n\r\n     It will require all Salisbury's want of caution to try to come\r\n     in upon a quarrel with all Europe upon the Egyptian question.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian policy of the Gladstone Government, subsequently to the\r\nsuccessful campaign of 1882, never met with much favour in any quarter\r\nin England, but it was not surprising, on the whole, that Lord Granville\r\nshould be pained by French hostility, since nothing whatever had been\r\ndone to warrant it. Had we behaved ill to France, there might have been\r\na chance of returning to favour by altering our procedure; as it was,\r\nthere was no reasonable ground of offence whatever, and therefore the\r\nprospect of restoring friendly relations appeared to be all the more\r\nremote.\r\n\r\nLord Hartington, then a prominent member of the Gladstone Government,\r\nwas in Paris at the beginning of June, and Lord Granville seems to have\r\nbeen much alarmed as to the language which he might use with reference\r\nto Egypt in conversation with French Ministers. Lord Hartington was\r\nprobably not in the least desirous of conversing with French Ministers\r\nupon Egypt or upon any other subject, and wished to go _incognito_, 'as\r\nhe was constantly in the habit of doing;' but it was represented to him\r\nthat unless he called upon Jules Ferry it would be believed that he was\r\nengaged upon a secret mission, and Lord Lyons was therefore asked to\r\ngive him some preliminary coaching.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, June 3, 1884.\r\n\r\n     I sent Lord Hartington your letter yesterday, and I had a long\r\n     visit from him in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n     As matters stand, what seems to me most to be dreaded with a\r\n     view to our relations with France is a vote of the House of Commons\r\n     censuring an arrangement made by Her Majesty's Government with the\r\n     French Government. Such a vote, and the debate by which it would be\r\n     preceded, would, I cannot but fear, have a truly lamentable effect.\r\n\r\n     I understand that Jules Ferry is having a memorandum on the\r\n     Finances of Egypt drawn up by Blignières, and that it will dispute\r\n     the accuracy of Mr. Childers's information and represent that the\r\n     Finances were in a flourishing condition, and that there were\r\n     surpluses even during Arabi's rebellion, up to the time at which\r\n     England took the thing in hand. The memorandum will probably deny\r\n     there being any necessity for reducing the interest of the debt, if\r\n     the Finances be properly managed.\r\n\r\n     I do not know whether such a reason will be assigned to us,\r\n     but in fact it seems that the French object to any large loans\r\n     being guaranteed by England, on account of the lien, so to speak,\r\n     which it would give England upon Egypt. The French would prefer a\r\n     simple fresh issue of Unified stock.\r\n\r\n     In the meantime, the French bondholders are bestirring\r\n     themselves and protesting against any arrangement being made\r\n     without their being consulted.\r\n\r\n     Jules Ferry, however, himself thinks little of any other\r\n     consideration in comparison with the political success which it\r\n     would be to him to give France again a political footing in Egypt,\r\n     and as a means to this, to get a time fixed for the departure of\r\n     our troops. I do not think he is afraid of much disapproval here\r\n     of his counter-concession--the engagement that French troops shall\r\n     not enter Egypt, either on the departure of the English troops or\r\n     afterwards. Unless the engagement were very formally made and very\r\n     peculiarly and stringently worded, it would be felt here that it\r\n     did not amount to much. For though it would preclude the occupation\r\n     of Egypt by the French to preserve order and promote reforms in the\r\n     same way we occupy the country now, it would not be interpreted\r\n     here as preventing France using force to avenge an insult or\r\n     protect distinct French interests in cases which would constitute a\r\n     _casus belli_ as regarded any ordinary country.\r\n\r\n     I do not quite understand the exact position in which stands\r\n     the suggestion that the Financial question should be first\r\n     settled by England with the several Powers separately, and then a\r\n     conference be held for a day or two only to ratify what had already\r\n     been settled. Does this afford an opening for purely financial\r\n     negotiations, and admit of dropping the French political proposals\r\n     which appear to be so unpopular in England? I believe Jules Ferry\r\n     is in some tribulation about the difficulties his proposals have\r\n     met with in England, and is half inclined to be sorry he made them\r\n     so strong, though I doubt whether Waddington has made him fully\r\n     aware of the violence of the opposition they encounter in England.\r\n\r\n     Generally speaking, I am very unhappy about the growing\r\n     ill-will between France and England which exists on both sides\r\n     of the Channel. It is not that I suppose that France has any\r\n     deliberate intention of going to war with us. But the two nations\r\n     come into contact in every part of the world. In every part of it\r\n     questions arise which, in the present state of feeling, excite\r\n     mutual suspicion and irritation. Who can say, when and where, in\r\n     this state of things, some local events may not produce a serious\r\n     quarrel, or some high-handed proceedings of hot-headed officials\r\n     occasion an actual collision?\r\n\r\nThe variety and number of questions upon which Lord Lyons was requested\r\nto pronounce an opinion have already been commented upon; now he was\r\nasked to consider the effect of a hypothetical vote of the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Granville to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Trentham, June 4, 1884.\r\n\r\n     Many thanks for your important and pregnant letter. I quite\r\n     agree that the relations between England and France will be\r\n     disagreeable if the House of Commons rejects our proposals; but\r\n     this, though possible, is not so probable as Hartington thinks.\r\n\r\n     The M.P.'s neither desire a Salisbury administration; still\r\n     less a dissolution.\r\n\r\n     But how will our relations be, if we previously break off\r\n     with France? and what can you suggest for the settlement of the\r\n     financial difficulties of Egypt, if we obtain no sanction for a\r\n     change of the Law of Liquidation?\r\n\r\n     Do you think that the House of Commons would allow us to take\r\n     the whole debt upon ourselves, in order to save the bondholders? I\r\n     should be really grateful for your suggestions on this last point.\r\n\r\nFrom the above letter it is plain that Her Majesty's Government had no\r\ndefinite Egyptian policy, and were merely stumbling along concerned\r\nonly, as frequently happens with British Cabinets, with the possible\r\nresult of a division in the House of Commons. The only evidence of\r\npolicy was a strong inclination to evade responsibility; to hand it over\r\nto a collection of Powers; and to fritter away such advantages as had\r\nbeen so hardly won, in the hopeless attempt to recover the goodwill of\r\nthe French Government.\r\n\r\nLord Lyons's reply was to the effect that nothing would have a worse\r\neffect than a bitter debate in the House of Commons followed by the\r\ncensure of terms agreed upon by the French and English Governments. But\r\nas there was no doubt whatever that the French Government intended to\r\ntake advantage of the Conference to place France in the same position in\r\nEgypt as that which she formerly held, a firm policy on the part of Her\r\nMajesty's Government might have a better effect than an over-yielding\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Conference met in London at the end of June and continued\r\nits sterile discussions for upwards of a month before finally breaking\r\nup, while the tone of the French press grew more and more hostile, and\r\nanything in the nature of a concession on the subject of the interest of\r\nthe debt or on any other matter affecting French material interest was\r\ndenounced in the fiercest terms. Even the craven British proposals with\r\nregard to the limitation of the military occupation were treated with\r\ncontempt, and no person came in for greater abuse than M. Waddington,\r\nwho was now established as Ambassador in London, and was constantly\r\ndenounced for subservience to England, solely because he owned an\r\nEnglish name.\r\n\r\nThe Conference broke up in August, and the Cabinet, which was now being\r\ncontinually denounced on all sides for its feeble and procrastinating\r\npolicy, decided upon despatching Lord Northbrook on a special mission\r\nto Cairo. Before Lord Northbrook started he had a long interview with\r\nLord Lyons, who did his best to impress upon him the views, interests,\r\nand susceptibilities of France, and the great importance of not running\r\ncounter to them if possible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Oct. 17, 1884.\r\n\r\n     I opened my first conversation with Ferry, the day after my\r\n     return, with a message from you as to your desire to be on good\r\n     terms, and to avoid unpleasantness in treating matters between\r\n     the two countries all over the world. I enlarged upon this theme,\r\n     and made it as plain to him as I could, without letting the\r\n     conversation degenerate into recrimination, that if France were\r\n     perpetually irritating us, we on our side had the means, and should\r\n     not always be able to abstain from using them, of making ourselves\r\n     very disagreeable too. The subject was treated in the most friendly\r\n     way by me, and Ferry was profuse in his acknowledgments to you, and\r\n     in assurances; but I should have been glad if I could have brought\r\n     him to more practical advances towards intimacy and good fellowship\r\n     than I was able to do. However, the conversation may perhaps have\r\n     done some good.\r\n\r\n     As regards the Congo Conference, I came away with the\r\n     impression that there is more or less a tacit, if not very\r\n     explicit, understanding between France and Germany, in addition to\r\n     what appears in the Yellow Book; and that this understanding may\r\n     prove inconvenient to us.\r\n\r\n     The session has not opened very favourably for the Government.\r\n     The Finance Minister's hocus-pocus expedients for balancing the\r\n     Budget have been unanimously rejected by the Budget Committee. The\r\n     recent 'glories' in Tonquin hardly outweigh in public estimation\r\n     the growing expenses of the operations there and in China. Ferry\r\n     told me he disliked the protective duties on cattle and corn, but\r\n     that the Government could not altogether resist them, though it\r\n     would endeavour to make them as moderate as possible. Rouvier,\r\n     the new Minister of Commerce, is less Protectionist than his\r\n     predecessor, Hérisson; but I have no confidence in the so-called\r\n     Free Trade principles of any Frenchman. Duties on manufactures\r\n     are sure to follow in the wake of duties on food, and I can never\r\n     forget that we hold our Most Favoured Nation treatment only at the\r\n     good pleasure of the French Government. The proceedings of the\r\n     Lyonnais are socialist and revolutionary, and a great impetus has\r\n     been given to Socialism by the journeyings during the recess of the\r\n     sub-committees of the General Committee appointed by the Chamber\r\n     of Deputies to inquire into the distress of the working classes.\r\n     Nevertheless the chances still seem to be that the Ferry Ministry\r\n     will weather the storms of the autumn session.\r\n\r\n     Ferry complained bitterly of the English press. He said in\r\n     particular that the irritating lecturing tone of the _Times_ goaded\r\n     the French to madness; though he himself observed that it used the\r\n     same tone towards the Government of its own country. I said that\r\n     the press on both sides of the Channel seemed to work as if for the\r\n     express purpose of producing ill-will between the two countries;\r\n     but that certainly the English Government had no power to restrain\r\n     it. A good understanding between the two Governments and friendly\r\n     proceedings on their parts to each other, would in time act upon\r\n     public opinion; and saying this, I preached a little more on the\r\n     text of the importance of the French Government's not making itself\r\n     unnecessarily disagreeable.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government were at this time involved in domestic as well\r\nas external difficulties, and Lord Granville's reply to the foregoing\r\nletter contained a renewal of the old importunity to come over and vote\r\nin the House of Lords on a party question. It is quite obvious that\r\nLord Granville was impelled to do so by Gladstone, and the typical\r\nGladstonian reasoning is shown in the argument that Lord Lyons ought to\r\nvote, because being an Ambassador he was a non-party man; whereas on\r\nprevious occasions his vote had been applied for, because he distinctly\r\nranked as a party man in the Whip's list.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Granville to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Walmer, Oct. 18, 1884.\r\n\r\n     Gladstone writes to me earnestly, but I think reasonably,\r\n     respecting your vote at the present important crisis.\r\n\r\n     He says that you must be aware of the estimate we hold of your\r\n     judgment and independence. But to save the House of Lords from a\r\n     tempest which must strain and may wreck it, some Tory Lords will\r\n     be moved to vote for the Franchise Bill, and he asks why the same\r\n     motive should not operate upon men like our Ambassadors, who he\r\n     believes are of no party.\r\n\r\n     I own I think that the same majority, or possibly a larger one\r\n     in the Lords, would be a great disaster.\r\n\r\n     If the Liberal Party take up hostility to the House of Lords\r\n     itself as its leading question--whether led by Gladstone himself,\r\n     or not,--and with a leader of the Lords who is personally in favour\r\n     of getting a larger career of power and utility for himself in the\r\n     Commons, it is difficult not to foresee the result.\r\n\r\n     With regard to immediate politics, supposing Salisbury\r\n     succeeds in forcing a dissolution, and with the help of the Irish\r\n     turns us out, what chance is there of his not being turned out in\r\n     six months by nearly the same process?\r\n\r\n     The Waddingtons came here to luncheon. I guessed that they\r\n     funked being reported as being here. He was very civil, and his\r\n     talk was not altogether unpromising.\r\n\r\nNo one with the slightest practical acquaintance with politics could\r\npossibly be taken in by the Gladstonian phrase about the 'estimate of\r\nyour judgment and independence.' Ministers when urging their docile\r\nsupporters either in the Lords or the Commons to support a party\r\nmeasure, are not in the habit of boasting that some eminent person,\r\nwhether an Ambassador or not, is going to give a silent vote in their\r\nfavour, and even if they did, it would not produce the slightest effect.\r\nOne peer's vote is as good as another's, and in the division list an\r\nAmbassador counts no higher than the most obscure of backwoodsmen.\r\n\r\nAnglo-French relations were not improved by the occurrences in the\r\nFar East, where the French, in consequence of the Tonquin expedition,\r\nhad drifted into war with China. The Chinese fleet, composed of small\r\nobsolete vessels, was destroyed at Foochow by the heavily armed French\r\nships in August; but as the Chinese Government showed no signs of\r\nyielding, the French Admiral, Courbet, was ordered to seize part of\r\nthe island of Formosa, where valuable coal mines were known to exist.\r\nIn order to effect his object, Admiral Courbet, with a magnificent\r\ndisregard of all neutral Powers, proclaimed a paper blockade of Formosa,\r\nwhich naturally provoked a protestation on the part of the British\r\nGovernment. During the remainder of the year hostilities between France\r\nand China continued, although from time to time recurrence to the\r\nfriendly offices of Her Majesty's Government was suggested but found\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\nEgypt, however, remained the centre of interest, and the prospects of\r\nany amicable arrangement appeared to recede further into the distance.\r\nUpon the return of Lord Northbrook, the new proposals of Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment were put before the French Government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Dec. 26, 1884.\r\n\r\n     I suppose Waddington's private statement to me that we must\r\n     not expect an answer to our Egyptian proposals before the end of\r\n     the year was intended to imply that we _should_ get an answer about\r\n     that time.\r\n\r\n     I pressed Ferry strongly on the subject the day before\r\n     yesterday. He assured me that he had studied our papers and was\r\n     occupying himself without intermission on the subject, but I could\r\n     not bring him to book as to the exact time we might look for an\r\n     answer, nor could I extract from him any hint as to what the answer\r\n     was to be.\r\n\r\n     I am afraid that the draft of it has gone, or is going, to\r\n     Berlin, and I augur anything but good from this. It seems to\r\n     me that without being driven to anything of the kind by German\r\n     interests, Bismarck has lately taken a sort of malicious pleasure\r\n     in treating matters in a way calculated to embarrass and discredit\r\n     us.\r\n\r\n     You may be quite sure that I shall leave no stone unturned\r\n     to get an answer as soon as possible. I don't think threats of\r\n     Tunisifying Egypt, or of bankruptcy, or other strong measures,\r\n     would tell upon the French. They would not believe that we\r\n     should have recourse to such measures, in face of the opposition\r\n     of France, Germany, Austria, and Russia, even if we had the\r\n     thoroughgoing support of Italy. I should hesitate to bring matters\r\n     to a point at which we could only execute our threats by a very\r\n     large display of military and naval force, or back out of them.\r\n     The best card in our hand, and it is not a high trump, is the\r\n     reluctance of the French to be thrown irretrievably into the\r\n     clutches of Bismarck by a distinct quarrel with us.\r\n\r\n     Ferry seemed grateful to you for the way in which you\r\n     sounded him through Waddington about new proposals from China,\r\n     but he appears to think that any eagerness on his part to receive\r\n     new proposals would be looked upon by the Chinese as a sign of\r\n     weakness, and short of absolutely giving in on the part of China,\r\n     an _action d'éclat_ on the part of the French forces would answer\r\n     best for him with the Chambers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Dec. 30, 1884.\r\n\r\n     I put your letter myself into Errington's hand this\r\n     morning.[42] He starts for Italy this evening.\r\n\r\n     You will see by the despatch I send with this that Ferry\r\n     promises an answer on the Egyptian Finances on the 15th of next\r\n     month, and that he intends to make counter-proposals. I cried out\r\n     at his mentioning so distant a date as the 15th, but he would not\r\n     name a nearer one. If, as I cannot but surmise, he is consulting\r\n     Berlin, I fear that neither speed nor conciliation to us will be\r\n     recommended from that quarter. I confess I cannot think of any\r\n     threat which would be likely to mend matters. The French would\r\n     probably rejoice at any crisis which might array distinctly against\r\n     us the three Emperors, as well as this Republic. I doubt the\r\n     Tonquin affair being very much of a safeguard. I should feel safer\r\n     if France were not getting into the habit of sending out distant\r\n     expeditions.\r\n\r\n     I report officially this evening Ferry's language about the\r\n     new Chinese proposals. The Chambers were all in favour of an\r\n     _action d'éclat_. I don't think Ferry could face them with another\r\n     doubtful negotiation on his hands which would suspend military\r\n     action. At any rate he does not seem to wish to hear anything of\r\n     Chinese proposals, short of actual surrender.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1885 Her Majesty's Government were confronted\r\nwith the unpleasant fact, that whereas hitherto they had only had\r\nFrench opposition to reckon with in respect to Egypt, Bismarck had\r\nnow engineered a European combination against them in consequence of\r\ndissatisfaction at the English attitude towards his colonial policy.\r\nThe English financial proposals, more especially those which suggested\r\nthat the interest on the debt should be reduced, and the Anglo-French\r\nAdministration of the Daira and Domain Lands should be abolished, were\r\ndenounced in unmeasured terms in France. Nor did it seem easy to devise\r\nany efficacious means either of reconciling the French to the proposals\r\nor of putting pressure on them. The time for putting pressure on France\r\nwas past; earlier in the day, a representation that a refusal to consent\r\nto measures necessary for the well being and good administration of\r\nEgypt would oblige the British Government to take the country formally\r\nunder their protection, after the fashion of Tunis, would have met with\r\nlittle opposition; but now France might go to any extremities to resist\r\nsuch an arrangement, feeling sure that in so doing she would have the\r\nsupport of Germany, Austria, and Russia. Under these circumstances the\r\nprospect of a financial crisis, or even of bankruptcy, produced little\r\nalarm, because it was felt that the support of the three Empires would\r\nbe forthcoming in demanding that the Egyptian financial administration\r\nshould be placed under the joint control of the Powers; and it was in\r\nfact only too probable that the intractability of the French Government\r\nwould increase in proportion with the support obtained from Germany and\r\nthe Powers which followed the German lead.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly credible that the patronage of Germany was acceptable to\r\nthe French public or entirely satisfactory to the French Government,\r\nas the danger, not to say the humiliation, of falling altogether into\r\nthe hands of Bismarck, could not quite be lost sight of. The French\r\nGovernment no doubt had two objects in view; the first, to make use\r\nof the support of Germany and the Powers, in order to guard French\r\npecuniary interests, and to improve as far as possible the political\r\nposition of France in Egypt; the second, to avoid severing themselves\r\nso entirely from England as to be left wholly at the mercy of Germany.\r\nUnfortunately for England the second object appeared to be the one to\r\nwhich the lesser importance was attached.\r\n\r\nIn short, the probabilities were, that unless we succeeded in coming to\r\nsome arrangement with France, we should find arrayed against us all the\r\nEuropean Powers, except Italy, the position in which we were placed at\r\nthe moment, in consequence of the expedition to Khartoum, having been\r\ntaken into account in calculating the means at our disposal to withstand\r\nsuch a coalition. It should be mentioned that the friendship of Italy\r\nhad been purchased by an arrangement under which she was to take\r\npossession of Massowah and the adjacent coast.\r\n\r\nThe French counter-proposals respecting Egyptian Finance were\r\ncommunicated in the middle of January.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Jan. 20, 1885.\r\n\r\n     I earnestly hope that a settlement of the Egyptian Financial\r\n     Question may be the result of the Cabinet to-day. That question\r\n     seems to me to have a disastrous effect on our foreign relations\r\n     everywhere.\r\n\r\n     Bismarck and Ferry are _jouant au plus fin_ with each other at\r\n     our expense. Each seems to think that he can use the other to help\r\n     in thwarting us, without risk to himself. But Bismarck has the best\r\n     of the game. He occupies the French thoughts, and to some extent\r\n     their forces, at a distance from Europe: he keeps up irritation\r\n     between them and us, and some of the acquisitions he encourages\r\n     them to make (Tonquin for instance) will in all probability\r\n     be a permanent cause of weakness to them. At the same time he\r\n     neutralizes opposition from us to his childish colonial schemes,\r\n     which I cannot help suspecting are founded as much on what, for\r\n     want of a better word, I must call spite against us, as on any\r\n     real expectation of advantage to Germany. Ferry hopes, by means of\r\n     Bismarck and the Powers who follow Bismarck's lead, to carry his\r\n     immediate points in regard to Egypt and other parts of the world,\r\n     and so increase his reputation at home for the moment; and he\r\n     trusts to his skill to enable him to stop before he has so entirely\r\n     alienated us as to be quite at Bismarck's mercy. It is the natural\r\n     disposition of almost all Europe to side against us, as matters\r\n     stand, on the Egyptian Financial Question, which makes this pretty\r\n     game possible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Feb. 3, 1885.\r\n\r\n     I am provoked by Ferry's tardiness in sending Waddington the\r\n     instructions to proceed with the Egyptian Finances Question. He\r\n     has evidently been waiting for the approval of Berlin. I am more\r\n     than ever impatient to get this question disposed of. One, and not\r\n     the least of my reasons, is the desire to get rid of this habit of\r\n     referring every moment to Bismarck.\r\n\r\n     The Tonquin and China affairs seem to get more perplexing\r\n     and more expensive to the French in men and money every day. It\r\n     seems very doubtful that Ferry will get the _action d'éclat_ he is\r\n     looking for there, in time for the election; and if he do not, it\r\n     may go hard with him in the new Chamber.\r\n\r\n     The _Gaulois_ announces that a great Anglo-French meeting is\r\n     to be held in Paris in the month of March, at which a resolution\r\n     is to be voted that England and France must remain united in the\r\n     interests of liberty in Europe. According to the _Gaulois_, 'Mr.\r\n     Cremer, secrétaire general de la Workmen's Peace Association,' is\r\n     in communication about it with M. Clémenceau, who is to organise\r\n     the meeting in conjunction with Mr. Burns, _Membre de la Chambre\r\n     des Communes_, who would come to Paris with a delegation of English\r\n     workmen. If there be any truth in the story, the object of the\r\n     French promoters of this demonstration is probably to embarrass the\r\n     Ferry Government.\r\n\r\nThe Mr. Burns referred to was presumably the present President of the\r\nLocal Government Board, but the description of him as an M.P. was\r\npremature.\r\n\r\nNegotiations between the French and English Governments over the\r\nfinancial proposals were resumed, and eventually some sort of\r\narrangement was arrived at, but in the meanwhile all interest had been\r\ntransferred to the Soudan. The battle of Abou Klea took place on January\r\n19, and on February 5 there arrived the news of the fall of Khartoum\r\nand death of Gordon. The French were not wanting in appreciation of\r\nthe gallantry shown by the British troops, but were prodigal of gloomy\r\nforebodings with regard to the future prospects of the expeditions.\r\nProminent amongst these prophets of evil were Lesseps and Jules Ferry.\r\nLesseps (on the strength of having once been on a tour in the Soudan\r\nwith the ex-Khedive) considered that an attempt to advance would be\r\nmadness, and that the army was in great danger of being surrounded.\r\nHe thought that the only prudent course would be to concentrate the\r\nforces and keep them behind walls and entrenchments until the autumn.\r\nBut even then he did not see how the army could ever get away if it\r\nwere stoutly opposed by the Arabs, as the scarcity of water and other\r\ndifficulties would make the Berber-Suakim route impracticable; and in\r\nshort he was convinced that the only practical plan was to come to\r\nterms with the Mahdi, and that the only means of making terms with the\r\nMadhi would be to reinstate Ismail as Khedive and utilize his influence.\r\nThis surprising conclusion was due to the fact that Lesseps had for a\r\nlong time been exerting himself in every possible way to bring about the\r\nrestoration of Ismail.\r\n\r\nM. Jules Ferry was also full of condolences upon the British position in\r\nthe Soudan, but was, at the same time, not at all enthusiastic about the\r\nFrench position in the Far East. He admitted that the troops in Tonquin\r\nwere sickly and that the climate was odious; that neither in Tonquin\r\nnor Formosa could any blow be struck which China would really feel, but\r\nthat nevertheless 'in the interests of civilization as represented in\r\nthose parts by France and England, it was necessary to deal a stunning\r\nblow (_coup foudroyant_) at the huge Empire of China.' This might be\r\neffected by landing an attacking force in China proper, or by blockading\r\nthe ports, but either of these methods would involve great difficulties\r\nwith other Powers, and the only thing that remained to be done was\r\nto dismember the Empire. Once China was broken up into three or four\r\nprovinces she would become comparatively harmless. M. Jules Ferry's\r\nviews were expressed after a dinner at the Embassy, and Lord Lyons in\r\nreporting the conversation remarked that his wine must be more heady\r\nthan he imagined.\r\n\r\nBefore long, however, a crisis in another part of the world temporarily\r\ndistracted attention from Egypt and brought home to every thinking\r\nperson the indefinite and multifarious responsibilities of British rule,\r\nas well as the singularly inadequate military resources available.\r\nProminent British statesmen had long derided the absurdity of supposing\r\nthat England and Russia could ever become involved in disputes in\r\nCentral Asia, but, profiting by our embarrassments in Egypt, the\r\nRussian Government had adopted so aggressive a policy, that even the\r\npeace-loving Gladstone Government found itself on the brink of a\r\ncollision before the end of February. This critical situation and the\r\npossibility of a conflict between England and Russia, far from giving\r\nsatisfaction to the French, afforded them just cause for anxiety.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 13, 1885.\r\n\r\n     The critical state of things between England and Russia has\r\n     come more home to the French mind during the last few days, and\r\n     is looked upon with increased alarm. Whatever may be Bismarck's\r\n     feelings and plans, the French cannot help feeling that it would\r\n     be a great danger to them for him to be without counterpoise in\r\n     Europe. Those who believe that they see far ahead, declare that\r\n     Bismarck's ultimate object is Holland, and that Belgium, or a part\r\n     of Belgium, is to be given to France as a compensation for the\r\n     annexation of Holland to Germany. To this end they conceive that\r\n     Bismarck has aimed at embroiling Russia with England, so that the\r\n     one may paralyse the other; at separating England and France, and\r\n     at setting up an alliance between France and Germany. It is to\r\n     be hoped that many Frenchmen would shrink from taking part in an\r\n     iniquity which would be equalled only by the partition of Poland.\r\n     It is to be supposed that none can be so blind as not to see that\r\n     Bismarck will never make a territorial arrangement which would\r\n     increase the relative strength of France as compared with that of\r\n     Germany. It can hardly be doubted that Bismarck must be well aware\r\n     that so far from the gift of Belgium reconciling the French to the\r\n     loss of Alsace and Lorraine, any additional power that gift might\r\n     confer upon them would certainly be used, on the first opportunity,\r\n     for the recovery of the two lost Provinces.\r\n\r\n     To people who incline to more simple and obvious explanations\r\n     of political conduct, Bismarck himself seems to be rather old to\r\n     indulge in any hope of executing schemes of this kind. Moreover,\r\n     the character of the Emperor would in all probability prevent his\r\n     sanctioning such proceedings, while His Majesty's death would,\r\n     in all probability, greatly diminish, if not put an end to,\r\n     Bismarck's influence. Bismarck may in fact be working in order to\r\n     attain smaller and more immediate objects, and to gratify personal\r\n     feelings.\r\n\r\n     However all this may be, the French decidedly wish to prevent\r\n     a rupture between England and Russia. They do not relish the\r\n     effect upon the position of Bismarck in Europe which would be\r\n     the consequence of France herself, England and Russia, being all\r\n     hampered by being engaged in wars in the extreme East.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Granville to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    March 14, 1885.\r\n\r\n     I doubt the Russians going quite to extremes, but the risk is\r\n     great.\r\n\r\n     Bismarck is behaving as ill as possible--after the mission of\r\n     peace and a complete making up, creating difficulties at the last\r\n     moment about Egyptian finances, concerning which he promised that\r\n     no objections would be raised by Germany, if France and England\r\n     were agreed. It is supposed to be with a view to getting a decree\r\n     against us at Cairo before the settlement.\r\n\r\nThe military preparations for a possible struggle with Russia were\r\ntypical of the manner in which British statesmen occasionally prepare\r\nfor the worst. In order to strike terror into a Power which could\r\ndispose of millions of soldiers, two army corps of 25,000 men each\r\nwere ordered to be mobilized in India, and as 'a time of emergency had\r\narrived,' it was announced that the first-class army reserve and militia\r\nreserve would be called out; their total numbers amounting to the\r\nstupendous figure of about 70,000 men. By these steps it was hoped that\r\nthe greatest military Power in the world would be overawed.\r\n\r\nFrom one embarrassment Her Majesty's Government were fortunately\r\nrelieved, the basis of an arrangement with France having been arrived\r\nat with regard to Egyptian Finance. Mr. Gladstone, with whom Lord Lyons\r\nhad been requested to communicate direct, wrote expressing his relief,\r\nbut was obviously far more concerned to demonstrate the turpitude of his\r\npolitical opponents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Gladstone to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    10, Downing St., March 21, 1885.\r\n\r\n     When you so kindly wrote to me about Egyptian Finance, I did\r\n     not reply. Not because I was insensible or forgetful, but because\r\n     the unsatisfactory condition of the question made it so difficult.\r\n     Now, thank God, we are through, as far as Foreign Powers are\r\n     concerned; and we have thus far escaped from a position the most\r\n     hopeless and helpless that it is possible to conceive.\r\n\r\n     It remains a subject of regret, and of some surprise, that\r\n     the Opposition are pressing for time before we take the vote, in\r\n     a manner quite unusual, with almost a certainty of bankruptcy and\r\n     financial chaos in Egypt, and the likelihood of consequences more\r\n     than financial if we comply; and all this, as far as we can make\r\n     out, because of the disorganized condition of the Tory party. It\r\n     seems that the mutinous followers have exacted this condition from\r\n     their leaders, as some reparation for the agreement about the Seats\r\n     Bill, and for their other offences.\r\n\r\n     To be defeated on the agreement would be _most_ convenient\r\n     for the Government (for me priceless) but somewhat ruinous or\r\n     mischievous, I think, to all the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n     We must of course hold our ground.\r\n\r\nThe rooted belief of Ministers that their continuance in office is\r\nabsolutely essential to the welfare of the universe as well as to that\r\nof the British Empire is, of course, a well-known phenomenon which has\r\nmanifested itself in more recent times in the case of both political\r\nparties. In 1885 the difficulties of the Gladstone Government continued\r\nto grow, and it was fortunate for Lord Granville's peace of mind that he\r\nwas an optimist by nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Granville to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    March 25, 1885.\r\n\r\n     The incorrigible Turk has not yet sent instructions to\r\n     Musurus. We have tried the most serious threats, which Musurus\r\n     believes will be successful.\r\n\r\n     But if we do not take care, we shall soon be at war with the\r\n     Mahdi, with Turkey, and with the Russians.\r\n\r\n     I do not know how the latter question will finish. Being of\r\n     a sanguine disposition, I hope for the best. We are determined to\r\n     take a firm stand.\r\n\r\n     Do you believe that the French have many tricks in hand for\r\n     the Suez Canal Commission?\r\n\r\nEarly in April there arrived the news of the fight at Penjdeh, where,\r\nto use Gladstone's own expression, the attack of the Russians upon\r\nthe Afghans 'bore the appearance of an unprovoked aggression.' A\r\nfinancial panic took place, consols fell 3 per cent., Russian stocks 9\r\nper cent., and for a short time the impression prevailed that war was\r\ninevitable. In the House of Commons, Mr. Gladstone made one of those\r\neloquent statements which were so widely accepted by his followers as a\r\nsatisfactory solution of any outstanding difficulty, but which failed to\r\nreassure the more intelligent; and even the optimistic Lord Granville\r\nfelt some uncomfortable qualms.\r\n\r\n     'It is too dreadful,' he wrote on April 10th, 'jumping from\r\n     one nightmare into another.\r\n\r\n     'Once at war with Russia we shall be obliged to toady Germany,\r\n     France, and Turkey.\r\n\r\n     'But I cannot believe that it will come to war. It cannot be\r\n     a good move of the Russians to have created a blood feud with the\r\n     Afghans.\r\n\r\n     'Not having a genius for war, I do not know how we are\r\n     effectively to carry it on against Russia, although it is not off\r\n     the cards that it may break her up.'\r\n\r\nProbably Lord Granville was not singular in his inability to see how a\r\nwar on land was to be effectively carried on against Russia.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the French were not without their own foreign troubles.\r\nM. Jules Ferry had spoken of the necessity of inflicting a _coup\r\nfoudroyant_. The _coup foudroyant_ fell in a totally unexpected fashion\r\nupon his own head, in the shape of a defeat of the French forces at\r\nLang-Son. The news of the reverse arrived in Paris on March 25, and\r\ncreated so absurd a panic and so strong a feeling against Spirited\r\nColonial Policy that Jules Ferry at once bowed to the storm and resigned\r\non the 31st. He had been in office for the unprecedented period of two\r\nyears and one month, which alone was sufficient cause for disappearance;\r\nnor could it be said that his administration had been colourless, for he\r\nhad passed an important Education Bill, established the Protectorate of\r\nFrance in Tunis, and annexed Tonquin and Madagascar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 31, 1885.\r\n\r\n     Ferry was certainly at work quietly with negotiations for\r\n     peace with China, and no doubt he calculated on playing it as a\r\n     high trump at the Elections; and a great card it would have been\r\n     for him, for the war in Tonquin is extremely unpopular. The reverse\r\n     at Lang-Son has changed all this; the extreme Right have always\r\n     had a special hatred of Ferry on account of the suppression of the\r\n     religious communities, and Clémenceau and the extreme Left have\r\n     become bitterly hostile to him personally. Not many of his own\r\n     party cared to stick to him when their own popularity would have\r\n     been risked by doing so. And, besides, he had been in office for\r\n     two years; a very unusually long period of late, and people were\r\n     tired of him.\r\n\r\n     Freycinet is now trying to form a Cabinet. It is not certain\r\n     that he will succeed, and if he does succeed, it is very doubtful\r\n     whether his Cabinet will last. His idea seems to be to take into it\r\n     Republicans of all shades, not excluding deep Red. The Republicans\r\n     have been rather startled by the progress, far from great though\r\n     it has been, of the Conservatives and Monarchists (Orleanist and\r\n     Imperialist) in the constituencies; and the notion seems to be that\r\n     the importance to them of resisting this, may keep them together\r\n     and prevent them quarrelling with each other, at all events until\r\n     after the Elections. But anyway, each change of Ministry produces\r\n     a further step towards the Left, and there is a foundation for the\r\n     fear that there may be socialist legislation against property and\r\n     proprietors, and that the Government may by degrees throw away all\r\n     the means of resisting anarchy.\r\n\r\n     Freycinet's own tendencies would be towards peace. Now there\r\n     is nothing but flame and fury against the Chinese, but considering\r\n     the general unpopularity of the war this may to a certain extent\r\n     subside. He would, I think, desire to be on good terms with all\r\n     countries. He would hardly be so subservient to Bismarck as Ferry\r\n     had lately become. It so happens that personally he and I are\r\n     particularly good friends.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of April the British Government asked for a credit\r\nof eleven millions, and the eloquence of Mr. Gladstone worked his\r\nfaithful followers up to a belief in verbiage which is almost pathetic.\r\n'Gladstone's magnificent speech had a great effect here,' wrote Lord\r\nGranville. 'It will hasten the _dénouement_ one way or the other in\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\n'I understand that the Emperor is decidedly pacific; but he believes his\r\nfather lost himself from want of firmness, that he himself is determined\r\nto be firm, and that the particular firmness which appeals to him, is\r\nnot that which goes against the wishes of his army.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 1, 1885.\r\n\r\n     A war between England and Russia is much dreaded by the\r\n     French. They fear that it would leave Bismarck without any\r\n     counterpoise in Europe. Any influence they may have will no doubt\r\n     be exercised in favour of peace, but their influence at this moment\r\n     does not count very much. I do not know that they would have any\r\n     strong sympathy with Russia if hostilities broke out, but such a\r\n     feeling would be produced by anything which irritated them with us\r\n     on account of Egyptian or other matters. Anyhow we must be prepared\r\n     to find them exacting and susceptible.\r\n\r\n     The consequences of the war as regards the money market here\r\n     would be disastrous; but it is believed they would be still more\r\n     disastrous at Berlin.\r\n\r\n     The dangerous point is considered here to be the notions of\r\n     military honour, of a peculiar kind, which prevail in the Russian\r\n     as much as, or more than, in other Continental armies.\r\n\r\n     These military notions in the armies do not at all require\r\n     that the rulers of the armies should keep their words to\r\n     foreigners, or abide by their international engagements; but they\r\n     do require that, right or wrong, the rulers should not allow the\r\n     _amour-propre_ of the army to be wounded. The Emperor of Russia\r\n     probably shares these feelings, and at any rate he would certainly\r\n     be afraid to run counter to them. Those here who profess to\r\n     understand Russia declare that she has no desire to take Herat or\r\n     to annex any part of Afghanistan. They think that the ultimate\r\n     object at which she is really aiming is to extend her possessions\r\n     to the Persian Gulf, and that she would be tractable enough about\r\n     the Afghan frontier, if that question were separated from military\r\n     honour, or rather vanity.\r\n\r\n     I met Freycinet and Herbette at dinner yesterday. They seemed\r\n     to be much relieved at having got rid of the _Bosphore Egyptien_\r\n     difficulty, and to be really much obliged to you for the help you\r\n     had given to them.\r\n\r\nThe _Bosphore Egyptien_, a French newspaper in Cairo which continually\r\nattacked the British administration in Egypt with unparalleled\r\nmalignity, had at length worn out the patience of Sir Evelyn Baring, and\r\nbeen temporarily suspended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 15, 1885.\r\n\r\n     The symptoms apparent here indicate that Bismarck is busily\r\n     employed in getting up a European coalition against England on the\r\n     Egyptian question. He has very nearly succeeded, if not quite, in\r\n     isolating us in the Suez Canal Commission. He would seem to have\r\n     put great pressure for this purpose upon Italy, who was disposed to\r\n     side with us, and to have frightened or cajoled Holland and Spain.\r\n     With Russia and Austria he seems to have made a regular cabal. It\r\n     has required great tact and firmness on Pauncefote's part to have\r\n     resisted the endeavours to turn the Commission into a political\r\n     conference on the whole Egyptian question, and at the same time\r\n     to have avoided breaking it up prematurely. Another circumstance\r\n     which Bismarck is using as a lever against us, is the levying by\r\n     the Egyptian Government of the tax upon the coupon, before the\r\n     Financial Convention has been ratified by all the parties to it.\r\n\r\n     He has sent Courcel here from Berlin to seduce or terrify\r\n     the French Government, and is said to have charged him with large\r\n     offers relative to establishing an international administration in\r\n     Egypt, and assigning to France a preponderant influence in such an\r\n     administration. What the real offers may be, of course, I cannot\r\n     say, but I think the French are half afraid of them. Probably, like\r\n     all Bismarck's demonstrations in so-called support of France, they\r\n     contain the essential elements--the employing a considerable number\r\n     of French troops at a distance from France, and the promoting\r\n     ill-will between France and England.\r\n\r\nThese suspicions as to Bismarck's motives were confirmed by Lord\r\nRosebery, who at the time occupied a minor post in the Gladstone\r\nadministration, and had lately paid a visit to Germany.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Granville to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    May 30, 1885.\r\n\r\n     Rosebery has not yet written out the report (which Blowitz\r\n     saw), but he has given me a full account from his notes.\r\n\r\n     Bismarck acknowledged that he had been thwarting us in every\r\n     way; but at the last conversation (influenced, Rosebery thought,\r\n     by an unsatisfactory conversation with Courcel) he was much more\r\n     conciliatory.\r\n\r\n     He was exceedingly civil to Rosebery; hostile to Gladstone,\r\n     and especially to Derby.\r\n\r\n     He is a great man, but he sees through a great many\r\n     millstones.\r\n\r\n     The Emperor is certainly unwell. Rosebery is convinced that\r\n     Bismarck will retire for a time on his death.\r\n\r\nJudging from the material available, no statesman ever disliked so many\r\npersons as Bismarck, and the objects of his antipathy were not confined\r\nto his own sex. Busch's book and the works of other authors contain\r\nfrequent references to the grievances which he entertained towards women\r\nwho were alleged to have interfered with his policy, and, whether these\r\ncharges were well founded or not, he made no secret of his animosity\r\nagainst even so important a personage as the Empress Augusta. In fact\r\nthere can be little doubt that it was owing to the despotic influence\r\nexercised by the Chancellor that the Empress, who had had the misfortune\r\nto incur his displeasure, was forced to leave Berlin and to reside for a\r\nconsiderable period at Coblentz.\r\n\r\nApparently the man who inspired him with the greatest aversion was\r\nGortschakoff, but it is easy to understand that from the Bismarckian\r\npoint of view, Mr. Gladstone and Lord Derby represented a singularly\r\nfutile type of statesman. Lord Rosebery's prophecy with regard to his\r\nretirement was only partially correct. In private conversation, Bismarck\r\nis understood to have calculated upon three years of office under the\r\npresent German Emperor; whereas he only succeeded in remaining for two,\r\nand his retirement was compulsory and not voluntary.\r\n\r\nOne of the notable events in Paris in 1885 was the death of Victor Hugo.\r\nHis funeral was made the occasion of a great ceremonial, and Queen\r\nVictoria, who was always much interested in functions of this nature,\r\ndesired that she should be furnished with a special report. Any one\r\nwho happened to have been a witness of the Victor Hugo funeral would\r\ncorroborate the accuracy of the following account, which is probably in\r\nstriking contrast to the word pictures of the newspaper correspondents\r\nof the time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Paris, June 4, 1885.\r\n\r\n     Lord Lyons presents his humble duty to Your Majesty and\r\n     in obedience to Your Majesty's commands, proceeds to state the\r\n     impression made upon him by the funeral of Victor Hugo.\r\n\r\n     There was nothing striking, splendid or appropriate, either in\r\n     the monstrous catafalque erected under the Arc de Triomphe, or in\r\n     the trappings of the funeral. There was nothing mournful or solemn\r\n     in the demeanour of the people. The impressive part of the scene\r\n     consisted in the vast crowds from all parts of France and from many\r\n     other countries. As decorations of the scene, were the innumerable\r\n     wreaths, some conveyed in cars and some carried in the hands of\r\n     those who offered them.\r\n\r\n     The aspect was that of a vast assemblage of people gathered\r\n     together for some ordinary demonstration, or from curiosity. On\r\n     the other hand, perfect order was preserved. Both those who joined\r\n     in the procession and those who lined the streets through which it\r\n     passed, maintained the good humour and civility which are seldom\r\n     wanting to a Paris crowd. At some points attempts were made to\r\n     raise anarchical or socialistic cries, but met with no response.\r\n     The distance from the point of departure to the Arc de Triomphe is\r\n     about three miles by the route taken, which was through some of the\r\n     finest avenues of Paris. The procession began at 11 o'clock in the\r\n     morning and went on until after 4 in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n     The general impression left upon Lord Lyons by the day was one\r\n     of weariness and unconcern. The orderliness of the people was a\r\n     satisfactory symptom, but the total absence of strong feeling was\r\n     chilling, and the studied avoidance of any recognition of religion\r\n     did away with all solemnity.\r\n\r\nOn June 12, the Gladstone Government, having been defeated during a\r\nBudget debate, resigned, and left to the Conservatives the ungrateful\r\ntask of facing an accumulation of difficulties while in a minority in\r\nthe House of Commons. Lord Salisbury took Lord Granville's place at the\r\nForeign Office and the transfer was marked by a double compliment to\r\nLord Lyons. Lord Granville, who was always extremely popular with all\r\nthose with whom he was in any way connected, with habitual kindliness\r\nand generosity expressed his obligations to the Ambassador. 'An ordinary\r\nletter of farewell and of thanks would very inadequately express my\r\nfeelings to you. I cannot say how much I have valued the loyal and\r\nimportant assistance you have given me in most difficult circumstances.'\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury showed his appreciation by at once asking him to come\r\nover to England in order to discuss the general situation, and upon\r\nhis return to Paris in July, he was able to report that the change of\r\nGovernment in England appeared to have had a beneficial effect upon\r\nAnglo-French relations. 'The statement you made in the House of Lords\r\nhas made an excellent impression. Freycinet seems to be really disposed\r\nto abstain from endeavouring to thwart us or to raise difficulties for\r\nus with regard to Egyptian Finance. He also appears to be inclined to\r\ncome to terms with us about Newfoundland and other matters.'\r\n\r\n'I think he is sincerely desirous to put the relations between the\r\ntwo countries on a good footing, but I cannot yet say that he will be\r\nwilling to make sacrifices for this purpose.'\r\n\r\nAs Freycinet, however, showed few symptoms of being willing to retire\r\nfrom the position he had taken up with regard to the eventual British\r\nevacuation of Egypt, and to the resumption by France of an influence\r\nequal with our own, his professions of friendship did not appear to be\r\nof much value. Some apprehension too was caused by the ostentatious\r\nannouncements in the French press, that the numerous military forces in\r\nthe Far East released in consequence of the conclusion of peace with\r\nChina would return by the Suez Canal and would therefore be 'available\r\nfor other purposes in the Mediterranean.' What was perhaps more\r\nencouraging, was the increasing distaste for Spirited Colonial Policy\r\ncombined with renewed distrust of Bismarck's intentions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 14, 1885.\r\n\r\n     I have been rejoiced by your telegram announcing that Germany,\r\n     Austria, and Italy agree to the issue of the Egyptian Loan Decree.\r\n     It looks as if you were on the eve of settling the question most\r\n     pressing in point of time (that of the money for Egypt), and I\r\n     hope it augurs well for the disposition generally of the German\r\n     Chancellor. The National Fête here puts a stop to all business for\r\n     to-day, but I shall see Freycinet about the issue of the Decree\r\n     to-morrow.\r\n\r\n     The debate on the Budget for 1886 elicited some curious\r\n     speeches in the Chamber of Deputies three days ago on the\r\n     'Expéditions lointaines.' There was no difficulty in showing that\r\n     they had all cost more than they were worth. They were plainly held\r\n     by the Deputies to be unpopular in the country, and condemnation of\r\n     them is likely to be one of the election cries of the extreme Left.\r\n     But hardly any one seemed to see the way to bring them to an end.\r\n     In fact, it looked as if France had got into the groove which by a\r\n     fatality leads to annexation and conquest by strong and civilized\r\n     nations when they once begin to establish themselves amongst weak\r\n     and barbarous peoples. All this may delight Prince Bismarck,\r\n     whose avowed object is to find an outlet for what he calls French\r\n     vanity and restlessness, and a gulf to swallow up French troops\r\n     and treasures at a distance from Europe. From a certain point of\r\n     view this may not be without its advantages to other nations; but\r\n     it is not without danger to the good relations between France and\r\n     England--between whom awkward questions may arise all over the\r\n     world. In the present I am uneasy about Siam and more so about\r\n     Burmah. It is not a pleasant speculation to consider the change\r\n     which may be produced in no very remote future, in the condition\r\n     of our Indian Empire, if it be in contact with a great European\r\n     Power both on the north and on the east.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1885, a prodigious outburst of Anglophobia occurred in Paris\r\nin consequence of mendacious statements published by Rochefort in his\r\nnewspaper, charging the British military authorities in the Soudan\r\nwith the assassination of a certain Olivier Pain. Olivier Pain was an\r\nex-Communist and French journalist who had accompanied the Turks in\r\nthe campaign of 1877, and who was reputed to be occasionally employed\r\nby the Turkish Government as a secret agent. In the spring of 1884,\r\nhe had set off to join the Mahdi, and having completely disappeared\r\nfrom view, and being presumably dead, Rochefort took the opportunity\r\nto announce that Lord Wolseley had procured his death by offering a\r\nreward of fifty pounds for his head. The enterprise had been allotted to\r\nMajor Kitchener[43]: 'un sinistre gredin nourri de psaumes et abreuvé\r\nde whisky qui a eu le premier, l'idée de mettre à prix la tête de celui\r\nqu'il appelait \"l'espion français.\"'\r\n\r\nAs, however, it was impossible to reach Lord Wolseley and the\r\n'sinistre gredin,' Rochefort urged that vengeance should be taken upon\r\n'l'Ambassadeur Lyons.' 'A partir d'aujourd'hui il est notre ôtage!\r\nSa vieille peau est le gage de la satisfaction qui nous est due.'\r\n'L'Ambassadeur Lyons' was, however, also beyond reach, as he happened to\r\nbe on leave, and it was, therefore, suggested that the few secretaries\r\n(of whom I was one), who were then in Paris, should be forthwith strung\r\nup to the lamp-posts in the Rue du Faubourg St. Honoré. The astonishing\r\nthing was that these ravings were actually taken more or less seriously,\r\nand that for some time the French authorities found it necessary to\r\nprotect the Embassy with numerous police detachments.\r\n\r\nIt has always been one of the inscrutable mysteries that Rochefort,\r\never since the Commune, was allowed a toleration accorded to no one\r\nelse, on the ground of his alleged exceptional wit and humour, whereas\r\nhis effusions consisted almost entirely of gross personal abuse of the\r\nlowest type, levelled indiscriminately at prominent individuals of any\r\ndescription, and largely directed against England, whose hospitality he\r\nenjoyed during many years of exile.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: _Times_ correspondent in Paris.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Col. the Hon.

The truth was that the\r\nBurmese resistance to the Indian Government was largely due to French\r\nencouragement. As far back as 1883 a Burmese Mission had arrived in\r\nParis, and kept studiously aloof from the British Embassy; and although\r\nevery opportunity had been taken to impress upon the French Government\r\nthe peculiar relations between Burmah and British India, there was not\r\nthe least doubt that the object of the Burmese had been to obtain from\r\nthe French Government such a Treaty as would enable them to appeal\r\nto France in the event of their being involved in difficulties with\r\nEngland. How much encouragement they actually received is not known, but\r\nit was probably sufficient to effect their undoing.\r\n\r\n     The papers are abusing us about Burmah, and being quite\r\n     innocent of any aggression themselves in that part of the world,\r\n     are horrified at our holding our own there. Nevertheless, I hope\r\n     the Indian Government will finish the thing out of hand, for an\r\n     ugly state of feeling about it is growing up here.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which the operations against Burmah were conducted\r\nleft nothing to be desired. The campaign was over within a few weeks;\r\non January 1, 1886, the annexation of Burmah was proclaimed, and the\r\naffairs of that country ceased to be of any further interest to the\r\nFrench Government.\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury's tenure of the Foreign Office, which had been marked\r\nby so successful a policy that even Mr. Gladstone had expressed\r\nsatisfaction, came to an end early in 1886, and he was succeeded by Lord\r\nRosebery. 'The irony of events,' wrote the latter to Lord Lyons, 'has\r\nsent me to the Foreign Office, and one of the incidents of this which\r\nis most agreeable to me, is that it brings me into close relations with\r\nyourself.'\r\n\r\nAlthough the Paris press had circulated a ridiculous fiction that Lord\r\nRosebery (presumably because he was personally acquainted with Bismarck)\r\nwas anti-French by inclination, the change of Government in England was\r\nreceived in France with perfect equanimity, as had been the case in the\r\nprevious autumn.\r\n\r\nThe new Foreign Secretary, however, could not fail to be painfully\r\nimpressed by the unsatisfactory feeling which obviously existed in\r\nFrance towards England, and found it difficult of explanation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Rosebery to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    March 3, 1886.\r\n\r\n     I am rather anxious about the attitude of the French. In\r\n     my short tenure of office they have brought up three or four\r\n     questions, all in the highest degree distasteful to us.\r\n\r\n     1. The Consul at Suakim: as to which they say, with accuracy\r\n     which is disputed, that they had gone too far and could not\r\n     withdraw the appointment.\r\n\r\n     2. Arbitration on the Somali coast troubles: as to which they\r\n     declare that Salisbury promised it, which Salisbury, I understand,\r\n     denies.\r\n\r\n     3. The revival of the Suez Canal Commission.\r\n\r\n     4. The announcement made to me by Waddington yesterday that\r\n     they should be obliged shortly to send a cargo of recidivists to\r\n     the Isle of Pines. I remonstrated strongly with him, and indeed\r\n     I cannot foresee all the consequences, should they carry their\r\n     intention into effect. One, however, I do clearly perceive, which\r\n     is that we should have to denounce the Postal Convention of 1856,\r\n     which gives the Messageries privileges in Australian ports, which\r\n     could not be sustained, and which the colonists would not for a\r\n     moment, under such circumstances, respect.\r\n\r\n     But these are details. What I want to point out is the\r\n     apparent animus displayed in these different proceedings. I shall\r\n     not mention them to my colleagues until I hear your view of them,\r\n     and anything you may be able to collect on the subject.\r\n\r\n     What does it all mean? These things did not occur during the\r\n     late Government? Are they directed against the new Administration?\r\n     I cannot view them as a chapter of accidents.\r\n\r\n     As for myself, I have entered upon this office with the most\r\n     sincere wish to be friendly with France. There can be no earthly\r\n     reason why we should not be so. It is a pity, therefore, that our\r\n     cordiality should be poisoned at its source.\r\n\r\n     I wish you would let me know what you think of all this. You\r\n     can pick up much directly, and perhaps even more indirectly, on\r\n     these points. Pray forgive the length of this letter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Rosebery._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 5, 1886.\r\n\r\n     I have naturally been on the watch since you came into office\r\n     for indications of the feelings of the French Government respecting\r\n     the change. In answer to your letter of the day before yesterday,\r\n     asking my opinion, I can only say that I think the French are quite\r\n     as well disposed towards the new Government as they were to the\r\n     late one--indeed, of the two, I should say better. We come so much\r\n     into contact with the French all over the globe that questions\r\n     more or less unpleasant are always arising in smaller or greater\r\n     numbers, according to circumstances; and French feeling is in a\r\n     chronic state of irritability about Egypt.\r\n\r\n     The four subjects you mention are certainly annoying, but I do\r\n     not believe that the French proceedings respecting them have been\r\n     actuated by any animus against the present English Ministry.\r\n\r\n     I shall be somewhat staggered in this opinion, however, if the\r\n     French Government proposes to substitute arbitration by any third\r\n     Power for the understanding that the Somali coast questions shall\r\n     be treated by friendly negotiations between the two Governments,\r\n     and that meanwhile the _status quo_ shall not be disturbed. With a\r\n     view to proceeding with the negotiation, M. Waddington proposed to\r\n     Lord Salisbury on Jan. 20th, and by a written note the next day,\r\n     that an inquiry should be made on the spot by two Commissioners,\r\n     one English and one French. Lord Salisbury received the verbal\r\n     proposal favourably, but did not at the moment give a definitive\r\n     answer.\r\n\r\n     The proposal to reassemble the Suez Canal Commission is simply\r\n     the renewal of a proposal made by M. Waddington to Lord Salisbury\r\n     at the beginning of January.\r\n\r\n     The most serious of the affairs you mention appears to me to\r\n     be the imminent despatch of a cargo of _récidivistes_ to the Isle\r\n     of Pines. I have seen from the beginning the importance of this\r\n     _récidiviste_ question as regards public feeling in Australia,\r\n     and there is hardly any question about which I have taken so much\r\n     trouble. I have attacked successive French Ministers upon it in\r\n     season and out of season, but I have never succeeded in obtaining\r\n     any promise that _récidivistes_ should not be sent to the Pacific.\r\n     As I reported to you, I remonstrated with Freycinet about the\r\n     intention actually to send off a batch, as soon as I became aware\r\n     of it. I did not perceive any difference in his manner or language\r\n     from what they had been when some other Ministers had been in\r\n     office in England, but my remonstrances were equally ineffectual. I\r\n     am glad you had an opportunity of speaking strongly to Waddington.\r\n     I see troubles ahead, for the Australians have before now\r\n     threatened to pass Dominion laws against French ships found to have\r\n     escaped convicts on board, which seem to go a good deal beyond\r\n     international usage, not to say law.\r\n\r\n     It is time, however, for me to wind up this long story. My\r\n     answer to your question is that I am far from thinking that there\r\n     is any _malus animus_ against Her Majesty's present Government on\r\n     the part of Freycinet and his Cabinet. Nor do I know that there is\r\n     more than the usual irritability towards England among the French\r\n     public; but still I feel strongly that it behoves us to tread\r\n     cautiously as well as firmly, when we are coming upon French ground.\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1886 was noticeable for another Government onslaught\r\nupon such members of ex-reigning families as were then residing in\r\nFrance. Of these the most conspicuous were the Orleans Princes. There\r\nwas nothing in their conduct to cause alarm to the Republic, as they\r\nconfined themselves to taking part in social functions, at which they\r\nmaintained a kind of semi-state, being always attended by ladies and\r\ngentlemen-in-waiting after the manner of recognized Royal personages.\r\nThis innocent procedure was sufficient excuse to work up an agitation\r\nagainst them, and to introduce an Expulsion Bill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Rosebery._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 25, 1886.\r\n\r\n     The question of the day is the expulsion of the Princes. The\r\n     measure, if taken, will be quite unjustifiable, discreditable to\r\n     the Government, and, I should say, not at all injurious to the\r\n     cause of the victims. Considering the people and the institutions\r\n     with which they had to deal, the partisans of the Orleans Princes\r\n     have not been so prudent and correct as the Princes themselves.\r\n     They have gone about twitting the Republicans with weakness for\r\n     permitting the very mild demonstration made by the Royalists, and\r\n     declaring that such want of vigour was simply a sign of the decay\r\n     of the Republic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The general opinion is that the Expulsion Bill will pass in\r\n     its present, or even in an aggravated form, and that if it does,\r\n     the Government will proceed to expel the Comte de Paris at least,\r\n     if not the Duc de Chartres, and some others. On the other hand, it\r\n     is not expected that the Bill confiscating the property, real and\r\n     personal, of the Orleans and Bonapartes will be adopted.\r\n\r\n     Much anxiety is felt respecting Boulanger's goings on with\r\n     respect to the army. He seems to think of nothing but currying\r\n     favour with the lowest ranks in the service, and with the mob\r\n     outside. It is believed by many people that he would not act\r\n     vigorously, as Minister of War, against any disturbances, but would\r\n     try to turn them to account and set up for himself as dictator or\r\n     what not.\r\n\r\n     The financial situation is very bad, and if common scandal is\r\n     to be listened to, the very short duration of French Ministries is\r\n     having the effect of making most of the individual Ministers very\r\n     unscrupulous and very impatient to make hay during the very short\r\n     time that the sun shines.\r\n\r\nThe above letter contains one of the first allusions to the enterprising\r\nimpostor Boulanger, who very nearly succeeded in making history, and\r\nof whom much was to be heard for some considerable space of time. His\r\npopularity was due in great measure to the vague discontent which\r\nwas then prevalent in France. People thought that they saw the same\r\ninefficiency in the Government, the same relaxation of authority, the\r\nsame financial difficulties, and the same venality which marked the last\r\ndays of the Second Empire. There seemed to be no individual, in or out\r\nof the Royal or Imperial Dynasties, capable of exciting any enthusiasm\r\nor of inspiring any confidence, and public feeling was in that state of\r\nlassitude and dissatisfaction which might give a reasonable chance for a\r\nbold stroke for power.\r\n\r\nThe scandalous Expulsion Bill passed both Chambers, and the Princes took\r\ntheir departure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Rosebery._\r\n\r\n    Paris, June 25, 1886.\r\n\r\n     The departure of the Comte de Paris from Eu has been\r\n     accompanied by many very sad circumstances, but I cannot help\r\n     thinking that his political position is improved by his expulsion.\r\n     His own partisans are much pleased at its having elicited from\r\n     him a distinct assertion of a claim to the throne, and of a\r\n     determination to work for the restoration of monarchy.\r\n\r\n     It is less easy to give an opinion on the position of the\r\n     Princes who have remained in France. It seems to be hardly\r\n     compatible with dignity and comfort, considering the unabated\r\n     hostility to them of the Reds, who seem generally to end in\r\n     overpowering all generous and conservative feelings in the Chambers\r\n     and in the Government.\r\n\r\n     Prince Napoleon and his son Prince Victor went off in opposite\r\n     directions, one to Geneva, the other to Brussels. The departure of\r\n     neither seems to have made much apparent sensation in Paris when\r\n     it took place, but I am far from certain that Prince Victor is not\r\n     really a more formidable opponent to the Republic than is the Comte\r\n     de Paris.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Rosebery._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 2, 1886.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The topic of the day here is the conduct of the Minister of\r\n     War, General Boulanger. He was supposed to be an Orleanist. Then\r\n     he went round to Clémençeau, and was put into Freycinet's Cabinet\r\n     as a representative of the Clémençeau party, which though not the\r\n     most Red in the Chamber, is more Red than the Freycinet section.\r\n     Since he has been in office Boulanger has lost no opportunity of\r\n     ingratiating himself with the Radicals, and he has been travelling\r\n     about the country making speeches, the object of which has\r\n     evidently been to gain personal popularity for himself without\r\n     regard to his colleagues.\r\n\r\n     He has also by degrees put creatures of his own into the\r\n     great military commands. A crisis was produced, during the last\r\n     few days, by his quarrelling with General Saussier, the military\r\n     Governor of Paris, and provoking him into resigning. He is also\r\n     said to have used strange language in the Council of Ministers. At\r\n     any rate, President Grévy and the Ministers seem to have thought\r\n     they would be more comfortable at Paris without having a satellite\r\n     of Boulanger as Governor, and they have insisted upon declining\r\n     Saussier's resignation. From the way people talk, one would think\r\n     that the questions were whether Boulanger is aiming at being a\r\n     Cromwell or a Monk, and if a Monk, which dynasty he will take up.\r\n\r\n     There is a good deal of alarm here about foreign affairs. The\r\n     reports of a large concentration of Russian troops in Bessarabia\r\n     are supposed to confirm other indications that Russia is meditating\r\n     a revenge for the check she has sustained with regard to Bulgaria.\r\n     This, it is supposed, must bring Austria into the field. Moreover,\r\n     Bismarck does not seem to be in an amiable mood towards France;\r\n     and with or without instigation from him, Germans talk as if war\r\n     was inevitable.\r\n\r\n     Then the Republic here has lasted sixteen years, and that is\r\n     about the time which it takes to make the French tired of a form of\r\n     Government. The Republic has not been successful financially, and\r\n     trade and agriculture are not prosperous, nor is the reputation of\r\n     the Republican administration high for purity or efficiency.\r\n\r\n     So there is plenty to croak about for those who are inclined\r\n     to croak.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Rosebery._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 13, 1886.\r\n\r\n     The regular session of the French Chambers is to be closed the\r\n     day after to-morrow, and the Chambers are to spend to-morrow at\r\n     the Review at Longchamps, and I suppose to take part in the other\r\n     nuisances which makes Paris insupportable on a National Fête day.\r\n     I conclude the Chambers will come back in October for an extra\r\n     session as usual. In fact, they have not yet voted the Budget; or,\r\n     I had almost said, any useful measure. In Commercial matters and\r\n     indeed in everything relating to intercourse with other countries,\r\n     they have shown the narrowest and most exclusive spirit. Their\r\n     great feat has been the law for the persecution of the Princes,\r\n     which seems to be carried out as harshly as possible. I should\r\n     not have said that the literal wording of the law necessitated\r\n     or even justified the dismissal from the army of Princes who\r\n     already belonged to it, but I suppose that was the intention of\r\n     the legislators. The Duc d'Aumale's letter to the President is a\r\n     powerful document, but was sure to lead to his expulsion, and was\r\n     perhaps intended to have that effect.\r\n\r\n     Among people who ought to have good information from abroad,\r\n     the alarm as to a war this autumn seems stronger than among\r\n     the French politicians who confine themselves more closely to\r\n     considering French feeling at home. Certainly it comes round to\r\n     one in various ways from Germany that war is very generally\r\n     expected, or at all events talked of there. The accounts current\r\n     in Germany of supposed French provocations look as if there was\r\n     a party there trying to work up hostile feeling against France.\r\n     An alliance between France and Russia seems to be the bugbear. I\r\n     don't see symptoms at present of any war spirit in this country;\r\n     but of course a quarrel between Russia and Germany would be a great\r\n     temptation to French Chauvinism.\r\n\r\nThe abhorred annual fête of July 14, 1886, possessed an interest which\r\nhad been wanting previously, and has never since been renewed. This\r\nwas due to the presence of a number of troops at the Longchamps Review\r\nwho had just returned from Tonquin, and to the excitement caused by\r\nthe first appearance of Boulanger at a big military display in Paris.\r\nNotwithstanding the inflated rubbish which was published the next day in\r\nthe French press, there could not be the least doubt that the Tonquin\r\ntroops were received without the slightest enthusiasm. In Paris the\r\nvery word 'Tonquin' was hated; the country was associated with loss of\r\nlife, and with heavy taxation, and nothing could have expressed more\r\neloquently the disenchantment produced by a Spirited Colonial Policy,\r\nthan the chilling reception accorded to these returned soldiers. The\r\nenthusiasm which should have been bestowed upon these humble instruments\r\nwas lavished upon the charlatan who at that moment was the most\r\nprominent and popular figure in the eye of the French public.\r\n\r\nThe military mountebank (aptly christened by Jules Ferry, 'a music\r\nhall St. Arnaud') had, with some foresight, provided himself with a\r\nhigh-actioned black circus horse, and those who were present on the\r\noccasion will never forget the moment when he advanced to salute the\r\nPresident, and other notabilities established in the official Tribune.\r\nOnly a few days before, it was currently believed, he had terrified his\r\nministerial colleagues by appearing at a Cabinet Council in uniform,\r\nand now as he pranced backwards or forwards on the circus horse and the\r\npublic yelled their acclamations, President Grévy and the uninteresting\r\ncrowd of bourgeois ministers and deputies who surrounded him, seemed\r\nvisibly to quiver and flinch as shuddering memories of December 2 and\r\nother _coups d'état_ obtruded themselves upon their recollections.\r\n\r\nFrom that day Boulanger became a dangerous man; the circus horse\r\nhad done the trick; the general embodied in the public fancy the\r\n_clinquant_, for which the French had so long been sighing in secret;\r\n_l'homme qui monte à cheval_ in place of _l'homme qui monte à la\r\ntribune_, and for a long time he survived even that ridicule which in\r\nFrance is supposed to kill more effectively than elsewhere. Even when\r\nhe engaged in a duel with an elderly and short-sighted civilian, M.\r\nFloquet, and was decisively worsted, he continued to remain a popular\r\nhero.\r\n\r\nLord Rosebery, upon whom the unreasonable ill-feeling then constantly\r\nshown by the French towards England had made a painful impression,\r\nhad realized in May that the Gladstone Government was doomed, and\r\nhad wisely decided in consequence that a process of marking time\r\nwas preferable to embarking upon anything in the nature of a heroic\r\npolicy. Upon his retirement and the formation of a new administration,\r\nLord Lyons experienced what was probably the greatest surprise of his\r\nlife in the shape of the following letter from Lord Salisbury. In\r\norder to reinforce its arguments the late Lord Currie, then Permanent\r\nUnder-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office, was sent over with it to\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _General Boulanger._\r\n\r\nLONDON: EDWARD ARNOLD.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Confidential. July 26, 1886.\r\n\r\n     I accepted yesterday the Queen's commission to form a\r\n     Government. It is a task full of difficulties; and I would have\r\n     gladly seen Lord Hartington undertake it. This, however, he could\r\n     not be induced to do; and the duty falls upon me. One of my first\r\n     thoughts is to provide a Foreign Secretary for the new Government:\r\n     for I could not, with any hope of carrying it through successfully,\r\n     repeat the experiment of last summer by uniting the Foreign\r\n     Secretaryship with the Premiership.\r\n\r\n     There is no one possessing the experience and knowledge of\r\n     Foreign Affairs which you have, and no one whose appointment would\r\n     exercise so great a moral authority in Europe. And we certainly\r\n     have not in our political ranks any one who could claim a tithe of\r\n     the fitness for the office which every one would acknowledge in\r\n     your case. I earnestly hope the proposal may be not unacceptable to\r\n     you. If that should happily be the case, a great difficulty in our\r\n     way will have been most successfully removed.\r\n\r\n     As there is much to be said on the matter which it would be\r\n     too long to write, Currie has very kindly undertaken to take this\r\n     letter over and discuss the matter with you. We have talked it over\r\n     very fully.\r\n\r\n     If you should be in need of any interval of repose, I could\r\n     easily take the seals for a few weeks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris. July 27, 1886.\r\n\r\n     Currie brought me your letter early this morning. In answer to\r\n     it I sent you at 11.30 a.m. the following telegram:--\r\n\r\n     'I am very much gratified, and I am very grateful for the kind\r\n     consideration with which your proposal is accompanied, but my\r\n     age and the state of my health make it quite impossible for me to\r\n     undertake the office.'\r\n\r\n     I hope I need not assure you that I am fully sensible of the\r\n     kindness of your letter, and that if I cannot feel that I merit all\r\n     you say of me, I am at least grateful for your good opinion.\r\n\r\n     The truth is, that I could not now undertake new and laborious\r\n     duties with any confidence that I could discharge them efficiently.\r\n     I feel the need of rest, and I am not equal to beginning a new\r\n     life of hard work. I could not conscientiously assume the great\r\n     responsibility which would be thrown upon me.\r\n\r\nIf the post of Foreign Secretary has ever been offered during the\r\nlast hundred years to any other person outside the ranks of orthodox\r\nparty politicians the secret has been well kept, and it might perhaps\r\nbe suggested that few people would be found with sufficient strength\r\nof mind to decline so glittering a prize. Lord Lyons, however, as is\r\nsufficiently evident, found no difficulty in at once deciding upon the\r\nrefusal of an offer which the ordinary mediocrity would have accepted\r\nwith avidity. In the above letter he founded his refusal upon grounds\r\nof age and ill-health, and in private he used to express the opinion\r\nthat after the age of forty a man's faculties began and continued to\r\ndeteriorate. But it is not in the least likely that he would have\r\naccepted the honour which it was proposed to bestow upon him, at any\r\nperiod of his life. His extreme modesty and diffidence have already\r\nbeen dwelt upon, but a more valuable quality than these is a man's\r\nrealization of his own limitations, and it is probable that Lord Lyons,\r\nby the exercise of his exceptionally impartial judgment, was able to\r\nform a more correct opinion as to his own potentialities than Lord\r\nSalisbury. A thorough and profound knowledge of foreign politics is\r\nnot the sole necessary qualification of an English Foreign Secretary;\r\nhad such been the case, Lord Lyons would have been an ideal occupant\r\nof the post; but in England, where the value of Ministers is gauged\r\nchiefly by the fallacious test of oratorical capacity, the Foreign\r\nSecretary is constantly obliged to make speeches in defence of or in\r\nexplanation of his policy, and although the House of Lords is the\r\nmost long-suffering and good-natured assembly in the world, it would\r\nhave been no easy task for a man of sixty-nine, who had never put two\r\nsentences together in public, to suddenly appear in Parliament as the\r\nrepresentative of one of the most important departments, to say nothing\r\nof public meetings, deputations, banquets, etc. It may also be doubted\r\nwhether, in spite of his many admirable qualities, he was really adapted\r\nfor the post. All his life, he had been merely an instrument--a highly\r\nefficient instrument--of the existing Government, and had received\r\ninstructions, which had invariably been carried out with singular skill\r\nand intelligence. But the responsibility had not been his, and as\r\nForeign Secretary the initiative as well as the responsibility which\r\nwould have rested upon him might have imposed too formidable a strain\r\nupon one of so cautious a temperament. Taking into consideration these\r\ndoubts, his advanced age, failing health, and the effect of depression\r\ncaused by the recent death of his much loved sister, the Dowager Duchess\r\nof Norfolk, the refusal of the Foreign Office by Lord Lyons was only an\r\nadditional instance of that robust common sense which was one of his\r\nmost pronounced characteristics. Lord Rosebery, at all events, thought\r\nthat he had decided wisely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Rosebery to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Dalmeny, Aug. 10, 1886.\r\n\r\n     As my Foreign Office episode is at an end, I write a line of\r\n     good-bye, not as a Minister, but on the footing of what I hope I\r\n     may call friendship.\r\n\r\n     My six months' experience has led me to the conviction that\r\n     our relations with France are really more troublesome than with\r\n     any other Power. She is always wanting something of us which it is\r\n     impossible to give her, and she then says plaintively, 'You never\r\n     do anything for me.' She is quite oblivious of the fact that she\r\n     never loses the opportunity of playing us a trick. Witness the\r\n     secret expedition to the New Hebrides. Nothing would have induced\r\n     me to go on with any one of the negotiations with Waddington until\r\n     they had removed their troops from those islands. Whenever he asked\r\n     for an answer about anything, I always turned the conversation\r\n     round to that interesting spot.\r\n\r\n     With this conviction, therefore, it has been a great comfort\r\n     to feel that you were at Paris.\r\n\r\n     I am not surprised that you did not care about my succession!\r\n     It is a weary post.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Rosebery._\r\n\r\n    Heron's Ghyll, Uckfield, Aug. 17, 1886.\r\n\r\n     Your friendly letter has followed me here and has much\r\n     gratified me.\r\n\r\n     I think you must look back with great satisfaction to your\r\n     time at the Foreign Office. You have certainly won golden opinions\r\n     from your subordinates and from the world at large, which is\r\n     perhaps a less competent judge. My own official intercourse with\r\n     you was certainly both very pleasant to me and very satisfactory.\r\n\r\n     I attribute the difficulties with France more to the\r\n     inevitable consequences of our coming into contact with the French\r\n     in all parts of the world, than to any ill-will on either side,\r\n     although I do not pretend to say that the state of feeling is what\r\n     I could wish it to be.\r\n\r\n     Independently of any other considerations, I felt altogether\r\n     too old to undertake the Foreign Office. I was so convinced of\r\n     this, that I regarded it as what the French call an objection\r\n     _préjudicielle_ to entertaining the question at all.\r\n\r\nThe post which Lord Lyons had declined was accepted by Lord Iddesleigh,\r\nwho had just been removed from the House of Commons, and, as was only\r\nnatural, it is evident that he was in the habit of consulting Lord\r\nSalisbury before taking any step of importance. In October, 1886, with\r\nthe concurrence of Lord Salisbury, Lord Lyons was instructed to approach\r\nthe French Government on the question of Egypt, and to explain the\r\nconditions under which it would be possible to terminate the British\r\nmilitary occupation. There seems to be absolutely no doubt that Her\r\nMajesty's Government were perfectly sincere and honestly desirous of\r\ncarrying out the promises that had been made at various times, and as\r\nsubsequent history showed, it was the misguided opposition of France and\r\nRussia which was as much responsible as anything else for the permanent\r\nBritish occupation of Egypt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Iddesleigh._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Oct. 22, 1886.\r\n\r\n     In my previous letter of to-day I have told you what M. de\r\n     Freycinet said to me about the Suez Canal Convention. I had a long\r\n     interview with him, but though I gave him plenty of opportunities,\r\n     he did not say one other word about Egypt. This being the case,\r\n     I thought it prudent to abstain, at all events at this first\r\n     interview, from saying anything on my side. So far then I have not\r\n     made known to him any part of the contents of your letter to Lord\r\n     Salisbury of the 18th or of his telegraphic answer.\r\n\r\n     The fact is, that from what I have made out since I came back\r\n     here, I am led to think that the French Government have now good\r\n     reason to doubt whether they would get Bismarck's support if they\r\n     raised the Egyptian question with a view to embarrass us. This\r\n     being the case, they are very much hesitating to do so, and are\r\n     on the look-out for signs of our impressions on the subject, and\r\n     would interpret any appearance of unusual anxiety on our part, or\r\n     any fresh offers of concessions from us, simply as indications\r\n     that we still thought Germany might join against us. If the French\r\n     Government are not pretty sure of help and sympathy from abroad,\r\n     they will probably not stir in the matter.\r\n\r\n     In the meantime, however, the press has been strongly excited,\r\n     probably by d'Aunay and Charmes. There is a very nasty article,\r\n     principally about the financial part of the Egyptian question, in\r\n     the _Débuts_ this morning.\r\n\r\n     I shall perhaps be able to see my way more clearly in a day or\r\n     two. In the meantime I am disposed to think the most prudent plan\r\n     will be to be reserved and firm about Egypt, but not to display\r\n     anxiety on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe idea of Lord Salisbury, speaking generally, was that a somewhat\r\ndistant date of evacuation should be foreshadowed; that if evacuation,\r\nas was fully intended, should be carried out, some return should be\r\nexpected for the expenditure of British blood and treasure, and that\r\nthe Suez Canal difficulty should be settled without further delay. He\r\nconsidered that the negotiations should be carried on with the Porte\r\n(Sir Henry Drummond Wolff had already been despatched on this mission),\r\nand that confidential communications should be made to France and\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Iddesleigh._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Oct. 26, 1886.\r\n\r\n     I shall be very anxious to know what line Waddington took on\r\n     his return to his post, and particularly what, if anything, he said\r\n     about Egypt.\r\n\r\n     Freycinet is the man chiefly responsible for the refusal of\r\n     France to join in our expedition to Egypt, and this no doubt makes\r\n     him very anxious to gain for himself the credit of some striking\r\n     success in getting England out of that country. So far as I can\r\n     make out here, the attempts that have been made to get the Powers\r\n     to unite in calling for a general Conference upon Egyptian affairs\r\n     have not met with much success. If Bismarck decidedly opposes\r\n     attempts of this kind, they will no doubt be abandoned. The Press\r\n     continue to urge strong measures against our continuing in Egypt,\r\n     and is not measured in its language.\r\n\r\n     The autumn session is often fatal to French Ministers. I\r\n     recollect Gambetta's saying to me not long before his own fall:\r\n     '_En automne les feuilles tombent et les porte-feuilles aussi._'\r\n\r\nIt is more than likely that the instructions which M. Waddington\r\nreceived about this period were of a disagreeable nature. A well-known\r\nFrench Ambassador once remarked to me some years later, that the London\r\nEmbassy was no very desirable post from the French diplomatist's point\r\nof view. 'We are sent there with the mission of getting the English out\r\nof Egypt, and the thing cannot be done!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Iddesleigh._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Nov. 23, 1886.\r\n\r\n     Freycinet's aim seems to be to improve his own position in\r\n     the Chambers and in the country by obtaining our withdrawal from\r\n     Egypt, and of course the object cannot be attained unless he can\r\n     make it appear that the withdrawal is his doing. Hence his strong\r\n     desire that we should negotiate with him and his dislike to our\r\n     negotiating with Turkey or any other Power.\r\n\r\n     The crushing defeat of the Right in the elections in the\r\n     Department of the Nord is another proof of their blindness in\r\n     misusing the chance they had after the general election. They might\r\n     possibly have led gradually up to a restoration by giving strength\r\n     to Conservative principles and measures. They could only discredit\r\n     themselves by joining the extreme Radicals and attempting to\r\n     produce mischief and confusion.\r\n\r\n     The Germans are either very dilatory, or they have some\r\n     _arrière pensée_ about the Zanzibar affair. Yesterday afternoon\r\n     Münster was still without any instructions to make the joint\r\n     invitation to the French.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Iddesleigh._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Dec. 3, 1886.\r\n\r\n     You will see by my despatch that Freycinet has again attacked\r\n     me about Egypt. He wants the negotiation to go through him, and\r\n     if possible to be made with him, independently of the Turks, or\r\n     at least virtually in conjunction with us. I have not yet seen\r\n     any symptoms of his being anxious really to help us in Egyptian\r\n     matters; and I am not generally favourable to carrying on parallel\r\n     negotiations, or the same negotiation in different places. The\r\n     danger of informal conversations between Freycinet and me is that,\r\n     however cautious I may be, he may somehow or other find occasion\r\n     to quote me, as being more _coulant_ than you. At any rate, if I\r\n     had to talk to him it would be very necessary for you to tell me\r\n     very exactly how far I could go: and above all, that I should be\r\n     guarded from holding any language which might by any possibility be\r\n     embarrassing to the line circumstances might make it advisable for\r\n     Her Majesty's Government to take in Parliament afterwards.\r\n\r\n     I was long enough at Constantinople to see that no dependence\r\n     whatever was to be placed upon what the Porte told an Ambassador\r\n     about his colleagues. Still I cannot say that the Turkish\r\n     revelation about the communications the Porte affects to receive\r\n     from the French and Russian Ambassadors about Egypt and about us,\r\n     are, in the face of them, improbable. At any rate, our views must\r\n     be much nearer than those we now have to the French ideas, before\r\n     we shall get any real help from France at the Porte.\r\n\r\n     I write, as you know, in ignorance of Wolff's opinion, as he\r\n     did not stop here on his way home.\r\n\r\n     Freycinet's defeat in the Chamber this afternoon is serious\r\n     because it followed a strong speech from himself against the\r\n     _Sous-Préfet_ abolition, but he has wonderful skill in patching\r\n     things up.\r\n\r\nFreycinet in December was defeated by one of those combinations of\r\nRoyalist and Radicals which were not uncommon in French politics, and\r\nalthough the absurdity of the situation was obvious to every one,\r\ninsisted on placing his resignation and that of the Cabinet in President\r\nGrévy's hands. A change of Government was so useless that even those\r\nwho had combined to overthrow Freycinet endeavoured to persuade him\r\nto reconsider his determination. He remained obdurate, however, and\r\nthe President, casting about for a successor, pitched at first upon M.\r\nFloquet, a strong Radical who was particularly obnoxious to the Russian\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Iddesleigh._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Dec. 7, 1886.\r\n\r\n     The chances seem to be in favour of Floquet being Prime\r\n     Minister. He is of the section of the Chamber called 'Gauche\r\n     radical,' that is to say, he falls just short of the most extreme\r\n     Left. Who would be his Minister for Foreign Affairs and what would\r\n     be his foreign policy I do not pretend to say. The incident in\r\n     his life most talked about is his having cried out, '_Vive la\r\n     Pologne!_' and used some expressions taken as disrespectful to\r\n     the late Emperor of Russia, when His Majesty was at the Palais de\r\n     Justice, on his visit to Paris during the Exhibition of 1867. The\r\n     Russian Ambassadors have, I believe, declined or avoided exchanging\r\n     courtesies with him when he has since been in situations, such\r\n     as that of _Préfet de la Seine_, and President of the Chamber of\r\n     Deputies, which have brought him into communication with the rest\r\n     of the diplomatic body. Russia at this moment is paying so much\r\n     court to France that she might perhaps get over this.\r\n\r\n     The Left of the Chamber have hitherto been opposed to the\r\n     Tonquin and Madagascar Expeditions and to an adventurous and\r\n     Chauvin policy altogether; but if in power they would probably go\r\n     in for pleasing the Chamber and the bulk of the people out of doors\r\n     even more unreservedly than Freycinet did.\r\n\r\n     I should have regretted Freycinet's fall more, if he had\r\n     not taken up the Egyptian question in the way he did. Our\r\n     communications with him on that subject were becoming very\r\n     uncomfortable. I am not very sanguine, however, about their being\r\n     more satisfactory with his successor.\r\n\r\nThe notion, however, of having M. Floquet as Prime Minister frightened\r\nevery one except the extreme Radicals so much that that gentleman was\r\nunable to form an administration, and the choice of the President\r\nultimately fell upon a M. Goblet, who was Radical enough for most people\r\nand not much hampered by pledges and declarations. The office of Foreign\r\nMinister remained vacant, but, much to the relief of Lord Lyons, it was\r\ndefinitely refused by M. Duclerc. Lord Lyons had, by this time, had no\r\nless than twenty-one different French Foreign Ministers to deal with,\r\nand of these Duclerc was the one he liked least. No suitable person\r\nseemed to be available, and it was in vain that, one after the other\r\nFrench diplomatists were solicited to accept the office. At length a\r\nForeign Minister was found in M. Flourens, a brother of the well-known\r\nCommunist who was killed in 1871. M. Flourens was completely ignorant of\r\neverything concerning foreign affairs, and his appointment was perhaps\r\nan unconscious tribute to the English practice of putting civilians at\r\nthe head of our naval and military administrations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Iddesleigh._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Dec. 21, 1886.\r\n\r\n     I have not yet had the means of improving my acquaintance\r\n     with Flourens, but I expect to have some conversation with him\r\n     to-morrow. He had not a word to say about Bulgaria when I saw him\r\n     on Friday. He did not seem to have known anything about foreign\r\n     affairs before he took office, nor to expect to stay long enough in\r\n     office to become acquainted with them. Some people suppose that he\r\n     is to make way for the return of Freycinet as soon as the Budget is\r\n     passed. Anyway, the Goblet Ministry is only the Freycinet Ministry\r\n     over again without the strongest man, who was undoubtedly Freycinet\r\n     himself. When Parliament meets, things will be just as they were.\r\n     There will still be in the Chamber 180 Deputies on the Right,\r\n     ready to vote any way in order to make mischief and discredit the\r\n     Republic; about 100 Deputies on the extreme Left, intimidating the\r\n     Government and forcing it into extreme Radical measures, they being\r\n     able to count in all emergencies upon getting the vote of the Right\r\n     to turn out a Ministry; and lastly there will be 300 remaining\r\n     deputies, who cannot agree enough amongst themselves to form a\r\n     majority that can be relied upon, who do not at all like violent\r\n     radical measures, but who are too nervously afraid of unpopularity\r\n     to show resolution in opposing the extreme Left.\r\n\r\n     So far the Comte de Paris's declaration seems simply to have\r\n     made the ultra-Monarchists furiously angry, and not to have induced\r\n     any great part of the Right to think of taking the wise course it\r\n     recommends.\r\n\r\n     I do not see any outward signs here of the strained relations\r\n     between France and Germany and the imminent war between the two\r\n     countries which the _Standard_ announces. But it is true that among\r\n     the French themselves some suspicion and distrust of Boulanger's\r\n     aims are becoming more apparent.\r\n\r\nThe hackneyed saying: _Plus cela change, plus c'est la même chose_, was\r\nnever more appropriate than in the case of the change from a Freycinet\r\nto a Goblet Government; one section of uninspiring ministers had merely\r\ngiven place to another, and no one in France seemed in any way the\r\nbetter for it.\r\n\r\nOn New Year's Dav, 1887, President Grévy broke out into Latin in\r\ncongratulating the Diplomatic Corps on the already long continuance\r\nof peace, but a more accurate view of the situation was expressed by\r\na French newspaper in the sentence: 'Jamais année nouvelle ne s'est\r\nouverte au milieu d'autant de promesses de paix et de préparatifs de\r\nguerre que l'année 1887.' 'I do not know,' wrote Lord Lyons, 'which is\r\nthe nation which wishes for war. France certainly does not, she is, on\r\nthe contrary, very much afraid of it. But one would feel more confidence\r\nin peace if there appeared less necessity in all countries to be\r\nperpetually giving pacific assurances. There are rumours of a defensive\r\nalliance between Russia and France. The bond of union between the two\r\ncountries, if it exists, must be simply a common hatred of Germany.'\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year 1887, the Germans professed to be in\r\ndread of an attack from France, while the French complained that they\r\nwere threatened by Germany. In France it was believed that in August,\r\n1886, preparations had been actually made to mobilize the German army,\r\nand the language held by Boulanger was to the effect that the military\r\npower of France would be found to be very different to what it was in\r\n1870. Meanwhile an unsuccessful attempt had been made by those two old\r\nParliamentary hands, Freycinet and Ferry, to get rid of Boulanger, who\r\nwas now becoming to be considered as equally dangerous both in France\r\nand Germany.\r\n\r\nIt was probably the apprehension caused by the presence of this\r\nadventurer, whose incapacity was as yet imperfectly realized, that was\r\nresponsible for the state of tension and alarm which prevailed in France\r\nduring January and February, 1887.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._[44]\r\n\r\n    Paris, Jan. 18, 1887.\r\n\r\n     I saw M. Grévy this morning, and found him, as it seemed to\r\n     me, really alarmed at the possibility of France being attacked\r\n     by Germany. The only overt act he spoke of, on the part of\r\n     Germany, was the increase of the strength of the German garrisons\r\n     in the neighbourhood of the French frontier. Grévy himself is\r\n     most peaceful, and quite sincerely so. His natural character and\r\n     temperament, and his interest too, tend that way. He would hardly\r\n     be able to hold his own as President in case of war, and there is\r\n     very little chance of France going to war as long as he is the head\r\n     of the State. Flourens also spoke to me of danger to France and\r\n     Germany when I saw him this afternoon.\r\n\r\n     I think the alarm of Grévy and Flourens was sincere, though I\r\n     do not share it myself at this moment.\r\n\r\n     In France there is no desire to go to war, and I doubt whether\r\n     she is able, or at all events fancies herself able, to cope with\r\n     Germany.\r\n\r\n     It is perhaps more difficult to keep her on good terms\r\n     with us. Egypt is a sore which will not heal. There was a nasty\r\n     discussion about Newfoundland Fisheries in the Senate yesterday. I\r\n     send you a full report officially. Happily, so far, it has not had\r\n     much echo in the public.\r\n\r\nAlarm with respect to Germany continued to grow, and was fed by private\r\ncommunications from Bismarck, who sent by unofficial agents messages\r\nto the effect that 'he was all for peace, but that it was impossible\r\nfor him to stand the way that France was going on.' These messages came\r\nthrough Bleichröder and members of the _haute finance_ in Paris, who\r\nexpressed the opinion that if Boulanger remained in office, war with\r\nGermany was certain. The _haute finance_ is by no means invariably\r\ncorrect in its political judgment, but it seems highly probable that the\r\nwar scares prevalent in 1887 were promulgated with the object of getting\r\nrid of the troublesome firebrand upon whom so much public attention was\r\nconcentrated. The position of Boulanger, however, was a strong one, and\r\nto dislodge him was a work of no slight difficulty. Ever since the day\r\nwhen he had been taken into Freycinet's Cabinet he had contrived by\r\nadroit advertising to keep himself before the public, and to distinguish\r\nhimself from his colleagues as exercising a separate and commanding\r\ninfluence in the Chambers and with the public. In the army he had\r\nmanaged to make himself feared by the higher officers and assiduously\r\ncourted popularity with the rank and file. In the political world he\r\nhad at first been regarded as being ultra democratic, but now excited\r\nsuspicion by paying court to the Conservatives, and by endeavouring, not\r\nentirely without success, to obtain their good will.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, there was a very general impression that he was ambitious,\r\nself-seeking, and thoroughly unscrupulous; but there were few means of\r\nforming an opinion as to what his special plans really were, if indeed\r\nhe had formed any. Still he successfully flattered the belief of the\r\nFrench that they were fast emerging from the eclipse in which their\r\nmilitary power and reputation were involved in 1870, and there were\r\nnot wanting those who asserted that he was inclined to seek a war, in\r\nthe hope of conducting it with success, and so establishing himself as\r\na military dictator. Others, influenced by their wishes, indulged in\r\nthe hope that he might be meditating a Monarchist restoration under an\r\nOrleanist or Bonapartist Dynasty. Unsubstantial and improbable as these\r\nsuppositions may have been, it was plain that in the army and among the\r\npublic at large there prevailed a vague notion that he might be the man\r\nof the future, a notion fostered by the absence of any one recognized in\r\nFrance as possessing conspicuous and commanding abilities, and by the\r\ncraving for a real personality after a long succession of second-class\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nThe embarrassment with regard to Germany created by the presence of\r\nso disturbing an element in the Government as Boulanger did not,\r\ncontrary to what might have been expected, tend to improve Anglo-French\r\nrelations, and a letter from Lord Salisbury expresses in forcible\r\nterms his dissatisfaction at difficulties which seemed to have been\r\ngratuitously created.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Feb. 5, 1887.\r\n\r\n     The French are inexplicable. One would have thought that under\r\n     existing circumstances it was not necessary to _make_ enemies--that\r\n     there were enough provided for France by nature just now. But\r\n     she seems bent upon aggravating the patient beast of burden that\r\n     lives here by every insult and worry her ingenuity can devise. In\r\n     Newfoundland she has issued orders which, if faithfully executed,\r\n     must bring the French and English fleets into collision. At the\r\n     New Hebrides, in spite of repeated promises, she will not stir. In\r\n     Egypt she baulks a philanthropic change out of pure 'cussedness.'\r\n     In Morocco she is engaged in appropriating the territory by\r\n     instalments, threatening to reach Tangier at no distant date. And\r\n     now, just as we are entering on pacific negotiations, the French\r\n     Government sent orders to do precisely that which, a month ago,\r\n     Waddington promised they should not do, namely run up the French\r\n     flag at Dongorita.[45] It is very difficult to prevent oneself\r\n     from wishing for another Franco-German war to put a stop to this\r\n     incessant vexation.\r\n\r\n     We have protested earnestly about Dongorita, which has more\r\n     the air of a studied insult than any of the others. As to the\r\n     Newfoundland Fisheries, if they execute their threats, they render\r\n     the passage of a Bait Bill next year a matter of certainty. We\r\n     have strained the good will of the colonists very far in refusing\r\n     to allow it this year. The other matters will, I suppose, be the\r\n     subject of slow negotiations.\r\n\r\n     D'Herbette has made at Berlin more practical suggestions as to\r\n     naming a date for the annexation of Egypt than we have yet had from\r\n     the French Government. I hope the large majorities will persuade\r\n     the French that the national feeling is in this instance not in\r\n     favour of scuttle.\r\n\r\nAll that Lord Lyons, who was always most anxious to make the best case\r\nhe could for the French, was able to say in their defence, was that he\r\nhoped that it was an exceptionally dark moment, and that there must be a\r\nchange shortly for the better.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Feb. 18, 1887.\r\n\r\n     The French seem to be more confident of peace and altogether\r\n     in better spirits than they were a few days ago, but I do not know\r\n     that they have any positive facts or distinct information to go\r\n     upon. The hopes of a certain number of them rest upon the belief\r\n     that the Goblet Ministry is likely to be upset as soon as the\r\n     Budget is finally disposed of, and that thus Boulanger will be got\r\n     rid of.\r\n\r\n     The newspaper accounts of Wolff's mission to Constantinople\r\n     have brought Egypt on the tapis again, and as anxiety about\r\n     Germany falls into the background, irritation against England\r\n     comes prominently forward. There are, however, some symptoms of\r\n     a return among wiser men to more prudent and reasonable views\r\n     respecting the relations of France towards England. These men are\r\n     alarmed especially respecting the hostility towards France which is\r\n     apparent in Italy, and they see the folly of making enemies on all\r\n     sides. If there should be a new Ministry it might possibly pursue\r\n     a policy more friendly towards England with regard to Egypt and\r\n     other matters. The Egyptian question would no doubt become less\r\n     difficult if a change should remove M. Charmes from the Foreign\r\n     Office and put into his place, as Political Director there, a man\r\n     less prejudiced about Egypt.\r\n\r\n     In the meantime much amusement has been caused by an escapade\r\n     of Madame Flourens. On Saturday last she called upon Countess Marie\r\n     Münster, and found with her Count Hoyos, the Austrian Ambassador.\r\n     Madame Flourens announced loudly that her husband had resigned\r\n     the Foreign Office, because Boulanger had attempted, without his\r\n     knowledge, to send a letter direct to the Emperor of Russia by the\r\n     French Military Attaché, who was to start for St. Petersburg.\r\n     Hoyos fetched Münster himself out of an adjoining room, to hear the\r\n     story. Madame Flourens, it appeared, supposed that Flourens was on\r\n     the point of announcing his resignation to the Chamber of Deputies.\r\n     It turned out, however, that Flourens had made a scene with\r\n     Boulanger at the Council of Ministers, had gone away in a huff,\r\n     but had been subsequently calmed by M. Grévy and M. Goblet; no\r\n     letter to the Emperor had been sent, and the resignation had been\r\n     withdrawn. The story had of course spread all over the town. In\r\n     defiance of truth, a _communiqué_ contradicting it was inserted in\r\n     the _Agence Havas_, with no other effect than that of discrediting\r\n     the _communiqués_ which the Government is apt to put into the Havas.\r\n\r\nThere is so little mention of women in Lord Lyons's correspondence that\r\nMadame Flourens's indiscretion comes as a welcome relief, although in\r\nall probability it got the unfortunate Count Münster into trouble with\r\nBismarck, and afforded an excuse for fresh bullying. Count Münster,\r\nwho had been for many years Ambassador in London, where he had been\r\nextremely popular, found the transfer to Paris singularly unpleasant,\r\nmore especially as in order to make things thoroughly uncomfortable for\r\nhim, Bismarck had provided an entirely new Embassy Staff.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Feb. 19, 1887.\r\n\r\n     * * * * *\r\n\r\n     We are thinking of renewing our negotiations with respect to\r\n     the Suez Canal in a serious spirit. But before we sign anything we\r\n     shall want some satisfaction about Dongorita and the New Hebrides,\r\n     and possibly about the Corvée.\r\n\r\n     I think it was very shabby of the French to open the Dongorita\r\n     affair upon us, just after we had made so material a concession\r\n     upon the subject of the bait in Newfoundland.\r\n\r\n     Waddington is gloomy and rather ill-tempered--either from the\r\n     fogs or the crisis. I have not had any further talk with him about\r\n     Egypt lately. I think he avoids the subject. Wolff tells me that\r\n     the French Chargé d'Affaires at Constantinople is a mere creature\r\n     of Nelidoff's. Our negotiations are dragging on with little\r\n     prospect of success. We are willing to fix a distant date for our\r\n     leaving, if we receive a treaty power to go back whenever internal\r\n     or external security are threatened. The tone in which both France\r\n     and Turkey have received this proposal may be best expressed by the\r\n     colloquial phrase 'Damn their impudence!' I do not expect to carry\r\n     what I want at present, but before modifying these terms, I should\r\n     like to know what is going to happen in Europe.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Drummond Wolff was at this time at Constantinople endeavouring\r\nto negotiate the Convention with regard to the evacuation of Egypt,\r\nand the French and Russian Embassies were actively engaged in the\r\nsenseless opposition which eventually prevented the ratification of the\r\nConvention. The above letter from Lord Salisbury is an additional proof\r\nof the honest desire of the British Government to carry out the rash\r\nundertakings which had been given in the past.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Feb. 25, 1887.\r\n\r\n     The general feeling here seems to be that war has been\r\n     escaped, but still there is a good deal of discontent against the\r\n     foreign policy of the Goblet Cabinet. It seems to be considered\r\n     that the understanding between Italy, Austria, and Germany is as\r\n     good as made, and that the result of it will be to put an end to\r\n     any fear of war between Russia and Austria. On the other hand, it\r\n     is thought that Russia will feel it too necessary to watch Germany\r\n     for it to be prudent of her to make an alliance with France, while\r\n     without the alliance of Russia, France of course cannot face\r\n     Germany, particularly as she has almost hostility to expect from\r\n     Italy and no great sympathy to look for from England. The policy\r\n     which has thus isolated France from the other Powers is seen to\r\n     have been a mistake, and there seems to be a disposition to throw\r\n     the blame on the Goblet Ministry. If the Goblet Ministry should\r\n     fall, it is not improbable that the new Government might take\r\n     the line of being conciliatory to the neighbouring countries and\r\n     to Italy and England in particular. I am not very sanguine about\r\n     this, but if in the meantime no irritating questions come to excite\r\n     public opinion against us, there may possibly be a chance that\r\n     a change of Ministry here would make our relations with France\r\n     smoother.\r\n\r\n     My hopes that a change towards England may be in contemplation\r\n     have perhaps been strengthened by a visit which I have just had\r\n     from a person wholly unconnected with the French Ministry who\r\n     evidently came to ascertain what were the particular points with\r\n     regard to which the relations between France and England might be\r\n     improved. I said that instead of thwarting us in our endeavours\r\n     to improve the condition of Egypt and put it in a state to stand\r\n     alone, the French might help us; and they could not expect\r\n     comfortable relations with us if they endeavoured to stir up other\r\n     Powers to make difficulties with us about Egypt. I mentioned also\r\n     the New Hebrides question, which most certainly ought and might\r\n     be settled at once. I alluded also to those various matters all\r\n     over the world which might be treated in a cordial and not in an\r\n     antagonistic spirit.\r\n\r\n     P.S.--I have strong reasons for thinking it very important\r\n     that Waddington should not have the least inkling of my having had\r\n     the above interview, or any communication of the kind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Feb. 26, 1887.\r\n\r\n     I will not mention to Waddington the interview which you have\r\n     had as to English grounds of complaint. I have not seen him for ten\r\n     days: he must have taken huff at something.\r\n\r\n     I think, as the French are coming to their senses, it might be\r\n     well to mention unofficially to Flourens that I am quite ready to\r\n     resume the negotiations about the Suez Canal; and that I have good\r\n     hope of bringing it to a successful issue, but that I am hindered\r\n     by the flag that is floating at Dongorita, and by the delay of the\r\n     French in performing their promises as regards the New Hebrides. We\r\n     are being a good deal reproached here, on account of our apparent\r\n     submission to this breach of faith. If these two matters are\r\n     corrected, I shall find it possible, and shall be very glad to\r\n     renew the Suez Canal discussion either at Paris or here.\r\n\r\n     I have seen Karolyi to-day--an unusual occurrence--and for the\r\n     first time have had the admission from him that a war with Russia\r\n     was not an impossible contingency.\r\n\r\n     The Russians are very quiet; and the negotiations about\r\n     Bulgaria do not really advance a bit.\r\n\r\nM. Flourens, in spite of his complete inexperience, seems to have\r\nrealized the simple fact that it was not advisable to quarrel with\r\nEngland just at the moment when relations with Germany were in a\r\ncritical condition; but unhappily the public did not appear to be in\r\nan accommodating mood. The statements published in the English press\r\nrespecting the Drummond Wolff mission had caused great irritation,\r\nand what was perhaps more serious, had alarmed the French again\r\nabout the security of the coupons. As long as they felt sure that\r\nthe coupons would be paid regularly, and that there was no fear of\r\nfuture reduction, they were reasonably patient, unless some specially\r\nsevere blow, such as a reduction of the numbers and salaries of French\r\nofficials, as compared with English, was struck at their _amour propre_.\r\nNow, however, they were beset with the fear that, under what they\r\nconsidered to be English mismanagement, they were about to lose their\r\nmoney as well as their influence.\r\n\r\nIn March the Goblet Ministry was already in difficulties, and it was\r\nbelieved that Freycinet was likely to return to power, although what the\r\nprecise advantages were of these continual changes, no one was capable\r\nof explaining.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    March 8, 1887.\r\n\r\n     By taking credit to himself at the expense of his\r\n     predecessors, in the interpellation yesterday, Goblet has stirred\r\n     up the bile of a large party in the Chamber, and the determination\r\n     to turn his Cabinet out, if possible, has revived with fresh\r\n     vigour. It is supposed that the attempts will be made as soon as\r\n     the Corn Duties Bill is disposed of. It seems to be thought that,\r\n     if it succeeds, Freycinet must be Prime Minister; but there appears\r\n     to be a strong feeling against his having the Foreign Office again.\r\n     He is thought to have got France into uncomfortable relations with\r\n     many of his neighbours. In the treatment of the Egyptian question\r\n     he is believed to have sacrificed cordiality with England to a\r\n     desire to regain the popularity he had lost by the policy which\r\n     led to England's occupying her present position in Egypt; while\r\n     his attempt to get up an opposition to England on the part of the\r\n     European Powers and his worrying way of dealing himself with the\r\n     British Government about Egypt, are thought simply to have excited\r\n     public opinion on both sides of the Channel and to have provoked\r\n     ill will, without in the least improving the position of France.\r\n     There can be no doubt that Freycinet looked upon a success with\r\n     regard to Egypt as a personal necessity for himself, and was much\r\n     influenced in his policy towards England by this feeling.\r\n\r\n     It is apprehended that unless the _prestige_ of Boulanger is\r\n     put on high again by strong language from Germany, there will be no\r\n     difficulty in obtaining, as a matter of course, his fall, with the\r\n     rest of the Cabinet of which he is a part. M. Grévy is believed to\r\n     be very anxious to be rid of him.\r\n\r\n     I hear on good authority that the Russians have been trying\r\n     again, though without success, to come to a special understanding\r\n     with the French Government.\r\n\r\nTo say that M. Grévy was very anxious to be rid of Boulanger was\r\nprobably an understatement, for he could not conceivably have desired\r\nanything so ardently. But the 'Music Hall St. Arnaud' was by no means\r\nat the end of his tether, and had contrived to advertise himself by\r\negregious conduct with regard to the Army Committee of the Chamber\r\nof Deputies. That Committee had drawn up a military Bill, based upon\r\nthree years' service, and Boulanger, on the pretext that it was 'not\r\nsufficiently faithful to democratic principles,' had, without consulting\r\nany of his colleagues, written a letter condemning the provisions of\r\nthe bill and proposing something quite different. This letter was\r\nthoughtfully communicated to the press before it reached the Committee,\r\nand the outraged members of the Committee as well as his colleagues\r\nwere at last goaded into resistance. The Chamber condemned the attitude\r\nof the General towards the sacrosanct representatives of the nation;\r\nthe General himself beat a hasty and prudent retreat under cover of an\r\napology; the Moderate Republicans denounced him as a would-be dictator,\r\nand the Ultra-Radicals accused him of cowardice in consequence of his\r\napology. Most men under the circumstances would have felt disposed to\r\nresign office, but in the case of Boulanger it was probably immaterial\r\nto him whether he was blamed or praised, so long as he could keep his\r\nname before the public.\r\n\r\nIt was, and probably is still, a regulation in the British Diplomatic\r\nService, that its members should retire at the age of seventy, and, as\r\na rule, an Ambassador who had attained that age, usually considered\r\nhimself fit to discharge his duties for a further period. Lord Lyons,\r\nhowever, was an exception. His seventieth birthday fell due in April,\r\nand a month beforehand he wrote to announce that he wished to resign.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 22, 1887.\r\n\r\n     Towards the end of the next month, the time will come when\r\n     I shall be superannuated, and I feel very strongly that it will\r\n     not come too soon. It will not be without a pang that I shall\r\n     find myself no longer a diplomatic servant of the Queen, who has\r\n     ever received my endeavours to obtain her approval with the most\r\n     generous indulgence. But the labour and responsibility of this post\r\n     are becoming too much for me, and I shall be anxious to be relieved\r\n     from them when the time fixed by the regulations arrives.\r\n\r\n     I need not assure you that I shall much regret the termination\r\n     of the official connexion with you from which I have derived so\r\n     much satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIt may not unfairly be presumed that resignations of important official\r\nposts are habitually welcomed by Governments, as they not only remedy\r\nstagnation in the public service, but frequently provide opportunities\r\nfor political patronage. It is plain, however, that the prospect of\r\nlosing Lord Lyons was looked upon by Lord Salisbury as a genuine\r\nmisfortune, and he did his best to induce him to reconsider his decision.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    March 26, 1887.\r\n\r\n     I have considered your letter of the 22nd, stating that you\r\n     felt very strongly that the time of your superannuation would not\r\n     come too soon; and though it was a matter of very deep regret to me\r\n     to receive such an announcement from you, it was not altogether a\r\n     matter of surprise; for I remembered the language you had used to\r\n     me when I tried to induce you to join us as Foreign Secretary last\r\n     July.\r\n\r\n     The loss which the Diplomatic Service will suffer by your\r\n     retirement will be profound, and, for the time, hardly possible to\r\n     repair. Your presence at Paris gave to the public mind a sense of\r\n     security which was the result of a long experience of your powers,\r\n     and which no one else is in a position to inspire.\r\n\r\n     In face of the expressions in your letter I feel as if I were\r\n     almost presuming in suggesting any alternative course of action.\r\n     But it struck me that possibly you might be willing to make your\r\n     official career terminate with the end of your current appointment,\r\n     rather than with the precise date of superannuation. The effect of\r\n     this would be to prolong your stay at Paris till next December.\r\n\r\n     My reasons from a public point of view will, I hope, strike\r\n     you at once. We are passing through a very anxious European crisis.\r\n     If any fateful decisions are taken this year, it will be within the\r\n     next three or four months. It will add very much to our anxiety to\r\n     know that the reins at Paris are in new hands, which have never\r\n     held them before. This mere fact may even be an element of danger.\r\n     The avalanche hangs so loosely, that any additional sensation or\r\n     uneasiness may displace it. If we could avoid a change till the\r\n     winter it would be a great public advantage, even if the change\r\n     should be inevitable.\r\n\r\n     I hope you will forgive me for having pressed this on you in\r\n     the interests of the public service. Whatever your decision may be,\r\n     I give you the warmest thanks for the kind and loyal support which\r\n     you have always given to the policy which it has been my duty to\r\n     carry out.\r\n\r\nAn appeal of this kind from an official chief could not well be\r\ndisregarded, setting aside the fact that but few officials can have\r\nexperienced the compliment of being assured that their continued service\r\nwas essential to the peace of Europe. With well justified misgivings,\r\nLord Lyons therefore consented to remain on until the end of the year,\r\nknowing perfectly well that his physical energies were on the point of\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 29, 1887.\r\n\r\n     I am deeply touched by your letter of the 26th, and I feel\r\n     that, after what you say in it, I should be extremely ungrateful if\r\n     I were not ready to sacrifice a great deal to meet your views.\r\n\r\n     For my own part I feel that the work and responsibility here\r\n     are an increasing strain both upon my mind and upon my bodily\r\n     health, and I am beset with misgivings lest, even in ordinary\r\n     times, I may be unable to discharge my duties with energy and\r\n     efficiency, and lest, in an emergency calling for much labour,\r\n     I may break down altogether. This being the case, it would\r\n     undoubtedly be a great relief and comfort to me to retire on\r\n     becoming superannuated towards the end of next month.\r\n\r\n     Begging you to take the misgivings into full consideration,\r\n     and to be sure that they have not been conceived without good\r\n     reason, and that they are strongly and very seriously felt by\r\n     me, I place myself in your hands. If after giving full weight to\r\n     them, you still think that it would be a satisfaction to you that\r\n     I should continue to hold this post till the winter, and that it\r\n     would be a great public advantage to avoid a change till that time,\r\n     I am ready to stay on, and trusting to your indulgence to do my\r\n     best.\r\n\r\n     I should, of course, look upon it as quite settled that in any\r\n     case I should retire at latest when my current appointment comes to\r\n     an end at the close of the present year.\r\n\r\n     If you wish me to hold on, I must ask you what, if any,\r\n     announcement respecting my retirement should be made. Up to this\r\n     time I have simply stated to people who have questioned me,\r\n     that nothing was definitely settled. I did not mention to any\r\n     one my intention to write my letter of the 22nd expressing to\r\n     you my wish to retire, nor have I made any one acquainted with\r\n     my having written it, except of course Sheffield, who, as my\r\n     private secretary, made a copy of it for me to keep. The question,\r\n     therefore, as to announcing my retirement remains intact.\r\n\r\n     I cannot conclude without once more saying how much I am\r\n     gratified by the appreciation of my services expressed in your\r\n     letter, and how truly I feel the kindness shown by it.\r\n\r\nThe offer was accepted by Lord Salisbury in singularly flattering terms,\r\nQueen Victoria also expressing much satisfaction at the consent of the\r\nAmbassador to remain at his post. From Lord Salisbury's language, it\r\nmight be inferred that he was in some doubt as to whether his own tenure\r\nof office was likely to be prolonged.\r\n\r\n     I have had no hesitation in availing myself of your kind\r\n     consent--though you seemed to doubt whether on reflection I should\r\n     do so. Of course I fully understand that you do not feel equal to\r\n     the amount of exertion which you would take in a more favourable\r\n     condition of health. But this circumstance will not detract\r\n     from the great value of your counsel and judgment, nor from the\r\n     authority which by so many years of experience you have acquired.\r\n\r\n     I quite understand that towards the close of the session of\r\n     Parliament you will require the holiday you have been accustomed\r\n     to take in recent years. I hope also to get to a bath at that\r\n     time--whether I am in office or not.\r\n\r\nWhy Lord Salisbury should have spoken so doubtfully is not clear, unless\r\ninstinct warned him of Miss Cass, who was the first to strike a blow\r\nat the Unionist administration. At the end of March there reappeared\r\nthe mysterious emissary who has been already mentioned. There are no\r\nmeans of actually establishing his identity, but there can be little\r\ndoubt that it was M. de Chaudordy, who represented the French Foreign\r\nOffice at Tours and Bordeaux during the war. M. de Chaudordy had made\r\nfriends with Lord Salisbury at the time of the Constantinople Conference\r\nin 1876, and he was, therefore, a suitable person to utilize for the\r\npurpose of making advances towards a better understanding between the\r\ntwo Governments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 29, 1887.\r\n\r\n     In a private letter which I wrote to you on the 25th of last\r\n     month, I mentioned that I had received a visit from a person wholly\r\n     unconnected officially with the French Government, who appeared to\r\n     have come to ascertain what were the particular points with regard\r\n     to which the relations between the English and French Governments\r\n     might be improved. The same person has been to me again to-day,\r\n     and has only just left me. This time he did not conceal that it\r\n     was after being in communication with Flourens that he came. He\r\n     enlarged on the embarrassing and indeed dangerous position in which\r\n     France was placed by the adherence of Italy to the Austro-German\r\n     Alliance, and said that M. Flourens was ready to make almost any\r\n     sacrifice to secure the good will of England. I said that there\r\n     could be no great difficulty in this, if only France would abstain\r\n     from irritating opposition to us, and would settle promptly and\r\n     satisfactorily outstanding questions. My visitor answered that\r\n     Flourens conceived that he had sent conciliatory instructions\r\n     to Waddington which would settle these questions, and that both\r\n     Waddington and Florian[46] (who had come on leave) reported that\r\n     there was decidedly a _détente_ in the strain which had existed in\r\n     the Anglo-French relations. I said that I was delighted to hear it,\r\n     and that it showed how ready you were to welcome all conciliatory\r\n     overtures. My friend seemed on this occasion, as on the last, to\r\n     wish me to tell him some special thing which Flourens might do\r\n     to please you. I said that I should at any rate mention a thing\r\n     which he might do to avoid displeasing you. He might prevent the\r\n     French setting up an opposition to financial proposals in Egypt in\r\n     cases in which all the other Powers were ready to agree. My friend\r\n     spoke of Flourens's readiness to give to Russia on the Bulgarian\r\n     question advice which you might suggest, and he mentioned various\r\n     things which he thought M. Flourens might be ready to do to please\r\n     England. These things appeared to me to be rather too grand and\r\n     too vague in character to be very practical. I said, however, that\r\n     I would always bear in mind what he had told me of M. Flourens's\r\n     good dispositions, and would speak frankly and unreservedly to the\r\n     Minister whenever I could make a suggestion as to the means of\r\n     acting upon those dispositions in a manner to be satisfactory to\r\n     England.\r\n\r\n     The conclusions I drew from the conversation of Flourens's\r\n     friend were that the French are horribly afraid of our being led\r\n     to join the Italo-Austro-German Alliance, and that they have been\r\n     urged by Russia to exert themselves to prevent this. I do not\r\n     conceive that the French expect to induce us to join them against\r\n     the Germans and the German Alliance. What they want is to feel sure\r\n     that we shall not join the others against France and Russia.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat curious that M. Flourens, who was evidently desirous\r\nof establishing better relations with England, should have selected\r\nan unofficial person for communication, rather than approach the\r\nAmbassador himself; but perhaps, being quite ignorant of diplomatic\r\nusage, he considered it necessary to shroud his action in mystery.\r\nThe Triple Alliance dated in reality from 1882, Italy having joined\r\nthe Austro-German Alliance in that year; but a new Treaty had been\r\nsigned in the month of February, 1887, and caused the French to feel a\r\nwell-justified alarm. In fact, their position was anything but a happy\r\none, for it was generally believed that the Emperor Alexander III. had\r\nresolved, since the abortive attempt on his life, that he would never\r\nally himself with Revolutionists, and that he considered the French to\r\nbe arch-Revolutionists. Perhaps this belief may have accounted in some\r\nmeasure for Flourens's amiable professions towards England.\r\n\r\nIn the month of April there occurred one of those incidents which\r\nare the despair of peaceably minded politicians and the delight of\r\nsensational journalism and of adventurers of the Boulanger type. A\r\ncertain M. Schnaebelé, a French Commissaire de Police, was induced to\r\ncross the German frontier, and thereupon was arrested and imprisoned.\r\nThe act had the appearance of provocation and naturally caused a\r\nprodigious uproar in France; Flourens endeavouring to settle the\r\nmatter diplomatically and Boulanger seizing the opportunity to display\r\npatriotic truculence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, April 26, 1887.\r\n\r\n     So far as one can judge at present the French are irritated\r\n     beyond measure by the arrest at Pagny, but generally they still\r\n     shrink from war. It will not, I conceive, be difficult for\r\n     Bismarck to keep at peace with them, if he really wishes to do so.\r\n     The danger is that they are persuaded that he is only looking out\r\n     for a pretext, and that however much they may now give way, he will\r\n     be bent upon humiliating them till they _must_ resent and resist.\r\n     I don't see that so far the German Government have treated the\r\n     Pagny affair as if they wished to make a quarrel of it. The German\r\n     _Chargé d'Affaires_ has taken many messages from Berlin to Flourens\r\n     in the sense that if Schnaebelé shall prove to have been arrested\r\n     on German soil, all satisfaction shall be given. But, then, in the\r\n     Press of the two countries a controversy is raging as to which side\r\n     of the frontier he was arrested on, and as to whether or no he was\r\n     inveigled over the frontier.\r\n\r\n     The French undoubtedly shrink from war, but they do not\r\n     shrink from it as much as they did ten years ago; and if the press\r\n     should get up a loud popular cry, there is no Government strength\r\n     to resist it. I conceive that at this moment the Government is\r\n     pacific, and that it does not believe the army to be yet ready.\r\n     But if, as is no doubt the case, the Germans also believe that the\r\n     French army is not as ready now as it will be two or three years\r\n     hence, they may be impatient to begin. In the mean time, so far\r\n     as I can make out, the Pagny affair is being treated by the two\r\n     Governments with each other, in correct form diplomatically, and\r\n     without any apparent willingness to embitter matters. I cannot say\r\n     as much for the press on either side, though there are symptoms of\r\n     prudence and caution in the moderate French papers.\r\n\r\nThe Schnaebelé incident was disposed of by his release from prison and\r\ntransfer to another post at Lyons; but the agitation did not subside\r\nreadily, and a bill brought in by Boulanger to mobilize an army corps\r\ncaused much disquietude at the German Embassy. It was now generally\r\nknown that Bismarck considered Boulanger a danger and desired his\r\nremoval from the War Office; but the very knowledge of this feeling and\r\nthe support accorded to him by the League of Patriots and other noisy\r\norganizations rendered this step all the more difficult.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 13, 1887.\r\n\r\n     I have not heard of any new incident between France and\r\n     Germany, but the suspicion and susceptibility with which the two\r\n     nations, and indeed the two Governments, regard each other, are\r\n     certainly not diminishing.\r\n\r\n     In France home politics are in so peculiar a state as to be\r\n     positively disquieting. The Budget Committee and the Ministry have\r\n     come to an open breach, and the Committee intend to propose to\r\n     the Chamber a resolution which apparently must, if carried, turn\r\n     out the Goblet Cabinet. This the Chamber would be willing enough\r\n     to do, if it could see its way to forming another Government. The\r\n     plan would be to form a Ministry with Freycinet as Prime Minister,\r\n     but not as Minister for Foreign Affairs, and without Boulanger.\r\n     But then they are afraid to try and upset Boulanger, while they\r\n     feel that to form a new Government and put Boulanger in it would\r\n     be, or might be, taken in Germany as a plain indication that they\r\n     are warlike at heart. It is an emergency in which the Chief of\r\n     the State should exert himself; but Grévy's caution has become\r\n     something very like lethargy. In the mean time they are letting\r\n     Boulanger grow up into a personage whose position may be a danger\r\n     to the Republic at home, even if it does not embroil the country\r\n     in a foreign war. The redeeming point in all this is that the\r\n     Government does seem to feel that it would not do to be upon bad\r\n     terms with England, and that it would be wise to be conciliatory\r\n     toward us.\r\n\r\nThe Goblet Ministry soon found itself in hopeless difficulty over\r\nthe Budget, and it was plain that another aimless change of men was\r\ninevitable. Goblet's Government had lasted for five months (inclusive\r\nof a prolonged recess), and the real question of interest was whether\r\nBoulanger was to be a member of the new Government or not. If he was\r\nincluded in it, it was apprehended that the suspicions of Germany would\r\nbe aggravated; and on the other hand, it was doubtful whether any\r\nGovernment could be formed without him. An ultra-patriotic demonstration\r\nin Paris against German music, in the shape of Wagner's operas, was\r\neloquent of the state of feeling between the two nations at the time,\r\nand the Government found that the only course open to them was to close\r\nthe theatre where the obnoxious productions were to have appeared.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 20, 1887.\r\n\r\n     Freycinet appears to have agreed with Grévy to try and form a\r\n     Cabinet and to be hard at work at the task. Of course the question\r\n     is whether Boulanger is or is not to be in the new Cabinet? It was\r\n     believed this morning that Grévy and Freycinet had decided upon\r\n     offering to keep him as Minister of War. As the day has gone on,\r\n     however, the belief has gained ground that Freycinet has not found\r\n     colleagues willing to run the risk of war which the maintenance\r\n     of Boulanger would produce, and that he is to propose to Grévy a\r\n     Cabinet from which Boulanger is to be excluded. He is, however,\r\n     to make it an essential condition with Grévy that he is to have\r\n     the power to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies in his hands, as\r\n     without this power he does not feel able to form a Cabinet without\r\n     Boulanger, or indeed any Cabinet at all. In the mean time the\r\n     Reds are getting up in all directions addresses and petitions in\r\n     favour of Boulanger, with a view to forcing Grévy's and Freycinet's\r\n     hands and working on their fears. If Boulanger is got rid of, the\r\n     immediate danger of war will probably be escaped for the moment.\r\n     Boulanger's own character, and the position in which he has placed\r\n     himself, make him threatening to peace; and the opinion held of him\r\n     in Germany and the irritation felt against him there make him still\r\n     more dangerous.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 24, 1887.\r\n\r\n     The last news is supposed to be that Floquet, the President\r\n     of the Chamber, has undertaken the task of forming a Ministry,\r\n     and that he will keep many of the outgoing Ministers, Boulanger\r\n     included. The goings and comings at the Elysée; the singular\r\n     selections of men to be Prime Ministers, or quasi Prime Ministers,\r\n     and the apparent want of firmness and inability to exercise any\r\n     influence on the part of the President of the Republic, have\r\n     certainly not increased the reputation of M. Grévy. Floquet will,\r\n     I suppose, be unacceptable to Russia, for the Russians have always\r\n     ostentatiously kept up the show of resentment against him for the\r\n     cry, offensive to the Emperor Alexander II., which he raised when\r\n     that monarch visited the Palais de Justice during the Exhibition\r\n     of 1867. Boulanger has lately declared that he does not want to\r\n     continue to be Minister, but that if he is Minister, he will,\r\n     whatever Germany may say, continue his mobilization scheme, and not\r\n     relax in his preparations to resist an attack from Germany, and to\r\n     avert the necessity of submitting to humiliation.\r\n\r\n     I think, in fact, that things look very bad for France both\r\n     at home and abroad. I can only hope that as the phases of the\r\n     Ministerial crisis change from hour to hour, you may receive by\r\n     telegraph some more satisfactory news before you get this letter.\r\n\r\nIn course of time a new Ministry was formed under M. Rouvier, and the\r\nimportant fact attaching to it was that Boulanger had been got rid of.\r\nOtherwise there was nothing much to distinguish the new Ministers from\r\nthe old, and they seemed disposed to angle for popularity in the country\r\nmuch in the same way as Freycinet and Goblet.\r\n\r\nThe object of removing Boulanger had been to reassure and placate\r\nGermany, but no sooner had this been done, than the Government appeared\r\nto feel alarmed at the danger of incurring unpopularity in the country,\r\nand hastily announced that the new Minister of War would continue to\r\nfollow in the footsteps of his predecessor.\r\n\r\nAgain, it had been understood that one of the objects of the new\r\nGovernment would be to put an end to the isolation of France by\r\nplacing itself on more cordial terms with the neighbouring nations\r\nand especially with England; but what it appeared anxious to profess,\r\nwas the intention of stoutly refusing to accept or even acquiesce\r\nin the Anglo-Turkish Convention respecting Egypt. All this, as Lord\r\nLyons observed, might proceed in great measure from ignorance and\r\ninexperience, and might be mitigated by the knowledge of affairs and\r\nsense of responsibility which accompany office, but still it was\r\ndisquieting: all the more disquieting, because the French Foreign\r\nMinister never failed to intimate that France would never be a party to\r\nan arrangement which would confer upon England an international right\r\nto re-occupy Egypt under certain circumstances after evacuation, whilst\r\nFrance was to be formally excluded from enjoying an equal right.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 12, 1887.\r\n\r\n     Baron Alphonse de Rothschild came to see me this afternoon,\r\n     and told me that the last accounts he had received from Berlin\r\n     caused him to feel more than usual alarm as to the feelings of\r\n     Prince Bismarck and of the Germans in general towards France. They\r\n     did not indeed imply that Germany was actually contemplating any\r\n     immediate declaration of war, but they did show that in Germany\r\n     war with France was regarded as a contingency that could not be\r\n     long postponed, and of which the postponement was not desirable\r\n     for German interests. The Germans did not seem to be prepared to\r\n     incur the opprobrium of Europe by attacking France without having\r\n     the appearance of a good reason for doing so, but they did seem to\r\n     be looking out impatiently for a plausible pretext for a rupture;\r\n     far from being sorry, they would be very glad if France would\r\n     furnish them with such a pretext. Prince Bismarck was evidently\r\n     not disposed to facilitate the task of M. Rouvier's Government,\r\n     notwithstanding the pledges it had given of its desire for peace\r\n     abroad, and the efforts it was making to promote moderation at home.\r\n\r\n     Baron de Rothschild had, he told me, seen M. Rouvier to-day\r\n     and made all this known to him. He had pointed out to him the\r\n     danger which arose from the sort of coalition against France of\r\n     the Powers of Europe, had dwelt on the importance of making almost\r\n     any sacrifice to break up this coalition, and had especially urged\r\n     the imprudence of allowing coldness, if not ill-will, to subsist\r\n     between France and England.\r\n\r\n     M. Rouvier had expressed an anxious desire to establish\r\n     cordial relations with England.\r\n\r\n     Baron de Rothschild had answered that the time had come\r\n     to show this by acts, and had strongly pressed M. Rouvier to\r\n     settle without any delay the outstanding questions which produced\r\n     irritation between the two countries. M. Rouvier had expressed his\r\n     intention to do so, and Baron de Rothschild had reason to believe\r\n     that this was also the desire and intention of M. Flourens.\r\n\r\n     I said that I heard this with great pleasure, and that\r\n     I had received with much satisfaction assurances to the same\r\n     effect respecting M. Flourens's sentiments, which had come to me\r\n     indirectly through various channels. I must, however, confess that\r\n     I had not found in M. Flourens himself any disposition to push\r\n     assurance to this effect beyond generalities. I had not seen any\r\n     strong practical instances of a desire on his part to give a speedy\r\n     and satisfactory solution to outstanding questions.\r\n\r\n     Baron de Rothschild observed that what he had said on this\r\n     point to M. Rouvier had appeared to make a considerable impression\r\n     on him.\r\n\r\n     I said that it so happened that I should in all probability\r\n     have the means of testing this almost immediately. I had in fact\r\n     only yesterday strongly urged M. Flourens to close a question, that\r\n     of the New Hebrides, which was creating suspicion and annoyance to\r\n     England and causing great inconvenience in consequence of the very\r\n     strong feeling about it which prevailed in the colonies. The two\r\n     Governments were entirely in accord in principle upon it, and in\r\n     fact it was only kept open by the pertinacity with which the French\r\n     Government delayed to take the formal step necessary for closing it.\r\n\r\n     Baron de Rothschild went on to tell me that in speaking of\r\n     the relations with England, M. Rouvier alluded to the convention\r\n     negotiated by Sir Drummond Wolff at Constantinople, and said that\r\n     he did not see why it should produce any lasting disagreement\r\n     between France and England. Whether it was ratified or not, France\r\n     might be as conciliatory as possible towards England in dealing\r\n     with the matter in future. In answer I suppose to a remark from\r\n     Baron de Rothschild, M. Rouvier would seem to have said that the\r\n     Comte de Montebello[47] appeared to have gone far beyond his\r\n     instructions in the language he had used to the Porte.\r\n\r\n     I asked Baron de Rothschild whether M. Rouvier had also\r\n     said that the Comte de Montebello had received any check or\r\n     discouragement from the Government at Paris.\r\n\r\n     Passing on from this, Baron de Rothschild told me that before\r\n     concluding the conversation, he had pointed out to M. Rouvier that\r\n     the great addition of strength which the Ministry had received\r\n     from the vote of the Chamber yesterday, would enable them to act\r\n     with more independence and vigour, and that they might now settle\r\n     questions with England, and establish good relations with her\r\n     without being under the constant fear of a check in the Chamber of\r\n     Deputies.\r\n\r\n     There can be no doubt that, in fact, the position of the\r\n     Rouvier Ministry has been immensely strengthened by the large vote\r\n     they obtained yesterday on the interpellation put forward against\r\n     them on the subject of Monarchical and Clerical intrigues. It is\r\n     earnestly to be hoped, for their own sakes, and for the sake of\r\n     France, that they will turn it to account in order to pursue a more\r\n     reasonable and conciliatory policy towards England, and to take\r\n     stronger and more effectual means of preserving order in Paris. The\r\n     riot at the Lyons railway station seems to have done Boulangism\r\n     harm even among the ultra-Radicals, and to have been the main cause\r\n     of Boulanger's having been thrown over by Radical speakers in the\r\n     Chamber yesterday. But it is a very dangerous thing to give the\r\n     Paris mob its head.\r\n\r\nM. Rouvier's friendly assurances with regard to England had, of course,\r\nbeen imparted to the Baron in order that they might be communicated\r\nto the British Embassy, but the action of the French Government\r\nappeared to have very little in common with them; nor was there any\r\nreason to assume that Montebello was exceeding his instructions in\r\nopposing at Constantinople the ratification of the Anglo-Turkish\r\nConvention with regard to Egypt. The egregious action which forced\r\nthe Sultan to withhold his consent to the Convention, and thereby\r\nperpetuated the British occupation of Egypt, was not the result of the\r\nunauthorized proceedings of the French Ambassador, but the consequence\r\nof the deliberately considered joint policy of the French and Russian\r\nGovernments. Incidentally, it may be pointed out that the fruitless\r\nattempt to negotiate the Convention was yet another convincing proof\r\nof the absolute honesty of British policy with regard to Egypt, and\r\nthe following letter from Lord Salisbury shows no satisfaction at the\r\nfrustration of Sir H. Drummond Wolff's mission.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Salisbury to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    July 20, 1887.\r\n\r\n     I am afraid the temper of the French will not make the\r\n     settlement of the Egyptian question more easy. I do not now see how\r\n     we are to devise any middle terms that will satisfy them. We cannot\r\n     leave the Khedive to take his chance of foreign attack, or native\r\n     riot. The French refuse to let us exercise the necessary powers\r\n     of defence unless we do it by continuing our military occupation.\r\n     I see nothing for it but to sit still and drift awhile: a little\r\n     further on in the history of Europe the conditions may be changed,\r\n     and we may be able to get some agreement arrived at which will\r\n     justify evacuation. Till then we must simply refuse to evacuate.\r\n     Our relations with France are not pleasant at present. There are\r\n     five or six different places where we are at odds:--\r\n\r\n     1. She has destroyed the Convention at Constantinople.\r\n\r\n     2. She will allow no Press Law to pass.\r\n\r\n     3. She is trying to back out of the arrangement on the Somali\r\n     coast.\r\n\r\n     4. She still occupies the New Hebrides.\r\n\r\n     5. She destroys our fishing tackle, etc.\r\n\r\n     6. She is trying to elbow us out of at least two\r\n     unpronounceable places on the West Coast of Africa.\r\n\r\n     Can you wonder that there is, to my eyes, a silver lining even\r\n     to the great black cloud of a Franco-German War?\r\n\r\nOn account of the tension existing between France and Germany, and\r\nof the agitation produced by the transfer of Boulanger to a command\r\nat Clermont-Ferrand, it was feared that the National Fête of July 14\r\nwould be marked by serious disturbances; these fears were happily not\r\nrealized, although Boulanger's departure from Paris a few days earlier\r\nhad formed the pretext for a display of embarrassing Jingoism. The\r\nFrench Government were so apprehensive of an anti-German demonstration,\r\nthat, although Count Münster received the usual invitation to attend\r\nthe Longchamps Review, M. Flourens privately begged him to absent\r\nhimself, and the two German military attachés, instead of joining the\r\nWar Minister's Staff in uniform, went to the Diplomatic Tribune in plain\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Salisbury._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 15, 1887.\r\n\r\n     The National Fête of yesterday passed off quietly enough.\r\n     There are said to have been cries in various places of 'Vive\r\n     Boulanger,' and 'À bas Grévy,' but nowhere was there anything which\r\n     assumed anything like the proportions of a demonstration. There do\r\n     not appear to have been any cries at all in the army.\r\n\r\n     The low French papers keep up a constant fire of scurrilous\r\n     language against the Germans and even against the Germany Embassy.\r\n     This sort of thing seems to be taken more seriously and to cause\r\n     more irritation in Germany than it would in most countries. Count\r\n     Münster naturally enough did not come to the President's stand, to\r\n     which he and the other Ambassadors were as usual invited to see\r\n     the Review. The German military attachés did not go in uniform\r\n     with the staff of the Minister of War, but saw the Review from the\r\n     Diplomatic Tribune in plain clothes. In fact, ill will between\r\n     France and Germany seems to be on the increase. It looks as if the\r\n     Germans would really be glad to find a fair pretext for going to\r\n     war with France. On the other hand, Boulangism, which is now the\r\n     French term for Jingoism, spreads, especially amongst the reckless\r\n     Radicals and enemies of the present Ministry. And even among the\r\n     better classes, warlike language and, to some degree, a warlike\r\n     spirit grows up with a new generation, which has had no practical\r\n     acquaintance with war. Abject fear of the German armies is being\r\n     succeeded by overweening confidence in themselves.\r\n\r\n     The present Ministry seem to have been afraid of unpopularity\r\n     if they abandoned altogether Boulanger's absurd mobilization\r\n     scheme. The Germans seem to be taking this quietly. Perhaps they\r\n     look on with satisfaction at the French incurring an immense\r\n     expenditure for an experiment apparently without any practical use\r\n     from a military point of view. Perhaps they believe, as many people\r\n     do here, that the Chambers will never really vote the money.\r\n\r\n     It is supposed that the session will be over next week, and I\r\n     trust that then you will be disposed to receive an application from\r\n     me for leave. I am getting quite knocked up by the Paris summer,\r\n     and am in urgent need of rest and country air.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing letter was one of the last communications received from\r\nLord Lyons at Paris, and his official career practically terminated a\r\nfew days later, when he left on leave, destined never to return to the\r\npost which he had so long occupied, for the unfavourable view which\r\nhe held with regard to his physical condition was only too completely\r\njustified.\r\n\r\nHe appears to have passed the months of August and September quietly\r\nwith his near relatives in Sussex. Towards the end of October he\r\nmust have learnt with some surprise that, whereas in March he had\r\nbeen most urgently begged by Lord Salisbury to remain at his post\r\nuntil the end of the year, a successor to him, in the person of Lord\r\nLytton, had been appointed, and that there was no necessity for him to\r\nreturn to Paris. If he, as would have been the case with most people,\r\nreally felt aggrieved at this change of circumstances, there is no\r\ntrace of resentment shown in his correspondence. On the contrary, he\r\nwarmly welcomed the new appointment, and at once set about making\r\narrangements for his successor's convenience. On November 1, he made\r\na formal application to be permitted to resign his appointment, was\r\ncreated an Earl, and the few remaining letters (the latest bearing the\r\ndate of November 20) deal with business details, and unostentatious\r\nacts of kindness to various persons who had been in his service or\r\notherwise connected with him. The very last of all was a characteristic\r\ncommunication to Sir Edwin Egerton, the Chargé d'Affaires at Paris,\r\nrespecting the payment of the fire insurance premium on the Embassy.\r\n\r\nThe close of his life was destined to coincide dramatically with the\r\nclose of his official career. Intellectually there were no signs of\r\ndecay; but physically he was even more worn out than he realized\r\nhimself. On November 28, whilst staying at Norfolk House, he was\r\nstricken with paralysis, and a week later he was dead, without having\r\nin the meanwhile recovered consciousness. Thus the end came at a moment\r\nsingularly appropriate to his well ordered existence, and to no one\r\ncould the time-honoured Latin epitaph have been applied with greater\r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier portion of this work some attempt has been made to\r\nportray Lord Lyons's personality and to explain the causes of his\r\nsuccess as a diplomatist, but the best criterion of the man is to be\r\nfound in his letters, which have been reproduced verbatim, and may be\r\nsaid to constitute a condensed record of the most interesting episodes\r\nin English diplomatic history during a space of nearly thirty years.\r\nThroughout this long series there is hardly to be found an unnecessary\r\nsentence or even a redundant epithet; there is a total absence of any\r\nstraining after effect, of exaggeration, of personal animosity or\r\npredilection, or of any desire to gain his ends by intrigue or trickery.\r\nOn the other hand, they are marked by profound mastery of detail, sound\r\njudgment, inexhaustible patience, an almost inhuman impartiality, and\r\nan obviously single-minded desire to do his best for his country as one\r\nof its most responsible representatives. Such, then, was the character\r\nof the man, and the general public is probably quite unconscious of the\r\ninestimable value to the country of officials of this particular type.\r\n\r\nIt was Lord Lyons's fate twice to represent this country at most\r\ncritical periods during wars, in the course of which, England, while\r\ndesiring to observe the strictest neutrality, aroused the bitterest\r\nhostility on the part of the belligerents. In spite of untiring efforts\r\nhe had the mortification of seeing the relations of England, first with\r\nthe United States and then with France, gradually deteriorate, and never\r\nexperienced the satisfaction, which no one would have appreciated more\r\nhighly than himself, of seeing those unfriendly relations converted into\r\nthe condition which now happily prevails; but it may be fairly said\r\nof him that no one ever laboured more assiduously and efficiently to\r\npromote peace and good will between England and her neighbours; that he\r\nnever made either an enemy or apparently a mistake, and that no other\r\ndiplomatist of his day enjoyed to an equal degree the confidence of\r\nhis chiefs, and the regard of his subordinates. Overshadowed by more\r\nbrilliant and interesting personalities, the unobtrusive services of\r\nLord Lyons are unknown to the rising generation, and probably forgotten\r\nby many of those who have reached middle age; but in the opinion of\r\nthe statesman who amongst living Englishmen is the most competent to\r\njudge, he was the greatest Ambassador who has represented this country\r\nin modern times, and by those whose privilege it was to serve under him,\r\nhis memory will ever be held in affectionate remembrance.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: Lord Salisbury had taken over the Foreign Office upon the\r\ndeath of Lord Iddesleigh on January 12, 1887.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: Dongorita.

WILFRID WARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to find a seeming contradiction between the official\r\nand the private characters of the same individual. Extreme reserve, for\r\ninstance, even an astonishing power of silence in conducting official\r\nwork, may not indicate the same power of silence in private life, or the\r\nsame reserve in the life of the affections. In Lord Lyons there was no\r\nsuch contrast, and no attempt to depict him could pretend to penetrate\r\nhis extreme reserve as to his deeper feelings. This reticence on his\r\npart must severely limit any account of his _vie intime_. Moreover,\r\ncuriously enough there is another difficulty in describing him which\r\nlies in quite an opposite direction. Lord Lyons had a keen sense of\r\nthe ridiculous, and he loved the absolute relaxation of talking pure\r\nnonsense which, however amusing at the moment, would hardly bear the\r\nstrain of repetition. Indeed, very little can be added to the history\r\nof the public life of a man so absolutely reticent as to his feelings,\r\nhis thoughts, and his opinions, which he further concealed rather than\r\nrevealed by an almost burlesque habit of talking nonsense among his\r\nintimates.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to give many instances of his gift for silence when he\r\ndid not wish to be 'drawn' by his interlocutor. A little story told to\r\nme by the late Sir Edward Blount is a case in point.\r\n\r\nSir Edward, waiting to see Lord Lyons at the Embassy, heard talking in\r\nthe next room which lasted some time, and soon distinguished the voice\r\nof M. Blowitz. As soon as he was alone with Lord Lyons he said that he\r\nfelt obliged to warn him that, if he had liked, he could have overheard\r\nhis conversation with the journalist.\r\n\r\n'You might,' was the answer, 'have overheard what was said by M.\r\nBlowitz, but you could not have heard anything said by me for the good\r\nreason that I said nothing at all!'\r\n\r\nIt was never known to anybody, as far as it is possible to ascertain,\r\nwhether Lord Lyons had ever even contemplated marriage, though he\r\ncertainly did not recommend celibacy. 'Matrimony,' he constantly used to\r\nrepeat--slightly varying the phrase in his favourite _Rasselas_--'may\r\nhave thorns, but celibacy has no roses.'\r\n\r\nThere was at one moment, while he was attached to the Embassy at Rome,\r\na rumour that he was engaged to be married. Hearing something of it he\r\ninquired of a lady friend whether she could tell him to whom he was\r\nsupposed to be attached, and later on he discovered that she was herself\r\nthe person in question!\r\n\r\nHis nature was certainly lonely, and I believe from quite early in life\r\nhe was conscious of suffering from loneliness. I have been told of a\r\nletter of his written from school in which this was quite clearly set\r\nforth. In later life he would never have expressed so much. What he felt\r\nand thought on any intimate question can, I think, only be inferred by\r\nhis comments on life in general, or on the sorrows and joys of others.\r\nOnce only I believe did he take any part in directly influencing the\r\nlives of young people in the critical question of marriage. The daughter\r\nof an old friend, with a courage in her confidence which seems to me\r\nalmost phenomenal, told him the story of a mutual affection existing\r\nbetween her and a young man who did not seem to her parents to be a\r\nsufficiently good match. Lord Lyons listened with the utmost attention,\r\nand eventually interceded with his old friend, speaking of the terrible\r\ndanger of causing irremediable pain to two young hearts, and was the\r\nmeans of making these young people happy. Was there, perhaps, in this\r\naction some reminiscence of a possible past happiness lost by himself?\r\nNo one can even make the faintest surmise as to whether this was the\r\ncase. He made no allusion to his own past when telling the story.\r\n\r\nOf his childhood I know little, but there is a toy preserved in the\r\nfamily that gives a curious and characteristic foretaste of what he\r\nwas to become. It is a miniature escritoire fitted with pen and paper\r\nand seals, and also soap and towels, etc. All this was supposed to\r\nbelong to the children's dog, who was promoted in their games to the\r\nposition of an Ambassador, and described as 'His Excellency.' There are\r\nstill existing despatches written to and by 'His Excellency' in the\r\nhandwriting of the four children.\r\n\r\nI think he must have been too old to have joined in his sister Minna's\r\nbit of naughtiness when at Malta she put snuff in the guitar of a young\r\nexquisite who had provoked their mirth, and whose name was Benjamin\r\nDisraeli.\r\n\r\nHe used to say that among his most vivid recollections of his boyhood\r\nwhile at Malta, was the unexpected return of his father and the fleet.\r\nThe children had been deeply engaged in preparing theatricals which were\r\npostponed on account of their father's arrival. He remembered his guilty\r\nfeeling that he ought to be glad, and that he was not glad at all!\r\n\r\nIt was not at first intended that Bickerton Lyons should enter the\r\ndiplomatic service; he began life in the navy. But Bickerton, unlike\r\nhis brother Edmund, had no vocation for the sea. The sorrow of Edmund's\r\nloss, who died at Therapia, from a wound received when commanding his\r\nship in the Sea of Azoph during the Crimean war, was a shadow that never\r\npassed from the lives of the other three. Bickerton was deeply attached\r\nto both his sisters and their families. Annie married Baron Wurtzburg,\r\nand Minna married Lord Fitzalan, afterwards Duke of Norfolk. Other\r\nrelations with whom he was in close intimacy all his life were his aunt,\r\nMrs. Pearson and her children, especially her daughters, Mrs. Lister\r\nVenables and Mrs. Little, who both survived him.\r\n\r\nAll his life Lord Lyons was devoted to children, and especially so to\r\nthe large family of the Duchess of Norfolk, with whom he was able to\r\nindulge his domestic tastes and his love of fun. He spent with them the\r\ngreater part of every holiday, and in the last twenty-five years of his\r\nlife they were frequently with him in Paris. My mother, Lady Victoria,\r\nthe eldest of the family, married very young, and my aunt Minna, the\r\nsecond daughter, became a Carmelite nun. Mary, the eldest of the sisters\r\nwho remained at home, was Lord Lyons's constant companion and secretary.\r\nI think she was the only person who did not experience the strong sense\r\nof his reserve which so impressed those who had to do with him even in\r\neveryday intercourse. In a very serious state of health which followed\r\nhis work at Washington he depended greatly on the companionship of his\r\nnieces. I have been told that for months he could not raise his head,\r\nand the only thing he could do by himself was to play with glass balls\r\non a solitaire board. During this interval in his career, before he\r\naccepted the Embassy at Constantinople, he had more leisure than usual\r\nfor the society of his sister's family, but he had always been devoted\r\nto them when they were quite little children, and was once described as\r\n'an excellent nursery governess.' He said to his sister: 'I could never\r\nhave married; it would not have been right, as I could never have loved\r\nmy own children as much as I love yours.'\r\n\r\nInto this near association with him my sisters and I were more\r\nclosely drawn after the death of our parents. We had lost our mother\r\nin the winter of 1870, and my father, James Hope-Scott, died in the\r\nspring of 1873. It was then that my grandmother took us to live with\r\nher at Arundel, and we were added to the large family party who had\r\noften stayed with him in Paris. My own earliest recollections of my\r\ngreat-uncle are tinged with an awe which no amount of time spent with\r\nhim ever quite overcame; but it did not prevent great enjoyment of all\r\nthe fun we had with him. He was certainly very indulgent to the younger\r\nmembers of the family circle, particularly my brother, who was some\r\nyears younger than the rest of us, and this was especially the case when\r\nwe were his guests.\r\n\r\nI think that what inspired awe was the immense strength of character,\r\nthe reserved force, the severely controlled natural irritability. He\r\nhad, too, a humorous vehemence of expression which seemed at times to be\r\na safety valve to the forces he had under control, and was a reminder of\r\ntheir existence.\r\n\r\nI suppose that nothing could be imagined more stately and more regular\r\nthan life at the Embassy in those days. The Ambassador himself lived\r\nin a routine of absolute regularity and extremely hard work. He got up\r\nat seven, had breakfast at eight, and was, I think, at work by nine\r\no'clock. His very small leisure, when he was alone, was mostly spent\r\nin reading. And this was carefully classified in three divisions. In\r\nthe morning he read history or science, in the evening, between tea and\r\ndinner, biography; while, for an hour before he went to bed he read\r\nnovels. While in France he never left the Embassy. Once a year he did\r\nleave it for his annual holiday--generally spent in England. He used to\r\nboast how many nights in succession--I think in one year it amounted\r\nto over 300--he had slept in the same bed. Every afternoon when we\r\nwere with him, he drove with my grandmother, generally in the Bois de\r\nBoulogne, and in the warm weather we always stopped at some _café_ for\r\nus children to have ices. He also took us to the circus once during each\r\nvisit until, in later life, he became afraid of catching cold. He still\r\noccasionally went to the theatre, to which he had been much devoted as\r\na younger man. We all dined downstairs, and he used to like my youngest\r\nsister and my brother to sit at a little table near the big one and have\r\ndessert. He insisted on this, and was rather pleased than otherwise at\r\nthe scolding he received from an English friend for keeping them up\r\nso late. In later life he used to speak of the pretty picture the two\r\nchildren had made.\r\n\r\nI recollect the extraordinary general sense of importance as to\r\nhis movements in those days, partly on account of their phenomenal\r\nregularity. I could not imagine him ever acting on impulse, even in the\r\nmatter of going up or downstairs. I cannot picture him strolling into\r\nhis own garden except at the fixed hour. This without intention added to\r\nthe dignity of his life which seemed to move like a rather dreary state\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the servants who never saw him break through his routine,\r\nor lose one jot of his dignity, ever guessed at how shy he was of them,\r\nor suspected the rather wistful curiosity he felt about their lives.\r\nI think it was Pierre, the butler, who lived with his family in the\r\n_entresol_ between the two floors of reception rooms in the Embassy.\r\nLord Lyons was much interested in their family life, and liked to\r\nspeculate as to what went on there. One inconvenient result of his\r\nextreme shyness was that when he really wished to alter any detail as\r\nto the daily routine, he could not bring himself to impart his wishes\r\nto any of the servants. I have often heard him say how tired he was of\r\nthe same breakfast which never varied in the least, and he would add\r\nthat his Italian valet Giuseppe was so convinced that it was the only\r\nbreakfast he liked that when he travelled, the man took incredible\r\npains that the coffee, the eggs, the rolls, the marmalade, the two\r\ntangerine oranges in winter and the tiny basket of strawberries in\r\nsummer, should not differ an iota from those served up every morning\r\nat the Embassy. But Lord Lyons could never summon up courage to speak\r\nto him on the subject. On certain days Pierre undertook Giuseppe's\r\nduties, and for many years Lord Lyons wished that Pierre would arrange\r\nhis things as they were arranged by Giuseppe, but he never told him\r\nso. While he grumbled, he was amused at the situation and at himself.\r\nIndeed, his keen sense of the ridiculous and his endless enjoyment of\r\nnonsense explain a good deal of his life. He used to say that as he was\r\ntoo shy to look at the servants' faces, he had learnt to know them by\r\ntheir silk stockinged calves. When he dined alone he made an amusement\r\nof identifying the six or seven pairs of calves, and was proud of his\r\nsuccess in this odd game of skill.\r\n\r\nI recall one ludicrous instance of his shyness with servants. It was\r\nhis custom annually when he came to stay with us to shake hands with\r\nthe old family nurse, and on one occasion, meeting her on the stairs,\r\nhe leant across the banisters to perform the ceremony with such\r\n_empressement_ and effort that he broke one of the supports. He always\r\nafterwards alluded to the extraordinary emotion he had shown in this\r\ngreeting. Nothing is so unaccountable as shyness, but it was curious\r\nthat a man who had seen so much of public life and of society should\r\nhave so much of it as he had. I remember once helping him to escape\r\nwith, for him, astonishing speed across the garden of a country house,\r\nwhen a very agreeable woman, whom I believe he really liked, had come\r\nto call; he was as full of glee as if he were a boy running away from a\r\nschool-master.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRITISH EMBASSY, PARIS.\r\n\r\n_F. Contet, Paris. Phot._]\r\n\r\nI don't think that in Paris he ever gave way to such impulses; they were\r\nthe relaxation of a shy nature in the holidays.\r\n\r\nTo return for one moment to Paris. He occasionally gave a big official\r\ndinner which I don't think he at all enjoyed, and of which we knew\r\nnothing. But he certainly enjoyed small gatherings, especially if they\r\nincluded old friends who were passing through Paris, although not one\r\nword of ordinary sentiment would probably pass his lips, nor would one\r\nof the day's arrangements be changed. He certainly enjoyed the society\r\nof his women friends, and I liked to watch him talking to Mrs. Augustus\r\nCraven, the author of the _Récit d'une Soeur_. Two characteristic\r\nsayings of his about the Cravens I remember. He was always pleased at\r\nshowing his knowledge of the most orthodox and strict views of Roman\r\naffairs. He used to say that Mrs. Craven could never make amends for\r\nher conduct at the time of the Vatican Council--when her _salon_ was a\r\ncentre for 'inopportunist' Bishops--unless she went back to Rome and\r\ngave 'Infallibilist tea-parties.'\r\n\r\nMr. Augustus Craven, her husband, was intensely mysterious in manner,\r\nand Lord Lyons used to call him 'the General of the Jesuits.' Once, on\r\nmeeting him in London, he asked him if his wife were with him. Mrs.\r\nCraven was staying with Lady Cowper, and Mr. Craven answered with\r\nsolemn, slow and mysterious tones: 'She is at Wrest,' and my uncle said\r\n'Requiescat in Pace,' with equal solemnity.\r\n\r\nI think that with all his natural British prejudices he liked French\r\npeople and their ways. He used to maintain that Frenchwomen were more\r\ndomestic and kept earlier hours than Englishwomen. He certainly liked\r\nFrench cooking. He spoke once in tones of horror of an Englishman who\r\nhad committed the monstrosity of putting pepper on young green peas--a\r\ncrime of which a Frenchman was incapable.\r\n\r\nMany of his opinions, however, like Dr. Johnson's, were evoked by the\r\nspirit of contradiction, and it was chiefly with English people that I\r\nheard him talk about the French.\r\n\r\nIn the holidays in England reading aloud was one of his chief pleasures.\r\nHe read much poetry to us at one time, but later I think he had to\r\ngive this up as it tired him. At Arundel he wrote his letters in the\r\ndressing-room opening out of his bedroom. We used to sit there waiting\r\nfor him before the appointed time, making drawings in red ink, of which\r\nthere was always a large supply, when he would make a mock solemn\r\nentrance, as of a stiff professor. We were allowed to scribble during\r\nthe reading, but, woe betide us! if we showed any inattention. He read\r\n'Marmion,' Southey's 'Thalaba,' and, I think, 'The Curse of Kehama,'\r\nalso much of Byron, the 'Siege of Corinth,' with especial enjoyment. He\r\nknew many pages of Byron by heart, and we used to get him to repeat any\r\namount while out walking. 'Rejected Addresses,' 'Bombastes Furioso,'\r\n'The Rape of the Lock' were also among the many things he liked to\r\nrecite. I wish I could remember half the things he read or repeated\r\nto us. I am sure there was no Tennyson, and certainly no Browning. He\r\nused to jeer at the obscurity of both the Brownings, and to mutter such\r\nphrases as the 'thundering white silence' of Mrs. Browning with intense\r\nscorn. I think he may have met the Brownings when he was in Rome. He saw\r\na good deal of Fanny and Adelaide Kemble at that time. He liked Adelaide\r\nmuch the best of the two, and used to quote with delight a saying of\r\nhers as to the Brownings. When she was told of the birth of their son\r\nshe exclaimed: 'There are now then not one incomprehensible, or two\r\nincomprehensibles, but three incomprehensibles!'\r\n\r\nHe was always amused at the Kemble grand manner. He used to imitate the\r\ndramatic utterance with which Fanny Kemble frightened a young waiter\r\nwho had brought her some beer. 'I asked for _water_, boy; you bring me\r\n_beer_!'\r\n\r\nAt that same time he knew Sir Frederick Leighton, and they once had a\r\npillow fight! Who could imagine that pillow fight who only knew him as\r\nAmbassador in Paris? He always spoke as if he had enjoyed life in Rome;\r\nhe was devoted to the theatre, and he had much congenial society. He\r\nused to say, too, that Pius IX. was the most agreeable sovereign with\r\nwhom he ever had diplomatic relations.\r\n\r\nLord Lyons's literary tastes were not those of the present generation.\r\nHe declared that he only liked verse that rhymed and music with a tune.\r\nHe loved the sonorous sound of Byron as he loved the solemn cadence of\r\nLatin verse. All the time the love of absurdity was never far off. He\r\nwould suddenly imitate the action of a schoolboy repeating Latin verse,\r\nfirst with his arms and then with his feet! A stout, very dignified\r\nelderly man, in some path in the garden, punctuating the verse with the\r\naction of his feet, is sufficiently surprising. Occasionally he would\r\nhave the oddest freaks of this kind, and I remember an afternoon when he\r\ntook a whim of pretending to be imbecile; he made the most extraordinary\r\nfaces, and not a word of sense could be got from him.\r\n\r\nOnce in a steamer on the lake of Lucerne he insisted on his nieces\r\njoining him in impersonating a typical family of English tourists\r\nout for their holiday. He was the _paterfamilias_, one niece was his\r\nwife, another the German governess, a third his child. In the middle\r\nof the performance he found that he was being regarded with surprise\r\nand curiosity by some English society friends whose acquaintance with\r\nhim had hitherto been exclusively in the character of a very dignified\r\nambassador.\r\n\r\nMy aunt, Mary Howard, used to read aloud to him by the hour, and we all\r\nenjoyed these times immensely. It would be difficult to say how often we\r\nhad 'Pickwick,' 'Cranford,' 'Rasselas,' 'The Rose and the Ring,' and\r\n'Mrs. Boss's Niece.' I have never met anybody outside that circle who\r\never even heard of 'Mrs. Boss's Niece;' it is a serious loss. To quote\r\nat all appropriately from any of his favourites was to be exceedingly\r\nin his good books for the rest of the day. Like the late Lord Salisbury\r\nhe delighted in Miss Yonge; he could not have too many pairs of twins,\r\nor too large a family circle to read about. He loved the analysis of\r\ndomestic life, and would have been ready to canonise any really and\r\ngenuinely unselfish character. Detective stories were a great joy. 'The\r\nHouse on the Marsh,' and 'Called Back,' were among the most successful.\r\nHe used to prolong discussion as to the solution of the mystery, and\r\nwould even knock at our doors very late at night if he thought he had\r\nidentified the murderer, and mutter in dramatic undertones, 'So-an-so\r\nwas the man who did it.' But the detective story was never read before\r\ndinner, and to look into the book meanwhile was a crime. Anybody who\r\npeeped to see the end of a novel 'deserved to be dragged to death by\r\nwild horses.' And there must be no skipping. Only descriptions of\r\nscenery--to which he had the strongest objection--might be left out.\r\n\r\nThe annual holiday was, for the most part, spent with the Duchess of\r\nNorfolk at Arundel, and later at Heron's Ghyll. Sometimes he went to\r\nGermany to take the waters, in company with his eldest sister, Baroness\r\nWurtzburg. When in England he always paid a certain number of country\r\nhouse visits. These generally included Knowsley and Woburn. The visits\r\nthat were paid every year, I think without exception, were those to\r\nLord Stratford de Redcliffe, and to an old schoolfellow--Major Trower,\r\nwho had been with him at Winchester. Major Trower was one of four old\r\nWykehamists who remained close friends. The other two had died some time\r\nbefore. I think the visit to Raby was annual. He specially enjoyed the\r\nsociety of the Duchess of Cleveland and of Lady Mary Hope. He was at\r\nRaby in the September before he died, and I believe that was the last\r\nvisit he ever paid. The famous visitors' book there always amused him,\r\nand he was fond of quoting from it. One of his own contributions I\r\nremember was written with mock modesty. He took from Lockhart's Spanish\r\nballads the lines:--\r\n\r\n    ''Twere better to be silent before such a crowd of folk,\r\n    Than utter words as meaningless as he did when he spoke.'\r\n\r\nHis recollections of the society of his youth in these houses had some\r\namusing details. I think it was at the Duchess of Bedford's that there\r\nwas a Christmas tree, off which each young man visitor was given a piece\r\nof flowered silk for a waistcoat. Early next morning, at Mr. Lyons's\r\nsuggestion, one of the young men, provided with a list of the names and\r\naddresses of the tailors employed by the others, went up to London and\r\nbrought back all the waistcoats made up in time to be worn at dinner\r\nthat evening. He used to speak with some amusement of the ungraciousness\r\nof Rogers, the poet, whom he met at the Derbys'. On one occasion Rogers\r\nhad lost his spectacles, and Mr. Lyons went a long way in the big house\r\nto find them. Rogers who was drinking tea took the spectacles, but did\r\nnot thank him, and, a moment later, when he heard Mr. Lyons refusing\r\nsugar, he observed to the company: 'That young man, having nothing else\r\nto be proud of, is proud of not having sugar with his tea!'\r\n\r\nI don't suppose that he talked much as a young man, and probably he\r\nfollowed the rule he always preached, that young men should speak\r\n'little but often.'\r\n\r\nAmong the few serious sayings to be quoted from him was that the great\r\naxiom in diplomacy was 'Never do anything to-day that can be put off\r\ntill to-morrow.'\r\n\r\nIn speaking of Leo XIII. and his successful policy with Bismarck, he\r\nsaid: 'Those very clever men succeed by doing what no one expects. My\r\nsuccess has been made by always doing what was expected of me. I always\r\ndid the safe thing.'\r\n\r\nIn conversation he enjoyed a Johnsonian style of repartee. One retort of\r\nhis had an excellent practical result. He acted as a special constable\r\nin London during the Chartist Riots. Hearing a woman in the dense crowd\r\ncry out, 'Let me faint, let me faint,' he turned to her at once, and\r\nsaid: 'Pray do, madam,' whereupon she recovered immediately.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Berlin Conference when the Disraeli party were making the\r\nmost of the accession of Crete, a visitor at the Embassy, gushing over\r\nits charms concluded with the assertion that Crete was the loveliest\r\nisland in the world. Whereupon Mr. William Barrington (now Sir William\r\nBarrington) said drily: 'Have you seen all the others?' This amused\r\nLord Lyons immensely, and some years afterwards when a young lady who\r\nwas and is still famous for her powers of conversation had talked at\r\nhim for some time, he adopted the same method. After a good many other\r\nsweeping assertions she said of some work that had just come out: 'It is\r\nthe best written book that has appeared this century.' 'Ah,' he said,\r\n'have you read all the others?' Being alone with her soon afterwards I\r\nwas not surprised at her inquiring of me dubiously whether I liked my\r\ngreat-uncle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said that, in the matter of his personal religion,\r\nLord Lyons was very reticent. He was absolutely regular in his\r\nattendance at the Sunday service in Paris and in England. He was very\r\nfond of the singing of English hymns.\r\n\r\nHe never had any sympathy with the ritualist party in the Church of\r\nEngland, and was inclined to be sarcastic as to those whom he designated\r\n'Puseyites,' as was then the custom.\r\n\r\nOne who knew him very well told me that for a time he was somewhat\r\nunsettled in the matter of definite religious belief. There is also\r\nevidence that in middle life the idea of joining the Catholic Church\r\nhad been present to him as a possibility. As far as can be known it\r\nwas during the last summer of his life that he began to consider the\r\nquestion practically. It is not surprising that Lord Lyons, when he\r\ntook the matter up, showed the same characteristics in its regard that\r\nhe had shown in any serious question throughout his life, namely, the\r\ngreatest thoroughness and care in studying the Catholic religion and\r\nin carrying out its practical side, reserve as to deep sentiment, not\r\nwithout humorous touches which were intensely characteristic. Newman's\r\nworks formed the chief part of his study during those summer months.\r\nA letter written in that August says of him, 'He is always reading\r\nNewman.' It was not until shortly before his death that he spoke on the\r\nmatter to any of the family. A note in the writing of his secretary and\r\nintimate friend--Mr. George Sheffield--says that he spoke of it six\r\nweeks before his death. Lord Lyons had known Bishop Butt for many years\r\nwhen he was parish priest at Arundel, and it was to him that he applied\r\nfor advice. He studied the Penny Catechism most carefully, learning the\r\nanswers by heart, like a child. He began to fulfil the practices of a\r\nCatholic with great regularity. He went to Mass daily at ten o'clock,\r\nand adopted little habits of self-denial and showed greater liberality\r\nin almsgiving. The last honour he ever received was the offer of an\r\nearldom on his retiring from the Paris Embassy. He suggested to Dr. Butt\r\nthat it would be a good act of mortification to refuse this honour, but\r\nthe Bishop would not advise him to do so. He began, against his usual\r\ncustom, to give money to crossing-sweepers or beggars in the streets,\r\nand I am told by my aunt, Lady Phillippa Stewart, that, after returning\r\nfrom my wedding, he said to her: 'Is it not customary after an event\r\nof this kind to give money in alms?' He then suggested that he should\r\nmake some offering to the hospitals and asked her to write out the\r\nnames of those she thought would be the most suitable. It was about\r\nten days before my marriage in November, 1887, that I first heard of\r\nhis intentions. I learnt it in a fashion very characteristic of him. I\r\nwas not staying in the house, but I had been dining with him when he\r\nremarked casually: 'Really, my austerities are becoming alarming. I have\r\ngiven up soup for dinner and jam for breakfast.' This struck me as a\r\nnovel proceeding, as I knew his fondness for jam and that the ordinary\r\nroutine of dinner beginning with a clear soup was a fixed ceremonial\r\nwith him. That night I questioned my aunt, who told me that he had been\r\nfor some weeks preparing to join the Church. It was at this time that\r\nhe said to one of the family: 'I am now ready to be received as soon\r\nas the Bishop likes.' He also characteristically consulted his nephew,\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk, as to whether he ought to inform Lord Salisbury of\r\nhis intention of becoming a Catholic. He did not, during these weeks,\r\nknow that he was in any danger. The last time I saw my great uncle was\r\nat my wedding. He had a stroke about ten days afterwards, and to all\r\nappearance became unconscious. Dr. Butt, knowing what his intentions had\r\nbeen, had no hesitation in giving him conditional Baptism and Extreme\r\nUnction. I was at the funeral at Arundel, and saw the coffin lowered\r\ninto the vault in the Fitzalan Chapel, where his sister Minna had been\r\nplaced two and a half years earlier.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI feel most strongly as I conclude these very imperfect notes, how\r\nentirely Lord Lyons belonged to a generation of Englishmen now long\r\npassed away. The force of will, the power of self-devotion, the dignity,\r\nthe reticence, the minute regularity, the sense of order, the degree\r\nof submission to authority and the undoubting assertion of his own\r\nauthority towards others--all were elements in a strong personality.\r\nThere are, no doubt, strong men now, but their strength is of a\r\ndifferent kind. Englishmen to-day are obliged to be more expansive\r\nand unreserved. No fixed routine can be followed now as then; no man\r\ncan so guard his own life and his own personality from the public\r\neye. Lord Lyons was not of the type that makes the successful servant\r\nof the democracy. Fidelity, reticence, self-effacement, are not the\r\ncharacteristics that are prominent in the popular idea of the strong man\r\nto-day. But no one who knew Lord Lyons can doubt that those qualities\r\nwere in him a great part of his strength.

In Two Volumes._ =30s. net.=\r\n\r\nThe late Lord Lyons was not only the most prominent but the most trusted\r\nEnglish diplomatist of his day, and so great was the confidence felt in\r\nhis ability that he was paid the unique compliment of being offered the\r\npost of Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nLord Newton, who has now undertaken the task of preparing a memoir of\r\nhim, enjoys the advantage of having served under him for five years at\r\nthe Paris Embassy. The interest of this work lies, however, less in the\r\npersonality of the Ambassador than in the highly important events in\r\nwhich he played so prominent a part.\r\n\r\nLord Lyons was the British representative at Washington during\r\nthe period of the Civil War; subsequently he was Ambassador at\r\nConstantinople for two years; and finally he spent twenty years--from\r\n1867 to 1887--as Ambassador at Paris. During the whole of this eventful\r\nperiod his advice was constantly sought by the Home Government upon\r\nevery foreign question of importance, and his correspondence throws\r\nfresh light upon obscure passages in diplomatic history.\r\n\r\nIn this book will be found hitherto unpublished information relating to\r\nsuch matters as the critical relations between England and the United\r\nStates during the course of the Civil War; the political situation in\r\nFrance during the closing years of the Second Empire; the secret attempt\r\nmade by the British Foreign Secretary to avert the Franco-German War,\r\nand the explanation of its failure; the internal and external policy\r\nof France during the early years of the Third Republic; the War Scare\r\nof 1875; the Congress of Berlin; the Egyptian Expedition; Anglo-French\r\npolitical relations, and many other matters of interest.\r\n\r\nThe method selected by the writer has been to reproduce all important\r\ncorrespondence verbatim, and it may be confidently asserted that the\r\nstudent of foreign politics will find in this work a valuable record of\r\nmodern diplomatic history.\r\n\r\n    LONDON: EDWARD ARNOLD, 41 & 43 MADDOX STREET.

Sir HERBERT MAXWELL, Bart.\r\n\r\n    _In Two Volumes. With Portraits. Demy 8vo._ =30s. net.=\r\n\r\nBorn in the year 1800 and dying in 1870, Lord Clarendon lived through\r\na period of social, political, and economic change more rapid probably\r\nthan had been witnessed in any similar space of time in the previous\r\nhistory of mankind. It was his lot, moreover, to wield considerable\r\ninfluence over the course of affairs, inasmuch as his public service,\r\nextending over fifty years, caused him to be employed in a succession\r\nof highly responsible, and even critical, situations. British Minister\r\nat Madrid at the outbreak and during the course of the Carlist Civil\r\nWar from 1833 to 1839, he was admitted into Lord Melbourne's Cabinet\r\nimmediately upon returning to England in the latter year. He was Lord\r\nLieutenant of Ireland throughout the memorable famine years, 1847-1852.\r\nRelieved of that arduous post, Lord Clarendon entered Lord Aberdeen's\r\ngovernment in 1852 as Foreign Secretary, which office he retained\r\nthrough the Crimean War, and became responsible for the terms of the\r\nTreaty of Paris in 1856. On Lord Palmerston's death in 1865, he returned\r\nto the Foreign Office, and had to deal with the settlement of the\r\n\"Alabama\" claims.\r\n\r\nThe annals of the first half of Queen Victoria's reign having been\r\npretty thoroughly explored and dealt with by many competent writers, the\r\nchief interest in these pages will be found in Lord Clarendon's private\r\ncorrespondence, which has been well preserved, and has been entrusted to\r\nSir Herbert Maxwell for the purpose of this memoir. Lord Clarendon was\r\na fluent and diligent correspondent; Charles Greville and others among\r\nhis contemporaries frequently expressed a hope that his letters should\r\nsome day find their way into literature. Sir Arthur Helps, for instance,\r\nwrote as follows in _Macmillan's Magazine_: \"Lord Clarendon was a man\r\nwho indulged, notwithstanding his public labours, in an immense private\r\ncorrespondence. There were some persons to whom, I believe, he wrote\r\ndaily, and perhaps in after years we shall be favoured--those of us\r\nwho live to see it--with a correspondence which will enlighten us as\r\nto many of the principal topics of our own period.\" It is upon this\r\ncorrespondence that Sir Herbert Maxwell has chiefly relied in tracing\r\nthe motives, principles, and conduct of one of the last Whig statesmen.\r\nAmong the letters dealt with, and now published for the first time, are\r\nthose from Lord Melbourne, Lord Palmerston, Lord Aberdeen, Lord Derby,\r\nM. Thiers, M. Guizot, the Emperor Louis Napoleon, etc., and many ladies.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM AUGUSTUS, DUKE OF CUMBERLAND, HIS EARLY LIFE AND TIMES,\r\n1721-1748.\r\n\r\nBy the Hon. EVAN CHARTERIS,\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF \"AFFAIRS OF SCOTLAND, 1744-1746.\"\r\n\r\n_With Plans and Illustrations._ =12s. 6d. net.= [_In preparation._\r\n\r\nMr. Charteris has a good subject in \"Butcher\" Cumberland, not only on\r\naccount of the historical and romantic interest of his background, but\r\nalso by reason of the Duke's baneful reputation.\r\n\r\nIn the present volume the author has carried the career of the Duke of\r\nCumberland down to the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle. The period includes\r\nthe Duke's campaigns in Flanders against Marshal Saxe, the Battle of\r\nCulloden, and the measures taken for the suppression of the Jacobites in\r\nScotland. Mr. Charteris has had the exceptional advantage of studying\r\nthe Cumberland Papers at Windsor Castle, and it is largely by the aid\r\nof hitherto unpublished documents that he is now able to throw fresh\r\nlight on a character which has been the subject of so much malevolent\r\ncriticism. At the same time the volume deals with the social and\r\npolitical conditions among which Cumberland was called on to play so\r\nimportant a part in the life of the nation. These have been treated by\r\nthe author with some fulness of detail. Cumberland, in spite of his\r\nforeign origin, was remarkably typical of the characteristics of the\r\nearlier Georgian period, and an endeavour has been made in the present\r\nvolume to establish the link between the Duke and the politics, the\r\nmorals, the aims, and the pursuits of the age in which he lived.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY ART AND MY FRIENDS.\r\n\r\nTHE REMINISCENCES OF SIR F. H. COWEN.\r\n\r\n_With Portrait. Demy 8vo._ =10s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\nIn the course of a long and distinguished musical career, Sir Frederic\r\nCowen has had opportunities of visiting many parts of the world, of\r\nmeeting all the most eminent artists of the last half-century, and\r\nof amassing material for an extremely diverting volume of personal\r\nrecollections. As a child he enjoyed the privilege of being embraced\r\nby the great Piccolomini; as a young man he toured with Trebelli,\r\nand became acquainted with the famous Rubinstein, with Bülow, and\r\nwith Joachim. In later life he numbered such well-known musicians as\r\nPachmann, Paderewski, Sir Arthur Sullivan, and the de Reszkes, among his\r\nfriends. Nor was the circle of his intimates entirely confined to the\r\nworld of music; he was on terms of the closest friendship with Corney\r\nGrain, with George Grossmith and Arthur Cecil; he capped the puns of\r\nHenry J. Byron and Sir Francis Burnand; he laughed at the practical\r\njokes of Toole, at the caricatures which Phil May drew for him of\r\nhis friends. To the public Sir Frederick Cowen is well known as the\r\nconductor of Covent Garden Promenade and Philharmonic Concerts, as the\r\ncomposer of such celebrated songs as \"The Better Land\" and \"The Promise\r\nof Life,\" of \"The Corsair\" and \"The Butterfly's Ball.\" In these pages\r\nhe shows himself to be a keen but kindly student of human nature, who\r\ncan describe the various experiences of his past life with a genial but\r\nhumorous pen. The inexhaustible fund of anecdote from which he draws\r\ntends still further to enliven an amusing and lively volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CIVIL SERVANT IN BURMA.\r\n\r\nBy Sir HERBERT THIRKELL WHITE, K.C.I.E.\r\n\r\n_With 16 Pages of Illustrations. Demy 8vo._ =12s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\nSir Herbert Thirkell White, who has but recently retired from the post\r\nof Lieutenant-Governor of Burma, which he filled with ability and\r\ndistinction, has now written what he modestly calls a \"plain story\" of\r\nmore than thirty years of official life in India. In this volume are\r\nnarrated the experiences of an Indian Civilian who has devoted the best\r\npart of his existence to the service of the Empire, and is in a position\r\nto speak with assurance of the many complicated problems with which the\r\nwhite man in India is continually faced. Sir Herbert's acquaintance with\r\nBurma began in 1878; since then he has had every opportunity of judging\r\nthe peculiar habits, customs, and characteristics of the native Burmese,\r\nand has been able to compile a valuable record of the impressions they\r\nhave made upon his mind. It was his fate to hold official positions\r\nof increasing importance during the Viceroyalties of Lord Ripon, Lord\r\nDufferin, and Lord Curzon; he was privileged to serve such distinguished\r\nchiefs as Sir Charles Bernard and Sir Charles Crosthwaite, and witnessed\r\nthat pacification of Burma which the last-named Chief Commissioner has\r\ndescribed so eloquently in his well-known book on the subject. Sir\r\nHerbert writes clearly and with knowledge of every aspect of Burmese\r\nlife and character, and this volume of his recollections should prove\r\nextremely popular among English readers who are interested in the\r\ngovernment of our Indian Empire and the daily routine of the Indian\r\nCivil Servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRTY YEARS IN KASHMIR.\r\n\r\nBy ARTHUR NEVE, F.R.C.S.E.\r\n\r\n_With Illustrations and a Map. Demy 8vo._ =12s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\nThe stupendous natural surroundings amidst which they dwell have\r\ninspired sojourners in Kashmir and other Himalayan countries to produce\r\nsome of the finest books of travel to be found. Among them will have to\r\nbe included in future this book of Dr. Arthur Neve's, so effectively\r\ndoes the author reveal the wonders of the land of towering peaks and\r\nhuge glaciers where he has made his home for the last thirty years.\r\n\r\nGoing out to Kashmir in 1882 under the auspices of the Church Missionary\r\nSociety, Dr. Neve took over the charge of the Kashmir Mission Hospital\r\nat Srinagur from Dr. Edmund Downes, who was retiring, and has stayed\r\nthere ever since. In his earlier chapters he gives some account of the\r\nPunjab and Kashmir in the eighties, and also of the work of the mission.\r\nHe then gets to the principal motif of the book--the exploring tours and\r\nmountaineering expeditions to which he has devoted his spare time. Nanga\r\nParbat, Nun Kun, and many other Himalayan giants, are within hail of\r\nSrinagur, and before he has finished with the book the reader will find\r\nhe has acquired the next best thing to a first-hand knowledge of this\r\nmagnificent country. Dr. Neve has also a great deal that is interesting\r\nto tell about the people of various races and religions who inhabit the\r\nvalleys, and from whom his medical help gained him a warm welcome at all\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nA series of rare photographs gives a pictorial support to the\r\nletter-press.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPORT AND FOLK-LORE IN THE HIMALAYA.\r\n\r\nBy Captain H. L. HAUGHTON.\r\n\r\n(36TH SIKHS.)\r\n\r\n_With Illustrations from the Author's Photographs. One Volume._\r\n\r\n_Demy 8vo._ =12s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\nCaptain Haughton has written a book which should prove a welcome\r\naddition to the library of every sportsman, as well as being of supreme\r\ninterest to the naturalist and the student of folk-lore. On the subject\r\nof sport the author writes with that thorough insight and sympathy\r\nwhich are the fruits of many years' practical experience with rod and\r\nrifle, in the jungle, on river-bank or mountain-side. In his agreeable\r\nsociety the reader may stalk the markhor or the ibex, lightly throw his\r\n\"Sir Richard\" across some Kashmiri trout-stream, or lie in wait for the\r\nHimalayan black bear on its way to feed; and if the author's description\r\nof his many amusing and exciting adventures and experiences is eminently\r\nreadable, the value of his work is still further enhanced by his\r\nintimate knowledge of natural history, and by the introduction of many\r\nof those old Indian legendary tales that he has culled from the lips of\r\nnative Shikaris round the camp-fire at night. The book is illustrated\r\nthroughout with a series of remarkably interesting photographs taken by\r\nthe author in the course of his many sporting expeditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOLLECTIONS OF A PENINSULAR VETERAN.\r\n\r\nBy the late Lieut.-Colonel JOSEPH ANDERSON, C.B., K.H.\r\n\r\n_With Photogravure Portrait. Demy 8vo._ =10s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\nThe late Lieut.-Colonel Joseph Anderson was born in 1790, and from the\r\nage of fifteen, when he received a commission as Ensign in the 78th\r\nRegiment, to within a few years of his death in 1877, his career was\r\nalmost continuously as adventurous as it was distinguished. In 1806\r\nhe saw active service for the first time, when he took part in the\r\nexpedition to Calabria; in the following year he served in the Egyptian\r\nCampaign of that date; and during the Peninsular War he fought at the\r\nbattles of Maida, Busaco, Fuentes d'Onoro, was wounded at Talavera, and\r\naccompanied Wellington on the retreat to the lines of Torres Vedras. A\r\nfew years later Captain Anderson, now a Captain in the York Chasseurs,\r\nwas sent with his regiment to Barbadoes, and was present at the capture\r\nof Guadeloupe in 1815. He was appointed Colonel Commandant of the Penal\r\nSettlement at Norfolk Island in 1834, where his humane endeavours to\r\nreform the prevailing penal system, and his efforts to quell mutinous\r\nconvicts, met with marked success. Nine years later Colonel Anderson\r\nwent to India to take part in the Mahratta Campaign, and at the Battle\r\nof Punniar (where he commanded a Brigade) was severely wounded when\r\ncharging the enemy's guns. After retiring from the Service, Colonel\r\nAnderson settled down in Australia, and it was at his home near\r\nMelbourne that these memories were compiled, during the later years of a\r\nstrenuous and active life, for the edification of his family. They are\r\nwritten in a simple, unaffected style, which renders them peculiarly\r\nreadable, and form a most instructive record of the manners and customs,\r\nof the mode of warfare, and the military and social life of a past age,\r\nand a bygone generation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORIES OF A SOLDIER'S LIFE.\r\n\r\nBy Major-General Sir H. M. BENGOUGH, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n_With Portrait. Demy 8vo._ =8s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\nMajor-General Sir H. M. Bengough joined the army in 1855, and retired\r\nin 1898, after more than forty years of distinguished service in all\r\nquarters of the Empire. His first experience of active warfare dates\r\nfrom the Crimea; later on he took the field in the Zulu War and the\r\nBurma Expedition of 1885. In days of peace he held various high commands\r\nin India, South Africa, and Jamaica, and finally commanded a brigade\r\nof infantry at Aldershot. In this volume of personal recollections the\r\nauthor narrates the many varied incidents and experiences of a long\r\nmilitary career and vividly describes the campaigns in which he took\r\npart. He also gives an interesting account of his adventures in the\r\nrealm of sport--pig-sticking, tiger-shooting, and pursuing other forms\r\nof game in India and elsewhere; subjects upon which a long experience\r\nenables him to write with expert knowledge. It will be strange indeed if\r\nso interesting an autobiographical volume from the pen of a deservedly\r\npopular soldier and sportsman fails to appeal to a wide public.\r\n\r\n\r\nZACHARY STOYANOFF.\r\n\r\nPages from the Autobiography of a Bulgarian Insurgent.\r\n\r\nTranslated by M. POTTER.\r\n\r\n_One Volume. Demy 8vo._ =10s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\nIn this volume Zachary Stoyanoff gives us the narrative of his personal\r\nexperiences during the Bulgarian outbreaks of 1875 and 1876. Almost\r\nby accident he became an \"apostle\" of rebellion, and was sent out\r\nforthwith to range the country, stirring up the villagers and forming\r\nlocal committees. It is an amazing story. With unsurpassable candour\r\nhe portrays for us the leaders, their enthusiasm, their incredible\r\nshort-sightedness, and the pitiful inadequacy of their preparations.\r\nThe bubble burst, and after a miserable attempt at flight, Stoyanoff\r\nwas taken prisoner and sent to Philippopolis for trial. There is no\r\nattempt at heroics. With the same Boswellian simplicity he reveals his\r\nfears, his cringing, his mendacity, and incidentally gives us a graphic\r\npicture, not wholly black, of the conquering Turk. The narrative ends\r\nabruptly while he is still in peril of his life. One is glad to know\r\nthat, somehow, he escaped. A very human document, and a remarkable\r\ncontrast to the startling exhibition of efficiency given to the world by\r\nthe Bulgarians in their latest struggle with the Turks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPLENDID FAILURES.\r\n\r\nBy HARRY GRAHAM,\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF \"A GROUP OF SCOTTISH WOMEN,\" \"THE MOTHER OF PARLIAMENTS,\" ETC.\r\n\r\n_With Portraits. Demy 8vo._ =10s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps unlikely that any two individuals will agree as to the\r\nproper definition of the term \"A Splendid Failure\"--a phrase of which\r\nthe origin would appear to be obscure. It may, however, be roughly\r\nstated that the \"Splendid Failures\" of the past divide themselves\r\nnaturally into three classes: those whom their contemporaries invested\r\nwith a fictitious or exaggerated splendour which posterity is quite\r\nunable to comprehend or appreciate; those whom the modern world regards\r\nwith admiration--but who signally failed in impressing the men of\r\ntheir own generation; and those who, gifted with genius and inspired\r\nwith lofty ideals, never justified the world's high opinion of their\r\ntalents or fulfilled the promise of their early days. In this volume of\r\nbiographical essays, the author of \"A Group of Scottish Women\" and other\r\npopular works has dealt with a selection of \"splendid failures\" of whose\r\npersonal history the public knows but little, though well acquainted\r\nwith their names. Wolfe Tone, \"the first of the Fenians\"; Benjamin\r\nHaydon, the \"Cockney Raphael\"; Toussaint L'Ouverture, the \"Napoleon\r\nof San Domingo\"; William Betty, the \"Infant Roscius\"; and \"Champagne\"\r\nTownshend, the politician of Pitt's day, may be included under this\r\ncategory. The reader cannot fail to be interested in that account which\r\nthe author gives of the ill-fated Archduke Maximilian's attempt to found\r\na Mexican monarchy; in his careful review of the work and character\r\nof Hartley Coleridge; and in his biographical study of George Smythe,\r\nthat friend of Disraeli whom the statesman-novelist took as his model\r\nfor the hero of \"Coningsby.\" This book, which should appeal strongly\r\nto all readers of literary essays, is illustrated with eight excellent\r\nportraits.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CORINTHIAN YACHTSMAN'S HANDBOOK.\r\n\r\nBy FRANCIS B. COOKE.\r\n\r\n_With 20 Folding Plates of Designs for Yachts, and numerous black and\r\nwhite Illustrations. Demy 8vo._ =10s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\nThis new handbook covers the sport of yachting in all its branches. The\r\nwriter, who has had many years' experience of cruising and racing in\r\nyachts and boats of all types, has treated the subject in a thoroughly\r\npractical manner. The book is divided into six parts.\r\n\r\nIn Part I., which deals with the selection of a yacht, the various types\r\nand rigs suitable for Corinthian yachting are discussed. The designing\r\nand building of new craft are also dealt with at some length, and\r\ndesigns and descriptions of a number of up-to-date small cruisers are\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nIn Part II. some hints are given as to where to station the yacht. All\r\navailable headquarters within easy reach of London are described, and\r\nthe advantages and disadvantages of each pointed out.\r\n\r\nPart III. is devoted to the equipment of yachts, and contains a wealth\r\nof information as to the internal arrangement, rigging, and fittings of\r\nsmall cruisers.\r\n\r\nPart IV. treats of the maintenance of small cruising vessels, with\r\nnotes on the cost of upkeep, fitting out and laying up. Other matters\r\ndealt with in this section are the preservation of sails and gear, and\r\ninsurance.\r\n\r\nPart V., on seamanship, covers the handling of fore-and-aft vessels\r\nunder all conditions of weather, and upon every point of sailing.\r\n\r\nPart VI. covers the racing side of the sport in a comprehensive manner.\r\nAn exhaustive exposition of the International Sailing Rules is followed\r\nby hints on racing tactics. The appendix contains, _inter alia_, an\r\nillustrated description of the British Buoyage System.\r\n\r\nMr. Cooke's well-known handbooks have come to be regarded by yachtsmen\r\nas standard works, and a new and more ambitious work from his pen can\r\nhardly fail to interest them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF PROTECTION.\r\n\r\nBy BERNARD HOLLAND, C.B.,\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF \"IMPERIUM ET LIBERTAS.\"\r\n\r\n_One Volume. Demy 8vo._ =12s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\nThis volume is a political-historical study of the great change which\r\ntook place in British commercial and financial policy mainly between\r\nthe years 1840 and 1850. The writer examines the state of things in\r\nthese respects which existed before this revolution, and describes the\r\nprevious protective system, navigation system, and colonial system.\r\nHe then narrates the process by which those systems were overthrown,\r\ndevoting special attention to the character, career, and changes in\r\nopinion of Sir Robert Peel, and to the attitude and action of the Tory,\r\nWhig, and Radical parties, and of their leading men, especially Mr.\r\nDisraeli, Lord John Russell, and Mr. Cobden. He analyses with care\r\nthe arguments used on all sides in these controversies, especially\r\nwith regard to the Repeal of the Corn Laws, and he shows the extent to\r\nwhich questions of imperial preference and the relations between the\r\nUnited Kingdom and the Colonies entered into the issues. One chapter is\r\ndevoted to the Bank Act of 1844, and to the consideration of its causes\r\nand results. The author concludes by tracing very briefly the chain of\r\nevents which connect the period in question with our own day, in respect\r\nof commercial and fiscal policy, and expresses his own views as to\r\nexisting tendencies and future developments.\r\n\r\nMr. Bernard Holland is known as the author of the Life of the Duke\r\nof Devonshire, and of \"Imperium et Libertas.\" In a sense the present\r\nvolume is a continuation of the latter book, or rather is an attempt to\r\ndeal more expansively and in detail with certain history and questions\r\nconnected with the same theme, for the full treatment of which there was\r\ninsufficient space in that book. Mr. Holland having acted for a number\r\nof years as Private Secretary to two successive Secretaries of State for\r\nthe Colonies, has been brought into close touch in a practical way with\r\ncolonial questions. This book, it is hoped, will be of some service both\r\nto students of economic history and to politicians in active life.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINTING IN THE FAR EAST.\r\n\r\nBy LAURENCE BINYON.\r\n\r\n_A New Edition, thoroughly Revised, with many new and additional\r\nIllustrations. Crown 4to._ =21s. net.=\r\n\r\nSince the first edition of this book was published in 1907, much has\r\nhappened, and a quantity of new material has been brought to light.\r\n\r\nInterest in the subject has been immensely widened and strengthened.\r\nThe museums of Europe and America are vying with each other to procure\r\nfine specimens of Chinese and Japanese art. The opening this autumn of\r\na new museum at Cologne, exclusively devoted to the arts of Eastern\r\nAsia, is a symptom of the times. Collections, public and private, both\r\nEuropean and American, have been greatly enriched; and the exhibition in\r\n1910 at Shepherd's Bush, of treasured masterpieces lent from Japanese\r\ncollections, has provided a standard for the student.\r\n\r\nSix years ago, again, scarcely any of the voluminous literature of art\r\nexisting in Chinese and Japanese had been translated. On this side, too,\r\nan added store of information has been made accessible, though still in\r\ngreat part scattered in the pages of learned periodicals. Above all,\r\nthe marvellous discoveries made of recent years in China and Chinese\r\nTurkestan have substituted a mass of authentic material for groping\r\nconjectures in the study of the art of the early periods.\r\n\r\nIn preparing a new edition of this book and bringing it up to date,\r\nMr. Binyon has therefore been able to utilize a variety of new sources\r\nof information. The estimates given of the art of some of the most\r\nfamous of the older masters have been reconsidered. The sections\r\ndealing with the early art have been in great measure rewritten; and\r\nthe book has been revised throughout. In the matter of illustrations it\r\nhas been possible to draw on a wider range and make a fuller and more\r\nrepresentative selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINTING IN EAST AND WEST.\r\n\r\nBy ROBERT DOUGLAS NORTON,\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF \"THE CHOICE.\"\r\n\r\n_Crown 8vo._ =5s. net.=\r\n\r\nThe art of painting, which in the days of Gothic church-building\r\ncontributed so much both to the education and the pleasure of the\r\ncommunity at large, has admittedly come to appeal to ever-narrowing\r\ncircles, until to-day it cannot be said to play any part in popular\r\nlife at all. This book seeks to discover the causes of its decline\r\nin influence. A brief review of the chief contemporary movements in\r\npainting gives point to a suggestion made by more than one thoughtful\r\ncritic that the chief need of Western painting is spirituality.\r\nSince this is a quality which those competent to judge are at one in\r\nattributing to Eastern art, the author, in a chapter on Far Eastern\r\nPainting, sets forth the ideals underlying the great painting of China\r\nand Japan, and contrasts these ideals with those which have inspired\r\npainters and public in the West. This leads to an inquiry into the\r\nuses of imagination and suggestion in art, and to an attempt to find a\r\nbroad enough definition for \"spirituality\" not to exclude many widely\r\ndivergent achievements of Western painting. Finally, the possibility of\r\ntraining the sense of beauty is discussed in the light of successful\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nIncidentally the book touches on many questions which, though of\r\ninterest to picture-lovers, often remain unasked; such, for instance,\r\nas what we look for in a picture; how far subject is important; why it\r\nmay happen that the interest of one picture, which pleases at first,\r\nsoon wanes, while that of another grows steadily stronger; the value of\r\ntechnique, of different media of expression, of mere resemblance, etc.\r\n\r\nWithout going into the technicalities of aesthetics, the author aims at\r\ninvestigating certain first principles which are overlooked at times by\r\npossessors of even the widest knowledge of individual schools.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAKESPEARE'S STORIES.\r\n\r\nBy CONSTANCE MAUD and MARY MAUD.\r\n\r\nAS YOU LIKE IT--THE TEMPEST--KING LEAR--TWELFTH NIGHT--THE MERCHANT OF\r\nVENICE--A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM--MACBETH--HAMLET--ROMEO AND JULIET.\r\n\r\n_With Illustrations from the famous Boydell prints. Crown 8vo._\r\n\r\n=5s. net.=\r\n\r\nMiss Constance Maud is the author of \"Wagner's Heroes\" and \"Wagner's\r\nHeroines,\" two books on similar lines to these tales which have had a\r\ngreat vogue among young people of all ages. In the present volume she\r\ntells the charming stories of nine of the most famous of Shakespeare's\r\nTragedies and Comedies in prose of delightful and unstudied simplicity.\r\nOn occasion the actual text has been used for familiar passages and\r\nphrases. These great world-tales, regarded merely as tales, with the\r\nelemental motives and passions displayed in them, appeal strongly to the\r\nimagination, and when narrated by a competent pen there cannot be finer\r\nor more absorbing reading. In addition to this, he must be a dull reader\r\nin whom they do not awaken a desire to make a closer acquaintance with\r\nthe plays themselves.\r\n\r\nThe book forms a companion volume to Sir A. T. Quiller-Couch's\r\nwell-known \"Historical Tales from Shakespeare.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUSE IN MOTLEY.\r\n\r\nBy HARRY GRAHAM.\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF \"RUTHLESS RHYMES FOR HEARTLESS HOMES,\" ETC., ETC.\r\n\r\n_With 24 Illustrations by_\r\n\r\nLEWIS BAUMER.\r\n\r\n_Fcap. 4to._ =3s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\nAll lovers of humorous verse will welcome a fresh volume of lyrics by\r\nthe author of \"Deportmental Ditties,\" \"Canned Classics,\" and other\r\ndeservedly popular products of the Minor Muse. Readers of Captain\r\nGraham's new collection of light verse will agree with the _Daily\r\nChronicle_ in describing its author as \"a godsend, a treasure trove, a\r\nmessenger from Olympus; a man who really does see the ludicrous side of\r\nlife, a man who is a genuine humorist.\" Once again the author of these\r\namusing poems attempts to \"shoot Folly as she flies,\" and genially\r\nsatirizes the foibles of the age in a fashion that will certainly add\r\nto his reputation as a humorist; and his work is rendered still more\r\ndelightful by the drawings of Mr. Lewis Baumer, the well-known _Punch_\r\nartist, with which it is lavishly illustrated. \"It is a great and good\r\nthing,\" as the _Pall Mall Gazette_ remarked with reference to another\r\nof Captain Graham's books, \"to have a man among us who is witty all the\r\ntime and lets himself go. We ought to be duly thankful. And we are!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHANNIBAL ONCE MORE.\r\n\r\nBy DOUGLAS W. FRESHFIELD, M.A.,\r\n\r\nVICE-PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY; TREASURER OF THE\r\nHELLENIC AND ROMAN SOCIETIES; FORMERLY PRESIDENT OF THE ALPINE CLUB.\r\n\r\n_8vo._ =5s. net.=\r\n\r\nIn this little volume Mr. Freshfield has put into final shape the\r\nresults of his study of the famous and still-debated question: \"By which\r\nPass did Hannibal cross the Alps?\" The literature which has grown up\r\nround this intricate subject is surprisingly extensive, and various\r\nsolutions have been propounded and upheld, with remarkable warmth and\r\ntenacity, by a host of scholars, historians, geographers, military men,\r\nand mountaineers. Mr. Freshfieid has a solution of his own, which,\r\nhowever, he puts forward in no dogmatic spirit, but in such a fashion\r\nthat his book is practically a lucid review of the whole matter in each\r\nof its many aspects. To an extensive acquaintance with ancient and\r\nmodern geographical literature he unites a wide and varied experience as\r\nan alpine climber and a traveller, and a minute topographical knowledge\r\nof the regions under discussion; and these qualifications--in which many\r\nof his predecessors in the same field of inquiry have been conspicuously\r\nlacking--enable him to throw much new light on a perennially fascinating\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PASTORAL TEACHING OF ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\nBy the Rev. Canon H. L. GOUDGE,\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL OF THE THEOLOGICAL COLLEGE, ELY; AUTHOR OF \"THE MIND OF ST.\r\nPAUL,\" ETC.\r\n\r\n_Crown 8vo. Cloth._ =2s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\nThese lectures were delivered at the end of May, 1913, at the Palace,\r\nGloucester, to the clergy of the diocese, and are now published in\r\nresponse to the request of those who heard them. They do not constitute\r\na detailed commentary on the Pastoral Epistles, though a good deal of\r\ndetailed exegesis necessarily finds a place in them. The writer's aim\r\nhas been to collect and arrange St. Paul's teaching as to the work of\r\nthe Christian pastor, and to point out its applicability to modern\r\nconditions and modern difficulties. The writer has often found, through\r\nhis experience in conducting Retreats, that the Pastoral Teaching of\r\nSt. Paul is of the greatest value to the clergy to-day, but that this\r\nteaching is often obscured by the unsystematic character of St. Paul's\r\nwriting and by the passing controversies with which he has to deal. In\r\nthese lectures the First Epistle to Timothy is used as the basis, but\r\ncontinually illustrated by passages from the other Pastoral Epistles,\r\nand from St. Paul's earlier writings. The first lecture deals with the\r\npastor's aim, the second with the pastor's character, the third with\r\nthe pastor's work, and the fourth with the adaptation of his message to\r\nmen and to women, to old and to young, to rich and to poor. The ground\r\nalready covered by the writer's earlier book, \"The Mind of St. Paul,\"\r\nhas been carefully avoided, but it is hoped that the one book may throw\r\nlight upon the other. An index of texts has been added for those who\r\nmay wish to use this second book, as far as that is possible, as a\r\ncommentary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_NEW NOVELS_\r\n\r\nSOMETHING AFAR.\r\n\r\nBy MAXWELL GRAY,\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF \"THE SILENCE OF DEAN MAITLAND,\" \"THE GREAT REFUSAL,\" ETC.\r\n\r\n_Crown 8vo. Cloth._ =6s.=\r\n\r\nThe scene of Maxwell Gray's new story is laid in London and in Italy,\r\nwhere the gradual unfolding of an elaborate but absorbing plot holds\r\nthe reader's attention until the very last page of the book. This is a\r\ntale of heroism, of self-sacrifice, of romance, full of incident and\r\nadventure, illumined by those tender and imaginative touches, that vivid\r\nportrayal of character, which the public has learnt to expect from\r\nthe author of \"The Silence of Dean Maitland.\" From these pages we may\r\nlearn that there is \"something afar from the sphere of our sorrow,\" the\r\nhighest aspiration of the lover, the artist, the poet and the saint,\r\nwhich, beautiful beyond all that man's heart can divine, is yet within\r\nthe reach of every one of us.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENTLE LOVER.\r\n\r\nA Comedy of Middle Age.\r\n\r\nBy FORREST REID,\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF \"THE BRACKNELLS,\" \"FOLLOWING DARKNESS,\" ETC.\r\n\r\n_Crown 8vo._ =6s.=\r\n\r\nThis extremely interesting story, of which the title gives a most apt\r\ndescription, is written in a lighter vein than the author's previous\r\nwork. It is a love story, and while the tale itself is enthralling,\r\nit depends in great measure for its charm on the attractiveness of\r\nthe characters who figure in the drama and who are all very pleasant\r\ncompany. The book is essentially human, the note is never forced, yet\r\nthe interest goes on increasing right up to the end. It is actual life\r\nwith its comedy and tragedy so closely intermingled that it is not\r\nalways easy to distinguish one from the other. The scene is laid abroad,\r\npartly in Bruges, and partly in Italy, but the characters are, with one\r\nor two exceptions, natives of that part of Ireland with which the author\r\nis most familiar, and they lose none of their individuality by being\r\ntransplanted to those beautiful old-world cities where we follow their\r\nvaried fortunes. Mr. Reid's previous novels have already secured for\r\nhis work the warm appreciation of some of the best judges of literary\r\nvalues, and the present novel may be confidently stated to exhibit his\r\nundoubted power as a writer of fiction in an advanced and progressive\r\nstage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_NEW SCIENTIFIC WORKS_\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL POISONING\r\n\r\nFrom Fumes, Gases, and Poisons of Manufacturing Processes.\r\n\r\nBy Dr. J.

(Lond.), D.P.H.\r\n\r\n_Illustrated, xii + 340 pp. Demy 8vo._ =10s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\nIn this work Sir John Collie, whose wide experience has eminently fitted\r\nhim for the task, has given an interesting and lucid description of the\r\nmethods and peculiarities of the malingerer. He describes fully and in\r\ndetail the methods of examination for the detection of malingering and\r\nthe diseases usually simulated, and discusses the attitude required by\r\nthe medical attendant towards unduly prolonged illness.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD AGE:\r\n\r\nIts Care and Treatment in Health and Disease.\r\n\r\nBy ROBERT SAUNDBY, M.D., F.R.C.P., LL.D., J.P.,\r\n\r\nMEMBER GENERAL MEDICAL COUNCIL; EX-PRESIDENT BRITISH MEDICAL\r\nASSOCIATION; PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM; PHYSICIAN\r\nTO THE BIRMINGHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\n_320 pp._ =7s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\nNo English writer having recently dealt with this subject, it has\r\nbeen felt that there is room for a book which should bring together\r\nthe various contributions made to it in modern times, including the\r\nresults of the author's extensive experience during forty years of\r\nmedical practice. The author discusses the principles of health, by\r\ndue attention to which healthy old age may be attained. The diseases\r\nto which the aged are especially liable are fully described, their\r\ncauses are clearly indicated, and the author shows in a practical way\r\nby what means they may be avoided and how they may be appropriately\r\ntreated. Special attention is given to such important subjects as\r\ndiet, exercise, etc. Suggestive dietary tables are given, both for\r\nuse in health and in particular diseases, while the chapters devoted\r\nto methods of exercise most suitable in advanced age will also prove\r\nof value.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLONDON: EDWARD ARNOLD, 41 & 43 MADDOX STREET, W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n    |                                                              |\r\n    |       Transcriber notes:                                     |\r\n    |                                                              |\r\n    | P.30.
