While business\r\nmen and industrial leaders bewailed the mischance that had brought into\r\npower a man whose attitude towards vested interests was reputed none too\r\nfriendly, they looked upon him as a temporary inconvenience. Nor did the\r\nincreasingly large body of independent voters, disgusted by the\r\n\"stand-pattism\" of the Republican machine, regard Wilson much more\r\nseriously; rather did they place their confidence in a reinvigoration of\r\nthe Grand Old Party through the progressive leadership of Roosevelt,\r\nwhose enthusiasm and practical vision had attracted the approval of more\r\nthan four million voters in the preceding election, despite his lack of\r\nan adequate political organization. Even those who supported Wilson most\r\nwhole-heartedly believed that his work would lie entirely within the\r\nfield of domestic reform; little did they imagine that he would play a\r\npart in world affairs larger than had fallen to any citizen of the United\r\nStates since the birth of the country.\r\n\r\nThe new President was fifty-six years old. His background was primarily\r\nacademic, a fact which, together with his Scotch-Irish ancestry, the\r\nPresbyterian tradition of his family, and his early years spent in the\r\nSouth, explains much in his character at the time when he entered upon\r\nthe general political stage. After graduating from Princeton in 1879,\r\nwhere his career gave little indication of extraordinary promise, he\r\nstudied law, and for a time his shingle hung out in Atlanta. He seemed\r\nunfitted by nature, however, for either pleasure or success in the\r\npractice of the law. Reserved and cold, except with his intimates, he was\r\nincapable of attracting clients in a profession and locality where\r\nability to \"mix\" was a prime qualification. A certain lack of tolerance\r\nfor the failings of his fellow mortals may have combined with his\r\nPresbyterian conscience to disgust him with the hard give-and-take of the\r\nstruggling lawyer's life. He sought escape in graduate work in history\r\nand politics at Johns Hopkins, where, in 1886, he received his Ph.D. for\r\na thesis entitled _Congressional Government_, a study remarkable for\r\nclear thinking and felicitous expression. These qualities characterized\r\nhis work as a professor at Bryn Mawr and Wesleyan and paved his path to\r\nan appointment on the Princeton faculty in 1890, as Professor of\r\nJurisprudence and Politics.\r\n\r\nDespite his early distaste to the career of practicing lawyer, Wilson was\r\nby no means the man to bury himself in academic research. He lacked the\r\nscrupulous patience and the willingness to submerge his own personality\r\nwhich are characteristic of the scientific scholar. His gift was for\r\ngeneralization, and his writings were marked by clarity of thought and\r\nwealth of phrase, rather than by profundity. But such qualities brought\r\nhim remarkable success as a lecturer and essayist, and constant practice\r\ngave him a fluency, a vocal control, and a power of verbal expression\r\nwhich assured distinction at the frequent public meetings and dinners\r\nwhere he was called upon to speak. Professional interest in the science\r\nof government furnished him with topics of far wider import than the\r\nordinary pedagogue cares to handle, and he became, even as professor,\r\nwell known outside of Princeton. His influence, already broad in the\r\neducational and not without some recognition in the political world, was\r\nextended in 1902, when he was chosen President of the University.\r\n\r\nDuring the succeeding eight years Wilson enjoyed his first taste of\r\nexecutive power, and certain traits which he then displayed deserve brief\r\nnotice. Although a \"conservative\" in his advocacy of the maintenance of\r\nthe old-time curriculum, based upon the ancient languages and mathematics,\r\nand in his opposition to the free elective system, he proved an inflexible\r\nreformer as regards methods of instruction, the efficiency of which he was\r\ndetermined to establish. He showed a ruthless resolution to eliminate what\r\nhe looked upon as undemocratic social habits among the undergraduates, and\r\ndid not hesitate to cut loose from tradition, regardless of the prejudice\r\nthereby aroused against him. As an executive he evoked intense admiration\r\nand virulent dislike; the Board of Trustees and the alumni body were alike\r\ndivided between enthusiastic support and bitter anathematization of the\r\nmeasures he proposed. What seems obvious is that many graduates\r\nsympathized with his purposes but were alienated by his methods. His\r\nstrength lay chiefly in the force of his appeal to democratic sentiment;\r\nhis weakness in complete inability to conciliate opponents.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the issue of the struggle at Princeton was still\r\nundecided, opportunity was given Wilson to enter political life; an\r\nambition for such a career had evidently stirred him in early days and\r\nwas doubtless resuscitated by his success as a public speaker. While\r\nPresident of Princeton he had frequently touched upon public issues, and\r\nso early as 1906 Colonel George Harvey had mentioned him as a possible\r\nPresident of the United States. From that time he was often considered as\r\navailable for political office, and in 1910, with New Jersey stirred by a\r\nstrong popular movement against boss-rule, he was tendered the nomination\r\nfor Governor of that State. He accepted and proved an ideal candidate.\r\nThough supported by the Democratic machine, which planned to elect a\r\nreformer and then control him, Wilson won the adherence of independents\r\nand progressive Republicans by his promise to break the power of the boss\r\nsystem, and by the clarity of his plans for reform. His appeals to the\r\nspirit of democracy and morality, while they voiced nothing new in an\r\nelectoral campaign, rang with unusual strength and sincerity. The State,\r\nwhich had gone Republican by eighty-two thousand two years before, now\r\nelected Wilson its Governor by a plurality of forty-nine thousand.\r\n\r\nHe retained office in New Jersey for only two years. During that period he\r\nachieved a high degree of success. Had he served longer it is impossible\r\nto say what might have been his ultimate position, for as at Princeton,\r\nelements of opposition had begun to coalesce against him and he had found\r\nno means to disarm them. As Governor, he at once declared himself head of\r\nthe party and by a display of firm activity dominated the machine. The\r\nDemocratic boss, Senator James Smith, was sternly enjoined from seeking\r\nreëlection to the Senate, and when, in defiance of promises and the wish\r\nof the voters as expressed at the primaries, he attempted to run, Wilson\r\nentered the lists and so influenced public opinion and the Legislature\r\nthat the head of the machine received only four votes. Attempts of the\r\nDemocratic machine to combine with the Republicans, in order to nullify\r\nthe reforms which Wilson had promised in his campaign, proved equally\r\nfutile. With strong popular support, constantly exercising his influence\r\nboth in party conferences and on the Legislature, the Governor was able to\r\ntranslate into law the most important of the measures demanded by the\r\nprogressives. He himself summed up the essence of the situation when he\r\nsaid: \"The moment the forces in New Jersey that had resisted reform\r\nrealized that the people were backing new men who meant what they had\r\nsaid, they realized that they dare not resist them. It was not the\r\npersonal force of the new officials; it was the moral strength of their\r\nbacking that accomplished the extraordinary result.\" Supreme confidence in\r\nthe force of public opinion exerted by the common man characterizes much\r\nof Wilson's political philosophy, and the position in the world which he\r\nwas to enjoy for some months towards the end of the war rested upon the\r\nsame basis.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 came the presidential election. The split in the Republican\r\nforces promised if it did not absolutely guarantee the election of a\r\nDemocrat, and when the party convention met at Baltimore in June,\r\nexcitement was more than ordinarily intense. The conservative elements in\r\nthe party were divided. The radicals looked to Bryan for leadership,\r\nalthough his nomination seemed out of the question. Wilson had stamped\r\nhimself as an anti-machine progressive, and if the machine conservatives\r\nthreatened he might hope for support from the Nebraskan orator. From the\r\nfirst the real contest appeared to be between Wilson and Champ Clark, who\r\nalthough hardly a conservative, was backed for the moment by the machine\r\nleaders. The deciding power was in Bryan's hand, and as the strife\r\nbetween conservatives and radicals waxed hot, he turned to the support of\r\nWilson. On the forty-sixth ballot Wilson was nominated. With division in\r\nthe Republican ranks, with his record in New Jersey for legislative\r\naccomplishment, and winning many independent votes through a succession\r\nof effective campaign speeches, Wilson more than fulfilled the highest of\r\nDemocratic hopes. He received on election day only a minority of all the\r\nvotes cast, but his majority in the electoral college was overwhelming.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe personality of an American President has seldom undergone so much\r\nanalysis with such unsatisfactory results; almost every discussion of\r\nWilson's characteristics leads to the generation of heat rather than\r\nlight. Indeed the historian of the future may ask whether it is as\r\nimportant, in this age of democracy, to know exactly what sort of man he\r\nwas as to know what the people thought he was. And yet in the case of a\r\nstatesman who was to play a rôle of supreme importance in the affairs of\r\nthe country and the world, it is perhaps more than a matter of merely\r\npersonal interest to underline his salient traits. Let it be premised\r\nthat a logical and satisfactory analysis is well-nigh impossible, for his\r\nnature is self-contradictory, subject to gusts of temperament, and he\r\nhimself has pictured the struggle that has gone on between the impulsive\r\nIrish and the cautious Scotch elements in him. Thus it is that he has\r\nhandled similar problems in different ways at different times, and has\r\nproduced upon different persons diametrically opposed impressions.\r\n\r\nAs an executive, perhaps his most notable characteristic is the will to\r\ndominate. This does not mean that he is the egocentric autocrat pictured\r\nby his opponents, for in conference he is apt to be tolerant of the\r\nopinions of others, by no means dictatorial in manner, and apparently\r\nanxious to obtain facts on both sides of the argument. An unfriendly\r\ncritic, Mr. E. J. Dillon, has said of him at Paris that \"he was a very\r\ngood listener, an intelligent questioner, and amenable to argument\r\nwhenever he felt free to give practical effect to his conclusions.\"\r\nSimilar evidence has been offered by members of his Cabinet. But\r\nunquestionably, in reaching a conclusion he resents pressure and he\r\npermits no one to make up his mind for him; he is, said the German\r\nAmbassador, \"a recluse and lonely worker.\" One of his enthusiastic\r\nadmirers has written: \"Once in possession of every fact in the case, the\r\nPresident withdraws, commences the business of consideration, comparison,\r\nand assessment, and then emerges with a decision.\" From such a decision\r\nit is difficult to shake him and continued opposition serves merely to\r\nstiffen his resolution. Wherever the responsibility is his, he insists\r\nupon the finality of his judgment. Those who have worked with him have\r\nremarked upon his eagerness, once he has decided a course of action, to\r\ncarry it into practical effect. The President of the Czecho-Slovak\r\nRepublic, Thomas G. Masaryk, said that of all the men he had met, \"your\r\nvisionary, idealistic President is by far and away the most intensely\r\npractical.\" One of the Big Four at Paris remarked: \"Wilson works. The\r\nrest of us play, comparatively speaking. We Europeans can't keep up with\r\na man who travels a straight path with such a swift stride, never looking\r\nto right or left.\" But with all his eagerness for practical effect he is\r\nnotably less efficient in the execution than in the formation of\r\npolicies.\r\n\r\nWilson lacks, furthermore, the power of quick decision which is apt to\r\ncharacterize the masterful executive. He is slow to make up his mind, a\r\ntrait that results partly, perhaps, from his Scotch blood and partly from\r\nhis academic training. Except for his steadfast adherence to what he\r\nregards as basic principles, he might rightly be termed an opportunist.\r\nFor he is prone to temporize, anxious to prevent an issue from approaching\r\na crisis, evidently in the hope that something may \"turn up\" to improve\r\nthe situation and obviate the necessity of conflict. \"Watchful waiting\" in\r\nthe Mexican crises and his attitude towards the belligerents during the\r\nfirst two years of the European war are cases in point. There are\r\ninstances of impulsive action on his part, when he has not waited for\r\nadvice or troubled to acquire exact knowledge of the facts underlying a\r\nsituation, but such occasions have been infrequent.\r\n\r\nWilson's dislike of advice has been widely advertized. It is probably\r\ncloser to the truth to say that he is naturally suspicious of advisers\r\nunless he is certain that their basic point of view is the same as his\r\nown. This is quite different from saying that he wants only opinions that\r\ncoincide with his own and that he immediately dispenses with advisers who\r\ndisagree with him. Colonel House, for example, who for five years exerted\r\nconstant influence on his policy, frequently advanced opinions quite at\r\nvariance from those of the President, but such differences did not weaken\r\nHouse's influence inasmuch as Wilson felt that they were both starting\r\nfrom the same angle towards the same point. Prejudiced though he seemed\r\nto be against \"financiers,\" Wilson took the opinions of Thomas W. Lamont\r\nat Paris, because the underlying object of both, the acquisition of a\r\nsecure peace, was identical. It is true, however, that with the exception\r\nof Colonel House, Wilson's advisers have been in the main purveyors of\r\nfacts rather than colleagues in the formation of policies. Wilson has\r\ngenerally been anxious to receive facts which might help him to build his\r\npolicy, as will be attested by those who worked with him at Paris.[1] But\r\nhe was less interested in the opinions of his advisers, especially when\r\nit came to principles and not details, for he decides principles for\r\nhimself. In this sense his Cabinet was composed of subordinates rather\r\nthan counselors. Such an attitude is, of course, characteristic of most\r\nmodern executives and has been intensified by war conditions. The summary\r\ndisregard of Lansing, shown by Wilson at Paris, was less striking than\r\nthe snubbing of Balfour by Lloyd George, or the cold brutality with which\r\nClemenceau treated the other French delegates.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Lamont says of the President at Paris: \"I never saw a\r\nman more ready and anxious to consult than he.... President Wilson did\r\nnot have a well-organized secretarial staff. He did far too much of the\r\nwork himself, studying until late at night papers and documents that he\r\nshould have largely delegated to some discreet aides. He was by all odds,\r\nthe hardest worked man at the Conference; but the failure to delegate\r\nmore of his work was not due to any inherent distrust that he had of\r\nmen--and certainly not to any desire to 'run the whole show' himself--but\r\nsimply to the lack of facility in knowing how to delegate work on a large\r\nscale. In execution we all have a blind spot in some part of our eye.\r\nPresident Wilson's was in his inability to use men; an inability, mind\r\nyou, not a refusal. On the contrary, when any of us volunteered or\r\ninsisted upon taking responsibility off his shoulders he was delighted.\"]\r\n\r\nGeneral conviction of Wilson's autocratic nature has been intensified by\r\nhis choice of assistants, who have not as a rule enjoyed public\r\nconfidence. He debarred himself from success in the matter of\r\nappointments, in the first place, by limiting his range of choice through\r\nunwillingness to have about him those who did not share his point of\r\nview. It is more epigrammatic than exact to say that he was the sole unit\r\nin the Government giving value to a row of ciphers, for his Cabinet, as\r\na whole, was not composed of weak men. But the fact that the members of\r\nhis Cabinet accepted implicitly his firm creed that the Cabinet ought to\r\nbe an executive and not a political council, that it depended upon the\r\nPresident's policy, and that its main function should be merely to carry\r\nthat policy into effect, gave to the public some justification for its\r\nbelief that Wilson's was a \"one-man\" Government. This belief was further\r\nintensified by the President's extreme sensitiveness to hostile\r\ncriticism, which more than anything else hindered frank interchange of\r\nopinion between himself and strong personalities. On more than one\r\noccasion he seemed to regard opposition as tantamount to personal\r\nhostility, an attitude which at times was not entirely unjustified. In\r\nthe matter of minor appointments Wilson failed generally of success\r\nbecause he consistently refused to take a personal interest, leaving them\r\nto subordinates and admitting that political necessities must go far to\r\ndetermine the choice. Even in such an important problem as the\r\nappointment of the Peace Commission the President seems to have made his\r\nselection almost at haphazard. Many of his war appointments proved\r\nultimately to be wise. But it is noteworthy that such men as Garfield,\r\nBaruch, and McCormick, who amply justified their choice, were appointed\r\nbecause Wilson knew personally their capacity and not because of previous\r\nsuccess along special lines which would entitle them to public\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nThe obstinacy of the President has become proverbial. The square chin,\r\nunconsciously protruded in argument, indicates definitely his capacity,\r\nas a British critic has put it, \"to dig his toes in and hold on.\" On\r\nmatters of method, however, where a basic principle is not involved, he\r\nis flexible. According as you approve or disapprove of him, he is\r\n\"capable of development\" or \"inconsistent.\" Thus he completely changed\r\nfront on the question of preparedness from 1914 to 1916. When the\r\nquestion of the initiative and referendum arose in Oregon, his attitude\r\nwas the reverse of what it had been as professor of politics. When\r\nmatters of detail are under discussion, he has displayed much willingness\r\nfor and some skill in compromise, as was abundantly illustrated at Paris.\r\nBut when he thinks that a principle is at stake, he prefers to accept any\r\nconsequences, no matter how disastrous to his policy; witness his refusal\r\nto accept the Lodge reservation on Article X of the League Covenant.\r\n\r\nAll those included within the small circle of Wilson's intimates attest\r\nthe charm and magnetism of his personality. The breadth of his reading is\r\nreflected in his conversation, which is enlivened by anecdotes that\r\nillustrate his points effectively and illumined by a sense of humor which\r\nsome of his friends regard as his most salient trait. His manner is\r\nmarked by extreme courtesy and, in view of the fixity of his opinions, a\r\nsurprising lack of abruptness or dogmatism. But he has never been able to\r\ncapitalize such personal advantages in his political relations. Apart\r\nfrom his intimates he is shy and reserved. The antithesis of Roosevelt,\r\nwho loved to meet new individualities, Wilson has the college professor's\r\nshrinking from social contacts, and is not at ease in the presence of\r\nthose with whom he is not familiar. Naturally, therefore, he lacks\r\ncompletely Roosevelt's capacity to make friends, and there is in him no\r\ntrace of his predecessor's power to find exactly the right compliment for\r\nthe right person. Under Roosevelt the White House opened its doors to\r\nevery one who could bring the President anything of interest, whether in\r\nthe field of science, literature, politics, or sport; and the Chief\r\nMagistrate, no matter who his guest, instantly found a common ground for\r\ndiscussion. That capacity Wilson did not possess. Furthermore his health\r\nwas precarious and he was physically incapable of carrying the burden of\r\nthe constant interviews that characterized the life of his immediate\r\npredecessors in the presidential office. He lived the life of a recluse\r\nand rarely received any one but friends of the family at the White House\r\ndinner table.\r\n\r\nWhile he thus saved himself from the social intercourse which for\r\nRoosevelt was a relaxation but which for him would have proved a nervous\r\nand physical drain, Wilson deprived himself of the political advantages\r\nthat might have been derived from more extensive hospitality. He was\r\nunable to influence Congressmen except by reason of his authority as head\r\nof the party or nation. He lost many a chance of removing political\r\nopposition through the personal appeal which is so flattering and\r\neffective. He seems to have thought that if his policy was right in\r\nitself, Congressmen ought to vote for it, without the satisfaction of\r\npersonal arguments, a singular misappreciation of human nature. The same\r\nwas true of his relations with the Washington correspondents; he was never\r\nable to establish a man to man basis of intercourse. This incapacity in\r\nthe vital matter of human contacts was, perhaps, his greatest political\r\nweakness. If he had been able to arouse warm personal devotion in his\r\nfollowers, if he could have inflamed them with enthusiasm such as that\r\ninspired by Roosevelt, rather than mere admiration, Wilson would have\r\nfound his political task immeasurably lightened. It is not surprising that\r\nhis mistakes in tactics should have been so numerous. His isolation and\r\ndependence upon tactical advisers, such as Tumulty and Burleson, lacking\r\nbroad vision, led him into serious errors, most of which--such as his\r\nappeal for a Democratic Congress in 1918, his selection of the personnel\r\nof the Peace Commission, his refusal to compromise with the \"mild\r\nreservationist Senators\" in the summer of 1919--were committed,\r\nsignificantly, when he was not in immediate contact with Colonel House.\r\n\r\nThe political strength of Wilson did not result primarily from\r\nintellectual power. His mind is neither profound nor subtle. His serious\r\nwritings are sound but not characterized by originality, nor in his\r\npolicies is there anything to indicate creative genius. He thinks straight\r\nand possesses the ability to concentrate on a single line of effort. He is\r\nskillful in catching an idea and adapting it to his purposes. Combined\r\nwith his power of expression and his talent for making phrases, such\r\nqualities were of great assistance to him. But the real strength of the\r\nPresident lay rather in his gift of sensing what the common people wanted\r\nand his ability to put it into words for them. Few of his speeches are\r\ngreat; many of them are marred by tactless phrases, such as \"too proud to\r\nfight\" and \"peace without victory.\" But nearly all of them express\r\nhonestly the desires of the masses. His strength in New Jersey and the\r\nextraordinary effect produced in Europe by his war speeches might be cited\r\nas evidence of this peculiar power. He sought above everything to catch\r\nthe trend of inarticulate rather than vociferous opinion. If one objects\r\nthat his patience under German outrages was not truly representative, we\r\nmust remember that opinion was slow in crystallizing, that his policy was\r\nendorsed by the election of 1916, and that when he finally advocated war\r\nin April, 1917, the country entered the struggle practically a unit.\r\n\r\nBut it is obvious that, however much political strength was assured the\r\nPresident by his instinctive appreciation of popular feeling, this was\r\nlargely offset by the _gaucherie_ of his political tactics. He had a genius\r\nfor alienating persons who should have supported him and who agreed in\r\ngeneral with the broad lines of his policies. Few men in public life have\r\nso thoroughly aroused the dislike of \"the man in the street.\" Admitting\r\nthat much of Wilson's unpopularity resulted from misunderstanding, from the\r\nfeeling that he was a different sort, perhaps a \"highbrow,\" the degree of\r\ndislike felt for him becomes almost inexplicable in the case of a President\r\nwho, from all the evidence, was willing to sacrifice everything for what he\r\nconsidered to be the benefit of the common man. He might almost repeat\r\nRobespierre's final bitter and puzzled phrase: \"To die for the people and\r\nto be abhorred by them.\" So keen was the irritation aroused by Wilson's\r\nmethods and personality that many a citizen stated frankly that he\r\npreferred to see Wilsonian policies which he approved meet defeat, rather\r\nthan see them carried to success by Wilson. This executive failing of the\r\nPresident was destined to jeopardize the greatest of his policies and to\r\nresult in the personal tragedy of Wilson himself.\r\n\r\nCertain large political principles stand out in Wilson's writings and\r\ncareer as Governor and President. Of these the most striking, perhaps, is\r\nhis conviction that the President of the United States must be something\r\nmore than a mere executive superintendent. The entire responsibility for\r\nthe administration of government, he believed, should rest upon the\r\nPresident, and in order to meet that responsibility, he must keep the\r\nreins of control in his own hands. In his first essays and in his later\r\nwritings Wilson expressed his disgust with the system of congressional\r\ncommittees which threw enormous power into the hands of irresponsible\r\nprofessional politicians, and called for a President who would break that\r\nsystem and exercise greater directive authority. For a time he seemed,\r\nunder the influence of Bagehot, to have believed in the feasibility of\r\nintroducing something like the parliamentary system into the government\r\nof the United States. To the last he regarded the President as a sort of\r\nPrime Minister, at the head of his party in the Legislature and able to\r\ncount absolutely upon its loyalty. More than this, he believed that the\r\nPresident should take a large share of responsibility for the legislative\r\nprogramme and ought to push this programme through by all means at his\r\ndisposal. Such a creed appeared in his early writings and was largely\r\ncarried into operation during his administration. We find him bringing\r\nall possible pressure upon the New Jersey Legislature in order to redeem\r\nhis campaign pledges. When elected President, he went directly to\r\nCongress with his message, instead of sending it to be read. Time and\r\nagain he intervened to forward his special legislative interests by\r\ndirect influence.\r\n\r\nBoth in his writings and in his actions Wilson has always advocated\r\ngovernment by party. Theoretically and in practice he has been opposed to\r\ncoalition government, for, in his belief, it divides responsibility.\r\nAlthough by no means an advocate of the old-type spoils system, rewards\r\nfor party service seem to him essential. Curiously enough, while\r\ninsisting that the President is the leader of his party like a Prime\r\nMinister, he has also described him, with an apparent lack of logic, as\r\nthe leader of the country. Because Wilson has thus confused party and\r\npeople, it is easy to understand why he has at times claimed to represent\r\nthe nation when, in reality, he was merely representing partisan views.\r\nSuch an attitude is naturally irritating to the Opposition and explains\r\nsomething of the virulence that characterized the attacks made upon him\r\nin 1918 and later.\r\n\r\nWilson's political sentiments are tinged by a constant and intense\r\ninterest in the common man. More than once he has insisted that it was\r\nmore important to know what was said by the fireside than what was said\r\nin the council chamber. His strongest political weapon, he believes, has\r\nbeen the appeal over the heads of politicians to public opinion. His\r\ndislike of cliques and his strong prejudice against anything that savors\r\nof special privilege shone clear in his attack upon the Princeton club\r\nsystem, and the same light has not infrequently dazzled his vision as\r\nPresident. Thus, while by no means a radical, he instinctively turned to\r\nthe support of labor in its struggles with capital because of the abuse\r\nof its privilege by capital in the past and regardless of more recent\r\nabuse of its power by labor. Similarly at the Peace Conference his\r\nsympathies were naturally with every weak state and every minority group.\r\n\r\nSuch tendencies may have been strengthened by the intensity of his\r\nreligious convictions. There have been few men holding high office in\r\nrecent times so deeply and constantly affected by Christian faith as\r\nWoodrow Wilson. The son of a clergyman and subjected during his early\r\nyears to the most lively and devout sort of Presbyterianism, he preserved\r\nin his own family circle, in later years, a similar atmosphere. Nor was\r\nhis conviction of the immanence and spiritual guidance of the Deity ever\r\ndivorced from his professional and public life. We can discover in his\r\npresidential speeches many indications of his belief that the duties he\r\nhad undertaken were laid upon him by God and that he might not deviate\r\nfrom what seemed to him the straight and appointed path. There is\r\nsomething reminiscent of Calvin in the stern and unswerving determination\r\nnot to compromise for the sake of ephemeral advantage. This aspect of\r\nWilson has been caught by a British critic, J. M. Keynes, who describes\r\nthe President as a Nonconformist minister, whose thought and temperament\r\nwere essentially theological, not intellectual, \"with all the strength\r\nand weakness of that manner of thought, feeling, and expression.\" The\r\nobservation is exact, although it does not in itself completely explain\r\nWilson. Certainly nothing could be more characteristic of the President\r\nthan the text of a Baccalaureate sermon which he preached at Princeton in\r\n1907: \"And be ye not conformed to this world.\" He believed with intensity\r\nthat each individual must set up for himself a moral standard, which he\r\nmust rigidly maintain regardless of the opinions of the community.\r\n\r\nEntirely natural, therefore, is the emphasis which he has placed, whether\r\nas President of Princeton or of the United States, upon moral rather\r\nthan material virtues. This, indeed, has been the essence of his\r\npolitical idealism. Such an emphasis has been for him at once a source of\r\npolitical strength and of weakness. The moralist unquestionably secures\r\nwide popular support; but he also wearies his audience, and many a voter\r\nhas turned from Wilson in the spirit that led the Athenian to vote for\r\nthe ostracism of Aristides, because he was tired of hearing him called\r\n\"the Just.\" Whatever the immediate political effects, the country owes to\r\nWilson a debt, which historians will doubtless acknowledge, for his\r\ninsistence that morality must go hand in hand with public policy, that as\r\nwith individuals, so with governments, true greatness is won by service\r\nrather than by acquisition, by sacrifice rather than by aggression.\r\nWilson and Treitschke are at opposite poles.\r\n\r\nDuring his academic career Wilson seems to have displayed little interest\r\nin foreign affairs, and his knowledge of European politics, although\r\nsufficient for him to produce an admirable handbook on governments,\r\nincluding foreign as well as our own, was probably not profound. During\r\nhis first year in the White House, he was typical of the Democratic\r\nparty, which then approved the political isolation of the United States,\r\nabhorred the kind of commercial imperialism summed up in the phrase\r\n\"dollar diplomacy,\" and apparently believed that the essence of foreign\r\npolicy was to keep one's own hands clean. The development of Wilson from\r\nthis parochial point of view to one which centers his whole being upon a\r\npolicy of unselfish international service, forms, to a large extent, the\r\nmain thread of the narrative which follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nNEUTRALITY\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite the wars and rumors of wars in Europe after 1910, few Americans\r\nperceived the gathering of the clouds, and probably not one in ten\r\nthousand felt more than an ordinary thrill of interest on the morning of\r\nJune 29, 1914, when they read that the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of\r\nAustria had been assassinated. Nor, a month later, when it became obvious\r\nthat the resulting crisis was to precipitate another war in the Balkans,\r\ndid most Americans realize that the world was hovering on the brink of\r\nmomentous events. Not even when the most dire forebodings were realized\r\nand the great powers of Europe were drawn into the quarrel, could America\r\nappreciate its significance. Crowds gazed upon the bulletin boards and\r\ntried to picture the steady advance of German field-gray through the\r\nstreets of Liège, asked their neighbors what were these French 75's, and\r\nendeavored to locate Mons and Verdun on inadequate maps. Interest could\r\nnot be more intense, but it was the interest of the moving-picture\r\ndevotee. Even the romantic voyage of the _Kronprinzessin Cecilie_ with\r\nher cargo of gold, seeking to elude the roving British cruisers, seemed\r\nmerely theatrical. It was a tremendous show and we were the spectators.\r\nOnly the closing of the Stock Exchange lent an air of reality to the\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\nIt was true that the Spanish War had made of the United States a world\r\npower, but so firmly rooted in American minds was the principle of\r\ncomplete political isolation from European affairs that the typical\r\ncitizen could not imagine any cataclysm on the other side of the Atlantic\r\nso engrossing as to engage the active participation of his country. The\r\nwhole course of American history had deepened the general feeling of\r\naloofness from Europe and heightened the effect of the advice given by\r\nthe first President when he warned the country to avoid entangling\r\nalliances. In the early nineteenth century the United States was a\r\ncountry apart, for in the days when there was neither steamship nor\r\ntelegraph the Atlantic in truth separated the New World from the Old.\r\nAfter the close of the \"second war of independence,\" in 1815, the\r\npossibility of foreign complications seemed remote. The attention of the\r\nyoung nation was directed to domestic concerns, to the building up of\r\nmanufactures, to the extension of the frontiers westward. The American\r\nnation turned its back to the Atlantic. There was a steady and welcome\r\nstream of immigrants from Europe, but there was little speculation or\r\ninterest as to its headwaters.\r\n\r\nGovernmental relations with European states were disturbed at times by\r\ncrises of greater or less importance. The proximity of the United States\r\nto and interest in Cuba compelled the Government to recognize the\r\npolitical existence of Spain; a French army was ordered out of Mexico\r\nwhen it was felt to be a menace; the presence of immigrant Irish in large\r\nnumbers always gave a note of uncertainty to the national attitude\r\ntowards Great Britain. The export of cotton from the Southern States\r\ncreated industrial relations of such importance with Great Britain that,\r\nduring the Civil War, after the establishment of the blockade on the\r\nConfederate coast, wisdom and forbearance were needed on both sides to\r\nprevent the breaking out of armed conflict. But during the last third of\r\nthe century, which was marked in this country by an extraordinary\r\nindustrial evolution and an increased interest in domestic\r\nadministrative issues, the attitude of the United States towards Europe,\r\nexcept during the brief Venezuelan crisis and the war with Spain, was\r\ngenerally characterized by the indifference which is the natural outcome\r\nof geographical separation.\r\n\r\nIn diplomatic language American foreign policy, so far as Europe was\r\nconcerned, was based upon the principle of \"non-intervention.\" The right\r\nto manage their affairs in their own way without interference was conceded\r\nto European Governments and a reciprocal attitude was expected of them.\r\nThe American Government followed strictly the purpose of not participating\r\nin any political arrangements made between European states regarding\r\nEuropean issues. Early in the life of the nation Jefferson had correlated\r\nthe double aspect of this policy: \"Our first and fundamental maxim,\" he\r\nsaid, \"should be never to entangle ourselves in the broils of Europe; our\r\nsecond, never to suffer Europe to intermeddle with cis-Atlantic affairs.\"\r\nThe influence of John Quincy Adams crystallized this double policy in the\r\nMonroe Doctrine, which, as compensation for denying to European states the\r\nright to intervene in American politics, sacrificed the generous\r\nsympathies of many Americans, among them President Monroe himself, with\r\nthe republican movements across the Atlantic. With the continued and\r\nincreasing importance of the Monroe Doctrine as a principle of national\r\npolicy, the natural and reciprocal aspect of that doctrine, implying\r\npolitical isolation from Europe, became more deeply imbedded in the\r\nnational consciousness.\r\n\r\nThere was, it is true, another aspect to American foreign policy besides\r\nthe European, namely, that concerning the Pacific and the Far East, which,\r\nas diplomatic historians have pointed out, does not seem to have been\r\naffected by the tradition of isolation. Since the day when the western\r\nfrontier was pushed to the Golden Gate, the United States has taken an\r\nactive interest in problems of the Pacific. Alaska was purchased from\r\nRussia. An American seaman was the first to open the trade of Japan to the\r\noutside world and thus precipitated the great revolution which has touched\r\nevery aspect of Far Eastern questions. American traders watched carefully\r\nthe commercial development of Oriental ports, in which Americans have\r\nplayed an active rôle. In China and in the maintenance of the open door\r\nespecially, has America taken the keenest interest. It is a matter of\r\npride that American policy, always of a purely commercial and peaceful\r\nnature, showed itself less aggressive than that of some European states.\r\nBut the Government insisted upon the recognition of American interest in\r\nevery Far Eastern issue that might be raised, and was ready to intervene\r\nwith those of Europe in moments of crisis or danger.\r\n\r\nA fairly clear-cut distinction might thus be made between American\r\npretensions in the different parts of the world. In the Americas the\r\nnation claimed that sort of preëminence which was implied by the Monroe\r\nDoctrine, a preëminence which as regards the Latin-American states north\r\nof the Orinoco many felt must be actively enforced, in view of special\r\ninterests in the Caribbean. In the Far East the United States claimed an\r\nequality of status with the European powers. In the rest of the world,\r\nEurope, Africa, the Levant, the traditional American policy of abstention\r\nheld good absolutely, at least until the close of the century.\r\n\r\nThe war with Spain affected American foreign policy vitally. The holding\r\nof the Philippines, even if it were to prove merely temporary, created new\r\nrelations with all the great powers, of Europe as of Asia; American\r\nCaribbean interests were strengthened; and the victory over a European\r\npower, even one of a second class in material strength, necessarily\r\naltered the traditional attitude of the nation towards the other states of\r\nEurope and theirs towards it. This change was stimulated by the close\r\nattention which American merchants and bankers began to give to European\r\ncombinations and policies, particularly to the exploitation of thinly\r\npopulated districts by European states. Even before the Spanish War a\r\nkeen-sighted student of foreign affairs, Richard Olney, had declared that\r\nthe American people could not assume an attitude of indifference towards\r\nEuropean politics and that the hegemony of a single continental state\r\nwould be disastrous to their prosperity if not to their safety. Conversely\r\nEuropeans began to watch America with greater care. The victory over Spain\r\nwas resented and the fear of American commercial development began to\r\nspread. The Kaiser had even talked of a continental customs union to meet\r\nAmerican competition. On the other hand, Great Britain, which had\r\ndisplayed a benevolent attitude during the Spanish War and whose admiral\r\nat Manila had perhaps blocked German interference, showed an increasing\r\ndesire for a close understanding. The friendship of the United States,\r\nitself once a British dependency, for the British colonies was natural\r\nand American interests in the Far East had much in common with those of\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nExternal evidence of the new place of the United States in the world might\r\nbe found in the position taken by Roosevelt as peacemaker between Russia\r\nand Japan, and, more significantly, in the rôle played by the American\r\nrepresentative, Henry White, at the Conference of Algeciras in 1906. Not\r\nmerely did the American Government consent to discuss matters essentially\r\nEuropean in character, but its attitude proved almost decisive in the\r\nsettlement then drafted. It is true that the Senate, in approving that\r\nsettlement, refused to assume responsibility for its maintenance and\r\nreiterated its adherence to traditional policy. But those who watched\r\ndevelopments with intelligent eyes must have agreed with Roosevelt when he\r\nsaid: \"We have no choice, we people of the United States, as to whether we\r\nshall play a great part in the affairs of the world. That has been decided\r\nfor us by fate, by the march of events.\" Yet it may be questioned whether\r\nthe average American, during the first decade of the twentieth century,\r\nrealized the change that had come over relations with Europe. The majority\r\nof citizens certainly felt that anything happening east of the Atlantic\r\nwas none of their business, just as everything that occurred in the\r\nAmericas was entirely outside the scope of European interference.\r\n\r\nThere is little to show that Woodrow Wilson, at the time when he entered\r\nupon his duties as President, was one of the few Americans who fully\r\nappreciated the new international position of the United States and its\r\nconsequences, even had there been no war. The Democratic platform of 1912\r\nhardly mentioned foreign policy, and Wilson's Inaugural contained no\r\nreference to anything except domestic matters. Certain problems inherited\r\nfrom the previous Administration forced upon the President, however, the\r\nformulation, if not of a policy, at least of an attitude. The questions of\r\nthe Panama Canal tolls and Japanese immigration, the Mexican situation,\r\nthe Philippines, general relations with Latin-America, all demanded\r\nattention. In each case Wilson displayed a willingness to sacrifice, a\r\ndesire to avoid stressing the material strength of the United States, an\r\nanxiety to compromise, which matched in spirit the finest traditions of\r\nAmerican foreign policy, which has generally been marked by high ideals.\r\nMany of his countrymen, possibly without adequate study or command of the\r\nfacts, supposed that Wilson was inspired less by positive ideals than by\r\nthe belief that no problem of a foreign nature was worth a quarrel. People\r\nliked the principle contained in the sentence: \"We can afford to exercise\r\nthe self-restraint of a really great nation which realizes its own\r\nstrength and scorns to misuse it.\" But they also wondered whether the\r\npassivity of the Government did not in part proceed from the fact that the\r\nPresident could not make up his mind what he wanted to do. They looked\r\nupon his handling of the Mexican situation as clear evidence of a lack of\r\npolicy. Nevertheless the country as a whole, without expressing enthusiasm\r\nfor Wilson's attitude, was obviously pleased by his attempts to avoid\r\nforeign entanglements, and in the early summer of 1914 the eyes of the\r\nnation were focused upon domestic issues.\r\n\r\nThen came the war in Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nToday, after the long years of stress and struggle in which the crimes of\r\nGermany have received full advertisement, few Americans will admit that\r\nthey did not perceive during that first week of August, 1914, the\r\ncomplete significance of the moral issues involved in the European war.\r\nThey read back into their thoughts of those early days the realization\r\nwhich, in truth, came only later, that Germany was the brutal aggressor\r\nattacking those aspects of modern civilization which are dear to America.\r\nIn fact there were not many then who grasped the essential truth that the\r\ncause defended by Great Britain and France was indeed that of America and\r\nthat their defeat would bring the United States face to face with vital\r\ndanger, both material and moral.\r\n\r\nPartisanship, of course, was not lacking and frequently it was of an\r\nearnest kind; in view of the large number of European-born who enjoyed\r\ncitizenship, sympathy with one side or the other was inevitably warm.\r\nWest of the Mississippi it was some time before the masses were stirred\r\nfrom their indifference to and their ignorance of the struggle. But on\r\nthe Atlantic seaboard and in the Middle West opinion became sharply\r\ndivided. The middle-class German-Americans naturally espoused with some\r\nvehemence the justice of the Fatherland's cause. German intellectuals of\r\ninfluence, such as Hugo Münsterberg, inveighed against the hypocrisy and\r\nthe decadence of the Entente powers. Many Americans who had lived or had\r\nbeen educated in Germany, some professors who had been brought into\r\ncontact with the Kaiser explained the \"essentially defensive character\"\r\nof Germany's struggle against the threatening Slav. Certain of the\r\npolitically active Irish elements, anxious to discredit the British, also\r\nlent their support to the German cause.\r\n\r\nOn the Atlantic coast, however, the general trend of opinion ran strongly\r\nin favor of the Entente. The brave defense of the Belgians at Liège\r\nagainst terrible odds evoked warm sympathy; the stories of the atrocities\r\ncommitted by the invading Germans, constantly more frequent and more\r\nbrutal in character, enhanced that feeling. The valorous retreat of the\r\nFrench and their last-ditch stand on the Marne compelled admiration.\r\nMoreover, the school histories of the United States with their emphasis\r\nupon La Fayette and the aid given by the French in the first fight for\r\nliberty proved to be of no small importance in the molding of sympathy.\r\nBusiness men naturally favored Great Britain, both because of financial\r\nrelationships and because of their dislike and fear of German commercial\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nBut in all this partisanship there was little appreciation of the peril\r\nthat might result from German victory and no articulate demand that the\r\nUnited States intervene. Warm sympathy might be given to one side or the\r\nother, but the almost universal opinion was that the war was none of our\r\nbusiness. Even Theodore Roosevelt, who later was to be one of the most\r\ndetermined advocates of American intervention on the side of the Entente,\r\nwriting for _The Outlook_ in September, 1914, congratulated the country\r\non its separation from European quarrels, which made possible the\r\npreservation of our peace.\r\n\r\nWhatever the trend of public opinion, President Wilson would have\r\ninsisted upon neutrality. Everything in his character and policy demanded\r\nthe maintenance of peace. He had entered office with a broad programme of\r\nsocial reform in view, and the attainment of his ideals depended upon\r\ndomestic tranquillity. He was, furthermore, a real pacifist, believing\r\nthat war is debasing morally and disastrous economically. Finally, he was\r\nconvinced that the United States was consecrated to a special task,\r\nnamely, the inspiration of politics by moral factors; if the nation was\r\nto accomplish this task its example must be a higher example than one of\r\nforce. Unquestionably he looked forward to acting as mediator in the\r\nstruggle and thus securing for the country and himself new prestige such\r\nas had come in Roosevelt's mediation between Russia and Japan. But the\r\nmain thought in his mind was, first, the preservation of peace for the\r\nsake of peace; and next, to attain the supreme glory of showing the world\r\nthat greatness and peaceableness are complementary in national character\r\nand not antithetic. \"We are champions of peace and of concord,\" he said,\r\n\"and we should be very jealous of this distinction which we have sought\r\nto earn.\"\r\n\r\nWilson's determination was strengthened by his obvious failure to\r\ndistinguish between the war aims of the two sides. He did not at first see\r\nthe moral issue involved. He was anxious to \"reserve judgment until the\r\nend of the war, when all its events and circumstances can be seen in their\r\nentirety and in their true relations.\" When appeals and protests were sent\r\nto him from Germany, Belgium, and France dealing with infractions of the\r\nlaw and practice of nations, he was willing to return a response to\r\nGermany, which had confessedly committed an international wrong, identical\r\nwith that sent to Belgium which had suffered from that wrong. Wilson has\r\nhimself confessed that \"America did not at first see the full meaning of\r\nthe war. It looked like a natural raking out of the pent-up jealousies and\r\nrivalries of the complicated politics of Europe.... We, at the distance\r\nof America, looked on at first without a full comprehension of what the\r\nplot was getting into.\"[2] That the aims of the belligerent powers might\r\naffect the conscience or the fortunes of America he did not perceive. He\r\nurged us not to be \"thrown off our balance by a war with which we have\r\nnothing to do, whose causes cannot touch us, whose very existence affords\r\nus opportunities of friendship and disinterested service which should make\r\nus ashamed of any thought of hostility or fearful preparation for\r\ntrouble.\" Hence his proclamation of neutrality, which was universally\r\naccepted as right. Hence, also, his adjuration to be \"impartial in thought\r\nas well as in action,\" which was not so universally accepted and marks,\r\nperhaps, a definite rift between Wilson and the bulk of educated opinion\r\nin the Northeast.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Speech on the _George Washington_, July 4, 1919.]\r\n\r\nDuring the early days of August Wilson had proclaimed his desire to act\r\nas mediator between the warring forces, although he must have realized\r\nthat the suggestion would prove fruitless at that moment. Again, after\r\nthe battle of the Marne, he took advantage of German discouragement,\r\napparently receiving a hint from Johann von Bernstorff, German\r\nAmbassador in Washington, to sound the belligerents on the possibility of\r\nan arrangement. Failing a second time to elicit serious consideration of\r\npeace, he withdrew to wait for a better opportunity. Thus the Germans,\r\nbeaten back from Paris, vainly pounded the allied lines on the Yser; the\r\nRussians, after forcing their path through Galicia, defended Warsaw with\r\ndesperation; while Wilson kept himself and his country strictly aloof\r\nfrom the conflict.\r\n\r\nBut no mere desires or declarations could prevent the war from touching\r\nAmerica, and each day made more apparent the difficulties and the dangers\r\nof neutrality. The Atlantic no longer separated the two worlds. In\r\nSeptember and October the British Government, taking advantage of the\r\nnaval supremacy assured by their fleet, issued Orders in Council designed\r\nto provide for close control of neutral commerce and to prevent the\r\nimportation of contraband into Germany. British supervision of war-time\r\ntrade has always been strict and its interpretation of the meaning of\r\ncontraband broad; the present instance was no exception. American ships\r\nand cargoes were seized and confiscated to an extent which, while it\r\ndoubtless seemed justified to the British, who were fighting for their\r\nlives, evoked a chorus of bitter complaints from American producers and\r\nexporters. Commerce with neutral countries of Europe threatened to become\r\ncompletely interrupted. On the 21st of October and again on the 26th of\r\nDecember, the State Department sent notes of protest to the British\r\nGovernment. The tone of the discussion was notably sharpened by the\r\nseizure of the _Wilhelmina_, supposedly an American ship, though, as\r\nlater developed, she had been chartered by a German agent in New York,\r\nDr. Heinrich F. Albert, in order to bring the Anglo-American dispute to a\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nHow far the interference with our trade by the British might have\r\nembittered relations, if other issues had not seemed more pressing, no one\r\ncan say. Precisely at the moment when business men were beginning to call\r\nupon Wilson for a sturdier defense of American commercial rights, a\r\ncontroversy with Germany eclipsed, at least from the eye of the general\r\npublic, all other foreign questions. From the moment when the defeat on\r\nthe Marne showed the Germans that victory was not likely to come quickly\r\nto their arms, the Berlin Government realized the importance of preventing\r\nthe export of American munitions. Since the allies held control of the\r\nseas an embargo on such export would be entirely to German advantage, and\r\nthe head of German propaganda in this country, a former Colonial\r\nSecretary, Dr. Bernhard Dernburg, attempted to mobilize German-American\r\nsentiment and to bring pressure upon Congressmen through their\r\nconstituents in favor of such an embargo. It was easy to allege that the\r\nexport of arms, since they went to the allied camp alone, was on its face,\r\nunneutral. Several Senators approved the embargo, among them the chairman\r\nof the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, William J. Stone of Missouri.\r\nAgainst the proposed embargo Wilson set his face steadfastly. He perceived\r\nthe fallacy of the German argument and insisted that to prevent the export\r\nof arms would be itself unneutral. The inability of the Central Powers to\r\nimport arms from the United States resulted from their inferiority on the\r\nhigh seas; the Government would be departing from its position of\r\nimpartiality if it failed to keep American markets open to every nation of\r\nthe world, belligerent or neutral. The United States could not change the\r\nrules in the middle of the game for the advantage of one side. The perfect\r\nlegality of Wilson's decision has been frankly recognized since the war by\r\nthe German Ambassador.\r\n\r\nBut the execution of German military plans demanded that the allied\r\nshortage in munitions, upon which the Teutons counted for success in the\r\nspring campaigns, should not be replenished from American sources.\r\nFailing to budge Wilson on the proposal of an embargo, they launched\r\nthemselves upon a more reckless course. On February 4, 1915, the German\r\nAdmiralty issued a proclamation to the effect that after the 18th of\r\nFebruary, German submarines would destroy every enemy merchant vessel\r\nfound in the waters about the British Isles, which were declared a \"war\r\nzone\"; and that it might not be possible to provide for the safety of\r\ncrew or passengers of destroyed vessels. Neutral ships were warned of the\r\ndanger of destruction if they entered the zone. The excuse alleged for\r\nthis decided departure from the custom of nations was the British\r\nblockade upon foodstuffs, which had been declared as a result of the\r\ncontrol of food in Germany by the Government. Here was quite a different\r\nmatter from British interference with American trade-rights; for if the\r\nGerman threat were carried into effect it signified not merely the\r\ndestruction or loss of property, for which restitution might be made, but\r\nthe possible drowning of American citizens, perhaps women and children,\r\nwho would be entirely within their rights in traveling upon merchant\r\nvessels and to whom the Government owed protection.\r\n\r\nWilson's reply was prompt and definite. \"If the commanders of German\r\nvessels of war should ... destroy on the high seas an American vessel or\r\nthe lives of American citizens, it would be difficult for the Government\r\nof the United States to view the act in any other light than as an\r\nindefensible violation of neutral rights.... The Government of the United\r\nStates would be constrained to hold the Imperial German Government to a\r\nstrict accountability for such acts of their naval authorities and to take\r\nany steps it might be necessary to take to safeguard American lives and\r\nproperty and to secure to American citizens the full enjoyment of their\r\nacknowledged rights on the high seas.\" It was the clearest of warnings.\r\nWould Germany heed it? And if she did not, would Wilson surrender his\r\npacific ideals and take the nation into war?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE SUBMARINE\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the winter of 1914-1915 President Wilson apparently foresaw\r\nsomething of the complications likely to arise from the measures and\r\ncounter-measures taken by the belligerents to secure control of overseas\r\ncommerce, and sent his personal adviser, Colonel House, across the\r\nAtlantic to study the possibilities of reaching a _modus vivendi_. There\r\nwas no man so well qualified for the mission. Edward Mandell House was a\r\nTexan by birth, but a cosmopolitan by nature. His hobby was practical\r\npolitics; his avocation the study of history and government. His\r\ncatholicity of taste is indicated by the nature of his library, which\r\nincludes numerous volumes not merely on the social sciences but also on\r\nphilosophy and poetry. His intellectual background was thus no less\r\nfavorable than his political for the post which he assumed as Wilson's\r\npersonal adviser. Disqualified by physical delicacy from entering the\r\npolitical arena himself and consistently refusing office, he had for\r\nyears controlled the political stage in his own State; in 1912,\r\nexercising strong influence in the national party organization, he had\r\ndone much to crystallize sentiment in favor of Wilson as presidential\r\ncandidate. Slight in stature, quiet in manner and voice, disliking\r\npersonal publicity, with an almost uncanny instinct for divining the\r\nmotives that actuate men, he possessed that which Wilson lacked--the\r\ncapacity to \"mix,\" to meet his fellow mortals, no matter what their\r\nestate, on a common ground.\r\n\r\nCourteous and engaging, Colonel House was an unexcelled negotiator: he\r\nhad a genius for compromise, as perfect a control of his emotions as of\r\nhis facial expression, and a pacific magnetism that soothed into\r\nreasonableness the most heated interlocutor. His range of acquaintance in\r\nthe United States was unparalleled. Abroad, previous to the war, he had\r\ndiscussed international relations with the Kaiser and the chief statesmen\r\nof France and England. His experience of American politics and knowledge\r\nof foreign affairs, whether derived from men or from books, were matched\r\nby an almost unerring penetration in the analysis of a political\r\nsituation, domestic or European. As a liberal idealist and pacifist, he\r\nsaw eye to eye with Wilson; his sense of political actualities, however,\r\nwas infinitely more keen.\r\n\r\nBut even the skill of Colonel House was not sufficient to induce Germany\r\nto hold her hand, and, as spring advanced, it became increasingly clear\r\nthat she was resolved to carry her threats of unrestricted submarine\r\nwarfare into effect. The quality of Wilson's pacifism was about to be put\r\nto the test. In March a British steamer, the _Falaba_, was sunk and an\r\nAmerican citizen drowned; some weeks later an American boat, the\r\n_Cushing_, was attacked by a German airplane; and on the 1st of May,\r\nanother American steamer, the _Gulflight_, was sunk by a submarine with\r\nthe loss of two American lives. When was Wilson going to translate into\r\naction his summary warning of \"strict accountability?\" Even as the\r\nquestion was asked, we heard that the Germans had sunk the _Lusitania_.\r\nOn the 7th of May, 1915, at two in the afternoon, the pride of the\r\nBritish merchant marine was struck by two torpedoes fired from a German\r\nsubmarine. She sank in half an hour. More than eleven hundred of her\r\npassengers and crew were drowned, among them one hundred and twenty-four\r\nAmericans, men, women, and children.\r\n\r\nThe cry that went up from America was one of anguish, but still more one\r\nof rage. This attack upon non-combatant travelers, citizens of a neutral\r\nstate, had been callously premeditated and ruthlessly executed in cold\r\nblood. The German Government had given frigid warning, in a newspaper\r\nadvertisement, of its intention to affront the custom of nations and the\r\nlaws of humanity. A wave of the bitterest anti-German feeling swept down\r\nthe Atlantic coast and out to the Mississippi; for the first time there\r\nbecame apparent a definite trend of opinion demanding the entrance of the\r\nUnited States into the war on the side of the Entente. On that day Wilson\r\nmight have won a declaration of war, so strong was popular sentiment; and\r\ndespite the comparative indifference of the Missouri valley and the Far\r\nWest, he might have aroused enthusiasm if not unity.\r\n\r\nBut a declaration of war then would, in all probability, have been a\r\nmistake. Entrance into the war at that time would have been based upon\r\nneither judgment nor ideals, but merely upon emotion. The American people\r\nwere in no way prepared to bring material aid to the cause of justice,\r\nnor did the nation yet appreciate the moral issues involved. It would\r\nhave been a war of revenge for American lives lost. The President was by\r\ntemperament disinclined to listen to the passionate demands for\r\nintervention, and, as historian, he must have had in mind the error\r\ncommitted by McKinley when he permitted the declaration of war on Spain,\r\nafter the sinking of the _Maine_ in 1898. Sober afterthought has\r\ngenerally agreed that Wilson was right. But he was himself led into a\r\nserious error that produced consequences which were not soon to be\r\ndissipated. Speaking three days after the event, when the world looked to\r\nhim to express the soul of America, and dealing with the spirit of\r\nAmericanism, he permitted an unfortunate phrase to enter his address and\r\nto cloud his purpose. \"There is such a thing,\" he said, \"as a man being\r\ntoo proud to fight.\" The phrase was by no means essential to the main\r\npoints of his address; it was preceded by one of greater importance,\r\nnamely that \"the example of America must be a special example ... of\r\npeace because peace is the healing and elevating influence of the world\r\nand strife is not.\" It was followed by another of equal importance, that\r\na nation may be so much in the right \"that it does not need to convince\r\nothers by force that it is right.\" These two phrases expressed what was\r\nin the President's mind clearly and definitely: the United States was\r\nconsecrated to ideals which could not be carried into effect through\r\nforce, unless every other method dictated by supreme patience had failed.\r\nBut the world did not notice them. All that it remembered was that the\r\nUnited States was \"too proud to fight.\" What did this mean to the average\r\nman except that the country was afraid to fight? The peoples of the\r\nEntente powers were contemptuous; Germans were reassured; Americans were\r\nhumiliated.\r\n\r\nWilson the phrase-maker was betrayed by a phrase, and it was to pursue him\r\nlike a Fury. The chorus of indignation and shame aroused by this phrase\r\ncovered completely the determination and skill with which he entered upon\r\nthe diplomatic struggle with Germany. His purpose was definite. He had\r\ngone on record in February that the United States Government would protect\r\nthe rights of American citizens, and he was bound to secure from Germany a\r\npromise that merchant ships should not be torpedoed without warning or\r\nassuring the lives of crew and passengers. And yet by virtue of his\r\npacific principles this promise could not be forcibly extracted until\r\nevery other possible method had been attempted in vain. Unquestionably he\r\nwas supported in his policy by many, perhaps most, thoughtful people,\r\nalthough wherever support was given him in the East it was generally\r\ngrudging. Such a representative and judicial mind as that of ex-President\r\nTaft favored cool consideration and careful action. But the difficulties\r\nencountered by the President were tremendous. On the one hand he met the\r\nbitter denunciations of the group, constantly increasing in numbers, which\r\ndemanded our immediate intervention on the side of the Entente. Led by\r\nRoosevelt, who no longer felt as in the previous September, that the\r\nUnited States had no immediate interest in the war, this group included\r\ninfluential men of business and many writers. They had lost patience with\r\nWilson's patience. His policy was, in their opinion, that of a coward. On\r\nthe other hand, Wilson was assailed by pro-Germans and die-hard pacifists;\r\nthe former believed that the British blockade justified Germany's\r\nsubmarine warfare; the latter were afraid even of strong language in\r\ndiplomatic notes, lest it lead to war. At the very outset of the\r\ndiplomatic controversy with Germany, before the second _Lusitania_ note\r\nwas dispatched, the Secretary of State, William Jennings Bryan, resigned,\r\nin the belief that the President's tone was too peremptory. For Bryan was\r\nwilling to arbitrate even Germany's right to drown American citizens on\r\nthe high seas. The defection of this influential politician a year\r\nprevious would have weakened Wilson seriously, but by now the President\r\nhad won secure control of the party. He was, indeed, strengthened\r\ndiplomatically by Bryan's resignation, as the latter, in a conversation\r\nwith the Austrian Ambassador, had given the impression that American\r\nprotests need not be taken over-seriously. His continuance in office might\r\nhave encouraged German leaders to adopt a bolder tone.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of his attempts to obtain from Germany a disavowal\r\nfor the sinking of the _Lusitania_ and a promise not to sink without\r\nwarning, the President took his stand upon high ground. Not merely did he\r\ninsist upon the rights guaranteed to neutrals by the law of nations; he\r\ntook the controversy out of the class of ordinary subjects of diplomatic\r\ndiscussion and contended \"for nothing less high and sacred than the rights\r\nof humanity.\" To this he recurred in each of his notes. Germany avoided\r\nthe issue. At first she insisted that the _Lusitania_ was armed, carrying\r\nexplosives of war, transporting troops from Canada, and thus virtually\r\nacting as a naval auxiliary. After the falsity of this assertion was\r\nshown, she adduced the restrictions placed by Great Britain on neutral\r\ntrade as excuse for submarine operations, and contended that the\r\ncircumstances of naval warfare in the twentieth century had so changed\r\nthat the principles of international law no longer held good.\r\n\r\nEach time Wilson returned to his point that the \"rights of neutrals are\r\nbased upon principle, not upon expediency, and the principles are\r\nimmutable. Illegal and inhuman acts ... are manifestly indefensible when\r\nthey deprive neutrals of their acknowledged rights, particularly when\r\nthey violate the right to life itself. If a belligerent cannot retaliate\r\nagainst an enemy without injuring the lives of neutrals, as well as their\r\nproperty, humanity, as well as justice and a due regard for the dignity\r\nof neutral powers should dictate that the practice be discontinued.\"\r\nWilson terminated his third note to Germany with a warning, which had the\r\ntone, if not the form, of an ultimatum: there must be a scrupulous\r\nobservance of neutral rights in this critical matter, as repetition of\r\n\"acts in contravention of those rights must be regarded by the Government\r\nof the United States, when they affect American citizens, as deliberately\r\nunfriendly.\"\r\n\r\nThe exchange of notes consumed much time and proved a severe test for\r\nAmerican patience. The first _Lusitania_ note was sent on the 13th of\r\nMay and it was not until the 1st of September that the German Government\r\nfinally gave a pledge that was acceptable to Wilson. In the meantime\r\nthere had been continued sinkings, or attempts to sink, in clear\r\nviolation of the principles for which the President was contending. The\r\n_Nebraskan_, the _Armenian_, the _Orduna_, were subjected to submarine\r\nattacks. On the 19th of August the _Arabic_ was sunk and two Americans\r\nlost. The ridicule heaped upon the President by the British and certain\r\nsections of the American press, for his writing of diplomatic notes, was\r\nonly equaled by the sense of humiliation experienced by pro-Entente\r\nelements in this country. _Punch_ issued a cartoon in which Uncle Sam\r\npointed to Wilson as having outstripped the record made by Job for\r\npatience. Nevertheless Wilson obtained the main point for which he was\r\nstriving. On September 1, 1915, the German Government gave the definite\r\npledge that \"Liners will not be sunk by our submarines without warning\r\nand without safety of the lives of non-combatants, provided that the\r\nliners do not try to escape or offer resistance.\" Wilson had sought to\r\nsafeguard a principle by compelling from Germany a written acknowledgment\r\nof its validity. So much he had won and without the exercise of force.\r\nEven those whose nerves were most overwrought by the long-drawn-out\r\nnegotiations, admitted that it was a diplomatic victory.\r\n\r\nThe victory was not clean-cut, for Germany had not yet disavowed the\r\nsinking of the _Lusitania_, nor did the category \"liners\" seem to include\r\nall merchant vessels. How real was even the partial victory remained to\r\nbe seen. Within three days of the German pledge the _Hesperian_ was sunk\r\nand an American citizen drowned. On the 7th of November the _Ancona_ was\r\ntorpedoed in the Mediterranean by an Austrian submarine with the loss of\r\nmore American lives. It is true that after each case a disavowal was made\r\nand a renewal of promises vouchsafed. But it seemed obvious that Germany\r\nwas merely playing for time and also that she counted upon pro-German and\r\npacifist agitation in this country. For a brief period it appeared as if\r\nher hopes were not to be entirely disappointed. British merchant vessels,\r\nfollowing long-established custom, had for some months been armed for\r\npurposes of defense. The German Government on February 10, 1916,\r\nannounced that henceforward such armed merchantmen would be regarded as\r\nauxiliary cruisers and would be sunk without warning. It was unfortunate\r\nthat Robert Lansing, who had succeeded Bryan as Secretary of State, had\r\nproposed on January 18, 1916, to the diplomatic representatives of the\r\nAllied forces that they cease the arming of merchantmen as a means of\r\nsecuring from Germany a pledge which would cover all merchantmen as well\r\nas passenger liners; this proposal gave to Germany a new opportunity for\r\nraising the issue of the submarine. But either Lansing's proposal had\r\nbeen made without Mr. Wilson's sanction or the President changed his\r\nmind, since on the 10th of February Wilson declared that he intended to\r\nrecognize the right of merchantmen to arm for purposes of defense. Once\r\nmore he insisted that the rules of war could not be changed during war\r\nfor the advantage of one side.\r\n\r\nHis declaration led at once to something like a revolt of Congress.\r\nAlready some of those who especially feared intervention had been\r\nsuffering from an attack of panic as a result of Wilson's recent decision\r\nto support the preparedness movement. They were further terrified by the\r\npossibility that some American citizen traveling on an armed merchantman\r\nmight lose his life and that the demand for entrance into the war might\r\nthus become irresistible. Bryanites, pro-German propagandists, and Irish\r\ncombined against the President, and were reinforced by all the\r\ndiscontented elements who hoped to break Wilson's control of the\r\nDemocratic party. The combination seemed like a new cave of Adullam.\r\nResolutions were introduced in the Senate by Thomas P. Gore and in the\r\nHouse by Jeff McLemore, based upon suggestions made by Bryan nine months\r\nbefore, that American citizens should be warned not to travel on armed\r\nmerchant vessels. Senator Stone, of the Foreign Relations Committee,\r\nsupported these resolutions and it appeared probable that Germany would\r\nfind her strongest support in the American Congress.\r\n\r\nWilson struck sharply. Not merely his leadership of the party and the\r\ncountry was at stake, but also that moral leadership of neutral nations\r\nand the world toward which the struggle with Germany was to take him.\r\nRefusing to receive Senator Stone, he sent him a letter in which the\r\ncardinal points of his position were underlined. \"Once accept a single\r\nabatement of right,\" he insisted, \"and many other humiliations would\r\ncertainly follow, and the whole fine fabric of international law might\r\ncrumble under our hands piece by piece. What we are now contending for in\r\nthis matter is the very essence of the things that have made America a\r\nsovereign nation. She cannot yield them without conceding her own\r\nimpotency as a Nation and making virtual surrender of her independent\r\nposition among the nations of the world.\" This definite enunciation was\r\nin effect an appeal to the American people, which came as a relief to\r\nthose who had suffered from presidential patience under German outrages.\r\nThe storm of public feeling aroused against the rebellious Congressmen\r\nwas such that Wilson's victory became assured. Demanding concrete\r\njustification of his stand, he insisted that the resolutions be put to\r\nthe vote. The issue was somewhat confused in the Senate so that the vote\r\nwas not decisive; but in the House the McLemore resolution was defeated\r\nby a vote of 276 to 142.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the submarine issue was not finally closed. Less than a month\r\nafter the rights of American citizens were thus maintained, the British\r\npassenger steamer _Sussex_, crossing the English Channel, was torpedoed\r\nwithout warning. It was the clearest violation of the pledge given by the\r\nGerman Government the previous September. Once again Wilson acted without\r\nprecipitancy. He waited until the Germans should present explanations\r\nand thereafter took more than a week in which to formulate his decision.\r\nFinally, on April 19, 1916, he called the two houses of Congress in joint\r\nsession to lay before them his note to Germany. Unlike his _Lusitania_\r\nnotes, this was a definite ultimatum, clearly warranted by the undeniable\r\nfact that Germany had broken a solemn pledge. After recounting the long\r\nlist of events which had so sorely tried American patience, Wilson\r\nconcluded that \"unless the Imperial German Government should now\r\nimmediately declare and effect an abandonment of its present methods of\r\nwarfare against passenger and freight carrying vessels this Government\r\ncan have no choice but to sever diplomatic relations with the Government\r\nof the German Empire altogether.\" The force of the ultimatum was\r\nemphasized by the general tone of the note, in which, as in the\r\n_Lusitania_ notes, the President spoke not so much for the legal rights\r\nof the United States, as in behalf of the moral rights of all humanity.\r\nHe stressed the \"principles of humanity as embodied in the law of\r\nnations,\" and excoriated the \"inhumanity of submarine warfare\"; he\r\nterminated by stating that the United States would contemplate a\r\ndiplomatic break with reluctance, but would feel constrained to take the\r\nstep \"in behalf of humanity and the rights of neutral nations.\" This note\r\nof emphasis upon America's duty to mankind rather than to herself formed\r\nthe main theme of a speech delivered two days previous: \"America will\r\nhave forgotten her traditions whenever upon any occasion she fights\r\nmerely for herself under such circumstances as will show that she has\r\nforgotten to fight for all mankind. And the only excuse that America can\r\never have for the assertion of her physical force is that she asserts it\r\nin behalf of the interests of humanity.\"\r\n\r\nGermany yielded before Wilson's ultimatum, though with bad grace, and\r\npromised that no more merchant ships would be sunk \"without warning and\r\nwithout saving human lives.\" But she also tried to make her promise\r\nconditional upon the cessation by Great Britain of methods of warfare\r\nwhich Germany called illegal, implying that her pledge might be withdrawn\r\nat her pleasure: \"the German Government ... must reserve itself complete\r\nliberty of action.\" This condition Wilson, in taking note of Germany's\r\npledge, definitely waved aside: \"the Government of the United States\r\nnotifies the Imperial Government that it cannot for a moment entertain,\r\nmuch less discuss, a suggestion that respect by German naval authorities\r\nfor the rights of American citizens upon the high seas should in any way\r\nor in the slightest degree be made contingent upon the conduct of any\r\nother government affecting the rights of neutrals and non-combatants.\r\nResponsibility in such matters is single, not joint; absolute, not\r\nrelative.\" By its silence the German Government seemed to acquiesce and\r\nthe crisis was over. The country had been close to war, but intervention\r\nmight yet be avoided if Germany kept her word. That, however, was a\r\ncondition upon which people were learning not to rely.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that by the early summer of 1916 President Wilson's\r\nattitude on foreign affairs had undergone a notable transformation from\r\nthat parochial spirit of 1914 which had led him to declare that the war\r\nwas no concern of America; he had given over completely the tradition\r\nthat if we keep our own hands clean we fulfill our duty. He had begun to\r\nelaborate an idealistic policy of service to the world, not unreminiscent\r\nof the altruistic schemes of Clay and Webster for assisting oppressed\r\nrepublicans in Europe during the first third of the nineteenth century.\r\nWilson, like those statesmen, had always felt that the position of the\r\nUnited States in the world was of a special sort, quite different from\r\nthat of the European states, and circumstances were forcing him to take\r\nthe stand that the nation must assume the lead in the world in order to\r\nensure the operation of the principles that Americans believe in. \"We are\r\nin some sort and by the force of circumstances the responsible spokesman\r\nof the rights of humanity.\" He still opposed active intervention in the\r\nwar; the mission of the United States was a higher one than could\r\nadequately be fulfilled through war; the kind of service we could best\r\ngive was not fighting. Yet he was brought to admit, even before the\r\n_Sussex_ crisis (February 26, 1916), that in the last instance war might\r\nbe necessary if the American people were to assume the rôle of champion\r\nof liberty in the world at large, as they had championed it in the\r\nAmericas; for the rights of humanity must be made secure against menace:\r\n\"America ought to keep out of this war ... at the expense of everything\r\nexcept this single thing upon which her character and history are\r\nfounded, her sense of humanity and justice.... Valor withholds itself\r\nfrom all small implications and entanglements and waits for the great\r\nopportunity, when the sword will flash as if it carried the light of\r\nheaven upon its blade.\" Thus the possibility of ultimate force was\r\nimplied. Eighteen months previous, peace had been for Wilson an end in\r\nitself. Now it was subordinated to the greater end implied in maintaining\r\nthe principle of justice in the world.\r\n\r\nDuring this period popular sentiment also underwent a notable\r\ndevelopment. Americans reacted sharply to German threats and outrages,\r\nand were thrown off their comfortable balance by the events which touched\r\nAmerican honor and safety so closely. Like Wilson, they were shaken out\r\nof that sense of isolation which enveloped them in 1914, and they were\r\nthus prepared for the reception of broader ideals. The process of\r\neducation was slow and difficult. It was hampered by the confusion of\r\nforeign issues. Propagandists took advantage of the controversy with\r\nGreat Britain in order to obscure the principles upon which the\r\ndiscussions with Germany were based. The increasing stringency of British\r\ncontrol of commerce and the blacklisting of various American firms by the\r\nBritish authorities resulted in numerous American protests and to some\r\nwarmth of feeling. Wilson was no particular friend of the British, but he\r\nrightly insisted upon the distinction between the dispute with Germany,\r\nwhich involved the common right of humanity to life, and that with Great\r\nBritain, which involved merely rights of property. Nevertheless that\r\ndistinction was blurred in the minds of many Americans, and their\r\nperception of the new ideals of foreign policy was necessarily confused.\r\n\r\nThe education of the American people to the significance of the issue was\r\nalso hampered by the material change that came over the country during\r\nthe latter part of 1915 and the spring of 1916. The influx of gold and\r\nthe ease with which fortunes were accumulated could not but have\r\nwidespread effects. The European war came at a moment when the United\r\nStates was passing through a period of comparatively hard times.\r\nStringency was naturally increased by the liquidation of foreign\r\ninvestments in 1914 and the closing of European markets to American\r\ncommerce. Business was dull. But this condition was rapidly altered\r\nthrough the placing of large contracts by the Entente Governments and the\r\nmost extensive buying by foreign purchasers. New markets were found among\r\nthe neutral states, which were unable to buy in Europe. Naturally there\r\ndeveloped a rapid extension of industrial activities. New manufacturing\r\nconcerns grew up, large and small, as a result of these adventitious\r\nconditions, which paid enormous returns. Activities upon the stock market\r\nwere unparalleled. New and sudden fortunes were made; millionaires\r\nbecame common. The whole world was debtor to America and a golden stream\r\nflowed across the Atlantic. Prices rose rapidly and wages followed.\r\n\r\nInevitably materialism conquered, at least for the moment. The demand for\r\nluxuries was only equaled by the craze for entertainment. Artisans and\r\nshopgirls invaded the jewelry stores of Fifth Avenue. Metropolitan life\r\nwas a succession of luncheons and teas, where fertile brains were busied\r\nwith the invention of new dancing steps rather than the issues of the\r\nEuropean war. Cabarets were crowded and seats for midnight beauty shows\r\nmust be secured well in advance or by means of gargantuan tips to\r\nplutocratic head waiters. Much of the materialism was simply external. In\r\nevery town American women by the thousand gave lavishly of their time and\r\nstrength to knit and roll bandages for the fighters and wounded overseas.\r\nAmerica was collecting millions for the relief of Belgium, Serbia, and\r\nfor the Red Cross. The American Ambulance in France was served by men\r\nimbued with the spirit of sacrifice. Thousands of American youths\r\nenlisted in the Canadian forces. The general atmosphere of the country,\r\nhowever, was heavy with amusement and money-making. Not yet did America\r\nfully realize that the war was a struggle of ideals which must concern\r\nevery one closely. In such an atmosphere the idealistic policy of Wilson\r\nwas not easily understood.\r\n\r\nThe President himself cannot escape a large share of the blame for\r\nAmerica's blindness to the issue. During the first twelve months of the\r\nwar, when the country looked to him for leadership, he had, purposely or\r\notherwise, fostered the forces of pacifism and encouraged the advocates\r\nof national isolation. He had underlined the separation of the United\r\nStates from everything that went on in Europe and insisted that in the\r\nissues of the war the American people had no interest. In deference to\r\nthe spirit of pacifism that engrossed the Middle West, he had opposed the\r\nmovement for military preparedness. When, late in 1915, Wilson changed\r\nhis attitude and attempted to arouse the country to a sense of American\r\ninterest in world affairs and to the need of preparing to accept\r\nresponsibility, he encountered the opposition of forces which he himself\r\nhad helped to vitalize.\r\n\r\nPopular education, especially upon the Atlantic coast, was further\r\nhampered by the personal irritation which the President aroused. Disliked\r\nwhen inaugurated, he had attracted bitter enmity among the business men\r\nwho dominate opinion in New England and the Eastern States. They accused\r\nhim of truckling to labor. They were wearied by his idealism, which\r\nseemed to them all words and no deeds. They regarded his handling of\r\nforeign affairs, whether in the Mexican or submarine crises, as weak and\r\nvacillating. He was, in Rooseveltian nomenclature, a \"pussyfooter.\" Hence\r\ngrew up the tradition, which was destined to endure among many elements\r\nof opinion, that everything advocated by Wilson must, simply by reason of\r\nits authorship, be essentially wrong. The men of Boston, New York, and\r\nPhiladelphia were beginning to give over their attitude of isolation and\r\nadmit with Roosevelt that the United States ought to stand with the\r\nEntente. The Wilsonian doctrine of service to the world, however, was not\r\nto their taste, partly because they did not like Wilson.\r\n\r\nIt was to the rural districts of the upper Mississippi and to the South\r\nthat the President looked most eagerly for support of his new policy.\r\nThese were the regions where indifference to and ignorance of foreign\r\naffairs had been most conspicuous, but they were also the regions where\r\nthe President's personal influence was strongest; finally they were the\r\ndistricts where extreme pacifism was most deeply embedded. If Wilson's\r\nchampionship of the rights of liberty throughout the world could be\r\naccomplished by pacific methods, they would follow him; but if it meant\r\nwar, no one could guarantee what their attitude might be. Bryan was\r\npopular in those parts. As yet Wilson, while he had formulated his policy\r\nin broad terms, had not indicated the methods or mechanism by which his\r\nprinciples were to be put into operation. He would without question\r\nencounter strong opposition among the German-Americans; he would find the\r\nattitude of the Irish foes of the Entente hostile; he would find the\r\nPacific coast more interested in Japanese immigration than in the ideals\r\nof the European war. Fortunately events were to unify the heterogeneous\r\nelements of the country, at least for the moment, in a way that\r\nsimplified greatly the President's problem. Not the least of the unifying\r\nforces was to be found in German psychology, which led the Imperial\r\nGovernment to believe that the United States could be rendered helpless\r\nthrough the intrigues of German spies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPLOTS AND PREPAREDNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Government of the German Empire was inspired by a spirit that was at\r\nonce modern and medieval, and this contradictory spirit manifested itself\r\nin the ways and means employed to win the sympathy of the United States\r\nand to prevent it, as a neutral power, from assisting the Entente.\r\nGermany worked on the one hand by means of open propaganda, which is the\r\nmethod of modern commercial advertisement translated into the political\r\nfield, and on the other by secret intrigue reminiscent of the days of\r\nLouis XI. Her propaganda took the form of organized campaigns to\r\ninfluence opinion through speeches, pamphlets, and books, which were\r\ndesigned to convince the country of the justice of Germany's cause and\r\nthe dangers of becoming the catspaw of the Entente. Her plans of intrigue\r\nwere directed towards the use of German-Americans or German spies to\r\nassist in the return of German officers from this country, to hinder the\r\ntransport of Canadian troops, to destroy communications, and to hamper\r\nthe output of munitions for the Entente by strikes, incendiary fires, and\r\nexplosions.\r\n\r\nDuring the first weeks of the war a German press bureau was established\r\nin New York for the distribution of pro-German literature and the support\r\nof the German-American press. Its activities were chiefly directed by Dr.\r\nBernhard Dernburg, who defended Germany from the charge of responsibility\r\nfor the war and expatiated upon her efficiency and the beneficence of her\r\nculture in the same breath that he attacked the commercial greed of Great\r\nBritain, the cruel autocracy of Russia, and the imperialistic designs of\r\nJapan in the Pacific. Its pamphlets went so far as to excoriate allied\r\nmethods of warfare and to level accusations of inhumanity against the\r\nBelgians. It distributed broadcast throughout the country an appeal\r\nsigned by ninety-three German professors and intellectuals, and\r\ncountersigned by a few notable Americans, which besought the American\r\npeople not to be deceived by the \"lies and calumnies\" of the enemies of\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThis propaganda left all cold except those who already sympathized with\r\nGermany. Indeed it reacted unfavorably against the German cause, as soon\r\nas the well-authenticated reports came of German atrocities in Belgium,\r\nof the burning of the Louvain library, and of the shelling of Rheims\r\ncathedral. The efforts of German agents then shifted, concentrating in an\r\nattack upon the United States Government for its alleged unneutral\r\nattitude in permitting the export of munitions to the Entente. In some\r\nsections of the country they were able to arouse an opinion favorable to\r\nthe establishment of an embargo. In the Senate, on December 10, 1914, a\r\nbill was offered by John D. Works of California providing for the\r\nprohibition of the sale of war supplies to any belligerent nation and a\r\nsimilar bill was fathered in the House by Charles L. Bartlett of Georgia.\r\nThese efforts were warmly supported by various associations, some of\r\nwhich were admittedly German-American societies, although the majority\r\nattempted to conceal their partisan feeling under such titles as\r\n_American Independence Union_ and _American Neutrality League_. The\r\nlatter effectively displayed its interest in America and in neutrality by\r\ntumultuous singing of _Deutschland über Alles_ and _Die Wacht am Rhein_.\r\nOf sincerely pacifist organizations there were not a few, among which\r\nshould not be forgotten the fantastic effort of Henry Ford in December,\r\n1915, to end the war by sending a \"Peace Ship\" to Europe, designed to\r\narouse such public opinion abroad in favor of peace that \"the boys would\r\nbe out of the trenches by Christmas.\" The ship sailed, but the\r\nexpedition, which was characterized by equal amounts of honesty and\r\nfoolishness, broke up shortly in dissension. For the most part pacifism\r\nand pro-Germanism went hand in hand--a tragic alliance of good and evil\r\nwhich was to hamper later efforts to evolve an international organization\r\nfor the preservation of peace.\r\n\r\nThe attempts of German propagandists to influence the policy of the\r\nGovernment met, as we have seen, the stubborn resolve of the President\r\nnot to favor one camp of the belligerents by a departure from\r\ninternational custom and law during the progress of the war. Their\r\nefforts, however, were not entirely relaxed. Appeals were made to workmen\r\nto stop the war by refusing to manufacture munitions; vigorous campaigns\r\nwere conducted to discredit the Administration by creating the belief\r\nthat it was discriminating in favor of the British. But more and more\r\nGermany took to secret intrigue, the strings of which were pulled by the\r\nmilitary and naval attachés, von Papen and Boy-Ed. The German Ambassador,\r\nvon Bernstorff, also took a lively interest in the plans to control\r\npublic opinion and later to hamper munitions production. With his\r\napproval, German manufacturing companies were organized at Bridgeport and\r\nelsewhere to buy up the machinery and supplies essential to the\r\nproduction of powder, shrapnel, and surplus benzol; arrangements were\r\nmade with the Bosch Magneto Company to enter into contracts with the\r\nEntente for fuses and at the last moment to refuse to complete the\r\ncontract. Von Bernstorff was careful to avoid active participation in\r\nplots for the destruction of property; but his interest and complicity,\r\ntogether with that of Dr. Heinrich F. Albert, Financial Adviser of the\r\nGerman Embassy, are evidenced by the checks drawn on their joint account\r\nand paid to convicted criminals.\r\n\r\nOne of the first of the plots was the attempted blowing up of the\r\ninternational bridge at Vanceboro, Maine, on December 31, 1914. The\r\nmaterials for this explosion were collected and the fuse set by a German\r\nreservist lieutenant, Werner Horn, who admitted that he acted under the\r\norders of von Papen. Another plan of the German agents was the\r\ndestruction of the Welland Canal, which was entrusted to a brilliant and\r\nerratic adventurer, von der Goltz, who later confessed that he was under\r\nthe supervision of von Papen and had secured his materials from Captain\r\nHans Tauscher, the agent in New York of the Hamburg-American Line. This\r\ncompany was involved in securing false manifests for vessels that carried\r\ncoal and supplies to German cruisers, thus defrauding the United States,\r\nand in obtaining false passports for German reservists and agents; it\r\nacted, in fact, as an American branch of the German Admiralty. More\r\nserious yet was an attempt of the naval attaché, Boy-Ed, to involve the\r\nUnited States and Mexico in a dispute by a plot to bring back Huerta.\r\nThis unhappy Mexican leader was arrested on the Mexican border in June,\r\n1915, and shortly afterwards died.\r\n\r\nFor some months the existence of such activities on the part of German\r\nagents had been suspected by the public. A series of disclosures\r\nfollowed. In July, 1915, Dr. Albert, while riding on a New York elevated\r\ntrain, was so careless as to set his portfolio on the seat for a few\r\nmoments; it was speedily picked up by a fellow passenger who made a hasty\r\nexit. Soon afterwards the chief contents of the portfolio were published.\r\nThey indicated the complicity of the German Embassy in different\r\nattempts to control the American press and to influence public opinion,\r\nand proved the energy of less notable agents in illegal undertakings.\r\nTowards the end of August, the Austrian Ambassador, Dr. Constantin Dumba,\r\nmade use of an American correspondent, James F. J. Archibald by name, to\r\ncarry dispatches to the Central Empires. He was arrested by the British\r\nauthorities at Falmouth, and his effects proved Dumba's interest in plans\r\nto organize strikes in American munitions plants. \"It is my impression,\"\r\nwrote the Austrian Ambassador, \"that we can disorganize and hold up for\r\nmonths, if not entirely prevent, the manufacture of munitions in\r\nBethlehem and the Middle West, which in the opinion of the German\r\nmilitary attaché, is of great importance and amply outweighs the\r\nexpenditure of money involved.\" Archibald also carried a letter from von\r\nPapen to his wife in which he wrote: \"I always say to these idiotic\r\nYankees that they had better hold their tongues.\" Its publication did not\r\nserve to allay the warmth of American feeling.\r\n\r\nIt was with great satisfaction, therefore, that the public learned in\r\nSeptember that President Wilson had requested the recall of Ambassador\r\nDumba in the following words: \"By reason of the admitted purpose and\r\nintent of Ambassador Dumba to conspire to cripple legitimate industries\r\nof the people of the United States and to interrupt their legitimate\r\ntrade, and by reason of the flagrant diplomatic impropriety in employing\r\nan American citizen protected by an American passport, as a secret bearer\r\nof official despatches through the lines of the enemy of\r\nAustria-Hungary.... Mr. Dumba is no longer acceptable to the Government\r\nof the United States.\" The two German attachés were given a longer\r\nshrift, but on the 30th of November von Bernstorff was told that they\r\nwere no longer acceptable; von Papen sailed on the 22d of December and\r\nwas followed a week later by Boy-Ed.\r\n\r\nDuring the two preceding months there had been a constant series of\r\nstrikes and explosions in munitions plants and industrial works, and\r\npublic opinion was now thoroughly aroused. The feeling that Germany and\r\nAustria were thus through their agents virtually carrying on warfare in\r\nthe United States was intensified by the revelations of Dr. Joseph\r\nGori[)c]ar, formerly an Austrian consul, but a Jugoslav who sympathized\r\nwith the Entente; according to his statement every Austrian consul in\r\nthe country was \"a center of intrigue of the most criminal character.\"\r\nHis charges came at the moment when Americans were reading that the\r\nnumber of strikes in munitions plants was unparalleled, no less than one\r\nhundred and two in a few months, of which fifty were in Bridgeport,\r\nwhich was known to be a center of German activities. Explosions and\r\nfires at the plants of the Bethlehem Steel Company and the Baldwin\r\nLocomotive Works, and at the Roebling wire-rope shop in Trenton were of\r\nmysterious origin.\r\n\r\nTo what extent explosions in munitions plants were the result of German\r\nincendiarism and not of an accidental nature, it is difficult to\r\ndetermine. But the Department of Justice was so thoroughly convinced of\r\nthe far-reaching character of German plots that President Wilson, in his\r\nannual message of December, 1915, frankly denounced the \"hyphenates\" who\r\nlent their aid to such intrigues. \"I am sorry to say that the gravest\r\nthreats against our national peace and safety have been uttered within\r\nour own borders. There are citizens of the United States ... who have\r\npoured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national\r\nlife; who have sought to bring the authority and good name of our\r\nGovernment into contempt, to destroy our industries wherever they thought\r\nit effective for their vindictive purposes to strike at them, and to\r\ndebase our politics to the uses of foreign intrigue.\" His attack drew\r\nforth the bitter resentment of the foreign language press, but was hailed\r\nwith delight in the East, where German intrigues aroused as great\r\nexcitement against the Fatherland as the submarine campaign. Nor was it\r\ncalmed by the continuance of fires and explosions and the evident\r\ncomplicity of German officials. During the spring of 1916 a German agent,\r\nvon Igel, who occupied the former offices of von Papen, was arrested, and\r\nthe activities of Franz von Rintelen, who had placed incendiary bombs on\r\nvessels leaving New York with food and supplies for the Allies, were\r\npublished. Taken in conjunction with the sinking of the _Sussex_, German\r\nplots were now stimulating the American people to a keen sense of their\r\ninterest in the war, and preparing them effectively for a new attitude\r\ntoward foreign affairs in general.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that such revelations should have created a widespread\r\ndemand for increased military efficiency. The nation was approaching the\r\npoint where force might become necessary, and yet it was in no way\r\nprepared for warfare, either on land or sea. During the first months of\r\nthe war the helplessness of the United States had been laid bare by\r\nGeneral Leonard Wood, who declared that we had never fought a really\r\nfirst-class nation and \"were pitifully unprepared, should such a calamity\r\nbe thrust upon us.\" The regular army \"available to face such a crisis\"\r\nwould be \"just about equal to the police forces of Boston, New York, and\r\nPhiladelphia.\" The \"preparedness movement\" thus inaugurated was\r\ncrystallized by the formation of the National Security League, designed\r\nto organize citizens in such a way \"as may make practical an intelligent\r\nexpression of public opinion and may ensure for the nation an adequate\r\nsystem of national defense.\" Pacifists and pro-Germans immediately\r\norganized in opposition; and the movement was hampered by President\r\nWilson's unwillingness to coöperate in any way. He was flatly opposed, in\r\nthe autumn of 1914 and the spring of the following year, to compulsory\r\nmilitary service: \"We will not ask our young men to spend the best years\r\nof their lives making soldiers of themselves.\" He insisted that the\r\nAmerican people had always been able to defend themselves and should be\r\nable to continue to do so without altering their military traditions. It\r\nmust not be forgotten that at this time Wilson still believed in absolute\r\nisolation and refused to consider force as an element in our foreign\r\npolicy. His attitude was sufficient to render fruitless various\r\nresolutions presented by Congressman Augustus P. Gardner and Senator\r\nGeorge E. Chamberlain, who proposed improvements in the military system.\r\nCongress was pacifically-minded. This was the time when many Congressmen\r\nwere advocating an embargo on arms, and so far from desiring to learn how\r\nto make and use munitions of war they concentrated their efforts on\r\nmethods of preventing their export to the Allies.\r\n\r\nThe preparedness movement, none the less, spread through the country and\r\nthe influence of the National Security League did much to inform the\r\npublic. In the summer of 1915 there was organized at Plattsburg, New\r\nYork, under the authority of General Wood, a civilian camp designed to\r\ngive some experience in the rudiments of military science. It was not\r\nencouraged by the Administration, but at the end of the year the\r\nPresident himself confessed that he had been converted. He was about to\r\nabandon his policy of isolation for his new ideal of international\r\nservice, and he realized the logical necessity of supporting it by at\r\nleast a show of force. Mere negative \"neutrality\" no longer sufficed. His\r\nfear that greater military strength might lead to an aggressive spirit in\r\nthe country had been obliterated by the attacks of submarines and by the\r\nGerman plots. He admitted frankly that he had changed his mind. \"I would\r\nbe ashamed,\" he said, \"if I had not learned something in fourteen\r\nmonths.\" To the surprise of many who had counted upon his pacific\r\ntendencies to the end, he did what he had not heretofore done for any of\r\nhis policies; he left his desk in Washington and took to the platform.\r\n\r\nDuring January and February, 1916, President Wilson delivered a\r\nsuccession of speeches in Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Chicago, Milwaukee, St.\r\nLouis, and other places in the upper Mississippi Valley, emphasizing his\r\nconversion to preparedness. Aware that his transformation would be\r\nregarded as anti-German and tending to draw the United States into the\r\nconflict, he apparently sought out pro-German and pacifist centers, and\r\nfor the first time utilized something of the traditional \"patriotic\"\r\nstyle to rouse those citizens who, as yet, failed to appreciate the\r\nsignificance of the international situation. \"I know that you are\r\ndepending upon me to keep the nation out of war. So far I have done so,\r\nand I pledge you my word that, God helping me, I will--if it is possible.\r\nYou have laid another duty upon me. You have bidden me see that nothing\r\nstains or impairs the honor of the United States. And that is a matter\r\nnot within my control. That depends upon what others do, not upon what\r\nthe Government of the United States does, and therefore there may be at\r\nany moment a time when I cannot both preserve the honor and the peace of\r\nthe United States. Do not exact of me an impossible and contradictory\r\nthing, but stand ready and insist that everybody that represents you\r\nshould stand ready to provide the means for maintaining the honor of the\r\nUnited States.\" And later: \"America cannot be an ostrich with its head in\r\nthe sand. America cannot shut itself out from the rest of the world....\r\nDo you want the situation to be such that all the President can do is to\r\nwrite messages, to utter words of protest? If these breaches of\r\ninternational law which are in daily danger of occurring should touch the\r\nvery vital interests and honor of the United States, do you wish to do\r\nnothing about it? Do you wish to have all the world say that the flag of\r\nthe United States, which we all love, can be stained with impunity?\" What\r\na transformation from those days of December, 1914, when he believed that\r\nmilitary preparation would prove that the American people had been thrown\r\noff their balance by a war with which they had nothing to do! And what a\r\nrevelation of the wounds inflicted by the barbed taunts cast against the\r\nPresident for his patience in the writing of diplomatic notes!\r\n\r\nHad the President carried his enthusiasm into actual accomplishment and\r\nprovided for effective military and naval preparation, his claim to the\r\ntitle of great statesman would be more clear. Unfortunately when it came\r\nto forcing Congress to take the necessary steps, he failed. The inertia\r\nand reluctance of pacifist or partisan representatives would have been\r\nbroken by Roosevelt. But Wilson did mere lip-service to the principle of\r\nmilitary efficiency. The bills introduced in Congress were denounced by\r\nmilitary experts as half-measures likely to produce no efficient result,\r\nand the President, who in most matters was determined to dominate, in\r\nthis permitted congressional committees to have their way. The protests\r\nof the Secretary of War, Lindley M. Garrison, led to his resignation; and\r\n(most curious development) the President replaced him by a man, Newton D.\r\nBaker, who, whatever his capacity, was generally known as a pacifist.\r\nWilson's intelligence told him that military preparation was necessary,\r\nif his policy of international service was to be anything more than\r\nacademic; but his pacific instincts prevented him from securing real\r\nmilitary efficiency.\r\n\r\nAn example of the unreadiness of the United States was furnished in the\r\nlate spring and summer of 1916, when relations with Mexico became strained\r\nalmost to the breaking point. President Wilson's handling of the knotty\r\nMexican problem had been characteristic. He had temporized in the hope\r\nthat anything like a break might be avoided and was resolutely opposed to\r\nformal armed intervention. But after refusing to recognize Huerta, who had\r\ngained his position of provisional president of Mexico through the murder\r\nof Madero, in which he was evidently implicated, the President had ordered\r\nthe occupation of Vera Cruz by United States troops in retaliation for the\r\narrest of an American landing party and Huerta's refusal to fire an\r\napologetic salute. Huerta was forced to give up his position and fled, but\r\nthe crisis continued and American-Mexican relations were not improved. The\r\ncountry was left in the hands of three rival presidents, of whom Carranza\r\nproved the strongest, and, after an attempt at mediation in which the\r\nthree chief South American powers participated, President Wilson decided\r\nto recognize him. But Mexican conditions remained chaotic and American\r\ninterests in Mexico were either threatened or destroyed. In the spring of\r\n1916 an attack on American territory led by a bandit, Francisco Villa,\r\nagain roused Wilson to action. He dispatched General John J. Pershing\r\nacross the border to pursue and catch Villa. The expedition was difficult,\r\nbut well-conducted; it extended far south of the frontier and provoked the\r\nprotests of Carranza. At the moment when Pershing's advance guard seemed\r\nto have its hands on the bandit, orders were given to cease the pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe opponents of the Administration had some excuse for laughing at the\r\n\"inglorious and ineffectual war\" thus waged. It had failed to result in\r\nthe capture of Villa and it gave rise to serious danger of an open break\r\nwith Mexico. On the 21st of June an attack at Carrizal by Carranza's\r\ntroops resulted in the capture of some United States cavalrymen and the\r\nmobilization of the national guard troops for the protection of the\r\nborder. But President Wilson was not to be drawn into intervention. He\r\nmight be compelled to exercise force in carrying out his ideals of\r\ninternational service against an international criminal like Germany; he\r\nwould not use it against a weaker neighbor and particularly at the moment\r\nwhen the United States must be free to face European complications. But\r\nthe Mexican crisis proved definitely the weakness of the military system.\r\nThough the regulars who accompanied Pershing proved their worth, the\r\nclumsy inefficient mobilization of the National Guard, on the other hand,\r\nindicated as plainly as possible the lack of trained troops and officers.\r\n\r\nThe President's determination not to intervene in Mexico probably assured\r\nhim many votes in the pacifist regions of the Middle West in the\r\npresidential election of 1916. That he would be renominated by the\r\nDemocrats was a foregone conclusion. He had alienated the machine leaders\r\nby his strict domination of Congress and the party; if he had permitted\r\ncertain political leaders to distribute offices for necessary organization\r\ninterests, he had seen to it, none the less, that the Democratic bosses\r\nhad no share in the determination of policies. Still they could not hope\r\nto prevent his nomination. Whatever chance the party might have in the\r\ncoming election lay in the personal strength of Wilson with the masses. In\r\nthe South and the districts west of the Mississippi he was regarded as the\r\ngreatest Democrat since Jackson. His patience in dealing with Germany, as\r\nwith Carranza, convinced them of his desire for peace; the slogan, \"He has\r\nkept us out of war,\" was a powerful argument in those regions. His\r\nattitude towards labor had been friendly, so that the support of the\r\nunions in the large industrial centers might be expected. Placards were\r\nposted showing a poor man's family with the caption, \"He has protected me\r\nand mine,\" in answer to the Republican posters which showed a widow and\r\norphans (presumably of a drowned American citizen) and the caption, \"He\r\nhas neglected me and mine.\" The remnants of the Progressives, who were not\r\npurely Roosevelt supporters, were attracted by Wilson's legislative\r\nprogramme and record of accomplishment. He could look to an independent\r\nvote such as no other Democrat could hope for.\r\n\r\nDespite this strength, the Republican leaders, if they could succeed in\r\neffecting a reunion of their party, awaited the results of the election\r\nwith confidence. They counted chiefly upon the personal unpopularity of\r\nWilson on the Atlantic seaboard and the normal Republican vote in the\r\nindustrial centers of the Middle West. His foreign policy, east of the\r\nMississippi, was generally looked upon as anæmic and nebulous. He had\r\npermitted, so the Republicans contended, the honor of the country to be\r\nstained and Americans to be destroyed, without effective action. His\r\nearly opposition to preparedness and the half-hearted measures of army\r\nreform had proved his weakness, at least to the satisfaction of\r\nRepublican stump orators. He had won the hearty dislike of the bankers,\r\nthe manufacturers, and the merchants by his attacks on capitalist\r\ninterests and by his support of labor unions. The Clayton Act, which\r\nexempted strikes from Federal injunctions, and the Adamson Act, which\r\ngranted, under threat, the immediate demands of the striking railroad\r\nemployees, were cited as clear proof of his demagogic character.\r\nFurthermore, while he alienated the pro-Entente elements in New England\r\nand the Eastern States, he had drawn upon himself the hatred of the\r\nGerman-Americans by his attacks upon hyphenates and his refusal to accept\r\nan embargo on American munitions.\r\n\r\nHad the Republicans been willing to accept Theodore Roosevelt, victory\r\nwould probably have come to them. He alone could have gathered in the\r\nProgressive and independent vote, and that of the Pacific coast, which\r\nultimately went to Wilson. But the Old Guard of the Republicans refused\r\nto consider Roosevelt; they could not take a man who had broken party\r\nlines four years before; above all they wanted a \"safe and sane\"\r\nPresident, who would play the political game according to rule--the rule\r\nof the bosses--and they knew that were Roosevelt elected they could not\r\nhope to share in the spoils. The Republican convention ultimately settled\r\nupon Charles E. Hughes, who certainly was not beloved by the bosses, but\r\nwho was regarded as \"steadier\" than Roosevelt. The latter, in order to\r\ndefeat Wilson, refused the offer of the Progressives, practically\r\ndisbanded the party he had created, and called upon his friends to return\r\nwith him to their first allegiance.\r\n\r\nHughes did not prove a strong candidate. Whereas Wilson had stated his\r\nposition on the German-American problem plainly, \"I neither seek the\r\nfavor nor fear the displeasure of that small alien element among us which\r\nputs loyalty to any foreign power before loyalty to the United States,\"\r\nHughes was ordered by his party managers not to offend foreign-born\r\nvoters, and in his attempt to steer a middle course, gave a clear\r\nimpression of vacillation. Many of those who had been most thoroughly\r\ndisgusted with Wilson turned back to him again, as the weeks passed and\r\nHughes more and more sought refuge in vague generalizations. In a\r\ncampaign in which the issues were largely personal the Republican\r\ncandidate's failure to evolve a constructive policy greatly weakened him,\r\nespecially as Wilson had the advantage of the maxim that it is best not\r\nto change horses in the middle of the stream. Finally, Hughes did not\r\nprove adept in reconciling the Progressives. Indeed it was said to be a\r\npolitical _gaucherie_ on his part, or that of his advisers, which\r\nalienated the friends of Governor Hiram Johnson of California and threw\r\nthe electoral vote of that State to Wilson.\r\n\r\nCalifornia turned the scale. When on the evening of the 7th of November\r\nthe first returns came in and it was seen that Wilson had lost New York\r\nand Illinois, the election of Hughes was generally conceded. Even the\r\n_New York Times_ and the _World_ admitted Wilson's defeat. But the next\r\nmorning, news from the west indicated that the President still had a\r\nchance. Later in the day the chance grew larger; he had won Ohio;\r\nMinnesota and California were doubtful. In both States voting was close;\r\nif Wilson won either the election would be his. It was not until the 11th\r\nof November that the returns from California definitely showed a small\r\nWilson plurality, and only on the 21st that the Republicans finally\r\nabandoned hope. Wilson had secured 277 electoral votes to 254 for\r\nHughes. He had been saved by the pacifist Middle and Far West, in\r\ncombination with the South. But the victory meant something far different\r\nfrom peace at any price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nAMERICA DECIDES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presidential campaign of 1916, taken in conjunction with the\r\nincreasing tension of European relations, forced Wilson to a further\r\ndevelopment of his international ideals and a more definite formulation of\r\nthe means by which to attain them. As we have observed, the spring of that\r\nyear saw him reject the doctrine of isolation. \"We are participants,\" he\r\nsaid on the 27th of May, \"whether we would or not, in the life of the\r\nworld. The interests of all nations are our own also. We are partners with\r\nthe rest. What affects mankind is inevitably our affair as well as the\r\naffair of the nations of Europe and of Asia.\" This recognition of our\r\ninterest in world affairs immediately took him considerably beyond the\r\nposition he had assumed during the earlier stages of the submarine\r\ncontroversy. Until the spring of 1916 he had restricted his aims to the\r\nchampionship of neutral and human rights in time of war. But now he began\r\nto demand something more far-reaching, namely a system that would prevent\r\nunjust war altogether and would protect the rights of all peoples in time\r\nof peace. He insisted, in this same speech of the 27th of May, before the\r\nLeague to Enforce Peace at Washington, \"First that every people has a\r\nright to choose the sovereignty under which they shall live.... Second,\r\nthat the small states of the world have a right to enjoy the same respect\r\nfor their sovereignty and for their territorial integrity that great and\r\npowerful nations expect and insist upon. And, third, that the world has a\r\nright to be free from every disturbance of its peace that has its origin\r\nin aggression and disregard of the rights of peoples and nations.\" These\r\nwords sum up the gist of his international aims during the three following\r\nyears. His later speeches are merely refinement of details.\r\n\r\nIn order that these ends might be secured it was necessary that some\r\ninternational system be inaugurated other than that which had permitted\r\nthe selfishness of the great powers to produce war in the past. In his\r\nsearch for a concrete mechanism to realize his ideals and secure them\r\nfrom violation, Wilson seized upon the essential principles of the\r\nLeague to Enforce Peace, of which William Howard Taft was president. The\r\nbasis of permanent peace, Wilson insisted, could be found only by\r\nsubstituting international coöperation in place of conflict, through a\r\nmobilization of the public opinion of the world against international\r\nlawbreakers: \"an universal association of the nations to maintain the\r\ninviolate security of the highway of the seas for the common and\r\nunhindered use of all the nations of the world, and to prevent any war\r\nbegun either contrary to treaty covenants or without warning and full\r\nsubmission of the causes to the opinion of the world--a virtual guarantee\r\nof territorial integrity and political independence.\" These were the\r\nprinciples and methods which formed the keynote of his foreign policy\r\nuntil the end of the Peace Conference. The first part of the programme,\r\nthat which concerned the security of the seas and which originated in the\r\nparticular circumstances of 1915, faded from his sight to a large extent;\r\nthe second portion, more general in its nature, became of increasing\r\nimportance until, as Article X of the League Covenant, it seemed to him\r\nthe heart of the entire settlement.\r\n\r\nThe unselfish nature of his idealism, as well as his continued detachment\r\nfrom both camps of the belligerents, was obvious. \"We have nothing\r\nmaterial of any kind to ask for ourselves,\" he said, \"and are quite aware\r\nthat we are in no sense or degree parties to the present quarrel. Our\r\ninterest is only in peace and in its future guarantees.\" But _noblesse\r\noblige_, and we must serve those who have not had our good fortune. \"The\r\ncommands of democracy are as imperative as its privileges are wide and\r\ngenerous. Its compulsion is upon us.... We are not worthy to stand here\r\nunless we ourselves be in deed and truth real democrats and servants of\r\nmankind.\"\r\n\r\nThat the United States might be drawn into the conflict evidently seemed\r\npossible to the President, despite pacific whispers that came from\r\nGermany in the spring and summer of 1916. There was a note of\r\napprehension in his speeches. No one could tell when the extremist\r\nfaction in Berlin might gain control and withdraw the _Sussex_ pledge.\r\nThe temper of Americans was being tried by continued sinkings, although\r\nthe exact circumstances of each case were difficult to determine. The\r\nattacks made by the German U-53 immediately off the American coast and\r\nthe deportation of Belgian civilians into Germany made more difficult the\r\npreservation of amicable relations. In view of the possibility of war\r\nWilson wanted to define the issue exactly. \"We have never yet,\" he said\r\nat Omaha, a peace center, on the 5th of October, \"sufficiently formulated\r\nour programme for America with regard to the part she is going to play in\r\nthe world, and it is imperative that she should formulate it at once....\r\nIt is very important that the statesmen of other parts of the world\r\nshould understand America.... We are holding off, not because we do not\r\nfeel concerned, but because when we exert the force of this nation we\r\nwant to know what we are exerting it for.\" Ten days later at Shadowlawn\r\nhe said: \"Define the elements, let us know that we are not fighting for\r\nthe prevalence of this nation over that, for the ambitions of this group\r\nof nations as compared with the ambitions of that group of nations; let\r\nus once be convinced that we are called in to a great combination to\r\nfight for the rights of mankind and America will unite her force and\r\nspill her blood for the great things which she has always believed in and\r\nfollowed.\" He thus gave warning that the United States might have to\r\nfight. He wanted to be certain, however, that it did not fight as so many\r\nother nations have fought, greedily or vindictively, but rather as in a\r\ncrusade and for clearly defined ideals.\r\n\r\nHis reëlection gave to the President an opportunity for bringing before\r\nthe world his international aims. He purposed not merely to end the\r\nexisting conflict but also to provide a basis for permanent peace and the\r\nsecurity of democracy. During the early summer of 1916 he had received\r\nfrom Berlin hints that his mediation would not be unacceptable and it is\r\npossible that he planned at that time new efforts to bring the war to a\r\nclose. But such a step was bound to be regarded as pro-German and in the\r\nstate of opinion immediately after the _Sussex_ crisis would have\r\nproduced a storm of American protests. Then the entrance of Rumania into\r\nthe war so encouraged the Entente powers that there seemed little chance\r\nof winning French and British acceptance of mediation. The presidential\r\nelection further delayed any overt step towards peace negotiations.\r\nFinally the wave of anti-German feeling that swept the United States in\r\nNovember, on account of Belgian deportations, induced Wilson to hold back\r\nthe note which he had already drafted. But it was important not to delay\r\nhis pacific efforts over-long, since news came to Washington that unless\r\nGermany could obtain a speedy peace the extremist group in Berlin would\r\ninsist upon a resumption of \"ruthless\" submarine warfare. In these\r\ncircumstances, early in December, the President prepared to issue his\r\nnote.\r\n\r\nBut Germany acted more rapidly. Warned of Wilson's purpose the Berlin\r\nGovernment, on December 12, 1916, proposed negotiations. The occasion\r\nseemed to them propitious. Rumania had gone down to disastrous defeat.\r\nRussia was torn by corruption and popular discontent. On the western\r\nfront, if the Germans had failed at Verdun, they were aware of the deep\r\ndisappointment of the Allies at the paltry results of the great Somme\r\ndrive. German morale at home was weakening; but if the Allies could be\r\npictured as refusing all terms and determined upon the destruction of\r\nGermany, the people would doubtless agree to the unrestricted use of the\r\nsubmarine as purely defensive in character, even if it brought to the\r\nAllies the questionable assistance of America. The German note itself\r\ncontained no definite terms. But its boastful tone permitted the\r\ninterpretation that Germany would consider no peace which did not leave\r\nCentral and Southeastern Europe under Teuton domination; the specific\r\nterms later communicated to the American Government in secret, verified\r\nthis suspicion. A thinly veiled threat to neutral nations was to be read\r\nbetween the lines of the German suggestion of negotiations.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was obvious that he would be accused of acting in collusion\r\nwith Germany, President Wilson decided not to postpone the peace note\r\nalready planned. He looked upon the crisis as serious, for if peace were\r\nnot secured at this time the chances of the United States remaining out\r\nof the war were constantly growing less. If he could compel a clear\r\ndefinition of war aims on both sides, the mutual suspicion of the warring\r\npeoples might be removed; the German people might perceive that the war\r\nwas not in reality for them one of defense; or finally the Allies, toward\r\nwhom Wilson was being driven by the threats of German extremists, might\r\ndefine their position in such terms as would justify him before the world\r\nin joining with them in a conflict not waged for selfish national\r\npurposes but for the welfare of humanity. Issued on December 18, 1916,\r\nhis note summed up the chief points of his recently developed policy. It\r\nemphasized the interest of the United States in the future peace of the\r\nworld, the irreparable injury to civilization that might result from a\r\nfurther continuance of the existing struggle, the advantages that would\r\nfollow an explicit exposure of belligerent purposes, and the possibility\r\nof making \"the permanent concord of the nations a hope of the immediate\r\nfuture, a concert of nations immediately practicable.\"\r\n\r\nAs a step towards peace the note was unsuccessful. Germany was evasive.\r\nThere was nothing her Government wanted less than the definite exposure\r\nof her purposes that Wilson asked. Her leaders were anxious to begin\r\nnegotiations while German armies still held conquered territories as\r\npawns to be used at the peace table. They would not discuss a League of\r\nNations until Germany's continental position was secured. The Allies on\r\nthe other hand would not make peace with an unbeaten Germany, which\r\nevidently persisted in the hope of dominating weaker nationalities and\r\nsaid no word of reparations for the acknowledged wrongs committed.\r\nFeeling ran high in England and France because Wilson's note had seemed\r\nto place the belligerents on the same moral plane, in its statement that\r\nthe objects on both sides \"are virtually the same, as stated in general\r\nterms to their own people and to the world.\" The statement was verbally\r\naccurate and rang with a certain grim irony which may have touched\r\nWilson's sense of humor. But the Allies were not in a state of mind to\r\nappreciate such humor. Their official answer, however, was frank, and in\r\nsubstance accepted the principles of permanent peace propounded by\r\nWilson. It was evident to most Americans that the main purpose of Germany\r\nwas to establish herself as the dominating power of the continent and\r\npossibly of the world; the aim of the Allies, on the other hand, seemed\r\nto be the peace of the world based upon democracy and justice rather than\r\nmaterial force.\r\n\r\nThe President's attempt thus cleared the air. It made plain to the\r\nmajority of Americans that in sympathy, at least, the United States must\r\nbe definitely aligned with Great Britain and France. Furthermore the\r\nreplies of the belligerents gave to Wilson an opportunity to inform the\r\nworld more definitely of the aims of the United States, in case it should\r\nbe drawn into the war. This he did in a speech delivered to the Senate on\r\nJanuary 22, 1917. America would play her part in world affairs, he said,\r\nbut the other nations must clearly understand the conditions of our\r\nparticipation. The basis of peace must be the right of each individual\r\nnation to decide its destiny for itself without interference from a\r\nstronger alien power. \"I am proposing as it were, that the nations should\r\nwith one accord adopt the doctrine of President Monroe as the doctrine of\r\nthe world: that no nation should seek to extend its polity over any\r\nother nation or people, but that every people should be left free to\r\ndetermine its own polity, its own way of development, unhindered,\r\nunthreatened, unafraid, the little along with the great and powerful.\"\r\nInstead of the old system of alliances there should be a general concert\r\nof powers: \"There is no entangling alliance in a concert of powers. When\r\nall unite to act in the same sense and with the same purpose, all act in\r\nthe common interest and are free to live their own lives under a common\r\nprotection.\" As the result of such a concert no one power would dominate\r\nthe sea or the land; armaments might safely be limited; peace would be\r\norganized by the major force of mankind. As a guarantee of future justice\r\nand tranquillity the terms that settled the present war must be based\r\nupon justice and not be of the sort ordinarily dictated by the victor to\r\nthe vanquished. It must be a \"peace without victory.\" Thus while Wilson\r\nwarned Germany that her ambitions for continental domination would not be\r\ntolerated, he also warned the Allies that they could not count upon the\r\nUnited States to help them to crush Germany for their selfish individual\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThis speech, despite the unfortunate phrase, \"peace without victory,\" was\r\nhailed in all liberal circles, amongst the Allies and in the United\r\nStates, as a noble charter of the new international order. Wilson had\r\nexpressed the hope that he was \"speaking for the silent mass of mankind\r\neverywhere who have as yet had no place or opportunity to speak their real\r\nhearts out concerning the death and ruin they see to have come already\r\nupon the persons and the homes they hold most dear.\" This hope was\r\ndoubtless realized. The first reaction in France and England was one of\r\nrather puzzled contempt, if we may judge by the press. But the newspaper\r\nwriters soon found that what Wilson said many people had been thinking,\r\nand waiting for some one to say. Hall Caine wrote to the _Public Ledger_,\r\n\"Let President Wilson take heart from the first reception of his\r\nremarkable speech. The best opinion here is one of deep feeling and\r\nprofound admiration.\" From that moment Wilson began to approach the\r\nposition he was shortly to hold--that of moral leader of the world.\r\n\r\nThe President had been anxious to make plain his principles, before the\r\nUnited States became involved in the conflict through the withdrawal of\r\nGerman submarine pledges, as well as to convince the world that every\r\nhonest effort possible had been made to preserve the peace. He was only\r\njust in time. Already the advocates of ruthlessness in Berlin had\r\npersuaded the Kaiser and Bethmann-Hollweg. They recognized that the\r\nresumption of unrestricted submarine warfare meant, in all probability,\r\nthe intervention of the United States, but they recked little of the\r\nconsequences. On January 16, 1917, the Kaiser telegraphed: \"If a break\r\nwith America is unavoidable, it cannot be helped; we proceed.\" The same\r\nday the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Zimmermann, telegraphed to the\r\nGerman Minister in Mexico, instructing him to form an alliance with\r\nMexico in the event of war between Germany and the United States, and to\r\noffer as bribe the States of New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas; he also\r\nsuggested the possibility of winning Japan from her allegiance to the\r\nEntente and persuading her to enter this prospective alliance.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of January, von Bernstorff threw off the mask. The German\r\nAmbassador informed our Government of the withdrawal of the _Sussex_\r\npledge. On and after the 1st of February, German submarines would sink on\r\nsight all ships met within a delimited zone around the British Isles and\r\nin the Mediterranean. They would permit the sailing of a few American\r\nsteamships, however, provided they followed a certain defined route to\r\nFalmouth and nowhere else, and provided there were marked \"on ship's hull\r\nand superstructure three vertical stripes one meter wide, to be painted\r\nalternately white and red. Each mast should show a large flag checkered\r\nwhite and red, and the stern the American national flag. Care should be\r\ntaken that during dark, national flag and painted marks are easily\r\nrecognizable from a distance, and that the boats are well lighted\r\nthroughout.\" Other conditions followed. There might sail one steamship a\r\nweek \"in each direction, with arrival at Falmouth on Sunday and departure\r\nfrom Falmouth on Wednesday.\" Furthermore the United States Government\r\nmust guarantee \"that no contraband (according to the German contraband\r\nlist) is carried by those steamships.\" Such were the orders issued to the\r\nUnited States. No native American could escape the humor of the\r\nstipulations, which for a moment prevented the national irritation from\r\nswelling into an outburst of deep-seated wrath.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been little hesitation on the part of the President.\r\nOn April 19, 1916, he had warned Germany that unrestricted submarine\r\nwarfare meant a severance of diplomatic relations. Now, on February 3,\r\n1917, addressing both houses of Congress, he announced that those\r\nrelations had been broken. Von Bernstorff was given his papers and the\r\nAmerican Ambassador, James W. Gerard, was recalled from Berlin. No other\r\ncourse of action could have been contemplated in view of the formality of\r\nthe President's warning and the definiteness of Germany's defiance.\r\nDespite the protests of scattered pacifists, the country was as nearly a\r\nunit in its approval of Wilson's action as its heterogeneous national\r\ncharacter permitted. All the pent-up emotions of the past two years found\r\nexpression in quiet but unmistakable applause at the departure of the\r\nGerman Ambassador.\r\n\r\nThe promptitude of the President's dismissal of von Bernstorff did not\r\nconceal the disappointment which he experienced from Germany's revelation\r\nof her true purposes. He seems to have hoped to the end that the German\r\nliberals would succeed in bringing their Government to accept moderate\r\nterms of peace. Even now he expressed the hope that Germany's actions\r\nwould not be such as to force the United States into the War: \"I refuse\r\nto believe that it is the intention of the German authorities to do in\r\nfact what they have warned us they will feel at liberty to do.... Only\r\nactual overt acts on their part can make me believe it even now.\" But\r\n\"if American ships and American lives should in fact be sacrificed by\r\ntheir naval commanders in heedless contravention of the just and\r\nreasonable understandings of international law and the obvious dictates\r\nof humanity, I shall take the liberty of coming again before the Congress\r\nto ask that authority be given me to use any means that may be necessary\r\nfor the protection of our seamen and our people in the prosecution of\r\ntheir peaceful and legitimate errands on the high seas. I can do nothing\r\nless. I take it for granted that all neutral governments will take the\r\nsame course.\" He was careful, moreover, to underline the fact that his\r\naction was dictated always by a consistent desire for peace: \"We wish to\r\nserve no selfish ends. We seek merely to stand true alike in thought and\r\nin action to the immemorial principles of our people.... These are the\r\nbases of peace, not war. God grant we may not be challenged to defend\r\nthem by acts of willful injustice on the part of the Government of\r\nGermany!\"\r\n\r\nBut Germany proceeded heedlessly. Warned that American intervention would\r\nresult only from overt acts, the German Admiralty hastened to commit such\r\nacts. From the 3d of February to the 1st of April, eight American vessels\r\nwere sunk by submarines and forty-eight American lives thus lost.\r\nBecause of the practical blockade of American ports which followed the\r\nhesitation of American shipping interests to send boats unarmed into the\r\ndangers of the \"war zone,\" President Wilson came again to Congress on the\r\n26th of February to ask authority to arm merchant vessels for purposes of\r\ndefense. Again he stressed his unwillingness to enter upon formal warfare\r\nand emphasized the idealistic aspect of the issue: \"It is not of material\r\ninterests merely that we are thinking. It is, rather, of fundamental\r\nhuman rights, chief of all the right of life itself. I am thinking not\r\nonly of the rights of Americans to go and come about their proper\r\nbusiness by way of the sea, but also of something much deeper, much more\r\nfundamental than that. I am thinking of those rights of humanity without\r\nwhich there is no civilization.... I cannot imagine any man with American\r\nprinciples at his heart hesitating to defend these things.\"\r\n\r\nBlinded by prejudice and tradition, a handful of Senators, twelve\r\n\"willful men,\" as Wilson described them, blocked, through a filibuster,\r\nthe resolution granting the power requested by the President. But the\r\nstorm of popular obloquy which covered them proved that the nation as a\r\nwhole was determined to support him in the defense of American rights.\r\nThe country was stirred to the depths. The publication of the plans of\r\nGermany for involving the United States in war with Mexico and Japan came\r\nmerely as added stimulus. So also of the story of the cruelties heaped by\r\nthe Germans on the American prisoners of the _Yarrowdale_. There was so\r\nmuch of justice in the cause that passion was notable by its absence.\r\nWhen finally on the 17th of March news came of the torpedoing of the\r\n_Vigilancia_ without warning, America was prepared and calmly eager for\r\nthe President's demand that Congress recognize the existence of a state\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nThe demand was made by Wilson in an extraordinary joint session of\r\nCongress, held on the 2d of April. In this, possibly his greatest speech,\r\nhe was careful not to blur the idealistic principles which, since the\r\nspring of 1916, he had been formulating. War existed because Germany by\r\nits actions had thrust upon the United States the status of belligerent.\r\nBut the American people must meet the challenge with their purpose\r\nclearly before them. \"We must put excited feeling away. Our motive will\r\nnot be revenge or the victorious assertion of the physical might of the\r\nnation, but only the vindication of right, of human right, of which we\r\nare only a single champion.... The wrongs against which we now array\r\nourselves are no common wrongs; they cut to the very roots of human\r\nlife.\" He went on to define the objects of the war more specifically,\r\nreferring to his earlier addresses: \"Our object now, as then, is to\r\nvindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as\r\nagainst selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really\r\nfree and self-governed peoples of the world such a concert of purpose and\r\naction as will henceforth ensure the observance of those principles.\"\r\nDemocracy must be the soul of the new international order: \"A steadfast\r\nconcert for peace can never be maintained except by a partnership of\r\ndemocratic nations. No autocratic government could be trusted to keep\r\nfaith within it or observe its covenants.... Only free peoples can hold\r\ntheir purpose and their honor steady to a common end and prefer the\r\ninterests of mankind to any narrow interest of their own.\" Because the\r\nexisting German Government was clearly at odds with all such ideals, \"We\r\nare glad, now that we see the facts with no veil of false pretense about\r\nthem, to fight thus for the ultimate peace of the world and for the\r\nliberation of its peoples, the German people included: for the rights of\r\nnations great and small and the privilege of men everywhere to choose\r\ntheir way of life and of obedience. The world must be made safe for\r\ndemocracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of\r\npolitical liberty.\"\r\n\r\nWilson thus imagined the war as a crusade, the sort of crusade for\r\nAmerican ideals which Clay and Webster once imagined. He was in truth\r\noriginating nothing, but rather resuscitating the generous dreams which\r\nhad once inspired those statesmen. In conclusion, he reiterated his love\r\nof peace. \"But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight\r\nfor the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts,--for\r\ndemocracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice\r\nin their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations,\r\nfor a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as\r\nshall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at\r\nlast free.\" At the moment of the declaration of war Wilson was still the\r\nman of peace, and the war upon which the nation was embarking was, in his\r\nmind, a war to ensure peace. To such a task of peace and liberation, he\r\nconcluded in a peroration reminiscent of Lincoln and Luther, \"we can\r\ndedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and\r\neverything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day\r\nhas come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for\r\nthe principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she\r\nhas treasured. God helping her, she can do no other.\"\r\n\r\nHow many Americans caught the real significance of Wilson's thought with\r\nall its consequences is doubtful. The country certainly looked upon the\r\nwar as a crusade. But there was in the national emotion much that did not\r\naccord with the ideals of Wilson. The people hated Germany for the\r\nsinking of the _Lusitania_ and all the other submarine outrages, for her\r\ncrimes in Belgium, for the plots and explosions in this country, for the\r\nZimmermann note, and finally for her direct and insulting defiance of\r\nAmerican rights. They recognized that the Allies were fighting for\r\ncivilization; they sympathized with the democracies of Europe, of which,\r\nsince the Russian revolution of March, the Allied camp was composed, and\r\nthey wanted to help them. They feared for America's safety in the future,\r\nif Germany won the war. Most Americans entered the struggle, therefore,\r\nwith a sober gladness, based partly on emotional, partly on quixotic, and\r\npartly on selfish grounds. But nearly all fought rather to beat Germany\r\nthan to secure a new international order. Hence it was that after Germany\r\nwas beaten, Wilson was destined to discover that his idealistic preaching\r\nhad not fully penetrated, and that he had failed to educate his country,\r\nas completely as he believed, to the ideal of a partnership of democratic\r\nand peace-loving peoples as the essential condition of a new and safe\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE NATION IN ARMS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Congress declared that the United States was in a state of war with\r\nGermany, on April 6, 1917, the public opinion of the country was unified\r\nto a far greater extent than at the beginning of any previous war. The\r\nextreme patience displayed by President Wilson had its reward. When the\r\nyear opened the majority of citizens doubtless still hoped that peace was\r\npossible. But German actions in February and March had gone far towards\r\nthe education of the popular mind, and the final speeches of the President\r\ncrystallized conviction. By April there were few Americans, except those\r\nin whom pacifism was a mania, who were not convinced that war with Germany\r\nwas the only course consistent with either honor or safety. It is probable\r\nthat many did not understand exactly the ideals that actuated Wilson, but\r\nnine persons out of ten believed it absolutely necessary to fight.\r\n\r\nBut, however firmly united, the country was completely unprepared for war\r\nin a military sense, and must now pay the penalty for President Wilson's\r\nopposition to adequate improvement of the military system in 1915 and for\r\nthe half-hearted measures taken in 1916. Total military forces, including\r\nregular army, national guard, and reserves amounted to hardly three\r\nhundred thousand men and less than ten thousand officers. Even the regular\r\narmy was by no means ready for immediate participation in the sort of\r\nfighting demanded by the European war; and, even if adequate troops were\r\nraised, the lack of trained officers would create the most serious\r\ndifficulties. No wonder that the German General Staff ranked the United\r\nStates, from the military point of view, somewhere between Belgium and\r\nPortugal. Furthermore, military experts had been discouraged by the\r\nattitude of the Administration. The Secretary of War, Newton D. Baker, had\r\nfailed, either through lack of administrative capacity or because of\r\npacifistic tendencies, to prepare his department adequately. He had done\r\nnothing to rouse Congress or the nation from its attitude of indifference\r\ntowards preparation. By faith a pacifist, he had been opposed to universal\r\nmilitary service. An extreme liberal, he distrusted the professional\r\nmilitary type and was to find it difficult to coöperate with the captains\r\nof industry whose assistance was essential.\r\n\r\nThus with a President and War Secretary, both of whom had been\r\ninstinctively opposed to a large army and who had expressed their fear of\r\nthe development of a militaristic spirit, and with a majority in Congress\r\nfavoring the traditional volunteer system, adherence to which had cost\r\nthe British thousands of lives that might better have been used at home,\r\nthe building of an effective army seemed a matter of extreme doubt. Great\r\ncredit must go to both President Wilson and Secretary Baker for sinking\r\ntheir natural instincts and seeking, as well as following, the advice of\r\nthe military experts, who alone were capable of meeting the problems that\r\narose from a war for which the nation was not prepared.\r\n\r\nThe President must face not only the special problems caused by\r\nunreadiness, but also the general difficulties which confront every\r\nAmerican war-President and which had tried nearly to the breaking-point\r\neven the capacity of Lincoln. The President of the United States in time\r\nof war is given the supreme unified command of the army and navy. But\r\nwhile the responsibility is his, actual control often rests in the hands\r\nof others. Members of Congress always take a keen interest in army\r\nmatters; many of them have been or are militia-men. They have always\r\nopposed a single army which could be recruited, trained, and operated as\r\na unit, and approved the system of State militia which makes for\r\ndecentralization and gives to the separate States large influence in the\r\nformation of military policy. Even the President's control of the Federal\r\narmy, regulars and volunteers, is limited by the decentralized\r\norganization of the different army bureaus, which depend upon Congress\r\nfor their appropriations and which operate as almost independent and\r\nfrequently competing units. The creation of a single programme for the\r\narmy as a whole is thus a task of extreme difficulty.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson, as historian, was well aware of the tremendous price\r\nthat had been paid in past wars for such decentralization, accompanied as\r\nit was, inevitably, by delays, misunderstandings, and mistakes. He was\r\ndetermined to create a single coördinating command, and his war policies\r\nwere governed from beginning to end by this purpose. He set up no new\r\nmachinery, but utilized as his main instrument the General Staff, which\r\nhad been created in 1903 as a result of the blunders and confusion that\r\nhad been so painfully manifest in the Spanish War. When the United States\r\nentered the World War the General Staff had by no means acquired the\r\nimportance expected by those who had created it.[3] But to it the\r\nPresident turned, and it was this body enlarged in size and influence\r\nthat ultimately put into operation Wilson's policy of centralization. It\r\nwas in accordance with the advice of the men who composed the General\r\nStaff that the President elaborated the larger lines of the military\r\nprogramme, and they were the men who supervised the operation of details.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: In April, 1917, the General Staff consisted of fifty-one\r\nofficers, only nineteen of whom were on duty in Washington. Of these,\r\neight were occupied with routine business, leaving but eleven free for\r\nthe real purpose for which the staff had been created--\"the study of\r\nmilitary problems, the preparation of plans for national defense, and\r\nutilization of the military forces in time of war.\"]\r\n\r\nNone of the processes which marked the transition of the United States\r\nfrom a peace to a war basis are comprehensible unless we remember that\r\nthe President was constantly working to overcome the forces of\r\ndecentralization, and also that the military programme was always on an\r\nemergency basis, shifting almost from week to week in accordance with\r\ndevelopments in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe original programme did not provide for an expeditionary force in\r\nFrance. During the early days of participation in the war it was generally\r\nbelieved that the chief contributions of the United States to Allied\r\nvictory would not be directly upon the fighting front. If the United\r\nStates concentrated its efforts upon financing the Allies, furnishing them\r\nwith food, shipping, and the munitions which had been promised--so many\r\npersons argued--it would be doing far better than if it weakened\r\nassistance of that sort by attempting to set up and maintain a large\r\nfighting force of its own. The impression was unfortunately prevalent in\r\ncivilian circles that Germany was on her last legs, and that the outcome\r\nof the war would be favorably settled before the United States could put\r\nan effective army in the field. Military experts, on the other hand, more\r\nthoroughly convinced of German strength, believed that the final campaigns\r\ncould not come before the summer of 1919, and did not expect to provide a\r\ngreat expeditionary force previous to the spring of that year if indeed it\r\nwere ever sent. Thus from opposite points of view the amateur and the\r\nprofessional deprecated haste in dispatching an army to France. From the\r\nmoment the United States entered the war, President Wilson certainly\r\nseems to have resolved upon the preparation of an effective fighting\r\nforce, if we may judge from his insistence upon the selective draft,\r\nalthough he did not expect that it would be used abroad. But it may be\r\nasked whether he did not hope for the arrangement of a negotiated peace,\r\nwhich if not \"without victory\" would at least leave Germany uncrushed. It\r\nis probable that he did not yet perceive that \"force to the utmost\" would\r\nbe necessary before peace could be secured; that realization was to come\r\nonly in the dark days of 1918.\r\n\r\nA few weeks after America's declaration of war, however, France and Great\r\nBritain dispatched missions led by Balfour, Viviani, and Joffre, to\r\nrequest earnestly that at least a small American force be sent overseas\r\nat once for the moral effect upon dispirited France. The plea determined\r\nthe President to send General Pershing immediately with a force of about\r\ntwo thousand, who were followed in June and July, 1917, by sufficient\r\nadditional forces to make up a division. Wilson had been authorized by\r\nCongress, under the Selective Service Act, to send four volunteer\r\ndivisions abroad under the command of Roosevelt. But he refused to\r\ninterfere with the plans of the military experts, who strongly objected\r\nto any volunteer forces whatever. Neither the valiant ex-President nor\r\nthe prospective volunteers were trained for the warfare of the moment,\r\nand their presence in France would bring no practical good to the Allied\r\ncause; moreover the officers whom Roosevelt requested were sorely needed\r\nin American training camps.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pershing, to whom was now entrusted the military fortunes of the\r\nAmerican army abroad, was an officer fifty-seven years old, who had\r\nundergone wide military and administrative experience in Cuba and the\r\nPhilippines; he had been given extraordinary promotion by President\r\nRoosevelt, who had jumped him from the rank of captain to that of\r\nBrigadier General; and he had been selected to lead the punitive force\r\ndispatched in pursuit of Villa in the spring of 1916. Distinguished in\r\nappearance, with superb carriage, thin lips, and squarely-chiselled chin,\r\nhe possessed military gifts of a sound rather than brilliant character. A\r\nstrict disciplinarian, he failed to win from his troops that affection\r\nwhich the _poilus_ gave to Pétain, while he never displayed the genius\r\nthat compelled universal admiration for Foch. Neither ultimate success\r\nnor the stories of his dramatic remarks (as at the grave of La Fayette:\r\n\"La Fayette, we are here!\") succeeded in investing him with the heroic\r\nhalo that ought to come to a victorious commander. As time passes,\r\nhowever, Pershing takes higher rank. His insistence upon soldierly\r\nqualities, his unyielding determination to create American armies under\r\nan independent command, his skill in building up a great organization,\r\nhis successful operations at St. Mihiel and in the Meuse-Argonne drive,\r\ndespite faulty staff work--all these facts become more plain as we\r\nacquire perspective. If historians refuse to recognize him as a great\r\ngeneral, they will surely describe his talents as more than adequate to\r\nthe exigencies of the military situation.\r\n\r\nThe sending of the Pershing expedition did not at once alter\r\nfundamentally the original programme for raising an army of about a\r\nmillion men to be kept in the United States, as a reserve in case of\r\nemergency. There was no intention of sending to France more troops than\r\nwould be needed to keep filled the ranks of the small expeditionary\r\nforce. But the urgent representations of the Allies and reports from\r\nAmerican officers induced a radical change in policy. The latter\r\nemphasized the unsound military position of our Allies and insisted that\r\nthe deadlock could be broken and the war won only by putting a really\r\neffective American army beside the French and British by the summer of\r\n1918. A programme was drawn up in France and sent to the War Department,\r\naccording to which an army of thirty divisions should be sent abroad\r\nbefore the end of that year. Throughout 1917 this plan remained rather a\r\nhope than a definite programme and it was not until early in 1918 that it\r\nwas officially approved. It was thus of an emergency character and this\r\nfact combined with the indefiniteness prevalent during the autumn of 1917\r\nto produce extreme confusion. In July, 1918, an eighty-division programme\r\nwas adopted and more confusion resulted. Furthermore the entire problem\r\nwas complicated by the question as to whether or not ships could be found\r\nfor transportation. It had been assumed that it would take six months to\r\ntransport five hundred thousand troops. But in May, 1918, and thereafter\r\nnearly three hundred thousand troops a month were carried to France,\r\nlargely through tonnage obtained from the British. Such a development of\r\ntransportation facilities was not and could not be foreseen. It increased\r\nthe confusion. In the face of such difficulties, the problems of\r\nman-power, training, and supplies had to be met and ultimately solved,\r\nlargely through the centralization carried into effect by the General\r\nStaff.\r\n\r\nThe problem of man-power had been carefully considered during the weeks\r\nthat preceded our entrance into the war and the declaration of war found\r\nthe Government prepared with a plan for a selective draft. On the 7th of\r\nApril, the day after the declaration of war, President Wilson insisted\r\nthat \"the safety of the nation depended upon the measure.\"\r\n\r\nCongress, however, was slow to accept the principle of conscription, and\r\nthe President encountered fierce opposition on the part of the advocates\r\nof the volunteer system, who were led by men of such influence as Speaker\r\nChamp Clark, House Leader Claude Kitchin, and the chairman of the House\r\nCommittee on Military Affairs, Stanley H. Dent. The President was\r\ninflexible, declaring that the Administration would not \"yield an inch of\r\nany essential parts of the programme for raising an army by conscription,\"\r\nand exercised his personal influence to its fullest extent in order to\r\nsecure a favorable vote. He was ably seconded by Julius Kahn, the ranking\r\nRepublican member of the House Military Committee, who was himself born in\r\nGermany. The failure of House and Senate to agree on the matter of age\r\nliability delayed action for some weeks. Finally, on May 18, 1917, what\r\nis popularly known as the Selective Service Act became law.\r\n\r\nThis Act gave to the President power to raise the regular army by\r\nenlistment to 287,000 men, to take into the Federal service all members\r\nof the national guard, and to raise by selective draft, in two\r\ninstallments, a force of a million troops. All men between the ages of\r\ntwenty-one and thirty, both inclusive, were registered on the 5th of\r\nJune; this with the subsequent registration of men coming of age later,\r\nproduced an available body of more than ten millions. And when in the\r\nfollowing year, the draft age was extended to include all men between the\r\nages of eighteen and forty-five, both inclusive, thirteen millions more\r\nwere added. From this body the names of those who were to serve were\r\ndrawn by lot. All men registered were carefully classified, in order that\r\nthe first chosen might be those not merely best fitted for fighting, but\r\nthose whose absence on the firing line would least disturb the essential\r\neconomic life of the nation. Liberal exemptions were accorded, including\r\nartisans employed in industries necessary to war production and men upon\r\nwhom others were dependent. On the 20th of July the first drawings were\r\nmade, and by the end of the year about half a million of the drafted men,\r\nnow called the National Army, were mustered in. In the meantime\r\nenlistments in the regular army and the national guard had raised the\r\ntotal number of troops to about a million and a quarter and of officers\r\nto more than one hundred thousand. Less than a year later, when the\r\narmistice was signed, the army included over three and a half millions,\r\nof whom nearly two millions were in France.\r\n\r\nThe real military contribution of the United States to allied victory lay\r\nin man-power. It could not of its own resources transport the troops nor\r\nequip them completely, but the raising of an enormous number of fresh\r\nforces, partially trained, it is true, but of excellent fighting caliber,\r\nmade possible the maneuvers of Foch that brought disaster to German arms.\r\nWhen once these armies arrived in numbers on the battle-line in France,\r\nthe realization of the inexhaustible man-power of America did more than\r\nanything else to revive the spirit of the Allies and discourage the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nInfinitely more difficult than the problem of man-power were those of\r\ntraining and supplies. As we have seen, these problems were complicated\r\nby the decision to send abroad an effective fighting force, a decision\r\nwhich completely changed the entire military situation. The original\r\nplan of maintaining an army only in the United States, as a reserve,\r\npermitted the questions of camps, supplies, equipment, munitions, and\r\ntraining to be undertaken at comparative leisure. But if a large army was\r\nto be placed in France by 1918, these problems must be solved immediately\r\nand upon an emergency basis. Hence resulted the confusion and expense\r\nwhich nearly led to the breakdown of the whole programme in the winter of\r\n1917-18. The War Department faced a dilemma. If it waited until supplies\r\nwere ready, the period of training would be too short. On the other hand,\r\nif it threw the new draft armies immediately into the camps, assuming\r\nthat the camps could be prepared, the troops would lack the wool uniforms\r\nand blankets necessary for protection, as well as the equipment with\r\nwhich to drill. The second alternative appeared the less dangerous, and\r\nin September the first draft calls were made and by December the camps\r\nwere filled.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The size of the army raised in 1917 demanded the building of\r\nenormous cantonments. Within three months of the first drawings sixteen\r\ncomplete cities of barracks had sprung up, each to accommodate 40,000\r\ninhabitants. They had their officers' quarters, hospitals, sewage\r\nsystems, filter plants, and garbage incinerators, electric lighting\r\nplants, libraries, theaters. By the 4th of September the National Army\r\ncantonments were ready for 430,000 men, two-thirds of the first draft. A\r\nsingle camp involved the expenditure of approximately $11,000,000. Camp\r\nGrant, at Rockford, Illinois, included 1600 buildings with space for\r\n45,000 men and 12,000 horses. The water, which before use was tested and\r\nfiltered, was supplied from six huge wells drilled 175 feet deep, carried\r\nthrough 38 miles of water main, and stored in reservoir tanks holding\r\n550,000 gallons. For lighting purposes there were 1450 miles of electric\r\nwire, 1200 poles, 35,000 incandescent lamps. During the period of\r\nconstruction, 50 carloads of building material were daily unloaded, and\r\nfor several weeks an average of 500,000 board feet of lumber set up\r\ndaily. The entire construction of the camp demanded 50,000,000 feet of\r\nlumber, 700 tons of nails, 4,000,000 feet of roofing, and 3,000,000\r\nsquare feet of wall board.]\r\n\r\nMany apprehensions were fulfilled in fact, when the terrible winter\r\nweather came, the worst in years. The northern camps faced it with\r\ninsufficient clothing. Pneumonia made its invasion. Artillerymen were\r\ntrained with wooden guns; infantrymen with wooden rifles or antiquated\r\nKrags. But all the time the essential training proceeded and the calls\r\nfor replacements sent by General Pershing in France were met.\r\n\r\nThe first and vital need was for officers to train the willing but\r\ninexperienced recruits. To meet this need a series of officers' training\r\ncamps had been established in the spring of 1917 and continued for a year.\r\nEach camp lasted for three months, where during twelve hours a day the\r\ncandidates for commissions, chiefly college graduates and young business\r\nmen, were put through the most intensive drill and withering study. All\r\ntold, more than eighty thousand commissions were granted through the\r\ncamps, and the story of the battlefields proved at once the caliber of\r\nthese amateur officers and the effectiveness of their training. Special\r\ncamps, such as the school of fire at Fort Sill, carried the officers a\r\nstep further, and when they went overseas they received in schools in\r\nFrance instruction in the latest experience of the Allied armies. The\r\ncolleges of the country were also formed into training schools and\r\nultimately about 170,000 young men, under military age, in five hundred\r\ninstitutions of learning, joined the Students' Army Training Corps.\r\n\r\nIn all the army schools French and British officers coöperated as\r\ninstructors and gave the value of their three years' experience on the\r\nfighting front. But the traditions of the American regular army,\r\nformulated in the Indian and frontier fights, rather than the siege\r\nmethods of the trenches, formed the basic principles of the instruction;\r\nGeneral Pershing was insistent that an offensive spirit must be instilled\r\ninto the new troops, a policy which received the enthusiastic endorsement\r\nof the President. The development of \"a self-reliant infantry by thorough\r\ndrill in the use of a rifle and in the tactics of open warfare\" was always\r\nuppermost in the mind of the commander of the expeditionary force, who\r\nfrom first to last refused to approve the extreme specialization in trench\r\nwarfare that was advised by the British and the French.\r\n\r\nThe emergency nature of the military programme, resulting from the sudden\r\ndecision to send a large army to France, the decentralization of army\r\naffairs, and the failure to prepare adequately in the years preceding\r\nentrance into the war--all these factors made a shortage of supplies in\r\nthe training camps inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe first appropriation bill which was to provide the funds to purchase\r\nclothing, blankets, and other necessities was not passed until the 15th of\r\nJune, leaving a pitifully brief space of time for the placing of contracts\r\nand the manufacture and transport of supplies. Many factories had to be\r\nbuilt, and many delays resulted from the expansion of the Quartermaster\r\nDepartment, which had not been manned or equipped for such an emergency.\r\nThe shortage of clothing was felt the more because of the extreme severity\r\nof the winter. After the initial difficulties had been passed supplies of\r\nthis kind were furnished in profusion; but lack of preparation on the\r\npart of the War Department and the slowness of Congress to appropriate\r\npromptly produced a temporary situation of extreme discomfort and worse.\r\nThe provision of food supplies was arranged more successfully. Soldiers\r\nwould not be soldiers if they did not complain of their \"chow.\" But the\r\nquality and variety of the food given to the new troops reached a higher\r\ndegree than was reasonably to have been expected. The average soldier\r\ngained from ten to twelve pounds after entering the service. Provision was\r\nalso made for his entertainment. Vaudeville, concerts, moving pictures\r\nformed an element of camp life, much to the surprise of the visiting\r\nFrench officers and Civil War veterans.\r\n\r\nAmericans naturally look back with pride to the making of their new army.\r\nThe draft was accomplished smoothly and rapidly. Demonstrations against\r\nconscription, which in view of the Civil War draft riots had caused some\r\napprehension, were almost unheard of and never serious. Of the three\r\nmillion called for service on the first draft, all but 150,000 were\r\naccounted for, and of those missing most were aliens who had left to\r\nenlist in their own armies. The problem of the slacker and of the\r\nconscientious objector, although vexatious, was never serious. The\r\neducative effect of the training upon the country was very considerable.\r\nAll ranks and classes were gathered in, representing at least fifty-six\r\ndifferent nationalities; artisans, millionaires, and hoboes bunked side by\r\nside; the youthful plutocrat saw life from a new angle, the wild\r\nmountaineer learned to read, the alien immigrant to speak English. Finally\r\nthe purpose of the training was achieved, for America sent over a force\r\nthat could fight successfully at the moment of crisis.\r\n\r\nAmateur critics had assumed that the problem of raising an effective\r\nnumber of troops would prove far more difficult than that of producing\r\nthe necessary equipment and munitions. It was generally believed that the\r\nindustrial genius of America was such that American factories could\r\nprovide all the artillery, small-arms, and aircraft that the armies could\r\nuse. The most fantastic prophecies were indulged in. Experience showed,\r\nhowever, that it is easier to raise, train, and organize troops of\r\nsuperior sort in a brief period than it is to arm them. It stands as a\r\nmatter of record that foreign artillery and machine guns alone made\r\npossible the attack on the St. Mihiel salient and the advance in the\r\nArgonne. As for military airplanes, had the Government relied upon those\r\nof American manufacture there would have been no American squadrons\r\nflying over the German lines previous to August, 1918, and not many\r\nbetween then and the signing of the armistice.\r\n\r\nSuch a statement should not imply blanket criticism of the Ordnance\r\nDepartment. The Government was perhaps slow, even after the United States\r\nentered the war, to realize the serious character of the military\r\nsituation abroad and to appreciate the extent to which American aid would\r\nbe necessary to allied victory. Hence the changes in the military\r\nprogramme which inevitably created confusion. But the decision to ensure\r\nagainst unforeseen disaster by preparing heavily for 1919 and 1920 and\r\npartially disregarding 1918 was based upon sound strategical reasoning.\r\nThe war was brought to a close sooner than had been expected; hence the\r\nperiod of actual hostilities was devoted to laying down the foundations\r\nof a munitions industry, and the munitions actually produced, in the\r\nwords of Assistant Secretary Crowell, \"might almost be termed casual to\r\nthe main enterprise, pilots of the quantities to come.\" Such a policy was\r\npossible because of the surplus production of the Allies. The latter\r\nstated that their production of artillery was such that they could equip\r\nall American divisions as they arrived in France during the year\r\n1918.[5] This gave time \"to build manufacturing capacity on a grand scale\r\nwithout the necessity of immediate production, time to secure the best in\r\ndesign, time to attain quality in the enormous outputs to come later as\r\nopposed to early quantities of indifferent class.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: As a result of the agreement thus made the United States\r\nshipped overseas between the time of the declaration of war and the\r\nsigning of the armistice only 815 complete pieces of mobile artillery,\r\nincluding all produced for France and Great Britain as well as for\r\nAmerican troops. Of the 75's only 181 complete units were shipped abroad,\r\nthe American Expeditionary Force securing 1828 from the French. Of the\r\n155 millimeter howitzers none of American manufacture reached the front.\r\nFrench deliveries amounted to 747.--_America's Munitions_, 1917-1918\r\n(Report of Benedict Crowell, Assistant Secretary of War), p. 90.]\r\n\r\nThe lack of preparation in the matter of machine guns has received wide\r\npublicity. In this, as in artillery, the deficiency was made good by the\r\nAllies up to the final weeks of the war. In April, 1917, the army\r\npossessed only a small number of machine guns entirely inadequate even\r\nfor the training of the new troops and half of which would not take\r\nAmerican service cartridges. Less than seven hundred machine rifles were\r\non hand. Manufacturing facilities for machine guns were limited; there\r\nwere only two factories in the United States actually producing in\r\nquantity. Orders for four thousand Vickers had been placed the preceding\r\nDecember, but deliveries had not been made by the beginning of April.\r\nEither because of jealousy in the department, or because of justifiable\r\ntechnical reasons, various experts demanded a better machine gun than any\r\nused by the Allies, and Secretary Baker took the responsibility of\r\ndelaying matters so as to hold the competition recommended by a board of\r\ninvestigation. This competition was planned for May 1, 1917, with the\r\nresult that we entered the war without having decided upon any type of\r\nmachine gun, and it was not until some weeks later that the Browning was\r\napproved.\r\n\r\nFirst deliveries of this gun could not be made until April, 1918, a year\r\nafter the declaration of war. In the meantime, the War Department\r\nutilized existing facilities to the limit, and placed large orders for\r\nColt, Lewis, and Vickers machine guns. But the heavy machine guns and\r\nautomatic rifles used by our troops in the field were furnished by the\r\nFrench and the British until May, 1918. During that month and June the\r\neleven American divisions that sailed were provided with American-made\r\nVickers, although they still used the French-made Chauchat automatic\r\nrifles. After June, all American troops to sail received a full equipment\r\nof Brownings, both heavy machine guns and automatic rifles. Altogether\r\n27,000 heavy Brownings and 29,000 light Brownings were shipped to the\r\nAmerican Expeditionary Force, sufficient by the time of the armistice to\r\nequip completely all the American troops in France. They were not used in\r\ncombat until the Meuse-Argonne battle, where they amply justified the\r\nfaith of General Pershing.\r\n\r\nThe policy of delaying production in order to obtain the best quality was\r\nnot followed in the case of the rifle, and the results unquestionably\r\njustified the plan, ultimately adopted, of accepting a slightly inferior\r\ntype which could be produced at once in quantity. The American army\r\nrifle, the Springfield, was generally regarded as the most accurate the\r\nworld had seen. Unfortunately there was little hope of expanding the\r\nproduction of Springfields sufficiently to meet the necessities of the\r\nnew National Army. For several years previous to 1917 the Government,\r\nwith myopic vision, had cut down expenditures for the manufacture of\r\nsmall-arms and ammunition, with the result that artisans skilled in\r\nmaking Springfields had been scattered. Even if the two factories that\r\nhad been turning out Springfields could be restaffed, their combined\r\nproduction would be insufficient. Private plants could not be utilized\r\nfor early quantity production, because of the time that would be taken in\r\nbuilding up an adequate manufacturing equipment and training the\r\nartisans. Fortune intervened. It happened that three large American firms\r\nwere about to complete important contracts for supplying Enfield rifles\r\nto the British Government. Their plants and skilled labor might be turned\r\nto account, but the Enfield was not regarded as satisfactory, principally\r\nbecause its ammunition was inferior to that taken by the Springfield. The\r\nWar Department decided to attempt a change in the bore of the Enfield so\r\nthat it would use Springfield cartridges, and to make other minor\r\nsimplifications and improvements. The experiment proved successful to the\r\nhighest degree. The modified Enfields were reported to be only slightly\r\ninferior to the Springfields and by the end of December, 1917, five\r\nthousand a day were being turned out. Altogether American manufactories\r\nproduced during the war about two and a half million rifles, of which all\r\nbut three hundred thousand were modified Enfields.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of airplane production the record is far less satisfactory.\r\nIt is, perhaps, too early to distribute with justice the blame for the\r\ndelays in production, and full cognizance should be taken of the\r\ndifficulties which had to be overcome. But whatever explanations are to be\r\nfound, it is an undeniable fact that not until August, 1918, three months\r\nbefore the armistice, was an American squadron equipped with American\r\nplanes. The Allies had looked to America for the production of combat\r\nplanes in quantity and Congress, responding to popular enthusiasm, had in\r\nthe first days of the war appropriated more than half a billion dollars\r\nfor their manufacture. An Aircraft Production Board was organized, with\r\nHoward E. Coffin as chairman, although the actual manufacture of the\r\nmachines was under the supervision of the Signal Corps. Promises were made\r\nthat by the spring of 1918 the Germans would be completely at the mercy of\r\nAmerican airmen.\r\n\r\nBut difficulties developed. A new type of motor had to be produced,\r\ncapable of serving in any kind of airplane; this was rapidly and\r\nsuccessfully accomplished, and in July, 1917, the Liberty Motor was\r\napproved. But just as manufacturing was about to begin changes in the\r\ndesign were demanded, with ensuing delays. There was confusion between\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Aircraft Board and that of the Signal Corps. The\r\norganization of the latter was less efficient than had been expected,\r\nand men who knew little or nothing of the technique of aircraft were\r\nplaced in charge of production. When orders were given for planes to be\r\nconstructed in France, seven thousand American machinists had to be sent\r\nover to release the French machinists who were to work on these\r\ncontracts, with consequent delays to American production. Repeated\r\nalterations in the designs of airplanes must be made to meet changing\r\nrequirements sent from the front, and large numbers of planes almost\r\nready for delivery had to be scrapped. Two of the types manufactured\r\nproved to be unsatisfactory and were condemned, with an estimated loss of\r\ntwenty-six million dollars. Finally the bitter cold of the winter made it\r\ndifficult to secure the indispensable spruce from the northwestern\r\nforests, and lumbering operations were hampered by extensive strikes,\r\nwhich were said to have resulted from German intrigues.\r\n\r\nGeneral disappointment at the failure to produce airplanes in quantity by\r\nthe spring of 1918 was the more bitter because of the high hopes that had\r\nbeen aroused by those in authority. Instead of confessing the serious\r\nnature of the delays, the War Department attempted to conceal not merely\r\nthe mistakes made but the fact that airplanes could not possibly reach\r\nFrance in any numbers before the autumn of 1918. Thus when at last, in\r\nFebruary, a single combat plane was completed and shipped, the War\r\nDepartment issued the statement: \"The first American-built battle planes\r\nare to-day _en route_ to France. This first shipment, although not in\r\nitself large, marks the final overcoming of many difficulties met in\r\nbuilding up a new and intricate industry.\" When General Wood returned\r\nfrom France in March and reported that not one American-built plane was\r\nin action there, and when the Senate investigation committee unearthed\r\nthe existence of all the delays, the disillusioned public gave vent to\r\nfierce criticism. It was to some extent calmed by the appointment, in\r\nApril, of John D. Ryan, of the Anaconda Copper Company, as director of\r\naircraft production for the army. By this time many of the most serious\r\ndifficulties had been passed. When the armistice was signed about twelve\r\nthousand airplanes had been produced by American plants, of which a third\r\nwere service-planes.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Ayres. _The War with Germany_, 87-90.]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible here to trace the activities of the various departments\r\nin the herculean task of arming the nation. But one should not forget\r\nthat there was much which never received wide publicity. The development\r\nof ordnance carried with it the manufacture of quantities of ammunition\r\nhitherto undreamt of, the building of railway and motorized artillery,\r\nthe improvement of sight and fire-control apparatus, the making of all\r\nsorts of trench-warfare _matériel_. The Air Service had to concern itself\r\nwith the manufacture of radio telephones, armament for airplanes, the\r\nsynchronizing of machine guns to fire through propeller blades, airplane\r\nbombs, air photography, and pyrotechnics. The Chemical Warfare Service\r\nwas busy with the making of toxic gases and gas defense equipment, using\r\nthe peach stones and cocoanut shells which every one was asked to save.\r\nThe enormous quantities of medical and dental supplies must be gathered\r\nby the Quartermaster Department, which also had charge of the salvage\r\nservice and the thousand gargantuan household occupations, such as\r\nlaundering and incineration of garbage, that went with the maintenance of\r\nthe army in camp. The Signal Corps must produce wire, telegraphs,\r\ntelephones, switchboards, radio equipment, batteries, field glasses,\r\nphotographic outfits, and carrier pigeons.\r\n\r\nUpon its navy the United States has always relied chiefly for defense and\r\nin this branch of the service the country was better prepared for war in\r\n1917 than in the army. Indeed when the nation entered the struggle many\r\npersons believed that the sole practical fighting assistance the United\r\nStates should give the Allies would be upon the sea. Josephus Daniels,\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy, was a Southern politician, of limited\r\nadministrative experience and capacity. During the first years of his\r\nappointment he had alienated navy officers through the introduction of\r\npet reforms and his frank advocacy of a little navy. Resiliency, however,\r\nwas one of his characteristics and he followed President Wilson in 1916,\r\nwhen the latter demanded from Congress authority for an expansion in the\r\nnavy which seemed only prudent in view of international conditions.\r\nLargely owing to the efforts of the Assistant Secretary, Franklin D.\r\nRoosevelt, the months immediately preceding the declaration of war\r\nwitnessed strenuous preparations to render aid to the Allies in case the\r\nUnited States should participate. Thereafter Secretary Daniels tended to\r\nsink his personality and judgment in the conduct of the naval war and to\r\ndefer to the opinion of various officers, of whom Admiral William S.\r\nBenson, Chief of Naval Operations was the most influential. When war was\r\ndeclared two flotillas of destroyers were at once sent to Queenstown to\r\nassist in chasing and sinking submarines, and were placed under the\r\ncommand of Admiral William S. Sims. Battleships and cruisers followed,\r\nthough by no means with the expedition nor in the numbers desired by\r\nSims, who believed that by using practically the entire naval force at\r\nonce the submarine could be exterminated and the war ended.\r\n\r\nAt home, the Navy Department entered upon a process of expansion which\r\nincreased its personnel from 65,000 to 497,000 when the armistice was\r\nsigned. A rapid development in naval construction was planned, with\r\nemphasis upon destroyers. The effects of this programme became visible\r\nwithin a year; during the first nine months of 1918 no less than\r\neighty-three destroyers were launched, as against sixty-two for the\r\npreceding nine years. Submarine chasers of a special design were built\r\nand many private yachts taken over and adapted to the war against the\r\nsubmarine. During the course of the war two battleships and twenty-eight\r\nsubmarines were completed. Expansion in naval shipbuilding plans was\r\nparalleled by the construction of giant docks; by camps sufficient for\r\nthe training of two hundred thousand men; and by a naval aircraft\r\nfactory from which a seaplane was turned out seven months after work on\r\nthe factory was begun. Naval aviators returning from the Channel coasts\r\nsuperintended flying schools and undertook the patrol of our Atlantic\r\nseaboard.\r\n\r\nIf much of these military preparations was not translated into\r\naccomplishment before the war ended, it was because the United States was\r\npreparing wisely for a long struggle and it seemed necessary that the\r\nfoundations should be broad and deep. \"America was straining her energies\r\ntowards a goal,\" said the Director of Munitions, \"toward the realization\r\nof an ambition which, in the production of munitions, dropped the year\r\n1918 almost out of consideration altogether, which indeed did not bring\r\nthe full weight of American men and _matériel_ into the struggle even in\r\n1919, but which left it for 1920, if the enemy had not yet succumbed to\r\nthe growing American power, to witness the maximum strength of the United\r\nStates in the field.\" It was the knowledge of this preparation which, to\r\nsome extent, helped to convince the German General Staff of the futility\r\nof further resistance and thus to bring the war to an early end.\r\n\r\nThe dependence of the United States upon the Allies for equipment and\r\nmunitions does not deserve the vitriolic anathemas of certain critics.\r\nThe country did not enter the struggle as if it expected to fight the war\r\nsingle-handed. Distribution of labor and supplies between the United\r\nStates and the Allies was merely a wise and economic measure. At their\r\nown request, the Allies were furnished with that which they most\r\nneeded--money, food, and man-power. In return they provided the United\r\nStates with the artillery and machine guns which they could spare and\r\nwhich they could manufacture more cheaply and rapidly. Finally there is\r\nthe outstanding fact, of which America may always be proud, that this\r\nheterogeneous democracy, organized, so far as organization existed, for\r\nthe pursuits of peace, was able in the space of sixteen months, to\r\nprovide an army capable of fighting successfully one of the most\r\ndifficult campaigns of the war, and that which led directly to the\r\nmilitary defeat of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate success of President Wilson's war policies could hardly have\r\nbeen achieved except by the process of centralization which he never lost\r\nfrom view. His insistence upon centralized responsibility and control in\r\npolitical matters was paralleled in the military field. Nothing\r\nillustrates this principle better than the centralization of the American\r\nExpeditionary Force under the absolute and unquestioned command of General\r\nPershing. The latter was given free rein. The jealousies which so weakened\r\nthe Union armies during the first years of the Civil War were ruthlessly\r\nrepressed. No generals were sent to France of whom he did not approve.\r\nWhen the Allies threatened to appeal to Washington over Pershing's head,\r\nPresident Wilson turned a deaf ear.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the President sought similar centralization through\r\nthe General Staff. It was this body which prepared the different plans for\r\nthe Draft Act, the Pershing expedition, and finally for the gigantic task\r\nof putting a million men in France by the summer of 1918. To the staff was\r\ngiven the formulation of the training programme along the lines\r\nrecommended by Pershing. Always, however, it was hampered by the multiple\r\nresponsibility that characterized the old-style army machine with its\r\nbureau chiefs competing with each other, with the navy, and with the\r\nAllies. Quartermaster Department, Ordnance Department, Signal Corps, and\r\nthe other bureaus were uncoördinated, and inevitable waste and\r\ninefficiency followed all their operations. It was the crisis that arose\r\nfrom the problem of supplies, in the winter of 1917, that furnished the\r\nPresident with the opportunity to cut red-tape and secure the\r\ncentralization he desired. That opportunity came with the blanket powers\r\nbestowed upon him by the Overman Act, the full significance of which can\r\nonly be appreciated after a consideration of the measures taken to\r\ncentralize the industrial resources of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE HOME FRONT\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 18, 1917, President Wilson issued a proclamation in which are to\r\nbe found the following significant sentences:\r\n\r\n    In the sense in which we have been wont to think of armies there are\r\n    no armies in this struggle, there are entire nations armed. Thus,\r\n    the men who remain to till the soil and man the factories are no\r\n    less a part of the army that is in France than the men beneath the\r\n    battle flags. It must be so with us. It is not an army that we must\r\n    shape and train for war--it is a Nation. To this end our people must\r\n    draw close in one compact front against a common foe. But this\r\n    cannot be if each man pursues a private purpose. All must pursue one\r\n    purpose. The Nation needs all men, but it needs each man, not in the\r\n    field that will most pleasure him, but in the endeavor that will\r\n    best serve the common good. Thus, though a sharpshooter pleases to\r\n    operate a trip-hammer for the forging of great guns, and an expert\r\n    machinist desires to march with the flag, the Nation is being served\r\n    only when the sharpshooter marches and the machinist remains at his\r\n    levers. The whole Nation must be a team, in which each man shall\r\n    play the part for which he is best fitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf President Wilson deserves severe criticism for his failure to endorse\r\nadequate plans of preparation for war while his country was at peace, he\r\nshould be given due credit for his appreciation that the home front must\r\nbe organized if the fighting front was to be victorious. He perceived\r\nclearly that it was necessary to carry into the industrial life of the\r\nnation that centralizing process which characterized his military policy.\r\nThat the nation at home was made to feel itself part of the fighting\r\nforces and coöperated enthusiastically and effectively in the organization\r\nof the national resources was not the least of the triumphs of the United\r\nStates. Such organization demanded great sacrifice, not merely of luxuries\r\nor comforts, but of settled habits, which are difficult to break. It must\r\nnecessarily be of an emergency character, for the United States possessed\r\nno bureaucratic system like that which obtains on the continent of Europe\r\nfor the centralization of trade, manufactures, food production, and the\r\nthousand activities that form part of economic life. But the event proved\r\nthat both the spirit and the brains of the American people were equal to\r\nthe crisis.\r\n\r\nThe problem of coördinating the national industries for the supply of the\r\narmy was complicated by the military decentralization described in the\r\npreceding chapter, which President Wilson was not able to remedy before\r\nthe final months of the war. The army did not form or state its\r\nrequirements as one body but through five supply bureaus, which acted\r\nindependently and in competition with each other. Bids for materials from\r\nthe different bureaus conflicted with each other, with those of the navy,\r\nand of the Allies. Not merely was it essential that such demands should\r\nbe coördinated, but that some central committee should be able to say how\r\nlarge was the total supply of any sort of materials, how soon they could\r\nbe produced, and to prevent the waste of such materials in unessential\r\nproduction. If the army was decentralized, American industry as a whole\r\nwas in a state of complete chaos, so far as any central organization was\r\nconcerned. On the side of business every firm in every line of production\r\nwas competing in the manufacture of essential and unessential articles,\r\nin transportation, and in bidding for and holding the necessary labor.\r\nMr. Wilson set himself the task of evolving order out of this chaos.\r\n\r\nThe President, as in the purely military problem where he utilized the\r\nGeneral Staff as his instrument, prepared to adapt existing machinery,\r\nrather than to create a completely new organization. For a time he seems\r\nto have believed that his Cabinet might serve the function. But it was\r\nill-adapted to handle the sort of problems that must be solved. It was\r\ncomposed of men chosen largely for political reasons, and despite much\r\npublic complaint it had not been strengthened after Wilson's reëlection.\r\nFranklin K. Lane, the Secretary of the Interior, was generally recognized\r\nas a man of excellent business judgment, willing to listen to experts, and\r\ncapable of coöperating effectively with the economic leaders of the\r\ncountry. His influence with the President, however, seemed to be\r\novershadowed by that of Newton D. Baker and William G. McAdoo, Secretaries\r\nof War and of the Treasury, who had inspired the distrust of most business\r\nmen. McAdoo in particular alienated financial circles because of his\r\napparent suspicion of banking interest, and both, by their appeals to\r\nlaboring men, laid themselves open to the charge of demagogic tactics.\r\nRobert Lansing, the Secretary of State, had won recognition as an expert\r\ninternational lawyer of long experience, but he could not be expected to\r\nexercise great influence, inasmuch as the President obviously intended to\r\nremain his own foreign secretary. Albert S. Burleson, Postmaster-General,\r\nwas a politician, expert in the minor tactics of party, whose conduct of\r\nthe postal and telegraphic systems was destined to bring a storm of\r\nprotest upon the entire Administration. Thomas W. Gregory, the\r\nAttorney-General, had gained entrance into the Cabinet by means of a\r\nrailroad suit which had roused the ire of the transportation interests.\r\nThe other members were, at that time, little known or spoken of. Wilson\r\nspent much time and effort in defending his Cabinet members from attacks,\r\nand yet it was believed that he rarely appealed to them for advice in the\r\nformulation of policies. Thus the Cabinet as a whole lacked the very\r\nqualities essential to a successful organizing committee: ability to\r\nsecure the coöperation and respect of the industrial leaders of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nTitular functions of an organizing character, nevertheless, had been\r\nconferred upon six members of the Cabinet in August, 1916, through the\r\ncreation of a \"Council of National Defense\"; they were charged with the\r\n\"coördination of industries and resources for the national security and\r\nwelfare.\" The actual labor of coördination, however, was to be exercised\r\nby an advisory commission of seven, which included Howard E. Coffin, in\r\ncharge of munitions, Daniel Willard, president of the Baltimore and Ohio\r\nRailroad, in charge of transportation, Julius Rosenwald, president of the\r\nSears-Roebuck Company, in charge of supplies including clothing, Bernard\r\nM. Baruch, a versatile financial trader, in charge of metals, minerals,\r\nand raw materials, Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federation\r\nof Labor, in charge of labor and the welfare of workers, Hollis Godfrey\r\nin charge of engineering and education, and Franklin H. Martin in charge\r\nof medicine. The commission at once prepared to lay down its programme,\r\nto create sub-committees and technical boards, and to secure the\r\nassistance of business leaders, without whose coöperation their task\r\ncould not be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nFollowing plans developed by the Council of National Defense, experts in\r\nevery business likely to prove of importance were called upon to\r\ncoördinate and stimulate war necessities, to control their distribution,\r\nto provide for the settlement of disputes between employers and\r\nwage-earners, to fix prices, to conserve resources. Scientific and\r\ntechnical experts were directed in their researches. The General Medical\r\nBoard and the Committee on Engineering and Education were supervised in\r\ntheir mobilization of doctors and surgeons, engineers, physicists and\r\nchemists, professors and graduate students in the university laboratories.\r\nEverywhere and in all lines experience and brains were sought and\r\nutilized. State Councils of Defense were created to oversee the work of\r\nsmaller units and to establish an effective means of communication between\r\nthe individual and the national Government. Naturally much\r\nover-organization resulted and some waste of time and energy; but the\r\nuniversal spirit of voluntary coöperation evoked by the Councils\r\noverbalanced this loss and aided greatly in putting the country on an\r\neffective war basis. As Wilson said, \"beyond all question the highest and\r\nbest form of efficiency is the spontaneous coöperation of a free people.\"\r\nIn return for their efforts the people received an education in public\r\nspirit and civic consciousness such as could have come in no other way.\r\n\r\nOf the committees of the Council, that on munitions developed along the\r\nmost elaborate lines, becoming of such importance that on July 28, 1917,\r\nit was reorganized as the War Industries Board. As such it gradually\r\nabsorbed most of the functions of the Council which were not transferred\r\nto other agencies of the Government. During the autumn of 1917 the\r\nactivities of the Board underwent rapid extension, but it lacked the\r\npower to enforce its decisions. As in the case of the General Staff, it\r\nwas important that it should have authority not merely to plan but also\r\nto supervise and execute. Such a development was foreshadowed in the\r\nreorganization of the Board in March, 1918, under the chairmanship of\r\nBernard M. Baruch, and when the President received the blanket authority\r\nconferred by the Overman Act, he immediately invested the War Industries\r\nBoard with the centralizing power which seemed so necessary. Henceforth\r\nit exercised an increasingly strict control over all the industries of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Board was, generally speaking, to secure for the\r\nGovernment and the Allies the goods essential for making war\r\nsuccessfully, and to protect the civil needs of the country. The supply\r\nof raw materials to the manufacturer as well as the delivery of finished\r\nproducts was closely regulated by a system of priorities. The power of\r\nthe Board in its later development was dictatorial, inasmuch as it might\r\ndiscipline any refractory producer or manufacturer by the withdrawal of\r\nthe assignments he expected. The leaders of each of the more important\r\nindustries were called into council, in order to determine resources and\r\nneeds, and the degree of preference to which each industry was entitled.\r\nSome were especially favored, in order to stimulate production in a line\r\nthat was of particular importance or was failing to meet the exigencies\r\nof the military situation; shipments to others of a less essential\r\ncharacter were deferred. Committees of the Board studied industrial\r\nconditions and recommended the price that should be fixed for various\r\ncommodities; stability was thus artificially secured and profiteering\r\nlessened. The Conservation Division worked out and enforced methods of\r\nstandardizing patterns in order to economize materials and labor. The\r\nSteel Division coöperated with the manufacturers for the speeding-up of\r\nproduction; and the Chemical Division, among other duties, stimulated the\r\nvitally important supply of potash, dyes, and nitrates. Altogether it has\r\nbeen roughly estimated that the industrial capacity of the country was\r\nincreased by twenty per cent through the organizing labors and authority\r\nof the War Industries Board.\r\n\r\nThe success of this Board would have been impossible without the building\r\nup of an extraordinary _esprit de corps_ among the men who were brought\r\nface to face with these difficult problems of industry and commerce.\r\nTheir chairman relied, of course, upon the coöperation of the leaders of\r\n\"big business,\" who now, in the hour of the country's need, sank their\r\nprejudice against governmental interference and gave freely of their\r\nexperience, brains, and administrative power. Men whose incomes were\r\nmeasured in the hundreds of thousands forgot their own business and\r\nworked at Washington on a salary of a dollar a year.\r\n\r\nThe same spirit of coöperation was evoked when it came to the conservation\r\nand the production of food. If steel was to win the war, its burden could\r\nnot be supported without wheat, and for some months in 1917 and 1918\r\nvictory seemed to depend largely upon whether the Allies could find enough\r\nto eat. Even in normal times Great Britain and France import large\r\nquantities of foodstuffs; under war conditions they were necessarily\r\ndependent upon foreign grain-producing countries. The surplus grain of the\r\nArgentine and Australia was not available because of the length of the\r\nvoyage and the scarcity of shipping; the Russian wheat supply was cut off\r\nby enemy control of the Dardanelles even before it was dissipated by\r\ncorrupt officials or reckless revolutionaries. The Allies, on the verge of\r\nstarvation, therefore looked to North America. Yet the stock of cereals\r\nwhen the United States entered the war was at a lower level than it had\r\nbeen for years and the number of food animals had also been reduced.\r\n\r\nTo meet the crisis President Wilson called upon one of the most\r\ninteresting and commanding personalities of modern times. Herbert Clark\r\nHoover was a Californian mining engineer, of broad experience in\r\nAustralia, China, and England, who in 1914 had been given control of\r\nAllied Relief abroad. The following year he undertook the difficult and\r\ndelicate task of organizing food relief for Belgium. He was able to\r\narouse the enthusiastic sympathy of Americans, win financial support on a\r\nlarge scale, procure the much-needed food, and provide for its effective\r\ndistribution among the suffering Belgians, in spite of the suspicions of\r\nthe Germans and the hindrances thrown in his path. A master organizer,\r\nwith keen flair for efficient subordinates, of broad vision never muddied\r\nby details, with sound knowledge of business economics, and a gift for\r\ndramatic appeal, Hoover was ideally fitted to conduct the greatest\r\nexperiment in economic organization the world had seen. Unsentimental\r\nhimself, he knew how to arouse emotion--a necessary quality, since the\r\nfood problem demanded heavy personal sacrifices which would touch every\r\nindividual; brusque in manner, he avoided giving the offense which\r\nnaturally follows any interference with the people's dinner and which\r\nwould destroy the essential spirit of voluntary coöperation.\r\n\r\nFive days after the declaration of war, President Wilson, through the\r\nCouncil of National Defense, named a committee on food supply, with Hoover\r\nat its head, and shortly thereafter named him food commissioner. Hoover\r\nbegan his work of educating the people to realize the necessity of economy\r\nand extra-production; but he lacked the administrative powers which were\r\nessential if his work was to prove effective, and it was not until August\r\nthat Congress passed the Lever Act which provided for strict control of\r\nfood under an administrator. This measure encountered strong opposition in\r\nthe Senate and from the farmers, who feared lest the provisions against\r\nhoarding of food would prevent them from holding their products for high\r\nprices. Wilson exerted his personal influence vigorously for the bill in\r\nthe face of congressional opposition, which demanded that large powers of\r\ncontrol should be given to a Senate committee of ten, and he was finally\r\nsuccessful in his appeal. He thereupon appointed Hoover Food Administrator\r\nwith practically unlimited powers, legalizing the work already begun on\r\nhis own initiative.\r\n\r\nHoover at once made arrangements to prevent the storage of wheat in large\r\nquantities and to eliminate speculative dealings in wheat on the grain\r\nexchanges. He then offered to buy the entire wheat crop at a fair price\r\nand agreed with the millers to take flour at a fair advance on the price\r\nof wheat. Fearful lest the farmers should be discouraged from planting the\r\nfollowing year, 1918, he offered to buy all the wheat that could be raised\r\nat two dollars a bushel. If peace came before the crop was disposed of,\r\nthe Government might be compelled to take over the wheat at a higher price\r\nthan the market, but the offer was a necessary inducement to extensive\r\nplanting. In the meantime Hoover appealed to the country to utilize every\r\nscrap of ground for the growing of food products. Every one of whatever\r\nage and class turned gardener. The spacious and perfectly trimmed lawns of\r\nthe wealthy, as well as the weed-infested back yards of the poor, were dug\r\nup and planted with potatoes or corn. Community gardens flourished in the\r\nvillages and outside of the larger towns, where men, women, and children\r\ncame out in the evening, after their regular work, to labor with rake and\r\nhoe. There were perhaps two million \"war gardens\" over and beyond the\r\nalready established gardens, which unquestionably enabled many a citizen\r\nto reduce his daily demands on the grocer, and stimulated his interest in\r\nthe problem of food conservation. As a result of Hoover's dealing with the\r\nfarmers, during the year 1917 the planted wheat acreage exceeded the\r\naverage of the preceding five years by thirty-five million acres, or by\r\nabout twelve per cent, and another additional five million acres were\r\nplanted in 1918. The result was the largest wheat crop in American history\r\nexcept that of 1915, despite the killing cold of the winter of 1917 and\r\nthe withering drought of the summer of 1918. An increase in the number of\r\nlive stock was also secured and the production of milk, meat, and wool\r\nshowed a notable development.\r\n\r\nHoover achieved equal success in the problem of conserving food. He\r\nrealized that he must bring home to the individual housewife the need of\r\nthe closest economy, and he organized a nation-wide movement to secure\r\nvoluntary pledges that the rules and requests of the Food Administration\r\nwould be observed. People were asked to use other flours than wheat\r\nwhenever possible, to be sparing of sugar and meat, to utilize\r\nsubstitutes, and rigidly to avoid waste. On every billboard and in all\r\nthe newspapers were to be seen appeals to save food. Housewives were\r\nenrolled as \"members of the Food Administration\" and were given placards\r\nto post in their windows announcing their membership and the willingness\r\nof the family to abide by its requests. Certain days of the week were\r\ndesignated as \"wheatless\" or \"meatless\" when voluntary demi-fasts were to\r\nbe observed, the nonobservance of which spelled social ostracism. To\r\n\"Hooverize\" became a national habit, and children were denied a spoonful\r\nof sugar on their cereal, \"because Mr. Hoover would not like it.\" Hoover,\r\nwith his broad forehead, round face, compelling eyes, and underhung jaw,\r\nbecame the benevolent bogey of the nation. It was a movement of general\r\nrenunciation such as no country had undergone except at the pinch of\r\nbiting necessity.[7] In the meantime prices were prevented from rapid\r\nincrease by a system of licenses, which tended to prevent hoarding or\r\nspeculation. Attempts to capitalize the need of the world for private\r\ngain, or in common parlance, to \"profiteer,\" were comparatively rare and\r\nwere adequately punished by revocation of license or by forced sale of\r\nhoardings.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Restaurants and hotels coöperated; during a period of only\r\ntwo months they were reported as having saved nine thousand tons of meat,\r\nfour thousand tons of flour, and a thousand tons of sugar. City garbage\r\nplants announced a decrease in the amount of garbage collected ranging\r\nfrom ten to thirteen per cent.]\r\n\r\nAs a result of the organization of food supply, the stimulation of\r\nproduction, and the prevention of waste, America was able to save the\r\nEntente nations, and, later, much of central and southeastern Europe from\r\nstarvation, without herself enduring anything worse than discomfort. The\r\nGovernment was able at the same time to provide the troops in France with\r\nfood which, to the _poilus_ at least, seemed luxurious. When the United\r\nStates entered the war the country was prepared to export 20,000,000\r\nbushels of wheat; instead it sent over 141,000,000. In four months, in\r\nthe summer of 1918, the American people saved out of their regular\r\nconsumption and sent abroad half a million tons of sugar. The autumn of\r\n1918 saw an increase of nearly a million tons of pork products over what\r\nwas available the previous year. Altogether, during the crop year of\r\n1918, America doubled the average amount of food sent to Europe\r\nimmediately before the war, notwithstanding unfavorable weather\r\nconditions and the congestion of freight that resulted from other war\r\nnecessities. The total contribution in foodstuffs exported to Europe\r\nthat year amounted to a value of about two billion dollars. This was done\r\nwithout food cards and with a minimum of edicts. It was the work of\r\neducation and conscience.\r\n\r\nFuel like food was a war necessity and there was equal need of\r\nstimulating production by assuring a fair profit and of eliminating all\r\npossible waste. Without the steam power provided by coal, raw materials\r\ncould not be transformed into the manufactured articles demanded by\r\nmilitary necessity, nor distributed by the railroads and steamships. Soon\r\nafter the declaration of war, a committee of coal operators, meeting\r\nunder the authorization of the Council of National Defense, drew up a\r\nplan for the stimulation of coal production and its more economical\r\ndistribution. This committee voluntarily set a price for coal lower than\r\nthe current market price, in order to prevent a rise in manufacturing\r\ncosts; it was approved by the Secretary of the Interior, who warmly\r\npraised the spirit of sacrifice displayed by the operators. Unfortunately\r\nthe Secretary of War, as chairman of the Council of National Defense,\r\nrepudiated the arrangement, on the ground that the price agreed upon was\r\ntoo high. The operators were discouraged, because of the difficulty of\r\nstimulating production under the lower price which Secretary Baker\r\ninsisted upon; they were further disappointed at the postponement of\r\nplans for a zone system and an elimination of long cross hauls, designed\r\nto relieve the load that would be thrown upon railroad transportation in\r\nthe coming winter.\r\n\r\nIn August, Wilson was empowered by the Lever Act to appoint a Fuel\r\nAdministrator and chose Harry A. Garfield, President of Williams College.\r\nConditions, however, became more confused. The fuel problem was one of\r\ntransportation quite as much as of production; the railroads were unable\r\nto furnish the needed coal-cars, and because of an expensive and possibly\r\nunfair system of car allotment, coal distribution was hampered. Add to\r\nthis the fact that numerous orders for coal shipments had been deferred\r\nuntil autumn, in the belief that the Administration, which in the person\r\nof Baker was not believed to look on the coal operators with favor, would\r\nenforce low prices. Hence during the last three months of the year an\r\nunprecedented amount of coal had to be shipped, and the congestion on the\r\ncompeting railroads was such that the country faced a real coal famine.\r\nIn December, the Government recognized the obvious fact that the railroad\r\nmust be placed under one management, if the confusion in the whole\r\nindustrial situation were to be eliminated. President Wilson accordingly\r\nannounced that the Federal Government would take over the railroads for\r\nthe period of the war.\r\n\r\nThis measure came too late to save the country from the evil effects of\r\nthe fuel shortage. The penalty for the delays of the preceding summer had\r\nto be paid, and it was the heavier because of the severity of the winter.\r\nOverloaded trains were stalled and harbors froze over, imprisoning the\r\ncoal barges. Thirty-seven ships laden with essential military supplies\r\nwere held up in New York harbor for lack of fuel, and long strings of\r\nempties blocked the sidings, while the shippers all over the country cried\r\nfor cars. To meet the crisis Garfield decreed that all manufacturing\r\nplants east of the Mississippi should be shut down for five days and for a\r\nseries of Mondays, until the 25th of March. The order applied also to\r\nplaces of amusement, private offices, and most stores, which were not\r\nallowed to furnish heat. Munitions plants and essential industries, as\r\nwell as Government offices were naturally excepted. \"Heatless Mondays\"\r\ncaused great inconvenience and bitter criticism, for they came at the\r\nmoment when it was most important that the economic life of the nation\r\nshould be functioning at its greatest efficiency. But the embargo helped\r\nto tide over the crisis. As in the case of food, the public, once it\r\nappreciated the necessity of the situation, accepted it cheerfully.\r\nDomestic economy was also widely preached and applied, to the slogan,\r\n\"Save a shovelful of coal a day.\" The elimination of electric\r\nadvertisements and the diminution of street lighting, served to lessen the\r\nnon-essential demand for coal; and the crisis also forced the introduction\r\nof \"daylight saving,\" the advancement of the clock by an hour, during the\r\nmonths extending from March to October, thus saving artificial light.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Fuel Administration, the operators, and the miners\r\nwere coöperating to increase coal production. The enthusiasm of the mine\r\nworkers was stimulated by making them realize that they were indeed part\r\nof the fighting forces. A competitive spirit was aroused and mining\r\nconditions were bettered to keep them satisfied. Labor responded to the\r\ncall. Holidays were omitted and emulation between different shifts became\r\nkeen.[8] Increased production was paralleled by more efficient\r\ndistribution. A zone system, finally put into operation, eliminated\r\napproximately 160,000,000 car miles. Local fuel administrators kept in\r\nconstant touch with the need of the localities under their jurisdiction,\r\nstudied methods of abolishing unnecessary manufacturing use of coal and\r\nrefused coal to non-essential industries.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: In 1918 the average number of days worked by each miner in\r\nthe bituminous fields was greater by twelve than that of 1917, and by\r\ntwenty-five than that of 1916. During the half-year period from April to\r\nSeptember, 1918, bituminous production was twelve per cent greater than\r\nin the corresponding period of the previous year, which had itself\r\nestablished a record, despite the decrease in the number of mine\r\nworkers.]\r\n\r\nSimilar increase in the production and saving of oil was accomplished.\r\nThe oil-burning vessels of the allied navies and merchant marines, the\r\nmotor transport service of the armies, all made this necessary. In 1918\r\nthe production of oil in the United States was fourteen per cent greater\r\nthan in 1914. In response to an urgent cable from Marshal Foch, which\r\nran: \"If you don't keep up your petrol supply we shall lose the war,\" a\r\nseries of \"gasless Sundays\" was suggested. For nearly two months, merely\r\nat the request of the Fuel Administration and without any compulsion\r\nexcept that arising from public opinion, Sunday motoring was practically\r\nabandoned. That most crowded of motor thoroughfares, the Boston Post\r\nRoad from New York to Stamford, might have served as playground for a\r\nkindergarten. The estimated saving of gasoline amounted to a million\r\nbarrels: about four per cent of the gasoline sent abroad in 1918 was\r\nprovided by the gasless Sundays.\r\n\r\nCredit must be given the Fuel Administration for the large measure of\r\nsuccess which it finally secured. It was slow in its early organization\r\nand at first failed to make full use of the volunteer committees of coal\r\noperators and labor representatives who offered their assistance and\r\nwhose experience qualified them to give invaluable advice. But Garfield\r\nshowed his capacity for learning the basic facts of the situation, and\r\nultimately chose strong advisers. When he entered upon his duties he\r\nfound the crisis so far advanced that it could not be immediately solved.\r\nFurthermore, in a situation which demanded the closest coöperation\r\nbetween the Fuel and the Railroad Administration, he did not always\r\nreceive the assistance from the latter which he had a right to expect.\r\n\r\nAs a war measure, the temporary nationalization of the railroads was\r\nprobably necessary. Whatever the ultimate advantages of private ownership\r\nand the system of competition, during the period of military necessity\r\nperfect coördination was essential. Railroad facilities could not be\r\nimproved because new equipment, so far as it could be manufactured, had\r\nto be sent abroad; the only solution of the problem of congestion seemed\r\nto be an improvement of service. During the first nine months after the\r\ndeclaration of war a notable increase in the amount of freight carried\r\nwas effected; nevertheless, as winter approached, it became obvious that\r\nthe roads were not operating as a unit and could not carry the load\r\ndemanded of them. Hence resulted the appointment of McAdoo in December,\r\n1917, as Director-General, with power to operate all the railroads as a\r\nsingle line.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring of 1918 the Administration gradually overcame the worst\r\nof the transportation problems. To the presidents and management of the\r\nvarious railroads must go the chief share of credit for the successful\r\naccomplishment of this titanic task. Despite their distrust of McAdoo and\r\ntheir objections to his methods, they coöperated loyally with the\r\nRailroad Administration in putting through the necessary measures of\r\ncoördination and in the elimination of the worst features of the former\r\ncompetitive system. They adopted a permit system which prevented the\r\nloading of freight unless it could be unloaded at its destination; they\r\ninsisted upon more rapid unloading of cars; they consolidated terminals\r\nto facilitate the handling of cars; they curtailed circuitous routing of\r\nfreight; they reduced the use of Pullman cars for passenger service. As a\r\nresult, after May, 1918, congestion was diminished and during the summer\r\nwas no longer acute. This was accomplished despite the number of troops\r\nmoved, amounting during the first ten months of 1918 to six and a half\r\nmillions. In addition the railroads carried large quantities of food,\r\nmunitions, building materials for cantonments, and other supplies, most\r\nof which converged upon eastern cities and ports. The increase in the\r\nnumber of grain-carrying cars alone, from July to November, was 135,000\r\nover the same period of the previous year.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the Government's administration of the railroads has a\r\ndarker side. Complaints were frequent that the Railroad Administration\r\nsacrificed other interests for its own advantage. The future of the roads\r\nwas said not to be carefully safeguarded, and equipment and rolling stock\r\nmishandled and allowed to deteriorate. Above all, at the moment when it\r\nwas quite as essential to preserve the morale of labor on the home front\r\nas that of the troops in France, McAdoo made concessions to labor that\r\nwere more apt to destroy discipline and _esprit de corps_ than to\r\nmaintain them. The authority given for the unionization of railroad\r\nemployees, the stopping of piecework, the creation of shop committees,\r\nweakened the control of the foremen and led to a loss of shop efficiency\r\nwhich has been estimated at thirty per cent. Government control was\r\nnecessary, but in the form in which it came it proved costly.\r\n\r\nDuring the months when manufacturing plants were built and their output\r\nspeeded up, when fuel and food were being produced in growing amounts,\r\nwhen the stalled freight trains were being disentangled, there was\r\nunceasing call for ocean-going tonnage. Food and war materials would be\r\nof little use unless the United States had the ships in which to\r\ntransport them across the Atlantic. The Allies sorely needed American\r\nhelp to replace the tonnage sunk by German submarines; during some\r\nmonths, Allied shipping was being destroyed at the rate of six million\r\ntons a year. Furthermore if an effective military force were to be\r\ntransported to France, according to the plans that germinated in the\r\nsummer of 1917, there would be need of every possible cubic inch of\r\ntonnage. The entire military situation hinged upon the shipping problem.\r\nYet when the United States joined in war on Germany there was not a\r\nshipyard in the country which would accept a new order; every inch of\r\navailable space was taken by the navy or private business.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1916, the United States Shipping Board had been organized\r\nto operate the Emergency Fleet Corporation, which had been set up\r\nprimarily to develop trade with South America. This body now prepared a\r\ngigantic programme of shipbuilding, which expanded as the need for\r\ntonnage became more evident. By November 15, 1917, the Board planned for\r\n1200 ships with dead weight tonnage of seven and a half millions. The\r\ndifficulties of building new yards, of collecting trained workmen and\r\ntechnicians were undoubtedly great, but they might have been overcome\r\nmore easily had not unfortunate differences developed between William\r\nDenman, the chairman of the Board, who advocated wooden ships, and\r\nGeneral George W. Goethals, the head of the Emergency Fleet Corporation,\r\nwho depended upon steel construction. The differences led to the\r\nresignation of both and continued disorganization hampered the rapid\r\nfulfillment of the programme Edward N. Hurley became chairman of the\r\nShipping Board, but it was not until the spring of 1918, when Charles M.\r\nSchwab of the Bethlehem Steel Company was put in charge of the Emergency\r\nFleet Corporation as Director General of shipbuilding, that public\r\nconfidence in ultimate success seemed justified.\r\n\r\nMuch of the work accomplished during the latter days of the war was\r\nspectacular. Waste lands along the Delaware overgrown with weeds were\r\ntransformed within a year into a shipyard with twenty-eight ways, a ship\r\nunder construction on each one, with a record of fourteen ships already\r\nlaunched. The spirit of the workmen was voiced by the placard that hung\r\nabove the bulletin board announcing daily progress, which proclaimed,\r\n\"Three ships a week or bust.\" The Hog Island yards near Philadelphia and\r\nthe Fore River yards in Massachusetts became great cities with docks,\r\nsidings, shops, offices, and huge stacks of building materials. Existing\r\nyards, such as those on the Great Lakes, were enlarged so that in\r\nfourteen months they sent to the ocean a fleet of 181 steel vessels. The\r\nnew ships were standardized and built on the \"fabricated\" system, which\r\nprovided for the manufacture of the various parts in different factories\r\nand their assembling at the shipyards. In a single day, July 4, 1918,\r\nthere were launched in American shipyards ninety-five vessels, with a\r\ndead weight tonnage of 474,464. In one of the Great Lakes yards a 5500\r\nton steel freighter was launched seventeen days after the keel was laid,\r\nand seventeen days later was delivered to the Shipping Board, complete\r\nand ready for service.\r\n\r\nThis work was not accomplished without tremendous expenditure and much\r\nwaste. The Shipping Board was careless in its financial management and\r\nunwise in many of its methods. By introducing the cost plus system in the\r\nletting of contracts it fostered extravagance and waste and increased and\r\nintensified the industrial evils that had resulted from its operation in\r\nthe building of army cantonments. The contractors received the cost of\r\nconstruction plus a percentage commission; obviously they had no incentive\r\nto economize; the greater the expense the larger their commission. Hence\r\nthey willingly paid exorbitant prices for materials and agreed to \"fancy\"\r\nwages. Not merely was the expense of securing the necessary tonnage\r\nmultiplied, but the cost of materials and labor in all other industries\r\nwas seriously enhanced. The high wages paid tended to destroy the\r\npatriotic spirit of the shipworkers, who were enticed by greed rather\r\nthan by the glory of service. The effect on drafted soldiers was bound to\r\nbe unfortunate, for they could not but realize the injustice of a system\r\nwhich gave them low pay for risking their lives, while their friends in\r\nthe shipyards received fabulous wages. Such aspects of the early days of\r\nthe Shipping Board were ruthlessly reformed by Schwab when he took\r\ncontrol of the Emergency Fleet Corporation. Appealing to the patriotism of\r\nthe workers he reduced costs and increased efficiency, according to some\r\ncritics, by thirty per cent, according to others, by no less than one\r\nhundred and ten per cent.\r\n\r\nBy September, 1918, the Shipping Board had brought under its jurisdiction\r\n2600 vessels with a total dead weight tonnage of more than ten millions.\r\nOf this fleet, sixteen per cent had been built by the Emergency Fleet\r\nCorporation. The remainder was represented by ships which the Board had\r\nrequisitioned when America entered the war, by the ships of Allied and\r\nneutral countries which had been purchased and chartered, and by interned\r\nenemy ships which had been seized. The last-named were damaged by their\r\ncrews at the time of the declaration of war, but were fitted for service\r\nwith little delay by a new process of electric welding. Such German boats\r\nas the _Vaterland_, rechristened the _Leviathan_, and the _George\r\nWashington_, together with smaller ships, furnished half a million tons\r\nof German cargo-space. The ships which transported American soldiers were\r\nnot chiefly provided by the Shipping Board, more than fifty per cent\r\nbeing represented by boats borrowed from Great Britain.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: In the last six months of the war over 1,500,000 men were\r\ncarried abroad as follows:\r\n          44 per cent in United States ships\r\n          51 per cent in British ships\r\n           3 per cent in Italian ships\r\n           2 per cent in French ships\r\nThe United States transports included 450,000 tons of German origin;\r\n300,000 tons supplied by commandeered Dutch boats; and 718,000 tons\r\nprovided by the Emergency Fleet Corporation.]\r\n\r\nMore effective use of shipping was fostered by the War Trade Board, which\r\nhad been created six months after the declaration of war by the Trading\r\nwith the Enemy Act (October 6, 1917), and which, in conjunction with the\r\nactivities of the Alien Property Custodian, possessed full powers to\r\ncurtail enemy trade. It thereby obtained practical control of the foreign\r\ncommerce of this country, and was able both to conserve essential products\r\nfor American use and to secure and economize tonnage.\r\n\r\nSuch control was assured through a system of licenses for exports and\r\nimports. No goods could be shipped into or out of the country without a\r\nlicense, which was granted by the War Trade Board only after investigation\r\nof the character of the shipment and its destination or source. The\r\nearlier export of goods which had found their way to Germany through\r\nneutral countries was thus curtailed and the blockade on Germany became\r\nstrangling. Products necessary to military effectiveness were secured from\r\nneutral states in return for permission to buy essentials here. Two\r\nmillions of tonnage were obtained from neutral states for the use of the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain. Trade in non-essentials with the Orient\r\nand South America was limited, extra bottoms were thus acquired, and the\r\nproduction of non-essentials at home discouraged. Altogether, the War\r\nTrade Board exercised tremendous powers which, however necessary, might\r\nhave provoked intense resentment in business circles; but these powers\r\nwere enforced with a tact and discretion characteristic of the head of the\r\nBoard, Vance McCormick, who was able successfully to avoid the irritation\r\nthat might have been expected from such governmental interference with\r\nfreedom of commerce.\r\n\r\nThe problem of labor was obviously one that must be faced by each of the\r\nwar boards or administrations, and nearly all of them were compelled to\r\nestablish some sort of labor division or tribunal within each separate\r\nfield. The demands made upon the labor market by war industry were heavy,\r\nfor the withdrawal of labor into the army created an inevitable scarcity\r\nat the moment when production must be increased, and the different\r\nindustries naturally were brought to bid against each other; the value of\r\nany wage scale was constantly affected by the rising prices, while the\r\nintroduction of inexperienced workmen and women affected the conditions\r\nof piecework, so that the question of wages and conditions of labor gave\r\nrise to numerous discussions. The Labor Committee of the Council of\r\nNational Defense had undertaken to meet such problems as early as\r\nFebruary, 1917, but it was not until the beginning of the next year that\r\nthe Department of Labor underwent a notable reorganization with the\r\npurpose of effecting the coördination necessary to complete success.\r\n\r\nUnlike the food, fuel, and transportation problems, which were solved\r\nthrough new administrations not connected with the Department of\r\nAgriculture, the Bureau of Mines, or the Interstate Commerce Commission\r\nrespectively, that of labor was met by new bureaus and boards which were\r\norganic parts of the existing Department of Labor. In January, 1918, that\r\nDepartment undertook the formulation and administration of a national war\r\nlabor policy. Shortly afterwards delegates of the National Industrial\r\nConference Board and of the American Federation of Labor, representing\r\ncapital and labor, worked out a unanimous report upon the principles to\r\nbe followed in labor adjustment. To enforce these recommendations the\r\nPresident, on April 9, 1918, appointed a National War Labor Board, which\r\nuntil November sat as a court of final appeal in labor disputes. An index\r\nof the importance of the Board was given by the choice of ex-President\r\nTaft as one of its chairmen. A month later, a War Labor Policies Board\r\nwas added to the system to lay down general rules for the use of the War\r\nLabor Board in the rendering of its judgments.\r\n\r\nNot merely enthusiasm and brains enabled America to make the\r\nextraordinary efforts demanded by the exigencies of war. Behind every\r\nline of activity lay the need of money: and the raising of money in\r\namounts so large that they passed the comprehension of the average\r\ncitizen, forms one of the most romantic stories of the war. It is the\r\nstory of the enthusiastic coöperation of rich and poor: Wall Street and\r\nthe humblest foreign immigrants gave of their utmost in the attempt to\r\nprovide the all-important funds for America and her associates in the\r\nwar. Citizens accepted the weight of income and excess profit taxes far\r\nheavier than any American had previously dreamed of. They were asked in\r\naddition to buy government bonds to a total of fourteen billions, and\r\nthey responded by oversubscribing this amount by nearly five billions. Of\r\nthe funds needed for financing the war, the Government planned to raise\r\nabout a third by taxation, and the remainder by the sale of bonds and\r\ncertificates maturing in from five to thirty years. It would have proved\r\nthe financial statesmanship of McAdoo had he dared to raise a larger\r\nproportion by taxation; for thus much of the inflation which inevitably\r\nresulted from the bond issues might have been avoided. But the Government\r\nfeared alike for its popularity and for the immediate effect upon\r\nbusiness, which could not safely be discouraged. As it was, the excess\r\nprofit taxes aroused great complaint. The amount raised in direct\r\ntaxation represented a larger proportion of the war budget than any\r\nforeign nation had been able to secure from tax revenues.\r\n\r\nIn seeking to sell its bonds the Government, rather against its will, was\r\ncompelled to rely largely upon the capitalists. The large popular\r\nsubscriptions would have been impossible but for the assistance and\r\nenthusiasm shown by the banks in the selling campaign. Wall Street and\r\nthe bankers of the country were well prepared and responded with all\r\ntheir strength, a response which deserves the greater credit when we\r\nremember the lack of sympathy which had existed between financial circles\r\nand President Wilson's Administration. Largely under banking auspices the\r\ngreatest selling campaign on record was inaugurated. Bonds were placed on\r\nsale at street corners, in theaters, and restaurants; disposed of by\r\neminent operatic stars, moving-picture favorites, and wounded heroes from\r\nthe front. Steeple jacks attracted crowds by their perilous antics, in\r\norder to start the bidding for subscriptions. Villages and isolated\r\nfarmhouses were canvassed. The banks used their entire machinery to\r\ninduce subscriptions, offering to advance the subscription price. When\r\nduring the first loan campaign the rather unwise optimism of the Treasury\r\ncooled enthusiasm for a moment, by making it appear that the loan could\r\nbe floated without effort, Wall Street took up the load. The first loan\r\nwas oversubscribed by a billion. The success of the three loans that\r\nfollowed was equally great; the fourth, coming in October, 1918, was set\r\nfor six billion dollars, the largest amount that had ever been asked of\r\nany people, and after a three weeks' campaign, seven billions were\r\nsubscribed. Quite as notable as the amount raised was the progressive\r\nincrease in the number of subscribers, which ranged from four million\r\nindividuals in the first loan to more than twenty-one millions in the\r\nfourth. Equally notable, as indicating the educative effect of the war\r\nand of the sale of these Liberty Bonds, was the successful effort to\r\nencourage thrift. War Savings societies were instituted and children\r\nsaved their pennies and nickels to buy twenty-five cent \"thrift stamps\"\r\nwhich might be accumulated to secure interest-bearing savings\r\ncertificates. Down to November 1, 1918, the sale of such stamps totalled\r\n$834,253,000, with a maturity value of more than a billion dollars.\r\n\r\nThe successful organizing of national resources to supply military\r\ndemands obviously depended, in the last instance, upon the education of\r\nthe people to a desire for service and sacrifice. The Liberty Loan\r\ncampaigns, the appeals of Hoover, and the Fuel Administration, all were\r\nof importance in producing such morale. In addition the Council of\r\nNational Defense, through the Committee on Public Information, spread\r\npamphlets emphasizing the issues of the war and the objects for which we\r\nwere fighting. At every theater and moving-picture show, in the factories\r\nduring the noon hours, volunteer speakers told briefly of the needs of\r\nthe Government and appealed for coöperation. These were the so-called\r\n\"Four Minute Men.\" The most noted artists gave their talent to covering\r\nthe billboards with patriotic and informative posters. Blue Devils who\r\nhad fought at Verdun, captured tanks, and airplanes, were paraded in\r\norder to bring home the realities of the life and death struggle in which\r\nAmerica was engaged. The popular response was inspiring. In the face of\r\nthe national enthusiasm the much-vaunted plans of the German Government\r\nfor raising civil disturbance fell to the ground. Labor was sometimes\r\ndisorganized by German propaganda; destruction of property or war\r\nmaterial was accomplished by German agents; and valuable information\r\nsometimes leaked out to the enemy. But the danger was always kept in\r\ncheck by the Department of Justice and also by a far-reaching citizen\r\norganization, the American Protective League. Equally surprising was the\r\nlack of opposition to the war on the part of pacifists and socialists. It\r\nwas rare to find the \"sedition\" for which some of them were punished,\r\nperhaps over-promptly, translated from words to actions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe organization of the industrial resources of the nation was\r\ncomplicated by the same conditions that affected the purely military\r\nproblems--decentralization and the emergency demands that resulted from\r\nthe sudden decision to send a large expeditionary force to France. The\r\nvarious organizing boards were so many individual solutions for\r\nindividual problems. At the beginning of the war the Council of National\r\nDefense represented the only attempt at a central business organization,\r\nand as time went on the importance and the influence of the Council\r\ndiminished. The effects of decentralization became painfully apparent\r\nduring the bitter cold of the winter months, when the fuel,\r\ntransportation, and food crises combined to threaten almost complete\r\nparalysis of the economic and military mobilization.\r\n\r\nThe distrust and discouragement that followed brought forth furious\r\nattacks upon the President's war policies, led not merely by Roosevelt\r\nand Republican enemies of the Administration, but by Democratic Senators.\r\nThe root of the whole difficulty, they contended, lay in the fact that\r\nWilson had no policy. They demanded practically the abdication of the\r\npresidential control of military affairs, either through the creation of\r\na Ministry of Munitions or of a War Cabinet. In either case Congress\r\nwould control the situation through its definition of the powers of the\r\nnew organization and the appointment of its personnel.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson utilized the revolt to secure the complete\r\ncentralization toward which he had been aiming. He fought the new\r\nproposals on the ground that they merely introduced new machinery to\r\ncomplicate the war organization, and he insisted that true policy\r\ndemanded rather an increase in the efficiency of existing machinery. If\r\nthe General Staff and the War Industries Board were given power to\r\nsupervise and execute as well as to plan, the country would have the\r\nmachinery at hand capable of forming a central organization, which could\r\ndetermine in the first place what was wanted and where, and in the second\r\nplace how it could be supplied. All that was necessary was to give the\r\nPresident a free hand to effect any transfer of organization, funds, or\r\nfunctions in any of the existing departments of government, without being\r\ncompelled to apply to Congress in each case.\r\n\r\nThe struggle between Wilson and his opponents was sharp, but the\r\nPresident carried the day. He exerted to the full his influence on\r\nCongress and utilized skillfully the argument that at this moment of\r\ncrisis a swapping of horses might easily prove fatal. Opposing\r\nCongressmen drew back at the thought of shouldering the responsibility\r\nwhich they knew the President would throw upon them if he were defeated.\r\nOn May 20, 1918, the Overman Act became law, giving to the President the\r\nblanket powers which he demanded and which he immediately used to\r\ncentralize the military and industrial organization. Bureau chiefs were\r\nbitter in their disapproval; the National Guard grumbled, even as it\r\nfought its best battles in France; politicians saw their chance of\r\ninfluencing military affairs disappear; business men complained of the\r\neconomic dictatorship thus secured by the President. But Mr. Wilson was\r\nat last in a position to effect that which seemed to him of greatest\r\nimportance--the concentration of responsibility and authority.\r\n\r\nUpon the shoulders of the President, accordingly, must rest in the last\r\ninstance the major portion of the blame and the credit to be distributed\r\nfor the mistakes and the achievements of the military and economic\r\norganization. He took no part in the working out of details. Once the\r\ndevelopment of any committee of organization had been started, he left\r\nthe control of it entirely to those who had been placed in charge. But he\r\nwould have been untrue to his nature if he had not at all times been\r\ndetermined to keep the reins of supreme control in his own hands. His\r\nopponents insisted that the organization was formed in spite of him. It\r\nis probable that he did not himself perceive the crying need for\r\ncentralization so clearly in 1917 as he did in 1918; and the protests of\r\nhis political opponents doubtless brought the realization of its\r\nnecessity more definitely home to him. But there is no evidence to\r\nindicate that the process of centralization was forced upon him against\r\nhis will and much to show that he sought always that concentration of\r\nresponsibility and power which he insisted upon in politics. The task was\r\nherculean; ironically enough it was facilitated by the revolt against his\r\nwar policies which resulted in the Senate investigation and the Overman\r\nAct. His tactics were by no means above reproach, and his entire policy\r\nnearly went on the rocks in the winter of 1917 because of his inability\r\nto treat successfully with the Senate and with Republican Congressmen.\r\n\r\nWhen all is said, however, the organization that was developed during the\r\nlast six months of the war transported and maintained in Europe more than\r\na million and a half American soldiers; at home it maintained two\r\nmillions more, ready to sail at the earliest opportunity; and it was\r\nprepared to raise and equip an army of five and a half millions by June\r\n30, 1920. The process had been slow and the results were not apparent for\r\nmany months. Furthermore, because of the intensity of the danger and the\r\nabsolute need of victory, cherished traditions were sacrificed and steps\r\ntaken which were to cost much later on; for the price of these\r\nachievements was inevitable reaction and social unrest. But with all the\r\nmistakes and all the cost, the fact still remains that the most gigantic\r\ntransformation of history--the transformation of an unmilitary and\r\npeace-loving nation of ninety million souls into a belligerent power--was\r\nsuccessfully accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE FIGHTING FRONT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe encouragement given to the Allies by the entrance of the United\r\nStates into the war injected a temporary ray of brightness into the\r\nsituation abroad, but with the realization that long months must elapse\r\nbefore American aid could prove effective, came deep disappointment. The\r\nspring of 1917 did not bring the expected success to the French and\r\nBritish on the western front; and the summer and autumn carried intense\r\ndiscouragement. Hindenburg, early in the spring, executed a skillful\r\nretreat on the Somme front, which gave to the Allies the territory to\r\nwhich their previous capture of Peronne and Bapaume entitled them. But\r\nthe Germans, losing some square miles, saved their troops and supplies.\r\nBritish attacks on the north gained little ground at terrible cost. The\r\nFrench offensive, planned by Nivelle, which was designed to break the\r\nGerman line, had to be given up after bloody checks. There was mutiny in\r\nthe French armies and the morale of the civilian population sank.\r\n\r\nThe hopes that had been aroused by the Russian revolution were seen to be\r\ndeceptive; instead of a national movement directed towards a more active\r\nstruggle against Germany, it now appeared in its true colors as a demand\r\nfor peace and land above everything. The Brusilov attack, which the\r\nAllies insisted upon, proved to be a flash in the pan and ended with the\r\ncomplete military demoralization of Russian armies. The collapse of the\r\nItalian forces at Caporetto followed. Italy was not merely unable to\r\ndistract the attention of the Central Powers by a determined offensive\r\nagainst Austria, but she threatened to become a liability; no one knew\r\nhow many French divisions might have to be diverted to aid in the defense\r\nof the new Piave front. General Byng's break of the German lines at\r\nCambrai was more than offset by the equally brilliant German\r\ncounter-attack. And every day the submarine was taking its toll of Allied\r\nshipping.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Italian débâcle, the Bolshevik revolution of November\r\nindicated that Russia would wholly withdraw and that that great potential\r\nsource of man-power for the Allies could no longer be counted upon.\r\nAllied leaders realized that Germany would be able to transfer large\r\nnumbers of troops to the western front, and became seriously alarmed.\r\n\"The Allies are very weak,\" cabled General Pershing, on the 2d of\r\nDecember, \"and we must come to their relief this year, 1918. The year\r\nafter may be too late. It is very doubtful if they can hold on until 1919\r\nunless we give them a lot of support this year.\" Showing that the\r\nschedule of troop shipments would be inadequate and complaining that the\r\nactual shipments were not even being kept up to programme, Pershing\r\ninsisted upon the importance of the most strenuous efforts to secure\r\nextra tonnage, which alone would make it possible for the American army\r\nto take a proper share in the military operations of 1918.\r\n\r\nThe serious representations of General Pershing were reinforced by\r\nColonel House when he returned from abroad on the 15th of December. For\r\nsix weeks he had been in conference, as head of a war mission, with the\r\nAllied political and military leaders, who now realized the necessity of\r\nunity of plan. Because of his personal intimacy with French and British\r\nstatesmen and his acknowledged skill in negotiations, House had done\r\nmuch to bring about Allied harmony and to pave the way for a supreme\r\nmilitary command. Like Pershing, he was convinced of the danger\r\nthreatening the Allies, and from the moment of his return began the\r\nspeeding-up process, which was to result in the presence of a large\r\nAmerican force on the battle front at the moment of crisis in the early\r\nsummer of 1918.\r\n\r\nTonnage was obviously the vital factor upon which effective military\r\nassistance depended. The United States had the men, although they were\r\nnot completely trained, but the apparent impossibility of transporting\r\nthem formed the great obstacle. The problem could not have been solved\r\nwithout the assistance of the Allies. With the threat of the German\r\ndrive, and especially after the first German victories of 1918, they\r\nbegan to appreciate the necessity of sacrificing everything to the\r\ntonnage necessary to transport American soldiers to France. After long\r\nhesitation they agreed to a pooling of Allied tonnage for this purpose.\r\nMost of the Allied ships ultimately furnished the United States were\r\nprovided by the British, whose transports carried a million American\r\ntroops to France. French and Italian boats transported 112,000; our own\r\ntransports, 927,000.\r\n\r\nThus by relying largely upon the shipping assistance of our associates in\r\nthe war we were able to respond to the demands of General Pershing and,\r\nlater, Marshal Foch. And thus came about the extraordinary development of\r\nour military programme from the thirty to the eighty and one hundred\r\ndivision plans, which resulted in tremendous confusion, but which also\r\nultimately ensured Allied victory in 1918. Until the end of the year\r\n1917, we had put into France only 195,000 troops, including 7500 marines,\r\nan average of about 28,000 a month. From December to February the average\r\nrose to 48,000; from March to May it was 149,000; and from June to August\r\nit was 290,000 men a month. During the four months from May to August\r\ninclusive, 1,117,000 American troops were transported to France.\r\n\r\nAltogether about two million Americans were sent to France, without the\r\nloss of a single man while under the escort of United States vessels. No\r\nnavy troop transports were torpedoed on east-bound trips although three\r\nwere sunk on the return trip with loss of 138 lives. To the American and\r\nBritish navies must go the credit for carrying through this stupendous\r\nfeat, and in the work of assuring the safety of the troop transports the\r\nnavy of the United States may claim recognition for the larger share,\r\nsince 82 per cent of the escorts furnished were American cruisers and\r\ndestroyers. It was a nerve-racking and tantalizing experience--the troop\r\nships sailing in echelon formation, preceded, followed, and flanked by\r\ndestroyers; at night every glimmer of light eclipsed, the ships speeding\r\nahead in perfect blackness, each inch of the sea swept by watchful eyes\r\nto discover the telltale ripple of a periscope or the trail of a torpedo,\r\ngun crews on the alert, depth bombs ready. Nor was the crossing anything\r\nlike a vacation yachting cruise for the doughboys transported, packed as\r\nthey were like sardines two and three decks below the waterline, brought\r\nup in shifts to catch a brief taste of fresh air, assailed at once by\r\nhomesickness, seasickness, and fears of drowning like rats in a trap.\r\n\r\nThe work of the navy was far more extensive, moreover, than the safe\r\nconvoying of troop ships, important though that was. The very first\r\ncontingent of American overseas fighting forces was made up of two\r\nflotillas of destroyers, which upon the declaration of war had been sent\r\nto Queenstown where they were placed under the command of Admiral William\r\nS. Sims. Their main function was to hunt submarines, which, since the\r\ndecree of the 1st of February, had succeeded in committing frightful\r\nravages upon Allied commerce and seriously threatened to starve the\r\nBritish Isles. Admiral Sims was two years older than Pershing and as\r\ntypical a sailor as the former was soldier. With his bluff and genial,\r\nyet dignified, manner, his rubicund complexion, closely-trimmed white\r\nbeard, and piercing eyes, no one could have mistaken his calling. Free of\r\nspeech, frank in praise and criticism, abounding in indiscretions, he\r\npossessed the capacity to make the warmest friends and enemies. He was an\r\nardent admirer of the British, rejoiced in fighting with them, and\r\nashamed that our Navy Department was unwilling to send more adequate and\r\nimmediate assistance to their fleet. Sims's international reputation as\r\nan expert in naval affairs was of long standing. Naval officers in every\r\ncountry of Europe knew of him as the inventor of a system of fire control\r\nwhich had been adopted by the great navies of the world, and it was\r\nlargely because of his studies and devices that the extraordinary records\r\nof the American fleets at target practice had been secured. The British\r\nnaval officers reciprocated Sims's admiration for them, and, according to\r\npopular belief, it was at their special request that he had been sent to\r\ncommand our overseas naval forces. No one else could have obtained such\r\neffective coöperation between the British and American fleets.\r\n\r\nWhile at first the major portion of the American fleet was retained in\r\nhome waters for the protection of American coasts and ports, a policy\r\nwhich aroused the stinging criticism of Admiral Sims, gradually the fleet\r\nadded strength to the Allied navies in their patrol of European coasts\r\nand the bottling-up of the German high seas fleet. Destroyer bases were\r\nmaintained at Queenstown, Brest, and Gibraltar, from which were\r\ndispatched constant patrols. Individual destroyers, during the first year\r\nof service overseas, steamed a total of 60,000 miles. Their crews were on\r\nthe watch in the dirtiest weather, unable to sleep, tossed and battered\r\nby the incessant rolling, without warm food, facing the constant peril of\r\nbeing swept overboard and knowing that their boat could not stop to pick\r\nthem up. American submarine-chasers and converted yachts, mine-sweepers\r\non their beneficent and hazardous duty, were equally active. Naval\r\naviators coöperated with the British to patrol the coasts in search of\r\nsubmarines. Late in 1917, six battleships were sent to join the British\r\nGrand Fleet, which was watching for the Germans in the North Sea, thus\r\nconstituting about twelve per cent of the guarding naval force. More\r\nimportant, perhaps, was the American plan for laying a mine barrage from\r\nthe Scotch coast across to Norwegian waters. The Ordnance Bureau of the\r\nnavy, despite the discouragement of British experts, manufactured the\r\nmines, 100,000 of them, and shipped them abroad in parts ready for final\r\nassembling. The American navy was responsible for eighty per cent of the\r\nlaying of the barrage, which when finished was 245 miles long and twenty\r\nmiles wide. The complete story of the achievements of the navy cannot now\r\nbe told in detail. It was not always inspiring, for numerous mistakes\r\nwere made. Confusion of counsels in the Naval Board left one important\r\nbombing squadron so bereft of supplies that after an expenditure of four\r\nmillions only two bombs were dropped in the entire course of its\r\noperations. But there are also to be remembered the unheralded stories of\r\nheroism and skill, such as the dash of the submarine-chasers and\r\ndestroyers through the mine fields at Durazzo, and the work of our naval\r\nguns in the attack on Zeebrugge.\r\n\r\nThe armies, safely brought to France, were meanwhile undergoing the\r\nessential intensive training, and the task of organizing the service of\r\nsupply was being undertaken. The training given in the United States\r\nbefore sailing had been in the ordinary forms of drill and tactics; now\r\nit was necessary that there should be greater specialization. Numerous\r\nschools for the training of officers were established. For the troops the\r\nplan for training allowed, according to the intent of General Pershing,\r\n\"a division one month for acclimatization and instruction in small units\r\nfrom battalions down, a second month in quiet trench sectors by\r\nbattalion, and a third month after it came out of the trenches when it\r\nshould be trained as a complete division in war of movement.\"[10] The\r\nentire process of training was a compromise between speed and efficiency.\r\nDuring the latter months of the war many of the American troops were put\r\non the battle-line when they were by no means sufficiently trained.\r\nCertain draft units were transported and thrown up to the front after\r\nexperience of a most superficial character; there are instances of men\r\ngoing into action without knowing how to load their rifles or adjust\r\ntheir gas masks properly. But on the whole the training given was\r\nsurprisingly effective in view of the speed with which it was\r\naccomplished. American skill with the rifle won the envy of foreign\r\nofficers, and the value of American troops in open warfare was soon to be\r\nacknowledged by the Germans.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: This plan could not be fulfilled for troops coming to\r\nFrance in 1918, because of lack of time.]\r\n\r\nThe same sort of centralization sought by Wilson in America obviously\r\nbecame necessary in France with the expanding plans for an enormous army.\r\nIn February, 1918, the Service of Supply was organized. With its\r\nheadquarters at Tours, the S. O. S. was responsible for securing,\r\norganizing, and distributing all the food, equipment, building materials,\r\nand other necessities demanded by the expeditionary force. In order to\r\nprovide for the quantities of essential supplies and to avoid the\r\ncongestion of the chief ports of France, certain ports were especially\r\nallotted to our army, of which the most important were St. Nazaire,\r\nBordeaux, and Brest. The first, a somnolent fishing village, was\r\ntransformed by the energy of American engineers into a first-class port\r\nwith enormous docks, warehouses, and supply depots; Brest rose in the\r\nspace of twelve months from the rank of a second-class port to one that\r\nmatched Hamburg in the extent of its shipping. In all, more than a dozen\r\nports were used by the Americans and in each extensive improvements and\r\nenlargements proved necessary. At Bordeaux not more than two ships a\r\nweek, of any size, could conveniently be unloaded prior to June, 1917.\r\nEight months later, docks a mile long had been constructed, concrete\r\nplatforms and electric cranes set up; within a year fourteen ships could\r\nbe unloaded simultaneously, the rate of speed being determined only by\r\nthe number of stevedores. For unloading purposes regiments of negroes\r\nwere stationed at each port.\r\n\r\nA few miles back from the coast were the base depots where the materials\r\nwere stored as they came from the ships. Thence distribution was made to\r\nthe intermediate depots in the cities of supply, and finally to the\r\ndepots immediately behind the fighting front. All these depots involved\r\nenormous building operations; at first the lumber was shipped, but later,\r\nAmerican lumber jacks were brought over to cut French forests. At one\r\nsupply depot three hundred buildings were put up, covering an area of six\r\nsquare miles, operated by 20,000 men, and holding in storage a hundred\r\nmillion dollars' worth of supplies. For distribution purposes it proved\r\nnecessary for American engineers to take over the construction and\r\nmaintenance of communications. At first American engines and cars were\r\noperated under French supervision; but ultimately many miles of French\r\nrailroads were taken over bodily by the American army and many more built\r\nby American engineers. More than 400 miles of inland waterways were also\r\nused by American armies. This transportation system was operated by\r\nAmerican experts of all grades from brakemen to railroad presidents,\r\nnumbering altogether more than 70,000.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet the difficulty of securing tonnage for supplies and to\r\navoid competition with the Allies, a General Purchasing Board was created\r\nfor the coördination of all purchases. Agents of this board were\r\nstationed in the Allied countries, in Switzerland, Holland, and Spain,\r\nwho reconnoitered resources, analyzed requirements, issued forecasts of\r\nsupplies, supervised the claims of foreign governments on American raw\r\nmaterials, and procured civilian manual labor. Following the\r\nestablishment of the supreme interallied command, the Interallied Board\r\nof Supplies was organized in the summer of 1918, with the American\r\npurchasing agent as a member. Other activities of the S. O. S., too\r\nnumerous to recount in detail, included such important tasks as the\r\nreclassification of personnel, the installation and operation of a\r\ngeneral service of telephone and telegraph communication, with 115,500\r\nkilometers of lines, and the renting and requisitioning of the land and\r\nbuildings needed by the armies. It was a gigantic business undertaking,\r\norganized at top speed, involving tremendous expenditure. Its success\r\nwould have been impossible without the coöperation of hundreds of men of\r\nbusiness, who found in it a sphere of service which enabled the army to\r\nutilize the proverbial American genius for meeting large problems of\r\neconomic organization. At the time of the armistice the S. O. S. reached\r\na numerical strength in personnel of 668,000, including 23,000 civilian\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, Pershing had been determined that the American\r\nExpeditionary Force should ultimately operate as an independent unit,\r\nalthough in close coöperation with the Allies. During the autumn of 1917\r\nthe disasters in Italy and the military demoralization of Russia had led\r\nto the formation of the Supreme Military Council of the Allies, upon\r\nwhich the United States was represented by General Tasker Bliss, whose\r\nrough visage and gruff manner gave little indication of his wide\r\ninterests. Few suspected that this soldierly character took secret\r\npleasure in the reading of Latin poets. The coördination that resulted\r\nfrom the creation of the Supreme Council, however, proved insufficient to\r\nmeet the crisis of the spring of 1918.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of March, the Germans attacked in overwhelming force the\r\nsouthern extremity of the British lines, near where they joined the\r\nFrench, and disastrously defeated General Gough's army. The break-through\r\nwas clean and the advance made by the endless waves of German\r\nshock-troops appalling. Within eight days the enemy had swept forward to\r\na depth of fifty-six kilometers, threatening the capture of Amiens and\r\nthe separation of the French and British. As the initial momentum of the\r\nonslaught was lost, the Allied line was re-formed with the help of French\r\nreserves under Fayolle. But the Allies had been and still were close to\r\ndisaster. Complete unity of command was essential. It was plain also, in\r\nthe words of Pershing's report, that because of the inroads made upon\r\nBritish and French reserves, \"defeat stared them in the face unless the\r\nnew American troops should prove more immediately available than even the\r\nmost optimistic had dared to hope.\" The first necessity was satisfied\r\nearly in April. The extremity of the danger reinforced the demand long\r\nmade by the French, and supported by President Wilson through Colonel\r\nHouse, that a generalissimo be appointed. The British finally sank their\r\nobjection, and on the 28th of March it was agreed that General Ferdinand\r\nFoch should be made commander-in-chief of all the Allied armies with the\r\npowers necessary for the strategic direction of all military operations.\r\nThe decision was ratified on the 3d and approved by President Wilson on\r\nthe 16th of April.\r\n\r\nGeneral Foch had long been recognized as an eminent student of strategy,\r\nand he had proved his practical capacity in 1914 and later. It was he who\r\ncommanded the French army that broke the German line at the marshes of\r\nSt. Gond, in the battle of the Marne, thus assuring victory to Joffre,\r\nand he had later in the year secured fresh laurels in the first battle of\r\nthe Yser. At the moment of extreme danger to Italy, after Caporetto, in\r\n1917, he had been chosen to command the assisting force sent down by the\r\nFrench. Unsentimental and unswayed by political factors, he was\r\ntemperamentally and intellectually the ideal man for the post of supreme\r\nAllied commander; he was furthermore supported by the capacity of General\r\nPétain, the French commander-in-chief, and by a remarkable group of army\r\ncommanders, among whom Fayolle, Mangin, and Gouraud were to win\r\nparticular fame. But he lacked troops, the Germans disposing of 200\r\ndivisions as against 162 Allied divisions.\r\n\r\nHence the hurry call sent to America and hence the heavy sacrifice now\r\nforced upon Pershing. Much against his will and only as a result of\r\nextreme pressure, the American commander-in-chief agreed to a temporary\r\ncontinuance of the brigading of American troops with the British and the\r\nFrench. He had felt all along that \"there was every reason why we could\r\nnot allow them to be scattered among our Allies, even by divisions, much\r\nless as replacements, except by pressure of pure necessity.\" He disliked\r\nthe emphasis placed by the Allies upon training for trench warfare; he\r\nfeared the effect of the lack of homogeneity which would render the mixed\r\ndivisions \"difficult to maneuver and almost certain to break up under the\r\nstress of defeat,\" and he believed that the creation of independent\r\nAmerican armies \"would be a severe blow to German morale.\" When the pinch\r\nof necessity came, however, Pershing sank his objections to amalgamation\r\nand, to his credit, agreed with a _beau geste_ and fine phrase which\r\nconcealed the differences between the Allied chiefs and won the heartiest\r\nsympathy from France and England. The principle of an independent American\r\nforce, however, Pershing insisted upon, and he made clear that the\r\namalgamation of our troops with the French and British was merely a\r\ntemporary expedient.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the stabilization of the battle-line near Amiens, the\r\nGermans began their second great drive, this time against the British\r\nalong the Lys, in Flanders. The initial success of the attack, which began\r\non the 9th of April, was undeniable, and Sir Douglas Haig himself admitted\r\nthe danger of the moment: \"Every position must be held to the last man.\r\nThere must be no retirement. With our backs to the wall and believing in\r\nthe justice of our cause, each one of us must fight to the end. The safety\r\nof our homes and the freedom of mankind depend alike upon the conduct of\r\neach one of us at this critical moment.\" The value of Allied unity of\r\ncommand now became apparent, for heavy French reinforcements were brought\r\nup in time to help stave off the German drive on the Channel Ports.\r\n\r\nBut still the demand went up for more men and ships. \"Scrap before\r\nshipping every pound that takes tonnage and is not necessary to the\r\nkilling of Germans,\" wrote a French military authority. \"Send the most\r\ninfantry by the shortest route to the hottest corner. No matter what flag\r\nthey fight under, so long as it is an Allied flag.\" On the 27th of May\r\nthe Germans caught Foch by surprise and launched a violent attack on the\r\nChemin des Dames, between Soissons and Berry-au-Bac. This formed the\r\nthird phase of their great offensive. In four days they pushed before\r\nthem the tired French divisions, sent into that sector to recuperate, a\r\ndistance of fifty kilometers and reached the Marne. Again, as in 1914,\r\nParis began to empty, fearful of capture. A statement sent to Wilson on\r\nthe 2d of June and signed by Clemenceau, Lloyd George, and Orlando, read\r\nas follows: \"There is great danger of the war being lost unless the\r\nnumerical inferiority of the Allies can be remedied as rapidly as\r\npossible by the advent of American troops.... We are satisfied that\r\nGeneral Foch ... is not over-estimating the needs of the case.\" Such was\r\nthe peril of the Allies. But in the month of May 245,000 Americans had\r\nbeen landed, and in the following month there were to be 278,000 more.\r\n\r\nPrevious to June, 1918, the participation of American troops in military\r\noperations had been of comparative unimportance and less for tactical\r\npurposes than as a part of their training. In October, 1917, the First\r\nDivision had been sent into trenches on the quiet Lorraine front and had\r\nengaged in raids and counter-raids. Three other divisions, the Second, the\r\nForty-second, or \"Rainbow,\" and the Twenty-sixth from New England,\r\nfollowed, and by March, 1918, they were all described by Pershing as\r\n\"equal to any demands of battle action.\" On the 29th of April, the\r\nlast-named division was engaged in something more serious than a mere raid\r\nat Seicheprey, near St. Mihiel; the number of prisoners lost indicated\r\nlack of experience, but the vigor of the American counter-attack proved\r\ndefinitely the will to fight. That belligerent spirit was equally\r\ndisplayed by various engineering units which, during the break of General\r\nGough's army before the German assault of March, near St. Quentin, had\r\ndropped their tools, seized rifles, and, hastily organizing to cover the\r\nretreat, had secured valuable respite for various fleeing units.\r\n\r\nMore important yet, because of the moral effect achieved, was the\r\nengagement at Cantigny near Montdidier, on the 28th of May. The Americans\r\nlaunched their attack with skill as well as dash, and stood firm against\r\nthe violence of the German reaction; this they met without assistance\r\nfrom the French, who had been called to oppose the German advance on the\r\nMarne. Pershing spoke of the \"desperate efforts\" of the enemy at\r\nCantigny, \"determined at all costs to counteract the most excellent\r\neffect the American success had produced.\" For three days guns of all\r\ncalibers were vainly concentrated upon the new positions. Coming at the\r\nmoment of extreme discouragement, Cantigny was of an importance entirely\r\nout of proportion to the numbers involved. For months France had been\r\nawaiting American assistance. A year before the French had seen Pershing\r\nand the first few doughboys, but the long delay had caused them to lose\r\nthe confidence which that sight had aroused. Now suddenly came the news\r\nthat the Americans were arriving in tremendous numbers and from Cantigny,\r\nnorth and south along the lines, spread the report: \"These men will\r\nfight.\"\r\n\r\nFour days later at Château-Thierry,[11] Americans proved not merely the\r\nmoral but the practical value of their assistance. The German drive of the\r\n27th of May, beginning on the Chemin des Dames, had pushed south to the\r\nMarne and westward towards Meaux. The French falling back in haste had\r\nmaintained their lines intact, but were pessimistic as to the possibility\r\nof stopping the enemy advance. On the 31st of May, German vanguard units\r\nentered Château-Thierry, crossed the river, and planned to secure the\r\nbridges. At this moment American machine gunners of the Third Division\r\ncame up with a battalion of French colonials in support, drove the Germans\r\nback to the north bank, covered the retreat of the French forces across\r\nthe Marne, on the following day, and gave time to blow up the bridges. On\r\nthe same day, the 1st of June, northwest of Château-Thierry, the Second\r\nDivision came into line to support the wearied French, and as the latter\r\ncame filtering back and through, soon found itself meeting direct German\r\nassaults. Stretching across the road to Paris, with the French too weak to\r\nmake a stand, it blocked the German advance. Even so, the danger was not\r\nentirely parried, since the enemy held strong positions from Vaux\r\nnorthwest to Veuilly, which, when German reinforcements came up, would\r\nenable them to deliver deadly assaults. Those positions had to be taken.\r\nFrom the 6th to the 11th of June, American troops, among them marine\r\nregiments, struck viciously, concentrating against the railroad\r\nembankment at Bouresches and the hill of Belleau Woods. The stiffness of\r\nthe German defense, maintained by their best troops, was overcome by\r\nfearless rushing of machine-gun nests, ruthless mopping-up of isolated\r\nstragglers, and a final clearing of the Woods by heavy artillery fire. On\r\nthe 18th of June the Americans took the approaches to Torcy and on the 1st\r\nof July the village of Vaux. If the attack on Belleau Woods proved their\r\ncourage, the capture of Vaux vindicated their skill, for losses were\r\nnegligible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: The reader should distinguish the defensive operations at\r\nChâteau-Thierry, on the 1st of June, from the attack launched from this\r\nsector in July. Both are known as the battle of Château-Thierry.]\r\n\r\nThe Allied line was now in a position to contest actively any deepening\r\nof the Marne salient to the west, and American troops had so clearly\r\nproved their quality that Pershing could with justice demand a radical\r\nrevision of the Allied opinion that American soldiers were fit only for\r\nthe defense. His confidence in their fighting capacity was soon further\r\nput to the test and vindicated. On the 15th of July the Germans opened\r\nthe fourth and last of their great drives, with tremendous artillery fire\r\nfrom Rheims to the Marne. They hoped to capture the former, swing far to\r\nthe south and west, and, if they failed to take Paris, at least to draw\r\nsufficient troops from Flanders and Picardy as to assure a successful\r\ndrive on Amiens and the Channel Ports. For the first time, however, the\r\nelement of surprise in their attack was lacking. At the eastern end of\r\nthe battle-line General Gouraud, with whom were fighting the Forty-second\r\nDivision and four colored regiments, warned of the moment of attack,\r\nwithdrew his front lines and permitted the Germans to shell empty\r\ntrenches; all important positions he held firmly. On the Marne, east of\r\nChâteau-Thierry, the enemy succeeded in crossing the river in the early\r\nmorning. At various points the American line was compelled to yield,\r\nalthough one of the American regiments stood its ground while on either\r\nflank the Germans, who had gained a footing on the south bank, pressed\r\nforward; it was, according to Pershing's report, \"one of the most\r\nbrilliant pages in our military annals.\" At noon, heedless of the warning\r\ngiven by the French commander, American reinforcements launched a strong\r\ncounter-attack and drove the enemy back to the river; on the next morning\r\nno Germans were to be found on the south bank in front of the American\r\ntroops. During the next two days German efforts to press forward were\r\nunrelaxing but in vain, and on the 18th of July, Foch launched his\r\ncounter-offensive.\r\n\r\nThe inherent weakness of the Marne salient from the German point of view\r\nand the opportunity which it offered the Allied command had not been\r\nforgotten by the generalissimo. Foch waited until the enemy had spent his\r\nstrength in the attacks around Rheims and on the Marne, then struck\r\nfiercely between Soissons and Château-Thierry. The spearhead of the main\r\ndrive was composed of the First and Second American Divisions,\r\nimmediately to the south of Soissons, who were operating under Mangin\r\nwith the First French Moroccan Division between them. Straightway,\r\nwithout the orthodox preliminary artillery fire, a deep thrust was made\r\nagainst the western side of the salient; near Soissons, despite fierce\r\nresistance, advances of from eight to ten kilometers and large numbers of\r\nprisoners were reported in the first twenty-four hours. \"Due to the\r\nmagnificent dash and powers displayed on the field of Soissons by our\r\nFirst and Second Divisions,\" said Pershing, \"the tide of war was\r\ndefinitely turned in favor of the Allies.\" Further to the south, the\r\nFourth and Twenty-sixth Divisions crossed the road running from\r\nChâteau-Thierry to Soissons, pushing east; while from the southern bank\r\nof the Marne, the Third Division pushed north across the river. It was\r\nobvious to the Germans that retreat from the perilous salient must\r\nproceed at once, especially as Franco-British counter-attacks on the\r\neastern side threatened to close it at the neck and cut the main line of\r\nGerman withdrawal. The retreat was executed with great skill and valor.\r\nWhile holding on the sides, the enemy forces were slowly pulled back from\r\nthe apex, striving to win time to save artillery, although they must\r\nperforce lose or destroy great quantities of ammunition. Against the\r\nretreating foe fresh American divisions were hurled. On the 25th of July\r\nthe Forty-second division relieved the Twenty-sixth, advancing toward the\r\nVesle, with elements of the Twenty-eighth, until relieved on August 3d,\r\nby the Fourth Division. Farther east the Thirty-second had relieved the\r\nThird. The Americans had to face withering fire from machine-gun nests\r\nand fight hand to hand in the crumbled streets of the Champagne villages.\r\nHere were carried on some of the fiercest conflicts of American military\r\nhistory. Finally on the 6th of August the Germans reached the line of the\r\nVesle, their retreat secured, although their losses had been terrific.\r\nBut the pause was only momentary. Before they could bring up\r\nreplacements, the British launched their great drive south of the Somme,\r\nthe American Twenty-eighth, Thirty-second, and Seventy-seventh divisions\r\ncrossed the Vesle pushing the Germans before them, and there began what\r\nLudendorff in his memoirs calls \"the last phase.\"\r\n\r\nPershing had not lost sight of his original object, which was to assemble\r\nthe American divisions into a separate army. After the victories of July,\r\nwhich wiped out the Marne salient, and those of August, which put the\r\nenemy definitely on the defensive, he felt that \"the emergency which had\r\njustified the dispersion of our divisions had passed.\" Soon after the\r\nsuccessful British attack, south of Amiens, he overcame the objections of\r\nFoch and concluded arrangements for the organization of this army, which\r\nwas to operate in the Lorraine sector.[12] It contained 600,000 men,\r\nfourteen American divisions and two French. On the 30th of August the\r\nsector was established and preparations made for the offensive, the first\r\nstep in which was to be the wiping out of the St. Mihiel salient. This\r\nsalient had existed since 1914, when the Germans, failing to storm the\r\nscarp protecting Verdun on the east, had driven a wedge across the lower\r\nheights to the south. The elimination of this wedge would have great\r\nmoral effect; it would free the Paris-Nancy railway from artillery fire;\r\nand would assure Pershing an excellent base for attack against the\r\nMetz-Sedan railway system and the Briey iron basin. The German positions\r\nwere naturally strong and had withstood violent French attacks in 1915.\r\nBut there was only one effective line of retreat and the enemy, if he\r\npersisted in holding the apex of the salient, risked losing his entire\r\ndefending force, should the sides be pressed in from the south and west.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Allied opposition to an American army was so strong as to\r\nbring threats of an appeal to Wilson. The President steadfastly supported\r\nPershing.]\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of September the attack was launched. It was originally\r\nplanned for the 15th, but word was brought that the Germans were about to\r\nretire at a rate which would have left none of them in the salient by\r\nthat date. Hence the attack was advanced by three days. The attempted\r\nwithdrawal secured the retreat of the German main force, but they were\r\nunable to save their rear guard. After four hours of vigorous artillery\r\npreparation, with the largest assemblage of aviation ever engaged in a\r\nsingle operation (mainly British and French) and with American heavy guns\r\nthrowing into confusion all rail movements behind the German lines, the\r\nadvancing Americans immediately overwhelmed all of the enemy that\r\nattempted to hold their ground. By the afternoon of the second day the\r\nsalient was extinguished, 16,000 prisoners were taken, 443 guns and large\r\nstores of supplies captured. American casualties totaled less than 7000.\r\nThe effects of the victory were incalculable. Apart from the material\r\nresults, hope of which had motivated the attack, the moral influence of\r\nthe battle of St. Mihiel in the making of American armies and the\r\ndiscouragement of the German High Command was of the first importance.\r\n\"An American army was an accomplished fact,\" wrote Pershing, \"and the\r\nenemy had felt its power. No form of propaganda could overcome the\r\ndepressing effect on the morale of the enemy of this demonstration of our\r\nability to organize a large American force and drive it successfully\r\nthrough his defense. It gave our troops implicit confidence in their\r\nsuperiority and raised their morale to the highest pitch. For the first\r\ntime wire entanglements ceased to be regarded as impassable barriers and\r\nopen-warfare training, which had been so urgently insisted upon, proved\r\nto be the correct doctrine.\"\r\n\r\nThe victory of St. Mihiel was merely the necessary prelude to greater\r\nthings. During the first week of September the Allied command decided\r\nthat the general offensive movement of their armies should be pressed as\r\nrapidly as possible, converging upon the main line of German retreat\r\nthrough Mezières and Sedan. The British were to pursue the attack in the\r\ndirection of Cambrai, the center of the French armies, west of Rheims,\r\nwas to drive the enemy beyond the Aisne, while the Americans were to\r\nattack through the Argonne and on both sides of the Meuse, aiming for\r\nSedan. Pershing was given his choice of the Champagne or Argonne sectors,\r\nand chose the latter, which was the more difficult, insisting that no\r\nother Allied troops possessed the offensive spirit which would be\r\nnecessary for success. In the meantime a new American army was to be\r\norganized, to operate south of Verdun and against Metz, in the spring of\r\n1919; in fact this was designed to be the chief American effort. As\r\nmatters turned out this second American army was ready to make its\r\noffensive early in November, but in September none of the Allied chiefs\r\nexpressed the opinion that the final victory could be achieved in 1918.\r\nSuch were the difficulties of terrain in the Argonne advance that the\r\nFrench did not believe that the attack could be pushed much beyond\r\nMontfaucon, between the forest and the Meuse, before winter forced a\r\ncessation of active operations.\r\n\r\nThe defensive importance of the Argonne for the Germans could hardly be\r\noverestimated, for if the railway line running through Sedan and Mezières\r\nwere severed, they would be cut in two by the Ardennes and would be\r\nunable to withdraw from France the bulk of their forces, which, left\r\nwithout supplies, would suffer inevitable disaster. As a consequence the\r\nArgonne had been strengthened by elaborate fortifications which, taken in\r\nconjunction with the natural terrain, densely wooded, covered with rugged\r\nheights, and marked by ridges running east and west, made it apparently\r\nimpregnable. The dense undergrowth, the bowlders, and the ravines offered\r\nideal spots for machine-gun nests. The Germans had the exact range of\r\neach important position.\r\n\r\nBut Pershing's confidence in the offensive valor of the Americans was\r\namply justified. On the morning of the 26th of September the initial\r\nattack was delivered, the main force of the blow falling east of the\r\nforest, where the natural strength of the enemy positions was less\r\nformidable. By noon of the second day Montfaucon was captured, and by the\r\n29th all the immediate objectives of the attack were secured. Losses were\r\nheavy, staff work was frequently open to severe criticism, communications\r\nwere broken at times, the infantry had not always received adequate\r\nartillery support, but the success of the drive was undeniable. Before the\r\nAmerican troops, however, still lay two more lines of defense, the Freya\r\nand Kriemhilde, and the Germans were bringing up their best divisions. On\r\nthe 4th of October the attack was renewed, in coöperation with the French\r\nunder Gouraud to the west of the forest who pressed forward actively; a\r\nweek's more bitter fighting saw the Argonne itself cleared of the enemy.\r\nHard struggles ensued, particularly around Grandpré, which was taken and\r\nretaken, while on the east of the Meuse the enemy was pushed back. By the\r\nend of the month the Kriemhilde line had been broken and the great railway\r\nartery was threatened. On the 1st of November the third phase of the great\r\nadvance began. The desperate efforts of the Germans to hold were never\r\nrelaxed, but by the evening of that day the American troops broke through\r\ntheir last defense and forced rapid retreat. Motor trucks were hurriedly\r\nbrought up for the pursuit, and by the fifth the enemy's withdrawal became\r\ngeneral. Two days later Americans held the heights which dominated Sedan,\r\nthe strategic goal, and the German line of communications was as good as\r\nsevered.\r\n\r\nThe converging offensive planned by Foch had succeeded. At Cambrai, Le\r\nCâtelet, and St. Quentin, the British, with whom were operating four\r\nAmerican divisions (the Twenty-seventh, Thirtieth, Thirty-seventh, and\r\nNinety-first), had broken the Hindenburg line; the French had pushed the\r\nGermans back from Laon, north of the Aisne, and with the British were\r\ndriving them into the narrow neck of the bottle; and now the French and\r\nAmericans, by their Argonne-Meuse advance had closed the neck. The enemy\r\nfaced an appalling disaster. A few weeks, if not days, of continued\r\nfighting meant the most striking military débâcle of history. Germany's\r\nallies had fallen from her. Turkey, Bulgaria, and Austria-Hungary had\r\nsued for peace and agreed to cease fighting on what amounted to terms of\r\nunconditional surrender. At home, the German Government faced revolution;\r\nthe Kaiser was about to abdicate and flee. On the 6th of November, the\r\nBerlin Government begged for an immediate armistice and five days later\r\nagreed to the stringent terms which the Allies presented. On the 11th of\r\nNovember, at eleven in the morning, firing ceased. Until the last second\r\nthe battle raged with a useless intensity dictated by stern military\r\ntradition: then perfect quiet on the battle front.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment we lack the perspective, perhaps, to evaluate\r\nexactly the share of credit which the American Expeditionary Force\r\ndeserves for the Allied military victory of 1918. Previous to June the\r\nmilitary contribution of the United States had no material effects. The\r\ndefense of Château-Thierry at the beginning of the month and the\r\noperations there and at Belleau Woods had, however, important practical\r\nas well as moral effects. The fighting was of a purely local character,\r\nbut it came at a critical moment and at a critical spot. It was a crisis\r\nwhen the importance of standing firm could not be overestimated, and the\r\ndefensive capacity of the French had been seriously weakened. The advance\r\nof American divisions with the French in the clearing of the Marne sector\r\nwas of the first military importance. The Americans were better qualified\r\nthan any European troops, at that stage of the war, to carry through\r\noffensive operations. They were fearless not merely because of natural\r\nhardihood, but through ignorance of danger; they were fresh and\r\nundefeated, physically and morally capable of undergoing the gruelling\r\npunishment delivered by the rearguards of the retreating Germans; their\r\ntraining had been primarily for open warfare. The same qualities were\r\nessential for the arduous and deadly task of breaking the German line in\r\nthe Argonne, which was the finishing blow on the western battlefields.\r\n\r\nThe defects of the American armies have been emphasized by European\r\nexperts. They point especially to the faulty staff-work, apparent in the\r\nArgonne particularly, which resulted in heavy losses. Staff-officers in\r\nnumerous instances seem to have been ill-trained and at times positively\r\nunequal to the exigencies of the campaign. Mistakes in selection account\r\nfor this to some degree, for men were appointed who were not equipped\r\ntemperamentally or intellectually for the positions given them. Equally\r\nfrequent were mistakes in the distribution of staff-officers. It is a\r\nnotable fact, however, that such mistakes resulted from inexperience and\r\nignorance and not from the intrusion of politics. President Wilson\r\nguaranteed to General Pershing complete immunity from the pleas of\r\npoliticians and in no war fought by the United States have political\r\nfactors played a rôle of such insignificance.\r\n\r\nFinally, and aside from the fighting qualities of the rank and file and\r\ncertain defects of the higher command, the Americans represented numbers;\r\nand without the tremendous numerical force transported to Europe in the\r\nspring and summer, the plans of Foch could not have been completed. We\r\nhave the testimony of the Allied chiefs in June that without American\r\nman-power they faced defeat. It is equally obvious that without the\r\n1,390,000 American troops which, by November, had appeared on the\r\nfighting line, the autumn of 1918 would not have witnessed the military\r\ntriumph of the Allies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE PATH TO PEACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe armistice of November 11, 1918, resulted directly from the military\r\ndefeat of German armies in France, following upon the collapse of Turkey,\r\nBulgaria, and Austria-Hungary. But there were many circumstances other\r\nthan military that led to Germany's downfall, and by no means of least\r\nimportance were the moral issues so constantly stressed by Wilson. His\r\nspeeches had been carefully distributed through the Central Empires; they\r\nhad done much to arouse the subject peoples of Austria-Hungary to revolt\r\nfor their freedom, and also to weaken the morale of the German people. The\r\nvalue of Wilson's \"verbiage drives\" was questioned in this country.\r\nAbroad, his insistence upon a peace of justice was generally reckoned a\r\nvital moral force in the political movements that supplemented the\r\nvictories of Marshal Foch. Jugoslavs consented to coöperate with their\r\nItalian enemies because they felt that \"Wilson's justice\" would guarantee\r\na fair court for their aspirations in the Adriatic; Magyars and Austrians\r\nthrew down their arms in the belief that his promise to \"be as just to\r\nenemies as to friends\" secured a better future than they could hope for\r\nthrough the continuance of the war; the leaders of the German Reichstag\r\ndemanded the Kaiser's abdication in November, under the impression that\r\nWilson had laid it down as a condition of peace.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when the United States entered the war it was obvious that\r\nWilson placed less emphasis upon defeating Germany than upon securing a\r\njust peace. Military victory meant nothing to him except as the road to\r\npeace. In his first war speeches the President, much to the irritation of\r\nmany Americans, insisted that the United States was fighting the\r\ngovernment and not the people of Germany. \"We have no quarrel,\" he said,\r\n\"with the German people. We have no feeling towards them but one of\r\nsympathy and friendship.\" In his Flag Day address he was careful not to\r\nattack \"Germany\" but only \"the military masters under whom Germany is\r\nbleeding.\" Certain effects of this attitude were to be seen in the\r\nReichstag revolt of July, 1917, led by that most sensitive of political\r\nweathercocks, Matthias Erzberger, which was designed to take political\r\ncontrol out of the hands of the military clique. That crisis, however,\r\nwas safely survived by Ludendorff, who remained supreme. President Wilson\r\nthen returned to the attack in his reply to the Pope's peace proposals of\r\nAugust. \"The object of this war is to deliver the free peoples of the\r\nworld from the menace and the actual power of a vast military\r\nestablishment controlled by an irresponsible government.... This power is\r\nnot the German people. It is the ruthless master of the German people....\r\nWe cannot take the word of the present rulers of Germany as a guarantee\r\nof anything that is to endure, unless explicitly supported by such\r\nconclusive evidence of the will and purpose of the German people\r\nthemselves as the other peoples of the world would be justified in\r\naccepting.\"\r\n\r\nThere was serpentine wisdom in these words, for their very vagueness\r\nattracted German liberals. Wilson did not demand a republic; he did not\r\ninsist upon the Kaiser's abdication, for which Germany was not then\r\nprepared; all that he asked was a government responsible to the people,\r\nand more and more the Germans were demanding that themselves.\r\nFurthermore, he again laid stress upon the fact that the Germans need not\r\nfear vengeance such as the Allies had threatened. \"Punitive damages, the\r\ndismemberment of empires, the establishment of selfish and exclusive\r\neconomic leagues, we deem inexpedient.\" The appeal was fruitless in its\r\nimmediate effects, for the political party leaders were still dominated\r\nby the military; but ultimately, in conjunction with a dozen other\r\nappeals, its influence acted like a subtle corrosive upon the German will\r\nto conquer.\r\n\r\nStill less successful were the attempts to win Austria away from her ally\r\nby secret diplomatic conversations. In these neither President Wilson nor\r\nhis personal adviser, Colonel House, placed great confidence. They had\r\nbeen undertaken by the French through Prince Sixtus of Bourbon, and in\r\nAugust, 1917, Major Armand of France discussed with the Austrian emissary,\r\nRevertata, possible means of bringing about peace between Austria and the\r\nAllies. Lloyd George enthusiastically approved this attempt to drive a\r\nwedge between Austria and Germany, was anxious to send Lord Reading as\r\nintermediary, and, upon the refusal of the latter to undertake the\r\nmission, actually dispatched General Smuts to Switzerland. The Emperor\r\nCarl seemed sincerely anxious to make sacrifices for peace and was urged\r\nby liberal counselors, such as Förster and Lammasch, in whom the Allies\r\nhad confidence, to meet many of the demands of his discontented Slav\r\nsubjects by granting autonomy to the Czechs, Poles, and Jugoslavs.\r\nNegotiations were hampered by the belief of the Italians that immediate\r\npeace with Austria would prevent them from securing the territories they\r\ncoveted; by the sullen obstinacy of the Magyars, who were jealous of their\r\nmastery over the Hungarian Slavs, and above all, as Colonel House had\r\nforeseen, by Austria's fear of Germany. In fact it was a stern ultimatum\r\nsent by Ludendorff that brought the wavering Carl back to his allegiance.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1917, however, talk of peace was in the air and a\r\ndefinite demand for its consideration was made in a noteworthy speech by\r\nLord Lansdowne, a Conservative leader in England. Negotiations were\r\ninaugurated between Germany and the new Bolshevik Government of Russia,\r\nand for a few weeks at the beginning of the new year the war-weary world\r\nseemed close to the possibility of a general understanding. For the first\r\ntime Lloyd George outlined in specific language the main terms that would\r\nbe considered by the Allies. It was President Wilson's opportunity.\r\nCareless of securing an overwhelming military victory, indeed unwilling to\r\ncrush Germany, anxious to pledge the Entente to his programme in this\r\nmoment of their discouragement, he formulated on January 8, 1918, his\r\nFourteen Points, upon which he declared the final peace settlement should\r\nbe based. His speech was at once an appeal to the liberals and\r\npeace-hungry of the Central Empires, a warning to the military clique in\r\nGermany then preparing to enforce degrading terms upon Russia, and a\r\nnotification to the Allies that the United States could not be counted\r\nupon to fight for selfish national interests. He reiterated the principles\r\nwhich had actuated the United States when it entered the war: \"What we\r\ndemand in this war, therefore, is nothing peculiar to ourselves. It is\r\nthat the world be made fit and safe to live in; and particularly that it\r\nbe made safe for every peace-loving nation which, like our own, wishes to\r\nlive its own life, determine its own institutions, be assured of justice\r\nand fair dealing by the other peoples of the world as against force and\r\nselfish aggression. All the peoples of the world are in effect partners in\r\nthis interest, and for our own part we see very clearly that unless\r\njustice be done to others it will not be done to us.\"\r\n\r\nOf the Fourteen Points into which he then divided his peace programme,\r\nthe first five were general in nature. The first insisted upon open\r\ndiplomacy, to begin with the approaching Peace Conference: \"Open\r\ncovenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there shall be no\r\nprivate international understandings of any kind.\" Next came \"absolute\r\nfreedom of navigation upon the seas ... alike in peace and in war.\" Then\r\n\"the removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the\r\nestablishment of an equality of trade conditions among all the nations\r\nconsenting to the peace.\" There followed a demand for the reduction of\r\narmaments \"to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety.\" The\r\nfifth point called for an \"impartial adjustment of all colonial claims,\r\nbased upon ... the interests of the populations concerned\" as well as\r\n\"the equitable claims of the government whose title is to be determined.\"\r\n\r\nThese generalizations were not so much God-given tables which must\r\ndetermine the international law of the future as they were subtle\r\ninducements to cease fighting; they were idealistic in tone, but\r\nintensely practical in purpose. They guaranteed to any Germans who\r\nwanted peace that there would be protection against British \"navalism,\"\r\nagainst the threatened Allied economic boycott, as well as a chance of\r\nthe return of the conquered colonies. The force of their seductiveness\r\nwas proved, when, many months later, in October, 1918, defeated Germany\r\ngrasped at them as a drowning man at a straw. At the same time Wilson\r\noffered to liberals the world over the hope of ending the old-style\r\nsecret diplomacy, and to business men and labor the termination of the\r\nsystem of competitive armaments, with their economic and moral waste. No\r\none would suggest that Wilson did not believe in the idealism of these\r\nfirst five points; no one should forget, however, that they were\r\ncarefully drafted with the political situation of the moment definitely\r\nin view. They might be construed as a charter for future international\r\nrelations, but they were designed primarily to serve as a diplomatic\r\nweapon for the present.\r\n\r\nEach of the succeeding eight points was more special in character, and\r\ndealt with the territorial and political problems of the warring states.\r\nThey provided for the evacuation and restoration of all conquered\r\nterritories in Europe, including Russia, Belgium, France, and the Balkan\r\nStates. The sovereignty of Belgium should be unlimited in future; the\r\n\"wrong done to France by Prussia in 1871 in the matter of Alsace-Lorraine\r\n... should be righted\"; Italian frontiers should be readjusted \"along\r\nclearly recognizable lines of nationality\"; the peoples of Austria-Hungary\r\n\"should be accorded the freest opportunity of autonomous development\"; the\r\nrelations of the Balkan States should be determined \"along historically\r\nestablished lines of allegiance and nationality\"; nationalities under\r\nTurkish rule should receive opportunity for security of life and\r\nautonomous development, and the Dardanelles should be permanently opened\r\nto all nations under international guarantees; an independent Polish state\r\nshould be erected to \"include the territories inhabited by indisputably\r\nPolish populations, which should be assured a free and secure access to\r\nthe sea.\"\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking these stipulations seemed to guarantee the moderate\r\nwar aims of the Entente and corresponded closely to the demands made by\r\nLloyd George; they certainly repudiated the extreme purposes attributed\r\nto German imperialists. And yet these eight points were so vague and\r\ncapable of such diverse interpretation that, like the first five general\r\npoints, they might prove not unattractive to liberals in Germany and\r\nAustria. France was not definitely promised Alsace-Lorraine; any hint at\r\nthe dismemberment of Austria-Hungary was carefully avoided; the\r\nreadjustment of Italian frontiers might mean much or little. What were\r\n\"historically established lines of allegiance and nationality\" in the\r\nBalkans? And if Poland were to include only populations \"indisputably\r\nPolish,\" was it possible to assure them \"free and secure access to the\r\nsea\"? The political advantage in such generalities was obvious. But there\r\nwas also great danger. The time might come when both belligerent camps\r\nwould accept the Fourteen Points and would still be uncertain of their\r\nmeaning and application. The struggle for definite interpretation would\r\nbe the real test. The President's fourteenth and last point, however, was\r\nunmistakable and expressed the ideal nearest his heart: \"A general\r\nassociation of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the\r\npurpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and\r\nterritorial integrity to great and small states alike.\"\r\n\r\nLater events have magnified the significance of this notable speech of\r\nthe 8th of January. It was a striking bid for peace, which indeed was not\r\nfar away and it ultimately formed the general basis of the peace terms\r\nactually drafted. But it contained nothing new. Its definition of the\r\nconditions of peace was vague; its formulation of principles followed\r\nexactly along the lines developed by President Wilson ever since he had\r\nadopted the idea of a League of Nations founded upon international\r\njustice. His summing up of the main principle underlying his whole policy\r\nwas merely the echo of his speeches for the past twelve-month: \"The\r\nprinciple of justice to all peoples and nationalities, and their right to\r\nlive on equal terms of liberty and safety with one another, whether they\r\nbe strong or weak.\" The importance of the speech does not lie in its\r\nnovelty but in its timeliness. It came at a moment when the world was\r\nanxiously listening and the undeniable idealism of its content assured to\r\nPresident Wilson, at least temporarily, the moral leadership of mankind.\r\nUnfortunately as the event proved, it promised more than could ever be\r\nsecured by any single man. The President was to pay the price for his\r\nleadership later when he encountered the full force of the reaction.\r\n\r\nAs a step toward immediate peace the speech of the Fourteen Points\r\nfailed. What might have been the result had von Hertling, Chancellor of\r\nGermany, and Czernin, in Austria, possessed full powers, it is difficult\r\nto say. But the military masters of Germany could not resist the\r\ntemptation which the surrender of Russia brought before their eyes. By\r\nsecuring the eastern front and releasing prisoners as well as troops\r\nthere, they would be able to establish a crushing superiority in the\r\nwest; France would be annihilated before the American armies could count,\r\nif indeed they were ever raised. Hence the heavy terms of Brest-Litovsk\r\nand Bucharest and the preparations for the great drive of March. As\r\nWilson said, \"The tragical circumstance is that this one party in Germany\r\nis apparently willing and able to send millions of men to their death to\r\nprevent what all the world now sees to be just.\" Thus Germany lost her\r\nlast chance to emerge from the war uncrushed.\r\n\r\nThe ruthless policy followed by Ludendorff and his associates gave the\r\nPresident new opportunities to appeal to the peoples of the Central\r\nEmpires. He incorporated in his speeches the phrases of the German\r\nSocialists. \"Self-Determination\" and \"No annexations and no indemnities\"\r\nwere phrases that had been made in Germany before Russia imported them;\r\nand when they formed the text of presidential addresses, many Germans,\r\ndespite themselves, doubtless felt a twinge of sympathy. Coupled with\r\nthese appeals went the President's warnings that if they persisted in\r\ntying up their fortunes with those of their rulers, they must share the\r\npenalties. If Germany insisted upon making force alone the deciding\r\nelement, then he must accept the challenge and abide the issue. \"There\r\nis, therefore, but one response possible from us: Force, Force to the\r\nutmost, Force without stint or limit, the righteous and triumphant Force\r\nwhich shall make Right the law of the world and cast every selfish\r\ndominion down in the dust.\" Neither the appeals nor the warnings of\r\nWilson had any effect apparent at the moment, and yet the seed was sown.\r\nDuring the victorious German drives of March, April, and May, opinion to\r\nthe east of the Rhine seemed to have rallied firmly behind the Teuton\r\nGovernment; but with the first slight setbacks of the following month the\r\nprocess of crumbling began. An American economist and banker, Henry C.\r\nEmery, then prisoner in Germany, tells of the pessimism prevalent as\r\nearly as June and the whispers of the approaching fall of the Kaiser. In\r\nhis memoirs Ludendorff lays the failure of the German armies in August to\r\nthe complete breakdown of the national spirit.\r\n\r\nThe end came with extraordinary speed. Already in September, after the\r\ndefection of Bulgaria and the startling success of Foch's converging\r\nmovement on Sedan, Germany knew that she was defeated. The Berlin\r\nGovernment turned to Wilson and on the 5th of October requested an\r\narmistice. At the same time Austria-Hungary made a similar request\r\noffering to negotiate on the basis of the Fourteen Points. Wilson's\r\nposition was delicate. He knew in September that the end was near and\r\nprepared for the situation in some degree by sending Colonel House abroad\r\nto be ready to discuss armistice terms with the Allies. But the sudden\r\ncharacter of the German collapse had intoxicated public opinion to such\r\nan extent that the political idealism which he had voiced ran the risk of\r\nbecoming swamped. If Germany were indeed helpless and the Allies\r\ntriumphant, there was the danger that, in the flush of victory, all the\r\npromises of a just peace would be forgotten. He must provide against such\r\na contingency. On the other hand he must secure guarantees that Germany\r\nhad indeed thrown off her militaristic cloak, as Prince Max of Baden, the\r\nnew Chancellor, insisted; and also that under cover of an armistice she\r\nmight not effect a withdrawal of her defeated armies, only to renew the\r\nstruggle under more favorable conditions on her own borders. He was\r\ncaught between the danger of German fraud and Allied exuberance.\r\n\r\nThere ensued a month of negotiations, during which the military victory of\r\nthe Allies was further assured, as described in the preceding pages. The\r\nGerman Government was first asked by Wilson if it accepted the Fourteen\r\nPoints and the similar stipulations made by the President in subsequent\r\naddresses. Replying in the affirmative, Prince Max then promised to\r\nacquiesce in armistice terms that would leave the military situation\r\nunchanged, and further agreed to order a cessation of unrestricted\r\nsubmarine warfare and of the wanton destruction caused by the German\r\narmies in their retreat. Finally he declared in answer to Wilson's demand,\r\nthat the request for an armistice and peace came from a government \"which\r\nis free from any arbitrary and irresponsible influence, and is supported\r\nby the approval of an overwhelming majority of the German people.\" The\r\nPresident then formally transmitted the correspondence to the Allies, and\r\nColonel House entered upon discussions to establish with them the\r\nunderstanding that the basis of the peace negotiations would be the\r\nWilsonian programme. He was successful; and the Fourteen Points, with\r\nreservation of the second, \"Freedom of the seas,\" were accepted by the\r\nAllied governments. The Allies, on the other hand, secured President\r\nWilson's approval of the principle that \"compensation will be made by\r\nGermany for all damage done to the civilian population of the Allies and\r\ntheir property by the aggression of Germany by land, by sea, and from the\r\nair.\" Upon this understanding the details of the armistice were left to\r\nthe military leaders. The terms as fixed reflected the military situation\r\non the fighting front and the political situation in Germany and placed\r\nGermany entirely in the power of the victors without possibility of\r\nrenewing the war. The conditions laid down were so stringent that until\r\nthe last moment a refusal by the German delegates seemed imminent; but on\r\nthe 11th of November, just before the expiration of the time limit allowed\r\nthem, they accepted the inevitable.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to regard the armistice as forced upon the Allies by\r\nPresident Wilson. Many persons abroad, as in this country, felt, it is\r\ntrue, that it was wrong to permit the peaceful withdrawal of the German\r\narmies, even though the full military advantages of victory were secured\r\nby the armistice conditions; the Allies ought, they argued, to impress\r\non the Germans the magnitude of their defeat on the field of battle, and\r\nthis could not be done so long as German soil had been free from warfare.\r\nGeneral Pershing was strongly opposed to the granting of an armistice.\r\nThe Allied chiefs knew, however, that although the continuation of the\r\nfighting would lead to the surrender of a great German force, every day\r\nwould cost the victorious armies a heavy toll of killed and wounded, and\r\nthe advantage to be gained thereby was at least questionable. This fact\r\nwas emphasized even by Marshal Foch. They hesitated, certainly, to accept\r\nthe Fourteen Points as the basis for peace, for they feared lest the\r\ninterpretation put upon them at the Peace Conference might rob them of\r\nwhat they believed to be the just fruits of victory. In both France and\r\nEngland there was, it is true, a body of liberal opinion which would not\r\nbrook open repudiation of the ideals that Wilson had sponsored during the\r\nwar and to which Allied ministers had themselves paid tribute. In each\r\ncountry there was another group demanding a \"peace of annihilation,\" with\r\nthe payment of all war costs by the defeated, but Lloyd George and\r\nClemenceau feared at the moment to raise this issue. Both England and\r\nFrance were dependent upon American assistance for the immediate future\r\nas they had been during the war. They needed American food, raw\r\nmaterials, and money. A break with Wilson, who for the moment was the\r\npopular hero of Europe, taken in conjunction with an economic crisis,\r\nmight be the signal for domestic disturbances if not revolution.\r\n\r\nThus with Germany helpless and the Allies at least outwardly accepting\r\nhis peace programme, Woodrow Wilson seemed to be master of the situation.\r\nAnd yet his power was more apparent than real. Apart from that moral\r\ninfluence which he exercised over the European liberals and which among\r\nsome of the working classes was so extreme that candles were burnt before\r\nhis picture, but which also was inevitably unstable and evanescent,\r\nWilson's power rested upon the fact that he was President of the United\r\nStates. But the nation was no longer united behind him or his policy, if\r\nindeed it had ever been so. That hatred and distrust which had marked the\r\nelectoral campaign of 1916, and which, stifled for the moment by entrance\r\ninto the war, had flamed out early in 1918 in the attack upon his war\r\nadministration, now in the autumn threatened an explosion of popular\r\ndisapprobation in some parts of the country. Men had long whispered\r\n\"autocrat\" but had generally been silenced during the war by the\r\nadmonition not to weaken the government by factious criticism. Now they\r\nbegan to shout it from the house-tops. Because of his inability to grasp\r\nthe importance of either tact or tactics, the President made the way of\r\nhis opponents easy for them.\r\n\r\nShortly before the Congressional elections of November, at the moment\r\nwhen he felt the need of national support in order to strengthen his\r\nposition with the Allies, the President was prevailed upon to issue an\r\nappeal to the electors, asking them to vote for Democratic candidates on\r\nthe ground that the nation ought to have unified leadership in the coming\r\nmoment of crisis, and that a Republican Congress would divide the\r\nleadership. There was nothing novel in such an appeal; in 1898, McKinley\r\nhad begged for a Republican Congress on the ground that \"this is no time\r\nfor divided councils,\" the same ground as that taken by Wilson in 1918.\r\nRoosevelt in the same year (1898) had said: \"Remember that whether you\r\nwill or not your votes this year will be viewed by the nations of Europe\r\nfrom one standpoint only.... A refusal to sustain the President this year\r\nwill, in their eyes, be read as a refusal to sustain the war and to\r\nsustain the efforts of the peace commission.\" Wilson's appeal in 1918 was\r\nmerely an echo of Roosevelt's in 1898. Yet it was a mistake in tactics.\r\nIt enabled the Republicans to assert that, whereas they had sunk partisan\r\ndifferences during the war in order to secure the victory of the nation,\r\nWilson was now capitalizing the war and foreign problems to win a\r\npartisan advantage. The result of the elections was Republican success,\r\nassuring to that party a slight majority in the Senate and a goodly\r\nmajority in the House after March 4, 1919.\r\n\r\nThe President made other tactical mistakes. Instead of taking the Senate\r\ninto his confidence by entering upon numerous conferences with its\r\nleaders, he stood upon the letter of the Constitution and gave the clear\r\nimpression that he would conduct the peace negotiations himself without\r\nSenatorial assistance, leaving the Senators merely their constitutional\r\nprivilege of \"advice and consent\" when a treaty should be laid before\r\nthem. He would have done better to remember a remarkable passage in one of\r\nhis own lectures, delivered ten years before. Speaking of the difficulty\r\nof bringing pressure to bear upon the Senate, he had said that there is a\r\n\"course which the President may follow, and which one or two Presidents\r\nof unusual political sagacity have followed, with the satisfactory\r\nresults that were to have been expected. He may himself be less stiff and\r\noffish, may himself act in the true spirit of the Constitution and\r\nestablish intimate relations of confidence with the Senate on his own\r\ninitiative, not carrying his plans to completion and then laying them in\r\nfinal form before the Senate to be accepted or rejected, but keeping\r\nhimself in confidential communication with the leaders of the Senate while\r\nhis plans are in course, when their advice will be of service to him and\r\nhis information of the greatest service to them, in order that there may\r\nbe veritable counsel and a real accommodation of views, instead of a final\r\nchallenge and contest.\" Had Wilson in 1918, and after, followed his own\r\nadvice, the outcome might have been different. But nothing describes so\r\nperfectly the exact opposite of his attitude as the passage quoted above.\r\n\r\nThe President might at least have assuaged the sense of injury that\r\nrankled in the hearts of the Senators by asking for their advice in the\r\nappointment of the Peace Commission. Instead he kept his own counsel. He\r\ndecided to go to Paris himself as head of the Commission, and chose for\r\nhis associates men who were not qualified to win for him the support\r\nthat he needed in the Senate or in the country. Robert Lansing, as\r\nSecretary of State, was a necessary appointment. Colonel House was\r\nprobably the best-fitted man in America for the approaching negotiations,\r\nalike by his temperament, by the breadth of his knowledge of foreign\r\nquestions, and by his intimacy with foreign statesmen. But at least two\r\nplaces on the Commission should have been given to eminent Republicans\r\nand to men universally known and respected. If Wilson was unwilling to\r\nselect members of the Senate, he might have heeded public opinion which\r\ncalled definitely for William Howard Taft and Elihu Root. Both were\r\npledged to the most important item of Wilson's programme, the League of\r\nNations; both exercised wide influence in the country and in the\r\nRepublican party. The Senate, with a Republican majority, would almost\r\ncertainly ratify any treaty which they had signed. But the President, for\r\nreasons of a purely negative character, passed them over and with what\r\nlooked to the public like mere carelessness, chose General Tasker Howard\r\nBliss and Henry White, formerly Ambassador to Rome and Paris under\r\nPresidents Roosevelt and Taft. Both were men of ability and experience,\r\nbut neither enjoyed the particular confidence of the American people;\r\nand what Americans chiefly wanted was the assurance of persons they knew\r\nand trusted, that the peace was right. In the existing state of public\r\nopinion, the assurance of the President was not in itself sufficient.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson's decision to go to Paris as a member of the Commission\r\naroused still fiercer opposition, but had reasons infinitely more cogent.\r\nHe knew that there would be great difficulty in translating his ideals\r\ninto fact at the Peace Conference. He believed that he could count upon\r\nthe support of liberal opinion in Europe, but realized that the leading\r\npoliticians had not yet been won sincerely to his policy. The pledge they\r\nhad given to accept the Fourteen Points might mean much or little;\r\neverything depended upon interpretation. A peace of justice and a League\r\nof Nations still hung in the balance. At this moment, with Germany clearly\r\nhelpless, opinion abroad appeared to be tending, naturally enough, toward\r\nthe old-style division of the spoils among the victors. More than one\r\ninfluential French and British newspaper began to sound the cry _Væ\r\nvictis_. Moreover, in America broke forth a chorus of encouragement to the\r\nAllies to pay no attention to Wilsonian idealism. On the 27th of\r\nNovember, shortly before the Commission sailed, Roosevelt wrote: \"Our\r\nAllies and our enemies and Mr. Wilson himself should all understand that\r\nMr. Wilson has no authority whatever to speak for the American people at\r\nthis time. His leadership has just been emphatically repudiated by\r\nthem.... Mr. Wilson and his Fourteen Points and his four supplementary\r\npoints and his five complementary points and all his utterances every\r\nwhich way have ceased to have any shadow of right to be accepted as\r\nexpressive of the will of the American people.... Let them [the Allies]\r\nimpose their common will on the nations responsible for the hideous\r\ndisaster which has almost wrecked mankind.\" It was frank encouragement to\r\nthe Allies, coming from the American who, with Wilson, was best-known\r\nabroad, to divide the spoils and to disregard all promises to introduce a\r\nnew international order, and it must have brought joy to Clemenceau and\r\nSonnino.\r\n\r\nWilson feared that having won the war the United States might lose the\r\npeace: not by softness towards Germany--as yet there was no danger of\r\nthat--but by forgetting the ideals for which it had entered the war, by\r\nforgetting that a peace of injustice sows the seeds of the next war, and\r\nby a relapse into the old bankrupt system of the Balance of Power. He\r\nrealized that the peoples of France, England, and Italy had felt the\r\npinch of war as the American people had never done, and that it was\r\ndemanding too much of human nature to expect that their attitude would be\r\none of moderation. He knew that in the negotiations Clemenceau and\r\nSonnino would be definitely opposed to his programme and that he could\r\nnot count upon Lloyd George. He decided therefore that he must himself go\r\nto Paris to fight for his ideals. The decision was one of tremendous\r\nsignificance. At the moment when domestic problems of reconstruction\r\nwould be most acute, an American President was going to leave the country\r\nbecause of the interest of America in European affairs. The United States\r\nwas now so much a part of the world system that domestic issues seemed of\r\nless importance than the danger that Europe might fall back into the old\r\ninternational system which had proved unable to keep the peace. The\r\nPresident's voyage to France was the clearest manifestation yet\r\nvouchsafed of the settled position of the United States as a world power.\r\n\r\nIf the justice of his policy and the necessity of full participation in\r\nthe peace as in the war be admitted, Wilson was probably right in going\r\nto Paris. No one else could have secured so much of his programme. No\r\none else was possessed of the political power or the personal prestige\r\nwhich belonged to him. The history of the Conference was to show that\r\nwhen he absented himself in February and after he left Paris in June, his\r\nsubordinates found great difficulty in meeting Allied opposition. But the\r\ndecision of the President to attend the Peace Conference furnished fresh\r\nmaterial for criticism at home. It was a new thing in our history; people\r\ndid not understand the importance of the issues involved and attributed\r\nhis voyage to vanity. Unquestionably it weakened Wilson in America as\r\nmuch as it strengthened him abroad. When on the 4th of December, the\r\npresidential ship, _George Washington_, sailed out of New York harbor,\r\nsaluted by the wild shrieks of a thousand sirens and the showers of\r\nglittering white papers streaming from the windows of the skyscrapers,\r\npreceded by the battleship _Pennsylvania_, flanked by destroyers, with\r\nacrobatic airplanes and a stately dirigible overhead, external enthusiasm\r\nwas apparently at its height. But Wilson left behind him glowing embers\r\nof intense opposition which, during the next six months, were to be\r\nfanned into a dangerous flame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nWAYS OF THE PEACE CONFERENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Friday, December 13, 1918, the _George Washington_ steamed slowly into\r\nBrest harbor through a long double line of gray battleships and\r\ndestroyers, greeted by the thunder of presidential salutes and the blare\r\nof marine bands. Europe thrilled with emotion, which was half curiosity\r\nand half genuine enthusiasm: it was to see and applaud the man who during\r\nthe past eighteen months had crystallized in speech the undefined thought\r\nof the Allied world, who represented (at least in European eyes) the\r\nstrength and idealism of America, and who stood, for the moment, as the\r\npolitical Messiah to liberals in every country of the Old World, victors\r\nor defeated. The intensity of the curiosity as well as the sincerity of\r\nthe enthusiasm was attested on the following day, when President Wilson\r\ndrove through the streets of Paris, welcomed by the vociferous plaudits\r\nof the close-packed crowd. It was for him a public triumph, no greater\r\nthan that accorded to King Albert of Belgium and certainly less\r\ndemonstrative than the jubilations of armistice night, but nevertheless\r\nundeniably sweet to the President, who looked to popular opinion as the\r\nbulwark upon which he must rely during the difficult days ahead.\r\n\r\nFurther triumphs awaited him in his trips to England and to Italy. In\r\nLondon and Rome, as in Paris, he was the object of demonstrations which\r\nat times became almost delirious; more than once his admirers must have\r\nbeen reminded of the Biblical phrase that alludes to the honor of a\r\nprophet outside his own country. The emotion of Europe is not difficult\r\nto understand. The man in the street was ready to shout, for the war was\r\nfinished and the miseries of the peace that was no peace were not yet\r\nrealized, Wilson stood for Justice above everything, and the people of\r\neach country believed whole-heartedly that their particular demands were\r\njust; the President, therefore, must stand with them. To Frenchmen it was\r\nobvious that he must approve the \"simple justice\" of the claim that\r\nGermany pay the entire cost of the war; Italians were convinced that he\r\nwould sanction their \"just\" demand for the annexation of Fiume. So long\r\nas Justice remained something abstract his popularity remained secure.\r\nCould he retain it when concrete issues arose? As early as the beginning\r\nof January ebullitions of approval became less frequent. Discordant\r\nvoices were audible suggesting that Wilson was too prone to sacrifice the\r\nmaterial necessities of the war-burdened nations to his idealistic\r\nnotions. People asked why he failed to visit Belgium and the devastated\r\nregions of France, so as to see for himself what sufferings had been\r\nendured. And the historian may well inquire if it were because he had not\r\ngauged the depth of feeling aroused by German war practices, or because\r\nhe had determined to show the Germans that he would not let his judgment\r\nbe clouded by emotion. Whatever the explanation, his popularity suffered.\r\n\r\nWithout question the original strength of President Wilson's position,\r\nresting in part upon the warmth of popular feeling, which is ever\r\nuncertain, was undermined by the delays that marked the opening of the\r\nPeace Conference. Such delays may have resulted in part from the purpose\r\nof the Allied leaders, who wished to permit public enthusiasm for Wilson\r\nto cool; they may also have been caused in part by the differences that\r\ndeveloped over the incorporation of the League of Nations in the Treaty.\r\nBut a prime cause of delay is to be found in the fact that a Peace\r\nConference of this character was a new experience and the statesmen\r\nassembled were not quite sure how to conduct it. Too little thought had\r\nbeen given to the problem of organization, and the plans which had been\r\ndrawn up by the French and Americans were apparently forgotten. The host\r\nof diplomatic attachés and technical advisers, who crowded the Quai\r\nd'Orsay and the hotels of Paris, had only a vague notion as to their\r\nduties and waited uneasily, wondering why their chiefs did not set them\r\nto work. In truth the making of peace was to be characterized by a\r\nlooseness of organization, a failure to coördinate, and a waste of time\r\nand energy resulting from slipshod methods. In the deliberations of the\r\nConference there was a curious mixture of efficiency and ineffectiveness;\r\na wealth of information upon the topics under discussion and an inability\r\nto concentrate that information. Important decisions were made and\r\nforgotten in the welter of conferential disorganization.\r\n\r\nNo one could complain that delays were caused by the kind of gay frivolity\r\nthat characterized the Vienna Congress a hundred years ago. The\r\natmosphere of the Paris Conference was more like that of a convention of\r\ntraveling salesmen. The Hotel Crillon, home of the American Commission,\r\nwas gray and gaunt as the State, War, and Navy Building in Washington.\r\nBanquets were rare; state balls unheard of. The President who had separate\r\nheadquarters, first in the Parc Monceau and later on the Place des États\r\nUnis, avoided the orthodox diversions of diplomacy and labored with an\r\nintensity that was destined to result in physical collapse. The very dress\r\nof the delegates mirrored their businesslike attitude: high silk hats were\r\nseldom seen; Lloyd George appeared in the plainest of bowlers and Colonel\r\nHouse in his simple, black felt. Experts worked far into the early morning\r\nhours in order that principals might have statistics; principals labored\r\neven on Easter Day, and were roused from their beds at four in the morning\r\nto answer telegrams. Unique departure in the history of diplomacy: this\r\nwas a working Peace Conference!\r\n\r\nEach of the different commissions had brought to Paris a staff of attachés\r\nand experts, upon whom the principal delegates were to rely in questions\r\nof fact, and who were themselves to decide points of detail in drafting\r\nthe economic and political clauses of the treaties and in determining new\r\nboundaries. The expert staff of the American Commission had been carefully\r\nselected and was generally regarded as equal to that of any other power.\r\nCompared with the foreign experts, its members lacked experience in\r\ndiplomatic methods, no doubt, but they were as well or better equipped\r\nwith exact information. There is an instance of an American expert on a\r\nminor commission asking that a decision be altered in view of new facts\r\njust brought to light, and offering to place those facts in detail before\r\nthe commission. \"I suggest,\" said a foreign delegate, \"that we accept the\r\namendment without investigation. Hitherto the facts presented by the\r\nAmericans have been irrefutable; it would be waste of time to investigate\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nSuch men as Hoover, Hurley, and Gompers were at hand to give their expert\r\nopinions on questions which they had mastered during the course of the\r\nwar. Norman Davis and Thomas Lamont acted as financial advisers. Baruch\r\nand McCormick brought the wealth of experience which resulted from their\r\nadministration of the War Industries and War Trade Boards. The foresight\r\nof Colonel House, furthermore, had gathered together a group of men who,\r\norganized since the summer of 1917 in what had been called \"The\r\nInquiry,\" had been studying the conditions that would determine new\r\npolitical boundaries on the basis of justice and practicability. The\r\nprincipal delegates could not be expected to know the details that would\r\ndecide the disposition of Danzig, the fate of Fiume, the division of the\r\nBanat of Temesvar. They would need some one to tell them the amount of\r\ncoal produced in the Saar Basin, the location of mines in Teschen, the\r\nethnic character of eastern Galicia, the difference between Slovaks and\r\nRuthenians. It was all very well to come to the Conference with demands\r\nfor justice, but our commissioners must have cold facts to support those\r\ndemands. The fact that exact information was available, and played a rôle\r\nin the decisions of the Conference, marks a step forward in the history\r\nof diplomatic relations.\r\n\r\nContrary to general expectation and rumor, Wilson, although he\r\ndisregarded the American Commissioners, except Colonel House, made\r\nconstant use of the various experts. On the _George Washington_ he had\r\ntold a group of them that he would rely absolutely upon the results of\r\ntheir investigations. \"Tell me what's right,\" he had said, \"and I'll\r\nfight for it. Give me a guaranteed position.\" During the negotiations he\r\ncalled in the experts for daily consultations; they sat behind him at the\r\nsessions of the Council of Ten and on the sofa beside him in the Council\r\nof Four. Their advice was not always followed to the letter; in the\r\nShantung issue it was reluctantly discarded; but in such important\r\nmatters as the Fiume problem, Wilson rested his case wholly upon the\r\nknowledge and opinions of the experts.\r\n\r\nIn defiance of the example of the Congress of Vienna, which never\r\nformally gathered in plenary session, the Paris Conference met with all\r\ndelegates for the first time, on January 18, 1919. It was a picturesque\r\nscene, cast in the long Clock Room of the Quai d'Orsay, the conventional\r\nblack of the majority of delegates broken by the horizon-blue uniform of\r\nMarshal Foch, the natty red-trimmed khaki of British staff officers, and\r\nthe white flowing robes and golden headdress of the Arabian Emir Faisal;\r\ndown the center of the room ran the traditionally diplomatic green baize\r\ntables behind which sat the delegates; attachés and press correspondents\r\ncrowded into the corners or peered around the curtains of adjoining\r\nrooms; at the end, in front of the white marble fireplace, sat the\r\ndominating personalities of the Allied world. But such plenary sessions\r\nwere not to witness the actual work of the Conference, nor was Wilson's\r\ndemand for \"open covenants openly arrived at\" to be translated literally\r\ninto accomplishment. To conduct the Peace Conference by sessions open to\r\nthe public was obviously not feasible. There were too many delegates.\r\nTime, which was precious beyond evaluation, would be lost in the making\r\nof speeches for home consumption. More time would be lost in translation\r\nof the Babel of languages. Frankness and directness of negotiation would\r\nbe impossible, for if the papers should print what the delegates said\r\nabout each other there would be a national crisis every day. Finally, a\r\ncongress is by nature ill-adapted for the study of intricate\r\ninternational problems, as was later to be illustrated in the history of\r\nthe United States Senate.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the larger European Powers had assumed that the\r\ndirection of the Conference would be taken by a small executive committee,\r\ncorresponding to the Supreme War Council, and to this President Wilson\r\nagreed. Such a committee would necessarily meet in secret, in order that\r\nit might not be hampered by formalities and that there might be frank\r\nspeech. Only a brief communiqué, stating the subject of discussion and\r\nthe decision reached, would be issued to the press. The committee would\r\nprovide for the executive measures that must be taken to oppose the growth\r\nof economic and political anarchy in central and southeastern Europe,\r\nwould distribute the problems that were to be studied by special\r\ncommissions, and would formulate or approve the solutions to those\r\nproblems. It would supervise the drafting of the treaties and present them\r\nto the plenary conference in practically final form. Since the bulk of the\r\nfighting had been carried by the major powers and since they would\r\nguarantee the peace, this supreme council of the Conference was composed\r\nof two representatives of the major five, France, Great Britain, the\r\nUnited States, Italy, and Japan, the last-named now entering the sacred\r\ncoterie of \"Great Powers.\" Among the delegates of the smaller powers there\r\nwas lively dissatisfaction at the exclusion from the inner council of such\r\nstates as Belgium and Serbia, which had been invaded by the enemy and had\r\nmade heavy sacrifices in the war: they complained also that the number of\r\ndelegates allotted them was insufficient. Already, it was whispered, the\r\nphrases that dealt with the \"rights of small nations\" were being\r\nforgotten, and this peace congress was to be but a repetition of those\r\nprevious diplomatic assemblies where the spoils went to the strong. But\r\nWilson, who was regarded as the defender of the rights of the small\r\nstates, agreed with Clemenceau that practical necessity demanded an\r\nexecutive council of restricted numbers, and felt that such a body could\r\nbe trusted to see that effective justice was secured. In truth the\r\nPresident was almost as much impressed by the extreme nationalistic ardor\r\nof the small powers, as a source of future danger, as he was by the\r\nselfishness of the large.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Council, during the early days of the Conference, was\r\ngenerally known as the Council of Ten. It met in the study of Stephane\r\nPichon, the French Foreign Minister, which opened on to the garden of the\r\nFrench Foreign Office, and which, with its panelled walls, covered with\r\ngorgeous Gobelins picturing Ruben's story of Marie de' Medici, its\r\nstately brocaded chairs, and old-rose and gray Aubusson carpets, was\r\nredolent of old-time diplomacy. In the center, behind a massive desk, sat\r\nthe president of the Conference, Georges Clemenceau--short, squat,\r\nround-shouldered, with heavy white eyebrows and mustache serving\r\nperfectly to conceal the expression both of eyes and of mouth. Ordinarily\r\nhe rested immobile, his hands folded in the eternal gray gloves, on his\r\nface an expression of bored tolerance, the expression of a man who, after\r\nhalf a century in the political arena of France, had little to learn\r\neither of men or of affairs, even from a Peace Conference. Skeptical in\r\nattitude, a cold listener, obviously impermeable to mere verbiage and\r\naffected by the logic of facts alone, he had a ruthless finger ready to\r\npoke into the interstices of a loosely-woven argument. Clemenceau spoke\r\nbut rarely, in low even tones, with a paucity and awkwardness of gesture\r\nsurprising in a Latin; he was chary of eloquence, disdaining the obvious\r\narts of the rhetor, but he had at his command an endless string of biting\r\nepigrams, and his satire wounded with a touch so sharp that it was\r\nscarcely felt or seen except by the unfortunate recipient. Upon\r\ninfrequent occasion, in the course of hot debate, some one would pierce\r\nhis armor and touch him upon the unguarded quick; then the man was\r\ntransformed, the eyebrows would shoot up, the eyes flash, the mustache\r\nbristle, the voice vibrate, and the invective which he poured forth\r\nscalded like molten lead. One understood at such a moment why he was\r\ncalled \"the Tiger.\" But such outbursts were rare. More characteristic of\r\nhis method of debate was the low-voiced ironical phrase, when his arid\r\nhumor crackled like a wireless message.\r\n\r\nClemenceau dwarfed the other French delegates, with a single exception,\r\nnot alone by the magic of his personality but by the grip which he had on\r\nthe imagination of France. The people remembered that long career,\r\nbeginning with the early days of the Republic and culminating with the\r\nmiracle of the political salvation he brought to France in the dark days\r\nof 1917, when the morale of the nation was near the breaking-point, and\r\nwhich made possible the military victory of Foch. France was grateful. He\r\nhad no political party in the Chamber upon which to rely, but the nation\r\nwas behind him, at least for the moment. \"If I should die now,\" he is\r\nreported to have said during the early days of the Conference, \"France\r\nwould give me a great funeral. If I live six months, no one knows what\r\nmay happen.\" For Clemenceau was a realist; he did not permit himself the\r\nluxury of being deceived even by the good qualities of his own\r\ncountrymen. If he feared anything it was the domination of politics by\r\nthe impractical. Mankind must be taken as it is and not as we should like\r\nit to be. He was troubled by what he called the \"noble simplicity\" of\r\nWilson. Statesmen must be inspired by the sacred egotism which provides\r\nfor the material safety and progress of their own nation. Above all, in\r\nhis mind, France was particularly vulnerable and thus must insist upon\r\nparticular means of defense against the secular enemy across the Rhine.\r\n\r\nBehind Clemenceau, in the Council, hovered his friend and Foreign\r\nSecretary, Stephane Pichon. More in evidence, however, was André Tardieu,\r\nwho alone of the French delegates remained undwarfed by the Prime\r\nMinister. Journalist, politician, captain of Blue Devils, Franco-American\r\nCommissioner, now the youngest of the French peace commission, Tardieu,\r\nmore than any one else supplied the motive energy that carried the treaty\r\nto completion. Debonair and genial, excessively practical, he was the\r\n\"troubleman\" of the Conference: when difficulties arose over the Saar, or\r\nFiume, or reparations, Tardieu was called in to work with a special\r\ncommittee and find a compromise. Not a regular member of the Council of\r\nTen, he was nevertheless at Clemenceau's elbow, and especially after the\r\nattempt on the latter's life, he labored day and night on the details\r\nwhich were too much for the strength and time of the older man.\r\n\r\nOn Clemenceau's right, and half facing him, sat the two American\r\ndelegates, Wilson and Lansing. The President, to the surprise of many, was\r\nby no means the awkward college professor lost among practical\r\npoliticians. His speech was slow and his manner might almost be called\r\nponderous, but the advisers who whispered over his shoulder, during the\r\ncourse of the debate, attested the rapidity with which his mind operates\r\nand his skill in catching the points suggested. There was far less of the\r\ndogmatic doctrinaire in his attitude than had been looked for.\r\nOccasionally his remarks bordered upon the sententious, but he never\r\n\"orated,\" invariably using a conversational tone; many of his points were\r\ndriven home by humorous allusions or anecdotes rather than by didactic\r\nlogic. Like that of the other delegates his manner was informal. During\r\nthe cold days of late January he walked about the room during discussions\r\nin order to keep his feet warm. Indeed the proceedings of the Council of\r\nTen were characterized by a noted absence of stiffness. It was evidently\r\nexpected that the prestige which Wilson possessed among the masses would\r\nevaporate in this inner council; but nothing of the kind was apparent. It\r\nwas not uninteresting to note that when a point was raised every one\r\nlooked involuntarily to see how it would be taken by the President; and\r\nwhen the delegates of the smaller Powers appeared before the Council they\r\naddressed their remarks almost directly at him. Lansing spoke seldom, but\r\nthen with force and conviction, and was evidently more troubled than\r\nWilson by the compromises with expediency which the Americans were\r\ncompelled to make. His attention was never distracted by the sketches\r\nwhich he drew without ceasing, during the course of the debates--grotesque\r\nand humorous figures, much in demand by every one present as mementos of\r\nthe Conference.\r\n\r\nNext on the right sat David Lloyd George, with thick gray hair and\r\nsnapping Celtic eyes. Alert and magnetic, he was on the edge of his\r\nchair, questioning and interrupting. Frankly ignorant of the details of\r\ncontinental geography and politics, naïve in his inquiries, he possessed\r\nthe capacity for acquiring effective information at lightning speed.\r\nUnfortunately he was not over-critical and the source of his information\r\nwas not invariably the highest authority; he was prone to accept the\r\nviews of journalists rather than those of his own Foreign Office.\r\nEffervescent as a bottle just rid of its cork, he was also unstable,\r\ntwisting and veering in his suggestions; not so much blown about by the\r\nwinds of hostile criticism, to which he paid but little attention, as\r\ncarried on by the shifting tides of political events at home. For his eye\r\nwas always across the Channel, calculating the domestic effect of each\r\ntreaty provision. Few could resist his personal magnetism in conversation\r\nand no one would deny him the title of master-politician of his age.\r\nDuring the first weeks of the Conference, Wilson seems to have fallen\r\nunder the spell of Lloyd George to some extent, who showed himself quite\r\nas liberal as the President in many instances. But Wilson was clearly\r\ntroubled by the Welshman's mercurial policy, and before he finally left\r\nfor America, found relief in the solid consistency of Clemenceau. He\r\nalways knew where the French Premier stood, no matter how much he might\r\ndiffer from him in point of view.\r\n\r\nBeside Lloyd George, a perfect foil, sat Arthur J. Balfour, assuming the\r\nattitude habitual to him after long years in the House of Commons--head on\r\nthe back of his chair, body reclining at a comfortable angle, long legs\r\nstretched in front, hands grasping the lapels of his coat, eyes at\r\nfrequent intervals closed. Rising, he overtopped every one present, white\r\nand bent though he was, in physical stature as he did also in pure\r\nintellectual power. Graceful in tone and expression his outlook was the\r\nphilosophical, possibly over-tolerant for the exigencies of the situation,\r\nalthough upon occasion his judgment proved a valuable counterweight to the\r\nhasty enthusiasm of Lloyd George. But Balfour, like Lansing, was sometimes\r\ntreated with scant consideration by his chief and by no means exercised\r\nthe influence which his experience and capacity would lead one to expect.\r\n\r\nOn the right of the British delegates sat the two Japanese, silent,\r\nobservant, their features immobile as the Sphinx. It was a bold man who\r\nwould attempt to guess the thoughts masked by their impassive faces. They\r\nwaited for the strategic moment when they were to present their special\r\nclaims; until then they attended all meetings, scarcely speaking a word,\r\nunwilling to commit themselves. Upon one occasion, in a minor commission,\r\nthe Japanese delegate held the deciding vote, the other four delegations\r\nbeing tied; when asked by the chairman how he voted, whether with the\r\nFrench and Americans or with the British and Italians, the Japanese\r\nresponded simply, \"Yes.\" Next the Japanese, but facing Clemenceau and\r\nabout twelve feet from him, were the Italians: Sonnino with his\r\nclose-cropped white bullet head and heavy drooping mustache, his great\r\nRoman nose coming down to meet an equally strong out-jutting chin, his jaw\r\nset like a steel latch. The hawklike appearance of the man was softened in\r\ndebate by the urbanity of his manner and the modulations of his voice.\r\nOrlando was less distinctive in appearance and character. Eloquent and\r\nwarm-hearted, he was troubled by the consciousness that failure to secure\r\nthe full extent of Italian claims spelled the downfall of his ministry in\r\nRome. It is of some historical importance that Sonnino, who spoke perfect\r\nEnglish with just a trace of Etonian inflection, was the more obstinate in\r\nhis demands; Orlando, who showed himself inclined to compromise, spoke no\r\nEnglish and therefore could come into intellectual contact with Wilson and\r\nLloyd George only through the medium of an interpreter.\r\n\r\nProceedings were necessarily in both French and English, because none of\r\nthe big men except Clemenceau and Sonnino used the two languages with\r\ncomfort. The interpreter, Mantoux, who sat behind Clemenceau, was no mere\r\ntranslator. A few notes scribbled on a pad were sufficient for him to\r\nrender the sense of a speech with keen accuracy and frequently with a\r\nfire and a pungency that surpassed the original. He spoke always in the\r\nfirst person as though the points made in debate were his own, and the\r\ncarrying of each particular point the ideal nearest his heart. Behind the\r\nprincipals, the \"Olympians,\" as they came to be called, were the experts\r\nand attachés, with long rolls of maps and complex tables of statistics,\r\nready to answer questions of detailed facts. In truth there was more\r\nreference to sources of exact information by the chief delegates than\r\nwould have been expected by the student of former diplomatic practices.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the room, facing the Olympians, stood or sat the\r\nparticular claimant or expert witness of the séance. Now it might be\r\nMarshal Foch, with wrinkled, weary, war-worn visage, and thin rumpled\r\nhair, in shabby uniform, telling of Germany's failure to fulfill the\r\narmistice conditions; one would meet him later in the corridor\r\noutside--like Grant, he was apt to have the stump of a black cigar in the\r\ncorner of his mouth--usually shaking his head ominously over the failure\r\nof the politicians to treat Germany with the requisite severity. Or the\r\nclaimant before the Ten might be the grave, self-contained Venizelos,\r\nonce outlaw and revolutionary, now, after many turns of fortune's wheel,\r\nmaster of Greece and perhaps the greatest statesman of them all. Then\r\nagain would appear the boyish Foreign Minister of the Czecho-Slovak\r\nRepublic, Edward Benes, winning friends on all sides by his frank\r\nsincerity and ready smile; or, perfect contrast, the blackbearded\r\nBratiano of Rumania, claiming the enforcement of the secret treaty that\r\nwas to double the area of his state. Later, Paderewski came from Warsaw,\r\nhis art sacrificed on the altar of patriotism, leonine in appearance, but\r\nsurprisingly untemperamental in diplomatic negotiation.\r\n\r\nTo each of these and to many others who presented problems for immediate\r\nsettlement the Council listened, for it had not merely to draw up\r\ntreaties and provide for the future peace of the world, but also to meet\r\ncrises of the moment. The starving populations of central and\r\nsoutheastern Europe must be fed; tiny wars that had sprung up between\r\nsmaller nationalities must be attended to and armistice commissions\r\ndispatched; the rehabilitation of railroads and river transportation\r\ndemanded attention; coal mines must be operated and labor difficulties\r\nadjusted. This economic renaissance had to be accomplished in face of\r\nnationalistic quarrels and the social unrest that threatened to spread\r\nthe poison of communistic revolution as far west as the Rhine and the\r\nAdriatic.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning it was clear that the actual drafting of the treaty\r\nclauses would have to be undertaken by special commissions. The work\r\ncould never be completed except by a subdivision of labor and the\r\nassignment of particular problems to especially competent groups. As the\r\nCouncil of Ten faced the situation, they decided that the number of the\r\ncommissions must be increased. By the beginning of February the work was\r\nlargely subdivided. There was a commission headed by President Wilson\r\nworking on the League of Nations, while others studied such problems as\r\nresponsibility for the war, reparations, international labor legislation,\r\ninternational control of ports, waterways, and railways, financial and\r\neconomic problems, military, naval, and aerial questions. When the\r\nCouncil of Ten found themselves puzzled by the conflicting territorial\r\nclaims of different Allied nations, they decided to create also special\r\nterritorial commissions to study boundaries and to report their\r\nrecommendations back to the Supreme Council. It was President Wilson,\r\nchafing at the early delays of the Conference, who eagerly adopted a\r\nsuggestion of Colonel House to the effect that time might be saved if\r\nthe experts of the different states attacked boundary problems and thus\r\nrelieved the strain upon the time and nerves of the Olympians, who could\r\nnot be expected to know or understand the details of each question. The\r\nsuggestion was approved by the chiefs of the Allied governments. There\r\nwere five such territorial commissions, which were in turn subdivided,\r\nwhile a single central territorial commission was appointed to coördinate\r\nthe reports.\r\n\r\nThe more important commissions, such as that upon the League of Nations,\r\nwere composed of plenipotentiaries and included generally representatives\r\nfrom the smaller states. The reparations, financial, and labor\r\ncommissions were made up of business men and financiers, the American\r\nrepresentatives including such figures as Lamont, Norman Davis, Baruch,\r\nand McCormick. The territorial commissions were composed of the\r\nrepresentatives of the four principal Powers; most of the European\r\ndelegates, who were in some cases also plenipotentiaries, were chosen\r\nfrom the staffs of the Foreign Offices, and included such men as Sir Eyre\r\nCrowe, Jules Cambon, Tardieu, and Salvago Raggi. The American delegates\r\nwere generally members of the Inquiry, men who had been working on these\r\nvery problems for more than a year. The special commissions worked with\r\ncare and assiduity, and their decisions rested generally on facts\r\nestablished after long discussion. To this extent, at least, the Paris\r\nConference was characterized by a new spirit in diplomacy.\r\n\r\nUpon the reports of these commissions were based the draft articles of\r\nthe treaties, which were then referred back to the Supreme Council. By\r\nthe time the reports were finished, that body had divided into two\r\nsmaller bodies: the Council of Foreign Ministers, and the Council of\r\nPremiers, composed of Clemenceau, Lloyd George, Wilson, and Orlando. The\r\nlatter body, which came to be known as the Council of Four, or,\r\ncolloquially, the \"Big Four,\" naturally assumed complete direction. It\r\nwas unfortunate certainly that a congress which had started with the cry\r\nof \"open covenants\" should thus find itself practically resolved into a\r\ncommittee of four. Disappointed liberals have assumed that the inner\r\ncouncil was formed with the object of separating President Wilson from\r\ncontact with popular ideas and bringing him to acceptance of the\r\nold-style peace desired by Clemenceau. In reality the Council of Four was\r\nsimply a revival of the informal committee which had sat during the\r\nautumn of 1918, when Colonel House, Lloyd George, and Clemenceau had met\r\nby themselves to formulate the policy to be adopted when Germany\r\npresented her demand for an armistice. When Wilson left Paris in\r\nFebruary, Colonel House, who became chiefly responsible for the American\r\nside of negotiations, found the Council of Ten unwieldy. It was attended\r\nby as many as thirty or forty persons, some of whom seemed inclined to\r\nspread colored accounts of what was going on, and the very size of the\r\nmeeting tended toward the making of speeches and the slowing-down of\r\nprogress. Furthermore, at that time Clemenceau, confined to his house by\r\nthe wound inflicted by a would-be assassin, was unable to attend the\r\nsessions of the Council of Ten. It was natural, therefore, that the three\r\nstatesmen who had worked so effectively the preceding autumn should now\r\nrenew their private conferences. When Wilson returned to Paris in March,\r\nand learned from Colonel House how much more rapidly the small committee\r\nwas able to dispose of vexatious questions, he readily agreed to it. Nor\r\nis there any valid evidence extant to show that his influence was\r\nseriously impaired by the change, although the sessions of the Council of\r\nFour took on a greater appearance of secrecy than had been desired by\r\nColonel House.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Four acted as a board of review and direction rather than\r\nof dictators. When the reports of the expert commissions were unanimous\r\nthey were generally accepted with little or no alteration. When a divided\r\nreport was sent up, the Four were compelled to reach a compromise, since\r\nevery delay threatened to give new opportunity to the forces of social\r\ndisorder in Germany and southeastern Europe. The Council met ordinarily\r\nin the house used by President Wilson, on the Place des États-Unis. Some\r\nof the conferences were held in a small room downstairs without the\r\npresence of secretaries or advisers; frequently, however, the experts\r\nwere called in to meet with the chiefs in the large front room upstairs,\r\nand would often monopolize the discussion, the Four playing the part of\r\nlisteners merely. Formality was dispensed with. During a debate upon the\r\nsouthern boundary of Austria, President Wilson might have been seen on\r\nall fours, kneeling on the floor and tracing out the suggested frontier\r\non a huge map, while other peace commissioners and experts surrounded\r\nhim, also on their hands and knees. Hours of labor were long. There was,\r\ncertainly, much discussion that hinged upon selfish nationalist\r\ninterests, but also much that was inspired by a sincere desire to secure\r\nthe solution that would permanently restore the tranquillity of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe presence of President Wilson did much to maintain the idealism that\r\njostled national self-seeking in the final drafting of the treaties.\r\nThough he lacked the political brilliance of Lloyd George and had not the\r\nsuppressed but irresistible vehemence that characterized Clemenceau, his\r\nvery simplicity of argument availed much. He was not destined to carry\r\nthrough the full programme of idealism as set out in the Fourteen Points,\r\nat least not as interpreted by most liberals. He could not secure the\r\npeace of reconciliation which he had planned, but even with his\r\npopularity in France, Belgium, and Italy lost, and his prestige dimmed,\r\nhe retained such a strong position in the Council of Four that he was\r\nable to block some of the more extreme propositions advanced by\r\nimperialist elements, and, more positively, to secure what he had most at\r\nheart, the League of Nations. Whether he yielded more than he gained is a\r\nquestion which demands more detailed consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nBALANCE OF POWER OR LEAGUE OF NATIONS?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever mistakes President Wilson made at Paris, he did not greatly\r\nunderestimate the difficulties of his task when he set forth from the\r\nUnited States. The liberal utterances of the Allied chiefs during the war\r\nhad never succeeded in winning his sincere confidence; more than once he\r\nhad even intimated that he did not consider their governments completely\r\nrepresentative of public opinion. He anticipated a struggle with\r\nClemenceau and Lloyd George over the amount of indemnity which was to be\r\ndemanded from Germany, as well as over the territory of which she was to\r\nbe deprived. Their formal approval of the Fourteen Points had been a cause\r\nof intense satisfaction to him, but he realized definitely that they would\r\nmake every effort to interpret them in terms of purely national\r\nself-interest. This he regarded as the greatest difficulty to be met at\r\nParis. The second difficulty lay in the extreme demands that were being\r\nmade by the smaller nationalities, now liberated from Teuton dominion or\r\noverlordship. Poland, Rumania, Serbia, Greece, were all asking for\r\nterritory which could only be assigned to them on the ancient principle of\r\nthe division of spoils among the victors. The spirit of nationalism which\r\nhad played a rôle of so much importance in the antecedents of the war, as\r\nwell as in the downfall of the Central Empires, now threatened to ruin the\r\npeace. As we have seen, it was partly because of this second danger that\r\nWilson agreed to the exclusion of the smaller states from the Supreme\r\nCouncil of the Allies.\r\n\r\nUpon the details of the treaties, whether of an economic or a territorial\r\ncharacter, the President did not at first lay great stress. He was\r\ninterested chiefly in the spirit that lay behind the treaties. The peace,\r\nhe insisted, must be one of justice and, if possible, one of\r\nreconciliation. More concretely, the great point of importance was the\r\nestablishment of a League of Nations; for the President believed that\r\nonly through the building up of a new international system, based upon\r\nthe concert of all democratic states, could permanent justice and amity\r\nbe secured. Only a new system could suffice to prevent the injustice\r\nthat great states work upon small, and to stamp out the germs of future\r\nwar. It would be the single specific factor that would make this treaty\r\ndifferent from and better than treaties of the past. The ultimate origin\r\nof the great war was less to be sought in the aspirations and malevolence\r\nof Germany, he believed, than in the disorganized international system of\r\nEurope. Unless that were radically reformed, unless a régime of\r\ndiplomatic coöperation were substituted for the Balance of Power, neither\r\njustice nor peace could last. The old system had failed too often.\r\n\r\nWilson does not seem to have formulated definitely before he reached\r\nParis the kind of League which he desired to see created. He was opposed\r\nto such intricate machinery as that proposed by the League to Enforce\r\nPeace, and favored an extremely simple organization which might evolve\r\nnaturally to meet conditions of the future. The chief organ of a League,\r\nhe felt, should be an executive council, possibly composed of the\r\nambassadors to some small neutral power. If trouble threatened in any\r\nquarter, the council was to interfere at once and propose a settlement.\r\nIf this proved unsuccessful, a commercial boycott might be instituted\r\nagainst the offending state: it was to be outlawed, and, as Wilson said,\r\n\"outlaws are not popular now.\" He regarded it as important that the\r\nGerman colonies should not be divided among the Allies, but should be\r\ngiven to the League, to be administered possibly through some smaller\r\npower; for an institution, he felt, is always stabilized by the\r\npossession of property.\r\n\r\nSuch were, broadly speaking, the ideas which seemed uppermost in the\r\nPresident's mind when he landed in France, and which he was determined\r\nshould form the basis of the peace. He anticipated opposition, and he was\r\nin a measure prepared to fight for his ideals. But he failed adequately\r\nto appreciate the confusion which had fallen upon Europe, after four\r\nyears and more of war, and which made the need of a speedy settlement so\r\nimperative. If he had gauged more accurately the difficulties of his task\r\nhe would have been more insistent upon the drafting of a quick\r\npreliminary peace, embodying merely general articles, and leaving all the\r\ndetails of the settlement to be worked out by experts at their leisure.\r\nHe might thus have utilized his popularity and influence when it was at\r\nits height, and have avoided the loss of prestige which inevitably\r\nfollowed upon the discussion of specific issues, when he was compelled\r\nto take a stand opposed to the national aspirations of the various\r\nstates. Such a general preliminary treaty would have gone far towards\r\nrestoring a basis for the resumption of normal political and economic\r\nactivity; it would have permitted Wilson to return to the United States\r\nas the unquestioned leader of the world; it would have blunted the edge\r\nof senatorial opposition; and finally it might have enabled him to avoid\r\nthe controversies with Allied leaders which compelled him to surrender\r\nmuch of his original programme in a series of compromises.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to Wilson to remember that his original plan, in\r\nNovember, was to secure such a preliminary treaty, which was to embody\r\nmerely the general lines of a territorial settlement and the disarmament\r\nof the enemy. The delays which postponed the treaty were not entirely his\r\nfault. Arriving in France on the 13th of December, he expected that the\r\nConference would convene on the seventeenth, the date originally set. But\r\ndays passed and neither the French nor the British took steps toward the\r\nopening of negotiations. They had not even appointed their delegates.\r\nLloyd George sent messages of welcome from across the Channel, but\r\nexplained that domestic affairs detained him in England. Conscious of the\r\nstruggle that was likely to arise between the \"practical\" aspirations of\r\nEurope and the \"idealism\" of America, the Allied leaders evidently were\r\nin no hurry to give to the exponent of the ideal the advantage of the\r\npopular support that he enjoyed during the early days following his\r\narrival upon European shores. Hence it was not until the second week of\r\nJanuary that the delegations began to assemble at Paris. In the interval\r\nWilson had become involved in various detailed problems and he had lost\r\nthe opportunity, if indeed it ever offered, to demand immediate agreement\r\non preliminary terms of peace.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the delays, the President secured an early triumph in the\r\nmatter which he had closest at heart, namely, a League of Nations and its\r\nincorporation in the Treaty. Clemenceau had taken issue publicly with\r\nWilson. When the President, in the course of his English speeches,\r\naffirmed that this was the first necessity of a world which had seen the\r\nsystem of alliances fail too often, the French Premier replied in the\r\nChamber of Deputies, on the 29th of December, that for his part he held\r\nto the old principle of alliances which had saved France in the past and\r\nmust save her in the future, and that his sense of the practical would\r\nnot be affected by the \"_noble candeur_\" of President Wilson. The polite\r\nsneer that underlay the latter phrase aroused the wrath of the more\r\nradical deputies, but the Chamber gave Clemenceau an overwhelming vote of\r\nconfidence as he thus threw down the gage. In the meantime Lloyd George\r\nhad shown himself apparently indifferent to the League and much more\r\ninterested in what were beginning to be called the \"practical issues.\"\r\n\r\nWith the opening of the Conference, however, it soon became apparent that\r\nWilson had secured the support of the British delegates. It is possible\r\nthat a trade had been tacitly consummated. Certain it is that the\r\n\"freedom of the seas,\" which the British delegates were determined should\r\nnot enter into the issues of the Peace Conference and which had\r\nthreatened to make the chief difficulty between British and Americans,\r\nwas never openly discussed. Had Wilson decided to drop or postpone this\r\nmost indefinite of his Fourteen Points, on the understanding that the\r\nBritish would give their support to the League? At all events, the League\r\nof Nations was given an important place on the programme of\r\ndeliberations, and at the second of the plenary sessions of the\r\nConference, held on January 25, 1919, the principle of a League was\r\napproved without a dissentient voice; it was also decided that the\r\nLeague should be made an integral part of the Treaty. Wilson, in addition\r\nto acquiring British support had won that of the Italians, to whom he had\r\npromised his aid in securing the Brenner frontier in the Tyrol.\r\nClemenceau, according to an American delegate, \"had climbed on the\r\nband-wagon.\"\r\n\r\nThe President's victory was emphasized when he also won the Europeans and\r\nthe representatives of the British overseas Dominions to acceptance of\r\nthe principle of \"mandatories,\" according to which the German colonies\r\nwere not to be distributed as spoils amongst the victors, but to become\r\nthe property of the League and to be administered by the mandatory\r\nstates, not for their own benefit but for that of the colonies. The\r\nvictory was not complete, since Wilson's first intention had been that\r\nthe mandatory states should not be the great powers, but such states as\r\nHolland or one of the Scandinavian nations. He was compelled to admit the\r\nright of the British and French to take over the colonies as mandatories.\r\nEven so, the struggle over the issue was intense, Premier Hughes of\r\nAustralia leading the demand that the German colonies should be given\r\noutright to the Allies and the British self-governing Dominions. Again\r\nthe support of Lloyd George brought success to the American policy.\r\n\r\nIn order to assure his victory in the foundation of a League of Nations,\r\nit was necessary that before returning home Wilson should see some\r\ndefinite scheme elaborated. Until the 14th of February he labored with\r\nthe special committee appointed to draft a specific plan, which included\r\nmuch of the best political talent of the world: Lord Robert Cecil,\r\nGeneral Smuts, Venizelos, Léon Bourgeois. In order to avoid the criticism\r\nthat consideration of a League was delaying the preparation of peace\r\nterms, the commission met in the evenings so as not to interrupt the\r\nregular meetings of the Council of Ten. It was a _tour de force_, this\r\nelaboration of a charter for the new international order, in less than\r\nthree weeks. At times the task seemed hopeless as one deadlock after\r\nanother developed. Wilson, who presided over the commission, lacked the\r\nskill and courage displayed by Clemenceau in his conduct of the plenary\r\nsessions, and proved unable to prevent fruitless discussion; possibly he\r\nfeared lest he be regarded as autocratic in pushing his pet plan. At all\r\nevents precious moments were dissipated in long speeches, and general\r\nprinciples threatened to be lost in a maze of details. With but two days\r\nleft before the plenary session of the Conference and the date set for\r\nWilson's sailing, the commission had approved only six of the\r\ntwenty-seven articles of the Covenant. Fortune intervened. The presence\r\nof Wilson was demanded at the Council of Ten and his place as chairman\r\nwas taken by Lord Robert Cecil. The latter showed himself effective. Ably\r\nseconded by Colonel House, he passed over all details and pushed the\r\nfinal stages of the report through at top speed; on the 14th of February\r\nthe Covenant of the League was completed. It was sanctioned by the\r\nplenary session of the Conference that afternoon, and in the evening\r\nWilson left for America with the document in his pocket. Doubtless it\r\nseemed to him that the major portion of his task had been accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of the League thus proposed is said to have been largely\r\nevolved by Smuts and Cecil, but it coincided roughly with the ideas that\r\nWilson had already conceived. Much of the language of the Covenant is\r\nWilson's; its form was mainly determined by the British and American\r\nlegal experts, C. J. B. Hurst and D. H. Miller. It provided for an\r\nexecutive council representing nine powers, and a deliberative assembly\r\nof all the members of the League. The Council must meet annually and\r\ntake under advisement any matters threatening to disturb international\r\npeace. Its recommendations must be unanimous. The Assembly was entirely\r\nwithout executive power. The members of the League were to agree not to\r\nmake war without first submitting the matter under dispute to arbitration\r\nor to the consideration of the Council. Failure to abide by this\r\nagreement would constitute an act of war against the League, which upon\r\nrecommendation of the Council, might boycott the offending state\r\neconomically or exercise military force against it. The Covenant declared\r\nit \"to be the friendly right of each Member of the League to bring to the\r\nattention of the Assembly or of the Council any circumstance whatever\r\naffecting international relations which threatens to disturb\r\ninternational peace or the good understanding between nations upon which\r\npeace depends.\" The members of the League, furthermore, undertook \"to\r\nrespect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial\r\nintegrity and existing independence of all members of the League. In case\r\nof any such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which\r\nthis obligation shall be fulfilled\" (Article X). These two provisions\r\nembodied the particular contributions of Wilson to the Covenant, who\r\nbelieved that the capacity of the League to preserve justice and peace\r\ndepended chiefly upon them. The Covenant also provided in some measure\r\nfor military and naval disarmament by giving to the Council the right to\r\nrecommend the size of the force to be maintained by each member of the\r\nLeague, and it attacked secret diplomacy by abrogating previous\r\nobligations inconsistent with the Covenant and by providing that every\r\nfuture treaty must be registered and published.\r\n\r\nIf the President expected to be hailed at home as conquering hero, he was\r\ndestined to bitter disappointment. He must now pay the price for those\r\ntactical mistakes which had aroused opinion against him in the previous\r\nautumn. The elements which he had antagonized by his war-policies, by his\r\ndemand for a Democratic Congress, by his failure to coöperate with the\r\nSenate in the formulation of American policy and in the appointment of\r\nthe Peace Commission, and which had opposed his departure in person to\r\nParis--all those elements now had their chance. Having won a difficult\r\nvictory over reactionary forces in Europe, Wilson was now compelled to\r\nbegin the struggle over again at home. And whereas at Paris he had\r\ndisplayed some skill in negotiation and an attitude of conciliation even\r\nwhen firm in his principles, upon his return he adopted a tone which\r\nshowed that he had failed to gauge the temper of the people. He probably\r\nhad behind him the majority of the independent thinkers, even many who\r\ndisliked him personally but who appreciated the importance and the value\r\nof the task he was trying to carry through. The mass of the people,\r\nhowever, understood little of what was going on at Paris. The situation\r\nabroad was complex and it had not been clarified adequately by the press.\r\nOpinion needed to be educated. It wanted to know why a League was\r\nnecessary and whether its elaboration was postponing peace and the return\r\nof the doughboys. Why must the League be incorporated in the Treaty? And\r\ndid the League put the United States at the mercy of European politicians\r\nand would it involve our country in a series of European wars in which we\r\nhad no interest?\r\n\r\nWhat followed must be counted as little less than a tragedy. The man of\r\nacademic antecedents with masterly powers of exposition, who had voiced\r\npopular thought during the years of the war so admirably, now failed\r\ncompletely as an educator of opinion. The President might have shown that\r\nthe League Covenant, instead of postponing peace, was really essential to\r\na settlement, since it was to facilitate solutions of various territorial\r\nproblems which might otherwise hold the Conference in debate for months.\r\nHe could have demonstrated with a dramatic vigor which the facts made\r\npossible, the anarchical condition of Europe and the need for some sort of\r\ninternational system of coöperation if a new cataclysm was to be avoided,\r\nand he might have pictured the inevitable repercussive effect of such a\r\ncataclysm upon America. He might have shown that in order to give effect\r\nto the terms of the Treaty, it was necessary that the League Covenant\r\nshould be included within it. He could have emphasized the fact that the\r\nCovenant took from Congress no constitutional powers, that the Council of\r\nthe League, on which the United States was represented, must be unanimous\r\nbefore taking action, and then could only make recommendations. But the\r\nPresident failed to explain the situation in terms comprehensible to the\r\naverage man. However adequate his addresses seemed to those who understood\r\nthe situation abroad, they left the American public cold. His final speech\r\nin the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City was especially\r\nunfortunate, for his statement that he would bring back the Treaty and the\r\nLeague so intertwined that no one could separate them sounded like a\r\nthreat. At the moment when he needed the most enthusiastic support to curb\r\nthe opposition of the Senate, he alienated thousands and lost the chance\r\nto convince tens of thousands.\r\n\r\nThese developments did not pass unnoticed in Europe. Clemenceau and Lloyd\r\nGeorge had yielded to Wilson during the first weeks of the Conference\r\nbecause they could not afford to separate their fortunes from the United\r\nStates, upon whom they depended for economic support, and because an open\r\nbreak with Wilson would weaken their own position with liberals in France\r\nand England. But now it became apparent to them that Wilson's position at\r\nhome was so unstable that they might be justified in adopting a stronger\r\ntone. Each of them could point to the tangible evidence of victorious\r\nelections and votes of confidence. President Wilson could not. The party\r\nin the Senate which, after the 4th of March, would hold the majority,\r\nexpressly repudiated Wilson's policy. When the President returned to\r\nParis, on the 14th of March, he found a different atmosphere. The League\r\nwas no longer the central topic of discussion. Concrete questions were\r\nuppermost. How much should Germany pay? What territory should be taken\r\nfrom her? How was the Kaiser to be punished? Wilson had been given the\r\nsatisfaction of securing approval for the principle of the League. Now he\r\nmust permit the Conference to satisfy the practical aspirations of\r\nFrance, England, and Italy.\r\n\r\nIt is a tribute to the personality of Wilson that by his presence at this\r\ncritical juncture, when the attitude of the Allies differed but slightly,\r\nif at all, from that of the powers at the Congress of Vienna, he was able\r\nto bring back something of the spirit of justice which had been so\r\nfrequently and loudly declaimed before the armistice, and to repress at\r\nleast in some degree the excessive claims which demanded satisfaction in\r\nthe treaties. The plans which, during his absence, had been evolved for\r\nthe separation of the Covenant from the Treaty and for its postponement,\r\nand which had received the hearty support of several French and British\r\ndiplomats, were quickly dropped. Wilson was able to announce without\r\ncontradiction, that the Covenant would be an integral part of the Treaty,\r\nas decided on the 25th of January. Far more difficult was the situation\r\nthat resulted from French and British plans for indemnities from Germany,\r\nand from the French territorial claims on the Rhine. In each of these\r\nmatters Wilson could secure nothing better than a compromise.\r\n\r\nFrom the day when peace dawned upon Europe, the question that had touched\r\nAllied peoples most closely was, How much will Germany pay? It was not so\r\nmuch the shout of the brutal victor greedy for loot, as the involuntary\r\ncry of nations which had seen their homes and factories pulverized, their\r\nships sunk, the flower of their youth killed and maimed, and which now\r\nfaced years of crushing taxation. They had carried the load of war\r\ngallantly and they would enter the struggle for recuperation courageously.\r\nBut they would not endure that the enemy, which had forced these miseries\r\nupon them, should not make good the material damage that had been done.\r\nWhat was the meaning of the word justice, if the innocent victors were to\r\nemerge from the war with keener sufferings and more gloomy future than the\r\nguilty defeated? Another question stirred the mind of every Frenchman. For\r\ngenerations the eastern frontier of France had lain open to the invasion\r\nof the Teuton hordes. The memory of Prussian brutality in 1814 had been\r\nkept alive in every school; the horrors of 1870 had been told and retold\r\nby participants and eye-witnesses; and the world had seen the German\r\ncrimes of 1914. From all France the cry went up, How long? It would be the\r\nmost criminal stupidity if advantage were not taken of the momentary\r\nhelplessness of the inevitable enemy in order to make that vulnerable\r\nfrontier secure. This was not the end. Some day the struggle would be\r\nrenewed. Already, within two months of the armistice, the French General\r\nStaff were considering mobilization plans for the next war. France must be\r\nmade safe while she had the chance.\r\n\r\nThese feelings had such a hold on the people that the statesmen of Europe\r\nwould have been over-thrown on the day they forgot them. Popular\r\nsentiment was reënforced by practical considerations less justifiable.\r\nCrushing indemnities would not merely ease the load of Allied taxation\r\nand furnish capital for rapid commercial development; they would also\r\nremove Germany as an economic competitor. French control of all territory\r\nwest of the Rhine would not only assure France against the danger of\r\nanother German invasion, but would also provide her capitalists with a\r\npreponderating economic advantage in regions by no means French in\r\ncharacter. Such selfish interests the Americans strove to set aside,\r\nalthough they never forgot their desire to secure as complete justice\r\nfor the Allies as seemed compatible with a stable and tranquil\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of indemnities, or reparations as they came to be called,\r\nthe experts of the various powers soon established the fact that Germany\r\nwould be unable to pay the total bill of reparation, even at the most\r\nconservative reckoning. There was a long discussion as to whether or not\r\nthe costs of war, aside from material damage done, that had been incurred\r\nby the Allies, should be included in the amount that Germany was to pay.\r\nIt was finally determined, in accordance with the arguments of the\r\nAmerican financial delegates who were warmly supported by President\r\nWilson, that such war costs should be excluded. On the other hand it was\r\nagreed that pensions might properly be made part of Germany's reparation\r\nbill. The two items of damages and pensions were calculated by the\r\nAmerican experts as amounting to a total figure of not less than\r\n$30,000,000,000 present capital sum, which Germany ought to pay.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to determine how much Germany could be made to pay. By\r\ndrafting too severe terms German trade might be destroyed completely and\r\nGermany left without the economic capacity to make the money that was to\r\npay the bill. It was obvious to careful students that the total amount\r\nwhich she could turn over to the Allies could not be much more than the\r\nexcess of her exports over imports; and that even if payments were\r\nextended over twenty or thirty years their value for purposes of\r\nreparation would probably not much exceed twenty-five billion dollars.\r\nLloyd George in his election pledges had promised that the complete\r\nreparations account would be settled by the enemy; neither he nor\r\nClemenceau dared to confess that the sum which could be exacted from\r\nGermany would fall far below their early promises. The British experts,\r\nSumner and Cunliffe, continued to encourage Lloyd George in his belief\r\nthat Germany could afford to pay something in the neighborhood of a\r\nhundred billion dollars, and the French Finance Minister, Klotz, was\r\nequally optimistic. At first, accordingly, Allied demands on Germany\r\nseemed likely to be fantastic.\r\n\r\nThe Americans, on the other hand, were infinitely more conservative in\r\ntheir estimates of what Germany could pay. Even after certain Allied\r\nexperts, including Montagu and Loucheur, affirmed the necessity of scaling\r\ndown the suggested sum of reparations, the difference between the\r\nAmerican proposals and those of the Allies was serious.[13] Political\r\nconsiderations, however, interposed, and preventing the settling of a\r\ndefinite total sum which Germany must pay. Neither Lloyd George nor\r\nClemenceau dared to go to their constituents with the truth, namely that\r\nGermany could not possibly pay the enormous indemnities which the\r\npoliticians had led the people to expect. (Lloyd George, for example, had\r\nstated the sum that Germany must pay at about $120,000,000,000.) Both the\r\nchiefs of state asserted that they were almost certain to be turned out of\r\noffice as a result, with consequent confusion in the Peace Conference, and\r\na prolongation of the crisis. The only escape seemed to be in a\r\npostponement of the problem by not naming any definite sum which Germany\r\nmust pay, but requiring her to acknowledge full liability. The\r\ndisadvantages of this method were apparent to the President and his\r\nfinancial advisers, for it was clear that the economic stability of the\r\nworld could not be restored until the world knew how much Germany was\r\ngoing to pay.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: At first the French and British refused to name any\r\nspecific sum that might be collected from Germany, requesting the\r\nAmericans to submit estimates. The latter named $5,000,000,000 as\r\nrepresenting a sum that might be collected prior to May 1, 1921, and\r\nthereafter a capital sum as high as $25,000,000,000, always provided that\r\nthe other clauses in the treaty did not too greatly drain Germany's\r\nresources. After some weeks of discussion the French experts stated that\r\nif the figures could be revised up to $40,000,000,000 they would\r\nrecommend them to their chiefs. The British refused to accept a figure\r\nbelow $47,000,000,000.]\r\n\r\nEqually difficult was the problem of the French frontier. The return of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine to France was unanimously approved. The French claimed in\r\naddition, the districts of the Saar, with their valuable coal-fields, a\r\nportion of which had been left to France after the first abdication of\r\nNapoleon but annexed to Prussia after his defeat at Waterloo; and they\r\ncontended that if the German territories west of the Rhine were not to be\r\nannexed to France, they must at least be separated from Germany, which\r\nhad secured a threatening military position mainly through their\r\npossession. American experts had felt inclined to grant a part of the\r\nSaar region to France as compensation for the wanton destruction of\r\nFrench mines at Lens and Valenciennes by the Germans; but both Wilson and\r\nLloyd George were opposed to absolute annexation of the district which\r\nthe French demanded, including, as it did, more than six hundred thousand\r\nGermans and no French. Wilson was definitely hostile to any attempt to\r\nseparate from the Fatherland such purely German territory as that on the\r\nleft bank of the Rhine. The Allies, as well as himself, had given\r\nassurances that they did not aim at the dismemberment of Germany, and it\r\nwas on the basis of such assurances that the Germans had asked for an\r\narmistice. Wilson admitted that from the point of view of military\r\nstrategy the argument of Foch was unanswerable, under the old conditions;\r\nbut he insisted that the League of Nations would obviate the necessity of\r\nthe strategic protection asked for.\r\n\r\nThe struggle over these issues nearly broke the back of the Conference.\r\nIf Clemenceau had yielded in January when the League was demanded by\r\nWilson, it was with the mental reservation that when the \"practical\"\r\nissues came up, the victory should be his. The French press were not slow\r\nto give support to their Government, and within a short time the\r\nPresident, so recently a popular idol, found himself anathematized as a\r\npro-German and the sole obstacle to a speedy and satisfactory peace. The\r\nmore noisy section of the British press followed suit. Liberals were\r\nsilenced and American idealism was cursed as meddlesome myopia. For some\r\ndays the deadlock appeared interminable and likely to become fatal. In a\r\ncontest of obstinacy even Wilson could be matched by Clemenceau. The\r\nincreasing bitterness of French attacks upon the Americans began to tell\r\nupon Wilson; for the first time his physical strength seemed likely to\r\ncollapse under the strain. Matters were brought to a head by a bold\r\nstroke, on the 7th of April, when Wilson ordered the _George Washington_\r\nto sail for Brest. The inference was plain: the President would leave the\r\nConference unless the Allies abated their claims.\r\n\r\nThe week of strain was followed by one of adjustment. Fearing an open\r\nbreak with America, Allied leaders showed themselves anxious to find a\r\ncompromise, and Wilson himself was willing to meet them part way, since\r\nhe realized that without France and England his new international system\r\ncould never operate. Colonel House found opportunity for his tested skill\r\nand common sense as a mediator, and he was assisted by Tardieu, who\r\nproved himself to be fertile in suggestions for a practical middle\r\ncourse. As in the case of all compromises, the solutions satisfied no one\r\ncompletely. But clearly some sort of treaty had to be framed, if the\r\nworld were to resume normal life and if the spread of social revolution\r\nwere to be checked. At least the compromises had the virtue of winning\r\nunanimity, without which Europe could not be saved.\r\n\r\nThe indemnity problem was settled, at least for the moment, by postponing\r\na final definite statement of the total amount that Germany must pay. It\r\nwas decided that the sum of five billion dollars (twenty billion gold\r\nmarks), in cash or kind, should be demanded from Germany as an initial\r\npayment, to be made before May 1, 1921. Certain abatements were to be\r\npermitted the Germans, since this sum was to include the expenses of the\r\narmy of occupation, which were reckoned as in the neighborhood of a\r\nbillion dollars; and supplies of food and raw materials, which Germany\r\nmight need to purchase, could be paid for out of that sum. In the second\r\nplace, Germany was required to deliver interest-bearing bonds to a further\r\namount of ten billions; and, if the initial payment of cash fell short of\r\nfive billions by reason of permitted deductions, the amount of bonds was\r\nto be so increased as to bring the total payments in cash, kind, or bonds,\r\nup to fifteen billions by May 1, 1921. If a Reparations Commission, the\r\ndecisions of which Germany must agree to accept, should be satisfied that\r\nmore yet could be paid, a third issue of bonds, amounting to a further ten\r\nbillions might be exacted. Even this total of twenty-five billions was not\r\nto be regarded as final, if Germany's capacity to pay more were determined\r\nby the Reparations Commission. Germany was required to acknowledge full\r\nliability, and the total sum which she might theoretically have to pay was\r\nreckoned by a British expert as between thirty-two and forty-four\r\nbillions. The Reparations Commission, however, was given the power to\r\nrecommend abatements as well as increased payments; upon the wisdom of its\r\nmembers the practical application of the treaty would obviously\r\ndepend.[14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: The proposal of a permanent commission for handling the\r\nwhole matter of reparations was made first by an American financial\r\nadviser, John Foster Dulles. The idea was accepted by Lloyd George and\r\nClemenceau as an efficacious method of enabling them to postpone the\r\ndecision of a definite sum to be paid by Germany until the political\r\nsituation in France and Great Britain should be more favorable.]\r\n\r\nIn truth the reparations clauses of the treaty, which compelled Germany\r\nto hand over what was practically a blank check to the Allies,\r\nrepresented no victory for Wilson. But he had at least prevented the\r\nimposition of the crushing indemnities that had been proposed, and which\r\nmust have been followed by political and economic consequences hardly\r\nshort of disastrous. As for the eastern frontier of France, it was agreed\r\nthat the right of property in the coal mines of the Saar district should\r\nbe given outright to France, as partial but immediate compensation for\r\nthe damage done at Lens and elsewhere. But the district itself was to be\r\nplaced under the League of Nations and a plebiscite at the end of fifteen\r\nyears was to determine its final destiny. The territory on the left bank\r\nof the Rhine was left to Germany, but it was to be demilitarized\r\nentirely, a condition which also applied to a zone fifty kilometers broad\r\nto the east of the Rhine. The bridgeheads on the Rhine, as well as the\r\nGerman districts to the west of the river, were to be occupied for\r\nperiods extending from five to fifteen years, in order to ensure the\r\nexecution of the treaty by the Germans. The French press contended that\r\nClemenceau had made over-great concessions, protesting that the League\r\nwould be utterly unable to protect France against sudden attack,\r\nespecially since the Covenant had not provided for a general military\r\nforce. In return for these concessions by Clemenceau, Wilson gave an\r\nextraordinary _quid pro quo_. He who had declaimed vigorously against all\r\nspecial alliances now agreed that until the League was capable of\r\noffering to France the protection she asked, there should be a separate\r\ntreaty between France, Great Britain, and the United States, according to\r\nwhich the two latter powers should promise to come to the defense of\r\nFrance in case of sudden and unprovoked attack by Germany. The treaty\r\ndid not, according to Wilson, constitute a definite alliance but merely\r\nan \"undertaking,\" but it laid him open to the charge of serious\r\ninconsistency.\r\n\r\nThus was passed, by means of compromise, the most serious crisis of the\r\nConference. In France Wilson never recovered the popularity which he then\r\nlost by his opposition to French demands. In many quarters of Great\r\nBritain and the United States, on the other hand, he was attacked by\r\nliberals for having surrendered to the forces of reaction. In the\r\nConference, however, he had maintained his prestige, and most moderates\r\nwho understood the situation felt that he had done as well as or better\r\nthan could be expected. He had by no means had his way in the matter of\r\nreparations or frontiers, but he had gone far towards a vindication of\r\nhis principles by avoiding a defeat under circumstances where the odds\r\nwere against him. More he probably could not have obtained and no other\r\nAmerican at that time could have secured so much. The sole alternative\r\nwould have been for the American delegates to withdraw from the\r\nConference. Such a step might have had the most disastrous consequences.\r\nIt was true, or Europe believed it to be true, that the Conference\r\nrepresented for the moment the single rallying-point of the elements of\r\nsocial order on the Continent. The withdrawal of the Americans would have\r\nshattered its waning prestige, discouraged liberals in every country, and\r\nperhaps have led to its dissolution. Nearly every one in Paris was\r\nconvinced that the break-up of the Conference would be the signal for\r\nwidespread communistic revolt throughout central Europe. By his broad\r\nconcessions President Wilson had sacrificed some of his principles, but\r\nhe had held the Conference together, the supreme importance of which\r\nseemed at the time difficult to over-emphasize. Having weathered this\r\ncrisis the Conference could now meet the storms that were to arise from\r\nthe demands of the Italians and the Japanese.\r\n\r\nWilson himself was to be encouraged in the midst of those difficulties by\r\nthe triumph accorded him on the 28th of April. On that day the plenary\r\nsession of the Conference adopted without a word of dissent the revised\r\nCovenant of the League of Nations, including the amendment that formally\r\nrecognized the validity of the Monroe Doctrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE SETTLEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson's success in securing approval for the League as the\r\nbasis of the Peace Treaty was his greatest triumph at Paris; and it was\r\naccentuated by the acceptance of certain of the amendments that were\r\ndemanded in America, while those which the French and Japanese insisted\r\nupon were discarded or postponed. In comparison with this success, he\r\ndoubtless regarded his concessions in the matter of reparations and the\r\nspecial Franco-British-American alliance as mere details. His task,\r\nhowever, was by no means completed, since Italian and Japanese claims\r\nthreatened to bring on crises of almost equal danger.\r\n\r\nFrom the early days of the Conference there had been interested\r\nspeculation in the corridors of the Quai d'Orsay as to whether the\r\npromises made to Italy by the Entente Powers in 1915, which were\r\nincorporated in the secret Treaty of London, would be carried into effect\r\nby the final peace settlement. That treaty had been conceived in the\r\nspirit of old-time diplomacy and had assigned to Italy districts which\r\ndisinterested experts declared could not be hers except upon the principle\r\nof the spoils to the strong. Much of the territories promised in the\r\nTyrol, along the Julian Alps, and on the Adriatic coast was inhabited\r\nentirely by non-Italians, whose political and economic fortunes were bound\r\nup with states other than Italy; justice and wisdom alike seemed to\r\ndictate a refusal of Italian claims. The annexation of such districts by\r\nItaly, the experts agreed, would contravene directly the right of\r\nself-determination and might lead to serious difficulties in the future.\r\nWould the President sanction the application of treaties consummated\r\nwithout the knowledge of the United States and in defiance of the\r\nprinciples upon which he had declared that peace must be made? The\r\napplication of the Treaty of London, furthermore, would be at the expense,\r\nchiefly, of the Jugoslavs, that is, a small nation. The Allies, as well as\r\nWilson, had declared that the war had been waged and that the peace must\r\nbe drafted in defense of the rights of smaller nationalities. Justice for\r\nthe weak as for the strong was the basis of the new international order\r\nwhich Wilson was striving to inaugurate.\r\n\r\nHad the struggle been simply over the validity of the Treaty of London,\r\nWilson's position would have been difficult enough, for the Premiers of\r\nFrance and Great Britain had declared that they could do nothing else but\r\nhonor the pledges given in 1915. But Italian opinion had been steadily\r\naroused by a chauvinist press campaign to demand not merely the\r\napplication of the Treaty of London but the annexation of Fiume, which\r\nthe treaty assigned to the Jugoslavs. To this demand both the British and\r\nFrench were opposed, although they permitted Wilson to assume the burden\r\nof denying Italian claims to Fiume. As time went on, Orlando and Sonnino\r\npressed for a decision, even threatening that unless their demands were\r\nsatisfied, Italy would have nothing to do with the German treaty.\r\nFinally, on the 23d of April, the crisis came to a head. On that day the\r\nPresident published a statement setting forth the American position,\r\nwhich he felt had been entirely misrepresented by a propagandist press.\r\nEmphasizing the fact that Italian claims were inconsistent with the\r\nprinciples upon which all the Allies had agreed, as necessary to the\r\nfuture tranquillity of the world, he appealed directly to the Italian\r\npeople to join with the United States in the application of those\r\nprinciples, even at the sacrifice of what seemed their own interest.\r\n\r\nThe appeal was based upon sound facts. Its statements were approved\r\npublicly by allied experts who knew the situation, and privately by\r\nClemenceau and Lloyd George. It had been discussed in the Council of Four\r\nand by no means took Orlando by surprise. But it gave Orlando an\r\nopportunity for carrying out his threat of retiring from the Conference.\r\nInsisting that Wilson had appealed to the Italian people over his head and\r\nthat they must choose between him and the President, he set forth at once\r\nfor Rome, followed by the other Italian commissioners, although the\r\neconomic experts remained at Paris. Orlando was playing a difficult game.\r\nHe was hailed in Rome as the defender of the sacred rights of Italy, but\r\nin Paris he lacked partners. Both the British and French agreed with\r\nWilson that Italy ought not to have Fiume. They secretly regretted the\r\npromises of the London Treaty, although they were prepared to keep their\r\nword, and they were by no means inclined to make further concessions in\r\norder to bring Orlando and his colleagues back. After a few days of\r\nhesitation, they decided to go on with the German treaty and to warn the\r\nItalians that, if they persisted in absenting themselves from the\r\nConference, their withdrawal would be regarded as a breach of the Treaty\r\nof London which stipulated a common peace with the enemy. They also\r\ndecided that Italy could not expect to share in German reparations if her\r\ndelegates were not present to sign the German treaty. Such arguments could\r\nnot fail to weigh heavily with the Italian delegates, even at the moment\r\nwhen the Italian press and people were giving them enthusiastic\r\nencouragement to persist in their uncompromising course. On the 5th of May\r\nOrlando left Rome to resume his place in the Peace Conference.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Japanese had taken advantage of the embarrassment\r\ncaused by the Italian withdrawal, to put forward their special claims in\r\nthe Far East. During the early days of the Conference they had played a\r\ncautious game, as we have seen, attending meetings but taking no decided\r\nstand upon European matters. They had even refused to press to the limit\r\nthe amendment to the League Covenant which enunciated their favorite\r\nprinciple of the equality of races. But now they insisted that on one\r\npoint, at least, Japanese claims must be listened to; their right of\r\ninheritance to the German lease of Kiau-Chau and economic privileges in\r\nthe Shantung peninsula must receive recognition. This claim had long been\r\napproved secretly by the British and French; it had even been accepted by\r\nthe Chinese at the time when Japan had forced the twenty-one demands upon\r\nher. It was disapproved, however, by the American experts in Paris, and\r\nWilson argued strongly for more generous treatment of China. His\r\nstrategic position, one must admit, was not nearly so strong as in the\r\nFiume controversy. In the latter he was supported, at least covertly, by\r\nFrance and England, whose treaty with Italy explicitly denied her claim\r\nto Fiume. The Japanese threat of withdrawal from the Conference, if their\r\nclaims were not satisfied, carried more real danger with it than that of\r\nthe Italians; if the Japanese delegates actually departed making the\r\nsecond of the big five to go, the risk of a complete débâcle was by no\r\nmeans slight. Even assuming that justice demanded as strong a stand for\r\nthe Chinese as Wilson had taken for the Jugoslavs, the practical\r\nimportance of the Shantung question in Europe was of much less\r\nsignificance. The eyes of every small nation of Europe were upon Fiume,\r\nwhich was regarded as the touchstone of Allied professions of justice. If\r\nthe Allied leaders permitted Italy to take Fiume, the small nations would\r\nscoff at all further professions of idealism; they would take no further\r\ninterest either in the Conference or its League. Whereas, on the other\r\nhand, the small nationalities of Europe knew and cared little about the\r\njustice of Chinese pleas.\r\n\r\nSuch considerations may have been in the mind of the President when he\r\ndecided to yield to Japan. The decision throws interesting light upon his\r\ncharacter; he is less the obstinate doctrinaire, more the practical\r\npolitician than has sometimes been supposed. The pure idealist would have\r\nremained consistent in the crisis, refused to do an injustice in the Far\r\nEast as he had refused in the settlement of the Adriatic, and would have\r\ntaken the risk of breaking up the Conference and destroying all chance of\r\nthe League of Nations. Instead, Wilson yielded to practical considerations\r\nof the moment. The best that he could secure was the promise of the\r\nJapanese to retire from the peninsula, a promise the fulfillment of which\r\nobviously depended upon the outcome of the struggle between liberal and\r\nconservative forces in Japan, and which accordingly remained uncertain. He\r\nwas willing to do what he admitted was an injustice, in order to assure\r\nwhat seemed to him the larger and the more certain justice that would\r\nfollow the establishment of the League of Nations.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the Shantung problem removed the last great difficulty\r\nin completing the treaty with Germany, and on the 7th of May the German\r\ndelegates appeared to receive it. Nearly eight weeks of uncertainty\r\nfollowed, taken up with the study of German protests, the construction of\r\nthe treaty with Austria, and finally the last crisis that preceded the\r\nsignature. The terms were drastic and the German Government, in the\r\npersons of Scheidemann, the Premier, and Brockdorff-Rantzau, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, seemed determined that, helpless as she was, Germany\r\nshould not accept them without radical modifications. Their protests\r\ntouched chiefly upon the economic clauses and reparations, the solution of\r\nthe Saar problem, the cession of so much German territory to Poland, and\r\nthe exclusion of Germany from the League of Nations. Ample opportunity was\r\ngiven their delegates to formulate protests, which, although they rarely\r\nintroduced new facts or arguments that had not been discussed, were\r\ncarefully studied by Allied experts. Week after week passed. In certain\r\nquarters among the Allies appeared a tendency to make decided concessions\r\nin order to win the consent of the German delegates. No one wanted to\r\ncarry out an invasion of the defeated country, and there was no guarantee\r\nthat a military invasion would secure acquiescence. Germany's strength was\r\nin sitting still, and she might thus indefinitely postpone the peace. Was\r\nit not the wise course, one heard whispered in Paris, to sugar the\r\nbitterness of the treaty and thus win Germany's immediate signature?\r\n\r\nEarly in June, Lloyd George, evidently under pressure from his Cabinet,\r\ndeclared himself for a decided \"softening\" of the peace terms in order to\r\nsecure the acceptance of the enemy. What would Wilson do? He had been\r\nanathematized at home and abroad as pro-German and desirous of saving\r\nGermany from the consequences of her misdeeds; here was his chance. Would\r\nhe join with the British in tearing up this treaty, which after four\r\nmonths of concentrated effort had just been completed, in order to secure\r\nthe soft peace that he was supposed to advocate? His attitude in this\r\ncontingency showed his ability to preserve an even balance. In the\r\nmeeting of the American delegation that was called to consider the\r\nBritish proposal, he pronounced himself as strongly in favor of any\r\nchanges that would ensure more complete justice. If the British and\r\nFrench would consent to a definite and moderate sum of reparations (a\r\nconsent which he knew was out of the question) he would gladly agree. But\r\nhe would not agree to any concessions to Germany that were not based upon\r\njustice, but merely upon the desire to secure her signature. He was not\r\nin favor of any softening which would mar the justice of the settlement\r\nas drafted. \"We did not come over,\" he said, \"simply to get any sort of\r\npeace treaty signed. We came over to do justice. I believe, even, that a\r\nhard peace is a good thing for Germany herself, in order that she may\r\nknow what an unjust war means. We must not forget what our soldiers\r\nfought for, even if it means that we may have to fight again.\" Wilson's\r\nstand for the treaty as drafted proved decisive. Certain modifications in\r\ndetails were made, but the hasty and unwise enthusiasm of Lloyd George\r\nfor scrapping entire sections was not approved. The Conference could\r\nhardly have survived wholesale concessions to Germany: to prolong the\r\ncrisis would have been a disastrous confession of incompetence. For what\r\nconfidence could have been placed in statesmen who were so patently\r\nunable to make and keep their minds?\r\n\r\nStill the German Government held firm and refused to sign. Foch inspected\r\nthe Allied troops on the Rhine and Pershing renounced his trip to\r\nEngland, in order to be ready for the invasion that had been ordered if\r\nthe time limit elapsed without signature. Only at the last moment did the\r\ncourage of the Germans fail. A change of ministry brought into power men\r\nwho were willing to accept the inevitable humiliation. On the 20th of\r\nJune, the guns and sirens of Paris announced Germany's acceptance of the\r\npeace terms and their promise to sign, and, surprising fact, a vast crowd\r\ngathered on the Place de la Concorde to cheer Wilson; despite his loss of\r\npopularity and the antagonism which he had aroused by his opposition to\r\nnational aspirations of one sort or another, he was still the man whose\r\nname stood as symbol for peace.\r\n\r\nEight days later in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, where forty-eight\r\nyears before had been born the German Empire, the delegates of the Allied\r\nstates gathered to celebrate the obsequies of that Empire. It was no\r\npeace of reconciliation, this treaty between the new German Republic and\r\nthe victorious Allies. The hatred and distrust inspired by five years of\r\nwar were not so soon to be liquidated. As the German delegates, awkward\r\nand rather defiant in their long black frock coats, marched to the table\r\nto affix their signatures, they were obviously, in the eyes of the Allied\r\ndelegates and the hundreds of spectators, always \"the enemy.\" The place\r\nof the Chinese at the treaty table was empty; for them it was no peace of\r\njustice that gave Shantung to the Japanese, and they would not sign. The\r\nSouth African delegate, General Smuts, could not sign without explaining\r\nthe balance of considerations which led him to sanction an international\r\ndocument containing so many flaws.\r\n\r\nIt was not, indeed, the complete peace of justice which Wilson had\r\npromised and which, at times, he has since implied he believed it to be.\r\nBelgians complained that they had not been given the left bank of the\r\nScheldt; Frenchmen were incensed because their frontier had not been\r\nprotected; Italians were embittered by the refusal to approve their\r\nclaims on the Adriatic; radical leaders, the world over, were frank in\r\ntheir expression of disappointment at the failure to inaugurate a new\r\nsocial order. The acquiescence in Japanese demands for Kiau-Chau was\r\nclearly dictated by expediency rather than by justice. Austria, reduced\r\nin size and bereft of material resources, was cut off from the sea and\r\nrefused the possibility of joining with Germany. The nationalistic\r\nambitions of the Rumanians, of the Jugoslavs, of the Czechoslovaks, and\r\nof the Poles were aroused to such an extent that conflicts could hardly\r\nbe avoided. Hungary, deprived of the rim of subject nationalities, looked\r\nforward to the first opportunity of reclaiming her sovereignty over them.\r\nThe Ruthenians complained of Polish domination. Further to the east lay\r\nthe great unsettled problem of Russia.\r\n\r\nBut the most obvious flaws in the treaty are to be found in the economic\r\nclauses. It was a mistake to compel Germany to sign a blank check in the\r\nmatter of reparations. Germany and the world needed to know the exact\r\namount that was to be paid, in order that international commerce might be\r\nset upon a stable basis. The extent of control granted to the Allies over\r\nGerman economic life was unwise and unfair.\r\n\r\nComplete justice certainly was not achieved by President Wilson at Paris,\r\nand it may be questioned whether all the decisions can be regarded even\r\nas expedient. The spirit of the Fourteen Points, as commonly interpreted,\r\nhad not governed the minds of those who sat at the council table. The\r\nmethods adopted by the Council of Ten and the Council of Four were by no\r\nmeans those to which the world looked forward when it hailed the ideal\r\nexpressed in the phrase, \"Open covenants openly arrived at.\" The \"freedom\r\nof the seas,\" if it meant the disappearance of the peculiar position held\r\nby Great Britain on the seas, was never seriously debated, and Wilson\r\nhimself, in an interview given to the London _Times_, sanctioned\r\n\"Britain's peculiar position as an island empire.\" Adequate guarantees\r\nfor the reduction of armaments were certainly not taken at Paris; all\r\nthat was definitely stipulated was the disarmament of the enemy, a step\r\nby no means in consonance with the President's earlier policy which aimed\r\nat universal disarmament. An \"absolutely impartial adjustment of all\r\ncolonial claims\" was hardly carried out by granting the German colonies\r\nto the great powers, even as mandatories of the League of Nations.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the future historian will probably hold that the Peace\r\nConference, with all its selfish interests and mistakes, carried into\r\neffect an amazingly large part of President Wilson's programme, when all\r\nthe difficulties of his position are duly weighed. The territorial\r\nsettlements, on the whole, translated into fact the demands laid down by\r\nthe more special of Wilson's Fourteen Points. France, Belgium, and the\r\nother invaded countries were, of course, evacuated and their restoration\r\npromised; Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France and the wrong of 1871\r\nthus righted; an independent Poland was recognized and given the assured\r\naccess to the sea that Wilson had insisted upon; the subject nationalities\r\nof Austria-Hungary received not merely autonomy but independence. Even as\r\nregards the larger principles enunciated in the Fourteen Points, it may at\r\nleast be argued that President Wilson secured more than he lost. Open\r\ndiplomacy in the sense of conducting international negotiations in an open\r\nforum was not the method of the Peace Conference; and it may not be\r\npossible or even desirable. The article in the Covenant, however, which\r\ninsists upon the public registration of all treaties before their validity\r\nis recognized, goes far towards a fulfillment of the President's pledge of\r\nopen covenants, particularly if his original meaning is liberally\r\ninterpreted. Similarly the Covenant makes provision for the reduction of\r\narmaments. If the treaty did not go far in assuring the \"removal of\r\neconomic barriers,\" at all events the Conference did much to provide for\r\nan international control of traffic which would ensure to all European\r\ncountries, so far as possible, equal facilities for forwarding their\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\nApart from the Fourteen Points Wilson had emphasized two other principles\r\nas necessary to a just and permanent peace. The first of these was that\r\nthe enemy should be treated with a fairness equal to that accorded to the\r\nAllies; the second was the principle that peoples should have the right\r\nto choose the government by which they were to be ruled--the principle of\r\nself-determination. Neither of these principles received full recognition\r\nin the peace settlement. Yet their spirit was infused more completely\r\nthroughout the settlement than would have been the case had not Wilson\r\nbeen at Paris, and to that extent the just and lasting qualities of the\r\npeace were enhanced. In the matter of German reparations the question of\r\njustice was not the point at issue; the damage committed by Germany\r\nsurpassed in value anything that the Allies could exact from her. As to\r\nfrontiers, the unbiased student will probably admit that full justice was\r\ndone Germany when the aspirations of France for annexation of the Saar\r\ndistrict and the provinces on the left bank of the Rhine were\r\ndisappointed; it was the barest justice to France, on the other hand,\r\nthat she should receive the coal mines of the former district and that\r\nthe latter should be demilitarized. In the question of Danzig, and the\r\nPolish corridor to the sea, it was only fair to Poland that she receive\r\nthe adequate outlet which was necessary to her economic life and which\r\nhad been promised her, even if it meant the annexation of large German\r\npopulations, many of which had been artificially brought in as colonists\r\nby the Berlin Government; and in setting up a free city of Danzig, the\r\nConference broke with the practices of old style diplomacy and paid a\r\ntribute to the rights of peoples as against expediency. The same may be\r\nsaid of the decision to provide for plebiscites in East Prussia and in\r\nupper Silesia. On the other hand, the refusal to permit the incorporation\r\nof the new, lesser Austria within Germany was at once unjust and\r\nunwise--a concession to the most shortsighted of old-style diplomatic\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nIn the reorganization of the former Hapsburg territories, Wilsonian\r\nprinciples were always in the minds of the delegates, although in a few\r\ncases they were honored more in the breach than in the observance. Wilson\r\nhimself surrendered to Italy extensive territories in the Tyrol south of\r\nthe Brenner which, if he had followed his own professions, would have been\r\nleft to Austria. A large Jugoslav population on the Julian Alps and in\r\nIstria was placed under Italian rule. The new Czechoslovak state includes\r\nmillions of Germans and Magyars. The boundaries of Rumania were extended\r\nto include many non-Rumanian peoples. Bulgars were sacrificed to Greeks\r\nand to Serbs. In the settlement of each problem the balance always\r\ninclined a little in favor of the victors. But the injustices committed\r\nwere far less extensive than might have been expected, and in most cases\r\nwhere populations were included under alien rule, the decision was based\r\nless on political considerations than on the practical factors of terrain,\r\nrivers, and railroads which must always be taken into consideration in the\r\ndrawing of a frontier. Wherever the issue was clean-cut, as for example\r\nbetween the selfish nationalism of the Italians in their Adriatic demands\r\nand the claim to mere economic life of the Jugoslavs, the old rule which\r\ngranted the spoils to the stronger power was vigorously protested.\r\n\r\nWhatever the mistakes of the Conference, Wilson secured that which he\r\nregarded as the point of prime importance, the League of Nations. This, he\r\nbelieved, would remedy the flaws and eradicate the vices of the treaties.\r\nNo settlement, however perfect at the moment, could possibly remain\r\npermanent, in view of the constantly changing conditions. What was\r\nnecessary was an elasticity that would permit change as change became\r\nnecessary. If the disposition of the Saar basin, for example, proved to be\r\nso unwise or unjust as to cause danger of violence, the League would take\r\ncognizance of the peril and provide a remedy. If the boundaries of eastern\r\nGermany gave undue advantage to the Poles, the League would find ways and\r\nmeans of rectifying the frontier peacefully. If Hungary or Czechoslovakia\r\nfound themselves cut off from sea-ports, the League could hear and act\r\nupon their demands for freedom of transit or unrestricted access to fair\r\nmarkets. That the League was necessary for such and other purposes was\r\nrecognized by many notable economic experts and statesmen besides the\r\nPresident. Herbert Hoover insisted upon the necessity of a League if the\r\nfood problems of central Europe were to be met, and Venizelos remarked\r\nthat \"without a League of Nations, Europe would face the future with\r\ndespair in its heart.\" Because he had the covenant of such an association\r\nincorporated in the German treaty, Wilson accepted all the mistakes and\r\ninjustices of the treaty as minor details and could say of it, doubtless\r\nin all sincerity, \"It's a good job.\" Conscious of victory in the matter\r\nwhich he had held closest to his heart, the President embarked upon the\r\n_George Washington_ on the 29th of June, the day after the signing of the\r\ntreaty, and set forth for home. All that was now needed was the\r\nratification of the treaty by the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE SENATE AND THE TREATY\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither President Wilson nor those who had been working with him at Paris\r\nseriously feared that, after securing the point of chief importance to\r\nhim at the Conference, he would fail to win support for the League of\r\nNations and the treaty at home. They recognized, of course, that his\r\npolitical opponents in the Senate would not acquiesce without a struggle.\r\nThe Republicans were now in the majority, and Henry Cabot Lodge, the new\r\nchairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, had gone far in his\r\nefforts to undermine Wilson's policy at Paris. He had encouraged the\r\nItalians in their imperialistic designs in the Adriatic and had done his\r\nbest to discredit the League of Nations. Former Progressive Senators,\r\nsuch as Johnson and Borah, who like Lodge made personal hostility to\r\nWilson the chief plank in their political programme, had declared\r\nvigorously their determination to prevent the entrance of the United\r\nStates into a League. The Senators as a whole were not well-informed upon\r\nforeign conditions and Wilson had done nothing to enlighten them. He had\r\nnot asked their advice in the formulation of his policy, nor had he\r\nsupplied them with the facts that justified the position he had taken.\r\nNaturally their attitude was not likely to be friendly, now that he\r\nreturned to request their consent to the treaty, and the approach of a\r\npresidential election was bound to affect the action of all ardent\r\npartisans.\r\n\r\nOpposition was also to be expected in the country. There was always the\r\nancient prejudice against participation in European affairs, which had not\r\nbeen broken even by the events of the past two years. The people, even\r\nmore than the Senate, were ignorant of foreign conditions and failed to\r\nunderstand the character of the obligations which the nation would assume\r\nunder the treaty and the covenant of the League. There was genuine fear\r\nlest the United States should become involved in wars and squabbles in\r\nwhich it had no material interest, and lest it should surrender its\r\nindependence of action to a council of foreign powers. This was\r\naccompanied by the belief that an irresponsible President might commit the\r\ncountry to an adventurous course of action which could not be controlled\r\nby Congress. The chief opposition to the treaty and covenant, however,\r\nprobably resulted from the personal dislike of Wilson. This feeling, which\r\nhad always been virulent along the Atlantic coast and in the industrial\r\ncenters of the Middle West, had been intensified by the President's\r\napparent disregard of Congress. More than one man of business argued that\r\nthe treaty must be bad because it was Wilson's work and the covenant worst\r\nof all, since it was his pet scheme. One heard daily in the clubs and on\r\nthe golf-courses of New England and the Middle Atlantic States the remark:\r\n\"I know little about the treaty, but I know Wilson, and I know he must be\r\nwrong.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet the game was probably in the President's hands, had he known how\r\nto play it. Divided as it was on the question of personal devotion to\r\nWilson, the country was a unit in its desire for immediate peace and\r\nnormal conditions. Admitting the imperfections of the treaty, it was\r\nprobably the best that could be secured in view of the conflicting\r\ninterests of the thirty-one signatory powers, and at least it would bring\r\npeace at once. To cast it aside meant long delays and prolongation of the\r\neconomic crisis. The covenant of the League might not be entirely\r\nsatisfactory, but something must be done to prevent war in the future;\r\nand if this League proved unsatisfactory, it could be amended after\r\ntrial. Even the opposing Senators did not believe that they could defeat\r\nthe treaty outright. They were warned by Republican financiers, who\r\nunderstood international economic conditions, that the safety and\r\nprosperity of the world demanded ratification, and that the United States\r\ncould not afford to assume an attitude of isolation even if it were\r\npossible. Broad-minded statesmen who were able to dissociate partisan\r\nemotion from intellectual judgment, such as ex-President Taft, agreed\r\nthat the treaty should be ratified as promptly as possible. All that\r\nSenator Lodge and his associates really hoped for was to incorporate\r\nreservations which would guarantee the independence of American action\r\nand incidentally make it impossible for the President to claim all the\r\ncredit for the peace.\r\n\r\nHad the President proved capable of coöperating with the moderate\r\nRepublican Senators it would probably have been possible for him to have\r\nsaved the fruits of his labor at Paris. An important group honestly\r\nbelieved that the language of the covenant was ambiguous in certain\r\nrespects, particularly as regards the extent of sovereignty sacrificed\r\nby the national government to the League, and the diminution of\r\ncongressional powers. This group was anxious to insert reservations\r\nmaking plain the right of Congress alone to declare war, defining more\r\nexactly the right of the United States to interpret the Monroe Doctrine,\r\nand specifying what was meant by domestic questions that should be exempt\r\nfrom the cognizance of the League. Had Wilson at once combined with this\r\ngroup and agreed to the suggested reservations, he would in all\r\nprobability have been able to secure the two-thirds vote necessary to\r\nratification. The country would have been satisfied; the Republicans\r\nmight have contended that they had \"Americanized\" the treaty; and the\r\nreservations would probably have been accepted by the co-signatories. It\r\nwould have been humiliating to go back to the Allies asking special\r\nprivileges, but Europe needed American assistance too much to fail to\r\nheed these demands. After all America had gained nothing in the way of\r\nterritorial advantage from the war and was asking for nothing in the way\r\nof reparations.\r\n\r\nIt was at this crucial moment that Wilson's peculiar temperamental faults\r\nasserted themselves. Sorely he needed the sane advice of Colonel House,\r\nwho would doubtless have found ways of placating the opposition. But that\r\npractical statesman was in London and the President lacked the capacity\r\nto arrange the compromise that House approved.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson alone either would not or could not negotiate\r\nsuccessfully with the middle group of Republicans. He went so far as to\r\ninitiate private conferences with various Senators, a step indicating his\r\ndesire to avoid the appearance of the dictatorship of which he was\r\naccused; but his attitude on reservations that altered the meaning of any\r\nportion of the treaty or covenant was unyielding, and he even insisted\r\nthat merely interpretative reservations should not be embodied in the\r\ntext of the ratifying resolution. The President evidently hoped that the\r\npressure of public opinion would compel the Senate to yield to the demand\r\nfor immediate peace and for guarantees against future war. His appearance\r\nof rigidity, however, played into the hands of the opponents of the\r\ntreaty, who dominated the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate.\r\nSenator Lodge, chairman of the committee, adopted a stand which, to the\r\nAdministration at least, did not seem to be justified by anything but a\r\ndesire to discredit the work of Wilson. He had, in the previous year,\r\nwarmly advocated a League of Nations, but in the spring of 1919 he had\r\ngiven the impression that he would oppose any League for which Wilson\r\nstood sponsor. Thus he had raised objections to the preliminary draft of\r\nthe covenant which Wilson brought from Paris in February; but when Wilson\r\npersuaded the Allies to incorporate some of the amendments then demanded\r\nby Republican Senators, he at once found new objections. He did not dare\r\nattack the League as a principle, in view of the uncertainty of public\r\nopinion on the issue; but he obviously rejoiced in the President's\r\ninability to unite the Democrats with the middle-ground Republicans, for\r\nwhom Senator McCumber stood as spokesman.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of August a conference was held at the White House, in which\r\nthe President attempted to explain to the Foreign Relations Committee\r\ndoubtful points and to give the reasons for various aspects of the\r\nsettlement. A careful study of the stenographic report indicates that his\r\nanswers to the questions of the Republican Senators were frank, and that\r\nhe was endeavoring to remove the unfortunate effects of his former\r\ndistant attitude. His manner, however, had in it something of the\r\nschoolmaster, and the conference was fruitless. Problems which had been\r\nstudied for months by experts of all the Powers, and to the solution of\r\nwhich had been devoted long weeks of intelligent discussion, were now\r\npassed upon superficially by men whose ignorance of foreign questions was\r\nonly too evident, and who barely concealed their determination to nullify\r\neverything approved by the President. Hence, when the report of the\r\ncommittee was finally presented on the 10th of September, the Republican\r\nmajority demanded no less than thirty-eight amendments and four\r\nreservations. A quarter of the report was not concerned at all with the\r\nsubject under discussion, but was devoted to an attack upon Wilson's\r\nautocratic methods and his treatment of the Senate. As was pointed out by\r\nSenator McCumber, the single Republican who dissented from the majority\r\nreport, \"not one word is said, not a single allusion made, concerning\r\neither the great purposes of the League of Nations or the methods by\r\nwhich these purposes are to be accomplished. Irony and sarcasm have been\r\nsubstituted for argument and positions taken by the press or individuals\r\noutside the Senate seem to command more attention than the treaty\r\nitself.\"\r\n\r\nThe President did not receive the popular support which he expected, and\r\nthe burst of popular wrath which he believed would overwhelm senatorial\r\nopposition was not forthcoming. In truth public opinion was confused.\r\nAmerica was not educated to understand the issues at stake. Wilson's\r\npurposes at Paris had not been well reported in the press, and he himself\r\nhad failed to make plain the meaning of his policy. It was easy for\r\nopponents of the treaty to muddy discussion and to arouse emotion where\r\nreason was desirable. The wildest statements were made as to the effect of\r\nthe covenant, such as that entrance into the League would at once involve\r\nthe United States in war, and that Wilson was sacrificing the interests of\r\nAmerica to the selfish desires of European states. The same men who, a\r\nyear before, had complained that Wilson was opposing England and France,\r\nnow insisted that he had sold the United States to those nations. They\r\ninvented the catchword of \"one hundred per cent Americanism,\" the test of\r\nwhich was to be opposition to the treaty. They found strange coadjutors.\r\nThe German-Americans, suppressed during the war, now dared to emerge,\r\nhoping to save the Fatherland from the effects of defeat by preventing the\r\nratification of the treaty; the politically active Irish found opportunity\r\nto fulminate against British imperialism and \"tyranny\" which they\r\ndeclared had been sanctioned by the treaty; impractical liberals, who were\r\ndisappointed because Wilson had not inaugurated the social millennium,\r\njoined hands with out-and-out reactionaries. But the most discouraging\r\naspect of the situation was that so many persons permitted their judgment\r\nto be clouded by their dislike of the President's personality. However\r\nmuch they might disapprove the tactics of Senator Lodge they could not but\r\nsympathize to some extent with the Senate's desire to maintain its\r\nindependence, which they believed had been assailed by Wilson. Discussions\r\nwhich began with the merits of the League of Nations almost invariably\r\nculminated with vitriolic attacks upon the character of Woodrow Wilson.\r\n\r\nIn the hope of arousing the country to a clear demand for immediate peace\r\nbased upon the Paris settlement, Wilson decided to carry out the plan\r\nformulated some weeks previous and deliver a series of speeches from the\r\nMiddle West to the Pacific coast. He set forth on the 3d of September and\r\nmade more than thirty speeches. He was closely followed by some of his\r\nfiercest opponents. Senators Johnson and Borah, members of the Foreign\r\nRelations Committee, who might have been expected to remain in Washington\r\nto assist in the consideration of the treaty by the Senate, followed in\r\nWilson's wake, attempting to counteract the effect of his addresses, and\r\nincidentally distorting many of the treaty's provisions, which it is\r\ncharitable to assume they did not comprehend. The impression produced by\r\nthe President was varied, depending largely upon the political character\r\nof his audience. East of the Mississippi he was received with comparative\r\ncoolness, but as he approached the coast enthusiasm became high, and at\r\nSeattle and Los Angeles he received notable ovations. And yet in these\r\nhours of triumph as in the previous moments of discouragement, farther\r\neast, he must have felt that the issues were not clear. The struggle was\r\nno longer one for a new international order that would ensure peace, so\r\nmuch as a personal conflict between Lodge and Wilson. Whether the\r\nPresident were applauded or anathematized, the personal note was always\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIt was evident, during the tour, that the nervous strain was telling upon\r\nWilson. He had been worn seriously by his exertions in Paris, where he\r\nwas described by a foreign plenipotentiary as the hardest worker in the\r\nConference. The brief voyage home, which was purposely lengthened to give\r\nhim better chance of recuperation, proved insufficient. Forced to resume\r\nthe struggle at the moment when he thought victory was his, repudiated\r\nwhere he expected to find appreciation, the tour proved to be beyond his\r\nphysical and nervous strength. At Pueblo, Colorado, on the 25th of\r\nSeptember, he broke down and returned hastily to Washington. Shortly\r\nafterwards the President's condition became so serious that his\r\nphysicians forbade all political conferences, insisting upon a period of\r\ncomplete seclusion and rest, which was destined to continue for many\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThus at the moment of extreme crisis in the fortunes of the treaty its\r\nchief protagonist was removed from the scene of action and the Democratic\r\nforces fighting for ratification were deprived of effective leadership.\r\nHad there been a real leader in the Senate who could carry on the fight\r\nwith vigor and finesse, the treaty might even then have been saved; but\r\nWilson's system had permitted no understudies. There was no one to lead\r\nand no one to negotiate a compromise. From his sick-room, where his\r\nnatural obstinacy seemed to be intensified by his illness, the President\r\nstill refused to consider any reservations except of a purely\r\ninterpretative character, and the middle-ground Republicans would not\r\nvote to ratify without \"mild reservations,\" some of which seemed to him\r\nmore than interpretative.\r\n\r\nSenatorial forces were roughly divided into four groups. There were the\r\n\"bitter-enders,\" typified by Johnson, Borah, and Brandegee, who frankly\r\nwanted to defeat the treaty and the League outright; there were the\r\n\"reservationists,\" most of whom, like Lodge, wanted the same but did not\r\ndare say so openly; there were the \"mild reservationists,\" most of whom\r\nwere Republicans, who sincerely desired immediate peace and asked for no\r\nimportant changes in the treaty; and finally there were those who desired\r\nto ratify the treaty as it stood. The last-named group, made up of\r\nDemocrats, numbered from forty-one to forty-four, and obviously needed\r\nthe assistance of the \"mild reservationists,\" if they were to secure a\r\ntwo-thirds vote of the Senate. During October, all the amendments which\r\nthe Foreign Relations Committee brought forward were defeated through the\r\ncombination of the last two groups. Early in November, however, fourteen\r\nreservations were adopted, the \"mild reservationists\" voting with Senator\r\nLodge, for lack of any basis of compromise with the Democrats. The effect\r\nof these reservations would, undoubtedly, have been to release the\r\nUnited States from many of the obligations assumed by other members,\r\nwhile assuring to it the benefits of the League. The most serious of the\r\nreservations was that concerned with Article X of the covenant, which\r\nstated that the United States would assume no obligations to preserve the\r\nterritorial integrity or political independence of any other country, or\r\nto interfere in controversies between nations, unless in any particular\r\ncase Congress should so provide. From the moment when Wilson first\r\ndeveloped his policy of international service, coöperative interference\r\nin order to prevent acts of aggression by a strong against a weaker power\r\nhad been the chief point in his programme. It was contained in his early\r\nPan-American policy; it ran through his speeches in the campaign of 1916;\r\nit was in the Fourteen Points. It was his specific contribution to the\r\ncovenant in Paris. Article X was the one point in the covenant which\r\nWilson would not consent to modify or, as he expressed it, see\r\n\"nullified.\" Just because it lay nearest Wilson's heart, it was the\r\narticle against which the most virulent attacks of the \"die-hards\" were\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\nThe President denounced the reservation on Article X, as a \"knife-thrust\r\nat the heart of the covenant,\" and its inclusion in the ratifying\r\nresolution of the Senate, spelled the defeat of ratification. On the eve\r\nof voting he wrote to Senator Hitchcock, leader of the Democratic forces\r\nin the Senate, \"I assume that the Senators only desire my judgment upon\r\nthe all-important question of the resolution containing the many\r\nreservations of Senator Lodge. On that I cannot hesitate, for, in my\r\nopinion, the resolution in that form does not provide for ratification\r\nbut rather for nullification of the treaty. I sincerely hope that the\r\nfriends and supporters of the treaty will vote against the Lodge\r\nresolution of ratification.\" The \"mild reservationists\" led by McCumber\r\nvoted with the Lodge group for the resolution; but the \"bitter-enders,\"\r\ncombining with the supporters of the original treaty, outnumbered them.\r\nThe vote stood thirty-nine in favor of the resolution and fifty-five\r\nagainst. When a motion for unconditional ratification was offered by\r\nSenator Underwood, it was defeated by a vote of fifty-three to\r\nthirty-eight.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans on the Foreign Relations Committee had succeeded far\r\nbeyond the hopes of their leaders in August. They had killed the treaty,\r\nbut in such an indirect fashion as to confuse the public and to fix upon\r\nthe President the blame for delaying the peace. It was easy to picture\r\nthe obstinacy of the President as the root of all the evil which\r\nresulted from the political and economic uncertainty overhanging our\r\nEuropean relations. So widespread was this feeling among his natural\r\nopponents, that the Republican Senators began to assume a far loftier\r\ntone, and to laugh at the tardy efforts of the Democrats to arrange a\r\ncompromise. When Senator Pomerene, after consultation with Administration\r\nleaders, proposed the appointment of a \"committee of conciliation,\" to\r\nfind a basis of ratification that would secure the necessary two-thirds\r\nvote, the motion was killed by forty-eight to forty-two. Senator Lodge\r\nannounced that he would support the resolution suggested by Knox, which\r\nwould end the war by congressional resolution and thus compel Wilson to\r\nnegotiate a separate treaty of peace with Germany.\r\n\r\nIntelligent public opinion, however, was anxious that the quarrels of the\r\nPresident and the Senate should not be allowed to delay the\r\nsettlement[15]. Rightly or wrongly the people felt that the struggle was\r\nlargely a personal one between Lodge and Wilson, and insisted that each\r\nmust yield something of their contention. On the one hand, ex-President\r\nTaft and others of the more far-seeing Republicans worked anxiously for\r\ncompromise, with the assistance of such men as Hoover, who perceived the\r\nnecessity of a League, but who were willing to sacrifice its efficiency\r\nto some extent, if only the United States could be brought in. On the\r\nother hand, various Democrats who were less directly under Wilson's\r\ninfluence wanted to meet these friends of the League half-way. During\r\nDecember and January unofficial conferences between the senatorial groups\r\ntook place and progress towards a settlement seemed likely. The\r\nRepublicans agreed to soften the language of their minor reservations,\r\nand Wilson even intimated that he would consent to a mild reservation on\r\nArticle X, although as he later wrote to Hitchcock, he felt strongly that\r\nany reservation or resolution stating that the \"United States assumes no\r\nobligation under such and such an article unless or except, would chill\r\nour relationship with the nations with whom we expect to be associated in\r\nthis great enterprise of maintaining the world's peace.\" It was\r\nimportant \"not to create the impression that we are trying to escape\r\nobligations.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: A straw vote taken in 311 colleges and including 158,000\r\nstudents and professors showed an inclination to favor Wilson rather than\r\nLodge, but the greatest number approved compromise: four per cent favored\r\na new treaty with Germany; eight per cent favored killing the Versailles\r\ntreaty; only seventeen per cent approved the Lodge programme; thirty per\r\ncent approved ratification of the treaty without change; and thirty-eight\r\nper cent favored compromise.]\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of January the country was startled by the publication of a\r\nletter written by Viscount Grey, who had been appointed British Ambassador\r\nto the United States, but who had returned to England after a four months'\r\nstay, during which he had been unable to secure an interview with the sick\r\nPresident. In this letter he attempted to explain to the British the\r\ncauses of American hesitancy to accept the League. He then went on to\r\nstate that the success of the League depended upon the adherence of the\r\nUnited States, and while admitting the serious character of the\r\nreservations proposed by Senator Lodge, insisted that American coöperation\r\nought not to be refused because conditions were attached. His views were\r\nunofficial, but it seemed clear that they were approved by the British\r\nCabinet, and they received a chorus of endorsement from the French and\r\nBritish press.\r\n\r\nThe publication of Grey's letter opened a path to peace to both Senate\r\nand President had they been willing to follow it. The Senate, by very\r\nslight verbal softening of the language of its reservations, the\r\nPresident by taking the British Ambassador at his word, might have\r\nreached an agreement. The Lodge group, however, which had shown some\r\nindications of a desire for compromise, was threatened by the \"die-hards\"\r\nwho were determined to defeat the treaty; fearing beyond everything to\r\nbreak party unity, Lodge finally refused to alter the language of the\r\nstrong reservation on Article X, which stated that the United States\r\nwould assume no obligation to preserve the independence of other nations\r\nby military force or the use of its resources or any form of economic\r\ndiscrimination, unless Congress should first so provide. Inasmuch as the\r\neconomic outlawry of the offending state was the means which Wilson\r\nchiefly counted upon, the reservation took all practical significance\r\nfrom Article X, since the delays resulting from congressional\r\ndeliberation would prevent effective action. The President, possibly\r\nbelieving that imperialist elements abroad were not sorry to see Article\r\nX nullified, refused to accept the resolution of ratification so long as\r\nit contained this reservation. \"The imperialist,\" he wrote, \"wants no\r\nLeague of Nations, but if, in response to the universal cry of masses\r\neverywhere, there is to be one, he is interested to secure one suited to\r\nhis own purposes, one that will permit him to continue the historic game\r\nof pawns and peoples--the juggling of provinces, the old balance of\r\npower, and the inevitable wars attendant upon these things. The\r\nreservation proposed would perpetuate the old order. Does any one really\r\nwant to see the old game played again? Can any one really venture to take\r\npart in reviving the old order? The enemies of a League of Nations have\r\nby every true instinct centered their efforts against Article X, for it\r\nis undoubtedly the foundation of the whole structure. It is the bulwark,\r\nand the only bulwark of the rising democracy of the world against the\r\nforces of imperialism and reaction.\"\r\n\r\nThe deadlock was complete, and on March 19, 1920, when the vote on\r\nratification was taken, the necessary two-thirds were lacking by seven\r\nvotes. At the last moment a number of Democrats joined with the\r\nRepublican reservationists, making fifty-seven in favor of ratification.\r\nOn the other hand the bitter-end Republicans voted against it with the\r\nDemocrats who stood by the President, thus throwing thirty-seven votes\r\nagainst ratification. It had taken the Peace Conference five months to\r\nconstruct the treaty with Germany in all its complexities, and secure the\r\nunanimous approval of the delegates of thirty-one states. The Senate had\r\nconsumed more than eight months merely in criticizing the treaty and had\r\nfinally refused to ratify it.\r\n\r\nWe are, perhaps, too close to the event to attempt any apportionment of\r\nresponsibility for this failure to cap our military successes by a peace\r\nwhich--when all has been said--was the nearest possible approach to the\r\nideal peace. It is clear that the blame is not entirely on one side.\r\nHistorians will doubtless level the indictment of ignorance and political\r\nobliquity against the Senators who tried, either directly or indirectly,\r\nto defeat the treaty; they will find much justification for their charge,\r\nalthough it will be more difficult to determine the dividing line between\r\nmere incapacity to appreciate the necessities of the world, and the\r\ndesire to discredit, at any cost, the work of Woodrow Wilson. On the\r\nother hand, the President cannot escape blame, although the charge will\r\nbe merely that of tactical incapacity and mistaken judgment. His\r\ninability to combine with the moderate Republican Senators first gave a\r\nchance to those who wanted to defeat the treaty. His obstinate refusal to\r\naccept reservations at the end, when it was clear that the treaty could\r\nnot be ratified without them, showed a regard for form, at the expense of\r\npractical benefit. Granted that the reservations altered the character\r\nof the League or the character of American participation in it, some sort\r\nof a League was essential and the sooner the United States entered the\r\nbetter it would be. Its success would not rest upon phrases, but upon the\r\nspirit of the nations that composed it; the building-up of a new and\r\nbetter international order would not be determined by this reservation or\r\nthat. Wilson's claim to high rank as a statesmen would probably be more\r\nclear if he had accepted what was possible at the moment, in the hope\r\nthat the League would be improved as the country and the world became\r\nbetter educated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the accident of history the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson, which he\r\ndesigned to utilize for a series of social reforms, was characterized by\r\nthe supreme importance of foreign affairs. Whatever the significance of\r\nthe legislative enactments of his first year of office, he will be\r\nremembered as the neutrality President, the war President, and the peace\r\nPresident. Each phase of his administration represents a distinct aspect\r\nof his policy and called into prominence distinct aspects of his\r\ncharacter. It is the third, however, which gives to his administration\r\nthe place of importance which it will hold in history; not merely because\r\nof the stamp which he attempted to place upon the peace, but because the\r\ntwo earlier phases are in truth expressive of his whole-hearted devotion\r\nto the cause of peace. The tenacity with which he held to neutrality in\r\nthe face of intense provocation resulted less from his appreciation of\r\nthe pacific sentiments of the nation, or a desire to assure its economic\r\nprosperity, than it did from his instinctive abhorrence of war. When\r\nfinally forced into war, he based his action upon the hope of securing a\r\nnew international order which would make war in the future impossible or\r\nless frequent. In his mind the war was always waged in order to ensure\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nWhatever his mistakes or successes as neutrality President or war\r\nPresident, therefore, it is as peace President that he will be judged by\r\nhistory. Inevitably future generations will study with especial attention\r\nthe unfolding of his constructive peace policy, from his declaration of\r\nthe Fourteen Points to the Peace Conference. In reality his policy of\r\ninternational service, to be rendered by the strong nations of the world\r\nin behalf of peace and of absolute justice toward the weaker nations, was\r\ndeveloped all through the year 1916. It was then that he seized upon a\r\nLeague of Nations as the essential instrument. But the true significance\r\nof this policy was hardly perceived before the speech of the Fourteen\r\nPoints, in January, 1918. That speech gave to Wilson his position in the\r\nworld, as prëeminent exponent of the new ideals of international\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nWhat the President demanded was nothing new. The principle of justice, as\r\nthe underlying basis of intercourse between nations, has received wide\r\nsupport at all epochs of history; the cause of international peace, as an\r\nultimate ideal, has always been advocated in the abstract; the idea of a\r\nLeague of Nations has frequently been mooted. But it was Wilson's fate to\r\nbe ruler of a great nation at the moment when the need of peace, justice,\r\nand international organization was more clearly demonstrated than ever\r\nbefore in the world's history. Germany's cynical disregard of Belgian\r\nindependence, the horrors and waste of the war for which Germany was\r\nchiefly responsible, the diplomatic disorganization of Europe, which\r\npermitted this world disaster, desired by merely a handful of\r\nfirebrands--all these tragic and pitiful facts had been burned into the\r\nmind of the age. There was a definite determination that a recurrence of\r\nsuch catastrophes should not be permitted. The period of the war will be\r\nregarded by future historians as one of transition from the international\r\nchaos of the nineteenth century to an organization of nations, which,\r\nhowever loose, should crystallize the conscience of the world, preserve\r\nits peace, and translate into international politics the standards of\r\nmorality which have been set up for the individual.\r\n\r\nIn this transition President Wilson played a part of the first importance.\r\nHis rôle was not so much that of the executive leader as of the prophet.\r\nHe was not the first to catch the significance of the transition, nor did\r\nhe possess the executive qualities which would enable him to break down\r\nall obstacles and translate ideals into facts. But he alone of the notable\r\nstatesmen of the world was able to express adequately the ill-defined\r\nhopes of the peoples of all nations. He gave utterance to the words which\r\nthe world had been waiting for, and they carried weight because of his\r\nposition. Alone of the great powers the United States had no selfish\r\ndesigns to hide behind fair promises of a better future. As President of\r\nthe United States, Woodrow Wilson might look for the confidence of Europe;\r\nthere was no European Government which could arouse similar trust. So long\r\nas the war lasted, the President's success as a prophet of the ideal was\r\nassured, alike by his ability to voice inarticulate hopes and by reason of\r\nhis position as chief of the most powerful and most disinterested nation\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nBut with the end of the war he faced a new task and one which was\r\ninfinitely more difficult. The flush of victory obliterated from the minds\r\nof many in the Allied countries the high ideals which they had nourished\r\nduring the bitterness of the struggle. The moment had arrived when\r\npractical advantage might be taken from the defeat of the enemy, and it\r\nseemed madness to surrender such advantage for the sake of quixotic\r\nideals. The statesmen of Europe once more viewed affairs through the\r\ncolored prism of national selfishness. In America, where Wilsonian ideals\r\nhad at best been imperfectly appreciated, men were wearied by\r\ninternational problems and longed for a return to the simple complexity of\r\nthe business life which they understood. The President was confronted by a\r\ndouble problem. He must win from Europe acceptance of his programme,\r\ncrystallized in the League of Nations; from his fellow countrymen he must\r\nsecure the support necessary if the United States were to continue to play\r\nthe rôle in world affairs which she had undertaken during the war, and\r\nwhich alone would make possible an effective League of Nations. To meet\r\nthe difficulties of the task, President Wilson was imperfectly equipped.\r\nHe lacked the dynamic qualities of a Roosevelt, which might have enabled\r\nhim to carry his opponents off their feet by an overwhelming rush; he was\r\nnot endowed with the tactical genius of a skillful negotiator; he was,\r\nabove all, handicapped by the personal hostilities which he had aroused at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nIn Europe the President achieved at least partial success. He proved\r\nunable to marshal the forces of liberalism in such a way as to carry his\r\ncomplete programme to victory, and the sacrifices which he made to the\r\nspirit of selfish nationalism cost him the support and the confidence of\r\nmany progressive elements, while they did not placate the hostility of\r\nthe reactionaries. But he secured the League of Nations, the symbol and\r\nthe instrument of the new international organization which he sought.\r\nThereby at least a beginning was made in concrete form, which might later\r\nbe developed, when the force of the post-bellum reaction had wasted\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAt home, however, the forces of opposition proved strong enough to rob\r\nthe President of what might have been a triumph. He lacked the capacity\r\nto reconcile his personal and political opponents, as well as the ability\r\nto compromise with the elements that were inclined to meet him half-way.\r\nIn accordance with his basic principles he appealed from the politicians\r\nto the people. But here again he failed, whether because of personal\r\nunpopularity, or because of the poor publicity which had been given his\r\nefforts at Paris, or because of the physical breakdown which shattered\r\nhis persuasive powers and finally led to his retirement from the\r\nstruggle. The vindication which he sought in the presidential election of\r\n1920 was denied him. The country was tired of a Democratic Administration\r\nand gave to the Republican candidate an overwhelming plurality. The sole\r\ncomfort that Wilson could take, in the face of the election returns, was\r\nthat both candidates had declared for the principle of international\r\norganization and that the most distinguished supporters of the successful\r\nRepublican candidate had pledged themselves to a League of Nations.\r\n\r\nThe months that followed the President's return from Paris until the close\r\nof his administration thus form a period of personal tragedy. He had\r\nachieved a broad measure of success in Europe, where the difficulties\r\nappeared stupendous, only to have the cup dashed from his lips at the last\r\nmoment in his own country. The bitterness of the experience was\r\nintensified by his physical helplessness. But we should lack perspective\r\nif we made the mistake of confusing personal tragedy with failure. His\r\nwork remained uncrowned, but there was much that could never be undone.\r\nThe articulate expression of the hopes of the world, which President\r\nWilson voiced during the war, remains imperishable as a guide to this and\r\nfuture generations. The League of Nations, weakened by the absence of the\r\nUnited States but actually organized and in operation, was the President's\r\nwork. Whatever the fortunes of this particular League the steps taken\r\ntoward international coöperation by its foundation can never be completely\r\nretraced.\r\n\r\nWoodrow Wilson, however, is not to be assessed by his accomplishment. It\r\nis as prophet and not as man of action that he will be regarded by\r\nhistory. Like the prophets of old, like Luther or Mazzini, he lacked the\r\ncapacity for carrying to practical success the ideal which he preached.\r\nBut to assume that he must accordingly be adjudged a failure is to ignore\r\nthe significance of the ideals to which he awakened the world. Much there\r\nwas that was unattainable and intangible, but its value to mankind in the\r\ndevelopment of international relations may be inestimable.\r\n\r\n    Not on the vulgar mass\r\n    Called \"work\" must sentence pass\r\n    Things done, that took the eye and had the price....\r\n    But all, the world's coarse thumb\r\n    And finger failed to plumb,\r\n    So passed in making up the main account;\r\n    All instincts immature,\r\n    All purposes unsure,\r\n    That weighed not as his work, yet swelled the man's amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far no adequate biography of President Wilson, covering his career\r\nthrough the Peace Conference, has been published. The most suggestive is\r\nHenry Jones Ford's _Woodrow Wilson: The Man and His Work_ (1916) which\r\nstops with the close of the first term. The author, a Princeton professor,\r\nis a warm personal and political admirer of the President, but he makes a\r\ndefinite attempt at critical appreciation. W. E. Dodd's _Woodrow Wilson\r\nand His Work_ (1920) is comprehensive and brings the story to the end of\r\nthe Peace Conference, but it is marred by eulogistic interpretation and\r\nanti-capitalistic bias. An interesting effort to interpret the President\r\nto British readers in the form of biography has been made by H. W. Harris\r\nin _President Wilson: His Problems and His Policy_ (1917). W. B. Hale, in\r\n_The Story of a Style_ (1920), attempts to analyze the motives by which\r\nthe President is inspired. But the best material to serve this end is to\r\nbe found in the President's writings, especially _Congressional\r\nGovernment_ (1885), _An Old Master and Other Political Essays_ (1893),\r\n_Constitutional Government in the United States_ (1908), _The New Freedom_\r\n(1913), _International Ideals_ (1919). The two last-named are collections\r\nof addresses made in explanation and advocacy of his plans of domestic and\r\ninternational reform. The most convenient edition of the President's\r\nofficial writings and speeches is Albert Shaw's _President Wilson's State\r\nPapers and Addresses_ (1918), edited with an analytical index.\r\n\r\nFor the period of neutrality a storehouse of facts is to be found in _The\r\nNew York Times Current History_, published monthly. The _American Year\r\nBook_ contains a succinct narrative of the events of each year, which may\r\nbe supplemented by that in the _Annual Register_ which is written from the\r\nBritish point of view. A brief résumé of Wilson's first term is contained\r\nin F. A. Ogg's _National Progress_ (1918). More detailed is the first\r\nvolume of J. B. McMaster's _The United States in the World War_ (1918),\r\nwhich is based upon the newspapers and necessarily lacks perspective, but\r\nis comprehensive and extremely useful for purposes of reference. The\r\nclearest outline of President Wilson's treatment of foreign affairs is to\r\nbe found in E. E. Robinson and V. J. West's _The Foreign Policy of\r\nPresident Wilson, 1913-1917_ (1917). The narrative is brief but\r\ninterpretative and is followed by numerous excerpts from the President's\r\nspeeches and state papers. The tone of the narrative is extremely\r\nfavorable and President Wilson is credited with consistency rather than\r\ncapacity for development, but the arrangement is excellent. More\r\ncomprehensive is the edition by J. B. Scott, entitled _President Wilson's\r\nForeign Policy: Messages, Addresses, Papers_ (1918). Johann von\r\nBernstorff's _My Three Years in America_ (1920) is a well-reasoned\r\napologia by the German Ambassador, which contains information of much\r\nvalue; it is not impossible for the critically minded to distinguish the\r\ntrue from the false. The description of German criminal activities\r\ncontained in Horst von der Goltz's _My Adventures as a German Secret\r\nAgent_ (1917), should be checked up with the report of the Senate\r\nCommittee of Inquiry into the German propaganda. _The Real Colonel House_,\r\nby A. D. Howden-Smith (1918), throws useful sidelights on Wilson and\r\ncontains valuable material on the activities of Colonel House as\r\nnegotiator before the entrance into the war of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe best general narrative of America's war effort is J. S. Bassett's\r\n_Our War with Germany_ (1919); it is clear and succinct, beginning with\r\nthe early effects of the war on the United States in 1914, and ending\r\nwith the Peace Conference. An interesting, but irritating, account is to\r\nbe found in George Creel's _The War, the World and Wilson_ (1920), which\r\nis passionate in its defense of the President, and blurs truth with\r\ninaccuracy on almost every page. F. F. Kelly's _What America Did_ (1919)\r\nis a brief popular account of the building of the army at home and abroad\r\nand the organization of industry: clear, inaccurate, uncritical. The most\r\nconvenient summary of the organization of national resources is F. L.\r\nPaxson's \"The American War Government,\" in _The American Historical\r\nReview_, October, 1920, which should be supplemented by the _Handbook of\r\nEconomic Agencies for the War of 1917_, monograph No. 3 of the Historical\r\nBranch, War Plans Division, General Staff (1919). The former contains\r\nmany references in footnotes, of which the most important are the _Report\r\nof the Chief of Staff_ (1919) and the _Report of the Provost Marshal\r\nGeneral_ (1919). The published _Investigation of the War Department,\r\nHearing before the Committee on Military Affairs_ (1918) is invaluable\r\nThe most complete information on ordnance is to be found in the report of\r\nGeneral Benedict Crowell, _America's Munitions, 1917-1918_ (1919); it is\r\nan official defense and should be read critically. A graphic picture of\r\nAmerican accomplishments is given in L. P. Ayres's _The War with Germany;\r\nA Statistical Summary_ (1919). The best account of operations in France\r\nis still General Pershing's _Report to the Secretary of War_, which is\r\nprinted in _New York Times Current History_, January and February, 1920.\r\nIt may be supplemented by Shipley Thomas's _The History of the A. E. F._\r\n(1920).\r\n\r\nThe American point of view on the Peace Conference is set forth\r\nauthoritatively in _What Really Happened at Paris_ (1921), a collection\r\nof lectures delivered by members of the American Peace Commission and\r\nedited by Edward M. House and Charles Seymour. _Some Problems of the\r\nPeace Conference_ (1920), by C. H. Haskins and R. H. Lord, is an accurate\r\nand comprehensive analysis of the territorial questions settled at Paris.\r\nThe British point of view and the most important documents are given in\r\n_A History of the Peace Conference of Paris_ (1920), written chiefly by\r\nBritish delegates and edited by H. W. V. Temperley. The French point of\r\nview is admirably presented in André Tardieu's _The Truth about the\r\nTreaty_ (1921). An excellent picture of the conflict of interests and the\r\nmanner in which they were decided is to be found in C. T. Thompson's _The\r\nPeace Conference Day by Day_ (1920). Robert Lansing's _The Peace\r\nNegotiations_ (1921) is interesting as giving the opinions of an American\r\nCommissioner who disagreed with Mr. Wilson's methods at Paris. J. M.\r\nKeynes's _The Economic Consequences of the Peace_ (1920) contains an\r\neconomic analysis which is more trustworthy than his brilliant, but\r\nmisleading, picture of the Conference. It should not be read except in\r\ncompany with the authoritative and accurate _The Making of the Reparation\r\nand Economic Clauses_ (1920), by B. M. Baruch. A clever but superficial\r\ncriticism of President Wilson's peace policies is to be found in J. M.\r\nBeck's _The Passing of the Freedom_ (1920).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAdams, J.
