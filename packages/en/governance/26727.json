During that period\r\nhistorical study has made a great advance. Year after year the mass of\r\nmaterials for a new History of England has increased; new lights have\r\nbeen thrown on events and characters, and old errors have been\r\ncorrected. Many notable works have been written on various periods of\r\nour history; some of them at such length as to appeal almost exclusively\r\nto professed historical students. It is believed that the time has come\r\nwhen the advance which has been made in the knowledge of English history\r\nas a whole should be laid before the public in a single work of fairly\r\nadequate size. Such a book should be founded on independent thought and\r\nresearch, but should at the same time be written with a full knowledge\r\nof the works of the best modern historians and with a desire to take\r\nadvantage of their teaching wherever it appears sound._\r\n\r\n_The vast number of authorities, printed and in manuscript, on which a\r\nHistory of England should be based, if it is to represent the existing\r\nstate of knowledge, renders co-operation almost necessary and certainly\r\nadvisable. The History, of which this volume is an instalment, is an\r\nattempt to set forth in a readable form the results at present attained\r\nby research. It will consist of twelve volumes by twelve different\r\nwriters, each of them chosen as being specially capable of dealing with\r\nthe period which he undertakes, and the editors, while leaving to each\r\nauthor as free a hand as possible, hope to insure a general similarity\r\nin method of treatment, so that the twelve volumes may in their\r\ncontents, as well as in their outward appearance, form one History._\r\n\r\n_As its title imports, this History will primarily deal with politics,\r\nwith the History of England and, after the date of the union with\r\nScotland, Great Britain, as a state or body politic; but as the life of\r\na nation is complex, and its condition at any given time cannot be\r\nunderstood without taking into account the various forces acting upon\r\nit, notices of religious matters and of intellectual, social, and\r\neconomic progress will also find place in these volumes. The footnotes\r\nwill, so far as is possible, be confined to references to authorities,\r\nand references will not be appended to statements which appear to be\r\nmatters of common knowledge and do not call for support. Each volume\r\nwill have an Appendix giving some account of the chief authorities,\r\noriginal and secondary, which the author has used. This account will be\r\ncompiled with a view of helping students rather than of making long\r\nlists of books without any notes as to their contents or value. That the\r\nHistory will have faults both of its own and such as will always in some\r\nmeasure attend co-operative work, must be expected, but no pains have\r\nbeen spared to make it, so far as may be, not wholly unworthy of the\r\ngreatness of its subject._\r\n\r\n_Each volume, while forming part of a complete History, will also in\r\nitself be a separate and complete book, will be sold separately, and\r\nwill have its own index, and two or more maps._\r\n\r\nThe History is divided as follows:--\r\n\r\nVol. I.

At the time of the late Warden's death in 1903\r\nthree chapters (x., xii. and xviii.) were unwritten, and one (xx.) was\r\nleft incomplete. It was also found that the volume had to be recast in\r\norder to meet the plan of the series. The necessary alterations and\r\nadditions have been made by Dr. Fotheringham, who has been scrupulous in\r\nretaining the expression of the late Warden's views, and, where\r\npossible, his words._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                              ADDINGTON.\r\n                                                                       PAGE\r\n\r\n   Mar., 1801.

He was\r\nable to retain the services of the Duke of Portland as home secretary,\r\nof Lord Chatham as president of the council, and of Lord Westmorland as\r\nlord privy seal. For the rest, his colleagues were, like himself, new to\r\ncabinet rank. Lord Hawkesbury (afterwards the second Earl of Liverpool)\r\nbecame foreign secretary, and Lord Hobart, son of the Earl of\r\nBuckinghamshire, secretary for war. Loughborough reaped the due reward\r\nof his treachery by being excluded from the ministry altogether; with a\r\ncurious obstinacy he persisted in attending cabinet councils, until a\r\nletter from Addington informed him that his presence was not desired. He\r\nreceived some small consolation, however, in his elevation to the\r\nEarldom of Rosslyn. Lord Eldon was the new chancellor and was destined\r\nto hold the office uninterruptedly, except for the brief ministry of Fox\r\nand Grenville, till 1827. Lord St. Vincent became first lord of the\r\nadmiralty, and Lord Lewisham president of the board of control.\r\nCornwallis had resigned with Pitt, but it was not till June 16 that a\r\nsuccessor was found for him as master general of the ordnance. It was\r\nthen arranged that Chatham should take this office. Portland succeeded\r\nChatham as lord president, and Lord Pelham, whose father had just been\r\ncreated Earl of Chichester, became home secretary instead of Portland.\r\nAn important change was introduced into the distribution of work between\r\nthe different secretaries of state, the administration of colonial\r\naffairs being transferred from the home to the war office, so that\r\nHobart and his successors down to 1854 were known as secretaries of\r\nstate for war and the colonies. Soon afterwards Lewisham succeeded his\r\nfather as Earl of Dartmouth.\r\n\r\nThough the Addington ministry has, not without justice, been derided for\r\nits weakness as compared with its immediate predecessor, it is\r\ninteresting to observe that in it one of the greatest of English judges\r\nas well as a future premier, destined to display an unique power of\r\nholding his party together, first attained to cabinet rank; and in the\r\nfollowing year it was reinforced by Castlereagh, who disputes with\r\nCanning the honour of being regarded as the ablest statesman of what was\r\nthen the younger generation. The weakness of the ministry must therefore\r\nbe attributed to a lack of experience rather than a lack of talent. It\r\nwas unfortunate in succeeding a particularly strong administration, but\r\nis well able to bear comparison with most of the later ministries of\r\nGeorge III. Addington himself was in more thorough sympathy with the\r\nking than any premier before or after. Conversation with Addington was,\r\naccording to the king, like \"thinking aloud\"; and with a king who, like\r\nGeorge III., still regarded himself as responsible for the national\r\npolicy, hearty co-operation between king and premier was a matter of no\r\nslight importance.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the new administration Pitt loyally kept his\r\npromise of friendly support, and it is to be deplored that Grenville and\r\nCanning did not adopt the same course. While the issue of peace and war\r\nwas pending, domestic legislation inevitably remained in abeyance. In\r\nIreland serious disappointment had been caused by the abandonment of\r\ncatholic emancipation; but the disappointment was borne quietly, and the\r\nIrish Roman catholics doubtless did not foresee to what a distance of\r\ntime the removal of their disabilities had been postponed. The just and\r\nmild rule of the new lord lieutenant, Lord Hardwicke, contributed to the\r\npacification of the country. But in reality the conduct of the movement\r\nfor emancipation was only passing into new hands; when it reappeared it\r\nwas no longer led by catholic lords and bishops, but was a peasant\r\nmovement, headed by the unscrupulous demagogue O'Connell. In these\r\ncircumstances it is to be regretted that the new administration\r\nneglected to carry that one of the half-promised concessions to the\r\ncatholics which could not offend the king's conscience, namely, the\r\ncommutation of tithe. Nothing in the protestant ascendency was so\r\nirritating to the catholic peasantry as the necessity of paying tithe to\r\na protestant clergy, and its commutation, while benefiting the clergy\r\nthemselves, would have removed the occasion of subsequent agitation. The\r\nspirit of disloyalty, however, was believed to be by no means extinct\r\neither in Ireland or in Great Britain, and two stringent acts were\r\npassed to repress it. The first, for the continuance of martial law in\r\nIreland, was supported by almost all the Irish speakers in the house of\r\ncommons, where it was carried without a division, and was adopted in the\r\nhouse of lords by an overwhelming majority, after an impressive speech\r\nfrom Lord Clare. The second, for the suspension of the _habeas corpus_\r\nact in the whole United Kingdom was framed to remain in force \"during\r\nthe continuance of the war, and for one month after the signing of a\r\ndefinitive treaty of peace\".\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE HORNE TOOKE ACT._]\r\n\r\nThe only other measure of permanent interest which became law in this\r\nsession was the so-called \"Horne Tooke act,\" occasioned by the return of\r\nHorne Tooke, who was in holy orders, for Old Sarum. Such a return was\r\ncontrary to custom, but the precedents collected by a committee of the\r\nhouse of commons were inconclusive. It was accordingly enacted that in\r\nfuture clergymen of the established churches should be ineligible for\r\nseats in parliament, while Horne Tooke was deemed to have been validly\r\nelected, and retained his seat. The house of commons found time,\r\nhowever, for an important and well-sustained debate on India, in which\r\namong others Dundas, now no longer in office, showed a thorough\r\nknowledge of questions affecting Indian finance and trade.\r\n\r\nThe naval expedition which had been prepared in the last days of Pitt's\r\nadministration sailed for Copenhagen on March 12, 1801, under Sir Hyde\r\nParker, with Nelson as second in command. The admiral in chief was of a\r\ncautious temper, but was wise enough to allow himself to be guided by\r\nNelson's judgment when planning an engagement, though not as to the\r\ngeneral course of the expedition. The fleet consisted of sixteen ships\r\nof the line and thirty-four smaller vessels; all these with the\r\nexception of one ship of the line reached the Skaw on the 18th. A\r\nfrigate was sent in advance with instructions to Vansittart, the\r\nBritish envoy at Copenhagen, to present an ultimatum to the Danish\r\ngovernment,[1] demanding a favourable answer to the British demands\r\nwithin forty-eight hours. For three days Parker waited at anchor\r\neighteen miles from Elsinore, and it was only when Vansittart brought an\r\nunfavourable reply on the 23rd that he took Nelson into his counsels. He\r\nreadily adopted Nelson's plan of ignoring the Danish batteries at\r\nKronborg and making a circuit so as to attack Copenhagen at the weak\r\nsouthern end of its defences, but set aside his project of masking\r\nCopenhagen and making straight for a Russian squadron of twelve ships of\r\nthe line which was lying icebound at Revel. The fair weather of the 26th\r\nwas wasted in irresolution, and it was not till the 30th that the fleet\r\nwas able to weigh anchor. It passed Kronborg in safety and anchored five\r\nmiles north of Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nParker placed under Nelson's immediate command twelve ships of the line\r\nand twenty-one smaller vessels, by far the greater part of the British\r\nfleet. With these he was to pass to the east of a shoal called the\r\nMiddle Ground and attack the defences of Copenhagen from the south,\r\nwhile Parker with the remainder of the fleet was to make a demonstration\r\nagainst the more formidable northern defences. The wind could not of\r\ncourse favour both attacks simultaneously, and it was agreed that the\r\nattack should be made when the wind favoured Nelson. The nights of the\r\n30th and 31st were spent in reconnoitring and laying buoys. On April 1 a\r\nnorth wind brought Nelson's squadron past the Middle Ground, and on the\r\nnext day a south wind enabled him to attack the Danish fleet, if fleet\r\nit may be called. At the north end of the Danish position stood the only\r\npermanent battery, the Trekroner, with two hulks or blockships; the rest\r\nconsisted of seven blockships and eleven floating batteries, drawn up\r\nalong the shore. An attack on the south end of the line was also exposed\r\nto batteries on the island of Amager. Nelson's intention was to close\r\nwith the whole Danish fleet, but three of his ships of the line were\r\nstranded and he was obliged to leave the assault on the northern end\r\nentirely to lighter vessels.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _BATTLE OF THE BALTIC._]\r\n\r\nThe Danish batteries proved more powerful than had been anticipated, and\r\nas time went on and the Danish resistance did not appear to lose in\r\nstrength, Parker grew doubtful of the result of the battle and gave the\r\norder to cease action. The order was apparently not intended to be\r\nimperative, but it had the effect of inducing Riou, who commanded the\r\nfrigate squadron, to sail away to the north. For the rest of the fleet\r\nobedience was out of the question. Nelson acknowledged, but refused to\r\nrepeat the order, and, jocularly placing his glass to his blind eye,\r\ndeclared that he could not see the signal. At length the British\r\ncannonade told. Fischer, the Danish commander, had had to shift his flag\r\ntwice, at the second time to the Trekroner, and all the ships south of\r\nthat battery had either ceased fire or were practically helpless. The\r\nTrekroner, however, was still unsubdued and rendered it impossible for\r\nNelson's squadron to retire, in the only direction which the wind would\r\nallow, without severe loss. He accordingly sent a message to the Danish\r\nPrince Regent, declaring that he would be compelled to burn the\r\nbatteries he had taken, without saving their crews, unless firing\r\nceased. If a truce were arranged until he could take his prisoners out\r\nof the prizes, he was prepared to land the wounded Danes, and burn or\r\nremove the prizes. A truce for twenty-four hours was accordingly\r\narranged, which Nelson employed to remove his own fleet unmolested.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the southern batteries left Copenhagen exposed to\r\nbombardment, and the Danes, unable to resist, yet afraid to offend the\r\ntsar by submission, prolonged the time from day to day till news arrived\r\nwhich removed all occasion for hostility. Unknown to either of the\r\ncombatants, the Tsar Paul, the life and soul of the northern\r\nconfederacy, had been murdered on the night of March 23, ten days before\r\nthe battle, and with his death the league was practically dissolved.\r\nWhen Nelson advanced further into the Baltic, he found no hostile fleet\r\nawaiting him, and the new tsar, Alexander, adopting an opposite policy,\r\nentered into a compromise on the subject of maritime rights. The battle\r\nof the Baltic is considered by some to have been Nelson's masterpiece.\r\nIt won for him the title of viscount and for his second in command,\r\nRear-Admiral Graves, the gift of the ribbon of the Bath, but the\r\nadmiralty, for official reasons, declined to confer any public reward\r\nor honour on the officers concerned in it.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the French occupation of Egypt was drawing towards its\r\ninevitable close. Kléber, who was left in command by Bonaparte, perished\r\nby the hand of an assassin, and Menou, who succeeded to the command, was\r\nnot only a weak general, but was prevented from receiving any\r\nreinforcements by the naval supremacy of Great Britain in the\r\nMediterranean. On March 21, 1801, the French army was defeated at the\r\nbattle of Alexandria by the British force sent out under Sir Ralph\r\nAbercromby, who was himself mortally wounded on the field. His\r\nsuccessor, General Hutchinson, completed his work by taking Cairo,\r\nbefore the arrival of General Baird, who had led a mixed body of British\r\nsoldiers and sepoys from the Red Sea across the desert to the Nile. The\r\ncapitulation of Alexandria soon followed. In September the French\r\nevacuated Egypt, the remains of their army were conveyed to France in\r\nEnglish ships, and Bonaparte's long-cherished dreams of eastern conquest\r\nfaded away for ever--not from his own imagination, but from the\r\ncalculations of practical statesmanship.\r\n\r\nFrench arms, and French diplomacy supported by armed force, were more\r\nsuccessful elsewhere. The treaty of Lunéville was only the first of a\r\nseries of treaties, by which France secured to herself a political\r\nposition commensurate with her military glory. By the treaty of Aranjuez\r\nbetween France and Spain, signed on March 21, Spain ceded Louisiana to\r\nFrance, reserving the right of pre-emption, and undertook to wage war on\r\nPortugal in order to detach it from the British alliance. Spain and\r\nPortugal were both lukewarm in this war, and on June 6 signed the treaty\r\nof Badajoz, by which Portugal agreed to close her ports to England, to\r\npay an indemnity to Spain, and to cede the small district of Olivenza,\r\nsouth of Badajoz. Bonaparte was intensely irritated by this treaty,\r\nwhich deprived him of the hope of exchanging conquests in Portugal for\r\nBritish colonial conquests in any future negotiations; he declared that\r\nSpain would have to pay by the sacrifice of her colonies for the\r\nconquered French colonies which he still hoped to recover. A French army\r\nwas despatched to Portugal and enabled Bonaparte to dictate the treaty\r\nof Madrid, signed on September 29, whereby Portugal ceded half Guiana to\r\nFrance and undertook, as at Badajoz, to close her ports against\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _INFLUENCES MAKING FOR PEACE._]\r\n\r\nThis last condition was equally imposed on the King of the Two Sicilies\r\nby the treaty of Florence, concluded on March 28, and before the end of\r\nthe year France had established friendly relations with the Sultan of\r\nTurkey and the new Tsar of Russia. More important still, as\r\nconsolidating Bonaparte's power at home, was the concordat signed by him\r\nand the pope on July 15 recognising Roman Catholicism as the religion of\r\nthe majority of Frenchmen, and of the consuls, guaranteeing stipends,\r\nthough on an abjectly mean scale, to the clergy, and placing the entire\r\npatronage of the French Church in the hands of the first consul. Never\r\nsince the French revolution had the Church been thus acknowledged as the\r\nauxiliary, or rather as the handmaid, of the state, and probably no one\r\nbut the first consul could have brought about the reconciliation. After\r\nsuch exertions, even he may have sincerely desired an honourable peace,\r\nas the crown of his victories, or at least as a breathing time, to\r\nenable him to mature his vast designs for reorganising France. Perhaps\r\nhe did not yet fully recognise that war was a necessity of his political\r\nascendency, no less than of his own personal character. The French\r\npeople still clung to republican institutions; and the consulate was a\r\nnominal republic, with all effective power vested in the first consul.\r\nTime was to show how largely this unique position depended on his unique\r\ncapacity of conducting wars glorious to French arms; for the present,\r\nFrance was satisfied, and longed for peace.\r\n\r\nThe English ministry, too, was impelled by strong motives to enter upon\r\nthe negotiations which resulted in the peace of Amiens. Not only was\r\nGreat Britain crippled by the loss of nearly all her allies, but the\r\nhigh price of bread had roused grave disaffection,[2] and intensified\r\namong British merchants a desire for an unmolested extension of\r\ncommerce; above all, English statesmen now recognised the consulate,\r\nunder Bonaparte, as the first stable and non-revolutionary government\r\nsince the fall of the French monarchy. Both countries, therefore, were\r\npredisposed to entertain pacific overtures, but the very fact that these\r\nwere in contemplation stirred both sides to further endeavours in order\r\nto secure better terms of peace. A French squadron, commanded by Admiral\r\nLinois and containing three ships of the line besides smaller boats, was\r\nmaking a movement for the Straits of Gibraltar in order to strengthen\r\nthe force at Cadiz. Sir James Saumarez with five ships of the line and\r\ntwo smaller vessels engaged Linois off Algeciras on July 5, but the\r\nFrench ships were supported by the land batteries, and one of the\r\nBritish ships, the _Hannibal_ (74), ran aground, and Saumarez was\r\neventually compelled to leave her in the hands of the enemy. This\r\nvictory was hailed with delight throughout France, but it was fully\r\nretrieved a week later. The French squadron had in the meantime been\r\nreinforced by one French and five Spanish ships of the line, and on the\r\n12th it made a fresh attempt to reach Cadiz; it was, however, engaged in\r\nthe Straits by Saumarez with five ships of the line. In the ensuing\r\nbattle two Spanish ships blew up, and the French _Saint Antoine_ was\r\ncaptured. The remainder succeeded in reaching Cadiz, but Saumarez was\r\nable to resume the blockade a few weeks later.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there was no relaxation of French preparations for an invasion\r\nof England, or of naval activity on the part of Great Britain. No sooner\r\nhad Nelson returned from the Baltic than he was, on July 24, placed in\r\ncommand of a \"squadron on a particular service,\" charged with the\r\ndefence of the coast from Beachy Head to Orfordness. With this he not\r\nonly blockaded the northern French ports, but assumed the aggressive,\r\nand bombarded the vessels therein collected. A more daring attempt to\r\ncut out the flotilla moored at Boulogne by a boat attack was repelled\r\nwith some loss on the night of August 15. But couriers under flags of\r\ntruce were already passing between London and Paris, and hostilities\r\nceased in the autumn of the year 1801.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE QUESTION OF MALTA._]\r\n\r\nThe history of the negotiations which ended in the peace of Amiens\r\nderives a special interest from the events which followed it. The\r\nearliest overtures for peace were made by Hawkesbury on March 21, 1801.\r\nAt first Bonaparte refused to listen to them, but the destruction of the\r\nnorthern confederacy inclined him to more pacific counsels. On April 14\r\nthe British government stated its demands. They mark a distinct advance\r\non those which had been made in vain at Lille in 1797. France was to\r\nevacuate Egypt, and Great Britain Minorca, but Great Britain claimed to\r\nretain Malta, Tobago, Martinique, Trinidad, Essequibo, Demerara,\r\nBerbice, and Ceylon. She was willing to surrender the Cape of Good Hope\r\non condition that it became a free port, and stipulated that an\r\nindemnity should be provided for the Prince of Orange. At the outset,\r\nBonaparte opposed all cessions by France and her allies, but the steady\r\nimprovement in the fortunes of England in the north and in Egypt at last\r\ndetermined him to grant some of the British demands, and as the\r\nevacuation of Egypt became inevitable, he was resolved to gain something\r\nin exchange for it before it was too late. The preliminary treaty was\r\naccordingly signed by Bonaparte's agent Otto on behalf of France and\r\nHawkesbury on behalf of Great Britain on October 1, the day before the\r\nnews of the French capitulation in Egypt reached England. Great Britain\r\nhad already consented to relinquish Malta, provided that it became\r\nindependent. She now consented to relinquish all her conquests from\r\nFrance, and with the exception of Ceylon and Trinidad all her conquests\r\nfrom the French allies, requiring, however, that the Cape should be\r\nrecognised as a free port. The French were to evacuate not only Egypt,\r\nbut the Neapolitan and Roman States. Malta was to be restored to the\r\nknights of St. John under the guarantee of a third power. Prisoners of\r\nwar were to be released on payment of their debts, and the question of\r\nthe charge for their maintenance was to be settled by the definitive\r\ntreaty in accordance with the law of nations and established usage.\r\n\r\nNo mention was made of the Prince of Orange, but Otto gave a verbal\r\nassurance that provision would be made to satisfy his claims. He also\r\ngave the British government to understand that France would be willing\r\nto cede Tobago in consideration of the expenses incurred in the\r\nmaintenance of French and Dutch prisoners. The omission of all reference\r\nto the continental relations of France is conspicuous. In France it was\r\ninterpreted as indicating that Great Britain renounced her interest in\r\ncontinental politics. The Batavian, Helvetian, Cisalpine, and Ligurian\r\nrepublics, the kingdom of Etruria, and the whole east bank of the Rhine\r\nwere, however, supposed to be already protected against French\r\nencroachment by the treaty of Lunéville, and Great Britain had no wish\r\nto impose terms involving a recognition of these new creations. Again,\r\nno mention was made of commercial relations apart from the Newfoundland\r\nand St. Lawrence fisheries, for Great Britain was too ready to believe\r\nthat a separate commercial treaty would be practicable, and was\r\nnaturally loth to delay the conclusion of peace by a difficult\r\nnegotiation.\r\n\r\nCornwallis was appointed to negotiate the definitive treaty, and had\r\nsome hope that he might arrive at an informal understanding with\r\nBonaparte at Paris before he proceeded to Amiens. But he was offended by\r\nBonaparte's manner, and, dreading to be pitted against so subtle a\r\ndiplomatist as Talleyrand, he left Paris before anything was\r\naccomplished, and arrived at Amiens on November 30. There France was\r\nrepresented by Joseph Bonaparte, the first consul's elder brother, and\r\nthe negotiator of Lunéville. At Amiens, the position of the British\r\ngovernment was compromised from the first by its renewed insistence on a\r\npoint which had been omitted from the preliminary treaty, namely, the\r\ncompensation of the Prince of Orange. This demand was accompanied by an\r\nendeavour to obtain compensation for the King of Sardinia. Joseph\r\nBonaparte, on the other hand, entrenched himself behind the letter of\r\nthe treaty, and acknowledged no further obligation. Any additional\r\nconcession to Great Britain could only be purchased by British\r\nconcessions to France. Other difficulties arose over the question of\r\nMalta, the payment for the maintenance of prisoners, and the inclusion\r\nof allies as parties to the treaty.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _CORNWALLIS AT AMIENS._]\r\n\r\nOn the first of these questions the French would appear to have aimed\r\nthroughout at reducing the knights to as impotent a position as\r\npossible. The British, on the other hand, ostensibly desiring to see the\r\nstrength of the order maintained, were chiefly interested in securing\r\nits neutrality. At the time of the signature of the preliminary treaty,\r\nRussia was the power that seemed to Great Britain the fittest guarantor\r\nof the independence of the knights. On the refusal of Russia to accept\r\nthis position, Naples appeared to be the next best alternative, but it\r\nwas eventually agreed to substitute for the guarantee of a third power\r\nthe obviously futile guarantee of all the powers. Neither party foresaw\r\nthat the impossibility of obtaining such a guarantee was destined to\r\nleave the whole clause about Malta inoperative. After much dispute over\r\nthe future constitution of the order, France proposed to obviate the\r\nchief source of difficulty by the demolition of the forts. This plan\r\ncommended itself to Cornwallis, but was rejected by the British\r\ngovernment. By the end of December it was agreed that a Neapolitan\r\ngarrison was to occupy the islands provisionally, until the new\r\norganisation should be established. Great Britain proposed that this\r\ngarrison should be maintained at the joint expense of Great Britain and\r\nFrance. It did not occur to the British government to propose any\r\nguarantee for the preservation of the property of the order, and this\r\nomission ultimately proved material. The question of including allies in\r\nthe treaty was less complicated. France preferred a number of separate\r\ntreaties so as to keep the British interest in Europe at a minimum.\r\nGreat Britain, on the other hand, wished to make France a party to the\r\ncessions made by her allies, and successfully insisted on the\r\nnegotiation of a single comprehensive treaty. Joseph Bonaparte granted\r\nthis point on December 11, but, as he had not full powers to negotiate\r\nwith any power except Great Britain, he continued to interpose delays\r\ntill the end of the year.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime France had failed in her attempts to meet the British\r\nclaims on behalf of the Prince of Orange by demands for further\r\nprivileges and territory in the oceans and colonies. On the whole, the\r\nfirst month's negotiations had contributed much to a settlement, without\r\ngiving a decided advantage to either side. The lapse of time, however,\r\nturned the balance in favour of the negotiator who was the more\r\nindependent of his country's desire for peace. On January 1, 1802,\r\nHawkesbury wrote to Cornwallis, treating the acquisition of Tobago as\r\nunimportant; on the 2nd Addington expressed his readiness to accept a\r\nseparate arrangement with the Batavian republic for the Prince of\r\nOrange. By the 16th Hawkesbury had yielded the claim of Portugal to be a\r\nparty to the treaty. The refusal of the French to cede Tobago in lieu of\r\npayment for the French prisoners, and the difficulty of assessing the\r\npayment, opened a way to the evasion of compensation altogether.\r\nCornwallis, preferring to sacrifice this claim rather than re-open the\r\nwar, suggested to Joseph Bonaparte on the 22nd that the treaty should\r\nprovide for commissioners to assess the payment, while it should be\r\nsecretly provided that they should not be appointed. On the same day,\r\nJoseph Bonaparte communicated his brother's consent to a clause engaging\r\nFrance to find a suitable territorial possession in Germany for the\r\nPrince of Orange.\r\n\r\nIf Hawkesbury and Cornwallis imagined that they had made sure of an\r\nearly peace by these extensive concessions, they were greatly mistaken.\r\nNapoleon, flushed with this unexpected success, was encouraged to make\r\nfurther trial of the pliability of the British diplomatists. Two events\r\noccurred at this stage of the negotiations which tried the temper of\r\nboth sides to the uttermost. On January 26, Bonaparte was elected\r\npresident of the Cisalpine republic, to be styled henceforth the Italian\r\nrepublic. This event seems to have taken the British government by\r\nsurprise; they thought it a distinct indication that he still\r\ncontemplated further aggressions in spite of the series of treaties by\r\nwhich he appeared to be securing peace, and were therefore much less\r\ninclined than formerly to make concessions. About the same time\r\nBonaparte was not unreasonably enraged at the outrageous attacks made on\r\nhim in the press conducted in London by French exiles, especially by\r\nJean Peltier, the editor of a paper called _L'Ambigu_, and he blamed the\r\nBritish government for permitting their publication. He therefore\r\ninstructed his brother Joseph to raise further difficulties over the\r\ngarrison and permanent organisation of Malta, as well as over the\r\nproposed accession of the sultan to the treaty. Vain attempts were also\r\nmade by Joseph to retain Otranto for France till the British should have\r\nevacuated Malta, and to secure the inclusion of the Ligurian republic in\r\nthe treaty.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE TREATY OF AMIENS._]\r\n\r\nAt last on March 8 Napoleon agreed that no important difference\r\nremained, and urged his brother to conclude the treaty. A little more\r\ntime was wasted in providing for a temporary occupation of Malta by\r\nNeapolitan troops, and a more marked division of opinion arose as to the\r\ncompensation for the Prince of Orange. In spite of instructions to the\r\ncontrary from Hawkesbury, Cornwallis accepted an engagement on the part\r\nof France to find a compensation, not defined, for the house of Nassau,\r\ninstead of charging it on the Dutch government; and the treaty was\r\nfinally concluded on March 25. It was signed by Great Britain, France,\r\nSpain, and the Batavian republic, while the Porte was admitted as an\r\naccessory power. It differed from the preliminary convention in no\r\nimportant respect, except in the illusory safeguards for the claims of\r\nthe Prince of Orange, the secret arrangement for evading the cost of the\r\nFrench prisoners, and the provisions concerning Malta, pregnant with the\r\nseeds of future enmity. These provisions were as follows: Malta was to\r\nbe restored to the knights of St. John, from whose order both French and\r\nBritish were hereafter to be excluded. The evacuation was to take place\r\nwithin three months of the ratification of the treaty, or sooner if\r\npossible. At that date Malta was to be given up, provided the grand\r\nmaster or commissaries of the order were present, and provided the\r\nNeapolitan garrison had arrived. Its independence was to be under the\r\nguarantee of France, Great Britain, Austria, Spain, Russia, and Prussia.\r\nTwo thousand Neapolitan troops were to occupy it for one year, and until\r\nthe order should have raised a force sufficient, in the judgment of the\r\nguaranteeing powers, for the defence of the islands.[3]\r\n\r\nOn October 29, 1801, parliament was opened with a speech from the throne\r\nbriefly announcing the conclusion of a convention with the northern\r\npowers, and of preliminaries of peace with the French republic. General\r\nLauriston, bearing the ratification of the preliminaries by the first\r\nconsul, had reached London on the 10th, when he was received by the\r\npopulace with tumultuous demonstrations of joy. Soon afterwards the\r\n\"feast of the peace\" was celebrated in Paris with equal enthusiasm.\r\nShort-lived as they proved to be, these pacific sentiments were\r\ndoubtless genuine on both sides of the channel. The industrial, though\r\nnot the military, resources of France were exhausted by her prodigious\r\nefforts during the last eight years; while England, suffering grievously\r\nfrom distress among the working-classes and financial difficulties,\r\nwelcomed the prospect of cheaper provisions and easier times, as well as\r\nof emerging from the political difficulties originating in the French\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary treaty, however, did not escape hostile criticism in\r\neither house of parliament. It was the subject of discussion in the\r\nlords on November 3, and in the commons on the 3rd and 4th. Its most\r\nstrenuous assailants were Lord Grenville, who had been foreign secretary\r\nunder Pitt, and the whigs who had joined Pitt's ministry in 1794, among\r\nwhom Lords Spencer and Fitzwilliam and above all Windham call for\r\nspecial notice. Windham's powerful and comprehensive speech contained\r\nmore than one shrewd forecast of the future. For once, Pitt and Fox\r\nsupported the same measure, and Pitt, dwelling on _security_ as our\r\ngrand object in the war, specially deprecated any attempt on the part of\r\nGreat Britain \"to settle the affairs of the continent\". Fox, in\r\nadvocating peace, fiercely denounced the war against the French\r\nrepublic, and gloated over the discomfiture of the Bourbons.[4] It was\r\nadmitted on all sides that France was stronger than ever in a military\r\nand political sense. She had already made treaties with Austria, Naples,\r\nSpain, and Portugal; other treaties with Russia and Turkey were on the\r\npoint of being signed; while the still more important concordat with the\r\npope was already ratified. On the other hand, Great Britain had largely\r\nincreased her colonial possessions, and the chief question now discussed\r\nwas whether she would be the weaker for abandoning some of these recent\r\nconquests. The general feeling of the nation was fitly expressed by\r\nSheridan in the phrase: \"This is a peace which all men are glad of, but\r\nno man can be proud of\". Malmesbury, the negotiator of Lille, was absent\r\nfrom the debates; but he has recorded in his diary his disapproval both\r\nof the peace and of the violent opposition to it The king told\r\nMalmesbury on November 26 that he considered it an experimental peace,\r\nbut unavoidable.[5]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _DEBATES ON TREATY OF AMIENS._]\r\n\r\nThe debates on the definitive treaty of Amiens took place on May 13 and\r\n14, 1802, and though vigorously sustained, were to some extent a\r\nrepetition of those on the preliminaries of peace. The opposition to it\r\nwas headed by Grenville in the lords and in the commons by Windham, who\r\ncompared it unfavourably with the preliminaries; and the stipulations\r\nwith respect to Malta were justly criticised as one of its weakest\r\npoints. Strange to say, Pitt took no effective part in the discussion,\r\nwhich ended in overwhelming majorities for the government. As in the\r\nprevious session, domestic affairs, except in their bearing on foreign\r\npolicy, received comparatively little attention from parliament. The\r\nincome tax was repealed, almost in silence, as the first fruits of\r\npeace, and Addington, as chancellor of the exchequer, delivered an\r\nemphatic eulogy on the sinking fund by means of which he calculated that\r\nin forty-five years the national debt, then amounting to £500,000,000,\r\nmight be entirely paid off. The house of commons showed no want of\r\neconomical zeal in scrutinising the claims of the king on the civil\r\nlist, and those of the Prince of Wales on the revenues of the duchy of\r\nCornwall. Nor did it neglect such abuses as the non-residence of the\r\nparochial clergy, and the cruel practice of bull-baiting, though it\r\nrejected a bill for the suppression of this practice, after a\r\ncharacteristic apology for it from Windham, in which he dwelt upon its\r\nsuperiority to horse-racing. In this session, too, a grant of £10,000\r\nwas voted to Jenner for his recent invention of vaccination. In\r\nsupporting it, Wilberforce stated that the victims of small-pox, in\r\nLondon alone, numbered 4,000 annually.\r\n\r\nThe parliament, which had now lasted six years, was dissolved by the\r\nking in person on June 28, and a general election was held during the\r\nmonth of July. The new house of commons did not differ materially from\r\nthe old, and even in Ireland the recent national opposition to the union\r\ndid not lead to the unseating of a single member who had voted for\r\nit.[6] Meanwhile the ministry was strengthened by the admission to\r\noffice of Lord Castlereagh, already distinguished for his share in the\r\nnegotiations precedent to the union with Ireland. On July 6 he was\r\nappointed president of the board of control in succession to Dartmouth,\r\nand was admitted to a seat in the cabinet in October. The new parliament\r\ndid not meet till November 16. During the interval members of both\r\nhouses, with vast numbers of their countrymen, flocked to Paris, which\r\nhad been almost closed to English travellers since the early days of the\r\nrevolution. Fox was presented to Napoleon, as Bonaparte, since the\r\ndecree which made him consul for life, preferred to be styled. Napoleon\r\nconceived a great admiration for him, and afterwards persuaded himself\r\nthat, had Fox survived, the friendly relations of England and France\r\nwould not have been permanently interrupted. On the very day on which\r\nparliament assembled, a conspiracy was discovered, which, however insane\r\nit may now appear, attracted much attention at the time. A certain\r\nColonel Despard with thirty-six followers, mainly labourers, had plotted\r\nto kill the king and seize all the government-buildings, with a view to\r\nthe establishment of what he called the \"constitutional independence of\r\nIreland and Great Britain\" and the \"equalisation of all civic rights\".\r\nThe conspiracy had no wide ramifications, and the arrest of its leader\r\nand his companions brought it to an immediate end. Despard was found\r\nguilty of high treason and was executed on February 21, 1803.\r\n\r\nWhen parliament met, the king's speech referred ominously to fresh\r\ndisturbances in the balance of power on the continent; and votes were\r\npassed for large additions to the army and navy, in spite of Fox's\r\ndeclaration that he saw no reason why Napoleon, satisfied with military\r\nglory, should not henceforth devote himself to internal improvements in\r\nFrance. Nelson, on the contrary, speaking in the house of lords, while\r\nhe professed himself a man of peace, insisted on the danger arising from\r\n\"a restless and unjust ambition on the part of our neighbours,\" and\r\nSheridan delivered a vigorous speech in a like spirit. On the whole, in\r\nJanuary, 1803, the prospects of assured peace and prosperity were much\r\ngloomier than they had been in January, 1802, before the treaty of\r\nAmiens. The funds were going down, the bank restriction act was renewed,\r\nand Despard's conspiracy still agitated the public mind. In the month of\r\nFebruary a strong anti-Gallican sentiment was roused by Mackintosh's\r\npowerful defence of the royalist Jean Peltier, accused and ultimately\r\nconvicted of a gross libel on the first consul. On March 8 came the\r\nroyal message calling out the militia, which heralded the rupture of the\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThe renewal of the war, fraught with so much glory and misery to both\r\nnations, can have taken neither by surprise. The ink was scarcely dry on\r\nthe treaty of Amiens when fresh causes of discord sprung up between\r\nFrance and Great Britain. More than one of these, indeed, had arisen\r\nbetween the signature of the preliminary convention and the actual\r\nconclusion of peace. During the negotiations, the first consul had, as\r\nwe have seen, never ceased to protest against the violent attacks upon\r\nhimself in the English press, while Cornwallis persistently warned his\r\nown government against the menacing attitude of France in Italy and\r\nelsewhere. The proclamation of the concordat in April, 1802, and the\r\nrecognition of Napoleon as first consul for life in August, however they\r\nmay have strengthened his position in France, were no legitimate\r\nsubjects for resentment in England; but his acceptance of the presidency\r\nof the \"Italian\" republic in January, followed by his annexation of\r\nPiedmont in September, revived in all its intensity the British mistrust\r\nof his aggressive policy.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _FRENCH AGGRESSIONS._]\r\n\r\nThe month of October witnessed a renewed aggression on Switzerland. A\r\nFrench army, commanded by Ney, advanced into the interior of the\r\ncountry, and forced the Swiss, who were in the midst of a civil war, to\r\naccept the mediation of Napoleon. The new constitution which he framed\r\nattempted, by weakening the federal government, to place the direction\r\nof Helvetian external relations in the hands of the French first consul.\r\nOur government vainly endeavoured to resist this interference by sending\r\nagents with money and promises. In Germany the redistribution of\r\nterritory necessitated by the peace of Lunéville was carried out\r\nprofessedly under the joint mediation of France and Russia, but really\r\nat the dictation of Napoleon. The final project, which destroyed all\r\nexcept three of the spiritual principalities and all except six of the\r\nfree cities, was proposed by France on February 23, 1803, and accepted\r\nby the Emperor Francis on April 27.\r\n\r\nAgainst these rearrangements, Great Britain could have nothing to say;\r\ntheir importance is that while the negotiations were pending, Austria,\r\nPrussia, and Russia all had a strong motive for standing well with\r\nFrance. Bonaparte's attitude towards Switzerland was, in so far as it\r\nwas backed by force, an infringement of the treaty of Lunéville, to\r\nwhich, however, Great Britain was not a party. The neutrality of\r\nPiedmont had not been safeguarded either at Lunéville or at Amiens; it\r\nhad already been occupied by France before the treaty was signed, and\r\nNapoleon claimed to have as much right to annex territory in Europe\r\nwithout the consent of Great Britain as Great Britain had to annex\r\nterritory in India without the consent of France.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's schemes of colonial expansion, though equally within the\r\nletter of the treaty, were not less disconcerting. The reconquest of San\r\nDomingo appeared necessary in order to obtain a base for the effective\r\noccupation of the new French possession, Louisiana. The despatch of an\r\nexpedition for this purpose in December, 1801, had excited grave\r\nsuspicion, and when two-thirds of the army had died of yellow fever and\r\nthe remainder had returned home, fresh troops were sent out to take\r\ntheir place. A new naval expedition was prepared in the Dutch port of\r\nHelvoetsluis, but it was impossible to persuade British public opinion\r\nthat its real destination was San Domingo. Finally, on the eve of\r\nhostilities, in the spring of 1803 Napoleon, despairing of advance in\r\nthis direction and disregarding the Spanish right of pre-emption, sold\r\nLouisiana to the United States for 80,000,000 francs. Still more\r\nembarrassing was Bonaparte's eastern policy. In September, 1802, Colonel\r\nSébastiani was sent as \"commercial agent\" to the Levant. He was\r\ninstructed to inspect the condition of ports and arsenals, to assure the\r\nsheykhs of French favour, and to report on the military resources of\r\nSyria, Egypt, and the north African coast. His report, which was\r\npublished in the _Moniteur_ of January 30, 1803, set forth the\r\nopportunities that France would possess in the event of an immediate\r\nreturn to hostilities, and was naturally interpreted as disclosing an\r\nintention to renew the war on the first opportunity. Six thousand French\r\nwould, he said, be enough to reconquer Egypt; the country was in favour\r\nof France. In March, 1803, Decaen left France with open instructions to\r\nreceive the surrender of the five towns in India restored to France, but\r\nwith secret orders to invite the alliance of Indian sovereigns opposed\r\nto Great Britain. On his appearance at Pondicherri, the British\r\ncommander prepared to seize him, but he escaped to the Mauritius, which\r\nhe put in a state of defence, and made a basis for attacks on British\r\ncommerce which lasted from 1803 to 1811.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _CAUSES OF MISTRUST AFTER AMIENS._]\r\n\r\nIreland also was visited by political spies, passing as commercial\r\nagents. It may not be easy to say how far Emmet's rebellion, to be\r\nrecorded hereafter, was the result of these visits. At all events a\r\nletter fell into the hands of the British government, addressed by\r\nTalleyrand to a French agent at Dublin, called Fauvelet, directing him\r\nto obtain answers to a series of questions about the military and naval\r\ncircumstances of the district, and \"to procure a plan of the ports, with\r\nthe soundings and moorings, and to state the draught of water, and the\r\nwind best suited for ingress and egress\". The British government\r\nnaturally complained of these instructions, but Talleyrand persistently\r\nmaintained that they were of a purely commercial character.[7] It is, of\r\ncourse, true that these preparations in view of a possible recurrence of\r\nhostilities, however obvious their intention, were not in themselves\r\nhostile acts. Still, they were just grounds for suspicion, and, with our\r\nretrospective knowledge of Napoleon's later career, we may seek in vain\r\nfor the grounds of confidence which had made the conclusion of a treaty\r\npossible. Great Britain was guilty of more direct breaches of the peace\r\nof Amiens. Russia refused her guarantee for the independence of Malta,\r\nand the British government was therefore technically justified in\r\nretaining it. No similar justification could, however, be alleged for\r\nthe retention of Alexandria and the French towns in India. These\r\nmeasures were, as will be seen, defended on broader grounds of public\r\npolicy. Not the least of the causes of discontent with the new situation\r\nwas the refusal of Napoleon to follow up the treaty of peace with a\r\ncommercial treaty. He had even retained French troops in Holland, and\r\nthus shown that he meant to close its ports against British commerce.\r\nThe hope of a renewal of trade with France had been a main cause of the\r\npopular desire for peace, and had reconciled the British public to the\r\nsacrifices with which the treaty of Amiens had been purchased. It soon\r\nbecame clear that further concessions would be made the price of a\r\ncommercial treaty, and it was felt in consequence that the sacrifices\r\nalready made were made in vain.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1802, Lord Whitworth was sent as ambassador extraordinary\r\nto the French Republic. The instructions which he carried with him from\r\nHawkesbury fully reflect the prevailing spirit of mistrust. He was to\r\nwatch for any new leagues which might prejudice England or disturb\r\nEurope; he was to discover any secret designs that might be formed\r\nagainst the East or West Indies; he was to maintain the closest\r\nsurveillance over the internal politics of France, but especially over\r\nthe dispositions of influential personages in the confidence of the\r\nfirst consul, as well as over the financial resources and armaments of\r\nthe republic.[8] Two months later, he was expressly warned in a secret\r\ndespatch not in any way to commit His Majesty to a restoration of Malta,\r\neven if the provisions made at Amiens for this purpose could be\r\ncompletely executed; and the principle was laid down, from which the\r\nBritish government never swerved, that Great Britain was entitled to\r\ncompensation for any acquisitions made by France since the treaty was\r\nsigned. Accordingly, the retention of Malta was justified as a\r\ncounterpoise to French extensions of territory in Italy, the invasion of\r\nSwitzerland, and the continued occupation of the Batavian republic.[9]\r\nThis resolution was naturally confirmed by the publication of\r\nSébastiani's report.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _NAPOLEON AND WHITWORTH._]\r\n\r\nThe long negotiations between Whitworth and the French government,\r\nduring the winter of 1802 and the spring of 1803, only bring into\r\nstronger relief the importance of the issues thus raised, and the\r\nhopelessness of a pacific solution. Napoleon firmly took his stand\r\nthroughout on the simple letter of the treaty, which pledged Great\r\nBritain, upon certain conditions, to place the knights of St. John in\r\npossession of Malta, but did not contemplate the case of further\r\naccessions of French territory on the continent. Although the conditions\r\nspecified were never fully satisfied, it is abundantly clear that the\r\nBritish ministers, having at last grasped the value of Malta, created\r\nall the difficulties in their power, and determined to cancel this\r\narticle of the treaty. They alleged, in self-defence, that the spirit of\r\nthe treaty had been constantly violated by Napoleon, in repeated acts of\r\nhostility to British subjects, in the refusal of all redress for such\r\ngrievances, and, above all, in that series of aggressions on the\r\ncontinent which he declared to be outside the treaty and beyond the\r\nprovince of Great Britain.[10] None of the compromises laboriously\r\ndiscussed in the winter of 1802 betoken any desire on the part of\r\neither government to retreat from its main position, though it does not\r\nfollow that either sought to bring about a renewal of the war. Whitworth\r\nconstantly reported that no formidable armaments were being prepared,\r\nand clung for months to a belief that Napoleon, knowing the instability\r\nof his own power and the ruinous state of his finances, would ultimately\r\ngive way. On the other hand, Talleyrand and Joseph Bonaparte never\r\nceased to hope that Great Britain would make concessions which might be\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\nSuch hopes were rudely dispelled by the king's message to parliament on\r\nMarch 8, 1803, complaining of aggressive preparations in the ports of\r\nFrance and Holland, and recommending immediate measures for the security\r\nof his dominions. This message, with the consequent embodiment of the\r\nmilitia, startled the whole continent, and was followed five days later\r\nby the famous scene in which the first consul addressed Whitworth in\r\nphrases little short of insult. During a public audience at the\r\nTuileries on the 13th, Napoleon, after inquiring whether the British\r\nambassador had received any news from home, broke out with the words:\r\n\"And so you are determined to go to war\". The altercation which ensued\r\nis best told in Whitworth's own words[11]:--\r\n\r\n\"'No, first consul,' I replied, 'we are too sensible of the advantages\r\nof peace.' 'We have,' said he, 'been fighting these fifteen years.' As\r\nhe seemed to wait for an answer, I observed only, 'That is already too\r\nlong'. 'But,' said he, 'you desire to fight for fifteen years more, and\r\nyou are forcing me to it,' I told him that was very far from his\r\nmajesty's intentions. He then proceeded to Count Marcoff and the\r\nChevalier Azzara, who were standing together at a little distance from\r\nme, and said to them, 'The English are bent on war, but if they are the\r\nfirst to draw the sword, I shall be the last to put it back into the\r\nscabbard. They do not respect treaties. They must be covered with black\r\ncrape.' I suppose he meant the treaties. He then went his round, and was\r\nthought by all those to whom he addressed himself to betray great signs\r\nof irritation. In a few minutes he came back to me, to my great\r\nannoyance, and resumed the conversation, if such it can be called, by\r\nsomething personally civil to me. He then began again, 'Why these\r\narmaments? Against whom these measures of precaution? I have not a\r\nsingle ship of the line in the French ports; but if you wish to arm, I\r\nwill arm also; if you wish to fight, I will fight also. You may perhaps\r\nkill France, but will never intimidate her.' 'We wish,' said I, 'neither\r\nthe one nor the other. We wish to live on good terms with her.' 'You\r\nmust respect treaties then,' replied he; 'woe to those who do not\r\nrespect treaties; they shall answer for it to all Europe.'\"\r\n\r\nToo much stress has been laid upon this incident, so characteristic of\r\nNapoleon's studied impetuosity. Little more than a fortnight later he\r\nreceived the British ambassador with courtesy. Overtures now succeeded\r\novertures, and much was expected on both sides from the influence of the\r\nTsar Alexander, to whom France suggested that Malta might be ceded.[12]\r\nAt the last moment, a somewhat more conciliatory disposition was shown\r\nby the French diplomatists; and the British government was blamed by its\r\nopponents, alike for having failed to break off the negotiations earlier\r\non the broadest grounds, and for breaking them off too abruptly on\r\ngrounds of doubtful validity. But we now see that national enmity,\r\nfostered by the press on both sides, rendered friendly relations\r\nimpossible, and that, even had Napoleon been willing to refrain from\r\naggressions, peace was impossible. On May 12, two months after the\r\nking's message, Whitworth, having presented an ultimatum, finally\r\nquitted Paris. A few days later an order was issued for the detention of\r\nall British subjects then resident in France, and justified on the\r\nground that French seamen (but not passengers) were liable to capture at\r\nsea. On June 10 Talleyrand announced the occupation of Hanover and the\r\ntreatment as enemies of Hanoverian soldiers serving under the King of\r\nGreat Britain. Meanwhile, on May 16, the rupture of peaceful relations\r\nwas announced to both houses of parliament; on May 18 war was declared,\r\nand in June volunteers were already mustering to resist invasion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] So Vansittart himself, in Pellew, _Life of Sidmouth_, i., 371.\r\nSouthey and Captain Mahan have erroneously supposed that Vansittart\r\naccompanied the naval expedition and was sent by Parker in the frigate\r\nfrom the Skaw.\r\n\r\n[2] _Annual Register_, xliii.

On March 5,\r\n1801, the price of the quartern loaf stood as high as 1s. 10½d. On\r\nJuly 23 it was still 1s. 8d. The harvest of this year was, however, an\r\nexcellent one. The price fell rapidly during August, and by November 12\r\nwas as low as 10½d.\r\n\r\n[3] Cornwallis, _Correspondence_, iii., 382-487.\r\n\r\n[4] In a letter to Charles Carey, dated October 22, Fox went the length\r\nof expressing extreme pleasure in the triumph of the French government\r\nover the English (_Memorials of C.

Disappointed in its hopes of returning\r\nprosperity, the nation girded itself up with rare unanimity for a\r\nrenewed contest. In July the income-tax was reinstituted and a bill was\r\nactually carried authorising a levy _en masse_ in case of invasion.\r\nPending its enforcement, the navy was vigorously recruited by means of\r\nthe press-gang; the yeomanry were called out, and a force of infantry\r\nvolunteers was enrolled, which reached a total of 300,000 in August, and\r\nof nearly 400,000 at the beginning of the next session. Pitt himself, as\r\nwarden of the Cinque Ports, took command of 3,000 volunteers in Kent,\r\nand contrasted in parliament the warlike enthusiasm of the country with\r\nthe alleged apathy of the ministry. On July 23 a rebellion broke out in\r\nIreland, instigated by French agents and headed by a young man named\r\nRobert Emmet. The conspiracy was ill planned and in itself\r\ninsignificant, but the recklessness of the conspirators was equalled by\r\nthe weakness of the civil and military authorities, who neglected to\r\ntake any precautions in spite of the plainest warnings. The rebels had\r\nintended to attack Dublin Castle and seize the person of the lord\r\nlieutenant, who was to be held as a hostage; but they dared not make the\r\nattempt, and after parading the streets for a few hours were dispersed\r\nby the spontaneous action of a few determined officers with a handful of\r\ntroops, but not before Lord Kilwarden, the chief justice, and several\r\nother persons, had been cruelly murdered by Emmet's followers. Futile as\r\nthe rising was, it sufficed to show that union was not a sovereign\r\nremedy for Irish disaffection.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the relations between the prime minister and his predecessor\r\nhad been growing less and less cordial. Throughout the year 1801 Pitt\r\nwas still the friend and informal adviser of the ministry, and it is\r\ndifficult to overrate the value of his support as a ground of confidence\r\nin an administration, personally popular, but known to be deficient in\r\nintellectual brilliance. In 1802 he generally stood aloof, and though in\r\nJune of that year he corrected the draft of the king's speech, he\r\nabsented himself from parliament, for he was dissatisfied with the\r\nmeasures adopted by government. His dissatisfaction was known to his\r\nfriends, and in November a movement was set on foot by Canning to induce\r\nAddington to withdraw in Pitt's favour; but Pitt, though willing to\r\nresume office, refused to allow the ministry to be approached on the\r\nsubject. He preferred to wait till a general wish for his return to\r\npower should be manifested. In December he visited Grenville at\r\nDropmore, and expressed a certain discontent with the government.[13] It\r\nwas his intention still to treat the ministers with tenderness, but to\r\nreturn to parliament and criticise their policy. It is easy to see that\r\nhis object at this date was not to drive the government from office, but\r\nto give rise to a desire to re-enlist his own talents in the service of\r\nthe country, and thus prepare the way for a peaceable resumption of the\r\nposition he had abandoned in the preceding year.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _NEGOTIATIONS FOR PITT'S RETURN._]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had rumours of Pitt's willingness to resume office reached\r\nAddington in the last days of December, than he opened negotiations with\r\nPitt with a view to effecting this object. Pitt did not receive his\r\novertures very warmly. He doubtless wished to be brought back because he\r\nwas felt to be indispensable, without any appearance of intrigue. Time\r\nwas in his favour, and he allowed the negotiations to proceed slowly. As\r\nthe proposals took shape, it became clear that Addington did not wish to\r\nbe openly superseded by Pitt, but preferred that they should serve\r\ntogether as secretaries of state under a third person; and Addington\r\neven suggested Pitt's brother, the Earl of Chatham, then master-general\r\nof the ordnance, as a suitable prime minister. Pitt's reply,\r\ncommunicated to Addington by Dundas, now Viscount Melville, in a letter\r\ndated March 22, 1803, was to the effect that Pitt would not accept any\r\nposition in the government except that of prime minister, with which was\r\nto be coupled the office of chancellor of the exchequer. Addington\r\nreadily acceded to Pitt's claim to this position, but Grenville refused\r\nto serve in a ministry where Addington and Hawkesbury held \"any\r\nefficient offices of real business,\" and Addington declined to abandon\r\nministerial office for a speakership of the house of lords, which Pitt\r\nproposed to create for him. Finally, on April 10, Pitt at a private\r\nconference with Addington proposed as an indispensable condition of his\r\nown return to office that Melville, Spencer, Grenville, and Windham\r\nshould become members of his cabinet. This meant a reconstruction of the\r\nwhole ministry, and Pitt stipulated that the changes should be made by\r\nthe king's desire and on the recommendation of the existing ministry.\r\n\r\nThe situation had become an impossible one. Nothing was more reasonable\r\nthan that Pitt, the friend and protector of the existing ministry,\r\nshould assume the direction of affairs now that the nation appeared to\r\nbe on the brink of war. But Pitt could not honourably desert those\r\nformer colleagues, who had resigned with him on the catholic question.\r\nTwo of these, however, Grenville and Windham, though doubtless men of\r\nthe highest capacity, had bitterly attacked the existing ministry; and\r\nit was not to be expected that that ministry, supported as it still was\r\nby overwhelming majorities in both houses of parliament, supported as it\r\nhad hitherto been by Pitt himself, should consent to admit its opponents\r\nto a share of office. It is highly improbable that Grenville and Windham\r\nwould then have co-operated with Addington and Hawkesbury, and their\r\nadmission to office would have ruined the cohesion of the cabinet,\r\nunless it had been accompanied by the retirement of the leading members\r\nof the existing ministry which Pitt's previous attitude, together with\r\nthe actual balance of parties in parliament, rendered it impossible to\r\ndemand. How difficult it was to induce Grenville and Windham to enter\r\ninto any combination future years were to prove. For the present the\r\nministry took not merely the wisest, but the only course open to it.\r\nAddington, after vainly endeavouring to induce Pitt to modify his terms,\r\nlaid them before a cabinet council on April 13; they were immediately\r\nrejected, though the cabinet declared itself ready to admit to office\r\nPitt himself and those of his colleagues who had hitherto acted with the\r\nAddington ministry. Pitt could hardly have expected any other reply. No\r\nministry could have granted such terms except on the supposition that\r\nPitt was indispensable, and Pitt for the present hardly claimed such a\r\nposition.[14]\r\n\r\nBut if Pitt did not consider himself indispensable, his friends did, and\r\nboth he and others came gradually to adopt their view. The rejection of\r\nhis terms left him free to adopt the line of policy that he had sketched\r\nto Grenville in the previous December. He had not to wait long for an\r\nopportunity, but in the opinion of Pitt's friends at least the first\r\nprovocation came from Addington. Unable to strengthen his ministry by\r\nany accession from Pitt and his followers, he had turned to the \"old\r\nopposition,\" the whigs who, under the leadership of Fox, had\r\nconsistently advocated a pacific policy. These had recently supported\r\nthe ministry against the \"new opposition,\" as the followers of Grenville\r\nand Windham were called. But since 1797 Fox and the majority of the \"old\r\nopposition\" had generally absented themselves from parliament, and\r\nGeorge Tierney, member for Southwark, had led what was left of their\r\nparty.[15] He now received and accepted the offer of the treasurership\r\nof the navy, one of the most important of the offices below cabinet\r\nrank. As a speaker Tierney was a valuable addition to the government\r\nwhich was sadly deficient in debating power; he had, however, been\r\nparticularly bitter in his attacks on Pitt, with whom he had fought a\r\nduel in 1798, and had provoked the sarcastic wit of Canning, in whose\r\nwell-known parody, \"The Friend of Humanity and the Knife-grinder\"\r\n(1798), the original illustration by Gillray depicted the friend of\r\nhumanity with the features of Tierney and laid the scene in the borough\r\nof Southwark.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _CHANGES IN ADDINGTON'S MINISTRY._]\r\n\r\nThe appointment, which Pitt himself does not appear to have resented,\r\nwas announced on June 1, and Tierney took his place on the treasury\r\nbench on the 3rd. On the same evening Colonel Patten moved a series of\r\nresolutions condemning, in extravagant terms, the conduct of the\r\nministry in the negotiation with France. Pitt seized the opportunity to\r\nmove the orders of the day. In other words, he proposed that the\r\nquestion should be left undecided. He expressed the opinion that the\r\nministry was not free from blame, but declared himself unable to concur\r\nin all the charges against it. He considered further that to drive the\r\nexisting ministers out of office would only throw the country into\r\nconfusion, and that it was therefore inadvisable to pursue the question.\r\nTo this the ministerial speakers replied by demanding a direct censure\r\nor a total acquittal, and the consequent division served only to display\r\nthe weakness of the opposition. The Addington, Fox, and Grenville\r\nparties combined to oppose Pitt's motion, which was rejected by 333\r\nvotes against 56. Pitt and Fox, and their respective followers then left\r\nthe house, leaving the ministerial party and the Grenville party to\r\ndecide the fate of Patten's resolutions, which were negatived by 275\r\nvotes against 34. A comparison of the figures of the two divisions,\r\nallowing for tellers, gives as the voting strength of Pitt's party 58,\r\nof Grenville's 36, of Fox's 22, and of Addington's 277. Of these the\r\nGrenville party alone desired to eject the ministers from office, while\r\nFox's party openly professed a preference for Addington over Pitt.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the session Pitt seldom took any part in\r\nparliamentary business, and never opposed the ministry on any question\r\nof importance. On August 12 parliament was prorogued after a session\r\nlasting nearly nine months, and the prime minister embraced the\r\nopportunity of making some slight reconstructions in the ministry.\r\nPelham, who was removed from the home office, resigned his place in the\r\ncabinet, and was shortly afterwards consoled with the chancellorship of\r\nthe duchy of Lancaster, an office which was not yet definitely\r\nrecognised as political. Charles Philip Yorke, son of the chancellor who\r\ndied in 1770 and half-brother of the third Earl of Hardwicke, resigned\r\nthe office of secretary at war and succeeded to the home office on the\r\n17th. It was also considered advisable to strengthen the ministry in the\r\nupper house, where Grenville's oratory gave the opposition a decided\r\nadvantage in debating power, and Hawkesbury was accordingly summoned to\r\nthe lords on November 16 in his father's barony of Hawkesbury. After\r\nthis rearrangement the cabinet contained eight peers and three\r\ncommoners, no illiberal allowance of commoners according to the ideas of\r\nthe age. The recess was further marked by a violent war of pamphlets\r\nbetween the followers of Addington and Pitt, which began early in\r\nSeptember, and which, although no politician of the first order took any\r\ndirect part in it, did much to embitter the relations of their\r\nrespective parties.[16] Not less irritating were the _jeux d'esprit_\r\nwith which Canning continued to assail the ministry in the newspaper\r\npress.[17] The most famous of these is the couplet:--\r\n\r\n    Pitt is to Addington\r\n    As London is to Paddington.\r\n\r\nA more openly abusive poem, entitled \"Good Intentions,\" described the\r\nprime minister as \"Happy Britain's guardian gander\". The following\r\nverses refer to the appointment of Addington's brother, John Hiley\r\nAddington, to be paymaster-general of the forces, and of his\r\nbrother-in-law, Charles Bragge, afterwards succeeded by Tierney, to be\r\ntreasurer of the navy:--\r\n\r\n    How blest, how firm the statesman stands\r\n      (Him no low intrigue can move)\r\n    Circled by faithful kindred bands\r\n      And propped by fond fraternal love.\r\n\r\n      When his speeches hobble vilely,\r\n      What \"Hear him's\" burst from Brother Hiley;\r\n      When his faltering periods lag,\r\n      Hark to the cheers of Brother Bragge.\r\n\r\n      Each a gentleman at large,\r\n      Lodged and fed at public charge,\r\n      Paying (with a grace to charm ye)\r\n      This the Fleet, and that the Army.[18]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE KING'S ILLNESS._]\r\n\r\nWhen parliament reassembled on November 22 the opposition was still\r\ndisunited, and, though Windham severely condemned the inadequacy of the\r\nprovision made for national defence, he did not venture to divide\r\nagainst the government. But during the Christmas recess a distinct step\r\nwas made towards the consolidation of the opposition by the reunion of\r\nthe two sections of the whig party. Grenville had conceived a chimerical\r\nproject of replacing the existing administration by one which should\r\ninclude all statesmen possessed of real political talent, whatever their\r\ndifferences in the past might have been. True to this policy, he\r\npersuaded Fox in January, 1804, to join him in attempting to expel the\r\nAddington administration from office as an essential preliminary to any\r\nfurther action. Sheridan, however, with some of the Prince of Wales's\r\nfriends, still refused to enter into any combination which might result\r\nin the return of Pitt to power. The parliamentary session was resumed on\r\nFebruary 1, but the course of events was complicated by a recurrence of\r\nthe king's malady. Symptoms of this were observed towards the end of\r\nJanuary; the disease took a turn for the worse about February 12, and on\r\nthe 14th it was made known to the public. For a short time the king's\r\nlife appeared to be in danger; his reason was affected during a longer\r\ninterval, but the attack was in every way milder than in 1789, and on\r\nMarch 7 Dr. Simmons reported to Addington that \"the king was competent\r\nto perform any act of government\".[19] It is true that for many months\r\nthe king's health did not allow him to give his full attention to public\r\nbusiness, but there was nothing to prevent him from attending to such\r\nroutine work as was absolutely necessary. There could, however, be no\r\nquestion of a change of ministers till there should be a marked\r\nimprovement in the king's health.\r\n\r\nThe king's illness was made the occasion on February 27 of a motion by\r\nSir Robert Lawley for the adjournment of the house of commons. This was\r\nparried by Addington with the statement that there was no necessary\r\nsuspension of such royal functions as it might be necessary for His\r\nMajesty to discharge at the present moment.[20] The emphasis here\r\nobviously lay on the word \"necessary\". A still bolder course was adopted\r\nshortly afterwards by the lord chancellor. When on March 9 the king's\r\nassent to several bills was given by commission, Fitzwilliam raised not\r\nunreasonable doubts as to whether the king was capable of resuming the\r\nfunctions of government. Eldon, however, declared that, as the result of\r\na private interview with the king, he had come to the conclusion that\r\nthe royal commissioners were warranted in assenting to the bills in\r\nquestion. Whether the chancellor was justified in assuming this\r\nresponsibility must remain doubtful; at all events Pitt seems to have\r\ndetermined that the time was now ripe for a ministerial crisis. He had\r\non February 27 criticised both the military and naval defences of the\r\ncountry, but he would not directly attack the government till the king's\r\nhealth was in a better condition. At last, on March 15, the first attack\r\nwas made. Pitt selected the weak point in the administration. St.\r\nVincent's obstinacy in refusing to believe in the possibility of a\r\nrenewal of hostility and his excessive economy had brought about a\r\nmarked deterioration in the strength and quality of the fleet. Pitt\r\naccordingly moved for an inquiry into the administration of the navy.\r\nFox dissociated himself from Pitt's attacks on the first lord of the\r\nadmiralty, but supported the motion on the ground that an inquiry would\r\nclear St. Vincent's character. On a division the government had a\r\nmajority of 201 against 130. On the 19th, however, Pitt refused to join\r\nthe Grenvilles in supporting Fox's motion for the re-committal of the\r\nvolunteer consolidation bill. On the following day Eldon made overtures\r\nto Pitt, and on the 23rd Pitt dined _tête-à-tête_ with the chancellor,\r\nbut no record has been preserved of the nature of their negotiations.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th Pitt, in a letter to Melville, explained his position at\r\nlength. He intended, as soon after the Easter recess as the king's\r\nhealth should permit, to write to the king explaining the dangers which,\r\nin his opinion, threatened the crown and people from the continuance of\r\nthe existing government, and representing the urgent necessity of a\r\nspeedy change; he would prefer an administration from which no political\r\nparty should be excluded, but was unwilling, especially in view of the\r\nking's state of health, to force any minister upon him; if, therefore,\r\nhe should be invited by the king to form a ministry from which the\r\npartisans of Fox and Grenville were to be excluded, he was prepared to\r\nform one from his own followers united with the more capable members of\r\nthe existing government, excluding Addington himself and St. Vincent;\r\nshould this measure fail of success, he would \"have no hesitation in\r\ntaking such ground in Parliament as would be most likely to attain the\r\nobject\".[21] As it happened, the parliamentary assault preceded the\r\ncorrespondence with the king. Immediately after the recess the ministry\r\nlaid before parliament military proposals which Pitt felt bound to\r\nresist. On April 16 Pitt, supported by Windham, opposed the third\r\nreading of a bill for augmenting the Irish militia, and expressed a\r\npreference for the army of reserve. He was defeated by the narrow\r\nmajority of 128 against 107. On the 23rd Fox proposed to refer the\r\nquestion of national defence to a committee of the whole house. He was\r\nsupported by Pitt and Windham, and defeated by 256 votes only against\r\n204. The division which sealed the fate of the ministry was taken two\r\ndays later on a motion that the house should go into committee on a bill\r\nfor the suspension of the army of reserve. This was opposed by Pitt, who\r\nexpounded a rival plan for the diminution of the militia and increase of\r\nthe army of reserve. Fox and Windham demanded for Pitt's scheme a right\r\nto consideration, and on a division the motion was carried by no more\r\nthan 240 against 203. The division of April 16 had convinced Addington\r\nthat a reconciliation with Pitt was necessary. On Pitt's refusing to\r\nconfer with him, he agreed to recommend the king to charge Eldon with\r\nthe task of discovering Pitt's views as to the formation of a new\r\nministry, in case the king wished to learn them.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _ADDINGTON'S RESIGNATION._]\r\n\r\nThe king, however, expressed no such wish, and on April 22 Pitt sent an\r\nunsealed letter to Eldon to be laid before the king; announcing his\r\ndissatisfaction with the ministry and his intention of declaring this\r\ndissatisfaction in parliament.[22] It was not till the 27th that Eldon\r\nfound a suitable opportunity of communicating Pitt's letter to the king.\r\nBefore that date Addington, who considered that he could no longer\r\nremain in office with dignity after the divisions of the 23rd and 25th,\r\nhad on the 26th informed the king of his intention to resign. The king\r\nreluctantly consented to his resignation, which was announced to the\r\ncabinet on the 29th. On the following day Eldon called on Pitt with a\r\nrequest from the king for a plan of a new administration. Pitt replied\r\nin a letter, setting forth at great length the arguments in favour of a\r\ncombined administration, and requesting permission to confer with Fox\r\nand Grenville about the construction of the ministry.[23] The letter\r\nirritated the king, who demanded a renewed pledge against catholic\r\nemancipation, with which Grenville was specially associated in his mind,\r\nand refused to admit Pitt to office if he persevered in his purpose of\r\nconsulting Fox and Grenville. Pitt then declared his adherence to the\r\npledge given in 1801[24] and requested an interview with the king. The\r\ninterview, which took place on May 7, lasted three hours, and ended in a\r\ncompromise. The king agreed to admit Grenville and his friends to\r\noffice, but, while ready to accept the friends of Fox, he refused, as\r\nmuch on personal as on political grounds, to give Fox a place in the\r\ncabinet. At the same time he declared himself ready to grant him a\r\ndiplomatic appointment. At a later date the king went the length of\r\ndeclaring that, rather than accept Fox, he would have incurred the risk\r\nof civil war.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _PITT'S RETURN TO OFFICE._]\r\n\r\nFox readily agreed to his own exclusion, which he had fully expected,\r\nand urged his followers to join Pitt, but Grenville and his friends\r\nrefused to serve without Fox, while the friends of Fox and the more\r\nimmediate followers of Addington refused to serve without their\r\nrespective leaders. Addington always considered that Pitt had treated\r\nhim ungenerously in driving him from office, when it was open to him to\r\nreturn to the head of affairs with the full consent of the existing\r\nministers. More recently it has been the fashion to blame Pitt for\r\nbringing too little pressure to bear upon the king and thus losing the\r\nsupport of Fox and Grenville. Neither charge appears to be justified.\r\nThrough the whole length of the Addington administration Pitt showed\r\nhimself fully sensitive of what was due to the king, with whom he had\r\nworked cordially for eighteen years, to Grenville who had resigned in\r\nhis cause, and to Addington who had assumed office under his protection.\r\nThere was no trace of faction in Pitt's attitude towards the ministry.\r\nHe merely opposed what he believed to be dangerous to the country, and\r\nwhen he was convinced of the necessity of removing Addington from a\r\nshare in public business, he endeavoured to effect his purpose in such a\r\nway as to give the minimum of offence.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Pitt's intended combination in a supreme crisis of\r\nhis country's destiny with his life-long antagonist, Fox, was a heroic\r\nexperiment, perhaps, but still only an experiment. The failure of the\r\nministry of \"All the Talents\" renders it exceedingly doubtful whether\r\nsuch an alliance would have proved successful, and Fox's lukewarm\r\npatriotism would have been dearly purchased at the expense of the\r\nalienation of the king, perhaps even of his relapse into insanity. Nor\r\nis it certain that the strongest pressure would have induced George III.\r\nto accept Fox at this date. Addington was still undefeated and might\r\nhave remained in office if Pitt had refused to assume the reins of\r\ngovernment without Fox. Grenville is undoubtedly more responsible than\r\nany one else for the weakness of Pitt's second administration. It was\r\nfrom a sense of loyalty to Grenville that Pitt had suffered the\r\nnegotiations for his return to office in 1803 to fall through, and now\r\nwhen the two statesmen could return together, and when, if ever, a\r\nstrong government was needed, either a quixotic sense of honour or a\r\nwounded pride induced Grenville not only to stand aloof from the new\r\nadministration himself, but to do his utmost to prevent others from\r\ngiving it their support.[25] The new cabinet was quickly formed. Pitt\r\nreceived the seals of office on May 10, and took his seat in parliament\r\nafter re-election on the 18th, the very day on which Napoleon was\r\ndeclared emperor by the French senate.\r\n\r\nThis event, long foreseen, was doubtless hastened by the disclosure of\r\nthe plot formed by Moreau, Pichegru, and Georges Cadoudal against the\r\nfirst consul. There was no proof of Moreau's complicity in designs on\r\nNapoleon's life, and the mysterious death of Pichegru in prison left the\r\nextent of his complicity among the insoluble problems of history, but\r\nthere can be no doubt that Cadoudal was justly executed for plotting\r\nassassination. Unfortunately some of the under-secretaries in the\r\nAddington administration had not only shared the plans of the\r\nconspirators so far as they aimed at a rising in France, but had\r\nprocured for them material assistance. They appear, however, to have\r\nbeen innocent of any attempt on Napoleon's life. Drake, the British\r\nenvoy at Munich, was, however, deeper in the plot. The evidence of\r\nBritish complicity naturally received the very worst construction in\r\nParis.[26] Napoleon himself certainly believed in an Anglo-Bourbon\r\nconspiracy, organised by the Count of Artois and other French royalists,\r\nwhen he caused the Duke of Enghien to be kidnapped in Baden territory\r\nand hurried off to the castle of Vincennes. He was, however, already\r\naware of his prisoner's innocence when on March 21 he had him shot there\r\nby torch-light after a mock trial before a military commission. All\r\nEurope was shocked by this atrocious assassination, and though Napoleon\r\nsometimes attempted to shift the guilt of it upon Talleyrand, he\r\njustified it at other times as a measure of self-defence, and left on\r\nrecord his deliberate approval of it, for the consideration of\r\nposterity. Two months later he became Emperor of the French.\r\n\r\nWhen Pitt resumed office on May 10, 1804, he was no longer the\r\nheaven-born and buoyant young minister of 1783, strong in the confidence\r\nof the king and the anticipated confidence of the nation, with a\r\nminority of followers in the house of commons, but with the brightest\r\nprospects of political success before him. Nor was he the leader of a\r\ndevoted majority, as when he resigned in 1801 rather than abandon his\r\nconvictions on the catholic question. He had been compelled to waive\r\nthese convictions, without fully regaining the confidence of the king,\r\nand, while the adherents of Fox retained their deep-seated hatred of a\r\nwar-policy, the adherents of Addington and Grenville were in no mood to\r\ngive him a loyal support. Windham and Spencer were no longer at his\r\nside, and his ministry was essentially the same as that of Addington,\r\nwith the substitution of Dudley Ryder, now Lord Harrowby, for Hawkesbury\r\nas foreign secretary, Melville for St. Vincent as first lord of the\r\nadmiralty, Earl Camden for Hobart as secretary for war and the colonies,\r\nand the Duke of Montrose for Auckland as president of the board of\r\ntrade. Hawkesbury was transferred to the home office, vacated by Yorke,\r\nand the new chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, Lord Mulgrave, was\r\ngiven a seat in the cabinet. Of Pitt's eleven colleagues in the cabinet\r\nCastlereagh alone, who remained president of the board of control--a\r\nwretched speaker though an able administrator--had a seat in the lower\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _PITT'S RECONCILIATION WITH ADDINGTON._]\r\n\r\nMilitary exigencies now engrossed all thoughts, and the king's speech,\r\nin proroguing parliament on July 31, foreshadowed a new coalition, for\r\nwhich the murder of the Duke of Enghien had paved the way. The\r\npreparations for an invasion of England had been resumed, and Napoleon\r\ncelebrated his birthday in great state at Boulogne, still postponing his\r\nfinal stroke until he should be crowned, on December 2, at Paris by the\r\nhelpless pope, brought from Italy for the purpose.[27] A month later he\r\npersonally addressed another pacific letter to the King of England, who\r\nreplied in his speech from the throne on January 15, 1805, that he could\r\nnot entertain overtures except in concert with Russia and the other\r\npowers. Meanwhile, Pitt, conscious as he was of failing powers, retained\r\nhis undaunted courage, and while he was organising a third coalition,\r\ndid not shrink from a bold measure which could hardly be justified by\r\ninternational law. This was the seizure on October 5, 1804, of three\r\nSpanish treasure-ships on the high seas, without a previous declaration\r\nof war against Spain, though not without a previous notice that\r\nhostilities might be opened at any moment unless Spain ceased to give\r\nunderhand assistance to France. The excuse was that Spain had long been\r\nthe obsequious ally of France, and, as the alliance now became open,\r\nPitt's act was sanctioned by a large majority in both houses of\r\nparliament in January, 1805. The parliamentary session which opened in\r\nthis month found Pitt's ministry apparently stronger than it had been at\r\nthe beginning of the recess. Despairing of any help from Grenville,\r\nexcept in a vigorous prosecution of the war, he had sought a\r\nreconciliation with Addington, who became Viscount Sidmouth on January\r\n12 and president of the council on the 14th. Along with Sidmouth his\r\nformer colleague Hobart, now Earl of Buckinghamshire, returned to office\r\nas chancellor of the duchy. To make room for these new allies, Portland\r\nhad consented to resign the presidency of the council, though he\r\nremained a member of the cabinet, while Mulgrave was appointed to the\r\nforeign office, in place of Harrowby, who was compelled by ill-health to\r\nretire.\r\n\r\nBut this new accession of strength was soon followed by a terrible\r\nmortification which probably contributed to shorten Pitt's life.\r\nMelville, his tried supporter and intimate friend, was charged on the\r\nreport of a commission with having misapplied public money as treasurer\r\nof the navy in Pitt's former ministry. It appeared that he had been\r\nculpably careless, and had not prevented the paymaster, Trotter, from\r\nengaging in private speculations with the naval balances. Although\r\nTrotter's speculations involved no loss to the state they were,\r\nnevertheless, a contravention of an act of 1785. Melville had also\r\nsupplied other departments of government with naval money, but was\r\npersonally innocent of fraud. There was a divergence of feeling in the\r\ncabinet as to the attitude to be adopted towards Melville. Sidmouth,\r\nhimself a man of the highest integrity, was a friend of St. Vincent, the\r\nlate first lord of the admiralty, and had not forgiven Melville for his\r\npart in the expulsion of himself and St. Vincent from office. He had\r\ntherefore both public and private grounds to incline him against\r\nMelville. On April 8, Samuel Whitbread moved a formal censure on\r\nMelville in the house of commons. Pitt, with the approval of Sidmouth\r\nand his friends, moved the previous question on Whitbread's motion, and\r\ndeclared his intention of introducing a motion of his own for a select\r\ncommittee to investigate the charges. In spite of the support which Pitt\r\nderived from the followers of Sidmouth the votes were equally divided on\r\nWhitbread's motion, 216 a side. Abbot, the speaker, gave his casting\r\nvote in favour of Whitbread, and the announcement was received by the\r\nwhig members with unseemly exultation.[28]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _MINISTERIAL CHANGES._]\r\n\r\nThe censure was followed by an impeachment before the house of lords,\r\nwhere Melville was acquitted in the following year. Meanwhile, he had\r\nresigned office on April 9, the day after the vote of censure, and his\r\nplace at the admiralty was taken by Sir Charles Middleton, who was\r\nraised to the peerage as Lord Barham. The appointment gave umbrage to\r\nSidmouth, to whom Pitt had made promises of promotion for his own\r\nfollowers, and he was with difficulty induced to remain in the cabinet.\r\nPitt was, however, irritated by the hostile votes of Sidmouth's\r\nfollowers, Hiley Addington and Bond, on the question of the impeachment,\r\nand regarded this as a reason for delaying their preferment. Sidmouth\r\nnow complained of a breach of faith, as Pitt had promised to treat the\r\nquestion as an open one, and he resigned office on July 4.\r\nBuckinghamshire resigned next day. Camden was appointed to succeed\r\nSidmouth as lord president, Castlereagh followed Camden as secretary for\r\nwar and the colonies, retaining his previous position as president of\r\nthe board of control, and Harrowby, whose health had improved since his\r\nresignation in January, took Buckinghamshire's place as chancellor of\r\nthe duchy. Thus weakened at home, Pitt could derive little consolation\r\nfrom the aspect of continental affairs. On May 26, Napoleon was crowned\r\nKing of Italy in the cathedral of Milan, and the Ligurian Republic\r\nbecame part of the French empire in the following month. The ascendency\r\nof France in Europe might well have appeared impregnable, and it might\r\nhave been supposed that nothing remained for England but to guard her\r\nown coasts and recapture some of the French colonies given up by the\r\ntreaty of Amiens.\r\n\r\nBut Pitt's spirit was still unbroken, and by the middle of July he\r\nsucceeded in rallying three powers, Russia, Austria, and Sweden, into a\r\nleague to withstand the further encroachments of France. Such a league\r\nhad been proposed by Gustavus IV. of Sweden, early in 1804, but nothing\r\ndefinite was done till Pitt's ministry entered upon office. Meanwhile,\r\nthe assassination of the Duke of Enghien had led to a rupture of\r\ndiplomatic relations between France and Russia, though war was not\r\ndeclared. Negotiations were presently set on foot for a league, which,\r\nit was hoped, would be joined by Austria and Prussia in addition to\r\nGreat Britain, Russia, and Sweden. An interesting feature in the\r\nnegotiations was the tsar's scheme of a European polity, where the\r\nstates should be independent and enjoy institutions \"founded on the\r\nsacred rights of humanity,\" a foreshadowing, as it would seem, of the\r\nHoly Alliance. The discussion of details between Great Britain and\r\nRussia began towards the end of 1804. Difficulties, however, arose about\r\nthe British retention of Malta and the British claim to search neutral\r\nships for deserters. A treaty between the two powers was signed on April\r\n11, 1805; but the tsar long refused his ratification, and it was only\r\ngiven in July, after a formal protest against the retention of Malta.\r\n\r\nThe object of this alliance was defined to be the expulsion of French\r\ntroops from North Germany, the assured independence of the republics of\r\nHolland and Switzerland, and the restoration of the King of Sardinia in\r\nPiedmont; 500,000 men were to be provided for the war by Russia and such\r\nother continental powers as might join the coalition. Great Britain,\r\ninstead of furnishing troops, was to supply £1,250,000 a year for every\r\n100,000 men engaged in the war. After the close of the war an European\r\ncongress was to define more closely the law of nations and establish an\r\nEuropean federation. At the same time the allies disclaimed the\r\nintention of forcing any system of government on France against her\r\nwill. It will be observed that the number of troops specified was far in\r\nexcess of what Russia alone could place in the field; such numbers could\r\nonly be obtained by the adhesion of Austria and of either Prussia or\r\nsome of the smaller German states to the coalition. So far as Austria\r\nwas concerned, Napoleon's Italian policy rendered war inevitable.\r\nAlready in November, 1804, the Austrian court had entered into a secret\r\nagreement with Russia to make war on France in the event of further\r\nFrench aggressions in Italy. The coronation of Napoleon as King of Italy\r\nand the annexation of Liguria were, however, more than aggressions; they\r\nwere open violations of the treaty of Lunéville which had guaranteed the\r\nindependence of the Cisalpine and Ligurian republics. Austria hereupon\r\ndetermined on war, and secretly joined the coalition on August 9, 1805.\r\nSweden, which was not a member of it, concluded separate treaties of\r\nalliance both with Great Britain and with Russia. Greater difficulties\r\nhad to be surmounted in the case of Prussia. Frederick William III.\r\ncherished no enthusiasm for European liberty, and vacillated under the\r\ninfluence of Napoleon's offer of Hanover on the one hand and his\r\nnumerous petty insults on the other. Prussia in consequence remained\r\nneutral throughout the most decisive period of the ensuing war.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _NELSON AND VILLENEUVE._]\r\n\r\nLong before the coalition was ready Napoleon's mind had recurred to his\r\nventuresome project for the invasion of England. An army, the finest\r\nthat he ever led to victory, which, even after it had been transferred\r\nto another scene of action, he still saw fit to call the \"army of\r\nEngland,\" was encamped near Boulogne. It was constantly exercised in the\r\nprocess of embarking on board flat-bottomed boats or rafts, which were\r\nto be convoyed by Villeneuve, admiral of the Toulon fleet, and\r\nGantheaume, admiral of the Brest fleet, for whose appearance the French\r\nsignalmen vainly scanned the horizon. In the meantime, Nelson had been\r\nengaged for two years, without setting foot on shore, in that patient\r\nand sleepless watch, ranging over the whole Mediterranean, which must\r\never rank with the greatest of his matchless exploits. At last, he\r\nlearned in the spring of 1805, that Villeneuve, following a plan\r\nconcerted by Napoleon himself, had eluded him by sailing from Toulon\r\ntowards Cadiz, had there been joined by the Spanish fleet, and was\r\nsteering for the West Indies. Nelson followed with a much smaller number\r\nof ships, and might have forced an action in those waters, but he was\r\nmisled by false intelligence and missed the enemy, though his dreaded\r\npresence was effectual in saving the British islands from any serious\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nThe combined fleets of France and Spain recrossed the Atlantic and in\r\naccordance with Napoleon's plans made for Ferrol on the coast of\r\nGalicia. After being repulsed with some loss off Cape Finisterre by Sir\r\nRobert Calder, who was court-martialled and severely reprimanded for\r\nneglecting to follow up his victory, they put in first at Vigo, and then\r\nwith fifteen allied ships at Coruña. But, instead of venturing to carry\r\nout Napoleon's orders by challenging Admiral Cornwallis's fleet off\r\nBrest, and making a desperate effort to command the channel, Villeneuve\r\nnow took advantage of his emperors recommendation to return to Cadiz in\r\nevent of defeat, and set sail for that port in the middle of August.\r\nNelson, ignorant of his movements, had vainly sought him off the Straits\r\nof Gibraltar, and came home to report himself at the admiralty. Arriving\r\nat Spithead on August 18, he was in England barely four weeks, most of\r\nwhich he spent in privacy at Merton. During this brief respite he\r\nreceived a general tribute of admiration and affection from his\r\ncountrymen, which anticipated the verdict of posterity. On September 15\r\nhe sailed from Portsmouth, with a presentiment of his own fate, after\r\nhaving described to Sidmouth the general design of his crowning sea\r\nfight: he would, he said, break the enemy's line in two places; and he\r\ndid so. He joined Admiral Collingwood off Cadiz on the 29th, and on\r\nOctober 19 he received news that Villeneuve, smarting under the\r\nprospect of being superseded, had put to sea with the combined fleet.\r\nComplicated naval manoeuvres followed, but on the 21st the enemy was\r\nforced to give battle, a few leagues from Cape Trafalgar, and Nelson\r\ncaused his immortal signal to be hoisted--\"England expects that every\r\nman will do his duty\".\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE BATTLE OF TRAFALGAR._]\r\n\r\nThe French and Spanish fleet comprised thirty-three ships of the line,\r\nof which eighteen were French and fifteen Spanish; the British had only\r\ntwenty-seven, but among these were seven three-deckers as against four\r\non the side of the allies. It had the additional advantage of superior\r\ndiscipline and equipment, to say nothing of the genius of its commander.\r\nThe British fleet advanced in two divisions, Nelson leading the weather\r\ndivision of twelve, and Collingwood the lee division of fifteen ships.\r\nAccording to Nelson's plan Collingwood was to attack the rear of the\r\nenemy's line, while he himself cut off and paralysed the centre and van.\r\nBoth divisions advanced without regular formation, the ships bearing\r\ndown with all the speed they could command and without waiting for\r\nlaggards. Collingwood in the _Royal Sovereign_, steering E. by N., broke\r\nthrough the allies' line twelve ships from the rear, raking the _Santa\r\nAna_, Alava's flagship, as he passed her stern, with a broadside which\r\nstruck down 400 of her men. For some fifteen minutes the _Royal\r\nSovereign_ was alone in action; then others of the division came up and\r\nsuccessively penetrated the line of the allies, and engaging ship to\r\nship completely disposed of the enemy's rear, their twelve rear ships\r\nbeing all taken or destroyed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Nelson in the _Victory_, who had reserved to himself the more\r\ndifficult task of containing twenty-one ships with twelve, held on his\r\ncourse, advancing so as to keep the allied van stationary and yet to\r\nprevent the centre from venturing to help the rear. He designed to pass\r\nthrough the end of the line in order to cut the enemy's van off from\r\nCadiz, but, finding an opportunity, changed his course, passed down the\r\nline and attacked the centre. He passed through the line of the allied\r\nfleet, closely followed by four other ships of his division, and the\r\nfive British ships concentrated their attacks on the _Bucentaure_,\r\nVilleneuve's flagship, the gigantic Spanish four-decker, the _Santísima\r\nTrinidad_, which was next ahead of her, and the _Redoutable_, which\r\nsupported her. The centre of the allies was crushed and the van cut off\r\nfrom coming to the help of the rear, which was being destroyed by\r\nCollingwood.\r\n\r\nBefore the battle ended, the naval force of France, and with it\r\nNapoleon's projects of invasion, were utterly and hopelessly ruined.\r\nEighteen prizes were taken, and, though many of these were lost in a\r\ngale, four ships which escaped were afterwards captured, and the\r\nremainder lay for the most part shattered hulks at Cadiz. By this battle\r\nthe supremacy of Great Britain at sea was finally established. Nelson,\r\nwho, during the ship-to-ship engagement which followed his penetration\r\nof the enemy's line, was mortally wounded by a sharp-shooter from the\r\nmizzen-top of the _Redoutable_, died before the battle was over, though\r\nhe was spared to hear that a complete victory was secure. His death is\r\namong the heroic incidents of history, and his last achievement, both in\r\nits conception and its results, was the fitting climax of his fame. The\r\nplan for the battle which he drew up beforehand for the instruction of\r\nhis captains, and the changes which he made in it to meet the conditions\r\nof the moment are alike worthy of his supreme genius as a naval\r\ntactician. His arrangements were carried out by men who had learned to\r\nlove and trust him, and who were inspired by the fire of his spirit, and\r\nhence it was that the allied fleet of France and Spain perished at the\r\n\"Nelson touch\".[29]\r\n\r\nVery different were the fortunes of war in central Europe, where\r\nNapoleon himself commanded the \"army of England\". It was not until the\r\nend of August that Napoleon knew that Villeneuve would be unable to\r\nappear in the Channel, but no sooner did he abandon his project of\r\ninvasion in despair than he resolved on a campaign scarcely less\r\narduous, and gave orders for a grand march into Germany. Pitt, as we\r\nhave seen, had successfully negotiated an alliance with Russia and\r\nAustria, whose armies were converging upon the plains of Bavaria and\r\nwere to have been reinforced by a large Prussian contingent. Unhappily,\r\nthey had not effected a junction when Napoleon crossed the Rhine near\r\nStrassburg and the Danube near Donauwörth, while he detached large\r\nforces to check the advance of the Russians and the approach of\r\nreinforcements expected from Italy. One of these movements involved an\r\nopen violation of Prussian territory, but he could rely on the\r\nwell-tried servility of Frederick William. The first decisive result of\r\nhis strategy was the surrender of Mack at Ulm, with 30,000 men and 60\r\npieces of ordnance. This event took place on October 20, the very day\r\nbefore the battle of Trafalgar, and opened the road to Vienna, which the\r\nFrench troops entered on November 13, occupying the great bridge by a\r\nruse more skilful than honourable, during the negotiation of an\r\narmistice. Vienna was spared, while Napoleon pressed on to meet the\r\nremainder of the Austrian army, which had now been joined by a larger\r\nbody of Russians near Brünn. The allies numbered about 100,000 men;\r\nNapoleon's army was numerically somewhat less, but possessed the same\r\nkind of superiority as the British navy at Trafalgar. The result was the\r\ncrushing victory of Austerlitz on December 2, followed by the peace of\r\nPressburg, between France and Austria, signed on the 26th. The principal\r\narticles of this treaty provided for the cession of Venetia, Istria, and\r\nDalmatia to the kingdom of Italy, and the aggrandisement of Bavaria and\r\nWürtemberg, whose electors received the royal title as the price of\r\ntheir sympathetic alliance with France. Russia withdrew sullenly, having\r\nlearned the hollowness of her league with Prussia, which had basely\r\ntemporised while the fate of Germany was at stake, and whose minister,\r\nHaugwitz, suppressing the _ultimatum_ which he was charged to deliver,\r\nhad openly congratulated the conqueror of Austerlitz.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain had had no direct share in the conflict in Southern\r\nGermany and Moravia; she had, however, joined in two expeditions, the\r\none in Southern, the other in Northern Europe. In spite of a treaty of\r\nneutrality between France and the Two Sicilies, ratified on October 8,\r\nan Anglo-Russian squadron was permitted to land a force of 10,000\r\nBritish troops under Sir James Craig, and 14,000 Russians on the shore\r\nof the Bay of Naples. These troops effected nothing, and the violation\r\nof neutrality was, as we shall see, destined to involve the Neapolitan\r\nmonarchy in ruin. The expedition to North Germany was planned on a\r\nlarger scale. Hanover had been occupied by France since June, 1803. Its\r\nrecovery was attempted by an Anglo-Hanoverian force under Cathcart,\r\nwhich was to have been supported by a Russian and Swedish force acting\r\nfrom Stralsund. The co-operation of Prussia was also expected. In order\r\nto secure this alliance the British government offered Prussia an\r\nextension of territory so as to include Antwerp, Liège, Luxemburg, and\r\nCologne, in the event of victory. In November the expedition landed. In\r\nDecember Prussia had definitely given her protection to the Russian\r\ntroops in Hanover and offered it to the Hanoverians. Pitt computed that\r\nat the beginning of the next campaign nearly 300,000 men would be\r\navailable in North Germany. But the vacillation of Prussia ruined all.\r\nOn December 15 Haugwitz signed the treaty of Schönbrunn, by which\r\nPrussia was to enter into an offensive and defensive alliance with\r\nFrance and was to receive Hanover in return for Ansbach, Cleves, and\r\nNeuchâtel. Frederick William could not yet stoop to such a degree of\r\ninfamy, and therefore, instead of ratifying the treaty, resolved on\r\nJanuary 3, 1806, to propose a compromise, which involved among other\r\nprovisions the temporary occupation of Hanover by Prussia. In\r\nconsequence of this determination he sent, on January 7, a request for\r\nthe withdrawal of the British forces, which were accordingly\r\nrecalled.[30]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE DEATH OF PITT._]\r\n\r\nThe collapse of his last coalition was the death-blow of Pitt, cheered\r\nthough he was for the moment by the news of Trafalgar. The fatal\r\nconsequences of Austerlitz were reported to him at Bath, whence he\r\nreturned by easy stages to his villa at Putney in January, 1806. His\r\nnoble spirit was broken at last by the defection of Prussia, and after\r\nlingering a while, he died on the 23rd of that month, leaving a name\r\nsecond to none among the greatest statesmen of his country. His\r\nsagacious mind grasped the advantage to be gained by freeing trade from\r\nunnecessary restrictions, and anticipated catholic emancipation,\r\nparliamentary reform, and the abolition of slavery. He gave the nation,\r\nin the union with Ireland, the one constructive measure of the first\r\norder achieved in his time, and only marred by the weakness of more\r\npliable successors in a lesser age. His dauntless soul, which bore him\r\nup against the bitterest disappointments, the desertion of friends, and\r\nthe depression of mortal disease, inspired the governing classes of\r\nEngland to endure ten more years of exhausting war, to save Europe (as\r\nhe foretold) by their example, and to crown his own work at Waterloo.\r\nHis lofty eloquence, which has been described as a gift independent of\r\nstatesmanship, was indeed a product of statesmanship, for it consisted\r\nin no mere witchery of words, but in a luminous and convincing\r\npresentation of essential facts. He may have been inferior to his own\r\nfather in fiery rhetoric, to Peel in comprehensive grasp of domestic\r\npolicy, and to Gladstone in the political experience gained by sixty\r\nyears of political life, but in capacity for command he was inferior to\r\nnone. If he was not an ideal war minister, he was not a war minister by\r\nhis own choice; his lot was cast in times which suppressed the exercise\r\nof his best powers; and he was matched in the organisation of war,\r\nthough not in the field, against the greatest organising genius known to\r\nhistory. He must be judged by what he actually did and meditated as a\r\npeace minister; his conduct of the war must be compared with that of\r\nthose able but not gifted men who strove to bend the bow which he left\r\nbehind him; and we must assuredly conclude that none of his colleagues\r\nor rivals was his peer either in powers or in public spirit.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] Buckingham, _Court and Cabinets_, iii., 242; Lewis,\r\n_Administrations of Great Britain_, p. 225.\r\n\r\n[14] Buckingham, _Court and Cabinets_, iii., 282-90; Pellew, _Life of\r\nSidmouth_, ii., 113-31; Stanhope, _Life of Pitt_, iv., 20-39.\r\n\r\n[15] See vol. x., p. 399.\r\n\r\n[16] Pellew, _Life of Sidmouth_, ii., 145-47; Stanhope, _Life of Pitt_,\r\niv., 88-93.\r\n\r\n[17] For a list of Canning's squibs, belonging to this period, see\r\nLewis, _Administrations_, p. 249, note.\r\n\r\n[18] It was not fair to hold Addington entirely responsible for the\r\npromotion of his brother, who had been a junior lord of the treasury\r\nunder Pitt.

The king turned at first to Hawkesbury, afterwards destined\r\nas Earl of Liverpool to hold the office of premier for nearly fifteen\r\nyears; but he then felt himself unequal to such a burden. He next sent\r\nfor Grenville, who insisted on the co-operation of Fox, to which the\r\nking assented without demur, and the short-lived ministry of \"All the\r\nTalents\" was formed within a few days. It was essentially a whig\r\ncabinet, but it included two tories, Sidmouth as lord privy seal, and\r\nLord Ellenborough, the lord chief justice. Grenville himself was first\r\nlord of the treasury, Fox foreign secretary, and Erskine lord\r\nchancellor. Charles Grey, the future Earl Grey, was first lord of the\r\nadmiralty. Spencer home secretary, Windham secretary for war and the\r\ncolonies, and Lord Henry Petty, the future Marquis of Lansdowne,\r\nchancellor of the exchequer. Fitzwilliam was lord president, and the\r\nEarl of Moira master-general of the ordnance. Ellenborough owed his\r\nplace in the cabinet to the influence of Sidmouth. The appointment was a\r\ndeparture from the established constitutional practice. Since Lord\r\nMansfield, who had ceased to be an efficient member in 1765, no chief\r\njustice had been a member of the cabinet, and it was argued in\r\nparliament by the opposition that a seat in the cabinet was inconsistent\r\nwith the independence which a common law judge ought to maintain. It is\r\nalso important to observe that Sidmouth when accepting office gave\r\nexpress notice to Grenville and Fox that under all circumstances \"he\r\nwould ever resist the catholic question\".[31]\r\n\r\nThe friendly relations of the king with Fox were creditable to both of\r\nthem, and in the last few months of his life Fox showed himself a\r\nstatesman. Besides the abolition of the slave trade, his grand object\r\nwas the restoration of peace on a durable basis. There were some grounds\r\nfor believing that this was possible. France, under an emperor, seemed\r\nno longer to represent a new principle in European politics, and was not\r\nnecessarily a menace to her neighbours; the coalition was fairly beaten\r\non land, while British supremacy had been reasserted on sea, and\r\nNapoleon might well wish for peace to enable him to consolidate his\r\nposition on land and regain the power of using the sea, just as he had\r\ndone in 1801. Fox lost no time in renewing a pacific correspondence with\r\nTalleyrand, afterwards carried on through the agency of Lord Yarmouth,\r\nan English traveller detained in France, and Lord Lauderdale, who was\r\nsent over as plenipotentiary. The principle of the negotiation was that\r\nof _uti possidetis_, but it failed, as Whitworth's efforts had failed,\r\nbecause the pretensions of France were constantly shifting, and\r\nespecially because France, anxious to isolate Great Britain, insisted on\r\nnegotiating separately with Great Britain and Russia, while Fox very\r\nproperly refused to make peace without our ally. Grey himself, now Lord\r\nHowick, afterwards declared that France showed no disposition to grant\r\nany terms which could be accepted by Great Britain. On September 13, Fox\r\ndied, and was buried in Westminster Abbey almost side by side with his\r\ngreat rival.\r\n\r\nWhile he was earnestly striving for peace, there was no cessation of\r\nwarlike movements or political changes either in Central Europe or in\r\nItaly. In June, 1806, Napoleon converted the Batavian Republic into the\r\nkingdom of Holland, over which he set his brother Louis. In July the\r\ndiscord of Germany, which had long ceased to be a nation, was\r\nconsummated by the formation of the Confederation of the Rhine, which\r\nseparated all the western states from the Holy Roman empire, and united\r\nthem under the protection and control of France. On August 6, Francis\r\nII., who had assumed the title of Emperor of Austria in 1804, formally\r\nrenounced the title of Roman Emperor, and the Holy Roman Empire became\r\nextinct. The King of Prussia, with singular disregard of good faith and\r\nnational interest, finally accepted on February 15 the bribe of Hanover\r\nfor adhesion to France, but without the offensive and defensive alliance\r\noffered him in the previous December, and with the additional\r\nhumiliation of being compelled to close his ports to English ships. He\r\nvainly strove to conceal this shameful bargain, and was, as will be\r\nseen, punished by the destruction of Prussian commerce. After all, he\r\nfound himself overreached by Napoleon in duplicity, and was at last\r\nprovoked into risking a single-handed contest with his imperious ally.\r\nHe declared war on October 1, and within a fortnight the army of\r\nPrussia, inheriting the system and traditions of the great Frederick,\r\nwas all but annihilated in the twin battles of Jena and Auerstädt fought\r\non October 14.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _SMALL EXPEDITIONS._]\r\n\r\nThe British government, though not unwilling to forgive the perfidy of\r\nits former confederate, was powerless to strike a blow on his behalf\r\nuntil it was too late. Indeed, the only warlike operation undertaken by\r\nGreat Britain in Europe during the year was in the extreme south of\r\nItaly. Ferdinand, King of the Two Sicilies, had been driven out of his\r\ncapital to make way for Joseph Bonaparte, who entered Naples on February\r\n15, and the exiled monarch took refuge in the island of Sicily. In\r\naccordance with the shortsighted policy of small expeditions, a British\r\nforce under Sir John Stuart was landed in Calabria to raise the\r\npeasantry, and on July 4, defeated the French at the point of the\r\nbayonet in the battle of Maida. This action shook the confidence of\r\nEurope in the superiority of the French infantry, and saved Sicily from\r\nFrance, but the French troops remained in possession of the Italian\r\nmainland. The prestige of Great Britain was raised by the conquest of\r\nthe Dutch colony of the Cape of Good Hope in January by a naval and\r\nmilitary force sent out by Pitt under the command of Sir Home Popham and\r\nGeneral, now Sir David, Baird, but was damaged by a futile expedition to\r\nSouth America, undertaken by Popham without orders from the home\r\ngovernment. The city of Buenos Ayres was taken, indeed, in June by\r\nGeneral Beresford, but it was retaken by the Spaniards in August, and\r\nsoldiers who could ill be spared from the European conflict now\r\nimpending were lavished on a chimerical project on the other side of the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nThe short administration of Grenville, so inactive in its foreign\r\npolicy, is memorable only for one redeeming measure of home-policy--the\r\nabolition of the slave trade. Before Fox's death, the attention of\r\nparliament had been divided mainly between Windham's abortive scheme\r\nfor a vast standing army, to be raised on the basis of limited service,\r\nand the secret inquiry into the conduct of the Princess of Wales. This\r\nresulted in her being acquitted of the more scandalous charges against\r\nher, but on the advice of the cabinet, she was censured by the king for\r\nunseemly levity of behaviour. On October 24 parliament was dissolved. It\r\nwas a foolish dissolution, for ministerial convenience only, and aimed\r\nnot merely at strengthening the ministry, but at weakening the tory\r\nsection within the ministry. The election was not well managed, and the\r\nking withheld the subscription of £12,000 with which he was accustomed\r\nto assist his ministers for the time being at a general election. Still\r\nthe ministry obtained a considerable majority.[32] The new parliament\r\nmet on December 15, and on March 25, 1807, the abolition bill, having\r\npassed the house of lords in spite of strong opposition, was carried in\r\nthe commons by 283 to 16. Thus ended a philanthropic struggle, which\r\nbegan in 1783, when the quakers petitioned against the trade. Three\r\nyears later Clarkson began his crusade. Two bills in favour of abolition\r\nwere carried by the house of commons before the close of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, but were thrown out in the house of lords. The same fate befell\r\na bill for a temporary suspension of the slave trade, which passed the\r\ncommons in 1804 under the spell of Wilberforce's persuasive eloquence;\r\nbut Pitt's government caused a royal proclamation to be issued, which at\r\nleast checked the spread of the nefarious traffic in the newly conquered\r\ncolonies. A larger measure failed to pass the house of commons in 1805,\r\nbut in 1806 Fox and Grenville succeeded in committing both houses to an\r\nopen condemnation of the trade. This was followed on March 25, 1807, by\r\nan enactment entirely prohibiting the slave trade from and after January\r\n1, 1808, though it was not made felony to engage in it until a further\r\nact was carried by Brougham in 1811.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _FALL OF GRENVILLE'S MINISTRY._]\r\n\r\nIn default of important legislative tasks, the parliament which expired\r\nin 1806 devoted much attention to various features of the military\r\nsystem, as well as to proposed reforms in the public accounts. It\r\nsanctioned the principle of raising a great part of the war-expenses by\r\nspecial taxes rather than by loan. A property-tax of 10 per cent. was\r\nfreely voted, and this was then represented to be its permanent limit.\r\nThe assessed taxes were increased at the same time by 10 per cent., but\r\nwith an allowance in favour of poorer taxpayers for every child above\r\nthe number of two. It is worthy of notice that, while Grenville's\r\nministry was in office, Whitbread brought forward an elaborate plan not\r\nonly for reforming the poor laws but also for establishing a system of\r\nnational education. Some changes in the cabinet were necessitated by the\r\ndeath of Fox. Howick became foreign secretary and was succeeded at the\r\nadmiralty by Thomas Grenville, brother of the prime minister, most\r\nfamous as a book-collector. Fitzwilliam retired at the same time on the\r\nground of ill-health. He retained his seat in the cabinet, but was\r\nsucceeded as lord president by Sidmouth, while Fox's nephew, Lord\r\nHolland, succeeded Sidmouth as lord privy seal.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the whig government in March, 1807, was due to a cause\r\nsimilar to that which had brought about the retirement of Pitt in 1801.\r\nThe Duke of Bedford, who was lord lieutenant of Ireland, had urged the\r\nimportance of making some concessions to Roman catholics. An Irish act\r\nof 1793 had opened commissions in the army as high as the rank of\r\ncolonel to Roman catholics, and the ministry obtained the reluctant\r\nconsent of the king to the extension of this concession to Roman\r\ncatholics throughout his dominions. Without having fully ascertained the\r\nking's mind, Howick, on behalf of his colleagues, moved for leave to\r\nbring in a bill opening all commissions in the army and navy to Roman\r\ncatholics. The king at once refused his sanction, and the government,\r\nfinding that they could not carry their bill, agreed to withdraw it.\r\nThis decision was announced to the king in a cabinet minute, drawn up at\r\na meeting from which Ellenborough, Erskine, and Sidmouth, who\r\nsympathised with the king, were excluded, and from which Fitzwilliam and\r\nSpencer were absent owing to ill-health. The minute went on to record\r\ntheir adhesion to the policy embodied in the bill, reserving the right\r\nto advise the king on any future occasion in accordance with that\r\npolicy. Thereupon, Sidmouth, who had already sent in his resignation,\r\nEldon, Portland, and Malmesbury, with the concurrence of the Duke of\r\nYork and Spencer Perceval, urged the king to make a stand upon his\r\nprerogative. He did so, by requiring the ministers who had signed the\r\nminute, to give him a written pledge that they would never press upon\r\nhim further concessions, direct or indirect, to the Roman catholics.\r\nThis pledge they properly declined, and accepted the consequence by\r\nresignation. Spencer was present at the meeting which arrived at this\r\nconclusion and concurred in the decision of his colleagues.[33]\r\n\r\nA new administration was formed by Portland, as nominal head, but with\r\nPerceval as its real leader and chancellor of the exchequer, Canning as\r\nforeign secretary, Hawkesbury as home secretary, and Castlereagh as\r\nminister for war and the colonies. Camden, Eldon, Westmorland, and\r\nChatham resumed the offices they had held before the death of Pitt,\r\nMulgrave became first lord of the admiralty, and Earl Bathurst president\r\nof the board of trade. In this government, too, Sir Arthur Wellesley,\r\nthe future Duke of Wellington, who had returned in 1805 from a brilliant\r\nmilitary career in India, held office outside the cabinet as chief\r\nsecretary for Ireland. Spencer Perceval was a half-brother of the Earl\r\nof Egmont and brother of Lord Arden. He enjoyed a large practice at the\r\nbar and had made his mark as a parliamentary debater when filling the\r\noffices, first of solicitor-general, and then of attorney-general under\r\nAddington. He had held the latter office again under Pitt. Not the least\r\nsource of his influence was his steady and determined opposition to the\r\nRoman catholic claims.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _NON-INTERVENTION._]\r\n\r\nAfter a short but animated debate on the important constitutional\r\nquestion raised by the circumstances of the change of ministers,\r\nparliament was again dissolved on April 27. The king's speech in closing\r\nthe session was virtually a personal appeal to his people, and a\r\nmajority was returned in favour of the new ministry. This result may be\r\nsaid to mark the last triumph of George III. in maintaining the\r\nprinciple of personal government. \"A just and enlightened toleration\"\r\nwas announced as the substitute for catholic relief. Still, a certain\r\nrevival of independent popular opinion may be traced in the return of\r\nSir Francis Burdett and Lord Cochrane for Westminster. It was not until\r\nJune 22 that parliament assembled, and the engrossing interest of\r\nforeign events left but little room for discussions on home-policy. A\r\nmotion by Whitbread, however, bore fruit in a bill for establishing\r\nparochial schools, which Eldon successfully opposed in the house of\r\nlords, mainly on the ground that it would take popular education out of\r\nthe hands of the clergy. The same not unnatural apathy about home\r\naffairs prevailed throughout the session of 1808, which began on January\r\n31, and though a large number of acts were placed on the statute book in\r\nthis and succeeding years, the mass of them, including many relating to\r\nIreland, were essentially of a local or occasional character. An\r\nexception must be recognised in the partial success of a motion for the\r\nreform of the criminal law, which was proposed by Sir Samuel Romilly,\r\nfamous for his efforts in the cause of humanity, and which resulted in\r\nthe abolition of capital punishment for the offence of pocket-picking.\r\n\r\nDuring this critical period, when Great Britain was gradually drifting\r\ninto a position of isolation, the course of parliamentary history\r\nbecomes inseparable from the progress of those mighty events on the\r\ncontinent, which Grenville's government would fain have treated as\r\noutside the sphere of British interests. For, notwithstanding Windham's\r\nschemes for a reconstruction of the army, that government had allowed\r\nthe naval and military establishments of Great Britain to fall below\r\ntheir former standard. The leading idea of their policy was\r\nnon-intervention, and at the opening of 1807, there was no longer any\r\nthought of sending a force to cope with Napoleon's veterans on the\r\ncontinent When in 1805 a British force was operating in North Germany,\r\nit was possible that if Prussia had been faithful to her engagements,\r\nthe disaster of Austerlitz might at least have been partially retrieved.\r\nIt was otherwise when, after the collapse of Prussia, France and Russia\r\nstood face to face with each other. The drawn battle of Eylau in East\r\nPrussia, marked by fearful carnage, was fought on February 8, 1807. This\r\ncheck, breaking the spell of Napoleon's victorious career, had a\r\nremarkable effect in raising the spirits of the allies, Russia, Sweden,\r\nand Prussia, some remains of whose army were still in the field. These\r\npowers now drew closer together, but they received a lukewarm support\r\nfrom Great Britain, which might have done much to save Europe by timely\r\nreinforcements and liberal subsidies. In reply to an urgent appeal from\r\nthe tsar for a loan of £6,000,000, the Grenville ministry doled out\r\n£500,000 to Russia, and a still more pitiful gift to Prussia. No troops\r\nwere sent to aid Sweden on the Baltic coast, although, when, at\r\nNapoleon's instigation, Turkey declared war against Russia, expeditions\r\nwere despatched to Alexandria and the Dardanelles. The notion of making\r\nwar on a large scale, in concert with allies, on the continent of\r\nEurope, as in the days of Marlborough, and even of Lord Granby, seems to\r\nhave vanished from the minds of English statesmen, except Castlereagh,\r\nwho always advocated concentrated action.\r\n\r\nThe succession of Portland and Canning to Grenville and Howick brought\r\nno immediate change in our insular policy and the new government had\r\nbeen in office for above three months before a British force at last\r\nappeared in the Swedish island of Rügen. It arrived too late, Danzig\r\nsurrendered in May, and on June 14 Napoleon obtained a decisive victory\r\nover the Russian army and its Prussian contingent at Friedland. Russia\r\nnow gave a supreme example of that national selfishness, and contempt\r\nfor the rights of independent states which had dominated the counsels of\r\nsovereigns ever since the first partition of Poland. Doubtless the tsar\r\nmight plead that Great Britain, too, had been wasting her strength in\r\nselfish attempts to secure her mastery of the seas, and to open new\r\nmarkets for her trade. He also deeply resented her recent failure to aid\r\nhim in the hour of his utmost need, while he still cherished the policy\r\nof the \"armed neutrality,\" and was eager to prosecute his designs\r\nagainst Turkey. Dazzled and flattered by Napoleon, he welcomed overtures\r\nfor peace at the expense of Great Britain, and there is no doubt that\r\nhis imaginative nature indulged in the vision of a regenerated Europe,\r\ndivided between himself as emperor of the east and Napoleon as emperor\r\nof the west. It is therefore far from surprising that he should have\r\nheld a private interview with Napoleon, on a raft in the Niemen, which\r\nled to the treaty of Tilsit on July 7.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE TREATY OF TILSIT._]\r\n\r\nThis treaty, in which the King of Prussia shared as a helpless partner,\r\ncontained both public and secret articles, but the distinction was not\r\nvery material, for the secret articles almost immediately became known\r\nto Canning. The general effect of the whole agreement was the utter\r\nhumiliation of Prussia, the recognition by that country and Russia of\r\nall Napoleon's acquisitions, and their combination with France against\r\nthe maritime claims and conquests of Great Britain. The western\r\nprovinces of Prussia were to be incorporated with other German\r\nannexations to form the new kingdom of Westphalia; Prussian Poland was\r\nto be converted into the duchy of Warsaw under the crown of Saxony, to\r\nwhich a right of passage through Silesia was reserved; and Berlin with\r\nother great Prussian fortresses were to remain in the hands of the\r\nFrench until an exorbitant war indemnity should have been paid.[34] At\r\none stroke Prussia was thus reduced to a second-rate power, with a\r\nterritory little greater than it possessed before the first partition of\r\nPoland. The rule of Joseph Bonaparte at Naples, that of Louis in\r\nHolland, and the confederation of the Rhine, were solemnly confirmed.\r\nAbove all, Russia pledged herself to join France in coercing Sweden,\r\nDenmark, and Portugal into an adoption of the organised commercial\r\nexclusion, known as the \"continental system,\" and hostility to Great\r\nBritain in the event of her resistance. If Sweden refused to join this\r\nleague, Denmark was to be compelled to declare war on her.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did it receive information of this alliance than the British\r\ngovernment despatched a naval armament to Denmark and landed troops,\r\nwhich were soon reinforced by those withdrawn from Rügen. There had been\r\nno open rupture with Denmark, though much irritation existed between\r\nDenmark and Great Britain with reference to neutral commerce. But there\r\nwere the best reasons for believing that the Danish fleet, as well as\r\nthat of Portugal, would be demanded by France and Russia, to be employed\r\nagainst Great Britain, and it was certain that Denmark could not\r\nwithstand such pressure. The British envoy, Jackson, was accordingly\r\ninstructed to offer Denmark a treaty of alliance, of which one condition\r\nwas to be the deposit of her fleet on hire with the British government.\r\nThe proposal was accompanied by a threat of force, and the crown prince,\r\nwith a spirit worthy of admiration, refused the terms. In consequence a\r\nperemptory summons to deliver up her ships of war and naval stores was\r\naddressed to the governor of Copenhagen by the British commanders,\r\nAdmiral Gambier and Lord Cathcart, under whom Sir Arthur Wellesley was\r\nentrusted with the reserve. The surrender, if made peaceably, was to be\r\nin the nature of a deposit, and the fleet was to be restored at the end\r\nof the war. The governor returned a temporising reply, and a bombardment\r\nof Copenhagen followed (September 2); the fleet was brought to England\r\nas prize of war; and Denmark naturally became the enemy of Great\r\nBritain.[35] Sweden declined the proffered alliance of France and\r\nRussia, and actually invaded Norway, then a part of the Danish kingdom.\r\nThe result was the loss of Finland and Swedish Pomerania. The king,\r\nGustavus IV., resembled Charles XII. in quixotic temperament, but not in\r\nability; and Sir John Moore, sent to his support with an army of 10,000\r\nmen, found it hopeless to co-operate with him. Shortly afterwards, his\r\nsubjects formed the same opinion, and he was compelled to make way for\r\nhis uncle, who succeeded as Charles XIII. with Marshal Bernadotte as\r\ncrown prince. In consequence of this change Sweden became reconciled to\r\nRussia, and estranged from Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe seizure of the Danish fleet, in time of so-called peace, roused\r\ngreat indignation throughout most of Europe, and, in some degree,\r\nstrained the conscience of the British parliament itself. The justice\r\nand wisdom of it were strenuously challenged in both houses, especially\r\nby Grenville, Sidmouth, and Lord Darnley, who moved an address to the\r\ncrown embodying an impressive protest against it. It was defended,\r\nhowever, by the high authority of the Marquis Wellesley, as well as by\r\nCanning and other ministers, on the simple ground of military necessity.\r\nNapoleon himself never ceased to denounce it as an international outrage\r\nof the highest enormity. This did not prevent his doing his best to\r\njustify it and to imitate it by sending Junot's expedition to Portugal,\r\nwith instructions to seize the Portuguese fleet at Lisbon. It is strange\r\nthat in the debates on this subject, peace with France was still treated\r\non both sides as a possibility; but Canning declared that neither\r\nRussian nor Austrian mediation could have been accepted as impartial,\r\nor as affording the least hope of pacification. However, on September\r\n25, the king addressed a declaration to Europe, in which, after\r\njustifying himself in regard to Copenhagen, he professed his readiness\r\nto accept conditions of peace \"consistent with the maritime rights and\r\npolitical existence of Great Britain\".\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _COMMERCIAL EXCLUSION._]\r\n\r\nStill more reasonable attacks, supported by strong petitions, were made\r\nby the opposition upon the \"orders in council,\" whereby the British\r\ngovernment retaliated against Napoleon's \"continental system\". This\r\nsystem was founded on a firm belief, shared by the French people, that\r\nGreat Britain, as mistress of the seas, was the one great obstacle to\r\nhis imperial ambition, and the most formidable enemy of French\r\naggrandisement, only to be crushed by the ruin of her trade. Prussia\r\nhad, in conformity with her treaty of February 15, 1806, issued a\r\nproclamation on March 28 of that year, closing her ports, which would\r\nnow include those of Hanover, against British trade. The British\r\ngovernment replied by first laying an embargo on Prussian vessels in the\r\nharbours of Great Britain and Ireland, and by proclaiming a blockade of\r\nthe coast of Europe from Brest to the Elbe. This was followed on May 14\r\nby an order in council for seizing all vessels found navigating under\r\nPrussian colours. As yet the policy of commercial exclusion had not been\r\ncarried to any great length, but the Berlin decree issued by Napoleon on\r\nNovember 21 after the battle of Jena proclaimed the whole of the British\r\nIsles to be in a state of blockade, prohibited all commerce with them\r\nfrom the ports of France and her dependent states, confiscated all\r\nBritish merchandise in such ports, and declared all British subjects in\r\ncountries occupied by French troops to be prisoners of war. Howick\r\nreplied by further orders in council in January, 1807, forbidding\r\nneutrals to trade between the ports of France and her allies, or between\r\nthe ports of nations which should observe the Berlin decree, on pain of\r\nthe confiscation of the ship and cargo. On the 27th another decree,\r\nissued at Warsaw, ordered the seizure in the Hanse Towns of all British\r\ngoods and colonial produce. The reply of Great Britain was a stricter\r\nblockade of the North German coast.\r\n\r\nThe accession of Russia to Napoleon's commercial policy at Tilsit seemed\r\nto have brought the combination against British trade to its furthest\r\ndevelopment, and it was answered by new orders in council, treating any\r\nport from which the British flag was excluded as if actually blockaded,\r\nand further limiting the carriage by neutral vessels of produce from\r\nhostile colonies. The Milan decree issued on December 17, and further\r\norders in council published during the same winter, carried to greater\r\nextremes, if possible, this intolerable form of commercial warfare,\r\nunder which neutral commerce was gradually crushed out of existence.\r\nGreat Britain, owing to her command of the sea, was more independent of\r\nthis kind of commerce than her rival, and both the decrees and the\r\norders in council inflicted far more damage on France and her allies\r\nthan on Great Britain. But neither party was able to enforce completely\r\nits policy of commercial exclusion. Europe could not dispense with\r\nBritish goods or colonial produce carried in British vessels. The law\r\nwas deliberately set aside by a regular licensing system, and evaded by\r\nwholesale smuggling; neutral ships continued to ply between continental\r\nports, and Napoleon did not disdain to clothe his troops with 50,000\r\nBritish overcoats during the Eylau campaign. Still, Great Britain was\r\nenabled to cripple, if not to destroy, the merchant shipping of all\r\nother countries, and the interests of consumers all over Europe were\r\nenlisted against the author of the continental system. On the other\r\nhand, a heavy blow was dealt to friendly relations between Great Britain\r\nand the United States, the chief victim of these belligerent\r\npretensions.[36]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _FRUITLESS EXPEDITIONS._]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the prestige of Great Britain had been injured by three\r\npetty and abortive expeditions projected by the Grenville ministry. The\r\nfirst of these was sent out to complete the conquest of Buenos Ayres,\r\nthe recapture of which was unknown in England. Sir Samuel Auchmuty, who\r\ncommanded it, finding himself too late to occupy that city, attacked and\r\ntook Monte Video by storm with much skill and spirit, on February 3,\r\n1807. Shortly afterwards, he was superseded by General Whitelocke,\r\nbringing reinforcements, with orders to recover Buenos Ayres. In this he\r\nsignally failed, owing to gross tactical errors. The British troops were\r\nalmost passively slaughtered in the streets, and Whitelocke agreed to\r\nwithdraw the remains of his force, and give up Monte Video, on condition\r\nof all prisoners being surrendered. On his return home, he was tried by\r\na court-martial and cashiered, being also declared \"totally unfit to\r\nserve his majesty in any military capacity whatever\".\r\n\r\nEqually ill-managed was the naval expedition, directed to support\r\nRussia, then in close alliance with Great Britain, by coercing the\r\nsultan into a rupture with France. Collingwood, who was not consulted,\r\nwas required to entrust the command of this expedition, which started in\r\nFebruary, 1807, to Sir John Duckworth. Everything depended on\r\npromptitude, and the admiral found little difficulty in forcing the\r\npassage of the Dardanelles, as it was then almost unfortified. Having\r\nreached Constantinople, he allowed himself to waste time in fruitless\r\nnegotiations, contrary to Collingwood's earnest advice, and not only\r\neffected nothing but gravely imperilled his return. Instructed by the\r\nFrench minister Sébastiani, the Turks had armed their coasts, and\r\nerected batteries along the Dardanelles, through which the British fleet\r\nmade its way with considerable loss. Instead of being detached from the\r\nFrench alliance, the Porte was thrown into its arms and became more\r\nembittered than ever against Russia. It was soon involved in a serious\r\nconflict with that country--for the possession of Wallachia and\r\nMoldavia--only to be deserted again by France under the compact made at\r\nTilsit. The expedition to Egypt, planned in combination with the\r\nexpedition to the Dardanelles, ended in a still worse disaster. Though\r\nGeneral Fraser, its commander, was able to surprise Alexandria on March\r\n30, he awaited in vain the expected news of Duckworth's success; he\r\nproceeded to attack Rosetta with as little generalship as Whitelocke had\r\nshown at Buenos Ayres, and encountered a similar repulse. An attempt to\r\nbesiege the town met with no better fortune: the British troops\r\nsubmitted to a capitulation, evacuated Egypt, and sailed for Sicily in\r\nSeptember, 1807. In an imperial manifesto addressed to the French nation\r\nat the end of this year, the British failures at Buenos Ayres,\r\nConstantinople, and Alexandria were paraded, together with our alleged\r\ncrime against the rights of nations at Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nIn the early months of 1808 the continental system was extended by the\r\nestablishment of French administration at Rome, and the annexation of\r\nthe eastern ports of the Papal States to the kingdom of Italy. On\r\nFebruary 18 of the same year Austria under French pressure adopted the\r\nsystem. Sweden and Turkey were now the only continental countries left\r\noutside it, but the retention of Sicily by the Bourbon king rendered it\r\neasy for British commerce to enter Italy through that island. The\r\nirritation of neutrals increased as the area of commercial exclusion\r\nwidened, but the United States were now the only neutral power of any\r\nconsequence. After April 17 Napoleon took the high-handed step of\r\nconfiscating all American shipping in his ports. In spite of this\r\naggression, the president and congress of the United States continued to\r\nfavour France against Great Britain. The story of the commercial warfare\r\nbetween Great Britain and the United States will be related more fully\r\nhereafter. For the present, it is sufficient to mention that an act,\r\nplacing an embargo on foreign vessels in American ports, was passed by\r\ncongress on December 22, 1807, and another on March 1, 1809, forbidding\r\ncommercial intercourse with Great Britain and France and the colonies\r\noccupied by them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Great Britain continued to enforce her maritime rights,\r\nincluding that of searching American merchantmen for British-born\r\nsailors, and impressing them at the will of British naval officers.\r\nThese grievances ultimately led to a war between Great Britain and\r\nAmerica in 1812. The continental system, however, did not long remain so\r\ncomplete as in the beginning of 1808. Junot's expedition to Portugal had\r\nled to a French occupation of that country before the end of 1807. The\r\nconquest of Portugal was followed, as we shall see later, by a partial\r\nconquest of Spain. This threw the Spaniards back upon the British\r\nalliance and afforded an opportunity for the liberation of Portugal, so\r\nthat from May, 1808, Great Britain once more had a large seaboard open\r\nto her commerce. The early success of the Spanish resistance to France,\r\nand other events in the peninsula hereafter to be recorded, encouraged\r\nAustria to arm again; and on the news of the capitulation of the French\r\narmy at Baylen in July, she pushed forward her preparations with\r\nredoubled energy. A national movement arose simultaneously in North\r\nGermany, but the Prussian government dared not head it so long as\r\nRussia remained faithful to the French alliance.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _NAPOLEON AT ERFURT._]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding a peremptory declaration from the tsar after the seizure\r\nof the Danish fleet, Russia had nothing to gain by war with Great\r\nBritain. She was bound to France by the prospect held forth to her at\r\nTilsit of the conquest of Finland and the partition of Turkey, but she\r\nwas inwardly desirous of peace with Great Britain. Napoleon, on the\r\nother hand, saw in the partition of Turkey an opportunity of striking at\r\nIndia, and had actually given orders for naval preparations to be made\r\nin Spain, when all thought of eastern conquest had to be postponed owing\r\nto the success of the Spanish patriots. After a conference between\r\nNapoleon and the tsar at Erfurt a secret convention was signed on\r\nOctober 12, by which France sanctioned Russian conquests in Finland and\r\nthe Danubian provinces, and Russia recognised the Bonaparte dynasty in\r\nSpain and promised to assist France in a defensive war against Austria.\r\nThe two powers despatched a joint note to Great Britain inviting her to\r\nmake peace, on the principle of _uti possidetis_. Canning replied that\r\nhe was prepared to negotiate if his allies, especially Sweden and the\r\nSpanish patriots, who were at that time in actual possession of almost\r\nthe entire country, were included in the peace. On November 19 Napoleon\r\nexpressed his willingness to treat with the British allies, but not with\r\nthe Spanish \"rebels,\" as he styled them. Alexander took up a similar\r\nposition, speaking of the Spanish \"insurgents,\" and expressly\r\nrecognising Joseph as King of Spain. Thus ended these pacific overtures,\r\nand on November 3 the official _exposé_, annually issued in Paris,\r\ndescribed Great Britain as \"the enemy of the world\".\r\n\r\nThe year 1808 is memorable in English history for the active\r\nintervention of Great Britain in the affairs of Spain which developed\r\ninto the \"Peninsular war\".[37] This intervention was rendered possible\r\nand effective by the organisation of our army system in 1807, which was\r\ndue to Castlereagh, though he received little credit for it. Under this\r\nsystem, the old constitutional force of the militia was made the basis\r\nof the whole military establishment. By the militia balloting bill and\r\nthe militia transfer bill, that force, largely composed of substitutes,\r\nand bound only to home-service, was practically converted into a\r\nrecruiting-ground for the regular army, and proved sufficient to make\r\ngood all the losses incurred during the long campaigns in Portugal and\r\nSpain. The army thus raised contained, no doubt, many soldiers of bad\r\ncharacter, whose misdeeds, after the furious excitement of an escalade,\r\nor under the heart-breaking stress of a retreat, sometimes brought\r\ndisgrace upon the British name. But these men, side by side with\r\nsteadier comrades, bore themselves like heroes on many a bloodstained\r\nfield; they quailed not before the conquering legions of Austerlitz and\r\nWagram; they could \"go anywhere or do anything\" under trusted leaders;\r\nand they restored the military reputation of their country before the\r\neyes of Europe. To have forged such an instrument of war was no mean\r\nadministrative exploit. To have maintained its efficiency steadily on\r\nthe whole, though sometimes with a faint-hearted parsimony, and to have\r\nloyally supported its commander against the cavils of a factious\r\nopposition superior in parliamentary ability, for a period of seven\r\nyears, must be held to redeem the tory government from the charge of\r\npolitical weakness.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _PARLIAMENTARY ZEAL._]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1809, however, the interest of parliament was less\r\nconcentrated on Sir Arthur Wellesley's first campaign in Portugal, or\r\neven on the convention of Cintra, than on the scandals attaching to the\r\noffice of commander-in-chief, held by the Duke of York. Though an\r\nincapable general, the duke had shown himself, on the whole, an\r\nexcellent administrator, and in the opinion of the best officers had\r\ndone much for the discipline and efficiency of the British army.\r\nUnfortunately, Mrs. Clarke, his former mistress, had received bribes for\r\nusing her influence with the duke to procure military appointments.\r\nColonel Wardle, an obscure member of parliament, to whom Mrs. Clarke had\r\ntemporarily transferred herself after being discarded by the duke,\r\nanimated by a desire to damage the ministry, came forward with charges\r\ndirectly implicating him in her corrupt practices, and incidentally\r\nbrought similar accusations against Portland and Eldon. The government\r\nfoolishly agreed to an inquiry on the Duke of York's behalf, and it was\r\nconducted before a committee of the whole house, which sat from January\r\n26 to March 20. In the course of this inquiry, Sir Arthur Wellesley\r\nbore strong testimony in his favour, and the duke addressed a letter to\r\nthe speaker, declaring his innocence of corruption. Though Wardle and\r\nhis associates pressed for his dismissal, Perceval ultimately carried a\r\nmotion acquitting him not only of corruption but of connivance with\r\ncorruption. The majority, however, was small, and the duke thought it\r\nnecessary to resign on March 20, whereupon the house of commons decided\r\nto proceed no further. A curious sequel of this case was an action\r\nagainst Wardle by an upholsterer, who had furnished a house for Mrs.\r\nClarke by Wardle's orders, in consideration of her services in giving\r\nhostile evidence against her former protector. The plaintiff obtained\r\n£2,000 damages, and the law-suit was the means of producing a reaction\r\nin popular feeling in favour of the duke.\r\n\r\nThis scandal in high places quickened the zeal of parliament for general\r\npurity of administration, and led to a disclosure of some grave abuses.\r\nOne of these, connected with the disposal of captured Dutch property,\r\ndated as far back as 1795. Others were found to exist in the navy\r\ndepartment and the distribution of Indian patronage; others related to\r\nparliamentary elections. Perceval brought in a bill to check the sale\r\nand brokerage of offices, nor did Castlereagh himself escape the charge\r\nof having procured the election of Lord Clancarty to parliament by the\r\noffer of an Indian writership to a borough-monger. A frank explanation\r\nsaved him from censure, especially as it appeared that the offer had\r\nnever taken effect. The charge was renewed, in a different form, against\r\nboth him and Perceval, and their accusers moved for a trial at bar. But\r\nas it turned out that undue influence rather than corruption was their\r\nalleged offence, and as the avowed object of the resolution was to force\r\non parliamentary reform, it was negatived by an immense majority.\r\nNevertheless, the object was not wholly defeated.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the Duke of York from the command of the army was\r\nsingularly inopportune, for Sir David Dundas had scarcely been appointed\r\nas his successor when a juncture arose specially demanding a combination\r\nof energy and experience. The British government, already engaged in the\r\nPeninsular war, had at last resolved to take a vigorous part in the new\r\nand desperate struggle between France and Austria in Southern Germany.\r\nThe latent spirit of German nationality, aroused by Napoleon's ruthless\r\ntreatment of Prussia, and quickened into a flame by sympathy with the\r\nuprising in Spain, was embodied in the secret association of the\r\n_Tugendbund_; and Austria, smarting under a sense of her own\r\nhumiliation, mustered up courage to assume the leadership of a national\r\nmovement. South Germany, governed by old dynasties, which profited by\r\nthe French alliance, displayed as yet no symptoms of disaffection to\r\nFrance; but in North Germany the old dynasties had been either humbled\r\nor deposed, and the general ferment among the people, needed, as the\r\nAustrians believed, only the presence of a regular army to break out\r\ninto a national revolt against the foreigner. Prussia, it is true, was\r\nstill unwilling to move, because Russia was hostile; but the Austrian\r\ncourt knew well the lukewarmness of Russia's attachment to France, and\r\nhoped that a national upheaval would carry the Prussian government along\r\nwith it. No one, in fact, had played a more active part in rousing\r\nNorthern Germany than the Prussian minister, Stein, whom Frederick\r\nWilliam, by Napoleon's advice, had called to his councils after Tilsit,\r\nand who was now compelled to resign his office and take refuge in\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _NAPOLEON IN AUSTRIA._]\r\n\r\nThe British government was aware of the situation in Germany when it\r\nreceived a request in January, 1809, for the despatch of a British force\r\nto the mouth of the Elbe. Austria was, however, still nominally at war\r\nwith Great Britain, and George III., perhaps not unreasonably, refused\r\nto give her active military assistance till peace was concluded.\r\nMeanwhile a subsidy of £250,000 in bullion was despatched to Trieste,\r\nand inquiries were set on foot as to the means of supplying such a\r\nmilitary expedition as Austria desired.[38] On March 22, Dundas, who had\r\nonly been a few days in office as commander-in-chief, reported that\r\n15,000 men could not be spared from home service, and, in consequence,\r\nno extensive preparations were made until the muster rolls in June\r\nshowed that 40,000 troops might safely be employed abroad. This\r\nconvinced the government that a large force could be sent without\r\ninterfering with home defence, as Castlereagh had long contended; and\r\nthroughout June and July the naval and military departments were busy in\r\npreparing for what has since left a sinister memory as the Walcheren\r\nexpedition. Meanwhile, as if the passion of frittering away resources\r\nwere irresistible, a smaller force was despatched, as a kind of feint,\r\nagainst the kingdom of Naples. It consisted of 15,000 British troops and\r\na body of Sicilians. Bailing from Palermo early in June it captured the\r\nislands of Ischia and Procida and the castle of Scylla, and threw Naples\r\ninto consternation. But the attack was not pushed, and it was too late\r\nto be of any assistance to the Austrians who had already been expelled\r\nfrom the Italian peninsula. At last, in July, the treaty of peace with\r\nAustria was signed and the great armament was ready to sail.\r\n\r\nBut Napoleon had not awaited the deliberations of British statesmen.\r\nHurrying back from Spain, he remained in Paris only long enough to\r\norganise a campaign in South Germany, and left the capital to join his\r\narmies on April 13. A week earlier, the Archduke Charles, having\r\nremodelled the Austrian army, issued a proclamation affirming Austria to\r\nbe the champion of European liberty. On the 9th Austria declared war\r\nagainst Bavaria, the ally of France, and her troops crossed the Inn. On\r\nthe 17th, when Napoleon arrived at Donauwörth, he found the archduke in\r\noccupation of Ratisbon. His presence turned the tide, and, after three\r\nvictories, he was once more on the road to Vienna. The most important of\r\nthese victories was that of Eckmühl, and he regarded the manoeuvre by\r\nwhich it was won as the finest in his military career. On May 13 the\r\nFrench entered Vienna, but the Archduke Charles with an army of nearly\r\n200,000 men was facing him on the left bank of the Danube. Napoleon's\r\narmy crossed and encountered the Austrians on the great plain between\r\nAspern and Essling. He was repulsed and fell back upon Lobau, between\r\nwhich and the Vienna side of the Danube the bridge of boats had been\r\nswept away by a rise of the river and by balks of timber floated down by\r\nthe Austrians. In this dangerous position he remained shut up for\r\nseveral weeks. He finally succeeded in throwing across a light bridge by\r\nwhich his army regained the left bank on the night of July 4. Finding\r\ntheir position turned the Austrians took up their stand on the tableland\r\nof Wagram. On July 6 another pitched battle was fought, which, in the\r\nnumber of combatants engaged and in the losses inflicted on both sides,\r\nmust rank with the later conflicts of Borodino and Leipzig. A hard won\r\nvictory rested with the French, but it was not such a victory as that of\r\nAusterlitz or Jena, though it secured the neutrality, at least, of\r\nAustria for the next four years. Her army retreated into Bohemia, and on\r\nJuly 12 an armistice was signed at Znaim in Moravia, which formed the\r\nbasis of a peace concluded at Vienna on October 14.\r\n\r\nNothing remained for Great Britain but to abandon the auxiliary\r\nenterprise so long planned, but so often delayed, or to carry it through\r\nindependently, with little hope of a decisive issue. The latter\r\nalternative was adopted. The very day on which the news of the armistice\r\narrived witnessed the departure of the greatest single armament ever\r\nsent out fully equipped from the shores of Great Britain. The deplorable\r\nfailure of the Walcheren expedition has obscured both its magnitude and\r\nits probable importance had it only proved successful. The command of\r\nthe fleet was given to Sir Richard Strachan, a competent admiral; that\r\nof the army to Chatham, who sat in the cabinet as master-general of the\r\nordnance, an incompetent general, who owed his nomination to royal\r\nfavour. This was the first blunder; the second was the utter neglect of\r\nmedical and sanitary precautions against the notoriously unhealthy\r\nclimate of Walcheren in the autumn months. The armament sailed from the\r\nDowns on July 28, in the finest weather and with a display of intense\r\nnational enthusiasm. It consisted of thirty-five ships of the line, with\r\na swarm of smaller war-vessels and transports, carrying nearly 40,000\r\ntroops, two battering-trains, and a complete apparatus of military\r\nstores. Its destination, though more than suspected by the enemy, had\r\nbeen officially kept secret at home. Castlereagh must be held largely\r\nresponsible for the delays and for the unwise choice of a general which\r\nmarred its success, but he showed true military sagacity in designating\r\nthe point of attack. Inspired by him, the British government,\r\ndistrusting the national movement in North Germany, had decided to\r\nstrike at Antwerp, which Napoleon had supplied with new docks, and\r\nwhich, now that the mouth of the Scheldt had been reopened, threatened\r\nto become the commercial rival of London. The town was entirely\r\nunprepared, and a blow dealt here seemed the best way of doing as much\r\nharm as possible to France and at the same time gaining a national\r\nadvantage for Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE WALCHEREN EXPEDITION._]\r\n\r\nChatham had received very precise instructions from Castlereagh, the\r\nobjects prescribed to him being, (1) the capture or destruction of the\r\nenemy's ships, either building or afloat at Antwerp or Flushing, or\r\nafloat in the Scheldt; (2) the destruction of the arsenals and dockyards\r\nat Antwerp, Terneuze, and Flushing; (3) the reduction of the island of\r\nWalcheren; (4) the rendering of the Scheldt no longer navigable to ships\r\nof war. These objects were named, as far as possible, in the order of\r\ntheir importance, and Chatham was specially directed to land troops at\r\nSandvliet and push on straight to Antwerp, with the view of taking it by\r\na _coup de main_. Napoleon, who clearly foretold the catastrophe\r\nawaiting the British troops in the malarious swamps of Walcheren,\r\nafterwards admitted that Antwerp could have been captured by a sudden\r\nassault. Chatham obeyed his general orders, but, instead of taking them\r\nin the order of importance, gave precedence to the objects which could\r\nmost easily be accomplished. By prompt action the French fleet, which\r\nwas moored off Flushing, might have been captured, but it was allowed to\r\nescape to Antwerp. By August 2 the British were in complete possession\r\nof the mouth of the Scheldt, and had taken Bath opposite Sandvliet,\r\nwhile Antwerp was still almost unprotected. But Chatham concentrated his\r\nattention on the siege of Flushing, which surrendered, after three days'\r\nbombardment, on August 16, contrary to Napoleon's expectation. Antwerp\r\nhad meanwhile been put in a state of defence, and was now protected by\r\nthe enemy's fleet, while French and Dutch troops were pouring down to\r\nthe Scheldt. After ten days of inactivity, Chatham advanced his\r\nheadquarters to Bath, found that further advance was impossible, and\r\nrecommended the government to recall the expedition, leaving 15,000 men\r\nto defend the island of Walcheren. This advice was adopted, but the\r\ngarrison left in Walcheren suffered most severely from fever in that\r\nswampy island. Eventually, on December 24, Walcheren was abandoned, the\r\nworks and naval basins of Flushing having been previously destroyed. The\r\ndestruction of Flushing was the sole result of this expedition.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the British to make any serious impression on the French\r\neither in the Low Countries or in Spain induced Austria to consent to\r\npeace with France. By the peace of Vienna, signed on October 14, she\r\nceded Salzburg and a part of Upper Austria to Bavaria, West Galicia to\r\nthe duchy of Warsaw, and a part of Carinthia with Trieste and the\r\nIllyrian provinces to France. A small strip of Galicia was ceded to the\r\nRussian tsar, who had rendered France some very half-hearted assistance\r\nand was further alienated by the extension of the duchy of Warsaw.\r\nAustria was enslaved to the will of Napoleon. She had abandoned the\r\nTyrolese peasants whose loyal insurrection against the Bavarians was the\r\nmost heroic incident in the war, and she now joined the other nations of\r\nthe continent in excluding the commerce of Great Britain, which had made\r\na powerful diversion in Spain and an imposing though futile diversion on\r\nthe Scheldt to save her from national annihilation.\r\n\r\nWhile the Walcheren expedition was preparing, two additions were made to\r\nthe cabinet. Lord Granville Leveson-Gower, brother of the Marquis of\r\nStafford, was admitted in June as secretary at war, and in July\r\nHarrowby, who was created an earl, became president of the board of\r\ncontrol with a seat in the cabinet. After the fate of the expedition\r\nbecame known, though before its final withdrawal, a serious quarrel took\r\nplace between Canning and Castlereagh. Personal jealousies had long\r\nexisted between these two statesmen, both half-Irish, half-English, and\r\nof approximately the same age, yet widely different in character.\r\nCanning was the most brilliant orator of his day, and no less persuasive\r\nin private conversation than in public orations, gifted with an agile\r\nbrain that leaped readily from one idea or one project to another, but\r\ncursed with a bitter wit which lightly aroused enduring enmities, and\r\nwhich, coupled with an excessive vanity, rendered him unpopular with his\r\ncolleagues, and made it difficult for any one to take him seriously;\r\nwhile his rival, not less able, and much more steady and trustworthy, a\r\nskilful manager of men, was scarcely able to pronounce a coherent\r\nsentence. Early in April Canning pressed upon the Duke of Portland the\r\ntransfer of Castlereagh to another office. Private communications\r\nfollowed between various members of the cabinet, and it was understood\r\nthat Camden, as Castlereagh's friend, should apprise him of the\r\nprevailing view, which the king himself had approved under a threat of\r\nCanning's resignation. The duke, however, begged Camden to postpone the\r\ndisclosure, and others of Castlereagh's friends urged Canning not to\r\ninsist upon the change pending the completion of the Walcheren\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _DUEL BETWEEN CANNING AND CASTLEREAGH._]\r\n\r\nAs the scheme took shape in July Camden was to resign, and thus make\r\npossible a shifting of offices, which was to result in the Marquis\r\nWellesley succeeding Castlereagh as secretary for war. At last, on\r\nSeptember 6, the duke informed Canning of his own intention to retire on\r\nthe ground of ill-health, and at the same time disclosed the fact that\r\nno steps had been taken to prepare Castlereagh for the proposed change\r\nin his position. Thereupon Canning promptly sent in his own resignation,\r\nthe duke resigned the same day, and Castlereagh, learning what had\r\npassed, followed his example two days later.[39] Believing that Canning\r\nhad been intriguing against him behind his back, under the guise of\r\nfriendship, he demanded satisfaction on the 19th, and on the 21st[40]\r\nthe duel was fought, in which Canning received a slight wound. Such\r\nevents provoked little censure in those days, and it is pleasant to\r\nknow that Canning and Castlereagh afterwards acted cordially together as\r\ncolleagues. Their enmity broke up the government. The Duke of Portland\r\ndid not long survive his withdrawal from office, and died on October 29;\r\nLeveson-Gower insisted on following Canning into retirement.\r\n\r\nPerceval was entrusted with the task of forming an administration, but\r\nthe new ministry was not formed without considerable negotiation.\r\nCanning vainly endeavoured to impress first on his colleagues and then\r\non the king his own pretensions to the highest office, while attempts,\r\nto which the king gave a reluctant assent, had been made to enlist the\r\nco-operation of Grenville and Howick, who succeeded his father as Earl\r\nGrey, in 1807, but they failed as all later attempts were destined to\r\nfail. The most influential motive governing their conduct was,\r\ndoubtless, their feeling that they would not as ministers possess the\r\nking's confidence. Sidmouth's following had also been approached.\r\nSidmouth himself was considered too obnoxious to some of Pitt's\r\nfollowers to be a safe member of the new cabinet, but Vansittart was\r\noffered the chancellorship of the exchequer and Bragge, who had taken\r\nthe additional surname of Bathurst, the office of secretary at war. They\r\nrefused, however, to enter the ministry, unless accompanied by Sidmouth\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nPerceval eventually became prime minister, retaining his former offices;\r\nLord Bathurst, while remaining at the board of trade, presided\r\ntemporarily at the foreign office, which was offered to the Marquis\r\nWellesley, then serving as British ambassador to the Spanish junta at\r\nSeville, and taken over by him in December. Hawkesbury, now Earl of\r\nLiverpool, succeeded Castlereagh as secretary for war and the colonies,\r\nand was followed at the home office by Richard Ryder, a brother of\r\nHarrowby. Harrowby himself gave up the board of control in November to\r\nMelville's son, Robert Dundas, who, however, was not made a member of\r\nthe cabinet. Lord Palmerston, who had been a junior lord of the\r\nadmiralty under Portland, declined the chancellorship of the exchequer,\r\nand though he accepted Leveson-Gower's post as secretary at war, he was\r\nby his own desire excluded from the cabinet.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _NEW BRITISH CONQUESTS._]\r\n\r\nWhile the close of the year 1809 was darkened by national\r\ndisappointment and political anxieties, the honour of British arms had\r\nbeen amply vindicated in the Spanish peninsula, and the brilliant\r\nexploit of Lord Cochrane in Basque Roads had recalled the glories of the\r\nNile. Cochrane had already achieved marvels under Collingwood in the\r\nMediterranean, and notably off the Spanish coast, when he was selected\r\nto conduct an attack by fireships on the French squadron blockaded under\r\nthe shelter of the islands of Aix and Oléron. This he carried out on the\r\nnight of April 11, with a dash and skill worthy of Nelson, and unless\r\nchecked by Gambier, the admiral in command, who had been raised to the\r\npeerage after the seizure of the Danish fleet in 1807, he must have\r\nsucceeded in destroying the whole of the enemy's ships. Gambier was\r\nafterwards acquitted by a court martial of negligence, but the verdict\r\nof the public was against him. In the autumn Collingwood reduced the\r\nseven Ionian islands, and gained an important advantage by cutting out a\r\nconsiderable detachment of the Toulon fleet in the Bay of Genoa. In the\r\ncourse of the year, too, all the remaining French territory in the West\r\nIndies, as well as the Isle of Bourbon in the Indian Ocean, was captured\r\nby the British navy. But this unchallenged supremacy on the high seas\r\ndid not prevent the depredations of French gunboats on British\r\nmerchantmen in the channel. Indeed after the battle of Trafalgar, the\r\nFrench \"sea-wasps\" infesting the Channel were more active and\r\ndestructive than ever.\r\n\r\nOn October 25, being the forty-ninth anniversary of his accession, the\r\njubilee of George III. was celebrated with hearty and sincere\r\nrejoicings. His popularity was not unmerited. He was politically\r\nshortsighted, but within his range of vision few saw facts so clearly;\r\nhe was obstinate and prejudiced, but his obstinacy was redeemed by a\r\nmoral intrepidity of the highest order, and his prejudices were shared\r\nby the mass of his people. Having lived through the seven years' war,\r\nthe war of the American revolution, and the successive wars of Great\r\nBritain against the French monarchy and the French republic, he was now\r\nsupporting, with indomitable firmness, a war against the all-conquering\r\nFrench empire--the most perilous in which this country was ever engaged.\r\nThe colonial and Indian dominions of Great Britain, reduced by the loss\r\nof the North American colonies, had been greatly extended during his\r\nreign in other quarters of the globe. His subjects regarded him as an\r\nEnglishman to the core; they knew him to be honest, religious, virtuous,\r\nand homely in his life; they justly believed him, in spite of his\r\nfailings, to be a power for good in the land; and they rewarded him with\r\na respect and affection granted to no other British sovereign of modern\r\ntimes before Queen Victoria. They had good cause to desire the\r\ncontinuance of his life and reason, knowing the character of his\r\nheir-apparent, and contrasting the domestic habits of Windsor with the\r\nlicence of Carlton House.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[31] Colchester, _Diary_ (Feb. 4, 1806), ii., 35, 36.\r\n\r\n[32] Holland, _Memoirs of the Whig Party_, ii., 91-94.\r\n\r\n[33] Holland, _Memoirs of the Whig Party,_ ii., 173-205, 270-320;\r\nColchester, _Diary_, ii., 92-115; Malmesbury, _Diaries_, iv., 357-72;\r\nWalpole, _Life of Perceval_, i., 223-33; Buckingham, _Courts and\r\nCabinets_, iv., 117-50.

Lewis,\r\n_Administrations_, pp. 314-15, finds a double ground for Canning's\r\nresignation in his failure to obtain the removal of Castlereagh from the\r\nwar office and in the refusal of the king and cabinet to allow him to\r\nsucceed Portland as prime minister. It is quite clear, however, that at\r\nthe time of Canning's resignation no decision had been come to about a\r\nsuccessor to Portland. Some correspondence had passed between Canning\r\nand Perceval, in which each had refused to serve under the other, but\r\nthat this correspondence was unknown to the cabinet as a whole is proved\r\nby Mulgrave's letters to Lord Lonsdale of September 11 and 15 (Phipps,\r\n_Memoir of Ward_, pp. 210-17); in the former of these he discusses\r\nCanning's probable conduct without referring to this correspondence,\r\nwhile in the latter he only knows of such negotiations as subsequent to\r\nthe resignations of September 6 and 8. So, too, Eldon's letter to his\r\nwife of September 11 (Twiss, _Life of Eldon_, ii., 88-90), places the\r\nwhole correspondence between Canning and Perceval after Portland's\r\nresignation on September 6. The king was not informed of Canning's views\r\nas to a successor to Portland till September 13, and the cabinet minute\r\nof September 18, advising co-operation with Grenville and Grey, mentions\r\nthe selection of Canning as prime minister as a course open to the king.\r\n\r\n[40] This is the date commonly given. The _Annual Register_, li. (1809),\r\n239, gives the 22nd, while Perceval refers to the result of the duel in\r\na letter dated the 20th (Colchester, _Diary_, ii., 209). It is clear,\r\nhowever, that Canning did not receive Castlereagh's challenge till the\r\nmorning of the 20th (see his letter in _Annual Register_, _loc. cit._,\r\n505, also his detailed statement to Camden, _ibid._, 525), and therefore\r\nthe duel cannot have taken place till the 21st. Lord Folkestone in a\r\nletter dated the 21st refers to the duel as having been fought at \"7\r\no'clock this morning\" (_Creevey Papers_, i., 96).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                        PERCEVAL AND LIVERPOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe administration of Perceval, covering the period from October, 1809,\r\nto May, 1812, coincided with a lull in the continental war save in the\r\nPeninsula, though it saw no pause in the progress of French annexation.\r\nNor was it marked by many events of historical interest in domestic\r\naffairs. When parliament was opened on January 23, 1810, it was natural\r\nthat attention should chiefly be devoted to the Walcheren expedition,\r\nwhich the opposition illogically and unscrupulously contrived to use to\r\ndisparage the operations of Sir Arthur Wellesley, now Viscount\r\nWellington, in Spain. Grenville, who argued with some reason that 40,000\r\nBritish troops could have been employed to far better purpose in North\r\nGermany, would have been on stronger ground if he had complained that\r\nfor want of them the British army had been unable to occupy Madrid.\r\nCastlereagh, indeed, had confessed to Wellesley that he could not spare\r\nthe necessary reinforcements, after the reserves had been exhausted in\r\nWalcheren; but it is by no means certain that Wellesley could have\r\ncollected provisions enough to feed a much larger force, or specie\r\nenough to pay for them. Liverpool was driven in reply to Grenville to\r\nmagnify the value of the capture of Flushing, as the necessary basis of\r\nthe naval armaments which Napoleon had intended to launch against\r\nEngland from the Scheldt. The government was also defended by the young\r\nRobert Peel, lately elected to parliament. As the calamity was\r\nirreparable, a committee of the whole house spent most of its time on a\r\nconstitutional question, regarding a private memorandum placed before\r\nthe king by Chatham in his own defence. So irregular a proceeding was\r\nproperly condemned, and Chatham resigned the mastership of the ordnance,\r\nbut the policy of the Walcheren expedition was approved by a vote of the\r\nhouse of commons. Mulgrave received the office Chatham had vacated, and\r\nwas himself succeeded by Yorke at the admiralty.\r\n\r\nParliament was next occupied by a question of privilege, in which Sir\r\nFrancis Burdett, member for Westminster, then a favourite of the\r\ndemocracy, played a part resembling that of John Wilkes a generation\r\nearlier. Burdett had been for fourteen years a member of parliament, and\r\nhad been conspicuous from the first for the vehemence of his opposition\r\nto the government, and more especially to its supposed infringements of\r\nthe liberty of the subject. He had more recently taken an active part on\r\nbehalf of Wardle's attack on the Duke of York and had supported the\r\ncharges of ministerial corruption in the previous session. On the\r\npresent occasion one John Gale Jones, president of a debating club, had\r\npublished in a notice of debate the terms of a resolution which his club\r\nhad passed, condemning in extravagant language the exclusion of\r\nstrangers from the house of commons. This was treated as a breach of\r\nprivilege, and Jones was sent to Newgate by order of the house itself.\r\nBurdett, in a violent letter to Cobbett's _Register_, challenged the\r\nright of the house to imprison Jones by its own authority, and, after a\r\nfierce debate lasting two nights, was adjudged by the house, on April 5,\r\nto have been guilty of a still more scandalous libel. Accordingly, the\r\nspeaker issued a warrant for his committal to the Tower. Burdett\r\ndeclared his resolution to resist arrest, the populace mustered in his\r\ndefence, the riot act was read, and he was conveyed to prison by a\r\nstrong military escort, on whose return more serious riots broke out,\r\nand were not quelled without bloodshed. On his release at the end of the\r\nsession a repetition of these scenes was prevented by the simple\r\nexpedient of bringing him home by water. During his imprisonment he\r\nwrote an offensive letter to the speaker, and his colleague, Lord\r\nCochrane, presented a violently worded petition from his Westminster\r\nconstituents. In the following year he sued the speaker and the\r\nsergeant-at-arms in the court of king's bench, which decided against him\r\non the ground that a power of commitment was necessary for the\r\nmaintenance of the dignity of the house of commons, and its decision\r\nwas confirmed, on appeal, by the court of exchequer chamber and the\r\nhouse of lords.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE CURRENCY QUESTION._]\r\n\r\nThe most important subject of internal policy discussed in the session\r\nof 1810 was the state of the currency. Since 1797 cash payments had been\r\nsuspended, the issue of banknotes had been nearly doubled, and the price\r\nof commodities had risen enormously. Whether these results had in their\r\nturn promoted the expansion of foreign commerce and internal industry\r\nwas vigorously disputed by two rival schools of economists. The one\r\nthing certain was the increasing scarcity of specie, and the serious\r\nloss incurred in its provision for the service of the army in the\r\nPeninsula. Francis Horner, then rising to eminence, obtained the\r\nappointment of what became known as the \"bullion committee\" to inquire\r\ninto the anomalous conditions thus created, and took a leading part in\r\nthe preparation of its celebrated report, published on September 20. The\r\ncommittee arrived at the conclusion that the high price of gold was\r\nmainly due to excess in the paper-currency, and not, as alleged, to a\r\ndrain of gold for the continental war. They attributed that excess to\r\n\"the want of a sufficient check and control in the issues of paper from\r\nthe Bank of England, and originally to the suspension of cash-payments,\r\nwhich removed the natural and true control\". While allowing that paper\r\ncould not be rendered suddenly convertible into specie without\r\ndislocating the entire business of the country, they recommended that an\r\nearly provision should be made by parliament for terminating the\r\nsuspension of cash-payments at the end of two years. These conclusions\r\nwere combated by Castlereagh and Vansittart, who afterwards, in 1811,\r\nsucceeded in carrying several counter-resolutions, of which the general\r\neffect was to explain the admitted rise in the price of gold, for the\r\nmost part by the exclusion of British trade from the continent, and the\r\nconsequent export of the precious metals in lieu of British\r\nmanufactures. The last resolution, while it recognised the wisdom of\r\nrestoring cash-payments as soon as it could safely be done, affirmed it\r\nto be \"highly inexpedient and dangerous to fix a definite period for the\r\nremoval of the restriction on cash-payments prior to the conclusion of a\r\ndefinitive treaty of peace\". These counsels prevailed, and the\r\nrestriction was not actually removed until Peel's act was passed in\r\nJuly, 1819.\r\n\r\nThe last domestic event in the inglorious annals of 1810 was the final\r\nlapse of the king into mental derangement in the month of November. For\r\nmore than six years his sight had been failing, but he had suffered no\r\nreturn of insanity since 1804. Now he lost both his sight and his\r\nreason. This event, impending for some time, was precipitated by the\r\nillness and death of the Princess Amelia, his favourite daughter, and\r\nwas perhaps aggravated by the Walcheren expedition and the disgrace of\r\nthe Duke of York. Parliament met on November 1, and was adjourned more\r\nthan once before a committee was appointed to examine the royal\r\nphysicians. Acting on their report, the ministers proposed and carried\r\nresolutions declaring the king's incapacity, and the right and duty of\r\nthe two houses to provide for the emergency. It was also determined to\r\ndefine by act of parliament the powers to be exercised in the king's\r\nname and behalf. This implied a limitation of the regent's authority,\r\nand was resented by the Prince of Wales and his friends. Perceval,\r\nhowever, was able to rely on the precedent of 1788, to which Grenville,\r\nfor one, had been a party, and, after considerable opposition, the\r\nprince was made regent under several temporary restrictions. With\r\ncertain exceptions, he was precluded from granting any peerage or office\r\ntenable for life; the royal property was vested in trustees for the\r\nking's benefit, and the personal care of the king was entrusted to the\r\nqueen, with the advice of a council. In this form, the regency bill was\r\npassed on February 4, 1811, after a protest from the other sons of\r\nGeorge III. and violent attacks upon Eldon by Grenville and Grey. On the\r\n5th, the regent took the oaths before the privy council, but, in\r\naccepting the restrictions, he delicately expressed regret that he\r\nshould not have been trusted to impose upon himself proper limitations\r\nfor the exercise of royal patronage. The interregnum thus established\r\nwas to be provisional only, and was to cease on February 1, 1812, but\r\nthe queen and her private council, with the concurrence of the privy\r\ncouncil, were empowered to annul it at any time, by announcing the\r\nking's recovery, when he could resume his powers by proclamation.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE REGENCY BILL._]\r\n\r\nThe hopes of the opposition had been greatly excited by the prospect of\r\na regency, and it was generally expected that a change of ministry would\r\nbe its immediate consequence. Private communications had, in fact,\r\npassed between the prince and the whig lords, Grenville and Grey, but\r\nthey were rendered nugatory by the dictatorial tone assumed by those\r\nlords and by the unwillingness of the prince to dispense with the advice\r\nof Moira and Sheridan. The two whig lords had by the prince's desire\r\nprepared a reply to the address from the houses of parliament,\r\npreparatory to the regency bill. Grenville had voted in favour of the\r\nrestriction on the creation of peers, and it is therefore not surprising\r\nthat the reply which he and Grey drafted appeared to the prince too weak\r\nin its protest against the limitations. He therefore adopted in its\r\nstead another reply which Sheridan had composed for him. The two lords\r\nthereupon addressed to the prince a remonstrance, which practically\r\nclaimed for themselves the right of responsible ministers to be the sole\r\nadvisers of their prince. This remonstrance provoked the ridicule of\r\nSheridan, and certainly did not please the prince, who since the fall of\r\nthe Grenville ministry had refused to be regarded as a \"party man\". The\r\nregent, accordingly, gave Perceval to understand that he intended to\r\nretain his present ministers, but solely on the ground that he was\r\nunwilling to do anything which might retard his father's recovery, or\r\ndistress him when he should come to himself. This reason was probably\r\ngenuine. The king appeared to be recovering; he had had several\r\ninterviews with Perceval and Eldon, and had made inquiries as to the\r\nprince's intentions. Soon, however, the malady took a turn for the\r\nworse, and the physicians came to the conclusion that it was\r\npermanent.[41]\r\n\r\nBefore February, 1812, when the restrictions expired, and a permanent\r\nregency bill was passed, the prince drifted further away from his former\r\nadvisers, and had been pacified by the loyal attitude of Perceval and\r\nEldon. Further overtures were conveyed to the whig lords through a\r\nletter from the prince regent to the Duke of York, in which he declared\r\nthat he had \"no predilections to indulge or resentments to gratify,\" but\r\nonly a concern for the public good, towards which he desired the\r\nco-operation of some of his old whig friends, indicating Grenville and\r\nGrey. They declined in a letter to the Duke of York, alleging\r\ndifferences on grounds of policy too deep to admit of a coalition.\r\nEldon, on his part, expressed a similar conviction, but the regent never\r\nfully forgave what he regarded as their desertion. Wellesley, who was\r\nstrongly opposed to Perceval's policy of maintaining the catholic\r\ndisabilities, resigned the secretaryship of foreign affairs, protesting\r\nagainst the feeble support given to his brother in the Peninsula, and\r\nwas succeeded by Castlereagh. In April Sidmouth became president of the\r\ncouncil in place of Camden, who remained in the cabinet without office;\r\nand in the next month, on May 11, Perceval was assassinated in the lobby\r\nof the house of commons by a man named Bellingham, who had an imaginary\r\ngrievance against the government.\r\n\r\nA very general and sincere tribute of respect was paid by the house to\r\nPerceval's memory, for, though his statesmanship was of the second\r\norder, he was far more than a tory partisan; he was an excellent\r\ndebater, and a thoroughly honest politician, and his private character\r\nwas above all reproach or suspicion. The cabinet was bewildered by his\r\ndeath, and a fresh attempt was made to strengthen it by the simple\r\ninclusion of Canning as well as Wellesley. Wellesley stipulated that the\r\ncatholic question should be left open, and that the war should be\r\nprosecuted with the entire resources of the country, while Canning\r\ndeclined co-operation on the ground of the catholic question alone. No\r\nagreement being found possible, the house of commons stepped in and\r\naddressed the regent, begging him to form a strong and efficient\r\nadministration, commanding the confidence of all classes. He replied by\r\nsending for Wellesley, offering him the premiership and entrusting him\r\nwith the formation of a comprehensive ministry; but Wellesley soon found\r\nthat Liverpool and his adherents would not serve under him at all, while\r\nGrenville and Grey, who secretly condemned the Peninsular war, would\r\nonly serve on conditions which he could not grant. Once more, the regent\r\ntreated directly with these haughty whigs, now including Moira, to whom\r\nhe committed the task of forming an administration. Grenville and Grey\r\nraised difficulties about the appointments in the royal household, which\r\nthey wished to include in the political changes, and the negotiation was\r\nbroken off. The regent at last fell back on Liverpool, a capable and\r\nconciliatory minister, who adopted Perceval's colleagues, and a spell of\r\ntory administration set in which remained unbroken for no less than\r\nfifteen years. Had more tact been shown on all sides, had the whigs been\r\nless peremptory in their demands, and had the trivial household question\r\nnever arisen, the course of the war, if not of European history, might,\r\nwhether for good or evil, have been profoundly modified.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _SOCIAL REFORMS._]\r\n\r\nDuring the later period of Perceval's administration, from 1811 to 1812,\r\nthe strife of politics had been mainly concentrated on the regency\r\nquestion, the chance of ministerial changes, and the fortunes of the war\r\nin Spain. But it must not be supposed that social questions were\r\nneglected, even in the darkest days of the war, however meagre the\r\nlegislative fruits may appear. Session after session, Romilly pressed\r\nforward reforms of the criminal law, the institution of penitential\r\nhouses in the nature of reformatories, and the abolition of state\r\nlotteries. Others laboured, and with greater success, to remedy the\r\ndelays and reduce the arrears in the court of chancery. Constant efforts\r\nwere made to expose defalcations in the revenue, to curtail exorbitant\r\nsalaries, and to put down electioneering corruption. In 1809 Erskine\r\nintroduced a bill for the prevention of cruelty to animals. In 1810\r\nthere were earnest, if somewhat futile, debates on spiritual\r\ndestitution, the non-residence and poverty of the clergy, and the\r\nscarcity of places of worship. Moreover, early in 1811, a premonitory\r\nsymptom of the repeal movement caused some anxiety in Ireland. It took\r\nthe form of a scheme for a representative assembly to sit in Dublin, and\r\nmanage the affairs of the Roman catholic population, under colour of\r\nframing petitions to parliament, and seeking redress of grievances. It\r\nwas, of course, to consist of Roman catholics only, and to include Roman\r\ncatholic bishops. The Irish government wisely suppressed the scheme, and\r\nPerceval justified their action, on the ground that a representative\r\nassembly in Dublin, with such aims in view, bordered upon an illicit\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nExcept for the war in the Spanish peninsula, and the war between Russia\r\nand the Porte on the Danube, the year 1810 was marked by undisturbed\r\npeace throughout the continent of Europe. France continued to make\r\nannexations, but they were at the expense of her allies, not of her\r\nenemies. Her supremacy was signalised in a striking way by the marriage\r\nof her _parvenu_ emperor, whose divorce the pope still refused to\r\nrecognise, with Maria Louisa, daughter of the Emperor of Austria. Though\r\nthirteen out of twenty-six cardinals present in Paris declined to attend\r\nit, this marriage was a masterstroke of Talleyrand's diplomacy; it\r\nsecured the benevolent neutrality of Austria for the next three years,\r\nand weakened the counsels of the allies during the negotiations of\r\n1814-15. But it went far to estrange the Tsar of Russia, who, though he\r\nhad courteously declined Napoleon's overtures for the hand of his own\r\nsister, was greatly offended on discovering that another matrimonial\r\nalliance had been contracted by his would-be brother-in-law before his\r\nreply could be received.\r\n\r\nIt was only within the limits of the French empire that Napoleon's\r\nauthority had been sufficient to enforce the rigorous exclusion of\r\nBritish goods. His allies, including Sweden, which closed her ports to\r\nBritish products in January, 1810, and declared war on Great Britain in\r\nthe following November, had adopted the continental system; but\r\nadministrative weakness, and the obvious interest that every people had\r\nin its infraction, rendered its operation partial. Napoleon, determined\r\nto enforce the system in spite of every obstacle, met this difficulty by\r\nplacing in immediate subjection to the French crown the territories\r\nwhere British goods were imported. The first ally to suffer was his own\r\nbrother, Louis, King of Holland. His refusal to enforce Napoleon's\r\norders against the admission of British goods was followed at once by a\r\nforced cession of part of Holland to France and the establishment of\r\nFrench control at the custom houses, and shortly afterwards by the\r\ndespatch of French troops into Holland and its annexation to France on\r\nJuly 9, 1810. In December the French dominion over the North Sea coast\r\nwas extended by the annexation of a corner of Germany, including the\r\ncoast as far as the Danish frontier, and the town of Lübeck on the\r\nBaltic. As a result of this annexation, the duchy of Oldenburg, held by\r\na branch of the Russian imperial family, ceased to exist. The act was a\r\nconspicuous breach of the treaty of Tilsit, which Napoleon considered\r\nhimself at liberty to disregard, as Russia had shown by her conduct\r\nduring the campaign of 1809 that she was no longer more than a nominal\r\nally of France. At last, on January 12, 1811, Russia asserted her\r\nindependence in fiscal matters by an order which declared her ports open\r\nto all vessels sailing under a neutral flag, and imposed a duty on many\r\nFrench products. Still the course of French annexation crept onwards,\r\nand quietly absorbed the republic of Vallais in Switzerland, which had\r\nbeen a great centre of smuggling.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE CONTINENTAL SYSTEM._]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the restrictions and prohibitions which formed the\r\ncontinental system were made more and more severe. By the Trianon tariff\r\nof August, 1810, heavy duties were levied on colonial products, and by\r\nthe Fontainebleau decree of October 18 all goods of British origin were\r\nto be seized and publicly burned. In November a special tribunal was\r\ncreated to try offenders against the continental system. Nevertheless,\r\nthe fiscal and foreign policy of France at this date alike show how far\r\nthe continental system had failed in its object, and to what extreme\r\nlengths it had become necessary to push it in order to give it a chance\r\nof success. The strain of the system on English commerce was immense,\r\nbut the burden fell far more heavily on the continental nations.\r\nColonial produce rose to enormous prices in France, Germany, and Italy,\r\nespecially after the introduction of the Trianon tariff, and a subject\r\nor ally of the French emperor had to pay ten times as much for his\r\nmorning cup of coffee as his enemy in London. The German opposition to\r\nNapoleon had failed in 1809 mainly through the political apathy of the\r\nGerman nation. Napoleon's fiscal measures were the surest way of\r\nbringing that apathy to an end, and converting it into hostility.\r\n\r\nThe events of December, 1810, and January, 1811, constituted a distinct\r\nbreach between France and Russia, which could only end in war, unless\r\none party or the other should withdraw from its position. A few months\r\nsufficed to show that no such withdrawal would take place; but neither\r\npower was prepared for war, and seventeen months elapsed after the\r\nbreach before hostilities began. The intervening period was spent in\r\nnegotiation and preparation. Much depended on the alliances that the\r\nrival powers might be able to contract. Although Napoleon had bound\r\nhimself not to restore Poland, he had by the creation and subsequent\r\nenlargement of the duchy of Warsaw given it a semblance of national\r\nunity, and had inspired the Poles with the hope of a more complete\r\nindependence. The Polish troops were among the most devoted in the\r\nFrench army, and the position of their country rendered the support of\r\nthe Poles a matter of great importance in any war with Russia. It\r\noccurred to the Tsar Alexander that he might win their support for\r\nhimself by a restoration of Poland, under the suzerainty of Russia. He\r\npromised Czartoryski the restoration of the eight provinces under a\r\nguarantee of autonomy, and undertook to obtain the cession of Galicia.\r\nOn February 13, 1811, he made a secret offer to Austria of a part of\r\nMoldavia in exchange for Galicia. Nothing came of this, but the massing\r\nof Russian troops on the Polish frontier in March was met by the hurried\r\nadvance of French troops through Germany, and war seemed imminent until\r\nRussia postponed the struggle by withdrawing her troops.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, other European powers looked forward to selling their\r\nalliance on the best possible terms. Sweden and Prussia both approached\r\nthe stronger power first. Bernadotte, on behalf of Sweden, was prepared\r\nfor a French alliance if France would favour the Swedish acquisition of\r\nNorway. Napoleon, on February 25, not only refused these terms, but\r\nordered Sweden to enforce the continental system under pain of a French\r\noccupation of Swedish Pomerania. This threat Sweden ventured to ignore.\r\nPrussia, lying directly between the two future belligerents, was in a\r\nmore dangerous position. Neutrality was impossible, because her\r\nneutrality would not be respected. She first offered her alliance to\r\nNapoleon in return for a reduction of the payments due to France and a\r\nremoval of the limit imposed on her army. Napoleon did not reply to this\r\noffer at once. Meanwhile the movement of French troops already mentioned\r\nand the increase of the French garrisons on the Oder, though primarily\r\nintended for the defence of Poland, caused great alarm in Prussia and\r\nresulted in preparations to resist a French attack. In July Napoleon\r\nfinally refused to discuss the Prussian terms. Ever since his marriage\r\nhe had been inclined more and more to an Austrian alliance. On March 26\r\nof this year Otto, his ambassador at Vienna, had received information\r\nthat France would support Austria if she would protest against the\r\noccupation of Belgrade by the Serbs. Napoleon even assured Otto that he\r\nwas prepared to undertake any engagement that Austria desired. Rest\r\nwas, however, essential to Austria. The military disasters of 1809 had\r\nbeen followed by national bankruptcy, and with the government paper at a\r\ndiscount of 90 per cent. she dared not incur further liabilities.\r\n\r\nRussia had an advantage over France in that she was able to free herself\r\nfrom her entanglement in Turkey, while Napoleon could not make peace\r\neither with Great Britain or with the Bourbon party in Spain. An\r\narmistice with the Porte was concluded on October 15. By that time all\r\npretence of friendly intentions had been abandoned by France and Russia.\r\nPrussia, hoping still to save herself from an unconditional alliance\r\nwith France, now turned to Russia, and Scharnhorst was despatched to\r\nseek a Russian alliance. Meanwhile Napoleon sent word to the Prussian\r\ncourt that, if her military preparations were not suspended, he would\r\norder Davoût to march on Berlin, and at the same time disclosed his\r\noffer of an unconditional alliance against Russia. Prussia, hoping for\r\nRussian aid still, put aside the French demands, but the Tsar Alexander\r\nexpressed a decided preference for a defensive campaign against France,\r\nand refused any assistance unless the French should commit an unprovoked\r\naggression on Königsberg. Scharnhorst seems to have seen the wisdom of\r\nthis policy. He now turned to Austria, but there again a definite\r\nalliance was refused. Russia was equally unable to move Austria to join\r\nher, so that Russia and Prussia were each isolated in their opposition\r\nto Napoleon.\r\n\r\nIn the months of August and September of this year a British force,\r\ncommanded by Auchmuty, effected the conquest of Java, the wealthiest of\r\nthe East Indian islands. The island had been a Dutch colony, and like\r\nother Dutch colonies had passed into the hands of France. Sumatra fell\r\ninto English hands along with Java, so that the supremacy of Great\r\nBritain in the East Indies was fully established.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _LIVERPOOL'S MINISTRY._]\r\n\r\nThe new ministry which entered on office in June, 1812, differed largely\r\nin composition from that which had preceded it. Ryder and Yorke retired\r\nat the death of Perceval, Harrowby returned to office, and places in the\r\ncabinet were found for Sidmouth's adherents, Buckinghamshire,\r\nVansittart, and Bragge-Bathurst. Sidmouth himself succeeded Ryder as\r\nhome secretary, while Harrowby succeeded Sidmouth as president of the\r\ncouncil. Earl Bathurst took Liverpool's place as secretary for war and\r\nthe colonies. Vansittart succeeded Perceval at the exchequer and\r\nBragge-Bathurst in the duchy of Lancaster. Robert Dundas, now Viscount\r\nMelville, followed Yorke at the admiralty, and Buckinghamshire took\r\nMelville's place at the board of control, which became once more a\r\ncabinet office. Eldon, Castlereagh, Westmorland, and Mulgrave retained\r\ntheir former offices, while Camden remained in the cabinet without\r\noffice. In September Mulgrave was created an earl, and Camden a marquis.\r\nThe internal history of England during the first two years of\r\nLiverpool's premiership has been entirely dwarfed by the interest of\r\nexternal events. For this period comprised not only the Russian\r\nexpedition--the greatest military tragedy in modern history--the\r\nmarvellous resurrection of Germany, with the campaigns which culminated\r\nin the stupendous battle of Leipzig, and the invasion of France which\r\nended in the abdication of Napoleon at Fontainebleau, but also the\r\nbrilliant conclusion of the Peninsular war, and the earlier stages of\r\nthe war between Great Britain and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe nation was contented to leave the guidance of home and foreign\r\npolicy at that critical time to the existing ministers, all honest,\r\nexperienced, and high-minded statesmen, but none gifted with any signal\r\nability, and inferior both in cleverness and in eloquence to the leaders\r\nof the opposition. Napoleon was not far wrong in regarding the British\r\naristocracy, which they represented, as his most inveterate and powerful\r\nenemy; but he was grievously deceived in imagining that this\r\naristocracy, in withstanding his colossal ambition, had not the British\r\nnation at its back. The electoral body, indeed, to which they owed their\r\nparliamentary majority, was but a fraction of the population, and the\r\npublic opinion which supported them may seem but the voice of a\r\nprivileged class in these days of household suffrage. But there is\r\nlittle reason to doubt that, if household suffrage had then prevailed,\r\ntheir foreign policy would have received a democratic sanction; nor is\r\nit at all certain that some features of their home policy, now generally\r\ncondemned, were not justified, in the main, by the exigencies of their\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _INDUSTRIAL DISTRESS._]\r\n\r\nThe \"condition of England,\" as it was then loosely termed, was the\r\nfirst subject which claimed the attention of Liverpool's government.\r\nWhile Perceval was congratulating parliament on the elasticity of the\r\nrevenue, a widespread depression of industry was producing formidable\r\ndisturbances in the midland counties. This depression was the\r\nconsequence partly of the continental system, crippling the export of\r\nBritish goods to European countries; partly of the revival, in February,\r\n1811, of the American non-intercourse act, closing the vast market of\r\nthe United States; and partly of the improvements in machinery,\r\nespecially those in spinning and weaving machines introduced by the\r\ninventions of Cartwright and Arkwright. Unhappily, this last cause,\r\nbeing the only one visible to artisans, was regarded by them as the sole\r\ncause of their distress. During the autumn and winter of 1811 \"Luddite\"\r\nriots broke out among the stocking-weavers of Nottingham. Their name was\r\nderived from a half-witted man who had destroyed two stocking frames\r\nmany years before. Frame-breaking on a grand scale became the object of\r\nan organised conspiracy, which extended its operations from\r\nNottinghamshire into Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lancashire, and\r\nYorkshire. At first frame-breaking was carried on by large bodies of\r\noperatives in broad daylight, and when these open proceedings were put\r\ndown by military force, they were succeeded by nightly outrages,\r\nsometimes attended by murder. Early in 1812 a bill was passed making\r\nframe-breaking a capital offence.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this riots grew into local insurrections, and a message from\r\nthe prince regent on June 27 recommended further action to parliament.\r\nIt was natural, in that generation to connect all disorderly movements\r\nwith revolutionary designs, and this belief underlies an alarmist report\r\nfrom a secret committee of the house of lords on the prevailing tumults.\r\nAccordingly, Sidmouth obtained new powers for magistrates to search for\r\narms, to disperse tumultuous assemblies, and to exercise jurisdiction\r\nbeyond their own districts. In November many Luddites were convicted,\r\nand sixteen were executed by sentence of a special commission sitting at\r\nYork. These stern measures were effectual for a time, and popular\r\ndiscontent in the manufacturing districts ceased to assume so acute a\r\nform until after the war was ended.\r\n\r\nThe sufferings of the poor in the rural districts, though generally\r\nendured in silence, were at least equally severe with those of the\r\nartisan class, and it is difficult to say whether a good or bad harvest\r\npressed more heavily on agricultural labourers. When the price of wheat\r\nrose to 130s. per quarter or upwards, as it did in 1812 and other years\r\nof scarcity, the farmers were able to pay comparatively high wages. When\r\nthe price fell to 75s., as it did in years of plenty like 1813, wages\r\nwere reduced to starvation-point, but supplemented out of the\r\npoor-rates, under the miserable system of indiscriminate out-door relief\r\ngraduated according to the size of families. In either case, the entire\r\nincome of a labourer was far below the modern standard, and the\r\nprosperity of trade meant to him an increase in the cost of all\r\nnecessaries except bread. As for their employers, the golden age of\r\nfarming, which is often identified with the age of the great war, had\r\nreally ceased long before. Not only did the high price of a farmer's\r\npurchases go far to neutralise the high price of his sales, but the\r\nexcessive fluctuations in all prices, due to the opening and closing of\r\nmarkets according to the fortunes of war, made prudent speculation\r\nalmost impossible. The frequently recurring depressions were rendered\r\nall the more disastrous, because in times of high prices \"the margin of\r\ncultivation\" was unduly extended.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _CORN LAWS._]\r\n\r\nWith a view to diminish the violence of these fluctuations, a select\r\ncommittee on the corn-trade was appointed by the house of commons in\r\n1813, and reported in favour of a sliding-scale. When the price of wheat\r\nshould fall below 90s. per quarter, its exportation was to be permitted;\r\nbut its importation was to be forbidden, until the price should reach\r\n103s., when it might, indeed, be imported, but under \"a very\r\nconsiderable duty\". It was assumed, in fact, that the normal price of\r\nwheat was above 100s. per quarter, and the price above which importation\r\nshould be permitted was nearly twice as high as that fixed in 1801,\r\nwhen, moreover, it was to be admitted above 50s. at a duty of 2s. 6d.,\r\nand above 54s. at a duty of sixpence. It is remarkable that in the\r\ndebates of 1814 upon the report of this committee, William Huskisson, as\r\nwell as Sir Henry Parnell, supported its main conclusions, upon the\r\nground that agriculture must be upheld at all costs, and the home-market\r\npreferred to foreign markets. Canning and others ably advocated the\r\ncause of the consumers, alleging that duties on corn injured them far\r\nmore than they could benefit landowners or farmers. Finally, a bill\r\nembodying a modified sliding-scale was introduced by the government,\r\nand, though lost by a narrow majority in 1814, became law in 1815. Under\r\nthis act the importation of foreign corn was prohibited, so long as the\r\nprice of wheat did not rise above 80s. Above that price it might be\r\nimported free. Corn from British North America might, however, be\r\nimported free so long as the price of wheat exceeded 67s.\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary debates of 1812 chiefly turned on Spanish affairs, the\r\nrevocation of the orders in council, the subsequent rupture with the\r\nUnited States which had anticipated this great concession, and the\r\nwearisome cabinet intrigues which preceded the accession of Liverpool as\r\nprime minister. It is noteworthy that so conservative a house of commons\r\nshould actually have pledged itself to consider the question of catholic\r\nemancipation in the next session, and should have passed an act\r\nrelieving nonconformists from various disabilities. The next session of\r\nthis parliament, however, never came, for an unexpected dissolution took\r\nplace on September 29. This dissolution was attributed, with some\r\nreason, to a wish on the part of the government to profit by an abundant\r\nharvest, and to the restoration of comparative quiet both in England and\r\nin Ireland. A new parliament assembled at the end of November. The\r\nprince regent's speech in opening it, though it noticed the suppression\r\nof the Luddite disturbances, was inevitably devoted to the great events\r\nin Spain and Russia, the conclusion of a treaty with Russia, and the\r\nAmerican declaration of war. After the Christmas recess, Castlereagh\r\npresented an argumentative message from the prince fully discussing the\r\npoints at issue between Great Britain and the United States, upon which\r\nCanning, though out of office, delivered a vigorous speech in defence of\r\nthe British position. Eldon, in the house of lords, went further, boldly\r\njustifying the right of search, and denying the American contention that\r\noriginal allegiance could be cancelled by naturalisation without the\r\nconsent of the mother-country. The Princess of Wales, who had long been\r\nseparated from the prince, was the cause of more parliamentary time\r\nbeing wasted by a complaint which she addressed to the speaker against\r\nthe proceedings of the privy council. That body had approved\r\nrestrictions which her husband had thought fit to place on her\r\nintercourse with her daughter, the Princess Charlotte. Parliament,\r\nhowever, took no action in the matter.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important measure enacted in the session of 1813 was\r\nthe so-called East India company's act. By this act the charter of the\r\ncompany was renewed with a confirmation of its administrative privileges\r\nand its monopoly of the China trade, but subject to material\r\nreservations: the India trade was thrown open from April 10, 1814, and\r\nthe charter itself, thus restricted, was made terminable by three years'\r\nnotice after April 10, 1831. In this year the naval and military\r\narmaments of Great Britain, considered as a whole, perhaps reached their\r\nmaximum strength, and the national expenditure rose to its highest\r\nlevel, including, as it did, subsidies to foreign powers amounting to\r\nabout £10,500,000. Of the aggregate expenditure, about two-thirds,\r\n£74,000,000, were provided by taxation, an enormous sum relatively to\r\nthe population and wealth of the country at that period. Patiently as\r\nthis burden was borne on the whole by the people of Great Britain, we\r\ncannot wonder that Vansittart, the chancellor of the exchequer, should\r\nhave sought to lighten it in some degree by encroaching upon the sinking\r\nfund, as founded and regulated by Pitt. The debates on this complicated\r\nquestion, in which Huskisson and Tierney stoutly combated Vansittart's\r\nproposal, belong rather to financial history. What strikes a modern\r\nstudent of politics as strange is that Vansittart, tory as he was,\r\nshould have advocated the relief of living and suffering taxpayers, upon\r\nthe principle, then undefined, of leaving money \"to fructify in the\r\npockets of the people\"; while the whig economists of the day stickled\r\nfor the policy of piling up new debts, if need be, rather than break in\r\nupon an empirical scheme for the gradual extinction of old debts.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[41] For the whole crisis see Walpole, _Life of Perceval_, ii., 157-96,\r\nand for Sheridan's share in the transactions, Moore, _Life of Sheridan_,\r\nii., 382-409.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                         THE PENINSULAR WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the conflict maintained for six years\r\nby Great Britain against France for the liberation of Spain and\r\nPortugal, which has since been known in history as the Peninsular war.\r\nIt had its origin in two events which occurred during the autumn of 1807\r\nand the spring of 1808. The first was the secret treaty of Fontainebleau\r\nconcluded between France and Spain at the end of October, 1807; the\r\nsecond was the outbreak of revolutionary movements at Madrid, followed\r\nby the intervention of Napoleon in March, April, and May, 1808. The\r\ntreaty of Fontainebleau was a sequel of the vast combination against\r\nGreat Britain completed by the peace of Tilsit, under which the\r\ncontinental system was to be enforced over all Europe. Portugal, the\r\nally of this country and an emporium of British commerce, was to be\r\npartitioned into principalities allotted by Napoleon, the house of\r\nBraganza was to be exiled, and its transmarine possessions were to be\r\ndivided between France and Spain, then ruled by the worthless Godoy in\r\nthe name of King Charles IV. Whether or not the subjugation of the whole\r\npeninsula was already designed by Napoleon, his troops, ostensibly\r\ndespatched for the conquest of Portugal under the provisions of the\r\ntreaty, had treacherously occupied commanding positions in Spain, when\r\nthe populace of Madrid rose in revolt, and, thronging the little town of\r\nAranjuez, where the court resided, frightened the king into abdication.\r\nHis unprincipled son, Ferdinand, was proclaimed in March, 1808, but\r\nMurat, who now entered Madrid as commander-in-chief of the French troops\r\nin that city, secretly favoured the ex-King Charles. In the end, both he\r\nand Ferdinand were enticed into seeking the protection of Napoleon at\r\nBayonne. Instead of mediating or deciding between them, Napoleon soon\r\nfound means to get rid of both. They were induced or rather compelled to\r\nresign their rights, and retire into private life on large pensions; and\r\nNapoleon conferred the crown of Spain on his brother Joseph, whose\r\nformer kingdom of Naples was bestowed on Murat.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, sanguinary riots broke out afresh at Madrid, hundreds\r\nof French were massacred, and the insurrection, as it was called, though\r\nsternly put down by Murat, spread like wildfire into all parts of Spain.\r\nA violent explosion of patriotism, resulting in anarchy, followed\r\nthroughout the whole country. Napoleon was taken by surprise, but the\r\ncombinations which he matured at Bayonne for the conquest of Spain were\r\nas masterly as those by which he had well-nigh subdued the whole\r\ncontinent, except Russia. He established a base of operations in the\r\ncentre of the country, and organised four campaigns in the north-west,\r\nnorth-east, south-east, and south. Savary, who had succeeded Murat at\r\nMadrid, was supposed to act as commander-in-chief, but was really little\r\nmore than a medium for transmitting orders received from Napoleon at\r\nBayonne. The campaign of Duhesme in Catalonia was facilitated by the\r\ntreacherous seizure of the citadel of Barcelona in the previous\r\nFebruary. It was not long, however, before effective aid was rendered on\r\nthe coast by the British fleet under Collingwood, and especially by Lord\r\nCochrane in the _Impérieuse_ frigate; the undisciplined bands of\r\nCatalonian volunteers were reinforced by regular troops from Majorca and\r\nMinorca; the fortress of Gerona made an obstinate resistance; the siege\r\nof it was twice raised, and Barcelona, almost isolated, was now held\r\nwith difficulty.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _FRANCE OCCUPIES THE PENINSULA._]\r\n\r\nMarshal Moncey vainly besieged Valencia, while Generals\r\nLefebvre-Desnoëttes and Verdier were equally unsuccessful before\r\nZaragoza. In the plains of Leon, Marshal Bessières gained a decisive\r\nvictory over a superior force of Spaniards under Cuesta and Blake, at\r\nMedina de Rio Seco, on July 14. Having thus secured the province of\r\nLeon, and the great route from Bayonne to Madrid, he was advancing on\r\nGalicia when his progress was arrested by disaster in another quarter.\r\nGeneral Dupont, commanding the southern army, found himself nearly\r\nsurrounded at Baylen, and solicited an armistice, followed by a\r\nconvention, under which, \"above eighteen thousand French soldiers laid\r\ndown their arms before a raw army incapable of resisting half that\r\nnumber, if the latter had been led by an able man\".[42] The convention,\r\nsigned on July 20, stipulated for the transport of the French troops to\r\nFrance, but its stipulations were shamefully violated; some were\r\nmassacred, others were sent to sicken in the hulks at Cadiz, and\r\ncomparatively few lived to rejoin their colours. Meanwhile a so-called\r\n\"assembly of notables,\" summoned to Bayonne, consisting of ninety-one\r\npersons, all nominees of Napoleon, assumed to act for the whole nation,\r\nhad accepted the nomination of Joseph Bonaparte as king, and proceeded\r\nto adopt a constitution. On July 20, the very day of the capitulation of\r\nBaylen, Joseph entered Madrid, and on the 24th was proclaimed King of\r\nSpain and the Indies. But the military prestige of the grand army\r\nreceived a fatal blow in the catastrophe, of which the immediate effect\r\nwas the retirement of Joseph behind the Ebro, and the ultimate effects\r\nwere felt in the later history of the war.\r\n\r\nAt this moment almost the whole of Portugal was in possession of the\r\nFrench. In November, 1807, under peremptory orders from Napoleon, Junot\r\nwith a French army and an auxiliary force of Spaniards, but without\r\nmoney or transport, had marched with extraordinary rapidity across the\r\nmountains to Alcantara in the valley of the Tagus. He thence pressed\r\nforward to Lisbon, hoping to anticipate the embarkation of the royal\r\nfamily for Brazil, which, however, took place just before his arrival\r\nand almost under his eyes. With his army terribly reduced by the\r\nhardships and privations of his forced march, he overawed Lisbon and\r\nissued a proclamation that \"the house of Braganza had ceased to reign\".\r\nA fortnight later a Spanish division occupied Oporto, and meanwhile\r\nanother Spanish division established itself in the south-east of\r\nPortugal, but, as the French stragglers came in and reinforcements\r\napproached, Junot felt himself strong enough to cast off all disguise;\r\nhe suppressed the council of regency, took the government into his own\r\nhands, and levied a heavy war contribution. During the early months of\r\n1808 he was employed in reorganising his own forces, and the resources\r\nof Lisbon, where an auxiliary Russian fleet of nine ships was lying\r\npractically blockaded. In a military sense, he was successful, but the\r\nrapacity of the French, the contagion of the Spanish uprising, the\r\nmemory of the old alliance with England, and the proximity of English\r\nfleets, stirred the blood of the Portuguese nation into ill-concealed\r\nhostility. The Spanish commander at Oporto withdrew his troops to\r\nGalicia, and the inhabitants declared for independence. Their example\r\nwas followed in other parts of Portugal. Junot acted with vigour,\r\ndisarmed the Spanish contingent at Lisbon, and sent columns to quell\r\ndisturbances on the Spanish frontiers, but he soon realised the\r\nnecessity of concentration. He therefore resolved to abandon most of the\r\nPortuguese fortresses, limiting his efforts to holding Lisbon, and\r\nkeeping open his line of communication with Spain.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _VIMEIRO AND CINTRA._]\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of affairs in the Peninsula when Sir Arthur Wellesley\r\nlanded his army of some 12,000 men on August 13, 1808. He had been\r\nspecially designated for the command of a British army in Portugal by\r\nCastlereagh, then secretary for war and the colonies, who fully\r\nappreciated his singular capacity for so difficult a service. Sir John\r\nMoore, who had just returned from the Baltic, having found it hopeless\r\nto co-operate with Gustavus IV. of Sweden, was sent out soon afterwards\r\nto Portugal with a corps of some 10,000 men. Both these eminent soldiers\r\nwere directed to place themselves under the orders not only of Sir Hew\r\nDalrymple, the governor of Gibraltar, as commander-in-chief, but of Sir\r\nHarry Burrard, when he should arrive, as second in command. Wellesley\r\nhad received general instructions to afford \"the Spanish and Portuguese\r\nnations every possible aid in throwing off the yoke of France,\" and was\r\nempowered to disembark at the mouth of the Tagus. Having obtained\r\ntrustworthy information at Coruña and Oporto, he decided rather to begin\r\nhis campaign from a difficult landing-place south of Oporto at the mouth\r\nof the Mondego, and to march thence upon Lisbon. He was opportunely\r\njoined by General Spencer from the south of Spain, and chose the\r\ncoast-road by Torres Vedras. At Roliça he encountered a smaller force\r\nunder Delaborde, sent in advance by Junot to delay his progress, and\r\nrouted it after a severe combat. Delaborde, however, retreated with\r\nadmirable tenacity, and Wellesley, expecting reinforcements from the\r\ncoast, pushed forward to Vimeiro, without attempting to check the\r\nconcentration of Junot's army. There was fought, on August 21, the first\r\nimportant battle of the Peninsular war. The British troops, estimated at\r\n16,778 men (besides about 2,000 Portuguese), outnumbered the French\r\nconsiderably, but the French were much stronger in cavalry, and boldly\r\nassumed the offensive, confident in the prestige derived from so many\r\nvictories in Italy and Germany. Wellesley's position was strong, but the\r\nattack on it was skilfully designed and pressed home with resolute\r\ncourage. It was repelled at every point of the field, and the French,\r\nretiring in confusion, might have been cut off from Lisbon. But Burrard,\r\nwho had just landed and witnessed the battle without interfering, now\r\nabsolutely refused to sanction a vigorous pursuit.\r\n\r\nOn the following day he was superseded in turn by Dalrymple. The new\r\ncommander determined to await the arrival of Moore, whose approach was\r\nreported, but who did not disembark his whole force until the 30th. In\r\nthe meantime, overtures for an armistice were received from Junot, and\r\nultimately resulted in the so-called \"convention of Cintra,\" though it\r\nwas first drafted at Torres Vedras and was ratified at Lisbon. Under\r\nthis agreement the French army was to surrender Lisbon intact with other\r\nPortuguese fortresses, but was allowed to return to France with its arms\r\nand baggage at the expense of the British government. Having dissented\r\nfrom the military decision which had enabled Junot to negotiate, instead\r\nof capitulating, Wellesley also dissented from certain terms of the\r\nconvention. He was, however, party to it as a whole, and afterwards\r\njustified its main conditions as securing the evacuation of Portugal at\r\nthe price of reasonable concessions. This was not the feeling of the\r\nBritish public, which loudly resented the escape of the French army and\r\ninsisted upon a court of inquiry. The verdict of this court saved the\r\nmilitary honour of all three generals, but its members were so divided\r\nin opinion on the policy of the convention that no authoritative\r\njudgment was pronounced. Napoleon felt no such difficulty in condemning\r\nJunot for yielding too much, and the inhabitants of Lisbon were\r\ninfuriated not only by the loss of their expected vengeance, but also by\r\nthe shameless plunder of their public and private property by the\r\ndeparting French. Under a separate convention, the Russian fleet, long\r\nblockaded in the Tagus, was surrendered to the British admiral, but\r\nwithout its officers or crews.\r\n\r\nThe capitulation of Baylen paralysed for a time the aggressive movements\r\nof France in Spain. Catalonia remained unconquered, even Bessières\r\nretreated, and Joseph, as we have seen, abandoned Madrid. Happily for\r\nthe French, the Spaniards proved quite incapable of following up their\r\nadvantages, and though a \"supreme junta\" was assembled at Aranjuez, it\r\nwasted its time in vain wrangling, and did little or nothing for the\r\norganisation of national defence. Meanwhile, Napoleon was pouring\r\nveteran troops from Germany into the north of Spain, where they repulsed\r\nthe Spanish levies in several minor engagements. On October 14 he left\r\nErfurt, where he had renewed his alliance with the tsar, and reached\r\nBayonne on November 3. His simple but masterly plan of campaign was\r\nalready prepared, and was carried out with the utmost promptitude. On\r\nNovember 10-11, one of three Spanish armies was crushed at Espinosa; on\r\nthe former day another was routed at Gamonal; on the 23rd the third was\r\nutterly dispersed at Tudela. Napoleon himself remained for some days at\r\nBurgos, awaiting the result of these operations; on December 4, after a\r\nfeeble resistance, he entered Madrid in triumph, and stayed there\r\nseventeen days, which he employed with marvellous activity in maturing\r\nfresh designs, both civil and military, for securing his power in Spain.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _ADVANCE OF SIR JOHN MOORE._]\r\n\r\nAlready, on October 7, Sir John Moore had taken over the command of the\r\nBritish forces. He probably owed his appointment to George III., who\r\nseems on this occasion to have overruled his foreign and war ministers,\r\nCanning and Castlereagh. In spite of his unwillingness to offer the\r\nappointment to Moore, Castlereagh gave him the most loyal and efficient\r\nsupport during the whole campaign; and this loyalty to Moore was one of\r\nthe reasons for Canning's desire to remove Castlereagh from the war\r\noffice, which, as we have seen, led to the famous duel between those two\r\nstatesmen. It was at first intended that Moore should co-operate with\r\nthe Spanish armies which were then facing the French on the line of the\r\nEbro. For this purpose he was to have the command of 21,000 troops\r\nalready in Portugal and of about 12,000 who were being sent by sea to\r\nCoruña under Sir David Baird. Burrard was to remain in Portugal with\r\nanother 10,000. Nothing had been done before Moore was appointed to the\r\ncommand to provide the troops with their necessary equipment or their\r\ncommander with the necessary local information. The departure of the\r\ntroops was therefore slow. By October 18 the greater part of the British\r\ntroops in Portugal were in motion, but the whole army had not left\r\nLisbon till the 29th. The main body travelled by fairly direct routes to\r\nSalamanca, where Moore arrived on November 13, but he was induced by\r\ninformation, which proved to be incorrect, to send his cavalry and guns\r\nwith a column under Hope, by the more circuitous high road through Elvas\r\nand Talavera. When this route was adopted it was anticipated that the\r\ndifferent divisions of the British army would be able to unite at, or\r\nnear, Valladolid. But the advance of the French rendered this\r\nimpossible, and Hope ultimately joined Moore at Salamanca on December 4.\r\n\r\nBaird suffered from even more vexatious delays. Though the greater part\r\nof his convoy had arrived at Coruña on October 13, the local junta would\r\nnot permit them to land without express orders from the central junta at\r\nAranjuez. Consequently the disembarkation did not begin till the 26th\r\nand was only finished on November 4. Transport and equipment were\r\ndifficult to obtain, and on November 22 Baird was still only at Astorga.\r\nThere exaggerated reports of the French advance induced him to halt, but\r\nby Moore's orders he continued his march. On the 28th the news of the\r\ndefeat of Castaños at Tudela reached Moore at Salamanca. Co-operation\r\nwith a Spanish army now appeared impossible, and even a junction with\r\nBaird seemed too hazardous to attempt. Moore therefore, ordered Baird to\r\nretire on Coruña and to proceed to Lisbon by sea, and, while waiting\r\nhimself at Salamanca for Hope, made preparations for a retreat to\r\nPortugal. On December 5, the day after his junction with Hope, Moore\r\ndetermined to continue his advance. He had received news of the\r\nenthusiastic preparations for the defence of Madrid but did not know of\r\nits fall, and he considered that the Spanish enthusiasm justified some\r\nrisk on the part of the British troops. He accordingly recalled Baird,\r\nwhose infantry had retired to Villafranca, though his cavalry were still\r\nat Astorga. On the 9th came the news of the fall of Madrid, but Moore\r\nbelieved that an attack on the French lines of communication might still\r\nprove useful, and on the 11th the advance was renewed. Moore himself\r\nleft Salamanca on the 13th. On the 12th he learned for the first time\r\nfrom some prisoners the true strength of the French army, 250,000 of all\r\narms, and also discovered that the enemy were in complete ignorance of\r\nthe position of his own army. Next day an intercepted despatch showed\r\nhim that he might possibly be able to cut off Soult in an isolated\r\nposition at Saldaña. Having at last effected a junction with Baird's\r\ncorps on the 19th he reached Sahagun on the 21st, and was on the point\r\nof delivering his attack under favourable conditions, though his triumph\r\nmust have been short-lived.\r\n\r\nHis real success was of another order. He had anticipated that Napoleon\r\nwould postpone everything to the opportunity of crushing a British army,\r\nand the ultimate object of his march to Sahagun was to draw the French\r\naway from Lisbon and Andalusia. He was not disappointed. Napoleon at\r\nlast divined that Moore was not flying in a south-westerly direction,\r\nbut carrying out a bold manoeuvre in a north-easterly direction. He\r\ninstantly pushed division after division from various quarters by forced\r\nmarches upon Moore's reported track, while he himself followed with\r\ndesperate efforts across the snow-clad mountains between Madrid and the\r\nDouro. Apprised of his swift advance, and conscious of his own vast\r\ninferiority in numbers, Moore had no choice but to retreat without a\r\nmoment's delay upon Benevente and Astorga. He was now sufficiently far\r\nnorth to prefer to retire upon Galicia rather than upon Portugal. The\r\nretreat began on the 24th and was executed with such rapidity that on\r\nJanuary 1, 1809, Napoleon gave up the pursuit at Astorga, leaving it to\r\nbe continued by Soult. Whether he was influenced by intelligence of\r\nfresh armaments on the Danube, or of dangerous plots in Paris, must\r\nremain uncertain, but it is highly probable that he saw little honour to\r\nbe won in a laborious chase of a foe who might prove formidable if\r\nbrought to bay.\r\n\r\nMoore's army, disheartened as it was by the loss of a brilliant chance,\r\nand demoralised as it became under the fatigues and hardships of a most\r\nharassing retreat, never failed to repel attacks on its rear, where\r\nPaget handled the cavalry of the rear-guard with signal ability,\r\nespecially in a spirited action near Benevente. In spite of some\r\nexcesses, tolerable order was maintained until the British force, still\r\n25,000 strong, reached Astorga, and was joined by some 10,000 Spaniards\r\nunder Romaña. Thenceforward, all sense of discipline was abandoned by so\r\nmany regiments that Moore described the conduct of his whole army as\r\n\"infamous beyond belief,\" though it is certain that some regiments, and\r\nnotably those of the reserve, should be excepted from this sweeping\r\ncondemnation. Drunkenness, marauding, and other military crimes grew\r\nmore and more general as the main body marched \"in a drove\" through\r\nVillafranca to Lugo, where Moore vainly offered battle, and onwards to\r\nBetanzos on the sea-coast. There a marvellous rally was effected,\r\nstragglers rejoined the ranks in unexpected numbers, the _moral_ of the\r\nsoldiery was restored as the fearful strain of physical misery was\r\nrelaxed, and by January 12, 1809, all the divisions of Moore's army were\r\nsafely posted in or around Coruña. Bad weather had delayed the fleet of\r\ntransports ordered round from Vigo, but it ran into the harbour on the\r\n14th, and the sick and invalids were sent on board.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE BATTLE OF CORUÑA._]\r\n\r\nMoore was advised to make terms for the embarkation of his entire\r\ncommand, but he was too good a soldier to comply. Those who took part in\r\nthe battle of Coruña on the 16th, some 15,000 men in all, were no\r\nunworthy representatives of the army which started from Lisbon three\r\nmonths earlier. Soult, with a larger force, assumed the offensive, and\r\nmade a determined attack on the British position in front of the harbour\r\nand town of Coruña. He was repulsed at all points, but Moore was\r\nmortally, and Baird severely, wounded on the field. Hope, who took\r\ncommand, knowing that Soult would soon be reinforced, wisely persisted\r\nin carrying out Moore's intention, evacuated Coruña, and embarked his\r\narmy for England during the night and the following day. His losses were\r\nestimated by Hope at above 700, killed and wounded; those of the enemy\r\nwere twice as great. Thus victory crowned a campaign which otherwise\r\nwould have done little to satisfy the popular appetite for tangible\r\nsuccess. The original object of supporting the Spanish resistance in the\r\nnorth had been rendered impossible of fulfilment by Napoleon's victories\r\nwhen Moore had barely crossed the Spanish frontier, and in this sense\r\nthe expedition must be regarded as a failure, though its commander was\r\nin no sense responsible for its ill-success. On the other hand,\r\nconsidered as a skilful diversion, the expedition was highly successful.\r\nIt drew all the best French troops and generals into the north-west\r\ncorner of Spain, leaving all the other, and far richer, provinces to\r\nrecover their power of resistance.[43]\r\n\r\nThe spirit in which Napoleon had entered upon this contest is well\r\nillustrated in two sentences of his address to the citizens of Madrid.\r\n\"The Bourbons,\" he said, \"can no longer reign in Europe,\" and \"No power\r\nunder the influence of England can exist on the continent\". The\r\ncounter-proclamations of Spanish juntas were more prolix and equally\r\narrogant, but one of them reveals the secret of national strength when\r\nit asserts that \"a whole people is more powerful than disciplined\r\narmies\". The British estimate of Napoleon's Spanish policy was tersely\r\nexpressed by the Marquis Wellesley in the house of lords, \"To him force\r\nand fraud were alike; force, that would stoop to all the base artifices\r\nof fraud; and fraud, that would come armed with all the fierce violence\r\nof force\".\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _WELLESLEY TAKES COMMAND._]\r\n\r\nFor three months after the battle of Coruña, the Peninsular war, as\r\nregards the action of Great Britain, was all but suspended. Two days\r\nbefore that battle, a formal treaty of peace and alliance between Great\r\nBritain and the Spanish junta, which had withdrawn to Seville, was\r\nsigned at London. Sir John Cradock was in command of the British troops\r\nat Lisbon, and took up a defensive position there, with reinforcements\r\nfrom Cadiz, awaiting the approach of Soult, who had captured Oporto by\r\nstorm, and of Victor, who was in the valley of the Tagus. At the request\r\nof the Portuguese, Beresford had been sent out to organise and command\r\ntheir army. Early in 1809 the Spaniards were defeated with great\r\nslaughter at Ucles, Ciudad Real, and Medellin; Zaragoza was taken after\r\nanother siege, and still more obstinate defence; and the national cause\r\nseemed more desperate than ever. On April 2, however, Sir Arthur\r\nWellesley, who had returned home after the convention of Cintra, was\r\nappointed to the command-in-chief of our forces in the Peninsula.\r\nBefore leaving England, he left with the ministers a memorandum on the\r\nconduct of the war which, viewed by the light of later events, must be\r\naccounted a masterpiece of foresight and sagacity. When it was laid\r\nbefore George III., his natural shrewdness at once discerned its true\r\nvalue, and he desired its author to be informed of the strong impression\r\nwhich it had produced on his mind.\r\n\r\nWellesley, indeed, could not estimate beforehand the vast numerical\r\nsuperiority of the French while the rest of Europe was at peace, or the\r\nimpotent vacillations of Spanish juntas, or the \"mulish obstinacy\" of\r\nSpanish generals, which so often wrecked his plans and spoiled his\r\nvictories. Nor could he foresee the advantages which he would derive\r\nfrom the resources of guerilla warfare, the mutual jealousies of the\r\nFrench marshals, and the sudden recall of the best French troops for\r\nservice in Germany and Russia. But his prescient and practical mind\r\nfirmly grasped the dominant facts of the position--that Portugal,\r\nguarded by the ocean on the west and by mountain ranges on the east, was\r\nfar more accessible to the British navy than to the French army; that,\r\nunder British officers, its troops might be trained into an effective\r\nforce; and that, with it as a basis, Great Britain might ultimately\r\nliberate the whole Peninsula. \"I have always been of opinion,\" Wellesley\r\nsaid in this memorandum, \"that Portugal might be defended, whatever\r\nmight be the result of the contest in Spain; and that in the meantime\r\nthe measures adopted for the defence of Portugal would be highly useful\r\nto the Spaniards in their contest with the French.\" On this simple\r\nprinciple all his detailed recommendations were founded, and he\r\nexpressed a deliberate belief that, if 30,000 British troops were\r\nsupported by an equal number of Portuguese regulars, and a reserve of\r\nmilitia was provided, \"the French would not be able to overrun Portugal\r\nwith less than 100,000 men\". This forecast was verified, and upon its\r\nessential wisdom the fate of the Peninsular war, with all its\r\nconsequences, may be said to have depended.[44]\r\n\r\nWellesley landed at Lisbon on April 22, and was received with the utmost\r\ndemonstrations of joy and confidence. He found not only the capital but\r\nthe whole country in a state of tumult, if not of anarchy, due to a\r\ngrowing despair of the national cause. His arrival rekindled the embers\r\nof patriotism, and on May 5 he reviewed at Coimbra a body of troops\r\nconsisting of 17,000 British and Germans, with about 8,000 Portuguese.\r\nThe next day he marched towards the Douro, and on the 14th he effected\r\nthe passage of that river in the face of the French army occupying\r\nOporto, which the British forthwith recaptured. Soult beat a hasty and\r\ndisorderly retreat into Galicia. Having driven Soult out of Portugal,\r\nthe British general was encouraged to undertake a further advance into\r\nSpain, where Joseph with Victor and Sébastiani had collected a much\r\nlarger army to bar the approaches to Madrid than Wellesley, relying on\r\nSpanish intelligence, had been led to expect. During June and the first\r\ndays of July, he moved by Abrantes and the Tagus valley as far as\r\nPlasencia, little knowing that Soult was about to sweep round his rear,\r\nwith 50,000 men, and intercept his communications with Lisbon. On July\r\n10 he held a conference with the Spanish general Cuesta, who insisted on\r\nmaking an aggressive movement with his own troops only, and met with a\r\nrepulse.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE TALAVERA CAMPAIGN._]\r\n\r\nOn the 27th, the combined armies of Wellesley and Cuesta, numbering\r\nrespectively about 20,000 British and 35,000 Spanish, confronted 46,000\r\nFrench troops, under Victor, in a strong position behind Talavera.[45]\r\nThe Spanish forces occupied the right and the British the left of this\r\nposition. Joseph was present, and disregarding the counsels of Jourdan,\r\nhis proper military adviser, authorised Victor to assume the offensive.\r\nHe failed in two preliminary attacks on the 27th, but renewed them on\r\nthe 28th, when a general engagement ensued. The whole brunt of the\r\nbattle fell upon the British troops, who gallantly withstood a desperate\r\nonset, first on their left and then on their centre and right, until the\r\nFrench quitted the field in confusion. The Spaniards, posted in\r\nentrenchments nearer Talavera itself, did and suffered comparatively\r\nlittle. Some of their regiments fled disgracefully, but the rest held\r\ntheir ground, and Wellesley in his despatch spoke favourably of their\r\nbehaviour.[46] Perhaps the part which they played may be roughly\r\nestimated by their losses, amounting to 1,200, as compared with 6,268\r\nBritish and nearly 9,000 French. Wellesley, after further experience of\r\nSpanish co-operation, made up his mind to dispense with it altogether in\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe victory of Talavera won for Wellesley the rank of viscount, to which\r\nhe was raised on September 4, with the title of Wellington. Although the\r\nvictory revived the respect of foreign nations for the prowess of\r\nBritish arms, it was otherwise fruitless, and its sequel was fairly open\r\nto criticism. Wellesley found that Soult, with Ney and Mortier, had\r\ncircumvented him, and that he must retreat through Esdremadura, on the\r\nsouth of the Tagus, upon Badajoz. Cuesta, who had advocated bolder\r\ncounsels, undertook to guard the rear, and to protect the British\r\nwounded at Talavera. But he soon found it necessary to abandon that\r\nposition. Fifteen hundred of the wounded were left behind, and were\r\nhumanely treated by the French generals. Wellesley's retreat over the\r\nmountains was attended with great hardship and loss, for want of\r\nsupplies either from Spain or from the coast, and his long encampment in\r\nthe malarious valley of the Guadiana about Badajoz swelled the number of\r\nhis sick to a frightful extent. It was not until December, when it got\r\ninto better cantonments on Portuguese soil, that the British army,\r\ntriumphant at Talavera, recovered either its health or its _moral_.\r\nNapoleon boasted, in a memorandum to be inserted in the Paris journals,\r\nthat Wellington had really been beaten in Spain, and that \"if affairs\r\nthere had been properly conducted not an Englishman would have escaped\".\r\nWithout going quite so far as this, the parliamentary opposition in\r\nEngland made the least of the victory and the most of the retreat, which\r\nunfortunately coincided in time with the wreck of the Walcheren\r\nexpedition. Even Wellington's best friends in England began to lose\r\nheart, as did many of his own officers. He remained undaunted, and\r\nhaving established his headquarters on the high ground between the Tagus\r\nand the Douro, meditated designs which, slowly matured, bore good fruit\r\nin later years.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand the inaction of Wellington for so many\r\nmonths after the Talavera campaign, without taking into account not only\r\nthe difficulty of obtaining sufficient recruits and stores from England\r\nafter the waste of both at the mouth of the Scheldt, but the greatly\r\nincreased strength of the French in Spain during the long interval\r\nbetween the Wagram campaign and the Russian expedition. At the close of\r\n1809 all the fortresses of Spain had fallen into the enemy's hands, and\r\nall her principal armies had been defeated and dispersed in successive\r\nbattles of which the greatest was that of Ocaña in the month of\r\nNovember. Suchet was master of Aragon and the east of Spain, nor was he\r\ndislodged from it until the end of the war; Andalusia was nearly\r\nconquered; Cadiz was only saved by the self-reliant courage of the Duc\r\nd'Albuquerque, baffling the intrigues and treachery of the supreme junta\r\nthere assembled; and Napoleon was preparing a fresh army to overrun\r\nPortugal, under the command of Masséna. The Perceval ministry, in which\r\nLiverpool had taken Castlereagh's post of secretary for war and the\r\ncolonies, adopting an optimistic tone at home, practically told\r\nWellington that he must shift for himself; and he braced himself up to\r\ndo so with extraordinary fortitude.\r\n\r\nHe remained watching the gathering storm from the heights of Guarda,\r\nsouth-west of Almeida, and commanding two great roads from Spain into\r\nPortugal, but his thoughts were equally fixed upon the vast and famous\r\nlines of Torres Vedras, which he was constructing for the defence of\r\nLisbon. His force, including the Portuguese regulars, did not exceed\r\n50,000 men; that of the French under Ney, Reynier, and Junot consisted\r\nof about 70,000, but they were not equally capable of being concentrated\r\non a single point. The Portuguese militia, too, were being gradually\r\ndisciplined, and the Portuguese civil authorities were being gradually\r\nschooled into the new lesson of sweeping their own country bare of all\r\nsupplies before the coming French invasion. Wellington did not even\r\nstrike a blow to save Ciudad Rodrigo, which Masséna took on July 10,\r\n1810. But it was no part of his plan that Almeida should capitulate, as\r\nit did shortly afterwards, partly owing to the accidental explosion of a\r\nmagazine, and partly as was suspected, to an act of treachery. Still,\r\nMasséna delayed until urged by Napoleon, and deceived by false\r\nintelligence, he launched forth, at the beginning of September, on an\r\nenterprise which proved fatal to his reputation. Both he and Wellington\r\nissued appeals to the Portuguese nation, the contrast between which is\r\nsignificant. The French marshal, echoing the prevailing note of his\r\nmaster's proclamation, denounced Great Britain as the enemy of all\r\nEurope; Wellington called upon the Portuguese to remember their actual\r\nexperience of French rapacity and outrage.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _BUSSACO AND TORRES VEDRAS._]\r\n\r\nThe object of Masséna was to reach Coimbra before Wellington. His\r\nmanoeuvres to outflank Wellington's left were skilfully devised, but\r\nthe British army marched steadily down the valley of the Mondego,\r\ncarrying with it the population of the district, and took its stand on\r\nthe ridge of Bussaco, north of Coimbra, barring Masséna's progress.\r\nThere was fought, on September 27, 1810, a battle as deadly as that of\r\nTalavera, and more decisive in its consequences. The French, as usual,\r\nwere the assailants; the English and the Portuguese stood at bay. Never,\r\nin any of their brilliant victories, did French troops show more heroic\r\ndaring than in this assault under Reynier on the British right, and\r\nunder Ney on the British left. Both columns forced their way up bare\r\nheath-clad slopes, and reached the summit, whence they were only driven\r\nback after repeated charges. Their loss in killed and wounded exceeded\r\n4,500, that of the allies was about 1,300. The French generals threw the\r\nblame of defeat upon each other, but, in fact, the skill of Masséna\r\nconverted a defeat into an episode in his victorious advance. On the\r\nfollowing day, he again found a way of turning Wellington's left, and,\r\nin an intercepted despatch, he naturally treated this as a compensation\r\nfor the repulse at Bussaco, which he did not disguise. Compelled to\r\nretire once more with a vast drove of encumbered, panic-stricken, and\r\nfamishing Portuguese fugitives, and conscious that no reserves awaited\r\nhim, Wellington knew, nevertheless, that he was drawing Masséna further\r\nand further away from his base, to encounter a terrible surprise. For,\r\nso useless had been the French scouts, and so worthless the information\r\nreceived from Portuguese sources, that no adequate conception of the\r\nobstacle presented by the lines of Torres Vedras had entered the mind of\r\nthat experienced strategist.\r\n\r\nThese elaborate works had been constructed in the course of a year by\r\nthousands of Portuguese labourers, directed by Colonel Fletcher of the\r\nroyal engineers, upon a plan carefully thought out and laid down by\r\nWellington himself. The first and principal chain of fortifications\r\nstretched for nearly thirty miles across the whole promontory between\r\nthe river Tagus and the sea, about twenty-five miles north of Lisbon.\r\nThe summits of hills were crowned with forts, their sides were escarped\r\nand protected with earthworks, their gorges were blocked with redoubts,\r\na small river at the foot of them was made impassable by dams; in short,\r\nthe utmost advantage was taken of the defences provided by nature, and\r\nthese were supplemented by artificial entrenchments. Portuguese\r\ngarrisons manned the greater part of the batteries, armed with guns from\r\nthe arsenals of Lisbon; British troops were to occupy the most\r\nvulnerable points of attack. There was a second and third range of\r\nfortifications behind the first, in case these should be forced, but no\r\nsuch emergency arose. When Masséna had carefully inspected the\r\nstupendous barrier reared in front of him, his well-trained eye\r\nrecognised it as impregnable: he paused for some weeks under semblance\r\nof blockading the British forces, while he was really scouring the\r\ncountry for the means of feeding his own; but in November he began to\r\nretreat upon Santarem, Almeida, and Ciudad Rodrigo, with a half-starved\r\nand dispirited army, greatly reduced in numbers during the campaign.[47]\r\n\r\nThe year 1811 was perhaps the least interesting, yet the most critical\r\nin the history of the Peninsular war. Wellington had not escaped\r\ncriticism at home for allowing Masséna to remain so long unmolested near\r\nSantarem. He described himself in a private letter, written in December,\r\n1810, as \"safe for the winter at all events\". More he could not have\r\nsaid, knowing, as he did, that Soult was in force before Cadiz, and\r\nmight at any moment join Masséna. This, in fact, he did; leaving his\r\nfields of plunder in Andalusia under the positive orders of Napoleon, he\r\ndefeated the Spaniards at the Gebora on February 19, and captured\r\nBadajoz, as well as Olivenza. In his absence, Sir Thomas Graham, who\r\ncommanded the British troops at Cadiz, sailed thence with La Peña, the\r\nSpanish commander, and a combined force of about 12,000 men, to make a\r\nflank march, and attack the French besiegers, under Victor, in the rear.\r\nA brisk action followed at Barrosa, in which Graham obtained a complete\r\nvictory, but the Spanish troops, as usual, remained almost passive; the\r\nbeaten army was not pursued, and the siege of Cadiz was not raised.\r\nThis city was still the seat of the Spanish national government, but the\r\nfeeble junta had been superseded by a national cortes, fairly\r\nrepresentative of the nation, which passed some liberal measures, and\r\ndissolved the so-called regency which assumed to represent Ferdinand.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _FUENTES D'ONORO AND ALBUERA._]\r\n\r\nThe two great frontier fortresses of Spain, Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz,\r\nwere now in the hands of the French. Masséna had regained the Spanish\r\nfrontier in March, after frequent combats with the pursuing enemy, and\r\nwith heavy losses in men and horses, though he saved every gun except\r\none. This retreat involved the evacuation of every place in Portugal\r\nexcept the fortress of Almeida. Wellington's pursuit would have been\r\nstill more vigorous, but that his Portuguese troops were half-starved,\r\nand had lost discipline under intolerable privations. His next design\r\nseems to have been the recapture of the fortresses, but he was not\r\nwithout ulterior hopes--all too premature--of afterwards pushing on to\r\nMadrid and operating in the eastern provinces of Spain. He first\r\ninvested Almeida, and, leaving General Spencer to continue the blockade,\r\nproceeded to Elvas in order to concert measures with Beresford for the\r\nsiege of Badajoz. Thence he was suddenly recalled northward to repel a\r\nfresh advance of Masséna, strongly reinforced, for the relief of\r\nAlmeida. The battle which followed at Fuentes d'Oñoro, south-east of\r\nAlmeida, was among the most hardly contested struggles in the whole\r\nPeninsular war. It began on May 3, and, with a day's interval, concluded\r\non the 5th. The British remained masters of the field, and claimed a\r\nsomewhat doubtful victory, which at least secured the evacuation of\r\nAlmeida. The garrison of that fortress blew it up by night, and\r\nsucceeded, by masterly tactics, in joining the main French army with\r\nlittle sacrifice of life.\r\n\r\nWellington returned to Badajoz, only to meet with disappointment.\r\nGeneral Cole, acting under Beresford, had retaken Olivenza; but Soult,\r\nwith a force of 23,000 men, was marching to succour Badajoz, when he was\r\nencountered by Beresford at Albuera. Beresford's force was numerically\r\nstronger than Soult's, but only 7,000 men were English, the rest being\r\nmostly Spanish. Measured by the proportion of losses to men engaged on\r\nboth sides, this fight on May 16, 1811, must rank among the bloodiest on\r\nrecord. In four hours nearly 7,000 of the allies and 8,000 French were\r\nstruck down. The decisive charge of the reserve was inspired and led by\r\nHardinge, afterwards Governor-General of India; the French were routed,\r\nand Soult was checked, but little was gained by the victors.[48] The\r\nsiege of Badajoz, indeed, was renewed, but its progress was slow for\r\nwant of proper engines and artillery, and it was abandoned, after two\r\nfutile attempts, on June 11. By this time, Marmont had succeeded\r\nMasséna, and was carrying out Napoleon's grand plan for a junction with\r\nSoult's army and a fresh irruption into Portugal. With marvellous\r\naudacity, Wellington offered battle to both marshals, who, happily\r\nignorant of his weakness, declined it more than once. In truth, he was\r\nnever more nearly at the end of his resources than when he went into\r\nwinter quarters at the close of 1811, having failed to prevent Marmont\r\nfrom provisioning Ciudad Rodrigo, and having narrowly escaped being\r\noverwhelmed by a much superior force. His army was greatly reduced by\r\nsickness, he was very ill-supplied from England, and he received no\r\nloyal support from the Portuguese government. Moreover, the French had\r\napparently extended their hold on Spain, both in the eastern and\r\nnorthern provinces, while it was reported that Napoleon himself, not\r\ncontent with dictating orders from afar, would return to complete the\r\nconquest of the Peninsula.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, he must have been cheered by the arrival of so able a\r\nlieutenant as Graham from Cadiz, and by the brilliant success of Hill\r\nagainst a detached body of Marmont's army south of the Tagus. There were\r\nother tendencies also secretly working in favour of the British and\r\ntheir allies. Joseph Bonaparte, as King of Spain, openly protested\r\nagainst the extortions which he was enjoined to practise on his\r\nsubjects, and went so far as to resign his crown at Paris, though he was\r\ninduced to resume it. Again the broken armies of the Spanish had\r\nreappeared in the form of guerilla bands under leaders such as Mina;\r\nthey could not be dispersed, since they had no cohesion, and were more\r\nformidable through their extreme mobility than organised battalions.\r\nAbove all, the domination of France over Europe was already undermined\r\nand tottering invisibly to its fall. The Tsar Alexander had, as we have\r\nseen, been deeply offended by the preference of an Austrian to a Russian\r\nprincess, as the consort of Napoleon, and still more by his imperious\r\nannexation of Oldenburg. Sweden, following the example of Russia, had\r\nbegun to rebel against the continental system. A series of internal\r\nreforms had aroused a national spirit, and stealthily created the basis\r\nof a national army in Prussia, and the intense hostility of all North\r\nGermany to France was thinly disguised by the unwilling servility of the\r\nPrussian court. Napoleon, who seldom laboured under the illusions\r\npropagated by his own manifestoes and bulletins, well knew what he was\r\ndoing when, in August, 1811, he allowed himself to burst into a storm of\r\nindignation against the Russian ambassador at the Tuileries. From that\r\nmoment he clearly premeditated a rupture with Russia, and soon he\r\nwithdrew 60,000 of his best troops from Spain, to be employed in that\r\nfatal enterprise of 1812 which proved to be his doom.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _CAPTURE OF CIUDAD RODRIGO AND BADAJOZ._]\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1811-12 was spent by Wellington in preparing, with the\r\nutmost secrecy, for the sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz, as the\r\nfirst steps in an offensive campaign. In January, 1812, he struck a\r\nsudden blow against the former, and captured it by an assault, attended\r\nwith great carnage, on the 19th of that month. In this furious conflict,\r\nlasting but half an hour, Craufurd, the renowned leader of the light\r\ndivision, fell mortally wounded. Shameful excesses sullied the glory of\r\na splendid exploit. Marmont immediately drew in his troops towards\r\nSalamanca, leaving Soult in the valley of the Tagus; and Hill, with his\r\nsouthern army, moved northward. Wellington, who was created an earl in\r\nFebruary, transferred the greater part of his troops to Badajoz, and\r\nbegan a regular siege, but with very imperfect materials, no organised\r\ncorps of sappers and miners, and very few officers skilled in the art of\r\ntaking fortified towns. He was greatly delayed on the route by the lack\r\nof transport, and the vexatious obstinacy of the Portuguese authorities,\r\nwhile time was of the utmost consequence lest any or all of three French\r\narmies should come to raise the siege. Hence the extreme rapidity of his\r\nfinal operations.\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of an outlying fort, three breaches were made in the\r\nwalls, and on the night of April 6, under the cover of thick darkness,\r\ntwo divisions of British troops descended into the ditch, many carrying\r\nladders or sacks of hay, and advanced to the foot of the _glacis_. Here\r\nthey were almost overwhelmed with a hurricane of fiery missiles, and in\r\nmounting the breaches they had to face not only hand-grenades, trains of\r\npowder, and bursting shells, but a _chevaux-de-frise_ of sabre-blades\r\ncrowning the summit. None of these attacks was successful; but another\r\ndivision under Picton scaled the castle, and a brigade under Walker\r\neffected an entrance elsewhere. After this, the French abandoned the\r\nbreaches; the resistance waxed fainter, and at six in the morning,\r\nPhilippon, the governor, with his brave garrison, surrendered\r\nunconditionally. The loss of the British and Portuguese in killed and\r\nwounded was stated at the enormous figure of 4,885, and it was avenged\r\nby atrocities prolonged for two days and nights, worse than had followed\r\nthe storming of Ciudad Rodrigo. Wellington ordered the provost marshal\r\nto execute any soldiers found in the act of plunder, but officers vainly\r\nattempted to check their men at the peril of their own lives.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _SALAMANCA._]\r\n\r\nIt had been the intention of Wellington to operate next against Soult,\r\nand drive him, if possible, from Esdremadura and Andalusia. But, as\r\nappears from one of his despatches to Lord Liverpool, he was ill\r\nsatisfied with the conduct of his allies guarding Ciudad Rodrigo, and\r\nreturned to resume command in that region. In the same despatch he\r\ncomplains bitterly of the niggardly policy of his government in regard\r\nto money and supplies. The same timidity on the part of ministers at\r\nhome appears in a letter from Liverpool, almost forbidding him to accept\r\nthe command-in-chief of the Spanish armies, which, however, was\r\nconferred upon him later in this year.[49] At present, he decided to\r\nmarch against Marmont in the plains of Leon. This movement was\r\nfacilitated by the success of Hill in surprising a body of French\r\ntroops, and seizing the important bridge of Almaraz over the Tagus on\r\nMay 19, thereby breaking the French lines of communication and isolating\r\nMarmont's army for a time. Soon afterwards, Salamanca and its forts were\r\ncaptured by Wellington, but Marmont proved a very formidable opponent,\r\nand, having behind him another army under King Joseph, threatened the\r\nBritish lines of communication. In the series of manoeuvres which\r\nensued, Wellington's forces met with more than one reverse, but the\r\nFrench marshal was determined to win a victory on a large scale.\r\nWellington had no wish to risk a battle, unless Salamanca or his own\r\nrear should be seriously threatened, and he stood on the defensive, a\r\nlittle south of Salamanca, with Marmont's army encamped in front of him.\r\n\r\nEarly on July 22, the French seized one of two hills called the Arapiles\r\nwhich formed the key of the position and commanded the road to Ciudad\r\nRodrigo. Marmont then organised complicated evolutions, of which the\r\nultimate object was to envelop the British right and cut off its\r\nexpected retreat. To accomplish this, he extended his own left so far\r\nthat it became separated by a gap from his centre. No sooner did\r\nWellington, with a flash of military insight, perceive the advantage\r\nthus offered than he flung half of his troops upon the French left wing,\r\nand made a vigorous attack with the rest upon the French centre. It was\r\ntoo late for Marmont, himself wounded, to repair the mistake, the centre\r\nwas driven in, and, as was said, 40,000 men were beaten in forty\r\nminutes. General Clausel, who took Marmont's place, showed great ability\r\nin the retreat, but the French army could scarcely have escaped\r\ndestruction had not the Spaniards, who were entrusted with a post on the\r\nriver Tormes, left the passage open for the flying enemy. Nevertheless,\r\nthe battle of Salamanca was the greatest and most decisive yet fought by\r\nthe British in the Peninsula; it established the reputation of our army,\r\nand placed Wellington in the first rank of generals. Three weeks later\r\nhe entered Madrid in triumph, and was received with the wildest popular\r\nacclamations. Joseph once more abandoned his capital, joined Suchet in\r\nValencia, and ordered Soult against his will to withdraw from Andalusia\r\nand move in the same direction. This concentration relieved Wellington\r\nfrom immediate anxieties, but exposed him to a serious danger of being\r\nconfronted before long by forces thrice as great as his own. He also\r\nneeded reinforcements, and was in still greater want of money.\r\n\r\nTo students of military history it may seem a very doubtful question\r\nwhether, under such circumstances, it was prudent to advance farther\r\ninto Spain from his strongholds on the Portuguese frontier. But\r\nWellington, who had been created a marquis on August 18, judged it\r\nnecessary to crush if possible the remainder of Marmont's army which had\r\nretired northward under Clausel. He therefore left Hill with a\r\ndetachment to cover Madrid, and marching through Valladolid occupied the\r\ntown of Burgos. The castle of that place remained in the hands of a\r\nFrench garrison 2,000 strong and had been carefully fortified. Here\r\nagain we may be permitted to doubt whether, after the experience gained\r\nat Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz, Wellington did wisely in resolving to\r\ninvest and storm a fortress so formidable, without an adequate\r\nsiege-train, and with the knowledge that Clausel might rally his forces\r\nin time to relieve it. Wellington himself afterwards admitted to\r\nLiverpool that he had erred in not taking with him the best of his own\r\ntroops, and that he did not possess the means of transporting ordnance\r\nand military stores from Madrid and Santander, where there was abundance\r\nof them. The siege lasted a month, from September 19 to October 18; the\r\ngarrison offered a most obstinate resistance, inflicting great loss on\r\nthe besiegers by sorties, and in the end the attack failed. Souham, with\r\nClausel, was closing in upon Wellington from the north, Soult from the\r\nsouth-east; Hill's position at Madrid was untenable, and another retreat\r\nbecame inevitable. It was the last and most trying in Wellington's\r\nmilitary career. The army which had behaved nobly at Salamanca broke\r\ndown under the strain of suffering and depression, like that of Sir John\r\nMoore before Coruña. The enemy was driven back in various rear-guard\r\nactions, but on the march the sense of discipline vanished and shameful\r\ndisorders occurred. A scathing reprimand from Wellington, which might\r\nhave been written by a French critic and which ought never to have been\r\nmade public, threw all the blame of this disorganisation on the\r\nregimental officers, and denied that any scarcity of provisions could be\r\npleaded in excuse of it.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _MILITARY REFORMS._]\r\n\r\nBy the middle of November the campaign ended, and Wellington's\r\nheadquarters were at Ciudad Rodrigo. For the present, Spain was still\r\ndominated by the French, but its southern provinces were clear of the\r\ninvaders, and elsewhere the tide was already on the turn. The Russian\r\nwar cast its shadow beforehand on the Spanish peninsula; the French\r\narmy was constantly weakened in numbers and still more in quality, as\r\nconscripts were substituted for veterans, and inferior generals\r\nsucceeded to high commands; the Portuguese and Spanish contingents of\r\nthe British army were stronger and better disciplined. Wellington\r\nhimself, tenacious of his purpose as ever, received heartier support\r\nfrom home, where Liverpool had become prime minister in June, and had\r\nbeen succeeded by Bathurst as secretary for war and the colonies; and\r\nthough the Marquis Wellesley, no longer in the government, complained\r\nthat his brother's operations had been crippled by ministerial apathy,\r\nthe Peninsular war, on the eve of its completion, was adopted with pride\r\nand sympathy by the nation.\r\n\r\nThe last chapter of the Peninsular war opens with the operations\r\nculminating in the battle of Vitoria, and closes with the battle of\r\nToulouse. Having accepted the office of generalissimo of the Spanish\r\narmies, Wellington repaired to Cadiz during the winter of 1812-13, and\r\nformed the lowest estimate of the make-shift government there carried on\r\nunder the dual control of the cortes and the regency. He failed to\r\nobtain a reform of this system, but succeeded in effecting a\r\nreorganisation of the Spanish army, to be in future under his own\r\ncommand. He next addressed himself, with the aid of Beresford and the\r\nBritish minister at Lisbon, to amend the monstrous abuses, civil and\r\nmilitary, of Portuguese administration. By the beginning of May, 1813, a\r\ngreat improvement was visible in the equipment and _moral_ of the\r\nSpanish and Portuguese troops; a vigorous insurrection against the\r\nFrench occupation had broken out in the province of Biscay, endangering\r\nthe great road into Spain; and an Anglo-Sicilian army of 16,000 men,\r\nunder Sir John Murray, had repulsed Suchet, hitherto undefeated, at\r\nCastalla on the Valencian coast, without, however, completing their\r\nvictory, or capturing any of the French guns in the narrow defile by\r\nwhich the enemy fled. The want of unity in the command of the French\r\narmy, and of harmony between its generals, was more felt than ever now\r\nthat Napoleon's master-mind was engrossed in retrieving the awful ruin\r\nof the Russian expedition.\r\n\r\nYet Napoleon's instructions to Joseph show that he had fully grasped the\r\ncritical nature of the situation. He enjoined Joseph to mass all his\r\nforces round Valladolid, and imperatively directed that at all hazards\r\nthe communications with France should be maintained. The Spanish\r\nguerillas had long rendered communications so insecure that couriers\r\nwith despatches had to be escorted by bodies of 250 cavalry or 500\r\ninfantry; they were now so effectually intercepted that Napoleon's own\r\ndespatch reached Joseph more than two months late, by way of Barcelona\r\nand Valencia. Meanwhile, Joseph was openly accusing Soult, in a letter\r\nto his brother, of criminal ambition--a charge to which he laid himself\r\nopen before in Portugal--and did not hesitate to add, \"the Duke of\r\nDalmatia or myself must quit Spain\". In England, on the contrary,\r\nparties were at last united in the desire to bring the war to a\r\ntriumphant end, and parliament grudged neither men nor money to aid\r\nWellington's plan of campaign. It was, then, under happier auspices than\r\nin former years that he broke up from his cantonments then stationed on\r\nthe Coa, a little to the north-west of Ciudad Rodrigo, and set forward\r\nwith 70,000 British and Portuguese troops, besides 20,000 Spaniards, to\r\ndrive the French out of Spain. So confident was he of success that, as\r\nNapier relates, he waved his hand in crossing the frontier on May 22,\r\nand exclaimed, \"Farewell, Portugal\".[50]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _VITORIA._]\r\n\r\nHe advanced by the valley of the Douro; then, turning to the north-east,\r\nhe compelled the French to evacuate Burgos, and passed the Ebro on June\r\n13. Graham in command of his left wing there joined him, after forcing\r\nhis way by immense efforts across the mountains of the Portuguese\r\nfrontier. Hill, commanding the right wing of his composite but united\r\narmy, was already with him. A depot for his commissariat and a military\r\nhospital were established at Santander, where a British fleet was lying,\r\nand whence he could draw his supplies direct from home. The French army,\r\nunder Joseph and Marshal Jourdan, fell back before him by a forced night\r\nmarch on the 19th and took up its position in front of Vitoria, in the\r\nprovince of Biscay. Here, on the plain of the river Zadorra, was fought\r\non the 21st the greatest battle of the Peninsular war. Wellington had\r\nencountered serious physical difficulties in his passage from the valley\r\nof the Ebro to that of the Zadorra; but for once his plans had been\r\nexecuted with admirable precision, and all his troops arrived at the\r\nappointed time on the field of battle. The French, conscious of their\r\nimpending expulsion from Spain, were encumbered by enormous\r\nbaggage-trains containing the fruits of five years' merciless spoliation\r\n\"not of a province but of a kingdom,\" including treasures of art from\r\nMadrid and all the provincial capitals, with no less than 5,500,000\r\ndollars in hard cash, besides two years' arrears of pay which Napoleon\r\nhad sent to fill the military chest of Joseph's army. A vast number of\r\nvehicles, loaded with the whole imperial and royal treasure, overspread\r\nthe plain and choked the great road behind the French position, by which\r\nalone such a mass of waggons could find its way into France.\r\n\r\nThe French army consisted of about 60,000 men, with 150 pieces of\r\ncannon, but strong detachments, under Foy and Clausel respectively, had\r\nbeen sent away to guard the roads to Bilbao and Pamplona. The British\r\narmy numbered nearly 80,000, inclusive of Portuguese and Spanish, with\r\n90 guns. The French were posted on strong ground, and held the bridges\r\nacross the river. Graham, with the left column of the British, made a\r\ncircuit in the direction of Bilbao, working round to cut off the French\r\nrear on the Bayonne road. Hill, with the right column, forced the pass\r\nof Puebla, in the latter direction, carried the ridge above it after\r\nmuch hard fighting, and made good his position on the left flank of the\r\nFrench. Wellington himself, in the centre, under the guidance of a\r\nSpanish peasant, pushed a brigade across one of the bridges in his\r\nfront, weakly guarded, and thus mastered the others; his force then\r\nexpanded itself on the plain and bore down all opposition. Graham had\r\nmet with a more obstinate resistance from the French right, under\r\nReille, but at last got possession of the great Bayonne road.\r\nThenceforward a retreat of the French army, partly encircled, became\r\ninevitable, but it was conducted at first in good order and with\r\nfrequent halts at defensible points. The only outlet left open was the\r\nmountain road to Pamplona, and this was not only impracticable for heavy\r\ntraffic but obstructed by an overturned waggon. The orderly retreat was\r\nsoon converted into a rout; the flying throng made its way across\r\ncountry and over mountains towards Pamplona, leaving all the artillery,\r\nmilitary stores, and accumulated spoils as trophies of the British\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nThe value of these was prodigious, but the great mass of booty, except\r\nmunitions of war, fell into the hands of private soldiers and\r\ncamp-followers. Wellington reported to Bathurst that nearly a million\r\nsterling in money had been appropriated by the rank and file of the\r\narmy, and, still worse, that so dazzling a triumph had \"totally\r\nannihilated all order and discipline\".[51] The loss in the battle had\r\nbeen about 5,000, but Wellington stated that on July 8 \"we had 12,500\r\nmen less under arms than we had on the day before the battle\". He\r\nsupposed the missing 7,500, nearly half of whom were British, to be\r\nmostly concealed in the mountain villages.[52] A large number of\r\nstragglers afterwards rejoined their colours, but too late to aid in an\r\neffectual pursuit of the enemy. The immediate consequence of this great\r\nvictory was the evacuation by the French of all Spain south of the Ebro.\r\nEven Suchet abandoned Valencia and distributed his forces between\r\nTarragona and Tortosa. To his great credit, Wellington addressed to the\r\ncortes an earnest protest against wreaking vengeance on the French party\r\nin Spain, many of whom might have been driven into acceptance of a\r\nforeign yoke \"by terror, by distress, or by despair\". At the same time,\r\nhe vigorously followed up his success by chasing and nearly surrounding\r\nClausel's division, while Hill invested Pamplona, and Graham drove Foy\r\nacross the Bidassoa, in his advance upon the fortress of St. Sebastian.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE BATTLE OF THE PYRENEES._]\r\n\r\nThe fortifications of St. Sebastian were in a very imperfect condition,\r\nbut the governor, Emmanuel Rey, was nevertheless able to defend the\r\nplace with success. Wellington, after laying siege to it, sanctioned a\r\npremature attempt to scale the breaches which cost Graham's force a loss\r\nof more than 500 men. This check was succeeded by another, still more\r\nserious, in the historic pass of Roncesvalles. Napoleon, hearing at\r\nDresden of the battle of Vitoria, and instantly fathoming its momentous\r\nimport, despatched Soult, as \"lieutenant of the emperor,\" to assume\r\ncommand of all the French armies at Bayonne and on the Spanish frontier,\r\nstill amounting nominally to 114,000 men, besides 66,000 under Suchet in\r\nCatalonia. Soult reached Bayonne on July 13, fortified it strongly, and\r\nreorganised his troops with amazing energy, inspiriting them with a\r\nwarlike address in the well-known style of Napoleon's proclamations. On\r\nthe 25th he set his forces in motion, with the intention of crushing the\r\nBritish right by a sudden irruption, and relieving Pamplona. He all but\r\nachieved his object, for, by well-concerted and well-concealed\r\nmovements, he actually carried the passes of Roncesvalles and Maya, in\r\nspite of a gallant resistance and the French troops were on the point of\r\npouring down the Pyrenees on the Spanish side, when Wellington arrived\r\nat full speed from his position before St. Sebastian.\r\n\r\nHe was opportunely reinforced, and gave battle on the rugged heights in\r\nfront of Pamplona to a force numerically superior, but for the most part\r\ncharging uphill. Never, even at Bussaco, did the French show greater\r\nardour and _élan_ in attack, and it was only after a series of bloody\r\nhand-to-hand combats on the summits and sides of the mountains that they\r\nwere compelled to recoil and rolled backward down the ridge. Baffled in\r\nhis attempt to relieve Pamplona, Soult turned westwards towards St.\r\nSebastian, but was anticipated by Wellington, and faced by three\r\ndivisions of Hill on his right. A second engagement followed, in which\r\nthe Portuguese earned the chief honours, and 3,000 prisoners were taken.\r\nAt last Soult gave orders for a retreat, and in the course of it was all\r\nbut entrapped in a narrow valley where he could not have escaped the\r\nnecessity of surrender. It is said that he was warned just in time by\r\nthe sudden intrusion of three British marauders in uniform; at all\r\nevents, he instantly changed his line of march, and ultimately led his\r\nbroken army back to France, but in the utmost confusion, and not without\r\nfresh disasters. One of these befell Reille's division in the gorge of\r\nYanzi, and another the French rear-guard under Clausel, which defended\r\nitself valiantly, but was driven headlong down the northern side of the\r\nPyrenees from which this series of battles derives its name.\r\n\r\nThe siege of St. Sebastian was immediately renewed with a far more\r\npowerful battering train, but its defences had also been strengthened by\r\nthe indefatigable governor. The final assault took place on August 31,\r\nand rivalled the storming of Badajoz in the murderous ferocity of the\r\n_melée_ at the breaches, as well as in the horrors practised on the\r\ninhabitants by the victorious assailants, which Wellington and Graham\r\nvainly endeavoured to check. So desperate was the defence, and so\r\ninsuperable appeared the obstacles to an entrance by the breaches, that\r\nGraham adopted the heroic expedient of causing his artillery to fire a\r\nfew feet only over the heads of the forlorn hope, until a clear opening\r\nhad been made, and deadly piles of combustibles had been exploded behind\r\nthe main breach, blowing into the air 300 of the garrison. A hideous\r\nconflagration destroyed the greater part of the town. A few days later\r\nthe castle, to which the governor had retired, yielded to an\r\nirresistible cannonade, and he surrendered at discretion with about\r\n1,200 men. Several hundred wounded, including a large number of British\r\nprisoners, were found there in the hospitals.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th, the day before St. Sebastian was stormed, Soult attempted a\r\ndiversion for its relief by crossing the Bidassoa, and on the following\r\nday he engaged a large body of Spaniards at St. Marcial. On this\r\noccasion Wellington held the British troops in reserve, and the\r\nSpaniards without their aid defeated the French with great slaughter. So\r\nended a well-planned and well-executed effort to reconquer the Spanish\r\nfrontier. Pamplona was still untaken, and Suchet was still in Catalonia,\r\nbut no further offensive movement was undertaken by the French against\r\nSpain. Both Soult and Wellington had shown remarkable powers of\r\ngeneralship, and there was a moment when Soult might have snatched the\r\nprize of victory by raising the siege of Pamplona. But his ultimate\r\nsuccess was hopeless, and his failure was complete. Before the fall of\r\nSt. Sebastian and the battle of St. Marcial, Wellington estimated the\r\nFrench losses at 15,000 men, who could ill be spared in the interval\r\nbetween Napoleon's last gleam of victory at Dresden and on his signal\r\ndefeat at Leipzig.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _WELLINGTON ENTERS FRANCE._]\r\n\r\nBut the Peninsular war, in the historical sense, was not yet over.\r\nDuring the summer of 1813 a mixed force of British, Germans, Spaniards,\r\nand Sicilians had been carrying on an intermittent war against the\r\nFrench under Suchet in the eastern provinces. Their commander, Sir John\r\nMurray, who had allowed the beaten enemy to escape at Castalla, proved\r\nequally irresolute in an attempt to capture Tarragona, countermanded the\r\nassault, and re-embarked his troops on the approach of Suchet. Soon\r\nafterwards he was superseded by Lord William Bentinck, and Suchet after\r\nthe battle of Vitoria was compelled to retire behind the Ebro. Bentinck\r\nrenewed the investment of Tarragona, but permitted Suchet without a\r\nbattle to relieve it, demolish its fortifications, and withdraw its\r\ngarrison at the end of August. An ill-judged advance of the British\r\ngeneral into Catalonia brought about another misfortune, and, upon the\r\nwhole, the series of operations conducted against Suchet were by no\r\nmeans glorious to British arms or generalship, however important their\r\neffect in preventing a large body of French veterans from reinforcing\r\nSoult's army at a critical time in the Western Pyrenees. Wellington\r\nhimself inclined to complete the deliverance of Spain by clearing the\r\nprovince of Catalonia of the invaders, but the British government,\r\nhaving in view the prospect of crushing Napoleon in Germany, urged him\r\nto undertake an immediate invasion of France. Accordingly he moved\r\nforward on October 7, leaving Pamplona closely blockaded, threw his army\r\nacross the Bidassoa on the 8th by a stroke of masterly tactics, forced\r\nthe strong French lines on the north side of it, and established himself\r\non the enemy's soil. Before entering France he issued the most stringent\r\nproclamations against plundering, which he enforced by the sternest\r\nmeasures, and announced that he would not suffer the peaceful\r\ninhabitants of France to be punished for the ambition of their ruler. On\r\nthe 31st the French garrison of Pamplona, despairing of relief,\r\nsurrendered as prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nThe prolonged defence of Pamplona gave Soult time to strengthen his\r\nposition on the Nivelle. The lines which he constructed rivalled those\r\nof Torres Vedras, and the several actions by which they were at last\r\nforced and turned were among the most desperate of the whole war. The\r\nfirst was fought in the early part of November, and resulted in the\r\noccupation by Wellington's army of the great mountain-barrier south of\r\nBayonne, with six miles of entrenchments along the Nivelle, and of the\r\nport of St. Jean de Luz. A month later Wellington became anxious to\r\nestablish his winter-cantonments between the Nive and the Adour, partly\r\nfor strategical reasons, and partly in order to command a larger and\r\nmore fertile area for his supplies. On December 9, therefore, Hill with\r\nthe right wing forded the Nive and drove back the French left upon their\r\ncamp in front of Bayonne. Then followed three most obstinate combats on\r\nthe 10th, 11th and 13th, in which Soult took the offensive, with Bayonne\r\nas the centre of his operations, and with the advantage of always moving\r\nupon interior lines resting upon a strong fortress. In the first of\r\nthese attacks, he surprised and nearly succeeded in overwhelming the\r\nBritish left, under Hope, now Sir John, before Wellington could bring\r\nother divisions to its support. In the second, he fell suddenly on the\r\nsame troops, exhausted by fatigue, and still more or less isolated, but\r\nthey were rallied by Hope and Wellington in person, and remained masters\r\nof the field. In the third he concentrated his whole strength upon the\r\nBritish right under Hill, aided by a thick mist, and by a flood upon the\r\nNive, which swept away a bridge of boats, and separated Hill from the\r\nrest of the army. Nevertheless, that able general, emulating the noble\r\nexample of Hope in the earlier encounters, succeeded in repelling\r\nassault after assault, until Wellington himself appeared with\r\nreinforcements of imposing strength, and converted a stubborn defence\r\ninto a victory.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the allies since crossing the Nive had exceeded 5,000; that\r\nof the French was 6,000, besides 2,400 Germans who deserted to the\r\nBritish during the night of the 9th in obedience to orders from home.\r\nEver since he assumed the command Soult had shown military ability of a\r\nrare order. Bayonne, the base of all his operations, was indefensible\r\nbefore he fortified it. A great proportion of his troops were raw\r\nconscripts, or demoralised by defeat, before he inspired them with his\r\nown courage and vigour. He was practically dependent for subsistence in\r\nhis own country on the very system of pillage which had roused a\r\npatriotic frenzy of resentment in Spain and other lands ravaged by\r\nFrench armies. He now stood at bay in the south of France, as Wellington\r\nhad so long stood at bay in Portugal, and continued there during the\r\nearly part of 1814 a defensive campaign not unworthy of comparison with\r\nthe prodigious exploits of Napoleon himself against the invaders of his\r\neastern provinces.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE INVESTMENT OF BAYONNE._]\r\n\r\nA respite of two months succeeded the battles on the Nive. During this\r\ninterval Wellington's difficulty in paying his troops was great, owing\r\nto the enormous drain of specie from England into Central Europe. He was\r\nfurther embarrassed by the appearance of the Duke of Angoulême, elder\r\nson of Charles, Count of Artois, afterwards Charles X., at his\r\nheadquarters. The British government was by no means committed to a\r\nrestoration of the Bourbons, and Wellington deprecated the duke's\r\nappearance as at least premature. He therefore insisted upon his\r\nremaining incognito and as a non-combatant at St. Jean de Luz. Soult\r\nwas in great straits, not only because he was compelled to \"make war\r\nsupport war\" by exorbitant requisitions upon the French peasantry, but\r\nalso because the exigencies of Napoleon were such that large drafts of\r\nthe best troops were drawn from the army of the south. When hostilities\r\nwere resumed in the middle of February, 1814, the Anglo-Portuguese and\r\nSpanish force combined outnumbered the French by nearly five to three,\r\nbut Soult retained the decisive advantage of having a strong _point\r\nd'appui_ in Bayonne at the confluence of the Nive and Adour. Careful\r\npreparations were made by Wellington for throwing a large force across\r\nthe Lower Adour below Bayonne, in concert with a British fleet. Contrary\r\nwinds and a violent surf delayed the arrival of the British gunboats,\r\nbut on February 23 Hope sent over a body of his men on a raft of\r\npontoons in the face of the enemy's flotilla, with the aid of a brigade\r\narmed with Congreve rockets, which had been first used at Leipzig, and\r\nproduced the utmost consternation in the French ranks. The gunboats soon\r\nfollowed, but with the loss of one wrecked and others stranded in\r\ncrossing the bar. By the joint exertions of soldiers and sailors a\r\nbridge was then constructed, by which Hope's entire army with artillery\r\npassed over the river, and, two days afterwards, began the investment of\r\nBayonne.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the centre and right wing, under the command of Wellington,\r\nhad forced a passage across the Upper Adour and threatened Bayonne on\r\nthe other side. Leaving a garrison of 6,000 men in Bayonne, Soult took\r\nhis stand at Orthez, with an army of about 40,000 men, on the summit of\r\na formidable ridge. Wellington attacked this ridge on the 27th, with a\r\nforce of nearly equal strength in three columns so disposed as to\r\nconverge from points several miles distant from each other. The veterans\r\nof the French army, admirably handled, fought with tenacity, and all but\r\nsucceeded in foiling the attack before Wellington could bring up his\r\nreserves. The conscripts, however, were not equally steady, and when\r\nHill, advancing from the extreme right, pressed upon the French left,\r\nSoult's orderly retreat became a precipitate flight. The French loss\r\ngreatly exceeded the British, and was soon afterwards swelled by\r\nwholesale desertions; the road to Bordeaux was thrown open, and the\r\nroyalist reaction against Napoleon, stimulated by the depredation of\r\nthe French troops, ripened into a general revolt.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Napoleon had lost Germany by the battle of Leipzig; early in\r\n1814 the allied armies of Austria, Prussia, and Russia had entered\r\nFrance, and a congress was being held at Châtillon-sur-Seine, to\r\nformulate, if possible, terms of peace. The city of Bordeaux was the\r\nfirst to declare itself openly in favour of the Bourbons. Wellington\r\nsent a large detachment to preserve order, with strict instructions to\r\nBeresford, who commanded it, to remain neutral, in the event of Louis\r\nXVIII. being proclaimed, pending the negotiations with Napoleon at\r\nChâtillon. But the excitement of the people could not be restrained, and\r\nthe arrival of the Duke of Angoulême evoked a burst of royalist\r\nenthusiasm which anticipated by a few weeks only the abdication of\r\nNapoleon at Fontainebleau. The defection of Bordeaux forced Soult to\r\nfall back rapidly on a very formidable position in front of Toulouse.\r\nThe British army followed in pursuit, encumbered with a great artillery\r\nand pontoon train. After a lively action at Tarbes, it arrived in front\r\nof Toulouse on March 27, to find the Garonne in flood, and the French\r\narmy strongly entrenched around the town, with a prospect of being\r\njoined by 20,000 or 30,000 veterans, under Suchet, from Catalonia.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE BATTLE OF TOULOUSE._]\r\n\r\nThe dispositions of Wellington, ending in the battle of Toulouse, on\r\nApril 10, have not escaped criticism. Hill, with two divisions and a\r\nSpanish contingent, threw a bridge across the Garonne below Toulouse,\r\nbut discovered that he could make no progress in that direction, owing\r\nto the impassable state of the roads. Beresford crossed the river with\r\n18,000 men at another point, but a sudden flood broke up the pontoon\r\nbridge in his rear, and he remained isolated for no less than four days,\r\nexposed to an attack from Soult's whole army. Having missed this rare\r\nopportunity, Soult calmly awaited the attack, with a force numerically\r\ninferior, but with every advantage of position. On the 10th Wellington's\r\ntroops advanced in two columns, separated from each other by a perilous\r\ninterval of two miles. One of these, including Freyre's Spaniards and\r\nPicton's division, was fairly driven back after furious attempts to\r\nstorm the ramparts of the fortified ridge held by the French. Beresford,\r\nhowever, who in this battle combined generalship with brilliant\r\ncourage, restored the fortunes of the day by a dashing advance against\r\nthe redoubts on the French right. Having carried these he swept along\r\nthe ridge, which became untenable, and Soult withdrew his army within\r\nhis second line of defences. Two days later, seeing that Hill menaced\r\nToulouse on the other side, and fearing that if defeated again he would\r\nlose his only line of retreat along the Carcassonne road, he evacuated\r\nToulouse by that route, leaving his magazines and hospitals in the hands\r\nof the British army. By so doing he left to Wellington the honour and\r\nprize of victory, but few victories have been so dearly bought, and the\r\nloss in killed and wounded was actually greater on the side of the\r\nvictors than on that of the vanquished.\r\n\r\nToulouse received Wellington on the 12th with open arms, and as news\r\nreached him on the same day announcing the proclamation of Louis XVIII.\r\nat Paris, he no longer hesitated to assume the white cockade. Soult\r\nloyally declined to accept the intelligence until it was officially\r\nconfirmed, when a military convention was made on the 18th, whereby a\r\nboundary line was established between the two armies. Suchet had already\r\nwithdrawn from Spain, and at last recalled the garrisons from those\r\nSpanish fortresses in which Napoleon had so obstinately locked up picked\r\ntroops which he sorely needed in his dire extremity. But on the 14th, a\r\nweek after Napoleon's abdication, the famous \"sortie from Bayonne\" took\r\nplace, in which each side lost 800 or 900 men, and Hope, wounded in two\r\nplaces, was made prisoner. For this waste of life the governor of\r\nBayonne must be held responsible, since he was informed of the events at\r\nParis by Hope, and instead of awaiting official confirmation, like\r\nSoult, chose to risk the issue of a night combat, which must needs be\r\ndeadly and could not be decisive.\r\n\r\nThus ended the Peninsular war. This war on the British side has seldom\r\nbeen surpassed in the steady adherence to a settled purpose, through\r\nyears of discouragement and failure, maintained by the general whose\r\nname it has made immortal. Neither his strategy nor his tactical skill\r\nwas always faultless; and afterwards in comparing himself with Soult, he\r\nis reported to have said, that he often got into scrapes, but was\r\nextricated by the valour of his army, whereas Soult, when he got into a\r\nscrape, had no such men to get him out of it. However this might be,\r\nWellington's foresight in appreciating the place to be filled by the\r\nPeninsular war in the overthrow of Napoleon's domination, and his truly\r\nheroic constancy in striving to realise his own idea will ever\r\nconstitute his best claim to greatness. No other man in England or in\r\nEurope discerned as he did, that with Portugal independent and guarded\r\nby the power of Great Britain on its western coast and its eastern\r\nfrontier, the permanent conquest of Spain by the French would become\r\nimpossible. No one else saw beforehand, what Napoleon discovered too\r\nlate, that a war in Portugal and Spain would drain the life-blood of his\r\ninvincible hosts, and at length help towards the invasion of France\r\nitself. No other general would have shown equal statesmanship in\r\nmanaging Spanish juntas and controlling even Spanish guerillas, or equal\r\nforbearance in sparing the French people the evils which a victorious\r\narmy might have inflicted upon them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[42] Napier, _Peninsular War_ (3rd edition), i., 123.\r\n\r\n[43] For Moore's campaign see Napier, _Peninsular War_, i., pp.\r\nxxi.-xxv., lvii.-lxxvi., 330-44, 431-542, and Oman, _Peninsular War_,\r\ni., 486-602; and compare Moore's _Diary_, edited by Maurice, ii.,\r\n272-398.

On Russia's part the adherence to a\r\ndefensive policy delayed action until France was ready. But there was\r\nanother reason why the preparations for war were only slowly pushed\r\nforward. Even at the court of St. Petersburg there was a French party\r\nwhich retarded such preparations as committing Russia too definitely to\r\nan open rupture. On the part of France, also, delay was necessary.\r\nThough deliberately provoked by himself, the war was not altogether\r\nwelcome to Napoleon. It suited him best to have a strong but friendly\r\nneighbour in Russia, and victory promised him but the half-hearted\r\nfriendship of a power to which he could no longer dare to leave much\r\nstrength. Besides it was necessary to make far more extensive\r\npreparations than had been required for any of his previous campaigns.\r\nRussia was too poor and too thinly peopled for it to be possible for war\r\nto support itself, and immense supplies with correspondingly large\r\ntransport arrangements were needed for a large army which would have to\r\nfight at so vast a distance from its base. It would have been impossible\r\nto be ready in time for a summer campaign in 1811; the country was not\r\nfavourable to transport on a large scale during winter, and the war was\r\ntherefore postponed till the summer of 1812. The end of May or beginning\r\nof June was the date originally selected for the beginning of\r\noperations, as it was expected that the difficulty of providing fodder\r\nwould be greatly reduced when the grass had grown. But the preparations\r\nwere not sufficiently advanced by that date, and hostilities were only\r\nopened on June 24.\r\n\r\nThe interval was spent by both powers in securing allies and pacifying\r\nenemies. Early in the year 1812 Prussia had made a last attempt to avert\r\na French alliance by inviting Russia to join in a peaceful compromise.\r\nAfter the failure of this negotiation her position was helpless, and\r\nresembled that of Poland before its national extinction. Russia could\r\nnot become her active ally without exposing her own army to destruction\r\nat a second Friedland, and Prussia could not fight France alone.\r\nFrederick William, therefore, accepted the terms dictated by Napoleon.\r\nBy a treaty concluded on February 24 he agreed to supply the emperor\r\nwith 20,000 men to serve as a part of the French army, and was to raise\r\nno levies and give no orders without his consent. The king was also to\r\nafford a free passage and provide food and forage for the French troops,\r\npayment for which was to be arranged afterwards. In return for this a\r\nreduction was made in the war indemnity due to France. This was probably\r\nas much as Napoleon could have obtained without authorising a dangerous\r\nincrease in the Prussian army.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _RUSSIAN ALLIANCES._]\r\n\r\nAustria was more fortunate, because an Austrian war would have been a\r\nserious diversion, not a step towards the invasion of Russia. She was in\r\nconsequence able to impose her own terms on France. These terms, so far\r\nas the nature and extent of the Austrian assistance to France were\r\nconcerned, had been sketched by Metternich to the British agent, Nugent,\r\nas far back as November, 1811, and they were accepted by France in a\r\ntreaty of March 16, 1812.[54] Austria was to provide an army of 30,000\r\nmen to guard Napoleon's flank in Volhynia. In return France guaranteed\r\nthe integrity of Turkey, and secretly promised a restoration of the\r\nIllyrian provinces to Austria in exchange for Galicia, which was to form\r\na part of a reconstituted Poland. Elsewhere Napoleon's negotiations were\r\nunsuccessful. In January he fulfilled his threat of occupying Swedish\r\nPomerania, but it had no effect on Swedish policy, and when in March he\r\noffered Finland and a part of Norway as the price of an alliance, his\r\nterms were rejected and Sweden allied herself with Russia. On April 17\r\nNapoleon made overtures for peace with Great Britain, offering to\r\nevacuate Spain and to recognise the house of Braganza in Portugal and\r\nthe Bourbons in Sicily, if the British would recognise the \"actual\r\ndynasty\" in Spain and Murat in Naples. The offer was certainly illusory.\r\n\"Actual dynasty\" was an ambiguous phrase, but would naturally mean the\r\nBonapartes. Castlereagh declined to recognise Joseph, but declared his\r\nreadiness to discuss the proposed basis if \"actual dynasty\" meant a\r\nrecognition of Ferdinand VII. in Spain. Napoleon was enabled to say that\r\nhis offers of peace had been rejected, and made no answer to\r\nCastlereagh.\r\n\r\nRussia in her turn had to conciliate the Porte, Sweden, Persia, and\r\nGreat Britain. The Turkish negotiations were prolonged, and it was only\r\nin May that the treaty of Bucharest was signed, by which Russia gave up\r\nall her conquests except Bessarabia. Sweden had offered Russia her\r\nalliance in February. She was prepared to surrender Finland to Russia on\r\ncondition that Russia should assist her in the conquest of Norway. A\r\njoint army was to effect this conquest and then make a descent on North\r\nGermany, threatening the rear of the French army of invasion. The\r\nadhesion of Great Britain was to be invited. On April 5 an alliance\r\nbetween Russia and Sweden was signed on the terms suggested. This was\r\nfollowed on August 28 by the treaty of Åbo, which was signed in the\r\npresence of the British representative, Lord Cathcart. By this treaty\r\nRussia was to assist Sweden with 30,000 men and a loan, Sweden undertook\r\nto support Russia's claim, when it should be made, for an extension of\r\nher frontier to the Vistula. Shortly afterwards it was agreed to\r\npostpone the attack on Norway till the following year, and thus at\r\nlength the Russian army in Finland was set free. The treaties with the\r\nPorte and Sweden were too late to liberate troops to oppose Napoleon's\r\nadvance, but the troops thus liberated greatly endangered his retreat.\r\nWith Persia no peace could be made. Great Britain was still nominally at\r\nwar both with Russia and with Sweden. Negotiations with Russia in April\r\ncame to nothing because the British government refused to take over a\r\nloan of £4,000,000, but on July 18 a treaty of alliance between the\r\nthree powers was signed, in which Great Britain promised pecuniary aid\r\nto Russia. A further sign of friendship was given when the tsar handed\r\nover the Cronstadt fleet for safekeeping to the British. The formal\r\ntreaty was, however, only the public recognition of a friendship and\r\nmutual confidence which had begun with the breach between Russia and\r\nFrance. This good understanding was shared by the nominal allies of\r\nFrance, Prussia and Austria. Russia was fully informed of the military\r\nand political plans of Austria, and knew that her forces would not fight\r\nexcept under compulsion.\r\n\r\nAt last, on June 24, Napoleon's grand army began the passage of the\r\nNiemen, which formed the boundary between the duchy of Warsaw and the\r\nRussian empire. The main body, at least 300,000 strong, was commanded by\r\nNapoleon himself. A northern division, including the Prussian\r\ncontingent, was commanded by Macdonald, and, after advancing to Riga,\r\nwhich it pretended to besiege, remained idle throughout the campaign.\r\nThe Austrians, under Schwarzenberg, formed a southern division, but they\r\nmerely manoeuvred, and made no serious attempts to impede the\r\nmovements of the southern Russian army on its return journey from the\r\nwar on the Danube. Napoleon himself drove the main Russian armies before\r\nhim in the direction of Moscow. At last Kutuzov, who had taken over the\r\ncommand of the Russians in the course of the retreat, made a stand at\r\nBorodino, where on September 7 one of the bloodiest battles on record\r\nwas fought. The figures are variously given, but the French army\r\nprobably lost over 30,000 in killed and wounded out of a force of\r\n125,000; and the Russians lost not less than 40,000 out of an army of\r\nslightly smaller dimensions. This awful carnage ended, after all, in\r\nlittle more than a trial of strength. The French gained the ground, but\r\nthe Russians made good their retreat, and six days later Kutuzov retired\r\nthrough the streets of Moscow, taking the better part of the population\r\nand all the military stores with him. The French vanguard entered on the\r\n14th, and Napoleon himself next day. A fire, kindled either by accident\r\nor by Russian incendiaries, raged from the 14th to the 20th and\r\ndestroyed three-fourths of the city.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _NAPOLEON'S RETREAT FROM MOSCOW._]\r\n\r\nThe capture of Moscow was far from being the triumph that the French\r\nemperor had anticipated. Deceived by his recollections of Tilsit, he had\r\nfully counted upon receiving pacific overtures from Alexander or at\r\nleast upon his eager acceptance of conciliatory assurances from himself.\r\nBut as the weeks passed and the vision of negotiation with the Russians\r\nproved illusory, retreat became inevitable. On the night of October 18\r\nthe French army, now about 115,000 strong, evacuated Moscow. Kutuzov,\r\nwho was stronger in cavalry, though perhaps still weaker in infantry,\r\nhung upon its rear, and, while avoiding a pitched battle, was able to\r\nprevent Napoleon from retreating by any other route than the now\r\ndevastated line of his advance. It has often been questioned whether\r\nKutuzov did not deliberately refrain from destroying the French army. He\r\ncertainly informed Sir Robert Wilson on one occasion that he did not\r\nwish to drive Napoleon to extremities, lest his supremacy should go to\r\nthe power that ruled the sea. The remark may have been nothing more than\r\nan outburst of ill-temper, but, whatever the motive, there can be no\r\ndoubt as to the policy adopted. The retreating French army suffered\r\nterrible hardships from the cold, for which it was ill prepared. Twice\r\nit seemed on the point of falling into the hands of the Russians; at\r\nKrasnoe 26,000 prisoners are said to have been captured by Kutuzov's\r\narmy, while at Borisov the southern army under Chichagov and the army\r\nreturning from Finland under Wittgenstein joined hands, and disputed the\r\nFrench passage of the Berezina on November 26-29. According to\r\nChambray's calculation, the French army numbered 31,000 combatants\r\nbefore the passage, of whom but 9,000 remained on December 1. All the\r\nnon-combatants had been left in the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThis was the last direct attack made by the Russians on the relics of\r\nthe grand army. But the worst ravages of the Russian winter had yet to\r\ncome. On December 3 the cold became intense. As the survivors of the\r\nexpedition dragged themselves homewards through the Polish provinces,\r\nthey were met by large bodies of reinforcements pouring in from the\r\nwest; these recruits, comparatively fresh, were at first appalled by the\r\ngaunt and famine-stricken aspect of the returning veterans, but soon\r\nperished themselves in nearly equal numbers. It is estimated that\r\naltogether only 60,000 men recrossed the frontier out of a total of\r\n630,000, and in the estimate of 60,000 is included Macdonald's division,\r\nwhich was exposed to comparatively little hardship. That division with\r\nthe Prussian contingent began to fall back on December 19. On the 30th,\r\nhowever, the Prussians were reduced to neutrality by the convention of\r\nTauroggen, signed by the Prussian commander, Yorck, with the Russians,\r\nwithout the sanction of his government. Had Russia been in a condition\r\nto press onwards at once and carry the war into French territory, it is\r\npossible that Europe might have been spared the misery and bloodshed of\r\nthe next few years. But, for the moment, her strength and resources were\r\nexhausted, nor was it until months had elapsed that other nations, or\r\neven France herself, became aware of the magnitude of the catastrophe\r\nwhich had overtaken Napoleon's host. That he was able to rally himself\r\nafter it, to carry the French people with him, to enforce a new\r\nconscription, and to assume the aggressive in the campaign of 1813, must\r\never remain a supreme proof of his capacity for empire.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _DISPUTES WITH THE UNITED STATES._]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1812 war broke out between Great Britain and the United\r\nStates. For a time the continental warfare had led to a great increase\r\nin American commerce, which was free from the attacks of privateers and\r\nfrom the restrictions which the opposing parties placed on one another.\r\nPresently, however, both parties attempted to force the United States\r\ninto a virtual alliance with themselves. Orders in council on the one\r\nside and imperial decrees on the other had, as we have seen, declared a\r\nblockade of the ports of the continent of Europe and of Great Britain,\r\nand the United States saw their commerce threatened with disabilities\r\napproximating to those suffered by the belligerent powers. President\r\nJefferson, who was supported by the republican party, adhered to a\r\npolicy of strict neutrality, and prepared to suffer any commercial loss\r\nrather than be drawn into an European war. The only action which he took\r\nwas the defence of the river mouths with a view to resisting any\r\noffensive movement. The federalist party on the other hand were in\r\nfavour of energetic action against France, so as to secure English\r\nfavour and the great commercial privileges which the mistress of the\r\nseas could bestow. For a time no hostilities resulted, but constant\r\nirritation was caused by the British claim to a right of search and to\r\nthe impressment of sailors of British nationality found on American\r\nships, while American ships accused of infringing the blockade were\r\nseized by either of the European combatants. To some extent the\r\ndifferences between Great Britain and the United States depended on\r\nrival views of the law of allegiance. The British maintained the\r\ndoctrine _nemo potest exuere patriam_, and regarded all British-born\r\npersons, unless absolved from their allegiance by the act of the\r\nmother-country, as British subjects. The law of the United States, on\r\nthe other hand, permitted an alien to become a citizen after fourteen\r\nyears' residence, and previously to 1798 had required a residence of\r\nfive years only. In this way it often happened that sailors who had\r\nreceived the American citizenship were impressed for service on British\r\nships, and sometimes sailors of actual American birth were impressed.\r\nBut it was impossible to justify the practice to which the Americans\r\nresorted of receiving deserters of British nationality from British\r\nships of war, who were induced by offers of higher pay to transfer\r\nthemselves to the American service.\r\n\r\nJefferson at first preferred to coerce the European powers by\r\nretaliatory legislation. As early as April, 1806, a law had been passed\r\nforbidding the importation of certain British wares, but was suspended\r\nsix weeks after it came into operation. In June, 1807, irritation was\r\nintensified by the incident of the _Leopard_ and the _Chesapeake_. Five\r\nmen, four of whom were British born and one an American by birth, were\r\nknown to have deserted from the British sloop _Halifax_, lying in\r\nHampton roads, and to have taken service on an American frigate, the\r\n_Chesapeake_. After application for their surrender had been made in\r\nvain to the magistrates of the town of Norfolk, where the _Chesapeake's_\r\nrendezvous was, and to the officer commanding the rendezvous,\r\nVice-admiral Berkeley sent his flagship, the _Leopard_, carrying fifty\r\nguns, with an order to the British captains on the North American\r\nstation to search the _Chesapeake_ for deserters from six ships named,\r\nincluding the _Halifax_, in case she should be encountered on the high\r\nseas. The _Leopard_ arrived in Chesapeake bay in time to follow the\r\n_Chesapeake_ beyond American waters, and then made a demand to search\r\nfor deserters. On the captain of the _Chesapeake_ refusing compliance,\r\nthe _Leopard_ opened fire. The _Chesapeake_ was not in a condition to\r\nmake any effectual reply, and, after receiving three broadsides, struck\r\nher flag. Only one of the deserters from the _Halifax_, an Englishman,\r\nwas found on the _Chesapeake_; but three deserters from the British\r\nwarship _Melampus_, which had not been named in Berkeley's order, all\r\nAmericans by birth, were removed from the _Chesapeake_, which was now\r\npermitted to return to port.[55] Although the British government offered\r\nreparation for this action, recalled Berkeley, and disavowed the right\r\nto search ships of war for deserters, the incident could not fail to\r\nmake a bad impression on American opinion.\r\n\r\nBut still Jefferson adhered to a policy of pacific coercion. In\r\nDecember, 1807, the act of April, 1806, was again put into force, and an\r\nembargo act, passed by the American congress, now cut off all foreign\r\ncountries from trade with the United States. But the policy of embargo\r\nwas disastrous to its promoters. It ruined the commerce and emptied the\r\ntreasury of the United States. On March 1, 1809, a non-intercourse act,\r\napplying only to France, Great Britain, and their dependencies, was\r\nsubstituted for the embargo act.[56] The new act enabled the president\r\nto remove the embargo against whichever country should cancel its orders\r\nor decrees against American trade. Three days later Jefferson was\r\nsucceeded by Madison as President of the United States. The change made\r\nno difference to the policy of the United States government. But the\r\nopposition was now much stronger and more violent than formerly; so much\r\nso that Sir James Craig, the Canadian governor, actually despatched a\r\nspy, John Henry, to sound the willingness of New England, where the\r\nfederalist party was the stronger, to secede from the union and join\r\nGreat Britain against the United States. This venture becomes the less\r\nsurprising when we observe that in the previous year, 1808, John Quincy\r\nAdams, the future president, had predicted such a secession. Nothing,\r\nhowever, came of the attempt. Madison attempted to obtain concessions\r\nfrom the British government, but while the Perceval ministry lasted he\r\nmet with no success. In May, 1810, the non-intercourse act expired, but\r\na proviso was enacted that, if before March 3, 1811, either Great\r\nBritain or France should cancel her decrees against American trade the\r\nact should, three months after such revocation, revive against the power\r\nthat maintained its decrees. Madison was cajoled into believing that\r\nNapoleon had recalled his decrees on November 1, 1810, and the\r\nnon-intercourse act was accordingly revived against Great Britain and\r\nher dependencies in February, 1811.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES._]\r\n\r\nAlmost the first act of the Liverpool administration was to cancel the\r\nrestrictions on American trade. But it was too late. Five days earlier\r\nthe United States had declared war against Great Britain on June 18,\r\n1812. The explanation of this step must be sought in the party politics\r\nof the United States. While the federalists courted British alliance,\r\nthe younger members of the republican party had conceived a hope of\r\nconquering Canada as a result of a victorious war against Great Britain.\r\nThis was the reply of the national party in the United States to the\r\naction of the Canadian governor. Madison knew the impracticability of\r\nsuch a step, but, finding that he could only carry the presidential\r\nelection of 1812 with the support of this section of his party, he\r\ndeclared war. Great Britain, with her best troops in the Peninsula, was\r\nin no condition to use her full strength in America, but the United\r\nStates were entirely unprepared for war. Their treasury was still empty,\r\nand their army and navy were small, while Canada generally was contented\r\nand loyal to the British crown. Upper Canada was full of loyalists, who\r\nhad been expelled from the revolted colonies, and who with their\r\ndescendants hated the men that had driven them from their homes; lower\r\nCanada was half-French and had nothing in common with the United States,\r\nwhile the Roman catholic clergy threw the whole weight of their\r\ninfluence on the British side. General Hull, who commanded the forces\r\nemployed against Canada, succeeded in crossing the river Detroit in July\r\nand threatened the British post of Malden. But an alliance with the\r\nIndians enabled the British first to possess themselves of Mackinac, at\r\nthe junction of lakes Huron and Michigan, and afterwards to imperil\r\nHull's communications through the Michigan territory.\r\n\r\nHull accordingly fell back on Detroit. The British, with 750 men under\r\nMajor-General Brock, together with 600 Indians, now prepared to attack\r\nHull at that place. Hull, who believed his retreat to be cut off by the\r\nIndians, did not await the British attack, but surrendered on August 16\r\nwith 2,500 men and thirty-three guns. The effect of the capitulation was\r\nto place the British in effectual possession, not merely of Detroit, but\r\nof the territory of Michigan, and thus to render any attack on Canada\r\nfrom that quarter extremely difficult. The advantages gained by the\r\nBritish through this success were unfortunately neutralised by the\r\npolicy pursued by Sir George Prevost, who had succeeded Craig as\r\ngovernor of Canada. Prevost was of opinion that, when the news of the\r\nwithdrawal of the orders in council reached Washington, the United\r\nStates government would be ready to abandon hostilities; and he\r\naccordingly concluded a provisional armistice with General Dearborn, the\r\ncommander-in-chief of the enemy's forces in the northern states. But\r\nPresident Madison, having engaged in war, was anxious to try the effect\r\nof another attack on Canada before negotiating for peace, and therefore\r\ndeclined to ratify the armistice. The interval enabled the United States\r\nto bring up reinforcements, but their new army failed in an attack on a\r\nBritish post on the Maumee river.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a second attempt was made to invade Upper Canada, this time\r\nfrom the side of Niagara. On October 13, Brigadier-General Wadsworth,\r\nacting under the orders of General Van Rensselaer, led an attack on the\r\nBritish position of Queenstown on the Canadian bank of the Niagara\r\nriver. Brock commanded the defence, but was killed early in the fight.\r\nThe position was momentarily seized by the enemy, but was presently\r\nrecaptured by the British, who had in the meantime been reinforced by\r\nMajor-General Sheaffe, the son of a loyalist, with a force from Fort\r\nGeorge, and before the day closed Wadsworth found himself compelled to\r\nsurrender with 900 men. The remainder of the enemy's forces, consisting\r\nof militia, rather than exceed their military obligations by crossing\r\nthe frontier, chose to leave these men to their fate. In spite of the\r\nignominious surrenders with which the first two expeditions against\r\nCanada had terminated, a third attempt was made by Brigadier-General\r\nSmyth to force the Canadian frontier; but on November 28 he was repulsed\r\nwith loss by the British under Bishopp between Chippewa and Fort Erie,\r\nabove the Niagara Falls, and at the end of the year the Canadian\r\nfrontier still remained unpierced.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _AMERICAN SUCCESSES AT SEA._]\r\n\r\nThe glory of the British military successes was unfortunately obscured\r\nin large measure by American successes on the sea. The maritime war\r\nresolved itself into a series of fights between individual frigates.\r\nThis was the necessary result of the nature of the British force kept in\r\nAmerican waters. Ever since the renewal of hostilities with France in\r\n1803 a species of blockade had been maintained along the coast of the\r\nUnited States by British vessels on the watch for deserters or\r\ncontraband of war. It was also found necessary to employ ships of war\r\nto guard against pirates in the West Indies and to protect British\r\ncommerce in that quarter against French privateers. For all these\r\npurposes speed was of more importance than strength, and the British\r\nforce in the west contained a disproportionate number of smaller vessels\r\nas compared with line of battle ships. The actual numbers of British\r\nwarships in North American waters at the beginning of 1812 were three\r\nships of the line, twenty-one cruisers and frigates, and fifty-three\r\nsmall craft. The United States navy was still weaker, and amounted\r\nmerely to seven efficient frigates and nine small craft.[57] There was\r\nno question of a contest between fleets, and though the numbers of the\r\nBritish warships enabled them to destroy American trade, they were ship\r\nfor ship inferior to the American frigates, which were thus enabled to\r\nwin an empty glory in single-ship encounters. The American frigates\r\nwere, in fact, superior in every respect to the British ships which\r\nnominally belonged to the same class. They were larger and more strongly\r\nbuilt, a frigate being as strong as a British seventy-four. Their crews\r\nwere more numerous, and were recruited entirely from seamen, about\r\none-third of whom would appear to have been of British nationality,\r\nwhile, as has been seen, many of them had been decoyed from British\r\nwar-vessels by offers of higher pay. The British ships on the other hand\r\nwere manned largely by landsmen, often impressed from the jails. A false\r\neconomy had induced the British admiralty to impose narrow limits on the\r\nuse of ammunition for gunnery practice. The Americans on the other hand\r\nwere very liberal in this respect, with the result that in the early\r\nyears of the war they were greatly superior to their enemies in point of\r\nmarksmanship.\r\n\r\nA good example of the disproportion between the British and American\r\nfrigates is furnished by the fight between the British frigate\r\n_Guerrière_ and the American frigate _Constitution_, on August 19, one\r\nof the first naval actions in the war. The _Guerrière_ was armed with\r\ntwenty-four broadside guns, discharging projectiles with a total weight\r\nof 517 pounds; the _Constitution_ with twenty-eight broadside guns,\r\ndischarging a weight of 768 pounds. The crew of the _Guerrière_,\r\ncounting men only, numbered 244, that of the _Constitution_ with a\r\nsimilar limitation 460. Finally the _Guerrière's_ tonnage amounted to\r\n1,092, as against the _Constitution's_ 1,533. The _Guerrière's_ guns\r\nproved very ineffectual from the start, while the marksmanship, not only\r\nof the American gunners but of the riflemen in the _Constitution's_\r\ntops, was the wonder of the British. It is stated that none of her shot\r\nfell short. After a fight lasting nearly two hours the _Guerrière_\r\nsurrendered. The ship was a complete wreck, and she had lost fifteen men\r\nkilled and six mortally wounded as against seven killed and three\r\nmortally wounded on board her opponent.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the engagement both on British and on American public\r\nopinion was altogether out of proportion to its intrinsic importance.\r\nThe inequality in strength of the opposing frigates was not understood,\r\nand any defeat of the mistress of the seas seemed an event of\r\nconsiderable significance. The Americans soon met with other similar\r\nsuccesses. On October 18 their sloop _Wasp_, of eighteen guns, reduced\r\nthe British sloop _Frolic_, a weaker vessel, though of similar armament,\r\nto a helpless hulk after a ten minutes' cannonade. The moral effect of\r\nthis victory was not impaired by the fact that the conqueror and her\r\nprize were compelled to surrender a few hours later to the British\r\nseventy-four _Poictiers_. On the 25th the _United States_, of forty-four\r\nguns, captured the _Macedonian_, of thirty-eight, after three hours'\r\nfighting, and on December 29 the British thirty-eight-gun frigate\r\n_Java_, with a very inexperienced crew, was captured by the\r\n_Constitution_ after a running fight of three hours and a half.[58]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE GERMAN CAMPAIGN OF 1813._]\r\n\r\nWith the retreat of the French army from Russia the main scene of\r\noperations on the continent was shifted from Russia to Germany. Great\r\nBritain took little part in the actual warfare in Germany, and if she\r\nhad a larger share in the political negotiations which ultimately\r\ndetermined the distribution of forces, still Austria and not Great\r\nBritain was the power whose diplomacy had most effect on the course of\r\nevents. The upheaval of Europe against Napoleon, however, would have\r\nbeen much less effective if it had not been supported by English\r\nsubsidies, and Austria, in the crippled state of her finances, would\r\nprobably have had to remain inactive if she had not been able to rely on\r\nEnglish gold and perhaps still more on English credit.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1813 falls naturally into three parts. During the first,\r\nfrom the beginning of January to the latter part of April the victorious\r\nRussians swept over North Germany, and, carrying the Prussian monarchy\r\nwith them, strengthened a reaction which had already begun against the\r\nrule of Napoleon. The second part began with the arrival of Napoleon on\r\nthe scene of action towards the end of April and lasted to the\r\nconclusion of an armistice on June 4. In this period of seven or eight\r\nweeks the allies were forced to retire at all points and the war was\r\ncarried into Prussian territory. The armistice, which terminated on\r\nAugust 10, preceded the opening of the third part of the campaign in\r\nwhich Russia and Prussia were joined by Austria and Sweden, and, after\r\ngradually drawing closer round the main French position in Saxony,\r\nfinally inflicted a crushing defeat upon Napoleon at Leipzig in the\r\nmiddle of October. The campaign was virtually over when Napoleon secured\r\nhis retreat by the victory of Hanau on October 30; but it is impossible\r\nto sever it from the events outside Germany which were directly\r\noccasioned by the downfall of Napoleon's German domination. These are\r\nthe revolt of Holland in November, that of Switzerland in December, and\r\nthe Austrian attack on Northern Italy in October and November.\r\n\r\nIn the opening months of the campaign the movements were merely a sequel\r\nto those of the previous year. The French retreat was continued from the\r\nNiemen to the Vistula, the Elbe, and finally the Saale. The Russians\r\nentered Prussia proper a few days after Yorck's capitulation, and the\r\nFrench retired before them. Stein, the Prussian statesman who had\r\nreceived a commission from Russia to administer the Prussian districts\r\noccupied by her, ordered the provincial governor to convoke an assembly.\r\nAlthough some indignation was felt at such a step being taken by Russian\r\norders, the assembly met and voted the formation of the Landwehr. In\r\nthis way Prussia actually began to arm against France, while the\r\nPrussian government still professed to maintain the French alliance. A\r\nfew days later King Frederick William left Berlin, which was still\r\noccupied by the French, for Breslau. Before the end of February he had\r\nconcluded the treaty of Kalisch with Russia, by which the two powers\r\nwere to conduct the war against France conjointly, and Russia was not to\r\nlay down her arms till Prussia should be restored to a strength equal to\r\nthat which she had possessed in 1806. On March 2 Cathcart arrived at\r\nKalisch as British ambassador to the Russian court. He actively promoted\r\nRussia's alliance with Prussia, from which Great Britain stood apart for\r\nthe present. He was able to obtain from Prussia a renunciation of her\r\nclaims on Hanover, but Frederick William was still opposed to any\r\nincrease of Hanoverian territory. On the 17th Prussia declared war on\r\nFrance. By that time the Russians had entered both Berlin and Breslau,\r\nand had freed Hamburg from French dominion, thus reopening Germany to\r\nBritish commerce. The declaration of war by Prussia was accompanied by a\r\nconvention with Russia providing for the deliverance of Germany and the\r\ndissolution of the confederation of the Rhine. This convention embodied\r\nStein's policy. It relied on popular support and it aimed at an unified\r\ngovernment, at least in the territories occupied at that date by\r\nadherents of France.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE GERMAN CAMPAIGN OF 1813._]\r\n\r\nBut the popular upheaval in Germany was confined to the kingdom of\r\nPrussia, and the attempt to spread it elsewhere only provoked distrust\r\nin Austria and the South German states; it was not until the\r\nconservative elements in Germany were won over by Metternich's policy\r\nthat the anti-Napoleonic movement became truly national. For the present\r\nAustria played the part of mediator. Lord Walpole, who had been sent on\r\na secret errand to Vienna in December, 1812, tried in vain to win\r\nAustria to the side of the allies by promising the restoration of the\r\nTyrol, Illyria, and Venetia.[59] Her government would probably have\r\npreferred a reconciliation with France, which would have arrested the\r\ngrowth of Russia and left Germany divided, to a unified Germany such as\r\nStein desired; but Metternich, who directed her policy, cherished little\r\nhope of the success of his endeavours, though he knew when to employ\r\nagents more optimistic than himself. The Austrian treasury was empty,\r\nand it therefore suited Austria to remain neutral as long as possible,\r\nwhile in the event of a doubtful struggle this very neutrality would\r\nraise the price of her ultimate alliance. It was in this way that she\r\ncame at last to exercise a decisive voice in the resettlement of\r\nGermany, not to say of Europe. True to this policy, the Austrian court\r\nconcluded a truce of indefinite duration with Russia at the beginning of\r\nthe year, and withdrew its forces within its own borders. This was\r\nfollowed by an offer of mediation made to France, which was, however,\r\ndeclined. A renewed offer was declined early in April by both France and\r\nGreat Britain. The British still distrusted Austria, while France\r\ndesired to buy her active co-operation and made an offer of Silesia in\r\nreturn for an army of 100,000, should Prussia or Russia open\r\nhostilities. Austria did not, however, abandon her project, but notified\r\nPrussia and Russia that she would proceed with the task of armed\r\nmediation, and steadily busied herself with military preparations.\r\n\r\nThe vigour of the Prussians in recruiting had surprised Napoleon, but\r\nhis own vigour was the marvel of Europe. In spite of the losses of the\r\nRussian campaign, he was able to take the field at the end of April with\r\nan army which at the lowest estimate was 200,000 strong. But his\r\nsoldiers were for the most part mere boys, and he was sadly deficient in\r\ncavalry. The veterans of Austerlitz, of Jena, of Friedland, and of\r\nWagram had been recklessly sacrificed on the plains of Russia. He was\r\nvictorious at Lützen on May 2, was joined by the King of Saxony, entered\r\nDresden, and thence pushed across the Elbe. On the 21st the victory of\r\nBautzen enabled him to advance to the Oder and occupy Breslau. A renewed\r\noffer of Austrian mediation drew from him a declaration in favour of an\r\narmistice and a diplomatic congress. On June 4 an armistice was actually\r\nconcluded at Poischwitz to last until August 1, and a neutral zone was\r\nprovided to separate the combatants. On June 7 the demands of Austria\r\nwere presented to Napoleon. They involved the renunciation by France of\r\nall territorial possessions, and even of a protectorate in Germany, and\r\nthe restoration to Prussia and Austria of most of their lost provinces.\r\nNapoleon refused these terms, but accepted the mediation of Austria, and\r\narranged for a congress which met at Prague in the middle of July. The\r\narmistice was prolonged till August 10. Both France and Austria were\r\nmerely striving to gain time while they prepared for war, and there can\r\nbe no doubt that the allies profited most by the delay. During the\r\ninterval the news arrived of Wellington's great victory at Vitoria on\r\nJune 21, and Napoleon, recalled to Mainz, occupied himself in arranging\r\nplans for the defence of the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nDuring the armistice Prussia and Russia not only greatly reinforced\r\ntheir troops, but received valuable assistance from Great Britain,\r\nSweden, and above all Austria. Already, on March 3, Great Britain had by\r\nthe treaty of Stockholm given her sanction to the seizure of the whole\r\nof Norway by Sweden, after a vain attempt to induce Denmark to consent\r\nto a peaceable cession of the diocese of Trondhjem. At the same time\r\nGreat Britain promised Guadeloupe as a personal gift to Bernadotte, and\r\na subsidy of £1,000,000 for the Swedish troops fighting against\r\nNapoleon. A new treaty between Russia and Sweden on April 22 guaranteed\r\nthe cession of Norway. On June 14 and 15 Cathcart, having at last\r\nobtained Prussia's consent to an increase in the territories of Hanover,\r\nsigned treaties at Reichenbach with Prussia and Russia, by which Great\r\nBritain undertook to pay a subsidy of two-thirds of a million pounds to\r\nthe former and a million and a third to the latter power. It was also\r\nagreed to issue federative paper notes to an extent not exceeding\r\n£5,000,000 to pay the expenses of the armies of the two powers during\r\nthe year 1813, and Great Britain undertook the responsibility for\r\none-half of these notes. Soon afterwards Austria received a promise of a\r\nloan of £500,000 as soon as she should join the allies. Half of this\r\nlast sum was actually paid within a few days of the resumption of\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _DRESDEN AND LEIPZIG._]\r\n\r\nWhen the armistice expired, French forces were threatening Austria from\r\nthree sides--from Bavaria, Illyria, and Saxony; and Napoleon's intention\r\nseems to have been to amuse the Austrian court with negotiations until\r\nhe could defeat the Prussian and Russian armies, after which he counted\r\nupon overwhelming the Austrians with his entire force. The task of\r\ndefeating the Prussians was entrusted to his army in Saxony with which\r\nDavoût was expected to co-operate from Hamburg, retaken by the French on\r\nMay 30. Austria, however, declared war on France the moment the\r\narmistice had elapsed, August 12, and the main army of the allies,\r\nprincipally composed of Austrians with large Prussian and Russian\r\ncontingents, assembled in Bohemia. Napoleon was opposed in Silesia by an\r\narmy of Prussians and Russians, while Bernadotte, in command of a mixed\r\narmy, consisting mainly of Swedes, Prussians and Russians, but including\r\n3,000 British troops and 25,000 Hanoverians under Walmoden, operated\r\nagainst him from the north. These three armies were eventually able to\r\njoin hands, while Davoût's army, the French armies in Italy and Illyria,\r\nand 170,000 French troops in various German fortresses were unable to\r\nrender effective aid in the struggle. On August 26-27 Napoleon himself\r\nwon the last of his great victories at Dresden over the main army of the\r\nallies, while his lieutenants were defeated by the northern army at\r\nGrossbeeren on August 23, and again at Dennewitz on September 6, and by\r\nthe Silesian army at the Katzbach on August 26. The capitulation of\r\nVandamme at Kulm, with some 10,000 men, neutralised Napoleon's victory\r\nat Dresden, and his enemies were increased by Austrian diplomacy. The\r\ntreaty of Teplitz, concluded on September 9, and accepted by Great\r\nBritain on October 3, committed the allies to the complete independence\r\nof the several German states. On the 10th Bavaria renounced the French\r\nalliance, and on October 8, by the treaty of Ried, she engaged to join\r\nthe allies with 36,000 men, in return for a promise that she should\r\nsuffer no diminution of territory. On the 7th the northern and Silesian\r\narmies had united west of the Elbe; Napoleon, who had quitted Dresden on\r\nthe 6th and vainly attempted to engage the separate northern army,\r\narrived at Leipzig on the 14th. But it was now too late.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th the allied armies, which had concentrated on Leipzig,\r\ncompelled him to stand at bay, and to risk all upon the fortunes of a\r\nsingle battle. This battle, lasting three days, was not only one of the\r\ngreatest but one of the most decisive recorded in modern history, for it\r\nfinally crippled the warlike power of Napoleon, and inevitably\r\ndetermined the issue of the campaigns yet to be fought in 1814 and 1815.\r\nIt would appear that Napoleon had under his command about 250,000 men,\r\nand that he lost at least 50,000 in killed and wounded on the field. The\r\nallied forces were much larger numerically, and their losses fully\r\nequalled those of the French. But their victory was crushing. One of its\r\nimmediate results was that Napoleon was forced to abandon Saxony, and\r\nwith it the French cause in Germany. The French garrisons were reduced\r\none by one. Of the fortresses east of the Rhine, Hamburg, Kehl,\r\nMagdeburg, and Wesel alone held out until the conclusion of peace in\r\n1814. The general rising of Central Europe against French domination\r\nwhich followed the battle of Leipzig extended itself to Holland. The\r\nFrench were expelled in the middle of November, and on December 2 the\r\nPrince of Orange was proclaimed sovereign prince of the Netherlands. On\r\nthe 29th the Swiss diet voted the restoration of the old constitution.\r\nThe confederation of the Rhine was practically dissolved, but in Italy\r\nNapoleon's viceroy, Eugène Beauharnais, after falling back before the\r\nAustrian army, was able to hold the line of the Adige. On November 9 it\r\nwas decided to offer peace to Napoleon on condition of the surrender of\r\nall French conquests beyond the Rhine, the Alps, and the Pyrenees. These\r\nterms represented the policy of Metternich. The Earl of Aberdeen\r\nconsented to them on behalf of Great Britain and Nesselrode on behalf of\r\nRussia, but they were not accepted by Napoleon before the date by which\r\nan answer was required, and the war proceeded. On December 31 the\r\nPrussians under Blücher crossed the Rhine near Coblenz and opened a new\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _AMERICAN SUCCESSES._]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the war on the American continent was carried on with varying\r\nsuccess, though the balance of fortune was rather on the side of the\r\nUnited States. The operations were in the main of a desultory character,\r\nno permanent conquests being made. The first engagement in the year 1813\r\nwas at Frenchtown on the Raisin River in Michigan, where Colonel\r\nProctor, commanding 500 regulars and militia, and 600 Indians, defeated\r\nan American force of 1,000 under Brigadier-General Winchester, and took\r\n500 prisoners, while many of the remaining Americans fell into the hands\r\nof the Indians. The immediate effect of this victory was that General\r\nHarrison, who was leading an American force of 2,000 men against\r\nDetroit, determined to retrace his steps. Three months later Proctor\r\nmade a descent upon an American position on the Maumee River in the\r\nnorth of the State of Ohio. After besieging the enemy for a few days he\r\nwas compelled to retire, but, before he left, an engagement took place\r\non May 5, in which the British forces, with a total loss of less than\r\n100, inflicted severe losses on their opponents and made about 500\r\nprisoners. A subsequent attempt to capture Fort Sandusky, near the head\r\nof Lake Erie, was repulsed on August 2; ninety out of 350 British troops\r\nwere returned as killed, wounded or missing.\r\n\r\nThe British had hitherto commanded the lakes, but Commodore Perry now\r\noccupied himself in building a fleet at Presqu'isle in Pennsylvania on\r\nthe coast of Lake Erie. Commander Barclay, in command of such ships as\r\nthe British possessed, was badly supported and encountered the same\r\ndifficulties in obtaining seamen as had been experienced for the\r\nsea-going ships. The ships in the service of the United States were in\r\nconsequence again the more powerful and the better manned. On September\r\n10 the two squadrons engaged. The British had six vessels with a\r\nbroadside of 459 lb., while the enemy had nine vessels with a broadside\r\nof 928 lb. With such odds the result could not be doubtful, and the\r\nwhole British squadron was compelled to surrender. This success enabled\r\nthe enemy to strike with effect at the south-western end of Lower\r\nCanada. The British immediately evacuated the whole territory of\r\nMichigan with the exception of Mackinac; and Proctor, now raised to the\r\nrank of major-general, commenced a retreat in the direction of Lake\r\nOntario. On October 5 he was attacked at Moraviantown on the Thames by\r\nHarrison, and the greater part of his forces were captured in an\r\nengagement which reflected small credit on British generalship. The\r\nremainder of his forces reached Burlington Heights, at the west end of\r\nLake Ontario, but the whole country to the west of the Grand River had\r\nto be abandoned to the enemy.\r\n\r\nOn Lake Ontario the fortune of war was more equally divided. The\r\nAmericans had been gradually collecting a naval squadron at Sackett's\r\nHarbour and had gained command of the lake as early as November, 1812.\r\nThe command was, however, precarious, since it might be disturbed by the\r\narrival or construction of new warships. One such was building at York,\r\nnow known as Toronto, the capital of Upper Canada, when, on April 27,\r\n1813, the American squadron under Commodore Chauncey attacked the town\r\nand succeeded in landing a detachment of troops under General Dearborn.\r\nThe British general, Sheaffe, withdrew his regular forces from the town\r\nwithout awaiting an assault, but not before he had destroyed the ship of\r\nwhich the enemy were in quest. The Americans captured some naval stores,\r\nbut did not attempt to hold the town; they set an evil precedent,\r\nhowever, by burning the parliament house and other public buildings\r\nbefore evacuating the place. On May 27 Chauncey co-operated again with\r\nDearborn in an attack on Fort George, the capture of which threw the\r\nwhole line of the Niagara into American hands. On the same day Prevost,\r\nwhose naval strength had been reinforced, availing himself of Chauncey's\r\nabsence, made an attack on Sackett's Harbour. The attack, which was\r\nrenewed on the 29th, was miserably conducted, and ended in failure,\r\nthough the Americans were compelled to burn the naval stores captured at\r\nYork. The reinforcements had, however, transferred to the British the\r\ncommand of the lake, which was not challenged again till the end of\r\nJuly. Meanwhile their land forces were not idle. On June 6 the Americans\r\nwere surprised by Colonel Vincent at Burlington Heights and over 100\r\nprisoners, including two brigadier-generals, were taken. This defeat,\r\ncombined with the approach of the British naval squadron under Sir James\r\nYeo, induced Dearborn to abandon his other posts on the Canadian side of\r\nthe Niagara and to concentrate at Fort George, but on the 24th another\r\nsurprise ended in the surrender of a detachment of more than 500\r\nAmericans to a force of fifty British troops and 240 Indians. By the end\r\nof July Chauncey's squadron was once more strong enough to put to sea.\r\nIt raided York on the 31st, but did not venture to join battle with Yeo;\r\nthough a skirmish on August 10 enabled Yeo to capture two schooners.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile on the frontier of Lower Canada the British were everywhere\r\nsuccessful. On June 3 two American sloops attacked the British garrison\r\nof Isle-aux-noix at the north end of Lake Champlain. Both ships were\r\ncompelled to surrender. On August 1 a British force raided Plattsburg\r\nand destroyed the barracks and military stores. A combined movement on\r\nMontreal was now made by the forces of the United States; it was mainly\r\nowing to the loyalty of the French Canadians that they were repulsed.\r\nGeneral Hampton advancing from the south with a force 7,000 strong was\r\ndefeated at the river Chateauguay on October 26, by 900 men belonging to\r\nthe Canadian militia, commanded by Colonel McDonnell and Colonel de\r\nSalaberry. The defeated general withdrew his troops into winter quarters\r\nat Plattsburg. Not long after, on December 7, the American general\r\nWilkinson who had sailed down the St. Lawrence to Prescott and was\r\nmarching towards Cornwall, was defeated with heavy loss by Colonel\r\nMorrison at Chrystler's Farm, and made no further attempt on Canada. In\r\nthe same month General McClure, who commanded at Fort George, retired to\r\nthe eastern bank of the Niagara before Colonel Murray's advance. His\r\nretreat was disgraced by the burning of the town of Newark, where women\r\nand children were turned homeless into the cold of a Canadian winter. At\r\nthe same time the American forces were withdrawn from south-western\r\nCanada but still retained Amherstburg at the head of Lake Erie, the sole\r\nconquest of the campaign.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _NAVAL WARFARE._]\r\n\r\nThe naval warfare of 1813 was less rich in individual encounters than\r\nthat of 1812. The British captains were better acquainted with the\r\nstrength of the American ships and did not rashly engage vessels\r\nstronger than their own. There was also a marked improvement in British\r\ngunnery, and an increase in the strength of the British naval force in\r\nAmerican waters. At first the blockade of the American coast had not\r\nbeen strictly maintained further south than New York, but as\r\nreinforcements arrived it was made more complete, and after June of this\r\nyear it was only occasionally that any warship or privateer contrived to\r\nelude the blockading vessels. Meanwhile the British constantly raided\r\nand harassed the American coast, and had no difficulty in availing\r\nthemselves of the Chesapeake and Delaware estuaries as naval bases. A\r\nnew feature of this year's warfare was the appearance of American\r\ncruisers, especially privateers, in British waters, and even in the St.\r\nGeorge's Channel. To such ships the French ports were a very serviceable\r\nnaval base. The Americans would appear to have captured more of British\r\ncommerce than the British captured of theirs, but this was no\r\ncompensation for the almost complete cessation of their foreign trade.\r\nOf single ship actions the destruction of the British _Peacock_ by the\r\nAmerican _Hornet_, commanded by Captain Lawrence, on February 24, the\r\ncapture of the American _Argus_ by the British _Pelican_ not far from\r\nthe Welsh coast on August 14, and the famous duel between the\r\n_Chesapeake_ and the _Shannon_ on June 1 were the most important.\r\n\r\nThe British frigate _Shannon_ (38) was commanded by Captain Broke, who\r\nwas famous not merely for the attention he paid to gun practice, but for\r\nthe care he had bestowed on the laying of his ship's ordnance. Ever\r\nsince the beginning of April the frigates _Shannon_ and _Tenedos_ (38)\r\nhad been lying off Boston, where they hoped to intercept any American\r\nfrigate that dared to leave the harbour. Two succeeded in eluding them.\r\nThe _Chesapeake_ frigate (36) commanded by Lawrence, lay in the harbour;\r\nand Broke, having detached the _Tenedos_ in order to tempt her out, sent\r\na challenge to Lawrence on the morning of June 1, but before it could be\r\ndelivered the _Chesapeake_ had sailed. She steered for the _Shannon_,\r\nwho waited for her. The fight began at 5.50 P.M. about six leagues out\r\nfrom Boston; it was brief and bloody. After ten minutes' firing the\r\n_Chesapeake_ fell on board the _Shannon_, and was immediately boarded.\r\nIn four minutes more every man on board had surrendered. In this short\r\nfight the _Shannon_ had lost out of a crew of 352 twenty-four killed and\r\nfifty-nine wounded, two of the latter mortally, while the _Chesapeake_,\r\naccording to American official figures, had lost out of 386 forty-seven\r\nkilled and ninety-nine wounded (fourteen of the latter mortally). No\r\nfewer than thirty-two British deserters were found on board the\r\n_Chesapeake_. The victory made the best possible impression. The two\r\nships had been of approximately equal strength, the American having a\r\nslight superiority of force, and the _Chesapeake_ had been captured in\r\nthe way in which most turns on individual courage, by boarding. Both\r\ncaptains had distinguished themselves in the fight, and both were\r\nseverely wounded, Lawrence, as the event proved, fatally.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _CAMPAIGN IN FRANCE._]\r\n\r\nThe abandonment of Germany by the French at the close of 1813 left the\r\noutlying provinces and allies of France exposed to invasion. The\r\nAustrian general, Nugent, aided by British naval and military forces,\r\ncaptured Trieste on October 31. Dalmatia had been invaded by the\r\nMontenegrins as early as September, 1813, and was afterwards attacked by\r\nAustrians and British marines, but the town of Cattaro held out till it\r\nwas taken by the British in January, 1814. On the 14th of the same\r\nmonth Denmark was compelled by the treaty of Kiel to cede Norway to\r\nSweden in exchange for Swedish Pomerania and Rügen, Sweden undertaking\r\nto assist Denmark in procuring a fuller equivalent for Norway at the\r\nconclusion of a general peace. A treaty signed between Denmark and Great\r\nBritain at the same time and place provided for the restitution to\r\nDenmark of all British conquests, with the exception of Heligoland,\r\nwhile Denmark undertook to do all in her power for the abolition of the\r\nslave trade. The people of Norway and their governor, Prince Christian\r\nof Denmark, refused to submit to the transference of their allegiance,\r\nand on February 19 the independence of Norway was proclaimed. At first\r\nthe Swedish government attempted to obtain the submission of Norway by\r\nnegotiation only, but so important a diversion of her interest and\r\nenergies was sufficient to prevent Sweden from joining in the new\r\ncampaign against France. In Italy on January 11 Napoleon's\r\nbrother-in-law, Murat, whom he had made King of Naples in 1808, formed\r\nan alliance with Austria. The treaty was never confirmed by Great\r\nBritain, but the British government subsequently consented to support\r\nMurat, if he should loyally exert himself in Italy against Napoleon's\r\nforces. Although Murat did actually engage in hostilities against the\r\nFrench, the British were far from satisfied with his operations and\r\nconsidered that his remissness left them a free hand. Accordingly on\r\nMarch 9 a British fleet entered the port of Leghorn and landed 8,000\r\nmen, of whom Lord William Bentinck took command. From Leghorn he marched\r\nupon Genoa which surrendered to him on April 18.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the main forces of the allies were concentrated for a campaign\r\nagainst Napoleon in Champagne. Of the three armies which had combined at\r\nLeipzig the Austro-Russian army under Schwarzenberg made its way through\r\nSwitzerland, Alsace, and Franche-Comté, while Blücher's army of\r\nPrussians and Russians passed through the region which afterwards became\r\nthe Rhine province and Lorraine. The two armies united in the\r\nneighbourhood of Brienne in Champagne. Bernadotte's army did not as a\r\nwhole take part in the campaign; but a portion of it, consisting of\r\nRussians under Wittgenstein and Prussians under Bülow, was engaged in\r\nthe conquest of Belgium and was able to invade France itself later in\r\nthe year. Schwarzenberg's army was accompanied by the Emperors of\r\nRussia and Austria, the King of Prussia, and the leading European\r\ndiplomatists, including Castlereagh. From the outset there was a marked\r\ndifference between the Austrian and Russian policies. Metternich was\r\ncontent with reducing France to the natural frontiers already offered to\r\nher, and aimed merely at compelling Napoleon to recognise the _fait\r\naccompli_ in Germany, and to evacuate Italy and Spain. He was therefore\r\nin favour of slow advances and of giving Napoleon every opportunity for\r\ncoming to terms. The tsar, on the other hand, wished to reduce France to\r\nher ancient limits, and was anxious to enter Paris as a conqueror. He\r\nalso excited Austrian jealousy by his scheme of annexing what had been\r\nPrussian Poland, and compensating Prussia with Saxony. Castlereagh and\r\nthe Prussian minister, Hardenberg, supported the tsar's policy towards\r\nFrance, but without sharing his ardour.\r\n\r\nOn the first arrival of the allies in Champagne the tsar had only\r\ninduced Metternich to advance by threatening to prosecute the war alone.\r\nAfter they had gained what appeared to be a decisive victory over\r\nNapoleon at La Rothière on February 1, negotiations were commenced at\r\nChâtillon. Napoleon insisted on continuing the war during the\r\nnegotiations and interposed every possible delay. The allies first\r\ndemanded that France should recede within the limits of 1791 and offered\r\na partial restoration of French colonies, but refused to specify the\r\ncolonies which they were willing to relinquish until France should\r\naccept the first condition. To this the French demurred, and on the 9th\r\nthe tsar impetuously withdrew his minister. From the 10th to the 14th\r\nNapoleon inflicted a series of crushing blows upon Blücher's army.\r\nNegotiations were now resumed; they lasted till the middle of March, but\r\nas Napoleon would not surrender his claim to Belgium and the Rhine\r\nprovinces they were fruitless, notwithstanding the pacific efforts of\r\nCaulaincourt, the French negotiator. On the 21st Napoleon tried in vain\r\nto detach Austria from the allies by a private letter to the Emperor\r\nFrancis, and on March 1 a permanent basis was given to the alliance by\r\nthe treaty of Chaumont (definitely signed on the 9th), by which the four\r\nallied powers bound themselves to conclude no separate peace, and not to\r\nlay down their arms till the object of the war should have been obtained\r\nby the restriction of France to her ancient frontiers. Each power was\r\nto maintain 150,000 men regularly in the field, and Great Britain was to\r\npay the three other powers a subsidy of £5,000,000 for the current year\r\nand a like sum for every subsequent year of warfare. The signatory\r\npowers were to maintain their present concert and armaments for twenty\r\nyears if necessary.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _NAPOLEON'S FIRST ABDICATION._]\r\n\r\nAfter this treaty on March 4 Blücher united with Wittgenstein and Bülow\r\nnear Soissons. On the 20th Napoleon was repulsed by Schwarzenberg's army\r\nat Arcis-sur-Aube, after which he attempted to cut off its\r\ncommunications by a movement to its rear. In consequence of this\r\nmovement the allied armies advanced on Paris, while the Austrian emperor\r\nfled to Dijon taking Castlereagh and Metternich with him.[60] This left\r\nthe war to be concluded under the influence of the most vigorous of the\r\nallied sovereigns, the Tsar of Russia. Paris capitulated on the 30th and\r\non the next day was occupied by the allies. The tsar now issued \"on\r\nbehalf of all the allied powers\" a proclamation in which he declared\r\nthat they would not treat with Napoleon or his family, but were willing\r\nto respect the integrity of France, and to guarantee the constitution\r\nthat the French people should adopt. This prepared the way for a\r\nreaction against Napoleon in France. A provisional government was formed\r\non April 1; on the 3rd the French senate proclaimed the deposition of\r\nNapoleon, and on the 6th it published a constitution, and recalled the\r\nBourbons in the person of Louis XVIII., the younger brother of Louis\r\nXVI. On the same day Napoleon signed an unconditional abdication at\r\nFontainebleau. On the 11th a treaty was signed between Napoleon and the\r\nsovereigns of Austria, Prussia, and Russia, by which he renounced all\r\nclaim to the crowns of France and Italy, and was assigned the Isle of\r\nElba as an independent principality and a place of residence, together\r\nwith a liberal revenue charged on the French treasury, which, however,\r\nwas never paid. The duchy of Parma was secured to the Empress Maria\r\nLouisa and was to descend to her son. The treaty was afterwards\r\nconfirmed by Great Britain, with the exception of the clauses providing\r\nrevenues for the fallen emperor and his family. The promise of Elba had\r\nbeen made by the tsar in the absence of Castlereagh and Metternich. It\r\nwas vigorously opposed by Castlereagh's half-brother, Sir Charles\r\nStewart, but the tsar considered his honour bound to it, and Napoleon\r\nsailed from Fréjus for Elba on the 28th.\r\n\r\nIn America the war was conducted with more vigour in 1814 than in\r\nprevious years, but with equally small effect on either side. In March\r\nthe American general, Wilkinson, advancing from Lake Champlain, was\r\nrepulsed by a small British garrison at La Colle Mill. In July an\r\nAmerican army under Brown invaded Upper Canada across the river Niagara.\r\nIt was attacked by General Riall, near Chippewa, on the 5th, but it\r\nrepelled the attack and occupied that place. Brown was, however, checked\r\nby British regulars and Canadian militia under Sir Gordon Drummond at\r\nLundy's Lane, near Niagara Falls, on the 25th. Both sides claim the\r\nvictory, but on the reinforcement of the British troops Brown abandoned\r\nthe invasion. After the close of the Peninsular war some of the best\r\nregiments of the Peninsular army, numbering about 14,000 men, were sent\r\nto America. But they were not commanded by any of the generals who had\r\nmade their names illustrious in that war, and did not effect so much as\r\nhad been expected. On August 19 and 20 General Ross landed with 5,000\r\nmen at the mouth of the Patuxent in Chesapeake Bay. On the 24th he\r\ndefeated a large body of militia under General Winder at Bladensburg,\r\nand occupied Washington, where he burned all the public buildings.\r\nHowever deplorable such an act may seem, it is well to note that it was\r\na fair and even merciful reprisal after the action of the Americans at\r\nYork and Newark. Ross did not attempt to retain the city, but evacuated\r\nit on the next day and re-embarked on the 30th. On September 12 he\r\nlanded near Baltimore, but was immediately killed in an attack on the\r\ntown. The attack had to be abandoned because it proved impossible to\r\nobtain adequate support from the fleet, and the troops returned to the\r\nships on the 15th.\r\n\r\nOn September 1 Prevost invaded New York State by Lake Champlain. He\r\nadvanced against Plattsburg, which he bombarded on the 11th, but his\r\nflotilla was defeated by an American flotilla during the bombardment,\r\nand he felt himself compelled to retreat into Canada. At the end of the\r\nyear Sir Edward Pakenham took command of a force operating against New\r\nOrleans, but on January 8, 1815, he was defeated and killed by the\r\nAmerican forces under the future president, Andrew Jackson. No\r\nexpedition was ever worse planned than this; the veterans of the\r\nPeninsula were mowed down by a withering fire, and, losing confidence in\r\ntheir leaders, forfeited their reputation for invincible courage in\r\nattack. The fighting, however, was desperate while it lasted, and was\r\ncompared by one engaged in it with the storm of Badajoz, and the deadly\r\ncharges at Waterloo. It was but a small compensation for these failures\r\nthat the British were able to annex a strip of territory belonging to\r\nthe State of Maine. On the sea no general engagement took place, nor was\r\nthere any naval duel so famous as that between the _Shannon_ and the\r\n_Chesapeake_ in the previous year. The Americans lost two of their best\r\nfrigates, but, with crews largely composed of British sailors, captured\r\nseveral British ships of war.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE TREATY OF GHENT._]\r\n\r\nAs early as January, 1814, advances had been made towards negotiations\r\nfor peace, but they were not actually begun till August 6. In the course\r\nof a few days a serious difficulty arose, as the British commissioners\r\ndemanded the delimitation of an Indian territory which should be exempt\r\nfrom territorial acquisitions on the part of either power, and also\r\nclaimed the military occupation of the lakes for their own government.\r\nThe Americans thereupon suspended the negotiations, and Castlereagh\r\nexpressed grave discontent with the conduct of the British negotiators\r\nin pressing these points. Late in the year negotiations were resumed,\r\nwhen the British abandoned these claims. The far more comprehensive\r\nquestions about the rights of neutrals, which had occasioned the war,\r\nhad ceased to be of practical importance now that peace was restored in\r\nEurope. They were therefore, by tacit consent, suffered to drop, and a\r\ntreaty signed at Ghent on December 24, 1814, ended a war of which the\r\nCanadians alone had reason to be proud.\r\n\r\nThe most dramatic incident in the domestic annals of England in this\r\nyear was the visit of the allied sovereigns to this country, after their\r\ntriumphal entry into Paris, and the signature of a convention, to be\r\ndescribed hereafter, for the resettlement of Europe. Louis XVIII. left\r\nhis retreat at Hartwell on April 20, and reached his capital on May 3\r\nto find it occupied by foreign armies, and to discover that his French\r\nescort, composed of Napoleon's old guard, was of doubtful loyalty. On\r\nJuly 8 the Tsar of Russia and the King of Prussia, having accepted an\r\ninvitation from the prince regent, which the Emperor of Austria\r\ndeclined, landed at Dover, and were afterwards received with the utmost\r\nenthusiasm in London. Their appearance betokened the supposed\r\ntermination of the greatest, and almost the longest, war recorded in\r\nEuropean history, but it was also accepted as a tribute of gratitude for\r\nthe unique services rendered by Great Britain, the only European power\r\nwhich had never bowed the knee to the French Republic or the French\r\nEmpire. They attended Ascot races, were feasted at the Guildhall,\r\nwitnessed a naval review at Portsmouth, and were decorated with honorary\r\ndegrees at Oxford, where Blücher was the hero of the day with the\r\nyounger members of the university. There were men of calmer minds and\r\nmaturer age, who must have remembered the time, but seven years before,\r\nwhen Alexander swore eternal friendship with Napoleon, on the basis of\r\nenmity to Great Britain, and Frederick William of Prussia shrunk from no\r\ndepths of dishonour, first to aggrandise his kingdom and then to save\r\nthe remnants of it from destruction. Others foresaw that a restoration\r\nof the Bourbons portended reaction, in its worst sense, throughout all\r\nthe continent of Europe. But such memories and forebodings were hushed\r\nin the sincere and general rejoicing over the return of peace, marred by\r\nno suspicion of the new trials and privations which peace itself was\r\ndestined to bring with it for the working classes of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[53] See p. 105.\r\n\r\n[54] George, _Napoleon's Invasion of Russia_, p. 33.\r\n\r\n[55] James, _British Naval History_, iv., 470-84.\r\n\r\n[56] See above, p. 58.\r\n\r\n[57] See _Cambridge Modern History_, vii., 336, 338.\r\n\r\n[58] For details of the naval warfare of this year see James, _British\r\nNaval History_, vi., 115-202.\r\n\r\n[59] Rose, _Life of Napoleon I._, ii., 372.\r\n\r\n[60] For the importance of this flight of the Emperor Francis see Rose,\r\n_Life of Napoleon I._, ii., 418, 425.

The treaty amounted to a settlement in outline of those\r\nterritorial questions in Europe in which France was concerned, and aimed\r\nmainly at the construction of a strong barrier to resist further\r\nencroachments by France on her neighbours. The French boundaries were to\r\ncoincide generally with the limits of French territory on January 1,\r\n1792, but with certain additions. The principle adopted was that France\r\nshould retain certain detached pieces of foreign states within her own\r\nfrontier (such as Mühlhausen, Montbéliard, and the Venaissin), while the\r\nline of frontier was extended so as to include certain detached\r\nfragments belonging to France before 1792, such as Landau, Mariembourg,\r\nand Philippeville, as well as Western Savoy with Chambéry for its\r\ncapital. She was moreover allowed to regain all her colonies except the\r\nMauritius, St. Lucia, and Tobago. The Spanish portion of San Domingo was\r\nrestored to the Spanish government. Holland was placed under the\r\nsovereignty of the house of Orange, and was to receive an increase of\r\nterritory; so much of Italy as was not to be ceded to Austria was to\r\nconsist of independent sovereign states; and Germany was to be formed\r\ninto a confederation. Finally an European congress was to meet at Vienna\r\nin two months' time \"to regulate the arrangements necessary for\r\ncompleting the dispositions of the treaty\". At the same time secret\r\narticles provided that the disposition of territories was to be\r\ncontrolled at Vienna by Austria, Great Britain, Prussia, and Russia;\r\nthat Austria, was to receive Venice and Lombardy as far as the Ticino;\r\nand that the former territories of Genoa were to be annexed to\r\nSardinia, and the late Austrian Netherlands to Holland.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the general restoration of legitimate princes\r\ndifficulties were occasioned by the exceptional cases in which\r\nterritories were reserved for the new dynasties that had arisen during\r\nthe Napoleonic wars. France, Spain, and Sicily objected to the retention\r\nof the kingdom of Naples by Murat, Spain resented the cession of Parma\r\nto the Bonapartes, and Norway was in revolt against the attempt to\r\nsubjugate it to the king of Sweden and his heir Marshal Bernadotte. The\r\nNorwegian government under Prince Christian vainly endeavoured to secure\r\nthe British recognition of the independence of Norway. The British\r\ngovernment, on the contrary, held itself bound to support the claims of\r\nSweden, and on April 29 notified a blockade of the Norwegian ports,\r\nwhich was promptly carried into effect. Meanwhile a new constitution was\r\npromulgated in Norway, and Prince Christian was proclaimed king. While\r\nthe British maintained the blockade Sweden attempted to gain its ends by\r\nnegotiation. At last, on July 30, the Swedes invaded Norway. After some\r\nSwedish successes a convention was signed at Moss on August 14, which\r\nrecognised the new Norwegian constitution, but provided for a personal\r\nunion of the crowns of Sweden and Norway. This constitution was accepted\r\nby Charles XIII. of Sweden in the following November, and Norway\r\nretained almost complete independence, though united to Sweden.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE SLAVE TRADE._]\r\n\r\nAmong the last acts of Napoleon's government had been the release and\r\nrestoration of Ferdinand VII. of Spain and of Pope Pius VII. Ferdinand,\r\nsupported by the vast mass of Spanish opinion, declared against the\r\nrather unpractical constitution established in his absence, and entered\r\nMadrid as an absolute king on May 14. One of his first acts was the\r\nrevival of the inquisition. There was some apprehension among British\r\nrepresentatives lest the two restored Bourbon monarchies should renew\r\nthe family compact, and also lest they should attempt to assert the\r\nBourbon claims to Naples and Parma. Sir Henry Wellesley, afterwards Lord\r\nCowley, was, however, successful in negotiating a treaty of alliance\r\nbetween Great Britain and Spain, which made provision against any\r\nrenewal of the family compact, restored the commercial relations of the\r\ntwo countries to the footing on which they had been before 1796, and\r\npromised the future consideration of means to be adopted for the\r\nsuppression of the slave trade. Spain was in fact too dependent on\r\nBritish credit to be able to adopt a line of her own in politics. But\r\nthe hold which Great Britain had thus gained over Spain was somewhat\r\nweakened by the British attitude towards the slave trade.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how large a space the abolition of the slave trade\r\noccupied in the foreign policy of Great Britain, when the liberties of\r\nEurope were at stake. During the months preceding the meeting of the\r\ncongress of Vienna, which had been postponed till September by the tsar,\r\nBritish diplomacy had been engaged in a strenuous effort to obtain the\r\nco-operation of such European powers as possessed American colonies in\r\nsecuring this philanthropic object. Sweden had already consented to it,\r\nand now Holland also gave her consent. Portugal agreed to relinquish the\r\ntrade north of the equator, on condition that the other powers consented\r\nto impose a similar restriction on themselves. Strong pressure was\r\nbrought to bear upon France to consent to the immediate abolition of the\r\ntrade, and Wellington, who had been created a duke in May and who\r\narrived at Paris in August in the capacity of British ambassador, was\r\nauthorised by Liverpool to offer the cession of Trinidad or the payment\r\nof two or three million pounds to obtain this end. By the treaty of\r\nParis only French subjects were allowed to trade in slaves with the\r\nFrench colonies, and French subjects were excluded from trading\r\nelsewhere; and the whole trade was to cease within French dominions\r\nafter five years. Talleyrand, negotiating with Wellington, refused to\r\nconsent to a general abolition, but, on being pressed to surrender the\r\nslave trade north of the equator, consented to abandon it to the north\r\nof Cape Formoso. In the following year Napoleon on his return from Elba\r\nordered its immediate suppression, and this was not the least\r\nsignificant act of the Hundred Days. With Spain our diplomatists were\r\nless successful. The British government refused to renew its subsidy to\r\nSpain for the last half of 1814 except on condition that Spain\r\nrelinquished the slave trade north of the equator at once, and consented\r\nto relinquish that south of the equator in five years' time; while it\r\nwould not issue a loan except on condition that Spain abolished the\r\nwhole trade immediately. Even these terms did not prevail with Spain,\r\nand the most that she would grant at the congress was to relinquish the\r\ntrade at the conclusion of eight years.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Talleyrand was endeavouring to induce Great Britain to combine\r\nwith France in a joint mediation between Austria and Russia at the\r\ncongress, in the event of Russia demanding the duchy of Warsaw.\r\nWellington, while expressing himself in favour of an understanding,\r\nrefused to accept anything which might seem equivalent to a declaration\r\nin favour of mediation by the two powers in every case. At the congress\r\nitself Great Britain was first represented by Castlereagh, who was\r\nsucceeded in February, 1815, by Wellington. The two principal\r\ndifficulties were the questions of Poland and Saxony. The tsar desired\r\nto erect the duchy of Warsaw, Prussia's share in the two partitions of\r\nPoland in 1793 and 1795, into a constitutional monarchy attached to the\r\nRussian crown, while Prussia, though not unwilling to resign her claims\r\nto Polish dominion, wished to increase her territory by the\r\nincorporation of Saxony in her monarchy. Austria was naturally averse\r\nfrom any increase of strength in the states on her northern borders, and\r\nshe was also opposed to the establishment of a constitutional monarchy\r\nin Poland which might serve as a centre for political discontent in her\r\nown dominions. Even France urged this objection to a constitutional\r\nPoland. Great Britain alone was willing to see an independent Poland,\r\nbut preferred to join France, Prussia, and Austria in demanding its\r\nrepartition between the two latter powers rather than its annexation to\r\nRussia. All through October Austria, Great Britain, and Prussia\r\nendeavoured to induce the tsar to withdraw his demand. Early in November\r\nhe won over the King of Prussia to whom he promised the kingdom of\r\nSaxony, proposing to indemnify the Saxon king with a new state on that\r\nlower Rhine which France was not allowed to have, but which no other\r\npower desired.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE RETURN OF NAPOLEON._]\r\n\r\nIt was no longer possible to resist Russia's claims on Poland, but\r\nAustria was determined not to allow Prussia to receive the proffered\r\ncompensation. On December 10 Metternich notified the Prussian minister,\r\nHardenberg, that he would not allow Prussia to annex more than a fifth\r\npart of Saxony. Great Britain, France, Bavaria, and the minor German\r\nstates joined Austria in this action, and thus the attempt to effect a\r\nsettlement of Europe by a concert of the four allied powers broke down.\r\nOn January 3, 1815, a secret treaty was concluded between Austria,\r\nFrance, and Great Britain in defence of what their diplomatists called\r\n\"the principles of the peace of Paris\". Each of these powers was to be\r\nprepared, if necessary, to place an army of 50,000 men in the field.\r\nBavaria joined them in their preparations for war, and many of the\r\ntroops which occupied Paris in 1815 would have been disbanded or\r\ndispersed, but for the prospect of a rupture between the allies\r\nthemselves. But a compromise was soon arranged, and on February 8 it was\r\nagreed that Cracow, the Polish fortress which threatened Austria most,\r\nshould be an independent republic, and that Prussia should retain enough\r\nof Western Poland to round off her dominions, while the remainder of the\r\nduchy of Warsaw became a constitutional kingdom under the tsar. Prussia\r\nwas to be allowed to annex part of Saxony, and was to receive a further\r\ncompensation on the left bank of the Rhine and in Westphalia. The most\r\nthorny questions were now settled, and Castlereagh had left Vienna when\r\nthe congress was electrified by the news that Napoleon had reappeared in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe episode of \"the Hundred Days\" interrupted, but did not break up, the\r\ncouncils of the congress at Vienna. It cannot be said that Napoleon's\r\nescape from Elba took the negotiators altogether by surprise. They were\r\nalready aware of his correspondence with the neighbouring shores of\r\nItaly, and his removal to St Helena or some other distant island had\r\nbeen proposed by the French government, though never discussed at the\r\ncongress. Sir Neil Campbell, the British commissioner at Elba, had gone\r\nso far as to warn his government of Napoleon's suspected \"plan,\" and to\r\nindicate, though erroneously, the place of his probable descent upon the\r\nItalian coast. Owing to an almost incredible want of precaution, he\r\nembarked on February 26 with the least possible disguise, and\r\naccompanied by 400 of his guards, on board his brig the _Inconstant_,\r\neluded the observation of two French ships, and landed near Cannes on\r\nMarch 1. Thence he hastened across the mountains to Grenoble, passing\r\nunmolested, and sometimes welcomed, through districts where his life had\r\nbeen threatened but a few months before. The commandant of Grenoble was\r\nprepared to resist his further progress, but a heart-stirring appeal\r\nfrom Napoleon induced a regiment detached to oppose him to join his\r\nstandard, and the rest of the garrison was brought over by Colonel\r\nLabedoyère, one of the officers who had conspired to bring him back.\r\nThence he proceeded to Lyons, issuing decrees, scattering proclamations,\r\nand gathering followers at every stage. He was lavish of promises, not\r\nperhaps wholly insincere, that he would adopt constitutional\r\ngovernment--already established by the charter of Louis XVIII.--and\r\ncease to wage aggressive wars. He relied unduly on the discontent\r\nprovoked by the blind partisans of the Bourbons, who, it was said, had\r\nlearned nothing and forgotten nothing. This was true, if the spirit of\r\nthe restoration were to be measured by the parade of expiatory masses\r\nfor the execution of royalists under the revolution, the ostentatious\r\npatronage of priests, the preference of returned _émigrés_ to well-tried\r\nservants of the republic and the empire, or the anticipated expulsion of\r\nlandowners in possession of \"national domains\" for the purpose of\r\ndividing them among their old proprietors. All this naturally\r\nexasperated those who had imbibed the principles of the revolution, but\r\nit was more than compensated in the eyes of millions of Frenchmen by the\r\ncessation of conscription and the infinite blessings of peace.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _\"THE HUNDRED DAYS.\"_]\r\n\r\nThe king was amongst the least infatuated of the royalists. On hearing\r\nof Napoleon's proclamation, he had the sense to appreciate the danger of\r\nsuch a bid for sovereignty and the magic of such a name, while his\r\ncourtiers regarded Napoleon's enterprise as the last effort of a madman.\r\nHe addressed the chamber of deputies in confident and dignified\r\nlanguage; the Duke of Angoulême was employed to rouse the royalist party\r\nat Bordeaux; the Duke of Bourbon was sent into Brittany, the Count of\r\nArtois, with the Duke of Orléans and Marshal Macdonald, visited Lyons,\r\nupon the attitude of which everything, for the moment, seemed to depend.\r\nMost of the marshals remained faithful to the restored monarchy, and Ney\r\nwas selected to bar the progress of Napoleon in Burgundy, and has been\r\ncredited with a vow that he would bring him back in an iron cage. But it\r\nwas all in vain. The Count of Artois was loyally received by the\r\nofficials and upper classes at Lyons, but he soon found that Napoleon\r\npossessed the hearts of the soldiers and the mass of the people. Ney\r\nyielded to urgent appeals from his old chief, signed and read to his\r\ntroops a proclamation drawn up by Napoleon himself, and was followed in\r\nhis treason by his whole army. As Napoleon approached Paris, all armed\r\nopposition to him melted away. On March 19, Louis XVIII., seeing that\r\nhis cause was hopeless, proclaimed a dissolution of the chambers, and\r\nretired once more into exile, fixing his residence at Ghent.\r\n\r\nNapoleon re-entered the Tuileries on the 20th, after a journey which he\r\nafterwards described as the happiest in his life. But his penetrating\r\nmind was not deceived by the manifestations of popular joy. He well knew\r\nthat he was distrusted by the middle classes, as well as by the\r\naristocracy, and threw himself more and more on the sympathy of the old\r\nrevolutionists. When he came to fill up the higher offices, he met with\r\na strange reluctance to accept them, and was driven to enlist the\r\nservices of two regicides, the virtuous republican, Carnot, and the\r\ndouble-dyed traitor Fouché. Feeling the necessity of resting his power\r\non a democratic basis, he promulgated a constitution modelled on the\r\ncharter of Louis XVIII., and known as the _Acte Additionnel_, which,\r\nhowever, satisfied no one. The royalists objected to its anti-feudal\r\nspirit, the revolutionists and moderates to its express recognition of\r\nan hereditary peerage, and its tacit recognition of a dictatorial power.\r\nIt was by no means with a light heart that Napoleon took leave of Paris\r\non June 7, having appointed a provisional government, to place himself\r\nat the head of his army.\r\n\r\nAttempts had been made in the southern provinces and La Vendée to\r\norganise armed rebellion against the emperor, and met for a time with\r\nconsiderable success. But they were soon quelled by the overwhelming\r\nimperialism not only of the regular army, but of vast numbers of\r\ndisbanded soldiers and half-pay officers, dispersed throughout France,\r\nand disgusted with their treatment under the restored monarchy. Even\r\namong the _bourgeoisie_ Napoleon had an advantage which he never\r\npossessed before. Disguise it as he might, all his former wars had been\r\nessentially wars of conquest, and, however patiently they might endure\r\nit, the peasantry of France, in thousands upon thousands of humble\r\ncottages, groaned under the exaction of crushing taxes--worst of all,\r\nthe blood-tax of conscription--in order to enable one man, in the name\r\nof France, to usurp the empire of the world. Now, however, as in the\r\nearly days of the revolution, France was put on its defence, and called\r\nupon to repel an invasion of its frontiers. For the news of Napoleon's\r\nescape, announced by Talleyrand on March 11, instantly stilled the\r\nquarrels and rebuked the jealousies which had so nearly proved fatal to\r\nany settlement at Vienna. For the moment, the designs of Russia in\r\nPoland, the selfish demands of Prussia, and the half-formed coalition\r\nbetween Great Britain, France, and Austria, were thrust into the\r\nbackground. Austria thought it necessary to repudiate decisively the\r\naudaciously false assertion of Napoleon that he was returning with the\r\nconcurrence of his father-in-law, and would shortly be supported by\r\nAustrian troops. Metternich, therefore, assumed the lead in drawing up a\r\nsolemn manifesto, dated March 13, in which Napoleon was virtually\r\ndeclared an outlaw \"abandoned to public justice,\" and the powers which\r\nhad signed the treaty of Paris in the preceding May bound themselves, in\r\nthe face of Europe, to carry out all its provisions and defend the king\r\nof France, if need be, against his own rebellious subjects.\r\n\r\nBy a further convention made at the end of March, they engaged to\r\nprovide forces exceeding 700,000 men in the aggregate, to be\r\nconcentrated on the Upper Rhine, the Lower Rhine, and the Low Countries,\r\nwith an immense reserve of Russians to be rapidly moved across Germany\r\nfrom Poland. Wellington having succeeded Castlereagh at Vienna, was\r\nappointed to command the British, Hanoverian, and Belgian contingents on\r\nthe north-east frontier of France; Blücher's headquarters were to be on\r\nthe Lower Rhine, within easy reach of that frontier; for, whichever side\r\nmight take the offensive, it was there that the first shock of war might\r\nbe expected. The recent conclusion of peace with America at Ghent on\r\nDecember 24, 1814, left England free to use her whole military power.\r\nEnormous sums were voted by Parliament, with a rare approach to\r\nunanimity, for the equipment of a British army, and a sum of £5,000,000\r\nfor subsidies to the allied powers. A small section of the opposition\r\nled by Whitbread opposed the renewal of war. On April 7 he moved an\r\namendment to the address in reply to the prince regent's message\r\nannouncing that measures for the security of Europe were being concerted\r\nwith the allies, but he was only supported by 32 votes against 220. On\r\nApril 28 his motion for an address to the prince regent, deprecating\r\nwar with Napoleon, was defeated by 273 votes against 72. This was\r\nWhitbread's last prominent appearance in parliament. On July 6, during a\r\nfit of insanity, he died by his own hand. The subsidies to the allies\r\nwere opposed by Bankes, but were carried on May 26 by 160 votes against\r\n17. There can be no doubt that the majorities in the house of commons\r\ncorrectly expressed the national sentiment. Nobody wished to dictate to\r\nFrance the form of government which she was to adopt, but it was\r\ngenerally felt that Napoleon's character rendered peace with him\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE CAMPAIGN OF 1815._]\r\n\r\nIn the end, about 80,000 men were assembled in Belgium under\r\nWellington's orders, but of these not half were British soldiers,\r\nincluding untrained drafts from the militia, who replaced veteran\r\nPeninsular regiments still detained in Canada and the United States. Yet\r\nNapoleon admitted the British contingent to be equal, man for man, to\r\nhis own troops, while he estimated these to be worth twice their own\r\nnumber of Dutchmen, Prussians, or other Germans. The first blow in the\r\nwar was struck by Murat. Already in February, dissatisfied with his\r\nambiguous position, he had levied troops and summoned Louis XVIII. to\r\ndeclare whether he was at war with him. As soon as he heard of\r\nNapoleon's return, he invaded the Papal States, and summoned the\r\nItalians to rise in the cause of Italian unity and independence. Though\r\ndisowned by Napoleon, he persevered in this plan, but he was attacked\r\nand twice defeated by an Austrian army. On May 22 the British and\r\nAustrians took the city of Naples, and Murat fled to France. In October\r\nhe made an attempt to recover his kingdom, but was captured and shot. It\r\nis noteworthy that, on hearing of his fate at St. Helena, Napoleon\r\nshowed but little sympathy with his brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of June 12, Napoleon left Paris, saying as he entered his\r\ncarriage that he went to match himself with Wellington. All his troops\r\nwere already marshalled on the Belgian frontier, and numbered 124,588\r\nmen, with 344 guns. The Imperial Guard alone was 20,954 strong, and the\r\nwhole army was largely composed of seasoned veterans. The Prussian army\r\nconsisted of 116,897 men, with 312 guns under Marshal Blücher, whose\r\nheadquarters were at Namur. Though the majority of these were veterans,\r\nthere was a considerable leaven of inferior troops, hastily raised from\r\nthe Westphalian and Rhine militia. Between this town and Quatre Bras lay\r\nthe Prussian line of defence, Sombreffe being the centre, with Ligny and\r\nSt. Amand in front of it, and rather on the south-west. Wellington's\r\nheadquarters were at Brussels, and, having no certain intelligence of\r\nNapoleon's movements, he kept the various divisions of his army within\r\neasy distance of that capital until the very eve of the final conflict.\r\nOf the 93,717 men under his command, 31,253 were British, two-thirds of\r\nwhom had never been under fire; 6,387 were of the king's German legion;\r\n15,935 Hanoverians; 29,214 (including 4,300 Nassauers in the service of\r\nthe Prince of the Netherlands) Dutch and Belgians; 6,808 Brunswickers;\r\n2,880 Nassauers; the engineers, numbering 1,240, were not classified by\r\nnationality. He fully expected that Napoleon would move upon Brussels\r\nalong the route by Mons and Hal, and maintained in later days that such\r\nwould have been the best strategical course. Napoleon thought otherwise,\r\nand resolved to strike in between the Prussian and British armies,\r\ncrushing the former before the latter could be fully assembled. He very\r\nnearly succeeded, and, if all had gone as he hoped, he could scarcely\r\nhave failed to win one of his greatest victories.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _LIGNY AND QUATRE BRAS._]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 15th, Wellington was still at Brussels, with the\r\ngreat body of his army, and only a weak force of Dutch and Belgians was\r\nat Quatre Bras, some sixteen miles to the south. Blücher, with about\r\nthree-fourths of his army, was at Sombreffe, a few miles south-east of\r\nQuatre Bras. Napoleon himself was at or close by Charleroi, ten or\r\ntwelve miles south of Quatre Bras; the mass of his army was at Fleurus,\r\nsouth-west of Sombreffe, with Ligny and St. Amand between it and the\r\nPrussians; and Marshal Ney, with Reille's corps, was at Frasnes,\r\nopposite to and due south of Quatre Bras. On the morning of the 16th,\r\nNapoleon arrived from Charleroi at Fleurus, and carefully inspected his\r\nenemy's position, but delayed his attack upon Ligny and St Amand until\r\nhalf-past two in the afternoon. The Prussians outnumbered the French,\r\nand a murderous conflict ensued among the streets, gardens, and\r\nenclosures of these little towns, which lasted until eight or nine\r\no'clock. At last Napoleon ordered his guard to advance, and the plateau\r\nbehind Ligny was taken, with a loss to the French of 12,000, and to the\r\nPrussians of over 20,000. Blücher himself was unhorsed and severely\r\nbruised in a furious charge of cavalry, but the Prussians retired in\r\ngood order towards Wavre, north of the battlefield.\r\n\r\nHad Ney been in a condition to obey an urgent message from Napoleon, and\r\nto envelop the Prussian right and rear, this defeat would have been\r\noverwhelming in its effect. But while the battle of Ligny was raging,\r\nanother battle was going on at Quatre Bras, six miles distant, in which\r\nthe French sustained a serious check. Happily for the British, Ney\r\nfailed to bring up his divisions for an attack on Quatre Bras until two\r\no'clock in the afternoon, when the Dutch and Belgians under the Prince\r\nof Orange were still his only opponents. The news for which Wellington\r\nhad been waiting did not reach him until just before the memorable ball,\r\ngiven by the Duchess of Richmond at Brussels on the night of the 15th,\r\nwhich he nevertheless attended, hurrying off his troops to Quatre Bras.\r\nThey arrived just in time to reinforce the Prince of Orange and save the\r\nposition; but Ney, too, was receiving fresh reinforcements every hour,\r\nthe Duke of Brunswick was killed, and a fearful stress fell on Picton's\r\ndivision and the Hanoverians, who alone were a match for Ney's splendid\r\ninfantry and Kellermann's cuirassiers.\r\n\r\nThese made a charge like that which had borne down the Austrians at\r\nMarengo, but the British squares were proof against it, and when a\r\ndivision of guards came up from Nivelles, the French in turn were put on\r\nthe defensive and retreated to Frasnes. The loss on the British side was\r\n4,500 men; that on the French somewhat less. It is not difficult to\r\nimagine what the issue of the battle must have been if D'Erlon's corps\r\nhad been brought into action. This corps was occupied in marching and\r\ncountermarching, under contradictory orders from Napoleon and Ney,\r\nbetween the British left and the Prussian right during the whole of this\r\neventful day. Its appearance in the distance just when Napoleon was\r\nabout to launch his guard against the Prussians at Ligny, caused him to\r\nhesitate long, and lose the decisive moment for demolishing his enemy.\r\nIts failure to appear at Quatre Bras, and to roll up the wavering\r\nDutch-Belgians, before Picton took up the fighting, enabled Wellington\r\nto hold his ground at first, to repulse Ney afterwards, and on hearing\r\nof Blücher's defeat at Ligny, to fall back in good order on Waterloo.\r\nEven then, something was due to good fortune. Had Napoleon joined Ney\r\nand marched direct on Quatre Bras early on the 17th, it is difficult to\r\nsee how his advance to Brussels could have been arrested. But whether he\r\nwas exhausted by his incessant labours since leaving Paris, or whether\r\nhis marvellous intuition was deserting him, certain it is that he\r\nallowed that critical morning to slip by without an effort--and without\r\na reconnaissance. He assumed that Blücher must retire upon Namur as his\r\nbase of operations, and that Wellington, retiring towards Brussels,\r\nwould be cut off from his allies. He therefore despatched Marshal\r\nGrouchy, with 33,000 men, to follow up the Prussians eastward by the\r\nNamur road. His assumption was unfounded. Blücher, loyal to his\r\nengagements, retired upon Wavre; Wellington, relying upon Blücher's\r\nloyalty, took his stand on the field of Waterloo; and this error on the\r\npart of Napoleon determined the fortunes of the campaign.[61]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _WATERLOO._]\r\n\r\nThe British army retreated upon Waterloo almost unmolested. Ney was\r\nprobably awaiting orders, and Napoleon, believing the Prussians to be at\r\nNamur, probably thought he might safely rest himself and his army before\r\ncrushing Wellington at his leisure. When they realised that Wellington\r\nwas deliberately moving his army to a position nearer Brussels, they\r\nboth followed in pursuit along different roads converging at Quatre\r\nBras, and a brisk skirmish took place near Genappe between Ney's cavalry\r\nand that of the British rear-guard. Heavy rain came on, and the two\r\narmies spent a miserable night, half a mile from each other, close to\r\nMont St. Jean, and south of Waterloo. Napoleon rose before daybreak on\r\nthe 18th, reconnoitred the British position, and convinced himself that\r\nWellington intended to give battle. He expressed to his staff his\r\nsatisfaction and confidence of victory, when General Foy, who had\r\nexperience of the Peninsular war, replied in significant words: \"Sire,\r\nwhen the British infantry stand at bay, they are the very devil\r\nhimself\". Why Napoleon did not begin the battle at eight o'clock has\r\nbeen the subject of much discussion. It is said that he waited for\r\nGrouchy to join him before the close of the action. But neither he nor\r\nGrouchy, though aware that at least a large force of Prussians had gone\r\nto Wavre and not to Namur, suspected that Blücher had promised\r\nWellington to march with his whole army on the morning of the 18th to\r\nsupport the British at Waterloo. It is more likely that he waited for\r\nhis men to assemble and for the ground to dry and become more\r\npracticable for his powerful artillery.[62]\r\n\r\nException has been taken to the conduct of Wellington in detaching\r\n17,000 men to guard the approach to Brussels at Hal, and, still more, in\r\nnot recalling them, when he must have ascertained that nothing was to be\r\nfeared on that side, and when such a reinforcement of his right wing\r\nmust have been all-important. But it must be remembered that in this\r\nforce there were only 1,500 English troops, and 2,000 Hanoverian\r\nmilitia. The rest were Dutch and Belgians. At all events, Napoleon left\r\nhis right flank undefended, though he was already somewhat anxious about\r\nthe Prussian movements, and Wellington fought the battle of Waterloo\r\nwith a force numerically inferior to that under Napoleon's command,\r\nthough it might have been rendered superior by the accession of the Hal\r\ncontingent. The effective part of this force, numbering in all 67,661\r\nmen, consisted of 24,000 British soldiers, 6,000 soldiers of the king's\r\nGerman legion, and about 11,000 Hanoverians. Napoleon's force numbered\r\n72,000 men, and it was stronger both in cavalry and in guns. It\r\nrepresented the flower of the French army; there were few, if any,\r\nrecruits as raw as those who swelled the ranks of the British regiments;\r\nthere were thousands upon thousands who had formed part of that _Grande\r\nArmée_ which had overawed the continent of Europe. It is fair, however,\r\nto record that, while the British rank and file suffered much for want\r\nof sufficient food, the French had fared still worse, and that very many\r\nof them could have been in no fit condition for the struggle impending\r\nover them.\r\n\r\nBoth armies occupied ground extending from west to east, on opposite\r\nridges, and crossed at right angles by the great highway running north\r\nand south from Charleroi to Brussels. In front of the British right were\r\nthe château and enclosures of Hougoumont which were occupied by the\r\nBritish; nearly in front of the centre were the large farm-house and\r\nbuildings of La Haye Sainte. Further to the left were the hamlet of\r\nSmohain and the farms Papelotte and La Haye. Wellington had arranged his\r\nbrigades so as to distribute the older troops as much as possible among\r\nthe less experienced. Sir Thomas Picton's fifth division formed the left\r\nof the line; to his right was Alten's second division, and beyond him to\r\nthe right was the guards division under Cooke. Further to the right and\r\npartly in reserve was Clinton's second division, while Chassé's Dutch\r\ndivision on the extreme right occupied the village of Braine l'Alleud.\r\nSomerset's brigade of heavy cavalry and Kruse's Dutch cavalry were\r\nposted behind Alten's division, and Ponsonby's \"union brigade,\"\r\nconsisting of the royal dragoons, Scots greys, and Inniskillings, was\r\nstationed in Picton's rear. The whole line lay on the inner slopes of\r\nthe ridge with the exception of Bylandt's Dutch-Belgian brigade which\r\nwas posted on the outer slope in front of Picton's division. D'Erlon's\r\ncorps was opposite the British left, Reille's opposite the British\r\nright. Squadrons of cavalry covered the outer flank of either of the two\r\nFrench corps. The magnificent squadrons of French cavalry, 15,000\r\nstrong, under Milhaud, Kellermann, and other famous leaders, were in the\r\nsecond line; the imperial guard, as usual, was massed in the rear.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _WATERLOO._]\r\n\r\nThe battle opened about half-past eleven with a furious attack on\r\nHougoumont. It was defended with desperate gallantry, mainly by the\r\nBritish guards, who reopened the old loopholes in the garden-walls, and\r\nclosed by sheer muscular force the eastern gate of the yard, which had\r\nbeen forced open by the French. In the fruitless siege of Hougoumont, as\r\nit may be called, the French left wing thus wasted most of its strength,\r\nand incurred enormous loss. Meanwhile, the French right wing under\r\nD'Erlon, advanced to attack the British left, which had been assailed\r\nfor an hour and a half by the fire of a battery with seventy-eight guns.\r\nThe Dutch and Belgians, who in their exposed position had suffered\r\nseverely from the French artillery fire, soon gave way; but Picton's\r\ndivision, after a single volley, charged with the bayonet and drove\r\ntheir assailants reeling backward, though Picton himself fell dead on\r\nthe field. Without orders from Wellington, Lord Uxbridge, in command of\r\nthe British cavalry, seized the opportunity, and launched the union\r\nbrigade with other regiments upon the flying masses. This whirlwind of\r\nBritish horsemen swept all before it, slaughtering many of the French\r\ncavalry in passing, taking 3,000 prisoners, sabring the gunners of Ney's\r\nbattery, and spiking fifteen of the guns. But their ardour carried them\r\ntoo far. By Napoleon's orders a large force of French cuirassiers and\r\nlancers fell upon their flank before they could take breath again, and\r\ntheir ranks were frightfully thinned in a disorderly retreat. But their\r\ncharge had saved the day.\r\n\r\nAt one o'clock, while the fate of D'Erlon's onslaught was still\r\nundecided, Napoleon observed Prussian troops on his right. An\r\nintercepted despatch proved these to be Bülow's corps. He instantly sent\r\noff a despatch to Grouchy, whom he supposed to be within reach, ordering\r\nhim to attack Bülow in the rear. Then followed the memorable succession\r\nof charges by the whole of the French cavalry upon the squares of the\r\nBritish infantry. Not one of these squares was broken; a great part of\r\nthe French cavalry was mown down by volleys or cut to pieces by the\r\nBritish cavalry in their precipitate retreat, and the British line\r\nremained unmoved, though grievously weakened, behind its protecting\r\nridge. This was the crisis of the fight. Much of the British artillery\r\nwas dismounted, and Wellington confessed to one of his staff that he\r\nlonged for the advent of night or Blücher. Napoleon next felt himself\r\ncompelled to detach Lobau's corps for the purpose of meeting the\r\nadvancing Prussians. Soon afterwards Ney carried La Haye Sainte by a\r\nmost determined assault, aided by the failure of ammunition within its\r\ndefences, and thus captured the key of the British position. But\r\nNapoleon saw that his one chance of victory lay in a final _coup_ before\r\nthe Prussians could wrest it from him. He ordered the imperial guard to\r\nthe front, leading it himself across the valley, and then handing over\r\nthe command to Ney. The guard was but the remnant of its original\r\nstrength, for all its cavalry had been wrecked in wild charges against\r\nthe British squares, and several battalions of its infantry were kept in\r\nreserve to hold back the Prussians and protect the baggage train.\r\nNevertheless, the advance of this superb corps, the heroes of a hundred\r\nfights, who had seldom failed to hurl back the tide of battle at the\r\nmost perilous junctures, was among the most impressive spectacles in the\r\nannals of war. They swerved a little to the left, thereby exposing\r\nthemselves to the fire of the British footguards and of a battery in\r\nexcellent condition. The former were lying down for shelter, but when\r\nthe imperial guard came within sixty paces of them they started up at\r\nthe word of command from Wellington himself. The footguards poured a\r\ndeadly fire into the front, and the 52nd regiment into the flank of\r\ntheir columns; as they wavered under the storm of shot a bayonet charge\r\nfollowed, and the imperial guard, hitherto almost invincible, was\r\ndissolved into a mob of fugitives scattered over the plain.\r\n\r\nIt was now past eight o'clock; Bülow's Prussians had long been engaged\r\non the British left, and Blücher, with indomitable energy, was pressing\r\nforward with all his other divisions. Wellington first sent Vandeleur's\r\nand Vivian's cavalry, still comparatively fresh, to sweep away what\r\nremained of the French reserves, and then ordered a general advance. The\r\nFrench retreat speedily became a rout, and a rout to which there is no\r\nparallel except that which succeeded the battle of Leipzig. Wellington\r\nand Blücher met at La Belle Alliance on the high road, just south of the\r\nbattlefield, and lately the French headquarters. The British troops were\r\nutterly tired out, but the Prussian cavalry never drew rein until they\r\nhad driven the last Frenchman over the river Sambre in their relentless\r\npursuit. The slaughter had been prodigious, though far short of that at\r\nBorodino. The British army lost 13,000 men, the Prussian 7,000, and the\r\nFrench 37,000[63] (including prisoners), besides the whole of their\r\nartillery, ammunition, baggage-waggons, and military train. But the\r\nbattle was one of the most decisive recorded in history, and was the\r\nreal beginning of a peace which lasted over the whole of Europe for\r\nnearly forty years. Grouchy heard the cannonade of Waterloo on his march\r\nfrom Ligny to Wavre, and was strongly urged by Gérard to hasten across\r\ncountry, with his whole force, in the direction of the firing. But he\r\npleaded the letter of Napoleon's instructions, and reached Wavre only to\r\nfind Blücher gone. After an encounter with a Prussian corps, which had\r\nbeen left behind, he received news of Napoleon's defeat, and ultimately\r\nescaped into France.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _NAPOLEON'S SECOND ABDICATION._]\r\n\r\nThe march of the allies into France after the battle of Waterloo was not\r\nwholly unchecked, but it was far more rapid than in 1814. The French\r\ncould not be rallied, and in the first week of July Paris was occupied\r\nby Anglo-Prussian troops. The Austrians and Prussians were moving again\r\nupon the eastern frontiers of France, but were still far behind. The\r\nPrussian general and soldiers were animated by the bitterest spirit of\r\nvengeance, and it needed all the firmness of Wellington to prevent the\r\nbridge of Jena from being blown up, and a ruinous contribution levied on\r\nthe citizens of Paris. Napoleon himself was now at Rochefort, having\r\nquitted Paris after a second abdication on June 22, but four days after\r\nthe battle. No other course was open to him. When he started for his\r\nlast campaign, he was no longer the champion of an united nation, and\r\nconsciously staked his all on a single throw. When he returned from it,\r\ndiscomfited and without an army, he found the chambers actively hostile\r\nto him. Carnot, who had formerly opposed his assumption of the imperial\r\ntitle, was now the only one of his ministers to deprecate his\r\nabdication, but Napoleon himself saw no hope of retaining his power, or\r\ntransmitting it to his son, without a reckless appeal to revolutionary\r\npassions. From this he shrank, and he represented himself at St. Helena\r\nas having sacrificed personal ambition to patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe chamber of deputies appointed an executive commission of five,\r\nincluding the infamous Fouché, and from this body the late emperor\r\nactually received an order to quit Paris. He retired to Malmaison, where\r\nhe received a fresh order to set out for Rochefort, which he reached on\r\nJuly 3. On the next day Paris capitulated to the allies, and the\r\nnecessity for his leaving the shores of France became more urgent. Two\r\nfrigates were assigned for his escape to America, but a British squadron\r\nwas lying ready to intercept them. Some of his bolder companions devised\r\na scheme for smuggling him on board a swift merchant ship, but it was\r\nfoiled by the vigilant watch of the British squadron off the islands of\r\nOléron and Ré. At last he surrendered himself on board the\r\n_Bellerophon_, relying, as he said, on the honour of the British nation,\r\nand claiming the generous protection of the prince regent. He was,\r\nhowever, clearly informed that he would be at the disposal of the\r\ngovernment. Under an agreement with the allied powers, the ministers\r\ndecided, and were supported by the nation in deciding, that he could not\r\nbe detained in England, either as a guest or as a prisoner, with any\r\nregard to public safety or the verdict of Europe at Vienna. The proposal\r\nof banishing him to St. Helena, suggested in the previous year, was\r\nfinally adopted, and he sailed thither in the _Northumberland_ on August\r\n8, vehemently protesting against the bad faith of Great Britain. Louis\r\nXVIII. was restored, and the treaty of Vienna, signed on the eve of the\r\nWaterloo campaign, was but slightly modified.\r\n\r\nThe action of Murat had solved the difficulties which the congress had\r\nto face in Italy. The kingdom of the Two Sicilies reverted to the\r\nBourbon, Ferdinand; and the Bourbons also acquired a right of reversion\r\nin Parma, where the protest of Spain against the rule of Maria Louisa\r\ncould now be ignored. Genoa was annexed to the kingdom of Sardinia; the\r\npope received back the states of the Church; the Grand Duke of Tuscany\r\nand the Duke of Modena were restored; while Austria had to be content\r\nwith Venetia and Lombardy as far as the Ticino. The organisation of\r\nGermany occupied the congress until June, and was the least durable part\r\nof its work. The basis of it was a confederation of thirty-eight states,\r\nrepresented and in theory controlled by a diet under the presidency of\r\nAustria. This diet naturally resolved itself into a mere permanent\r\ncongress of diplomatists for the purpose of settling the mutual\r\nrelations of the constituent states. Each state was ordered to adopt a\r\nconstitutional form of government, but, as no provision was made for\r\nenforcing this clause, it remained a dead letter. Prussia regained her\r\nprovinces on the left bank of the Rhine, with a population exceeding\r\n1,000,000, and was allotted the northern part of Saxony, with a\r\npopulation of 800,000, besides retaining her original share of Poland,\r\nwith the province of Posen, which had formed part of the duchy of\r\nWarsaw. Most of this duchy was annexed by Russia, but Cracow was left a\r\nrepublic. Prussia also gained Swedish Pomerania. Bavaria, Hanover, and\r\nDenmark profited more or less by the repartition of Germany. Denmark,\r\nhowever, finally lost Norway, and Sweden paid the price of this\r\nacquisition by resigning Finland to Russia. The neutrality of\r\nSwitzerland was proclaimed and her constitution simplified. The Belgian\r\nNetherlands were united to Holland, the two forming together the kingdom\r\nof the Netherlands, to which Austria ceded all her claims in the Low\r\nCountries.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE SECOND TREATY OF PARIS._]\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Vienna left the boundaries of France itself as they had\r\nbeen defined by the first treaty of Paris in 1814. The second treaty of\r\nParis, however, signed on November 20, 1815, was less favourable to\r\nFrance, which had already ceded Western Savoy to Sardinia, and was now\r\nrequired to abandon Landau and other outlying territories beyond the\r\nfrontier of 1792. She was also compelled to restore all the works of art\r\naccumulated during the war.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain had failed to obtain from the congress any binding\r\nregulation on the subject of the slave trade. The most that she could\r\nobtain was a solemn denunciation of that trade issued on February 8,\r\nwhich declared it to be \"repugnant to the principles of civilisation and\r\nof universal morality\". The moderation of the British demands, as\r\nembodied in these treaties, excited not only the amazement but the\r\ncontempt of Napoleon, who discussed the subject at St. Helena with great\r\nfreedom. Well knowing that his paramount object throughout all his wars\r\nand negotiations had been to crush Great Britain, and that Great Britain\r\nhad been the mainstay of all the combinations against him, he could find\r\nno explanation of our self-denial except our insular simplicity. Perhaps\r\nit might be attributed with greater reason to politic magnanimity; nor,\r\nindeed, could Great Britain, as a member of the European council,\r\ndictate such terms as Napoleon suggested. Still, the gains of Great\r\nBritain were substantial. She retained Ceylon, the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nthe Isle of France (Mauritius), Trinidad, St. Lucia, Tobago, and, above\r\nall, Malta. She also obtained possession of Heligoland and the\r\nprotectorate of the Ionian Islands, both of which she has since resigned\r\nof her own accord. If she afterwards lost the commanding position which\r\nshe had attained among the allied powers, it was chiefly because the\r\ncolossal empire which she had defied was effectually shattered, because\r\nneither her armies nor her subsidies were any longer needed on the\r\ncontinent of Europe, and perhaps because the energies of her statesmen\r\nwere no longer braced up by the stress of a struggle for national life.\r\n\r\nEven before the allied armies entered Paris Wellington considered it\r\nnecessary to induce Louis XVIII. to make advances to certain politicians\r\nof the revolution so as to inspire national confidence in him, and to\r\nanticipate the risk of a \"White Terror,\" or a continuance of the war.\r\nFouché was accordingly summoned to power, and he had sufficient\r\ninfluence to prevent any national opposition to the Bourbon restoration.\r\nNapoleon remained at large for three weeks after his abdication, that\r\nis, for eight days after the allied troops had entered Paris, and the\r\nfear of a future Bonapartist revolution inclined the British government\r\nunder Liverpool to entertain favourably the demand of Prussia for the\r\ncession of Alsace, Lorraine, and the northern fortresses. When, however,\r\nNapoleon had placed himself on board the _Bellerophon_, the situation\r\nchanged. A contented France seemed preferable to an impotent France, and\r\nWellington argued that the Bourbon restoration could not last, if French\r\nopinion connected it with the loss of Alsace and Lorraine. The tsar took\r\nthis line from the first, and Wellington won for it the adhesion first\r\nof his own government and then of Austria. Prussia had finally to be\r\ncontented with a provision for the cession of the outlying districts,\r\nwhich the treaty of Paris of 1814 had left to France. The second treaty\r\nof Paris, which embodied this stipulation, also provided for an\r\nindemnity of £40,000,000 to be paid by France to the allies, and for the\r\ntemporary occupation of Northern France by the allied armies. On the\r\nsame day Austria, Great Britain, Prussia, and Russia signed a treaty\r\npledging themselves to act together in case fresh revolution and\r\nusurpation in France should endanger the repose of other states, and\r\nproviding for frequent meetings of congresses to preserve the peace of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the formal treaties of alliance signed at Chaumont,\r\nVienna, and Paris, an attempt was made by the Tsar Alexander to bind\r\ntogether the European sovereigns in an union based on the principles of\r\nChristian brotherhood. A form of treaty was accordingly drawn up which\r\ngave expression to these motives, dealt with all Christians as one\r\nnation, and committed their sovereigns to mutual affection and\r\nreciprocal service. This treaty of the holy alliance was signed on\r\nSeptember 26, by Austria, Prussia, and Russia. All European princes\r\nexcept the sultan were invited to adhere to it, and all except the pope\r\nand the sultan ultimately either accepted it or expressed their sympathy\r\nwith its principles. But in England there was hardly a statesman who\r\nregarded the treaty seriously, Wellington avowed his distrust of it, the\r\nprince regent declined to join it, and its effective value in promoting\r\nthe subsequent concert of the powers was less than nothing. Still,\r\nhowever visionary and extravagantly worded, it remains as an unique\r\nrecord embodying the deliberate adoption of the principle of\r\ninternational brotherhood, and the sacrifice of separate national\r\ninterests for the sake of European peace.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _NAPOLEON AT ST. HELENA._]\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that so little public discussion took place on two\r\nquestions which have since been so hotly debated--the legal _status_ of\r\nNapoleon after he surrendered himself, and the moral right of Great\r\nBritain to banish him to St. Helena. One reason for this apparent\r\nindifference to the fate of one who had overawed all Europe may be found\r\nin the fact that parliament was not sitting when the decision of the\r\ngovernment was taken, and that, when it met on February 1, 1816, that\r\ndecision was virtually irrevocable. We know, however, that the first\r\nquestion was fully considered by the allied powers and the British\r\nministry before his place of exile was fixed, and Great Britain\r\nundertook the custody of his person. The view which prevailed was that,\r\nafter his escape from Elba, he could neither be treated as an\r\nindependent sovereign nor as a subject of the French king, but must be\r\nregarded as a public enemy who had fallen into the hands of one among\r\nseveral allied powers. Accordingly, it was by their joint mandate that\r\nhe remained the prisoner of Great Britain, and was to be under the joint\r\ninspection of commissioners appointed by the other powers. Still the\r\nminds of Liverpool, Ellenborough, and Sir William Scott, judge of the\r\ncourt of admiralty, were not altogether easy on the legal aspect of the\r\ncase, which Eldon reviewed in an elaborate and exhaustive memorandum.\r\nHis conclusion was that Napoleon's position was quite exceptional, that\r\nhe could not rightly be made over to France as a French rebel, but was a\r\nprisoner of war at the disposal of the British government, both on the\r\nbroad principles of international law, and under the express terms of\r\nhis surrender, as reported officially by Captain Maitland of the\r\n_Bellerophon_.\r\n\r\nIt was thought expedient, however, to pass an act of parliament in the\r\nsession of 1816 for the purpose of setting at rest any objections which\r\nmight afterwards be raised. This measure was introduced on March 17 by\r\nLord Castlereagh, who defended it on grounds of national justice and\r\nnational policy. It met with no opposition in the house of commons, but\r\nLords Holland and Lauderdale criticised it in the house of lords, not\r\nas sanctioning a wrong to Napoleon, but as implicitly admitting the\r\nright of other powers to join in arrangements for his custody. Little\r\nattention was then bestowed by parliament or the public on the moral\r\naspect of his life-long detention at St. Helena, the restrictions to be\r\nthere imposed upon his liberty, or the provision to be made for his\r\ncomfort. Yet these subjects have ever since exercised the minds of\r\nmyriads both in England and France, and have given birth to a copious\r\nliterature for more than three generations.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[61] For the movements of June 15, 16, see Chesney, _Waterloo Lectures_,\r\npp. 70-137; Ropes, _The Campaign of Waterloo_, pp. 44-196.\r\n\r\n[62] Rose, _Life of Napoleon I._, ii., 494, 495.\r\n\r\n[63] Oman in _English Historical Review_, xix., 693, and xxi., 132.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                        THE FIRST YEARS OF PEACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament met on February 1, 1816, after a recess of unusual\r\nlength, Castlereagh was received with loud acclamations from all parts\r\nof the house as the chief actor in the pacification of Europe. There\r\nwas, of course, a full debate upon the treaties, but the opposition\r\ndwelt less upon the arbitrary partition of Europe than upon their\r\nalleged tendency to guarantee sovereigns against the assertion of\r\npopular rights and upon the manifest intention of the government to\r\n\"raise the country into a military power\". From this moment dates the\r\nwhig and radical watchword of \"Peace, Retrenchment, and Reform\". The\r\nnation was, in fact, entering upon a period of unprecedented depression\r\nand discontent, which lasted through the last four years of George\r\nIII.'s reign. At the close of 1815, however, the whole horizon was\r\napparently bright. Great Britain had saved Europe by her example, and,\r\nhowever small her army in comparison with those of continental states,\r\nshe stood foremost among the powers which had crushed the rule of\r\nNapoleon. Her national debt, it is true, had reached the prodigious\r\ntotal of £861,039,049, and the interest on it amounted £32,645,618, but\r\nthe expansion of our national resources had kept pace with it. In spite\r\nof the continental system, the orders in council, and the American war,\r\nthe imports and exports had enormously increased, chiefly by means of an\r\norganised contraband traffic; the carrying trade of the world had passed\r\ninto the hands of British shipowners; British manufactures were largely\r\nfostered by warlike expenditure at home and the suspension of many\r\nindustries abroad; while population, stimulated by a vicious poor law,\r\nwas rapidly on the increase. In this last element, then considered as a\r\nsure sign of prosperity, really consisted one of the chief national\r\ndangers.\r\n\r\nSo long as the war lasted, low as the rate of wages might be, there was\r\ngenerally employment enough in the fields or in the factories for nearly\r\nall the hands willing to labour. When the inflated war prices came to an\r\nend, and wheat fell below 80s. or even 70s. a quarter, until it reached\r\n52s. 6d. early in 1816, labourers were turned off and wages cut down\r\nstill further; bread was not proportionately cheapened, and agrarian\r\noutrages sprang up. The continent, impoverished by the war, no longer\r\nrequired British goods for military purposes, and, as its own domestic\r\nindustries revived, ceased to absorb British products, flung in\r\nprofusion on its markets. Hence came a reduction of 16 per cent. in the\r\nexport trade, and of nearly 20 per cent. in the import trade, which\r\nresulted in bankruptcies and the dismissal of workpeople. If we add to\r\nthese causes of distress, the influence of over-speculation, the\r\naccession of disbanded soldiers to the ranks of the unemployed, and the\r\nsubstitution of the factory system with machinery for domestic\r\nmanufactures with hand labour, we can partly understand why Great\r\nBritain, never harried by invading armies, should have suffered more\r\nthan France itself from popular misery and disaffection for several\r\nyears after the restoration of peace.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _VANSITTART'S FINANCE._]\r\n\r\nThe history of these years is mainly a history of social unrest, and\r\nattempts to cure social evils by legislation or coercion. Liverpool and\r\nhis colleagues, with the possible exception of Eldon, were not bigoted\r\ntories, and it is sometimes forgotten that among them, together with\r\nSidmouth, Castlereagh, and Vansittart, were Canning, Palmerston, and\r\nPeel. One of the first parliamentary struggles was on the proposal of\r\nthe government to reduce the income tax from 10 to 5 per cent., and to\r\napply this half of it, producing about £7,500,000, towards the expense\r\nof maintaining an army of 150,000 men. Since the income tax has become a\r\nfavourite of democratic economists, as pressing specially upon the rich,\r\nwe may be surprised to find that its total repeal was successfully\r\nadvocated by Henry Brougham, the leading democrat of that day--a man\r\nwhose noble services to progress and to humanity in the earlier part of\r\nhis career have been obscured by the inordinate vanity and unprincipled\r\negotism which he displayed in the later phases of his long public life.\r\nHe had entered parliament in 1810, and rapidly became the most active of\r\nthe opposition speakers. He now employed without scruple all the arts of\r\nagitation, petition-framing, and parliamentary obstruction to achieve\r\nhis object, and succeeded, by the aid of bankers and country-gentlemen,\r\nin defeating the government by a majority of thirty-seven. This vote\r\nmight be justified, more or less, on the principle laid down by Pitt,\r\nthat the income tax should be held in reserve as a war tax only, or on\r\nthe ground that it was equally wasteful and mischievous to keep up so\r\nlarge a peace-establishment, especially if it might be used to bolster\r\nup despotism abroad. It was also unfortunate that Castlereagh, ignoring\r\nthe heroic efforts made by the people of England for more than twenty\r\nyears, should have deprecated \"an ignorant impatience to be relieved\r\nfrom the pressure of taxation\". Still, it is remarkable that friends of\r\nthe people and the ultra-liberal corporation of London, as it then was,\r\nshould have concentrated their indignant protests against the financial\r\npolicy of the government, not on the corn laws, or any other indirect\r\ntax, but on the income tax.\r\n\r\nPublic confidence in the economic wisdom of the ministers was further\r\nweakened by the gratuitous abandonment of the malt tax, apparently in a\r\nfit of petulance, on the ground, explicitly stated, that, if another war\r\ntax must be raised, two or three millions more or less would make little\r\ndifference. By a temporary suspension of the sinking fund, a deficit\r\nmight be converted into a surplus; Vansittart, however, neglected to\r\ntake advantage of this simple expedient, and raised £11,500,000 by loan.\r\nHis waning reputation was almost shattered by this absurd proceeding.\r\nFinally, the excessive and irregular expenditure upon the civil list\r\nprovoked a searching inquiry into its abuses, prefaced by a scathing\r\nattack from Brougham upon the character of the prince regent. His\r\ncharacter was, in fact, indefensible, and had justly forfeited the\r\nrespect of the nation. He was a debauchee and gambler, a disobedient\r\nson, a cruel husband, a heartless father, an ungrateful and treacherous\r\nfriend, and a burden to the ministries which had to act in his name and\r\npalliate his misdoings. That of Liverpool carried a measure for the\r\nbetter regulation of the civil list, upon which, swollen as it was by\r\nthe wrongful appropriation of other public funds, many official\r\nsalaries had been charged hitherto. For these parliament now made a\r\nseparate provision. The house of commons, which properly grudged the\r\nprince regent the means of reckless luxury and self-indulgence, was\r\nunanimous in voting £60,000 for outfit and £60,000 a year to the\r\nPrincess Charlotte on her marriage, on May 2, to Prince Leopold of\r\nSaxe-Coburg, looking forward to a reign under which virtue and a sense\r\nof public duty would again be the attributes of royalty. In this\r\nsession, too, it conferred a boon upon Ireland, which earned little\r\ngratitude, by the consolidation of the British and Irish exchequers.\r\nIreland was virtually insolvent before this measure was passed. With the\r\nunion of the exchequers the union of the countries was completed. The\r\nadministration, discredited by its financial policy, was strengthened in\r\nJune by the acquisition of Canning, who succeeded Buckinghamshire as\r\npresident of the board of control. In September, 1814, Wellesley Pole, a\r\nbrother of the Marquis Wellesley and the Duke of Wellington, had been\r\nadmitted to the cabinet as master of the mint, so that with Castlereagh,\r\nVansittart, and Bragge-Bathurst, there were now five members of the\r\ncabinet in the lower house.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _INDUSTRIAL RIOTS._]\r\n\r\nThe disturbances which broke out again and again during the years\r\n1816-19 were partly the outcome of sheer destitution among the working\r\nclasses, and partly of a growing demand for reform, whether\r\nconstitutional or revolutionary. The statesmen of the regency must not\r\nbe too severely judged if they often confounded these causes of\r\nseditious movements, and failed to distinguish between the moderate and\r\nviolent sections of reformers. Those who remembered the bloodthirsty\r\norgies of the French revolution, ushered in by quixotic visions of\r\nliberty, equality, and fraternity, may perhaps be excused for\r\ndistrusting the moderate professions of demagogues who deliberately\r\ninflamed the passions of ignorant mobs. Moreover, the whigs and moderate\r\nreformers, who privately condemned the excesses of their violent\r\nfollowers, made light of these in their public utterances, and reserved\r\nall their censures for the repressive policy of the government. Bread\r\nriots had begun before the harvest, which proved a total failure. The\r\nprice of wheat, which was as low as 52s. 6d. a quarter in January, 1816,\r\nrose to 103s. 1d. in January, 1817, and to 111s. 6d. in June, 1817. And\r\nwhen rickburning set in as a consequence of agricultural depression,\r\ntumultuary processions as a consequence of enforced idleness in the coal\r\ndistricts, and a revival of Luddism as a consequence of stagnation in\r\nthe various textile industries, itself due to a glut of British goods on\r\nthe continent, the reform party, now raising its head, was held\r\nresponsible by the government for a great part of these disorders.[64]\r\nThe writings of Cobbett, especially his _Weekly Register_, certainly had\r\na wide influence in stirring up discontent against existing\r\ninstitutions, but it must be admitted that he condemned the use of\r\nphysical force, and pointed to parliamentary reform as the legitimate\r\ncure for all social evils. Reform, however, in Cobbett's meaning\r\nincluded universal suffrage with annual parliaments, and the Hampden\r\nclubs, all over the country, agitated for the same objects in less\r\nguarded language. Still, looking back at these democratic agencies by\r\nthe light of later experience, we can hardly adopt the opinion expressed\r\nby a secret committee of the house of commons that their avowed objects\r\nwere \"nothing short of a revolution\".\r\n\r\nIt was on December 2, 1816, that the extreme section of reformers, now\r\nfor the first time known as radicals, in alliance with a body of\r\nsocialists called Spenceans, first came into open collision with the\r\nforces of the law. A meeting was announced to be held on that day in Spa\r\nFields, Bermondsey, and was to be addressed by \"Orator\" Hunt, Major\r\nCartwright, the two Watsons, and other demagogues. Hunt was a gentleman\r\nof Somerset, and had stood for Bristol in 1812. Though a prominent\r\nspeaker, he in no sense directed the movement. Burdett and Cochrane, the\r\northodox leaders of London reformers, were not concerned in this\r\ndemonstration, which, according to an informer who gave evidence, was to\r\nbe the signal for an attack upon the Tower and other acts of atrocity.\r\nAs it was, before Hunt chose to appear, the mob, headed by the younger\r\nWatson, broke into gunsmiths' shops, not without bloodshed, and marched\r\nthrough the Royal Exchange, but were courageously met by the lord mayor,\r\nwith a few assistants, and very soon dispersed. The alarm produced in\r\nthe whole nation by this riotous fiasco was quite out of proportion to\r\nits real importance, and was reawakened by an insult offered to the\r\nprince regent on his return from opening parliament on January 28, 1817.\r\nEven Canning, a life-long opponent of reform, did not scruple to magnify\r\nthese and similar evidences of popular restlessness into proofs of a\r\ndeep-laid plot against the constitution, and committees of both houses\r\nurged the necessity of drastic measures to put down a conspiracy against\r\npublic order and private property. These measures took the form of bills\r\nfor the suppression of seditious meetings, and for the suspension until\r\nJuly 1 of the _habeas corpus_ act, which had been uninterruptedly in\r\nforce since its suspension by Pitt had expired in 1801. This last bill\r\nwas passed on March 3, and, before the other became law, the so-called\r\nmarch of the Blanketeers took place at Manchester. The march was the\r\nridiculous sequel of a very large meeting got up for the purpose of\r\ncarrying a petition to London, and presenting it to the prince regent in\r\nperson. The meeting was dispersed by the soldiers and police, after the\r\nriot act had been read, and a straggling crowd of some three hundred who\r\nbegan their pilgrimage, carrying blankets or overcoats, melted away by\r\ndegrees before they had got far southward.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _SIDMOUTH'S UNPOPULARITY._]\r\n\r\nA far more serious outbreak at Manchester seems to have been clumsily\r\nplanned soon afterwards, but it ended in nothing, and the enemies of the\r\ngovernment freely attributed this and other projects of mob violence to\r\nthe instigation of an _agent-provocateur_, well known as \"Oliver the\r\nSpy\". This man was also credited with the authorship of \"the Derbyshire\r\ninsurrection,\" for which three men were executed and many others\r\ntransported. Here there can be no doubt that a formidable gang, armed\r\nwith pikes, terrorised a large district, pressing operatives to join\r\nthem in overt defiance of the law, and killing one who held back. Being\r\nconfronted by a Nottinghamshire magistrate named Rolleston, with a small\r\nbody of soldiers, they fled across the fields, and the bubble of\r\nrebellion burst at a touch. Whether they were legally guilty of high\r\ntreason, for which they were unwisely tried, may perhaps be doubted, but\r\nit would certainly be no palliation of their crime if it could be shown,\r\nas it never was shown, that Oliver had led them to rely on a jacobin\r\nrevolution in London. What does appear very clearly is that Sidmouth\r\nwas greatly alarmed by the reports of his agents on the disturbed state\r\nof the country, but that he was highly conscientious in his instructions\r\nand in the use of his own powers. The great majority of those imprisoned\r\nfor political offences at this time were liberated or acquitted, but the\r\nsuspension of the _habeas corpus_ act was renewed at the beginning of\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a circular was addressed by Sidmouth to the lords-lieutenant\r\nof counties, for the information of the magistrates, intimating that, in\r\nthe opinion of the law officers, persons charged on oath with seditious\r\nlibel might be apprehended and held to bail. No act of Sidmouth called\r\nforth such an outburst of reprobation as this; yet it is not\r\nself-evident that instigations to outrage, being criminal offences,\r\nshould be treated by magistrates differently from other offences for\r\nwhich bail may be required, with the alternative of imprisonment. On the\r\nother hand, it is hardly becoming for a home secretary to interpret the\r\nlaw, and, since the forensic triumphs of Erskine, it had been declared\r\nby an act of parliament that in cases of libel, as distinct from all\r\nother criminal trials, both the law and the fact were within the\r\nprovince of the jury. At all events, William Cobbett, feeling himself to\r\nbe at the mercy of informers and the crown, took refuge in America in\r\nDecember, 1817. Hone, an antiquarian bookseller, was thrice prosecuted\r\nfor blasphemous libels, in which the ministers had been held up to\r\ncontempt. All these ill-judged, if not vindictive, prosecutions ended in\r\nsignal failure. Ellenborough, the chief justice, before whom the two\r\nlast trials were held, strained his judicial authority to procure a\r\nconviction of Hone, but the prisoner, with a spirit worthy of a martyr,\r\ndefied the intimidation of the court, and thrice carried the sympathies\r\nof the jury with him. His triple acquittal led to Ellenborough's\r\nresignation, and perceptibly shook the prestige of the government.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1818 there was a temporary improvement in the economic\r\ncondition of the country. The depression of the preceding year was\r\nfollowed in this year by a rapid increase of revenue. The importance the\r\nministry attached to finance was emphasised by the admission to the\r\ncabinet in January of Frederick John Robinson, afterwards prime minister\r\nas Lord Goderich, who had been appointed president of the board of\r\ntrade and treasurer of the navy. The chancellor of the exchequer and the\r\nmaster of the mint were already members of the cabinet. The suspension\r\nof the _habeas corpus_ act having expired, the reform agitation revived,\r\nbut assumed a less dangerous character, and no serious outbreak\r\noccurred. A bill of indemnity was passed to cover any excesses of\r\njurisdiction in arresting suspected persons or in suppressing tumultuous\r\nassemblies. A parliamentary inquiry showed both that the disorders of\r\nthe previous year had been exaggerated, and that, after all, the\r\nextraordinary powers of the home office had been used with moderation.\r\nNevertheless, the early part of the session was largely occupied by\r\nparty debates on these questions, the employment of spies, and\r\napprehensions for libel. Parliament was dissolved in June, and the\r\ngeneral election which followed resulted in a gain of several seats to\r\nthe opposition.[65] The ministry was strengthened in January, 1819, by\r\nthe appointment of Wellington to be master-general of the ordnance, in\r\nsuccession to Mulgrave, who remained in the cabinet without office.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE \"MANCHESTER MASSACRE\"._]\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the year 1818, a strike of Manchester cotton-spinners\r\nwas attended by the usual incidents of brutal violence towards workmen\r\nwho refused to join in it, but a few shots from the soldiers, one of\r\nwhich killed a rioter, proved effectual in quelling lawlessness.\r\nManchester, however, remained the centre of agitation, and during the\r\nsummer of 1819 a series of reform meetings held in other great towns\r\nculminated in a monster meeting originally convened for August 9, but\r\npostponed until the 16th. The history of this meeting ending in the\r\nso-called \"Manchester\" or \"Peterloo massacre,\" has been strongly\r\ncoloured by party spirit and sympathy with the victims of reckless\r\ndemagogy no less than of blundering officialism. It is certain that\r\ndrilling had been going on for some time among the multitudes invited to\r\nattend the meeting of the 9th; that its avowed object was to choose a\r\n\"legislatorial representative,\" as Birmingham had already done, and\r\nthat, on its being declared illegal by the municipal authorities, who\r\ndeclined to summon it on their own initiative, its organisers\r\ndeliberately resolved to hold it a week later, whether it were legal or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nThe contingents, which poured in by thousands from neighbouring towns,\r\nseem to have carried no arms but sticks, and to have conducted\r\nthemselves peaceably when they arrived at St. Peter's Fields, where\r\nOrator Hunt, puffed up with silly vanity, was voted into the chair on a\r\nhustings. Unfortunately, instead of attempting to prevent the meeting,\r\nthe county magistrates decided to let the great masses of people\r\nassemble, and then to arrest the leaders in the midst of them. They had\r\nat their disposal several companies of infantry, six troops of the 15th\r\nhussars, and a body of yeomanry, besides special constables. The chief\r\nconstable, being ordered to arrest Hunt and his colleagues, declared\r\nthat he could not do so without military aid, whereupon a small force of\r\nyeomanry advanced but soon became wedged up and enclosed by the densely\r\npacked crowd. One of the magistrates, fancying the yeomanry to be in\r\nimminent danger, of which there is no proof, called upon Colonel\r\nL'Estrange, who was in command of the soldiers, to rescue them and\r\ndisperse the mob. Four troops of the hussars then made a dashing charge,\r\nsupported by a few of the yeomanry; the people fled in wild confusion\r\nbefore them; some were cut down, more were trampled down, and an\r\neye-witness describes \"several mounds of human beings\" as lying where\r\nthey had fallen. Happily, the actual loss of life did not exceed five or\r\nsix, but a much larger number was more or less wounded, the real havoc\r\nand bloodshed were inevitably exaggerated by rumour, and a bitter sense\r\nof resentment was implanted in the breasts of myriads, innocent of the\r\nslightest complicity with sedition, but impatient of oligarchical rule,\r\nand disgusted with so ruthless an interference with the right of public\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nIt would have been wise if Sidmouth and his colleagues had recognised\r\nthis widespread feeling, had seen that famine and despair were at the\r\nbottom of popular discontent, and had admitted error of judgment, at\r\nleast, on the part of the Lancashire magistrates. On the contrary, they\r\nfelt it so necessary to support civil and military authority, at all\r\nhazards, that they induced the prince regent to express unqualified\r\napprobation of the course taken, and afterwards defended it without\r\nreserve in parliament. Even Eldon expressed his opinion privately that\r\nit would be hard to justify it, unless the assembly amounted to an act\r\nof treason, as he regarded it; whereas Hunt and his associates were\r\nprosecuted (and convicted in the next year) not for treason, but only\r\nfor a misdemeanour. At all events, the storm of indignation excited by\r\nthis sad event, and not confined to the working classes, powerfully\r\nfomented the reform movement. Large meetings were held over all the\r\nmanufacturing districts, and a requisition to summon a great Yorkshire\r\nmeeting was signed by Fitzwilliam, the lord-lieutenant, who attended it\r\nin person. For these acts he was properly dismissed, but, in spite of\r\ninflammatory speeches, nearly all the meetings passed off quietly and\r\nwithout interference. Nevertheless, the government thought it necessary\r\nto hold an autumn session, and strengthen the hands of the executive by\r\nfresh measures of repression. These having been passed in December after\r\nstrenuous opposition, were afterwards known as the six acts, and\r\nregarded as the climax of Sidmouth's despotic _régime_.\r\n\r\nTwo of the six acts, directed against the possession of arms and\r\nmilitary training for unlawful purposes, cannot be considered oppressive\r\nunder the circumstances then prevailing. Nor can exception be taken on\r\nthe ground of principle to another for \"preventing delay in the\r\nadministration of justice in cases of misdemeanour,\" which, indeed, was\r\namended, by Holland, with Eldon's consent, so as to benefit defendants\r\nin state prosecutions. Two were designed to curb still further the\r\nliberty of the press. One of these made the publication of seditious\r\nlibels an offence punishable with banishment, and authorised the seizure\r\nof all unsold copies. When we consider the extreme virulence of\r\nseditious libels in those days, this act does not wear so monstrous an\r\naspect as its radical opponents alleged, but happily it soon became a\r\ndead letter, and was repealed in 1830. The other, imposing a stamp-duty\r\non small pamphlets, only placed them on the same footing with\r\nnewspapers. The last of the new measures--\"to prevent more effectually\r\nseditious meetings and assemblies\"--was practically aimed against all\r\nlarge meetings, unless called by the highest authorities in counties and\r\ncorporate towns, or, at least, five justices of the peace. It was,\r\ntherefore, a grave encroachment on the right of public meeting, and the\r\nonly excuse for it was that it was passed under the fear of a\r\nrevolutionary movement, and limited in duration to a period of five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _SOCIAL LEGISLATION._]\r\n\r\nNor can it be denied that, as a whole, this restrictive code was\r\nsuccessful. From a modern point of view it may appear less arbitrary\r\nthan the suspension of the _habeas corpus_ act for a whole year\r\n(1817-18), but it was assuredly tainted with a reactionary spirit, and\r\nwas capable of being worked in a way inconsistent with civil liberty.\r\nThat it was not so worked, on the whole, and caused less hardship than\r\nhad been anticipated, was not so much the result of changes in the\r\ngovernment itself, as of economic progress in the nation, aided by a\r\nhealthier growth of public opinion. The violence which marked the early\r\nstages of the reform movement has been described as a safety-valve\r\nagainst anarchy; it was, in reality, the chief obstacle to a sound and\r\ncomprehensive reform bill. While it lasted, the middle classes and\r\nliberals of moderate views were estranged from the cause; when it\r\nceased, the demand for a new representative system became irresistible.\r\n\r\nWhatever allowance may be made for the coercive policy of the government\r\nduring the dark period of storm and stress which succeeded the great\r\nwar, it is hard to find any excuse for its neglect of social\r\nlegislation. Then, if ever, was a time when the work of Pitt's best days\r\nshould have been resumed, when real popular grievances should have been\r\nredressed, and when the long arrears of progressive reform should have\r\nbeen gradually redeemed. Yet very little was done to better the lot of\r\nmen, women, and children in Great Britain, and that little was chiefly\r\ninitiated by individuals. In 1816, on the motion of a private member, an\r\ninquiry was commenced into the state of the metropolitan police, which\r\ndisclosed most scandalous abuses, such as the habitual association of\r\nthieves and thief-takers, encouraged by the grants of blood-money which\r\nhad been continued since the days of Jonathan Wild. In 1817 a committee\r\nsanctioned by the ministers recommended a measure for the gradual\r\nabolition of sinecures, which then figured prominently in the domestic\r\ncharter of reform. Their recommendations were adopted, and a large\r\nnumber of sinecure offices were swept away. But inasmuch as sinecures\r\nhad been largely given to persons who had held public offices of\r\nbusiness, it was thought necessary to institute pensions to an amount\r\nnot exceeding one-half of the reduction. In 1816 a private member, named\r\nCurwen, brought forward a fanciful scheme of his own for the amendment\r\nof the poor laws, which in effect anticipated modern projects of old\r\nage pensions. He obtained the appointment of a select committee, which\r\nreported in 1817, but their proposals were thoroughly inadequate, and no\r\nsensible improvement came of them.\r\n\r\nIt was also in 1816 that the cause of national education, the importance\r\nof which had been vainly urged by Whitbread, was taken up in earnest by\r\nBrougham. His motion for the appointment of a select committee was\r\nconfined to the schools of the metropolis. It sat at intervals until\r\n1818, when its powers were enlarged, and its labours somewhat diverted\r\ninto a searching exposure of mismanagement in endowed charities. The one\r\ndirect fruit of the committee was the creation of the charity\r\ncommission, but in the opinion of Brougham himself it was of the highest\r\nvalue in opening the whole education question. The almost universal\r\nprevalence of distress in 1817, and the excessive burden thrown upon\r\npoor rates, induced parliament to authorise an expenditure of £750,000\r\nin Great Britain and Ireland for the employment of the labouring poor on\r\npublic works. A far sounder and more fruitful measure of relief owes its\r\norigin to the same year. It was now that the institution of savings\r\nbanks, hitherto promoted only by single philanthropists, emerged from\r\nthe experimental stage and claimed the attention of parliament. A bill\r\nfor their regulation, introduced by Pitt's friend, George Rose, did not\r\npass into an act; but the establishment of savings banks was now\r\ndirectly encouraged by the legislature, and there were thoughtful men\r\nwho already dimly foresaw the manifold benefits of their future\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE CURRENCY QUESTION._]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1819 was initiated a very important reform in the currency,\r\nwhich had long been delayed. When the bullion committee reported in\r\n1810, Bank of England notes were at a discount of about 13½ per cent.\r\nThere were several reasons why this should be the case. Continental\r\ntrade was then compelled to pass through British ports, and a large\r\nsupply of gold was needed to serve as the medium of this trade. There\r\nwas also a steady drain of gold to the Spanish peninsula to meet war\r\nexpenses, while troubles in South America diminished the annual output\r\nof the precious metals. In 1811 Bank of England notes were made legal\r\ntender, but no further action was then taken, and the depreciation\r\ncontinued until 1814. The magnificent harvest of 1813, together with\r\nother causes, brought about a sudden fall of prices, in consequence of\r\nwhich no less than 240 country banks stopped payment in the years\r\n1814-16. The decrease and popular distrust of private banknotes produced\r\nan increased demand for Bank of England notes, which in 1817 had nearly\r\nrisen in value to a par with gold. In 1819, when they were at a discount\r\nof only 4½ per cent., a committee was appointed by the house of\r\ncommons to reconsider the policy of resuming cash payments, and Peel,\r\nyoung as he was, became its chairman. In this character he abandoned his\r\npreconceived views and induced the house to adopt those which had been\r\nadvocated by Horner. It was not thought prudent to fix an earlier date\r\nthan 1823 for the actual resumption of cash payments, but the directors\r\nof the Bank of England anticipated this date, and began to exchange\r\nnotes for specie on May 1, 1821. The new standard was definitely one of\r\ngold. A considerable fall of prices ensued, and it is still a disputed\r\nquestion whether the return to a single standard was entirely\r\nbeneficial.\r\n\r\nBut for what is called the public, the readers of newspapers and the\r\nfrequenters of clubs or taverns, the rivalry of party leaders or the\r\nincidents of court life excite a much keener interest than painful\r\nefforts for the good of the humbler classes. During the closing years of\r\nGeorge III.'s reign there were no party conflicts of special intensity.\r\nThe whigs acquiesced in their self-imposed exclusion from office, and\r\ncontented themselves with damaging criticism; the radicals had not yet\r\nacquired the confidence or respect of the electors. Liverpool remained\r\nprime minister; Castlereagh, foreign secretary; Sidmouth, home\r\nsecretary; Vansittart, chancellor of the exchequer. Meanwhile there were\r\nstartling vicissitudes in the fortunes of the royal family. The king,\r\nindeed, remained under the cloud of mental derangement which darkened\r\nthe last ten years of his life, and the Princess of Wales, who had been\r\nthe object of so much scandal, was now out of sight and residing abroad.\r\nThe Princess Charlotte, however, the only daughter of the regent, had\r\ncentred in herself the loyalty and hopes of the nation in a remarkable\r\ndegree, and was credited, not unjustly, with private virtues and public\r\nsympathies contrasting strongly with the disposition of her father. Her\r\nmarriage with Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, who bore a high character,\r\nhad been hailed with national enthusiasm, for it was known that, like\r\nQueen Victoria, she had been carefully trained and had disciplined\r\nherself, physically and morally, for the duties of a throne. It has been\r\ntruly said that her death in childbirth, on November 6, was the great\r\nhistorical event of 1817. The prince regent, with his constitution\r\nweakened by dissipation, was not expected to survive her long, and so\r\nlong as his wife lived there was no prospect of other legitimate issue,\r\nunless he could procure a divorce. There was no grandchild of George\r\nIII. who could lawfully inherit the crown, and the apprehension of a\r\ncollateral succession became more and more generally felt.[66]\r\n\r\nIn the following year four royal marriages were announced. The Princess\r\nElizabeth espoused the Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg; the Duke of Clarence,\r\nthe Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen; the Duke of Cambridge, the\r\nPrincess Augusta of Hesse; the Duke of Kent, the Princess Victoria Mary\r\nof Saxe-Coburg. The Duke of Sussex was already married, but not with the\r\nnecessary consent of the crown, and the Duke of Cumberland was\r\nchildless, having married three years earlier a divorced widow whom the\r\nqueen, for private reasons, declined to receive. It is a striking proof\r\nof the discredit into which the royal family had fallen, since the old\r\nking virtually ceased to reign, that parliament, in spite of its\r\nanxiety about the succession, displayed an almost niggardly parsimony\r\nwhen it was moved to increase the allowances of the princes about to\r\nmarry. No application was made on behalf of the Princess Elizabeth or\r\nthe Duke of Sussex, who was already married morganatically. The\r\nadditional grant of £6,000 a year asked on behalf of the Duke of\r\nCumberland was refused by a small majority, partly, no doubt, because\r\nhis anti-liberal opinions and untrustworthy character were no secret to\r\npublic men. £10,000 a year was asked for the Duke of Clarence, and\r\njustified by Canning as less than he might fairly have claimed, but it\r\nwas reduced to £6,000 and declined by the duke as inadequate; he\r\nafterwards married without a parliamentary grant. The provision of\r\n£6,000 a year for the Dukes of Cambridge and Kent respectively was\r\nstoutly opposed but ultimately carried. Of all George III.'s sons, the\r\nDuke of Kent was perhaps the most respected. It has been truly said that\r\nif the nation could have expressed its dearest wish, in the spirit of\r\nprophecy, after the death of the Princess Charlotte, it would have been\r\nthat the issue of the Duke of Kent's marriage with Prince Leopold's\r\nsister might succeed, as Queen Victoria, to the crown of her\r\ngrandfather.[67]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE DEATH OF GEORGE III._]\r\n\r\nOn November 17, 1818, Queen Charlotte died, having filled her great and\r\nmost difficult position for nearly sixty years with sound judgment,\r\nexemplary moral integrity, and a certain homely dignity. The Duke of\r\nYork succeeded her as guardian of the king's person. Little more than a\r\nyear later she was followed to the grave by the Duke of Kent, who died\r\non January 23, 1820, and by the king himself, who died on January 29, in\r\nthe eighty-second year of his age. He was not a great sovereign, but, as\r\na man, he was far superior to his two predecessors, and must ever stand\r\nhigh, if not highest, in the gallery of our kings. His venerable figure,\r\nthough shrouded from view, was a chief mainstay of the monarchy. Narrow\r\nas his views were, and obstinately as he adhered to them, he was not\r\nincapable of changing them, and could show generosity towards enemies,\r\nas he ever showed fidelity to friends. His reception of Franklin after\r\nthe American war, and of Fox after the death of Pitt, was that of a\r\nking who understood his kingly office; and his strict devotion to\r\nbusiness, regardless of his own pleasure, could not have been exceeded\r\nby a merchant engrossed in lucrative trade. The many pithy and racy\r\nsayings recorded of him show an insight into men's characters and the\r\nrealities of life not unworthy of Dr. Johnson. His simplicity,\r\nkindliness, and charity endeared him to his subjects. His undaunted\r\ncourage and readiness to undertake sole responsibility, not only during\r\nthe panics of the Gordon riots and of the impending French invasion, but\r\nin many a political crisis, compelled the respect of all his ministers,\r\nand his disappearance from the scenes, to make way for the regency of\r\nhis eldest son, was almost as disastrous for English society as the\r\nexchange, in France, of Louis XIV.'s decorous rule for that of the\r\nRegent Orléans.\r\n\r\nThe European concert which had been called into existence by the war\r\nagainst Napoleon, and had effected a continental settlement at Vienna,\r\ncontinued to act for the maintenance of peace. The treaty of alliance of\r\n1815 only bound the four powers to common action in the event of a fresh\r\nrevolution in France which might endanger the tranquillity of other\r\nstates. The holy alliance was more comprehensive and wider in its aims,\r\nbut was too vague to form the practical basis of a federation. The\r\nsettlement of Europe by the treaty of Vienna was, however, the work of\r\nall the powers, and they had therefore an interest in everything that\r\nmight be likely to affect that settlement. The habit of concerted\r\naction, once formed, was not lightly abandoned, and the succeeding age\r\nwas an age of congresses. But though there was a general sentiment in\r\nfavour of concerted action it manifested itself in different ways. The\r\ncauses of the recent struggle with France had been political in their\r\norigin, and it was agreed that a recurrence of disorder from France\r\ncould be best prevented by the establishment of a government in that\r\ncountry which should be at once constitutional and legitimist. England\r\nfavoured, and Russia, the most autocratic of states, favoured still more\r\nvehemently, the development of constitutions wherever it might be\r\npracticable, while Austria, being composed of territories with no\r\nnational cohesion, endeavoured rather to thwart the growth of\r\nconstitutions. But Russia was also the most active advocate of joint\r\ninterference where a constitutional reform was effected by\r\nunconstitutional means. Great Britain and Austria, on the other hand,\r\nwith a juster instinct, considered armed interference an extreme remedy\r\nwhich might often be worse than the disease of a revolution.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _ROYALIST REACTION IN EUROPE._]\r\n\r\nThe numerous restorations of 1814 and 1815 were followed by a royalist\r\nand aristocratic reaction in many countries of Europe. In France Louis\r\nXVIII. found himself confronted by an ultra-royalist chamber of deputies\r\nwhich clamoured for vengeance on the partisans of the republican and\r\nimperial _régimes_ and for the restoration of the privileges and estates\r\nof the Church. Ferdinand VII. of Spain swept away the unwieldy\r\nconstitution of 1812 amid the rejoicings of his people, who little\r\nforesaw his future tyranny; and Great Britain did not venture to resist\r\nthe action of Ferdinand of the Two Sicilies in abolishing a constitution\r\nwhich British influence had induced him to grant his island kingdom in\r\n1813. In Prussia the government dealt sternly with the liberal press,\r\nand the provincial estates opposed the institution of a national diet;\r\nwhile in Würtemberg a parliament assembled under a liberal constitution\r\ndemanded the restoration of the ancient privileges of the nobility and\r\nclergy. In the Two Sicilies British influence, supported by that of\r\nAustria, was used to prevent outrages on the defeated party; in Spain\r\nthe moderate counsels of Great Britain were less successful. Austria\r\nendeavoured to prevent future disturbance in the Italian peninsula by a\r\nsecret treaty, which obtained the sanction of the British government,\r\nrequiring the Two Sicilies to adopt no constitutional changes\r\ninconsistent with the principles adopted by Austria in the\r\nLombardo-Venetian kingdom. Similar treaties were concluded by Austria\r\nwith Tuscany, Modena, and Parma, and she thus gained an ascendency in\r\nItaly, from which only Sardinia and the papal states were exempt.\r\nRussian agents meanwhile began to conduct a liberal propaganda in Spain\r\nand Italy, and Russia was even credited with a desire to make a\r\nliberalised Spain a counterpoise to England on the sea.\r\n\r\nFor a time, however, there were no European complications of a\r\nformidable nature. In 1816 a British squadron was sent out under Lord\r\nExmouth lo execute the decree of the congress of Vienna against the\r\nBarbary states. The Dey of Algiers and the Beys of Tunis and Tripoli\r\nwere called upon to recognise the Ionian Islands as British, to accept\r\nBritish mediation between them and the courts of the Two Sicilies and\r\nSardinia, to restore their Christian captives, and not to authorise\r\nfurther piracy. These terms were accepted by the Beys of Tunis and\r\nTripoli, and the two first demands were granted by the Dey of Algiers.\r\nHe was allowed a delay of three months in order to obtain the sultan's\r\npermission for granting the remainder, but in the interval a massacre of\r\nItalian fishermen took place at Bona. Lord Exmouth now sailed from\r\nGibraltar to attack Algiers. On his demands being again ignored, he\r\nbombarded that city on August 27 for more than six hours. The arsenal\r\nand storehouses and all the ships in the port were burned, and on the\r\nnext day the dey accepted Exmouth's terms; peace was signed on the 30th,\r\nthe principal terms being the abolition of Christian slavery, and the\r\ndelivery of all slaves to Exmouth on the following day.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Vienna in placing the Ionian Islands under British\r\nprotection had made no mention of the towns of Parga and Butrinto on the\r\nmainland of Epirus which had passed under British rule along with the\r\nislands. These places were now surrendered to Turkey in accordance with\r\na former treaty, in return for the Turkish recognition of the British\r\nprotectorate over the islands. The inhabitants of Parga were, however,\r\nvehemently opposed to such a transference of their allegiance, and they\r\nwere conveyed to the Ionian Islands and compensated for the loss of\r\ntheir property. The Turks entered into occupation of Parga in 1819. In\r\n1817 and 1818 wild rumours of Russian aggression in the direction of the\r\nMediterranean began to circulate in England. It was reported that Spain\r\nhad promised to cede Port Mahon to Russia; and that Russia was preparing\r\na great military force, to be employed, if necessary, in alliance with\r\nthe Bourbon states, France, Spain, and the Two Sicilies, to counteract\r\nBritish and Austrian influence. This influence, with that of Prussia,\r\nhad really been employed to keep the Dardanelles closed against Russian\r\nships. Meanwhile Austria had won over Prussia to her conservative policy\r\nin Germany.\r\n\r\nThe violent language of the liberal party, especially at the\r\nuniversities, already began to terrify the Prussian government. The\r\nfirst danger signal was given at the Wartburg festival of delegates from\r\nthe German universities in 1817, at which the students indulged in some\r\nboyish manifestations of their sympathies; their proceedings made some\r\nstir in Germany, and Metternich declared that they were revolutionary.\r\nThe horror of liberalism was destined to be heightened in 1819 by the\r\nmurder of the tsar's agent, the dramatist Kotzebue, by a lunatic member\r\nof a political society at Giessen. Its immediate result was a conference\r\nof German ministers at Carlsbad, where several resolutions for the\r\nsuppression of political agitation were passed, and afterwards adopted\r\nby the diet at Frankfort. This policy was embodied in the \"final act\" of\r\na similar conference held at Vienna in the following year (1820), which\r\nempowered the greater states of Germany to aid the smaller in checking\r\nrevolutionary movements. At the same time it reaffirmed the general\r\nprinciple of non-intervention, and even laid down the pregnant doctrine\r\nthat constitutions could not be legitimately altered except by\r\nconstitutional means. The union of Austria and Prussia on the\r\nconservative side had rather the effect of throwing the secondary states\r\nof southern Germany upon the liberal side. In the spring and summer of\r\n1818 Bavaria and Baden framed constitutions, and in 1819 Würtemberg once\r\nmore essayed parliamentary government, which the reactionary policy of\r\nher first parliament had compelled her to abandon. The significant fact\r\nin European politics was that Frederick William III. of Prussia, always\r\naccustomed to being led, had passed from the influence of Russia to that\r\nof Austria.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE CONFERENCE OF AIX-LA-CHAPELLE._]\r\n\r\nSuch were the general tendencies of European politics when the\r\nconference of Aix-la-Chapelle assembled on September 30, 1818. The\r\nprimary object of this conference was to consider the request of France\r\nfor a reduction in the indemnity demanded of her and for the evacuation\r\nof her territories by the four allied powers. Wellington and\r\nCastlereagh, who represented Great Britain, earned the gratitude of\r\nFrance by readily agreeing to these requests, which were granted without\r\nany difficulty. This question was obviously one which required such a\r\nconference to settle it; but the conference, having once assembled, was\r\nurged to deal with other difficulties that less directly concerned it.\r\nOne of these was a dispute between Denmark and Sweden about the\r\napportionment of the Danish debt, which, in consideration of the\r\nannexation of Norway to Sweden, under the treaty of Kiel, was to be\r\npartly borne by Sweden. Denmark appealed to the four powers,\r\nrepresenting that treaty as in fact a part of their own settlement of\r\nEurope. Sweden would not admit the right of the powers to intervene, but\r\nfinally settled her difficulty with Denmark by a separate negotiation\r\nconducted by the mediation of Great Britain in 1819.\r\n\r\nA still more doubtful question was raised by the request of Spain for\r\nthe assistance of the allied powers against her revolted colonies. The\r\nSpanish dependencies in America had declined to acknowledge Joseph\r\nBonaparte, and had lapsed into a state of chaos; the restoration of\r\nFerdinand VII. had induced most of them to return to their allegiance,\r\nbut the three south-eastern colonies, Banda Oriental (Uruguay), La Plata\r\n(the Argentine), and Paraguay, continued in revolt. In 1817 fortune\r\nturned still further against Spain; Monte Video, the capital of Banda\r\nOriental, was taken by Portugal, or rather by Brazil, and Chile revolted\r\nagainst Spain. On February 12, 1818, Chile proclaimed her independence,\r\nand she began at once to procure warships in England and the United\r\nStates, of which Lord Cochrane took command. The four allied powers and\r\nFrance had protested against the seizure of Monte Video, but otherwise\r\nSpain had been left to herself. Great Britain seemed to have more to\r\ngain than to lose by the insurrection. The revolted colonies were open\r\nto her commerce, and by weakening Spain they had strengthened the\r\nmaritime supremacy of Great Britain. Nevertheless Great Britain was\r\nwilling to mediate, on condition that Spain would make reasonable\r\nconcessions. Spain, however, refused to make any concessions at all, and\r\ncalled on the allied powers to aid her in crushing the insurrection by\r\nforce. Great Britain did not regard an unconditional subjection of the\r\ncolonies as either expedient or practicable, and opposed this course;\r\nAustria took the same view, and thus placed intervention out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE EUROPEAN ALLIANCE._]\r\n\r\nBut the principal question before the conference of Aix-la-Chapelle was\r\nnot one relating to any particular difficulty, but the permanent form of\r\nthe European alliance. The tsar desired a general confederacy of\r\nEuropean powers, such as had signed the treaty of Vienna and the holy\r\nalliance. This confederacy was to guard against two evils--that of\r\nrevolutionary agitation and that of arbitrary administration and\r\nsectional alliances. Such a project, though doubtless proposed in good\r\nfaith, practically gave Russia an interest in the domestic movements,\r\nboth reactionary and constitutional, of every country, while it forbade\r\nany political combination to which Russia was not a party. Castlereagh\r\nagreed with Metternich in thinking that such an extension of Russian\r\nInfluence was more to be dreaded than local disorder, and Great Britain\r\nand Austria proposed therefore that the alliance should be based on the\r\ntreaty of Chaumont, as renewed at Vienna and Paris, though they were\r\nwilling to have friendly discussions from time to time without extending\r\nthe scope of the alliance. All parties desired to include France in\r\ntheir alliance, but the tsar pertinently objected that France could not\r\nbe admitted to an alliance aimed solely against France. A compromise was\r\ntherefore adopted. The quadruple alliance for war, in case of a\r\nrevolution in France, was secretly renewed, and centres for mobilisation\r\nwere fixed, while France was publicly invited to join the deliberations\r\nof the allied powers. A secret protocol was then signed providing for\r\nthe meeting of congresses from time to time, and giving the minor\r\nEuropean powers a place in these congresses when their affairs should be\r\nunder discussion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[64] For details of the riots see _Annual Register_, lviii. (1816),\r\n60-73. They were particularly numerous in May, 1816, and in the counties\r\nof Cambridge, Essex, and Suffolk.

For the accession of the king, who\r\nhad so long exercised royal functions as regent, produced no visible\r\neffect either on the personal composition or on the general policy of\r\nthe government. Immediately after his proclamation he was attacked by a\r\ndangerous illness, but on his recovery he promptly raised two questions\r\nwhich nearly involved a change of ministry. One of these was a proposal\r\nto increase his private revenue, which he was induced to abandon for the\r\npresent. The other was a demand for a divorce, which the ministers\r\nfirmly resisted, though they ultimately agreed to a compromise, under\r\nwhich the divorce question was to be deferred, so long as the queen\r\nremained quietly abroad, but action was to be taken in case she returned\r\nto assert her rights.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE CATO STREET CONSPIRACY._]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these difficulties the lives of the ministers were\r\nthreatened by a plot somewhat like those of the seventeenth century.\r\nLater writers have represented it as contemptible in its conception, and\r\nas directly provoked by the \"Manchester massacre\". So it may be said\r\nthat Guy Fawkes was an insignificant person, and that his employers were\r\nexasperated by the severe treatment of popish recusants. The facts are\r\nthat Arthur Thistlewood, the author of the Cato Street conspiracy, was a\r\nwell-known confederate of the Watsons and other members of the extreme\r\nreform party, and that his plan for murdering the assembled cabinet in a\r\nprivate house would probably have been effectual, had it not been\r\ndetected by the aid of an informer. This informer, Edwards, had warned\r\nthe authorities in November, 1819, of the impending stroke, and may or\r\nmay not have instigated Thistlewood's gang to execute it at a moment and\r\nplace well-calculated to secure their arrest. At all events twenty-four\r\nconspirators armed themselves in Cato Street, near the Edgware Road,\r\nLondon, for the purpose of assassinating the ministers at a cabinet\r\ndinner in Harrowby's house in Grosvenor Square, and some of their\r\nassociates were posted near the door of that house to summon them when\r\nthe guests should have assembled. Harrowby's dinner was of course put\r\noff, but the watchers were deceived by the arrival of carriages for a\r\ndinner party next door, and failed to apprise the gang in Cato Street.\r\nThe police rushed in upon the gang, but a body of soldiers ordered to\r\nsupport them reached the spot too late, a policeman was stabbed, and\r\nThistlewood, with twelve or fourteen others, contrived to escape. He was\r\ncaptured the next morning, and executed with four of his accomplices,\r\nfive more were transported for life, and the atrocity of the enterprise\r\nwas naturally treated in the king's speech as a justification for the\r\nrepressive measures in operation. In the following April a petty\r\noutbreak in Scotland was easily put down by a few troops at a place\r\ncalled Bonnymuir. It was, however, preceded by a treasonable\r\nproclamation, which spread terror among the citizens of Glasgow for\r\nseveral hours, and was sufficiently like an attempt at armed rebellion\r\nto confirm the alarm excited by the Cato Street conspiracy. In the face\r\nof such warnings, the energy of the government in stamping out disorder\r\ncould hardly be censured.\r\n\r\nThe last parliament of George III. was prorogued on February 28, 1820,\r\nand dissolved on the following day. One of its last debates was on Lord\r\nJohn Russell's proposal to suspend the issue of writs to the boroughs of\r\nGrampound, Penryn, Barnstaple, and Camelford. This was carried in the\r\nhouse of commons, but lost in the house of lords. The new parliament was\r\nopened by George IV. in person on April 21. Widespread excitement\r\noccasioned by the question of the divorce prevented the business of the\r\nfirst session from attracting much attention. A deficit in the revenue,\r\ncoinciding with growing expenditure, compelled Vansittart to fall back\r\non a fresh manipulation of the sinking fund. One measure, however, of\r\nthe highest importance was introduced by Brougham. The committee of 1814\r\non national education had amassed a great body of valuable evidence,\r\nand he now founded upon its report a comprehensive bill extending to the\r\nwhole country. It placed the management and teaching of elementary\r\nschools entirely in the hands of Churchmen, and was dropped after the\r\nfirst reading, but the conscience of the nation was roused by it, and it\r\nbore fruit later. Further slight mitigations of the criminal law were\r\ncarried as a result of attacks made by Sir James Mackintosh, upon whom\r\nthe mantle of Romilly had fallen, and it is worthy of notice that even\r\nEldon, the stout opponent of such mitigations, condemned the use of\r\nspring-guns, as a safeguard against poaching. The only ministerial\r\nchange in this year was the final retirement in May of Lord Mulgrave,\r\nwho had held high office in every ministry except that of Grenville\r\nsince 1804, and had voluntarily surrendered his post at the head of the\r\nordnance in 1818 to make room for Wellington.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _QUEEN CAROLINE._]\r\n\r\nThe \"queen's trial,\" as it is erroneously called, was the last act but\r\none in a domestic tragedy which had lasted twenty-five years. The\r\nPrincess Caroline of Brunswick was a frivolous and ill-disciplined young\r\nwoman when she was selected by George III. as a wife for the\r\nheir-apparent, already united and really attached to Mrs. Fitzherbert.\r\nThe princess could not have been married to a man less capable of\r\ndrawing out the better side of her character, nor was she one to inspire\r\nhis selfish and heartless nature with a sentiment, if not of conjugal\r\nlove, yet of conjugal friendship. From the first there was no pretence\r\nof affection between them. A few years after her marriage she was\r\nrelegated, not unwillingly, to live independently at Blackheath, where\r\nmany eminent men accepted her hospitality. During this period, as we\r\nhave seen, a \"delicate investigation\" into her conduct was instituted in\r\n1806. Though she emerged from it with less stain on her character than\r\nhad been expected, she never enjoyed the respect of the royal family or\r\nof the nation, and there was no question of her sharing the home of her\r\nhusband. Instead of being a bond of concord between them, the education\r\nof her daughter was the subject of constant discord, requiring the\r\nfrequent intervention of the old king until he lost his reason. After\r\nshe went abroad in 1814, she travelled widely, but her English\r\nattendants soon retired from her service, and she incurred fresh\r\nsuspicion by her flighty and undignified conduct. She had no part in the\r\nrejoicing for the marriage, or in the mourning for the death, of the\r\nPrincess Charlotte; and in 1818 a secret commission, afterwards known as\r\nthe Milan commission, was sent out by the prince regent to collect\r\nevidence for a divorce suit. Not only Liverpool, but Eldon, who had\r\nformerly stood her friend, concurred in the appointment of this\r\ncommission, promoted by Sir John Leach, and its report was the\r\nfoundation of the proceedings now taken against her.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings were immediately due to her own action in returning to\r\nEngland in June, 1820, but this action was not wholly unprovoked. She\r\nhad long and bitterly resented her official exclusion from foreign\r\ncourts, and when, after the king's accession, her name was omitted from\r\nthe prayer-book, she protested against it as an intolerable insult.\r\nContrary to the advice of her wisest partisans, including Brougham, she\r\npersisted in braving the wrath of the king and throwing herself upon the\r\npeople. She was received at Dover with acclamations from immense\r\nmultitudes; and her journey to and through London was a continued\r\novation. Not that her innocence was established even in the popular\r\nmind, but that, innocent or guilty, she was regarded as a persecuted\r\nwoman, and persecuted by a worthless husband. The ministry fulfilled its\r\npromise to the king by moving the house of lords to institute an inquiry\r\ninto the queen's conduct. Pending this, conferences took place between\r\nWellington and Castlereagh, on the part of the king, and Brougham and\r\nDenman on that of the queen. It was at once laid down as a preliminary\r\nbasis of the negotiation that neither should the king be understood to\r\nretract, nor the queen to admit, any allegation against her. The points\r\nupon which she inflexibly insisted were, the recognition of her royal\r\nstatus at foreign courts, through an official introduction by the\r\nBritish ambassador, and the insertion of her name in the prayer-book.\r\n\r\nThe house of commons, on the motion of Wilberforce, offered to protect\r\nher honour (whatever that might import) on condition of her waiving this\r\nlast point, but she courteously declined its conciliatory proposals on\r\nJune 22. On July 4 a secret committee of the house of lords recommended\r\na solemn investigation, to be carried out \"in the course of a\r\nlegislative proceeding,\" and on the 8th Liverpool introduced a bill of\r\npains and penalties, to deprive her of her title, and to dissolve her\r\nmarriage. The second reading of this bill was formally set down for\r\nAugust 17, and for several weeks afterwards the house of lords was\r\noccupied in hearing evidence in support of the charges against her. The\r\nwhole country was deluged with the squalid details of this evidence, the\r\nministers were insulted, and the sympathy of the populace with her cause\r\nwas obtrusively displayed in every part of the kingdom. On October 3,\r\nafter an adjournment of the lords, Brougham opened the defence in the\r\nmost celebrated of his speeches. On November 2 the lord chancellor,\r\nEldon, moved the second reading of the bill, and on the 8th it was\r\ncarried by a majority of twenty-eight. Four days later, on the third\r\nreading, the majority had dwindled to nine only. Knowing the temper of\r\nthe house of commons, Liverpool treated such a victory as almost\r\nequivalent to a defeat, and announced that the government would not\r\nproceed further with the measure.\r\n\r\nHad the queen possessed the virtue of self-respect or dignity, she would\r\nhave been satisfied with this legislative, though not morally decisive,\r\nacquittal. But she was intoxicated with popular applause, largely due to\r\nher royal consort's vices, and, after London had been illuminated for\r\nthree nights in her honour, she declined overtures from the government,\r\nand appealed for a maintenance to the house of commons, which granted\r\nher an annuity of £50,000 in the next session. But she never lived to\r\nenjoy it After going in procession to St. Paul's, to return thanks for\r\nher deliverance, on the 29th, and vainly attempting, once more, to\r\nprocure the mention of her name in the prayer-book, she concentrated her\r\nefforts on a claim of right to be crowned with the king. No government\r\ncould have conceded this claim, and, when it had been refused by the\r\nprivy council, her solemn protests were inevitably vain. Even her least\r\nprudent counsellors would assuredly have dissuaded her from the attempt\r\nwhich she made to force an entrance into Westminster Abbey on the\r\ncoronation day, July 19, 1821. It was a painful scene when she, who had\r\nso lately been the idol of the fickle populace, was turned away from the\r\ndoors amidst conflicting exclamations of derision and pity. A fortnight\r\nlater, on August 2, she was officially reported to be seriously ill; on\r\nthe 7th she was no more. In accordance with her own direction her body\r\nwas buried at Brunswick. Her ill-founded popularity was shown for the\r\nlast time, when a riotous multitude succeeded in diverting her funeral\r\nprocession, and forcing it to pass through the city on its way to\r\nHarwich. But it did not survive her long; the people were becoming tired\r\nof her, and the king, who had forfeited the respect of the middle and\r\nupper classes, was less hated by the lower classes after her death.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _GEORGE IV. IN IRELAND._]\r\n\r\nThe personal character and opinions of George IV. seem to have\r\ninfluenced politics less during the early years of his reign than during\r\nhis long regency. His coronation was celebrated with unprecedented\r\nmagnificence, and amidst external demonstrations of loyalty, hard to\r\nreconcile with the unbounded enthusiasm which the queen had so lately\r\ninspired. Soon afterwards, he sailed in his yacht from Portsmouth on a\r\nvoyage to Ireland, but put into Holyhead and there awaited news of the\r\nqueen's expected death. This reached him at last, and probably impressed\r\nhim, no less than his ministers, as \"the greatest of all possible\r\ndeliverances, both to his majesty and the country\".[68] He proceeded to\r\nDublin in one of the earliest steam-packets, and secluded himself until\r\n\"the corpse of his wife was supposed to have left England\".[69] He then\r\nplunged into a round of festivities, and pleased all classes of Irishmen\r\nby his affable and condescending manners. He was, indeed, the first\r\nsovereign of England who had appeared in Ireland on a mission of peace.\r\nJohn William Ward, afterwards fourth Viscount Dudley in his letters,\r\ndescribes him as having behaved like a popular candidate on an\r\nelectioneering trip, and surmises that \"if the day before he left\r\nIreland, he had stood for Dublin, he might have turned out Shaw or\r\nGrattan \".[70] Certain it is that his visit to Ireland was regarded as\r\nan important political event. The same kind of success attended his\r\nvisit to Scotland in August of the following year, 1822. Thenceforth, he\r\nscarcely figures in political life until the resignation of Lord\r\nLiverpool in 1827, and though he consented with reluctance to Canning's\r\ntenure of the foreign office, he did not attempt to interfere with the\r\nchange in foreign policy consequent upon it. He was, in fact, sinking\r\nmore and more into an apathetic voluptuary; but he could rouse himself,\r\nand exhibit some proofs of ability, under the impulse of his brothers,\r\nthe honest Duke of York and the arch-intriguer, the Duke of Cumberland.\r\n\r\nThe cry for retrenchment, now taken up by the country gentlemen, and not\r\nunmingled with suggestions for a partial repudiation of the national\r\ndebt, compelled the government to adopt a policy of strict economy.\r\nAccordingly, in 1822, Vansittart introduced a scheme for the conversion\r\nof the so-called \"Navy 5 per cents.,\" which resulted in a saving of\r\nabove £1,000,000 annually. He also carried a more questionable scheme\r\nfor the payment of military, naval, and civil pensions, which then\r\namounted to £4,900,000 a year, but were falling in rapidly; the money\r\nrequired for this purpose was to be borrowed by trustees, and was to be\r\nrepaid in the course of forty-five years at the rate of £2,800,000 a\r\nyear; in this way an immediate saving of about £2,000,000 annually was\r\neffected at the cost, however, of the next generation. By means of these\r\nexpedients, with a considerable reduction of official salaries, the\r\ngovernment was enabled to repeal the additional duty on malt, to\r\ndiminish the duties on salt and leather, and, on the whole to remit\r\nabout £3,500,000 of taxes. When the entire credit of financial reform is\r\ngiven to Huskisson, Joseph Hume, and other economists of the new school,\r\nit should not be forgotten that a beginning was made by economists of\r\nthe old school, before Huskisson joined the government in 1823, or\r\nRobinson took Vansittart's place as chancellor of the exchequer.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of this reign a more enlightened spirit may be traced\r\nin parliamentary debates. This was aided by the growth of a\r\nconstitutional movement in favour of reform in parliament as the first\r\nstep towards a redress of grievances. The movement left its first trace\r\non the statute-book in a measure carried by Lord John Russell in the\r\nsession of 1821 for the disfranchisement of Grampound, though the vacant\r\nseats were transferred to the county of York, instead of to the\r\n\"village\" of Leeds or some other of the great unrepresented cities. This\r\nwas the first instance of the actual disfranchisement of a constituency,\r\nthough it was not without precedent that the franchise of a corrupt\r\nborough should be extended to the freeholders of the surrounding\r\ndistrict. A notable sign of the progressive change was the\r\nreconstruction of the cabinet in 1822. Liverpool, who always possessed\r\nthe gift of working harmoniously with colleagues of different views and\r\nfelt the weakness of his present ministry, once more attempted to bring\r\nabout a coalition with the Grenville party in the opposition. Grenville\r\nhad long been drifting away from his alliance with Grey, and had been a\r\nstout advocate of repressive legislation which the more advanced whigs\r\nopposed. Though he declined office for himself, several of his relatives\r\nand adherents were rewarded with minor appointments, his cousin, Charles\r\nWynn, became president of the board of control, in succession to\r\nBragge-Bathurst, who had himself succeeded Canning in the previous year,\r\nand his nephew, the Marquis of Buckingham, obtained a dukedom. Such\r\nrecruits added little strength to the Liverpool government, and Holland\r\nwell said that \"all articles are now to be had at low prices, except\r\nGrenvilles\".\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE DEATH OF CASTLEREAGH._]\r\n\r\nBut Liverpool gained far more powerful coadjutors in the Marquis\r\nWellesley, Peel, and Canning. In December, 1821, Wellesley undertook the\r\nlord-lieutenancy of Ireland, which had relapsed into so disturbed a\r\nstate that it had been proposed to make Wellington both viceroy and\r\ncommander-in-chief. The significance of this selection was increased by\r\nthe appointment of Plunket as attorney-general. Sidmouth, while\r\nretaining his seat in the cabinet, retired, by his own wish, from the\r\noffice of home secretary, with a sense of having pacified the country,\r\nand was succeeded by Peel. Castlereagh, now Marquis of Londonderry,\r\nremained foreign secretary, but on August 12, 1822, as he was on the\r\npoint of setting out for the congress of Verona, he died, like Whitbread\r\nand Romilly, by his own hand. His suicidal act was clearly due to a\r\nmorbid fit of depression, under the stress of anxieties protracted over\r\nmore than twenty years; and the disordered state of his mind had been\r\nobserved, not only by Wellington, but also by the king. His successor\r\nwas Canning, who also became leader of the house of commons.\r\n\r\nThe characters and political aims of these rival statesmen have often\r\nbeen contrasted by historians of a later age, who have seldom done\r\njustice to Castlereagh. It is remembered that he was the author of the\r\nWalcheren expedition; it is forgotten that he was the advocate of\r\nsending a powerful force to the Baltic coast at the critical moment\r\nbetween Jena and Eylau, that he was not altogether responsible for the\r\ndelays which rendered the Walcheren expedition abortive or for the\r\nchoice of its incompetent commander, that his prime object was to strike\r\na crushing blow at Napoleon's naval power, and that, if his\r\ninstructions had been obeyed, this would have been effected by a rapid\r\nadvance upon Antwerp when nearly all the French troops had been\r\nwithdrawn from the Netherlands. It is remembered that he was at the war\r\noffice when the operations of Wellington in the Peninsula were crippled\r\nfor want of supplies; it is forgotten that it was he who selected\r\nWellington, and that he loyally strained every nerve to keep him\r\nsupplied with troops, provisions, and specie, when few but himself\r\nbelieved in the policy of the Peninsular war, and Sir John Moore had\r\nassured him that if the French dominated Spain, they could not be\r\nresisted in Portugal. It is remembered--or rather it is assumed--that he\r\nwas the eager promoter of coercive and reactionary legislation at home;\r\nit is forgotten, or ignored, that he was among the earliest and\r\nstaunchest advocates of catholic emancipation, and that a despotic\r\ntemper is belied by the whole tone of his speeches. Above all, he is\r\nunjustly credited, in the face of direct evidence to the contrary, with\r\nbeing the champion of absolutism in the councils of Europe, the fact\r\nbeing not only that his voice was always on the side of moderation and\r\nconciliation, but that Canning himself, on succeeding him, dissociated\r\nGreat Britain from the holy alliance by taking his stand upon an\r\nadmirable despatch of Castlereagh and adopting it as his own. When he\r\nmet with his tragical end, the brutal shouts of exultation raised by a\r\nportion of the crowd at his funeral were the expression of sheer\r\nignorance and not of intelligent public opinion. He was a tory, in days\r\nwhen most patriots were tories, but he was a tory of the best type; and\r\nwe of a later generation can see that few statesmen of George III.'s\r\nreign have left a purer reputation or rendered greater services to their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _CANNING AND PEEL._]\r\n\r\nGeorge Canning, his successor, has been far more favourably judged by\r\nposterity, and not without reason, if intellectual brilliancy is a\r\nsupreme test of political merit. A firm adherent of Pitt, and a somewhat\r\nunscrupulous critic of Addington, he was probably the first\r\nparliamentary orator of the nineteenth century, with the possible\r\nexception of Sheridan. Pitt's eloquence was of a loftier and simpler\r\ntype, Fox's was more impetuous and spontaneous; Peel's range of\r\npolitical knowledge was far wider; Gladstone excelled all, not only in\r\nlength of experience but in readiness and dialectical resource.\r\nCanning's rhetoric was of a finer quality and was combined with great\r\ndebating power, but he was a man to inspire admiration rather than\r\nconfidence, and had not held one of the higher political offices since\r\nhis resignation in 1809, after his quarrel with Castlereagh. He accepted\r\na mission to Portugal, however, and was in Lisbon when Napoleon returned\r\nfrom Elba. In 1816, as has been seen, he became president of the board\r\nof control, but, having been formerly one of the queen's advisers, he\r\ndeclined to have anything to do with her trial and remained abroad\r\nduring its continuance. In December, 1820, he returned, but persisted in\r\nresigning his place at the board of control on the supposed ground that\r\nfurther parliamentary discussion of the queen's case was inevitable. On\r\nthis occasion he received a special vote of thanks from the directors of\r\nthe East India Company for his services on the board. The king objected\r\nto his readmission after the queen's death, and he was a private member\r\nof parliament when he was offered and undertook the governor-generalship\r\nof India in March, 1822. But his departure was delayed until August, and\r\nhe was on his way to bid farewell to his constituents at Liverpool when\r\nCastlereagh destroyed himself. It was generally felt that no other man\r\nwas so well qualified as Canning to succeed him. But the king declared\r\nhis \"final and unalterable decision\" to sanction no such change. Though\r\nhe afterwards relented, on the remonstrances of Wellington, he did so\r\nwith a bad grace; but there was no delay on Canning's part in accepting\r\nthe foreign secretaryship thus offered. From his acceptance may be dated\r\nthe most remarkable part of his career.\r\n\r\nThe accession of Peel to the Liverpool ministry, in the capacity of home\r\nsecretary; was only less important than that of Canning. Hitherto, Peel\r\nhad mostly been known to the British public as chief secretary for\r\nIreland, and as chairman of the committee which, in 1819, recommended\r\nthe early resumption of cash payments. In both these posts he displayed\r\na certain moderation and independence of mind, combined with a rare\r\ncapacity for business, which marked him out as a great administrator.\r\nThis promise he amply fulfilled as home secretary. He was the first\r\nminister of the crown who took up the philanthropic work of Romilly and\r\nMackintosh, largely reducing the number of offences for which capital\r\npunishment could be inflicted. He was also the first to reform the\r\npolice system of London, and to substitute for a multitude of decrepit\r\nwatchmen, incapable of dealing with gangs of active criminals, a\r\ndisciplined body of stalwart constables, which has since been copied in\r\nevery county and large town of Great Britain. Above all, while he cannot\r\nbe said to have shown a statesmanlike insight or foresight of the\r\nhighest order, he could read the signs of the times and the temper of\r\nhis countrymen with a sagacity far beyond that of his predecessor,\r\nSidmouth, or of such politicians as Eldon and Castlereagh. In him was\r\nrepresented the domestic policy of Pitt in his earlier days, as Pitt's\r\nfinancial views were represented in Huskisson, who had actually served\r\nunder him.\r\n\r\nThough Huskisson was only made president of the board of trade, in\r\nJanuary, 1823, and not chancellor of the exchequer, it is certain that\r\nhis mind controlled that of Robinson, who succeeded Vansittart in that\r\nposition. Vansittart, who was created Lord Bexley, succeeded\r\nBragge-Bathurst as chancellor of the duchy. The cabinet changes were\r\ncompleted in October by the removal of Wellesley Pole, now Lord\r\nMaryborough, from the office of master of the mint. Huskisson, if any\r\nman, was the leading pioneer of free trade, and there can be little\r\ndoubt that, had he not died prematurely, its adoption would have been\r\nhastened by ten or fifteen years. In his first year of office he\r\nwelcomed petitions for the repeal of the import duties on foreign wool,\r\nbut failed to convince the wool manufacturers that it must be\r\naccompanied by the abolition of export duties on British wool. The\r\nproposed reform was, therefore, dropped, and a like fate befell his\r\nattempt in the same year to benefit the silk trade by abolishing certain\r\nvexatious restrictions upon it, including the practice of fixing the\r\nwages of Spitalfields weavers by an order of the magistrates. For the\r\nmoment the ignorant outcry of the journeymen themselves prevailed over\r\ntheir real interests, but in the following year, 1824, Huskisson carried\r\na much wider measure, providing that foreign silks, hitherto excluded,\r\nshould be admitted subject to a duty of 30 per cent. in and after 1826,\r\nand another measure for the joint relief of wool growers and wool\r\nmanufacturers which imposed a small duty of equal amount on the\r\nimportation and the exportation of wool.\r\n\r\nHis great achievement in 1823 was the reform of the navigation laws.\r\nThese acts, dating from the commonwealth and the restoration, gave\r\nBritish shipowners a qualified monopoly of the carrying trade, since\r\nthey prohibited the importation of European goods except in British\r\nships or ships of the producing country, while the importation of goods\r\nfrom other quarters of the world was confined to British ships only.\r\nAmerica had protested against this exclusive system, and it was\r\nabandoned, as regards the United States, by the treaty of Ghent in 1814.\r\nThe mercantile states of Europe soon followed the example of America,\r\nand the reciprocity of duties bill, introduced by Huskisson on June 6,\r\n1823, conceded equal rights to all countries reciprocating the\r\nconcession, only retaining the exclusion against such countries as might\r\nreject equality of trade. The change involved some hardship to\r\nshipowners who had built their vessels with timber bought at prices\r\nraised by heavy duties, but they were too shortsighted to accept the\r\ncompromise offered by Huskisson. Before long, however, the act was\r\njustified, and the shipowners compensated by a rapid increase in British\r\nshipping.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _AGRICULTURAL DISCONTENT._]\r\n\r\nFor nearly five years after the accession of George IV. the state of the\r\ncountry was, on the whole, more prosperous, and the industrial classes\r\nwere more contented, than in the five years next preceding. Such\r\nrestlessness as there was prevailed among farmers and agricultural\r\nlabourers rather than among workmen in the manufacturing districts, and\r\nin 1823 every branch of manufactures was reported to be flourishing. It\r\nis difficult for a later generation, accustomed to consider 30s. a\r\nquarter a fair price for wheat, to understand the perennial complaints\r\nand petitions of the agricultural interest when 60s. a quarter was\r\nregarded as a low price for wheat, and the cultivation of wheat extended\r\nover a vastly larger area than it does at present. Nor is the difficulty\r\nlessened, when we remember the miserably low rate of wages then paid by\r\nfarmers. A partial explanation may be found in the fact that what they\r\nsaved in wages they lost in poor rates, and that most agricultural\r\nproducts except corn were sold at a very small profit. The high poor\r\nrates were the result of the disastrous system of giving allowances to\r\nlabourers.\r\n\r\nBut there were other evils caused by the vicious policy pursued by the\r\ngovernment. The encouragement of home production had led to the\r\nenclosure of land not fit for cultivation, so that a slight fall in\r\nprices meant ruin to many farmers. Moreover, the corn laws, though\r\nframed for the purpose of arresting fluctuations in price, actually\r\nincreased fluctuations and thus enhanced the risks attending\r\nagricultural enterprise. Nor were landlords who had thriven on war\r\nprices, and raised the scale of their establishments as if these prices\r\nwere to be perpetual, willing to reduce their rents on the return of\r\npeace. Rent was said to have risen 70 per cent. since 1792; but the\r\nlandlords were often embarrassed, because their lands had too often been\r\nburdened with jointures, settlements, and mortgages during the war. It\r\nwas in their interest that the act of 1815, which aimed at maintaining\r\nwar prices, had been passed. But the deeper reason for all this clamour\r\nfrom the rural districts was the stagnation of ideas, and incapacity of\r\nimprovement, engendered by an artificial monopoly of the national food\r\nsupply. This was not the special lesson impressed upon landlords or\r\ntenants by Cobbett, whose violent and delusive writings had a large\r\ncirculation in the country. But his teaching was so far beneficial that\r\nit quickened the demand for parliamentary reform, though the fruits of\r\nthat reform were destined to be very different from the expectations\r\nwhich he excited.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _SPECULATIVE FRENZY._]\r\n\r\nThe spell of general prosperity which, in spite of some distress in the\r\nrural districts, prevailed in the years 1820-23 was somewhat broken in\r\n1824 by strikes and outrages in the manufacturing districts. Strikes for\r\nhigher wages naturally arose out of the increase in mill owners'\r\nprofits, and the ferocious spirit displayed by the strikers against\r\nmasters and fellow-workmen was attributed by reformers to the one-sided\r\noperation of the combination laws. Accordingly, a committee of the house\r\nof commons reported in favour of repealing these laws, and also part of\r\nthe common law which treated coercion either by trade unions or by\r\nmasters as conspiracy. A bill founded on this report was hastily passed,\r\nwith the natural result that strikes broke out in every quarter of the\r\ncountry; wholesale and cruel oppression was practised by trade\r\nunionists, and it became necessary for parliament to retrace its steps.\r\nUnder a new act, passed in 1825, which continued in force until very\r\nrecent times, trade unions were recognised as legal, but their worst\r\nmalpractices were once more brought within the control of the criminal\r\nlaw.[71] So far the commercial policy of Huskisson was justified, as a\r\nwhole, by its effects on trade, and the session of 1824 was closed on\r\nJune 25 by a cheerful speech from the king, in which the disturbed state\r\nof Ireland was the only topic suggestive of anxiety. Already, however,\r\nthe revival of commercial hopefulness at home, with the opening of new\r\nmarkets in South America, was paving the way for the most ruinous mania\r\nof speculation known in England since the south sea bubble. It was well\r\nthat sound and sober-minded economists now guided the action of the\r\ngovernment, and that Liverpool proved himself a worthy successor of Sir\r\nRobert Walpole during the great financial crisis of 1825.[72]\r\n\r\nThe speculative frenzy of 1825 differed from the railway mania of the\r\nnext generation in that it had no solid basis of remunerative\r\ninvestment. The development of the railway system, after the application\r\nof locomotive steam engines to iron tramways, offered a legitimate\r\npromise of large profits, and this promise would have been still more\r\namply realised but for the shameful waste of capital on competition and\r\nlaw expenses. It was otherwise with the dupes and victims of the rage\r\nfor speculation which possessed all classes of society in 1825, and\r\narose out of an immense accumulation of wealth for which no safe\r\nemployment could be found at home except at a modest rate of interest.\r\nThe weakening of the hold of Spain on South America left her colonies\r\nopen to foreign trade, but the enterprises there and elsewhere which\r\nabsorbed the hard-won savings of humble families, by thousands and tens\r\nof thousands, were nearly all chimerical, and some of them grotesque in\r\ntheir absurdity. Whether or not warming-pans and skates were actually\r\nexported to the tropics, it is certain that Scotch dairy-women emigrated\r\nto Buenos Ayres for the purpose of milking wild cows and churning butter\r\nfor people who preferred oil. The incredible multiplication of\r\nbubble-companies was facilitated by a marvellous cheapness of money,\r\nlargely due to an inordinate issue of notes by country bankers, and even\r\nby the Bank of England, in spite of the fact that gold and silver were\r\nknown to be leaving the country in vast quantities, especially in the\r\nshape of loans to France. The inevitable reaction came when the Bank of\r\nEngland contracted its issue of notes in order to arrest the drain of\r\ngold; goods recklessly bought up had to be sold at a fearful loss, bills\r\nupon which advances had been made proved to be of no value, and several\r\ngreat London banking houses stopped payment, bringing down in their fall\r\na much larger number of country banks dependent on them.\r\n\r\nIn the month of December, 1825, the crisis was at its height, and it is\r\nstated that within six or seven weeks after the failure of the banking\r\nfirm of Pole & Company on the 5th, sixty or seventy banks had broken.\r\nThe king's speech in July had congratulated parliament on increasing\r\nprosperity and had betrayed no misgivings about its stability. When the\r\ncrash came, however, the ministers showed no want of firmness or\r\nresource. They could not repair the consequences of national folly, but\r\nthey devoted themselves with intelligence to a restoration of credit.\r\nFor this purpose they suppressed at once the further issue of small\r\nnotes from country banks by a high-handed act of authority, for which\r\nthey admitted that an act of indemnity might be needed. At the same time\r\nthey rapidly increased the supply of small notes from the Bank of\r\nEngland, and of coin from the mint. Moreover, they induced the Bank of\r\nEngland to establish branches in a few provincial towns and to make\r\nadvances upon merchants' goods to the amount of three millions. It cost\r\na greater effort to break down the monopoly of the Bank of England by\r\nlegalising joint-stock banks in the provinces, though not within a\r\ndistance of sixty-five miles from London. Such practical expedients as\r\nthese, seconded by the good sense of the mercantile community, proved\r\nsufficient to avert a catastrophe only less disastrous than national\r\nbankruptcy. With the subsidence of alarm, the causes of alarm also\r\nsubsided, the recuperative powers of the country reasserted themselves,\r\nas during the great war, and the heart-breaking anxieties of 1825-26\r\nwere ignored, if not forgotten, in the political excitement of 1827.[73]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _ECONOMIC REFORM._]\r\n\r\nThe budgets of 1823-26 indeed mark a memorable advance in financial\r\nreform, which the commercial panic of 1825 scarcely interrupted. There\r\nhad been a reduction of the national debt by about £25,000,000. \"The\r\npoorer householders had been relieved from the pressure both of house\r\ntax and window tax. The manufacturing classes had been encouraged by\r\nthe reduction of the duties on silk, wool, and iron. The consuming\r\nclasses had been benefited by the reduction of duties on spirits, wines,\r\ncoffee, and sugar.\"[74] Owing to Huskisson's enlightened policy the old\r\nnavigation laws had been repealed upon the condition of reciprocity; the\r\ncombination laws had been liberally revised; various bounties had been\r\nabandoned on free trade principles, and the monstrous evils of smuggling\r\nhad been greatly abated. If the chancellor of the exchequer could show\r\nno surplus in 1826, he could at least boast that after so desperate a\r\ncrisis there was no deficit, and he had no reason to be ashamed of\r\nCobbett's nickname, \"Prosperity Robinson,\" which he owed to his\r\noptimism, largely founded upon facts. Before the close of the year 1826,\r\nhowever, this optimism received a rude shock. The agitation against the\r\ncorn laws assumed an acuter form than ever, and Huskisson prudently\r\ndeprecated it on the simple ground that no effective action could be\r\ntaken in an expiring parliament. Distress had recurred in the\r\nmanufacturing districts; mills and power-looms were again destroyed. The\r\nfree trade policy of Huskisson was vigorously attacked in parliament,\r\nbut it was successfully defended in powerful speeches by Canning as well\r\nas by himself. Ultimately the government, having obtained limited powers\r\nfrom parliament to admit foreign corn during the temporary emergency,\r\nhad the courage to exceed those powers and seek an indemnity from the\r\nnext parliament.\r\n\r\nThe dissolution of 1826, closing the life of one of the longest\r\nparliaments in modern times, was the prelude to a very eventful year.\r\nThe general election brought into prominence the two burning questions\r\nof catholic relief and the corn laws, and unseated for the moment\r\nBrougham, Cobbett, Hunt, and Lord John Russell, but it produced no\r\nmaterial change in the balance of parties. Little was done in the short\r\nautumn session, but when parliament met again early in February, 1827,\r\ngreat events had already cast their shadows before. The Duke of York,\r\nheir-presumptive to the crown, had died on January 5. He was known to be\r\na strong tory in politics, but, in spite of this, and of the scandals\r\nwhich attached to his name in earlier years, he enjoyed a considerable\r\nshare of popular confidence. Compared with his elder brother, he was\r\nrespected; he was a true Englishman, like his father, whom he resembled\r\nin character; his administration of the army had survived hostile\r\ncriticism, while a declaration which he had recently made against\r\ncatholic emancipation had produced a profound impression on public\r\nopinion. Much less was known of the Duke of Clarence, who stood next in\r\nsuccession. He had already injured himself in public estimation by\r\ndeclining the increased allowance offered him, and then claiming it with\r\narrears; nor did he now improve his position in the eyes of his future\r\nsubjects by stickling for a larger addition to it than parliament was\r\ndisposed to grant. But the Duke of York's death was followed by a far\r\nmore important incident. Liverpool was disabled by illness from\r\nattending his funeral, which, occurring in the depth of winter, proved\r\ndirectly fatal to one of those who were present, and seriously weakened\r\nthe constitutions of others, including Canning. On February 8, the first\r\nday of the session, Liverpool was in his place, though in broken health,\r\nand on the 17th he took a feeble part in the debate on the grant to the\r\nDuke of Clarence. On the following morning he was struck down by a\r\nparalytic seizure, and, though his life was prolonged for two years, he\r\nnever recovered the use of his faculties.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE CLOSE OF LIVERPOOL'S MINISTRY._]\r\n\r\nLiverpool's disappearance from the political scenes may be said to mark\r\nan epoch in the later history of England. Though only fifty-six years of\r\nage, he had been continuously in office for twenty years, and prime\r\nminister for fifteen, a tenure of power which none of his predecessors\r\nhad exceeded except Walpole and Pitt. His lot was cast in the most\r\ncritical period of the great war, and in the long night of adversity and\r\nanxiety which ushered in the \"thirty years' peace\". As foreign secretary\r\nhe conducted the negotiations for the peace of Amiens; as home secretary\r\nhe led the house of lords and was responsible for the government of\r\nIreland; as secretary for war and the colonies he gave Wellington a\r\nsteady, if not ardent, support in those apparently barren campaigns\r\nwhich strained the national patience; as prime minister he guided the\r\nship of state in all the difficulties of foreign and domestic affairs\r\nwhich arose between 1812 and 1827. Castlereagh may have been the most\r\ninfluential minister in the earlier years of his administration, and\r\nCanning in the later, but he was never the mere tool of either; on the\r\ncontrary, it Is certain that he was treated with respect and deference\r\nby all his numerous colleagues. In general capacity and debating power\r\nhe was inferior to few of them; in temper, judgment, and experience he\r\nwas superior to all.\r\n\r\nHe may be said to have lived and died without \"a policy,\" in so far as\r\nhe forebore to identify himself with any of the great questions then\r\npressing for solution. His real policy both at home and abroad was one\r\nof moderation and conciliation; he looked at party divisions almost with\r\nthe eyes of a permanent official who can work loyally with chiefs of\r\neither party; and he succeeded in keeping together in his cabinet\r\nambitious rivals who never would have co-operated under any other\r\nleader. This is not the road to fame, neither is it the course which men\r\nof imperious character like Castlereagh, or Canning, or Wellington, in\r\nhis place, would have adopted. But Canning and Wellington actually\r\nproved themselves incapable of winning the confidence which Liverpool so\r\nlong retained, and the whig government which followed them fell to\r\npieces in two years. Moderation in statesmanship does not always imply\r\nmediocrity of ability; and if Liverpool failed to see how many\r\ninstitutions needed radical amendment, he was not so blind as some of\r\nhis more celebrated associates. Not only was he more liberal in his\r\nviews than Eldon and Castlereagh, but he was less opposed to free trade\r\nthan most of his cabinet, to parliamentary reform than Canning, and to\r\ncatholic emancipation than Wellington or Peel. His fault was that he did\r\nnot act upon his own inward convictions with sufficient promptitude, or\r\nassert his own authority with sufficient energy. Had he done so, the\r\nbeneficial measures of the last years of his administration might have\r\nbeen anticipated, and the country might have been spared much of the\r\nmisery which darkened the close of George III.'s reign.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[68] Lord Londonderry in Twiss, _Life of Eldon_, ii., 432.\r\n\r\n[69] Harriet Martineau, _History of England During the Thirty Years'\r\nPeace_, i., 274.\r\n\r\n[70] _Letters to Copleston_, p. 295.\r\n\r\n[71] Cunningham, _Growth of English Industry and Commerce in Modern\r\nTimes_ (edit. 1903), pp. 756-59.

An insurrection broke out in Spain on January 1, and on March 9\r\nthe king was forced to swear fidelity to the obsolete constitution of\r\n1812. The result was to plunge the country into disorder, as both the\r\nclerical party and the extreme revolutionists refused to accept the\r\nconstitution. Meanwhile the assassination by a working man of the Duke\r\nof Berry, who died on February 14, 1820, had occasioned a new royalist\r\nreaction in France, and had increased the general fear of the\r\nrevolutionary party. The Bourbon succession had seemed to depend on his\r\nlife, for his son, the Count of Chambord, was posthumous. On receiving\r\nthe news of the Spanish revolution the tsar, already tiring of his\r\nliberal enthusiasm, fell back on his scheme for exercising paternal\r\ndiscipline over Europe. He proposed in April that the ambassadors at\r\nParis should issue a joint remonstrance requiring the Spanish cortes to\r\ndisavow the revolution, and to enact severe laws against sedition.\r\nFailing this, he proposed joint intervention, and offered for his own\r\npart to send an army of 15,000 men through North Italy and southern\r\nFrance to co-operate in the suppression of the revolution. To this\r\nCastlereagh replied that England would never consent to a joint\r\nintervention in Spain. Metternich was too much displeased with the\r\nRussian encouragement of secret societies in Italy to wish to see\r\nRussian troops in that country, and both Castlereagh and Metternich\r\nwished to keep Spain free from French influence. In the face of this\r\nopposition Russia could not, and France would not, do anything, and all\r\nthought of intervention was postponed. It was the last time that\r\nCastlereagh was able to assert the principle of non-intervention\r\nwithout breaking up the European concert.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _REVOLUTIONS IN SOUTHERN EUROPE._]\r\n\r\nJuly and August saw three new revolutions. A rebellion at Nola on July 2\r\nended in King Ferdinand of the Two Sicilies taking the oath on the 13th\r\nto the Spanish constitution, then regarded as a model by the liberals of\r\nSouthern Europe. But the grant of a constitution to Naples suggested a\r\ndemand for independence at Palermo. On July 17-18 that city rose in\r\nrevolt and was only subdued by the Neapolitans in the beginning of\r\nOctober. Portugal, too, was in a disturbed state. The royal family had\r\nbeen absent for nearly thirteen years, and the country had for five\r\nyears been governed by Lord, afterwards Viscount, Beresford as marshal\r\nand commander of the Portuguese army. In April, 1820, he sailed for\r\nBrazil, intending to induce the king, John VI., to return. During his\r\nabsence a revolution took place at Oporto on August 24, a provisional\r\ngovernment was established, and all British officers were dismissed.\r\nThis was followed by a similar revolution at Lisbon on September 15.\r\nBeresford on his return was forbidden to land, and retired to England.\r\nOn November 11, the Spanish constitution was proclaimed in Portugal, but\r\nsix days later another proclamation left the question of determining the\r\nconstitution to the cortes which were to be elected on a popular\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nThe Neapolitan revolution raised at once the question of intervention.\r\nIn this case Castlereagh held that Austria had a right to interfere,\r\nbecause her position as an Italian power was endangered by the\r\nrevolution, and because the revolution was a breach of the secret treaty\r\nof 1815 which had received the sanction of the British government. He\r\nstill objected to any joint interference and was opposed to the\r\nreference of the question to a congress. Austria could not have\r\ninterfered alone without offending the tsar, who clung to the principle\r\nof joint action. The question of intervention was therefore postponed\r\nfor the present. France, however, being jealous of Austrian influence in\r\nItaly, demanded the meeting of a congress, and such a meeting was\r\naccordingly held at Troppau on October 20. To this congress Austria,\r\nFrance, Prussia, and Russia sent plenipotentiaries. Great Britain\r\ncarried her opposition to joint interference so far as to refuse to join\r\nin the deliberations, though Sir Charles, now Lord, Stewart was sent to\r\nTroppau to watch the proceedings. Metternich, on finding that he could\r\nnot avoid the meeting of a congress, determined to lead its proceedings,\r\nand, before it met, drew up a memorandum defining his own views about\r\nintervention. These views were accepted at the congress by Prussia and\r\nRussia as well as by Austria; and a protocol was issued by the three\r\npowers declaring that a state in which a revolution should occur was\r\ndangerous to other states, and ceased to be a member of the European\r\nalliance, until it could give guarantees for its future stability. If\r\nsuch a revolution placed other states in immediate danger, the allied\r\npowers were bound to intervene by peaceful means, if possible, or if\r\nneed were, by arms. Before parting, the congress invited Ferdinand of\r\nthe Two Sicilies to attend an adjourned meeting, to assemble early in\r\nthe following year at Laibach.[75] Against these decisions Castlereagh\r\nprotested in vigorous terms, and more especially against any possible\r\napplication of the principle of intervention to England; France under\r\nthe Duke of Richelieu joined in neither the protocol nor the protest.\r\nThe liberal tendencies of the tsar had been quenched by recent events,\r\nso that, instead of a concert of Europe, there was left only a concert\r\nof absolute monarchs.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _AUSTRIAN INTERVENTION._]\r\n\r\nIn January, 1821, the sovereigns of Austria, Prussia, and Russia met the\r\nKing of the Two Sicilies at Laibach. France had vainly attempted to\r\nmediate between the King of the Two Sicilies and his people. But the\r\nNeapolitans were not satisfied with any vague promise of a constitution,\r\nand before allowing their king to depart for Laibach, held him pledged\r\nto the observance of an impossible condition, the maintenance of the\r\nSpanish constitution of 1812. The king's oath to preserve this\r\nparticularly objectionable constitution was regarded by Austria as\r\nsufficient to preclude negotiation, and it was resolved that she should\r\nrestore him by force as an absolute monarch, and should occupy the\r\nNeapolitan territory. The duration of this occupation was reserved as a\r\nquestion to be discussed at the next European congress, which it was\r\nintended to hold at Florence in the autumn of the next year. After a\r\nshow of resistance at Rieti the Neapolitans submitted, and the Austrian\r\narmy entered Naples on March 24. The restoration of absolute government\r\nwas accompanied by severities towards the constitutionalists, but\r\nAustria would not allow any repetition of the bloodshed of 1799.\r\n\r\nWhile the Austrian army was marching southwards, a new revolution broke\r\nout in Piedmont. The Spanish constitution was proclaimed at Alessandria\r\non March 10, and at Turin on the 12th. On the 13th, Victor Emmanuel I.,\r\nKing of Sardinia, abdicated, appointing as regent his distant cousin\r\nPrince Charles Albert of Carignano, who had been in communication with\r\nthe revolutionary party. The regent immediately accepted the Spanish\r\nconstitution on condition of the maintenance of the line of succession\r\nand of the Roman catholic religion. The new king, Charles Felix, was at\r\nModena when the revolt occurred. He refused to acknowledge the new\r\nconstitution, and ordered Charles Albert to betake himself to Novara,\r\nwhere the royalist troops were collecting. On the night of the 21st,\r\nCharles Albert fled from Turin to Novara, but the constitutional party\r\ndid not submit without a struggle. On April 8 the Austrians crossed the\r\nfrontier and, uniting with the royalists, defeated the constitutionalists\r\nat Novara. Two days later the royalist army entered Turin. The two\r\nItalian revolutions had thus ended in an Austrian occupation of the two\r\nlargest Italian states which were not ruled by members of the imperial\r\nhouse. The Papal States were now the only Italian principality of any\r\nsize which was not dominated by Austria.\r\n\r\nSo far Austria had been sufficiently powerful in the congresses of the\r\npowers to be able to prevent interference with other states where it was\r\nnot to her interest, and to incline the balance in favour of it where\r\nintervention would strengthen her. The reopening of the Eastern question\r\nmade her ascendency more difficult to maintain. The congress of Laibach\r\nhad been closed, but the sovereigns had not yet departed, when the news\r\narrived that a revolt, engineered by Greeks with the pretence of Russian\r\nsupport, had broken out against the Turks in Moldavia and Wallachia.\r\nRussia at once agreed with Austria that the principle laid down at\r\nTroppau applied to this revolt; the insurrectionary leaders were\r\ndisowned by Russia, and by the end of June Turkish authority was\r\nrestored in the Danubian principalities. So far the action of Russia had\r\nmet with the approval not only of Austria but of Great Britain, and\r\nCastlereagh had written to Alexander urging him not to join the Greek\r\ncause, which appeared to him to be part of an universal revolutionary\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nEarly in April, however, a more serious insurrection broke out in the\r\nMorea, and was followed a few weeks later by one in Central Greece. The\r\nwar was disgraced from the first by inhuman massacres on both sides. The\r\nGreek patriarch at Constantinople together with three archbishops was\r\nexecuted by the Turks on Easter Sunday, April 22. A great ferment in\r\nRussia was the result, where the people were anxious to assist their\r\nco-religionists and to avenge the death of the patriarch, whom they\r\nregarded as a martyr. The grievances of the Orthodox religion were\r\nseconded by the proper grievances of Russia. Greek ships, sailing under\r\nthe Russian flag, had been seized in the Dardanelles; the principalities\r\nof Moldavia and Wallachia had not been evacuated by the Turkish troops\r\nas was required by treaty, while an ancient treaty rendered it possible\r\nto regard the wrongs of the Greek Church as the political wrongs of\r\nRussia. A Russian ultimatum was despatched on June 28; and, while\r\nawaiting a reply, Russia consulted the other powers as to the course\r\nthey would pursue in the event of war breaking out between Russia and\r\nTurkey, and the system with which they would propose to replace the\r\nTurkish domination if it came to be destroyed. The principle of joint\r\nintervention, adopted at Troppau, seemed to require the powers to give\r\ntheir support to Russia. Great Britain and Austria, however, refused to\r\ntreat war with Turkey as a possibility. The Greek revolt seemed to them\r\nto express the principle of revolution, and the tsar himself became\r\ninclined to take this view of the situation when the Greeks established\r\nan advanced republican form of government. They accordingly\r\ndistinguished between the treaty rights of Russia, which the four powers\r\nwould urge Turkey to respect, and the provision of a more secure state\r\nof order in Turkey, which would be discussed at a European congress. The\r\nRussian ambassador had been withdrawn from Constantinople on August 8,\r\nand the negotiation was conducted mainly by Lord Strangford, the British\r\nambassador at Constantinople, who was supported by Austria, France, and\r\nPrussia. He succeeded in inducing Turkey to evacuate the principalities\r\nand to open the Dardanelles to ships of all nations, but Turkish\r\nobstinacy deferred the conclusion of a treaty.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE SPANISH QUESTION._]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Spanish question became more critical. As time went on\r\nSpain grew less instead of more settled, while the ultra-royalist party\r\ngained strength in France. To them the position to which the Bourbon\r\nKing of Spain had been reduced seemed at once an insult and a menace to\r\nFrance. The establishment of Austrian supremacy in Italy made them long\r\nfor French supremacy in Spain. In August, 1821, the presence of yellow\r\nfever in Spain was made the occasion for establishing a body of troops,\r\nprofessing to act as a sanitary cordon, upon the frontier. They were\r\nretained there when the fever had disappeared, and their numbers were\r\ngradually raised to 100,000. In December, 1821, an ultra-royalist\r\nministry entered on office in France under the leadership of Villèle.\r\nVillèle, like King Louis XVIII., was opposed to war, but he might easily\r\nbe forced to adopt the war policy which was popular with his party.\r\nFresh evidence was given of the contagious nature of the Spanish\r\nrevolution by the adoption, on the 27th of the preceding June, by the\r\nPortuguese cortes, of a constitution modelled on that of Spain. Six days\r\nlater the Portuguese king arrived at Lisbon and was induced to sign the\r\nnew constitution. This event was the more significant in the eyes of the\r\npowers, because the proclamation of the constitution had been\r\naccompanied by an insult to the Austrian embassy.\r\n\r\nIf Spanish liberalism placed Spain in danger of a war with France, Spain\r\nwas in equal danger of a war with Great Britain because she was not\r\nliberal enough. The revolution of 1820, instead of reconciling the\r\nrevolted colonies, had served as an example to the loyal colonies to\r\nseek their liberty. By the summer of 1822 Upper Peru was the only part\r\nof the American mainland where Spain held more than isolated posts; she\r\nhad been compelled to sell Florida to the United States, and San Domingo\r\nhad joined the revolted French colony of Hayti. The Spanish cortes,\r\nhowever, were even more resolute than the king had been to maintain the\r\nauthority of the mother country, and protested against the right which\r\nthe British had claimed and exercised of trading with the revolted\r\ncolonies. The disorderly state of these colonies encouraged the growth\r\nof piracy, which flourished even in the ports which still acknowledged\r\nthe supremacy of Spain. Special irritation was caused in 1822 by the\r\ncondemnation of the _Lord Collingwood_ for trading with Buenos Ayres, a\r\nplace over which Spain had exercised no authority for twelve years. In\r\nthe same year the new navigation acts greatly increased the facilities\r\nfor trading with Great Britain enjoyed by such places in America as\r\nadmitted British ships. In April, 1822, the United States recognised the\r\nindependence of Colombia, but Great Britain refrained as yet from\r\nrecognising any of the Spanish-American states, partly because of their\r\nunsettled condition and partly because the threat of recognition was a\r\nvaluable diplomatic counter in negotiations with Spain.\r\n\r\nInstead of a congress being held at Florence it was finally determined\r\nthat the Italian questions should be referred to a congress which was to\r\nmeet at Verona in September, 1822, and was to be preceded by a\r\nconference at Vienna on the Eastern question; there could, however, be\r\nlittle doubt that the Spanish question would also be raised.\r\nCastlereagh, or as we should now call him Lord Londonderry, would have\r\npreferred that Great Britain should stand aloof from the Spanish and\r\nItalian questions, but he desired that she should participate in the\r\ndiscussion of the Eastern question; it was accordingly arranged that he\r\nshould represent Great Britain at the conference of Vienna, and he had\r\nactually drawn up instructions in favour of non-intervention in Spain\r\nand of accrediting agents to some of the South American republics, when\r\nhis departure was prevented by his death on August 12. He was succeeded\r\nby Wellington as plenipotentiary, and by Canning as foreign secretary.\r\nThe change was, however, one of persons rather than of policies. Canning\r\nwas less conciliatory in manner, and had less sympathy with the\r\nprinciple of European congresses, but was prepared to carry on\r\nCastlereagh's policy on the questions which for the time being agitated\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE CONGRESS OF VERONA._]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish question was, as a fact, the one question which occupied the\r\nattention of the powers at Vienna and Verona. In consequence of the\r\nefforts of Strangford at Constantinople and his own growing\r\ndissatisfaction with the Greeks, the tsar was willing to allow the Greek\r\nquestion to drop; at the same time the kings of the Two Sicilies and\r\nSardinia themselves desired the continuance of Austrian occupation, and\r\nthus postponed the Italian question. As in 1820, Austria held the\r\nbalance between two rival policies. She had then thrown her weight on\r\nthe side of non-intervention, and, had the Spanish question stood by\r\nitself, she would probably have done so again. But in Metternich's\r\nopinion the Spanish question was of less importance than the Eastern,\r\nand it was important that the tsar should not doubt her loyalty to the\r\nprinciple on which she had persuaded him to refrain from an attack upon\r\nthe Porte.\r\n\r\nOn passing through Paris on his way to Vienna, Wellington found Villèle\r\ndesirous of avoiding war, but counting on it as a probability. He\r\narrived at Vienna too late for the actual conference, but in time to\r\nhave some conversation with Metternich and the tsar before leaving for\r\nVerona. So far it appeared that Montmorency, the more active of the\r\nFrench representatives, though professing to desire a peaceful\r\ntermination to the dispute between France and Spain, advocated French\r\nintervention, if intervention should be necessary, but was opposed to\r\nthe passage of foreign troops through France. Metternich and the tsar\r\ndistrusted French troops when brought face to face with revolutionists,\r\nand Metternich was therefore opposed to intervention, while the tsar\r\nstill desired to be allowed to march a Russian army on behalf of the\r\ncombined powers through Piedmont and southern France into Spain.\r\nMetternich of course did not wish to see any Russian troops to dispute\r\nAustria's supremacy in Italy. But all three desired the suppression of\r\nthe Spanish constitution, if they could find a trustworthy instrument.\r\nWellington adhered to Castlereagh's policy of non-intervention.[76]\r\n\r\nWhen the congress opened at Verona on October 20, Montmorency proposed\r\nthree skilfully drawn questions. Avoiding the direct discussion of\r\nhostilities, he asked whether, if France were compelled to withdraw her\r\nambassador from Madrid, the other powers would do the same. Then,\r\nassuming their sympathy, he asked what form of moral support they would\r\ngive her in event of war. Lastly, he propitiated Russian views of joint\r\naction by asking what form of material support the powers would give\r\nFrance, if she should require it. Wellington refused to consider\r\nhypothetical cases, but the sovereigns of Austria, Prussia, and Russia\r\nanswered the first question in the affirmative, and assured France of\r\ntheir moral, and, if necessary, of their material support. So far no\r\npower had abandoned its original attitude, but the promises had been\r\ngiven in a form which lent itself best to the sole interference of\r\nFrance, as the representative of the congress. Metternich now advocated\r\nBritish mediation, but this was refused by Montmorency on the ground of\r\nthe differences between the policy adopted by Great Britain and that\r\nadopted by the other powers. It was then agreed that Austria, France,\r\nPrussia, and Russia should address notes of the same tenor to their\r\nambassadors at Madrid, who should make corresponding representations to\r\nthe Spanish government, and a _procès verbal_ was concluded between\r\nthese four powers defining the causes which would justify the recall of\r\ntheir ambassadors.\r\n\r\nAs the French king was not present at Verona, the sending of the French\r\nnote was made conditional on the approval of the French government. The\r\noccupation of Spain by foreign troops was to be discussed when the King\r\nof Spain should have been restored to liberty. The tenor of the notes\r\nagreed on seemed to Wellington more likely to inflame the Spanish\r\ngovernment than to win concessions, and he lost no time in informing\r\nVillèle through Sir Charles Stuart, the British ambassador at Paris, of\r\nthe course of negotiations.[77] Although Wellington had been assured at\r\nVerona that Villèle's decision would not affect the transmission of\r\nnotes from the other courts, he hoped and Canning believed that it was\r\nstill in the power of Villèle to arrest the machinery that Montmorency,\r\nhis representative at Verona, had set in motion. On November 30\r\nWellington left Verona, but the emperors remained. On December 5 Villèle\r\nsent a message to Verona proposing to postpone sending the despatches\r\ntill an occasion for breaking off diplomatic relations as defined in the\r\n_procès verbal_ should arise, and suggesting that the ambassadors at\r\nParis should determine when such an occasion had occurred. This proposal\r\nwas rejected. It was inconsistent with Russia's desire for war, while\r\nAustria was anxious to please Russia in the west, so long as she\r\nremained pacific in the east. The three eastern powers therefore\r\nresolved that they would only delay sending their notes till the French\r\nnote was ready.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE SPANISH QUESTION._]\r\n\r\nWhile this negotiation was pending, Wellington arrived at Paris, where,\r\nunder strong pressure from Canning,[78] he renewed his offer of\r\nmediation with Spain. It was declined. On the arrival of the reply from\r\nVerona, Wellington was informed that even if the other powers sent their\r\ndespatches to Madrid, France would withhold hers. In the end, Villèle\r\ndismissed Montmorency for the independent line he had taken, and sent a\r\nmilder note than the three eastern powers, but withdrew his ambassador\r\nfrom Madrid soon after the other ambassadors had departed. Great Britain\r\nwas in consequence the only great power which still continued diplomatic\r\nrelations with Spain at the end of January, 1823. In the course of the\r\nnegotiations two curious suspicions had occurred to Canning and Villèle\r\nrespectively. Canning imagined that France would employ the threats of\r\nher allies as a show of force to compel Spain to join her in an attack\r\non British commerce in the West Indies, while Villèle suspected that the\r\nBritish defence of the political independence of Spain was to be\r\nrecompensed by the cession of some Spanish colonies in America.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the war party before which Villèle had had to bow, was having\r\nits own way in France. On January 28 Louis XVIII. in opening the\r\nchambers announced the withdrawal of his ambassador, and declared that\r\n100,000 Frenchmen were ready to march to preserve the throne of Spain to\r\na descendant of Henry IV., and to reconcile that country with Europe.\r\nThe sole object of any war that might arise would be to render Ferdinand\r\nVII. free to give his people institutions which they could not hold\r\nexcept from him, and which, by securing their tranquillity, would\r\ndissipate the unrest in France. Canning protested against the apparent\r\nimplication that no valid constitution could rest on any other basis\r\nthan that of France did, as also against the apparent claim to interfere\r\nin virtue of the family relation of the dynasties of France and Spain;\r\nbut he vainly endeavoured to persuade the Spanish government to come to\r\nsome agreement with its king. On March 31, when war seemed imminent,\r\nCanning despatched a note to Paris defining the limits of British\r\nneutrality. The independence of Spain and integrity of its dominions\r\nwere to be recognised; it was not to be permanently occupied by a\r\nmilitary force, and France was not to attempt to gain either by conquest\r\nor by cession any of the revolted colonies of Spain in America. At the\r\nsame time he disclaimed any intention of acquiring any of those colonies\r\nfor Great Britain.[79]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _PORTUGAL AND BRAZIL._]\r\n\r\nWar between France and Spain began with the passage of the frontier by\r\nthe Duke of Angoulême on April 7. On May 23 he entered Madrid. On\r\nOctober 1 the Spanish constitutionalists were compelled to set their\r\nking at liberty to join the French, and on November 1 the war was\r\nterminated by the surrender of Barcelona to the royalists. The\r\nrestoration of Ferdinand VII. to absolute power was followed by a\r\nfurious and vindictive reaction, which Angoulême strove in vain to\r\nmoderate. For the next five years French troops occupied the country,\r\nbut Angoulême showed his disapproval of the method of government by\r\nrefusing the decorations offered him by Ferdinand. The restoration of\r\nabsolutism in Spain led to events in Portugal which forced Great Britain\r\nto intervene and strengthened the difference between her policy and that\r\nof the continental powers. The new Portuguese constitution was\r\nunpopular, especially in the army, and as early as February, 1823, there\r\nwas a revolt against the constitution, but order was restored in April.\r\nOn May 26 another absolutist revolt broke out, and the rebels were\r\njoined next day by the king's second son, Dom Miguel, then twenty years\r\nof age; on the 29th the revolt spread to Lisbon; on the 31st the king\r\npromised a revised constitution, and on June 2 the cortes ceased to sit.\r\nThe government resolved itself into an absolute monarchy, which\r\ncontinued till the following year, in spite of the appointment of a\r\njunta under the presidency of Palmella to draw up a new constitution.\r\nThe ambassadors of Austria, Prussia, and Russia opposed the granting of\r\na new constitution, and Dom Miguel still maintained a threatening\r\nattitude. Palmella accordingly applied to Great Britain for troops to\r\nsupport his government. This request created no little difficulty. It\r\nwas impossible for Great Britain to allow the government of Portugal to\r\nfall into the hands of a party resting for support on the absolutists\r\nin Spain and the French army, and it was equally impossible to employ\r\nBritish troops to maintain the cause of the King of Portugal against his\r\nultra-royalist subjects when Great Britain had protested so vigorously\r\nagainst the kings of Spain and the Two Sicilies receiving foreign\r\nassistance against their liberal subjects; there were moreover no troops\r\nthat could well be spared.\r\n\r\nCanning accordingly contented himself with despatching a naval squadron\r\nto the Tagus to act as a moral support to the king. As the event proved,\r\nthis squadron was sufficient to determine the course of events. At the\r\nsame time Canning refused to guarantee any constitution, though when\r\nFrance joined the eastern powers in threatening the proposed\r\nconstitution, he intimated his readiness to resist by force of arms any\r\nforeign intervention in Portugal. On April 30, 1824, Dom Miguel\r\nattempted another _coup d'état_, and was for nine days in possession of\r\nLisbon, where he made wholesale arrests of his political opponents. John\r\nVI. was, however, supported by all the foreign ambassadors, and on March\r\n9, by their advice, he went on board the British ship of war, _Windsor\r\nCastle_, where he summoned his son to appear before him. Dom Miguel\r\nthought it wisest to obey; the king sent him abroad, and the attempt at\r\na revolution was over for the present. The junta appointed in the\r\nprevious year to frame a constitution now reported in favour of a\r\nrevival of the ancient cortes, and this proposal was accepted by the\r\nking. The cortes were not, however, actually assembled; still, the mere\r\nfact of Dom Miguel's absence left the government a little stronger.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the relations between Portugal and Brazil occasioned\r\ndifficulties between the former country and Great Britain. On leaving\r\nBrazil, King John VI. had entrusted the government to his elder son,\r\nPeter, to whom he had given secret instructions to proclaim himself\r\nEmperor of Brazil in case he found it impossible to maintain the union\r\nbetween Brazil and the mother country. Acting on these instructions,\r\nPeter had proclaimed the independence of Brazil on October 12, 1822,\r\nadopting for himself the style of constitutional emperor. Next month\r\nLord Cochrane, who had been in the service of Chile, quitted it for that\r\nof Brazil. Neither party in Portugal was prepared for the separation of\r\nBrazil, and it was therefore opposed, but without much effect, by the\r\nhome government. By the end of 1823 Cochrane had captured all the\r\nPortuguese posts in Brazil, and in August, 1824, he suppressed a\r\nrepublican movement in the north of that country. On July 23 of the same\r\nyear Great Britain signed a commercial treaty with the new empire. This\r\nirritated the Portuguese government. Meanwhile, Beresford, who had\r\nreturned to Portugal in a private capacity, had been requested to resume\r\nthe command of the Portuguese army. This he refused to do so long as the\r\nCount of Subsérra, a French partisan, held office at home. There was a\r\ndifficulty in forming a ministry without him, and eventually Subsérra\r\nbecame virtual prime minister, and Beresford was excluded from office.\r\nIn order to obtain an excuse for the introduction of French troops into\r\nPortugal, Subsérra sent a request to Great Britain for a force of four\r\nor five thousand, knowing it would be refused. Great Britain's refusal\r\nhad not, however, the expected consequence, because the influence of the\r\nother powers at Lisbon was weakened by their anti-constitutional policy.\r\nIn July, 1825, the representatives of Austria, Brazil, Great Britain,\r\nand Portugal assembled at London to consider the relations of Portugal\r\nand Brazil. While the conference was sitting it was discovered that\r\nSubsérra was carrying on separate negotiations with Brazil. Canning was\r\nnow able to obtain his dismissal, which was followed by the recall of\r\nthe French ambassador, De Neuville, who had been the principal opponent\r\nof British influence at Lisbon. As a result of this conference the\r\nPortuguese government on August 29 recognised the independence of\r\nBrazil.[80]\r\n\r\nThe restoration of absolute government in Spain revived the question of\r\nSpanish America. Ferdinand VII., on recovering his authority, proposed a\r\ncongress at Paris for the consideration of South American affairs.\r\nCanning, however, declined his invitation, and it was thought useless to\r\nhold a congress without the participation of Great Britain. The position\r\nin which Great Britain had been placed by the negotiations of Verona, as\r\ndiplomatic champion of Spain, had caused her to suspend her complaints\r\nabout the treatment of her merchant vessels trading with the revolted\r\ncolonies; but disorder continued, and on one occasion the British\r\nadmiral was authorised to land in Cuba to extirpate the pirates using\r\nthe Spanish flag. Canning was determined that French force should not be\r\nemployed to reduce the revolted colonies, and in October, 1823, he\r\ninformed the French ambassador, Polignac, that he would acknowledge the\r\nindependence of those colonies if France assisted Spain in her attempts\r\nto reduce them[81]--a somewhat empty threat, as the commercial interests\r\nof Great Britain would have compelled him to acknowledge them in any\r\ncase as soon as there should be settled governments in existence with\r\nwhich he could treat. Diplomatic agents were in fact appointed in most\r\nof the revolted colonies before the end of this year.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE MONROE DOCTRINE._]\r\n\r\nWhat, however, rendered French interference hopeless was the attitude of\r\nthe United States, as expressed in President Monroe's historic message\r\nto congress on December 2, 1823. In this message occur the words, since\r\nknown as the Monroe doctrine: \"With the governments who have declared\r\ntheir independence, and maintained it, and whose independence we have,\r\non great consideration, and on just principles, acknowledged, we could\r\nnot view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or\r\ncontrolling in any other manner their destiny, by any European power, in\r\nany other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition\r\ntowards the United States.\" After this the recognition of the\r\nindependence of the Spanish colonies was only a matter of time.[82]\r\nGreat Britain recognised the independence of Buenos Ayres, Colombia, and\r\nMexico, in 1824, and the rest soon after. In spite of the temporary\r\nsuccesses of Canterac, Peru, the last of the mainland provinces, was\r\nlost to Spain in 1825, and the other European powers did not now delay\r\ntheir recognition of the American republics. In April of that year\r\nFrance recognised the virtual independence of her own revolted colony of\r\nHayti.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern question advanced more slowly. On March 25, 1823, Canning\r\nrecognised the Greeks as belligerents. After this step Great Britain\r\nenjoyed the advantage of being able to hold the Greek government\r\nresponsible for piracy committed by Greek ships; but, coming as it did\r\nafter the isolated action of Great Britain at Verona, it created a\r\nsuspicion among the eastern powers of a desire to effect a settlement\r\nof the Eastern question without the co-operation of other states. In\r\nOctober, 1823, the Tsar Alexander and the Emperor Francis had a meeting\r\nat Czernowitz in Bukowina. Here they discussed joint intervention in\r\nGreece as a means of forestalling the isolated intervention of Great\r\nBritain. During the meeting the news arrived of the Turkish concessions\r\nto the Russian demands of 1821. Before the conference broke up, the tsar\r\ninformally suggested a conference at St. Petersburg to arrange joint\r\nintervention on the basis of the erection of three principalities under\r\nTurkish suzerainty in Greece and the Ægean. In January, 1824, the same\r\nproposal was made formally in a Russian circular addressed to the great\r\npowers. Metternich and Canning both opposed the scheme, thinking that\r\nthe principalities would fall under Russian influence.\r\n\r\nMetternich met it by a counter proposal for the complete independence of\r\nGreece. Canning preferred to adopt neither course, and to watch the\r\nsequence of events. In April, however, he consented that Great Britain\r\nshould be represented at the conference at St. Petersburg on condition\r\nthat no coercion should be applied to Turkey, and that diplomatic\r\nrelations should have been previously restored between Russia and\r\nTurkey; in August the Greek government sent to London its protest\r\nagainst the Russian proposals, and in November Canning, finding that\r\nneither Greeks nor Turks would accept the decision of the conference,\r\nand being still opposed to violent interference, refused to take part in\r\nit. At the same time he offered British mediation to the Greeks in case\r\nit should be absolutely necessary. Early in 1825 Metternich induced\r\nCharles X., the new King of France, to support his proposal. Russia,\r\nhowever, would not hear of the independence of Greece, which might mean\r\nthe creation of a rival to her influence in the Turkish dominions. The\r\nconference therefore merely resolved that the Porte should grant\r\nsatisfaction to its subjects, failing which the powers offered their\r\nmediation.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE DEATH OF ALEXANDER I._]\r\n\r\nTurkey refused the offer. She was in fact busily engaged in restoring\r\norder in her own way. In February, 1825, an Egyptian army was landed in\r\nthe Morea, and met with rapid successes of such a nature as to arouse a\r\nsuspicion that it was the fixed policy of its commander, Ibrahim, the\r\nadopted son of Mehemet Ali, Pasha of Egypt, to depopulate the Morea.\r\nHis advance upon Nauplia was checked by an order of the British\r\ncommodore, Hamilton, and he retired towards Tripolitza and Navarino. The\r\nTurkish successes induced Canning to make proposals to Russia through\r\nSir Stratford Canning, the British ambassador at St. Petersburg, for a\r\njoint intervention of the powers on condition that there should be no\r\ncoercion of Turkey. The tsar refused to accept the condition and made\r\npreparations for war. Canning meanwhile declined an offer of the Greek\r\ngovernment to place itself under British protection, and on August 18\r\nAlexander declared that he would solve the Eastern question by himself.\r\nHe then set out for the south of Russia, where his army had collected.\r\nCanning now dropped his scheme of an united intervention and opened\r\nnegotiations for a separate intervention on the part of Great Britain\r\nand Russia alone. Meanwhile he informed the Greek government that he\r\nwould allow no power to effect a settlement without British\r\nco-operation, and that if Russia invaded Turkey he would land troops in\r\nGreece. The negotiations with Russia were proceeding favourably when\r\nthey were interrupted by the death of Alexander on December 1.\r\n\r\nOne event of the year 1825 which attracted little attention at the time\r\nwas destined to be a cause of friction at a much later date. In 1824 the\r\nboundary between British America and the United States had been\r\npartially delimited, and this was followed early in the following year\r\nby a treaty, which attempted to settle the boundary between British and\r\nRussian America. Unfortunately the words used in this treaty were\r\nsomewhat indefinite, and, although no difficulty was experienced for two\r\ngenerations, the discovery of gold in the north-west of America\r\nsubsequently led to a bitter dispute between Canada on the one side and\r\nthe United States, which had acquired the rights of Russia, on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[75] Metternich, _Memoirs_, § 484, English translation, iii., 446.\r\n\r\n[76] Wellington, _Despatches, etc._, i., 343-48.\r\n\r\n[77] Wellington, _Despatches, etc._, i., 518-23.

One section,\r\nrepresented by Canning, advocated catholic emancipation, encouraged the\r\npractical application of free trade doctrines, and was prepared to\r\nsupport the principle of national independence, not only in South\r\nAmerica, but in Greece and Portugal. This section was dominant in the\r\nhouse of commons. The other section, led by Wellington and Peel, which\r\nwas dominant in the house of lords, was strictly conservative on all\r\nthese questions, though Peel was beginning to show an open mind on one,\r\nat least, of them. The king's known distrust of Canning, largely shared\r\nby his own party, naturally suggested the hope of rallying it under the\r\nleadership of some politician with the moderate and conciliatory temper\r\nof Lord Liverpool. But no such politician could be found, nor was there\r\nany prospect of Canning accepting a subordinate position in a new\r\nministry. For nearly six weeks the premiership was in abeyance, while\r\nLiverpool's recovery was treated as a possible event. Canning himself\r\nwas in broken health, but, ill as he was, he proposed and carried in the\r\nhouse of commons a sliding scale of import duties upon corn, variable\r\nwith its market price. He also made a fierce attack on Sir John Copley,\r\nthen master of the rolls, who had vigorously opposed a motion of Burdett\r\nfor catholic relief. At last the king, having consulted others, made up\r\nhis mind to send for Canning, who had been suffering from a relapse. It\r\nwas in vain that Canning advised him, unless he were prepared for\r\nconcession on the catholic question, to summon a body of ministers\r\nsharing his own convictions. There was, in fact, no alternative to\r\nCanning's succession, except that of Wellington or Peel. The former\r\ndeclared that he would be worse than mad to accept the premiership; the\r\nlatter was still young for the office and deprecated as hopeless the\r\nformation of any exclusively \"protestant\" cabinet. The selection of\r\nCanning became inevitable, and on April 10 the king determined upon it,\r\nirritated by what he regarded as an attempt to force his hand in the\r\nchoice of a minister.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _CANNING ACCEPTS OFFICE._]\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, during the short remainder of his life Canning had to\r\nundergo the same bitter experience as Pitt in 1804, and to suffer a\r\ncruel retribution for his aggressive petulance. All his strongest\r\ncolleagues, except Huskisson, deserted him. The resignation of Lord\r\nEldon, since 1821 Earl of Eldon, must have been expected, terminating,\r\nas it did, the longest chancellorship since the Norman conquest. But\r\nCanning seems to have really hoped that he might secure the support of\r\nWellington by the assurance of his desire to carry out the principles of\r\nLiverpool's government. The duke, however, repelled his overtures with\r\nsomething less than courtesy, and even retired from the command of the\r\narmy. Peel had already intimated privately that a transfer of the\r\npremiership from an opponent to a champion of emancipation would make it\r\nimpossible for him to retain office. Three peers, Bathurst, Melville,\r\nand Westmorland, followed his example. Canning had no resource but to\r\nenlist colleagues from the ranks of the whigs. In this he was at first\r\nunsuccessful. Sturges Bourne was appointed to the home office, Viscount\r\nDudley became foreign secretary, and Robinson, who was raised to the\r\npeerage as Viscount Goderich, became secretary for war and the colonies.\r\nCanning himself united the offices of first lord of the treasury and\r\nchancellor of the exchequer. The Duke of Portland became lord privy\r\nseal. Palmerston, the secretary at war, was given a seat in the cabinet.\r\nHarrowby, Huskisson, Wynn, and Bexley, retained their former posts, and\r\nSidmouth, hitherto an unofficial member of the cabinet, finally retired.\r\nOne important office outside the cabinet, that of chief secretary for\r\nIreland, was given to a whig, William Lamb, afterwards Lord Melbourne.\r\nIt was a happy idea to make the Duke of Clarence lord high admiral\r\nwithout a seat in the cabinet, and without any power of acting\r\nindependently of his council, while Copley (as Lord Lyndhurst) proved a\r\ngood successor to Eldon.\r\n\r\nIn May some of the whigs were induced to join the ministry. Tierney\r\nentered the cabinet as master of the mint and the Earl of Carlisle as\r\nfirst commissioner of woods and forests. The Marquis of Lansdowne, the\r\nformer Lord Henry Petty, joined the cabinet without taking office. Other\r\nminor posts were assigned to whigs, and several whig chiefs, such as\r\nHolland and Brougham, while they remained outside the government,\r\ntendered it a friendly support. In July Lansdowne became home secretary,\r\nBourne was transferred to the woods and forests department, Carlisle\r\nbecame lord privy seal, and Portland remained in the cabinet without\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe new cabinet was therefore still in an unsettled state when it met\r\nparliament at the beginning of May. It there encountered a storm of\r\nunsparing criticism even in the house of commons, but still more in the\r\nhouse of lords. Lord Stewart, who had succeeded his brother as Marquis\r\nof Londonderry, and the Duke of Newcastle denounced Canning in the most\r\nintemperate language; and the veteran whig, Lord Grey, who had not been\r\nconsulted, delivered an elaborate oration against him not the less\r\nvirulent because it was carefully studied and measured. This attack was\r\nso keenly felt by Canning that he was supposed to meditate the\r\nacceptance of a peerage, that he might reply to it in person. The climax\r\nof his vexations was reached when a corn bill, prepared by the late\r\ncabinet, and passed by the house of commons, was finally wrecked in the\r\nhouse of lords through an amendment introduced by Wellington. There was\r\nsome excuse for the duke's action in letters which had passed between\r\nhim and Huskisson, but Canning naturally resented his mischievous\r\ninterposition, and unwisely declared that he must \"have been made an\r\ninstrument in the hands of others\". So ended the session on July 2,\r\namidst discords and divisions which boded ill for the future, but threw\r\na retrospective light on the rare merits of Liverpool.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE DEATH OF CANNING._]\r\n\r\nThe days of Canning were already numbered. Before the end of July he was\r\nunable to attend a council, and retired for rest to the Duke of\r\nDevonshire's villa at Chiswick. As in the case of Castlereagh, the king\r\nhad noticed the symptoms of serious illness, and on August 5 the public\r\nwas informed of his danger. On the 8th he died of internal inflammation\r\nin the room which had witnessed the death of Fox. His loss was deeply\r\nfelt, not only by the king who never showed him confidence, but also by\r\nthe best part of the nation, and his funeral was attended by a great\r\nconcourse of mourners, both whigs and tories. No one doubted that he was\r\na patriot, and his noble gifts commanded the admiration of his bitterest\r\nopponents. He belonged to an age of transition, and it must ever be\r\ndeplored that he missed the opportunity of showing whether his mind was\r\ncapable of further growth in the highest office of state; for the\r\ninconsistencies of his opinions, obstinately maintained for years, would\r\nhave demanded many changes of conviction or policy. He was as stout an\r\nenemy of reform at home as he was a resolute friend of constitutional\r\nliberty abroad. He detested the system of repression consecrated by the\r\nholy alliance, but he defended the necessity of such measures as the six\r\nacts and arbitrary imprisonment for a limited period. He never swerved\r\nin his advocacy of Roman catholic relief, but he was unmoved by\r\narguments in favour of repealing the test and corporation acts.\r\nProbably, at the head of a coalition, embracing the ablest of the\r\nmoderate tories and reformers, and loyally supported by his colleagues,\r\nhe might have proved the foremost British statesman of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. But it is more than doubtful whether his proud and sensitive\r\nnature would have enabled him so to cancel past memories as to\r\nconsolidate such a coalition, or to inspire such loyalty in its members.\r\n\r\nThe death of Canning involved for the moment far less political change\r\nthan might have been expected. The king at once sent for Sturges Bourne\r\nand Goderich, as the most intimate adherents of Canning. He then\r\ncommanded Goderich to form, or rather to continue, a ministry of\r\ncompromise, and this was done with little shifting of places. Wellington\r\nresumed the command of the army, thereby revealing his motive in giving\r\nit up so abruptly. But a very unwise choice was made in the appointment\r\nof John Charles Herries, rather than Palmerston, as chancellor of the\r\nexchequer, and it carried with it the seeds of an early disruption.\r\nPalmerston had originally been proposed for the office, but the king\r\nstrongly favoured Herries, though he showed good sense in deferring to\r\npublic opinion, and desiring Huskisson to take the post himself.\r\nUnfortunately, Huskisson preferred the colonial office, and, as neither\r\nSturges Bourne nor Tierney would accept the position, royal influence\r\nprevailed, and Herries found himself at the exchequer. Meanwhile\r\nPortland succeeded Harrowby as lord president, Charles Grant succeeded\r\nHuskisson at the board of trade, and Lord Uxbridge, who had been created\r\nMarquis of Anglesey after the battle of Waterloo, and who was now\r\nmaster-general of the ordnance, was given a seat in the cabinet.\r\n\r\nIn the course of November it was decided by Goderich, in concert with\r\nHuskisson and Tierney, that a finance committee should be appointed\r\nearly in the next session to consider the state of the revenue. Lord\r\nAlthorp, the son of Earl Spencer, was designated as chairman, and\r\nprovisionally undertook to act, but the chancellor of the exchequer,\r\nwho, contrary to all precedent, had not been taken into counsel,\r\nstrongly protested against the nomination, as soon as he was informed of\r\nit. Out of this dispute arose the ignoble fall of the Goderich\r\nadministration, though it was preceded by more serious dissensions on\r\nforeign policy. The king, whose activity revived with the increasing\r\nweakness of his ministers, committed himself, without asking their\r\nopinion, to a hearty approval of Codrington's action at Navarino, in\r\nwhich, as will be recorded hereafter, that admiral had co-operated in\r\nthe destruction of the Turkish navy, though the British government\r\nprofessed to be at peace with the Porte. The king was also adverse to a\r\nproposal for the admission of Holland and Wellesley into the cabinet.\r\nGoderich in consequence resigned, but had withdrawn his resignation when\r\nthe quarrel between Huskisson and Herries broke out afresh. Driven to\r\ndistraction by difficulties to which he was utterly unequal, Goderich\r\nonce more abandoned his post. The king gladly dispensed with his\r\nservices, and after some negotiation with Harrowby sent for Wellington\r\non January 9, 1828, giving him a free hand to invite any co-operation\r\nexcept that of Grey. It was stipulated, however, \"that the Roman\r\nCatholic question was not to be made a cabinet question,\" and that both\r\nthe lord chancellors, as well as the lord lieutenant of Ireland, were to\r\nbe \"protestants\".[83]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _WELLINGTON PRIME MINISTER._]\r\n\r\nIt must ever be regretted, for the sake of the country not less than of\r\nhis own fame, that Wellington undertook the premiership. He was beyond\r\nall dispute the greatest man in England, and exercised up to the end of\r\nhis life a more powerful influence in emergencies than any other\r\nsubject. But he had judged himself rightly when he declared that he was\r\nwholly unfit to be prime minister, and his administration was among the\r\nweakest of modern times. The firmness which had sustained him in so many\r\ncampaigns, the political sagacity which had enabled him to grapple with\r\nthe complications of Spanish affairs, and with the great settlement of\r\nEurope, equally failed him in party management and in the estimation of\r\npublic opinion at home. He understood better than any man how to deal\r\nwith the king, and overbore not only the king's own prejudices but the\r\nmachinations of the Duke of Cumberland with masterly resolution. He set\r\na good example in declining to regard himself as a mere party leader and\r\nin refusing to study the arts of popularity hunting, but he never\r\ngrasped the principle that constitutional government ultimately rests on\r\nthe will of the people. Still he was too good a general not to see when\r\nfacts were too strong for him. His chief manoeuvres on the field of\r\npolitics consisted in somewhat inglorious though not unskilful retreats;\r\nwhen he afterwards carried boldness to the point of rashness, he\r\nencountered a signal defeat. Nevertheless, while he utterly lost his\r\npolitical hold on the masses, and even the confidence of shrewd\r\npoliticians, he never ceased to retain the profound respect of his\r\ncountrymen, not only as the first of English generals, but as the most\r\nhonest of public servants.\r\n\r\nWellington naturally applied first to Peel, and, by his advice, attempted\r\na reconstruction of the Goderich cabinet, but with the addition of certain\r\nnew elements. Five of Canning's followers--Lyndhurst, Dudley, who had been\r\ncreated an earl, Huskisson, Grant, and Palmerston retained their old\r\noffices, and Palmerston gave an extraordinary proof of patience by\r\ncheerfully remaining secretary at war after eighteen years' service in\r\nthat capacity. These cabinet ministers were now joined or rejoined by Peel\r\nas home secretary, Earl Bathurst as lord president, Henry Goulburn as\r\nchancellor of the exchequer, Melville as president of the board of\r\ncontrol, Lord Aberdeen as chancellor of the duchy, and Lord Ellenborough,\r\nson of the former chief justice, as lord privy seal. Herries was\r\ntransferred from the exchequer to the mastership of the mint. Outside the\r\ncabinet Anglesey became lord lieutenant of Ireland, where Lamb remained\r\nchief secretary. It was understood that Eldon, now in his seventy-seventh\r\nyear, would have willingly accepted the presidency of the council, and\r\nfelt hurt that no offer or communication was made to him. On the other\r\nhand, the whigs were by no means satisfied, while the inclusion of\r\nHuskisson equally offended extreme tories and the widow of Canning, who\r\nspoke of him as having become an associate of her husband's murderers.\r\nThis association was not destined to be long lived. The formation of the\r\nministry was not completed until the end of January, and very soon after\r\nparliament met on the 29th of that month a rupture between Huskisson and\r\nWellington became imminent. For this Huskisson was mainly responsible.\r\nHaving to seek re-election at Liverpool, and irritated by the attacks made\r\nupon his consistency, he delivered a very imprudent speech, in which he\r\nimplied, if he did not state, that he had obtained from his chief pledges\r\nof adhesion to Canning's policy. Such a declaration from such a man was\r\ninevitably understood as applying at least to free trade and the conduct\r\nof foreign affairs. Both Huskisson and the duke in parliamentary speeches\r\ndisclaimed the imputation of any bargain; still the rift was not closed,\r\nand it was speedily widened by events on which harmony between tories and\r\nfriends of Canning was impossible.\r\n\r\nFor six years the so-called war of Greek independence had been carried\r\non with the utmost barbarity on both sides. The sympathies of Canning,\r\nas foreign secretary, had been entirely with the Greeks, as they had\r\nbeen with the South American insurgents, but he was equally on his guard\r\nagainst the armed \"mediation\" of Russia and her claim to be the supreme\r\nprotector of the Greek Christians. We have seen how at last, in 1825,\r\nhopeless discord between the great continental powers led to overtures\r\nfor the peaceful intervention of Great Britain, and how at this juncture\r\nthe Tsar Alexander died on December 1, 1825. Wellington, at Canning's\r\nrequest, undertook a special embassy to St. Petersburg for the\r\nostensible purpose of congratulating the new tsar, Nicholas, on his\r\naccession, and succeeded, during April, 1826, in concluding an\r\narrangement for joint action by Russia and Great Britain with a view to\r\nestablishing the autonomy of Greece under the sovereignty of Turkey.\r\nMeanwhile the impulsive enthusiasm which has so often seized the English\r\npeople on behalf of \"oppressed nationalities\" had been fanned into a\r\nflame by the cause of Greek independence. Byron had already sacrificed\r\nhis life to it in April, 1824; Cochrane now devoted to it an energy and\r\na naval reputation only second to Nelson's; volunteers joined the Greek\r\nlevies, and subscriptions came in freely. In the course of 1826 Canning\r\nsucceeded in procuring the adhesion of the French government to the\r\nAnglo-Russian agreement. Early in 1827 the three powers demanded an\r\narmistice from Turkey, and, on the refusal of the Porte, signed the\r\ntreaty of London for the settlement of the Greek question. This treaty,\r\ndated July 6, 1827, was almost the last public act of Canning. It was\r\nmoderate in its terms, embodying the conditions laid down in the\r\nprevious year at St. Petersburg, and making the self-government of\r\nGreece subject to a payment of tribute to the Porte. It provided for a\r\ncombination of the British, French, and Russian fleets in the event of a\r\nsecond refusal from Turkey; but Canning died in the hope that\r\nhostilities might be avoided.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _NAVARINO._]\r\n\r\nThis hope was not likely, nor was it destined, to be realised. The Porte\r\nremained inflexible, and would grant no armistice; indeed, it had\r\nsummoned a contingent of ships from Egypt, and a fleet of twenty-eight\r\nsail under Ibrahim Pasha was lying in the Bay of Navarino awaiting\r\nfurther reinforcements. Admiral Codrington, who commanded the allied\r\nfleet, now before Navarino, showed much forbearance. In concert with the\r\nFrench admiral, he warned Ibrahim Pasha not to leave the harbour, and\r\nobtained assurances which were speedily broken. Futile negotiations went\r\non during the early part of October, ending in a massacre among the\r\ninhabitants of the coast by the direction of Ibrahim. The admirals of\r\nthe allied fleet no longer hesitated. On the 20th the fleet entered the\r\nharbour. The first shots were fired by the Turco-Egyptian fleet, which\r\nwas skilfully ranged in three lines, and in the form of a horseshoe. An\r\naction ensued, which lasted four hours, and resulted in the almost\r\ncomplete destruction of the Ottoman armament. Had the allied fleet at\r\nonce proceeded to Constantinople, the Greek question might perhaps have\r\nbeen settled promptly, instead of being left to perplex cabinets for two\r\nyears longer.\r\n\r\nThe news of Navarino reached England when the ministry of Lord Goderich\r\nwas already tottering, and caused its members far more anxiety than\r\nsatisfaction. Probably the wisest of them foresaw that, unless\r\nimmediate action were taken, Russia would declare war single-handed\r\nagainst Turkey and enforce her own terms, but nothing in fact was done,\r\nand Wellington, on coming into power, found the question of our\r\nrelations with Turkey and Greece still open. In spite of his own share\r\nin bringing about the co-operation of Russia with Great Britain, he was\r\nby no means prepared for a crusade on behalf of Greek independence, or\r\nfor a definite rupture with Turkey. Hence the memorable phrases inserted\r\nin the king's speech of January 29, 1828, which described the battle of\r\nNavarino as \"a collision wholly unexpected by His Majesty\" and as \"an\r\nuntoward event,\" which His Majesty hoped would not be followed by\r\nfurther hostilities. These expressions, however much in accord with the\r\npacific tone of the treaty of London, provoked an outburst of\r\nindignation from the friends of Greece in both houses. Lords Holland and\r\nAlthorp, Lord John Russell, and Brougham recorded earnest protests\r\nagainst any disparagement of Admiral Codrington's action. The\r\ninfatuation of the Porte, and the consequent war with Russia, checked\r\nfurther agitation on the subject, and Wellington's government was able\r\nto fall back on the policy of non-intervention proposed, though not\r\nalways practised, by Canning. But the reactionary tendency of\r\nWellington's foreign policy betrayed in the king's speech had its effect\r\nin alienating the more liberal of his colleagues. Nor was his position\r\nstrengthened by his irresolute home policy. During the session of 1828\r\nissues were raised which inevitably divided and ultimately broke up the\r\ncabinet.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _TEST ACTS REPEALED._]\r\n\r\nThe first of these difficulties was caused by the success of Lord John\r\nRussell's motion for the repeal of the test and corporation acts, under\r\nwhich dissenters were precluded from holding municipal and other\r\noffices. It was, indeed, a grave blot on the consistency of reformers\r\nthat, while the claims of Roman catholics, and especially of Irish Roman\r\ncatholics, had been vehemently urged for nearly thirty years, those of\r\nprotestant nonconformists had been coldly neglected. Their legal\r\ndisabilities, it is true, had gradually become almost nominal, and an\r\nindemnity act was passed yearly to cover the constant breaches of the\r\nobnoxious law. Still, the law was maintained, and was stoutly defended\r\nby such tories as Eldon on the principle that it was an important\r\noutwork of the union between Church and State. Even the Canningite\r\nmembers of the government supported it against Russell's attack, but on\r\nthe very opposite ground--that it had become a dead letter. However, the\r\nmeasure for its repeal was carried in the house of commons by a majority\r\nof forty-four, including some well-known Churchmen. This measure would\r\nassuredly have been rejected in the house of lords had not Peel\r\njudiciously procured the insertion of a clause substituting for the\r\nsacramental test a declaration binding the office-holder to do nothing\r\nhostile to the Church. Thus modified, it passed the house of lords, with\r\nthe assent of several bishops, in spite of the implacable opposition of\r\nLords Eldon and Redesdale, and the Duke of Cumberland. But the\r\ndeclaration was amended by the addition of the words \"upon the true\r\nfaith of a Christian,\" which incidentally continued the statutable\r\nexclusion of Jews.\r\n\r\nThe enforced acceptance of this enactment was equivalent to a decisive\r\nreverse, and could not but injure the prestige of the government, but it\r\ndid not actually cause a schism in the cabinet. It was otherwise when\r\nthe duke proposed a corn bill in lieu of that rejected at his instance\r\nin the previous year. The difference between these measures was not very\r\nmaterial, but the duke insisted upon certain regulations of detail,\r\nwhich Huskisson persistently opposed. Peel suggested a compromise which,\r\nafter long altercation and some threats of resignation, was adopted. But\r\nthe effect was to weaken the government still further in the eyes of the\r\npublic, inasmuch as the principle of duties on a graduated scale had\r\nprevailed at last against the declared opinions of the duke. The\r\ninevitable rupture was only deferred for a few weeks, and arose out of\r\nmotions for disfranchising East Retford and Penryn--a premonitory\r\nsymptom of the great reform bill. These were among the most corrupt of\r\nthe old \"rotten boroughs,\" and the scandalous practices which flourished\r\nin both of them had more than once shocked even the unreformed\r\nparliament. In 1827 a bill for disfranchising Penryn had actually been\r\ncarried by the house of commons in spite of Canning's dissent, and one\r\nfor disfranchising East Retford would probably have been carried, but\r\nthat it was introduced too late.\r\n\r\nThe motions now introduced by Lord John Russell and Charles Tennyson\r\nrespectively could scarcely have been thrown out by the same house, but\r\nsquabbles arose in the cabinet, partly on the comparative guiltiness of\r\nthe two venal constituencies, but chiefly on the disposal of the seats\r\nto be vacated. It was agreed at last that Penryn should be merged in the\r\nadjacent hundred, and the majority of the cabinet, represented by Peel,\r\nwere for dealing in like manner with East Retford. The liberal section,\r\nhowever, represented by Huskisson, was bent on transferring its\r\nrepresentation to Birmingham, and voted against Peel in the house of\r\ncommons. Having thus vindicated his independence, Huskisson, somewhat\r\ntoo hastily, placed his resignation in the hands of the premier on May\r\n20. The duke, having fairly lost patience with his insubordinate\r\ncolleagues, was equally prompt in accepting it, and declined to receive\r\nthe explanations offered. In the end, Palmerston, Dudley, Grant, and\r\nLamb, followed the fortunes of Huskisson, and Wellington's government\r\nwas completely purged of Canning's old supporters.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE CLARE ELECTION._]\r\n\r\nTwo military officers, without political experience, were now imported\r\ninto the ministry. Sir George Murray succeeded Huskisson at the colonial\r\noffice, and Sir Henry Hardinge replaced Palmerston as secretary at war,\r\nbut was not admitted to the cabinet; Lord Aberdeen became foreign\r\nsecretary, and Vesey Fitzgerald president of the board of trade, while\r\nLord Francis Leveson Gower succeeded Lamb as chief secretary for\r\nIreland. So purely tory an administration had not been formed since the\r\ndays of Perceval. Looking back we can see that, for that very reason, it\r\nwas doomed; but to politicians of 1828 Wellington's ascendency seemed\r\nassured, and it was not actually broken for above two years. By far the\r\nmost important event of domestic history within that period was the\r\ncrisis ending in the catholic emancipation act, and this crisis was\r\nimmediately precipitated by the almost casual appointment of Vesey\r\nFitzgerald. He was a popular Irish landlord, who had always supported\r\ncatholic relief, and his re-election for the county of Clare was\r\nregarded as perfectly secure. The landlords were known to be entirely in\r\nhis favour, and Irish tenants, miscalled \"forty shilling freeholders,\"\r\nhad been used to vote obsequiously for the candidate of their landlords.\r\nIndeed, these counterfeit freeholds had been manufactured recklessly\r\nthroughout Ireland for the very purpose of extending landlord influence.\r\nPerhaps the recent defeat of a Beresford at Waterford by a nominee of\r\nDaniel O'Connell, who had made himself the leader of the movement for\r\nCatholic relief, ought to have undeceived the Irish tories, but no one\r\ncould have foreseen so daring an act as the candidature of O'Connell\r\nhimself, notwithstanding that, as a catholic, he was incapable of\r\nsitting in the house of commons.\r\n\r\nThe contest began on June 30 and lasted five days. All the gentry and\r\nelectors of the higher class supported Fitzgerald, but all the poorer\r\nelectors, headed by their priests, flocked to the poll and voted for\r\nO'Connell, who, on Fitzgerald's retirement, was triumphantly elected.\r\nThe violence of O'Connell's language was unmeasured, and as was said by\r\nSheil, \"every altar became a tribune,\" but perfect order was maintained\r\nthroughout. The terrorism which has since disgraced Irish elections and\r\nvitiated the whole representation of Ireland had no place in this\r\nstartling victory, and the impression produced by it was thereby\r\ninfinitely enhanced. Two conclusions were instantly drawn from it: the\r\none, that electoral power in Ireland could not safely be left in the\r\nhands of the forty-shilling freeholders; the other, that, whether or not\r\nthey were disfranchised, nothing short of political equality of the\r\ncatholics of Ireland could avert the risk of civil war. It is seldom\r\nthat momentous changes can be so clearly traced to a single cause as in\r\nthe case of catholic emancipation. The whole interval between July,\r\n1828, and April, 1829, was occupied by the discussion of this question,\r\nor circumstances arising out of it, and it may truly be said to have\r\nfilled the whole horizon of domestic politics. The first and final\r\nrecognition by a responsible government of emancipation as a political\r\nnecessity dates immediately from the Clare election.\r\n\r\nThe question of catholic emancipation had been the only reason for the\r\nresignation of Pitt in 1801, but we have seen that he resumed office in\r\n1804 under a pledge not to re-open it. It is certain that he never\r\ncontemplated a complete emancipation of the catholics without safeguards\r\nfor the interests of the established church. Such a safeguard (though\r\nineffective against a future attack through disestablishment) was\r\nprovided by the act of union,[84] which inviolably united the Irish and\r\nEnglish churches. The catholic leaders, on their part, were profuse in\r\ntheir disavowals of hostility to that establishment and to the\r\nprotestant government in Ireland. In their first solemn memorial,\r\npresented by Grenville on March 25, 1805, they expressly declared that\r\n\"they do not seek or wish, in the remotest degree, to injure or encroach\r\nupon the rights, privileges, immunities, possessions, and revenues\r\nappertaining to the bishops and clergy of the protestant religion, or to\r\nthe churches committed to their charge\". They further volunteered an\r\nexpression of their belief that no evil act could be justified by the\r\ngood of the Church, and that papal infallibility was no article of the\r\ncatholic faith. Thenceforward, frequent motions in support of the\r\n\"catholic claims\" were made in both houses of parliament. In 1810 such a\r\nmotion was proposed in a very eloquent speech by Grattan, but\r\nCastlereagh, though a staunch friend of the cause, deprecated it as\r\ninopportune, since the catholics had injured themselves by imprudent\r\nconduct, and fresh declarations inconsistent with their former\r\nassurances. The motion was therefore rejected, and a similar fate befell\r\nmotions of the same kind in the two following years, especially in the\r\nhouse of lords, where Eldon inflexibly resisted any concession, and\r\nalways commanded a majority.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _CATHOLIC RELIEF._]\r\n\r\nWhen Liverpool replaced Perceval as prime minister in 1812, catholic\r\nemancipation became an open question in the cabinet. In that year\r\nCanning succeeded in carrying triumphantly a resolution pledging the\r\nhouse of commons to consider the question seriously in the next session,\r\nand a like resolution was only lost by one vote in the house of lords.\r\nAccordingly, in 1813, Grattan's motion for a committee of the whole\r\nhouse on catholic disabilities was accepted, and a bill for their\r\nremoval passed its second reading. But it was loaded with vexatious\r\nsecurities in committee and wrecked by the vigorous opposition of the\r\nspeaker, Abbot, who on May 24 carried by a majority of four an amendment\r\nwithholding the right to sit and vote in parliament. After this, the\r\nbill was of course abandoned, but another was unanimously passed\r\nexempting from penalties Roman catholics holding certain military and\r\ncivil offices, to which, by a harsh construction of law, they were not\r\neligible. In 1817 the question was debated at great length in the house\r\nof commons, and several leading men took part in it, but the motion for\r\ncatholic relief was again defeated by a majority of twenty-four. It was\r\nrevived in 1819 by Grattan, who delivered on this occasion one of his\r\ngreatest speeches, and succeeded in reducing the majority to two only.\r\nIn 1821 a further advance was made by Plunket's success in obtaining a\r\ncommittee to consider the claims of the catholics. This was carried by a\r\nmajority of six, and followed up by two bills, removing all catholic\r\ndisabilities with very slight exceptions, but subject to stringent and\r\nsomewhat illusory securities for the loyalty of the priesthood.\r\nUltimately on April 2 a comprehensive measure of catholic relief passed\r\nthe house of commons by a majority of nineteen. All the most influential\r\nmembers of the lower house now voted in its favour, but the attitude of\r\nthe upper house remained unchanged. The spirit of Eldon still ruled the\r\npeers, and his speech against Plunket's relief bill contains a complete\r\narmoury of protestant arguments. But the catholics had a still more\r\ndoughty opponent in the Duke of York, who delivered on this occasion the\r\nfirst of his famous declarations, binding himself to life-long\r\nhostility. As Eldon said, \"he did more to quiet this matter than\r\neverything else put together\".[85]\r\n\r\nThe year 1821 marks a turning point in the history of the catholic\r\nquestion, since the protestant cause, no longer safe in the house of\r\ncommons, was felt by its champions to depend on the crown and the house\r\nof lords. But it would be an error to suppose that catholic relief was\r\never a popular cry in this country, like retrenchment and reform. On the\r\ncontrary, the feelings of the masses in Great Britain were never roused\r\nin regard to it, and, if roused at all, would probably have been\r\nenlisted on the other side. It would be too much to say that the\r\ncontroversy was merely academical, for it was keen enough to split up\r\nparties and produce dualism in cabinets. But it was never a hustings\r\nquestion. It filled a much larger space in the minds of statesmen than\r\nin the minds of the people, and even among statesmen it was so far\r\nsecondary that it could be treated as an open question in Liverpool's\r\nministry for a period of fifteen years. No doubt the disturbed state of\r\nIreland, which ultimately supplied the motive power for carrying the\r\nemancipation act, contributed at an earlier stage to damp the zeal of\r\nits advocates. Whatever the merits of the union, it had failed to pacify\r\nthe country, thereby verifying the warning of Cornwallis, that, although\r\nIreland could not be saved without the union, \"you must not take it for\r\ngranted that it will be saved by it\".\r\n\r\nIn 1800, the very year of the union, the _habeas corpus_ act had been\r\nsuspended and another act passed for the suppression of rebellion.\r\nThough repealed in the following year, these coercive measures were\r\nrenewed in 1803, after Emmet's abortive rising, and continued in 1804.\r\nIn 1805, when they expired, special commissions were appointed for the\r\nrepression of crime in the south and west of Ireland. In 1807 the\r\n_habeas corpus_ act was again suspended and a rigorous insurrection act\r\npassed which continued in force until 1810. In that year a Catholic\r\nCommittee was formed, anticipating the more notorious Catholic\r\nAssociation. An essential part of the scheme was the formation of a\r\nrepresentative assembly in Dublin, to discuss and procure redress for\r\nthe wrongs of catholics. This project was put down by the Irish\r\ngovernment, which treated it as a breach of the convention act of 1793.\r\nThe next ten years seem to have been somewhat quieter in Ireland, and\r\nthe disturbances which followed the peace in Great Britain had no\r\ncounterpart in that country. Still, it was thought necessary to suppress\r\nanother catholic convention in 1814, and to renew the insurrection act,\r\nwhich remained in force with one interval till 1817. It can well be\r\nimagined that a population so lawless, and so prone to horrible outrages\r\nwhich shock Englishmen more than a thousand crimes against property,\r\nshould have excited little general sympathy by their complaints of\r\npolitical grievances. These grievances were justly denounced by party\r\nleaders, but in the eyes of ordinary politicians, and still more of\r\nelectors, coercion rather than concession was the appropriate remedy for\r\nthe ills of Ireland.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _CATHOLIC RELIEF._]\r\n\r\nCanning, however, though suspected of lukewarmness, did not let the\r\nquestion rest in 1822. On April 30, while still out of office, he\r\nintroduced a bill which he could scarcely have expected to become law,\r\nfor enabling Roman catholic peers to sit and vote in the house of lords.\r\nThis bill was passed in the commons by a majority of five, but rejected\r\nin the lords by a majority of forty-four, in spite of somewhat\r\ntransparent assertions that it was not intended to prejudice the main\r\nissue. On April 18, 1823, an angry protest from Burdett against the\r\n\"annual farce\" of motions leading to nothing was followed by a quarrel\r\nbetween Canning and Brougham, who accused Canning, then foreign\r\nsecretary, of \"monstrous truckling for the purpose of obtaining office\";\r\nand when Plunket moved, as usual, for the relief of catholics, a\r\ntemporary secession of radicals took place, which left him in a\r\nridiculous minority. In spite of this discomfiture, Lord Nugent\r\nsucceeded in carrying through the commons a bill, granting the\r\nparliamentary franchise to Roman catholics in Great Britain. The bill\r\nwas lost in the lords, and the question remained dormant in 1824; but in\r\n1825 it received a fresh impulse. This time it was Burdett who, at the\r\ninstance of Lansdowne and Brougham, appeared as spokesman of the\r\ncatholics. His action was in some respects inopportune, as the \"Catholic\r\nAssociation,\" founded by O'Connell and Sheil in 1823, was now usurping\r\nthe functions of a government, and regularly levying taxes under the\r\nname of \"rent\". The necessity of suppressing it, though not apparent to\r\nLord Wellesley, the lord-lieutenant, was strongly felt on both sides of\r\nthe house of commons. A bill for this purpose, but applicable to all\r\nsimilar associations, was rapidly carried by large majorities in both\r\nhouses, and the opposition was fain to rely mainly on the declaration\r\nthat it would be put in force against catholic associations only, and\r\nnot against those of the Orangemen, as the more violent of the Irish\r\nprotestants were called. It is needless to say that it was evaded by the\r\nformer, but on March 1, while it was still before the house of lords,\r\nBurdett took courage to move another preliminary resolution in favour of\r\nthe catholics, and obtained a majority of thirteen. A bill founded on\r\nthis resolution was at once introduced.\r\n\r\nThe debates on this bill were memorable in several respects and opened\r\nthe last stage but one in the long history of catholic relief. In the\r\nfirst place, more than one opponent publicly avowed his conversion to\r\nit; in the second place, now that its \"settlement\" was actually within\r\nview, the necessity of providing a counterpoise became admitted.\r\nAccordingly, one independent member proposed a state grant of £250,000 a\r\nyear for the endowment of the catholic clergy, who might thus be\r\nindirectly bound over to good behaviour, while another proposed the\r\ndisfranchisement of the 40s. freeholders. Both of these bills were read\r\na second time, but held over until the fate of the main relief bill\r\nshould be determined. That bill passed the house of commons on May 10,\r\n1825, by a majority of twenty-one, and Peel tendered his resignation to\r\nLord Liverpool.[86] Two days later, the Duke of York, on presenting a\r\npetition against the bill in the house of lords, delivered another\r\nspeech which fell like a thunder-clap on the country, and has been\r\ncelebrated ever since as an audacious breach of constitutional usage. In\r\nthis speech, he justified the inflexible attitude of his father, whose\r\nmental disorder he expressly attributed to the agitation of the catholic\r\nquestion. He concluded by declaring that his principles were the same,\r\nimbibed in early youth and confirmed by mature reflection, and that he\r\nwould maintain them up to the latest moment of his existence, \"whatever\r\nmight be his situation in life\". It is certain that, in thus pledging\r\nhimself, he acted without having consulted the king, who somewhat\r\nresented so direct an allusion to his prospect of succession. Still, the\r\nsensation produced by the duke's utterance was prodigious, and he\r\nremained the favourite champion of the protestant cause until his death.\r\nBrougham attacked him with furious sarcasm in the commons, but the lords\r\nthrew out Burdett's relief bill by a majority of forty-eight, and the\r\nNo-popery cry influenced the general election of 1826. In that year no\r\nfurther effort was made by the friends of catholic claims, but O'Connell\r\nshowed his growing power in Ireland by exciting a political revolt of\r\nthe peasantry at Waterford, and procuring the defeat of Lord George\r\nBeresford.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _CATHOLIC RELIEF._]\r\n\r\nIn the session of 1827, before Canning succeeded Lord Liverpool, Burdett\r\nrenewed his motion of 1825 on the catholic question, but found himself\r\ndefeated by four votes. The division had taken place in a full house,\r\nafter the fierce encounter, already mentioned, between Copley and\r\nCanning; but it cannot be regarded as a decisive token of contrast\r\nbetween the old and the new parliament, since relief was now claimed\r\nwithout any mention of \"securities\". The subject was in abeyance during\r\nthe short administrations of Canning and Goderich, but was raised again\r\nby Burdett in May, 1828, after the repeal of the test and corporation\r\nacts. The number of votes on the catholic side, 272, was the same as in\r\n1827, that on the protestant side, 266, was less by ten, the result\r\nbeing a majority of six for the motion. A similar resolution was lost in\r\nthe house of lords, as a matter of course; but the language held by the\r\nnew lord chancellor, Lyndhurst, and by Wellington himself, as prime\r\nminister, prepared observant men for an impending change of policy. Then\r\nfollowed the Clare election, which revealed nothing which might not have\r\nbeen foreseen, but which had the same effect in precipitating the\r\nremoval of catholic disabilities as the Irish famine afterwards had in\r\nprecipitating the repeal of the corn laws.\r\n\r\nWe now know that Peel had made up his mind to yield shortly after the\r\nClare election,[87] partly influenced by the alarming reports of\r\nAnglesey, the Irish lord-lieutenant, on the state of Ireland. We also\r\nknow that Wellington himself was more than half convinced of the\r\nnecessity of concession, and was preparing to strengthen his government\r\nfor the coming struggle, in the event of Peel feeling bound to retire.\r\nMeanwhile a vacancy in the ministry had been created by the Duke of\r\nClarence's resignation of his office of lord high admiral. In spite of\r\nthe limitations imposed on his power, he had insisted on hoisting his\r\nflag, and assumed command. For this he was severely reprehended by the\r\nking and Wellington, and was virtually forced to resign office. Melville\r\nnow became once more first lord of the admiralty, and was succeeded by\r\nEllenborough at the board of control. Ellenborough retained his former\r\noffice of lord privy seal, which Wellington was holding in reserve with\r\na view to strengthening the government. But the public of those days\r\nremained in entire ignorance of their intentions until the meeting of\r\nparliament on February 5, 1829.\r\n\r\nThe speech of George Dawson, Peel's brother-in-law, at Derry, on August\r\n12, had greatly startled protestants. As it was never publicly\r\ndisavowed, Brunswick clubs were formed to repel the rising tide of\r\nsympathy with the catholics, but the only tangible indication of\r\nWellington's personal sentiments favoured the belief that nothing would\r\nbe done. The circumstances under which this indication was given were\r\npeculiar. The duke had written a letter to the Roman catholic archbishop\r\nof Dublin, an old correspondent, deprecating agitation on the catholic\r\nquestion, as likely to prejudice its future settlement, of which,\r\nhowever, the duke saw \"no prospect\".[88] This letter was improperly\r\nsent by the archbishop to O'Connell as well as to Anglesey. O'Connell\r\nread it to the Catholic Association as a sign of conciliatory\r\ninclinations; Anglesey's reply suggested, at least, that agitation might\r\ncontinue. He was promptly recalled, and his recall was rendered the more\r\nsignificant by the appointment of the Duke of Northumberland, a known\r\n\"protestant,\" as his successor. What the public could not then know was\r\nthat behind all other difficulties, political or personal, lay the\r\nalmost insuperable difficulty of inducing the king to allow the cabinet\r\nto be even consulted. Indolent and unprincipled as George IV. was, he\r\nwas still capable of rousing and asserting himself. Probably no one but\r\nWellington could have prevailed against his anti-catholic prejudices,\r\nshared, as they were, not only by most of the peers, both spiritual and\r\ntemporal, but also by the mass of the English people. At this juncture\r\nPeel informed the duke that, rather than risk the success of the\r\nproposed measure, he would remain at his post. His example was followed\r\nby his \"protestant\" colleagues.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE INTRODUCTION OF THE RELIEF BILL._]\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1828-29 the strongest pressure was brought to bear\r\non the king by his ministers to procure his consent to a measure of\r\nrelief, accompanied by safeguards. Though he afterwards assured Eldon\r\nthat he had never explicitly given such a consent, the old chancellor,\r\non seeing the documents, felt obliged to express a contrary opinion. It\r\nis certain that he gave way most reluctantly, and probable that his\r\nscruples were as sincere as was consistent with his character; but he\r\nknew well that, if he dismissed his ministers, he would be left\r\nisolated, and he bowed to necessity. Indeed even the \"protestant\"\r\nmembers of the cabinet had urged him to yield. His assent was, in fact,\r\nonly given by degrees; after each member of the cabinet, who had\r\npreviously opposed catholic emancipation, had had a separate interview,\r\nthe king consented on January 15 to the consideration of the subject by\r\nthe cabinet, but reserved the right to reject its advice. After this no\r\ngreat difficulty was experienced in obtaining the royal assent to the\r\nintroduction of a bill.[89] Accordingly the king's speech, delivered by\r\ncommission on February 5, 1829, distinctly recommended parliament to\r\nconsider whether the civil disabilities of the catholics could not be\r\nremoved \"consistently with the full and permanent security of our\r\nestablishments in Church and State\". This recommendation, however, was\r\npreceded by a severe condemnation of the Catholic Association and the\r\nexpression of a resolution to put down the disorders caused by it. The\r\nsensation produced by the king's speech was increased by the\r\nsimultaneous resignation by Peel of his seat for the university of\r\nOxford. Considering that he was originally preferred to Canning mainly\r\non protestant grounds, he could not have honourably acted otherwise.\r\nMany of his old friends stood by him, in spite of differences on the\r\ncatholic question, and Eldon's grandson, who had been proposed as a\r\ncandidate, was set aside as too weak an opponent. Ultimately Sir Robert\r\nInglis was put forward by the \"protestants,\" and was returned by 755\r\nvotes against 609. Peel obtained a seat for the borough of Westbury,[90]\r\nand moved a preliminary bill for suppressing the Catholic Association.\r\nThis passed both houses in February, but was already ineffective when it\r\nbecame law, since the association had been shrewd enough to dissolve\r\nitself upon the advice of its English well-wishers. The catholic relief\r\nbill was therefore introduced under favourable auspices.\r\n\r\nThe motives which actuated Wellington and Peel in espousing the cause\r\nwhich they had so persistently opposed admit of no doubt whatever. In\r\nthe memoir which Peel left as embodying his own defence, no less than in\r\nhis speech introducing the emancipation bill, he affects no essential\r\nchange of conviction. He rests his case entirely on the public danger of\r\nleaving the question \"unsettled\" after the disclosures of the Clare\r\nelection, and argues calmly, as the agitators had been arguing for\r\nnearly thirty years, that no settlement was practicable short of\r\ncomplete, though not unconditional, surrender. There is no pretence of\r\nconsistency. All the constitutional, political, and religious objections\r\nto civil equality between protestants and catholics in Ireland remained\r\nunanswered and unabated. Indeed the increasing power and defiant tone of\r\nthe catholic demagogues might well have appeared a crowning reason for\r\nrefusing them seats in parliament. Peel, however, had adopted, and\r\npressed upon Wellington, the delusive opinion of Anglesey that by\r\n\"taking them from the Association and placing them in the house of\r\ncommons\" they might be reduced to comparative impotence. He lamented, it\r\nis true, the premature announcement of a new policy by Dawson, and he\r\nhad submitted his own resignation to the duke in the belief, apparently\r\nsincere, that he could render better service in an independent position.\r\nBut he seems not to have felt the least scruple in urging the duke to\r\nbreak all his pledges to his protestant supporters, and conciliate the\r\nfollowers of O'Connell. Nor did his advice fall on unwilling ears.\r\nTrained in a vocation where private conscience is subordinate to\r\nmilitary duty, where enemies must sometimes be welcomed as allies if it\r\nmay further the plan of campaign, and where a masterly retreat is as\r\nhonourable as a victory, Wellington did not shrink from undertaking the\r\npart of an opportunist minister. He had always regarded himself as a\r\nservant of the crown and the nation, rather than as a party leader, and\r\nhe saw no personal difficulty in adopting any political measure as the\r\nless of two evils. Having once satisfied himself that civil war in\r\nIreland was the only alternative to emancipation, he abandoned\r\nresistance to it as he would have abandoned a hopeless siege, and called\r\nupon his tory followers to change their front with him.\r\n\r\nNotice had been given of a resolution to be moved by Peel on March 5,\r\npreparing the way for the catholic relief bill, when the king raised\r\nfresh obstacles to its progress. As the day drew near, George,\r\nencouraged by the Duke of Cumberland, grew very excited. He had violent\r\ninterviews with his ministers, and finally on March 3 he informed\r\nWellington, Lyndhurst, and Peel that he could not assent to any\r\nalteration in the oath of supremacy. The three ministers accordingly\r\ntendered their resignations, which were accepted. But the king soon\r\nfound that no alternative administration was possible, and on the\r\nfollowing day the existing ministers received permission to proceed with\r\nthe bill.[91]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _PROVISIONS OF THE RELIEF BILL._]\r\n\r\nPeel's great speech on March 5, in favour of his resolution, contains a\r\ncomprehensive review of the Irish question, as well as an elaborate\r\ndefence of his own position, resting solely on grounds of expediency. He\r\nadvocated the measure itself as the only means of pacifying Ireland,\r\nreducing the undue power of the catholics, and securing the protestant\r\nreligion. It was simple in its main outlines, applying to the whole\r\nUnited Kingdom, and purporting to open all political and civil rights to\r\ncatholics, with a very few specified exceptions. It contained, however,\r\na number of provisions, in the nature of securities against catholic\r\naggression. By the new oath, to be substituted for the oaths of\r\nallegiance, supremacy, and abjuration, a member of parliament, or holder\r\nof an office, was no longer required to renounce transubstantiation, the\r\ninvocation of saints, or the sacrifice of the mass. But he was still\r\nobliged not only to swear allegiance, but to profess himself resolved to\r\nmaintain the protestant settlement of the crown, to condemn absolutely\r\nall papal jurisdiction within the realm, and to disclaim solemnly any\r\nintention of subverting the existing Church establishment or weakening\r\nthe system of protestant government. Moreover, priests were expressly\r\ndenied the privilege of sitting in parliament. Catholics were still\r\nexcluded from the high positions of sovereign, regent, lord chancellor\r\nof England or Ireland, and lord-lieutenant of Ireland. They were enabled\r\nto become ministers of the crown, but were debarred from the power of\r\nadvising the crown on presentations to ecclesiastical dignities or\r\nbenefices, nor were they allowed to exercise such patronage in their\r\npersonal capacity. They were still to be disabled from holding offices\r\nin the ecclesiastical courts, or in the universities, and their bishops\r\nwere forbidden to assume diocesan titles already appropriated by the\r\nestablishment. Other clauses were directed against the use of catholic\r\nvestments except in their chapels and private houses, and against the\r\nimportation of Jesuits or members of similar religious orders, with a\r\nsaving clause for those already resident and duly registered. Two other\r\nsafeguards, often proposed, were deliberately omitted from the bill.\r\nThere was no provision for a state endowment of catholic priests, or for\r\na veto of the crown on the appointment of catholic bishops. These\r\nomissions, whether justifiable or not, were pregnant with serious\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nThe debates in both houses on Peel's bill, as it was rightly considered,\r\nare chiefly interesting as throwing light on contemporary opinion. The\r\narguments for and against it had been fairly exhausted in previous\r\nyears, and would carry no great weight in a later age. The\r\nconstitutional objections to it, which seemed vital to Eldon, and\r\nweighty to every statesman of his time, were at a later date put aside,\r\nwhen they were pleaded against the dissolution of the Irish church,\r\ndirectly guaranteed by the act of union. The criticisms on the personal\r\nconsistency of Wellington and Peel belong to biography rather than to\r\nhistory. But no one can read the speeches of leading men on either side\r\nwithout recognising the superior foresight, at least, of those who\r\nopposed the bill, and distrusted the efficacy of the safeguards embodied\r\nin it. Two assumptions underlay the whole discussion, and were treated\r\nas axioms by nearly all the speakers. The one was that catholic\r\nemancipation must be judged by its effect on the future peace of\r\nIreland; the other, that it could not be justified, unless it would\r\nstrengthen, rather than weaken, protestant ascendency, then regarded as\r\na bulwark of the constitution. Posterity may contemplate it from a\r\ndifferent and perhaps higher point of view; but it is certain that, if\r\nits consequences had been foreseen by those who voted upon it, the bill\r\nwould have been rejected. It is no less certain that its adoption was a\r\nvictory of the educated classes, represented by nomination-boroughs,\r\nover the unrepresented masses of the people.\r\n\r\nThe actual result in the division lists was all that its promoters could\r\nhave desired. Though the secret had been so well kept by the government\r\nthat few of its supporters knew what to expect, and though piles of\r\npetitions showed the preponderance of protestant sentiment outside\r\nparliament, that sentiment was not reflected in the division lists. The\r\nfirst reading of the bill in the house of commons was carried by a\r\nmajority of 348 to 160; the second reading by a majority of 353 to 180;\r\nthe third reading by a majority of 320 to 142. The debates were\r\nenlivened on the protestant side by a brilliant speech from Michael\r\nSadler, a tory friend of the working classes, returned by the Duke of\r\nNewcastle for Newark, and a violent invective from Sir Charles\r\nWetherell, the attorney-general, who was thereupon dismissed from\r\noffice. Peel, who had borne the brunt of these attacks, replied on March\r\n30, when the bill was sent up to the lords, and on April 2, the second\r\nreading of it in the upper house was moved by Wellington. His candid\r\nadmission that he was driven to concession by the fear of civil war has\r\nsince become historical, and served as the watchword of many a lawless\r\nagitation in Ireland. It was natural that most of the peers, and\r\nespecially of the spiritual peers, who took part in the discussion\r\nshould be opponents of the measure, but Lloyd, Bishop of Oxford, severed\r\nhimself from the rest of his order, and vigorous speeches were made in\r\nsupport of it by Anglesey and Grey, neither of whom could be regarded as\r\nfriendly to Wellington's government.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _ROYAL ASSENT TO THE BILL._]\r\n\r\nAnglesey, who had been recently dismissed from the lord-lieutenancy of\r\nIreland, went beyond the duke in the use of purely military arguments;\r\nGrey ventured to prophesy not only a future reign of peace in Ireland,\r\nbut an extension of protestantism, as the consequence of catholic\r\nemancipation. The hopeless attempt of Lyndhurst to vindicate his own\r\nconsistency, and a forensic duel between Eldon and Plunket, who had been\r\nraised to the peerage in 1827, relieved the monotony of the debate, but\r\nprobably did not influence a single vote. The old guard of the\r\nanti-catholic party remained firm, but the mass of tory peers followed\r\ntheir leader in his new policy, as they had followed him in his old, and\r\nthe relief bill was read a third time in the house of lords on the 10th,\r\nby a majority of 104. Three days later it received the royal assent.\r\nLord Eldon had virtually encouraged the king to refuse this, at the last\r\nmoment, though he was too honest to accept the assurance of George IV.\r\nthat the bill was introduced without his authority. But the son of\r\nGeorge III. had not inherited his father's resolute character. After a\r\nfew childish threats of retiring to Hanover and leaving the Duke of\r\nClarence to make terms with the ministry, he abandoned further\r\nresistance and capitulated to Wellington, as Wellington had capitulated\r\nto O'Connell.\r\n\r\nThe disfranchisement of the forty-shilling freeholders and the\r\nsubstitution of a ten-pound suffrage was the price to be paid for\r\ncatholic emancipation, and no time was lost in completing the bargain.\r\nIn days when it is assumed that every change in the electoral franchise\r\nmust needs be in a downward direction, it may well appear amazing that\r\nso wholesale a destruction of privileges enjoyed for thirty-six years\r\nshould have provoked so feeble an opposition. It is still more amazing\r\nthat it should have passed without a protest from O'Connell himself, who\r\nhad solemnly vowed to perish on the field or on the scaffold rather than\r\nsubmit to it. Yet so it was. These ignorant voters, it is true, had\r\nnever ventured to call their souls their own, and had only ceased to be\r\nthe servile creatures of their landlords in order to become the servile\r\ncreatures of their priests. Still, it was they who, by their action in\r\nthe Waterford and Clare elections, had forced the hand of the\r\ngovernment, and achieved catholic emancipation. It may safely be said\r\nthat after the reform act of 1832 it would have been politically\r\nimpossible to disfranchise them; and even in the unreformed parliament\r\nit would have been scarcely possible if gratitude were a trustworthy\r\nmotive in politics. On the other hand, the government could never have\r\nsecured a majority for catholic emancipation, unless it had been\r\ndistinctly understood to carry with it the extinction of democracy in\r\nIreland. This, rather than declarations and restrictions of doubtful\r\nefficacy, was the real \"security\" on which the legislature relied for\r\ndisarming the disloyalty of Irish catholics. For some time it answered\r\nits purpose so far as to keep the representation of that disloyalty\r\nwithin safe limits in the house of commons. But it naturally produced a\r\ncontrary effect in Ireland itself, and was destined to be swept away\r\nbefore a fresh wave of agitation.\r\n\r\nA few days before the relief bill passed the house of commons an episode\r\noccurred which is chiefly interesting for the light which it throws on\r\nthe ideas then prevalent in the highest society. In 1828 Wellington had\r\npresided at a meeting for the establishment of King's College, London,\r\nan institution which was to be entirely under the influence of the\r\nestablished church, and which was intended as a counterpoise to the\r\npurely secular institution which had been recently founded under the\r\ntitle of the \"London University\". The Earl of Winchilsea, a peer of no\r\npersonal importance, but a stalwart upholder of Church and State,\r\npublished in the _Standard_ newspaper of March 16, 1829, a virulent\r\nletter, describing the whole transaction \"as a blind to the protestant\r\nand high church party,\" and accusing the prime minister of insidious\r\ndesigns for the introduction of popery in every department of the state.\r\nThe duke at once sent Hardinge with a note couched in moderate language,\r\ndemanding an apology. Winchilsea made no apology, but offered to express\r\nregret for having mistaken the duke's motives, if the duke would declare\r\nthat when he presided at the meeting in question he was not\r\ncontemplating any measure of catholic relief. Whereupon the duke\r\ndemanded \"that satisfaction which a gentleman has a right to require,\r\nand which a gentleman never refuses to give\". A hostile meeting took\r\nplace on March 21 in Battersea fields. The duke intentionally fired\r\nwide, and Winchilsea, after discharging his weapon in the air, tendered\r\na written apology, in conformity with the so-called rules of honour. The\r\nduke was conscious that his conduct must have \"shocked many good men,\"\r\nbut he always maintained that it was the only way, and proved an\r\neffectual way, of dispelling the atmosphere of calumny in which he was\r\nsurrounded. It is probable that he judged rightly of his contemporaries,\r\nand that he gained rather than lost in reputation by an act which, apart\r\nfrom its moral aspect, risked the success of a great measure largely\r\ndepending on the continuance of his own life. It may be noticed that he\r\nafterwards became not only the personal friend of his antagonist, but\r\nthe most influential member of the Anti-Duelling Association.[92]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _EXCLUSION OF O'CONNELL._]\r\n\r\nAnother episode, or rather sequel, of the great contest on catholic\r\nrelief had more serious political consequences. Though O'Connell was the\r\nundoubted leader of the movement, and might almost have claimed to be\r\nthe father of the act, he was most unwisely but deliberately excluded\r\nfrom its benefits. His exclusion was effected by a clause which rendered\r\nits operation strictly prospective, for the very purpose of shutting out\r\nthe one catholic who had been elected under the old law. It had been\r\ndecided by a committee of the house of commons that he was duly\r\nreturned, the only question being whether he could take his seat without\r\nsubscribing the oath now abolished. This question was brought to a test\r\nby the appearance of O'Connell in person in the house itself. The\r\nspeaker, Charles Manners-Sutton, declared that he could not properly be\r\nadmitted to be sworn under the new law, upon which O'Connell claimed a\r\nhearing. A long and futile discussion followed as to whether he should\r\nbe heard at the table or at the bar. In the end he was heard at the bar,\r\nand produced a very favourable impression upon his opponents as well as\r\nhis friends by the ingenuity of his arguments and the studied moderation\r\nof his tone. His case, however, was manifestly untenable from a legal\r\npoint of view, and a new writ was ordered to be issued for the county of\r\nClare.\r\n\r\nThen was shown both the folly of stirring up so needlessly the\r\ninflammable materials of Irish sedition and the futility of imagining\r\nthat catholic emancipation, right or wrong, would prove a healing\r\nmeasure. Having exhibited the better side of his character in his speech\r\nbefore the house of commons, O'Connell exhibited its worst side without\r\nstint or shame in his addresses to the Irish peasantry. Skilfully\r\navoiding the language of sheer treason, he set no bounds to his coarse\r\nand outrageous vituperation of the nation which had sacrificed even its\r\nconscience to appease Ireland; nor did he shrink from denouncing\r\nWellington and Peel as \"those men who, false to their own party, can\r\nnever be true to us\". The note which he struck has never ceased to\r\nvibrate in the hearts of the excitable people which he might have\r\neducated into loyal citizenship, and the spirit which he evoked has been\r\nthe evil genius of Ireland from his day to our own. He openly unfurled\r\nthe standard of repeal, but the repeal he demanded did not involve the\r\ncreation of an Irish republic. Ireland was still to be connected with\r\nGreat Britain by \"the golden link of the crown,\" and though agitation\r\nwas carried to the verge of rebellion, the great agitator never actually\r\nadvised his dupes to rise in arms for a war of independence. Short of\r\nthis he did all in his power, and with too much success, to inflame them\r\nwith a malignant hatred of the sister country. If the promoters of\r\ncatholic emancipation had ever looked for any reward beyond the inward\r\nsatisfaction of having done a righteous act, they were speedily and\r\nwofully undeceived.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[83] Wellington to Peel, January 9, 1828, in Parker, _Sir Robert Peel_,\r\nii., 27.\r\n\r\n[84] Lecky, _History of Ireland_, v., 358-60, _n._; Stapleton, _Life of\r\nCanning_, ii., 131-34.\r\n\r\n[85] Eldon to Sir William Scott, Twiss, _Life of Eldon_, ii., 416.

The only foreign problems\r\nwhich gave serious trouble during this period were the Eastern and\r\nPortuguese questions. The influence which the former exercised on\r\ndomestic policy has rendered it necessary to trace its course as far as\r\nthe battle of Navarino in the last chapter. We must now take up the\r\nother question where we left it, at the recognition of the independence\r\nof Brazil and the expulsion of the Spanish troops from the mainland of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nPeter I., Emperor of Brazil, though an independent sovereign, was still\r\nheir-apparent to the throne of Portugal, and the ultra-royalists hoped\r\nthat, in spite of the provisions of the Brazilian constitution, his\r\nsuccession to his ancestral crown would restore the unity of the\r\nPortuguese dominions. The death of King John VI. on March 10, 1826,\r\nbrought the matter to a crisis. Four days before his death he had\r\nappointed a council of regency which was to be presided over by his\r\ndaughter, Isabella Maria, but from which the queen and Dom Miguel, then\r\ntwenty-three, were both excluded. By this act the absolutist party were\r\ndeprived of power until they should be restored to it by the action of\r\nthe new king, or by a revolution. The regency wished the new king to\r\nmake a speedy choice between the two crowns; and it was anticipated that\r\nhe would abdicate the Portuguese crown in favour of his seven-year-old\r\ndaughter, Maria da Gloria. The absolutists on the other hand hoped that\r\nthe king might by procrastination avoid the separation of the crowns.\r\n\r\nWhat was their surprise when they discovered that the king had indeed\r\ndetermined to procrastinate, but in such a way as to displease the\r\nabsolutists as much as the friends of constitutional government? No\r\nsooner had the news of his father's death reached Peter at Rio Janeiro,\r\nthan he issued a charter of 145 clauses, conferring a constitution on\r\nPortugal. This constitution which was destined to alternate for nearly a\r\ngeneration with absolute monarchy or with the revolutionary constitution\r\nof 1821, had the advantage of being the voluntary gift of the king. It\r\nwas, however, composed in great haste, and, except that it retained the\r\nhereditary nobility as a first chamber in the cortes, was almost\r\nidentical with the constitution established in Brazil in the previous\r\nDecember. Among other provisions it subjected the nobility to taxation\r\nand asserted the principle of religious toleration. A few days later, on\r\nthe 2nd of May, King Peter executed an act of abdication in favour of\r\nhis daughter Maria, providing, however, that the abdication should not\r\ncome into effect until the necessary oaths had been taken to the new\r\nconstitution and until the new queen should have been married to her\r\nuncle, Dom Miguel.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _CIVIL WAR IN PORTUGAL._]\r\n\r\nThis compromise pleased nobody. It is true that it seemed to make\r\npermanent the separation of Brazil from Portugal, since the former state\r\nwas destined for Peter's infant son, afterwards Peter II.; but the\r\nBrazilian patriots would have preferred a more definite abandonment of\r\nthe Portuguese throne, and Peter's half-measure of abdication was one of\r\nthe main causes of the discontent which drove him to resign the\r\nBrazilian crown five years later. The Portuguese liberals were alarmed\r\nat the prospect of a restoration of Dom Miguel to power, while the\r\nabsolutists were indignant at the imposition of a constitution. From the\r\nvery first it encountered opposition. The new constitution was indeed\r\nproclaimed on July 13, and the necessary oaths were taken on the 31st.\r\nBut on the same day a party, consisting mainly of Portuguese deserters\r\nin Spanish territory, proclaimed Miguel as king and the queen-mother as\r\nregent during his absence. Miguel, however, gave no open support to this\r\nparty; on October 4 he actually took the oath to the new constitution,\r\nand on the 29th he formally betrothed himself at Vienna to the future\r\nQueen of Portugal. But the Portuguese insurgents were not deterred by\r\nthe apparent defection of the prince whose claim to reign they\r\nasserted, and they received a thinly disguised encouragement from the\r\nSpanish government, which certainly did nothing to interfere with their\r\norganisation in Spanish territory. On the 10th the last insurgents had\r\nbeen expelled from Portuguese territory, but in November they were\r\nopenly joined by some Spanish soldiers, and on the 22nd of that month\r\nthey invaded the Portuguese province of Traz-os-Montes. Another division\r\nmade a simultaneous irruption into the province of Alemtejo. This latter\r\nbody was quickly expelled from the kingdom and marched through Spanish\r\nterritory to join its more successful comrades in Northern Portugal. The\r\nwhole province of Traz-os-Montes had fallen into the hands of the\r\nabsolutists in a few days, and its defection was followed by that of the\r\nnorthern part of Beira, when the arrival of British forces gave the\r\nconstitutional party the necessary encouragement to enable them to\r\narrest the progress of the insurrection.\r\n\r\nAs in 1823, the Portuguese government, represented in London by\r\nPalmella, applied for British assistance against the ultra-royalists at\r\nhome. But on the present occasion Portugal was able to appeal to\r\nsomething more than the general friendship of Great Britain. By the\r\ntreaties of 1661 and 1703, renewed as recently as 1815, Great Britain\r\nwas bound to defend Portugal against invasion, and Portugal now claimed\r\nthe fulfilment of these treaties. The formal demand was received by the\r\nBritish ministry on December 3, but it was not till Friday, the 8th,\r\nthat official intelligence was received of the invasion. Not a moment\r\nwas lost in despatching 5,000 troops to Portugal. This resolution was\r\nformed by the cabinet on the 9th, approved by the king on the 10th, and\r\ncommunicated to parliament on the 11th. On the evening of the 12th\r\nCanning was able to inform the house of commons that the troops were\r\nalready on the march for embarkation.\r\n\r\nThe debate in the house of commons on the address in answer to the royal\r\nmessage announcing the request of the Portuguese government, was the\r\noccasion of two of the most famous speeches that Canning ever delivered.\r\nAfter recounting the treaty obligations of this country to Portugal, and\r\nthe circumstances of the Portuguese application for assistance, and\r\ndisclaiming any desire to meddle with the domestic politics of\r\nPortugal, he referred to a previous anticipation that the next European\r\nwar would be one \"not so much of armies as of opinions\". \"Not four\r\nyears,\" he proceeded, \"have elapsed, and behold my apprehension\r\nrealised! It is, to be sure, within narrow limits that this war of\r\nopinion is at present confined: but it is a war of opinion that Spain\r\n(whether as government or as nation) is now waging against Portugal; it\r\nis a war which has commenced in hatred of the new institutions of\r\nPortugal. How long is it reasonable to expect that Portugal will abstain\r\nfrom retaliation? If into that war this country shall be compelled to\r\nenter, we shall enter into it with a sincere and anxious desire to\r\nmitigate rather than exasperate, and to mingle only in the conflict of\r\narms, not in the more fatal conflict of opinions. But I much fear that\r\nthis country (however earnestly she may endeavour to avoid it) could\r\nnot, in such case, avoid seeing ranked under her banners all the\r\nrestless and dissatisfied of any nation with which she might come in\r\nconflict. It is the contemplation of this new power in any future war\r\nwhich excites my most anxious apprehension. It is one thing to have a\r\ngiant's strength, but it would be another to use it like a giant. The\r\nconsciousness of such strength is undoubtedly a source of confidence and\r\nsecurity; but in the situation in which this country stands, our\r\nbusiness is not to seek opportunities of displaying it, but to content\r\nourselves with letting the professors of violent and exaggerated\r\ndoctrines on both sides feel that it is not their interests to convert\r\nan umpire into an adversary.\"\r\n\r\nIn his reply at the close of the debate Canning vindicated his\r\nconsistency in resisting Spanish aggression upon Portugal, while\r\noffering no resistance to the military occupation of Spain by France,\r\nwhich had not yet terminated. He pointed out that the Spain of his day\r\nwas quite different from \"the Spain within the limits of whose empire\r\nthe sun never set--the Spain 'with the Indies' that excited the\r\njealousies and alarmed the imaginations of our ancestors\". He admitted\r\nthat the entry of the French into Spain was a disparagement to the pride\r\nof England, but he thought it had been possible to obtain compensation\r\nwithout offering resistance in Spain itself. Then came the famous\r\npassage: \"If France occupied Spain, was it necessary, in order to avoid\r\nthe consequences of that occupation, that we should blockade Cadiz? No.\r\nI looked another way--I sought materials of compensation in another\r\nhemisphere. Contemplating Spain, such as our ancestors had known her, I\r\nresolved that if France had Spain, it should not be Spain 'with the\r\nIndies'. I called the new world into existence to redress the balance of\r\nthe old.\"[93]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _TROOPS SENT TO PORTUGAL._]\r\n\r\nThe two speeches were greeted with applause both in parliament and in\r\nthe country, but their vanity was excessive. So far from \"creating the\r\nnew world,\" Canning had merely recognised the existence of states which\r\nhad already won their own independence, and even so he was only\r\nfollowing the example of the United States. It was not only extremely\r\nfoolish, but altogether disingenuous, to maintain that the recognition\r\nof the South American republics had been resolved on as a counterpoise\r\nto French influence in Spain. The reasons which prompted this\r\nrecognition were commercial, not political, and it had been announced to\r\nthe powers as our ultimate policy before any invasion of Spain had taken\r\nplace. The king had only consented to the step on condition that it was\r\nnot to be represented as a measure of retaliation, and Canning himself\r\nwhen he delivered these speeches knew that the French had promised to\r\nevacuate Spain in the following April.[94] But however little justified\r\nby facts, the two speeches made a profound impression throughout Europe.\r\nWhatever Canning might desire, it was quite clear that he contemplated\r\nthe possibility of a military alliance between this country and the\r\nrevolutionary factions on the continent, and the impression gained\r\nground that he desired to pose as the champion of liberalism against\r\nlegitimate government.\r\n\r\nThe first detachment of the British army reached Lisbon on Christmas\r\nday. It was not destined, however, to play an active part in the\r\nPortuguese struggle. The insurgent army was as greatly discouraged as\r\nthe loyal troops were elated by its arrival, and the government was\r\nmoreover enabled to employ a larger force on the scene of hostilities.\r\nThe insurgents were in consequence driven out of the province of Beira\r\nand the greater part of Traz-os-Montes. A new invasion from Spanish\r\nterritory, supported by some Spanish soldiers and Spanish artillery,\r\ntook place during January, 1827. The greater part of the province of the\r\nMinho fell into the hands of the rebels, and on February 2 they captured\r\nthe important town of Braga. But the forces of the regency proved too\r\nstrong for them, and early in March the insurgents evacuated Portugal\r\naltogether. The Spanish government, now that little could be effected by\r\nfurther assistance to the Portuguese refugees, determined at length to\r\nperform the duties of a neutral power, and disarmed them.\r\n\r\nThe British troops remained in Portugal till March, 1828. By that time\r\nthe disturbances had assumed a purely domestic character, and it was\r\nultimately decided to recall them. But a firmer policy than that\r\nactually followed would have been necessary in order to extricate Great\r\nBritain from the strife of Portuguese factions, in which her recent\r\naction had given a decided advantage to the constitutional party. That\r\nparty had been driven into opposition before the British troops were\r\nrecalled. On July 3, 1827, King Peter had issued a decree appointing Dom\r\nMiguel his lieutenant, and investing him with all the powers which\r\nbelonged to him as king under the charter. Miguel, after visiting\r\nLondon, arrived at Lisbon on February 22, 1828, and was sworn in as\r\nregent four days later. As he was twenty-five years old, and therefore\r\nof full age according to Portuguese law, he could not with any show of\r\nequity have been kept out of the regency longer. Miguel's installation\r\nas regent was followed by a series of riots as well on the part of the\r\nabsolutists, who desired to make him king, as on the part of the\r\nconstitutionalists who feared that he would make himself king. It was\r\nnot long before he definitely identified himself with the absolutist\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _MIGUEL'S USURPATION._]\r\n\r\nOn March 14 the cortes were dissolved. On May 3 Miguel summoned the\r\nancient cortes in his own name, and on June 26 they acknowledged him as\r\nking. The immediate result of this act was that all the ambassadors,\r\nexcept those of Spain and the Holy See, quitted Lisbon, and the lapse of\r\ntime did not induce them to change their attitude towards Miguel. A\r\nfurther complication was introduced by Peter's definite abdication in\r\nfavour of his daughter on March 3, executed before he had any suspicion\r\nof Miguel's designs, which placed Miguel in the position of regent for\r\nhis infant niece instead of for his brother. After this formal\r\nabdication Peter despatched his daughter to Europe, intending that she\r\nshould proceed to Vienna. When, however, she arrived at Gibraltar on\r\nSeptember 2, her conductors, hearing of Miguel's usurpation, determined\r\nto take her to England, and she landed at Falmouth on the 24th. Peter,\r\non hearing of Miguel's usurpation, naturally considered the regency\r\nterminated, and claimed to act as the guardian of the infant queen; the\r\nBrazilian ministers in Europe acted as his agents, while his partisans\r\nassembled in England and attempted to use this country as a basis for\r\nwarlike operations in Portuguese territories.\r\n\r\nThe situation of 1826 was thus reversed. Instead of an ultra-royalist\r\nparty resting on Spain, a constitutionalist party resting on Brazil and\r\nattempting to rest on England was now threatening the established\r\ngovernment at Lisbon. Wellington was anxious to maintain a strict\r\nneutrality, but he failed to prevent a ship of war and supplies of arms\r\nand ammunition going from Plymouth to Terceira in the Azores, where\r\nDonna Maria was acknowledged as queen. He succeeded, however, in\r\npreventing a larger armament, which had been raised under the name of\r\nthe Emperor of Brazil, with Rio Janeiro as its nominal destination, from\r\nlanding at Terceira. This action, though the logical consequence of the\r\nBritish opposition to the conduct of Spain in 1826, was severely\r\ncriticised in England as equivalent to an intervention on behalf of\r\nMiguel.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Canning's attempt to prevent the separate action of Russia in\r\nthe Eastern question had been doomed to disappointment. The destruction\r\nof the Turkish navy at Navarino was naturally regarded at Constantinople\r\nas an outrage, and the Porte demanded satisfaction from the ambassadors\r\nof the allied powers. This they refused to grant on the ground that the\r\nTurks had been the aggressors, and they in their turn demanded an\r\narmistice between the Turkish troops and the Greek insurgents. As the\r\nPorte remained obdurate, the ambassadors of France, Great Britain, and\r\nRussia, acting in accordance with their instructions, left\r\nConstantinople on December 8, 1827. But though war seemed imminent, the\r\ntsar still disowned all idea of conquest, and professed to desire\r\nnothing further than the execution of the treaty of London. A protocol\r\nwas accordingly signed on the 12th by which the three powers confirmed\r\na clause in the treaty, providing that, in the event of war, none of\r\nthem should derive any exclusive benefit, either commercial or\r\nterritorial.\r\n\r\nThe British government imagined that the powers might still effect their\r\nobject by diplomacy, and that it would not be necessary to abandon the\r\nTurkish alliance. But any such idea must have been rudely shaken by the\r\nhati-sherif of December 20. In that document the sultan enlarged on the\r\ncruelty and perfidy of the Christian powers and summoned the Muslim\r\nnations to arms: he denounced Russia in particular as the prime mover of\r\nthe Greek rebellion, the instigator of the other powers, and the\r\narch-enemy of Islam; and he declared the treaty of Akkerman, by which\r\nthe outstanding disputes between Russia and the Porte had been settled\r\nin October, 1826, to have been extorted by force and only signed in\r\norder to save time. This defiance of Russia, if not of all Christendom,\r\nwas followed by a levy of Turkish troops and the expulsion of most of\r\nthe Christian residents from Constantinople. No course was now open to\r\nRussia but to make war. It remained to be seen whether any other power\r\nwould join her. On January 6, 1828, a Russian despatch announced the\r\ntsar's intention of occupying the Danubian principalities, and suggested\r\nthat France and Great Britain should force the Dardanelles and thus\r\ncompel the Porte to comply with the provisions of the treaty of London.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _WELLINGTON'S EASTERN POLICY._]\r\n\r\nIt is possible that if the direction of British foreign policy had\r\nremained in the hands of Goderich and Dudley, our government might have\r\nlent its support to a settlement of the Eastern question which would in\r\neffect have been the work of Russia only. The more daring policy of\r\nCanning, by which Great Britain had attempted to take the lead as\r\nopportunity offered, either in active co-operation with Russia or in\r\nactive opposition to her, could only be directed by a more versatile\r\nstatesman than the nation now possessed. The accession to office of\r\nWellington, though it left Dudley at the foreign office, was really\r\nmarked by a return to the policy of Castlereagh, a policy which, if not\r\nbrilliant, was at least honourable, consistent, and considerate, and\r\nwhich in the hands of Wellington was managed with a sufficient measure\r\nof firmness, though with less tact and insight than had been shown by\r\nCastlereagh. The first object of this policy was to keep the special\r\ngrievances of Russia distinct from the complaints which Europe at large\r\nor, in the present situation, the three allied powers were able to bring\r\nagainst the Porte. By so doing the British government hoped to prevent\r\nRussia from dragging other powers into a war for her private benefit,\r\nand also to render it impossible for Russia to use her special\r\ngrievances as a lever by which she might effect a separate settlement of\r\nthe general question. For some years this policy was successful. Russia\r\ndid indeed wage a separate war with the Turks, but the Greek question\r\nwas settled by the three powers conjointly, and Great Britain rather\r\nthan Russia took the lead in the settlement. It was only after\r\nPalmerston had succeeded to the direction of our foreign policy in 1830,\r\nthat it was discovered how far the victory of Russia in war had placed\r\nher in a position to dictate the general policy of the Ottoman court.\r\n\r\nWellington experienced no difficulty in striking out a line of policy\r\nalong which he could carry France with him. On February 21 De la\r\nFerronays, who had been recalled from the French embassy at St.\r\nPetersburg to occupy the post of foreign minister in the new liberal\r\nadministration, which had been formed in France in December, 1827,\r\ndespatched a note urging the immediate employment of energetic measures\r\nagainst the Porte. He saw that the hati-sherif gave special occasion of\r\nwar to Russia, and he was naturally anxious to anticipate her isolated\r\naction by combined measures of coercion. He had, however, nothing better\r\nto suggest than the execution of the Russian proposals of January 6.\r\nWellington, in his reply, dated the 26th, rightly minimised the\r\nseriousness of the hati-sherif, and characterised the proposed measures\r\nof coercion as destined to be ineffectual. He also expressed the fear\r\nthat if the three powers combined to make war on the Turks there would\r\nbe a general insurrection of the subject races in the Turkish dominions\r\nwhich might last indefinitely. He therefore proposed first to settle the\r\nGreek question by local pressure, after which he anticipated no serious\r\ntrouble about events at Constantinople. On the same day he drafted a\r\nmemorandum to the cabinet in which he proposed that the allied squadrons\r\nshould proceed to the Archipelago, blockade the Morea and Alexandria,\r\ndestroy the Greek pirates, stop the warfare in Chios and Crete, and call\r\nupon the Greek government to withdraw the forces which were operating\r\nin western and eastern Greece respectively under the command of two\r\nforeign volunteers, General Church and Colonel Fabvier. In other words,\r\nhe proposed to coerce not the Porte but the actual combatants, Greece\r\nand Egypt, and to check each party where it was the aggressor. If the\r\nprime object of the government in the eastern question was the\r\nmaintenance of order, these proposals were excellent. The one capital\r\ndefect of the whole scheme was that it ignored the Russian desire for\r\nwar, which rendered it impossible for the tsar to postpone the\r\nsettlement of his own grievances until an arrangement should be come to\r\non the Greek question; on the other hand, by isolating the Greek\r\nquestion, it left it possible for the western powers to proceed with its\r\nsolution in spite of the outbreak of hostilities between Russia and the\r\nTurks.[95]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA AND TURKEY._]\r\n\r\nRussia's determination to act singly was, however, already made. On the\r\nsame day, February 26, on which Wellington sketched his policy,\r\nNesselrode issued a despatch declaring that war was inevitable,\r\nincluding among his reasons the repudiation of recent treaties by the\r\nPorte and the proclamation by it of a holy war. At the same time he\r\nendeavoured to disarm any possible opposition on the part of the powers\r\nby an invitation to them to make use of the coming war to carry out the\r\ntreaty of London. In any case Russia would execute the treaty, but if\r\nshe were left to herself, the manner of execution would be determined by\r\nher own convenience and interest.[96] So far Russia had done nothing\r\ndirectly inconsistent with the maintenance of her concert with France\r\nand Great Britain, whose representatives had been sitting in conference\r\nwith hers at London since January, 1827. But the reference in this last\r\nnote to the possibility of a settlement of the Greek question according\r\nto the convenience and interest of Russia appeared like a threat of\r\nbreaking up the alliance in case France and Great Britain refused to\r\nsend their fleets to the Mediterranean. At least Wellington so\r\nunderstood it, and, rather than be a party to the war, he dissolved the\r\nconference of London in the middle of March. But he soon found that by\r\nso doing he lost the co-operation of France, and he was therefore\r\ncompelled to accept the assurances of Russia that she intended to keep\r\nwithin the limits of the treaty of London, and to regard the\r\nMediterranean as a neutral area. The conference was in consequence\r\nreopened at the beginning of July. Meanwhile hostilities had actually\r\nbegun between Russia and the Turks. Russia declared war on April 26. On\r\nMay 7 her troops crossed the Pruth. They rapidly overran the Danubian\r\nprovinces, and on June 7 crossed the Danube into Bulgaria. They were\r\ndestined, however, to spend more than a year between the Danube and the\r\nBalkans before they could force their way into Rumelia.\r\n\r\nDuring the interval considerable progress was made with the settlement\r\nof the Greek question. The treaty of London in providing for the\r\nautonomy of Greece had specified no boundaries, and the first problem\r\ndemanding the attention of the powers that had assumed the task of the\r\nsettlement of Greece was to determine the limits within which that\r\nsettlement was to be effected. It might be urged that all the Greeks who\r\nhad accepted the armistice imposed by the powers in consequence of the\r\ntreaty of London had a right to share in the settlement at which that\r\ntreaty aimed. But the armistice had been broken by Greek attacks on\r\nChios and Crete, and Wellington held that the powers were, in\r\nconsequence, free from any obligation imposed by the nominal acceptance\r\nof the armistice. He, accordingly, desired to adopt the simple principle\r\nof granting the proposed autonomy to those parts of Greece in which the\r\ninsurrection had proved successful, namely, the Morea and the Ægean\r\nIslands, and refusing it in Northern and Central Greece, where the\r\nTurkish forces still held their own. But the British cabinet was far\r\nfrom being unanimous; many, among whom Palmerston was specially\r\nprominent, urged the concession of a greatly increased territory. The\r\nchanges which took place in the British ministry towards the end of May,\r\n1828, deprived Palmerston of his share in its deliberations, and by\r\nsubstituting Aberdeen for Dudley at the foreign office, placed our\r\nforeign relations under the direction of a man of talent and experience,\r\nwho had already exercised an important influence on British policy and\r\nwho was more in sympathy with the policy of the prime minister than\r\nDudley had been, but who was not content, like Dudley, to be a mere\r\ncipher in the department over which he was called to preside. Aberdeen,\r\nthough opposed to the narrow boundaries which Wellington wished to\r\nassign to liberated Greece, was no less antagonistic than his chief to\r\nany attempt to make the new Greek state politically important; and he\r\nwas even of opinion that the Russian declaration of war had released\r\nGreat Britain from any further obligation under the treaty of London.\r\n\r\nSuch were the composition and policy of the British government when the\r\nconference of London reassembled in July. The differences between the\r\npowers had prevented any active intervention in Greece, since the battle\r\nof Navarino. The ports in the Morea, still occupied by Ibrahim, had\r\nindeed been blockaded, but it had been found impossible to induce\r\nAustrian vessels to acknowledge a blockade of such questionable\r\nlegality, and the allied fleets had even permitted the embarkation of\r\nIbrahim's sick and wounded together with 5,500 Greek prisoners, who were\r\nsold into slavery on their arrival at Alexandria. The renewal of the\r\nconcert of the three powers was followed by a rapid change in the\r\nsituation. On the 19th it was decided that France should send an\r\nexpedition to expel the Turco-Egyptian troops from the Morea, while\r\nGreat Britain should render her any naval assistance that might be\r\nnecessary. This step was valued by the British government as definitely\r\ncommitting France to a share in the settlement of the Greek question,\r\nand therefore interesting that power in opposition to any attempt at a\r\nseparate settlement by Russia. It also furnished a safe outlet for\r\nFrench military ardour, disappointed by the results of the Spanish\r\nexpedition. In fact, the evacuation of Spain, which was in progress at\r\nthe date when this agreement was concluded, materially reduced the\r\nstrain which the new undertaking imposed upon the French government.\r\nFrance immediately prepared to send out a force amounting to nearly\r\n22,000 men. But before they could arrive, the greater part of their task\r\nhad been performed by other hands.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _TURKS EXPELLED FROM THE MOREA._]\r\n\r\nCodrington's conduct in permitting the embarkation of the Turkish sick\r\nand wounded with their prisoners had given great dissatisfaction at\r\nhome, and the cabinet had resolved on his recall before the ministerial\r\ncrisis of the latter part of May. That crisis occasioned a fortnight's\r\ndelay, and, in consequence, Codrington was able, before his successor\r\narrived, to make a naval demonstration before Alexandria and on August 6\r\nto obtain the consent of Mehemet Ali to the following proposals: an\r\nexchange of prisoners was to take place, involving the liberation of\r\nthe recently enslaved Greeks, and the Egyptian army was to be withdrawn\r\nfrom the Morea, but Ibrahim was to be allowed to leave behind 1,200\r\nEgyptian troops to help to garrison five fortresses which were held by\r\nthe Turks. Before either the new London protocol or the Alexandria\r\nconvention could be carried into effect, further differences had arisen.\r\nRussia had proclaimed a blockade of the Dardanelles and ordered her\r\nadmiral to carry it out. This proceeding was regarded by the British\r\ngovernment as a breach of faith and a menace to British commerce. It\r\nwas, however, impossible to abandon co-operation with Russia for fear\r\nthat the Greek question might become involved in the issues at stake\r\nbetween her and the Porte. Wellington, in consequence, contented himself\r\nwith obtaining certain exemptions from the operation of the blockade on\r\nbehalf of British subjects trading with Turkey, and with the exclusion\r\nof the Russian fleet from the operations conducted in the Mediterranean\r\nin accordance with the orders of the London conference. The French force\r\nfor expelling the Egyptians from the Morea arrived almost simultaneously\r\nwith the Egyptian transports for removing them. On October 5 Ibrahim set\r\nsail for Egypt, with 21,000 men, leaving 1,200 behind in the five\r\nfortresses in accordance with the terms settled at Alexandria. The\r\nFrench began their attack on the remaining fortresses two days later,\r\nand by the end of November had expelled all the Turks from the Morea. By\r\nthe terms of their engagements, they ought now to have departed. But it\r\nwas hardly to be expected that France would so readily abandon the\r\nadvantage that the presence of her troops gave her in the settlement of\r\nthe eastern question.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the negotiations made slow progress. On November 16 a protocol\r\nwas issued placing the Morea with the neighbouring islands under the\r\nguarantee of the powers. Wellington had opposed any extension of the\r\nguarantee to Central Greece on the ground that the allies had to provide\r\nboth the necessary military force and the cost of maintaining the Greek\r\ngovernment, so that any undertaking beyond the Morea would involve heavy\r\nexpense without rendering lighter the task of maintaining order. But the\r\nreal decision of the question lay not with the diplomatists at London,\r\nbut with the diplomatists on the spot. Representatives of the three\r\npowers had been sent to Poros to make detailed arrangements in\r\naccordance with the terms of the treaty of London. Stratford Canning,\r\nwho represented Great Britain, was one of the supporters of an extended\r\nfrontier, and in the end the ambassadors at Poros drew up a protocol in\r\nfavour of erecting Greece south of a line connecting the Gulfs of Arta\r\nand Volo into a hereditary principality, which was also to include\r\nnearly all the islands. Even Samos and Crete were recommended to the\r\nbenevolent consideration of the courts. All Mohammedans were to be\r\nexpelled from this territory. The tribute payable to Turkey was to be\r\nfixed at 1,500,000 piastres, but this was to be paid not to the Turkish\r\ngovernment, but to those who might suffer pecuniary loss by the\r\nconfiscation of lands hitherto owned by Mohammedans.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _PEACE OF ADRIANOPLE._]\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1829 was marked by events which went far to cancel the\r\narguments on which Wellington had based his case for a restricted\r\nfrontier. Not only the north coast of the Gulf of Corinth but Acarnania\r\nand Ætolia were liberated by the Greek forces under Sir Richard Church\r\nthe castle of Vonitza falling on March 17, Karavasara shortly\r\nafterwards, Lepanto on April 30, and Mesolongi on May 17.[97] Meanwhile\r\nthe terms agreed upon at Poros had been adopted and further defined by\r\nthe conference at London on March 22. It was now provided that the\r\nfuture hereditary prince was to be chosen by the three powers and the\r\nsultan conjointly, and that the terms were to be offered to the Porte by\r\nthe British and French ambassadors in the name of the three powers; any\r\nTurkish objections were to be weighed.[98] It was not till June that\r\nRobert Gordon and Guilleminot, representing Great Britain and France\r\nrespectively, were able to lay these proposals before the Porte, and it\r\nwas only after a Russian army under Diebitsch had crossed the Balkans\r\nthat the Porte on August 15 accepted them, and even then only with\r\nextensive modifications. These limited the new state to the Morea and\r\nthe adjacent islands, and left the tribute assigned to the same purposes\r\nas before the revolt; a limit was to be set to the military and naval\r\nforces of Greece, and Greeks were not to be allowed to migrate from\r\nTurkish dominions to the new state.\r\n\r\nWellington was of opinion that these concessions were adequate. He\r\nattached great importance to the consent of the Porte, to dispense with\r\nwhich seemed to him a sure method of encouraging a general revolt in the\r\nTurkish dominions; and he also advocated a limited frontier in the\r\ninterests of the Ionian Islands. He doubted whether it would be found\r\npossible to remove Capodistrias, who had been elected president of\r\nGreece for a period of seven years on April 14, 1827, from his office to\r\nmake room for a hereditary prince, and he felt sure that if Capodistrias\r\nwere once granted Central Greece he would not hesitate to attempt the\r\nconquest of the Ionian Islands. Capodistrias had in fact refused to\r\naccept any of the arrangements proposed by the London conference, and\r\nwas still engaged in the vigorous prosecution of the war. Wellington did\r\nnot, however, succeed in inducing France and Russia to remain content\r\nwith the Turkish concessions. Diebitsch's successful march through\r\nRumelia encouraged Russia to demand more, and filled the minds of the\r\nFrench ministers with the wildest schemes of aggression. They actually\r\nproposed to Russia that the northern part of the Balkan peninsula should\r\nbe divided between Austria and Russia while the whole peninsula south of\r\nthe Balkans, with Bulgaria to the north, was to be formed into a new\r\nstate under the sovereignty of the King of the Netherlands, whose\r\nhereditary dominions were in their turn to be divided between France,\r\nGreat Britain, and Prussia.\r\n\r\nSuch chimerical projects were based on the assumption that\r\nConstantinople lay at the mercy of the army of Diebitsch; and this was\r\nbelieved to be the case not only by the court of Paris, but by that of\r\nLondon, and even by that of Constantinople. But no one knew better than\r\nDiebitsch how precarious his situation was, and, if Russia wished to\r\nobtain advantageous terms, it was necessary for her to make the most of\r\nthe illusion while it lasted. On September 14 the peace of Adrianople\r\nwas signed, which established the virtual independence of the\r\nprincipalities of Moldavia and Wallachia and secured for all powers at\r\npeace with Turkey a free passage for merchant ships through the\r\nBosphorus and Dardanelles; Russia received a small addition to her\r\nAsiatic territories, and Turkey accepted both the treaty of London of\r\nJuly 6, 1827, and the protocol of London of March 22, 1829. The\r\ndifficulties raised by Turkey's opposition to the full terms of the\r\nprotocol were thus swept aside, and it was now clear that, if that\r\nprotocol was to be further modified, it would be modified out of regard\r\nfor the interests of Europe not by way of concession to Turkey. France\r\nand Great Britain were naturally averse from a settlement of the\r\nquestion by Russia alone, even when that settlement was on lines to\r\nwhich they had given their consent, and they might have been expected to\r\npropose some alteration in the scheme. But the conciliatory action of\r\nRussia rendered such proposals needless. On September 29, only fifteen\r\ndays after the treaty, Aberdeen received a formal proposal from Russia\r\nthat Turkey should be offered a restriction of the Greek boundary in\r\nreturn for a recognition of the total independence of Greece.[99] This\r\nproposal removed Wellington's fear that the new principality might be\r\nused as a basis for an attack on the Ionian Islands; while the\r\nmaintenance of Turkish suzerainty seemed less important after the\r\napparent prostration of Turkish military power in the recent war.\r\n\r\nIt now remained for the allied powers to select a prince to whom the new\r\ncrown should be offered. This subject engaged their attention from\r\nOctober, 1829, to January, 1830. Finally, Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg,\r\nwidower of the Princess Charlotte, was selected, greatly to the\r\nannoyance of King George IV. On February 3 Prince Leopold was formally\r\noffered the sovereignty of Greece as an independent state, bounded on\r\nthe north by a line drawn from the mouth of the Aspropotamo to\r\nThermopylæ. Before accepting the crown he made an effort to obtain a\r\nstronger position for its future prince. He asked for a complete\r\nguarantee of independence from the three powers, some security for the\r\nGreek inhabitants of Crete and Samos, an extension of the boundary to\r\nthe north, and financial and military support. The powers on February 20\r\ndecided to grant the guarantee and a loan of £2,400,000, and to allow\r\nthe French troops to remain in Greece for another year, but refused the\r\nextension of territory and would not recognise the right of the Greek\r\nstate to interfere in the affairs of Crete and Samos. Leopold accepted\r\nthe crown on these conditions on February 24, and they were accepted by\r\nthe Porte on April 24. Capodistrias, who had no desire to make way for\r\nanother ruler, invited Leopold to the country, but suggested that he\r\nwould not be well received and that he would have to change his\r\nreligion.[100] These considerations, combined with other causes, induced\r\nhim to renounce the crown on May 21.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _FRANCE CONQUERS ALGERIA._]\r\n\r\nOne other foreign event exercised the minds of Wellington's cabinet\r\nduring the last months of George IV.'s reign. This was the French\r\npunitive expedition to Algiers, which resulted In the conquest of that\r\nstate. The expedition was originally planned in concert with Mehemet Ali\r\nof Egypt, and appeared to Wellington to be prompted by the idea that the\r\ndefeat of the Turks by Russia afforded a convenient opportunity for a\r\npartition of Turkish territory. The British government was able by means\r\nof diplomatic pressure to induce Mehemet Ali to refrain from\r\nco-operating, but it could not deny the justice of the French expedition\r\nor prevent it from sailing.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[93] Stapleton, _Life of Canning_, iii., 220-25, 227-35.\r\n\r\n[94] See Lloyd, _Transactions of the Royal Historical Society_, N.S.,\r\nxviii.

While Ireland was torn by faction, and\r\nthe Orangemen of Ulster rivalled in lawlessness the catholics of the\r\nother provinces, England was undergoing another period of agricultural\r\nand commercial depression. The harvest of 1829 was late and bad; the\r\nwinter that followed was the severest known for sixteen years; and a\r\nfresh series of outrages was committed by the distressed operatives,\r\nespecially by the silk weavers in the east of London and the mill hands\r\nin the midland counties. In the district of Huddersfield, where the\r\npeople bore their sufferings with admirable patience, a committee of\r\nmasters stated as a fact that \"there were 13,000 individuals who had not\r\nmore than twopence half-penny a day to live on\". When parliament met on\r\nFebruary 4, 1830, the prevailing distress was recognised in the king's\r\nspeech, but in guarded terms, and the ministers attributed it in the\r\nmain, probably with justice, to unavoidable causes. This gave the\r\nenemies of free trade and currency reform an opportunity of renewing\r\ntheir protests against Peel's and Huskisson's financial policy. They\r\nfailed to effect their object, but Goulburn, the chancellor of the\r\nexchequer, initiated a considerable reduction of expenditure and\r\nremission of taxes. The excise duties on beer, cider, and leather were\r\nnow totally remitted, those on spirits being somewhat increased. The\r\ngovernment even deliberated on the proposal of a property tax, and,\r\nstimulated by a motion of Sir James Graham, actually carried out large\r\nsavings in official salaries. On the whole, this session was the most\r\nfruitful in economy since the conclusion of the peace. The system of\r\njudicature, too, was subjected to a salutary revision throughout Great\r\nBritain by the amalgamation of the English and Welsh benches, and the\r\nconcentration of courts in Scotland. As the charter of the East Indian\r\nCompany was about to expire, a strong committee was appointed to\r\nconsider the whole subject of its territorial powers and commercial\r\nprivileges. This committee was not the least beneficial result of a\r\nsession which has left no great mark on the statute-book.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _MOVEMENT FOR REFORM._]\r\n\r\nThe weakness of Wellington's position had long since become apparent to\r\nall. By his conduct in regard to catholic emancipation he had estranged\r\na powerful section of his tory followers. By his jealousy and haughty\r\nattitude towards his whig allies, he had forfeited their good-will,\r\nnever very heartily given. By his treatment of Huskisson, a small but\r\nable body of politicians was thrown into the ranks of a discordant\r\nopposition. No one else could have induced the king to give way on\r\ncatholic emancipation, but the king had not forgiven him, and submitted\r\nto him out of fear rather than out of confidence. Though singularly\r\ndeficient in rhetorical power, he still maintained his ascendency in the\r\nhouse of lords by the aid of more eloquent colleagues, but Peel was his\r\nonly efficient lieutenant in the house of commons. The vacancy in the\r\noffice of lord privy seal, occasioned by the transference of\r\nEllenborough to the board of control, had at last been filled in June,\r\n1829, by the appointment of Lord Rosslyn, nephew of the first earl, who,\r\nhowever, added nothing to the strength of the ministry. In the meantime,\r\nreform had succeeded catholic emancipation as the one burning question\r\nof politics, but with this all-important difference that it roused\r\nenthusiasm in the popular mind. Political unions, like the branches of\r\nthe catholic association, were springing up all over the country, and a\r\nseries of motions was made in the house of commons which feebly\r\nreflected the feverish agitation in all the active centres of\r\npopulation. One of these, brought forward by the Marquis of Blandford,\r\nwho had made a similar motion in the previous year, was really prompted\r\nby enmity against the author of catholic emancipation. Another,\r\nintroduced by Lord Howick, son of Earl Grey, called for some general and\r\ncomprehensive measure to remedy the admitted abuses of the electoral\r\nsystem. A third, and far more practical, attempt was made by Lord John\r\nRussell to obtain the enfranchisement of Manchester, Leeds, and\r\nBirmingham. A fourth, and perfectly futile proposal, was made by\r\nO'Connell, in the shape of a bill for triennial parliaments, universal\r\nsuffrage, and vote by ballot, to which Russell moved a statesmanlike\r\namendment, in favour of transferring members from petty boroughs to\r\ncounties and great unrepresented towns. All these motions were defeated\r\nby larger or smaller majorities, but no one doubted that parliamentary\r\nreform was inevitable, and few can have imagined that Wellington was\r\neither willing or competent to grapple with it.\r\n\r\nWhile domestic affairs were in this state, George IV. died. His\r\nconstitution, weakened by many years of self-indulgence, had been\r\nfurther depressed by a growing sense of loneliness and by the long\r\nstruggle with his ministers over catholic emancipation. On April 15 his\r\nillness had been made public, and on May 24 it had been necessary to\r\nbring in a bill, authorising the use of a stamp, to be affixed in his\r\npresence in lieu of the royal sign manual. A month later, the disease of\r\nthe heart from which he suffered took a fatal turn, and on June 26 he\r\npassed away, not without dignity, in the sixty-eighth year of his age.\r\nPerhaps no other English king has been so harshly judged by posterity,\r\nnor is it possible to acquit him of moral vices which outweighed all his\r\nmerits, considerable as they were. The Duke of Wellington, who knew him\r\nas well as any man, declared that he was a marvellous compound of\r\nvirtues and defects, but that, on the whole, the good elements\r\npreponderated. Peel, who had become by his father's death Sir Robert,\r\ntestified in Parliament that he \"never exercised, or wished to exercise,\r\na prerogative of the crown, except for the advantage of his people\".\r\nThese estimates assuredly err on the side of charity, and are quite\r\ninconsistent with other statements of the duke himself.\r\n\r\nGeorge IV., it is true, possessed many royal gifts. He was a man of no\r\nordinary ability, with a fine presence, courtly manners, various\r\naccomplishments, and clear-sighted intelligence on every subject within\r\nthe sphere of his duties. But all these kingly qualities were marred by\r\na heartlessness which rendered him incapable of true love or friendship,\r\nand a duplicity which made it impossible for him to retain the respect\r\nof his ministers. His private life was not wholly unlike that of the\r\nRegent Orléans and had much the same influence on the society of the\r\nmetropolis. He was an undutiful son, a bad husband, a perfidious friend,\r\nwith little sense of truth or honour, and destitute of that public\r\nspirit which atoned for the political obstinacy of his father. No one\r\nsincerely regretted his death, except the favourites who had been\r\nenriched by his extravagance, and actually succeeded in carrying off a\r\nlarge booty out of the valuables that he had amassed. Nevertheless, his\r\nregency is identified with a glorious period in our military history,\r\nand his reign ushered in a new age of reform and national prosperity. In\r\nthe great struggle against Napoleon and the pacification of Europe he\r\ngave his ministers a cordial and effective support. To catholic\r\nemancipation he was honestly opposed, but he kept his opposition within\r\nconstitutional limits, and his intense selfishness did not exclude a\r\ncertain sentiment of philanthropy and even of patriotism.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE ACCESSION OF WILLIAM IV._]\r\n\r\nHis successor, William IV., was greatly inferior to him intellectually,\r\nand infinitely less conversant with the business of state. Most of this\r\nprince's early life was spent at sea, where he saw a fair share of\r\nservice, and became the friend of Nelson, but incurred his father's\r\ndispleasure by infringing the rules of discipline. Having been created\r\nDuke of Clarence in 1789, he was rapidly promoted in the navy, but\r\nremained on shore without employment for some forty years before his\r\naccession, taking an occasional part in debates of the house of lords,\r\nand generally acting with the whig party. During this long period he was\r\nlittle regarded by his future subjects, and led a somewhat obscure life,\r\nat first in the company of Mrs. Jordan, by whom he had a numerous\r\nfamily. After his marriage with the Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen\r\nin 1818, he became a more important personage, and, as we have seen, was\r\nmade lord high admiral by Canning, but held office for little more than\r\na year. He was thus entirely destitute of political training, and was\r\nliving in privacy when he was called to ascend the throne on the eve of\r\na singularly momentous crisis.\r\n\r\nThe session was prolonged until July 23, when parliament was prorogued\r\nby the new king in person, and on the following day a dissolution was\r\nproclaimed, the writs being made returnable on September 14. During the\r\nmonth that elapsed between the death of George IV. and the prorogation,\r\nno serious business was done, but the leaders of opposition in both\r\nhouses moved to provide for a regency, in view of a possible demise of\r\nthe crown before a fresh parliament could be assembled. This course was\r\nclearly dictated by the highest expediency, for, had the king's life\r\nbeen cut short suddenly, the young Princess Victoria, then eleven years\r\nold, would have become sovereign with full powers, but without\r\nprotection against the baleful influence of her uncle, the Duke of\r\nCumberland, the least trustworthy person in the realm. In advocating it,\r\nhowever, the whigs showed an evident disposition to win the favour of\r\nWilliam IV., who had never broken away, like his predecessor, from his\r\nwhig connexion. These motions were defeated, but the opposition gained\r\npopularity at the expense of the government, by raising debates on\r\ncertain state prosecutions for libel, and on the question of colonial\r\nslavery. Their position was further strengthened by a widespread\r\nimpression that the king himself was a reformer at heart, and would\r\nseize an early opportunity of declaring his sentiments. His weakness had\r\nnot yet disclosed itself, while his kindliness earned him golden\r\nopinions, as he \"walked in London streets with his umbrella under his\r\narm, and gave a frank and sailor-like greeting to all old\r\nacquaintances\".\r\n\r\nThe election of 1830, following close on the revolution of July in\r\nParis, was the death-blow of the old tory rule in England. The\r\nwidespread sympathy which the original uprising of 1789 had excited\r\namong Englishmen, but which the atrocities of jacobinism had quenched,\r\nwas now revived by the comparatively bloodless victory of constitutional\r\nprinciples and the accession of a citizen-king in France. The growing\r\nenthusiasm for reform, thus stimulated, exercised a decisive effect in\r\nall the constituencies except the pocket-boroughs. Brougham was returned\r\nwithout opposition for Yorkshire, and Hume by a large majority for\r\nMiddlesex, two brothers of Sir Robert Peel lost their seats, and Croker\r\nwas defeated for Dublin University. Distrust of the government was\r\nequally shown in the counties and in the great cities, but in some\r\ninstances ultra-tories were elected, in revenge for catholic\r\nemancipation or for alleged neglect of agricultural interests. It was\r\ncalculated that fifty seats, in all, had changed hands, and the\r\nparliament which assembled in October 26 was very different in\r\nconstitution and temper from any of those which supported tory\r\nministries with unshaken constancy during the great war and the long\r\nperiod of agitation consequent on the peace.\r\n\r\nThe losses of the government in Great Britain, partly due to its Irish\r\npolicy, were not compensated by any gain in Ireland, which did not fail\r\nto display the ingratitude so often experienced by its benefactors.\r\nCatholic emancipation was now treated as a vantage ground on which the\r\nbattle of repeal might be waged. Association after association was\r\nformed by O'Connell, only to be put down by proclamation and to\r\nre-appear under another name. The worst passions of the people were\r\neffectually roused, assassinations became frequent, and Peel's\r\ncorrespondence with Hardinge, then chief secretary, shows that he fully\r\nrecognised the failure of his experiment, as a cure for Irish\r\nanarchy.[101] In the course of this new agitation, O'Connell used most\r\noffensive expressions for which Hardinge called him to account. The\r\nchief secretary's act may have been unjustifiable, but the shuffling and\r\nfaint-hearted conduct of O'Connell in declining this and later\r\nchallenges provoked by his foul language was fatal to his reputation for\r\ncourage. The most insolent of bullies, he never failed to consult his\r\nown personal safety, by professing conscientious objections to duelling,\r\nas well as by keeping just outside the meshes of the criminal law.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE DEATH OF HUSKISSON._]\r\n\r\nA few weeks before parliament met a tragical accident closed the life of\r\nHuskisson, whose death was rendered all the more impressive by its\r\ncircumstances. In 1825 the idea of railways for the rapid conveyance of\r\ngoods and passengers bore fruit in an act for the construction of a line\r\nbetween Liverpool and Manchester. It was not in itself a new idea, for\r\ntramways had long been in use, and so far back as 1814 George Stephenson\r\nhad constructed a locomotive engine for a colliery. But it was generally\r\nbelieved that such engines must always be limited to a speed of a few\r\nmiles an hour, and even the great engineer, Telford, giving evidence\r\nbefore a committee in 1825, did not venture to speak of a higher maximum\r\nspeed than fifteen or twenty miles an hour. Few indeed were far-sighted\r\nenough to credit this estimate, and the incredulity of ignorance was\r\naided by the forces of self-interest, for the profits of canals,\r\nstage-coaches, and carriers' vans were directly threatened by the\r\ninnovation of railways. However, George Stephenson quietly persevered,\r\nand from the moment that his pioneer engine, the \"Rocket,\" won the prize\r\nin a great competition of locomotives, \"the old modes of transit were\r\nchanged throughout the whole civilised world\". On September 15, 1830,\r\nthe first public trial of this and other engines was made at the opening\r\nof the Liverpool and Manchester railway. Wellington, Peel, and other\r\neminent personages were present, among whom was Huskisson, just returned\r\nfor Liverpool. Two trains proceeded towards Manchester on parallel\r\nlines, and stopped at the Parkgate station. There several passengers got\r\nout, and Huskisson was making his way to shake hands with the duke when\r\nhe was struck by a carriage of the other train, already in movement,\r\nfell upon the rails, and was fatally crushed. He bore his sufferings\r\nwith great fortitude, but died during the night at a neighbouring\r\nvicarage to which he was carried. He could ill be spared by his party,\r\nfor, though he was not the man to ride the storm which raged over the\r\nreform bill, his counsels might have saved the whigs from the just\r\nreproach of financial incapacity and have hastened the advent of free\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _WELLINGTON ON REFORM._]\r\n\r\nThe winter session of 1830 opened with an ominous calm. It was believed\r\nthat private negotiations were going on between the ministry and the\r\nsurvivors of Canning's following, which might result in a moderate\r\nscheme of parliamentary reform. These expectations were utterly\r\ndiscomfited by the king's speech delivered on November 2. It has\r\nunjustly been described as \"the most offensive that had been uttered by\r\nany monarch since the revolution\". On the contrary, it was tame and\r\ncolourless for the most part, recording his majesty's resolution to\r\nuphold treaties and enforce order in the United Kingdom, but welcoming\r\nthe new French monarchy in terms which Grey emphatically commended. It\r\ngave offence to liberals by describing the revolutionary movement in\r\nBelgium as a \"revolt\"; but what called forth an immediate outburst of\r\npopular resentment was its significant reticence on the subject of\r\nreform. This resentment was aggravated tenfold by the Duke of\r\nWellington's celebrated speech in the lords, declaring against any\r\nreform whatever. The duke always refused to admit that this declaration\r\nwas the cause of his subsequent fall, which he attributed, by\r\npreference, to his adoption of catholic emancipation. Speaking\r\ndeliberately in reply to Grey, who had indicated reform as the only true\r\nremedy for popular discontent, the duke stated that no measure of reform\r\nyet proposed would, in his opinion, improve the representative system\r\nthen existing, which, he said, \"answered all the good purposes of\r\nlegislation\" to a greater degree than \"any legislature in any country\r\nwhatever\". He went further, and avowed his conviction not only that this\r\nsystem \"possessed the full and entire confidence of the country,\" but\r\nalso that no better system could be devised by the wit of man. Its\r\nspecial virtue, according to him, consisted in the fact of its producing\r\na representative assembly which \"contained a large body of the property\r\nof the country, and in which the landed interests had a preponderating\r\ninfluence\". Finally, he protested that he would never bring forward a\r\nreform measure himself, and that \"he should always feel it his duty to\r\nresist such measures when proposed by others\".\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to suppose that the duke had consulted any of his\r\ncolleagues before making this declaration. Indeed, it is known that Peel\r\nhad just before received a confidential offer of co-operation in\r\ncarrying a moderate reform bill from Palmerston, Edward Stanley,\r\ngrandson of the Earl of Derby, Sir James Graham, and the Grants; nor had\r\nthese overtures been definitely rejected.[102] Some lame attempts were\r\nmade to clear the cabinet, as a whole, from responsibility for their\r\nchief's outspoken opinions, and Peel cautiously limited himself to a\r\ndoubt whether any safe measure of reform would satisfy the reformers.\r\nBut he would not separate himself from Wellington, and Wellington's\r\nultimatum remained unretracted.\r\n\r\nBrougham at once gave notice of his intention to bring forward the\r\nquestion of parliamentary reform in a fortnight. In the meantime the\r\nduke had committed a mistake which irritated the people, and especially\r\nthe inhabitants of London. It happened that the king and queen, with the\r\nministers, were engaged to dine with the lord mayor on November 9. Three\r\ndays earlier, the lord mayor-elect warned the prime minister that a riot\r\nwas apprehended on that occasion, that an attempt would probably be\r\nmade to assassinate him, and that it would be desirable to come attended\r\nby a strong military guard. Upon this intimation, confirmed by others,\r\nthe cabinet most unwisely decided not to surround the mansion house with\r\na large armed force, but to put off the king's visit to the city. A\r\npanic naturally ensued, consols fell three per cent. in an hour and a\r\nhalf, and the disorderly classes achieved a victory without running the\r\nsmallest risk. There were local disturbances in the evening, and the\r\nduke arranged to join Peel at the home office, in case decisive measures\r\nshould be required, but the new police were too strong for the mob, and\r\nthe whole affair passed off quietly, though not without involving the\r\ngovernment in some ridicule. The Marquis Wellesley, now in opposition to\r\nhis brother, declared the postponement of the dinner to be \"the boldest\r\nact of cowardice\" within his knowledge.\r\n\r\nIf Wellington sought to conciliate the ultra-tories by his unfortunate\r\nspeech, he was soon undeceived. While Brougham's motion was pending, the\r\ngovernment proposed a revision of the civil list which purported to\r\neffect slight economies for the benefit of the public. It was objected,\r\nhowever, that a greater reduction of charges should have been\r\ncontemplated, and that parliament should have been invited to deal with\r\nthe revenues derived from the duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster, which,\r\nas Peel explained, formed no part of those placed at the disposal of\r\nparliament. Sir Henry Parnell moved to refer the civil list to a select\r\ncommittee; the chancellor of the exchequer directly opposed the motion,\r\nand, after a short discussion, a division was taken on November 15. The\r\nresult, which had been foreseen, was a majority of twenty-nine against\r\nthe government in a house of 437 members. There were many defections\r\namong the discontented tories, and the Wellington ministry preferred to\r\nfall on an issue of minor importance, rather than await a decisive\r\ncontest on the reform question. On the following day, therefore, both\r\nthe duke and Peel announced the acceptance of their resignations, and it\r\nwas known that Grey had received the king's command to form a new\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _GREY ACCEPTS OFFICE._]\r\n\r\nGrey was the inevitable head of any cabinet empowered to carry\r\nparliamentary reform. His dignified presence, his stately eloquence, his\r\nunblemished character, and his parliamentary experience, marked him out\r\nfor leadership, and disguised his want of practical acquaintance with\r\nthe middle and lower classes of his countrymen. His political career,\r\nranging over forty-four years, though not destitute of errors, had been\r\nperfectly consistent. From the first he was a staunch adherent of Fox;\r\nhe was among the managers who conducted the prosecution of Warren\r\nHastings; his connexion with the Society of the Friends of the People,\r\nand his advocacy of reform during Pitt's first administration are\r\ndescribed in the preceding volume of this history. On Pitt's death he\r\nbecame closely associated with Grenville; it will be remembered that he\r\njoined his short-lived government, originally as first lord of the\r\nadmiralty, and afterwards as Fox's successor at the foreign office. It\r\nwas he who carried through the house of commons the bill for the\r\nabolition of the slave trade, and it may truly be said that, in\r\nopposition, he was equally persistent in supporting every measure in\r\nfavour of liberty, political or commercial, and in resisting every\r\nmeasure, necessary or otherwise, which could be interpreted as\r\nrestricting it. We have seen how he more than once declined overtures\r\nfor a coalition with his opponents, and showed a bitter personal\r\nantipathy to Canning, whom he was more than suspected of despising as a\r\nbrilliant plebeian adventurer. This suspicion of aristocratic prejudice,\r\nill harmonising with democratic principles, had never been quite\r\ndispelled, and was now to be confirmed by the composition of his own\r\ncabinet.\r\n\r\nAll the members of this cabinet, with four exceptions, sat in the house\r\nof lords. No cabinet had contained so few commoners since the\r\nreconstruction of Liverpool's ministry in 1822. Of the four who now sat\r\nin the house of commons, Lord Althorp was heir-apparent to an earldom;\r\nLord Palmerston was an Irish peer; Graham was a baronet of great\r\nterritorial influence; Charles Grant was still a commoner, though he was\r\nafterwards raised to the peerage. In the distribution of offices, full\r\njustice was done to Canning's followers. Three of these occupied posts\r\nof the highest importance, Palmerston at the foreign office, Lamb, who\r\nhad succeeded his father as Viscount Melbourne in 1828, at the home\r\noffice, and Goderich at the colonial office, while Grant became\r\npresident of the board of control. The selection of Graham as first lord\r\nof the admiralty did not escape criticism, but was due to his tried\r\nenergy in financial reform, and was justified by the result. Lansdowne\r\nwas made president of the council, and Holland chancellor of the duchy\r\nof Lancaster. Both of these had been Grey's colleagues in the\r\nadministration of \"All the Talents\". Althorp, who succeeded Goulburn at\r\nthe exchequer, and Carlisle, who accepted a seat in the cabinet without\r\noffice, were both whigs of tried fidelity. But the Duke of Richmond, the\r\nnew postmaster-general, was a deserter from the tory ranks, and Lord\r\nDurham, the premier's son-in-law, the new lord privy seal, was a radical\r\nof the most aggressive type, well qualified, as the event proved, to\r\ndisturb the peace of any council to which he might be admitted. Three\r\noccupants of places outside the cabinet remain to be mentioned. One of\r\nthese, the Marquis Wellesley, had been a warm supporter of catholic\r\nemancipation when the Duke of Wellington stoutly opposed it, and his\r\nbrother's conversion on that question had not affected his own relations\r\nwith the whig party, which now welcomed him as lord steward. Lord John\r\nRussell, the new paymaster of the forces, had identified himself as\r\nprominently as Grey himself with the promotion of parliamentary reform,\r\nand Stanley, the new chief secretary for Ireland, was probably selected\r\nfor his brilliant powers in debate, as the natural and most worthy\r\nantagonist of the great demagogue, O'Connell.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _BROUGHAM BECOMES CHANCELLOR._]\r\n\r\nBut the most formidable of all the \"radical reformers\" still remained to\r\nbe conciliated, and provided with a post which might satisfy his\r\nrestless ambition. At the end of 1830 Brougham was in the plenitude of\r\nhis marvellous powers, and in the zenith of his unique popularity. As\r\nmember for the great county of York, returned free of expense on the\r\nshoulders of the people, he already occupied the foremost position among\r\nBritish commoners, and it was feared that he might use it for his own\r\npurposes in a dictatorial spirit. He had recently declared in Yorkshire\r\nthat \"nothing on earth should ever tempt him to accept place,\" and that\r\nhe was conscious of the power to compel the execution of measures which,\r\nbefore that democratic election, he could only \"ventilate\". So late as\r\nNovember 16, he assured the house of commons that \"no change in the\r\nadministration could by any possibility affect him,\" adding that he\r\nwould bring forward his motion for parliamentary reform on the 25th,\r\nwhatever might then be the state of affairs, and whatever ministers\r\nshould then be in office. The great whig peers were most anxious to\r\nkeep him out of the cabinet without losing his support, or, still worse,\r\nprovoking his active hostility. With this view, Grey indiscreetly\r\noffered him the attorney-generalship, and we cannot be surprised that\r\nBrougham rejected the offer with some indignation and disdain. It was no\r\nsecret that his supreme desire was to become master of the rolls--an\r\noffice compatible with a seat in the house of commons--but his future\r\ncolleagues well knew that, in that case, they would be at his mercy in\r\nthe house. Thereupon it was suggested, probably by the king himself,\r\nthat it might be the less of two dangers to entrust him with the great\r\nseal, which Lord Lyndhurst was quite prepared to resume under a fourth\r\npremier. Accordingly, it was known on November 20 that Brougham was to\r\nbe the whig lord chancellor, and on the 22nd he actually took his place\r\non the woolsack. His title was Baron Brougham and Vaux, but, though he\r\nlived to retain it for nearly forty years, he always preferred, with\r\npardonable vanity, to sign his name as \"Henry Brougham\".\r\n\r\nBefore the close of 1830 the new ministers found time to carry a regency\r\nbill, whereby the Duchess of Kent (unless she married a foreigner) was\r\nto be regent in the event of the Princess Victoria succeeding to the\r\ncrown during her minority. Having adopted the watchword of \"Peace,\r\nRetrenchment, and Reform,\" they gave an earnest of their zeal for\r\nretrenchment by instituting a parliamentary inquiry into the possible\r\nreduction of official salaries, including their own. The defeat of\r\nStanley by \"Orator\" Hunt at Preston was a warning against undue reliance\r\non popular confidence, for Preston was already a highly democratic\r\nconstituency, largely composed of ignorant \"potwallopers\". A similar but\r\nmore emphatic warning came from Ireland, where O'Connell did his utmost\r\nto insult and defy Anglesey, the new lord-lieutenant, in spite of his\r\nsacrifices for catholic emancipation, and his well-known sympathy with\r\nthe cause of reform. In the southern counties of England, too, violent\r\ndisturbances had broken out, and were marked by all the ferocity and\r\nterrorism characteristic of luddism in the manufacturing districts. They\r\nspread from Kent, Sussex, and Surrey into Hampshire, Wiltshire,\r\nBerkshire, and Buckinghamshire. In these four counties there was a\r\nwanton and wholesale destruction of agricultural machinery, of\r\nfarm-buildings, and especially of ricks, as if the misery of labourers\r\ncould possibly be cured by impoverishing their only employers. The\r\nrioters moved about in large organised bodies, and their anarchical\r\npassions were deliberately inflamed by the writings of unscrupulous men\r\nlike Cobbett and Carlile.\r\n\r\nHappily, the ministers showed no sign of the weakness upon which the\r\nringleaders had probably calculated. They promptly issued a proclamation\r\ndeclaring their resolution to put down lawless outrage, and promised\r\neffective support to the lords-lieutenant of the disturbed counties.\r\nActing upon this assurance, Wellington himself went down to Hampshire,\r\nand took a leading part in quelling disorder. The government next\r\nappointed a special commission, which tried many hundreds of prisoners\r\nand sentenced the worst to death, though few were executed. This vigour\r\nsoon overawed the organised gangs which, in one or two instances, had\r\nonly been dispersed by military force. Finally, they prosecuted Carlile\r\nand Cobbett for instigating the poor labourers to crime. The former was\r\nconvicted at the Old Bailey, and condemned to a long term of\r\nimprisonment, with a heavy fine. The trial of Cobbett was postponed\r\nuntil the following July, when the frenzy of reform was at its height.\r\nHe defended himself with great audacity in a speech of six hours,\r\ncalling the lord chancellor with other leading reformers as witnesses,\r\nand succeeded in escaping conviction by the disagreement and discharge\r\nof the jury.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _ALTHORP'S FIRST BUDGET._]\r\n\r\nTwo other questions engaged the attention of parliament on the eve of\r\nthe great struggle over the reform bill. One of these was the settlement\r\nof the civil list, which the Duke of Wellington's ministry had failed to\r\neffect. William IV. was not an avaricious sovereign, nor did he share\r\nthe spendthrift inclination of his brother. But he was disposed to\r\nstickle for the hereditary rights of the crown, both public and private,\r\nand he greatly disliked the details of his expenditure being scrutinised\r\nby a parliamentary committee. Now, Grey and his colleagues stood pledged\r\nto such a committee, and could not avoid promoting its appointment. They\r\npropitiated the king, however, by excluding the revenues of the Duchy of\r\nLancaster from the inquiry, and ultimately succeeded in persuading the\r\nhouse of commons to grant a civil list of £510,000 a year. But the\r\npublication of a return containing a complete list of sinecure offices\r\nand pensions was turned to good account by the economists, and produced\r\nan outburst of public indignation, which was by no means unreasonable.\r\nGreat results were expected from the report of the select committee on\r\nthe civil list, which revised the salaries of officials in the royal\r\nhousehold, as well as the emoluments of pensioners. It was even demanded\r\nthat no regard should be paid to vested interests, but Grey firmly\r\nsupported the private remonstrances of the king against such an act of\r\nconfiscation. In fact, the savings recommended by the committee were so\r\ntrifling that it was thought better to waive the question for the time,\r\nand the first economical essay of the new _régime_ ended in failure.\r\n\r\nThe budget introduced by Althorp soon after the meeting of parliament on\r\nFebruary 3, 1831, and in anticipation of the reform bill, was equally\r\nunsuccessful as a specimen of whig finance. Finding that, after all, he\r\ncould not effect a saving of more than one million on the national\r\nexpenditure, as reduced by his capable predecessor, Goulburn, he\r\nnevertheless proposed to repeal the duties on coals, tallow candles,\r\nprinted cottons, and glass, as well as to diminish by one half the\r\nduties on newspapers and tobacco. To meet the deficit thus created, he\r\ndesigned an increase of the wine and timber duties, new taxation of raw\r\ncotton, and, above all, a tax of ten shillings per cent. on all\r\ntransfers of real or funded property. This last proposal was at once\r\ndenounced by Goulburn, Peel, and Sugden, the late solicitor-general, as\r\na breach of public faith between the state and its creditors. Their\r\nprotests were loudly echoed by the city, and the obnoxious transfer duty\r\nwas abandoned. The same fate befell the proposed increase of the timber\r\nduties, and Althorp only carried his budget after submitting to further\r\nmodifications. Those who had relied on his promises of economical reform\r\nwere signally disappointed, and, had not parliamentary reform\r\novershadowed all other issues, the credit of the government would have\r\nbeen rudely shaken in the first session after its formation. But this\r\ngreat struggle, now to be described, so engrossed the attention of the\r\ncountry, that little room was left for the consideration of other\r\ninterests, until it should be decided.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that no great measure was ever preceded by so thorough a\r\npreparation of the public mind as the reform bills of 1831-32. Ever\r\nsince the early part of the eighteenth century the abuses of the\r\nrepresentative system had been freely acknowledged, and no one attempted\r\nto defend them in principle. The multitude of close boroughs, the\r\nsmallness of the electoral body, the sale of seats in parliament, the\r\nwide prevalence of gross bribery, and the enormous expense of\r\nelections--these were notorious evils which no one denied, though some\r\npalliated them, and few ventured to assail them in earnest by drastic\r\nproposals, lest they should undermine the constitution. So far back as\r\n1770 Chatham had denounced them, and predicted that unless parliament\r\nreformed itself from within before the end of the century, it would be\r\nreformed \"with a vengeance\" from without. In 1780 the Duke of Richmond\r\nhad introduced a bill in favour of universal suffrage, and Pitt had\r\nbrought forward bills or motions in favour of parliamentary reform as a\r\nprivate member in 1782 and 1783, and as prime minister in 1785. But the\r\nFrench revolution persuaded him that the time was not favourable to\r\nreform, and he successfully opposed Grey's motion for referring a number\r\nof petitions in favour of reform to a committee in 1793.\r\n\r\nAfter this, a strong reaction set in, and the reform question had little\r\ninterest for the governing classes during the continuance of the great\r\nwar. It was never allowed to sleep, however, and in 1809, a bill\r\nintroduced by Curwen to pave the way for reform by preventing the return\r\nof members upon corrupt agreements, actually passed both houses, though\r\nin so mutilated a form that it was practically a dead letter. Still, the\r\ncause was indefatigably pleaded by Brand, and Burdett, who in 1819 made\r\nhimself the spokesman of the violent reform agitation then spreading\r\nover the country. Unfortunately, this violence, and the extravagance of\r\nthe demands put forward by the democratic leaders, were themselves fatal\r\nobstacles to a temperate consideration of the question, and threw back\r\nthe reform movement for several years. In 1821, when Grampound was\r\ndisfranchised, it assumed, as we have seen, a more constitutional form,\r\nand motions in favour of reform were proposed by Russell in 1822, 1823,\r\nand 1826, and by Blandford in 1829. Had Canning placed himself at the\r\nhead of the movement the course of domestic history during the reign of\r\nGeorge IV. might have been very different. As it was, the number of\r\npetitions in favour of reform sensibly fell off in the last half of the\r\nreign, and its tory opponents vainly imagined that the movement had\r\nspent itself. We now know that, in the absence of noisy demonstrations,\r\nit was really and constantly gaining strength in the minds of thoughtful\r\nmen until it reached its climax at the end of 1830.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _PUBLIC OPINION AND REFORM._]\r\n\r\nThe first act of the great political drama which occupied the next\r\neighteen months may be said to have opened with the fall of Wellington,\r\nand the formation of the whig ministry. These events, together with the\r\nsuccess of the Paris revolution, supplied the motive power needed to\r\ncombine the great body of the middle classes with the proletariat in a\r\nnational crusade against the political privileges long exercised by a\r\npowerful landed aristocracy. It is true that reform, unlike catholic\r\nemancipation, had always appealed to broad popular sympathies, and had\r\nbeen advocated by men like Grey and Burdett as carrying with it the\r\nredress of all other grievances. But Canning was by no means the only\r\nliberal statesman who heartily dreaded it, and even the advanced\r\nreformers had not fully grasped the comprehensive meaning of the idea\r\nwhich they embraced, or the far-reaching consequences involved in it.\r\nThe palpable anomaly of Old Sarum returning members to parliament, while\r\nBirmingham was unrepresented, was shocking to common sense, and so was\r\nthe monopoly of the franchise by a handful of electors in some of the\r\nlarger boroughs, especially in Scotland. But few appreciated how\r\nseriously constitutional liberty had been curtailed by the growth of\r\nthese abuses (unchecked by the Commonwealth) since the fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth centuries, how effectually home and foreign policy was\r\ncontrolled by a small circle of noble families dominant in the lower as\r\nwell as in the upper chamber, how vast a transfer of sovereignty from\r\nclass to class would inevitably be wrought by a thorough reform bill,\r\nand how certainly men newly entrusted with power would use it for their\r\nown advantage, whether or not that should coincide with the advantage of\r\nthe nation. Such general aspects of the question are seldom noticed in\r\nthe earlier debates upon it, and economical reform sometimes appears to\r\noccupy a larger space than parliamentary reform in the liberal\r\nstatesmanship of the Georgian age.\r\n\r\nWith Wellington's declaration against any parliamentary reform, this\r\napathy vanished, and the movement, gathering up into itself all other\r\npopular aspirations thenceforward filled the whole political horizon.\r\nReform unions sprang up everywhere, and instituted a most active\r\npropaganda. So rapid was its spread and so wild the promises lavished by\r\nradical demagogues, that Grey and his wiser colleagues soon felt\r\nthemselves further removed from their own extreme left wing than from\r\nthe moderate section of the conservatives. It is abundantly clear that\r\nGrey himself, faithful as he was to reform, never dreamed of\r\ninaugurating a reign of democracy. He often declared in private that\r\nsuch a bill as he contemplated would prove, in its effect, an\r\naristocratic measure, and he doubtless believed that it would be\r\npossible to bring the new constituencies and the new electoral bodies\r\nunder the same conservative influences which had been dominant for so\r\nmany generations. He did not foresee, as Palmerston did thirty years\r\nlater, that, even if the political actors remained the same, they \"would\r\nplay to the gallery\" instead of to the pit or boxes. He would, indeed,\r\nhave repudiated the maxim: \"Everything for the people, and nothing by\r\nthe people\"; he was fully prepared to place the house of commons in the\r\nhands of the people, or at least of the great middle class, but he\r\nregarded the crown and the house of lords as almost equal powers, and he\r\nnever doubted that property and education would practically continue to\r\nrule the government of the country.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _DRAFT OF THE FIRST BILL._]\r\n\r\nWhen the whigs came into office they were singularly fortunate in the\r\nhigh character and consistency of their chief, no less than in the\r\ndivisions of their opponents, whose right wing showed almost as mutinous\r\na spirit as their own left wing. Even between Wellington and Peel there\r\nwas a want of cordial harmony and confidence, yet Peel was the only tory\r\nstatesman of eminent capacity in the house of commons. The attitude of\r\nthe king, too, was not only strictly constitutional but friendly, though\r\nit afterwards appeared that he relied too implicitly on Grey and Althorp\r\nto protect him against the machinations of the radicals. The letters\r\nwritten by his orders, though mostly composed by his private secretary,\r\nSir Herbert Taylor, display marked ability together with a very shrewd\r\nand just conception of the situation. His loyal adoption of a moderate\r\nreform policy was a most important element of strength to his ministers\r\nat the outset of their great enterprise, and, if he afterwards held\r\nback, it was in deference to scruples which several of them shared in\r\ntheir hearts. Nor was the violence of the ultra-radicals, or the\r\nscurrilous language of O'Connell by any means an unmixed source of\r\nweakness to men engaged in framing and carrying a temperate reform bill.\r\nTheir firm resistance to extravagant demands reassured many a waverer\r\nand showed how carefully their comprehensive plan had been matured. On\r\nthe other hand, they had to contend against difficulties not yet fully\r\nrevealed. One of these was their own want of administrative experience,\r\ncontrasting unfavourably with the statesmanlike capacity of Peel.\r\nAnother was the intractable character of two at least within their own\r\ninnermost councils--Durham and Brougham. A third was the inflexible\r\nconservatism of a great majority in the house of lords, who, unlike the\r\npeople at large, clearly understood that the impending conflict was a\r\nlife-and-death struggle for political supremacy between themselves and\r\nthe commons--the greatest that had been waged since the revolutions of\r\nthe seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nIt was privately known that a committee had been empowered to draft the\r\nbill awaited with so much impatience. This committee consisted of two\r\nmembers of the cabinet, Durham and Graham, together with two members of\r\nthe administration not of cabinet rank, the Earl of Bessborough's eldest\r\nson, Lord Duncannon, then chief whip of the whig party, and Russell, who\r\nwas second to none as a staunch and judicious promoter of parliamentary\r\nreform. In spite of his vanity and petulance, Durham deserves the credit\r\nof having drawn up the report, highly appreciated by the king, upon\r\nwhich the projected measure was founded. It originally included vote by\r\nballot, and it is rather strange that on this point Durham was\r\npowerfully supported by Graham, but opposed by Russell. It is still more\r\nstrange that Brougham, whose scheme of reform was locked up in his own\r\nbreast, was honestly disturbed by the radicalism of his colleagues and\r\nspecially objected to so large a disfranchisement of boroughs as they\r\ncontemplated. Upon the whole, however, the bill was the product of an\r\nunited cabinet, and received the express approval of the king in all its\r\nessential features. The elaborate letter which he addressed to Grey on\r\nFebruary 4, 1831, betrays a sense of relief on finding that universal\r\nsuffrage and the ballot were not to be pressed upon him In declaring\r\nthat he never could have given his consent to such revolutionary\r\ninnovations, he insists strongly on the necessity of maintaining an\r\n\"equilibrium\" between the crown, the lords, and the commons, as well as\r\nbetween the \"representation of property\" and that of numbers.\r\n\r\nThe reform bill of 1831, which differed only in detail from the act\r\npassed in 1832, cannot be understood without some knowledge of the\r\nsystem which that act transformed. This system has been well described\r\nas \"combining survivals from the middle ages with abuses of the\r\nprerogative in later times\". The counties remained as they had remained\r\nfor centuries; Rutland, for instance, returned as many representatives\r\nas Yorkshire, until in 1821 the two seats taken from Grampound were\r\nadded to those already possessed by Yorkshire. On the other hand, the\r\nold franchise of the 40s. freeholders was more widely diffused since the\r\nvalue of money had been greatly depreciated. Still, the influence of the\r\ngreat county families was almost supreme, and they were firmly\r\nentrenched in the nomination boroughs, where there was scarcely a\r\npretence of free election. The crown had originally a discretion in\r\nsummoning members from boroughs, and used it by issuing writs to all the\r\nwealthiest as better able to bear taxation and more competent to\r\nsanction it. The poorer boroughs, too, were also glad to escape\r\nrepresentation in order to save the expense of their members' wages. The\r\ndiscretionary power of the crown was afterwards used in creating petty\r\nboroughs such as \"the Cornish group,\" for the purpose of packing the\r\nhouse of commons with crown nominees. This practice, however, ceased in\r\nthe reign of Charles II., and these petty boroughs fell by degrees into\r\nthe hands of great landowners, who dictated the choice of\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nThe result has been concisely stated as follows: \"The majority of the\r\nhouse of commons was elected by less than fifteen thousand persons.\r\nSeventy members were returned by thirty-five places with scarcely any\r\nvoters at all; ninety members were returned by forty-six places with no\r\nmore than fifty voters; thirty-seven members by nineteen places with no\r\nmore than one hundred voters; fifty-two members by twenty-six places\r\nwith no more than two hundred voters. The local distribution of the\r\nrepresentation was flagrantly unfair.... Cornwall was a corrupt nest of\r\nlittle boroughs whose vote outweighed that of great and populous\r\ndistricts. At Old Sarum a deserted site, at Gatton an ancient wall sent\r\ntwo representatives to the house of commons. Eighty-four men actually\r\nnominated one hundred and fifty-seven members for parliament. In\r\naddition to these, one hundred and fifty members were returned on the\r\nrecommendation of seventy patrons, and thus one hundred and fifty-four\r\npatrons returned three hundred and seven members.\"[103] Household\r\nsuffrage prevailed in a few boroughs, and here barefaced corruption was\r\ncommon. Seats for boroughs, appropriately called \"rotten,\" were\r\nfrequently put up to sale; otherwise, they were reserved for young\r\nfavourites of the proprietor. Neither yearly tenants, nor leaseholders,\r\nnor even copyholders, had votes for counties. Of Scotland it is enough\r\nto say that free voting had practically ceased to exist both in counties\r\nand in boroughs, as the borough franchise was the monopoly of\r\nself-elected town councils, and the county franchise of persons, often\r\nnon-resident, who happened to own \"superiorities\".\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _PROVISIONS OF THE FIRST BILL._]\r\n\r\nThe reform bill of the whig ministry, drawn on broad and simple lines,\r\nstruck at the root of this system. Its twofold basis was a liberal\r\nextension of the suffrage with a very large redistribution of seats. The\r\nelective franchise in counties, hitherto confined to freeholders, was to\r\nbe conferred on £10 copyholders and £50 leaseholders; the borough\r\nfranchise was to exclude \"scot and lot\" voters, \"potwallopers\" and most\r\nother survivals of antiquated electorates, but to include ratepaying £10\r\nhouseholders. The qualification for this franchise had originally been\r\nfixed at £20, and the king deprecated any reduction, but the omission of\r\nthe ballot reconciled him and other timid reformers to an immense\r\nincrease in the lower class of borough voters. Sixty boroughs of less\r\nthan 2,000 inhabitants, returning 119 members, were to be disfranchised\r\naltogether; forty-seven others, with less than 4,000 inhabitants, were\r\nto be deprived of one member, and Weymouth was to lose two out of the\r\nfour members which it returned in combination with the borough of\r\nMelcombe Regis. Fifty-five new seats were allotted to the English\r\ncounties, forty-two to the great unrepresented towns, five to Scotland,\r\nthree to Ireland, and one to Wales. Altogether the numerical strength of\r\nthe house of commons was to be reduced by sixty-two, and this entirely\r\nat the expense of England. Both the county and borough franchises in\r\nScotland were to be assimilated generally to those established for\r\nEngland, and the £10 borough franchise was extended to Ireland. The bill\r\ncontained many other provisions designed to amend the practice of\r\nregistration, the voting power of non-resident electors, and the\r\ncumbrously expensive machinery of elections. It is important to notice\r\nthat it also limited the duration of each parliament to five years--a\r\nconcession to radicalism afterwards abandoned and never since adopted.\r\n\r\nOn February 3 parliament met after the adjournment, and Grey stated that\r\na measure of reform had been framed, but the nature of it was not\r\ndisclosed to the house of commons until March 1, and during the interval\r\nthe secret was kept with great fidelity. The task of explaining it was\r\nentrusted to Russell, whose thorough mastery of its letter and spirit\r\nfully justified the choice, partly suggested by his aristocratic\r\nconnexions and historical name. His speech was remarkable for clearness\r\nand cogency rather than for rhetorical brilliancy, and he was careful to\r\nrest his case on constitutional equity and political expediency of the\r\nhighest order rather than on vague and abstract principles of popular\r\nrights. The debate on the motion for leave to bring in the bill lasted\r\nseven nights, and was vigorously sustained on both sides. The drastic\r\nand sweeping character of the measure took the whole house by surprise,\r\nwhile its authors justly claimed some credit for moderation in rejecting\r\nthe radical demands of universal suffrage, vote by ballot, and\r\ntriennial, if not annual, parliaments. Not only inside but outside the\r\nwalls of St. Stephen's the statement of the government had been awaited\r\nwith the utmost impatience, and it was universally felt that an issue\r\nhad now been raised which hardly admitted of compromise. The king\r\nhimself, though much engrossed by minor questions affecting the civil\r\nlist and the pension list, heartily congratulated Grey on the favourable\r\nreception and prospects of the measure, which he regarded as a safeguard\r\nagainst more democratic schemes. His great fear was of a collision\r\nbetween the two houses, and the sequel proved that it was not unfounded.\r\nFor the present, however, all promised well. Peel denounced the bill\r\nwith less than his usual caution, but declined to give battle upon it,\r\nand it passed the first reading on March 9 without a division. Indeed,\r\nthe chief danger to the stability of the government arose from its\r\ndefeat on the timber duties. This and other vexatious rebuffs so\r\nirritated Grey that he actually contemplated a dissolution, lest the\r\nreform bill itself should meet with a like fate. But the king would not\r\nhear of it, and the cabinet wisely decided to follow the example of Pitt\r\nand ignore an adverse division on a merely financial proposal, however\r\nsignificant of parliamentary feeling.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _SECOND READING OF THE FIRST BILL._]\r\n\r\nBetween the 9th and the 21st, the date fixed for the second reading,\r\npopular excitement rose to a formidable height. Monster meetings were\r\nheld in the great centres of population, and the political unions put\r\nforth all their strength. Nevertheless, the efforts of the\r\n\"borough-mongers\" were all but successful, and after only two nights\r\ndebate the bill passed its second reading by a bare majority of one, 302\r\nvoting for it, and 301 against it. After this demonstration of strength\r\non the part of its opponents, no one could expect that it would survive\r\nthe ordeal of discussion in committee, and a letter of Lord Durham,\r\nwritten in anticipation of the event, sums up with great force the\r\nreasons for an early dissolution. The crisis was precipitated by the\r\naction of General Gascoyne, member for Liverpool, who moved before the\r\nhouse could go into committee that in no case should the number of\r\nrepresentatives from England and Wales be diminished. In the hope of\r\nconciliating some wavering members, the ministry framed certain\r\nmodifications of their original scheme, but they do not seem to have\r\nentertained the idea of accepting Gascoyne's proposal in its entirety.\r\nIn the division, which took place on April 19, they were defeated by 299\r\nvotes to 291, and on the following morning advised the king to dissolve.\r\nIn spite of his former refusal, more than once repeated, the king\r\nyielded to necessity, feeling that another change of government, in the\r\nmidst of European complications, and in prospect of revolutionary\r\nagitation in the country, would be a greater evil than a general\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nThe opposition, flushed with victory, pressed its advantage to extremes,\r\nand successfully resisted a motion for the grant of supplies. Urged by\r\nAlthorp, the cabinet promptly resolved on recommending that the\r\ndissolution should be immediate, and the king, roused to energy by\r\nindignation, eagerly adopted their recommendation. Indeed, on hearing\r\nthat Lord Wharncliffe intended to move in the house of lords for an\r\naddress to the crown against a dissolution, he strongly resented such an\r\nattempt to interfere with his prerogative, and declared himself ready to\r\nstart at once and dissolve parliament in person. Difficulties being\r\nraised about preparing the royal carriages in time, he cut them short by\r\nremarking that he was prepared to go in a hackney-coach--a royal saying\r\nwhich spread like wildfire over the country. Both houses were scenes of\r\nconfusion and uproar when he arrived, preceded by the usual discharges\r\nof artillery, which excited the angry disputants to fury. Lord\r\nMansfield, who was supporting the motion for an address, continued\r\nspeaking as the king entered, until he was forcibly compelled to resume\r\nhis seat. Even Peel was only restrained by like means from disregarding\r\nthe appearance of the usher of the black rod who came to summon the\r\ncommons from the bar of the house. The king preserved his composure, and\r\nannounced an immediate prorogation of parliament with a view to its\r\ndissolution, and an appeal to the country on the great question of\r\nreform. Such an appeal could only be made to constituencies under threat\r\nof thorough reconstruction or total extinction, but from this moment the\r\nultimate issue ceased to be doubtful.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[101] Parker, _Sir Robert Peel_, ii., 160-62.\r\n\r\n[102] Arbuthnot to Peel, Nov. 1, 1830, Parker, _Sir Robert Peel_, ii.,\r\n163-66.\r\n\r\n[103] Goldwin Smith, _United Kingdom_, ii., 320.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n                              THE REFORM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general election which took place in the summer of 1831 was perhaps\r\nthe most momentous on record. The news of the sudden dissolution,\r\ncarrying with it the assurance of the king's hearty assent to reform,\r\nstirred popular enthusiasm to an intensity never equalled before or\r\nsince. From John o' Groat's to the Land's End a cry was raised of _The\r\nbill, the whole bill, and nothing but the bill_. This cry signified more\r\nthan appears on the surface, and was not wholly one-sided in its\r\napplication. No doubt it was a passionate and defiant warning against\r\nany manipulation or dilution of the bill in a reactionary sense, but it\r\nwas also a distinct protest against attempts by the extreme radicals to\r\namend it in an opposite direction. Now, as ever, the impulse was given\r\nby the middle classes, and they were in no mood to imperil their own\r\ncause by revolutionary claims. They could not always succeed, however,\r\nin checking the fury of the populace, which had been taught to clamour\r\nfor reform as the precursor of a good time coming for the suffering and\r\ntoiling masses of mankind. The streets of London were illuminated, and\r\nthe windows of those who omitted to illuminate or were otherwise\r\nobnoxious were tumultuously demolished by the mob, which did not even\r\nspare Apsley House, the town residence of the Duke of Wellington. But,\r\nexcept in Scotland, no formidable riots occurred for the present, and\r\nsome good resulted from the new experience of popular opinion gained by\r\ncandidates even from unreformed constituencies hitherto obedient to\r\noligarchical influence, but animated for the moment by a certain spirit\r\nof independence.\r\n\r\nHaving sanctioned the dissolution, the king addressed an elaborate\r\nletter to Grey, in which he did not disguise his own misgivings about\r\nthe perilous experiment of reform. Chiefly dreading a collision between\r\nthe two houses, he never ceased to press on his ministers the expediency\r\nof making all possible sacrifices consistent with the spirit of the bill\r\nin order to conciliate opposition in the house of peers. Grey's constant\r\nreply was that no concessions would propitiate men bent on driving the\r\ngovernment from office, and that no measure less efficacious than that\r\nalready introduced would satisfy the just expectations of the people.\r\nBoth of these arguments were perfectly sound, and the constitutional\r\ntriumph ultimately achieved was largely due to the admirable tenacity of\r\npurpose which refused to remodel the original reform bill in any\r\nessential respect to please either the borough-mongers or the radicals.\r\nThe elections were conducted on the whole in good order. Seventy-six out\r\nof eighty-two English county members (including the four Yorkshire\r\nmembers), and the four members for the city of London, were pledged to\r\nvote for the bill. Several notable anti-reformers were among the many\r\ncounty representatives who failed to obtain re-election; even some of\r\nthe doomed boroughs did not venture to return anti-reformers; and the\r\ngovernment found itself supported by an immense nominal majority. The\r\nnew bill, introduced on June 24 by Lord John Russell, who had recently\r\nbeen admitted in company with Stanley to the cabinet, differed little\r\nfrom the old one. The number of boroughs to be totally disfranchised was\r\nslightly greater, that of boroughs to be partially disfranchised\r\nslightly less, but the net effect of the disfranchising and\r\nenfranchising schedules was the same, and the £10 rental suffrage was\r\nretained. The measure was allowed to pass its first reading after one\r\nnight's discussion. The debates on the second reading lasted three\r\nnights, but the bill passed this stage on July 8 by a majority of 136 in\r\na house of 598 members.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _SECOND REFORM BILL._]\r\n\r\nThe victory, however, though great, was far indeed from proving\r\ndecisive. By adopting obstructive tactics, of a kind to be perfected in\r\na later age, the opposition succeeded in prolonging the discussion in\r\ncommittee over forty nights, until September 7. Though Peel separated\r\nhimself from the old tories, and steadily declined to cabal with\r\nO'Connell's faction against the government, such an unprofitable waste\r\nof time could not have taken place without his tacit sanction. Only one\r\nimportant alteration was made in the bill. This was the famous \"Chandos\r\nclause,\" proposed by Lord Chandos, son of the Duke of Buckingham,\r\nwhereby the county suffrage was extended to all tenants-at-will of £50\r\nrental and upwards. A very large proportion of tenant farmers thus\r\nbecame county voters, and for the most part followed the politics of\r\ntheir landlords. It may be doubted whether Grey seriously lamented\r\nChandos's intervention; at all events it went far to verify his own\r\nprediction that aristocratic dominion would not be undermined by\r\nreform.[104] Meanwhile, the country was naturally impatient of the\r\nvexatious delay, and a somewhat menacing conference took place between\r\nthe political unions of Birmingham, Manchester, and Glasgow. Happily\r\npublic attention was diverted to some extent by the coronation, which\r\ntook place on the 8th. The bill was carried more rapidly through its\r\nlater stages, and was finally passed in the house of commons on the\r\n21st, though by a reduced majority of 345 to 236.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the bill reached the house of lords and was set\r\ndown for its second reading on October 3. Thenceforth all the hopes and\r\nfears of its friends and enemies were concentrated on the proceedings in\r\nthat house, whose ascendency in the state was at stake. The question:\r\n\"What will the lords do?\" was asked all over the country with the\r\ndeepest anxiety. The debate lasted five nights, and is admitted to have\r\nbeen among the finest reported in our parliamentary history. All the\r\nleading peers took part in it, and several of them were roused by the\r\noccasion to unwonted eloquence, but the palm was generally awarded to\r\nthe speeches of Grey, Harrowby, Brougham, and Lyndhurst. The first of\r\nthese occupied a position which gave increased weight to his counsels,\r\nsince he was the veteran advocate of reform and yet known to be a most\r\nloyal member of the nobility which now stood on its trial. In his\r\nopening speech he appealed earnestly to the bench of bishops, as\r\ndisinterested parties and as ministers of peace, not to set themselves\r\nagainst the almost unanimous will of the people. Brougham's great\r\noration on the last night of the debate contained a masterly review of\r\nthe whole question, and, in spite of its theatrical conclusion, when he\r\nsank upon his knees, extorted the admiration of his bitterest critics as\r\na consummate exhibition of his marvellous powers.\r\n\r\nBut very few of the peers were open to persuasion; the votes of\r\nanti-reformers were mainly guided by a shortsighted conception of their\r\nown interests, and Eldon did not shrink from contending that nomination\r\nboroughs were in the nature of property rather than of trusts. A\r\nmemorable division ended in the rejection of the second reform bill on\r\nthe 8th by 199 votes to 158. Twenty-one bishops voted against it. The\r\nking lost no time in reminding Grey of his own warning against\r\nsubmitting the bill, without serious modifications, to the judgment of\r\nthe house of lords. He also intimated beforehand that he could not\r\nconsent to any such creation of peers as would convert the minority into\r\na majority. Grey at once admitted that he could not ask for so\r\nhigh-handed an exercise of the royal prerogative, and undertook to\r\nremain at his post, on condition of being allowed to introduce a third\r\nreform bill as comprehensive as its predecessor. Thereupon the king\r\nabandoned his intention of proroguing parliament by commission, and came\r\ndown in person to do so on the 20th when he delivered a speech clearly\r\nindicating legislation on reform as the work of the next session.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _REFORM BILL RIOTS._]\r\n\r\nDuring the interval between the 8th and the 20th it became evident that\r\nthe reform movement, quickened by the action of the upper house, would\r\nrise to a dangerous height. A vote of confidence in the government,\r\nbrought forward by Lord Ebrington, eldest son of Earl Fortescue, was\r\ncarried by a majority of 131, and speeches were made in support of it\r\nwhich encouraged, in the form of prediction, every kind of popular\r\nagitation short of open violence. In the course of this debate Macaulay,\r\nthe future historian of the English revolution, delivered one of those\r\nhighly wrought orations which adorn the political literature of reform.\r\nThe excitement in London was great, but kept for the most part within\r\nreasonable bounds, partly by the firm and sensible attitude of Melbourne\r\nas home secretary. The mob, however, vented its rage in window breaking\r\nand personal assaults on some prominent anti-reformers, one of whom,\r\nLord Londonderry, was knocked off his horse by a volley of stones. In\r\nthe provinces more serious disturbances broke out. At Derby the rioters\r\nactually stormed the city jail, releasing the prisoners, and were only\r\nrepelled in their attack on the county jail by the fire of a military\r\nforce. At Nottingham they wreaked their vengeance on the Duke of\r\nNewcastle by burning down Nottingham Castle, which belonged to him, and\r\nwere proceeding to further outrages when they were overawed by a\r\nregiment of hussars. A great open-air meeting of the political union was\r\nheld at Birmingham, while the bill was still before the house of lords,\r\nat which a refusal to pay taxes was openly recommended in the last\r\nresort, and votes of thanks were passed to Althorp and Russell. The\r\nformer, in acknowledging it, wisely condemned such lawless proceedings;\r\nthe latter unwisely made use of a phrase which gravely displeased the\r\nking: \"It is impossible that the whisper of faction should prevail\r\nagainst the voice of a nation\". Both were called to account in the house\r\nof commons for holding correspondence with an illegal association, but\r\ndisclaimed any recognition of the Birmingham union as a body, and fully\r\nadmitted the responsibility of the government for the maintenance of\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThis assurance was about to be tested by the most atrocious outbreak\r\nwhich disgraced the cause of reform. On Saturday, the 29th, Wetherell,\r\nas recorder of Bristol, entered the city to open the commission on the\r\nfollowing Monday. Of all the anti-reformers, he was perhaps the most\r\nvehement and unpopular, but his visit to Bristol was in discharge of an\r\nofficial duty, and had been sanctioned expressly by the government.\r\nNevertheless, the cavalcade which escorted him was assailed by a furious\r\nrabble on its way to the guildhall, and from the guildhall to the\r\nmansion house, where he was to dine. For a while, they were kept back or\r\ndriven back by a large force of constables, but, on some of these being\r\nwithdrawn, their ferocity increased, and threatened a general assault on\r\nthe mansion house. In vain did the mayor address them and read the riot\r\nact; they overpowered the constables, and carried the mansion house by\r\nstorm, the mayor and the magistrates escaping by the back premises,\r\nwhile the recorder prudently left the city. At last the military were\r\ncalled upon to act, and two troops of cavalry were ordered out. But the\r\nmilitary as well as the civil authorities showed a strange weakness and\r\nvacillation in presence of an emergency only to be compared with the\r\nLord George Gordon riots of a by-gone generation. After making one\r\ncharge and dispersing the populace for the moment, the cavalry were sent\r\nback to their barracks, and when one troop was recalled on the following\r\n(Sunday) morning, the rioters were all but masters of the city. Many of\r\nthem, having plundered the cellars of the mansion house, were infuriated\r\nby drink; they broke into the Bridewell, the new city jail, and the\r\ncounty jail, set free the prisoners, and fired the buildings. They next\r\nproceeded to burn down the mansion house, the bishop's palace, the\r\ncustom-house, and the excise-office. The cathedral is said to have been\r\nsaved by the resolute stand of a few volunteers hastily rallied by one\r\nof the officials. In the midst of all this havoc, the cavalry were\r\nalmost passive, Colonel Brereton, the commanding officer, waiting for\r\norders from the magistrates, and actually withdrawing a part of his\r\nsmall force when it was most needed, because it had incurred the special\r\nhatred of the criminals.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Monday, the guardians of law and order seemed to have\r\nrecovered their courage; at all events, the cavalry, no longer forbidden\r\nto charge, and headed by Major Mackworth, soon cleared the streets,\r\nfresh troops poured in, and the police made a number of arrests. The\r\nreign of anarchy was at an end, having lasted three days. When a return\r\nof casualties was made up, it showed that only twelve were known to have\r\nlost their lives, besides ninety-four disabled, most of whom were the\r\nvictims of excessive drunkenness or of the flames kindled by themselves.\r\nBut, though the riot was quelled, it was some proof of its deliberate\r\npromotion, and of the aims which its ringleaders had in view, that\r\nparties of them issuing out from Bristol attempted to propagate sedition\r\nin Somersetshire. A special commission sent down to Bristol condemned to\r\ndeath several of the worst malefactors; four were hanged and\r\neighty-eight sentenced either to transportation or to lighter\r\npunishments; and Colonel Brereton destroyed himself rather than face the\r\nverdict of a court-martial.\r\n\r\nOn the same Monday, the 31st, Burdett took the chair at a meeting in\r\nLincoln's Inn Fields, called for the purpose of forming a \"National\r\nPolitical Union\" in London. Soon afterwards, however, he retired from\r\nthe organisation, on the nominal ground that half of the seats on its\r\ncouncil were allotted to the working classes, but more probably because\r\nhe was beginning to be alarmed by the violence of his associates. His\r\nfears were justified by a manifesto summoning a mass meeting of the\r\nworking-classes to assemble at White Conduit House on November 7, for\r\nthe purpose of ratifying a new and revolutionary bill of rights. This\r\ntime the government was on its guard, and Melbourne plainly informed a\r\nworking-class deputation that such a meeting would certainly be\r\nseditious, and perhaps treasonable, in law. The plan was therefore\r\nabandoned, and soon afterwards a royal proclamation was issued,\r\ndeclaring organised political associations, assuming powers independent\r\nof the civil magistrates, to be \"unconstitutional and illegal\". The\r\npolitical unions proposed to consider themselves outside the scope of\r\nthe proclamation, which had little visible effect, though it was not\r\nwithout its value as proving that the government was a champion of order\r\nas well as of liberty.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _NEGOTIATIONS WITH WAVERERS._]\r\n\r\nDuring the short recess of less than six weeks political discontent,\r\nconstantly growing, was aggravated by industrial distress and gloomy\r\nforebodings of a mysterious pestilence, already known as cholera. A\r\nvoluminous correspondence was carried on between the king and Grey on\r\nthe means of silencing the political unions and smoothing the passage of\r\na new reform bill. It was not in the king's nature to conceal his own\r\nconservative leanings, especially on the imaginary danger of increasing\r\nthe metropolitan constituencies, and Grey complained more than once of\r\nthese sentiments being confided, or at least becoming known, to\r\nopponents of the government. At the same time attempts were being made\r\nnot only by the king himself, but also by peers of moderate views to\r\narrange a compromise which might save the honour of the government, and\r\nyet mitigate the hostility of the tory majority in the upper house. In\r\nthese negotiations behind the scenes, Howley, Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nand Carr, Bishop of Worcester, took part, as representing the episcopal\r\nbench, while Lords Harrowby and Wharncliffe, in temporary concert with\r\nChandos, professed to speak for the \"waverers\" among peers. As little of\r\nimportance resulted from their well-meant efforts, and as nearly all the\r\nsupposed \"waverers,\" including the bishops, drifted into open\r\nopposition, it is the less necessary to dwell at length on a very\r\ntedious chapter in the history of parliamentary reform. Suffice it to\r\nsay that when parliament reassembled on December 6, 1831, the prospects\r\nof the forthcoming bill were no brighter than in October, except so far\r\nas the danger of rejecting it had become more apparent.\r\n\r\nThe final reform bill introduced by Lord John Russell on the 12th was\r\nidentical in its principle and its essential features with the former\r\nones. The chief alteration was the maintenance of the house of commons\r\nat its full strength of 658 members. This enabled its framers not only\r\nto reduce the number of wholly disfranchised boroughs (schedule A) from\r\nsixty to fifty-six, and that of semi-disfranchised boroughs (schedule B)\r\nfrom forty-six to thirty, but to assign a larger number of members to\r\nthe prosperous towns enfranchised. The bill was at once read a first\r\ntime and passed its second reading after two nights' debate on the 16th\r\nby a majority of 324 to 162, or exactly two to one. But, after a short\r\nadjournment for the Christmas holidays, a debate of twenty-two nights\r\ntook place in committee, and the opposition made skilful use of the many\r\nvulnerable points in the new scheme. Every variation from the original\r\nbill, even by way of concession, was subjected to minute criticism, and\r\nespecially the fact that the schedules were now framed, not on a scale\r\nof population only, but on a mixed basis, partly resting on population,\r\npartly on the number of inhabited houses, and partly on the local\r\ncontribution to assessed taxes.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to pick such a compound scale to pieces, to uphold the\r\nclaims of one venal borough against another equally venal, and even to\r\nreproach the government with inconsistency in relying on the census of\r\n1831, instead of on that of 1821--a course which the opposition had\r\nspecially urged upon them. But it was not so easy to combat the\r\nirresistible arguments in favour of the bill on its general merits, to\r\nignore the reasonable concessions on points of detail which it embodied,\r\nor to explain away the patent fact that no measure less stringent would\r\nsatisfy the people. There was therefore an air of unreality about this\r\ndebate, spirited as it was, nor is it easy to understand what practical\r\nobject enlightened men like Peel could have sought in prolonging it. He\r\nwell knew, and admitted in private correspondence, that reform was\r\ninevitable; he must have known that a sham reform would be a stimulus to\r\nrevolutionary agitation; yet he strove to mutilate the bill so that it\r\nmight pass its second reading in the house of lords, and there undergo\r\nsuch further mutilation as would destroy its efficacy as a settlement of\r\nthe question. For the present he yielded. No attempt was made to\r\nobstruct the bill on its third reading, when the division showed 355\r\nvotes to 239, and it passed the commons on March 23 without any\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE THIRD REFORM BILL._]\r\n\r\nSuch a result would have been conclusive in any parliament during the\r\nsecond half of the nineteenth century. A house of commons elected by the\r\nold constituencies, and under the old franchises, had declared in favour\r\nof a well-considered reform bill. The same constituencies voting under\r\nthe same franchises had returned an increased majority in support of the\r\nsame, or very nearly the same measure; this measure, with slight\r\nvariations, had been adopted by an immense preponderance of votes in the\r\nnew house of commons: yet its fate in the house of lords was very\r\ndoubtful. Ever since the autumn of 1831, the expedient of swamping the\r\nhouse of lords had been seriously contemplated. It was supremely\r\ndistasteful to the king, and Grey himself, in common with a majority of\r\nthe cabinet, was strongly averse from it. Then came the intervention of\r\nHarrowby and Wharncliffe, the failure of which strengthened the hands of\r\nthe more determined reformers in the cabinet, and induced the king to\r\ngive way. Having already created a few peers on the coronation, he\r\nconsented to a limited addition in the last resort, but with the\r\nreservation that eldest sons of existing peers should be called up in\r\nthe first instance, and upon the assurance that, reform once carried,\r\nall further encroachments of the democracy should be resisted by the\r\ngovernment. He even authorised Grey to inform Harrowby that he had given\r\nthe prime minister this power, in the hope that it would never be\r\nneeded, and that at least the second reading of the bill would be\r\ncarried in the house of lords without it. His objection to a permanent\r\naugmentation of the peerage remained unshaken, and Grey promised to\r\npropose no augmentation at all before the second reading.\r\n\r\nThis compact, if it can be so called, was fulfilled in the letter, for\r\nthe bill was read a first time without a division, and it passed the\r\nsecond reading on April 14 by a majority of 184 to 175. To all\r\nappearance a notable process of conversion had been wrought among the\r\npeers, seventeen of whom actually changed sides, while ten opponents of\r\nthe former bill absented themselves, and twelve new adherents were\r\ngained. However encouraging these figures might be, the ministers were\r\nunder no illusion. They had the best reason for expecting the worst\r\nfrom the struggle in committee, and they were conscious of gradually\r\nlosing the king's confidence. The very demonstrations of popular\r\nenthusiasm for reform which impressed others with a sense of its\r\nnecessity impressed him with a sense of its danger; the political unions\r\nand the Bristol riots alarmed him extremely; and the foreign policy of\r\nthe government elicited from him so outspoken a protest that Grey\r\ntendered his resignation. The difficulty was overcome for the moment,\r\nbut recurred in a more serious form when parliament reassembled on May\r\n7. Lyndhurst at once proposed in committee to postpone the consideration\r\nof schedule A; in other words, to shelve the most vital provisions of\r\nthe bill until the rest should have been dissected in a hostile spirit.\r\nThis proposal is supposed to have been concerted with Harrowby and\r\nWharncliffe, if not to have received the sanction of the Duke of\r\nWellington. It was adopted by 151 votes to 116, and the cabinet, on May\r\n8, courageously determined to make a decisive stand. They firmly advised\r\nthe king to confer peerages on \"such a number of persons as might ensure\r\nthe success of the bill\". The principle thus expressed had, as has been\r\nseen, been reluctantly approved by the king himself, but he recoiled\r\nfrom the application of it when he learned that it would involve at\r\nleast fifty new creations. After a day's thought, he closed with the\r\nonly alternative, and accepted the resignation of his ministry. He then\r\nsent for Lyndhurst, who of course at once communicated with the duke.\r\n\r\nThe king, as we have seen, had never been able to understand the real\r\nforce of the reform movement, and his leading idea was that the demand\r\nfor reform might be satisfied by a moderate reform bill, which the house\r\nof lords would not reject or reduce to nullity. Wellington shared this\r\nimpression, and, though an implacable opponent of reform, was willing to\r\nundertake office for the purpose of carrying, not merely a mild\r\nsubstitute for the whig reform bill, but the whig reform bill itself\r\nwith little modification. Such an act might appear immoral in a\r\nstatesman whose integrity was more open to question, but the duke's\r\npolitical _moral_ appears to have been of a less delicate type than that\r\nwhich is commonly expected in party politicians. As a general, he\r\nconsidered, first of all and above all, what manoeuvres would best\r\nadvance his plan of campaign. As a political leader, he regarded\r\nhimself not as the chief of a party, still less as the exponent of a\r\ncreed, but rather as a public servant to whom his followers owed\r\nallegiance, whether in office or in opposition. As a public servant he\r\nfelt bound to obey the king's summons, and conduct the administration,\r\nhonestly and efficiently, but without much concern for personal\r\nconvictions. He was also anxious to preserve the house of lords from\r\nbeing swamped and so rendered ridiculous by an extensive creation of\r\npeers.[105]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _ATTEMPTS TO FORM A TORY MINISTRY._]\r\n\r\nBut Wellington knew that he was powerless to manage the house of commons\r\nwithout the aid of Peel, and Peel, though pliable in the case of\r\ncatholic emancipation, was inflexible in the case of reform. He drew a\r\ndistinction between these cases, and absolutely rejected the advice of\r\nCroker that he should grasp the helm of state to avert the worse evil of\r\nthe whigs being recalled. \"I look,\" he wrote, \"beyond the exigency and\r\nthe peril of the present moment, and I do believe that one of the\r\ngreatest calamities that could befall the country would be the utter\r\nwant of confidence in the declarations of public men which must follow\r\nthe adoption of the bill of reform by me as a minister of the\r\ncrown.\"[106] This language, repeated under reserve in the house of\r\ncommons, after a direct appeal from the king, strongly contrasts with\r\nthat of the duke who roundly asserted that he should have been ashamed\r\nto show his face in the streets if he had refused to serve his sovereign\r\nin an emergency. The marked divergence of views and conduct between the\r\ntwo leaders of the conservative party led to a temporary estrangement\r\nwhich materially weakened their counsels, and was not finally removed\r\nuntil a fresh crisis arose two years later.\r\n\r\nWhile Lyndhurst and the duke were vainly endeavouring to patch up a\r\ngovernment without Peel or his personal adherents, Goulburn and Croker,\r\nthe house of commons and the country gave decisive proofs of their\r\nresolution. A vote of confidence in Grey's ministry, proposed by\r\nEbrington, was carried on May 10 by a majority of eighty. Petitions came\r\nin from the city of London and Manchester, calling upon the commons to\r\nstop the supplies, and the reckless populace clamoured for a run upon\r\nthe Bank of England. A mass meeting convened by the Birmingham\r\npolitical union had already hoisted the standard of revolt against the\r\nlegislature, unless it would comply with the will of the people; the\r\nexample was spreading rapidly, and events seemed to be hurrying on\r\ntowards a fulfilment of Russell's prediction that, in the event of a\r\npolitical deadlock, the British constitution would perish in the\r\nconflict. The duke was credited, of course unjustly, with the intention\r\nof establishing military rule, and doubts were freely expressed whether\r\nhe could rely either on the army or on the police to put down insurgent\r\nmobs. The excitement in the house of commons itself was scarcely less\r\nformidable, and it soon became evident that high tories were almost as\r\nmuch incensed by the prospect of a tory reform bill as radicals and\r\nwhigs by the vote on Lyndhurst's amendment.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th Manners Sutton and Alexander Baring, Lyndhurst's trusted\r\nconfidants, plainly informed the duke that his self-imposed task was\r\nhopeless, and on the next day the duke advised the king to recall Grey.\r\nThe king, who had apparently grasped the position earlier, acquiesced in\r\nthis solution of the question. He agreed to recall Grey and his\r\ncolleagues, and to use his own personal influence in persuading tory\r\npeers to abstain from voting. He attempted to impose upon his old\r\nministers the condition of modifying the bill considerably, but they\r\ncontinued to insist on maintaining its integrity, and on swamping the\r\nupper house, unless its opposition should be withdrawn. It was, happily,\r\nunnecessary to resort to such extreme measures. A letter from the king,\r\ndated the 17th, informed Wellington that all difficulties would be\r\nremoved by \"a declaration in the house of lords from a sufficient number\r\nof peers that they have come to the resolution of dropping their further\r\nopposition to the reform bill\". On that night, after stating what had\r\npassed, the duke retired from the house, followed by about 100 peers,\r\nand absented himself from the discussion of the bill in committee. A\r\nstalwart minority remained, and took issue on a few clauses, but their\r\nnumbers constantly dwindled, and when the report was received on June 1\r\nonly eighteen peers recorded their dissent in a protest. Grey himself,\r\nthough suffering from illness, moved the third reading on the 4th, when\r\nit was carried by 106 to 22. His last words did not lack the dignity\r\nwhich had marked his bearing throughout, and expressed the earnest hope\r\nthat, in spite of sinister forebodings, \"the measure would be found to\r\nbe, in the best sense, conservative of the constitution\".\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _ROYAL ASSENT TO THE BILL._]\r\n\r\nThe amendments made in the house of lords were slight, and the house of\r\ncommons adopted them without any argument on their merits. Peel, who had\r\nmade a convincing defence of his recent conduct, and who afterwards took\r\na statesmanlike course in the reformed parliament, declared, with some\r\npetulance, that he would have nothing to do with the consideration of\r\nprovisions or amendments passed under compulsion, and that he was\r\nprepared to accept them, _en bloc_, whatever their nature or\r\nconsequences. The bill, therefore, received the royal assent on the 7th,\r\nbut the king could not be induced to perform this ceremony in person.\r\nThough his scruples had been respected in framing the scheme of reform,\r\nthough he was consulted at every turn and clearly recognised the\r\nnecessity to which he bowed, and though he was spared the resort to a\r\n_coup d'état_ which he abhorred, he could not but feel humiliated by the\r\nill-disguised subjection of the crown and the nobility to a single\r\nchamber of the people. It is greatly to his honour that, with limited\r\nintelligence, and strong prejudices, he should have played a\r\nstraightforward and strictly constitutional part in so perilous a\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\nBy the great reform bill, as it was still called even after it became an\r\nact, the whole representative system of England and Wales was\r\nreconstructed. Fifty-six nomination boroughs, as we have seen, lost\r\ntheir members altogether; thirty more were reduced to one member, and\r\nWeymouth which, coupled with Melcombe Regis, had returned four members,\r\nnow lost two. Twenty-two large towns, including metropolitan districts,\r\nwere allotted two members each; twenty smaller but considerable towns\r\nreceived one member each; the number of English and Welsh county members\r\nwas increased from ninety-four to one hundred and fifty-nine, and the\r\nlarger counties were parcelled out into divisions. All the fanciful and\r\nantiquated franchises which had prevailed in the older boroughs were\r\nswept away to make room for a levelling £10 household suffrage, the\r\nprivileges of freemen being alone preserved. The rights of 40s.\r\nfreeholders were retained in counties, but they found themselves\r\nassociated with a large body of copyholders, leaseholders, and\r\ntenants-at-will paying £50 in rent. The general result was to place the\r\nborough representation mainly in the hands of shopkeepers, and the\r\ncounty representation mainly in those of landlords and farmers. The\r\nformer change had a far greater effect on the balance of parties than\r\nthe latter. The shopkeepers, of whom many were nonconformists, long\r\ncontinued to cherish advanced radical traditions, partly derived from\r\nthe reform agitation, and constantly rebelled against dictation from\r\ntheir rich customers. The farmers, dependent on their landlords and\r\nclosely allied with them in defending the corn laws, proved more\r\nsubmissive to influence, and constituted the backbone of the great\r\nagricultural interest.\r\n\r\nThe enactment of the English reform bill carried with it as its\r\nnecessary sequel the success of similar bills for Scotland and Ireland.\r\nIn Scotland electoral abuses were so gross that reform was comparatively\r\nsimple, and that proposed, as Jeffrey, the lord advocate, frankly said,\r\n\"left not a shred of the former system\". The nation, as a whole, gained\r\neight members, since its total representation was raised from forty-five\r\nto fifty-three seats, thirty for counties and twenty-three for cities\r\nand burghs. Two members were allotted to Edinburgh and Glasgow\r\nrespectively; one each to Paisley, Aberdeen, Perth, Dundee, and\r\nGreenock, as well as to certain groups of boroughs. Both the county and\r\nburgh electorates were entirely transformed. The \"old parchment\r\nfreeholders\" in counties, many of whom owned not a foot of land, were\r\nsuperseded by a mixed body of freeholders and leaseholders with real\r\nthough various qualifications. The electoral monopoly of town councils\r\nwas replaced by the enfranchisement of householders with a uniform\r\nqualification of £10. A claim to representation on behalf of the\r\nScottish universities was negatived in the house of lords. The number of\r\nrepresentatives for Ireland was raised from 100 to 105. The\r\ndisfranchisement of the 40s. freeholders was maintained against the\r\nstrenuous attacks of O'Connell and Sheil, but the introduction of the\r\n£10 borough franchise amply balanced the loss of democratic influence in\r\ncounties. On the whole the transfer of power from class to class was\r\ngreater in Scotland and Ireland than in England itself, and in Ireland\r\nthis signified a corresponding transfer of power from protestants to\r\ncatholics. The rule of the priests was almost as absolute as ever until\r\nit was checked for a while by a purely democratic movement, and the\r\nIrish vote in the house of commons was generally cast on the radical\r\nside.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _RETROSPECT OF THE REFORM MOVEMENT._]\r\n\r\nA calm retrospect of the reform movement, culminating in the acts of\r\n1832, compels us to see how little the course of politics is guided by\r\nreason, and how much by circumstances. Every argument employed in that\r\nand the preceding year possessed equal force at the end of the\r\neighteenth century, and the benefits of reform might have been obtained\r\nat a much smaller cost of domestic strife; nor can we doubt that, but\r\nfor the French revolution, these arguments would have prevailed. Whether\r\nor not the sanguinary disruption of French society furthered the cause\r\nof progress on the continent, it assuredly threw back that cause in\r\nGreat Britain for more than a generation. Not only did its horrors and\r\nenormities produce a reaction which paralysed the efforts of liberals in\r\nthis country, but the wars arising out of it engrossed for twenty years\r\nthe whole energy of the nation. Had it been possible for Pitt to pass a\r\nreform bill after carrying the Irish union, the current of English\r\nhistory would have been strangely diverted. The sublime tenacity of that\r\nproud aristocracy which defied the French empire in arms, and nerved all\r\nthe rest of Europe by its example and its subsidies, would never have\r\nbeen exhibited by a democratic or middle class parliament, and it is\r\nmore than probable that Great Britain would have stood neutral while the\r\ncontinent was enslaved or worked out its own salvation. On the other\r\nhand, in such a case, Great Britain might have been spared a great part\r\nof the misery and discontent which, following the peace, but indirectly\r\ncaused by the war, actually paved the way for the reform movement. It\r\nremained for a second French revolution, combined with the infatuation\r\nof English tories, to supply the motive power which converted a party\r\ncry into a national demand for justice. The reform act was, in truth, a\r\ncompletion of the earlier English revolution provoked by the Stuarts.\r\nConsidering the condition of the people before its introduction, and the\r\nobstinacy of the resistance to be overborne, we may well marvel that it\r\nwas carried, after all, so peacefully, and must ever remember it as a\r\nsignal triumph of whig statesmanship.\r\n\r\nIt was the crowning merit of the reform act, from a whig point of view,\r\nthat it stayed the rising tide of democracy, and raised a barrier\r\nagainst household suffrage and the ballot which was not broken down for\r\na generation more. It put an end to an oligarchy of borough-owners and\r\nborough-mongers; it was a charter of political rights for the\r\nmanufacturing interest and the great middle class. But it did nothing\r\nfor the working classes in town or country; indeed, by the abolition of\r\npotwallopers and scot-and-lot voters in a few boroughs, they forfeited\r\nsuch fragmentary representation as they had possessed. Hence the seeds\r\nof chartism, already sown, were quickened in 1832; but socialism was not\r\nyet a force in politics, and it was still hoped that, under the new\r\nelectoral system, the sufferings of the poor might be mostly remedied by\r\nact of parliament. The effect of the reform act on the balance of the\r\nconstitution was not, at first, fully appreciated. The grievance of\r\nnomination-boroughs had been all but completely redressed, and that of\r\npolitical corruption greatly diminished, but the hereditary peerage\r\nremained, and the right of the lords to override the will of the commons\r\nhad ostensibly survived the conflict of 1831-32. But far-sighted men\r\ncould not fail to perceive that, in fact, the upper house was no longer\r\na co-ordinate estate of the realm. The peers retained an indefinite\r\npower of delaying a measure, but it soon came to be a received maxim\r\nthat on a measure of primary importance such a power could only be\r\nexercised in order to give the commons an opportunity of reconsideration\r\nor to force an appeal to the country at a general election, and that a\r\nnew house of commons, armed with a mandate to carry that measure, though\r\nonce rejected by the peers, could not be resisted except at the risk of\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nThe best safeguard against collision, however, was to be found in the\r\nlatent conservatism of the house of commons itself. Reformed as it was,\r\nit had not ceased to be mainly a house of country gentlemen, and the\r\nnon-payment of members was a security for its being composed, almost\r\nexclusively, of men with independent means and a stake in the country. A\r\nvery large proportion of these had been educated at the great public\r\nschools, or the old English universities. They might accept on the\r\nhustings the doctrine, against which Burke so eloquently protested, that\r\na representative is above all a delegate, and must go to parliament as\r\nthe pledged mouthpiece of his constituency. But in the house itself they\r\ncould not divest themselves of the sentiments derived from their birth,\r\ntheir education, and their own personal interests; nor was it found\r\nimpossible, without a direct violation of pledges, to act upon their own\r\nopinions in many a critical division. Still, it has been well pointed\r\nout that, with the flowing tide of reform there arose a new and\r\none-sided conception of statesmanship as consisting in progressive\r\namendment of the laws rather than in efficient administration, so that\r\nit is now popularly regarded as a mark of weakness on the part of any\r\ngovernment to allow a session to pass without effecting some important\r\nlegislative change.[107]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _CORONATION OF WILLIAM IV._]\r\n\r\nThe supreme interest of the reform bill and its incidents naturally\r\ndwarfed all other political questions, and the legislative annals of\r\n1831-32 are otherwise singularly devoid of historical importance. The\r\ncoronation of William IV., which, as has been seen, took place on\r\nSeptember 8, 1831, was hardly more than an interlude in the great\r\nstruggle, yet it served for the moment to assuage the animosities of\r\nparty warfare. The king himself, who disliked solemn ceremonials, and\r\nthe ministers, deeply pledged to economy, were inclined to dispense with\r\nthe pageant altogether. It was found, however, that not only peers and\r\ncourt officials but the public would be grievously disappointed by the\r\nomission of what, after all, is a solemn public celebration of the\r\ncompact between the sovereign and the nation. The coronation was,\r\ntherefore, carried out with due pomp and all the time-honoured\r\nformalities, but without the profuse extravagance which attended the\r\nenthronement of George IV. There was no public banquet, and the public\r\ncelebration ceased with the ceremony in Westminster Abbey. The Duke of\r\nWellington and other leading members of the opposition had been duly\r\nconsulted by the government; there was a welcome respite from\r\nparliamentary warfare; the king's returning popularity was confirmed;\r\nand all classes of the people were satisfied.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE CHOLERA EPIDEMIC._]\r\n\r\nTwo months later, the appearance of the cholera at Sunderland added\r\nanother grave cause of anxiety to all the difficulties created by the\r\ndefeat of the reform bill in the house of lords, and the ominous riots\r\nat Bristol. A similar but distinct and infinitely milder disease had\r\nlong been known under the name of _cholera morbus_, or more correctly\r\n_cholera nostras_. Asiatic cholera, as the new disease was called, had\r\nno affinity with any other known disease, and excited all the greater\r\nterror by its novelty, as well as by the suddenness of its fatal effect.\r\nIt was first observed by English physicians in 1817, when 10,000 persons\r\nfell victims to it in the district of Jessor in Bengal. About the same\r\ntime it attacked and decimated the central division of the army of Lord\r\nHastings, advancing against Gwalior. Before long it spread over the\r\nwhole province of Bengal, and eastward along the coasts of Asia as far\r\nas China and Timur in the East Indies, crossed the great wall, and\r\npenetrated into Mongolia. In 1818 it broke out at Bombay, and during the\r\nnext twelve years continued to haunt, at intervals, the cities of Persia\r\nand Asiatic Turkey, with the coasts of the Caspian Sea. It was not until\r\n1829 that it reached the Russian province of Orenburg, by way of the\r\nriver Volga, visiting St. Petersburg and Archangel in June, 1830. Thence\r\nit travelled slowly but steadily westward through Northern Europe, as\r\nwell as southward into the valleys of the Danube and its tributaries,\r\nuntil it made its appearance at Berlin and Hamburg in the summer of\r\n1831. Long before this, and while the reform crisis was in its acutest\r\nstage, the probability of its advent was fully realised in England, and\r\norders in council were issued in June, 1831, placing in quarantine all\r\nships coming from the Baltic. Notwithstanding the outcry against\r\nmeddling with trade, men of war were appointed to enforce these orders,\r\nand when the news came that Marshal Diebitsch had died of the disease in\r\nPoland, the alarm increased and all regulations against plague were made\r\napplicable to cholera. Whether or not these precautions were\r\nineffective, it swooped upon Sunderland on October 26, and prevailed\r\nthere for two months, though its true character was very unwillingly\r\nrecognised.[108]\r\n\r\nThe conflict between the newly created board of health and the merchants\r\nimporting goods caused the government no little perplexity. The protests\r\nof the latter were strengthened by the somewhat remarkable fact that,\r\nonce established at Sunderland, the cholera seemed to be arrested in its\r\ncourse and for a while spread no further. There seemed to be some ground\r\nfor the belief that it was partly due to extreme overcrowding and\r\nneglect of all sanitary rules in that town, but this belief was soon\r\ndissipated by its appearance at Newcastle and progress over the\r\nnorth-eastern counties even during the winter months. Seven cases of it\r\noccurred on the banks of the Thames just below London early in February,\r\n1832, and though its virulence in England was alleged to be less than on\r\nthe continent, further experience hardly justified that opinion. The\r\nappalling violence of its first onslaught on some vulnerable districts\r\nmay be illustrated by the example of Manchester, where a whole family\r\njust arrived from an infected locality was swept away within twenty-four\r\nhours. The government did its duty by disseminating instructions for its\r\nprevention and treatment among the local authorities, but the prejudices\r\nof the lower orders were against all interference for their benefit, and\r\nscenes of brutality were sometimes enacted such as may still be\r\nwitnessed in oriental cities scourged by the plague. After a temporary\r\ndecline, the visitation recurred in all its severity, and in July the\r\ndeaths of a few persons in the highest circles occasioned a panic in the\r\nwest end of London. Still the declared number of deaths in the\r\nmetropolitan area was only 5,275, showing a far lower rate of mortality\r\nin London than in Paris at the same time, and much lower than in London\r\nitself during the epidemic of 1849, when statistics were more\r\ntrustworthy. None of the cholera epidemics, however, approached in\r\ndeadliness the plagues of 1625 and 1665. In the latter year the number\r\nof deaths in London from plague alone represented about one-fifth of the\r\nentire resident population--a proportion equivalent to a mortality of\r\nabove 200,000 in the London of 1831-32. This comparative immunity was\r\npartly due to improved sanitation, the vigorous development of which may\r\nbe said to date from the first visitation of cholera.\r\n\r\nThe census taken in 1831 revealed an increase of population, which,\r\nthough not equal to that of the preceding decade, indicated a most\r\nsatisfactory growth of wealth and employment. It was found that Great\r\nBritain contained about 16,500,000 inhabitants, but of these, as might\r\nbe expected, a smaller percentage was employed in agriculture and a\r\nlarger percentage in manufacturing industry than in 1821. It has been\r\ncalculated that since the end of the great war the accumulation of\r\ncapital had been twice as rapid as the multiplication of the people,\r\nbut, in spite of this, pauperism, as measured by poor law expenditure,\r\nhad increased almost continuously since 1823, and emigration received a\r\nstartling impulse in 1831-32. Rick burning and frame breaking were the\r\njoint result of childish ignorance, miserable wages, mistaken taxes on\r\nthe staple of food, and poor laws administered as if for the very\r\npurpose of encouraging improvidence and vice. All these causes were\r\ncapable of being removed or mitigated by legislation, for even the rate\r\nof wages was kept down by the ruinous system of out-door relief. But it\r\nwas only a few thoughtful persons who then appreciated either the extent\r\nor the real sources of the mischief, and the disputes which soon arose\r\nabout the proper remedies to be applied have been handed on to a later\r\nage.\r\n\r\nNext to parliamentary reform the state of Ireland was by far the most\r\nimportant subject which engaged the attention of the legislature in\r\n1831-32. The population had increased from 6,801,827 in 1821 to\r\n7,767,401 in 1831, and the increase, unlike that in England, had been\r\nalmost exclusively in the agricultural districts. While the political\r\nmotive for multiplying small freeholds had ceased, the motives for\r\nmultiplying small tenancies were as strong as ever, and were felt by\r\nlandlords no less than by cottiers. This class, often inhabiting huts\r\nlike those of savage tribes and living in a squalor hardly to be seen\r\nelsewhere in western Europe, chiefly depended for their subsistence on\r\npotatoes--the most uncertain and the least nutritious of the crops used\r\nfor human food. Many hundred thousands of them had no employment in\r\ntheir own country and no means of livelihood except the produce of the\r\nscanty patches around their own turf cabins. Tens of thousands flocked\r\nto England annually seeking harvest work, and a small number emigrated\r\nto Canada or the United States, the passage money for an emigrant being\r\nthen almost prohibitive. Those who could not pay rent were liable to\r\neviction, and eviction was a more cruel fate then than now, since there\r\nwas no poor law in Ireland. Fever was rife in their miserable abodes,\r\nfollowing in the steps of hunger, and for relief of any kind they could\r\nrely only on the mercy of their landlords or the charity of their\r\nneighbours. Under such conditions of life crime and disaffection could\r\nnot but flourish, and the Irish peasant could hardly be blamed if he\r\nlistened eagerly to the counsels of O'Connell. For him catholic\r\nemancipation had no meaning except so far as it gave him a hope that\r\nparliament, swayed by the great Irish demagogue, would abolish tithes,\r\nif not rent, and find some means of making Irishmen happy in their own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _ANGLESEY LORD LIEUTENANT OF IRELAND._]\r\n\r\nHad O'Connell been a true patriot, or even an honest politician, he\r\nwould have devoted his vast powers and influence to practical schemes\r\nfor the good of Ireland, and specially to a solution of the agrarian\r\nquestion. Unhappily, smarting under a not unfounded sense of injustice,\r\nwhen he was disabled from taking his seat for Clare, he threw his whole\r\nenergy into a new campaign for the repeal of the union, which occupied\r\nthe rest of his life. So far from acknowledging any gratitude to the\r\nwhigs, through whose support emancipation had been carried, he exhausted\r\nall the resources of his scurrilous rhetoric upon them, lavishing the\r\nepithets \"base, brutal, and bloody,\" with something like Homeric\r\niteration. In December, 1830, Anglesey had returned to succeed the Duke\r\nof Northumberland, and Stanley occupied the post of chief secretary, in\r\nplace of Hardinge. The ministers were privately advised to buy O'Connell\r\nat any price, and it was intimated that he would not object to become a\r\nlaw officer of the crown, or at least would not refuse a judicial\r\nappointment. It may well be doubted whether the offer of such a bargain\r\nto such a man could have been justified by success; it is more than\r\nprobable that it would have failed, and it is quite certain that failure\r\nwould have brought infinite discredit upon the government. At all events\r\nthe attempt was not made, and other catholic aspirants to legal\r\npromotion were passed over with less excuse.\r\n\r\nLord Anglesey proved a resolute viceroy, and proclaimed the various\r\nassociations, meetings, and processions organised by O'Connell, with\r\nlittle regard for his own popularity. O'Connell's policy, carried out\r\nwith the cunning of a skilful lawyer, was to obey the law in the letter,\r\nbut to break it almost defiantly in the spirit. At last, however, he\r\nwent a step too far by advising the people who had come for a prohibited\r\nmeeting to reassemble and hold it elsewhere. He was arrested on January\r\n18, 1831, and pleaded \"Not guilty,\" but on February 17, when his trial\r\ncame on, he allowed judgment to go by default against him on those\r\ncounts of the indictment which charged him with a statutable offence,\r\nprovided that other counts, which charged him with a conspiracy at\r\ncommon law, should be withdrawn. The attorney-general assented, and the\r\ncase was adjourned until the first day in Easter term. Before that day\r\narrived, however, the reform bill had been introduced, and O'Connell had\r\nmade a powerful speech in support of it. In the desperate struggle which\r\nensued, the ministers shrunk from estranging so formidable an ally, a\r\nfurther adjournment of the case was allowed, a sudden dissolution of\r\nparliament took place, the act under which O'Connell was to be sentenced\r\nexpired with the parliament, and no further action was taken.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _\"TITHE-WAR\" IN IRELAND._]\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1831, the agitation for repeal which O'Connell had set\r\non foot, as soon as the emancipation act had been passed, was for a\r\nwhile thrust into the shade by the fiercer agitation against tithes.\r\nThis agitation was connected, in theory, with the demand for the\r\nabolition or reduction of the Irish Church establishment, but was, in\r\nfact, entirely independent of that or any other constitutional movement.\r\nIt may seem inexplicable to political students of a later age that Irish\r\nquestions of secondary importance, and eminently capable of equitable\r\ntreatment, should have convulsed the whole island and disturbed the\r\nwhole course of imperial politics, during the reign of William IV. The\r\nrebellion against tithes or \"tithe-war,\" as it was called, had not the\r\nsemblance of justification in law or reason. Every tenant who took part\r\nin it had inherited or acquired his farm, subject to payment of tithes,\r\nand might have been charged a higher rent if he could have obtained it\r\ntithe-free. The tithe was the property of the parson as much as the land\r\nwas the property of the landlord, and the wilful refusal of it was from\r\na legal point of view sheer robbery. On the other hand, the mode of\r\ncollection was extremely vexatious, perhaps involving the seizure of a\r\npig, a bag of meal, or a sack of potatoes; and a starving cottier,\r\npaying fees to his own priest, was easily persuaded by demagogues that\r\nit was an arbitrary tribute extorted by clerical tyrants of an alien\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nThus it came to pass that the history of the Irish \"tithe-war\" exhibits\r\nthe Irish peasantry in their very worst moods, and it is stained with\r\natrocities never surpassed in later records of Irish agrarian\r\nconspiracy. It is among the strange and sad anomalies of national\r\ncharacter that a people so kindly in their domestic relations, so little\r\nprone to ordinary crime, and so amenable to better influences, should\r\nhave shown, in all ages, down to the very latest, a capacity for\r\ndastardly inhumanity, under vindictive and gregarious impulses, only to\r\nbe matched by Spanish and Italian brigands among the races of modern\r\nEurope. Yet so it is, and no \"coercion\" (so-called) ultimately enforced\r\nby legal authority was comparable in severity with the coercion which\r\nbloodthirsty miscreants ruthlessly applied to honest and peaceable\r\nneighbours, only guilty of paying their lawful debts. It is not too much\r\nto say that anarchy prevailed over a great part of Ireland, especially\r\nof Leinster, during the years 1831 and 1832. The collection of tithes\r\nbecame almost impossible. The tithe-proctors were tortured or murdered;\r\nthe few willing tithe-payers were cruelly maltreated or intimidated; the\r\npolice, unless mustered in large bodies, were held at bay; cattle were\r\ndriven, or, if seized and offered for sale, could find no purchasers;\r\nand the protestant clergy, who had acted on the whole with great\r\nforbearance, were reduced to extremities of privations. Five of the\r\npolice were shot dead on one occasion; on another, twelve who were\r\nescorting a tithe-proctor were massacred in cold blood. A large number\r\nof rioters were killed in encounters with the police, which sometimes\r\nassumed the form of pitched battles and closely resembled civil war.\r\nSpecial commissions were sent down into certain districts, and a few\r\nexecutions took place, but in most cases Irish juries proved as\r\nregardless of their oaths as they ever have on trials of prisoners for\r\npopular crimes. O'Connell, and even Sheil, tacitly countenanced these\r\nlawless proceedings, and openly palliated them in the house of commons.\r\n\r\nThe whig government, engaged in a life-and-death contest with the\r\nEnglish borough-mongers, hesitated to crush the Irish insurgents by\r\nmilitary force, or to initiate a sweeping reform of the Irish Church.\r\nEarly in 1832, however, committees of both houses reported in favour of\r\ngiving the clergy temporary relief out of public funds, and of\r\nultimately commuting tithes into a charge upon the land. A preliminary\r\nbill for the former purpose was promptly carried by Stanley, and made\r\nthe government responsible for recovering the arrears. The committee,\r\npursuing their inquiries, produced fuller reports, and again recommended\r\na complete extinction of tithes in Ireland. But the method proposed and\r\nembodied in three bills introduced by Stanley in the same year, was too\r\ncomplicated to serve as a permanent settlement, and was denounced as\r\nillusory by the Irish members. The first bill was, in fact, a compulsory\r\nextension of acts already passed in 1822 and 1823, the former of which\r\nhad permitted the tithe-owner to lease the tithe to the landlord, while\r\nthe latter permitted the tithe-owner and tithe-payers of each parish to\r\narrange a composition. Unfortunately, the act of 1823 had provided that\r\nthe payment in commutation of tithe should be distributed over\r\ngrass-lands hitherto tithe-free in Ireland as well as over land hitherto\r\nliable to tithe. The act was in consequence unpopular with a section of\r\nfarmers, while at the same time the bishops resented the commutation, as\r\nlikely to diminish the value of beneficies. But in spite of this\r\nopposition the act of 1823 had been widely adopted. Stanley's bill to\r\nrender such commutations compulsory passed, but his other two bills,\r\nproviding a new ecclesiastical machinery for buying up tithes, were\r\nabandoned at the end of the session. Of course the substitution of the\r\ngovernment for the clergyman as creditor in respect of arrears had no\r\nsoothing effect on the debtors. The reign of terror continued unabated,\r\nand O'Connell contented himself with pointing out that without repeal\r\nthere could be no peace in Ireland. We may so far anticipate the\r\nlegislation of 1833 as to notice the inevitable failure of the\r\nexperiment which converted the government into a tithe-proctor. It was\r\nthen replaced by a new plan, under which the government abandoned all\r\nprocesses under the existing law, advanced £1,000,000 to clear off all\r\narrears of tithe, and sought reimbursement by a land tax payable for a\r\nperiod of five years.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _EDUCATION IN IRELAND._]\r\n\r\nIt reflects credit on the unreformed house of commons that in its very\r\nlast session, harassed by the irreconcilable attitude of the catholic\r\npopulation in Ireland, it should have found time and patience not only\r\nfor the pressing question of Irish tithes, but for the consideration of\r\na resolution introductory to an Irish poor law, of a bill (which became\r\nlaw) for checking the abuses of Irish party processions, and of a grant\r\nfor a board to superintend the mixed education of Irish catholic and\r\nprotestant children. The discussion of Sadler's motion in favour of an\r\nIrish poor law was somewhat academic, and produced a division among the\r\nIrish members, O'Connell, with gross inconsistency, declaring himself\r\nvehemently opposed to any such measure. The ministers professed\r\nsympathy with its principle, but would not pledge themselves to deal\r\nimmediately with so difficult and complicated a subject, perhaps\r\nforeseeing the necessity of radical change in the English poor law\r\nsystem. The processions bill was vigorously resisted on behalf of the\r\nOrangemen, as specially aimed at their annual demonstrations on July 12,\r\nbut it was so manifestly wise to remove every wanton aggravation of\r\nparty spirit in Ireland, that it was passed just before the prorogation.\r\n\r\nThe experiment of mixed education in Ireland had already been made with\r\npartial success, first by individuals, and afterwards by an association\r\nknown as the Kildare Place Society. On the appointment of Dr. Whately to\r\nthe archbishopric of Dublin, it received a fresh impulse, and Stanley,\r\nas chief secretary, definitely adopted the principle, recommended by two\r\ncommissions and two committees, of \"a combined moral and literary and\r\nseparate religious instruction\". A board of national education was\r\nestablished in Dublin, composed of eminent Roman catholics as well as\r\nprotestants, to superintend all state-aided schools in which selections\r\nfrom the Bible, approved by the board, were to be read on two days in\r\nthe week. Though provision was made for unrestricted biblical teaching,\r\nout of school hours, on the other four days, protestant bigotry was\r\nroused against the very idea of compromise. A shrewd observer remarked,\r\n\"While the whole system is crumbling to dust under their feet, while the\r\nChurch is prostrate, property of all kind threatened, and robbery,\r\nmurder, starvation, and agitation rioting over the land, these wise\r\nlegislators are debating whether the brats at school shall read the\r\nwhole Bible or only parts of it\".[109] The opponents of the national\r\nboard failed to defeat the scheme in parliament, and it was justly\r\nmentioned with satisfaction by the king in his prorogation speech of\r\nAugust 16. But its benefits, though lasting, were seriously curtailed by\r\nsectarian jealousy. Most of the protestant clergy frowned upon the\r\nnational schools, as the Roman catholic priesthood had frowned upon the\r\nschools of the Kildare Place Society, and a noble opportunity of\r\nmitigating religious strife in Ireland was to a great extent wasted.\r\nThus ended the eventful session of 1832.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[104] See Professor Dicey's observations on this clause, _Law and\r\nOpinion in England_, p. 54, _n._\r\n\r\n[105] Wellington, _Despatches, etc._, viii., 206; Parker, _Sir Robert\r\nPeel_, ii., 207.\r\n\r\n[106] Parker, _Sir Robert Peel_, ii., 206.\r\n\r\n[107] Goldwin Smith, _United Kingdom_, ii., 354; Dicey, _Law and Opinion\r\nin England_, p. 85.\r\n\r\n[108] C.

The\r\ngeneral election which followed, though awaited with much anxiety, was\r\norderly on the whole, and produced less change than had been expected in\r\nthe _personnel_ of the house of commons. The counties, for the most\r\npart, elected men from the landed aristocracy, the great towns elected\r\nmen of recognised distinction, and few political leaders were excluded,\r\nthough Croker abjured political life and refused to solicit a seat in\r\nthe reformed house of commons. The good sense of the country asserted\r\nitself; while Cobbett was returned for Oldham, \"Orator\" Hunt was\r\ndefeated at Preston, and no general preference was shown for violent\r\ndemagogues by the more democratic boroughs. The age of members in the\r\nnew house was higher, on the average, than in the old; its social\r\ncharacter was somewhat lower, and the high authority of William Ewart\r\nGladstone, who now entered parliament for the first time, may be quoted\r\nfor the opinion that it was inferior, in the main, as a deliberative\r\nassembly. But it was certainly superior as a representative assembly, it\r\ncontained more capable men of business, and its legislative productions,\r\nas we shall hereafter see, claim the gratitude of posterity. A certain\r\nwant of modesty in the new class of members was observed by hostile\r\ncritics, and was to be expected in men who had won their seats by\r\npopular oratory and not through patronage. The house of commons had\r\nalready ceased to be \"the best club in London,\" and later reforms have\r\nstill further weakened its title to be so regarded, but they have also\r\nshown the wonderful power of assimilation inherent in the atmosphere of\r\nthe house itself, and the spirit of freemasonry which springs up among\r\nthose who enter it by very different avenues.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE FIRST REFORMED PARLIAMENT._]\r\n\r\nThe change wrought by the reform act in the strength and distribution of\r\nparties was immediate and conspicuous. The ancient division of whigs and\r\ntories, which had become well-nigh obsolete in the reign of George IV.,\r\nhad been revived by the great struggle of 1831-32. It was now superseded\r\nto a great extent by the combination of the radicals with O'Connell's\r\nfollowers into an independent section, and by the growth of a party\r\nunder Peel, distinct from the inveterate tories and known by the name of\r\n\"conservative,\" which first came into use in 1831.[110] The\r\npreponderance of liberalism, in its moderate and extreme forms, was\r\noverwhelming. It was roughly computed that nearly half the house were\r\nministerialists and about 190 members radicals, Irish repealers, or free\r\nlances, while only 150 were classed as \"conservatives,\" apparently\r\nincluding tories.[111] In such circumstances the attitude to be adopted\r\nby Peel was of the highest constitutional importance. It is some proof\r\nof the respect for statesmanship instinctively felt by the new house of\r\ncommons that Peel, as inexorable an opponent of reform as Canning\r\nhimself, should at once have assumed a foremost position and soon\r\nobtained an ascendency in an assembly so largely composed of his\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nBut Peel himself was no longer a mere party leader. Unlike Wellington\r\nand Eldon, he saw the necessity of accepting loyally the accomplished\r\nfact and shaping his future course in accordance with the nation's will.\r\nHe, therefore, took an early opportunity of declaring that he regarded\r\nthe reform act as irrevocable, and that he was prepared to participate\r\nin the dispassionate amendment of any institution that really needed it.\r\nIn a private letter to Goulburn he stated that, in his judgment, \"the\r\nbest position the government could assume would be that of moderation\r\nbetween opposite extremes of ultra-toryism and radicalism,\" intimating\r\nfurther that \"we should appear to the greatest advantage in defending\r\nthe government\" against their own extreme left wing.[112] In this\r\npolicy he persevered; his influence did much to quell the confusion and\r\ndisorder of the first debate, and his followers swelled the government\r\nmajorities in several of the early divisions. When he came to review the\r\nfirst session of the reformed parliament he remarked in a private letter\r\nthat what had been foreseen took place, that \"the popular assembly\r\nexercised tacitly supreme power,\" and, without abolishing the crown or\r\nthe house of lords, overawed the convictions of both.[113]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _IRISH COERCION BILL._]\r\n\r\nThe passion for reform, far from spending itself in remodelling the\r\nhouse of commons, filled the statute-book with monuments of remedial\r\nlegislation. No session was more fruitful in legislative activity than\r\nthat of 1833. But the way of legislation was at first blocked against\r\nall projects of improvement by the urgent necessity of passing an Irish\r\ncoercion bill. This had been indicated in the king's speech, and on\r\nFebruary 15, 1833 Grey introduced the strongest measure of repression\r\never devised for curbing anarchy in Ireland. It combined, as he\r\nexplained, the provisions of \"the proclamation act, the insurrection\r\nact, the partial application of martial law, and the partial suspension\r\nof the _habeas corpus_ act\". But the barbarities and terrorism which it\r\nwas designed to put down were beyond precedent and almost beyond belief.\r\nThe attempt to collect the arrears of tithe, even with the aid of\r\nmilitary force, had usually failed, and less than an eighth of the sum\r\ndue was actually levied. The organised defiance of law was not, however,\r\nconfined to refusal of tithes; it embraced the refusal of rent and\r\nextended over the whole field of agrarian relations. The Whiteboys of\r\nthe eighteenth century reappeared as \"Whitefeet,\" and other secret\r\nassociations, under grotesque names, enforced their decrees by wholesale\r\nmurder, burglary, arson, savage assaults, destruction of property, and\r\nmutilation of cattle. In two counties, Kilkenny and Queen's County,\r\nnearly a hundred murders or attempted murders were reported within\r\ntwelve months, and the murderous intimidation of witnesses and jurors\r\nsecured impunity to perpetrators of crimes. No civilised government\r\ncould have tolerated an orgy of lawlessness on so vast a scale, and\r\nnothing but the exigencies of the reform bill can excuse Grey and his\r\ncolleagues for not having grappled with it earlier. Nor does it appear\r\nthat any remedy less stern would have been effectual. Where unarmed\r\ncitizens have not the courage either to protect themselves or to aid the\r\nconstabulary employed for their protection, soldiers, accustomed to face\r\ndeath and inflict it upon others under lawful command, must be called in\r\nto maintain order. Where civil tribunals have become a mockery, summary\r\njustice must be dealt out by military tribunals. Force may be no remedy\r\nfor grievances, but it is the one sovereign remedy for organised crime,\r\nand this was soon to be proved in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe viceroy, Anglesey, true to his liberal instincts, would have\r\npostponed coercion to measures of relief, such as a settlement of the\r\nchurch question. Stanley, on the other hand, insisted on the prompt\r\nintroduction of a stringent peace preservation bill, and his energetic\r\nwill prevailed. The bill contained provisions enabling the\r\nlord-lieutenant to suppress any meeting, establishing a curfew law in\r\ndisturbed districts, and placing offenders in such districts under the\r\njurisdiction of courts martial with legal assessors. It passed the house\r\nof lords with little discussion on the 22nd, and was laid before the\r\nhouse of commons a few days later by Althorp, who had already brought in\r\nan Irish Church temporalities bill. The debate on the address had\r\nalready given warning of the reception which the Irish members would\r\naccord to any coercion bill, and of their malignant hostility to\r\nStanley. Efforts were made to delay its introduction, and full advantage\r\nwas taken of Althorp's statement that one special commission had been\r\ncompletely successful. His opening speech, tame and inconclusive,\r\ndiscouraged his own followers. The fate of the bill appeared doubtful,\r\nbut Stanley, who had twice staked the existence of the ministry on its\r\nadoption, reversed the whole tendency of the debate by a speech of\r\nmarvellous force and brilliancy, which Russell afterwards described as\r\n\"one of the greatest triumphs ever won in a popular assembly by the\r\npowers of oratory\".[114] It was in this speech that he proved himself at\r\nleast a match for O'Connell, whom he scathed with fierce indignation as\r\nhaving lately called the house of commons a body of scoundrels. It cost\r\nmany nights of debate to carry the bill, with slight amendments, but\r\nStanley's appeal had a lasting effect, and it became law in April, to\r\nthe great benefit of Ireland.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _IRISH CHURCH TEMPORALITIES BILL._]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Irish Church temporalities bill was pressed forward as a\r\ncounterpoise to coercion. It imposed a graduated tax upon all episcopal,\r\ncapitular, and clerical incomes above £200 a year, and placed the\r\nproceeds, estimated at £60,000 or £70,000 a year, in the hands of\r\ncommissioners, to be expended in the repairs of churches, the erection\r\nof glebe-houses, and other parochial charges. In this way Irish\r\nratepayers might be relieved of the obnoxious \"vestry cess,\" a species\r\nof Church rate, at the expense of the clergy. A further saving of\r\n£60,000 a year or upwards was to be effected by a reduction of the Irish\r\nepiscopate, aided by a new and less wasteful method of leasing Church\r\nlands attached to episcopal sees. Two out of four Irish archbishoprics\r\nand eight out of eighteen bishoprics were doomed to extinction, as\r\nvacancies should occur. Dioceses and benefices were to be freely\r\nconsolidated, clerical sinecures were to cease, and the more scandalous\r\nabuses of the Irish Church were to be redressed.\r\n\r\nAs a scheme for ecclesiastical rearrangement within the Church itself,\r\nthe bill was sound and liberal, but it was utterly futile to imagine\r\nthat it would be welcomed, except as a mere instalment of conciliation,\r\nby Roman catholics who looked upon the protestant Church itself as a\r\nstanding national grievance. The only boon secured to them was exemption\r\nfrom their share of vestry cess, for, though Althorp intimated that the\r\nultimate surplus to be realised by the union of sees and livings would\r\nbe at the disposal of parliament, they well knew how many influences\r\nwould operate to prevent its reaching them. Not even O'Connell, still\r\nless the ministry, ventured to propose \"concurrent endowment\" as it was\r\nafterwards called, and the very idea of diverting revenues from the\r\nprotestant establishment to Roman catholic uses was disclaimed with\r\nhorror. More than a century earlier, a partition of these revenues\r\nbetween the great protestant communions had been seriously entertained,\r\nand Pitt had notoriously contemplated a provision for the Roman catholic\r\npriests out of state funds. But no such demand was now made, and the one\r\nfeature of the bill which commanded the vigorous support of O'Connell\r\nand his adherents was the 147th section, or \"appropriation clause,\"\r\nwhich enabled parliament to apply the expected surplus of some £60,000\r\nin income, or some £3,000,000 in capital, to whatever purposes, secular\r\nor otherwise, it might think fit to approve. The far-reaching importance\r\nof this principle was fully understood on both sides. To radicals and\r\nRoman catholics it was the sole virtue of the bill; to friends of the\r\nIrish Church and tories it was a blot to be erased at any cost.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the measure was not rapid. Its nature had been explained\r\nby Althorp on February 12, but it was not in print on March 11 when,\r\nnotwithstanding the reasonable protest of Peel, he induced the house to\r\nfix the second reading for the 14th. It was then found that, owing to\r\nits form, it must be preceded by resolutions, in order to satisfy the\r\nrules of the house. These resolutions, containing the essence of the\r\nbill, were proposed on April 1, but were not adopted without a long\r\ndebate, and the debate on the second reading did not begin until May 6.\r\nIt ended in a majority of 317 to 78 for the government, chiefly due to a\r\nmoderate speech from Sir Robert Peel, who, however, denounced the policy\r\nof \"appropriation\". The discussion in committee was far more vehement,\r\nand radicals like Hume did not shrink from avowing their desire to pull\r\ndown the Irish establishment, root and branch. The attack on the\r\nconservative side was mainly concentrated on the appropriation clause.\r\nIn vain was it argued that a great part of the expected surplus was not\r\nChurch property, inasmuch as it would result from improvements in the\r\nsystem of episcopal leases to be carried out by the agency of the state.\r\nEvery one saw that, however disguised, and whether legitimate or not,\r\nappropriation of the surplus for secular purposes would be an act of\r\nconfiscation, and must needs be interpreted as a precedent.\r\n\r\nThe cabinet itself was divided on the subject, and despaired of saving\r\nthe bill in the house of lords, without sacrificing the disputed clause.\r\nOn June 21, therefore, Stanley announced in the house of commons that\r\nthe appropriation clause would be withdrawn, and that any profits\r\narising out of financial reforms within the Church would be allowed to\r\nfall into the hands of the ecclesiastical commissioners. The fury of\r\nO'Connell was unbounded, and not so devoid of excuse as many of his\r\npassionate outbreaks. He treated the Church bill as the stipulated\r\nprice to be paid for the coercion bill, and the appropriation clause as\r\nthe only part of it, except relief from vestry cess, which could possess\r\nthe smallest value for Irish Roman catholics. There was no valid answer\r\nto his argument, except that another collision with the house of lords\r\nmust be avoided at any tolerable cost, for, as Russell bluntly said,\r\n\"the country could not stand a revolution once a year\". Thus lightened,\r\nand slightly modified in the interest of Irish incumbents, the bill\r\npassed through committee and was read a third time by very large\r\nmajorities, the minority being mainly composed of its old radical\r\npartisans. Peel's letters show how anxious he was to \"make the reform\r\nbill work,\" by protecting the government against this extreme\r\nfaction,[115] and the parliamentary reports show how much he did to\r\nfrustrate the attempt to intimidate the lords by a resolution of the\r\ncommons.\r\n\r\nThe debate in the upper house lasted three nights in July, but is almost\r\ndevoid of permanent interest. The appropriation question being dropped,\r\nthere was little to discuss except the historical origin of Irish\r\ndioceses, the precedents for their consolidation, and the economical\r\ndetails of the scheme for equalising, in some degree, the incomes of\r\nIrish clergymen. Two or three peers, headed by the Duke of Cumberland,\r\ntook their stand once more on the coronation oath, and Bishop Phillpotts\r\nof Exeter availed himself of this objection in one of the most powerful\r\nspeeches delivered against the bill. On the other hand, Bishop Blomfield\r\nof London, and the Duke of Wellington, now acting in concert with Peel,\r\ngave it a grudging support, as the less of two evils. After passing the\r\nsecond reading by a majority of 157 to 98, it was subjected to minute\r\ncriticism in committee, and one amendment was carried against the\r\ngovernment, but Grey wisely declined to relinquish it except on some\r\nvital issue. The majority on the third reading was 135 to 81, and on\r\nAugust 2 the commons agreed to the lords' amendments, O'Connell\r\nremarking that, after all, the peers had not made the bill much worse\r\nthan they found it. More than a generation was to elapse before this\r\n\"act to alter and amend the laws relating to the temporalities of the\r\nChurch in Ireland\" was completed by an act severing that Church from\r\nthe state. But the ulterior aims of those who first challenged the\r\nsanctity of Church endowments were not concealed, and the more than\r\nErastian tendency of the liberal movement was henceforth clearly\r\nperceived by high Churchmen. We know, on the authority of Dr. Newman,\r\nthat he and his early associates regarded the Anglican revival of which\r\nthey were the pioneers as essentially a reaction against liberalism, and\r\nliberalism as the most formidable enemy of sacerdotal power.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _STANLEY COLONIAL SECRETARY._]\r\n\r\nLong before the Irish church bill had passed the house of commons\r\nStanley exchanged the chief secretaryship of Ireland for the higher\r\noffice of colonial secretary, to which he was gazetted on March 28. His\r\nuncompromising advocacy of the coercion bill, and his known hostility to\r\ndirect spoliation of the Church, alike provoked the hatred of Irish\r\nRoman catholics, and Brougham had already advised his retirement from\r\nIreland. His promotion was facilitated by the resignation of Durham,\r\nnominally on grounds of health, but also because he was in constant\r\nantagonism to his own father-in-law, Grey, and his moderate colleagues\r\nin the cabinet. He received an earldom, and was succeeded as lord privy\r\nseal by Goderich, who became Earl of Ripon. This opened the colonial\r\noffice to Stanley, who instantly found himself face to face with a\r\nquestion almost as intractable as the pacification of Ireland. Sir John\r\nHobhouse became chief secretary for Ireland, but without a seat in the\r\ncabinet. He resigned in May, and was succeeded by Edward John Littleton,\r\nwho was married to a natural daughter of the Marquis Wellesley.\r\n\r\nAmong the statutes passed in 1833, there are several, besides those\r\nrelating to Ireland, of sufficient importance to confer distinction upon\r\nany parliamentary session. One of these is entitled \"an act for the\r\nbetter administration of justice in His Majesty's privy council\"; a\r\nsecond, \"an act for the abolition of slavery throughout the British\r\ncolonies, for promoting the industry of the manumitted slaves, and for\r\ncompensating the persons hitherto entitled to the services of such\r\nslaves\"; a third, \"an act for the abolition of fines and recoveries, and\r\nfor the substitution of more simple methods of assurance\"; a fourth, \"an\r\nact to regulate the trade to China and India\"; a fifth, \"an act for\r\ngiving to the corporation of the governor and company of the Bank of\r\nEngland certain privileges, for a limited period, under certain\r\nconditions\"; a sixth, \"an act to regulate the labour of children and\r\nyoung persons in the mills and factories of the United Kingdom\". Not one\r\nof these salutary measures was forced upon the legislature by popular\r\nclamour, every one of them represents a sincere zeal for what has been\r\nridiculed as \"world-bettering,\" and the parliament that passed them must\r\nhave been thoroughly imbued with the spirit of reform.\r\n\r\nForemost of these measures, as a monument of philanthropic legislation,\r\nwill ever stand the act for the abolition of colonial slavery. No class\r\nin the country was concerned in its promotion; the powerful interests of\r\nthe planters were arrayed against it; and humanity, operating through\r\npublic opinion, was the only motive which could induce a government to\r\nespouse the anti-slavery cause. Stanley had not occupied his new office\r\nmany weeks when on May 14 it became his lot to explain the ministerial\r\nscheme in the house of commons. Its essence consisted in the immediate\r\nextinction of absolute property in slaves, but with somewhat complicated\r\nprovisions for an intermediate state of apprenticeship, to last twelve\r\nyears. During this period negroes were to be maintained by their former\r\nmasters, under an obligation to serve without wages for three-fourths of\r\ntheir working hours, and were to earn wages during the remaining fourth.\r\nAll children under six years of age were to become free at once, and all\r\nborn after the passing of the act were to be free at birth. The\r\nproprietors were to receive compensation by way of loan, to the extent\r\nof £15,000,000, and additional grants were promised for the institution\r\nof a stipendiary magistracy and a system of education.\r\n\r\nSeveral resolutions embodying the scheme were carried, with little\r\nopposition, though some abolitionists, headed by Mr. Fowell Buxton, a\r\nwealthy brewer and eminent philanthropist, who sat for Weymouth, took\r\nstrong exception to compulsory apprenticeship, as perpetuating the\r\nprinciple of slavery, however mitigated by the recognition of personal\r\nliberty and the suppression of corporal punishment. It was found\r\nexpedient, however, in deference to a very strong remonstrance from West\r\nIndian proprietors, to convert the proposed loan of £15,000,000 into an\r\nabsolute payment of £20,000,000, and this noble donation, for\r\nconscience' sake, was actually ratified by parliament and the country.\r\nThe bill founded on the resolutions met with no serious opposition, but\r\nan amendment by Buxton for adopting free labour at once was lost by so\r\nnarrow a majority that Stanley consented to reduce the period of\r\napprenticeship to an average of six years. In this instance the lords\r\nfollowed the guidance of the commons, and a measure of almost quixotic\r\nliberalism was endorsed by them without hesitation. It must be confessed\r\nthat experience has not verified the confident prediction that free\r\nlabour would prove more profitable than slave labour, but Great Britain\r\nhas never repented of the abolition act, and its example was followed,\r\nthirty years later, by the United States.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _FACTORY ACTS._]\r\n\r\nThe first of the general factory acts was marked by the same\r\nphilanthropic character, but here the manufacturing capitalists,\r\nintroduced by the reform act, were induced by self-interest to oppose\r\nit. Ever since the beginning of the century the sufferings and\r\ndegradation of children in factories had occasionally engaged the\r\nattention of parliament, but the full enormity of the factory system was\r\nknown to few except those who profited by it. It seems incredible, but\r\nit was shown afterwards by irresistible evidence, that children of seven\r\nyears old and upwards were often compelled to work twelve or fourteen\r\nhours a day, with two short intervals for meals, in a most unwholesome\r\natmosphere, exposed not only to ill-treatment but to every form of moral\r\ncorruption. A very partial remedy was applied by a law passed in 1802\r\nwhich restricted the hours of labour to twelve for mills in which\r\napprentices were employed. The same limit of hours was extended to\r\ncotton mills generally in 1816, and, but for the resistance of the house\r\nof lords, it would have been reduced to ten, as a select committee had\r\nrecommended on the initiative of the first Sir Robert Peel. A few years\r\nlater the question was revived by Sir John Hobhouse, but left unsettled.\r\nIn 1831 Sadler introduced a ten hours bill for children, and obtained a\r\nselect committee, before which disclosures were made well calculated to\r\nshock the country. At the general election of 1832, Sadler was defeated\r\nby Macaulay for the new borough of Leeds, but his mantle fell on Lord\r\nAshley, afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury, one of the noblest\r\nphilanthropists of modern times.\r\n\r\nEarly in the session of 1833 Ashley introduced a ten hours bill,\r\napplicable, like that of Sadler, to all young persons under eighteen\r\nyears of age working in factories. It also prohibited the employment of\r\nchildren under nine, and provided for the appointment of inspectors. It\r\nwas strongly opposed by the Lancashire members as interfering with\r\nfreedom of labour even for adults, since mills could not be kept running\r\nwithout the labour of boys under eighteen. They also objected to the\r\nevidence already reported as one-sided, and succeeded in procuring the\r\nappointment of a royal commission. This commission prosecuted its\r\ninquiries with unusual despatch, but its report was not in the hands of\r\nmembers on July 5, when the bill came on for its second reading. Though\r\nAlthorp, unwilling to offend the manufacturing interest, pleaded for\r\ndeliberation and urged that a select committee should frame the\r\nregulations to be adopted, the majority of the house was impatient of\r\ndelay, and he encountered a defeat. The question now resolved itself\r\ninto a choice between a greater or less limitation of hours. On this\r\nquestion, a compromise proposed by Althorp prevailed, and Ashley\r\nresigned the conduct of the bill into his hands. It was further modified\r\nin committee, but ultimately became law in a form which secured the main\r\nobjects of its promoters. No child under nine years of age could be\r\nemployed at all in a factory, after two years none under thirteen could\r\nbe worked more than eight hours, and no young person under eighteen\r\ncould be required to work more than sixty-nine hours a week, while the\r\nprovisions for inspection were retained along with others which\r\ncontained the germ of education on the half-time system.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE EAST INDIA COMPANY._]\r\n\r\nThe trading monopoly of the East India Company, though confined to China\r\nby the act of 1813, had been regarded ever since with great jealousy by\r\nthe mercantile community. As the revised charter was now on the point of\r\nexpiring, it was for the government to frame terms of renewal which\r\nmight satisfy the growing demand for free trade. Their scheme, which few\r\nwere competent to criticise, met with general approval, and the only\r\ndetermined opposition to it was offered in the house of lords by\r\nEllenborough, who lived to come into sharp collision with the court of\r\ndirectors as governor-general. It was embodied in three simple\r\nresolutions, the first of which recommended the legislature to open the\r\nChina trade without reserve, the second provided for the assumption by\r\nthe crown of all the company's assets and liabilities but with the\r\nobligation of paying the company a fixed subsidy, while the last\r\naffirmed the expediency of entrusting the company with the political\r\ngovernment of India. Grant, who moved these resolutions, as president of\r\nthe board of control, had no occasion to defend the policy of setting\r\nfree the China trade which no one disputed; but he undertook to show\r\nthat it had declined in the hands of the company, and that private\r\ncompetition had already crept in on a large scale. He also dwelt on the\r\nadvantage of bringing the political relations arising out of commercial\r\nintercourse more directly under the control of the government. His\r\nreasoning was sound, and the China trade rapidly developed, nor could he\r\nbe expected to foresee the course of events whereby the government\r\nafterwards became embroiled with the Chinese empire, on the importation\r\nof opium, and other economical questions. As compensation for the loss\r\nof its exclusive privileges, the company was to receive an annuity of\r\n£630,000, charged on the territorial revenues of India.\r\n\r\nThe policy of continuing the company's rule in India for twenty years\r\nlonger would have excited more earnest discussion in a session less\r\ncrowded with legislative projects. The way had been paved for the\r\nconcession of complete free trade in the eastern seas by the reports of\r\nselect committees and parliamentary debates under former governments.\r\nThe consumers of tea, numbered by millions, promised themselves a better\r\nquality at a lower price, and a keen spirit of enterprise was kindled by\r\nthe idea of breaking into the unknown resources of China. But public\r\ninterest in the administration of India was languid. It might well have\r\nappeared that a board sitting in Leadenhall Street was fitter to conduct\r\nshipping and mercantile operations than to govern an imperial dependency\r\nlike British India. But the contrary alternative was almost tacitly\r\naccepted. The directors were \"to remain princes, but no longer merchant\r\nprinces,\" and Ellenborough complained that whereas \"hitherto the court\r\nhad appeared in India as beneficent conquerors, henceforth they would be\r\nmortgagees in possession\". Perhaps the ministry shrunk from provoking\r\nthe storm of obloquy which must have resulted from placing the vast\r\npatronage of the company in the hands of the crown. At all events, it\r\nwas agreed, with little dissent, that under the new charter the company\r\nshould nominally retain the reins of power, checked, however, by Pitt's\r\n\"board of control,\" the president of which, in reality, shared a\r\ndespotic authority with the governor-general of Bengal, who was\r\nhereafter to be in name what he had long been in fact, governor-general\r\nof India. The bill strengthened his council, and enabled him to\r\nlegislate for all India.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Europeans were permitted to settle and hold land in\r\nIndia without the necessity of applying for a licence. Lastly, the\r\nprinciple was laid down, pregnant with future consequences, that all\r\npersons in India, without distinction of race or creed, should be\r\nsubject to the same law and eligible for all offices under the\r\ngovernment. Such was the last charter of the great company. It is\r\ninteresting to observe that Grant, in admitting that the government of\r\nIndia under its sway had not been prone \"to make any great or rapid\r\nstrides in improvement,\" paid a just tribute to its eminently pacific\r\ncharacter. \"It excited vigilance,\" he said, \"against any encroachment of\r\nviolence or rapacity; it ensured to the people that which they most\r\nrequired--repose, security, and tranquillity.\" The immense annexations\r\nof territory and far-reaching reforms which have created the British\r\nIndia of the twentieth century were either most reluctantly sanctioned\r\nby the court of directors or have been carried out since its dominion\r\nwas transferred to the crown. Irrevocable as they are, and beneficent as\r\nthey may be on the whole, they have certainly imposed difficulties of\r\nportentous magnitude upon the rulers of India, nor would it be\r\nsurprising if some native survivors of the olden days in far-off\r\nrecesses of the country should remember with sad regret the paternal,\r\nthough unprogressive, despotism of the sovereign company.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE BANK CHARTER ACT._]\r\n\r\nThe bank charter act of 1833, having been superseded by that of 1844,\r\nfills a less important place than it otherwise would in the history of\r\nlegislation on currency. The bill was founded, however, on the report of\r\na secret committee which embraced Peel as well as Althorp and several\r\nother members of high financial repute or great experience in the city.\r\nSince the subject of it was familiar to a large section of members\r\nengaged in business, and touched the pockets of bankers all over the\r\ncountry, it was discussed in the house of commons far more earnestly\r\nthan the bill renewing the charter of the East India Company. In the end\r\ntwo provisions were dropped, which directly encouraged the increase of\r\njoint stock banks. The rest were passed, and contained important\r\nmodifications of the banking system as it then existed. The main\r\nprivileges of the Bank of England were continued, in spite of a strong\r\nopposition and of protests against the one-sided inquiry said to have\r\nbeen conducted by the secret committee. These privileges embraced the\r\nexclusive possession of the government balances, the monopoly of limited\r\nliability, then refused to other banks, and the right, shared by no\r\nother joint stock bank, of issuing its own notes. Though private London\r\nbanks might have legally exercised this power they did not actually do\r\nso, and nearly all of them deposited their reserves with the Bank of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nAnother part of the scheme, which even Peel condemned, was thus briefly\r\nstated in a preliminary resolution: \"That, provided the Bank of England\r\ncontinued liable, as at present, to defray in the current coin of the\r\nrealm all its existing engagements, it was expedient that its promissory\r\nnotes should be constituted a legal tender for sums of £5 and upwards\".\r\nIn other words, country bankers would no longer be compelled to cash\r\ntheir own notes, or pay off their deposits in gold, but might use Bank\r\nof England notes instead, above the value of £5. The Bank of England,\r\nhowever, and all its branches, remained liable to cash payments, as\r\nbefore, so that, as Baring argued, only one intermediate stage was\r\ninterposed between the presentation of a country note and the exchange\r\nof it for specie. Peel's objection, which did not prevail, chiefly\r\nrested on the danger of the Bank of England closing its branches in its\r\nown interests, in order to check the demand for cash. Though his fears\r\nwere not literally realised, experience disclosed the danger of country\r\nbanks multiplying unduly, and, by their over-issue of notes, causing a\r\nsevere drain upon the Bank of England for gold. For the present,\r\nhowever, the critics of the measure were less concerned in forecasting\r\nsuch remote consequences than in protesting against the charge to be\r\nmade by the bank for managing the public debt. This charge was, in fact,\r\nto be reduced by £120,000 a year, but one-fourth part of the advances\r\nmade by the bank to the public (or £3,671,700) was to be paid off, and\r\nthe proposed remuneration was denounced as exorbitant. Althorp hardly\r\ndenied that it was a good bargain for the bank, though he persuaded the\r\nhouse of commons to endorse the arrangement, rather than incur the\r\ndislocation of national finance and commercial business certain to ensue\r\nif the bank should withdraw from its connexion with the government and\r\nuse its vast influence for its own interest alone.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _LEGAL REFORMS._]\r\n\r\nTwo great law reforms close the series of important remedial measures\r\npassed in the first session of the reformed parliament--a session, be it\r\nremembered, which embraced all the furious and protracted debates on the\r\nIrish coercion act and the Irish Church temporalities act. The first of\r\nthese was Brougham's valuable bill constituting a permanent \"judicial\r\ncommittee of the privy council,\" and transferring to it the judicial\r\nfunctions theoretically belonging to \"the king in council,\" but\r\npractically exercised by committees selected _ad hoc_ on each occasion.\r\nCharles Greville, to whose memoirs all historians of this period are\r\ngreatly indebted, and who in 1833 was clerk of the council, was inclined\r\nto disparage the proposed change as one of Brougham's fanciful projects,\r\ndesigned to gratify his own self-importance.[116] Even Greville,\r\nhowever, saw reason to modify his view, and the new court has ever since\r\ncommanded general respect, except from those high Churchmen who resented\r\nits assumption of the appellate jurisdiction in ecclesiastical causes,\r\nformerly vested, along with a similar jurisdiction in admiralty causes,\r\nin the king in chancery, and exercised by a \"court of delegates,\"\r\nusually consisting of three common law judges and three or four\r\ncivilians selected _ad hoc_.\r\n\r\nThe essential defects of such a court were fully stated in the report of\r\na very strong commission, including six bishops, appointed in 1830.\r\nProbably the expediency of reforming the jurisdiction of the privy\r\ncouncil for the purpose of hearing these ecclesiastical appeals may have\r\nsuggested to Brougham the idea of constructing a standing appellate\r\ntribunal within the privy council, for the purpose of hearing all\r\nappeals that might come before that body. Accordingly, after carrying a\r\nbill in 1832 whereby the privy council, as such, took over the powers of\r\nthe \"court of delegates,\" he introduced the general bill whereby the\r\njudicial committee was created, and under which it still acts. It was to\r\nconsist of the lord chancellor, with the present and past holders of\r\ncertain high judicial offices, and two privy councillors to be\r\nappointed by the sovereign; to whom prelates, being privy councillors,\r\nwere to be added for ecclesiastical appeals. The system thus founded,\r\nand since developed, is capable of indefinite expansion, in case still\r\ncloser relations should be established between Great Britain and the\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nThe act for the abolition of fines and recoveries, though scarcely\r\nintelligible except to lawyers, was a masterpiece not only of\r\ndraughtsmanship, but of honest law amendment. It swept away grotesque\r\nand antiquated forms of conveyance, which had lost their meaning for\r\ncenturies, and which nothing but professional self-interest kept alive.\r\nHad it been followed up by legislation in a like spirit on other\r\ndepartments of law, the profits of lawyers and the needless expenses of\r\nclients might have been reduced to an extent of which the unlearned\r\npublic has no conception. As it was, it simplified the process of\r\nselling land in a remarkable degree, though it left untouched the\r\ncomplications of title and transfer affecting real property, which no\r\nlord chancellor since Brougham has been courageous enough to attack in\r\nearnest, and which remain the distinctive reproach of English law. It is\r\nnot without shame that we read in the king's prorogation speech,\r\ndelivered on August 29, 1833, the assurance that he will heartily\r\nco-operate with parliament in making justice easily accessible to all\r\nhis subjects. He adds that, with this view, a commission has been issued\r\n\"for digesting into one body the enactments of the criminal law, and for\r\ninquiring how far, and by what means, a similar process may be extended\r\nto the other branches of jurisprudence\". Seventy years have since\r\nelapsed, yet this royal promise of codification is not even in course of\r\nfulfilment. On the other hand, Brougham's scheme for establishing local\r\ncourts in certain parts of the kingdom was destined to bear ample fruit\r\nin the next reign. It was described by Eldon as \"a most abominable\r\nbill,\" and, being generally opposed by the law lords, was rejected by a\r\nsmall majority, but it was the germ of the county courts, which have\r\nsince done so much to bring justice within the reach and the means of\r\npoor suitors.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its legislative exploits, the whig government was\r\ndeclining in popularity at the end of 1833, and was beginning to\r\ndiscover how vain it is to rely on political gratitude. Other reforming\r\ngovernments have since undergone the same bitter experience, the causes\r\nof which are by no means obscure. No reform can be effected without\r\n\"harassing interests,\" and the sense of resentment in the sections of\r\nthe community thus harassed is far stronger and more efficacious than\r\nany appreciation of the benefits reaped by the general public at home,\r\nor by mankind at large. Again, the expectations excited by the agitation\r\nof such a question as parliamentary reform are far beyond the power of\r\nany legislature to satisfy. Grey and his colleagues were too well aware\r\nof this, and Stanley, for one, manfully championed the government\r\nmeasures on their own merits, disdaining to flatter the radicals, but\r\nhis discretion was not equal to his valour, and every debate brought\r\ninto stronger relief the more statesmanlike capacity and moderation of\r\nPeel. There was no tory reaction, but a growing distrust of heroic\r\nremedies for national disorders, and a growing faith in the possible\r\ndevelopment of a liberal policy in a conservative spirit. Even the Duke\r\nof Wellington found himself restored insensibly to popular favour, and\r\nwas again received in the streets with marks of public respect.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _ALTHORP'S THIRD BUDGET._]\r\n\r\nOf all the ministers, no one enjoyed a greater share of confidence both\r\nin and out of parliament than Althorp. He was not a great financier, but\r\nhe was an honest and prudent chancellor of the exchequer, a free-trader\r\nby conviction, and incapable of those artifices by which a plausible\r\nbalance-sheet may be made out at the cost of future liabilities. Yet his\r\nbudgets of 1831, 1832, and 1833 undoubtedly helped to shake the credit\r\nof the government. The first had been far too ambitious, and became\r\nalmost futile, when the proposed tax on transfers was abandoned, and the\r\ntimber duties left undisturbed. The second was modest enough, and was\r\nsaved from damaging criticism by the absorbing interest of the reform\r\nbill. Considerable reductions were made in the estimates, the revenue\r\nyielded somewhat more than had been expected, and Althorp was enabled to\r\npresent a favourable account in 1833. He anticipated a surplus of about\r\na million and a half, out of which he was prepared to abolish certain\r\nvexatious duties and to decrease others. But the country gentlemen,\r\nheaded by Ingilby, member for Lincolnshire, insisted on a reduction of\r\nthe malt duty by one-half, while the borough members, headed by Sir John\r\nKey, clamoured for a repeal of the house tax and window tax. The former\r\nmotion was actually carried against the government by a small majority,\r\nbut its effect was annulled, and the latter motion was defeated, by a\r\nskilful manoeuvre. This consisted in the proposal by Althorp of a\r\ncounter-resolution, declaring that, if half of the malt tax and the\r\nwhole tax on windows and houses were to be taken off, it would be\r\nnecessary to meet the deficiency by a general income tax. Such a\r\nprospect was equally alarming to the landed interest and the\r\nhouseholders, whose rival demands were mutually destructive, the result\r\nbeing that Althorp's amendment was carried by a large majority, and the\r\ngovernment escaped humiliation, though not without some loss of\r\nprestige.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps to be expected that private members in the first session\r\nof the reformed parliament should be eager to gain a hearing for their\r\nspecial projects of improvement. So it was, but two only of these\r\nprojects deserved historical mention. One of these was the abortive\r\nattempt of Attwood, the radical member for Birmingham, to reverse the\r\npolicy of 1819 by inducing parliament to initiate the return to a paper\r\ncurrency. Cobbett actually followed up this failure by moving for an\r\naddress praying the king to dismiss Sir Robert Peel from his councils, a\r\nmotion defeated by a majority of 295 to 4.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[110] _The Croker Papers_, ii., 198.\r\n\r\n[111] Mahon to Peel (Jan, 8, 1833), Parker, _Sir Robert Peel_, ii., 209.\r\n\r\n[112] Jan. 3, 1833, Parker, _Sir Robert Peel_, ii., 213.\r\n\r\n[113] Peel to Croker (Sept. 28, 1833), _ibid._, p. 224.\r\n\r\n[114] Russell, _Recollections and Suggestions_, p. 113.\r\n\r\n[115] Parker, _Sir Robert Peel_, ii., 212-16.\r\n\r\n[116] Greville, _Memoirs_, ii., 364, 365.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n                RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS AND POOR LAW REFORM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1833, so fruitful in legislation, may be said to have witnessed\r\nthe birth of a religious movement which has profoundly affected the\r\ncharacter of the national Church. The neo-catholic revival, which\r\nafterwards took its popular name from Pusey but drew its chief\r\ninspiration from Newman, was in a great degree the outcome of the reform\r\nact and a reaction against the more than Erastian tendencies of the\r\nreformed parliament. In the early part of the century, as we have seen,\r\npersonal and practical religion was mainly represented by the\r\nevangelical or low Church party, which did admirable service in the\r\ncause of philanthropy, as well as in reclaiming the masses from\r\nheathenism. The high Church party was comparatively inactive, but\r\nco-operated with its rival in opposition to catholic emancipation. The\r\nclergy, as a body, were hostile to reform, and the bishops incurred the\r\nfiercest obloquy by voting against the first reform bill, which had\r\nunfortunately been rejected by a majority exactly corresponding with the\r\nnumber of their votes.[117] The democratic outcry against the Church\r\nbecame louder and louder, as the evils of nepotism, pluralism, and\r\nsinecurism were exposed to public criticism, and a growing disposition\r\nwas shown to deal with Church endowments both in England and in Ireland,\r\nif not as the property of the state, yet as under its paramount control.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE TRACTARIAN MOVEMENT._]\r\n\r\nThe recent infusion of Irish Roman catholics into the house of commons,\r\nfollowing that of Scotch presbyterians a century earlier, rendered it\r\nless and less fit, in the opinion of high Churchmen, to legislate for\r\nthe Church of England, and every concession to religious liberty shocked\r\nthem as a step towards \"National Apostasy\". This was, in fact, the\r\nimpressive title of a sermon preached by John Keble, in July, 1833,\r\nbefore the university of Oxford. From this sermon Newman himself dated\r\nthe origin of the Oxford or \"Tractarian\" movement, but its inward source\r\nlay deeper. Having lost all confidence in the state and even in the\r\nAnglican hierarchy as a creature of the state, a section of the clergy\r\nhad already been looking about for another basis of authority, and had\r\nfound it in theories of apostolical succession and Church organisation.\r\nThe university of Oxford was a natural centre for such a reaction, and\r\nit was set on foot with the deliberate purpose of defending the Church\r\nand the Christianity of England against the anti-catholic aggressions of\r\nthe dominant liberalism. It was not puritanism but liberal secularism\r\nwhich Newman always denounced as the arch-enemy of the catholic faith.\r\nFor, as Wesley's sympathies were originally with high Church doctrines,\r\nso Newman's sympathies were originally with evangelical doctrines, nor\r\nwere they ever entirely stifled by his ultimate secession to the Roman\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nThe later development of this movement, which had its cradle in the\r\ncommon room of Oriel College, belongs rather to ecclesiastical history,\r\nand to the reign of Queen Victoria. But from the first it rallied a\r\nconsiderable body of support. Many who were not influenced by the\r\nmovement, shared its earlier aspirations. Shortly after the formation of\r\nan association, under Newman and Keble's auspices, seven or eight\r\nthousand of the clergy signed an address to the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, insisting upon the necessity of restoring Church discipline,\r\nmaintaining Church principles, and checking the progress of\r\nlatitudinarianism. A large section of the laity ranged themselves on the\r\nside of the revival, and meetings were held throughout England. The king\r\nhimself volunteered a declaration of his strong affection for the\r\nnational Church now militant, and prepared to assert itself, not merely\r\nas a true branch of the catholic Church, but as a co-ordinate power with\r\nthe state. In the autumn of 1833, Newman and one of his colleagues\r\nlaunched the first of that series of tracts from which his followers\r\nderived the familiar name of Tractarians. From that day he was their\r\nrecognised leader, yet he claimed no allegiance and issued no commands.\r\nHe felt himself, not the creator of a new party, but a loyal son of the\r\nold Church, at last awakened from her lethargy. The spell which he\r\nexercised over so many young minds was due to a personal influence of\r\nwhich he was almost unconscious, but which spread from the pulpit of St.\r\nMary's Church and his college rooms at Oriel over a great part of the\r\nuniversity and the Church. It was broken some years later, when he gave\r\nup the _via media_ which he had so long been advocating, accepted the\r\nlogical consequences of his own teaching, and reproached others for not\r\ndiscovering that Anglicanism was but a pale and deformed counterfeit of\r\nthe primitive Christianity represented, in its purity, by the Church of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nLooking back at this movement across an interval of seventy years, we\r\nmay well feel astonished that it satisfied the aspirations of\r\ninquisitive minds in contact with the ideas of their own times. For this\r\nwas the age of Benthamism in social philosophy and \"German neology\" in\r\nbiblical criticism. Though national education was in its infancy, a new\r\ndesire for knowledge, and even a free-thinking spirit, was permeating\r\nthe middle classes, and had gained a hold among the more intelligent of\r\nthe artisans. The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge,\r\nestablished by Brougham, circulated a mass of instructive and\r\nstimulating literature at a cheap rate; popular magazines and\r\ncyclopædias were multiplying yearly; and the British Association, which\r\nheld its first meeting at Oxford in 1832, brought the results of natural\r\nscience within the reach of thousands and tens of thousands incapable of\r\nscientific research. The _Bridgwater Treatises_, which belong to the\r\nreign of William IV., are evidence of a widespread anxiety to reconcile\r\nthe claims and conclusions of science with those of the received\r\ntheology. Thoughtful and religious laymen in the higher ranks of society\r\nwere earnestly seeking a reason for the faith that was in them, and\r\npondering over fundamental problems like the personality of God, the\r\ndivinity of Christ, the reality of supernatural agency, and the awful\r\nmystery of the future life. Yet the tractarians passed lightly over all\r\nthese problems, to exercise themselves and others with disputations on\r\npoints which to most laymen of their time appeared comparatively\r\ntrivial.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE CATHOLIC APOSTOLIC CHURCH._]\r\n\r\nTo them Church authority was supreme, and every catholic dogma a\r\nself-evident truth. What engrossed their reason and consciences was the\r\ndiscussion of questions affecting Church authority, for example, whether\r\nthe Anglican Church possessed the true note of catholicity or was in a\r\nstate of schism, whether its position in Christendom was not on a par\r\nwith that of the monophysite heretics, whether its articles could be\r\nbrought into conformity with the Roman catholic doctrines expressly\r\ncondemned by them, or whether its alliance with Lutheranism in the\r\nappointment of a bishop for Jerusalem did not amount to ecclesiastical\r\nsuicide. Their message, unlike that of the early Christian or methodist\r\npreachers, was for the priestly order, and not for the masses of the\r\npeople; their appeals were addressed _ad clerum_ not _ad populum_; still\r\nless were they suited to influence scientific intellects. But their\r\npropaganda was carried on by men of intense earnestness and holy lives,\r\nfew in number but strong in well-organised combination, and they carried\r\nwith them for a time many to whom any \"movement\" seemed better than\r\nlifeless \"high and dry\" conformity. Herein consisted the secret of their\r\nearly success. Their subsequent failure was inevitable when they were\r\nfairly confronted with protestant sentiment and with the independent\r\nspirit of the age. How their aims were taken up and partially realised\r\nin a new form by new leaders and through new methods, is an inquiry\r\nwhich must be reserved for a later chapter in the history of the English\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nThe strange religious movement which resulted in the foundation of the\r\nso-called Catholic Apostolic Church was of somewhat earlier date, and\r\nits author had already been disavowed as a minister by the presbyterian\r\nChurch before the _Tracts for the Times_ began to startle the religious\r\nworld. The most brilliant part of Edward Irving's career falls within\r\nthe reign of George IV., when his chapel in London was crowded by the\r\nfashionable world, and even attended occasionally by statesmen like\r\nCanning. According to all contemporary testimony he was among the most\r\nremarkable of modern preachers, and his visionary speculations in the\r\nfield of biblical prophecy failed to repel hearers attracted by his\r\nwonderful religious enthusiasm. Compared with the adherents of the\r\nmethodist or of the neo-catholic revival, his followers were a mere\r\nhandful, and his name would scarcely merit a place in history but for\r\nthe impression which he made upon men of high ability and position. What\r\nbrought him into discredit with his own communion and with the public\r\nwas his introduction into his services of fanatics professing the gift\r\nof speaking with \"unknown tongues\". These extravagances led to his\r\ndeposition in 1832, and probably hastened his early death in 1834. But\r\nhis creed did not die with him, and a small body of earnest believers\r\nhas carried on into the twentieth century a definite tradition of the\r\ngospel which he taught.\r\n\r\nFar deeper and more lasting in its effects was the change wrought in\r\ncurrent ideas by the almost unseen but steady advance of science in all\r\nits branches. During this epoch perhaps the most formidable enemy of\r\northodoxy was the rising study of geology, challenging, as it did, the\r\ntraditional theories of creation. The discoveries of astronomy--the law\r\nof gravitation, the rotation of the earth, its place in the solar\r\nsystem, and, above all, the infinite compass of the universe--were in\r\nthemselves of a nature to revolutionise theological beliefs more\r\nradically than any conclusions respecting the antiquity of the earth.\r\nBut it may be doubted whether it was so in fact; at all events,\r\ntheologians had slowly learned to harmonise their doctrines with the\r\nconception of immeasurable space, when they were suddenly required to\r\nadmit the conception of immeasurable time, and staggered under the blow.\r\nThe pioneers of English geology were careful to avoid shocking religious\r\nopinion, and Buckland devotes a chapter of his famous _Treatise on\r\nGeology_ to showing \"the consistency of geological discoveries with\r\nsacred history\". His explanation is that an undefined interval may have\r\nelapsed after the creation of the heaven and the earth \"in the\r\nbeginning\" as recorded in the first verse of Genesis; and he rejects as\r\nopposed to geological evidence \"the derivation of existing systems of\r\norganic life, by an eternal succession, from preceding individuals of\r\nthe same species, or by gradual transmutation of one species into\r\nanother\". But speculations of this order were utterly ignored by such\r\nreligious leaders as Newman and Irving, whose spiritual fervour, however\r\napostolical in its influence on the hearts of their disciples, was\r\nconfined within the narrowest circle of intellectual interests.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _POOR LAW._]\r\n\r\nThe great event of parliamentary history in 1834, and the crowning\r\nachievement of the first reformed parliament, was the enactment of the\r\n\"new poor law,\" as it was long called. No measure of modern times so\r\nwell represents the triumph of reason over prejudice; none has been so\r\ncarefully based on thorough inquiry and the deliberate acceptance of\r\nsound principles; none has so fully stood the conclusive test of\r\nexperience. It is not too much to say that it was essentially a product\r\nof the reform period, and could scarcely have been carried either many\r\nyears earlier or many years later. In the dark age which followed the\r\ngreat war, contempt for political economy, coupled with a weak sentiment\r\nof humanity, would have made it impossible for a far-sighted treatment\r\nof national pauperism and distress to obtain a fair hearing. After the\r\nintroduction of household suffrage, and the growth of socialism, any\r\nresolute attempt to diminish the charge upon ratepayers for the\r\nimmediate relief but ultimate degradation of the struggling masses would\r\nhave met with the most desperate resistance from the new democracy. The\r\nphilosophical whigs and radicals, trained in the school of Bentham, and\r\nuntainted as yet by a false philanthropy, found themselves in possession\r\nof an opportunity which might never have recurred. They deserved the\r\ngratitude of posterity by using it wisely and courageously.\r\n\r\nThe irregular development of the poor laws, from the act of Elizabeth\r\ndown to that of 1834, belongs to economic rather than to general\r\nhistory. It is enough to say here that in later years, and especially\r\nsince the system of allowances adopted by the Berkshire magistrates at\r\nSpeenhamland in 1795 had become general, the original policy of\r\nrelieving only the destitute and helpless, and compelling able-bodied\r\nmen to earn their own living, had been entirely obscured by the\r\nintrusion of other ideas. The result was admirably described in the\r\nreport of a commission, appointed in 1832, with the most comprehensive\r\npowers of investigation and recommendation. The commissioners were the\r\nBishops of London (Blomfield) and Chester (Sumner), Sturges Bourne,\r\nEdwin Chadwick, and four others less known, but well versed in the\r\nquestions to be considered. A summary of the information collected by\r\nthem, ranging over the whole field of poor-law management, was published\r\nin February, 1834. It astounded the benighted public of that day, and it\r\nstill remains on record as a wonderful revelation of ruinous official\r\ninfatuation on the largest possible scale. The evil system was found to\r\nbe almost universal, but the worst examples of it were furnished by the\r\nsouthern counties of England. There, an actual premium was set upon\r\nimprovidence, if not on vice, by the wholesale practice of giving\r\nout-door relief in aid of wages, and in proportion to the number of\r\nchildren in the family, legitimate or illegitimate. The excuse was that\r\nit was better to eke out scanty earnings by doles than to break up\r\nhouseholds, and bring all their inmates into the workhouse. The\r\ninevitable effect of such action was that wages fell as doles increased,\r\nthat paupers so pensioned were preferred by the farmers to independent\r\nlabourers because their labour was cheaper, and that independent\r\nlabourers, failing to get work except at wages forced down to a minimum,\r\nwere constantly falling into the ranks of pauperism.\r\n\r\nHad some theorists of a later generation witnessed the social order then\r\nprevailing in country districts, they would have found several of their\r\nfavourite objects practically attained. There was no competition between\r\nthe working people; old and young, skilled and unskilled hands, the\r\nindustrious and the idle, were held worthy of equal reward, the actual\r\nallowance to each being measured by his need and not by the value of his\r\nwork; while the parochial authorities, figuring as an earthly\r\nprovidence, exercised a benevolent superintendence over the welfare and\r\nliberty of every day-labourer in the village community. The fruits of\r\nthat superintendence were the decline of a race of freemen into a race\r\nof slaves, unconscious of their slavery, and the gradual ruin of the\r\nlandlords and farmers upon whom the maintenance of these slaves\r\ndepended.[118]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _NEW POOR LAW._]\r\n\r\nThe evidence laid before the commissioners not only showed how\r\nintolerable the evil had become in many counties, but also how purely\r\nartificial it was. While the aggregate amount of the poor rate had risen\r\nto more than eight millions and a half, while some parishes were going\r\nout of cultivation and in others the rates exceeded the rental, there\r\nwere certain oases in the desert of agricultural distress where\r\ncomparative prosperity still reigned. These were villages in which an\r\nenlightened squire or parson had set himself to strike at the root of\r\npauperism, and to initiate local reforms in the poor-law system. It was\r\nclearly found that, where out-door relief was abolished or rigorously\r\nlimited, where no allowances were made in aid of wages, and where a\r\nmanly self-reliance was encouraged instead of a servile mendicity, wages\r\nrose, honest industry revived, and the whole character of the village\r\npopulation was improved. Fortified by these successful experiments, the\r\ncommissioners took a firm stand on the vital distinction, previously\r\nignored, between poverty and pauperism. They did not shrink from\r\nrecommending that, after a certain date, \"the workhouse test\" should be\r\nenforced against all able-bodied applicants for relief, except in the\r\nform of medical attendance, and even that women should be compelled to\r\nsupport their illegitimate children. They also advised a liberal change\r\nin the complicated and oppressive system of \"parish settlement,\" whereby\r\nthe free circulation of labour was constricted. They further proposed a\r\nvery large reform in the administrative machinery of the poor laws, by\r\nthe formation of parishes into unions, the concentration of workhouses,\r\nthe separation of the sexes in workhouses, and, above all, the creation\r\nof a central poor-law board, to consist of three commissioners, and to\r\ncontrol the whole system about to be transformed.\r\n\r\nA bill framed upon these lines, and remedying some minor abuses, was\r\nintroduced by Althorp on April 17, having been foreshadowed in the\r\nspeech from the throne, and carefully matured by the cabinet. So wide\r\nand deep was the conviction of the necessity for some radical treatment\r\nof an intolerable evil that party spirit was quelled for a while, and\r\nthe bill met with a very favourable reception, especially as its\r\noperation was limited to five years. It passed the second reading by a\r\nmajority of 299 to 20 on May 9, notwithstanding a violent protest from\r\nDe Lacy Evans, an ultra-radical, who had displaced Hobhouse at\r\nWestminster. The keynote of the radical agitation which followed was\r\ngiven by his declaration that \"the cessation of out-door relief would\r\nlead to a revolution in the country,\" and by Cobbett's denunciation of\r\nthe \"poor man robbery bill\". The _Times_ newspaper, already a great\r\npolitical force, took up the same cry, and had not Peel, with admirable\r\npublic spirit, thrown his weight into the scale of sound economy, a\r\nformidable coalition between extremists on both sides might have been\r\norganised. He stood firm, however; radicals like Grote declined to\r\nbarter principle for popularity, and the bill emerged almost unscathed\r\nfrom committee in the house of commons. It passed its third reading on\r\nJuly 2 by a majority of 157 to 50. Peel's example was followed by\r\nWellington in the house of lords, and Brougham delivered one of his most\r\npowerful speeches in support of the measure. With some modification of\r\nthe bastardy clauses and other slighter amendments it was carried by a\r\nlarge majority, and received the royal assent on August 4.\r\n\r\nNo other piece of legislation, except the repeal of the corn laws, has\r\ndone so much to rescue the working classes of Great Britain from the\r\nmisery entailed by twenty years of war. Its effect in reducing the rates\r\nwas immediate; its effect in raising the character of the agricultural\r\npoor was not very long deferred. Happily for them, though not for the\r\nfarmers, bread was cheap for two years after it came into force. Still,\r\nthe sudden cessation of doles and pensions in aid of wages could not but\r\nwork great hardship to individuals in thousands of rural parishes, and\r\nthere was perhaps too little disposition on the part of the\r\ncommissioners to allow any temporary relaxation of the system. The\r\nrigorous enforcement of the workhouse test, and the harsh management of\r\nworkhouses, continued for years to shock the charitable sensibilities of\r\nthe public, and actually produced some local riots. When the price of\r\nbread rose the clamour naturally increased, and petitions multiplied\r\nuntil a committee was appointed in 1837 to review the operation of the\r\nact. In the end the committee found, as might have been expected, that,\r\nhowever painful the state of transition, the change had permanently\r\nimproved the condition of the poor in England.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _QUESTION OF APPROPRIATION._]\r\n\r\nWhile the bill was still in the house of commons the ministry which\r\nframed it was torn by dissensions; before it came on for its second\r\nreading in the lords Grey had ceased to be premier. The disruption of\r\nhis government had been foreseen for months, but it was directly caused\r\nby hopeless discord on Irish policy. Anglesey had been forced by\r\nill-health to resign the vice-royalty, and the Marquis Wellesley, who\r\nsucceeded him, was more acceptable to Irish nationalists. But the king's\r\nspeech at the opening of the session contained a stern condemnation of\r\nthe repeal movement. O'Connell at once declared war, and the angry\r\nfeelings of his followers were inflamed by a personal and public quarrel\r\nbetween Althorp and Sheil. Another incident, in itself trivial,\r\ndisclosed the discord prevailing in the cabinet on Irish affairs, and,\r\nthough O'Connell was defeated on a motion against the union by a\r\ncrushing majority of 523 to 38, the disturbed state of Ireland continued\r\nto distract the ministerial councils. The ingenious devices of Stanley\r\nand Littleton for solving the insoluble Irish tithe question had proved\r\nalmost abortive; the government officials employed to collect tithe were\r\nalmost as powerless to do so as the old tithe-proctors, and a new\r\nproposal to convert tithe into a land tax was naturally ridiculed by\r\nO'Connell as delusive. He made a speech so conciliatory in its tone as\r\nto startle the house, but no words, however smooth, could now conjure\r\naway the irreconcilable difference of purpose between those who regarded\r\nChurch property as sacred and those who regarded it not only as at the\r\ndisposal of the state, but as hitherto unjustly monopolised by a single\r\nreligious communion. It was reserved for Lord John Russell to \"upset the\r\ncoach\" by openly declaring his adhesion to \"appropriation,\" in the sense\r\nof diverting to other objects, secular or otherwise, such revenues of\r\nthe established Church as were not strictly required for the benefit of\r\nits own members. After this act of mutiny against the collective\r\nauthority of the cabinet Grey's ministry was doomed.\r\n\r\nIts ruin was consummated by a motion of Henry Ward, member for St.\r\nAlbans, which expressly affirmed the right of the state to regulate the\r\ndistribution of Church property and the expediency of reducing the Irish\r\nestablishment. This motion was supposed to have been instigated by\r\nDurham, who had never been loyal to his colleagues. The government was\r\nnotoriously divided upon it; Brougham suggested a commission of inquiry,\r\nby way of compromise; other ministerialists were in favour of meeting\r\nthe difficulty by moving the previous question. Peel was prepared to\r\nsupport the conservative section of the government, and deprecated in\r\nstrong terms \"all manoeuvring, all coquetting with radicals\" in order\r\nto snatch a temporary party triumph.[119]\r\n\r\nWard's resolution was introduced on May 27, 1834, and seconded by Grote,\r\nbut Althorp, instead of replying, announced the receipt of sudden news\r\nso important that he induced the house to adjourn the debate. This news\r\nwas the resignation of Stanley, Graham, Richmond, and Ripon, whose views\r\non appropriation, as afterwards appeared, were shared by Lansdowne and\r\nSpring Rice. The ministry was reconstructed by the accession of Lord\r\nConyngham as postmaster-general, without a seat in the cabinet, and of\r\nLord Auckland, son of Sidmouth's colleague, as first lord of the\r\nadmiralty, by the appointment of Carlisle (already in the cabinet) to be\r\nlord privy seal, and the substitution of Spring Rice for Stanley at the\r\ncolonial office. Edward Ellice, the secretary at war, was included in\r\nthe cabinet, and James Abercromby, afterwards Lord Dunfermline, a son of\r\nthe famous general, Sir Ralph Abercromby, became master of the mint with\r\na seat in the cabinet. Poulett Thomson became president of the board of\r\ntrade, and minor offices were assigned to Francis Baring, and other whig\r\nrecruits. Grey himself, sick of nominal power, was dissuaded with\r\ndifficulty from retiring; Althorp, conscious of failing authority, was\r\nretained in his post only by a high sense of duty. Unfortunately, he was\r\nvery soon entangled by his colleague Littleton in something like an\r\nintrigue with O'Connell, which precipitated the final resignation of\r\nGrey together with his own temporary secession.\r\n\r\nThe details of this affair may be passed over in a few words. What is\r\nclear is that Brougham and Littleton, without the knowledge of Grey, had\r\npersuaded Lord Wellesley, as viceroy of Ireland, not to insist on a\r\nrenewal of the coercion act in its full severity, and especially to\r\nsanction an abandonment of clauses suppressing public meetings. Having\r\nobtained Wellesley's consent behind the backs of Grey and the rest of\r\nthe cabinet, Littleton with the cognisance of Althorp, proceeded to\r\nbargain with O'Connell for an abatement, at least, of his opposition to\r\nall coercion. The cabinet as a body declined to ratify any such\r\nagreement, O'Connell denounced Littleton as having played a trick upon\r\nhim, and Althorp, disdaining to advocate provisions which he was almost\r\npledged in honour to drop, resigned his office and the leadership of the\r\ncommons. Grey, who could not have remained in office without the support\r\nof Althorp's great popularity in the commons, at once resolved to follow\r\nhis example, and on July 9 took leave of political life in a dignified\r\nand pathetic speech. As for Ward's motion, the original cause of Grey's\r\ndesertion by Stanley and his subsequent fall, it had been rejected by an\r\nenormous majority in favour of \"the previous question\" before Althorp's\r\ndisappearance from his old position. Meanwhile Stanley availed himself\r\nof his liberty to make one of his most dashing but least prudent\r\nspeeches, and permanently compromised his reputation for\r\nstatesmanship.[120]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _MELBOURNE PRIME MINISTER._]\r\n\r\nNo other whig possessed the prestige derived by Grey from nearly fifty\r\nyears of consistent public service. Althorp commanded an extraordinary\r\ndegree of confidence in the house of commons and the country, but his\r\nintellectual capacity was not of the highest order, and many expected\r\nthat Peel might receive a summons from the king, whose sympathy with the\r\nwhigs, never very deep, had given place to mistrust. His choice,\r\nhowever, fell upon Melbourne, whom he desired, if possible, to form a\r\ncoalition with Peel, Wellington, and Stanley against the radicals. But\r\nneither Melbourne nor Peel would accept such a coalition, and they both\r\nshowed their wisdom in declining it. The king then empowered Melbourne\r\nto patch up the whig ministry. In deference to a requisition signed by\r\nliberals of all sections, Althorp was induced to withdraw his\r\nresignation, and resumed his leadership in the commons with no apparent\r\ndiminution of popularity. Duncannon, who was created a peer, succeeded\r\nMelbourne at the home office; Lord Mulgrave, son of the first earl,\r\nbecame lord privy seal in place of Carlisle; and Hobhouse entered the\r\ncabinet as first commissioner of woods and forests. The rest of the\r\nsession was mainly spent in discussing the budget and the two Irish\r\nquestions which for so many years were the curse of English politics. A\r\nsurplus of two millions enabled Althorp to propitiate an importunate\r\nclass of taxpayers by repealing the house tax.\r\n\r\nIt would have been more statesmanlike to repeal the window tax or reduce\r\nindirect taxation, but relief was given, as usual, to those who raised\r\nthe loudest clamour, and the vindication of sound finance was reserved\r\nfor a conservative administration. A second and milder Irish coercion\r\nbill was carried by a large majority, with the fatal proviso, which has\r\nmarred the effect of so many later measures, that it should continue in\r\noperation for a year only. A far more serious conflict arose on the new\r\nIrish tithe bill. A complicated plan had been proposed whereby\r\nfour-fifths of the tithe would have been ostensibly secured to the\r\nchurch by conversion into a rent-charge, the remaining fifth being\r\nsacrificed for the sake of peace and security. O'Connell succeeded in\r\ninducing the house of commons to adopt a counter-plan, of a very\r\nsweeping nature, whereby two-fifths of the existing tithe would have\r\nbeen abandoned, and the tithe owner partly compensated out of the\r\nrevenues of suppressed bishoprics, aided by a state grant. The bill thus\r\namended was rejected by a majority of 189 to 122 in the house of lords.\r\nPeel still cherished the idea of settling the question by a system of\r\nvoluntary commutation, but, after the peremptory action of the lords, no\r\ncompromise was likely to be acceptable, and there is some ground for the\r\nopinion that in that division the Irish Church establishment received\r\nits death-blow.\r\n\r\nOn August 15 parliament was prorogued, and the belief of Peel in the\r\nstability of the government may be inferred from the fact that he left\r\nEngland for Italy on October 14. During the vacation, however, two\r\nincidents occurred, trivial in themselves, but pregnant with important\r\nconsequences. One of these was Brougham's triumphant progress through\r\nScotland, where he was enthusiastically received as the saviour of his\r\ncountry, and assumed the air of one who not only kept the king's\r\nconscience but controlled the royal will. The story of this famous tour\r\nexhibits alike the greatness of his powers and the littleness of his\r\ncharacter.[121] The homage paid to him was not undeserved, for he was\r\nassuredly the foremost gladiator of the whig party, and had given proofs\r\nof more varied ability than any living politician or lawyer. But the\r\ndignified eloquence of which he was capable on rare occasions was here\r\nsubmerged in a flood of egotistical rhetoric, which carried him away so\r\nfar that he assumed a political independence which his colleagues deeply\r\nresented, and even spoke of the king in a tone of patronage. Having\r\nlowered himself in public opinion by these speeches, especially at\r\nInverness and Aberdeen, he attended a banquet in honour of Grey at\r\nEdinburgh, where he provoked a passage at arms with Durham. The press,\r\nand especially the _Times_ newspaper, which had formerly loaded him with\r\nextravagant praises, now turned against him, and ridiculed him as a\r\npolitical mountebank. But his worst enemy was the king. William IV.'s\r\nill-concealed impatience of whig dictation had at last been quickened\r\ninto disgust by this and other sources of irritation, when the sudden\r\ndeath of Althorp's father, Earl Spencer, on November 10, gave him an\r\nopportunity which he eagerly seized.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _DESTRUCTION OF HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT._]\r\n\r\nBy a strange fatality, this event almost coincided with the destruction\r\nby fire of the houses of parliament on October 16. This calamity was the\r\nresult of a carelessness, which it is easy to condemn after the event on\r\nthe part of some subordinate officials and the workmen employed by them.\r\nDown to 1826, accounts had been kept at the exchequer by means of wooden\r\ntallies, which were stored in what was called the tally-room of the\r\nexchequer. This room was required in order to provide temporary\r\naccommodation for the court of bankruptcy, and an order was given to\r\ndestroy the tallies. The officials charged with the task decided to burn\r\nthem in the stoves of the house of lords, and the work of burning began\r\nat half-past six in the morning of October 16. The work, hazardous in\r\nany case, was conducted by the workmen with a rapidity that their orders\r\ndid not justify; the flues used for warming the house were overheated,\r\nand though the burning of the tallies was completed between four and\r\nfive, the woodwork near the flues must have smouldered till it burst\r\ninto flame about half-past six in the evening. In less than half an hour\r\nthe house of lords was a mass of fire. About eight a change in the wind\r\nthrew the flames upon the house of commons. That house was almost\r\ncompletely destroyed. The walls of the house of lords and of the painted\r\nchamber remained standing, while the house of lords library, the\r\nparliament offices, and Westminster Hall escaped. The king offered the\r\nparliament the use of Buckingham Palace, but it was found possible to\r\nfit up the house of lords for the commons and the painted chamber for\r\nthe lords. When the legislature reassembled on February 9, 1835, a\r\nconservative ministry was in office, though not, indeed, in power.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for a later age to understand why the accession of\r\nAlthorp to a peerage should have afforded even a plausible reason for a\r\nchange of ministry. The position which Althorp held in the house of\r\ncommons is puzzling to a later generation.[122] It is well known that\r\nGladstone recorded the very highest estimate of his public services. Yet\r\nhe was not only no orator but scarcely in the second order of speakers,\r\nhe made no pretence of far-sighted statesmanship, he was not a\r\nsuccessful financier, and he made several blunders which must have\r\ndamaged the authority of any other man. The influence which he obtained\r\nin leading the unreformed as well as the reformed house of commons was\r\nentirely due to his character for straightforward honesty, perhaps\r\nenhanced by his social rank, and his reputation for possessing all the\r\nvirtues of a country gentleman. The national preference for amateurs\r\nover professionals in politics, no less than in other fields of energy,\r\nfound an admirable representative in him, and he was all the more\r\npopular as a political leader because it was believed that he had no\r\ndesire to be a political leader at all. At all events, he inspired\r\nconfidence in all, and it was no mere whim of the king which treated his\r\nremoval from the commons to the lords as an irreparable loss to\r\nMelbourne's administration.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _MELBOURNE'S RESIGNATION._]\r\n\r\nIt is often stated that \"without a word of preparation\" the king got rid\r\nof his whig ministers on November 14, 1834, and it must be admitted that\r\nhe afterwards took credit to himself for their dismissal as his own\r\npersonal act. But this view is not altogether borne out by contemporary\r\nevidence. A published letter, of the 12th, from Melbourne to the king\r\nshows that, as premier, he took the initiative in representing that,\r\nwhereas \"the government in its present form was mainly founded upon the\r\npersonal weight and influence possessed by Earl Spencer in the house of\r\ncommons,\" it was for the king to consider whether, as \"that foundation\r\nis now withdrawn,\" a change of ministry was expedient.[123] It also\r\nappears from a letter placed by the king in Melbourne's hands that a\r\n\"very confidential conversation\" took place between them at Brighton, in\r\nconsequence of which the king resolved to send for Wellington.[124] In\r\nthe course of this conversation Melbourne informed the king that, in the\r\nopinion of the cabinet, Lord John Russell should be selected for the\r\nleadership of the house of commons. The king, incensed by Lord John's\r\naction on the Irish Church question, would not hear of this arrangement,\r\nespecially as he thought Lord John \"otherwise unequal to the task,\" and\r\ndisparaged the claims of other possible candidates.[125] He also\r\nstrongly resented the recent conduct of Brougham. In the end, he parted\r\nkindly and courteously from Melbourne, who actually undertook to convey\r\nthe king's summons to Wellington. Another memorandum by the king, of the\r\nsame date, proves that a fear of further encroachments on the church was\r\nreally uppermost in his mind, and that he anticipated, not without\r\nreason, \"a schism in the cabinet\" on this very subject.[126]\r\n\r\nWellington acted with his customary promptitude, and with his customary\r\nobedience to what he regarded as a call of public duty. A certain degree\r\nof mistrust had existed between him and Peel, arising, in part, out of\r\ncircumstances preceding the duke's election to the chancellorship of\r\nOxford University. This suspension of cordiality had now passed away,\r\nand Wellington strongly urged the king to entrust Peel, then at Rome,\r\nwith the formation of a new government. Hudson, afterwards known as Sir\r\nJames Hudson, delivered the despatch recalling him on the night of the\r\n25th. Peel started from Rome on the 26th and, travelling with a speed\r\nthen considered marvellous, reached Dover within twelve days on the\r\nnight of December 8. He was in London on the 9th, and, without\r\nconsulting any one else, immediately placed his services at the king's\r\ndisposal. In the meantime, Wellington had stepped into the gap, and\r\nactually held all the secretaryships of state in his own hands, pending\r\nthe arrival of Peel.\r\n\r\nThe king had been encouraged to hustle his ministers unceremoniously out\r\nof office by a paragraph which appeared in the _Times_ of November 15.\r\nOn the previous evening Brougham had been informed by Melbourne in\r\nconfidence that the king had accepted his suggestion of resignation, and\r\nhe carried the news to the _Times_, which, without giving Brougham's\r\nname, published his message in his own words. It stated that the king\r\nhad turned out the ministry, and ended with the words: \"The queen has\r\ndone it all\". After this the king was determined to be done with his\r\nministers as quickly as possible. It is certain that neither Wellington\r\nnor Peel wished to be thought responsible for their dismissal, the\r\npropriety of which they both secretly doubted. The king, however, had\r\nacted within his strict rights, and the outgoing ministers, as a whole,\r\nwere not ill pleased to be relieved from the burdens of office.\r\n\r\nPeel, though by no means hopeful of ultimate success, endeavoured to\r\nconstruct a cabinet on a comprehensive basis. He first obtained the\r\nking's \"ready assent\" to his inviting the co-operation of Stanley, who\r\nhad succeeded to the courtesy title of Lord Stanley, and Sir James\r\nGraham. These overtures were declined in friendly terms, and both\r\npromised independent support. But Stanley explicitly declared that, in\r\nhis judgment, \"the sudden conversion of long political opposition into\r\nthe most intimate alliance would shock public opinion, would be ruinous\r\nto his own character,\" and would rather injure than strengthen the new\r\ngovernment.[127] After this failure, Peel felt his task well-nigh\r\nhopeless, and though he spared no effort to procure an infusion of fresh\r\nblood, he complained that after all \"it would be only the duke's old\r\ncabinet\".[128] There was, in fact, no man of known ability in it, except\r\nhimself, the Duke of Wellington (as secretary for foreign affairs), and\r\nLyndhurst, the chancellor; for the capacity of Aberdeen, who had been\r\nforeign secretary under Wellington, and who now became secretary for war\r\nand the colonies, and Ellenborough, who returned to the board of\r\ncontrol, had not yet been generally recognised. Peel himself became\r\nfirst lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer; Goulburn was\r\nhome secretary, Rosslyn lord president, and Wharncliffe lord privy seal.\r\nEarl de Grey, elder brother of the Earl of Ripon, was made first lord of\r\nthe admiralty, Murray became master-general of the ordnance, Alexander\r\nBaring president of the board of trade and master of the mint, Herries\r\nsecretary at war, and Sir Edward Knatchbull paymaster of the forces. It\r\nwas fully understood that a conservative government, even purged of\r\nultra-tory elements, could not face the first reformed house of commons,\r\nand the dissolution which took place at the end of the year had been\r\nregarded by all as inevitable.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE TAMWORTH MANIFESTO._]\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of this event, Peel issued an address to his\r\nconstituents which became celebrated as the \"Tamworth manifesto\". It is\r\nsomewhat cumbrous in style, but it embodies with sufficient clearness\r\nthe new conservative policy of which Peel was the real author and\r\nhenceforth the leading exponent. It opens with an appeal to his own\r\nprevious conduct in parliament, as showing that, while he was no\r\napostate from old constitutional principles, neither was he \"a defender\r\nof abuses,\" nor the enemy of \"judicious reforms\". In proof of this, he\r\ncites his action in regard to the currency and various amendments of the\r\nlaw; to which he might have added his adoption of catholic emancipation.\r\nHe then declares, absolutely and without reserve, that he accepts the\r\nreform act as \"a final and irrevocable settlement of a great\r\nconstitutional question,\" which no friend to peace and the welfare of\r\nthe country would seek, either directly or indirectly, to disturb. He\r\napproves of making \"a careful review of institutions, civil and\r\necclesiastical, undertaken in a friendly temper,\" with a view to \"the\r\ncorrection of proved abuses, and the redress of real grievances,\" and\r\nthat \"without mere superstitious reverence for ancient usages\". He lays\r\nstress on his recorded assent to the principle of corporation reform,\r\nthe substitution of a treasury grant for Church rates, the relief of\r\ndissenters from various civil disabilities (but not from university\r\ntests), the restriction of pensions (saving vested interests), the\r\nredistribution of Church revenues and the commutation of tithes, but so\r\nthat no ecclesiastical property be diverted to secular uses. After these\r\nspecific pledges, the Tamworth manifesto concludes with more general\r\nprofessions of a progressive conservatism equally removed from what are\r\nnow called \"advanced radicalism\" and \"tory democracy\".[129] It was, of\r\ncourse, too liberal for the followers of Eldon, and was ridiculed as\r\ncolourless by extreme reformers, but its effect on the country was\r\ngreat, and it did much to win popular confidence for the new ministry.\r\nIf such a policy must be called opportunism, it was opportunism in its\r\nbest form; and opportunism in its best form, under the conditions of\r\nparty government, is not far removed from political wisdom.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[117] If all the bishops present had not merely abstained, but actually\r\nvoted in favour of the measure, it would have been carried by one vote.\r\n\r\n[118] Sir George Nicholls, _History of the English Poor Law_, vol. ii.,\r\nsee especially pp. 242, 243.\r\n\r\n[119] Peel to Goulburn (May 25, 1834), Parker, _Sir Robert Peel_, ii.,\r\n244.\r\n\r\n[120] Hatherton, _Memoir_; Creevey, _Memoirs_, ii., 285-88.\r\n\r\n[121] See Campbell's _Lives of the Chancellors_, viii., 446-57.\r\n\r\n[122] Compare Walpole, _History of England_, iii., 478.\r\n\r\n[123] _Lord Melbourne's Papers_, p. 220.\r\n\r\n[124] _Ibid._, pp. 222, 223.\r\n\r\n[125] Stockmar, _Memoirs_ (English translation), i., 330.\r\n\r\n[126] Parker, _Sir Robert Peel_, ii., 235.\r\n\r\n[127] Stanley to Peel (Dec. 11, 1834), Peel's _Memoirs_, ii., 39, 40.\r\n\r\n[128] Croker to Mrs. Croker, _Croker Papers_, ii., 219.\r\n\r\n[129] Peel, _Memoirs_, ii., 58-67.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n                           PEEL AND MELBOURNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general election which took place in January, 1835, was hotly\r\ncontested, and in the second reformed parliament the conservatives\r\nmustered far stronger than in the first. The party now consisted of some\r\n270 members, chiefly returned by the counties. But they were still\r\noutnumbered by the whigs, radicals, and Irish repealers combined, and it\r\nwas certain that an occasion for such a combination would soon arise. It\r\nwas found at once in the election of a speaker, when the house of\r\ncommons met on February 9, 1835. Sutton, now Sir Charles Manners Sutton,\r\nwas proposed for re-election by the government; the opposition candidate\r\nwas Abercromby. The number of members who took part in the division was\r\nthe largest ever assembled, being 622, and Abercromby was elected by a\r\nmajority of ten. It would have been larger, had not the government been\r\nsupported by some waverers, but its significance was appreciated by the\r\nministers, and still more by the king. He expressed his displeasure in a\r\nvery outspoken letter to Peel, declaring that, if the leaders \"of the\r\npresent factious opposition\" should be forced upon him by a refusal of\r\nthe supplies, he might, indeed, tolerate them, but could never give them\r\nhis confidence or friendship. Two days later, the 24th, the king's\r\nspeech was delivered, reflecting the spirit of the Tamworth\r\nmanifesto.[130]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _PEEL'S POLICY._]\r\n\r\nThe government was again defeated by seven on an amendment to the\r\naddress, notwithstanding the loyal aid of Graham and Stanley, whose\r\nattitude during the general election had excited Peel's mistrust. In the\r\ncourse of this debate, the prime minister, abandoning his usual reserve,\r\ndefinitely pledged himself not only \"to advance, soberly and cautiously,\r\nin the path of progressive improvement,\" but to bring forward specific\r\nmeasures. \"I offer you,\" he said, \"reduced estimates, improvements in\r\ncivil jurisprudence, reform of ecclesiastical law, the settlement of the\r\ntithe question in Ireland, the commutation of tithe in England, the\r\nremoval of any real abuse in the Church, the redress of those grievances\r\nof which the dissenters have any just ground to complain.\" Nor were\r\nthese offers illusory or barren. On March 17, he brought in a bill to\r\nrelieve dissenters from disabilities in respect of marriage, which met\r\nwith general approval. It was founded on the simple principle, since\r\nadopted, of giving legal validity to civil marriages duly solemnised\r\nbefore a registrar, and leaving each communion to superadd a religious\r\nsanction in its own way. The marriages of Churchmen in a church were to\r\nbe left on their old footing, but Churchmen were of course to be granted\r\nthe same liberty as other citizens of contracting a purely civil\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nStill more important, as examples of conservative reform, were Peel's\r\nefforts to purge the established Church of abuses, and to introduce a\r\nvoluntary commutation of tithes. His correspondence amply shows how\r\nlarge a space these remedial measures occupied in his mind, and one of\r\nhis first acts was to appoint an ecclesiastical commission, with\r\ninstructions to institute a most comprehensive inquiry into every\r\nsubject affecting the distribution of church revenues. Compared with the\r\npetty squabbles over the appropriation of an imaginary surplus to be\r\nderived from Irish tithes which it was impossible to collect, the\r\nschemes of Peel for purifying and strengthening the Church of England\r\nassume heroic proportions. The report of the ecclesiastical commission\r\noriginated by him, with its startling disclosures of pluralism and\r\nnon-residence, became the basis of legislation which has wrought a\r\nveritable revolution in the financial and disciplinary administration of\r\nthe church. His tithe bill, abortive as it was in 1835, was reproduced,\r\nwith little alteration, in the tithe commutation act of 1836.\r\n\r\nBut the whig-radical allies of 1835 had not the smallest intention of\r\ngiving Peel a fair trial; nor indeed had they any other object beyond\r\nthe recovery of power. His appeals to his opponents, though by no means\r\nwithout effect in the country, fell upon deaf ears in the house of\r\ncommons, and further humiliations followed rapidly. One of these was the\r\nsuccessful outcry against the appointment of Londonderry, who had\r\nexcited much hostility as an uncompromising enemy to reform, to the\r\nembassy at St. Petersburg, in consequence of which he, very honourably,\r\nrelieved the government from obloquy by declining the post. A motion to\r\nrepeal the malt tax was decisively defeated, and soon afterwards a\r\nmotion in favour of granting a charter to the University of London was\r\ncarried against the government by a large majority. Then came a defeat\r\non a motion for adjournment, and the arts of obstruction were\r\nobstinately practised in debates on the estimates. At last the\r\ninevitable crisis arrived, and, as might be expected, the final issue\r\nwas taken upon an Irish question.\r\n\r\nThe influence of O'Connell and his \"tail,\" as his followers were called,\r\nhad been neutralised, since the reform act, by the overwhelming strength\r\nof the whigs, and the public-spirited action of Peel, who, as leader of\r\nthe conservative opposition, actually supported the whig government in\r\nsixteen out of twenty most important contests on domestic policy. A very\r\ndifferent spirit was now shown by the whig opposition, and an evil\r\nprecedent, pregnant with disastrous consequences, was set by the famous\r\n\"Lichfield House compact\". This was a close alliance between O'Connell\r\nand those whom he had so fiercely denounced as \"the base, brutal, and\r\nbloody whigs\". It bore immediate fruit in a motion of Russell for a\r\ncommittee of the whole house to consider the temporalities of the Irish\r\nChurch. After a debate of four nights, the resolution was carried, on\r\nMarch 30, by a majority of thirty-three. On April 5, a further\r\nresolution was carried by a majority of twenty-five for applying any\r\nsurplus-funds \"to the general education of all classes of the people\r\nwithout religious distinction,\" and was more emphatically affirmed two\r\ndays later by a majority of twenty-seven.\r\n\r\nPeel had long been conscious of the hopelessness of his position and\r\nimpatient of maintaining the struggle. He felt the constitutional danger\r\nof allowing the executive government to become a helpless instrument in\r\nthe hands of a hostile majority in the house of commons. Nothing but the\r\nearnest remonstrances of the king and his tory friends, including\r\nWellington, had induced him to retain office so long, and, after the\r\ndivision of the 7th, he firmly resolved to resign. On doing so, he\r\nreceived from the whole conservative party, of which he was the\r\ncreator, a most cordial address of thanks and confidence. Though his\r\nshort administration had consolidated the whig forces for the moment,\r\nand given them a new lease of power, it showed him to be the foremost\r\nstatesman in the country, and paved the way for his triumphant return to\r\noffice. As Guizot said, he had proved himself \"the most liberal of\r\nconservatives, the most conservative of liberals, and the most capable\r\nman of all in both parties\".\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _MELBOURNE'S SECOND MINISTRY._]\r\n\r\nThe king now discovered the fatal mistake which he had made in\r\n\"dismissing\" his whig cabinet, as he boasted, instead of waiting for it\r\nto break down under the stress of internal dissensions. His first idea\r\nwas to fall back on Grey, who had already betrayed his growing mistrust\r\nof radicalism, but Grey declined to enter the lists again. There was no\r\nresource but to recall Melbourne, whom the king personally liked, and to\r\nput up with the elevation of Russell to a position which all admitted\r\nhim to have fairly earned. He became home secretary, as well as leader\r\nof the house of commons, and the new whig cabinet differed little from\r\nthe old. Palmerston, Lansdowne, Auckland, Thompson, and Holland returned\r\nto their former offices. Grant was made secretary for war and the\r\ncolonies, Duncannon became lord privy seal, Spring Rice chancellor of\r\nthe exchequer, Hobhouse president of the board of control, and Viscount\r\nHowick, son of Earl Grey, was appointed secretary at war. Outside the\r\ncabinet, Viscount Morpeth, son of the Earl of Carlisle, became Irish\r\nsecretary. The most significant difference between the two cabinets lay\r\nin the omission of Brougham, which was effected by the expedient of\r\nplacing the great seal in commission. This negative act was, in reality,\r\nthe boldest and most perilous in Melbourne's political life. A\r\ncorrespondence between Brougham and Melbourne in February must have made\r\nclear to the ex-chancellor that he would be excluded from office, and he\r\nreluctantly acquiesced in Melbourne's decision, hoping that it would be\r\nmerely temporary, and that he would soon resume his place on the\r\nwoolsack as the dominant member of the cabinet, but his exclusion was\r\ndestined to be final, and the close of a career to which English history\r\nin the nineteenth century presents no parallel.[131]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _BROUGHAM._]\r\n\r\nBrougham was called to the Scottish bar at the age of twenty-one, having\r\nalready given proof of brilliant ability and rare versatility at the\r\nUniversity of Edinburgh. He was the youngest and most prolific of the\r\noriginal writers in the _Edinburgh Review_, then a very powerful organ\r\nof whig opinion, and his contributions to it ranged over some thirty\r\nyears after its first appearance in 1802. He was already twenty-nine\r\nwhen he joined the English bar in 1808, and though he never rivalled\r\nEldon as a lawyer or Scarlett as a persuasive advocate, he soon became\r\nan acknowledged master of the highest forensic eloquence. His fame was\r\nalready established by his argument before parliament against the orders\r\nin council when he entered the house of commons in 1810. There his\r\npassionate oratory and power of invective made him the most formidable\r\nof party speakers, and it was said that Canning alone could face him on\r\nequal terms in debate. Except during four years, 1812-16, when he was\r\nout of parliament, his prodigious energy and versatility were the\r\ngreatest intellectual force on the liberal side throughout all the\r\npolitical conflicts under the regency and the reign of George IV. His\r\nspeeches embraced every question of foreign, colonial, or domestic\r\npolicy, and it may truly be said that no salutary reform was carried\r\nduring that period of which he was not either the author or the active\r\npromoter. The suppression of the slave-trade which had revived after the\r\ngreat war, the liberty of the press, the cause of popular\r\neducation--these were among the almost innumerable objects, outside the\r\ncommon run of politics, and largely philanthropic, to which he devoted\r\nhis restless mind, before it was engrossed for a while by parliamentary\r\nreform. There, as we have seen, he showed a moderation which had not\r\nbeen expected of him, nor is it too much to say that, both as a leader\r\nof the bar and as chancellor, he made good his claim to be the greatest\r\nof law reformers.\r\n\r\nHis famous speech of February 7, 1828, had quickened the germs of many\r\nlegal improvements carried out in a later age, and the four years of his\r\nchancellorship actually produced great constructive amendments of the\r\nlaw, such as the institution of the central criminal court and the\r\njudicial committee of the privy council. Other reforms, in bankruptcy,\r\ncriminal law, and equity, were mainly due to his initiative, and it was\r\nhe who originated the county courts, though his bill was recklessly\r\nthrown out by the house of lords on party grounds. His public life, up\r\nto the year 1835, was perhaps the most brilliant and the most useful of\r\nthe century, yet it was hopelessly marred in the end by a certain\r\neccentric vanity, and want of loyalty to colleagues, not inconsistent\r\nwith the higher ambition of leaving the world better than he found it.\r\nFor some years after his fall he retained his astounding energy, and\r\neven his ascendency in the house of lords, where Lyndhurst, his only\r\npossible rival, was astute enough to court his co-operation. Never was\r\nhis fertility in debate more conspicuously shown than in the session of\r\n1835, while he was still nominally a supporter of the whig government.\r\nThe last stage of his life, extending over more than thirty years,\r\nbelongs to another chapter of English history; it is enough here to\r\nnotice that, whatever his political aberrations, he continued in his\r\nisolation and old age to work zealously for those social reforms which\r\nhe sincerely had at heart. The popularity which had been to him as the\r\nbreath of life never, indeed, returned to him, and his figure no longer\r\noccupies a foremost place in the gallery of our statesmen, but the\r\nresults of his noble services to humanity remain, and the memory of them\r\nought not to be obscured by the sad record of his failings.\r\n\r\nThe new Melbourne administration came in with unfavourable omens.\r\nRussell failed to secure his re-election in South Devon, but a seat was\r\nfound for him at Stroud, and though the premier emphatically denied that\r\nhe had made any bargain with O'Connell, the Irish people believed it.\r\nAccordingly, they received the whig lord-lieutenant, Mulgrave, with a\r\ntumultuous procession, as if his advent portended the repeal of the\r\nunion and extinction of tithes. An attempt to solve the insoluble tithe\r\nquestion was, in fact, among the earliest efforts of the government, and\r\nMorpeth, as chief secretary, introduced a very reasonable measure,\r\ndiffering little, except in details, from that of his predecessor. Like\r\nother proposals for agrarian settlements in Ireland, it involved a\r\ncertain sacrifice on the part of the tithe-owner for the sake of\r\nsecurity, and a subsidy from the state to relieve of arrears the\r\ndefaulting and rebellious tithe-payers. Peel stated his intention of\r\nsupporting these provisions for commutation, if they could be separated\r\nfrom other provisions for \"appropriation,\" coupled with them under the\r\ninfluence of political necessity rather than of sound policy. The\r\nproposals for appropriation were so moderate that little would have been\r\nlost by dropping or gained by carrying them, but, moderate as they were,\r\nthey embodied a principle on which either party was resolved to stand or\r\nfall. The consequence might have been foreseen. The bill, as a whole,\r\nwas passed in the house of commons, and even read a second time in the\r\nhouse of lords, after which the appropriation clauses were rejected in\r\nthat assembly by a large majority. Thereupon Melbourne withdrew the\r\nscheme altogether. Thus a question of third-rate importance, having been\r\nthe chronic difficulty of four Irish secretaries, was left to stand over\r\nfor three years longer, and ultimately to be settled on the very basis\r\nwhich Stanley and Peel had accepted from the first. A greater waste of\r\nparliamentary time has perhaps never been recorded.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS BILL._]\r\n\r\nThe session of 1835, however, was rendered memorable by the enactment of\r\none beneficent measure of the first magnitude. This measure--the\r\nmunicipal corporations act--was preceded, like the new poor law, by a\r\nthorough and exhaustive inquiry. A committee of the house of commons,\r\nfollowed by a commission, had been appointed in 1833. The commission\r\nprosecuted careful researches into the local conditions of each\r\nmunicipality, and did not conclude its labours until 1835. Its report\r\nlaid bare not merely grotesque anomalies, but the grossest abuses of\r\nelection and administration in boroughs ruled by small, corrupt, and\r\nirresponsible oligarchies which then abounded in England, and, still\r\nmore, in Scotland.[132] The reform act had paved the way for the\r\npurification of such urban communities, by disfranchising the smallest\r\nand most venal of them, by extending the boundaries of many others, by\r\nenfranchising great towns which had remained outside the pale of\r\nrepresentation, and by conferring the suffrage, theretofore monopolised\r\nby freemen and other privileged classes, on the unprivileged mass of\r\nten-pound householders.\r\n\r\nThe municipal corporations bill, in its ultimate form, rested on the\r\nsame broad lines of policy. It imposed upon all boroughs, with the\r\nexception of the city of London and a few of minor importance, one\r\nconstitutional form of government, identical in all its essential\r\nfeatures with those which a few model boroughs already possessed. The\r\ngoverning body was to consist of a mayor, aldermen, and councillors,\r\ntogether forming a town council. The councillors were to be elected\r\ndirectly by ratepaying occupiers, with a saving for the prescriptive\r\nrights of existing freemen. They were to hold office for three years;\r\nthe aldermen were to be elected by the councillors for six years, with a\r\nprovision for retirement by rotation. The mayor was to be elected\r\nannually by the town council. The elementary powers of local government,\r\nsuch as the control of lighting and the constabulary force, were to be\r\ntransferred (subject to certain exceptions) from the hands of committees\r\ninto those of the one recognised and supreme municipal authority. Other\r\nclauses provided for a division of the larger boroughs into wards, for\r\nthe abolition of exclusive trading privileges, for the public management\r\nof charity estates, and for the appointment, at the option of each\r\nborough, of a recorder, for the purposes of jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nSuch were the main outlines of the great measure introduced by Russell,\r\nto which Peel heartily gave his adhesion. It was a natural, and almost\r\nnecessary, sequel of the reform act, which had already broken up many\r\nnests of jobbery, curtailed the lucrative exercise of the elective\r\nfranchise by freemen, and undermined the influence of those self-elected\r\nrulers who, in the worst boroughs, had become gangs of public thieves.\r\nSupported by Peel, the bill was read a second time in the house of\r\ncommons, on June 15, without a division. Several conservative amendments\r\nwere defeated in committee by small majorities, and the bill was sent up\r\nto the lords on July 21. There its fate was far different. Though\r\nWellington himself was not disposed to obstruct it, he entirely failed\r\nto check the obstructive tactics of Lyndhurst who, on this occasion,\r\noutdid himself in the deliberate mutilation of a bill approved by the\r\nlate conservative premier. Lord Campbell, no partial judge of Brougham,\r\nhas left on record his belief that, but for his faithful and vigorous\r\nsupport, the scheme of municipal reform must have been utterly\r\nwrecked.[133] It was allowed to be read a second time, but with the\r\nfull concurrence of Eldon and all the ultra-tory peers, Lyndhurst\r\nsucceeded in pulling it to pieces in committee. For instance, one of the\r\namendments imported into it perpetuated proprietary rights which it was\r\na chief object of the bill to abolish; another gave aldermen a\r\nlife-tenure of their offices; a third retained a part of the old town\r\ncouncillors on the new town councils. Proud as he was of his destructive\r\nexploits, as a triumph of toryism over conservatism, Lyndhurst soon\r\nfound that he could not so lightly override the wiser counsels of Peel.\r\nWhen the lords' amendments came to be considered in the commons, Russell\r\nprudently advised the acceptance of the less important, and the\r\ndisallowance of those inconsistent with the principle of the bill. He\r\nwas followed by Peel who, professing to uphold the independence of the\r\nupper house, declared against the more obnoxious amendments, and\r\nstickled only for points which the ministry was not unwilling to\r\nconcede. His action proved decisive. The commons stood firm on the main\r\nissues, and the hostile party in the lords, who had vowed to mar this\r\nreform, flinched at the last moment. Many of them abstained from\r\nattendance. Wellington and even Lyndhurst recommended concession;\r\nconferences took place between the houses, at which Russell played the\r\npart of moderator, and on September 9 the corporation bill became law,\r\nnot in its entirety, but in all its essential features.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this pacific compromise, popular feeling ran higher than\r\never against the house of lords which, under the evil influence of\r\nLyndhurst, seemed bent on thwarting every liberal measure. John Roebuck,\r\nmember for Bath, a prominent radical, who acted independently of party\r\nconnexions, took a lead in denouncing their conduct, and went so far as\r\nto propose giving them a merely suspensory, instead of an absolute, veto\r\non legislation. A sweeping reform in their constitution was loudly\r\nadvocated in the press. O'Connell, exasperated by their wanton rejection\r\nof a Dublin police bill, spent a part of the parliamentary recess in a\r\ntour over the north of England and Scotland, exhausting the stores of\r\nhis scurrilous invective in pouring contempt on the 170 tyrants who\r\ncould dare to withstand the will of the people. But O'Connell's\r\neloquence, marvellous as it was, never stirred British audiences as it\r\nstirred the Irish masses, and it happened that at this moment he was\r\nsomewhat discredited by accusations of corruption afterwards proved to\r\nbe false. The house of lords not only survived his attacks, but was\r\ninstigated by Lyndhurst to further acts of obstruction in the following\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _COTTENHAM, LORD CHANCELLOR._]\r\n\r\nHis most powerful opponent was about to disappear from the political\r\nscenes for the present, and in the future to be converted into an ally.\r\nWhen the great seal was entrusted to commissioners, Brougham had\r\naffected to regard the arrangement as a temporary makeshift to\r\npropitiate William IV., and hoped that he would inherit the reversion of\r\nthe chancellorship. With this expectation he not only patronised but\r\nwarmly supported the whig ministry in 1835. But his wayward and petulant\r\negotism had set all his old colleagues against him, and Melbourne had\r\nmade up his mind that \"it was impossible to act with him\". The\r\ninterruption of legal business caused by the constant withdrawal of\r\nthree judges from their proper duties, to act as commissioners, was\r\nseverely criticised by the press, and Sir Edward Sugden, who had been\r\nlord chancellor of Ireland under Peel, published an effective pamphlet\r\nentitled, \"What has become of the great seal?\" It was thought necessary\r\nto appoint a new chancellor, and in January, 1836, Sir Charles Pepys,\r\nthen master of the rolls, was raised to that dignity as Lord Cottenham.\r\nForeseeing the implacable indignation of Brougham, the ministry decided\r\nto confer a peerage on Henry Bickersteth, the new master of the rolls,\r\nwho became Lord Langdale, and who was supposed capable of confronting\r\nthe ex-chancellor in debate. No expectation could have been more\r\nunfounded or delusive, but the sense of disappointment and desertion so\r\npreyed on the health and nerves of Brougham that he forsook the house of\r\nlords for a whole session. Campbell does not shrink from saying that he\r\nwas \"atrociously ill-used\" on this occasion,[134] and assuredly he\r\nshould not have been left to learn from a newspaper that he was thrust\r\naside in favour of a man of vastly inferior gifts and services.\r\n\r\nOne other change was made in the cabinet during the recess. The Earl of\r\nMinto became first lord of the admiralty in succession to Auckland who\r\nhad been appointed governor-general of India. When parliament met on\r\nFebruary 4, 1836, the prospects of the whig government were more\r\nfavourable than on their first accession to office. The factious\r\nconduct of the house of lords in the last session had disgusted the\r\ncountry, while the statesmanlike moderation of Peel secured them\r\nfair-play in the house of commons, though it was gradually building up a\r\nstrong conservative party. Ireland again blocked the way for a while\r\nagainst useful legislation for Great Britain, and the first encounter of\r\nparties was on an amendment to the address condemning the anticipated\r\nreform of Irish corporations on the principles already adopted for\r\nEngland. This amendment, unwillingly moved by Peel, was defeated by a\r\nmajority of forty-one, and the Irish municipal bill was introduced on\r\nthe 16th. Like its English prototype, it was founded on the report of a\r\ncommission which had disclosed the grossest possible abuses in Irish\r\nmunicipalities, chiefly dominated by protestant oligarchies. A similar\r\nmeasure substituting elective councils for these corrupt bodies had\r\nactually passed its third reading in the commons before the end of the\r\nlast session, but the attempt to carry it further was then abandoned.\r\nThe debates on the bill of 1836 for the same purpose inevitably turned\r\non broad issues which continued to disturb Irish politics and to perplex\r\nEnglish statesmen for the rest of the century. On the one hand, no one\r\ncould justify \"government by ascendency\" in Ireland, or the shameful\r\nmalpractices incident to an exercise of power under no sense of\r\nresponsibility. On the other hand, no one acquainted with Irish history\r\nand Irish character could honestly regard the people as yet qualified\r\nfor local self-government. In the social and some of the moral virtues\r\nthey might be favourably compared with Englishmen and Scotchmen; in the\r\npolitical virtues, upon which civil institutions must rest, they were\r\nseveral generations behind their fellow-subjects in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _IRISH BILLS._]\r\n\r\nAll were agreed on the necessity of sweeping away or expurgating the\r\nexisting Irish corporations, but the whole strength of the conservative\r\nparty in both houses was enlisted against the experiment of elective\r\ntown councils, especially after the evidence lately taken before the\r\nso-called \"intimidation committee\" in the house of commons. Peel's\r\nscheme was to vest the executive powers and property of Irish\r\ncorporations, at least for the present, in officers appointed by the\r\ncrown. An amendment framed in this sense was defeated by a large\r\nmajority, and the bill passed the commons with little further\r\nopposition. When it reached the lords it was stoutly contested by\r\nLyndhurst, now fortified by Peel's concurrence, on the not unreasonable\r\nground that it would make the radicals and repealers predominant in\r\nevery Irish municipality, and create \"seats of agitation\" for\r\nrevolutionary purposes in the new town councils. Being converted into a\r\nbill \"for the abolition of municipal corporations\" in Ireland, it was\r\nreturned in that form to the house of commons. Russell vainly attempted\r\nto meet the lords half-way by another compromise, and the measure was\r\nabandoned only to be adopted, in a very modified shape, after the lapse\r\nof four years. A like course was pursued by the upper house when a new\r\nIrish tithe bill, with an appropriation clause, was sent up to them. Had\r\nthe whig government been well advised they would scarcely have\r\nchallenged a needless collision between the two houses by reviving this\r\nburning question so early. It would have been possible to settle the\r\nIrish tithe system on equitable lines, without prejudicing the future\r\napplication of superfluous Church revenues, and it was a somewhat\r\nperverse obstinacy which persisted in coupling the two objects year\r\nafter year. The ingenuity of Lyndhurst in wrecking sound reforms should\r\nhave been left without excuse; whereas, in this case, the peers could\r\nnot have accepted what they regarded as a confiscation bill without a\r\nsacrifice of conviction and self-respect.\r\n\r\nHappily the commutation of tithes in England presented no political\r\ndifficulties of the same nature. The payment of tithes in kind, though\r\nfounded on immemorial usage, had, indeed, produced constant discord\r\nbetween the parish clergyman and his flock, while landlords and farmers\r\njustly complained that it impeded the improvement of agriculture. In\r\nmany localities the pressure of these evils had led to voluntary\r\ncompositions between tithe-owners and tithe-payers, which, being\r\ntemporary, lacked the force of law. The permissive tithe bills of\r\nAlthorp and Peel were designed to render general a practice which\r\nalready prevailed in a thousand parishes, and that now introduced by\r\nRussell was little more than an extension of the same principle. Its\r\nmainspring was the appointment of commissioners with compulsory powers\r\nin the last resort, and the provision of a self-acting machinery for\r\nassessing the reduced annual rent charge payable in lieu of tithes, so\r\nas to vary with the average price of wheat, barley, and oats in the\r\nseven preceding years. This practical solution of the question was\r\nadopted cheerfully by the wearied legislature, and the commissioners\r\nsucceeded before long in effecting universal commutation. Amendments in\r\ndetail have of course been found necessary, but the system established\r\nby 6 and 7 William IV., cap. 61, has stood the test of long experience,\r\nand although tithe-owners have been impoverished by the fall of prices,\r\nthe payment of tithes in England has ceased to be a grievance, except\r\nwith those who absolutely condemn the endowment of a Church.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _REGISTRATION ACTS._]\r\n\r\nAn equally valuable and permanent legacy of this session is contained in\r\ntwo cognate acts regulating marriages and registration in England. By\r\nthe first of these acts two new modes of celebrating marriage were\r\nprovided, without interfering with the old privileges of the established\r\nChurch in regard to marriage by licence or banns. While the essential\r\nconditions of notice and publicity were carefully secured, the\r\nsuperintendent registrar of each district was empowered either to\r\nauthorise the celebration of marriage in a duly registered place of\r\nworship, but in presence of a district registrar, or to solemnise the\r\nceremony himself, without any religious service, in his own office.\r\nClergymen of the Church of England were constituted registrars for\r\nmarriages celebrated by themselves, and were bound to furnish the\r\nsuperintendent registrars with certified entries of such marriages. The\r\nact was complicated by a variety of safeguards, enforced by heavy\r\npenalties, against fraud and evasion, but its leading features were\r\nsimple and have proved effectual for their purpose. It marked an advance\r\non the earlier marriage bill of Russell, since it not only allowed\r\ndissenters to marry in their own chapels, but to marry without having\r\ntheir banns published in the parish church. It went beyond the marriage\r\nbill of Peel, since it not only recognised marriage as a civil contract,\r\nbut utilised the new poor law organisation, and posted in each district\r\na civil official before whom that contract could legally be solemnised.\r\n\r\nThe rules laid down by the first act for the registration of marriages\r\nwere an integral part of a general registration system established by\r\nthe second act, and embracing births and deaths as well as marriages.\r\nThis system, rendered possible by the division of the country into\r\nunions, brought under effective control the old parochial registers\r\nwhich had been loosely kept for three centuries. The statistical value\r\nof the returns thus checked and digested in a central department is now\r\nfully recognised, but can only be appreciated by students of social\r\nhistory, which, indeed, is now largely founded on reports of the\r\nregistrar-general. The special provisions for the registration of deaths\r\nare also of the utmost service in the prevention of disease and crime.\r\nNot until after this act of 1836 was it realised by the mass of the\r\npeople, not only that a sudden death would properly be followed by a\r\ncoroner's inquest, but that every death, with its circumstances, must be\r\ntreated as a matter of public concern and duly notified. Still more\r\nimportant in its results has been the requirement of a medical statement\r\non the cause of death--a requirement which has brought about the\r\ndiscovery of numerous murders and greatly checked the commission of\r\nothers. If the marriage act relieved a large class of the community from\r\nvexatious disabilities, the whole community assuredly owes the second\r\nreformed parliament a debt of gratitude for the registration act which,\r\nlike so many of the best acts in the statute book, provoked but little\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nA far keener party interest was excited by the crusade against the\r\nOrange lodges in Great Britain and Ireland which Hume and Finn, an Irish\r\nmember, carried on with great energy in the sessions of 1835 and 1836.\r\nThese societies then had an importance which they no longer possess, and\r\nwere the more open to radical attacks because the Duke of Cumberland was\r\ngrand master of the order. It was said, with some justice, that while\r\nthe catholic association was nominally put down, the Orange lodges in\r\nIreland were openly spreading, with the connivance at least of the Irish\r\nauthorities. Their officials included noblemen of high position;\r\nGoulburn, when chief secretary, was an Orangeman, and special efforts\r\nhad been made to enrol members in the army. Their principles were\r\nstrictly loyal, but their demonstrations were naturally resented by the\r\nRoman catholics, and were not far removed from preparations for civil\r\nwar. They hailed the accession of Peel's short ministry with tumultuous\r\nenthusiasm, but when the legality of their organisation and proceedings\r\nwas challenged in the house of commons, during the session of 1835,\r\ntheir advocates felt compelled to support a committee of inquiry. The\r\nevidence taken before this committee, and the debate raised by Hume on\r\nthe formation of Orange lodges in the army, damaged their cause in the\r\neyes of the public, and seriously compromised the Duke of Cumberland. It\r\nwas shown that his brother, the Duke of York, had resigned the grand\r\nmastership, and on being convinced of their illegality had forbidden\r\nOrange lodges in the army, whereas the Duke of Cumberland had accepted\r\nthe grand mastership and directly promoted military lodges.\r\n\r\nAn address condemning them was carried; the king undertook to discourage\r\nthem, and the commander-in-chief issued a stringent order for their\r\nsuppression. The struggle, however, was continued by the pertinacity of\r\nthe radicals in demanding a more extended inquiry, and the obstinacy of\r\nthe Orangemen in defying both the house of commons and the horse guards.\r\nEarly in the session of 1836 Finn and Hume renewed their assaults, and\r\nthe latter moved for an address, to be framed in the most sweeping\r\nterms, and calling upon the crown to dismiss all persons in public\r\nemployment, from the highest to the lowest, who should belong to Orange\r\nsocieties. Russell, who had been gradually rising in public estimation,\r\nshowed the qualities of a true statesman on this occasion by a firm yet\r\nconciliatory speech which commanded assent on both sides. He exposed the\r\nextravagant and impracticable nature of Hume's demand, but condemned the\r\nOrange societies, and proposed an address urging the crown to use its\r\ninfluence for \"the effectual discouragement of Orange lodges, and\r\ngenerally all political societies, excluding persons of different faith,\r\nusing signs and symbols, and acting by associated branches\". This\r\nresolution was adopted without opposition, the king heartily endorsed\r\nit, even the Duke of Cumberland acquiesced in it, and the Orange\r\nsocieties quietly dissolved themselves, for a while, throughout the\r\nUnited Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIf the session of 1836 had produced no other legislative fruits it could\r\nnot be regarded as wasted. But several minor reforms of great social\r\nbenefit also date from this year, and prove that, however checked by\r\npolitical blunders, the energy kindled by the reform act had not yet\r\nexhausted itself. After repeated efforts of legal philanthropists, a\r\nbill was now passed for the first time allowing prisoners on trial for\r\nfelony to be defended by counsel. It was brought in by William Ewart, a\r\nprivate member, who sat for Liverpool, but was supported by the highest\r\nlegal authorities in the house of lords, including Lyndhurst himself,\r\nwho openly recanted his former opinions, and declared the old law to be\r\na barbarous survival, inconsistent with the practice of other civilised\r\nnations. In the same house an interesting debate took place on the\r\nmanagement of jails, which had been placed under a system of inspection\r\nby an act of the previous year. The reports of the inspectors disclosed\r\ngross abuses, not only in the smaller county jails but in Newgate\r\nitself. Lansdowne, in pledging the government to deal with the larger\r\nquestion, intimated that Russell, as home secretary, was considering the\r\nmeans of separating juvenile offenders from hardened criminals by\r\nestablishing places of detention in the nature of what have since been\r\nknown as reformatories.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _DUTY ON NEWSPAPERS LOWERED._]\r\n\r\nA still more notable contribution to social improvement was made by\r\nSpring Rice, the chancellor of the exchequer, in consolidating the paper\r\nduties on a reduced scale, and lowering the stamp duty on newspapers\r\nfrom fourpence to one penny. These were the only controversial elements\r\nin a budget otherwise modest and acceptable. The battle over paper\r\nduties and \"taxes upon knowledge\" raised in the debates of 1836 was\r\ndestined to rage many years longer, but the relief granted by Spring\r\nRice gave a powerful impulse to journalism and periodical literature. It\r\nwas opposed by all the familiar arguments against a cheap press, but\r\nthat which most endangered its success was a rival proposal to apply any\r\nsurplus revenue to cheapening soap. Soap, it was plausibly contended,\r\nwas a necessary, reading newspapers or periodicals was only a luxury,\r\nand a luxury, too, far move capable of being abused than expenditure on\r\nsoap. When the penny stamp on newspapers was at last preferred to\r\nreduced soap duties it was said that, \"so far as financial arrangements\r\nwere concerned, everything went to supply the essential elements of low\r\npolitical clubs, _viz._, cheap gin, cheap newspapers, filthy hands, and\r\nunwashed faces\".[135]\r\n\r\nThe legislative record of 1836 was creditable to the government, nor was\r\nthe action of the upper house in amending certain of their bills so\r\npurely mischievous as it has been described. For instance, a strange\r\nclause had found its way into the newspaper stamp bill, requiring all\r\nthe proprietors of newspapers, however numerous, to be registered at the\r\nstamp office. This clause was struck out in the house of lords, at the\r\ninstance of Lyndhurst, though Melbourne declared it to be a vital part\r\nof the measure, which, however, passed without it, and was the better\r\nfor the loss of it. But the same cannot be said of Lyndhurst's conduct\r\nat the \"open conference\" between the two houses on a supplementary bill\r\nfor remedying defects in the operation of the municipal corporations\r\nact. There no question of principle was involved, and the only motive\r\nfor resisting every attempt to improve the new machinery already\r\nestablished by law was one unworthy of a statesman. At the close of the\r\nsession, Lyndhurst delivered a masterly vindication of his own\r\nproceedings, but he was answered by Melbourne in a speech of great\r\nability, and the position now occupied by the whigs appeared stronger\r\nthan when they came into office in 1835.\r\n\r\nIn this year complaints of agricultural distress once more became\r\nurgent, and a committee was appointed by the house of commons, as in\r\n1833, to inquire into its cause. Strange to say, the immediate occasion\r\nfor the second inquiry was the occurrence of three magnificent harvests\r\nin succession, which brought down the average price of wheat from 58s.\r\n8d. in 1832 to 53s. in 1833, 46s. 2d. in 1834, and 39s. 4d. in 1835,\r\nwhence it rose to 48s. 6d. after the harvest of 1836. The average\r\ngazette price of 1835 was the lowest touched in the nineteenth century\r\nuntil 1884, and was simply due to excess of production. It was stated\r\nbefore the committee of 1836, by the comptroller of corn returns, that\r\nin the period between 1814 and 1834 the quantity of home-grown wheat\r\nonly fell short of the consumption, on the average, by about 1,000,000\r\nquarters a year, of which at least half was contributed by Ireland. The\r\ncommittee published its evidence without making a report, but this fact\r\nis highly significant as marking the later revolution in British\r\nagriculture. If the area then devoted to wheat crops almost sufficed to\r\nfeed an estimated population of 14,500,000, when the yield per acre was\r\nrelatively small, we may safely infer, in the absence of trustworthy\r\nstatistics, that it must have been very much greater than at present.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _AGITATION IN IRELAND._]\r\n\r\nAt the opening of 1837 there was a marked stagnation in home politics,\r\nmainly due to an equipoise of parties and serious divisions in the ranks\r\nof the ministerialists as well as of the opposition. Not only was there\r\na very strong conservative majority in the house of lords, with a\r\nsufficient though dwindling liberal majority in the house of commons,\r\nbut neither majority was amenable to party discipline. The aggressive\r\npolicy and vexatious tactics of Lyndhurst were distasteful to his\r\nnominal leader, the Duke of Wellington, and still more so to Peel, the\r\nonly possible conservative premier, who eschewed the very name of tory.\r\nThere was greater unity of counsels between Melbourne and Russell, but\r\nRussell, who had learned moderation, was dependent on the support of his\r\nextreme left, composed of violent radicals and Irish repealers. The\r\nking, though he did not carry his repugnance to his ministers so far as\r\nhe once threatened, yet almost excluded them from social invitations,\r\nand made no secret of his preference for the opposite party. During the\r\nwinter of 1836-37 O'Connell and his satellites were busy in organising\r\nmonster meetings to demand the abolition of tithes and municipal reform.\r\nA national association was formed on this basis, and a certain number of\r\nprotestants were induced to join it. The government dared not show\r\nvigour in checking it lest they should estrange their Irish allies, and\r\nMulgrave, the lord-lieutenant, was openly accused of favouring sedition\r\nand discouraging loyalty by his exercise of patronage and the royal\r\nprerogative of pardon. At last, a very large and influential meeting was\r\nheld in Dublin, at which the discontent of loyalists and patriots was\r\nexpressed with truly Irish vehemence. Still, Ireland was less disturbed\r\nthan in several previous years. About the same time, Peel, having been\r\nelected lord rector of Glasgow University, was entertained there at\r\ndinner by a company including many old reformers, and made one of his\r\ngreatest speeches. Its spirit was that of his Tamworth manifesto, but he\r\nwas far more outspoken in his declaration of unswerving adhesion to the\r\nprotestant cause and to the independence of the upper house.\r\n\r\nSuch were the political conditions when parliament met on January 31.\r\nThe king's speech, delivered by commission, though singularly\r\ncolourless, indicated the importance of legislating on Irish tithes,\r\nIrish corporations, and Irish poor relief. The debate on the address was\r\nenlivened by a furious attack of Roebuck on the whigs, but was\r\notherwise devoid of importance. On February 7, however, Russell\r\nintroduced a new Irish corporations bill, invoking the authority of Fox\r\nfor the doctrine that \"Irish government should be regulated by Irish\r\nnotions and Irish prejudices,\" and avowing a faith in the efficacy of\r\nunlimited concession which has not been justified by later experience.\r\nHe further intimated the resolution of the government to stand or fall\r\nby this measure. No serious resistance was offered by the opposition to\r\nits first or second reading, but Peel took occasion to protest against a\r\ntransparent inconsistency which seems to beset the advocacy of Irish\r\nclaims. It is generally assumed, and with too much justice, that Ireland\r\nis so backward and helpless a country as to require exceptional\r\ntreatment; in short, that it must be governed by Irish ideas, with\r\nlittle regard to English principles of sound policy or economy. Such\r\nwas, in effect, Fox's contention, adopted by Russell; and yet, like\r\nfuture supporters of \"Ireland for the Irish,\" he argued in the same\r\nbreath that every liberal institution suitable to Englishmen, with their\r\nlong training in self-government and instinctive reverence for law, must\r\nneeds be extended to Irishmen, with their long training in anarchy and\r\ninstinctive propensity to lawlessness. He prevailed, however, in the\r\nhouse of commons, where a hostile amendment was decisively rejected, and\r\nthe bill, having passed rapidly through committee, was read a third time\r\nby a large though reduced majority.\r\n\r\nHad it been possible to isolate the Irish municipal bill, and to compel\r\nthe house of lords to deal with it singly, the peers might possibly have\r\nshrunk from another collision with the commons. But it had been coupled\r\nin the king's speech with two other projects of Irish legislation, a new\r\ntithe bill, and an Irish poor law. Both of these were, in fact,\r\nintroduced, the former by Russell in February, the latter by Morpeth\r\nearly in May. The course to be taken by the conservative party was the\r\nsubject of anxious consultation between Peel and Wellington, and that\r\nultimately adopted had the full sanction of both. They regarded the\r\nseparate presentation of the municipal bill as a \"manoeuvre,\" and,\r\nwhile they overruled the wish of Lyndhurst to defeat it by an adverse\r\nvote on the second reading, they resolved to meet it by a\r\ncounter-manoeuvre. Accordingly Wellington induced the house of lords\r\nto postpone the committee on the municipal bill until they should have\r\nthe other two bills before them, and Peel not only approved of his\r\naction but stated reasons for regarding them as essentially connected\r\nwith each other. June 9 was originally fixed as the date for going into\r\ncommittee, but this stage was afterwards deferred until July 3, before\r\nwhich unforeseen events arrested all further progress.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _CHURCH RATES._]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the prestige of the government had been weakened by the\r\nfailure of their scheme for abolishing Church rates. The dissenters, no\r\nlonger content with religious liberty, were beginning to demand\r\nreligious equality. In the forefront of their grievances was that of\r\npaying rates for the repair of parish churches which they did not\r\nattend, except as members of the annual \"vestry,\" where they could\r\nobject to a rate but might be out-voted by a majority of their\r\nfellow-parishioners. Althorp had proposed a scheme for the removal of\r\nthis grievance in 1834, involving a parliamentary grant of £250,000.\r\nSetting aside this alternative, as well as that of a special\r\ncontribution, voluntary or otherwise, from members of the Church, Spring\r\nRice now proposed a solution of his own. It consisted in vesting the\r\nproperty of bishops and chapters in a commission which, by improved\r\nmanagement, might raise the necessary sum for church repairs, without\r\nimpairing the incomes of these ecclesiastical dignitaries. Before the\r\ngovernment plan was discussed in the house of commons, Howley,\r\narchbishop of Canterbury, entered a strong protest against it in the\r\nhouse of lords on the ground that it would reduce the bishops and\r\nchapters from the position of landowners to that of \"mere annuitants\".\r\nMelbourne complained of his protest somewhat angrily as premature, and\r\nprovoked a vehement reply from Blomfield, bishop of London, who, though\r\na member of the ecclesiastical commission, denounced any such diversion\r\nof revenues as \"a sacrilegious act of spoliation\". In the elaborate\r\ndebates on the resolutions moved by Spring Rice in the house of commons\r\nPeel took his stand partly on financial objections and partly on the\r\ninjustice of taking away from the Church a fund belonging to it by\r\nimmemorial usage, and in the main willingly contributed. Amendment after\r\namendment was proposed by members of the opposition, and, though each\r\nwas defeated, the government resolutions were ultimately carried by so\r\nnarrow a majority in May that no further action was taken.\r\n\r\nThe conservative reaction, now in visible progress, was typified by the\r\nopen secession of Burdett from the ranks of the reformers. This sincere\r\nbut indiscreet radical, who had once enjoyed a popularity similar to\r\nthat of Wilkes as a political martyr, became estranged from his party\r\nwhen it accepted O'Connell as an auxiliary, if not as an ally. Having\r\nfailed in procuring the exclusion of the great Irish demagogue from\r\nBrooks's club, in 1835, he withdrew his own name. Soon afterwards he\r\nbecame irregular in his parliamentary attendance, and more than lukewarm\r\nin his allegiance. Early in 1837 he was, like Stanley and Graham, so\r\nmuch suspected of gravitating towards conservatism, that some of his\r\nWestminster constituents publicly called upon him to resign. He took up\r\nthe challenge, and was re-elected against a radical opponent by a\r\nsubstantial majority. It was his last re-election for a borough which he\r\nhad represented for thirty years. In the Church-rate debate he rose from\r\nthe opposition side of the house, and lamenting his separation from his\r\nold associates, did not spare them either reproaches or hostile\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nAnother desertion from the whig camp took place during this session, but\r\nin an opposite direction. Roebuck, originally one of the philosophical\r\nradicals, had become more and more violent in his attacks on his own\r\nleaders, whom he accused of having deceived the people. According to\r\nhim, they were \"aristocratic in principle, democratic in pretence,\" and\r\nall the resources of his incisive rhetoric were exhausted in exposing\r\ntheir incapacity, in a motion for a committee to consider the state of\r\nthe nation. This motion, so advocated, met with no support, and gave\r\nRussell the opportunity of once more vindicating the wisdom of\r\nmoderation in statesmanship. But there were many besides Roebuck who\r\nwere eager to complete the work of the reform act by further organic\r\nchanges, and the notice book of the house of commons in 1837 embodied\r\nseveral proposals of this kind. One was Grote's annual motion for the\r\nballot, on which an interesting debate took place. Among the others were\r\ntwo motions of Sir William Molesworth for a reform of the upper house\r\nand for the abolition of a property qualification for the lower house, a\r\nmotion of Tennyson, who had taken the additional name of D'Eyncourt, for\r\nthe repeal of the septennial act, and another of Hume for household\r\nsuffrage, overshadowing that of Duncombe for repealing the rate-paying\r\nclauses of the reform act itself. Nearly all of these contained the\r\ngerms of future legislation, but they formed no part of the whig\r\nprogramme, nor could any whig government have carried them against so\r\npowerful an opposition, with an invincible reserve in the house of\r\nlords, during the last session of William IV. Only seventeen public acts\r\nwere actually passed in this session.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE DEATH OF WILLIAM IV._]\r\n\r\nThere were, indeed, other reasons for declining to provoke a grave\r\ncontest at this juncture. The king's health was known to be failing, his\r\ndeath under the law then in force would involve a general election, and\r\nno one could desire his successor, a girl of eighteen, to begin her\r\nreign in the midst of a political crisis. In May his illness assumed an\r\nalarming aspect, early in June the medical reports satisfied the country\r\nthat his case was hopeless, on June 19 he received the last sacrament,\r\nand on the 20th he died at Windsor Castle. Something more than justice\r\nwas done to his character by the leaders of both parties in parliament,\r\nbut something less than justice has been done to it by later historians.\r\nHe was inferior in strength of will to his father, in ability to his\r\neldest brother, and in the higher virtues of a constitutional sovereign\r\nto his niece, who succeeded him. But he was not only a kindly and\r\nwell-meaning man, a good husband to Queen Adelaide and a good father to\r\nhis natural children, faithful to his old friends, and bountiful in his\r\ncharities; he was also a loyal servant of the state, with a genuine\r\nsense of public duty, a natural love of justice, an independent\r\njudgment, and a noble indifference to personal or selfish objects. His\r\nlot was cast in almost revolutionary times, and he was called upon to\r\nreign at an age when few men are capable of shaking off old prejudices,\r\nyet he deserved well of his people in supporting the ministry of Grey\r\nthrough all the stages of the reform movement, in spite of his own\r\ndeclared sympathies, but in deference to his own conviction of paramount\r\nobligation under the laws of the land. He was quite as liberal in\r\nopinions as Peel, whose hearty interest in the poorer classes he fully\r\nshared, and far more liberal than the tory majority in the house of\r\nlords. Great he certainly was not, and he never affected the royal\r\ndignity which partially concealed the littleness of his predecessor. But\r\nin honesty and simplicity he was no unworthy son of George III., and the\r\ngreater pliability of his nature contributed, at least, to make the\r\nseven years of his reign more fruitful in reforms than all the sixty\r\nyears during which the old king occupied the throne of England.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[130] The king to Peel (Feb. 22, 1835), Parker, _Sir Robert Peel_, ii.,\r\n287-89.\r\n\r\n[131] See Melbourne's letters to Brougham, _Melbourne Papers_, pp.\r\n257-64.\r\n\r\n[132] The abuses in the Scottish municipalities had, however, been\r\nalready removed by an act conferring the municipal franchise on £10\r\nhouseholders. Not the least important result of this act was the\r\nincreased strength which it gave to the \"evangelical\" party in the\r\ngeneral assembly of the Church of Scotland, which was partly elected by\r\nthe municipalities.\r\n\r\n[133] Campbell, _Lives of the Chancellors_, viii., 470.\r\n\r\n[134] Campbell, _Lives of the Chancellors_, viii., 476.\r\n\r\n[135] _Annual Register_, lxxviii.

The former of these was\r\noccasioned by the publication on July 25 of three ordinances,\r\nrestricting the liberty of the press, dissolving the chambers, and\r\namending the law of elections. The Parisian populace rose against this\r\ninfringement of the constitution. In the course of a three days'\r\nstreet-fight (the 27th to the 29th) the troops were driven out of Paris.\r\nOn the 30th a few members of the chambers, who had continued in session,\r\ninvited Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans, to assume the office of\r\nlieutenant-general of the kingdom, and he was proclaimed on the\r\nfollowing day. On August 7 the chamber of deputies offered him the\r\ncrown, which he accepted, and on the 9th he was proclaimed \"King of the\r\nFrench\". On the 2nd Charles X. and the dauphin had renounced their\r\nrights in favour of the young Duke of Bordeaux, and on the 16th they\r\nsailed from Cherbourg to England. The change of dynasty was accompanied\r\nby a transference to the _bourgeoisie_ of such political influence as\r\nhad hitherto belonged to the clergy and _noblesse_. It remained to be\r\nseen whether it would also be accompanied by a change of foreign policy.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _RECOGNITION OF LOUIS PHILIPPE._]\r\n\r\nThe new French revolution occasioned no slight perturbation in the\r\nEuropean courts. To say nothing of the fear of the precedent being\r\nfollowed in other lands, there was no longer any guarantee that France\r\nwould respect the arrangements effected by the treaties of Vienna and\r\nParis. Austria, Prussia, and Russia agreed not to recognise Louis\r\nPhilippe, and entered into a convention for mutual aid in the event of\r\nFrench aggression. Aberdeen, the British foreign secretary, declared\r\nthat the time had come for applying the treaty of Chaumont, which, as\r\nextended at Paris, pledged Great Britain and the three eastern powers to\r\nact together in case fresh revolution and usurpation in France should\r\nendanger the repose of other states. Wellington, however, saw that the\r\ncause of the elder Bourbon line was hopeless, and held now, as in 1815,\r\nthat if France was not to menace the peace of Europe, her political\r\nposition must be one with which she could be contented. He considered\r\nthat the arguments which justified the admission of France to the\r\ncouncils of the powers at Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818 applied with no less\r\ncogency to the government of Louis Philippe than to that of Louis XVIII.\r\nHe therefore determined to acknowledge the new French government at an\r\nearly date after the notification of its assumption of power. Nor were\r\nthe other powers slow in taking the same course. It is true that\r\nMetternich suggested a closer bond between Austria, Prussia, and Russia,\r\npartly to restore amicable relations between Austria and Russia, partly\r\nto oppose any possible designs of France on Italy. Prussia, fearing war,\r\nresisted the proposal, and preferred to draw France into a guarantee of\r\nthe _status quo_ by recognising Louis Philippe. Russia was last of the\r\ngreat powers to acknowledge the new _régime_ in France, and she only did\r\nso on condition that the powers should hold the French king responsible\r\nfor the execution of the international engagements of the fallen\r\ndynasty. Louis Philippe was certainly not the man wilfully to embroil\r\nFrance in a war with her neighbours, and, had he been independent of\r\nFrench public opinion, there would have been no reason to fear French\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nThe state which had most to fear from an aggressive France was the new\r\nkingdom of the Netherlands. Trusting for protection to the great powers\r\nrather than to its own forces, the Netherlands government had adopted a\r\nsystem which left it almost entirely without troops except during the\r\nmilitary exercises of September and October. Wellington, who knew the\r\npacific character of the new French government, advised the garrisoning\r\nof certain isolated points on the frontier, but thought no further\r\npreparation necessary. A few weeks were however to prove that the new\r\nFrench revolution had aroused a more implacable enemy, against whom the\r\nhouse of Orange would have needed all the troops it could summon to its\r\naid. The union of Holland and Belgium had been resolved on by the\r\npowers at Paris in 1814, mainly for military reasons. Austria had been\r\nunwilling to resume the heavy burden of guarding the Belgian Netherlands\r\nand southern Germany against French aggression, and the powers had\r\nconsequently resolved on strengthening those smaller states on whom the\r\nduty of resistance would fall. In these days, accustomed as we are to\r\nthe distinction between the Teutonic and Latin races, it might seem\r\nreasonable that two countries in which the prevailing languages are low\r\nGerman should be subject to the same government. But it was not yet\r\ncustomary to turn the principles of comparative philology into arguments\r\nfor the rearrangement of political boundaries. The French language and\r\nculture had moreover made considerable progress among the upper and\r\nmiddle classes of Belgium, while religious differences alienated the\r\nclergy from the house of Orange. In the states-general of the\r\nNetherlands the Dutch had half the votes, and, as the Orange party was\r\nstrong in Antwerp and Ghent, commanded a majority. The fiscal system\r\nadopted by the government favoured the Dutch rather than the Belgian\r\npopulation. Dutchmen were generally preferred for state offices, and an\r\nattempt to control the education of the clergy was deeply resented as an\r\nattack on the Roman catholic religion. Belgium in consequence presented\r\nthe curious spectacle of the liberal and clerical parties working on the\r\nsame side, united against the Dutch government.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _BELGIAN REVOLUTION._]\r\n\r\nThe example afforded by France turned a discontent which might have led\r\nto local riots into a national conflagration. On August 25 there was a\r\nrising of the populace at Brussels, which the troops proved unable to\r\nquell. On the 27th it was suppressed by a body of burgher guards, a\r\nvolunteer force drawn from the _bourgeoisie_ of the town. The\r\n_bourgeoisie_ finding themselves in possession of the Belgian capital,\r\nat first presented a series of minor demands to the king, but on\r\nSeptember 3 they went the length of demanding a separate administration\r\nfor Belgium. The king undertook to lay this proposal before the states,\r\nwhich assembled on the 13th. But before the states could come to any\r\nconclusion the question had assumed a new aspect. All the leading towns\r\nof Belgium had followed the example of Brussels by forming burgher\r\nguards and had thus joined in the revolution; and on the 20th a fresh\r\nrising of the populace of Brussels had overthrown the burgher guard and\r\ninstituted a provisional government. This was followed by an attempt on\r\nthe part of Prince Frederick of Orange, a younger son of the King of the\r\nNetherlands, to occupy Brussels with a military force. After five days'\r\nfighting he was compelled to retire, and when on the 30th the\r\nstates-general gave their consent to the proposal for a separate\r\nadministration, their decision fell upon deaf ears. All the Belgian\r\nprovinces were in revolt.\r\n\r\nIt was now clear to everybody that the national party in Belgium would\r\nnot consent even to a personal union with Holland. As the union of the\r\ntwo countries formed a part of the treaty of Vienna, every European\r\npower had a legal right to employ force to prevent its disruption, and\r\nRussia and Prussia both desired active intervention. In France, on the\r\nother hand, there was a loud popular demand for the reannexation of\r\nBelgium to France, of which it had formed a part from 1794 to 1814.\r\nLouis Philippe saw that he could not resist this demand if the Belgian\r\ninsurgents were coerced on the side of Prussia, and therefore announced\r\nthat Prussian aggression would be met by a French expedition to Belgium\r\nto keep the balance even, until the question should be settled by a\r\ncongress of the powers. On September 25 Talleyrand had arrived in\r\nEngland. He quickly obtained the adhesion of Wellington to the principle\r\nof non-intervention. The duke had been among the first to grasp the fact\r\nthat reconciliation of Dutch and Belgians was impossible, and that the\r\nintervention of the powers would necessitate a European war, to avoid\r\nwhich the union of the two countries had originally been designed. He\r\nagreed therefore to a separation of the countries on condition that\r\nFrance should bind herself to observe the arrangements of the congress\r\nof Vienna in 1815 and should take no separate action in Belgium.\r\n\r\nOn Talleyrand's suggestion it was decided to refer the question to the\r\nconference already sitting in London for the purpose of settling the\r\nGreek question, which would of course have to be reinforced by\r\nrepresentatives of Austria and Prussia for the present purpose. Molé,\r\nthe French foreign minister, would have preferred Paris as the seat of\r\nthe congress, but the King of the Netherlands absolutely refused to\r\nentrust his cause to a conference meeting in a city where opinion ran so\r\nstrongly against him. On October 5 he made a formal appeal to the\r\npowers for the aid guaranteed him by treaty, but the demand came too\r\nlate to induce Wellington to swerve from the policy of non-intervention,\r\nand on November 4 the conference of London began its labours by\r\nproposing an armistice in Belgium, which was accepted by both parties.\r\nThis left Maastricht and the citadel of Antwerp in the hands of Dutch\r\ngarrisons, and Luxemburg in the hands of a garrison supplied by the\r\nGerman confederation. Every other place in Belgium was in the hands of\r\nthe insurgents. But the further solution of the question was reserved\r\nfor other hands. On the 3rd Louis Philippe was compelled to accept a\r\nrevolutionary ministry, and on the 22nd Wellington and Aberdeen had to\r\nmake way for a whig ministry with Grey as premier, and Palmerston as\r\nforeign secretary.\r\n\r\nThe new foreign secretary had served a long political apprenticeship as\r\nsecretary at war in the successive administrations of Perceval,\r\nLiverpool, Canning, Goderich, and Wellington, and under the three\r\nlast-mentioned premiers he had enjoyed a seat in the cabinet. It will be\r\nremembered that he had been a warm champion of Greece, and had resigned\r\noffice along with Huskisson, Dudley, and Grant. He now returned in\r\ncompany with Grant as a member of a whig cabinet. Although this change\r\nof party involved the adoption of a domestic policy far removed from\r\nCanning's, Palmerston's foreign policy remained rather Canningite than\r\nwhig. The interest and the honour of England ranked with Palmerston as\r\nwith Canning before all questions which concerned the maintenance of\r\nEuropean peace. But instead of Canning's versatile diplomacy he\r\ndisplayed too often a reckless disregard of the susceptibilities of\r\nforeign governments, and, if, like Canning, he lent the moral support of\r\nGreat Britain to the liberal party in every continental country, it was\r\nnot, as it had professedly been with Canning, because their success\r\nwould promote the interests of Great Britain, but because he had a\r\ngenuine sympathy with their cause. It is impossible to deny that in his\r\nearlier years at least Palmerston's policy met with a success such as\r\nCastlereagh and Wellington had not attempted to gain; real or imaginary\r\ndangers at home left the foreign governments too weak to oppose the will\r\nof the one strong man of the moment. Yet it is doubtful whether any\r\nresultant benefits were not more than counterbalanced by the distrust\r\nand ill-will with which the greater nations of Europe have learned to\r\nregard the British government and people.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _PROPOSED DIVISION OF THE NETHERLANDS._]\r\n\r\nDuring the first few weeks of the new administration, the Belgian\r\nquestion advanced far towards a settlement. On November 10 a Belgian\r\nnational congress assembled at Brussels; on the 18th it voted the\r\nindependence of Belgium; on the 22nd it resolved that the new state\r\nshould be a constitutional monarchy, and on the 24th it proclaimed the\r\ntotal exclusion of the house of Nassau. Finally the outbreak of a Polish\r\ninsurrection at Warsaw made it clear that Prussia and Russia would be\r\ntoo busily occupied in the east to be able to interfere effectively in\r\nthe Belgian question. On December 20 a protocol was signed at London by\r\nthe representatives of the five powers, providing for the separation of\r\nBelgium from Holland. When however the protocol was sent to the tsar for\r\nratification, he would only ratify it subject to the condition that its\r\nexecution should depend on the consent of the King of the Netherlands.\r\nMeanwhile the London conference was engaged in settling the boundary of\r\nthe new kingdom. For the most part it went on the principle of leaving\r\nto Holland the districts that had belonged to the United Provinces\r\nbefore the wars of the French revolution. The remainder of the kingdom\r\nof the Netherlands, consisting chiefly of the former Austrian\r\nNetherlands, but including also territories which had belonged to\r\nFrance, Prussia, the Palatinate, the bishopric of Liège, and some minor\r\necclesiastical states, was assigned to Belgium. An exception was,\r\nhowever, made in the case of the grand duchy of Luxemburg. Luxemburg was\r\nreputed to be, next to Gibraltar, the strongest fortress in Europe. It\r\nwas regarded as the key to the lower Rhine; it formed a part of the\r\nGerman confederation, and was garrisoned by German troops. Although\r\nHolland had no historical claim to its possession, the treaty of Vienna\r\ngranted it to the Dutch branch of the house of Nassau, as compensation\r\nfor its former possessions, merged in the duchy of Nassau; and it was\r\nnow felt that a place so important to the safety of Germany could not\r\nsafely be handed over to a state which seemed likely to fall under\r\nFrench influence. The powers therefore determined that this duchy should\r\ncontinue to belong to the king of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThere was also some difficulty over the apportionment of the debt.\r\nBelgium was the more populous and the richer of the two countries, but\r\nthe greater part of the debt had been contracted by Holland before the\r\nunion. Belgium was, however, already responsible for its share of the\r\nwhole debt, and the powers can hardly be accused of injustice when they\r\ndetermined to divide the debt in the proportion in which the\r\ndebt-charges had been borne in the three previous years, assigning\r\nsixteen thirty-firsts to Belgium, and fifteen thirty-firsts to Holland.\r\nBelgium was moreover to possess the right of trading with the Dutch\r\ncolonies and to contribute towards their defence. These provisions were\r\nembodied in two protocols which were issued at London on January 20 and\r\n27, 1831. As compared with the _status quo_ the Dutch were slightly the\r\ngainers. The protocol permitted them to keep Maastricht and Luxemburg,\r\nbut required them to abandon the citadel of Antwerp; while the Belgians\r\nwere required to surrender those less important places which they had\r\noccupied in Dutch Limburg and in the grand duchy of Luxemburg.\r\nTalleyrand considered the present a favourable opportunity for claiming\r\nfor France the cession of Mariembourg and Philippeville which she had\r\nbeen compelled to surrender to the kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815.\r\nPalmerston, however, absolutely refused to hear of any extension of\r\nFrench territory, for fear of imperilling the security of Europe. The\r\ntwo protocols were accepted by Holland on February 13 but rejected by\r\nBelgium. Though Talleyrand had signed the protocol of January 20, it was\r\nrepudiated by Sébastiani, the French foreign minister, on the ground\r\nthat the object of the conference was to effect a mediation, not to\r\ndictate a settlement.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _BELGIUM CHOOSES A KING._]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the national congress at Brussels had attempted to elect a\r\nking. At first the most favoured candidate was Auguste Beauharnais, Duke\r\nof Leuchtenberg, the grandson of Napoleon's first consort. Louis\r\nPhilippe naturally objected to the establishment on his frontier of a\r\nprince so closely connected with the house of Bonaparte. The pliant\r\nBelgians accordingly transferred their preference to the Duke of\r\nNemours, the second son of Louis Philippe. It was in vain that\r\nSébastiani declared that France could not allow such a selection, as it\r\nwould be interpreted by the powers as evidence of a French design to\r\nreincorporate Belgium in France. On February 3, 1831, the Duke of\r\nNemours was actually elected king by the Belgian national congress. But\r\nthe conference of London had, two days earlier, adopted a resolution,\r\nexcluding from the Belgian throne all members of the reigning dynasties\r\nof the five powers. Still there was a strong party in France, including\r\nLaffitte, the revolutionary premier, who advocated the claims of\r\nNemours. Louis Philippe, however, stood firm on the side of European\r\npeace, and on the 17th definitively declined the crown offered to his\r\nson. The French now recommended the Prince of Naples, but the Belgians\r\ndeclined to accept him, and on the 25th the national congress appointed\r\na regent to hold office till a king should be elected. On March 13 the\r\naccession to office of an anti-revolutionary ministry in France rendered\r\nthe complete co-operation of the powers easier.\r\n\r\nOn April 17 France declared her adhesion to the protocol of January 20,\r\nand by a new protocol the other four powers consented to the demolition\r\nof some of the Belgian fortresses on the French frontier. Another\r\nprotocol of the same date ordered the Belgians to evacuate the grand\r\nduchy of Luxemburg. On May 10 a further protocol even threatened Belgium\r\nwith the rupture of diplomatic relations in case she did not by June I\r\naccept the protocol of January 20. But the powers soon adopted a more\r\nconciliatory attitude. France and Great Britain desired that Prince\r\nLeopold of Saxe-Coburg, who in the previous year had resigned the crown\r\nof Greece, should now be offered that of Belgium. Prince Leopold would\r\nnot accept the crown so long as Belgium continued to defy the powers,\r\nand on the other hand there was no chance of securing his election by\r\nthe Belgian congress unless he undertook to maintain the Belgian claim\r\nto the possession of Luxemburg. Lord Ponsonby, the British minister at\r\nBrussels, succeeded in inducing the London conference to sign a new\r\nprotocol, undertaking to negotiate with Holland for the cession of\r\nLuxemburg to Belgium, in return for an indemnity elsewhere, provided\r\nthat Belgium should first accept the protocol of January 20. The Belgian\r\ncongress gathered that the acceptance of Prince Leopold was regarded by\r\nthe powers as more important than the maintenance of the terms of that\r\nprotocol, and they accordingly elected him as their king on June 4\r\nwithout accepting the protocol. In answer to Dutch complaints Ponsonby\r\nand General Belliard, the French minister, were recalled from Brussels\r\nas the protocol of May 10 required. Leopold refused to accept the crown\r\nuntil the conference should have offered better terms, and on the 26th\r\nthe conference signed another protocol, which differed from that of\r\nJanuary 20 in that it left the Luxemburg question open for future\r\nnegotiation, and rendered Holland liable for the whole of the debt that\r\nit had incurred before the union of the two countries. On the same day\r\nLeopold accepted the Belgian crown. The Belgian congress accepted this\r\nlast protocol on July 7, and on the 21st Leopold was proclaimed king,\r\nand immediately recognised by Great Britain and France. The other great\r\npowers were not long in following their example.\r\n\r\nIt was now Holland's turn to feel aggrieved. She refused to recognise\r\nthe changes proposed by the powers in the terms which she had already\r\naccepted. On May 21 she had declared that if the protocol of January 20\r\nwere not accepted by June 1 she would consider herself free to act on\r\nher own account, and on July 12 that the acceptance in Belgium of a king\r\nwho had not agreed to that protocol would be an act of hostility.\r\nFeeling herself betrayed by the conference she gave notice on August 1\r\nthat the armistice which had existed since the previous November would\r\nterminate on the 4th. It was soon seen how much Holland had lost in the\r\npreceding year by being found in a state of military unpreparedness.\r\nWhen hostilities began the Dutch carried everything before them. On the\r\n8th the Belgians were routed at Hasselt, and on the 13th Leopold in\r\nperson was compelled to surrender Louvain. But Holland was now arrested\r\nin the full tide of her success. The opportunity that French patriots\r\nhad long desired had presented itself, and Louis Philippe would only\r\nhave endangered his own throne if he had failed to come to the\r\nassistance of Belgium against Holland. On the 4th he received Leopold's\r\nappeal for assistance; on the 12th the first French division reached\r\nBrussels, and on the following day the Prince of Orange, who led the\r\nmain Dutch army, received orders from the Hague to retire within the\r\nDutch frontier.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _COERCION OF HOLLAND._]\r\n\r\nThe conference had in fact found it necessary to join in measures of\r\ncoercion. On the first news of the outbreak of hostilities it severely\r\nreproached Holland for the breach of the armistice, and ordered the\r\nDutch forces to retire. By a protocol of the 6th it accepted and\r\njustified the French expedition, which, it knew, could not safely be\r\nrecalled, and tried to minimise the danger by forbidding the French to\r\ncross the Dutch frontier and requiring them to return to France as soon\r\nas the Dutch should return to Holland. At the same time a semblance of\r\njoint action was created by the despatch of a British fleet to the\r\nDowns. If the Dutch invasion of Belgium created excitement in France,\r\nthe French expedition had a similar effect in England, and Palmerston\r\nfound it necessary to insist sternly on the immediate evacuation of\r\nBelgium upon the withdrawal of the Dutch troops. The French government\r\nnaturally desired to point to some tangible triumph of French arms, and\r\nrequested that the troops should be allowed to remain till the frontier\r\nfortresses should have been demolished in accordance with the protocol\r\nof April 17. In a somewhat insulting message Palmerston threatened a\r\ngeneral war sooner than allow the French troops to remain. The most that\r\nFrance could obtain was that 12,000 men might remain a fortnight longer\r\nthan the rest and that a number of French officers might enlist in the\r\nBelgian service.\r\n\r\nThe conference now returned to the task of effecting a settlement in\r\naccordance with the terms of the protocol of June 26. On October 15 it\r\nprovided for the partition of the grand duchy of Luxemburg between\r\nHolland and Belgium and for the indemnification of Holland with a larger\r\nportion of Limburg than had belonged to her in 1790. At the same time\r\nprovision was made for the freedom of the Scheldt, and the debt was\r\nreassessed, 8,400,000 florins of _rentes_[136] being assigned to Belgium\r\nand 19,300,000 to Holland. Along with this protocol a letter was sent to\r\nthe Belgian plenipotentiary, promising that if Belgium accepted it, the\r\npowers would undertake to obtain the consent of Holland. The protocol\r\nwas converted into a treaty by the adhesion of Belgium on November 15.\r\nMeanwhile the King of the Netherlands had appealed to the tsar against\r\nthe action of the western powers and of the Russian plenipotentiaries at\r\nLondon, and the tsar had in consequence refused to ratify the treaty\r\ntill the King of the Netherlands should have given his consent. That\r\nconsent was slow in coming. It was only on June 30, 1832, that Holland\r\nagreed to the exchange of territories and the reduction of Belgium's\r\nshare of the debt, and even then questions remained as to the dues on\r\nthe Scheldt and the transit of goods through Dutch Limburg. The Belgians\r\nrefused to negotiate further until the citadel of Antwerp should be\r\nsurrendered; the Dutch on the other hand refused to surrender it till a\r\ndefinite treaty should be signed and ratified. On October 1 France, with\r\nthe approval of the British government, proposed to suspend the payment\r\nof the Belgian share of the interest on the debt until the citadel of\r\nAntwerp should be surrendered, and to deduct from the share of the\r\nprincipal payable by Belgium, 500,000 florins of _rentes_ for each week\r\nthat should elapse before the surrender. The three eastern powers\r\nrefused to agree to any coercion of Holland, and, in consequence, Great\r\nBritain and France determined to act alone.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd they signed a convention providing for the coercion of\r\nHolland by an embargo and by the despatch of a squadron to the Dutch\r\ncoast. If any Dutch troops should be still in Belgium on November 15, a\r\nFrench force was empowered, subject to the consent of the Belgian\r\ngovernment, to advance into Belgium and expel the Dutch troops from the\r\ncountry. The French were, however, to retire as soon as the Dutch\r\nevacuation was complete. The first result of this convention was the\r\nsuspension of the conference. On the 29th the two powers made their\r\ndemand. As the Dutch refused compliance, a joint French and British\r\nfleet sailed on November 4 to blockade the Scheldt, and the embargo was\r\nproclaimed on the 6th. On the 15th a French army of 56,000 men,\r\ncommanded by Gérard, entered Belgium. On December 4 it opened fire on\r\nthe citadel of Antwerp, which surrendered after a nineteen days'\r\nbombardment on the 23rd. The French army returned to its own country\r\nbefore the end of the year, leaving the Dutch in possession of two small\r\nforts on the Belgian side of the frontier, which were more than\r\ncompensated by the positions held by the Belgians in Dutch Limburg. Even\r\nthe fall of the citadel of Antwerp did not induce Holland to accept the\r\nsettlement proposed by the powers, and Great Britain and France now\r\nattempted to effect a working agreement pending negotiations on the\r\ndetails of the treaty. It was in vain that Holland asked that Belgium\r\nshould evacuate the Dutch provinces of Limburg and Luxemburg and pay\r\nher share of the interest on the Dutch debt. Palmerston and Talleyrand\r\nrefused to include these provisions in a preliminary convention. Finally\r\non March 21, 1833, a convention was signed between Great Britain,\r\nFrance, and Holland, which terminated the embargo and provided for the\r\nfree navigation of the Scheldt and Maas. A similar convention was signed\r\nbetween Holland and Belgium on November 18. Six years, however, were to\r\nelapse before the Dutch government would consent to the conditions drawn\r\nup by the powers in 1831. Meanwhile the Belgians were free from their\r\nshare of debt, held the greater part of Limburg and Luxemburg, and\r\nenjoyed the free navigation of the Maas and the Scheldt, over and above\r\nthe terms granted them in 1831.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _POLISH REBELLION._]\r\n\r\nIt is inconceivable that the Belgian question should have been left so\r\nentirely in the hands of the two western powers, and that the settlement\r\nshould have taken the form of a foreign coercion of a legitimate king\r\nfor his unreadiness to make concessions to his revolted subjects, had\r\nnot the attention of the three absolutist powers of eastern and central\r\nEurope been directed to another quarter. Just as the revolution of 1820\r\nhad spread through southern Europe in spite of Castlereagh's attempt to\r\nmaintain that it was not of a contagious order, so that of 1830 awakened\r\nsimilar outbursts not only at Brussels but in various German states, in\r\nSwitzerland, in Poland, and in Italy. The Polish insurrection was, like\r\nthe Belgian, a national revolt, and the consequent military operations\r\nwere of the nature of a war between Poland and Russia. The revolt broke\r\nout at Warsaw on November 29, 1830, and on January 25, 1831, the Polish\r\ndiet proclaimed the independence of Poland. On February 5 a Russian army\r\ncrossed the Polish frontier. In France there was a loud popular demand\r\nfor intervention. But even the Laffitte ministry would not move without\r\nthe co-operation of Great Britain, though the French ambassador at\r\nConstantinople tried to stir up the Porte to hostilities. The ministry\r\nof Casimir-Perier, which came into office in March, proposed a joint\r\nmediation of France and Great Britain, but to this Palmerston would not\r\nassent. He remonstrated with Russia on her violations of the Polish\r\nconstitution, which Great Britain, along with the other powers, had\r\nguaranteed at the congress of Vienna, but he could not support the\r\nPolish claim to independence, since Great Britain had made herself a\r\nparty to the union of the two countries. As it happened, the\r\nremonstrance was simply a cause of annoyance, which subsequent events\r\nwere destined to intensify. It was only on September 8, 1831, that the\r\nRussians under Paskievitch captured Warsaw, an event which was followed\r\non February 26, 1832, by the abolition of the Polish constitution.\r\nPalmerston protested again but with no more success than in the previous\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _DOM MIGUEL AND DON CARLOS._]\r\n\r\nIn the Portuguese, as in the Belgian question, Palmerston drifted from\r\nthe position of a neutral into that of a partisan. Ever since the year\r\n1828, British subjects accused of political offences had been brutally\r\nill-treated in Portugal, and as time went on the excesses increased. By\r\ndespatching six British warships to the Tagus Palmerston succeeded in\r\nobtaining a pecuniary indemnity and a public apology on May 2, 1831.\r\nSimilar insults to France were not so readily redressed. A threat of\r\nforce on the part of the French government was followed by an appeal\r\nfrom Dom Miguel for British assistance. This Palmerston refused to\r\ngrant, and in July a French squadron under Admiral Roussin forced the\r\npassage of the Tagus, and carried off the best ships of the Portuguese\r\nnavy. Meanwhile much irritation had been caused in Brazil by Peter's\r\nadvocacy of his daughter's claim to Portugal, which was considered\r\ninconsistent with his professed adherence to the separation of the two\r\ncountries. On April 6, Peter abdicated the crown of Brazil in favour of\r\nhis infant son, Peter II., and on the following day sailed for Europe in\r\norder to assert his daughter's right to the Portuguese throne. He\r\narrived in Europe towards the end of May, and visited both England and\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThough neither government assisted him directly, he was permitted to\r\nraise troops and even to secure the services of naval officers, and in\r\nDecember a force of 300 men sailed from Liverpool to Belleisle, which he\r\nhad appointed as the rendezvous. Palmerston had thus, unlike Wellington,\r\nadopted the same attitude towards the Portuguese liberals that Ferdinand\r\nVII. had adopted towards the absolutists. Peter's expedition gathered\r\nfurther strength at the Azores and sailed for Portugal on June 27, 1832.\r\nOn July 8, the fleet, commanded by Admiral Sartorius, a British officer,\r\nappeared off Oporto, which submitted on the following day. The town was,\r\nhowever, blockaded by Miguel's forces and Peter's cause made no headway\r\nuntil in June, 1833, the command of the fleet was transferred to Captain\r\n(afterwards Admiral Sir Charles) Napier. On the night of June 24, he\r\nlanded at Villa Real a force of 2,500 men who conquered the province of\r\nAlgarve in a week, and on July 5 he annihilated Miguel's navy in an\r\nengagement off Cape St. Vincent. After a further battle near Lisbon,\r\nPeter's forces entered the capital on the 24th, and subsequently\r\nrepulsed a Miguelite attack upon the city. Miguel still held out in\r\nnorthern Portugal, when another train of events caused the western\r\npowers to substitute direct for indirect interference.\r\n\r\nFerdinand VII. of Spain had fallen so entirely under the influence of\r\nhis fourth and last queen, Maria Christina of Naples, as to repeal by a\r\npragmatic sanction the Salic law which the treaty of Utrecht had\r\nestablished as the rule of succession in Spain. The result of this edict\r\nwas to leave the succession to his infant daughter Isabella instead of\r\nhis brother Don Carlos, the leader of the Spanish absolutists. When\r\nFerdinand died on September 29, 1833, Don Carlos was absent from the\r\nkingdom, supporting the cause of his fellow-pretender Dom Miguel.\r\nIsabella received the hearty support of the constitutional party and was\r\nalmost universally acknowledged as queen. It was only in Biscay, where\r\nthe centralising tendency of the Spanish constitution, published on\r\nApril 10, 1834, seemed to entrench upon local liberty, that Don Carlos\r\nmet with much active support. His cause, like that of Miguel in\r\nPortugal, was the more popular, but his adherents were as yet almost\r\nentirely devoid of organisation. Peter's partisans had already made\r\nsubstantial progress towards a complete victory, and Santha Martha, the\r\nMiguelite commander-in-chief, had surrendered in the beginning of April,\r\nwhen on April 22 a triple alliance, already signed between Great\r\nBritain, Maria Christina, Queen-regent of Spain, and Peter, as regent of\r\nPortugal, was converted into a quadruple alliance by the adhesion of\r\nFrance. This treaty provided for the co-operation of Spain and Portugal\r\nto expel Dom Miguel and Don Carlos from the Portuguese dominions. Great\r\nBritain was to assist by the employment of a naval force, and France was\r\nto render assistance, if required, in such manner as should be settled\r\nafterwards by common consent of the four contracting powers. The Spanish\r\ngeneral, Rodil, immediately crossed the frontier. He met with no\r\nresistance, and on May 26 Miguel signed a convention at Evora, by which\r\nhe accepted a pension, renounced his rights to the Portuguese throne,\r\nand agreed to quit the country.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE CARLIST WAR._]\r\n\r\nDon Carlos, however, refused to renounce his rights to the Spanish\r\nthrone, and all that the British navy could do was to convey the two\r\npretenders, Carlos to England and Miguel to Genoa. Although Miguel, on\r\nJune 20, repudiated his abdication, the Portuguese question was really\r\nat an end. The Spanish question was, however, merely entering on its\r\ncritical stage. Don Carlos secretly left London on July 1, and nine days\r\nlater appeared at the Carlist headquarters in Spain. Here he had the\r\nassistance of the ablest general of this war, Zumalacarregui.\r\nMelbourne's succession to the premiership in July left Palmerston at the\r\nforeign office, and was followed by no change in foreign policy. On\r\nAugust 18 an additional article to the quadruple alliance provided that\r\nFrance was to prevent reinforcements or warlike stores from reaching Don\r\nCarlos from the French side of the frontier, while Great Britain was to\r\nsupply arms and stores to the Spanish royalists and, if necessary,\r\nintervene with a naval force. The short interlude of conservative\r\ngovernment, with Peel as premier and Wellington as foreign secretary,\r\nwas not marked by any change of policy nor yet by any new aggressions.\r\nWellington's only interference with the course of hostilities was the\r\nmission of Lord Eliot to Navarre, which induced the combatants to\r\nabandon for the time being those cruelties to prisoners which had been\r\nthe disgrace of the Spanish civil wars.\r\n\r\nShortly after the return of Melbourne and Palmerston to power,\r\nZumalacarregui won a victory in the valley of Amascoas on April 21 and\r\n22, 1835, which opened to him the road to Madrid. The Madrid government\r\nnow appealed to France to send 12,000 men to occupy the Basque\r\nprovinces. By the terms of the quadruple alliance the assent of Great\r\nBritain and Portugal was necessary in order to determine the manner in\r\nwhich France was to render assistance. Thiers, on behalf of Louis\r\nPhilippe, suggested a separate French expedition on the lines of that of\r\n1823. Palmerston, like Canning before him, refused to sanction such an\r\nexpedition, though he was prepared to allow France to make the\r\nexpedition on her own responsibility. He suggested in return that Great\r\nBritain should intervene. But Louis Philippe was equally opposed to the\r\nseparate action of his own country and of Great Britain, and the result\r\nwas that neither government sent any troops. The Spanish government was,\r\nhowever, permitted to enlist volunteers, and actually received the\r\nassistance of an English legion, a French legion, and 6,000 Portuguese.\r\nThe immediate danger was averted by the obstinacy of Don Carlos, who\r\nrefused to permit Zumalacarregui to march on Madrid till the conquest of\r\nBiscay was complete. The Carlist general turned aside in consequence to\r\nthe siege of Bilbao, in which a few weeks later he met his death.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1836, some changes in the French ministry increased the\r\npower of Thiers, who had so recently advocated the policy of\r\nintervention. Palmerston now proposed a French expedition to the Basque\r\nprovinces, while the British were to occupy St. Sebastian and Pasages.\r\nThiers did not, however, feel strong enough to accept this offer, and\r\nPalmerston determined to act alone. A British squadron under Lord John\r\nHay was despatched to the Spanish coast with instructions to assist the\r\nroyalist forces. This squadron is probably entitled to the principal\r\nshare in the credit for the successful resistance of Bilbao to the\r\nCarlist armies. In May, however, a conservative government entered upon\r\noffice in Spain, and France became more ready to grant assistance.\r\nIsturiz, the new Spanish premier, persuaded Louis Philippe to send some\r\ntroops to Spain; but by leaning on foreign support Isturiz had\r\noverreached himself. Spanish indignation found vent in a revolutionary\r\nmovement, accompanied by bloodshed; one town after another declared for\r\nthe constitution of 1812, which the queen-regent was forced to sign on\r\nAugust 13, and on the following day a progressist ministry was installed\r\nin office. Austria, Prussia, and Russia withdrew their ambassadors from\r\nMadrid after the riots of the 13th, and Louis Philippe recalled the\r\nforces he had sent to the assistance of the Spanish government. Had Don\r\nCarlos listened to the advice of the eastern powers and given such\r\nassurances as might have won over the more moderate of Isabella's\r\nsupporters, he would probably have proved successful. As it was the war\r\ndragged on, but De Lacy Evans, who was in command of the British legion,\r\nleft Spain on June 10, 1837, and most of his men followed soon after.\r\nThe question of intervention had, however, put an end to that cordial\r\nco-operation of Great Britain and France which had existed ever since\r\nthe July revolution, and left Great Britain as isolated in the counsels\r\nof Europe as she had been when Canning and Wellington dissociated\r\nthemselves from the other powers at Verona.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the Greek question proceeded very slowly. While the\r\npowers were seeking a possible king, Capodistrias exercised an\r\nautocratic sway as president. However, in the spring of 1831, the\r\nMainots of southern Laconia and the Hydriots revolted against him, and\r\ngot possession of the Greek fleet. Capodistrias appealed to Russia for\r\nassistance, and a Russian squadron was sent to blockade the Greek fleet\r\nat Poros. But Miaoulis, the Greek admiral, sank his ships in order to\r\nsave them from the Russians. The situation was simplified by the\r\nassassination of Capodistrias on October 9, which left two rival\r\nnational assemblies struggling for the mastery. The French troops failed\r\nto maintain order, and the way was clear for a king who would have the\r\nprestige of an international treaty and an independent revenue to\r\nsupport his position. This was the situation when on February 13, 1832,\r\na protocol was signed at London, offering the Greek crown to Otto, the\r\nsecond son of King Lewis of Bavaria, a boy of seventeen. The boundary\r\nwas to be fixed where Palmerston, while still a member of the Wellington\r\nadministration, had wished to fix it, along a line running from the Gulf\r\nof Arta to that of Volo. King Lewis would not, however, agree to accept\r\nthe crown for his son unless he should be granted the title of king,\r\ninstead of prince, and should be guaranteed a loan to enable him to meet\r\nthe expenses of his position. On May 7, 1832, the London protocol was\r\nembodied in a treaty of London; the crown was definitely conferred on\r\nOtto, who was given the title of king, guaranteed a loan, not exceeding\r\n£2,400,000, and allowed to take out 3,500 Bavarian troops with him. The\r\nTurkish consent to the proposed boundary was given on July 21; Greece\r\naccepted the treaty in August, and the new king left for his kingdom in\r\nDecember.[137]\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _VICTORIES OF IBRAHIM._]\r\n\r\nGreece now disappears from the eastern question. But Ibrahim Pasha,\r\nwhose successes in Greece had induced Canning to interfere, had already\r\ndisclosed a new phase of that question by successes gained in another\r\nquarter. Mehemet Ali had quickly repaired the losses which his fleet and\r\narmy had sustained in the Peloponnese. Meanwhile he demanded from\r\nSultan Mahmud that Ibrahim should be compensated with a part of Syria\r\nfor the loss of the Morea, which had been promised him as a reward for\r\nhis services in Greece. The sultan refused to grant this insolent\r\ndemand, and Mehemet Ali determined to conquer the province for himself.\r\nAbdallah, Pasha of Acre, had taken under his protection some fugitive\r\npeasants, and Mehemet Ali, in spite of the sultan's prohibition, sent\r\nIbrahim with an army of 30,000 men against him. He laid siege to Acre on\r\nDecember 9, 1831, and took it on May 27, 1832. On July 8 he routed a\r\nTurkish army at Homs; on the 29th he routed a larger army at the pass of\r\nBeilan, and on the 31st he entered Antioch. In November he was at\r\nKonieh. The Tsar Nicholas had, with Palmerston's approval, already sent\r\nLieutenant-General Muraviov on a mission to Constantinople, offering\r\nmilitary and naval support; but the sultan preferred to seek British\r\nassistance first.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the message came at a time when the British fleet was\r\npreparing to blockade the coasts of the Netherlands, and could not be\r\nspared for service In the Mediterranean. An appeal to France was equally\r\nunsuccessful. She had by this time formed the siege of the citadel of\r\nAntwerp, and was moreover naturally averse from a struggle with Ibrahim,\r\nwhose army had been organised and trained by French officers. The sultan\r\ntherefore decided to avail himself of the offers made by Russia. Indeed\r\nhe had no choice, for the news now came that on December 21 Ibrahim had\r\ncompletely defeated the Turkish general, Reshid, at Konieh and that\r\nthere was no army between him and Constantinople. Muraviov was sent on a\r\nvain mission to Alexandria with authority to cede Acre to Mehemet Ali if\r\nhe would surrender his fleet to the sultan. Ibrahim advanced to Kiutayeh\r\nand his advance-guard came as far as Broussa. The sultan on February 2,\r\n1833, requested the assistance of the Russian navy, and on the 20th a\r\nRussian squadron appeared at Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe powers that had refused to move to save Turkey from Ibrahim were\r\nquick enough to interfere when the danger was from Russia and not from\r\nan oriental. Ibrahim might have been expected to make a stronger ruler\r\nthan the sultan, whose fall seemed imminent. A Russian protectorate was\r\na different matter. Roussin, the French ambassador at Constantinople,\r\nprotested against the Russian alliance and threatened to leave\r\nConstantinople. A French envoy was, at his suggestion, permitted to\r\noffer Mehemet the governorship of the Syrian pashaliks of Tripoli and\r\nAcre. On March 8 Mehemet rejected these terms, and declared that if his\r\nown terms were not accepted within six weeks his troops would march upon\r\nConstantinople. The sultan then turned to Russia again and asked for\r\ntroops. Fifteen thousand Russians were in consequence landed on the\r\nshores of the Bosphorus, and in the beginning of April an army of\r\n24,000, which had remained in Moldavia ever since the war of 1828-29,\r\nprepared to march southwards. Constantinople at least was thus rendered\r\nsafe from Ibrahim, and there was therefore more hope that Mehemet would\r\ncome to terms. The British, French, and Austrian ambassadors spared no\r\neffort to induce the Porte to offer terms that might be accepted, and\r\ntheir representations were probably rendered the more persuasive by the\r\nappearance of British and French fleets in the Ægean. Roussin especially\r\nurged that it was better to surrender Syria than to reconquer it by\r\nRussian troops. At last the sultan yielded, and on April 10 a peace was\r\nsigned at Kiutayeh, though not ratified by the sultan till May 15. This\r\ntreaty granted to Mehemet Ali Syria and Cilicia, but restored the bulk\r\nof Asia Minor to the Porte.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _CONFERENCE OF MÜNCHENGRÄTZ._]\r\n\r\nTurkey had been saved by the western powers, but only because they\r\ndreaded the possibility of her being saved by Russia. A few weeks later\r\ntheir worst fears seemed on the point of realisation. The Russian troops\r\non the Bosphorus were a sure guarantee of the predominance of Russian\r\ninfluence at Constantinople, and this was illustrated in a marked degree\r\nby the treaty of Unkiar Skelessi, signed on July 8, which provided for a\r\ndefensive alliance for eight years between Russia and the Porte. Russia\r\nwas, when required, to provide the sultan with both military and naval\r\nforces, to be provisioned by him, but otherwise maintained by Russia. A\r\nsecret article, soon made known, provided that Russia would not ask for\r\nmaterial aid if at war, but that in that event the Porte would close the\r\nDardanelles to the warships of other nations. Great Britain had already\r\nobtained the rights of the most favoured nation, so far as the passage\r\nof the Dardanelles was concerned, and therefore maintained that the\r\ntreaty did not affect her right to pass those straits; and France\r\njoined her in presenting identical notes declaring their intention of\r\nignoring the treaty in event of war. British public opinion, already\r\nwounded by the conquest of Poland, was even more vehemently affected\r\nthan British policy. The treaty was regarded as the establishment in\r\nTurkey of a Russian protectorate, which it was necessary for Great\r\nBritain to destroy, and the antagonism thus produced has lasted to our\r\nown day. Matters were not improved when the tsar asked for the cession\r\nof the Danubian principalities, which were still occupied by Russia, in\r\nreturn for a remission of the war indemnity owing since 1829. Austria,\r\nFrance, and Great Britain protested against this proposal, and in\r\nconsequence nothing came of it.\r\n\r\nAustria then assumed the _rôle_ of mediator. A friendly request for\r\nexplanation elicited a declaration from Russia, disclaiming all\r\nintention of self-aggrandisement, and promising to accept the mediation\r\nof Austria in any case where the treaty could be invoked. Austria in\r\nconsequence endeavoured to persuade the western powers that there was no\r\nimmediate danger, and that she would use her mediation to remove any\r\ndanger that might arise. Meanwhile she endeavoured to allay distrust of\r\nRussia by inducing that power to evacuate the Danubian principalities.\r\nBut before this result could be accomplished the negotiations between\r\nAustria and Russia had taken a turn which gave Austria, in English eyes,\r\nthe appearance of an accomplice rather than of a mediator. The\r\nrevolutionary movements of 1830 and following years had produced grave\r\napprehensions in the minds of the rulers of the three eastern powers,\r\nAustria, Prussia, and Russia; and the coercion of Holland and Portugal\r\ncaused them to feel a deep distrust of the policy of Great Britain and\r\nFrance, and to grasp the necessity of united action against the\r\nrevolutionary forces at work in Europe. For this purpose it was\r\nconsidered necessary to revive Metternich's policy of 1820 as defined at\r\nTroppau. The three powers had for some time been drawing together, and\r\nin September, 1833, the Emperors Francis and Nicholas and the Crown\r\nPrince of Prussia met at Münchengrätz in Bohemia, where a secret\r\nconvention was signed on the 18th. They refused to recognise Isabella as\r\nQueen of Spain in the event of Ferdinand's death; they arranged for\r\nmutual assistance against the Poles; and agreed to combine to resist\r\nany change of dynasty in Turkey and any extension of Arab rule into\r\nEurope. In the event of a collapse of the Ottoman empire, Austria and\r\nRussia were to act together in settling the reversion. On October 15 the\r\nthree powers signed a further convention at Berlin, containing one\r\npublic and two secret articles. The latter recognised the right, already\r\nasserted at Troppau, of intervention in the internal affairs of a\r\ncountry whose sovereign expressed a desire for foreign assistance. There\r\ncan be little doubt that Austria and Russia were in earnest in their\r\nprofessed desire to maintain the integrity of the Turkish dominions, but\r\nan opinion gained ground in England that they had already agreed to\r\npartition them between themselves.\r\n\r\nOn January 29, 1834, Austrian mediation bore fruit in a definite treaty\r\nfor the evacuation of the Danubian principalities. Russia merely\r\nreserved to herself the appointment of the first hospodar of each\r\nprincipality. The first act, however, of Alexander Ghika, the new\r\nhospodar of Wallachia, was to forbid any change of statute without the\r\nconsent of Russia. Silistria alone remained in Russian hands till a\r\nthird part of the indemnity should be paid. The remaining two-thirds\r\nRussia consented to abandon. A revolt among the Syrian mountaineers gave\r\nRussia an opportunity of demonstrating her pacific intentions. The\r\nsultan supported the revolt and also sent troops to conquer Urfa which\r\nIbrahim had neglected to surrender. Russia, however, refused to support\r\nthe sultan in an aggressive war, and the powers negotiated a peace. The\r\nSyrian revolt was quelled, and Urfa surrendered to the sultan. In 1835\r\nthe Tsar Nicholas and the new Austrian emperor, Ferdinand, met at\r\nTeplitz where they renewed the agreements concluded at Münchengrätz.\r\nMetternich proposed a conference at Vienna to settle the eastern\r\nquestion, but the tsar, who really possessed the decisive voice so long\r\nas the question remained open, refused to hear of this. Finally in\r\nSeptember, 1836, the Russian evacuation of Silistria was obtained by a\r\npayment of 30,000,000 piastres, borrowed, for the most part, in England.\r\nThe Eastern question now seemed to have entered upon a quieter phase,\r\nand the military reforms which European officers, including Moltke,\r\nafterwards famous in a different region, were carrying out in Turkey,\r\ngave promise that she might be able to hold her own in future against\r\ndomestic foes.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[136] The debt was, according to the French practice, expressed in terms\r\nof the interest payable annually (_rentes_), not in terms of a nominal\r\nprincipal as in this country.\r\n\r\n[137] Finlay, _History of Greece_, vol. vii., chapters ii., iii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n                             BRITISH INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Pitt resigned office in 1801, the Marquis Wellesley had already\r\nreached the climax, though by no means the close, of his brilliant\r\nproconsulate. This remarkable man, whose fame has been unduly eclipsed\r\nby that of his younger brother, may justly be considered the second\r\nfounder of our Indian Empire. This empire, recognised at last, in the\r\nvote of thanks passed by the house of commons on the fall of\r\nSeringapatam, was soon to be aggrandised by three important accessions\r\nof dominion. The first of these was the annexation of the Karnátik on\r\nthe well-founded plea that its nabob was too weak even for the semblance\r\nof independence, that he was incapable of governing tolerably, and that\r\nhe had been in correspondence with Tipú. The effect of this and two\r\nminor annexations was to place the entire south-western and\r\nsouth-eastern coasts of the Indian peninsula under the British rule. The\r\nnext step was the system of subsidiary treaties, whereby the British\r\ngovernment assumed a protectorate over native states, providing a fixed\r\nnumber of troops for their defence and receiving an equivalent in\r\nsubsidies. The Nizám of Haidarábád was already in a condition little\r\nremoved from vassalage, and now surrendered considerable districts in\r\nlieu of a pecuniary tribute.\r\n\r\nA similar course was taken with the Nawáb Wazír of Oudh whose territory\r\nwas threatened on one side by the Afghán king, Zemán Sháh, and on\r\nanother by the Maráthá lord, Daulat Ráo Sindhia, who had gained\r\npossession of Delhi. By forcible negotiations Wellesley obtained from\r\nhim the cession of all his frontier provinces, including Rohilkhand, and\r\nconsolidated the power of the Indian government along the whole line of\r\nthe Jumna and Ganges. The last and greatest object of the\r\ngovernor-general's ambition was the conquest of the confederate Maráthá\r\nstates, and for this a pretext was not long wanting. His forward policy,\r\nit is true, had already excited alarm and criticism at home, while the\r\npeace of Amiens had ostensibly removed the chief justification of\r\nit--the necessity of combating the aggressive designs of France. But, in\r\nthe case of India, far more than of the American colonies, \"months\r\npassed and seas rolled between the order and the execution\"; for in\r\nthose days ships conveying despatches occupied at least four or five\r\nmonths on their voyage, and decisions taken in Leadenhall Street might\r\nbe utterly stultified by accomplished facts before they could be read in\r\nCalcutta.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _WELLESLEY AND LAKE._]\r\n\r\nThe Peshwá, at Poona, still maintained a show of independent authority\r\nover the other great Maráthá chieftains, Sindhia, Holkar, and the Rájá\r\nof Nágpur or Berár. But the real military power of the Maráthás rested\r\nwith these leaders, and their predatory troops of horsemen terrorised\r\nall Central India. Happily for Wellesley's purpose, they were often at\r\nfeud with each other, and the Peshwá, though aided by Sindhia, was\r\nutterly defeated by Jaswant Ráo Holkar. He fled to Bassein near Bombay,\r\nwhere, on December 31, 1802, a treaty was signed by which not only the\r\nPeshwá but the Nizám of Haidarábád was placed under British protection.\r\nThe Peshwá was conducted back to Poona by a British force under Arthur\r\nWellesley in May, 1803, but the other Maráthá chiefs naturally resented\r\nthis fresh encroachment on their independence, and a league was shortly\r\nformed between the Rájá of Nágpur and Sindhia, which it was hoped that\r\nHolkar would ultimately join. By this time, a rupture of the peace with\r\nFrance was known to be impending, and Lord Wellesley eagerly seized the\r\nopportunity to crush Sindhia, while he urged the home government to\r\nseize the Cape of Good Hope and the Mauritius. Two expeditions were\r\ndirected against Sindhia's territory, the one under Arthur Wellesley,\r\nmoving from Poona in the west towards the Nizám's frontier; the other,\r\nunder General Lake, operating on the north-west against the highly\r\ntrained forces, under French officers, assembled before Delhi. Both\r\ncampaigns were eminently successful. Wellesley captured Ahmadnagar on\r\nAugust 11, encountered the combined armies of Sindhia and the Rájá of\r\nNágpur at Assaye on September 23, and, after a desperate conflict,\r\nobtained a decisive victory. Twelve hundred of the Maráthás were left\r\ndead on the field and 102 guns were captured. He then advanced into\r\nBerár and completely defeated the army of the Nágpur Rájá at Argáum.\r\nLake marched from Cawnpur, took Delhi and Agra, assuming custody of the\r\nMughal emperor, and inflicted a final defeat on a powerful Maráthá army,\r\nno longer under French officers, at Laswári. Large cessions of territory\r\nfollowed. The treaty of Bassein was recognised by Sindhia and the Rájá\r\nof Nágpur. Gujrát, Cuttack, and the districts along the Jumna passed\r\ninto British possession, and the East India Company became the visible\r\nsuccessor, though nominally the guardian, of the Mughal emperor.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Holkar remained a passive spectator of the contest. Jealous\r\nas he was of Sindhia, he was by no means prepared to acquiesce in the\r\nsubjection of the great Maráthá power. Having taken up a threatening\r\nposition in Rájputána, and defied Lake's summons to retire, he was\r\ntreated as an enemy, and proved a very formidable enemy. Instead of\r\nrelying, like Sindhia, on disciplined battalions, he fell back on the\r\nold Maráthá tactics, and swept the country with hordes of irregular\r\ncavalry who lived by pillage. In 1804 a British force of 1,200 troops\r\nunder Colonel Monson was lured away from its base of supplies by a\r\nfeigned retreat and incurred a very serious reverse; scarcely a tenth of\r\nthem, utterly broken, \"straggled, a mere rabble, into Agra\". This\r\ndisaster was soon afterwards retrieved by other divisions of Lake's\r\narmy, but three attempts to storm the strong fortress of Bhartpur were\r\nrepulsed by the rájá, Ranjít Singh, an ally of Holkar. Though Holkar's\r\nbands were at last dispersed, a new dispute arose with Sindhia about the\r\nownership of Gwalior and Gohad, which remained unsettled when Lord\r\nWellesley resigned early in 1805, not so much because his policy was\r\ndisapproved by the court of directors, for whom he always professed a\r\nsovereign contempt, as because he was no longer cordially supported by\r\nthe home government.\r\n\r\nIn his despatch to the secret committee of the East India Company after\r\nthe conclusion of the war with Sindhia, Wellesley describes the\r\nconsolidation of the British empire and the pacification of all India,\r\nas the supreme result of his beneficent rule.[138] That rule was\r\nfollowed by ten years of comparative repose, if not of reaction, but two\r\nevents, occurring within this period, threw a significant light on the\r\ninherent danger of relying too much on a native army under British\r\nofficers. Sepoy regiments had been raised and had served loyally on both\r\nsides in the struggles between the French and English during the\r\neighteenth century. The Bengal sepoys were mostly Rájputs and showed the\r\nhighest military qualities in many a wearisome march and hard fought\r\nfield, from the days of Clive to those of Lake and Arthur Wellesley. But\r\noutbreaks bordering upon mutiny had occasionally taken place in the\r\nnative armies of all the presidencies, and on July 10, 1806, a most\r\nformidable mutiny, ending in a massacre at Vellore, west of Madras,\r\nproduced a sense of insecurity throughout all India. It was instigated\r\nby the family of Tipú who had been quartered in that fortress, and its\r\nimmediate origin was the issue of certain vexatious regulations about\r\nuniform which offended native prejudices of caste. The European force,\r\nnumbering some 370, was surprised and surrounded by a much larger body\r\nof sepoys, half of them were killed or wounded, and Tipú's standard was\r\nhoisted. Within a few hours, however, cavalry and artillery arrived from\r\nArcot, the mutineers were slaughtered by hundreds, and the disaffected\r\nregiments were broken up. Three years later, a serious mutiny broke out\r\namong the company's own officers at Madras, caused by a petty grievance\r\naffecting their profits on tent-contracts. It was appeased rather than\r\nsuppressed, and, notwithstanding these discouraging symptoms of\r\ninsecurity, the Company's army retained its separate organisation for\r\nhalf a century longer.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _MINTO'S PACIFIC POLICY._]\r\n\r\nLord Cornwallis, the successor of Lord Wellesley, was opposed by\r\nconviction to a progressive expansion of British territory, and\r\nrepresented not only the cautious views of the home government, but the\r\nfinancial anxieties of the East India Company, which always valued a\r\nsteady revenue more highly than imperial supremacy. Wellesley had\r\nvirtually reconstructed the map of India on lines destined to endure\r\nuntil a fresh period of annexation set in some forty years later. These\r\nlines were not disturbed by Cornwallis, who died on October 5, 1805,\r\nthree months after his arrival, but he clearly indicated his desire to\r\nlet the system of protectorates and subsidiary treaties fall gradually\r\ninto abeyance. His correspondence with Lake, whose victories had won him\r\nthe rank of baron, contains a somewhat peremptory warning against fresh\r\nengagements contemplated by that enterprising officer, whose vigorous\r\nremonstrance he did not live to receive.[139] Sir George Barlow, who\r\nbecame acting governor-general for two years, adopted the same passive\r\nattitude, and forebore to carry out a projected alliance with Sindhia,\r\nthough he would not allow any interference with our paramount influence\r\nat Poona and Haidarábád. Lord Minto, father of the Earl of Minto who\r\npresided at the admiralty under Melbourne, arrived as governor-general\r\nin 1807. He was imbued with similar ideas, and was fortunate in finding\r\nthe Maráthás too much weakened to be dangerous neighbours. His rule was,\r\ntherefore, essentially pacific, but he did good service in maintaining\r\ninternal order, and especially in putting down the organised brigandage,\r\nknown as \"dakáiti,\" which had been the curse of rural districts. The\r\ndistinctive feature of his career, however, was a permanent enlargement\r\nof the horizon of Indian statesmanship to a sphere beyond the confines\r\nof India and even of Asia, a change due to new movements in the vast\r\ninternational conflict then engrossing the energies of Europe.\r\n\r\nHowever chimerical the designs of Napoleon against British India may now\r\nappear, there is no doubt that such designs were seriously entertained\r\nby him, nor is it self-evident that what Alexander the Great found\r\npossible would have proved impossible to one who combined with\r\nAlexander's superhuman audacity the command of resources beyond anything\r\nknown in the ancient world. At all events, after the battle of Friedland\r\nand the peace of Tilsit, an expedition to be launched from Russian\r\nterritory upon the north-west frontier of India, with the support of\r\nPersia on the flank, became a contingency which an Indian\r\ngovernor-general could not afford to neglect. It is, indeed, strange\r\nthat a march across Europe and half of Asia should have appeared to\r\nNapoleon more practicable than a voyage across the English Channel, and\r\nit is highly improbable that he would have cherished the idea of it, if\r\nhe could have foreseen the perils of the Russian expedition. But his\r\nconversations at St. Helena prove that it was not a mere vision but a\r\nhalf-formed design, and, even after it had been discouraged by Russia,\r\nhe sent a preliminary mission to Persia. Minto lost no time in sending\r\ncounter-missions, not only to Tihran, but to Lahore, Afghánistán, and\r\nSind.\r\n\r\nThe Persian court was already in diplomatic relations with the Indian\r\ngovernment. Colonel Malcolm, afterwards Sir John Malcolm, had been sent\r\nby Wellesley as envoy to the sháh at the end of 1800, and in January,\r\n1801, a treaty had been signed, establishing free trade between India\r\nand Persia, and binding the sháh to exclude the French from his\r\ndominions, while the company undertook to provide ships, troops, and\r\nstores, in case of French invasion. This treaty, however, neither was\r\nnor could have been actively carried out on either side. Early in 1806\r\nthe sháh, who had become embroiled with Russia, appealed to Calcutta for\r\naid, regardless of the fact that hostilities with Russia were not a\r\n_casus foederis_. Failing to obtain it, he appealed to France.\r\nNapoleon despatched General Gardane, who arrived in December, 1807. He\r\nobtained a treaty under which the sháh engaged to banish all Englishmen\r\non demand of the French emperor. Thereupon Malcolm was entrusted by\r\nMinto with a fresh mission, but never reached the Persian capital, where\r\nFrench influence was still paramount, and the peremptory tone of\r\nMalcolm's letters was resented. Meanwhile, Sir Harford Jones had been\r\nsent out by the British foreign office, and was received at Tihran in\r\nFebruary, 1809, the peace of Tilsit having destroyed the Persian hope of\r\nFrench support against Russia. For a while, the right of negotiating\r\nwith the sháh was in dispute between the Indian government and the\r\nforeign office, and Sir John Malcolm reappeared at Tihran in the spring\r\nof 1810, as the representative of the former. In the end, however, he\r\nco-operated loyally with Jones, and a fresh treaty was signed, though\r\nboth these rival emissaries were soon afterwards superseded by Sir Gore\r\nOuseley as permanent ambassador.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _ELPHINSTONE IN AFGHÁNISTÁN._]\r\n\r\nTwo other envoys selected by Minto left names which are famous in\r\nAnglo-Indian history, and one achieved an important success. Charles\r\nMetcalfe, Minto's envoy to Lahore, succeeded with the advantage of an\r\narmed force within easy reach of the Sikh frontier, in converting into\r\nan ally the redoubtable Ranjít Singh (not to be confounded with Ranjít\r\nSingh of Bhartpur), who had gathered into his own hands the Sikh\r\nconfederacy and acquired sovereignty over the whole Punjab. He was now\r\ninduced not only to accept the Sutlej river as the boundary line of his\r\ndominion, but to conclude a treaty of perpetual amity with the British\r\ngovernment. This treaty remained unbroken until his death, and stood us\r\nin good stead during the perilous crisis of the first Afghán war. The\r\nembassy of Mountstuart Elphinstone to Afghánistán was comparatively\r\nfruitless, chiefly owing to the unsettled state of that mysterious\r\ncountry. Sháh Shujá, its titular amír, so far from being in a condition\r\nto resist French invasion, had lost possession of Kábul and Kandahár,\r\nand was only anxious to obtain British aid against his elder brother\r\nMahmúd. Elphinstone, of course, had no authority to entangle the Company\r\nin a civil war far beyond the Indian frontier and was obliged to content\r\nhimself with a worthless treaty empowering Great Britain to defend\r\nAfghánistán against France. This treaty had scarcely been ratified when\r\nSháh Shujá himself was driven into exile, to play an ignoble part thirty\r\nyears later in the great tragedy of the first Afghán war.\r\n\r\nHowever pacific Minto's policy was, he did not shut his eyes to the\r\nnecessity of guarding the coasts and commerce of India against the enemy\r\nwho still dominated Europe, and had not wholly abandoned his visions of\r\neastern conquest. We have seen already that the \"half way\" naval station\r\nat the Cape of Good Hope had been retaken from the Dutch in 1806, the\r\nyear in which the Berlin decree was issued. In 1810 the French were\r\nexpelled from Java by an expedition despatched under Minto's orders,\r\nthough it was soon to be restored to Holland. In the same year the\r\nislands of Mauritius and Bourbon were captured from the French and the\r\nsea route to India was finally secured. Lord Minto, who was recalled in\r\n1813 and raised to the dignity of an earl, left India after six years of\r\npeaceful government in a state of tranquillity such as it had never\r\nbefore enjoyed, and the settlement of the country under British\r\nsuzerainty appeared to have been assured. Yet the seeds of fresh trouble\r\nwere already working, and his successor was to prove himself a second\r\nWellesley, and add new territories of great extent to British India.\r\n\r\nLord Moira, better known by his later title as Marquis of Hastings,\r\ndisplayed qualities as governor-general of which his previous career had\r\ngiven no indication. He had already proved himself a good soldier, but\r\nhe was a court favourite as well as a somewhat impracticable politician,\r\nand owed his appointment to other influences than his own merit. His\r\narrival in India nearly coincided with the charter of 1813, which threw\r\nopen the India trade, and virtually ushered in a new social era. He was\r\nat once confronted with an empty treasury, on the one hand, and, on the\r\nother, with alarming reports both from the northern frontier and from\r\nthe central provinces, still under independent princes of doubtful\r\nfidelity. The earlier part of his nine years' residence in India was\r\nengrossed by most harassing operations against the Nepálís and the\r\nPindárís, but these operations resulted in perfect success, and Hastings\r\nwas able to show before he left India that he was eminent alike in civil\r\nand in military administration.\r\n\r\nThe mountainous region of Nepál, lying on the slopes of the Himálayas\r\nnorth of Bengal and Oudh, had been occupied by the warlike nation, still\r\nknown as the Gúrkhas, whose capital was at Khátmándu. Like the Maráthás,\r\nthey had been in the habit of pillaging British territory as well as\r\nOudh, and when part of Oudh was annexed by Wellesley, frontier disputes\r\nwere added to former grounds of hostility. Minto remonstrated with them\r\nsharply but in vain, and Moira lost no time in declaring war against\r\nthem. The first campaign of 1814, which followed, though skilfully\r\nconceived by Moira, who held the office of commander-in-chief, was\r\ncarried out with little generalship, and was marked by disasters highly\r\ndamaging to British prestige. Three out of four armies launched against\r\nthe hill-tribes met with serious reverses, chiefly due to a contempt for\r\nthe enemy, and a persistence in making frontal assaults on strong\r\npositions without practicable breaches, which have proved so fatal in\r\nmany a later conflict between British troops and undisciplined foes.\r\nDuring the cold season, however, on the extreme north-west, the cautious\r\nbut irresistible advance of General Ochterlony penetrated the hill\r\nranges which had baffled all the other commanders, and retrieved the\r\nfortunes of the war. The Gúrkhas were far, indeed, from being subdued,\r\nbut Ochterlony's success among their strongest fastnesses, aided by\r\nthat of Colonels Gardner and Nicholls in the district of Kumáun,\r\ninduced them to sue for peace, and offer territorial cessions. The loss\r\nof the Tarái, or belt of forest interspersed with pastures at the foot\r\nof the Himálayas, was the most onerous of the conditions imposed upon\r\nthem by the treaty of Almora, signed in 1815. Rather than submit to it,\r\nthe Gúrkha chiefs refused to ratify the treaty, and resumed their arms.\r\nAfter two defeats, however, in February, 1816, they abandoned further\r\nresistance, and Moira afterwards wisely consented to a modification of\r\nthe frontier-line. Retaining but a remnant of their dominions in the\r\nlowlands, the Gúrkhas have ever since preserved their independence with\r\ntheir military training in the highlands, and have contributed some of\r\nthe best fighting material to the British army in India.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE PINDÁRÍS._]\r\n\r\nWhile the war in Nepál was still undecided, fresh troubles broke out in\r\nCentral India, where Wellesley's settlement had left no permanent\r\nsecurity for peace. The very submission of the great Maráthá powers had\r\nset free large bands of irregular troops, with no livelihood but\r\npillage, and ever ready, like the Italian _condottieri_ of the later\r\nmiddle ages, to enlist in the service of any aggressive state. These\r\nmounted freebooters, now called the Pindárís, were secretly encouraged\r\nby the Maráthá chiefs, who looked upon them as useful auxiliaries in the\r\nfuture, either against the government of India or against other native\r\nprinces. Several of these still remained in a more or less dependent but\r\nrestless condition, and the great leaders of the Maráthá confederacy,\r\nSindhia, Malhár Ráo Holkar, son and successor of Jaswant Ráo, the\r\nPeshwá, and the Rájá of Nágpur, retained a large share of their former\r\nsovereignty. Of these subject-allies, the one most directly under\r\nBritish guidance and protection was the Peshwá, but even he took\r\nadvantage of hostile movements among his neighbours to join in a\r\ncombination against British rule, supported by the predatory raids of\r\nthe Pindárís. He had long been discontented with the subordinate\r\nposition which he had occupied since the treaty of Bassein. The\r\nassassination in 1815 of an envoy of the Gáekwár of Baroda, who had been\r\nsent to Poona on a special mission under British guarantees, nearly\r\nprovoked hostilities. But in June, 1817, a treaty was concluded, by\r\nwhich the Peshwá accepted an increased subsidiary force, ceded part of\r\nhis territory, renounced his suzerainty over the Gáekwár and undertook\r\nto submit all further disputes to the decision of the British\r\ngovernment. In November, however, chafing under the restrictions imposed\r\nby this treaty, he broke out into hostility, burnt the British\r\nresidency, and after vainly attacking the British troops, fled from\r\nPoona. Almost simultaneously Holkar and the Rájá of Nágpur rose. Holkar\r\nwas defeated in a pitched battle at Mehidpur in Málwá, while the sepoys\r\nsuccessfully held their own against the Rájá's troops at Nágpur. The\r\nfugitive Peshwá was energetically pursued, and captured, and was\r\nstripped of his dominions. The greater part of these was annexed by the\r\nEast India Company, but a portion was reserved for the heir of the old\r\nMaráthá kings who was established at Sátára. The Rájá of Nágpur was also\r\ncompelled to cede a large portion of his dominions, and at the same time\r\nthe Company acquired the overlordship of Rájputána. Henceforth, the\r\nBritish government claimed a control over all the foreign relations of\r\nnative Indian states, whose internal government was to be carefully\r\nwatched by a British resident, and whose military forces were to be\r\npractically under the supreme command of the paramount power.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE END OF THE PINDÁRÍS._]\r\n\r\nLord Moira, created Marquis of Hastings in 1816, was at last free to\r\nhunt down the Pindárís, with the sullen acquiescence of the Maráthá\r\ngovernments, and he executed his task with extraordinary vigour. He\r\nwould have undertaken it, at the instigation of Metcalfe, then resident\r\nat Delhi, a year earlier, but for the peremptory orders of Canning, at\r\nthat time president of the board of control, who positively forbade him\r\nto embark on a new war. These orders were greatly relaxed after the\r\nbloodthirsty raid of Chítu, the famous Pindárí leader, who in 1816\r\ndesolated vast tracts of Central India. Still no effective action\r\nagainst the Pindárís was possible until the Maráthá lords who harboured\r\nand encouraged them had been crippled and overawed. With their\r\nconnivance, a second Pindárí raid, accompanied by shocking cruelties,\r\nwas made in the same year, but in 1817, when Holkar's followers were\r\nseverely defeated at Mehidpur, the secret coalition between these\r\nbandits and our nominal allies was thoroughly broken up. Even then it\r\nproved a most difficult enterprise to root out the Pindárís, who were\r\nnot a race, or a tribe, or a sect, but bands of lawless men of all\r\nfaiths; for they met and vanished like birds of the air, outstripping\r\nregular cavalry by the length and rapidity of their marches, and\r\ncarrying off their booty almost under the eyes of their pursuers. But\r\nthe resolute tactics of Hastings prevailed in the end. Amír Khán, their\r\nmost powerful leader, disbanded his troops; and hemmed in on all sides,\r\ncut off from every place of shelter, and chased by successive\r\ndetachments of horsemen almost as fleet as his own, Chítu became a\r\nhopeless fugitive, with a handful of faithful adherents, who shared his\r\ndesperate efforts to escape, but advised him to surrender. He could not\r\nbring himself to do so, possessed, it is said, with an unspeakable\r\nhorror of being transported across \"the black sea,\" and he actually\r\nremained at large or in hiding for a year after his lair was discovered.\r\nNor was he ever captured, for, by a strange fate, this ruthless scourge\r\nof the Deccan, after baffling human vengeance, found his last refuge in\r\na jungle and died, a tiger's prey. By this time, all the wild bands\r\nwhich sprung into existence out of the Maráthá war had been extirpated\r\nor dispersed, and after the year 1818 the dreaded name of Pindárí was\r\nheard no more in history.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of civil war and anarchy in Central India, which\r\ncompleted the work of Wellesley, was the greatest achievement of\r\nHastings. One remarkable incident of it was a portentous outbreak of\r\ncholera in 1817, during a campaign in Gwalior conducted by Hastings in\r\nperson. There had been several minor visitations of this disease in\r\nIndia. But it now first established itself as an endemic disease, and it\r\nhas ever since infested the valley of the Ganges. So virulent was its\r\nonslaught, and so fearful the mortality in Hastings' army, that it was\r\nonly saved by shifting its quarters, and the governor-general himself\r\nmade preparations for his own secret burial, in case he should be among\r\nthe victims. As we have seen already,[140] it was propagated from this\r\ncentre through other regions of Asia, until it spread to Western Europe,\r\nand the \"Asiatic cholera\" of 1831-32 may be lineally traced back to the\r\nlast Maráthá war.\r\n\r\nThe position of Hastings in Indian history closely resembles that of\r\nWellesley. Disregarding the instructions of the board of control, as\r\nwell as of the board of directors, he forced upon them, like Wellesley,\r\na large extension of their empire. But it cannot be doubted that his\r\npolicy, dictated by exigencies beyond the ken of authorities sitting in\r\nLondon, was eminently successful and beneficent in its results. It went\r\nfar to establish a \"Pax Britannica\" in the Indian Peninsula, and, if it\r\ntook little account of dynastic rights, it broke the rod of oppression,\r\nand relieved millions upon millions from tyranny and intimidation which\r\novershadowed their whole lives. He retired in 1823, after seven years'\r\ntenure of office, and died in 1826 as governor of Malta. Canning had\r\nbeen designated as his successor, and, having accepted the post, was on\r\nthe eve of starting for Calcutta, when the tragical death of Castlereagh\r\nrecalled him to the foreign office, and opened to him the most brilliant\r\nstage in his career. Thereupon Lord Amherst was appointed\r\ngovernor-general, with every prospect of a pacific vice-royalty, whereas\r\nit is now chiefly remembered for the annexation of new provinces on the\r\nsouth-east of Bengal, and the capture of Bhartpur.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE FIRST BURMESE WAR._]\r\n\r\nThe first Burmese war arose out of persistent aggressions by the new\r\nkingdom of Ava or Burma on what is now the British province of Assam,\r\nbut was then an independent, though feeble, state. There had been\r\nearlier frontier disputes between the Indian government and Burma about\r\nthe districts lying eastward of Chittagong along the Bay of Bengal, but\r\nit was not until Burma conquered Arakan, invaded Assam, and occupied\r\npasses on the north-east overlooking the plains of Bengal, that serious\r\naction was felt to be necessary. Indeed, while Hastings was engaged with\r\nthe war in Nepál and the suppression of the Pindárís, even he was in no\r\nmood to embark on a fresh campaign beyond the borders of India. The\r\nincursions of the Burmese, however, became more and more threatening\r\nboth on the coast line and on the mountains above the Brahmaputra river,\r\nand in February, 1824, Amherst resolved to check the extension of their\r\ndominion. Notwithstanding the experience recently gained in Nepál, the\r\nfirst operations of the Anglo-Indian troops were conducted with little\r\nknowledge of the country, and met with very doubtful success. Rangoon\r\nwas easily captured, but the expedition was disabled from advancing up\r\nthe river Irawadi by the want of adequate supplies and the deadliness of\r\nthe climate. Part of the Tenasserim coast was subdued, but a British\r\nforce was defeated in Arakan. These reverses were retrieved in the\r\nfollowing year, 1825, when one army under Sir Archibald Campbell made\r\nits way up the river to Prome, while another army conquered Arakan, and\r\na third, moving along the valley of the Brahmaputra, established itself\r\nin Assam. The Burmese now abandoned further resistance. Assam, Arakan,\r\nand the Tenasserim provinces were ceded to the company, whose\r\nprotectorate was also recognised over other territories upon the course\r\nof the Brahmaputra. It was not until February, 1826, that the King of\r\nAva could be induced to sign the treaty embodying these cessions, and\r\nmany years were to elapse before the port of Rangoon was opened to\r\nBritish commerce.\r\n\r\nThe strong fortress of Bhartpur, in the east of Rájputána, and near to\r\nAgra, had acquired an unique importance, in the eyes of all India by its\r\nsuccessful resistance to Lake's assaults during the Maráthá war of 1805.\r\nIt was still held until 1825 by its own petty rájá, the son of Ranjít\r\nSingh, who remained on terms of respectful amity with the Indian\r\ngovernment, though his little principality was a notorious focus of\r\nnative disaffection. In that year he died, and his child, after being\r\nacknowledged by the Indian government as his successor, was forcibly\r\nousted by a usurper. Sir David Ochterlony, the hero of the Nepálese war,\r\nthen resident in Málwá and Rájputána, undertook to support the\r\nlegitimate heir, but was overruled by orders from Amherst. On his\r\nresignation he was succeeded by Metcalfe, who had become Sir Charles\r\nMetcalfe by his brother's death in 1822, and who now obtained authority\r\nto carry out Ochterlony's policy, if necessary, by armed intervention.\r\nAs negotiation failed, Lord Combermere, as commander-in-chief, proceeded\r\nto reduce the virgin fortress, not by the slow process of siege, but by\r\na well-organised assault. Having cut off the water supply, and mined the\r\nmud walls, he poured in a storming party and overpowered the garrison.\r\nThe feat was probably not so great, from a military point of view, as\r\nmany that have left no record, but its effect on the superstitious\r\nnative mind was prodigious, especially as it nearly coincided with the\r\nvictorious issue of the Burmese war. Nevertheless, Amherst was shortly\r\nafterwards recalled, and left India in 1828. His annexation of Burmese\r\nterritory and the increase of expenditure under his rule displeased both\r\nthe Company and the home government, so often foiled in the attempt to\r\nenforce a pacific and economical policy. His successor was Lord William\r\nBentinck, who had been compelled to retire from the governorship of\r\nMadras after the mutiny of Vellore.\r\n\r\nLike Hastings, Bentinck showed a firmness and wisdom in his Indian\r\nadministration strongly contrasting with the restless self-assertion of\r\nhis earlier career. His lot was cast in an interval of tranquillity\r\nafter a long period of warfare, and his name is associated with internal\r\nreforms and social progress in India, not unconnected with a like\r\nmovement in England. The measure upon which his fame chiefly rests was\r\nthe abolition of \"satí,\" that is, the practice of Hindoo widows\r\nsacrificing themselves by being burned alive on the funeral pile of\r\ntheir husbands. This practice, which specially prevailed in Bengal, has\r\nbeen explained by a false interpretation of certain texts in sacred\r\nbooks of the Hindus, by the selfish eagerness of the husband's family to\r\nmonopolise all his property, and by the utterly desolate condition of a\r\nchildless widow in native communities. At all events, it was deeply\r\nrooted in Hindu traditions, and no previous governor had dared to go\r\nbeyond issuing regulations to secure that the widow should be a willing\r\nvictim. Bentinck had the courage to act on the conviction that\r\ninhumanity, however consecrated by superstition and priestcraft, has no\r\npermanent basis in popular sentiment. With the consent of his council,\r\nhe prohibited \"satí\" absolutely, declaring that all who took any part in\r\nit should be held guilty of culpable homicide; and the native population\r\nacquiesced in its suppression.\r\n\r\nBut this was only one of Bentinck's reforms. Armed with peremptory\r\ninstructions from the home government, he effected large retrenchments\r\nin the growing expenditure of the Indian services, both civil and\r\nmilitary, and a considerable increase in the Indian revenue. It may be\r\ndoubted whether one of these retrenchments, involving a strict revision\r\nof officers' allowances known as \"batta,\" was considerable enough to be\r\nworth the almost mutinous discontent which it provoked. Another,\r\naffecting the salaries of civilians, was aggravated, in their eyes, by\r\nthe admission of natives to \"primary jurisdiction,\" in other words, by\r\nenabling native judges to sit in courts of first instance. This\r\nimportant change had been gradually introduced before the arrival of\r\nBentinck, but it was he who most boldly adopted the idea of governing\r\nIndia in the interest and by the agency of the natives. On the other\r\nhand, it was he who, supported by Macaulay's famous minute, but contrary\r\nto official opinion in Leadenhall Street, issued the ordinance\r\nconstituting English the official language of India. In a like spirit,\r\nhe promoted the work of native education, partly for the purpose of\r\ndeveloping the political and judicial capacity of the higher orders\r\namong the Hindus, but partly also for the purpose of making the English\r\nlanguage and literature the instrument of their elevation. He earnestly\r\ndesired to raise the standard of Indian civilisation, but he equally\r\ndesired to fashion it in an English mould.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _THE EXTIRPATION OF \"THAGÍ\"._]\r\n\r\nUnder the rule of Bentinck, the revenue was largely augmented by a\r\nreassessment of land in the north-western provinces, where an increasing\r\nnumber of zamíndárs had fraudulently evaded the payment of rent, and by\r\nthe imposition of licence-duties on the growers of opium in Málwá, who\r\nhad carried on a profitable but illicit trade through foreign ports. But\r\nthe social benefit of the people was ever his first concern, and not the\r\nleast of his claims to their gratitude was the final extirpation of\r\n\"thagí\". This institution was a secret association of highway robbers\r\nand murderers who had plagued Central India almost as widely as the\r\nroving troops of Pindárís. Their victims were travellers whom they\r\ndecoyed into their haunts, plundered, strangled, and buried on the spot.\r\nFor years they carried on their infamous trade with impunity, and no\r\nmember of the conspiracy had turned informer. At last, however, a clue\r\nwas found by a skilful and resolute agent of the government, and the\r\nspell of mutual dread which held together the murderous confederacy was\r\neffectually broken in India. Meanwhile, the same period of peaceful\r\ndevelopment witnessed the execution of important public works, the\r\nrelaxation of restrictions on the liberty of the press, and a general\r\nadvance towards a more paternal despotism, coincident with the progress\r\nof liberal ideas at home. These benign influences were favoured by the\r\ncontinuance of peace and the maintenance of non-intervention, disturbed\r\nonly by the minor annexations of Cachar and Coorg, to which may be added\r\nthe assumption of direct control over Mysore.\r\n\r\nWhen the charter of 1833 transformed the \"company of British merchants\r\ntrading to the east\" into the \"East India Company,\" with administrative\r\npowers only, Bentinck was in failing health, and he soon afterwards\r\nreturned home. On his resignation in 1835, Metcalfe became provisional\r\ngovernor-general, but his liberal policy displeased the court of\r\ndirectors, and Lord Heytesbury was selected by the short-lived\r\ngovernment of Peel as Bentinck's successor. Palmerston, however, on\r\nresuming the foreign office, was believed to have used his influence to\r\nset aside this nomination, and to procure the appointment of Lord\r\nAuckland, then first lord of the admiralty. The supposed objection to\r\nHeytesbury was his known sympathy with Russia, at a moment when distrust\r\nof Russia's designs on the north-west frontier was about to become the\r\nkeynote of Anglo-Indian statesmanship. During the interregnum between\r\nBentinck's retirement and Auckland's accession, three more remedial\r\nmeasures were carried into effect, the wisdom of which is not even yet\r\nbeyond dispute. These were the complete liberation of the Indian press,\r\nthe abolition of the exclusive privilege whereby British residents could\r\nappeal in civil suits to the supreme court at Calcutta, and the definite\r\nintroduction of English text-books into schools for the people. For all\r\nthese reforms Macaulay was largely responsible, but the impulse had been\r\ngiven by Bentinck, and was accelerated by Metcalfe.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1835-37 domestic affairs occupied much less space in\r\nthe counsels of Indian statesmen than schemes for counteracting the\r\ngrowth of Russian influence at Tihran, and securing the predominance of\r\nBritish influence in Afghánistán. For a time their anxiety was\r\nconcentrated on Herat, which the Sháh of Persia was besieging, with the\r\nintention of penetrating into the heart of Afghán territory, while the\r\nAfghán rulers themselves were suspected of secretly conspiring with\r\nPersia against our ally, Ranjít Singh. Since Persia, having again lost\r\nfaith in British support, was drifting more and more into reliance on\r\nRussia, this forward movement was regarded as the first step of the\r\nRussian advance-guard towards India. The fate of India was felt to\r\ndepend on the defence of Herat under Pottinger, a young British officer,\r\nwho volunteered his services without instructions from home. The siege,\r\nconducted under Russian officers, lasted ten months, and its ultimate\r\nfailure was hailed as a triumph of British policy, for Herat was\r\nrecognised, since the days of Alexander the Great, as the western gate\r\nof India.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _COMMUNICATION WITH INDIA._]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the question of a shorter route to India attracted\r\nmuch attention both in Russia and in England. The first project was\r\nthat, ultimately adopted, of a sea passage by Malta to Alexandria, a\r\nland transit across Egypt to Suez, and a second voyage by the Red Sea to\r\nIndian ports. The alternative line was more properly described as an\r\n\"overland route,\" since it was proposed to make the journey from some\r\nport in the eastern Levant across Syria and by the Euphrates to the\r\nPersian Gulf. Colonel Chesney was sent out in 1835 as the pioneer of an\r\nexpedition by this route, and parliament twice voted money for its\r\ndevelopment, but it was vigorously opposed by Russia, and abandoned as\r\nimpracticable owing to physical difficulties in navigating the\r\nEuphrates, then considered as a necessary channel of communication with\r\nthe sea. The scheme has since been revived on a much grander scale in\r\nthe form of a projected railway traversing Asia Minor to Baghdad, and\r\nrunning down the valley of the Tigris. In the meantime, the Red Sea\r\nroute, at first discredited, has far more than justified the hopes of\r\nits promoters. With the aid of steam-vessels, since 1845, and of the\r\nSuez Canal, since 1869, it has reduced the journey to India from a\r\nperiod of four months to one of three weeks, and profoundly affected its\r\nrelations with Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIt would be well if the premature, but not unfounded, fear of Russian\r\ninvasion had produced no further effects on Anglo-Indian policy.\r\nUnhappily, those who justly perceived the importance of Afghánistán, as\r\nlying between Persia and the Punjab, were possessed with the delusion\r\nthat it would prove a more solid buffer as a British dependency than as\r\nan independent state. In their ignorance of its internal condition and\r\nthe sentiments of its unruly tribes, the Indian government despatched\r\nSir Alexander Burnes to Kábul, nominally as a commercial emissary, but\r\nnot without ulterior objects. They could not have chosen a more capable\r\nagent, for he added to a knowledge of several languages a minute\r\ngeographical acquaintance with Central Asia and an insight into the\r\ncharacter of its inhabitants which probably no other Englishman\r\npossessed. He was to proceed by way of Sind to Pesháwar, and in passing\r\nthrough Sind he received news of the siege of Herat, the significance\r\nof which he was not slow to appreciate. Thenceforward his mission\r\ninevitably assumed a political complexion, since the future of\r\nAfghánistán became a practical question. His rash negotiations with Dost\r\nMuhammad, the Amír of Kábul, and his brother at Kandahár, his return to\r\nIndia, his second mission to Afghánistán in support of a policy which he\r\nhad deprecated, and his tragical death in the Kábul insurrection,--these\r\nare events which belong to a later chapter of history. But, though\r\nBurnes cannot be held responsible for the first Afghán war, there can be\r\nno doubt that his travels in disguise through Central Asia, and\r\nconfidential reports on the border countries between the Russian and\r\nBritish spheres of influence, were the immediate prelude to a campaign\r\nthe most ill-advised and the most disastrous ever organised by the\r\nIndian government and sanctioned by that of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[138] Despatch of July 13, 1804, _Selection from Wellesley's\r\nDespatches_, ed.

To some, the\r\nboundary line between the society of the eighteenth and that of the\r\nnineteenth century appears to be marked by the outbreak of the French\r\nrevolution, and the far-reaching effects of that catastrophe upon ideas,\r\nmanners, and politics in Great Britain, as well as upon the continent,\r\nare too evident to be denied. But it is equally certain that, before the\r\nFrench revolution, an intellectual and industrial movement was in\r\nprogress which must have given a most powerful impulse to civilisation,\r\neven if the French revolution had never taken place. In this country,\r\nespecially, the great writers, philanthropists, scientific leaders,\r\ninventors, engineers, and reformers of various types, who adorned the\r\nlatter part of George III.'s reign, largely drew their inspiration from\r\nan age, just preceding the French revolution, which is sometimes\r\nregarded as barren in originality.\r\n\r\nWhen the nineteenth century opened, the classical authors of that\r\npre-revolutionary age had mostly passed away. Hume died in 1776, Johnson\r\nin 1784, Adam Smith in 1790, Gibbon in 1794, Burns in 1796, Burke in\r\n1797, Cowper in 1800. John Howard, the great pioneer of prison reform,\r\nbecame a martyr to philanthropy in 1790. The most remarkable of those\r\nmanufacturing improvements and mechanical inventions upon which the\r\ncommercial supremacy of England is founded date from the same period,\r\nand have been described in a previous volume. Steam navigation was still\r\nuntried, but preliminary experiments had already been made on both sides\r\nof the Atlantic before 1789. The application of steam to locomotion by\r\nland had scarcely been conceived, but the facilities of traffic and\r\ntravelling had been vastly developed in the first forty years of George\r\nIII.'s reign.\r\n\r\nIt may truly be said, however, that English literature in the early\r\nparty of the nineteenth century bears clear traces of the influence\r\nexercised on receptive minds by the French revolution. Three of the\r\nleading poets, Coleridge, Wordsworth, and Southey, were deeply infected\r\nby its spirit, and indulged in their youth fantastic dreams of a social\r\nmillennium; Wordsworth, especially, who in his maturer years could be\r\njustly described as the priest of nature-worship and the poet of rural\r\nlife, had imbibed violent republican ideas during a residence of more\r\nthan a year in France. These were passing off in 1798, when he\r\npublished, jointly with Coleridge, the volume of _Lyrical Ballads_\r\ncontaining the latter's immortal tale of the _Ancient Mariner_. In the\r\nfollowing year he settled in the English lake-country, where Coleridge\r\nestablished himself for a while, and Southey for life. Hence the popular\r\nbut very inaccurate title of the \"Lake School,\" applied to a trio of\r\npoets who, except as friends, had little in common with each other.\r\nIndeed, after Wordsworth had developed his theory of poetical realism in\r\nthe preface to a volume published in 1800, Coleridge rejected and\r\ncriticised it as wholly untenable. All three, however, may be considered\r\nas comrades in a revolt against the conventional diction of eighteenth\r\ncentury poetry, from which Coleridge's \"dreamy tenderness\" and mystical\r\nflights of fancy were as remote as Wordsworth's rusticity and almost\r\nprosaic studies of humble life.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _COLERIDGE AND SCOTT._]\r\n\r\nAlthough Coleridge survived to 1834 and Wordsworth to 1850, both seem to\r\nhave lost at an early date that power of imagination, whether displayed\r\nin sympathy or in creation, in which their greatness consisted.\r\nWordsworth wrote assiduously during the whole of this period; in 1807 he\r\npublished a volume of poems, including the famous _Ode on the\r\nIntimations of Immortality_ and several of his finest sonnets; but of\r\nhis later work only an occasional lyric deserves to be ranked beside the\r\npoems published in 1800 and 1807. Coleridge, indeed, published two of\r\nhis finest poems, _Christabel_ and _Kubla Khan_, in 1816, but they were\r\nwritten long before, _Christabel_, partly in 1797 and partly in 1801,\r\nand _Kubla Khan_ in 1798. Even the new metre of _Christabel_, which is\r\nnot the least of Coleridge's contributions to English poetry, had, as\r\nearly as 1805, been borrowed in the _Lay of the Last Minstrel_ by Scott,\r\nto whom Coleridge had recited the poem. Nevertheless, Coleridge\r\ncontinued to exercise a great influence, partly through the charm of his\r\nconversation and partly through his prose works, in which he introduced\r\nto a British public, as yet unused to German literature, a vision of\r\nthat mystical German thought which finds its father in Kant, and was\r\nrepresented at that day by Hegel in philosophy and Goethe in poetry. It\r\nis uncertain how far the general ignorance of German literature in\r\nEngland was responsible for the influence exercised in their own day by\r\nthe few English or Scottish thinkers, such as Coleridge, Hamilton, and\r\nCarlyle, who had either fallen under the spell or learned the secret of\r\nthe German mystics. The most important of Coleridge's prose works was\r\n_Aids to Reflection_, which appeared in 1828, and whatever be its\r\nliterary value, it deserves the notice of the historian, as the least\r\nunsystematic treatise of an author who gave the principal philosophical\r\nimpetus to the Oxford movement.\r\n\r\nTwo other poets, eminently the product of their age, though not the\r\noffspring of the French revolution, Scott and Byron, were equally in\r\nrevolt against conventional diction. Scott elevated ballad-poetry to a\r\nlevel which it had never before attained, and composed some of the most\r\nbeautiful songs in the English language. If it be remembered that he was\r\ncramped by the drudgery of legal offices during the best years of his\r\nlife, that he was nearly thirty when he made his first literary venture,\r\nthat he was crippled by financial ruin and broken health during his\r\nlater years, that his anonymous contributions to periodicals would fill\r\nvolumes, and that he died at the age of sixty-one, his fertility of\r\nproduction must ever be ranked as unique in the history of English\r\nliterature. Already known as the author of various lyrical pieces, and\r\nthe _Border Minstrelsy_, he published the _Lay of the Last Minstrel_ in\r\n1805, _Marmion_ (with its fine stanzas on Pitt and Fox) in 1808, the\r\n_Lady of the Lake_ in 1809, _Don Roderick_ in 1811, and _Rokeby_ in\r\n1813, as well as minor poems of high merit. He is said to have abandoned\r\npoetry in deference to Byron's rising star, and it is certain that he\r\nnow fills a higher place in the roll of English classics as a prose\r\nwriter than as a poet. His first novel, _Waverley_, appeared in 1814,\r\nand was followed In the next four years by six of the greatest \"Waverley\r\nNovels,\" as the series came to be called--_Guy Mannering_, the\r\n_Antiquary_, the _Black Dwarf_, _Old Mortality_, _Rob Roy_, and the\r\n_Heart of Midlothian_. It is not too much to say that by these works,\r\nboth in poetry and in prose, he created the historical romance in Great\r\nBritain. The legends of chivalry and the folk-lore of his native land\r\nhad deeply stirred his soul, and fired his imagination from childhood,\r\nand though later \"research\" has far outstripped the range of his\r\nantiquarian knowledge, no modern writer has ever done so much to awaken\r\na reverence for olden times in the hearts of his countrymen. The easy\r\nflow of his style, the vivid energy of his thought, the graphic power of\r\nhis descriptions, his shrewd and robust sympathy with human nature, and\r\nthe evident simplicity of his own character, not unmingled with flashes\r\nof true poetical insight, justly rendered him the most popular writer of\r\nhis time.\r\n\r\nByron was born in 1788, and first sprang into notice as the author of\r\n_English Bards and Scotch Reviewers_, a fierce and bitter reply to\r\ncritics who had disparaged his first essay in poetry. This satire\r\nappeared in 1809, when he was just of age, after which he travelled with\r\nHobhouse, and it was not until 1812 that he \"woke to find himself\r\nfamous,\" on publishing the first two cantos of _Childe Harold_. During\r\nthe next three years, he poured forth a succession of characteristic\r\npoems, including the _Giaour_, the _Bride of Abydos_, the _Corsair_,\r\n_Lara_, and the _Siege of Corinth_. His later work was of a more\r\nfinished order, including the remaining cantos of _Childe Harold_,\r\n_Manfred_, _Cain_, and _Mazeppa_, and when he died at Mesolongi in 1824,\r\nhe left unfinished what is, in some ways, the most remarkable of his\r\nworks, _Don Juan_. Long before his death he had become the prophet and\r\nhero of a pseudo-romantic school, composed of young Englishmen dazzled\r\nby his intellectual brilliancy, and attracted rather than repelled by a\r\ncertain Satanic taint in his moral sentiments. But he also won the\r\nadmiration of Goethe, and the reaction against his fame in a later\r\ngeneration is as exaggerated as the idolatry of which he was the object\r\nunder the regency. His morbid egotism, his stormy rhetoric, and his\r\nmeretricious exaltation of passion, have lost their magical effect, but\r\nhis poetical gifts would have commanded homage in any age. The message\r\nwhich he professed to deliver was a false message, but few poets have\r\nsurpassed him in daring vigour of imagination, in descriptive force, in\r\nwit, or in pathos. His style was eminently such as to invite imitation,\r\nyet no one has successfully imitated him. Had he been a better man, and\r\nhad his life been prolonged, he might perhaps have towered above his\r\nliterary contemporaries as Napoleon did among the generals and rulers of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _KEATS, SHELLEY, TENNYSON._]\r\n\r\nYet among these contemporaries were Keats and Shelley, whom some critics\r\nof a younger generation would place above him in poetical originality.\r\nTheir chief merit lay neither in thought nor in strength, but in an\r\nexquisite sweetness of expression, which in the case of Shelley at least\r\nwas quite independent of the subject-matter. Keats, though junior to\r\nShelley, has been described as his poetical father, but his chief poem,\r\n_Endymion_, did not appear until several years after Shelley had formed\r\nhis own distinctive style. He died in 1821 at the age of twenty-six,\r\nleaving a poetical inheritance of the highest quality, which, though\r\nlimited in quantity and unequal in workmanship, has gained an enduring\r\nreputation. Nevertheless his work lent itself readily to imitation, and\r\nhe exercised a marked influence on the style of later poets, not only in\r\nthis period, but in the Victorian age as well. The rebellious spirit of\r\nShelley had already shown itself at an early age in his poetry, and\r\nespecially in _Queen Mab_, printed in 1812. His ethereal fancy, his\r\ndreamy obscurity, and his witchery of language, designated him from the\r\nfirst as a master of lyrical poetry; though he wrote longer pieces, his\r\nfame rests on the numerous short poems which continued to appear till\r\nhis death in 1822.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest master of melody was one who was only coming to the\r\nfront at the close of this period, Alfred Tennyson, born in 1809,\r\ncontributed with two of his brothers to a collection of verses,\r\nmisleadingly entitled _Poems by Two Brothers_, which appeared in 1826.\r\nAt Cambridge his _Timbuctoo_ won the chancellor's prize, but the first\r\nproof of his powers was given by a volume of short poems published in\r\n1830, followed by a similar volume two years later. By far the greater\r\npart of his work lies in the next period, but the volume of 1833 already\r\nincluded some of his best known poems.\r\n\r\nAmong minor poets of this period the highest rank must perhaps be\r\nassigned to Thomas Campbell and Thomas Moore as authors of some of the\r\nmost stirring and graceful lyrics in the English language. The former\r\nhad attained celebrity by the _Pleasures of Hope_, published before the\r\nend of the eighteenth century, but his choicest poems, such as _Ye\r\nMariners of England_, the fine verses on Hohenlinden and Copenhagen, and\r\n_Gertrude of Wyoming_, appeared between 1802 and 1809. The series of\r\nMoore's Irish melodies, on which his poetical fame largely rests, was\r\nbegun in 1807, though not completed until long afterwards. They were\r\nfollowed by other lyrical pieces of great merit, and by a series of\r\nwitty and malicious lampoons, collected in 1813 into a volume called the\r\n_Twopenny Post Bag_. _Lalla Rookh_, his most ambitious effort, was not\r\npublished until 1817.\r\n\r\nTwo prose writers of the same epoch, Southey and Bentham, claim special\r\nnotice, though Southey may also be numbered among the poets. Having\r\nestablished himself close to Keswick in 1804, he prosecuted a literary\r\ncareer with the most untiring industry until his mental faculties at\r\nlast failed him some thirty-six years later. During this period he\r\nproduced above a hundred volumes in poetry and prose, besides numerous\r\nscattered articles and other papers. Most of these were of merely\r\nephemeral interest, but the _Life of Nelson_, published in 1813, may be\r\nsaid to have set a standard of simplicity, purity, and dignity in\r\nEnglish prose which has been of permanent value. Bentham's style, on the\r\ncontrary, was so wanting in beauty and perspicuity that one at least of\r\nhis chief works is best known to English readers in the admirable French\r\nparaphrase of his friend Dumont. This is his famous _Introduction to the\r\nPrinciples of Morals and Legislation_, in which the doctrines of the\r\nutilitarian philosophy are rigorously applied to jurisprudence and the\r\nregulation of human conduct. Several of his numerous treatises had been\r\nplanned, and others actually composed, before the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, but his practical influence, ultimately so great, first made\r\nitself felt in the early part of the nineteenth century. This influence\r\nmay be compared within the sphere of social reform to that of Adam Smith\r\nwithin the sphere of economy. Many amendments of the law, an improved\r\nsystem of prison discipline, and even the reform of the poor law, may\r\nbe directly traced to his counsels, and it was he who inspired the\r\nleading radicals when radicalism was not so much a destructive creed as\r\na protest against real and gross abuses.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _MALTHUS._]\r\n\r\nPerhaps, next to Bentham, no writer of this period influenced educated\r\nopinion so powerfully as Malthus, whose _Essay on Population_, first\r\npublished anonymously in 1798, attracted comparatively little attention\r\nuntil 1803, when it was republished in a maturer form. No work has ever\r\nbeen more persistently misrepresented. While he shows that population,\r\nif unchecked, will surely increase in a ratio far outstripping any\r\npossible increase in the means of subsistence, he also shows, by\r\nelaborate proofs, that it will inevitably be checked by vice and misery,\r\nwhether or not they are aided by moral restraint. Later experience has\r\ndone little to weaken his reasoning, but it has proved that \"moral\r\nrestraint\" (in the most general sense) operates more widely than he\r\nventured to expect, and that larger tracts of the earth's surface than\r\nhe recognised could be brought under profitable cultivation. With these\r\nmodifications, his theory holds the field, and the people of Great\r\nBritain only escape starvation by ever-growing importations of grain\r\nfrom countries whose production--for the present--exceeds their\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nSeveral other writers of eminence, such as Sheridan and Paley, who lived\r\nin the latter days of George III. are more properly to be regarded as\r\nsurvivors of eighteenth century literature. Horne Tooke was returned for\r\nOld Sarum in 1801, and enjoyed a reputation in society until his death\r\nin 1812, but his old-fashioned radicalism had long since been superseded\r\nby a newer creed. Dugald Stewart continued to lecture on moral\r\nphilosophy until 1809, and was fortunate in numbering among his pupils\r\nPalmerston, Lansdowne, and Russell. A younger student of philosophy was\r\nRichard Whately, who was born in 1787, and elected to a fellowship at\r\nOriel College, Oxford, in 1811. He soon began to play an active part in\r\nuniversity life, and, after being principal of St. Alban Hall, was\r\nremoved to the archbishopric of Dublin in 1831. Though not a great\r\nphilosopher, he was an acute logician, and his _Logic_, published in\r\n1826, entitled him to a high place among the thinkers of his generation.\r\nBut it was not merely as a teacher and writer that Whately promoted the\r\ncause of philosophy in Oxford. He was one of the leaders in that\r\norganisation of studies which made philosophy one of the principal\r\nstudies, if not the principal study, of the abler students in that\r\nuniversity, and gave elementary logic a place in the ordinary\r\n\"pass-man's\" curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe best work of Maria Edgeworth and Jane Austen appeared in the early\r\npart of the nineteenth century. Maria Edgeworth's novel, _Castle\r\nRackrent_, was published in 1800, and rapidly followed by other tales\r\ndescriptive of Irish life; four of Jane Austen's novels, _Sense and\r\nSensibility_, _Pride and Prejudice_, _Mansfield Park_, and _Emma_, were\r\npublished between 1811 and 1816, while _Northanger Abbey_ and\r\n_Persuasion_ appeared after her death in 1817. All her work displays a\r\npower of minute analysis of character shared by few, if any, of our\r\nother novelists. Both authors deserve gratitude not only for having\r\ninspired Scott with a new idea of novel-writing, but for having\r\nexercised a purifying influence on the moral tone of English romance.\r\n\r\nThe most typical feature of English literature in the earlier years of\r\nthe nineteenth century was the extraordinary development of the\r\nperiodical and newspaper press. The eighteenth century was the golden\r\nage of pamphlets. When the \"governing classes\" represented but a\r\nfraction of the population, mostly concentrated in London, the practical\r\neffect of such political appeals as those issued by Swift or Burke was\r\nincredibly great, and not to be measured by their limited circulation.\r\nThe rise of journalism as a power in politics may be roughly dated from\r\nthe notoriety of Wilkes' _North Briton_, and of the letters of \"Junius\"\r\nin the _Public Advertiser_. Thenceforward, newspapers, at first mere\r\nchronicles of passing events, inevitably grew to be organs of political\r\nopinion, and had now almost superseded pamphlets, as addressed to a far\r\nlarger circle of readers. Notwithstanding the heavy stamp duties, as\r\nwell as duties on paper and advertisements, six daily journals were\r\npublished in London, of which the _Times_ was already the greatest.\r\nCobbett's _Weekly Political Register_, commenced in 1802, was diffusing\r\nnew ideas among the middle classes, but it was not yet committed to\r\nradicalism, and did not win its way into cottages until its price was\r\ngreatly reduced in 1816. After Cobbett's death in 1835, it ceased to\r\nappear. Still the ice was broken, and, as the educated public recovered\r\nfrom the panic caused by the French revolution, the newspaper press\r\nbecame a potent and independent rival of parliament and the platform.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _EDINBURGH AND QUARTERLY REVIEWS._]\r\n\r\nBut the influence of the _Edinburgh_ and _Quarterly Reviews_ was perhaps\r\neven greater among readers of the highest intelligence. The first of\r\nthese was founded in 1802 by Jeffrey, Brougham, Horner, and Sydney\r\nSmith, but was supported at first by Scott and other able contributors.\r\nSo remarkable a body of writers must have commanded attention in any\r\nage, but at a time when the only periodicals were annuals and\r\nmiscellanies, the literary vigour and range of knowledge displayed by\r\nthe new review carried all before it. For several years it had an unique\r\nsuccess, but, as it identified itself more and more with the whig party,\r\nCanning, with the aid of Scott, determined to challenge its supremacy by\r\nestablishing a new review to be called the _Quarterly_. Scott was\r\nfinally estranged from the _Edinburgh_ by an article against the war of\r\nindependence in Spain, and the first number of the _Quarterly_ appeared\r\nin February, 1809, with three articles by him. It was published by John\r\nMurray, and edited by Gifford, on much the same lines as the\r\n_Edinburgh_, but with a strong tory bias, and with somewhat less of\r\nliterary brilliancy. _Blackwood's Magazine_ followed a few years later,\r\nand the almost classical dualism of the _Quarterly_ and _Edinburgh_ has\r\nlong since been invaded by a multitude of younger serials.\r\n\r\nAfter the loss of its early monopoly of talent, the _Edinburgh Review_\r\nstill retained Jeffrey and Sydney Smith, and it was abundantly\r\ncompensated for the loss of Scott by the acquisition in 1825 of the\r\nfluent pen of Macaulay. Born in 1800, the son of Zachary Macaulay, who\r\nlike many other philanthropists was on the tory side, he was early\r\nconverted to the whig party. He was well fitted to be a popular writer.\r\nHis thought, never deep, is always clear and vivid. None knew better how\r\nto seize a dramatic incident or a picturesque simile, or to strike the\r\nweak points in his adversary's armour. It has been said of him that he\r\nalways chose to storm a position by a cavalry charge, certainly the most\r\nimposing if not the most effective method. Many of his contributions to\r\nthe _Edinburgh Review_ were afterwards republished as _Essays_, and\r\nalready in those earlier essays which appeared before 1837, we can see\r\nhim assuming the _rôle_ of the historical champion of the whigs. Widely\r\nread and with a marvellous memory, he was generally accurate in his\r\nfacts, but his criticism of Gladstone applies with even greater force to\r\nhimself: \"There is no want of light, but a great want of what Bacon\r\nwould have called dry light. Whatever Mr. Gladstone sees is refracted\r\nand distorted by a false medium of passions and prejudices.\" The critic\r\nis sunk in the advocate, and even a good cause is spoiled by a too\r\nobvious reluctance to admit anything that comes from the other side.\r\nPerhaps his happiest, though far from his greatest, work is to be found\r\nin the stirring ballads of _Ivry_ and the _Armada_, the precursors of\r\nthe _Lays of Ancient Rome_. Deservedly popular and full of patriotic\r\nfire, the class of literature to which they belong renders questions of\r\nfairness or unfairness beside the point.\r\n\r\nAnother contributor to the _Edinburgh Review_, also famous as a\r\nhistorian, was Thomas Carlyle. He was born in 1795 at Ecclefechan in\r\nDumfriesshire, and wrote for Brewster's _Encyclopædia_ and the _London\r\nMagazine_ as well as the _Edinburgh_. In 1826 he married Jane Welsh, and\r\nin 1828 he retired from journalism to live humbly on her means. It was\r\nnow that he began to produce his best work. _Sartor Resartus_ appeared\r\nin 1833-34, and the _History of the French Revolution_ in 1837. Even in\r\nthe latter of these works he is as much a preacher as a historian.\r\nPerhaps no other writer of the age exercised a greater direct influence,\r\nand in his own country, which seems specially amenable to the preacher's\r\npowers, his message has been as effective in favour of broader views as\r\nthe disruption of the Church of Scotland in 1843 was in favour of the\r\nold orthodoxy. His teaching has its roots in a German soil, but it bears\r\nthe mark of his own strong personality. His style, with a wilful\r\nruggedness, displays the German taste for the humour of an incongruous\r\nhomeliness, where the subject seems to call for a more dignified\r\ntreatment. Perhaps this obvious falseness of expression only relieves\r\nthe weight of his stern earnestness of purpose and makes us the more\r\nready to join in his constant denunciation of everything hollow and\r\npretentious.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _LAMB._]\r\n\r\nTwo new magazines appeared in or about 1817, _Blackwood's_ and the\r\n_London_. Brilliant as the leading contributors to the former were, none\r\nof them perhaps can claim a place in the front rank of English\r\nliterature. Of the contributors to the _London_ Lamb is doubtless\r\nentitled to the first place. Born in 1775, he was employed as a clerk in\r\nthe East India House from 1792 to 1825. He was a schoolfellow of\r\nColeridge and contributed to his earlier volume of poems It is, however,\r\nto the _Essays of Elia_ that he owes his fame. These appeared in the\r\n_London Magazine_ and were published in a collected form after his death\r\nin 1834. Few authors that have been so much admired have exercised so\r\nlittle influence. The reason for this is not far to seek. His style\r\ndefies imitation, and he would have been the last man to endeavour to\r\nwin disciples to his opinions. Another essayist who belongs to the same\r\ngroup of writers as Coleridge and Lamb is Thomas de Quincey. He wrote\r\nboth for _Blackwood's_ and for the _London Magazine_, in the latter of\r\nwhich appeared in 1821 his best known work, the _Confessions of an\r\nEnglish Opium Eater_. He excelled in what was the dominant\r\ncharacteristic of English prose of this period, in imagery, a quality\r\nwhich is conspicuous in the light fancy of Coleridge's most famous\r\npoems, and which gives life to an author so uniformly in dead earnest as\r\nMacaulay. Viewed historically, this taste for imagery is the English\r\nside of the romantic movement, which in Germany reacted against the\r\nconventional, not only in works of the imagination, but in the heavier\r\nform of new philosophical systems. But these systems, in spite of\r\nColeridge, never became native in England. The growth of the scientific\r\nspirit has made such thought and such language seem unreal in serious\r\nliterature, and prevents a later generation from imitating, though not\r\nfrom admiring, the brilliance of the early essayists.\r\n\r\nHazlitt's genius was of a heavier type. As an essayist his work breathes\r\nthe spirit of an earlier age; but as a literary critic he is a leader,\r\nand displays an inwardness in his appreciation that makes him in a sense\r\nthe model of the new age in which criticism has so largely supplanted\r\ncreation. It may be doubted, however, whether the abnormal growth of\r\ncriticism, as a distinct branch of English letters, has been a benefit\r\non the whole to our literature. Certainly it has tended to substitute\r\nthe elaborate study of other men's thoughts for original production,\r\nand, after all, the greatest critics have been those who, being more\r\nthan critics, have shown themselves capable of constructive efforts.\r\n\r\nTwo statesmen-novelists, Bulwer and Disraeli, are among the most\r\ninteresting literary characters of the end of this period. The former of\r\nthese, like his French contemporary Victor Hugo, had a remarkable gift\r\nfor expressing each successive phase of popular taste. He resembled\r\nDisraeli in acquiring a pre-eminent position in letters in early youth,\r\nwhich was followed by political success at a later age. Though neither\r\nrose to cabinet rank before a time of life which must with literary men\r\nrank as \"middle age,\" Bulwer had, in the midst of an active\r\nparliamentary career, been an active novelist, in fact the most popular\r\nnovelist of his day. Disraeli, on the other hand, only entered\r\nparliament after the close of the period dealt with in this volume, and\r\nit is to this period, while he was still unknown to politics, that the\r\ngreater part of his literary work belongs. One other resemblance between\r\nthese writers is perhaps not less interesting to the historian than to\r\nthe critic. Both made use of literature to establish for themselves a\r\nreputation as \"men of the world,\" an ambition which Bulwer's social\r\nposition might easily justify, and without which it would be impossible\r\nto understand the career of Disraeli. Born in 1803 and 1804\r\nrespectively, both made their mark with their first novels in 1827,\r\nBulwer with _Falkland_, Disraeli with a work in which his own career has\r\nbeen supposed to be foreshadowed--_Vivian Grey_. One other great\r\nnovelist had appeared before the close of the reign of William IV. In\r\n1836 Charles Dickens produced _Sketches by Boz_ and began the _Pickwick\r\nPapers_, but he belongs properly to the next reign.\r\n\r\nAmong the historians of this period the first place undoubtedly belongs\r\nto Henry Hallam. Born in 1788, he produced his _View of the State of\r\nEurope during the Middle Ages_ in 1818, and his _Constitutional History\r\nof England_ in 1827, while his _Introduction to the Literature of\r\nEurope_ began to appear in 1837. Like Macaulay he represents the whig\r\nattitude towards politics, but does so less consciously and less\r\nemphatically than his younger contemporary. There is a sense in which no\r\nconstitutional historian has adopted so strictly legal an attitude. It\r\nis not merely that his interest centres on the legal side of the\r\nconstitution, but, lawyer-like, he judges every constitutional issue of\r\nthe past in the light of the legal system which the law of his own day\r\npresupposes for the date in question. No one can deny the validity of\r\nthis principle in a court of justice, but no one gifted either with\r\nhistorical imagination or with historical sympathy could wish to\r\nintroduce it into a historical work. Yet the very narrowness of his\r\noutlook made it easier for him to adopt the impartiality of a judge; his\r\ncriterion of justice is too definite to allow him to indulge in special\r\npleading or to twist facts to suit his theories; and the student still\r\nturns to Hallam with a sense of security which he does not feel in\r\nreading Macaulay or Carlyle.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _FINE ART._]\r\n\r\nThe fine arts cannot be said to have flourished in England during the\r\nperiod of the great war, and architecture was certainly at a low ebb,\r\nbut several eminent names belong to this period. Sir Thomas Lawrence was\r\nby far the foremost English portrait painter, and fitly represents the\r\nelegance of the regency, while Raeburn enjoyed an equal reputation in\r\nScotland. Turner, however, was painting in his earlier manner and\r\nshowing originality even in his imitations of old masters. Constable,\r\ntoo, was producing some of those quiet English landscapes which, though\r\nlittle appreciated at the time, have since made him famous. Two other\r\nEnglish landscape painters, Callcott and the elder Crome, were also in\r\ntheir prime, and Wilkie executed several of his best known masterpieces\r\nat this time. David Cox and Prout did not earn celebrity till a little\r\nlater. The Water-Colour Society was founded in 1804. Soon afterwards\r\nFlaxman was in the zenith of his fame, being elected professor of\r\nsculpture by the Royal Academy in 1810, and Chantrey was beginning to\r\ndesert portrait painting for statuary.\r\n\r\nScience, especially in its practical applications, made greater strides\r\nthan art in the early years of the nineteenth century. It was now that\r\nJenner's memorable discovery of vaccination, dating from 1796, was\r\ngenerally adopted by the medical profession. In 1802 his claim to\r\npriority was recognised by a parliamentary committee, with the result\r\nthat £10,000 were then voted to him, and a further grant of £20,000 was\r\nmade in 1807, when vaccination was established at the Small-pox\r\nHospital. In 1814, George Stephenson, after many preliminary\r\nexperiments, made a successful trial of his first locomotive engine. In\r\n1812, Bell's steamboat, the _Comet_ made its first voyage on the Clyde,\r\nand the development of steam navigation proceeded more rapidly than that\r\nof steam locomotion by land. Sir Humphry Davy began his researches in\r\n1800, and took part in that year, with Count Rumford and Sir Joseph\r\nBanks, in founding the Royal Institution. His invention of the safety\r\nlamp was not matured until 1815.\r\n\r\nBut if the principal contributions of England to physical science in the\r\nearly years of the century were mainly in the direction of practical\r\napplication, her contributions to pure theory under the regency and in\r\nthe reign of William IV. were no less distinguished. Sir John Herschel,\r\nfollowing in the footsteps of his father, began in 1824 his observations\r\non double stars and his researches upon the parallax of fixed stars,\r\nwhile Sir George Airy published in 1826 his mathematical treatises on\r\nlunar and planetary theory. In Michael Faraday England possessed at once\r\nan eminent chemist and the greatest electrician of the age. The\r\ndiscovery of benzine and the liquefaction of numerous gases were\r\nfollowed by an investigation of electric currents, and in 1831 by the\r\ncrowning discovery of induction. Not less valuable perhaps than these\r\ndiscoveries of his own were the fertile suggestions which he left to\r\nothers. William Smith, sometimes called the father of modern English\r\ngeology, vigorously followed up the work of James Hutton by publishing\r\nin 1815 his great map of English _strata_ as identified by fossils.\r\nCharles Lyell's _Principles of Geology_ marks a great advance in\r\ngeological science. In this book, which appeared in 1833, the author\r\nadvanced the view, now universally accepted, that the great geological\r\nchanges of the past are not to be explained as catastrophes, followed by\r\nsuccessive creations, but as the product of the continuous play of\r\nforces still at work. This theory contained all that was vital in the\r\ndoctrine of evolution; but it was only at a later date, when the\r\ndoctrine had become the property of zoologists as well as geologists and\r\nhad been popularised by Darwin, that it came to exercise an influence\r\nover non-scientific thought.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _UNIVERSITY REFORM._]\r\n\r\nA review of the literary and scientific progress of this period would be\r\nincomplete without some notice of progress in higher education. The\r\nuniversities of Oxford and Cambridge with their numerous colleges had in\r\nthe eighteenth century lapsed into that lethargic condition which seemed\r\nto be the common fate of all corporations. They had to a certain extent\r\nceased to be seats of learning. At Oxford the limitations imposed upon\r\ncolleges by statute or custom in elections to fellowships and\r\nscholarships ensured the mediocrity of the teachers and gave the\r\npreference to mediocrities among the students. Where emoluments were not\r\nso restricted they were generally awarded by interest rather than by\r\nmerit; and it was even the case that a scholarship at Winchester,\r\ncarrying with it the right to a fellowship at New College, was often\r\npromised to an infant only a few days old. The Oxford examination system\r\nhad not been reformed since the time of Laud, and the degree\r\nexaminations had degenerated into mere formalities until the university\r\nin 1800 adopted a new examination statute, mainly under the influence of\r\nDr. Eveleigh, provost of Oriel. The new statute, which came into\r\noperation in 1802, granted honours to the better students of each year.\r\nThe number of candidates to whom honours were granted, at first very\r\nsmall, rapidly increased till in 1837 about 130 received honours in a\r\nsingle year. The attention which the examination system received from\r\nthe hebdomadal board, so often accused of sluggishness, is proved by the\r\nfrequent changes in the regulations, which among other things\r\ndifferentiated between honours in \"Literæ Humaniores\" and in mathematics\r\nin 1807, and separated the honours and pass examinations in 1830. The\r\nsame desire to encourage meritorious students showed itself in the\r\ninstitution of competitive examinations for fellowships, in which Oriel\r\nled the way. It was followed in 1817 by Balliol, which in 1827 threw\r\nopen its scholarships as well. It was not, however, till the reign of\r\nQueen Victoria that the college statutes as a whole were so modified as\r\nto make open competition possible in more than a very few instances.\r\n\r\nCambridge suffered less than Oxford from restrictions as to the choice\r\nof fellows. In fact the majority of the fellowships, more especially of\r\nthose which carried with them a vote in the government of the colleges,\r\nwere, so far as the statutes went, open to all comers. Though the course\r\nof study was still nominally regulated by statutes dating from the Tudor\r\nperiod, which it would often have been ludicrous to enforce, an\r\neffective stimulus was given to mathematical studies by the mathematical\r\ntripos, which had existed from the middle of the eighteenth century,\r\nand to which in 1824 a classical tripos was added. The ground covered by\r\nthese honour examinations was certainly narrower than that which lay\r\nwithin the scope of the corresponding examinations at Oxford, but at\r\nboth places the studies of most undergraduates were still directed more\r\nby the judgment of their tutors than by the regulations of the\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\nThese two universities were, however, subject to two limitations, which\r\nprevented them from providing a higher education for all aspiring\r\nstudents. The expense of living at Oxford and Cambridge, and the close\r\nconnexion of both universities with the Church of England, rendered them\r\ndifficult of access to many. These limitations were emphasised by the\r\nfact that Scotland possessed five universities which were the opposite\r\nof the English in both respects, and not a few English students could\r\nalways be found at the Scottish seats of learning. The reform ministry\r\nmade a serious effort to remove or alleviate the grievances of\r\ndissenters. Among other reforms mooted was the abolition of theological\r\ntests for matriculation and graduation. In 1834 a bill, which proposed\r\nto effect this change, but which left intact such tests as existed for\r\nfellowships and professorships, passed its second reading in the commons\r\nby a majority of 321 against 174, and its third reading by 164 against\r\n75. It was, however, thrown out on the second reading in the lords by\r\n187 votes against 85. Though in this particular case the demands of the\r\ndissenters were moderate, they were themselves opposed to other measures\r\nintroduced for their benefit, and the question of tests at Oxford and\r\nCambridge was not unnaturally allowed to rest for another twenty years.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _UNIVERSITY OF LONDON._]\r\n\r\nIt was only in the reign of George IV. that anything was done to provide\r\na university education for those who were unable to proceed to the\r\nancient seats of learning. But the movement, once started, progressed\r\nrapidly. The oldest of the university colleges, as they are now called,\r\nis St. David's College, Lampeter, which was founded in 1822, mainly\r\nthrough the exertions of Dr. Thomas Burgess, Bishop of St. David's, who\r\nwas supported by many others among the Welsh clergy. The college was\r\nopened in 1827, but at first it had no power of conferring degrees, and\r\ncontented itself with the education of candidates for holy orders. A\r\nmore important movement was initiated in 1825. In a public letter\r\nwritten by the poet Campbell to Brougham, the project of founding a\r\nuniversity of London, which should be free from denominational\r\nrestrictions, was advocated. The scheme was warmly embraced by many\r\nwhose names are found associated with other movements of the times.\r\nAmong them were Hume, Grote, Zachary Macaulay, Dudley, and Russell. A\r\nlarge proportion of the promoters of the new university had been\r\neducated at Scottish universities, and had therefore a clear idea of the\r\ntype of university which they might establish, and the movement,\r\nalthough started primarily in the interests of dissenters, received the\r\nsupport of many who still valued the connexion of the universities with\r\nthe Church. The \"London University,\" as it was called, was opened in\r\n1828, when classes were formed in arts, law, and medicine, but not in\r\ndivinity. It was technically a joint-stock company, and the attempt of\r\nthe shareholders to obtain a charter of incorporation was successfully\r\nresisted by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile some of the original supporters of the movement, regarding the\r\nnon-religious character of the new university with suspicion, had\r\ndecided to transfer their support to a new college, where the doctrine\r\nand worship of the Church of England should be recognised. The Duke of\r\nWellington took a lively interest in this movement, and King George\r\nIV.'s patronage gave the new institution the name of \"King's College\".\r\nThere seemed every reason to expect that the foundation would be on a\r\nmunificent scale, when Wellington's acceptance of catholic emancipation\r\noffended many of the subscribers so deeply that they immediately\r\nwithdrew from the undertaking, and the college was in consequence left\r\nalmost entirely without endowment. State recognition, however, was given\r\nit from the first. It was incorporated in 1829, and opened in 1831. In\r\n1835 the demand of \"London University\" for a charter received the\r\nsupport of the house of commons, and Lord Melbourne's government decided\r\nto propose a compromise, by which the so-called \"London University\" was\r\nto be converted into University College, and an examining body was to be\r\ncreated under the title of the University of London, while the work of\r\nteaching was to be performed by University College, King's College, and\r\nother colleges, which might from time to time be named by the crown.\r\nThese terms were accepted by the existing \"university,\" and charters\r\nwere given to the new university and to University College, London, in\r\n1836. It was thus left open to students or their parents to select\r\neither a denominational or an undenominational college, according to\r\ntheir preference.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile another university had been founded in the north of England.\r\nThe dean and chapter of Durham had determined to set aside a part of\r\ntheir emoluments for the foundation of a university, and the bishop had\r\nundertaken to assist them by attaching prebendal stalls in the cathedral\r\nto some of the professorships. An act of parliament was obtained in\r\n1832, authorising the establishment of the new university, which was\r\nopened in October, 1833, and was incorporated by a royal charter on June\r\n1, 1837. As an ecclesiastical foundation, the university of Durham was\r\nof course in the closest connexion with the established Church.\r\n\r\nNone of these new foundations could compare in respect of endowments\r\nwith the old universities of Oxford and Cambridge, yet it was not\r\naltogether without reason that the founders of University College,\r\nLondon, hoped to give as good an education at a greatly reduced cost. It\r\nmust be remembered that only a small fraction of the endowments of the\r\nold universities and their colleges was at this time applied to strictly\r\neducational purposes, and, until they should either be reformed or\r\nbecome more sensible of their opportunities, there was a fair field for\r\nan energetic rival.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the nineteenth century witnessed a marvellous expansion\r\nof manufacturing industry, not so much caused by new discoveries as by\r\nthe energetic application of those made at the end of the last century,\r\nby the growth of the factory-system, and, above all, by the monopoly of\r\nEnglish-made goods during the great war. The innovation of\r\nmachine-spinning and weaving by power-looms had an instant effect in\r\nstimulating and cheapening the production of cottons, but that of\r\nwoollens, cramped by heavy duties on the raw material, languished for\r\nsome time longer under traditional methods of handspinning. When\r\nstocking-frames and other forms of machinery penetrated at last into its\r\nstrongholds in the West Riding of Yorkshire and in the midland counties,\r\nthe demand for \"hands\" was inevitably reduced, and \"frame-breaking\"\r\nriots ensued, which lasted for several years. From this period dates the\r\nindustrial revolution which gradually abolished domestic industries,\r\nseparated mill-owners and mill-hands into almost hostile classes,\r\nundermined the system of apprenticeship, and brought about a large\r\nmigration of manufactures from centres with abundant water-power to\r\ncentres in close proximity to coal-fields.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _PROGRESS OF AGRICULTURE._]\r\n\r\nThe progress of British agriculture during the period under review was\r\nalmost as marked as that of British manufactures. Under the impulse of\r\nwar prices, and of the improvements adopted at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, the home-production of corn almost kept pace with the growing\r\nconsumption, and between 1801 and 1815 little more than 500,000 quarters\r\nof imported corn were required annually to feed the population. No\r\ndoubt, when the price of bread might rise to famine-point, the\r\nconsumption of it fell to a minimum per head; still, the rural\r\npopulation continued to multiply, though not so rapidly as the urban\r\npopulation, and neither could have been maintained without a constant\r\nincrease in the production of the soil. This result was due to a\r\nprogressive extension of enclosure and drainage, as well as to wise\r\ninnovations in the practice of agriculture. Not the least important of\r\nsuch innovations was the destruction of useless fences and straggling\r\nhedge-rows, the multitude and irregular outlines of which had long been\r\na picturesque but wasteful feature of old-fashioned English farming.\r\nThis was the age, too, in which many a small farm vanished by\r\nconsolidation, and many an ancient pasture was recklessly broken up,\r\nsome of which, though once more covered with green sward, have never\r\nrecovered their original fertility. Happily, the use of crushed bones\r\nfor manure was introduced in 1800, and the efforts of the national board\r\nof agriculture, aided by the discoveries of Sir Humphry Davy, brought\r\nabout a far more general application of chemical science to agriculture,\r\npartly compensating for the exhaustion of the soil under successive\r\nwheat crops. Not less remarkable was the effect of mechanical science in\r\nthe development of new agricultural implements, which, however, retained\r\na comparatively rude form of construction. The Highland Society of\r\nScotland took a leading part in encouraging these gradual experiments in\r\ntillage, as well as in the breeding of sheep and cattle, with a special\r\nregard to early maturity. Had the farmers of Great Britain during the\r\ngreat war possessed no more skill than their grandfathers, it would have\r\nbeen impossible for the soil of this island to have so nearly supported\r\nits inhabitants before the ports were freely thrown open.\r\n\r\nThe great triumphs of engineering in the fifteen years before the battle\r\nof Waterloo were mainly achieved in facilitating locomotion, and are\r\nspecially associated with the name of Telford. It was he who, following\r\nin the footsteps of Brindley and Smeaton, constructed the Ellesmere and\r\nCaledonian Canals; he far eclipsed the fame of General Wade by opening\r\nout roads and bridges in the highlands, and first adopted sound\r\nprinciples of road-making both in England and Wales, afterwards to be\r\napplied with marvellous success by Macadam. It is some proof of the\r\nimpulse given to land-travelling by such improvements that 1,355 public\r\nstage-coaches were assessed in 1812, and that a rate of speed little\r\nshort of ten miles an hour was attained by the lighter vehicles. But\r\nTelford's labours were not confined to roads or bridges; they extended\r\nalso to harbours and to canals, which continued to be the great arteries\r\nof heavy traffic until the development of railways. The new power\r\ndestined to supersede both coaches and barges was first recognised\r\npractically when Bell's little steam vessel the _Comet_ was navigated\r\ndown the Clyde in 1812, to be followed not many years later by a\r\nsteamship capable of crossing the Atlantic Ocean. In a few years steam\r\npackets were numerous, but it was not till well into the reign of\r\nVictoria that steam navigation was used in the royal navy.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _RAILWAYS._]\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous improvement in the social and economic condition of\r\nthe country between 1815 and 1837 is undoubtedly the invention of the\r\nsteam locomotive engine. A few steam locomotives had been invented\r\nbefore the former date, but they had met with little success and were as\r\nyet more costly than horse traction. It was only in or about the year\r\n1815 that George Stephenson, enginewright in Killingworth colliery,\r\nsucceeded in inventing a locomotive engine which was cheaper than\r\nhorse-power. The value of railways was by this time better understood.\r\nShort railways worked by horses were common in the neighbourhood of\r\ncollieries, and a few existed elsewhere. In 1821 Edward Pease obtained\r\nparliamentary powers to construct a railway between Stockton and\r\nDarlington. A visit to Killingworth persuaded him to make use of\r\nsteam-power. In 1823 an act authorising the use of steam on the proposed\r\nrailway was carried, and in 1825 the railway was opened. In 1826 an act\r\nwas passed for the construction of a railway between Liverpool and\r\nManchester. Stephenson was employed as engineer to make the line, and\r\nhis success as a road-making engineer proved equal to his brilliance as\r\na mechanical inventor.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 the line was completed. The directors were at first strongly\r\nopposed to the use of steam-locomotion, but were induced by Stephenson,\r\nbefore finally rejecting the idea, to offer a reward of £500 for the\r\nbest locomotive that could be made. Of four engines which were entered\r\nfor the competition, Stephenson's _Rocket_ was the only one that would\r\nmove, and it proved able to travel at the rate of thirty-five miles an\r\nhour. The opening of the railway in 1830, and the fatal accident to Mr.\r\nHuskisson which attended it, have been noticed already. The accident did\r\nmore to attract attention to the power of the locomotive than to\r\ndiscredit it. The opposition to railways was not, however, at an end. A\r\nproposal for a railway between London and Birmingham was carried through\r\nparliament, only after a struggle of some years' duration, but the\r\nconstruction of the line was at length authorised in 1833. The English\r\nrailway system now developed with great rapidity, and by the end of the\r\nreign of William IV. lines had been authorised which would when complete\r\nform a system, joining London with Dover, Southampton, and Bristol, and\r\nboth London and Bristol with Birmingham, whence lines were to run to the\r\nmost important places in Yorkshire and Lancashire, and on to Darlington.\r\nNumerous small lines served other portions of the country, partly in\r\nconnexion with these, but more often independently.\r\n\r\nAmong the more conspicuous metropolitan improvements of this age may be\r\nmentioned the introduction of gas and the incipient construction of new\r\nbridges over the Thames, in which the engineer Rennie took a leading\r\npart. Before the end of the eighteenth century the workshops of Boulton\r\nand Watt had been lit by gas, and Soho was illuminated by it to\r\ncelebrate the peace of Amiens. By 1807 it was used in Golden Lane, and\r\nby 1809, if not earlier, it had reached Pall Mall, but it scarcely\r\nbecame general in London until somewhat later. At the beginning of the\r\ncentury the metropolis possessed but three bridges, old London bridge\r\nand the old bridges at Blackfriars and Westminster. The first stone of\r\nthe Strand Bridge (afterwards to be called Waterloo Bridge) was laid on\r\nOctober 11, 1811, and Southwark Bridge was commenced in 1814, but these\r\nbridges were not completed till 1817 and 1819 respectively. The existing\r\nLondon Bridge, designed by Rennie, but built after his death, was\r\ncompleted in 1831. In 1812, the architect Nash was employed in laying\r\nout the Regent's Park, and in 1813 an act was passed for the\r\nconstruction of Regent Street, as a grand line of communication between\r\nit and Carlton House, the residence of the regent.\r\n\r\nThe work of geographical discovery had been well commenced before the\r\nend of the eighteenth century, and was inevitably checked during the\r\ngreat war. The wonderful voyages of Cook had revealed Australia and New\r\nZealand; Flinders had carried on the survey of the Australian coast;\r\nVancouver had explored the great island which bears his name with the\r\nadjacent shores; Rennell had produced his great map of India; Bruce had\r\npublished his celebrated travels in Abyssinia; and an association had\r\nbeen formed to dispel the darkness that hung over the whole interior of\r\nAfrica. Among its first emissaries was Mungo Park, who afterwards was\r\nemployed by the British government, and died in the course of his second\r\nexpedition in 1805-6. The idea of Arctic discovery was revived early in\r\nthe nineteenth century, and was no longer confined to commercial aims,\r\nsuch as the opening of a north-east or north-west passage, but was\r\nrather directed to scientific objects, not without the hope of reaching\r\nthe North Pole itself. Meanwhile, the ordnance survey of Great Britain\r\nitself was in full progress, and that of British India was commenced in\r\n1802, while the hydrographical department of the admiralty, established\r\nin 1795, was organising the system of marine-surveying which has since\r\nyielded such valuable fruits.\r\n\r\nThe progress of philanthropy, based on religious sentiment was very\r\nmarked during the later years of the war. The institution of Sunday\r\nschools between 1780 and 1790 had awakened a new sense of duty towards\r\nchildren in the community, and the growing use of child-labour, keeping\r\npace with the constant increase of machinery, forced upon the public\r\nthe necessity of legislative restrictions, which have been noticed in an\r\nearlier chapter. Banks of savings, the forerunners of savings banks\r\nunder parliamentary regulation, had been suggested by Jeremy Bentham,\r\nand one at least was instituted in 1802. The idea of penitentiaries, for\r\nthe reformation as well as for the punishment of criminals, had\r\noriginated with the great philanthropist, John Howard. It was adopted\r\nand popularised by Jeremy Bentham, and might have been further developed\r\nbut for the introduction of transportation, which promised the\r\nwell-conducted convict the prospect of a new life in a new country.\r\nMeanwhile, prison reform became a favourite study of benevolent\r\ntheorists in an age when the criminal law was still a relic of\r\nbarbarism, when highway robbery was rife in the neighbourhood of London,\r\nwhen sanitation was hardly in its infancy, when pauperism was fostered\r\nby the poor law, and when the working classes in towns were huddled\r\ntogether, without legal check or moral scruple, in undrained courts and\r\nunderground cellars. So capricious and shortsighted is the public\r\nconscience in its treatment of social evils.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _CANADA._]\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the nineteenth century the colonial empire of Great\r\nBritain was in a transitional state. The secession of thirteen American\r\ncolonies had not only robbed the mother country of its proudest\r\ninheritance, but had also shattered the old colonial system of\r\ncommercial monopoly for the supposed benefit of British interests. Its\r\nimmediate effect was to annul the navigation act as affecting American\r\ntrade, which became free to all the world, and by which Great Britain\r\nitself profited largely. Canada at once gained a new importance, and a\r\nnew sense of nationality, which Pitt recognised by dividing it into two\r\nprovinces, and giving each a considerable measure of independence, both\r\npolitical and commercial. It was troubled by the presence of a conquered\r\nrace of white colonists side by side with new colonists of English\r\nblood, who were, however, united in their resistance to the revolted\r\ncolonies in the war of 1812-14. After the war a steady stream of\r\nimmigration poured into Canada. In 1816 the population was estimated at\r\n450,000; between 1819 and 1829 Canada received 126,000 immigrants from\r\nEngland, and during the next ten years 320,000. The result was that the\r\nFrench element ceased to be preponderant, except in Lower Canada. The\r\nFrench Canadians felt that they did not enjoy their share of the\r\nconfidence of government; the home government, ready enough to grant any\r\nfavour that home opinion would permit, was trammelled by a public\r\nopinion, which suspected all who were of a French origin of a desire to\r\nrestore the supremacy of the Roman Catholic religion and to assert\r\npolitical independence. A vacillating policy was the result, which only\r\nincreased suspicions, and led in the first year of the reign of Victoria\r\nto a civil war.\r\n\r\nIn the Mauritius and the West Indies the one event of importance in this\r\nperiod is the abolition of slavery. It was found impossible to obtain\r\nfrom free negroes as much work as had been obtained from slaves, and\r\ntheir place had to be supplied by Indian coolies in the Mauritius, and\r\nby Chinese in Jamaica. At the same time the West Indies had begun to\r\nsuffer from the competition of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe colony of the Cape of Good Hope was still peopled almost entirely by\r\nblacks or by the descendants of Dutch settlers, known as _boers_, or\r\npeasants. Four thousand British colonists went out in 1820 to Algoa Bay,\r\nbut these were a mere handful compared with the Dutch. Unfortunately the\r\ngovernment adopted a line of policy which produced great irritation in\r\nthe Dutch population. They were granted no self-government, and in 1826\r\nEnglish judicial forms were introduced, and English was declared the\r\nsole official language. The reform administration made matters worse by\r\ndefending the blacks against the boers. In 1834 it set free the slaves,\r\noffering £1,200,000, payable in London, very little of which ever\r\nreached the boers, as compensation for slaves valued at £3,000,000. A\r\nKaffir war in 1834 had led to the conquest of Kaffraria, but in 1835 the\r\nhome government restored the independence of the Kaffirs, and appointed\r\na lieutenant-governor to defend their rights. After this the boers\r\nconsidered their position intolerable, and in 1835 began their first\r\n\"trek\" into the country now known as Natal.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _AUSTRALIA._]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the great discoveries of Captain Cook, and the first\r\nsettlement of New South Wales, brought within view a possible extension\r\nof our colonial dominion, which might go far to compensate for its\r\nlosses on the North American continent. Governor Phillip had been sent\r\nout by Pitt to Botany Bay in 1787-88, but it was many years before the\r\nearliest of Australian colonies outgrew the character of a penal refuge\r\nfor English convicts. The first convict establishments were at Sydney\r\nand Norfolk Island, but another settlement was founded on Van Diemen's\r\nLand in 1805, and in 1807, after this island had been circumnavigated by\r\nFlinders and Bass, it became the headquarters of that convict system,\r\nwhose horrors are not yet forgotten. Between 1810 and 1822 the resources\r\nof New South Wales were vastly developed by the energetic policy of\r\nGovernor Macquarie. While his efforts to utilise convict labour, and to\r\neducate convicts into free men, may have retarded the influx of genuine\r\ncolonists, he prepared the way for settlement by constructing roads,\r\npromoting exploration, and raising public buildings, so that when he\r\nreturned home the population of New South Wales had increased fourfold,\r\nand its settled territory in a much greater proportion. This territory\r\ncomprised all English settlements on the east coast, and included large\r\ntracts of what is now known as Queensland, which did not become a\r\nseparate colony until 1859.\r\n\r\nThe early history of Australia, it has been said, is chiefly a tale of\r\nconvict settlements, bush-ranging, and expeditions of discovery. There\r\nis much truth in this saying, but the real basis of Australian\r\nprosperity was the introduction of sheep-farming on a large scale, after\r\nthe merino-breed had been imported and acclimatised by Macarthur at the\r\nbeginning of the century. Long before the region stretching northward\r\nfrom the later Port Phillip grew into the colony of Victoria,\r\nsheep-owners were spreading over the vast pastures of the interior,\r\nthough many years elapsed before the explorer Sturt opened out the great\r\nprovinces further westward.\r\n\r\nThe development of Australia made rapid progress during the generation\r\nfollowing the great war. Though Australia itself and Van Diemen's Land,\r\nnow called Tasmania, were still in the main convict settlements, free\r\nsettlers had been arriving at Sydney for some time, and in 1817 they\r\nbegan to arrive in moderate numbers in Van Diemen's Land. In 1825 that\r\nisland had sufficiently progressed to be recognised as a separate\r\ncolony. The attempt to found a colony in western Australia in 1829 was,\r\non the other hand, an almost complete failure. But in 1824 a new centre\r\nof colonisation in New South Wales had been established at Port\r\nPhillip. Meanwhile a sharp cleavage of parties had arisen. The convicts\r\nand poorer colonists were opposed to the large sheep-owners, who were\r\nendeavouring to form an aristocracy. Governor Macquarie favoured the\r\nconvicts, and Governor Darling (1825-31) the sheep-owners. In 1823 a\r\nlegislative council, consisting of seven officials, had been instituted;\r\nin 1828 it was developed into one of fifteen members, chosen entirely\r\nfrom among the wealthiest colonists.\r\n\r\nGibbon Wakefield's _Letter from Sydney_, published in 1829, marks an\r\nepoch in the history of Australian colonisation. In this work he\r\nproposed that the land should be sold in small lots at a fairly high\r\nprice to settlers, and that the proceeds of the sales should be used to\r\npay the passage of emigrants going out as labourers. This idea had\r\nhardly been published when it was adopted by the home government, and\r\nfive shillings an acre was fixed as the minimum price of land. The\r\nnumber of emigrants increased rapidly, but the new system threatened\r\nruin to the owners of sheep-runs. Unable to pay the stipulated price,\r\nthey only moved further into the interior and occupied fresh land\r\nwithout seeking government permission, an unlicensed occupation which\r\nhas left its mark upon the language in the word \"squatter\". At last in\r\n1837 a compromise was arranged, by which the squatters were to pay a\r\nsmall rent for their runs, the crown retaining the freehold with the\r\nright to sell it to others at some future date. In 1834 the British\r\ngovernment sanctioned the formation of a new colony, that of South\r\nAustralia. It was to be settled from the outset on the Wakefield system,\r\nand no convicts were ever sent to it. The first lots were sold as high\r\nas twelve shillings an acre, and in 1836 a company of emigrants went out\r\nand founded Adelaide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDICES.\r\n\r\n                     I. ON AUTHORITIES.\r\n\r\n                    II. ADMINISTRATIONS, 1801-1837.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX I.\r\n\r\n                          ON AUTHORITIES.[141]\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) General histories of England for the period 1801-1837: MASSEY,\r\n_History of England during the Reign of George the Third_ (4 vols., 2nd\r\ned., 1865), closes with the treaty of Amiens in 1802, and therefore\r\nbarely touches this period. There is still room for a general history of\r\nEngland on an adequate scale between 1802 and 1815. After that date we\r\nhave HARRIET MARTINEAU, _History of England during the Thirty Years'\r\nPeace_ (1816-1846, 2 vols., 1849, 1850). This was begun by Charles\r\nKnight, the publisher, who brought it down to 1819. From 1820 onwards it\r\nis Miss Martineau's own work. It is too nearly contemporary to depend on\r\nany authorities except such as were published at the time, and it\r\nrepresents in the main the popular view of public events and public men\r\nheld by liberals at the time. Sir SPENCER WALPOLE'S _History of England\r\nfrom the Conclusion of the Great War in 1815_ (6 vols., revised ed.,\r\n1890), a work of high quality and thoroughly trustworthy, full of\r\nreferences to the best published authorities, sympathises with the whigs\r\nand more liberal tories. Reference is sometimes made in this volume to\r\nGOLDWIN SMITH, _The United Kingdom, a Political History_ (2 vols.,\r\n1899), but the work is too slight to be regarded as an authority. Sir T.\r\nE. MAY'S (Lord Farnborough) _Constitutional History of England from 1760\r\nto 1860_ (3 vols., 10th ed., 1891) is also useful.\r\n\r\n(2) The _Annual Register_ is probably the most useful authority for this\r\nperiod. In addition to more general information, it contains a very full\r\nreport of the more important parliamentary debates and the text of the\r\nprincipal public treaties and of numerous other state papers. The\r\nnarrative is not often coloured by the political partisanship of the\r\nwriter, but allowance must be made for the strong tory bias of the\r\nvolumes dealing with the reign of William IV. The _Parliamentary\r\nHistory_ closes in 1803, at which date Cobbett's _Parliamentary\r\nDebates_ had begun to appear. After 1812 Cobbett ceased to superintend\r\nthe work and his name was dropped, and in 1813 and afterwards the\r\ntitle-page acknowledged that the work was \"published under the\r\nsuperintendence of T. C. Hansard,\" who had also been the publisher of\r\nCobbett's series and of the _Parliamentary History_.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _MEMOIRS AND CORRESPONDENCE._]\r\n\r\n(3) Political and other memoirs and printed correspondence. The\r\nfollowing have been noticed among the authorities for volume x.: PELLEW,\r\n_Life and Correspondence of H. Addington, Viscount Sidmouth_ (3 vols.,\r\n1847), very full wherever Sidmouth was directly concerned, written with\r\na strong bias in favour of the subject of the biography. Lord STANHOPE,\r\n_Life of Pitt_ (4 vols., 3rd ed., 1867). The appendix to the last volume\r\ncontains Pitt's correspondence with the king in the years 1804-1806.\r\nLord ROSEBERY, _Pitt_ (Twelve English Statesmen Series, 1891), brilliant\r\nbut not always sound. Lord JOHN (Earl) RUSSELL, _Memorials and\r\nCorrespondence of C. J. Fox_ (4 vols., 1853-1854), and _Life and Times\r\nof C. J. Fox, 1859-1866_. _Memoirs of the Courts and Cabinets of George\r\nIII._ (4 vols., 1853-1855; 1801 falls in vol. iii.), continued in\r\n_Memoirs of the Court of England during the Regency_ (2 vols., 1856),\r\n_Memoirs of the Court of George IV._ (2 vols., 1859), and _Memoirs of\r\nthe Courts and Cabinets of William IV. and Victoria_ (2 vols., 1861;\r\n1837 is reached in vol. i.); these volumes, edited by the Duke of\r\nBuckingham, contain the correspondence of the Grenville family. The\r\nfirst series alone, which contains many important letters of Lord\r\nGrenville, is of first-rate importance. The editing is often inaccurate.\r\n_Diaries and Correspondence of the First Earl of Malmesbury_ (4 vols.,\r\n1844), edited by the third earl (vol. iv. extends from February, 1801,\r\nto July, 1809), authoritative and useful, especially for the crisis of\r\n1807. _Correspondence of Marquis Cornwallis_ (3 vols., 1859), edited by\r\nC. Ross, valuable for the negotiations at Amiens and for Cornwallis's\r\nbrief second governor-generalship of India. The notes are full of useful\r\nbiographical material concerning the persons mentioned in the\r\ncorrespondence. _Diaries and Correspondence of George Rose_ (2 vols.,\r\n1860), edited by L. V. Harcourt. _The Diary and Correspondence of\r\nCharles Abbot, Lord Colchester_, edited by his son (3 vols., 1861,\r\nextending from 1795 to 1829), with interesting notices of Perceval, and\r\ngenerally useful from 1802-1817, when Abbot was Speaker. Lord HOLLAND,\r\n_Memoirs of the Whig Party_ (2 vols., 1852), edited by his son, Lord\r\nHolland. These memoirs do not extend beyond the year 1807. Volume ii.,\r\nwhich covers the period during which Holland was a member of the\r\nGrenville cabinet, is of special importance. His memory is not always\r\naccurate, and he writes with a whig bias which makes him a harsh judge\r\nof George III. Holland's _Further Memoirs of the Whig Party, 1807-1821_,\r\nedited by Lord Stavordale, the present Lord Ilchester (1905),\r\ninteresting, and, like the earlier volumes, full of personal detail, but\r\nof less value, since Holland was not in office again till 1830.\r\n\r\nSimilar in character to the above, but only of importance after 1801 are\r\nthe following: _Life of Perceval_ (2 vols., 1874), by his grandson, Sir\r\nSpencer Walpole, written largely from the Perceval papers, especially\r\nvaluable for the ministerial crisis of 1809. The _Memoirs and\r\nCorrespondence of Viscount Castlereagh_ (12 vols., 1850-1853), edited by\r\nhis brother the third Marquis of Londonderry, consisting mainly of\r\nmilitary and diplomatic correspondence. Sir ARCHIBALD ALISON, _Lives of\r\nLord Castlereagh and Sir Charles Stewart, the Second and Third\r\nMarquesses of Londonderry_ (3 vols., 1861), much more political than\r\nbiographical; valuable and appreciative, but not rich in documents. _The\r\nDispatches of the Duke of Wellington during his various Campaigns in\r\nIndia, Denmark [etc.], from 1799 to 1818_ (12 vols., 1834-1838),\r\ncompiled by Lieut.-Colonel GURWOOD (really extending to 1815 only);\r\n_Supplementary Despatches and Memoranda of the Duke of Wellington_ (15\r\nvols., 1858-1872), edited by his son, the second Duke of Wellington,\r\nextending from 1797 to 1818; _Despatches, Correspondence, and Memoranda\r\nof the Duke of Wellington_ (8 vols., 1867-1880), by the same editor,\r\nextending from 1819 to 1832. The second and third of these series\r\ncontain not only the duke's despatches, but the vast mass of political\r\ncorrespondence which passed through his hands. In spite of the great\r\nsize of the collection, very little that can be considered trivial is\r\nincluded. It is our most important authority for all foreign relations\r\nbetween 1815 and 1827, and between 1828 and 1830. Sir HERBERT MAXWELL,\r\n_The Life of Wellington_ (2 vols., 1899). HORACE TWISS, _Life of Eldon_\r\n(3 vols., 1844). C. PHIPPS, _Memoir of R. Plumer Ward_ (2 vols., 1850),\r\ncontaining important political correspondence from 1801 onward, and\r\nWard's diary from 1809 to 1820. Ward held numerous minor offices in the\r\ngovernment and was on terms of intimacy with Perceval and Mulgrave.\r\nMOORE, _Life of Sheridan_ (2 vols., 1826), valuable for the crisis of\r\n1811. _The Greville Memoirs; a Journal of the Reigns of King George IV.\r\nand King William IV._ (3 vols.), edited by Henry Reeve. References are\r\nto the first edition, 1874. New edition, also including 1837-1860 in 8\r\nvols. (1888). Greville was clerk to the privy council from 1821 to 1859,\r\nand as such possessed exceptional opportunities for making himself\r\nacquainted with secret political transactions and with the personal\r\nqualities of successive statesmen. _The Creevey Papers_ (2 vols., 1903),\r\nedited by Sir Herbert Maxwell, not of first-rate historical importance,\r\nfull of gossip and scandal. Creevey was a whig member of parliament,\r\n1802-1818, 1820-1828 and 1831-1832, and treasurer of the ordnance,\r\n1830-1834. STAPLETON, _The Political Life of George Canning (from\r\nSeptember 1822 to August 1827)_ (3 vols., 1831), very full and valuable,\r\nespecially for foreign relations; strikingly deficient in documents and\r\ndates. _George Canning and His Times_ (1859), by the same author,\r\nlargely written from memory and therefore untrustworthy. YONGE, _Life\r\nand Administration of Lord Liverpool_ (3 vols., 1868). _Memoirs of Sir\r\nRobert Peel_ (2 vols., 1856-1857), prepared by Peel himself, and dealing\r\nwith the Roman Catholic question, the administration of 1834-1835, and\r\nthe repeal of the corn laws. The memoirs, which are of the highest\r\nimportance, consist mainly of correspondence and are studiously fair.\r\nPARKER, _Sir Robert Peel_ (3 vols., 1891-1899), a large collection of\r\nPeel's correspondence with a brief connecting narrative by the editor,\r\nof great value even for the periods covered by the _Memoirs_. _The\r\nCorrespondence of King William IV. and Earl Grey, from November 1830 to\r\nJune 1832_ (2 vols., 1867), edited by Henry, Earl Grey, valuable for the\r\nhistory of the reform. _The Melbourne Papers_ (1889), edited by Sanders,\r\nthrow light on Melbourne's relations with William IV. and with Brougham.\r\nTORRENS, _Memoirs of Melbourne_ (2 vols., 1878), polemical, and sadly\r\ndeficient in documents. Lord HATHERTON, _Memoir and Correspondence\r\nrelating to June and July, 1834_ (published 1872), edited by H. Reeve,\r\non events connected with the fall of Grey's ministry. _The Croker\r\nPapers_ (3 vols., 1884), edited by L. J. Jennings. Croker was secretary\r\nto the admiralty from 1809 to 1830. The papers, which are very full from\r\n1809 onwards, consist of correspondence and selections from Croker's\r\njournals and correspondence. L. HORNER, _Memoir of Francis Horner_\r\n(1843). E. HERRIES, _Public Life of J. C. Herries_ (1880), a defence of\r\nHerries against the sneers of whig writers. Lord DUDLEY, _Letters to the\r\nBishop of Llandaff_ (Copleston), (1840), and _Letters to Ivy_ (1905,\r\nedited by Romilly), interesting and often vivacious, but not of\r\nfirst-rate importance. Sir HENRY BULWER (Lord Dalling), _Life of\r\nPalmerston_ (2 vols., 1870), extending to 1840. The first chapter of a\r\nthird volume, edited by Evelyn Ashley (1874) makes good a few omissions\r\nbelonging to this period. The work consists mainly of correspondence and\r\nextracts from Palmerston's journal. _Memoirs of Baron Stockmar_ (2\r\nvols., 1872-1873), by his son Baron E. von Stockmar, edited by F. Max\r\nMüller. Stockmar was a confidential agent of Leopold, King of the\r\nBelgians. The memoirs contain a narrative by William IV. of the\r\npolitical history of his reign to 1835, including the circumstances of\r\nMelbourne's resignation in 1834. CAMPBELL, _Lives of the Chancellors_ (8\r\nvols., 1848-1869). The last volume contains excellent sketches of\r\nLyndhurst and Brougham, based largely on personal knowledge.\r\n_Correspondence of Princess Lieven and Earl Grey, 1824-1834_, edited by\r\nG. le Strange (1890). _Letters of Dorothea, Princess Lieven during Her\r\nResidence in London, 1812-1834_, edited by L. G. Robinson (1902).\r\n_Letters of Harriet, Countess Granville, 1810-1845_ (2 vols., 1894).\r\n\r\n(4) Miscellaneous books. Sir G. C. LEWIS, _Administrations of Great\r\nBritain (1783-1830)_, edited by Sir E. Head, 1864, has been mentioned\r\namong the authorities for volume x. It is a valuable history of the\r\ninner political life of England, but suffers from a strong whig bias.\r\nLECKY, _History of Ireland in the Eighteenth Century_ (5 vols., 1892),\r\nthough nominally closing at the union, throws light on Irish history at\r\nthe beginning of the nineteenth century. A. V. DICEY, _Lectures on the\r\nRelation between Law and Public Opinion in England during the Nineteenth\r\nCentury_ (1905), is very suggestive. HALÉVY, _La formation du\r\nradicalisme philosophique_ (3 vols., 1901-1904), and Sir L. STEPHEN,\r\n_The English Utilitarians_, vols. i., ii. (1900), are valuable for the\r\nhistory of the radical party. C. CREIGHTON, _History of Epidemics in\r\nBritain_ (2 vols., 1894), contains an excellent account of the cholera\r\nepidemic.\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _ON THE GREAT WAR._]\r\n\r\n(5) Books dealing with the great war are numerous. The following have\r\nbeen already noticed among the authorities for volume x.: Dr. HOLLAND\r\nROSE, _Life of Napoleon I._ (2 vols., 1904), our most trustworthy guide\r\nfor the career of the French emperor. The book has gained not a little\r\nfrom its author's independent researches at the British Foreign Office.\r\nCaptain MAHAN, _Influence of Sea Power upon the French Revolution and\r\nEmpire_ (2 vols., 1893), and _Life of Nelson_ (2 vols., 1897), valuable\r\nfor their general view of the naval warfare and commercial policy of the\r\nperiod. JAMES, _Naval History of Great Britain, 1793-1820_ (6 vols., ed.\r\n1826; vols. iii.-vi. extend from 1801-1820), very full and accurate,\r\nlargely used in this volume for the American war. Sir JOHN LAUGHTON,\r\n_Nelson_ (English Men of Action Series, 1895), and articles in the\r\n_Dictionary of National Biography_.\r\n\r\nTo these must be added ALISON'S _History of Europe from the Commencement\r\nof the French Revolution in 1789 to the Restoration of the Bourbons in\r\n1815_ (20 vols., 1847, 1848), an uncritical but still a standard work.\r\nThe reaction against Alison is probably due in large measure to\r\npolitical causes. In addition to the European history which gives its\r\ntitle to the book, it contains a narrative of the American war of\r\n1812-1814. The classical though far from trustworthy narrative on the\r\nFrench side is THIERS, _Histoire du Consulat et de l'Empire_ (21 vols.,\r\n1845-1869), translated into English by Campbell and Stebbing (12 vols.,\r\n1893-1894). See also LANFREY'S incomplete _History of Napoleon I._,\r\nEnglish translation (4 vols., 1871-1879), bitterly anti-Napoleonic. The\r\nnegotiations precedent to the outbreak of war in 1803 are to be found in\r\nMr. O. BROWNING'S _England and Napoleon in 1803_, containing despatches\r\nof Whitworth and others, published in 1887, and in P. COQUELLE,\r\n_Napoleon and England, 1803-1813_, translated by G. D. KNOX (1904),\r\nbased on the reports of Andréossy, the French ambassador at London. Sir\r\nH. BUNBURY'S _Narrative of Certain Passages, etc._ (1853) is of the\r\nhighest value for the war in the Mediterranean. The _Times_ of September\r\n16, 19, 22, 26, 28, 30, and October 19, 1905, contains an excellent\r\nseries of articles on Nelson's tactics at Trafalgar. For the Moscow\r\ncampaign, the Marquis DE CHAMBRAY'S _Histoire de l'Expédition de Russie_\r\n(3 vols., 1839) is perhaps the most reliable of contemporary narratives.\r\nThere is a good account of the campaign in the Rev. H. B. GEORGE'S\r\n_Napoleon's Invasion of Russia_ (1899). For the Peninsular war, W.\r\nNAPIER'S _History of the War in the Peninsula and in the South of\r\nFrance_ (6 vols.; vols. i.-iii., ed. 1835-1840; iv.-vi., 1834-1840) is\r\nof the highest literary as well as historical value. C. OMAN'S _History\r\nof the Peninsular War_ (in progress, vols. i., ii., 1902-1903, extending\r\nat present to September, 1809) makes good use of Spanish sources of\r\ninformation. The _Wellington Dispatches_ have been noticed already in\r\nsection 3. The _Diary of Sir John Moore_, edited by Sir J. F. Maurice (2\r\nvols., 1904), is of value for the campaign of 1808-1809. For Waterloo,\r\nin addition to Maxwell's _Life of Wellington_, and Rose's _Life of\r\nNapoleon I._, Chesney's _Waterloo Lectures_, 1868; W. O'CONNOR MORRIS,\r\n_The Campaign of 1815_ (1900), and J. C. ROPES, _The Campaign of\r\nWaterloo_, may be studied with profit. Morris's work must, however, be\r\ndiscounted for his extravagant admiration of Napoleon's genius and his\r\nfaith in the Grouchy legend. For the disputes with the United States and\r\nwar of 1812-1814, see chapters in the _Cambridge Modern History_ (vol.\r\nvii., 1903); BOURINOT, _Canada_ (Story of the Nations), (1897); J.\r\nSCHOULER, _History of the United States of America under the\r\nConstitution_ (6 vols., 1880-1889); and MAHAN, _Sea Power in Its\r\nRelations to the War of 1812_ (2 vols., 1905).\r\n\r\n[Pageheading: _ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS._]\r\n\r\n(6) For European politics and foreign relations generally, in addition\r\nto some of the books mentioned in the last section, we have C. A.\r\nFYFFE'S _History of Modern Europe, 1792-1878_ (ed. 1895), a very\r\nreadable book, which includes the results of some original study, and\r\nSEIGNOBOS, _Political History of Contemporary Europe_, English\r\ntranslation (2 vols., 1901), an useful but not always accurate book. The\r\ngreat French work, _Histoire générale du IVe Siècle à nos jours_ (vols.\r\nix., x., 1897-1898), by numerous authors, edited by MM. Lavisse and\r\nRambaud, is naturally of varying merit; the chapters on France and\r\nRussia are the best, and there is a very full bibliography at the close\r\nof each chapter. The _Cambridge Modern History_, vol. ix., _Napoleon_\r\n(1906), is a similar compilation by English writers. ALFRED STERN'S\r\n_Geschichte Europas seit den Verträgen von 1815_ (3 vols., 1894-1901, to\r\nbe continued to 1871) is perhaps the best general history of the period\r\nfollowing the great war. _The Memoirs of Prince Metternich_ (5 vols.,\r\nEnglish translation, 1881-1882, edited by Prince Richard Metternich,\r\nextending to 1835) contain much that is valuable for diplomatic history.\r\nFor French history see DUVERGIER DE HAURANNE, _Histoire du gouvernement\r\nparlementaire en France_ (1814-1848, 10 vols., 1857-1872), which, in\r\nspite of the title, does not extend beyond 1830. For the Greek revolt,\r\nvols. vi. and vii. of G. FINLAY'S _History of Greece_ (7 vols., ed.\r\n1877) are important. American policy is treated by J. W. FOSTER, _A\r\nCentury of American Diplomacy_ (1901). Sir EDWARD HERTSLET'S _Map of\r\nEurope by Treaty_ (4 vols., 1875-1891), while professedly confined to\r\nthe treaties dealing with boundaries, contains the majority of those of\r\ngeneral historical interest. It covers the period 1815-1891. LE COMTE DE\r\nGARDEN, _Histoire générale des traités de paix_ (14 vols., 1848-1888,\r\nvols. vi.-xv., extending to 1814), and F. DE MARTENS, _Recueil des\r\ntraités et conventions, conclus par la Russie_ (tomes xi., xii.\r\n(Angleterre), 1895-1898), contain the principal treaties belonging to\r\nthe period. The _Castlereagh_ and _Wellington_ _Despatches_ have been\r\nnoticed under section 3.\r\n\r\n(7) For Indian history: JAMES MILL and WILSON, _History of British\r\nIndia_ (10 vols., 1858), vols. vi.-ix., noticed as an authority for\r\nvolume x., ends in 1835; Sir ALFRED C. LYALL'S _Rise and Expansion of\r\nthe British Dominion in India_ (1894) contains a brief and masterly\r\nsketch of the subject. See also _A Selection from the Despatches,\r\nTreaties and Other Papers of the Marquess Wellesley_ (1877), well edited\r\nby S. J. Owen; the first two series of the _Wellington Dispatches_,\r\nnoticed under section 3; and the vast mass of information collected in\r\nSir W. W. HUNTER'S _Imperial Gazetteer of India_ (14 vols., 1885-1887).\r\n\r\n(8) For social and economic history: Dr. W. CUNNINGHAM'S _The Growth of\r\nEnglish Industry and Commerce in Modern Times_, vol. iii., _Laissez\r\nFaire_ (1903), extending from 1776 to 1850, is now the standard work.\r\nReference has also been made to G. R. PORTER, _Progress of the Nation_\r\n(1847), a work abounding more in statistics than in narrative, and to\r\nSir GEORGE NICHOLLS, _History of the English Poor Law_ (2 vols., 1854).\r\nNicholls took an active interest in social and economic questions from\r\n1816 till his death in 1857. He probably understood the working of the\r\npoor-law better than any other man of that date, and the poor-law\r\nlegislation of 1834 and 1838 was largely founded on his suggestions. He\r\nwas one of the poor-law commissioners of 1834, and was permanent\r\nsecretary to the poor-law board from 1847 to 1851. Sir G. C. LEWIS, _The\r\nGovernment of Dependencies_ (1891), edited by C. P. Lucas, and LUCAS,\r\n_Historical Geography of the British Colonies_, vols. i.-v. (1888-1901),\r\nare of value. For literary history, SAINTSBURY'S _History of Nineteenth\r\nCentury Literature, 1780-1895_, (1896), is an excellent guide. For\r\neducational progress at Oxford University reference may be made to the\r\n_Report of H.M.'s Commissioners appointed to inquire into the State,\r\netc., of the University and Colleges of Oxford_ (1852), which contains a\r\ngood historical summary. The report of the similar commission appointed\r\nfor Cambridge hardly touches the progress of studies, and is therefore\r\nof less value to the historical student.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[141] The dates given are, as far as possible, those of the editions\r\nused by the authors of this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                APPENDIX II.\r\n\r\n                         ADMINISTRATIONS, 1801-1837.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         1.
